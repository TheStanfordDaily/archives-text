# Stanford men swim to NCAA title
## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
AUSTIN, Texas — Stanford won the NCAA Men's
Swimming Championship for the first time in 18 years
Saturday, amassing 403.5 points and defeating Florida, its
closest challenger, by more than 74 points.
Following Florida's second-place finish of 329 points
were Texas with 306, California with 294, USC with 230
and UCLA with 224.
How does a team feel after accomplishing an honor
such as this? Only the Cardinal swimmers and Stanford
coach Skip Kenney can say:
"It feels like flying," "the ultimate natural high," "the
greatest," "awesome," "the culmination of everything,"
"totally psyched," "perfect."
The list goes on. Perhaps the only lists that are longer
are those containing the number of NCAA, U.S. Open
and American records that were set during the three-day
meet, the number of Cardinal swimmers who claimed
championship titles and, most important, the number of
dreams that finally came true.
"There is no possible way to put this feeling into
words," senior co-captain Dave Bottom said. "To be able
to share this honor with a team like ours is like a dream
come true."
"1 feel like I'm living in a dream, and I could care less if
I never come out of it," Kenney said. "I think what means
the most, rather than the actual title itself, is being able to
see the awesome glow on our swimmers' faces after we
won. . . . It's a glow I'll never forget for as long as I live."
The Stanford swimmers had every reason to be glowing,
considering their record-setting performances throughout
the three days of competition. En route to seven individ
ual titles and one relay title, the Cardinal set three NCAA
records, three U.S. Open records, four American records
and numerous Stanford records.
The Cardinal started off its record-breaking streak

during the first day of preliminary races as the 400-yard
medley relay of Bottom, John Moffet, Pablo Morales and
Rick Bodor broke all four records with a time of 3:11.93
to claim the No. 1 qualifying time for the evening's finals.
The previous record, 3:12.63, was held by Southern
Methodist.
During Thursday night's finals, the team, with David
Lundberg swimming the final leg, broke the morning's
records with a winning time of 3:10.92.
"This medley relay team is absolutely the best of all
time," Kenney said. "When you take four great athletes
like we have and put them together on one team, the
results are awesome."
Even excluding the remarkable finish of the medley
relay, Stanford's total team scoring during the first day
was proof that the Cardinal "was really on," according to
Kenney.
Stanford opened the meet with a sixth-place finish by
Jeff Kostoff in the 500 freestyle and followed with a first
place finish by Morales in the 200 individual medley
(1:46.08).
"Throughout the event 1 was considering my place and
not my time," Morales said. "All 1 wanted to do was hit
the wall first so I could give my team as many points as I
could."
In the same event, Moffet finished sixth (1:48.05), Bot
tom finished ninth (1:47.58) and Lundberg finished 11th
(1:48.4) for the Cardinal.
To finish Stanford's almost perfect day of competition,
the Cardinal received an extra scoring boost from diver
Thor Johnson, who finished seventh in the 1-meter com
petition.
"It is a fine accomplishment for Thor to finish so well
among such a strong field of divers," Diving Coach Rick
Shavone said. "Thor has come a long way since he first

walked on as a freshman, and 1 am
very, very proud of him."
With Johnson's diving points in
cluded, Stanford closed out the first
day with a 113-91 lead over Florida.
"We had a great first day, no doubt
about it, and it is very important to
ge( off to a strong start," Kenney
said. "We wanted to score about 100
points during the first day, so we
came out a little better than we had
hoped."
The second day of competition
proved to be just as strong for the
Cardinal, as it widened its lead to 56,
outscoring Florida 153-119 during
the evening's championship and con
solation finals.
Morales started off the day with his
second consecutive championship
victory in the 100 butterfly, breaking
his own previous NCAA, American
and U.S. Open record of 47.02 with a
time of 46.52.
Stanford freshman Anthony Mosse
finished seventh in the championship
final of the same event, clocking a
time of 48.46.
The Cardinal was also able to place
two swimmers in the 100 breaststroke
as Moffet (53.62) won the event for
the- second year in a row.
"1 never really felt like I got going,
but winning and getting those points
for the team are the most important
things," Moffet said. "It's super to be
able to win a title for the team, but
the guys who are placing 10th and
1 1 th for us are just as important, and
they are the ones that are winning this

meet for us."
Lundberg won the consolation final
of the 100 breaststoke with a time of
55.21 to finish ninth for Stanford.
Although Bottom entered the 100
backstroke final with the top time of
48.31, there was no stopping UCLA's
Tom Jager, who won the event with
his record-setting time of 48.21. The
previous NCAA, American and U.S.
Open record of 48.25 was set by Rick
Carey of Texas in 1983.
Bottom finished second (48.68)
behind Jager, while freshman Sean
Murphy placed eighth for the Card
inal with a time of 49.87.
The records continued to fall as
Kostoff set a new American record in
the 400 individual medley with a pre
liminary time of 3:46.54. Kostoff
went on to win the championship
final with a slightly slower 3:47.11.
"I swam really well in the
preliminaries but in the final there
was just something missing and it
showed in my time," Kostoff said. "It
would have been nice to break the
U.S. Open record, but breaking
records isn't something our team is
focusing on right now. Basically, all
we are talking about is swimming fast
and scoring points."
Freshman Matt Nance handed the
Cardinal an eighth-place finish in the
400 1M with a time of 3:56.87.
To finish off the Cardinal's ac
complishments for the night, the
Stanford 400 freestyle relay team of
Bottom, Morales, Bodor and
Lundberg finished fourth with an un
expected time of 2:55.79.

"I still can't believe our 400
freestyle relay," Kenney said. "I
thought that if we had our last guy get
out of the pool and run on the deck
for the last leg, we could go a 2:56.00,
and then we ended up a 2:55.79, just
swimming."
The Cal team of Thomas
Ledjstrom, Michael Soderlund,
Bengt Baron and Matt Biondi won
the 400 relay with a record-setting
time of 2:53.15.
Following the Cardinal's outstand

ing performance Friday, Kenney had
nothing but high hopes for the final
day of competition.
"We have had the necessary mo
mentum since day one, and if we can
carry that over into the last day, we
have a strong chance of winning the
title," Kenney said. "If everyone
swims to their potential on our last
day, we will finally take home that
trophy."
As it turned out, not only did the
Cardinal swimmers perform to their

potential, but they swam beyond it,
winning three of the last day's events.
Kostoff started the team off on a
promising note, finishing fifth in the
1,650 freestyle (14:58.49) behind
champion Mike O'Brien of USC
(14:41.43).
In the next event. Murphy earned
the first NCAA title of his career as
he won the 200 backstroke in
1:46.29.
"With the title so close for us right
now, it is like finally seeing a light at

the end of the tunnel," Murphy said
after his victory. "That light is be
coming very clear and bright, and
with that shining in my mind, I can't
help but swim well."
Bottom finished fourth for the
Cardinal in same event with a time of
1:47.73.
Stanford went on to win the last
two individual events of the meet as
Moffet won the 200 breaststroke
(1:55.96) and Morales won the 200
butterfly in a record-breaking
1:42.85.
Morales' time, almost one second
faster than the previous record of
1:43.81, set new American, U.S.
Open and NCAA records.
Mosse finished third in the 200
butterfly (1:44.82) and Lundberg
finished 10th in the 200 breaststroke
(2:00.91).
Entering the final event, the 800
freestyle relay, Stanford held a lead
of more than 50 points. That did not
give David Louden, Bodor, Kostoff
and Bottom any reason to take it
easy, as they finished sixth with a time
of 6:34.75.
"I have been worried about our
freestyle relays since the start of this
season, but with the way they have
come through here, 1 guess I
shouldn't have," Kenney said. "Our
time in the final relay is really a nice
way to close out a spectacular meet."
In the diving competition,
Arkansas' Ron Meyer won both the 1-
and 3-meter competition's with
scores of 548.10 and 606.70,
respectively.

give David Louden, Bodor, Kostoff
and Bottom any reason to take it
easy, as they finished sixth with a time
of 6:34.75.
"I have been worried about our
freestyle relays since the start of this
season, but with the way they have
come through here, 1 guess I
shouldn't have," Kenney said. "Our
time in the final relay is really a nice
way to close out a spectacular meet."
In the diving competition,
Arkansas' Ron Meyer won both the 1-

scores of 548.10 and 606.70,
respectively.

John Moffet won the 100- and 200-yard breaststroke races and swam the breaststroke leg on Stanford's
record-setting 400 medley relay team at the NCAA Championships.
AUSTIN, Texas — Stanford won the NCAA Men's
Swimming Championship for the first time in 18 years
Saturday, amassing 403.5 points and defeating Florida, its
closest challenger, by more than 74 points.
Following Florida's second-place finish of 329 points
were Texas with 306, California with 294, USC with 230
and UCLA with 224.
How does a team feel after accomplishing an honor
such as this? Only the Cardinal swimmers and Stanford
coach Skip Kenney can say:
"It feels like flying," "the ultimate natural high," "the
greatest," "awesome," "the culmination of everything,"
"totally psyched," "perfect."
The list goes on. Perhaps the only lists that are longer
are those containing the number of NCAA, U.S. Open
and American records that were set during the three-day
meet, the number of Cardinal swimmers who claimed
championship titles and, most important, the number of
dreams that finally came true.
"There is no possible way to put this feeling into
words," senior co-captain Dave Bottom said. "To be able
to share this honor with a team like ours is like a dream
come true."
"1 feel like I'm living in a dream, and I could care less if
I never come out of it," Kenney said. "I think what means
the most, rather than the actual title itself, is being able to
see the awesome glow on our swimmers' faces after we
won. . . . It's a glow I'll never forget for as long as I live."
The Stanford swimmers had every reason to be glowing,
considering their record-setting performances throughout
the three days of competition. En route to seven individ
ual titles and one relay title, the Cardinal set three NCAA
records, three U.S. Open records, four American records
and numerous Stanford records.
The Cardinal started off its record-breaking streak

during the first day of preliminary races as the 400-yard
medley relay of Bottom, John Moffet, Pablo Morales and
Rick Bodor broke all four records with a time of 3:11.93
to claim the No. 1 qualifying time for the evening's finals.
The previous record, 3:12.63, was held by Southern
Methodist.
During Thursday night's finals, the team, with David
Lundberg swimming the final leg, broke the morning's
records with a winning time of 3:10.92.
"This medley relay team is absolutely the best of all
time," Kenney said. "When you take four great athletes
like we have and put them together on one team, the
results are awesome."
Even excluding the remarkable finish of the medley
relay, Stanford's total team scoring during the first day
was proof that the Cardinal "was really on," according to
Kenney.
Stanford opened the meet with a sixth-place finish by
Jeff Kostoff in the 500 freestyle and followed with a first
place finish by Morales in the 200 individual medley
(1:46.08).
"Throughout the event 1 was considering my place and
not my time," Morales said. "All 1 wanted to do was hit
the wall first so I could give my team as many points as I
could."
In the same event, Moffet finished sixth (1:48.05), Bot
tom finished ninth (1:47.58) and Lundberg finished 11th
(1:48.4) for the Cardinal.
To finish Stanford's almost perfect day of competition,
the Cardinal received an extra scoring boost from diver
Thor Johnson, who finished seventh in the 1-meter com
petition.
"It is a fine accomplishment for Thor to finish so well
among such a strong field of divers," Diving Coach Rick
Shavone said. "Thor has come a long way since he first

walked on as a freshman, and 1 am
very, very proud of him."
With Johnson's diving points in
cluded, Stanford closed out the first
day with a 113-91 lead over Florida.
"We had a great first day, no doubt
about it, and it is very important to
ge( off to a strong start," Kenney
said. "We wanted to score about 100
points during the first day, so we
came out a little better than we had
hoped."
The second day of competition
proved to be just as strong for the
Cardinal, as it widened its lead to 56,
outscoring Florida 153-119 during
the evening's championship and con
solation finals.
Morales started off the day with his
second consecutive championship
victory in the 100 butterfly, breaking
his own previous NCAA, American
and U.S. Open record of 47.02 with a
time of 46.52.
Stanford freshman Anthony Mosse
finished seventh in the championship
final of the same event, clocking a
time of 48.46.
The Cardinal was also able to place
two swimmers in the 100 breaststroke
as Moffet (53.62) won the event for
the- second year in a row.
"1 never really felt like I got going,
but winning and getting those points
for the team are the most important
things," Moffet said. "It's super to be
able to win a title for the team, but
the guys who are placing 10th and
1 1 th for us are just as important, and
they are the ones that are winning this

meet for us."
Lundberg won the consolation final
of the 100 breaststoke with a time of
55.21 to finish ninth for Stanford.
Although Bottom entered the 100
backstroke final with the top time of
48.31, there was no stopping UCLA's
Tom Jager, who won the event with
his record-setting time of 48.21. The
previous NCAA, American and U.S.
Open record of 48.25 was set by Rick
Carey of Texas in 1983.
Bottom finished second (48.68)
behind Jager, while freshman Sean
Murphy placed eighth for the Card
inal with a time of 49.87.
The records continued to fall as
Kostoff set a new American record in
the 400 individual medley with a pre
liminary time of 3:46.54. Kostoff
went on to win the championship
final with a slightly slower 3:47.11.
"I swam really well in the
preliminaries but in the final there
was just something missing and it
showed in my time," Kostoff said. "It
would have been nice to break the
U.S. Open record, but breaking
records isn't something our team is
focusing on right now. Basically, all
we are talking about is swimming fast
and scoring points."
Freshman Matt Nance handed the
Cardinal an eighth-place finish in the
400 1M with a time of 3:56.87.
To finish off the Cardinal's ac
complishments for the night, the
Stanford 400 freestyle relay team of
Bottom, Morales, Bodor and
Lundberg finished fourth with an un
expected time of 2:55.79.

"I still can't believe our 400
freestyle relay," Kenney said. "I
thought that if we had our last guy get
out of the pool and run on the deck
for the last leg, we could go a 2:56.00,
and then we ended up a 2:55.79, just
swimming."
The Cal team of Thomas
Ledjstrom, Michael Soderlund,
Bengt Baron and Matt Biondi won
the 400 relay with a record-setting
time of 2:53.15.
Following the Cardinal's outstand

ing performance Friday, Kenney had
nothing but high hopes for the final
day of competition.
"We have had the necessary mo
mentum since day one, and if we can
carry that over into the last day, we
have a strong chance of winning the
title," Kenney said. "If everyone
swims to their potential on our last
day, we will finally take home that
trophy."
As it turned out, not only did the
Cardinal swimmers perform to their

potential, but they swam beyond it,
winning three of the last day's events.
Kostoff started the team off on a
promising note, finishing fifth in the
1,650 freestyle (14:58.49) behind
champion Mike O'Brien of USC
(14:41.43).
In the next event. Murphy earned
the first NCAA title of his career as
he won the 200 backstroke in
1:46.29.
"With the title so close for us right
now, it is like finally seeing a light at

the end of the tunnel," Murphy said
after his victory. "That light is be
coming very clear and bright, and
with that shining in my mind, I can't
help but swim well."
Bottom finished fourth for the
Cardinal in same event with a time of
1:47.73.
Stanford went on to win the last
two individual events of the meet as
Moffet won the 200 breaststroke
(1:55.96) and Morales won the 200
butterfly in a record-breaking
1:42.85.
Morales' time, almost one second
faster than the previous record of
1:43.81, set new American, U.S.
Open and NCAA records.
Mosse finished third in the 200
butterfly (1:44.82) and Lundberg
finished 10th in the 200 breaststroke
(2:00.91).
Entering the final event, the 800
freestyle relay, Stanford held a lead
of more than 50 points. That did not
give David Louden, Bodor, Kostoff
and Bottom any reason to take it
easy, as they finished sixth with a time
of 6:34.75.
"I have been worried about our

Cardinal in same event with a time of
1:47.73.
Stanford went on to win the last
two individual events of the meet as
Moffet won the 200 breaststroke
(1:55.96) and Morales won the 200
butterfly in a record-breaking
1:42.85.
Morales' time, almost one second
faster than the previous record of
1:43.81, set new American, U.S.
Open and NCAA records.
Mosse finished third in the 200
butterfly (1:44.82) and Lundberg
finished 10th in the 200 breaststroke
(2:00.91).
Entering the final event, the 800
freestyle relay, Stanford held a lead
of more than 50 points. That did not
give David Louden, Bodor, Kostoff
and Bottom any reason to take it
easy, as they finished sixth with a time
of 6:34.75.
"I have been worried about our
freestyle relays since the start of this
season, but with the way they have
come through here, 1 guess I
shouldn't have," Kenney said. "Our
time in the final relay is really a nice
way to close out a spectacular meet."
In the diving competition,
Arkansas' Ron Meyer won both the 1-
and 3-meter competition's with
scores of 548.10 and 606.70,
respectively.

John Moffet won the 100- and 200-yard breaststroke races and swam the breaststroke leg on Stanford's
record-setting 400 medley relay team at the NCAA Championships.
AUSTIN, Texas — Stanford won the NCAA Men's
Swimming Championship for the first time in 18 years
Saturday, amassing 403.5 points and defeating Florida, its
closest challenger, by more than 74 points.
Following Florida's second-place finish of 329 points
were Texas with 306, California with 294, USC with 230
and UCLA with 224.
How does a team feel after accomplishing an honor
such as this? Only the Cardinal swimmers and Stanford
coach Skip Kenney can say:
"It feels like flying," "the ultimate natural high," "the
greatest," "awesome," "the culmination of everything,"
"totally psyched," "perfect."
The list goes on. Perhaps the only lists that are longer
are those containing the number of NCAA, U.S. Open
and American records that were set during the three-day
meet, the number of Cardinal swimmers who claimed
championship titles and, most important, the number of
dreams that finally came true.
"There is no possible way to put this feeling into
words," senior co-captain Dave Bottom said. "To be able
to share this honor with a team like ours is like a dream
come true."
"1 feel like I'm living in a dream, and I could care less if
I never come out of it," Kenney said. "I think what means
the most, rather than the actual title itself, is being able to
see the awesome glow on our swimmers' faces after we
won. . . . It's a glow I'll never forget for as long as I live."
The Stanford swimmers had every reason to be glowing,
considering their record-setting performances throughout
the three days of competition. En route to seven individ
ual titles and one relay title, the Cardinal set three NCAA
records, three U.S. Open records, four American records
and numerous Stanford records.
The Cardinal started off its record-breaking streak

during the first day of preliminary races as the 400-yard
medley relay of Bottom, John Moffet, Pablo Morales and
Rick Bodor broke all four records with a time of 3:11.93
to claim the No. 1 qualifying time for the evening's finals.
The previous record, 3:12.63, was held by Southern
Methodist.
During Thursday night's finals, the team, with David
Lundberg swimming the final leg, broke the morning's
records with a winning time of 3:10.92.
"This medley relay team is absolutely the best of all
time," Kenney said. "When you take four great athletes
like we have and put them together on one team, the
results are awesome."
Even excluding the remarkable finish of the medley
relay, Stanford's total team scoring during the first day
was proof that the Cardinal "was really on," according to
Kenney.
Stanford opened the meet with a sixth-place finish by
Jeff Kostoff in the 500 freestyle and followed with a first
place finish by Morales in the 200 individual medley
(1:46.08).
"Throughout the event 1 was considering my place and
not my time," Morales said. "All 1 wanted to do was hit
the wall first so I could give my team as many points as I
could."
In the same event, Moffet finished sixth (1:48.05), Bot
tom finished ninth (1:47.58) and Lundberg finished 11th
(1:48.4) for the Cardinal.
To finish Stanford's almost perfect day of competition,
the Cardinal received an extra scoring boost from diver
Thor Johnson, who finished seventh in the 1-meter com
petition.
"It is a fine accomplishment for Thor to finish so well
among such a strong field of divers," Diving Coach Rick
Shavone said. "Thor has come a long way since he first

walked on as a freshman, and 1 am
very, very proud of him."
With Johnson's diving points in
cluded, Stanford closed out the first
day with a 113-91 lead over Florida.
"We had a great first day, no doubt
about it, and it is very important to
ge( off to a strong start," Kenney
said. "We wanted to score about 100
points during the first day, so we
came out a little better than we had
hoped."
The second day of competition
proved to be just as strong for the
Cardinal, as it widened its lead to 56,
outscoring Florida 153-119 during
the evening's championship and con
solation finals.
Morales started off the day with his
second consecutive championship
victory in the 100 butterfly, breaking
his own previous NCAA, American
and U.S. Open record of 47.02 with a
time of 46.52.
Stanford freshman Anthony Mosse
finished seventh in the championship
final of the same event, clocking a
time of 48.46.
The Cardinal was also able to place
two swimmers in the 100 breaststroke
as Moffet (53.62) won the event for
the- second year in a row.
"1 never really felt like I got going,
but winning and getting those points
for the team are the most important
things," Moffet said. "It's super to be
able to win a title for the team, but
the guys who are placing 10th and
1 1 th for us are just as important, and
they are the ones that are winning this

meet for us."
Lundberg won the consolation final
of the 100 breaststoke with a time of
55.21 to finish ninth for Stanford.
Although Bottom entered the 100
backstroke final with the top time of
48.31, there was no stopping UCLA's
Tom Jager, who won the event with
his record-setting time of 48.21. The
previous NCAA, American and U.S.
Open record of 48.25 was set by Rick
Carey of Texas in 1983.
Bottom finished second (48.68)
behind Jager, while freshman Sean
Murphy placed eighth for the Card
inal with a time of 49.87.
The records continued to fall as
Kostoff set a new American record in
the 400 individual medley with a pre
liminary time of 3:46.54. Kostoff
went on to win the championship
final with a slightly slower 3:47.11.
"I swam really well in the
preliminaries but in the final there
was just something missing and it
showed in my time," Kostoff said. "It
would have been nice to break the
U.S. Open record, but breaking
records isn't something our team is
focusing on right now. Basically, all
we are talking about is swimming fast
and scoring points."
Freshman Matt Nance handed the
Cardinal an eighth-place finish in the
400 1M with a time of 3:56.87.
To finish off the Cardinal's ac
complishments for the night, the
Stanford 400 freestyle relay team of
Bottom, Morales, Bodor and
Lundberg finished fourth with an un
expected time of 2:55.79.

"I still can't believe our 400
freestyle relay," Kenney said. "I
thought that if we had our last guy get
out of the pool and run on the deck
for the last leg, we could go a 2:56.00,
and then we ended up a 2:55.79, just
swimming."
The Cal team of Thomas
Ledjstrom, Michael Soderlund,
Bengt Baron and Matt Biondi won
the 400 relay with a record-setting
time of 2:53.15.
Following the Cardinal's outstand

ing performance Friday, Kenney had
nothing but high hopes for the final
day of competition.
"We have had the necessary mo
mentum since day one, and if we can
carry that over into the last day, we
have a strong chance of winning the
title," Kenney said. "If everyone
swims to their potential on our last
day, we will finally take home that
trophy."
As it turned out, not only did the
Cardinal swimmers perform to their

potential, but they swam beyond it,
winning three of the last day's events.
Kostoff started the team off on a
promising note, finishing fifth in the
1,650 freestyle (14:58.49) behind
champion Mike O'Brien of USC
(14:41.43).
In the next event. Murphy earned
the first NCAA title of his career as
he won the 200 backstroke in
1:46.29.
"With the title so close for us right
now, it is like finally seeing a light at

the end of the tunnel," Murphy said
after his victory. "That light is be
coming very clear and bright, and
with that shining in my mind, I can't
help but swim well."
Bottom finished fourth for the
Cardinal in same event with a time of
1:47.73.
Stanford went on to win the last
two individual events of the meet as
Moffet won the 200 breaststroke
(1:55.96) and Morales won the 200
butterfly in a record-breaking
1:42.85.
Morales' time, almost one second
faster than the previous record of
1:43.81, set new American, U.S.
Open and NCAA records.
Mosse finished third in the 200
butterfly (1:44.82) and Lundberg
finished 10th in the 200 breaststroke
(2:00.91).
Entering the final event, the 800
freestyle relay, Stanford held a lead
of more than 50 points. That did not
give David Louden, Bodor, Kostoff
and Bottom any reason to take it
easy, as they finished sixth with a time
of 6:34.75.
"I have been worried about our
freestyle relays since the start of this
season, but with the way they have
