# Dead to play Frost concerts
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
The Grateful Dead will perform
two concerts at Frost Amphitheatre
later this month, a development that
ends a month of speculation regard
ing an appearance here by the
popular rock group.
The Stanford Concert Network an
nounced late last quarter that the or
ganization had reached an agreement
with Bill Graham Presents, the Bay
Area's largest promoter, that would
bring a major concert here for the
first time in two years.
According to Derek Passarelli,
chairman of the Concert Network
Advisory Board, the Grateful Dead
will perform 2 p.m. concerts April 27
and 28 at Frost Ampitheatre.
Tickets for Stanford students will
probably be on sale at the Tresidder
Ticket Office April 11 and 12, and
will go on sale to the general public
April 14, Passarelli said. He said he
could not specify prices.
"We want to guarantee that stu
dents will have an opportunity for
tickets," Passarelli said, adding that
he had "little doubt" that the con
certs will sell out.
Danny Scher, a representative of
Bill Graham Presents, would not
comment on the specifics of the deal

between his organization and the
Concert Network. Bill Graham was
out of town and unavailable for com
ment at the time the announcement
was made.
"We agreed to terms that were
amenable to the Concert Network
and Bill Graham Presents," Passarelli
said, refusing to give any financial
details of the deal. "There's not too
much to tell you. . . . We're excited to
bring a concert to Stanford," he said.
Concert Network Director Aaron
Persky earlier had said that he was
seeking a high level of student in
volvement with the actual production
of the concert and was hoping for a
"reasonable return" from the event.
Passarelli added that another con
cert featuring contemporary jazz ar
tists from Windham Hill has also
been scheduled for Frost on May 18.
The controversy surrounding a
possible performance by the Grateful
Dead at the University began in late
February when Graham said Concert
Network opposition was the only ob
stacle blocking a Stanford concert by
the band. Graham charged at the
time that the student organization
showed "a seeming unwillingness to
be realistic" about booking well
known performers such as the Grate
ful Dead.
