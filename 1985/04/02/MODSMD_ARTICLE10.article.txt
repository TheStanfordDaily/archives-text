SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador â€”
President Jose Napoleon Duarte yes
terday claimed a landslide election
victory that would give his moderate
party control of the government for
the first time since he took office.
The results of Sunday's legislative
elections were a severe blow to the
rightists, who controlled the old Na
tional Assembly and had hamstrung
Duarte's policies. They had expected
to keep or increase the majority they
held in the assembly for the three
years of its existence.
Duarte told journalists yesterday
the apparent win by his Christian

Democrats represented "a stance of
the people against the far left and the
right." He said he would continue
seeking peace in the five-year-old
war with leftist guerrillas through
dialogues with the political right and
left and with the business community.
Official results from the Central
Elections Council are not expected
until later this week.
Although the president was not a
candidate, the election was widely
considered to be a referendum on his
first 10 months in office.
Christian Democrats said yesterday

that with 88.44 percent of the vote
tabulated, their figures gave them 33
seats and 25 to their main opposition,
a coalition of the far-right Republican
Nationalist Alliance, or ARENA,
and the conservative National Con
ciliation Party.
Duarte's party held 24 seats in the
old assembly, the rightists had 34 and
a small party not allied to either side
held the other two. The Christian
Democrats lacked the majority ne
cessary to enact legislation and the
rightists did not have the two-thirds
necessary to override a veto.
The Christian Democrats said their

figures showed them winning in 12 of
the country's 14 provinces, and the
rightists taking their traditional stron
gholds of Cabanas and Cuscatlan.
In Washington, State Department
spokesman Bernard Kalb said the
United States was "very pleased with
the preliminary report of what seems
to be heavy voter turnout in the face
of guerrilla harassment and obstruc
tion. For the fourth time in three
years, the Salvadoran people have
demonstrated at the polls their deter
mination to pursue a democratic solu
tion to their nation's problems and
their rejection of guerrillas."
