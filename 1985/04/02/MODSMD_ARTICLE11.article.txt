Institutional abuses told
WASHINGTON — Parents of patients at in
stitutions for the mentally disabled described
beatings and filthy surroundings yesterday as a
Senate panel reported fear, intimidation, vio
lence and secrecy at many such facilities.
"The self-serving actions of many states and
full retreat of the federal agencies has stifled the
screams and abandoned the ill," said Sen. Lowell
Weicker (R-Conn.), chairman of the Senate
Labor and Human Resources subcommittee on
the handicapped.
The panel released a report on a six-month in
vestigation into the treatment of patients at state
mental institutions. The report cited cases of
kicking or striking of patients, sexual advances
and rape, verbal threats of injury and other forms
of intimidation.
The subcommittee report said that in addition
to providing little treatment other than
prescribed medication, "many facilities visited by
Senate staff fail to maintain decent living condi
tions."
It criticized the Justice Department for failure

to take prompt action against unfit facilities un
der the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons
Act.
Hefner shows film
LOS ANGELES — Playboy magazine pub
lisher Hugh Hefner, saying he is 95 percent
recovered from a stroke, met the press yesterday
to show off a glossy nudity-filled documentary
movie on the life of slain Playmate Dorothy
Stratten.
Hefner said the movie — intended to counter
accusations by her former boyfriend, movie
director Peter Bogdanovich — proves that Strai
ten's last two years were "the happiest, most ful
filling and rewarding of her life because of
Playboy."
Bogdanovich, who wrote a book about Strat
ten entitled "The Death of The Unicorn:
Dorothy Stratten 1960-1980," claimed that Hef
ner's magazine and the Playboy lifestyle sexually
exploited her and he indirectly blamed Hefner
for her death.
Stratten's husband, Paul Snider, killed himself

and his 20-year-old wife in 1980, just as she was
achieving stardom. The gruesome murder with
sexual overtones followed Snider's discovery of
his wife's affair with Bogdanovich.
Doug Taylor, Bogdanovich's publicist, issued a
statement from the director after Hefner's news
conference.
"Hefner sells sexual lies every month," Bog
danovich said. "When he said Dorothy enjoyed
sex Playboy-style, it was a lie. When he said he
had no responsibility for her pornographic mur
der, it was a lie. Now he shows naked pictures to
prove she loved it when all it proves is how much
he exploited her."
Stocks surge quietly
The stock market staged a moderate advance
in quiet trading yesterday as investors studied
new evidence of a slowing economy.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
climbed 5.97 to 1,272.75.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
came to 89.90 million shares, down from 101.35
million Friday.
