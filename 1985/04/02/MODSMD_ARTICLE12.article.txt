Official sued for graft
SACRAMENTO — In a record $2.9 million
lawsuit yesterday, the state's political watchdog
agency accused Sacramento County Supervisor
William Bryan of 56 counts of conflict-of-interest
and financial disclosure violations.
"Supervisor Bryan has trampled on the Politi
cal Reform Act of 1974 to advance his personal
interests," Dan Stanford, chairman of the Fair
Political Practices Commission, said at a news
conference.
"In effect, the complaint alleges that Super
visor Bryan, by his conduct in office since 1981,
has used his position to gain preferential treat
ment, has voted in violation of the public's trust
and has intentionally concealed his conduct from
the public," he said.
Bryan, chairman of the Board of Supervisors,
was not in his office this week and was un
available for comment, his office said. A tele
phone number listed in his wife's name has been
disconnected, according to a recording.
Stanford said the suit, filed yesterday in
Sacramento County Superior Court, is seeking
the largest amount of civil damages in the 10-
year history of the FPPC.
The Political Reform Act, which the FPPC en
forces, requires state and local elected officials to
file a report each year listing all sources of
income, investments, loans and gifts. They arc
also required to abstain from voting on or par
ticipating in decisions that might affect those
sources, and they are required to report all cam
paign contributions and loans.
Viruses linked to cancer
SAN DIEGO — Viruses probably cause more
cancers than previously suspected, raising new
hope for developing vaccines to combat tumors,
the director of the National Cancer Institute said
yesterday.
"We're now back in the business of looking at
viruses as a cause of cancer," Dr. Vincent DeVita
said during the American Cancer Society's sci
ence writers' seminar.
"We've underestimated the role viruses play in
human cancer," he said. "We're probably going
to find a great deal more of these viruses that
cause human cancer."
The idea that viruses can cause human cancer
drew intense scientific interest in the late 1950s
and early 1960s after viruses were found respon
sible for cancers in animals, DeVita said. But the
concept faded when research efforts failed to es

tablish definite links with human tumors, he
added.
In the late 19705, however, the NCl's Dr.
Robert Gallo discovered a form of leukemia was
caused by a virus that invades human T cells —
white blood cells that are part of the body's
disease-fighting immune system, DeVita said.
Lottery head is in cards
SACRAMENTO — Michigan's lottery chief
said yesterday he is being considered for the job
directing the California games even though he
was overlooked at first by Gov. George Deuk
mejian's aides, who misplaced his application.
Michael Carr said in a telephone interview
with the Associated Press that the governor's
aides contacted him Friday and admitted they
had lost the application of the only lottery direc
tor to apply.
"I'm interested in at least discussing the situa
tion . . . and exploring whatever the possibilities
are in California... . We had a very general discus
sion. No job has been offered," Carr said.
Deukmejian, who believed Jhe had received no
applications from lottery directors, was supposed
to have appointed a California directer nearly
four months ago under the voter-approved lot
tery initiative.
The governor was forced last week to resume
looking for a lottery director when his top choice,
Massachusetts' assistant lottery director Thomas
O'Heir, turned down the California salary as too
low.
To prevent further delay in the start-up of the
games, Deukmejian appointed the chairman of
the policy-setting Lottery Commission, Howard
Varner, as interim director. Varner has tempo
rarily stepped down from his commission post.
Student fights hackers
CUPERTINO — A high school student has
been hired to help Hewlett-Packard fend off
computer hackers.
Everett Basham, 17, traces the roots of his
part-time security job with Hewlett-Packard to a
previous position he had managing a computer
bulletin board for hardware and software
retailers in the area.
That's when he met his first hacker. They ex
changed software and secrets, and Basham
learned the ins and outs of breaking into com
puters.
Now, he's putting the information to a legally

acceptable and profitable use — managing secur
ity for 12 Hewlett-Packard computers in the
Silicon Valley firm's marketing division.
So far, he has spurred the company to institute
a dial-back security system that programs com
puters to verify a user's identification before
calling the user at an approved phone number.
Basham, who hopes to get into Stanford's engi
neering program next year, admits it can be diffi
cult to get older employees to take him seriously.
"Some people feel a little bit resentful and in
timidated. But after they've seen what 1 can do,
they respect me for my knowledge of the com
puter system. Usually all it takes is my fixing their
broken terminal on a day when they are in a
hurry to get something done," he says.
Feinstein scolds cops
SAN FRANC ISCO — Mayor Dianne
Feinstein scolded the police department's top
brass in a summit meeting yesterday, but said she
still has "confidence" in Police Chief Cornelius
Murphy.
The mayor, who was angered by the recent
takeover of an empty elementary school class
room by armed police officers on a training exer
cise, says she plans to initiate reforms to improve
the screening process for recruits, cut down
brutality and tighten supervision of patrol offi
cers.
Murphy was called back from his vacation for
the hastily-called meeting, which included the
department s four deputy chiefs, three com
manders and 22 captains.
During the last year, the department has been
embarrassed by a police party at a restaurant
where officers paid a prostitute to perform oral
sex on an unwilling cadet; criticized for the arrest
of erotic film star Marilyn Chambers; and further
chided tor arresting a newspaper columnist who
was critical of the department.
I he mayor blamed the department's problems
on the command staff, which she says "has gotten
soft."
( on Murphy is about the best the department
produces. I think his directives have been good.
It's a problem inherent in the ranks," the mayor
said.

Official sued for graft
SACRAMENTO — In a record $2.9 million
lawsuit yesterday, the state's political watchdog
agency accused Sacramento County Supervisor
William Bryan of 56 counts of conflict-of-interest
and financial disclosure violations.
"Supervisor Bryan has trampled on the Politi
cal Reform Act of 1974 to advance his personal
interests," Dan Stanford, chairman of the Fair
Political Practices Commission, said at a news
conference.
"In effect, the complaint alleges that Super
visor Bryan, by his conduct in office since 1981,
has used his position to gain preferential treat
ment, has voted in violation of the public's trust
and has intentionally concealed his conduct from
the public," he said.
Bryan, chairman of the Board of Supervisors,
was not in his office this week and was un
available for comment, his office said. A tele
phone number listed in his wife's name has been
disconnected, according to a recording.
Stanford said the suit, filed yesterday in
Sacramento County Superior Court, is seeking
the largest amount of civil damages in the 10-
year history of the FPPC.
The Political Reform Act, which the FPPC en
forces, requires state and local elected officials to
file a report each year listing all sources of
income, investments, loans and gifts. They arc
also required to abstain from voting on or par
ticipating in decisions that might affect those
sources, and they are required to report all cam
paign contributions and loans.
Viruses linked to cancer
SAN DIEGO — Viruses probably cause more
cancers than previously suspected, raising new
hope for developing vaccines to combat tumors,
the director of the National Cancer Institute said
yesterday.
"We're now back in the business of looking at
viruses as a cause of cancer," Dr. Vincent DeVita
said during the American Cancer Society's sci
ence writers' seminar.
"We've underestimated the role viruses play in
human cancer," he said. "We're probably going
to find a great deal more of these viruses that
cause human cancer."
The idea that viruses can cause human cancer
drew intense scientific interest in the late 1950s
and early 1960s after viruses were found respon
sible for cancers in animals, DeVita said. But the
concept faded when research efforts failed to es

tablish definite links with human tumors, he
added.
In the late 19705, however, the NCl's Dr.
Robert Gallo discovered a form of leukemia was
caused by a virus that invades human T cells —
white blood cells that are part of the body's
disease-fighting immune system, DeVita said.
Lottery head is in cards
SACRAMENTO — Michigan's lottery chief
said yesterday he is being considered for the job
directing the California games even though he
was overlooked at first by Gov. George Deuk
mejian's aides, who misplaced his application.
Michael Carr said in a telephone interview
with the Associated Press that the governor's
aides contacted him Friday and admitted they
had lost the application of the only lottery direc
tor to apply.
"I'm interested in at least discussing the situa
tion . . . and exploring whatever the possibilities
are in California... . We had a very general discus
sion. No job has been offered," Carr said.
Deukmejian, who believed Jhe had received no
applications from lottery directors, was supposed
to have appointed a California directer nearly
four months ago under the voter-approved lot
tery initiative.
The governor was forced last week to resume
looking for a lottery director when his top choice,
Massachusetts' assistant lottery director Thomas
O'Heir, turned down the California salary as too
low.
To prevent further delay in the start-up of the
games, Deukmejian appointed the chairman of
the policy-setting Lottery Commission, Howard
Varner, as interim director. Varner has tempo
rarily stepped down from his commission post.
Student fights hackers
CUPERTINO — A high school student has
been hired to help Hewlett-Packard fend off
computer hackers.
Everett Basham, 17, traces the roots of his
part-time security job with Hewlett-Packard to a
previous position he had managing a computer
bulletin board for hardware and software
retailers in the area.
That's when he met his first hacker. They ex
changed software and secrets, and Basham
learned the ins and outs of breaking into com
puters.
Now, he's putting the information to a legally

acceptable and profitable use — managing secur
ity for 12 Hewlett-Packard computers in the
Silicon Valley firm's marketing division.
So far, he has spurred the company to institute
a dial-back security system that programs com
puters to verify a user's identification before
calling the user at an approved phone number.
Basham, who hopes to get into Stanford's engi
neering program next year, admits it can be diffi
cult to get older employees to take him seriously.
"Some people feel a little bit resentful and in
timidated. But after they've seen what 1 can do,
they respect me for my knowledge of the com
puter system. Usually all it takes is my fixing their
broken terminal on a day when they are in a
hurry to get something done," he says.
Feinstein scolds cops
SAN FRANC ISCO — Mayor Dianne
Feinstein scolded the police department's top
brass in a summit meeting yesterday, but said she
still has "confidence" in Police Chief Cornelius
Murphy.
The mayor, who was angered by the recent
takeover of an empty elementary school class
room by armed police officers on a training exer
cise, says she plans to initiate reforms to improve
the screening process for recruits, cut down
brutality and tighten supervision of patrol offi
cers.
Murphy was called back from his vacation for
the hastily-called meeting, which included the
department s four deputy chiefs, three com
manders and 22 captains.
During the last year, the department has been
embarrassed by a police party at a restaurant
where officers paid a prostitute to perform oral
sex on an unwilling cadet; criticized for the arrest
of erotic film star Marilyn Chambers; and further
chided tor arresting a newspaper columnist who
was critical of the department.
I he mayor blamed the department's problems
on the command staff, which she says "has gotten
soft."
