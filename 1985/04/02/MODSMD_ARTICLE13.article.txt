## Uncovering the mystery of Mayfield 
### 
Dear Bug Me:
Where was May field and why did it
disappear? - Buck Melton and Wayne
Sobon
I know about Mayberry with Aunt
Bea and Andy Griffith's homemade
justice, but I tend to think of
Mayfield as a street near the back of
the campus that looks like a kinked
demand curve. (Forgive me, I just
took an econ final.)
You're right, though: Mayfield did
once have more than an asphalt exis
tence. It was a miniscule little city
that was annexed, or rather en
veloped, by Palo Alto in 1925.
Its location is only slightly less mys
terious than that of Gilligan's Isle, the

place to where all lost pens migrate,
or the nearest gas station when your
tank hits empty.
According to Palo Alto and vicinity
directories from 1917 to 1925,
Mayfield was a residence and canning
center organized long before Palo
Alto, but it was bypassed with the
construction of the University and the
train station.
The directory said, in what I
thought was a very musty and condes
cending tone for an old phone book,
"Most of the people there are old res
idents or natives," although it did ad
mit that Mayfield had "a fair amount
of business."
Addresses of Mayfield residents in
dicated that they all lived in the area

of streets immediately south of
campus on both sides of El Camino
Real, the ones with names of differ
ent colleges.
In 1925, it combined with the Stan
ford community to add a capacity
bursting 4,000 residents to the Palo
Alto population figures.
But for those of us who still cherish
the memory of little Mayfield in our
hearts, there is the consolation of
Mayfield Avenue. Cheer up, B.M.
and W.S., if it wasn't for this long
gone community, Flo Mo might over
look Aunt Bea Boulevard, Lagunita
Loop might dead end at the lake, or
joggers might gallop down Don Ken
nedy Drive.
What's the oldest building on
campus today? - Alexander Niles, Jr.
If you're asking for University
buildings, I can give you the standard
tour-guide answer.
The cornerstone of the Inner Quad
was laid in 1887 and it was completed
by October of 1891, in time for the
opening-day ceremonies.
But the oldest remaining buildings
on campus are in Escondido Village.
They were built by Jean-Battiste
Paulin Caperon, a Frenchman who
changed his name to Peter Coutts
when he came to California and
bought a ranch.
And on his ranch he built some
buildings, eeyi-eeyi-o. The oldest, ac
cording to University archives, is Es
condite Cottage, which is now occu
pied by administrative offices for Es
condido Village. Others near there
are a small library and a buttery
which is now a faculty member's
residence.
The barn on Ouarry Road, which
houses a Wells Fargo branch and
other businesses, was a winery dating
from 1888.
The Stanfords didn't start buying

up land until 1876. Coutts' farm
became part of their purchases when
he left to return to France.
They didn't found the University
until 1885, 10 years after the house
that Peter built was constructed.
Dear Bug Me:
Why were the sundecks on my
Governor's Corner independent house
left unfinished? They were obviously
designed as sundecks, but they never
made it to be true sundecks in the final
outcome. Residents can't use them be
cause it will make the roof leak.
Also, because residents use the sun
decks anyhow, wouldn 'tit be wise to
put a real surface down on the deck so
leaking won't occur later? It would be
cheaper to fix it now than later, after

the water damage has occurred. - SRJ
I guess it's fitting to move from the
campus' oldest to its newest build
ings. The eight or nine "sundecks"
you are referring to are really just
"ornamental and aesthetic" flat
places, according to Glenn Carroll of
Operations and Maintenance.
They are edged by low stucco walls
and surfaced only with tar paper and
gravel coatings and don't sound too
conducive to decking some sun to me,
but Carroll agreed with you and said
that it's "hard to regulate student ex
uberance."
"The architect's office designed it
without knowing what typical stu
dents will do," he said, explaining
that these false decks are only acces

sible by windows, while there are
other sundecks available with normal
railings and doors and everything.
Carroll was very understanding; he
even said, "I can see students going
out there and taking a chair and
having a brewski."
But the problem is just as you put
it. The paper and gravel topping can
be punctured by chair legs, and then
water will get in and cause dry rot, ac
cording to Carroll.
There have been no student dama
ges so far, but he said it will just be a
matter of time. The only repair neces
sary came after a workman broke the
roofing mixture.
Whatever the cost of patching a
few rips, Carroll said the job of
resealing these areas into sundecks

would be much more expensive. He
couldn't even estimate the price, be
cause his office has no plans to do
that work.
I agree with you that the sundeck
space here at Stanford is very limited,
especially with spring quarter ap
proaching. Until University planners
come to their senses and convert
some parking lots into vital tanning
areas or rezone White Plaza from a
mall for the masses into sacred
ground for sun worshippers and ex
hibitionists, you'll just have to tread
lightly.
Maybe the mythical city of
Mayfield would be the ideal site for a
stadium-sized sundeck.

by October of 1891, in time for the
opening-day ceremonies.
But the oldest remaining buildings
on campus are in Escondido Village.
They were built by Jean-Battiste
Paulin Caperon, a Frenchman who
changed his name to Peter Coutts
when he came to California and
bought a ranch.
And on his ranch he built some
buildings, eeyi-eeyi-o. The oldest, ac
cording to University archives, is Es
condite Cottage, which is now occu
pied by administrative offices for Es
condido Village. Others near there
are a small library and a buttery
which is now a faculty member's
residence.
The barn on Ouarry Road, which
houses a Wells Fargo branch and
other businesses, was a winery dating
from 1888.
The Stanfords didn't start buying

up land until 1876. Coutts' farm
became part of their purchases when
he left to return to France.
They didn't found the University
until 1885, 10 years after the house
that Peter built was constructed.
Dear Bug Me:
Why were the sundecks on my
Governor's Corner independent house
left unfinished? They were obviously
designed as sundecks, but they never
made it to be true sundecks in the final
outcome. Residents can't use them be
cause it will make the roof leak.
Also, because residents use the sun
decks anyhow, wouldn 'tit be wise to
put a real surface down on the deck so
leaking won't occur later? It would be
cheaper to fix it now than later, after

the water damage has occurred. - SRJ
I guess it's fitting to move from the
campus' oldest to its newest build
ings. The eight or nine "sundecks"
you are referring to are really just
"ornamental and aesthetic" flat
places, according to Glenn Carroll of
Operations and Maintenance.
They are edged by low stucco walls
and surfaced only with tar paper and
gravel coatings and don't sound too
conducive to decking some sun to me,
but Carroll agreed with you and said
that it's "hard to regulate student ex
uberance."
"The architect's office designed it
without knowing what typical stu
dents will do," he said, explaining
that these false decks are only acces

sible by windows, while there are
other sundecks available with normal
railings and doors and everything.
Carroll was very understanding; he
even said, "I can see students going
out there and taking a chair and
having a brewski."
But the problem is just as you put
it. The paper and gravel topping can
be punctured by chair legs, and then
water will get in and cause dry rot, ac
cording to Carroll.
There have been no student dama
ges so far, but he said it will just be a
matter of time. The only repair neces
sary came after a workman broke the
roofing mixture.
Whatever the cost of patching a
few rips, Carroll said the job of
resealing these areas into sundecks

would be much more expensive. He
couldn't even estimate the price, be
cause his office has no plans to do
that work.
I agree with you that the sundeck
space here at Stanford is very limited,
especially with spring quarter ap
proaching. Until University planners
come to their senses and convert
some parking lots into vital tanning
areas or rezone White Plaza from a
mall for the masses into sacred
ground for sun worshippers and ex
hibitionists, you'll just have to tread
lightly.
Maybe the mythical city of
Mayfield would be the ideal site for a
stadium-sized sundeck.

Dear Bug Me:
Where was May field and why did it
disappear? - Buck Melton and Wayne
Sobon
I know about Mayberry with Aunt
Bea and Andy Griffith's homemade
justice, but I tend to think of
Mayfield as a street near the back of
the campus that looks like a kinked
demand curve. (Forgive me, I just
took an econ final.)
You're right, though: Mayfield did
once have more than an asphalt exis
tence. It was a miniscule little city
that was annexed, or rather en
veloped, by Palo Alto in 1925.
Its location is only slightly less mys
terious than that of Gilligan's Isle, the

place to where all lost pens migrate,
or the nearest gas station when your
tank hits empty.
According to Palo Alto and vicinity
directories from 1917 to 1925,
Mayfield was a residence and canning
center organized long before Palo
Alto, but it was bypassed with the
construction of the University and the
train station.
The directory said, in what I
thought was a very musty and condes
cending tone for an old phone book,
"Most of the people there are old res
idents or natives," although it did ad
mit that Mayfield had "a fair amount
of business."
Addresses of Mayfield residents in
dicated that they all lived in the area

of streets immediately south of
campus on both sides of El Camino
Real, the ones with names of differ
ent colleges.
In 1925, it combined with the Stan
ford community to add a capacity
bursting 4,000 residents to the Palo
Alto population figures.
But for those of us who still cherish
the memory of little Mayfield in our
hearts, there is the consolation of
Mayfield Avenue. Cheer up, B.M.
and W.S., if it wasn't for this long
gone community, Flo Mo might over
look Aunt Bea Boulevard, Lagunita
Loop might dead end at the lake, or
joggers might gallop down Don Ken
nedy Drive.
What's the oldest building on
campus today? - Alexander Niles, Jr.
