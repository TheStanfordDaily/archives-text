United Support Artists (USA) for Africa. If
you've heard the song produced by this group of
musicians, then you know the message is one of
giving. In just three weeks, this collective effort
has raised more than $10 million in famine relief
for victims of drought and hunger in East Africa.
Furthermore, the effort put forth by the music in
dustry has given impetus to i her relief efforts by
American athletes in pro f nal basketball and
football.
For many of us, the usical production by
U.S.A. for Africa is inspirational, serving as a
source of reaffirmation for our humanitarian con
cerns and efforts. Regardless of what we think of
the song itself, the initiative taken by this talented
and mixed bag of reru v r» ; ng artists must be
admired. We can only hope that the thoughtful
and giving spirit of U.S.A. for Africa will be em
ulated not only by athletes but also the televi
sion and commercial interests which depend so
heavily on these two forms of entertainment.

The music industry has shown by example just
what a positive role those with a little bit of initia
tive and talent can do to offer aid and support to
victims of world hunger. At Stanford, we are cer
tainly short of neither initiative nor talent. In fact,
initiative, talent and humanitarian concerns have
helped to make possible a conference on hunger
here next week. We encourage people in the
Stanford community to support this event and to
see if they can make a difference. The hunger
conference offers the Stanford community a spe
cial educational opportunity on a timely and cru
cial issue of our day.
It is important to realize that we make a differ
ence. On issues of local and world hunger (note
that a percentage of U.S.A. for Africa's earnings
will be aimed at fighting the problem of hunger
within our own country), the first necessary step
is to gain knowledge and insight into the causes of
these problems and then figure out ways we can
help to alleviate them.
