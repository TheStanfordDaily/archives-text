# Sandinistas threaten U.S. national security
## 
### 
During the 1984 presidential campaign, there was little
debate among the candidates over American opposition
to the Sandinista government of Nicaragua. Both Walter
Mondale and Ronald Reagan agreed on the need to con
tain the Marxist regime of Nicaraguan President Daniel
Ortega. The only debate was over what to do. Recent arti
cles in The Daily reveal that, here at Stanford, we're still
stuck in the first stage, debating the merits of the Sandi
nista government.
Few can dispute Nicaragua's bent to destabilize the
region. During the '84 campaign, Mondale advocated a
"quarantine" of Nicaragua should it continue to promote
insurgency in the region. Even before the election, liberal
members of the bipartisan Kissinger Commission on
Central America were stunned by the belligerence and ex
pansionist goals of the Sandinistas.
In private, leaders of the neighboring nations voice
fears of Nicaragua's military build-up. Nicaragua's current
army and militia of 100,000 is four times the size and
strength it was under Somoza. It is three times the size of
neighboring Honduras' military and more than double
that of El Salvador and Guatemala.
Since 1979, the Ortega regime has received from the
Soviet Union and Cuba $250 million in advanced offen
sive weapons: long-range artillery, heavy tanks and SAM-

7 missiles. The Soviet crates unloaded last fall on
Nicaragua's East coast, which raised concern in the
United States, contained not MiG jet fighters but 12 so
phisticated Mi-24 "Hind" helicopter gunships (the same
as those now used by the Soviets in Afghanistan, and con
sidered more effective in jungle fighting than MiG jets).
This military buildup began, not following the in
auguration of Reagan, but in 1979, while the United
States under President Carter extended to Nicaragua
generous aid, loans and debt refinancing.

A Marxist military government in Nicaragua threatens
the security of the United States as well as that of other
countries of the region. Those who doubt the threat of a
bellicose Nicaragua should recall former National Secur
ity Adviser McGeorge Bundy's comments on Cuba
preceeding the missile crisis: Soviet aid "is not going to
turn an island of six million people with five or six

thousand Soviet technicians and specialists into a major
threat to the United States." Currently an estimated
8,000 Cuban specialists and 3,000 Cuban military ad
visers, in addition to Palestinian Liberation Organization
and Libyan agents, assist the Ortega regime.
Antonio Farach, a recently defected Nicaraguan
diplomat, told a U.S. Senate subcommittee of Nicaraguan
drug smuggling to the United States, engineered by
Cuban advisers. Farach stated that Cubans "do not sug
gest in Nicaragua, they order in Nicaragua."
Marxist promises of plenty — food, education, medical
care — are appealing to Nicaraguans who bear a legacy of
extreme poverty. The tragic reality is that Marxism does
not work. The Nicaraguan economy is in shambles.
Under the Sandinistas, the national external debt has
doubled. More than 50 percent of the Sandinista budget
supports a massive military buildup, diverting already
meager resources from a stagnant economy. Essential
goods and food are in short supply. Real wages are lower
now than under Somoza. The government's minimum
wage provides a purchasing power of 8 cents per day (a
tube of tooth paste, when available, costs the equivalent
of seven days labor).
Sandinista claims of a 50 percent drop in illiteracy are
tarnished by the fact of complete press censorship and
educational control. Those who hold up Cuba as an exam
ple of Third World development under communism may
not know that after 25 years of Castro, fully one-third of
Cuba's GNP is Soviet aid (equivalent to a $1 trillion an
nual gift to the U.S.). China and the Soviet Union now
feed their people, but at the cost of millions dead.
Many opponents of contra aid point to an apparent lack
of popular resistance to the Sandinista government. In

cipient opposition is hard to pinpoint. In Nicaragua,
evidence of opposition is only now beginning to leak out.
Youths and their parents now openly rebel against a
mandatory draft. In Nagarote recently, 800 mothers of
Nicaraguan draftees stormed a training camp in protest.
Internal opposition is actively muzzled by complete cen
sorship and imprisonment. Catholic church activities are
routinely restricted.
Five dissident priests were recently expelled from
Nicaragua. Nearly six years after the revolution which
promised democratic reform, only a facade of pluralism
exists. U.S. congressional observers agreed that recent
Nicaraguan presidential elections were a sham. Opposi
tion parties were effectively denied participation.
Americas Watch latest report cited increased human
rights violations by the Sandinistas. At an open-air mass
during the pope s trip to Managua, John Paul II
responded to orchestrated chants from Nicaraguan sol
diers of "Long live Marx and the revolution!" with the
plea "Long live the Miskito indians!"
More than 20,000 Sumo and Miskito indians have fled
from continued Sandinista persecution to Honduras.
More than 100,000 peasants have been forcibly relocated
from northern rural areas to central towns to create a
"free-fire zone" against the contras. It has the added ef
fect of de-populating areas of contra support.
There has been much criticism of contra methods and
leadership. It is true that many "Somocistas" — former
officers in Somoza's national guard — now direct, with
CIA backing, the Nicaraguan Democratic Front (FDN).
It is also true, however, that two-thirds of the original
Sandinista junta have left in opposition. Many of them are
now leading contra groups. These include: Eden Pastora,
who turned the tide of the Sandinista revolution by
leading the daring assault on Somoza's palace, and Al
fonso Callejas, who now directs contra operations in
southern Nicaragua.
Joining them are long-time anti-Somoza leaders Pedro
Chamorro, former editor of La Prensa, the sole opposi
tion paper; Aldolfo Calero, imprisoned by Somoza for op
position activities; and Arturo Cruz.
Americans find it distasteful to support less-than
pristine movements which don't conform to our under
standing of human rights. Contra methods directed at dis
rupting popular support for the Sandinistas are no more
harsh than those used by the Sandinistas to gain and, now,
to maintain power.
We cannot, however, wash our hands of the contras,
waiting for an opposition movement more to our liking.
Nor can we afford to wait for inchoate popular opposition
to the Sandinistas to become obvious. It may not.

Totalitarian governments are efficient at effacing opposi
tion.
We cannot tolerate a Marxist-Leninist Nicaragua,
militarized and bellicose, fomenting revolution in the
region by Soviet-Cuban proxy. It is naive to expect the
Ortega regime to agree to military reductions, to removal
of all foreign advisers and to guarantees of discontinued
support for the Salvadoran guerrillas and return to demo
cratic principles of government, as requested by the Con
tadora group. The record of communist guarantees of
democratic reform shows only examples of deceit and
subjugation: in Eastern Europe, Vietnam, Cuba.

U.S. policy in Nicaragua must be one of pressure with
the purpose of reforming the Ortega regime. To cut aid to
the contras makes certain a future need for more drastic
American involvement. An unchecked Sandinista regime
will stir chaos in the region and suffering amongst the
Nicaraguan people.
Nicaragua is a thorn in America's side. It will only work
its way inward if left untreated.
If America intends to guarantee the security of its own
backyard from communist insurgency, it must prepare for
a long and costly struggle. Continued aid to the contras to
prevent consolidation of the Marxist government is the
first step. The second step is to approach the region with
an agenda of economic and social development as out
lined by the Kissinger Commission. Both steps require
gutsy leadership but offer the best hope for peace in
Central America.

During the 1984 presidential campaign, there was little
debate among the candidates over American opposition
to the Sandinista government of Nicaragua. Both Walter
Mondale and Ronald Reagan agreed on the need to con
tain the Marxist regime of Nicaraguan President Daniel
Ortega. The only debate was over what to do. Recent arti
cles in The Daily reveal that, here at Stanford, we're still
stuck in the first stage, debating the merits of the Sandi
nista government.
Few can dispute Nicaragua's bent to destabilize the
region. During the '84 campaign, Mondale advocated a
"quarantine" of Nicaragua should it continue to promote
insurgency in the region. Even before the election, liberal
members of the bipartisan Kissinger Commission on
Central America were stunned by the belligerence and ex
pansionist goals of the Sandinistas.
In private, leaders of the neighboring nations voice
fears of Nicaragua's military build-up. Nicaragua's current
army and militia of 100,000 is four times the size and
strength it was under Somoza. It is three times the size of
neighboring Honduras' military and more than double
that of El Salvador and Guatemala.
Since 1979, the Ortega regime has received from the
Soviet Union and Cuba $250 million in advanced offen
sive weapons: long-range artillery, heavy tanks and SAM-

The tragic reality is that
Marxism does not work.
The Nicaraguan economy is

7 missiles. The Soviet crates unloaded last fall on
Nicaragua's East coast, which raised concern in the
United States, contained not MiG jet fighters but 12 so
phisticated Mi-24 "Hind" helicopter gunships (the same
as those now used by the Soviets in Afghanistan, and con
sidered more effective in jungle fighting than MiG jets).
This military buildup began, not following the in
auguration of Reagan, but in 1979, while the United
States under President Carter extended to Nicaragua
generous aid, loans and debt refinancing.

A Marxist military government in Nicaragua threatens
the security of the United States as well as that of other
countries of the region. Those who doubt the threat of a
bellicose Nicaragua should recall former National Secur
ity Adviser McGeorge Bundy's comments on Cuba
preceeding the missile crisis: Soviet aid "is not going to
turn an island of six million people with five or six

thousand Soviet technicians and specialists into a major
threat to the United States." Currently an estimated
8,000 Cuban specialists and 3,000 Cuban military ad
visers, in addition to Palestinian Liberation Organization
and Libyan agents, assist the Ortega regime.
Antonio Farach, a recently defected Nicaraguan
diplomat, told a U.S. Senate subcommittee of Nicaraguan
drug smuggling to the United States, engineered by
Cuban advisers. Farach stated that Cubans "do not sug
gest in Nicaragua, they order in Nicaragua."
Marxist promises of plenty — food, education, medical
care — are appealing to Nicaraguans who bear a legacy of
extreme poverty. The tragic reality is that Marxism does
not work. The Nicaraguan economy is in shambles.
Under the Sandinistas, the national external debt has
doubled. More than 50 percent of the Sandinista budget
supports a massive military buildup, diverting already
meager resources from a stagnant economy. Essential
goods and food are in short supply. Real wages are lower
now than under Somoza. The government's minimum
wage provides a purchasing power of 8 cents per day (a
tube of tooth paste, when available, costs the equivalent
of seven days labor).
Sandinista claims of a 50 percent drop in illiteracy are
tarnished by the fact of complete press censorship and
educational control. Those who hold up Cuba as an exam
ple of Third World development under communism may
not know that after 25 years of Castro, fully one-third of
Cuba's GNP is Soviet aid (equivalent to a $1 trillion an
nual gift to the U.S.). China and the Soviet Union now
feed their people, but at the cost of millions dead.
Many opponents of contra aid point to an apparent lack
of popular resistance to the Sandinista government. In

cipient opposition is hard to pinpoint. In Nicaragua,
evidence of opposition is only now beginning to leak out.
Youths and their parents now openly rebel against a
mandatory draft. In Nagarote recently, 800 mothers of
Nicaraguan draftees stormed a training camp in protest.
Internal opposition is actively muzzled by complete cen
sorship and imprisonment. Catholic church activities are
routinely restricted.
Five dissident priests were recently expelled from
Nicaragua. Nearly six years after the revolution which
promised democratic reform, only a facade of pluralism
exists. U.S. congressional observers agreed that recent
Nicaraguan presidential elections were a sham. Opposi
tion parties were effectively denied participation.
Americas Watch latest report cited increased human
rights violations by the Sandinistas. At an open-air mass
during the pope s trip to Managua, John Paul II
responded to orchestrated chants from Nicaraguan sol
diers of "Long live Marx and the revolution!" with the
plea "Long live the Miskito indians!"
More than 20,000 Sumo and Miskito indians have fled
from continued Sandinista persecution to Honduras.
More than 100,000 peasants have been forcibly relocated
from northern rural areas to central towns to create a
"free-fire zone" against the contras. It has the added ef
fect of de-populating areas of contra support.
There has been much criticism of contra methods and
leadership. It is true that many "Somocistas" — former
officers in Somoza's national guard — now direct, with
CIA backing, the Nicaraguan Democratic Front (FDN).
It is also true, however, that two-thirds of the original
Sandinista junta have left in opposition. Many of them are
now leading contra groups. These include: Eden Pastora,
who turned the tide of the Sandinista revolution by
leading the daring assault on Somoza's palace, and Al
fonso Callejas, who now directs contra operations in
southern Nicaragua.
Joining them are long-time anti-Somoza leaders Pedro
Chamorro, former editor of La Prensa, the sole opposi
tion paper; Aldolfo Calero, imprisoned by Somoza for op
position activities; and Arturo Cruz.
Americans find it distasteful to support less-than
pristine movements which don't conform to our under
standing of human rights. Contra methods directed at dis
rupting popular support for the Sandinistas are no more
harsh than those used by the Sandinistas to gain and, now,
to maintain power.
We cannot, however, wash our hands of the contras,
waiting for an opposition movement more to our liking.
Nor can we afford to wait for inchoate popular opposition
to the Sandinistas to become obvious. It may not.

Totalitarian governments are efficient at effacing opposi
tion.
We cannot tolerate a Marxist-Leninist Nicaragua,
militarized and bellicose, fomenting revolution in the
region by Soviet-Cuban proxy. It is naive to expect the
Ortega regime to agree to military reductions, to removal
of all foreign advisers and to guarantees of discontinued
support for the Salvadoran guerrillas and return to demo
cratic principles of government, as requested by the Con
tadora group. The record of communist guarantees of
democratic reform shows only examples of deceit and
subjugation: in Eastern Europe, Vietnam, Cuba.
