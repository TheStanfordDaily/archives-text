## The
						Irish goose and the Texan gander 
### 
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
remarkably successful visit to Washington to mark
the 2()()th anniversary of Anglo-American
diplomatic relations had a triple significance. It was
evidence that the American colonial revolt against
Europe is over, as relations between Spain and
Spanish America and those between Portugal and
Brazil also show. In these days of air travel which

links, rather than the oceans which separate, the
old saying "blood is thicker than water" should be
changed to read "oxygen circulates through the ar
teries."
The second point is that Thatcher is no longer
singing just a duet with Reagan. She has been
joined by a choir of NATO leaders in which,
surprisingly. Francois Mitterrand of France has
become the heldentenor. Only Andreas
Papandreou of Greece has not joined the chorus;
he seems to prefer the non-church Slavonic music.
Even the left has dropped its sneering remarks
about the cowboy who made second-rate movies.
The Soviet media have given up that cliche they
once overused; the Kremlin realizes that Reagan
must be taken very, very seriously. This does not
mean that his policies are right. It does indicate
that, to use Joe McGinniss' title. Reagan has done a
remarkable job in "The Selling of the Presidency."
The third point was Thatcher's expression of
gratitude to the Irish government for taking
decisive action against the IRA. Meanwhile,
outside Congress, there were the usual demonstra
tions by the fringe of Irish-Americans who promote
the civil war in Ireland, risking the lives of innocent
Irish people, but not their own. Responsible Irish-
American leaders lament this, but, since large eth
nic groups have a fissiparous effect on our commu
nity and a divisive power in our nation, politicians
do not rebuke them with the severity they merit.
The leaders of the pro-terrorist groups are either
ignorant or dangerous, since the aim of the IRA
and of Moscow is to establish a Cuba off the coast
of Western Europe.
Some Irish leaders, like Lenin Prize-winning
Moscow favorite Sean Macßride. make statements
in comparison with which the utterances of
Papandreou are innocuous, but they are not sub
jected to vocal censure, as Papandreou is, by U.S.

politicians. Irish neutrality in World War II
resulted in the loss of many Allied lives, but
Reagan has never raised the issue, nor have other
Irish-American politicians. The time has come to
break this conspiracy of silence. If Ireland wishes to
enjoy the benefits of belonging to the Western
community, it must share the burdens and join
NATO.
The Economist recently ran a survey of Irish-
American backing for Irish terrorists, illustrated
with a photograph of a billboard demanding an end
to the use of plastic bullets (so that the IRA can use
its real bullets with more impunity).
This survey mentioned a wealthy Texan business
man, who clearly does not realize that what is
sauce for the Irish goose is sauce for the Texan
gander. St. Patrick's Day and anti-British
demonstrations here are largely a pretext for
romantic boisterousness, but Mexican resentment

about the annexation of Texas, the Southwest and
California goes much deeper. The Soviet aim is to
promote revolution in Central America and then
play on this resentment in Mexico to make it a basis
for anti-American activity.
Those who recall the lovely Beirut of the old
days could not imagine that it would be destroyed
by terrorists. Don't say it could not happen to
prosperous Texas. What will the Irish-Americans
of Texas and, incidentally, San Francisco do when
the cry rises for them to go home?
And this brings us to the language question,
which is dynamite in many countries. A country
divided linguistically is weakened in every sense —
politically, militarily, and economically. The so
called "Hispanics" in the United States used to
seek assimilation, including linguistic. Now we have
reverse discimination.
Accusations of racism are hurled freely at main
stream Americans, but the Hispanics boast about
"la raza." It is one thing to use Spanish while trying
to learn English, but it quite another to resist the
English language, as many Hispanics do, at the

same time as they claim the right to vote. There is a
complex of rackets by people who get money or
votes by segregating the Hispanics. In San Fran
cisco, the Hispanics stage demonstrations which
show their loyalty is still to their countries of origin.
Rep. Norman Shumway of Stockton has
reintroduced the English Language Amendment in
the 99th Congress, with two important statements
on the divisive effects of bilingualism. A recent poll
shows that the amendment has substantial support
in California, although California congressmen
who play up to the Hispanic vote are trying to
thwart the will of the majority with every trick at
their command. Former California Sen. S.I.
Hayakawa's U.S. English movement makes it clear
that the enemies of bilingualism, far from being
opposed to the study of foreign languages, actively
support it.
Shumway's bill has widespread support in
Congress and, indeed, among many ethnic groups.
At least 33 ethnic organizations have officially en
dorsed the English Language Amendment, but
conspicuously absent is any Hispanic group.
The opposition in Congress is led by another
California congressman, Don Edwards, who seems
determined to block Shumway's resolution in the
interest of his own Hispanic machine. That is a
reprehensible abuse of representative government.
Let him feel free to vote against the resolution, but
let him not use legislative tricks to block the opera
tion of Congress. Too much is at stake.
And now, back to the Texan goose, or geese,
who, says one reference work, "protect farms with
their watchdog-like behavior. They hiss menacingly
and honk loudly whenever strangers appear."
After all. it was such geese who once saved Rome.
So Texans, including that foolish Irish-American
businessman, listen to your geese.
And, Reagan, since you have enough clout to
push the MX through Congress, tell Ireland to join
NATO and place some missiles there, instead of
complaining that Belgium and the Netherlands
have not shown appropriate willingness. And, New
York City Mayor Ed Koch, stop parading on St.
Patrick's Day with a shillelagh to get the Irish vote.
Unfortunately, we live in the age of the MX and the
cruise missile, not the shillelagh.
