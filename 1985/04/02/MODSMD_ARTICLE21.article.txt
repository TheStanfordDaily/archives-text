## Card nine travels to SJSU 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
After a spring break plagued by rainouts, the
Stanford baseball team begins its spring quarter
schedule today with a 2:30 p.m. contest at San Jose
State.
The Cardinal managed only a 2-2 record during
the vacation, but the two wins were important ones
— a doubleheader sweep of Six-Pac opponent
Arizona. Three non-conference games were can
celled due to rain, and a fourth — a 4-2 loss to UC-
Santa Barbara — was shortened to six innings by
the weather.
In the three games against Arizona, Stanford
scored an amazing 38 runs. "We hit well as a team
the whole time," Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
said. "It was a real good trip for us, especially right
after finals."
However, Marquess is worried that the forced
layoff may result in rustiness. "For three weeks, we
haven't played very much," he said. "It's a concern,
but you can't control the weather."

"Ideally, we'd have liked to play three or four
more ballgames," Marquess said. "It's just some
thing we'll have to live with.'*
According to Marquess, playing during the break
is hard regardless of the weather. "It's difficult,
sure it is," he said. "That's why we scheduled two
down there with Santa Barbara. We also had a fun
day with the alumni game on Saturday." The cur
rent team won that one 11-2.
The Spartans, who were swept by the Cardinal in
a three-game series in February, had a 14-19
record before yesterday's game with Pacific.
However, they are second in the Pacific Coast Ath
letic Association with an 8-7 mark — three games
behind Fresno State.
San Jose State has been led by third baseman
Steve Ochoa, who is hitting .380 in conference
play. Ochoa has been PCAA Player of the Week
twice this season.
1 erry Conway, who hit two homers against Stan
ford in the previous series, leads the team in that

department with seven. The Spartans' most consis
tent hitter has been Mark Saucedo, who has hit
safely in 28 of 33 games and had a 21-game hitting
streak broken on Saturday against UC-Irvine.
Marquess expects the Spartans to be ready to
avenge the three early losses. "They've played real
well lately," Marquess said. "They always play us
tough down there."
The last time the two teams met in San Jose
Municipal Stadium, Rob Wassenaar was the one
who was tough. The sophomore righthander
dazzled the Spartans with a one-hit shutout.
Jack McDowell will start for Stanford, but will
only throw about four or five innings to prepare for
this weekend's crucial series with California. He
will be followed by Lee Plemel and Rick Dietz.
As is usual in non-conference games, San Jose
State will not start one of its top pitchers in today's
game. The Spartans will probably use one of their
freshman hurlers, who have been ineffective so far
this year. The lone exception is Anthony Telford,
who is 4-3 with five saves.

Designated hitter Mike Deßenon and the other Cardinal hitters haven't
gotten many swings in during a rainy spring break, but they travel to
San Jose State today to face the Spartans in a non-conference game.
