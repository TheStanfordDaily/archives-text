# Villanova stuns Hoyas to win NCAA title
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter With wire reports 
The Villanova basketball team did the unspeakable, the
unthinkable and what many thought was the undoable last
night. It beat Georgetown, 66-64, to win the NCAA
Championship in Lexington, Ky.
The game was played on April Fools' Day, but Vil
lanova's victory was no joke. The 25-10 Wildcats tried on
Cinderella's slipper, it fit, they wore it, and then they
proceeded to pull off what many are calling the biggest
upset in NCAA tournament history.
Villanova Coach Rollie Massamino and his Wildcats

figuratively told Georgetown Coach John Thompson and
his Hoyas to take their secluded hotels, their militaristic
approach to basketball, their two regular-season victories
over the Wildcats and their 1984 NCAA championship
trophy — and shove it.
"No one thought that we could do it," an ecstatic Mas
samino said after the game. "But I did."
Villanova, which entered the 64-team tournament un
ranked and seeded eighth in the Southeast Region, played
the only game it could to beat the Hoyas. The perfect one.
The Wildcats shot an almost incomprehensible 79 per
cent from the floor — an NCAA tournament record —
while keeping Georgetown's Ail-American center Patrick
Ewing under wraps and off the boards. Villanova took a
29-28 lead into the lockerroom at halftime and then held
on for dear life in the second half.
Villanova moved to 53-48 lead with 5:56 to go, but
after Thompson called a timeout, the Hoyas ran off six
unanswered points to lead by one, 54-53. Villanova cen
ter Ed Pinckney missed from close range, and George
town had the ball back. The Hoyas immediately went into
a four-corners delay game, but seconds later turned the
ball over.
Massamino called a timeout with 3:25 remaining and
set up his offense, and with 2:31 left, the Wildcats' Harold
Jensen hit a wide-open 20 footer from the right side.

From there on in, Villanova shot free throws and shot
them well.
Jensen and Dwayne McClain each went 4-for-5 from
the line down the stretch, while Pickney was 2-for-2 and
Harold Pressley l-for-2 to ice the victory. Meanwhile, a
frustrated Georgetown team, faced with the prospect of
not repeating as national champs,'missed shot after shot at
the other end.
"I just attribute this to hard work," said Wildcat guard
Gary McLain, one of three starting seniors along with
Pinckney and McClain. "We worked so hard this season.
No one in America knows that Villanova worked so hard.
This is what happens when you work as hard as we did."
Four players scored in double figures to lead the
Wildcats. McClain led all scorers with 17 points and
Pinckney, the tournament Most Valuable Player, had 16.
Jensen came off the bench to hit all five of his shots and
finished with 14, while Pressley added 11.
Four Hoyas also scored in double figures. David

Wingate had 16, Ewing 14, and Reggie Williams and Bill
Martin 10 apiece.
The loss broke a 17-game win streak for Georgetown
and lowered its final record to 35-3. It also prevented the
Hoyas from becoming only the seventh team and the first
since UCLA in 1973 to win back-to-back national cham
pionships.
"We might not have won the game, but I still think
we're No. 1," Ewing said.
"They won the game, and they get the national champi
onship," teammate Michael Jackson said. "We still feel
good about ourselves. We're still the No. 1 team in the na
tion."
The Wildcats, on the other hand, became one of the few
teams to win the NCAA title with 10 or more losses.
Many compared their victory last night to North Carolina
State's two years ago, when the Wolfpack shocked the
Akeem Olajuwon-led Houston Cougars in the NCAA
final.

As in North Carolina State's victory in 1983, there was
plenty of emotion after the game.
There was McLain, who walked around the court
during the net-cutting ceremonies with the trophy crushed
to his chest, singing, "We are No. 1. Oh, my god, we are
No. 1."
There was McClain, who was asked for a one-word
summation of his feelings with the game ball and his
championship watch in hand. "Awesome, he said.
"That's the same way everyone described Georgetown."
There was Jake Nevin, the Wildcats' trainer for the past
56 years. Nevin, a victim of Lou Gehrig's disease, sat in
his wheelchair with the victory net draped around his
neck.
And then there was Al Severence, who coached Vil
-1 a nova to the Final Four in 1939. Severence died early
yesterday in his Lexington hotel room, and the Villanova
players dedicated the game to him.

Gary McLain, one of three starting seniors along with
Pinckney and McClain. "We worked so hard this season.
No one in America knows that Villanova worked so hard.
This is what happens when you work as hard as we did."
Four players scored in double figures to lead the
Wildcats. McClain led all scorers with 17 points and
Pinckney, the tournament Most Valuable Player, had 16.
Jensen came off the bench to hit all five of his shots and
finished with 14, while Pressley added 11.
Four Hoyas also scored in double figures. David

Wingate had 16, Ewing 14, and Reggie Williams and Bill
Martin 10 apiece.
The loss broke a 17-game win streak for Georgetown
and lowered its final record to 35-3. It also prevented the
Hoyas from becoming only the seventh team and the first
since UCLA in 1973 to win back-to-back national cham
pionships.
"We might not have won the game, but I still think
we're No. 1," Ewing said.
"They won the game, and they get the national champi
onship," teammate Michael Jackson said. "We still feel
good about ourselves. We're still the No. 1 team in the na
tion."
The Wildcats, on the other hand, became one of the few
teams to win the NCAA title with 10 or more losses.
Many compared their victory last night to North Carolina
State's two years ago, when the Wolfpack shocked the
Akeem Olajuwon-led Houston Cougars in the NCAA
final.

As in North Carolina State's victory in 1983, there was
plenty of emotion after the game.
There was McLain, who walked around the court
during the net-cutting ceremonies with the trophy crushed
to his chest, singing, "We are No. 1. Oh, my god, we are
No. 1."
There was McClain, who was asked for a one-word
summation of his feelings with the game ball and his
championship watch in hand. "Awesome, he said.
"That's the same way everyone described Georgetown."
There was Jake Nevin, the Wildcats' trainer for the past
56 years. Nevin, a victim of Lou Gehrig's disease, sat in
his wheelchair with the victory net draped around his
neck.
And then there was Al Severence, who coached Vil
-1 a nova to the Final Four in 1939. Severence died early
yesterday in his Lexington hotel room, and the Villanova
players dedicated the game to him.
