# Card golfers in Santa Cruz for Far West Intercollegiate
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff sportswriter 
Following a less than auspicious
beginning of the spring season last
week, the Stanford men golfers will
be aiming to sharpen their games as
they start play today in the three-day
Far West Intercollegiate at Santa
Cruz.
The Cardinal men, according to
Coach Tim Schaaf, have played with
enormous consistency throughout the
season and have been ranked as
highly as No. 2 on the West Coast.
They took a step backward, however,
at the Fresno Pepsi Classic last week,
finishing 14th out of 20 teams.

Prior to the Fresno tournament,
the Cardinal had finished no worse
than sixth in any tournament.
Schaaf views the Far West Intercol
legiate as a "very important tourna
ment for us." According to Schaaf,
the tournament carries a lot of pres
tige because of the excellent field it
attracts.
Also, following a dismal perfor
mance against many of its Western
counterparts at Fresno, the Cardinal
needs to have a solid showing
throughout April with the Pac-10
Championships less than a month
away.
"We've played very well this year

up until the last two tournaments,
where we played very poorly," Schaaf
said.
After this week's tournament in
Santa Cruz, the Cardinal men return
home to host the Stanford U.S. Inter
collegiate April 13-14 on the Stan
ford golf course.
The spring season is important to
the Stanford team, and it also
represents the last opportunity for in
dividual golfers to impress the col
legiate golf world in their quests for
All-America honors.
The Cardinal's Tim Robinson is in
solid position to make second team
All-America, Schaaf said.
