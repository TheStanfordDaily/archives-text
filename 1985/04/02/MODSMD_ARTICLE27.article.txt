## Photo exhibit strong, diverse 
### LEE CLINE 
Eight prominent women photog
raphers have been brought together
in a new exhibit, "A Women's
Show," at Palo Alto's Photographers
Gallery. It is, on the whole, a strong
exhibit, and the works are pleasantly
diverse, ranging from the almost
shocking surrealism of Judy Dater's
black-and-white self-portraits to the
colorful, subtly textured minimalism
of Linda Heiliger's architectural pho
tography.
Most of the women are from the
Bay Area, with the exception of Edna
Bullock from Carmel and Betty
Hahn from New Mexico. "I think
each artist has a very definite thing to
say," said photographer Margo
Davis, one of the artists whose work
is shown. "Each does it in her own
way," and Davis agrees with gallery
owner Amy Sarat that "they are all
equally strong." Although each artist
has her moments, there are undoubt
edly those who are stronger than
others.
Nina Glaser concentrates on the
nude figure, posed in metaphoric

configurations, or encased in plaster,
that are intended to shock the viewer.
Whether the work actually succeeds
is questionable. "The work in general
is supposed to make people question
things, think, rather than give tham
answers." She explained why she
chooses to work with nudes: "I'm
trying to strip people from in
dividuality to make a statement about
humanity rather than the era or the
person photographed. I'm trying to
make a timeless statement; that's why
the heads are turned away. You don't
think about the subject — you think
about yourself." Unfortnately, most
of the model's positions seem to be a
little too deliberate, a little too
pushed, and vaguely trite. The plaster
cast idea has been done before.
Edna Bullock has photographed
the nude male for this show, her most
effective works having her model
pose among sand dunes. "I just think
that it's time that someone
photographs the male in nature
rather than making him a — you
know — 'macho' symbol. He is as
much nature as a woman is," she said.

Bullock only began to seriously
photograph in 1976, a year after her
husband passed away. Since then, she
has worked on landscapes, seascapes,
the female and the male figure. She
said that she used to teach dancing,
which has given her the sense of
"feeling toward motion in photogra
phy." That motion is unquestionably
brought into her works with her use
of the sand and in two instances
makes a strong visual contrast with
her male model.
Maria Patterson's work here is
flowers, taken at a very close perspec
tive, concentrating on fields of rich,
subtly changing color and simple
shape, all visually exquisite. Patterson
obtained her bachelor's degree at
Stanford in Philosophy, but after
graduating, she spent a year working
in the Stanford libraries, not knowing
where she was going to go next,
feeling, in her words, like a "lost
soul". She ultimately decided to go to
the California School of Fine Arts, in
itially aiming at commercial art.
"I took photography as a play
course, but within six weeks, I knew
photography was it," Patterson said.
"Photography seemed really
honest," she continued. "I love the
integrity of the people doing it. And it
was undiscovered at the time. This
was 1956. We were crusaders then."
Patterson was aware that being a
woman could possibly hurt her, but
she became friends with Ansel
Adams, and he instilled confidence in
her. "Ansel said we really need a
woman's point of view. ... He was
very supportive. Ansel recognized my
vision that my family could not un
derstand," she said.
Regarding her subject matter, Pat
terson said, "I've always loved na
ture. I've always been a sort of
recluse. ... I like beauty, simplicity.
This is not a world that honors that."
Patterson claimed that her philoso
phy background has been very impor
tant to her in helping her organize her
thoughts on being an artist, which at
times has been difficult.
"You have to be honest with your
self," Patterson said. "Do what your
heart tells you. ( You just can't play

anyone else's game."
Other artists include Betty Hahn,
who focuses on lush flora in dusty
colors, and Lisa Toby, who deals with
rural chapparal landscapes. What
makes her work especially intriguing
is that she hand-colors most of her
work over black and white prints.
This gives her the opportunity to
bring out, for example, the vintage
truck from the backdrop of an old
barn, by coloring it a bright red.
Margo Davis is currently lecturing
at Stanford on photojournalism with
the Communications Department.
Her work may well be some of the
best of the entire show. Most of her
photographs are from a recent series
taken in Europe. She works primarily

on portraits of everyday people in
everyday situations, which gave her
displays an unassuming, subtle air.
Each work gently flatters its subject's
character, be it by emphasizing a
child's playful stance, or the curve of
a woman's face, resting on her arm
next to an ivory statue of a thin,
graceful cat.
One of Davis' most pleasant works
is a photograph of an unmade bed in
the corner of a room filled with large
floral wallpaper. The light is diffused;
the mood is gentle; the work is appro
priately titled "Morning Adagio"
(adagio is a slow movement in
music). What is remarkable about
this work is that Davis has the ability
to evoke the same intensity of emo

tion out of an inanimate object that
she can out of a portrait. The center
piece of the entire gallery is a work
from her African series, done in
1980-1983, that will be taken to the
Smithsonian Institution in November.
The photograph is a very large, ex
quisitely executed portrait of an
African woman, "Ladi." The texture
of her skin is beautifully emphasised
with the size of the work.
On the whole, the exhibit is a
plesant surprise, and the positive
works definitely merit a viewing. "A
Women's Show" continues through
April 20 at the Photographers
Gallery, 540 Raroona St., open 11-6
Tuesday through Friday and 12-5
Saturdays.


"Morning Adagio," by Margo Davis, was shot in Lagrasse, France and
is currently on exhibit at Palo Alto's Photograhers Gallery.

character, be it by emphasizing a
child's playful stance, or the curve of
a woman's face, resting on her arm
next to an ivory statue of a thin,
graceful cat.
One of Davis' most pleasant works
is a photograph of an unmade bed in
the corner of a room filled with large
floral wallpaper. The light is diffused;
the mood is gentle; the work is appro
priately titled "Morning Adagio"
(adagio is a slow movement in
music). What is remarkable about
this work is that Davis has the ability
to evoke the same intensity of emo

tion out of an inanimate object that
she can out of a portrait. The center
piece of the entire gallery is a work
from her African series, done in
1980-1983, that will be taken to the
Smithsonian Institution in November.
The photograph is a very large, ex
quisitely executed portrait of an
African woman, "Ladi." The texture
of her skin is beautifully emphasised
with the size of the work.
On the whole, the exhibit is a
plesant surprise, and the positive
works definitely merit a viewing. "A
Women's Show" continues through
April 20 at the Photographers
Gallery, 540 Raroona St., open 11-6
Tuesday through Friday and 12-5
Saturdays.


"Morning Adagio," by Margo Davis, was shot in Lagrasse, France and
is currently on exhibit at Palo Alto's Photograhers Gallery.


Among the works at the Photographers Gallery is this portrait by Margo Davis, shot in Bourgogne, France,
Davis is one of the eight prominent women photographers featured in "A Women's Show" which ruiv
through April 20 in Palo Alto.
Eight prominent women photog
raphers have been brought together
in a new exhibit, "A Women's
Show," at Palo Alto's Photographers
Gallery. It is, on the whole, a strong
exhibit, and the works are pleasantly
diverse, ranging from the almost
shocking surrealism of Judy Dater's
black-and-white self-portraits to the
colorful, subtly textured minimalism
of Linda Heiliger's architectural pho
tography.
Most of the women are from the
Bay Area, with the exception of Edna
Bullock from Carmel and Betty
Hahn from New Mexico. "I think
each artist has a very definite thing to
say," said photographer Margo
Davis, one of the artists whose work
is shown. "Each does it in her own
way," and Davis agrees with gallery
owner Amy Sarat that "they are all
equally strong." Although each artist
has her moments, there are undoubt
edly those who are stronger than
others.
Nina Glaser concentrates on the
nude figure, posed in metaphoric

configurations, or encased in plaster,
that are intended to shock the viewer.
Whether the work actually succeeds
is questionable. "The work in general
is supposed to make people question
things, think, rather than give tham
answers." She explained why she
chooses to work with nudes: "I'm
trying to strip people from in
dividuality to make a statement about
humanity rather than the era or the
person photographed. I'm trying to
make a timeless statement; that's why
the heads are turned away. You don't
think about the subject — you think
about yourself." Unfortnately, most
of the model's positions seem to be a
little too deliberate, a little too
pushed, and vaguely trite. The plaster
cast idea has been done before.
Edna Bullock has photographed
the nude male for this show, her most
effective works having her model
pose among sand dunes. "I just think
that it's time that someone
photographs the male in nature
rather than making him a — you
know — 'macho' symbol. He is as
much nature as a woman is," she said.

Bullock only began to seriously
photograph in 1976, a year after her
husband passed away. Since then, she
has worked on landscapes, seascapes,
the female and the male figure. She
said that she used to teach dancing,
which has given her the sense of
"feeling toward motion in photogra
phy." That motion is unquestionably
brought into her works with her use
of the sand and in two instances
makes a strong visual contrast with
her male model.
Maria Patterson's work here is
flowers, taken at a very close perspec
tive, concentrating on fields of rich,
subtly changing color and simple
shape, all visually exquisite. Patterson
obtained her bachelor's degree at
Stanford in Philosophy, but after
graduating, she spent a year working
in the Stanford libraries, not knowing
where she was going to go next,
feeling, in her words, like a "lost
soul". She ultimately decided to go to
the California School of Fine Arts, in
itially aiming at commercial art.
"I took photography as a play
course, but within six weeks, I knew
photography was it," Patterson said.
"Photography seemed really
honest," she continued. "I love the
integrity of the people doing it. And it
was undiscovered at the time. This
was 1956. We were crusaders then."
Patterson was aware that being a
woman could possibly hurt her, but
she became friends with Ansel
Adams, and he instilled confidence in
her. "Ansel said we really need a
woman's point of view. ... He was
very supportive. Ansel recognized my
vision that my family could not un
derstand," she said.
Regarding her subject matter, Pat
terson said, "I've always loved na
ture. I've always been a sort of
recluse. ... I like beauty, simplicity.
This is not a world that honors that."
Patterson claimed that her philoso
phy background has been very impor
tant to her in helping her organize her
thoughts on being an artist, which at
times has been difficult.
"You have to be honest with your
self," Patterson said. "Do what your
heart tells you. ( You just can't play

anyone else's game."
Other artists include Betty Hahn,
who focuses on lush flora in dusty
colors, and Lisa Toby, who deals with
rural chapparal landscapes. What
makes her work especially intriguing
is that she hand-colors most of her
work over black and white prints.
This gives her the opportunity to
bring out, for example, the vintage
truck from the backdrop of an old
barn, by coloring it a bright red.
Margo Davis is currently lecturing
at Stanford on photojournalism with
the Communications Department.
Her work may well be some of the
best of the entire show. Most of her
photographs are from a recent series
taken in Europe. She works primarily

on portraits of everyday people in
everyday situations, which gave her
displays an unassuming, subtle air.
Each work gently flatters its subject's
character, be it by emphasizing a
child's playful stance, or the curve of
a woman's face, resting on her arm
next to an ivory statue of a thin,
graceful cat.
