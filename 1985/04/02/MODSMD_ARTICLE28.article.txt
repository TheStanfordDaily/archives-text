## Shepard's 'Angel City' lacks creativity 'Angel City' attempts to expose the corruption in Hollywood's movie industry but fails to be insightful 
### NANCY HENRY 
Sam Shepard's "Angel City"
premiered at the Magic Theatre in
1976. Since that time, Shepard has
written a number of truly superior
plays, among them "Buried Child"
(for which he won the Pulitzer Prize),
"True West" and "Fool for Love."
The question is why the Magic has
chosen to revive the confusing, im
mature (in light of Shepard's later
plays), and questionably relevant
"Angel City." A press release from
the theater claims that the play
coincides with a common theme of its
other productions this season. That
theme is supposedly myth, appear
ance and dreams versus reality in
modern society. "Angel City" ex
amines the illusory world of Holly
wood filmmaking. It is based on the
playwright's own experiences in Los
Angeles, and attacks the unreality of
the industry and its products with the
energy such a critique requires. In
this case, however, what lacks is
creativity and original insight. A
saving grace might have been wit and
humor, but somehow the lack of sub
tly or truly effective comic techniques
renders this play disappointingly hard
to enjoy.
The idea of a fusion between
movies and life, a clouding of the
boundaries between fact and fantasy
that we in the video age are so sus
ceptible to, is a common and impor
tant one. Woody Allen examines it in
a much funnier and revealing fashion
is his recent "Purple Rose of Cairo."
Last quarter the Drama Department
at Stanford offered a more dramati
cally satisfying, if confused, treatment
in "A Movie Star has to Star in Black
and White." The people in these

productions are human, believable,
and therefore the tragedies which
befall them due to their form of es
capism have a much greater impact
on the audience. Characters in
"Angel City" are not supposed to be
real; they are stereotypes, but even
stereotypes can be developed to a

point of endearment; here, this is
simply not done.
Rabbit, played competently if
rather uninterestingly by Bill Talen, is
the innocent victim of the savage
Hollywood jungle. He is Shepard.
who comes to the City of Dreams
with serious artistic ambitions and

principles, only to encounter the
human zombies who inhabit the over
powering Angel City. Roger Nieboer
gives perhaps the most humorous and
the most forceful performance as
Tympani, the musician, who has
searched in vain for the perfect
melody ever since he, like Rabbit, first

came to this town. Now his obsession
knows no bounds and his vision
exceeds none. He, like the hopelessly
hollow-headed Miss Scoons, made
appropriately and thus ridiculously
shallow by actress Maureen McVerry,
lives for nothing but the movies. The
"heavies" in the picture, for the

whole play is loosely unified by a
1930's gangster/detective motif, are
the executives of the studio. By the
second act, one of them. Wheeler, has
degenerated (along with the play)
into a sniveling Mr. Hyde-type mon
ster who is choking in this metaphori
cally stagnant environment. Morgan
Upton has little to do except rave and
cough in this role, and even that is not
done in a manner worthy of comic
note. Terry Lamb plays an amusing,
slick promotional operator in the first
scene but unfortunately does not
return to redeem the second. These
characters must be difficult to invest
with much life or appeal, and cer
tainly no one in this production
transcends his or her part.
The play is classified as surreal, ex
plaining its lack of unity and some
what bizarre qualities. The intermit
tent use of a saxophone, the interven
ing strains of reality blocked out by
the other characters, is a forshadow
ing of a Shepard technique greatly
improved in later plays. The set is im
pressive and indeed surrealistic â€” a
neon frame representing the movie
screen into which characters periodi
cally step to recite lines indicative of
their general condition as victims of
the cinematic phenomenon. The play
is even attempting social criticism. No
doubt the movie industry is seductive,
corruptive and false, but most of us
know that by now, and is there not
more to say beyond this obvious
point? If "Angel City" does say
more, it is well hidden in a generally
muddled, not particulary entertaining
script and production. "Angel City"
runs through April 28 at the Magic
Theatre in San Francisco.


Terry Lamb (Lanx), Maureen McVerry (Miss Scoons) and Bill Talen
(Rabbit) are some of the main players in Sam Shepard's "Angel City,"

which plays at the Magic's Southside Theatre through April 28. The
play is drawn from Shepard's own experiences in Tinsel Town.
