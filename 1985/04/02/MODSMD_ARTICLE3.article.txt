# Bathroom sex warning
## GLAS, police work together to decrease incidents 
### DAVID RISSER Senior staff writer 
The Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford has posted
flyers in campus men's restrooms warning that the Stan
ford Police Department is monitoring sexual activities in
the restrooms and "will begin making arrests if such activ
ity does not cease."
An undercover operation in March 1980 resulted in 10
arrests in University restrooms — seven in the Cummings
Art Building, two in the Cubberley Education Building
and one at the Sunken Diamond. University students
were on spring vacation at the time and only two of those
arrested were students here. Others included men from as
far away as San Francisco and San Jose.
"GLAS strongly urges all concerned individuals to take
these facts under consideration and modify their behavior
appropriately," the flyer reads.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington acknowl
edged that his department is again looking into the activ
ity "in response to a number of complaints, particularly in
Green Library, Cubberley and the men's room outside in
the Quad." The department's first measure was to deter
mine that "yes, indeed, there is that activity going on," he
said.
"It has gotten to a point where it's not just people who
know each other. .. . They're harassing other people,"

Herrington stated. "In some eases, the bathroom was
even locked from the inside."
Those apprehended may be charged with soliciting or
engaging in lewd conduct, but are usually charged with

loitering near a public toilet with lewd intent, a law cur
rently being disputed in California courts. The law has
been declared unconstitutional in San Diego and is under
review in Santa Clara County, according to David Cuff, a
GLAS Steering Committee spokesperson. The flyer
states, "GLAS does not approve of police intervention in

such cases."
"The law they are charging people
with is in some question. Who decides
that — standing around with lewd in
tent. Straight people could be impl
icated," Cuff said.
Herrington stressed it is unlikely
that members of GLAS are involved
in the alleged illegal sexual activity
and solicitation. "It is usually
homosexuals who are still in the
closet who are doing this," he said.
The GLAS notice warns that the
names, addresses and places of em
ployment of those arrested in 1980
were published by local and national
news media.
"A lot of the people who engage in
this 'tea room' activity are fairly
repressed because of the society we
live in, and that's the way they choose
to vent their sexuality. The result of
convictions is so monumental to their

lifestyle that it is not the proper way
to deal with the problem.
According to Cuff, the manner in
which GLAS is handling the problem
is "about the best way." The flyer
lists phone numbers of local and na
tional groups offering legal, informa
tional, counseling and referral
services.
Herrington called the posting of
notices by GLAS "a good first step."
"We asked [GLAS] to put out the
notices to discourage the activity. If
that doesn't work, we'll start making
arrests."
Herrington noted that the same ap
proach, including warning posters
from GLAS, has worked before,
causing the activity to diminish with
out arrests. " I'm hoping it will work
this time," he said.
Herrington will send undercover
officers to the bathrooms "from time
to time" to investigate the degree of
sexual activity and will ask those who
complained if the problem has been
alleviated.
