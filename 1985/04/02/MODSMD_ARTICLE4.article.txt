## 
### DAVID S. GOLDSTEIN Staff writer 
A graduate- student filed a $3.5 .
million lawsuit in Superior Court
March 16 against the San Francisco
Police Department and the district at
torney's office, claiming he was
wrongfully arrested last fall in con
nection with a San Francisco murder.
Francisco Alarcon, 31,.a San Fran
cisco resident and a graduate student
in the Spanish and Portugese De
partment, spent six days in jail last
September on unrelated charges of
child molestation, oral copulation
with minors and providing marijuana
to minors, that were later dismissed
when a witness failed to appear in
court. Alarcon was never charged
with the murder of 15-year-old
Theodore Gomez, who was found
stabbed in Golden Gate Park Sept.
22. Another man has confessed to
that crime.
Police said they found evidence

supporting the sex and drug charges
while investigating the murder.
w "The police Â«c4ed unprofes-
said Tony Tamburello,
Alarcon's attorney. He said the police
prematurely "threw Francisco's name
out as a prime suspect" in the murder
without having probable cause that
he committed the crime.
The suit also alleges professional
misconduct by the district attorney's
office, invasion of privacy for releas
ing information before Alarcon was
arrested or charged and intentional
infliction of emotional distress. The
suit seeks $3.5 million in damages
and an injunction restraining authori
ties from disclosing the identity of in
dividuals suspected of a crime unless
there is probable cause for issuing an
arrest warrant.
Officer Carri Lucas of the San
Francisco Police Department's public
affairs office said the department

does not comment on cases in litiga
tion.
Deputy District Attorney William
Fazio, one of ihe"cJetendants in the
suit, said he has handed his defense to
the city attorney's office and has no
comment.
Tamburello said he believed he
would win the suit, adding that he
didn't take on cases merely "for fun."
"1 think it's a valid case," he said.
"We're filing this suit not so much
for the money but because we want to
fight for the principle," Alarcon said
in an earlier interview. "This never
should have happened and we want
to be sure that it never happens
again."
Tamburello said asking for $3.5
million damages "lets people know
it's serious," and is a "valid impetus
to make sure people (San Francisco
police and the district attorney's of
fice) change."

"The man (Alarcon) has gone
through hell and back," he said.
Tamburello said Alarcon's worries
did not end when charges against him"
were dropped Oct. 16. Alarcon may
be arrested on those charges again if
the missing witness reappears, but
"he's prepared to defend himself' if
necessary, Tamburello said.
Alarcon also had to interrupt his
studies for six months. A poet and a
doctoral candidate in the Spanish and
Portuguese department, he is writing
a dissertation on the contemporary
Mexican short story.
Tamburello said the police depart
ment and the district attorney's office
may have had racial motivation for
their actions, although "not necessar
ily consciously." Alarcon, who is
Hispanic, said earlier that "if I'd been
a white student living in Palo Alto, I
don't think they would have done it
(mistreated him)."
