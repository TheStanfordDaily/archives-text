# Lawsuit draws government reply
## Justice Department lawyers defend launch on warning 
### DAVIDS. GOLDSTEIN Staff writer 
Justice Department lawyers, acting on behalf of
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, last
Monday filed their response to a lawsuit appeal
made by a Stanford computer specialist.
Clifford Johnson, an employee of the Univer
sity's Information Technology Services, said the
government failed to address the central issue of his
suit: that allowing computers to launch a nuclear
attack is unconstitutional.
"They don't address my allegations," Johnson
said.
The Justice Department's brief, filed with the 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco,
argued that federal courts have no right to decide

the legality of launch on warning capability
(LOWC).
Johnson said the government ignored his charge
that allowing a computer to launch automatically a
nuclear attack is unconstitutional because only the
president may launch an attack and he cannot dele
gate that decision.
The government's brief said that LOWC involves
U.S. foreign policy, which is "the province of the
executive and legislative branches of the federal
government, under the political question doctrine,"
and courts cannot intercede except under certain
circumstances that do not include Johnson's case.
"It's a repeat of their'political issue' " which the
government argued when the case was first heard

last year when a federal court found in the govern
ment's favor, Johnson said. But the presiding judge
suggested that Johnson appeal the case, which he is
doing.
Johnson claims the government ignored the main
thrust of his argument. He is preparing a response
to the government's brief, which he expects to file
within two weeks. A judge will then decide if the
case merits an oral hearing.
"No one believes the court will take the issue ter
ribly seriously," Johnson said, adding that he
believes the probability of winning the case is low.
But he said the case, which he is conducting on his
own time and at his own expense without an attor
ney, is picking up support as it attracts publicity.
"It's been a slow growth process," Johnson said.
