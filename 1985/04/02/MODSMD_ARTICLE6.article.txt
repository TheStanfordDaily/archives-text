Many Stanford students took a
stoic attitude toward paying large
sums of money to the University
and the bookstore yesterday, but
four first-year graduate students
hoped to turn a profit off registra
tion day by buying back bookstore
receipts and offering ID card
lamination.
Mark Soane, one of the four
entrepreneurs and the originator
of the whole project, conceived of
the lamination service when he
first registered at Stanford this fall.
By late afternoon, however, the
lamination project had collected
about $300 and vvas "not quite
breaking even," Soane said. "I
thought there was more of a
need," he said.

As Soane and co-worker Dennis
Dunn continued to hawk their ser
vice, colleagues Tim Brazy and
Dan Lyons tried to buy back
receipts at a booth conveniently
placed immediately in front of the
Stanford Bookstore.

will offer a rebate of 10 to 15 per

annual rebate, the duo was offer

said. Some students "need the cash
now," he added.
Once Soane came up the with the
idea, the group "evaluated the mar

ministration," Lyons said.
Although Brazy and Lyons did at
tract customers through offers of im
mediate cash, they were careful to in
form customers that the bookstore
usually pays a higher rebate in Octo
ber and that the booth was not an of
ficial arm of the bookstore. "It's just
a secondary market for book
receipts," Brazy said.
Considering the "time value" of
money, the bookstore must pay a
rebate of between 9 and 10 percent
for the entrepreneurs to turn a profit
when they receive cash for the
receipts in October, Lyons said.
