# Freshman dies unexpectedly
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Staff writer 
An 18-year-old Stanford freshman was
found dead in his Larkin room yesterday
morning, shocking residents of the Stern
Hall house as they returned from spring
break.
The student was identified by Stanford
police as Michael Bandy of Tulare, a small
town south of Fresno.
Police Chief Marvin Herrington told the
University News Service that police
responded to the call at 10:54 a.m.
"We do not know what the cause of death
was at this point." Herrington said. "There
were no obvious wounds."
Herrington added that the student had
apparently been dead "for some time"
before his roommate tried to wake him yes
terday morning. There were no signs of foul
play or any indications of suicide.
The Santa Clara County Coroner's Office

was notified and removed the body about 1
p.m. A Coroner's Office staff member told
The Daily that an autopsy was completed
yesterday, but the cause of death is listed as
"pending." More conclusive results will be
availible in five to six weeks when lab tests
arc completed, the official said.
Director of the Row Diana Conklin was
one of the first University officials at the
scene, arriving around 11:30 a.m. after
being called by Norm Robinson, associate
dean of student affairs for residential educa
tion. Robinson, Conklin and Alice Supton.
assistant dean of residential education, were
all eventually present at the scene.
Conklin recounted the series of events in
an interview last night.
Conklin said Bandy's parents apparently
dropped him off at the dorm about 3:30
p.m. Sunday afternoon, "fine, happy, and
laughing."
"He was found by his roommate who

went to wake him up because it was late in
the morning, and then realized that he
wasn't going to be able to wake him," Con
klin said. "The police were [on the scene]
within moments."
Conklin said that detectives thoroughly
examined the room and that there are "still
a lot of unanswered questions."
Stunned house residents were made
aware of all these events at a private dorm
meeting last night, Conklin said.
"The reason we called the meeting was
that not everybody was back to the dorm
when this happened," Conklin said. "We
thought it was a good idea to call everyone
together to make sure everyone had the
same information and give them as much in
formation as we knew as of 7 p.m."
At the meeting were Bruce and Mary
Rosenstock, Larkin resident fellows. Harvey

Coroners remove the body of freshman Mike Bandy from Stern Mall yesterday morning.
The cause of death has not been determined, officials said.

klin, representing the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Office, and Dean of the
Chapel Robert Hammerton-Kelly.
"1 gave the information I had,"
Conklin said, "and then Harvey
(Weinstein) talked about how people
respond to a death like this and how
unaccustomed most people are at this
age to losing someone close to them
and the stages they can expect to go
through."
Conklin said the meeting was
relatively short "because there wasn't
much to say."
Although there were few ques
tions, Conklin said that one student
did ask why it took so long to notify
Bandy's parents. She explained that
the University and local police had
difficulty finding them.
Conklin explained that the message

j
the family had at that time was only
that Bandy had been involved in "an
accident." Conklin personally
notified Bandy's parents of their son's
death at about 6 p.m..

Funeral and memorial serviee ar
rangements are incomplete at this
time because of these circumstances.
"We're waiting until the parents
are in a position to think about that,"
Conklin said. "Generally we would
ask them if they would like a
memorial serv ice here, and if they say
*no,' then my next question would be
'Do you mind if the students have
one?'
Larkin residents talked quietly
among themselves throughout the
day, grieving the loss of a popular,
well-liked resident.
Bandy was a pre-med student and
worked in the University's psychol
ogy lab. He was also active in last
fall's presidential election when he
worked for the Mondale/Ferraro
campaign.
"Apparently Mike comes from a
very close family," Conklin added.
"He was well known, respected and
loved. Everyone who has learned of
the death is completely puzzled and
baffled bv it."
