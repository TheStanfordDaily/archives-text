### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Staff writer 
An 18-year-old Stanford freshman was
found dead in his Larkin room yesterday
morning, shocking residents of the Stern
Hall house as they returned from spring
break.
The student was identified by Stanford
police as Michael Bandy of Tulare, a small
town south of Fresno.
Police Chief Marvin Herrington told the
University News Service that police
responded to the call at 10:54 a.m.
"We do not know what the cause of death
was at this point." Herrington said. "There
were no obvious wounds."
Herrington added that the student had
apparently been dead "for some time"
before his roommate tried to wake him yes
terday morning. There were no signs of foul
play or any indications of suicide.
The Santa Clara County Coroner's Office

was notified and removed the body about 1
p.m. A Coroner's Office staff member told
The Daily that an autopsy was completed
yesterday, but the cause of death is listed as
"pending." More conclusive results will be
availible in five to six weeks when lab tests
arc completed, the official said.
Director of the Row Diana Conklin was
one of the first University officials at the
scene, arriving around 11:30 a.m. after
being called by Norm Robinson, associate
dean of student affairs for residential educa
tion. Robinson, Conklin and Alice Supton.
assistant dean of residential education, were
all eventually present at the scene.
Conklin recounted the series of events in
an interview last night.
Conklin said Bandy's parents apparently
dropped him off at the dorm about 3:30
p.m. Sunday afternoon, "fine, happy, and
laughing."
"He was found by his roommate who

went to wake him up because it was late in
the morning, and then realized that he
wasn't going to be able to wake him," Con
klin said. "The police were [on the scene]
within moments."
Conklin said that detectives thoroughly
examined the room and that there are "still
a lot of unanswered questions."
Stunned house residents were made
aware of all these events at a private dorm
meeting last night, Conklin said.
"The reason we called the meeting was
that not everybody was back to the dorm
when this happened," Conklin said. "We
thought it was a good idea to call everyone
together to make sure everyone had the
same information and give them as much in
formation as we knew as of 7 p.m."
At the meeting were Bruce and Mary
Rosenstock, Larkin resident fellows. Harvey
