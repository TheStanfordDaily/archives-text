Syria intervenes in Lebanese war
BEIRUT'— Syria intervened diplomatically yesterday to try to help
end the Moslem-Christian battling around Lebanon's port of Sidon. At
least 40 people have been killed in four days of fighting.
Maj. Gen. Mohammed Kholi, Syria's national security adviser, held
five hours of talks with Lebanon's Christian president, Amin Gemayel,
and Rashid Karami, the Sunni Moslem prime minister.
"We have discussed the (Sidon) events and ways of facing all even
tualities," Karami told reporters. "We as a government are determined
to shoulder our responsibility in safeguarding the citizens as well as the
nation against any harm."
Asked whether the government would send reinforcements to Sidon's
army garrison, he said: "The equipment available is on the way."
Besides the Christian-Moslem fighting, there has been a recent rash of
kidnapping of Westerners. Reporting on one of the cases, a Christian
radio station said yesterday that a shepherd had found the body of a
Dutch priest in a ravine. The Rev. Nicolas Kluiters had been last seen
nearly three weeks ago and was presumed kidnapped.
There was no immediate word on how or when he was killed.
Kluiters, a Roman Catholic priest, disappeared while traveling in the
Bekaa Valley, an area of Syrian troop deployment in eastern Lebanon.
In Sidon, heavy fighting resumed at sundown yesterday, breaking a
nine-hour lull, journalists there reported.
Moslem militiamen and Palestinian guerrillas in the city's two refugee
camps were firing mortars and rockets at units of the Lebanese Forces
Christian militia on the eastern hills, the journalists said.
They reported seven civilians were wounded. Shells slammed into the
harbor and three commercial ships sailed out to escape the fire, they
said.
At the United Nations, the 10 nations that contribute a total of 5,000
soldiers to a U.N. peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon pledged their
continued support on condition that Israel and Lebanon cooperate in
making the region secure.
Shiite hijacker surrenders
JIDDA, Saudi Arabia — A hijacker who commandeered a Middle
East Airlines jet yesterday and demanded millions of dollars for one of
Lebanon's Moslem militias surrendered peacefully when the plane
landed in Jidda.
Airport officials said all of the 65 other passengers and 10 crew mem
bers were freed unharmed. The hijacker, who officials said was armed
with a pistol and a hand grenade, seized control of the Boeing 707
during a flight from Beirut, the Lebanese capital, to Jidda.
One Jidda airport official said that when word of the hijacking was
received here and the plane entered Saudi air space, the pilot was told,
"Go away, as it will never be allowed to land at any Saudi airport."
He said the plane circled the airport, with the control tower refusing
landing permission, but, "Subsequently, the pilot told the control tower
that the hijacker was willing to give himself up and end the hijacking.
And the Saudi authorities at once said the plane could land."
Lebanon's state radio quoted the jetliner's co-pilot, Omar Atshan, as
saying during the takeover that "the hijacker has no violent intentions.
His only aim is to support the 'National Resistance' in the south."
Beirut radio stations said the hijacker belonged to the National Resis
tance Movement, one of the Shiite Moslem militia groups battling Israeli
occupation forces in southern Lebanon.
Beirut airport officials said they believed the hijacker was Ali Kes
rouwani, an employee of Middle East Airlines that is Lebanon's national
carrier.
The Voice of Lebanon radio station in Beirut said the hijacker was a
member of the Kesrouwani family from the Shiite village of Ankoun in
south Lebanon, which was shelled by the Israelis on March 21 during an
anti-guerrilla sweep.
Taiwan hotel blaze kills 24
TAIPEI, Taiwan — A fire broke out yesterday in a hotel restaurant
following an argument between customers and waiters, killing at least 24
people and injuring nine, police reported.
Policewoman Chang Fu-mei, speaking by telephone from Tainan, 187
miles south of Taipei, said authorities were investigating reports the fire
at the Di Wong Hotel may have resulted from arson.
She said the fire started in the hotel's first-floor restaurant after a bit
ter argument between several customers and waiters.
She said there were reports someone then poured gasoline in the res
taurant and started the fire. It was not known who exactly had poured
the gasoline nor was it clear what caused the argument, she said.
The fire, which spread rapidly through the seven-story hotel, was ex
tinguished two hours later.
Ms. Chang said most of the dead were burned beyond recognition and
firemen were searching the debris for other possible victims. She said all
the victims were Taiwanese.
Bhopal plant leaks gas again
NEW DELHI, India — Gas leaked yesterday from the Union Carbide
plant in Bhopal, sending residents fleeing from the area in panic, the
United News of India reported today. No casualties were reported.
Residents were quoted as saying the gas smelled like chlorine.
More than 2,000 people were killed and 200,000 injured when methyl
isocyanate gas leaked from the plant on Dec. 3. It was the world's worst
industrial accident.
UNI, in a report from Bhopal, said the gas leaked from the plant Sun
day night and this morning, causing panic in the slum areas near the fac
tory.
Similar gas also leaked from the plant last Thursday, the agency said.
The report said neither the Madhya Pradesh state government nor
Union Carbide would comment on the reported new leak.
The factory was shut down by the state government after the Decem
ber tragedy. It has since been under the control of India's Central
Bureau of Investigation.
Doe survives killing try
MONROVIA, Liberia — Liberian leader Samuel Doe said assassins
led by the deputy chief of his personal guard poured machine-gun fire
into his jeep yesterday in an attempt to kill him. Doe said the vehicle
rammed into a lamp post, but he escaped injury.
The official government news agency said Col. Moses Flanzamaton
fled after the attack early yesterday and security forces were searching
for him.
Doe said two bodyguards traveling with him in the jeep were wounded
in the attack, which occurred on the grounds of the presidential mansion
as they returned from a weekend outing. The news agency said it
received an account of the attack from Doe as he was telling his minis
ters about it.
Doe has made many accusations of plots against him since he seized
power in April 1980, but this was the first report of an attempt on his
life.
Common Market outlook improves
BRUSSELS, Belgium — The road ahead for the Common Market,
Western Europe's often-hobbled econmic club, suddenly looks smooth
er.
The most dangerous banier facing the 10-nation bloc — divisions
over making members of Spain and Portugal — was overcome last week
after more than six years of bargaining, including a final round that
lasted nearly 90 hours.
This deal, coupled with a settlement Saturday of Greek demands for
more money, capped a 12-month series of successes that may represent
one of the crucial transition periods in the Common Market's 28-year
iife.
"Now the field is wide open for the future," said Jacques Delors. the
former French finance minister who three months ago took over as pres
ident of the Common Market's executive commission.

Bhopal plant leaks gas again
NEW DELHI, India — Gas leaked yesterday from the Union Carbide
plant in Bhopal, sending residents fleeing from the area in panic, the
United News of India reported today. No casualties were reported.
Residents were quoted as saying the gas smelled like chlorine.
More than 2,000 people were killed and 200,000 injured when methyl
isocyanate gas leaked from the plant on Dec. 3. It was the world's worst
industrial accident.
UNI, in a report from Bhopal, said the gas leaked from the plant Sun
day night and this morning, causing panic in the slum areas near the fac
tory.
Similar gas also leaked from the plant last Thursday, the agency said.
The report said neither the Madhya Pradesh state government nor
Union Carbide would comment on the reported new leak.
The factory was shut down by the state government after the Decem
ber tragedy. It has since been under the control of India's Central
Bureau of Investigation.
Doe survives killing try
MONROVIA, Liberia — Liberian leader Samuel Doe said assassins
led by the deputy chief of his personal guard poured machine-gun fire
into his jeep yesterday in an attempt to kill him. Doe said the vehicle
rammed into a lamp post, but he escaped injury.
The official government news agency said Col. Moses Flanzamaton
fled after the attack early yesterday and security forces were searching
for him.
Doe said two bodyguards traveling with him in the jeep were wounded
in the attack, which occurred on the grounds of the presidential mansion
as they returned from a weekend outing. The news agency said it
received an account of the attack from Doe as he was telling his minis
ters about it.
Doe has made many accusations of plots against him since he seized
power in April 1980, but this was the first report of an attempt on his
life.
Common Market outlook improves
BRUSSELS, Belgium — The road ahead for the Common Market,
Western Europe's often-hobbled econmic club, suddenly looks smooth
er.
The most dangerous banier facing the 10-nation bloc — divisions
over making members of Spain and Portugal — was overcome last week
after more than six years of bargaining, including a final round that
lasted nearly 90 hours.
This deal, coupled with a settlement Saturday of Greek demands for
more money, capped a 12-month series of successes that may represent
one of the crucial transition periods in the Common Market's 28-year
iife.
"Now the field is wide open for the future," said Jacques Delors. the
former French finance minister who three months ago took over as pres
ident of the Common Market's executive commission.
Syria intervenes in Lebanese war
BEIRUT'— Syria intervened diplomatically yesterday to try to help
end the Moslem-Christian battling around Lebanon's port of Sidon. At
least 40 people have been killed in four days of fighting.
Maj. Gen. Mohammed Kholi, Syria's national security adviser, held
five hours of talks with Lebanon's Christian president, Amin Gemayel,
and Rashid Karami, the Sunni Moslem prime minister.
"We have discussed the (Sidon) events and ways of facing all even
tualities," Karami told reporters. "We as a government are determined
to shoulder our responsibility in safeguarding the citizens as well as the
nation against any harm."
Asked whether the government would send reinforcements to Sidon's
army garrison, he said: "The equipment available is on the way."
Besides the Christian-Moslem fighting, there has been a recent rash of
kidnapping of Westerners. Reporting on one of the cases, a Christian
radio station said yesterday that a shepherd had found the body of a
Dutch priest in a ravine. The Rev. Nicolas Kluiters had been last seen
nearly three weeks ago and was presumed kidnapped.
There was no immediate word on how or when he was killed.
Kluiters, a Roman Catholic priest, disappeared while traveling in the
Bekaa Valley, an area of Syrian troop deployment in eastern Lebanon.
In Sidon, heavy fighting resumed at sundown yesterday, breaking a
nine-hour lull, journalists there reported.
Moslem militiamen and Palestinian guerrillas in the city's two refugee
camps were firing mortars and rockets at units of the Lebanese Forces
Christian militia on the eastern hills, the journalists said.
They reported seven civilians were wounded. Shells slammed into the
harbor and three commercial ships sailed out to escape the fire, they
said.
At the United Nations, the 10 nations that contribute a total of 5,000
soldiers to a U.N. peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon pledged their
continued support on condition that Israel and Lebanon cooperate in
making the region secure.
Shiite hijacker surrenders
JIDDA, Saudi Arabia — A hijacker who commandeered a Middle
East Airlines jet yesterday and demanded millions of dollars for one of
Lebanon's Moslem militias surrendered peacefully when the plane
landed in Jidda.
Airport officials said all of the 65 other passengers and 10 crew mem
bers were freed unharmed. The hijacker, who officials said was armed
with a pistol and a hand grenade, seized control of the Boeing 707
during a flight from Beirut, the Lebanese capital, to Jidda.
One Jidda airport official said that when word of the hijacking was
received here and the plane entered Saudi air space, the pilot was told,
"Go away, as it will never be allowed to land at any Saudi airport."
He said the plane circled the airport, with the control tower refusing
landing permission, but, "Subsequently, the pilot told the control tower
that the hijacker was willing to give himself up and end the hijacking.
And the Saudi authorities at once said the plane could land."
Lebanon's state radio quoted the jetliner's co-pilot, Omar Atshan, as
saying during the takeover that "the hijacker has no violent intentions.
His only aim is to support the 'National Resistance' in the south."
Beirut radio stations said the hijacker belonged to the National Resis
tance Movement, one of the Shiite Moslem militia groups battling Israeli
occupation forces in southern Lebanon.
Beirut airport officials said they believed the hijacker was Ali Kes
rouwani, an employee of Middle East Airlines that is Lebanon's national
carrier.
The Voice of Lebanon radio station in Beirut said the hijacker was a
member of the Kesrouwani family from the Shiite village of Ankoun in
south Lebanon, which was shelled by the Israelis on March 21 during an
anti-guerrilla sweep.
