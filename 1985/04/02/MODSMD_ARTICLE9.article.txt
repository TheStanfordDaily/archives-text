# U.S.-Japanese trade rift remains
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administration
said yesterday that Japan has made "new commit
ments on trade issues," but officials indicated there
is still no agreement on efforts to persuade the
Japanese to open their markets to U.S. goods.
On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, angry legislators
were preparing legislation that would impose
quotas and tariffs on Japanese products coming
into the United States if Japan does not lower trade
barriers.
President Reagan met at the White House with
two envoys he sent to Tokyo over the weekend in a
last-ditch attempt to prod Japanese Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone and other officials into making
trade concessions.
After the meeting with Reagan, White House
spokesman Larry Speakes said the envoys told the
president that "the government of Japan made new
commitments on trade issues."
"The president welcomes this development,"
Speakes said.
An administration official, speaking only on con

dition that he not be identified, said Gaston Sigur, a
National Security Council member specializing on
Japanese issues, and Lionel Olmer, undersecretary
of commerce for international trade, delivered a
letter from Reagan to Nakasone on Sunday.
"The special envoys to Prime Minister Nakasone
made it plain, as we have in the past, that we do
face a definite and strong push from Congress of
protectionist sentiment," the official said.
He added that the Japanese were told the presi
dent wants to be able to tell Congress "that there is
a good-faith effort on the part of the Japanese and
that we do have something to show for it."
"The president will review the results of the
Tokyo visit with members of the Cabinet," mem
bers of Congress and business leaders, Speakes
said.
Last year, Japan sent the United States nearly
$37 billion more in goods than it imported, and
some members of Congress are criticizing the ad
ministration for not doing enough to end the im
balance.

The administration, in its talks with Tokyo, has
been seeking to give U.S. firms the same access to
the Japanese market that Japanese companies have
in the United States.
Japan's telecommunications monopoly became a
private company yesterday and officials from both
countries have been trying to negotiate accords that
would make it easier for U.S. firms to sell telecom
munications products in Japan. I hat country's
tobacco monopoly also became a private company
yesterday.
Administration officials, members of Congress
and others have said the outcome of the telecom
munications talks will be a standard by which to
measure Japanese willingness to open its markets
for other goods.
Last Thursday, the Senate voted 92-0 in favor of
a non-binding resolution urging Reagan to impose
quotas and tariffs if Japan does not lower trade bar
riers.
