The
Computerized
Summer
Summer. The ideal time to take that computer course
that's eluded you all year.
The Summer Session Computer Science curriculum
offers you seven options... from introductory
programming in FORTAN and PASCAL to Data
Management and Information Processing.
And for the serious or the curious, there's also a
comprehensive, non credit microcomputer curriculum.
For details about the computerized summer or to learn
about all the Summer Session courses, ask for our
Course Bulletin. Plan to take more than a tan back to
school in the fall.
