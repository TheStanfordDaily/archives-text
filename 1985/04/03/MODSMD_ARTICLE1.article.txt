# Quad work nears finish
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
After nearly 10 months of renovation, the Inner
Quad is finally beginning to bloom. The courtyard's
niw flair is a rosette 30 feet in diameter, which is being
set among the paving blocks at the center of the court
yard.
Pre-cast pieces of the new rosette arrived at Stanford
March 22, according to Project Manager Roger Cairns.
Work on the rosette started late last fall but was
delayed by rain, he said. It was not included in the
original improvement plan because of high costs, but
was added later.
The total cost of the rosette is approximately
$24,000, Cairns said.
The nine-point rosette is based on the motif inlaid in
the Inner Quad's sandstone walls above the main
arches. The new drains set in the Quad also have nine
points, but other rosettes throughout the Quad and
arcade have either six or eight points.
Although the finishing touches have yet to be com
pleted on the Inner Quad Courtyard, beautiful weather
has encouraged students to take advantage of the im
provements.

"1 can't think of a better place to lounge around and
do nothing," said graduate student Laura Jones.
Jones and graduate student Mary Thompson did
question the amount of time and money spent on the
Inner Quad.
"Even though it took them an incredibly long time
to do it (the improvements), I think it's beautiful,"
Jones said. Work on the Quad started last summer.
"1 think it's fine, but it cost a lot," Thompson said.
Many students commented that the brick far out
classed the previous courtyard surface.
"It is an improvement," said junior Camille Be
ckham. "I think the bricks are a lot nicer than the
gravel."
"The bikes don't have to dodge it (the courtyard)
anymore," said graduate student Chuck Hunter. "It's a
lot nicer than the dustiness before this," he said.
Another improvement underway is soil preparation
in the eight landscaped circles. Planting will begin
shortly after Easter and is expected to be completed by
the dedication of the courtyard on May 17, Cairns said.
Planned shrubs include dwarf bougainvillea, cryp-

tomeria, sago palm, rockrose, dwarf
escallonia, star jasmine, lantana and
hypericum. These colorful plants will
be joined in each circle with
groundcover manzanita.
Four more trees will be planted as
well, including a palm, a jacaranda, a
crape myrtle and a flame tree.
The shrubs are not expected to
block views of the courtyard and sur
rounding Inner Quad buildings.
Cairns said. All flora were chosen
partly because of their low water re
quirements, similar to the trees
already planted in the Quad.
