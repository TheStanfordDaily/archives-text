Police rashness denied
SAN FRANCISCO — Police Chief Cornelius
Murphy, responding to criticism of a police train
ing exercise in an elementary school, denied his
department is "out of control" despite a year
long series of controversies.
However, ex-police chief Al Nelder, now a
member of the Police Commission, called the
latest incident "totally unacceptable," declaring
he couldn't understand why he had to find out
about it in the newspapers two weeks after it oc
curred.
Mayor Dianne Feinstein met with top police
brass for two hours Monday night, vowing con
tinued support for Murphy, her appointee. She
said the chief is "about the best the department
produces" and "absolutely is not planning to
retire" because of the headline-making incidents.
Murphy denied what he said were reports his
1,986-member force was "out of control," prais
ing it as one that "does not cover up any inci
dents."
Most of San Francisco's 11-person Board of
Supervisors already had been demanding a probe
of Murphy's competence as a police chief when
the latest incident surfaced last week.
On March 13, two rifle-toting officers took
over a previously vacated classroom at E.R.

Taylor Elementary School. Police said they had
received permission from school Principal Vir
ginia Gordon.
According to published reports, the training
exercise consisted of a use of the classroom for a
simulated "stakeout."
Although the classroom had been cleared of
students, some pupils did See two heavily armed
officers on the school grounds. "I thought they
were going to kill me," 7-year-old Natalie Miller
said later in an interview.
Worth veto overridden
SAN FRANCISCO — San Francisco super
visors, determined to approve a "comparable
worth" package for city employees, overrode
Mayor Dianne Feinstein's veto for the first time
in her six years in office.
"I hated to do it," said board president John
Molinari. "I hated to vote for her first override
because I've been a tremendous supporter of
hers, but we just disagreed on this."
The board voted 9-2 on Monday to set up an
$8.8 million fund for city employees in the next
fiscal year. The cost will rise to $10 million in the
year after. The plan first called for money to be
distributed in the form of a $5 daily meal allow
ance, but the board dropped that scheme after
the city attorney's office ruled it would be illegal.

Now, the money will he set aside until a legal
means of distributing it can be found. The board
passed the program for the first time on March
25, along with an overall pay hike, effective July
1.
Comparable worth is the theory that men and
women should be paid comparable salaries for
jobs requiring similar education and carrying
similar responsibility.
Feinstein expressed serious objections to the
idea of balancing the scales for 7,000 city
workers by paying them lunch money, calling it a
form of fringe benefit that only voters can ap
prove.
"I support comparable worth and I will sup
port any legal and financially realistic program
for implementing salary adjustments to achieve
this goal," the mayor said in her veto message
Friday. "I will not support or become part of a
contrived and illegal solution."
While the supervisors seemed to concede the
plan was faulty, they defended the idea behind it
as a worthy goal.
Today's weather
Tomorrow's weather will feature continued
sunny skies and warm temperatures, with highs
up into the 80s and light breezes the order of the
day. Same for Thursday.
