## Alternatives devised as fossil fuels run out 
### CHRIS HAQQ 
It is widely recognized that the fos
sil fuel supplies which catalyzed the
industrial revolution are running out.
Proposed tar sand and oil shale
replacements will run out shortly
after the original supplies. Nuclear
fission reactors have failed to live up
to their promise in terms of power
output and public acceptance.
Energy is used to heat homes,
transport goods, communicate with
others and cook meals. Society
depends on a vast supply of energy
for every aspect of its existence. Is
there an energy crisis?
From the sun comes virtually all of
the energy used on earth. The energy
in coal and oil is ultimately derived
from sunlight. Each year, 1,500,000
trillion kilowatt hours of radiant en
ergy makes its way to the planet's
outer atmosphere. There is no
"energy crisis." As the late R. Buck
minster Fuller, the perceptive inven
tor of, among other things, the
geodesic dome, said, there is only
a "crisis" of ignorance concerning
how to harness potent energy sources
currently neglected.
Of the light energy arriving at the
outer atmosphere, much is converted
directly to heat, reflected back into
space, or used to power the weather
cycle of evaporation and precipita
tion. Medard Gabel, in his compre
hensive book, "Energy, Earth and
Everyone," puts current human en
ergy use into perspective, by compar
ing it to the power consumption of
the earth system. If the earth's
remaining fossil and nuclear fuels
were used — including the ore
deposits and oil that are known but
have not been mined or pumped —
the earth system could be run for two
weeks. After 1.2 billion years of ener
getic illumination, life appeared in
the earth system, and began to use
some of the available surplus energy.
At least 2.5 billion years ago,
primitive algae developed the ability
to use sunlight in a process called
photosynthesis. From plant tissues,
alcohol and methane gas can be ex
tracted. As Stanford Geology Prof.
Dave Larue noted, if society is pa

tient, and can wait for geological
forces to apply heat and pressure,
plant tissues yield coal and oil. If sci
entists could synthetically duplicate
and harness photosynthesis in a test
tube to produce power, society could
use a source of energy with a plethora
of advantages compared to those cur
rently used.
In addition to finding new, more
secure and environmentally sound
forms of energy, society must con

serve energy. Energy conservation is
often misconceived as being such
methods as wearing heavy woolen
sweaters indoors and living in glass
solar houses. In contrast, Gabel
defines conservation as nothing
more than "doing more with less"
— increasing the efficiency of energy
use. One of the best examples of con
servation illustrating this distinction is
the portable stereo. A typical cassette
player consumes 0.005 watts, about

10,000 times less power than a 60
watt system. This instance of conser
vation does not seem a reversion to
the dark ages, although some might
argue that the technological capabil
ity to subject oneself to high-volume
popular music in isolation is no great
advance.
Bioconversion refers to any process
that converts organic tissue into a
useable fuel. Gabel considers this
source of alternate energy one of the

most promising. The earth is said to
produce 150 billion tons of plant mat
ter annually. Divided among the
planetary population, this would
amount to 150 pounds per person per
day. Bioconversion techniques exist
to produce charcoal, oil, alcohol,
methane and hydrogen from such raw
material. Most of the sun's energy
stored in plants remains in refuse like
corn cobs, carrot tops, and lawn cut
tings that are typically dumped into

municipal landfills. Millions of
kilowatt hours of electricity could be
saved simply by incinerating the na
tion's combustible trash to power
electrical generation.
In China, more than 7 million
biogas plants are in use. A 1978 com
pendium of papers submitted to the
Joint Economic Committee of the
U.S. Congress suggests that almost
anyone can build a workable methane
generator for family use. An airtight
tank to keep bacteria growing with
out oxygen is the only requirement.
No high pressure or temperature is
needed, unlike other bioconversion
processes. There is hope that if
sewage treatment was handled in a
decentralized fashion, public health
and sewage collection problems
would be attenuated. In developed
areas of the world, it would prove
economical to consider fertilizer
manufacture, instead of restructuring
the sewage treatment infrastructure.
Each year, the residents of Mil
waukee Wisconsin produce 75,000
tons of "Milorganite," which is
granular-activated sewer sludge. This
type of fertilizer, while requiring sani
tary treatment to prevent transmis
sion of disease, conserves energy in
the agricultural sector. Currently an
expensive chemical method called the
Haber process produces much of the
fertilizer used on American farms.
Any fertilizer produced from waste
prevents the investment of expensive
fuels to synthesize nitrogen, a crucial
component of plant fertilizers.
In Nebraska, more than 7 million
bushels of spoiled grain could he fer
mented to yield about 20 million gal
lons of alcohol. Gasohol, a mixture of
10 percent alcohol and 90 percent
gasoline, has advantages like higher
octane rating, better engine perfor
mance, and increased mileage. Some
imaginative researchers, including
Melvin Calvin, the researcher who
first discovered the sequence of
chemical steps in one photosynthetic
process, have considered cultivating
algae on semi-arid or arid lands not
suited to other crops. The algae
