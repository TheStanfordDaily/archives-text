## The 						Stanford Daily The 						MX litmus test 
### 
In an emotional speech last week on the floor
of the House of Representatives, Rep. Vic Fazio
(D-Ca.), saying he had decided to set aside
longstanding opposition to the MX missile and
support the White House-backed deployment,
warned President Reagan that "we need you to
understand that enough is enough."
But "enough" may not be enough now that
Congress has released $1.5 billion for 21 new
MX missiles. Leading political commentators
have said that "good timing," namely the
reopened Geneva arms control talks with the So
viet Union, was the linchpin in the administra
tion's successful campaign to approve the MX.
This is, at best, a half truth. On the eve of the So
viet walkout from the START Talks in 1983, the
administration waged a successful campaign to
deploy, in Nebraska and Wyoming, the 21 MX
missiles already based in silos. To complete his
"strategic modernization," Reagan has called for
a total MX force of more than 100 missiles.
Against a backdrop of sharp budget cuts,
House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.)
stood out when he claimed that the vote on a pro
gram that could cost $41 billion was a question of

"conscience," not party. For Republican senators
facing re-election campaigns in 1986, the MX
became a litmus test for Reagan. Only two of the
22 Republicans whose terms are expiring next
year voted against it, and three former MX oppo
nents among the 22 switched to support the ad
ministration. Minority Leader Robert Bird (D-
Va.) backed the White House. Leading House
Democrats, fearing any breakdown in the
Geneva talks would be blamed on the failure of
the MX, changed their positions or abstained
from the final vote, giving the Republican
minority the clout it needed to carry the day.
Defectors in both parties cited solidarity and
absolution — not an enhanced nuclear deterrent
— as key reasons for the change.
House Armed Services Committee Chairman
Les Aspin (D-Wis.), who delivered the final floor
speech in favor of the MX, has signaled his intent
to scale down the MX program. But his contin
ued support of the missile, in collusion with col
leagues who have repeatedly said the MX en
hances neither national security nor global
stability, is nothing less than a mockery of the
real potential of the Congress to exert a positive
impact on arms control.
