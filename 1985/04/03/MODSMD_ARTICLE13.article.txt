An explanation due
This is a copy of a letter sent to
University President Donald Ken
nedy.
Dear Don:
1 am outraged at what happened
this last Thursday whereupon the
Senate of the Academic Council of
Stanford University was denied
access to their appropriate meeting
place by persons unknown to the
faculty and to yourself. I can only
surmise that this meeting, which was
reputed to be sponsored by the
Hoover Institution, was planned and
secured by persons without appropri
ate University knowledge or sanc
tion.
You owe both the Faculty Senate
and the entire Academic Council an
in-depth explanation of this event,
including who organized it, under
whose authority, who were the se
curity guards involved, and what was
the nature of the meeting taking
place. Clearly there are important
principles and rules of behavior
concerning use of Stanford facilities,
including their use for non-political
and non-defense related activities, as
well as freedom of access by the
Stanford community and control of
security at Stanford by the Univer
sity administration. If any of these
principles has been violated in the
events of last Thursday, then some
one is responsible for them, and that
person(s) must be held accountable.
A less than adequate response to
this letter by you will surely make
Stanford a less desirable place for
me, and likely for others of my col
leagues, to continue my academic
pursuits.

Women left out of
the'physics club'
Recently, one of my
students, Melissa Fischer, reported
that Dick Bond, professor of physics,
showed a Playboy pinup as part of
some joke in his Physics 51 class.
This incident is most unfortunate. No
student — man or woman — should
be subjected to pornography as part
of a university course.
In addition to the problem of
public advocacy of pornography, a
more serious issue presents itself
here, namely one dealing with equal
opportunity for women in science. I
believe that an incident of this kind
is demoralizing to women students in
particular. The problem of the subtle
discrimination against women
working in science is complex and
goes beyond the boundaries of the
Stanford campus. Nonetheless, 1
hope that this incident might prompt
the Department of Physics at Stan
ford to take a long and critical look
at its policies concerning women
students and women faculty.
A quick survey of the number of
women graduating with majors in
physics indicates that women do not
feel comfortable studying in the
Physics Department:
Women Total
physics physics
Year majors majors
1979 3 21
1980 4 27
1981 3 21
1982 1 26
1983 1 13
1984 2 19

The number of women majoring in
physics has not been increasing over
the past few years. This means that
increasing numbers of women will
not be doing graduate work in
physics, nor be moving into senior
positions from which they could
participate in guiding the develop
ment of physics in this country. This,
I believe, is a serious problem.
I would argue that Dick Bond's
unfortunate error in judgment is
symptomatic of deeper problems in
the department's recruitment of
women. Studies in the sociology of
science demonstrate that the kind of
encouragement and discouragement
that students receive affects their
performance. Consider for a moment
the effect on a young woman student
of the two following scenarios: 1)
Physics 51 is taught by an accom
plished physicist and mature woman.
Her presence on the teaching faculty
allows her not only to convey the
basic principles of physics to the
student, but also to act as a role
model for women in a field where
men traditionally have been predom
inant. 2) Physics 51 is taught by an
accomplished physicist who shows a
Playboy centerfold during class time.
The young woman student must not
only attempt to block out his use of
pornography each time she opens
her Physics 51 textbook, but is also
made to feel that she is not part of
the "physics club."
I would encourage the Physics
Department to look seriously at the
subtle ways women might be dis
couraged from studying physics.
