## Stricter standards for fees 
### 
VIEWPOINT

The Daily editorial in support of the elimination of fee
assessment refunds fails to consider a vital prior question
— the rationale for such student taxation. After all, one
needn't agree with the libertarian view that taxes are nec
essarily evil to believe that they require better justification
than the desire of the majority to force the minority to
help pay for something. I believe that a close examination
of this issue shows two things: that there is a need for

more explicit standards with which to distinguish appro
priate from illegitimate assessment requests, and that
eliminating refunds is a bad idea.
What then are acceptable grounds for imposing student
taxes? I can think of three, or possibly four, categories:
1) those activities which (potentially) benefit all stu
dents, or for which it is essentially impossible to distin
guish the beneficiaries. In economic jargon, these are
"public goods," and the classic example is national
defense — it's impossible to selectively not defend those
who don't wish to pay taxes to support the military. The
closest campus analogues are The Daily and K.ZSU: The
radio signal is out there for anyone and everyone to listen
to at once. (You say you don't like KZSU? Keep reading.)
2) similarly, those activities which provide indirect
"spillover" benefits (i.e., "externalities") to those not di
rectly involved. This kind of argument applies to groups
like the Speakers Bureau; if a thousand students attend an
informative presentation on a controversial social issue,
the general level of campus debate on the subject will be
raised. (What is the attendance threshold for significant
spillover benefits? I don't know, but the question should
admit of a reasonable consensus.)
3) those activities required by social justice. In the "real
world," this is the biggie underpinning welfare, social se
curity and all similar programs. Here, I think its ap
plicability is much more limited; I doubt that any
identifiable group of Stanford students is in enough
poverty to have a claim to others' money on distributive
justice grounds. (If there were such a group, it might well
be grad students, who almost certainly subsidize under
graduates via fee assessments, rather than the other way
around.) One exception: While poverty isn't the issue, a
strong case for tax support of SURE can be made on
grounds of compensatory justice — women should have as
much freedom of movement as men.
4) those activities whose value to beneficiaries is un
derrated beforehand (i.e., "inadequate information in the
market"). This one is tricky; it can be argued that, as part
of the University's educational mission, students should
be encouraged to explore "free" (i.e., subsidized) events
they wouldn't initially pay for (e.g., the Tuesday
Films). The trick is that the ASSU senator or fee
assessment voter is presumed to know more than the indi
vidual student about what would be valuable for him or
her to be exposed to. A better solution might be to pro
vide such groups with start-up money only; students who
attended the events would be asked to contribute on their
way out if they found it worthwhile and wanted more of
the same in the future. (Yes, a certain amount of freeload-

ing would occur, but that could be taken into account in
calculating the "suggested donation.")
That's my list. Maybe there are other valid arguments
I've missed, but I do believe that some such list should
provide the basis on which groups seeking tax support
must make their claim. Too often, The Daily's argument
in support of a fee assessment has stopped at, "This is a
worthwhile activity." That's not enough — if Club Sports
is worthwhile to its participants, why don't they pay for it?
If the various academic organizations truly meet the needs
of their members, shouldn't those people be willing to
provide the support? Again, administrative difficulties
might justify public start-up funding, but beyond that, the
rationale must be more than an implicit appeal to ill
defined school spirit.
Suppose that some such list is adopted, either officially
or informally, and that assessments are granted only to
groups with a legitimate claim on public resources. Would
that justify eliminating fee refunds? Not completely. The
above "public goods" argument for taxes referred to ac
tivities of potential benefit to all students; but if you never
listen to KZSU or read The Daily (or discuss its contents
with those who do), or you think Legal Counseling is a

That's not enough — if Club
Sports is worthwhile to its

pay for it?

joke, then those activities provide you no actual benefit.
As it stands, I'm happy to vote for the radio assessment,
even though 6 a.m. is a miserable time for their jazz pro
gramming, because I can get my refund; without refunds,
if the station's satisfied listeners falls from 51 percent to
49 percent of the student body one year, the percentage of
students paying assessments drops from 100 to zero!
Seems to me that's a bigger problem for budget planning
than the present one.
The editorial's other arguments against refunds were
that the present system allows freeloading, and that stu
dents mistakenly assume they are justified in getting
refunds from groups from which they don't benefit. The
first argument is true, but no evidence is provided to
suggest that the problem is significant, let alone worse
than the alternative problem of compulsory fees without
benefits. Which leads to The Daily's second point — and
given the present absence of standards other than
majority rule for fee assessments, the "mistake" there is
clearly the paper's, not the students'. Even if more rigid
standards (along the above lines) were adopted, in some
cases refunds would still be a necessary correction to an
imperfect system.

VIEWPOINT

The Daily editorial in support of the elimination of fee
assessment refunds fails to consider a vital prior question
— the rationale for such student taxation. After all, one
needn't agree with the libertarian view that taxes are nec
essarily evil to believe that they require better justification
than the desire of the majority to force the minority to
help pay for something. I believe that a close examination
of this issue shows two things: that there is a need for

more explicit standards with which to distinguish appro
priate from illegitimate assessment requests, and that
eliminating refunds is a bad idea.
What then are acceptable grounds for imposing student
taxes? I can think of three, or possibly four, categories:
1) those activities which (potentially) benefit all stu
dents, or for which it is essentially impossible to distin
guish the beneficiaries. In economic jargon, these are
"public goods," and the classic example is national
defense — it's impossible to selectively not defend those
who don't wish to pay taxes to support the military. The
closest campus analogues are The Daily and K.ZSU: The
radio signal is out there for anyone and everyone to listen
to at once. (You say you don't like KZSU? Keep reading.)
2) similarly, those activities which provide indirect
"spillover" benefits (i.e., "externalities") to those not di
rectly involved. This kind of argument applies to groups
like the Speakers Bureau; if a thousand students attend an
informative presentation on a controversial social issue,
the general level of campus debate on the subject will be
raised. (What is the attendance threshold for significant
spillover benefits? I don't know, but the question should
admit of a reasonable consensus.)
3) those activities required by social justice. In the "real
world," this is the biggie underpinning welfare, social se
curity and all similar programs. Here, I think its ap
plicability is much more limited; I doubt that any
identifiable group of Stanford students is in enough
poverty to have a claim to others' money on distributive
justice grounds. (If there were such a group, it might well
be grad students, who almost certainly subsidize under
graduates via fee assessments, rather than the other way
around.) One exception: While poverty isn't the issue, a
strong case for tax support of SURE can be made on
grounds of compensatory justice — women should have as
much freedom of movement as men.
4) those activities whose value to beneficiaries is un
derrated beforehand (i.e., "inadequate information in the
market"). This one is tricky; it can be argued that, as part
of the University's educational mission, students should
be encouraged to explore "free" (i.e., subsidized) events
they wouldn't initially pay for (e.g., the Tuesday
Films). The trick is that the ASSU senator or fee
assessment voter is presumed to know more than the indi
vidual student about what would be valuable for him or
her to be exposed to. A better solution might be to pro
vide such groups with start-up money only; students who
attended the events would be asked to contribute on their
way out if they found it worthwhile and wanted more of
the same in the future. (Yes, a certain amount of freeload-

ing would occur, but that could be taken into account in
calculating the "suggested donation.")
That's my list. Maybe there are other valid arguments
I've missed, but I do believe that some such list should
provide the basis on which groups seeking tax support
must make their claim. Too often, The Daily's argument
in support of a fee assessment has stopped at, "This is a
worthwhile activity." That's not enough — if Club Sports
is worthwhile to its participants, why don't they pay for it?
If the various academic organizations truly meet the needs
of their members, shouldn't those people be willing to
provide the support? Again, administrative difficulties
might justify public start-up funding, but beyond that, the
rationale must be more than an implicit appeal to ill
defined school spirit.

or informally, and that assessments are granted only to
groups with a legitimate claim on public resources. Would
that justify eliminating fee refunds? Not completely. The
