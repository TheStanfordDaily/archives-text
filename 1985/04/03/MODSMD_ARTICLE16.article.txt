# Pendleton is a true civil rights leader
## 
### 
A very courageous man has been taking a lot of
flack in recent weeks — really, ever since he
became chairman of the United States Commis
sion on Civil Rights at the end of last year. Ben
jamin Hooks, executive director of the NAACP,
calls this man s statements "appalling." The Stan
ford Daily editorial board finds him "outrageous."
Who is this man? What has he been doing to
draw the wrath of prominent black leaders of the
current genre, newspaper edit boards and others?
The man is Clarence Pendleton. And from the
verbal dung that's been flung at him. one might
think that he had arrived to fulfill the long-feared
prophesy of the "coming of the beast." Indeed,
Francis Guess, a black who sits on the Civil Rights
Commission, has said, "If Pendleton weren't black,
by this time I would have concluded he was a
bigot."
The virulent reactions Pendleton's actions and
words have drawn from the inertia-stricken civil
rights leadership reveals the stagnation and tunnel
vision that has beset these so-called "leaders" and
betrays their inability to perceive the obvious and
utter failures of social legislation that was to end
racism, bring blacks up to the economic level of
whites, eliminate black ghettos, etc.
When it comes right down to it, to most
prominent civil rights activists in this country civil
rights means reparations. To them, civil rights
means a group's "getting what's coming to them."
That sort of an attitude, when assumed by any indi
vidual or group, spells disaster. It is a way of
looking at the world that prevents the essential de
velopment of values and of an outlook that are en
abling factors to goal-setting, achievement and suc
cess.
Clarence Pendleton doesn't follow the step of
that homogeneous group whose statements are
seen as representing the supposedly singular

opinion of American blacks. He doesn't buy the
pack of goods that these civil rights "leaders" have
been peddling for the last couple of decades.
And for his offense of not conforming to the
mold of a black civil rights leader Pendleton is cas
tigated.
Why are all vocal blacks who desire some degree

Why are some issues seen as 'black issues' about
which all blacks are expected to share the same
opinion?

of credibility expected to think alike? Why are
some issues seen as "black issues" about which all
blacks are expected to share the same opinion?
Pendleton complains about these ridiculous expec
tations: "There is no such thing (as monolithic
black thought), just as there is no such thing as
monolithic white thought. . . . Civil rights is not a
black issue. It is an American issue. Blacks have no

monopolistic claim."
The gencric parroters of old and tired rhetoric
and relentless pushers of failed programs who are
widely perceived as civil rights leaders do not lead.
They walk — and sometimes sprint — in circles.
Clarence Pendleton is one of the only true leaders
in civil rights around today. He is one of the few
who remembers the message of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 — that is, enforce color-blindness in
the United States. The purpose of the act was most
assuredly not to create a system of reparations that
creates the crippling problems of dependency and
widespread misunderstanding of the essential roles
of self-reliance and individual responsibility. And
its purpose was certainly not to undermine the
credibility of those who have diligently worked to
achieve positions of prominence and subtly deny
them the respect they and all achievers deserve.
Clarence Pendleton has had the courage and the

insight to steer clear of the rusty bandwagon of
status quo civil rights advocates that should have
been relegated to the junk heap long ago. He is
truly a civil rights leader.
