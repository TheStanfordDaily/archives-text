# Students protest Playboy
## Launch petition drives against photographer's visit 
### SHIRISH DATE Senior staff writer 
Campus anti-pornography groups
have begun their fight — currently
embodied in three petition drives —
against a Playboy magazine visit to
campus scheduled for later this
month.
Playboy officials had no comment
on the proposed protest yesterday but
said their plans for interviewing and
photographing women here were
progressing uneventfully.
Two groups, one from the Law
School and the other comprising un
dergraduates, hope to discourage
Stanford women from interviewing
and posing for Playboy's planned
"Women of the Pac-10" pictorial.
"We want women who decide to
pose to reach an educated decision,"
keeping in mind "that pornography
relates to violence against women,"
said Vanessa Poster, a spokeswoman
for Stanford Students Opposed to
Pornography (STOP).
"The values that allow society to
accept Playboy allow it to accept vio
lence against women," she added.
STOP was created late last quarter
when Poster and other students
learned of Playboy's scheduled visit
to campus. STOP member Laurie
Wedemeyer said she was "outraged"
when she heard of Playboy's plans. "T
know someone will pose, and in doing
so [she'llJ be representing me," she
said.
The effort by law students, spon
sored by Women at Stanford Law and
also conceived last month, involves
circulating a petition suppporting the
use of "legal and administrative"
pressure to block Playboy's use of the
Stanford name, according to group
spokeswoman Hedy McAdams.
"We don't want Playboy to exploit
Stanford's name," she said. "We
believe the administration doesn't
want that to happen."
McAdams said her group collected
bewteen 500 and 600 signatures on a
petition Monday and yesterday after
noons, with signatories divided nearly
evenly between men and women.
"We're delighted that people are so
sensitive to the issue," she said.
The petition states that Playboy,
"while not the most heinous of por
nographers .. . reinforces sex
stereotypes by portraying women as

sexual objects and thus furthers
sexual inequality in our society."
Further, it "encourages ali mem
bers of the community to sign in op
position to Playboy's use of the Stan
ford name in connection with any of
its centerfolds or its photo displays."
McAdams said her group is talking
to faculty and administrators in at
tempts to enlist their aid in keeping
Playboy from using "Stanford" in its
October pictorial. "We think that
Stanford should not want to be asso
ciated with Playboy's activities," she
said.
STOP is also circulating two peti
tions aimed at persuading The Daily
not to run advertising from Playboy
asking for models. The first is for in
dividuals, and the other asks student
groups who ordinarily advertise in the
Daily to consider boycotting the
paper if it runs Playboy's ads.
According to Wedemeyer, the first
petition collected approximately 150
names Monday at Maples Pavilion,
and about 10 campus groups, includ
ing the Rape Education Project, the
Women's Center and Peace Educa
tion at Stanford, have signed the
second petition thus far.
"We're not out to get The Daily,"
Wedemeyer said. "We just don't
want The Daily to endorse Playboy."
But Daily Editor in Chief Tim

Grieve said the paper would
definitely run Playboy advertising,
saying editorial and advertising
policies must remain separate.
"Advertisements are not editorial en
dorsements," he said. "We run ad
vertisements for the CIA, and it's
clear that the editorial board has not
supported the actions of the CTA."
Playboy spokeswoman Barb Car
ney confirmed that the magazine has
advertisements asking for models
planned for the April 17, 18 and 19
issues of The Daily.
In addition to the petitions, the
group has written a letter to approxi
mately 60 area hotels asking them to
refuse "rental of any rooms or space
where [Playboy's photographers]
could interview women for their mag
azine."
The letter, dated March 25, states
that STOP is "willing to recommend
a boycott by Stanford students and
their families of any hotel that sup
ports Playboy in its efforts."
It also calls pornography a
"destructive institution which
demeans women, fails to recognize
their humanness by portraying them
as objects without thought or feeling
and presents a distorted view of . . .
the roles of men and women."


Todd Sitrin/Daily
Laurie Wedemeyer, a member of Stanford Students Opposed to Por
nography (STOP), explains on KGO-TV yesterday some ways STOP
hopes to foil Playboy's search for models at Stanford.
Student petition drives and consultations with
faculty and administrators at Stanford make this
campus one of the most active in the Pacific 10
Conference in opposing Playboy magazine's
recruiting efforts.
Although Stanford students are fighting to keep
Playboy's ads out of The Daily and to keep Stan
ford's name out of Playboy, students at Arizona
State University were barely fazed by Playboy's
visit there, according to Mike Humphreys, copy
chief of the Arizona State University Press. He said
he was aware of Playboy's presence on campus only
because he read an advertisement. "The whole
thing passed without incidence," Humphreys said.
"It almost happened without me even knowing

about it."
But the lack of excitement and protest over the
incident did not mean that prospective models were
unaware of the opportunity. "I heard at least one
woman say that she was going to interview," he
said.
At UCLA, reaction was also slight. After
Playboy's visit last month. The Daily Bruin ran an
article in which the undergraduate president said
he opposed Playboy's coming to campus. But Jean-
Pierre Cativiela, the assistant news editor there,
stressed that whatever reaction occurred was only
in response to the story that ran.
There were "no protests and not much uproar,"
Cativiela said. Newspapers and television stations
"were looking for it, but there wasn't any uproar."

David Chan, the Playboy photographer who con
ducted interviews at UCLA, said there was more
uproar eight years ago when he was in Los Angeles,
and predicted that reaction would be the greatest at
the smaller, more isolated universities in the Pac
-10 because everyone is more likely to know he's on
campus, according to Cativiela.
"There's so much sleaze around all the time,
we're used to it," Cativiela said.
The Daily Bruin's decision to run Playboy's ads
was based on its advertising guidelines. "Our policy
states that no ads that are blatantly sexist can be
run," Cativiela said, explaining that the ad that ran
was a black-and-white graphic of Playboy's logo

As of yesterday evening,
Wedemeyer did not know of any
hotel managers who had answered
the letter. Carney said Playboy's
photographer, David Chan, has not
yet made hotel arrangements in Palo
Alto.
Wedemeyer also hopes to get the
suppport of the University adminis
tration in STOP's campaign. She is
lobbying officials to make a public
declaration saying the University
does not advocate Stanford women
posing for the magazine.

Wedemeyer said Playboy's last
Pacific Athletic Conference pictorial
did not "do justice" to the intelli
gence and college achievements of
the women pictured. "Anything they
(Playboy) could do to make what | the
women] did at college [seem] sexual
or suggestive, they did it.
"I don't think we need that kind of
publicity at all," she said.
Playboy Enterprises confirmed
March 5 that photographer David
Chan would be coming to Stanlord
this month to photograph female stu
dents for the magazine's upcoming
pictorial on women in Pacitic 10 Con
ference schools.
The Rev. B. Davie Napier, dean of the
Chapel and professor of religion at Stanford
from 1966 to 1972, will be the featured speaker
at the University's 1985 baccalaureate service,
9 a.m. Saturday, June 15, in Frost Ampitheatre.
Some 6,000 to 7,000 people, including
graduates, their families and faculty are ex
pected to attend the colorful nondenomina
tional ceremony as part of commencement
weekend activities.
The convocation also will feature spiritual
readings by Dean of the Chapel Robert
Hamerton-Kelly, University President Donald
Kennedy, senior class presidents and ministers
of the major religious groups on campus. Music
will be provided by University organist Herbert
Nanney, the Memorial Church Choir and caril
lonneur James Angell, among others.

At Stanford, Napier gained fame among stu
dents for his efforts to relate Scripture to the
turbulent political times of the late 19605. In
1971 he was one of nine Bay Area clergymen,
professors and engineers who used nonviolent
civil disobedience to block entry to the San
Mateo Draft Board.
When he left Stanford in 1972 to accept the
presidency of the Pacific School of Religion in
Berkeley, then-President Richard Lyman
remarked, "Regret is hardly an adequate word
to express my feelings about Dean Napier's
decision to leave Stanford. In his five years here
he has responded eloquently to the growing stu
dent search for religious meaning and values."
Radiation found to help arthritis
Patients with previously untreatable
rheumatoid arthritis have obtained long-term

relief from stiffness and pain following treat
ment with a form of radiation therapy
developed by Stanford doctors.
This form of radiation therapy — called total
lymphoid irradiation (TLI) — also shows prom
ise as a treatment for severe lupus nephritis, a
disease in which the immune system attacks the
kidneys, the doctors reported.
The potential of TLI against the two diseases
was outlined in two reports published in the
April issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine
by Samuel Hoppe, associate professor of radiol
ogy.
'Largest bibliographic project ever'
By sometime around the end of the decade,
nearly everything published in the English
speaking world, from the books of Samuel
Johnson to the announcements of pig auctions

in Somerset, will be cataloged in the Research
Libraries Group (RLG) computer on the Stan
ford campus.
'it is probably the largest bibliographic proj
ect ever undertaken," says John Haeger, vice
president for programs and planning at RLG.
"It is a multi-million dollar, multi-national proj
ect to catalog or recatalog literally everything
that was printed in the English language
anyplace in the world between 1701 and 1800,
or in any language in the United Kingdom or
any of its dependencies."
The project, called the 18th Century Short
Title Catalog (ESTC), was begun by the British
Library. A telephone line between London and
Palo Alto will be operating by May or June, ac
cording to Haeger. British Library staff will
then be able to work directly with an integrated
database here by the summer, he said.
