# Students protest Playboy
## Launch petition drives against photographer's visit 
### SHIRISH DATE Senior staff writer 
Campus anti-pornography groups
have begun their fight — currently
embodied in three petition drives —
against a Playboy magazine visit to
campus scheduled for later this
month.
Playboy officials had no comment
on the proposed protest yesterday but
said their plans for interviewing and
photographing women here were
progressing uneventfully.
Two groups, one from the Law
School and the other comprising un
dergraduates, hope to discourage
Stanford women from interviewing
and posing for Playboy's planned
"Women of the Pac-10" pictorial.
"We want women who decide to
pose to reach an educated decision,"
keeping in mind "that pornography
relates to violence against women,"
said Vanessa Poster, a spokeswoman
for Stanford Students Opposed to
Pornography (STOP).
"The values that allow society to
accept Playboy allow it to accept vio
lence against women," she added.
STOP was created late last quarter
when Poster and other students
learned of Playboy's scheduled visit
to campus. STOP member Laurie
Wedemeyer said she was "outraged"
when she heard of Playboy's plans. "T
know someone will pose, and in doing
so [she'llJ be representing me," she
said.
The effort by law students, spon
sored by Women at Stanford Law and
also conceived last month, involves
circulating a petition suppporting the
use of "legal and administrative"
pressure to block Playboy's use of the
Stanford name, according to group
spokeswoman Hedy McAdams.
"We don't want Playboy to exploit
Stanford's name," she said. "We
believe the administration doesn't
want that to happen."
McAdams said her group collected
bewteen 500 and 600 signatures on a
petition Monday and yesterday after
noons, with signatories divided nearly
evenly between men and women.
"We're delighted that people are so
sensitive to the issue," she said.
The petition states that Playboy,
"while not the most heinous of por
nographers .. . reinforces sex
stereotypes by portraying women as

sexual objects and thus furthers
sexual inequality in our society."
Further, it "encourages ali mem
bers of the community to sign in op
position to Playboy's use of the Stan
ford name in connection with any of
its centerfolds or its photo displays."
McAdams said her group is talking
to faculty and administrators in at
tempts to enlist their aid in keeping
Playboy from using "Stanford" in its
October pictorial. "We think that
Stanford should not want to be asso
ciated with Playboy's activities," she
said.
STOP is also circulating two peti
tions aimed at persuading The Daily
not to run advertising from Playboy
asking for models. The first is for in
dividuals, and the other asks student
groups who ordinarily advertise in the
Daily to consider boycotting the
paper if it runs Playboy's ads.
According to Wedemeyer, the first
petition collected approximately 150
names Monday at Maples Pavilion,
and about 10 campus groups, includ
ing the Rape Education Project, the
Women's Center and Peace Educa
tion at Stanford, have signed the
second petition thus far.
"We're not out to get The Daily,"
Wedemeyer said. "We just don't
want The Daily to endorse Playboy."
But Daily Editor in Chief Tim

Grieve said the paper would
definitely run Playboy advertising,
saying editorial and advertising
policies must remain separate.
"Advertisements are not editorial en
dorsements," he said. "We run ad
vertisements for the CIA, and it's
clear that the editorial board has not
supported the actions of the CTA."
Playboy spokeswoman Barb Car
ney confirmed that the magazine has
advertisements asking for models
planned for the April 17, 18 and 19
issues of The Daily.
In addition to the petitions, the
group has written a letter to approxi
mately 60 area hotels asking them to
refuse "rental of any rooms or space
where [Playboy's photographers]
could interview women for their mag
azine."
The letter, dated March 25, states
that STOP is "willing to recommend
a boycott by Stanford students and
their families of any hotel that sup
ports Playboy in its efforts."
It also calls pornography a
"destructive institution which
demeans women, fails to recognize
their humanness by portraying them
as objects without thought or feeling
and presents a distorted view of . . .
the roles of men and women."
