Kathleen Moloney is a Stanford stu
dent working in Geneva with the
Women's International League For
Peace and Freedom as a United Na
tions Disarmament Fellow. The fol
lowing is her report on a conference in
which she recently participated.
More than 85 women from 39
countries gathered recently in
Geneva at the United Nations to par
ticipate in a three-day conference on
"Women and Peace." One of the
most striking features of the reunion
was the sense of urgency that per
meated the atmosphere and
sometimes frustrated discussions.
Each member seemed to bring a
particularly pressing issue or cam
paign to advocate at the conference,
perhaps in hopes of gaining greater
international support for local,
regional or organizational initiatives

One evening three El Salvadoran
women described the kidnappings,
tortures, beatings and rapes they and
their families have suffered at the
hands of the Salvadoran military.

for peace. Given the diversity of the
women represented and the plethora
of the proposals put forth, a certain
degree of discord seemed inevitable.
The conflicts which surfaced and
floated throughout the course of the
conference reflected not only the dif
ferences within the women's move
ment in general, but the variety of
opinions in the peace movement itself
as to which issues and strategies seem
most critical and appropriate at this

juncture in international relations.
The divergence of opinion and tac
tics represented at the conference
emerged in the first few hours, when
Titewhai Harawira, a Maori woman
from New Zealand, challenged the
whole setup of the conference as
being "false." She claimed that the
agenda ignored the concrete and im
mediate needs of indigenous women
in the Pacific who are having "jelly
babies" and dying as a result of nu
clear testing in the region right now.
Others agreed that women cannot af
ford to wait any longer for U.N.-
sponsored initiatives for disarmament
and peace to bear real fruit.
The stage for controversy over in
tegrationist versus separatist ap
proaches to women's struggles for
peace was set from the start with a
speech by Madame Therese Gastaut,
director of public information for the

United Nations, on the importance of
women attaining positions of power
in the U.N. agencies if they aim to
bring about peaceful reforms on any
significant scale.
Many women expressed an oppos
ing view that considers autonomous
women's organizations and actions to
be the most effective way for women
to find the support and momentum
