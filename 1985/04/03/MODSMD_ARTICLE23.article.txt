# Women work for world peace despite discord
## 
### KATHLEEN MALONEY 
Kathleen Moloney is a Stanford stu
dent working in Geneva with the
Women's International League For
Peace and Freedom as a United Na
tions Disarmament Fellow. The fol
lowing is her report on a conference in
which she recently participated.
More than 85 women from 39
countries gathered recently in
Geneva at the United Nations to par
ticipate in a three-day conference on
"Women and Peace." One of the
most striking features of the reunion
was the sense of urgency that per
meated the atmosphere and
sometimes frustrated discussions.
Each member seemed to bring a
particularly pressing issue or cam
paign to advocate at the conference,
perhaps in hopes of gaining greater
international support for local,
regional or organizational initiatives

One evening three El Salvadoran
women described the kidnappings,
tortures, beatings and rapes they and
their families have suffered at the
hands of the Salvadoran military.

for peace. Given the diversity of the
women represented and the plethora
of the proposals put forth, a certain
degree of discord seemed inevitable.
The conflicts which surfaced and
floated throughout the course of the
conference reflected not only the dif
ferences within the women's move
ment in general, but the variety of
opinions in the peace movement itself
as to which issues and strategies seem
most critical and appropriate at this

juncture in international relations.
The divergence of opinion and tac
tics represented at the conference
emerged in the first few hours, when
Titewhai Harawira, a Maori woman
from New Zealand, challenged the
whole setup of the conference as
being "false." She claimed that the
agenda ignored the concrete and im
mediate needs of indigenous women
in the Pacific who are having "jelly
babies" and dying as a result of nu
clear testing in the region right now.
Others agreed that women cannot af
ford to wait any longer for U.N.-
sponsored initiatives for disarmament
and peace to bear real fruit.
The stage for controversy over in
tegrationist versus separatist ap
proaches to women's struggles for
peace was set from the start with a
speech by Madame Therese Gastaut,
director of public information for the

United Nations, on the importance of
women attaining positions of power
in the U.N. agencies if they aim to
bring about peaceful reforms on any
significant scale.
Many women expressed an oppos
ing view that considers autonomous
women's organizations and actions to
be the most effective way for women
to find the support and momentum

they need to enact the progressive vi
sions they hold for peace and social
change. The perspectives and experi
ences of the Feminist Party of Spain,
the Women's Peace Camps of
Geneva and Greenham Common and
the Antinuclear Movement of Greek
Women were presented as successful
examples of autonomous experiments
in political action.
Ample time, however, was also
devoted to speculation and discourse
on ways to work with and within the
U.N. bodies, such as the multilateral
Conference on Disarmament (CD) in
Geneva. The women submitted a
declaration to the CD on March 7,
calling for the immediate negotiation
of four of the CD's agenda items: 1)
the prevention of nuclear war; 2) a
comprehensive test-ban treaty; 3) the
prevention of the arms race and nu
clear disarmament; and 4) a conven
tion prohibiting the production and
use of chemical weapons. Last year
the same demands were presented to
the CD by the Women and World
Disarmament Campaign Conference,
but no progress has been made in the
interim on any one of these agenda
items.
Other highlights of the conference
included the presentation of 30,000
post cards collected by Women For
Peace (Switzerland) to an official of
the United Nations, a letter sent to
Francois Mitterrand demanding that
France stop all nuclear testing in the
Pacific (on the Mururoa Atoll) and a
request submitted to the French
delegation to the CD that an investi
gation into the medical effects of such
testing be undertaken immediately.
One evening, three Salvadoran
women, members of the "Committee
of Mothers and Relatives of Political
Prisoners, Disappeared and Mur
dered from El Salvador, Oscar
Romero," described the kidnappings,

tortures, beatings and rapes they and
their families have suffered at the
hands of the Salvadoran military.
These women received the Robert
Kennedy Award for Human Rights
issued in the United States last year,
but they were denied visas on the al
legation that they posed a security
threat to the United States. A
telegram was unanimously approved
and sent to Secretary of State George
Schultz, protesting the State Depart
ment's refusal to allow these women
into the United States to attend the
award ceremony. The telegram also
demanded an immediate end to all
U.S. aid to EI Salvador's military
regime.

It was concluded that the solution
involved working against systemic
forces which dehumanize men and
women alike.

Informal workshops were also held
during the conference on the themes
of Nuclear Free Zones and Stopping
Nuclear Testing, Economic Develop
ment, Conversion and Peace,
Feminism and Peace, Racism and the
Search For Peace, Education and
Peace and Envisioning the Future in
Peace. Recommendations born of
these small group discussions will be
forwarded to the U.N. Conference on
Women in Nairobi this July.
Proposals included the establishment
of an International Women's Peace
Center in Geneva, the eradication of
sexist language from U.N. speeches
and documents, the support of Nu
clear Free Zone initiatives and the
boycott of products from South
Africa.
The real effects of past and present
fascism were impressed upon the par
ticipants of the conference by the
presence and stories of women like
Fascia Janssen, a survivor of a Nazi
concentration camp who led songs

and music at the reception for the
Salvadoran women, and Carmen del
Rio. who came to Geneva — at great
personal risk — to testify before the
U.N. Commission on Human Rights
about the practices of the Chilean
government.

On the whole, constructive
dialogue and action characterized the
conference despite the tensions felt
between those who espoused a
separatist orientation and those who
clung to integrationist strategies;
Raymond Martineau, non
governmental liaison officer for the
United Nations, offered the insight
that both feminist approaches and
methods must be pursued simultane-

ously if normative, procedural and
structural changes sought by women
working for peace are to be realized
any time in the near future.
Comments made in the Feminism
and Peace workshop also helped to
clarify this notion of bridging differ
ences among women's groups and
programs. The point was made that
women's groups must be careful not
to fall into the same mentality of nar
rowly defining an "enemy" — as
being men or persons in power —
that currently fuels the arms race, the
Cold War and the perpetuation of ag
gression against women and other
minorities around the world. It was
concluded that the solution involved
working against systemic forces which
dehumanize men and women alike
and concentrating on dismantling op
pressive structures, whether this be
done through uniquely female organ
izations or in mixed groups and insti
tutions.
