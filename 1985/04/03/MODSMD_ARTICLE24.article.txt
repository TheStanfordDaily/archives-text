## Stanford pulls away from San Jose, 8-5 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
Right fielders John Ramos and
Kevin Kunkel. Left fielders Mike
Deßenon and Fred Laningham. Des
ignated hitter Jeff Ballard.
These unlikely characters
combined with some familiar ones to
produce an 8-5 win yesterday against
San Jose State — Stanford's fourth
without a loss this year against the
Spartans.
The unusual lineup was not Stan
ford Coach Mark Marquess' idea of a
late April Fools' joke; the changes
were necessitated by the absence of
outfielders Toi Cook and Walt Har
ris, who temporarily left the diamond
for the gridiron as spring football
began.
Marquess wasn't too upset about
losing two .300-plus hitters to Jack
Elway for a day. "It's good for us,"
Marquess said. "It forces us to play
some other people."
However, both Cook and Harris
will be in baseball spikes instead of
football cleats this weekend when
Stanford battles California for first
place in the Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion.
After the Spartans had scratched
out a 1-0 lead in the first, the Card
inal went ahead to stay with a four
run fifth inning. Pete Stanicek started
it off with a single and went to third
on Ruben Amaro's base hit to left
center.
Mark Davis followed with a chop
per in front of the plate that Spartan
starter Steve Olson threw away for an
error. Rick Lundblade then slapped

an 0-2 pitch into right that scored
Amaro and ended the day for Olson.
After Ramos drove in the third run
with a single to right off reliever An
thony Telford, an error by shortstop
John Capuzelo allowed Lundblade to
cross the plate.
In the seventh, the Cardinal ex
tended its lead to 7-1 with the help of
three more Spartan miscues.
Deßenon reached base on an error,
and Laningham ran for him. Lanin
gham immediately went to third on
an errant pickoff attempt by Telford.
Ramos then tried to squeeze
Laningham home, but the ball eluded
his bat. Unfortunately for the Spar
tans, it also eluded catcher Don
Griesemar long enough for Lanin
gham to slide home safely.
Another error by Capuzelo
prolonged the inning, giving Ballard
the opportunity to stroke a two-run
double to left-center. "It should have
been a triple," said Ballard, who was
thrown out trying to make it one.
"I'm just too slow out of the box."
Next to Stanford's bizarre lineup
maneuvers, the story of the day was
errors. There were 10 of them, seven
by San Jose State. However,
Marquess came to the fielders'
defense. "The field was rough," he
said. "Besides, there were a lot of
tough chances."
Laningham scored the Cardinal's
final run in the ninth when he walked
and stole second. He was driven
home by Kunkel's — yes, Kunkel's —
RBI single to left. Kunkel, who went
into right field after pitching two in
nings, took advantage of his rare op

portunity on the basepaths by
promptly stealing second.
Kunkel was glad to get the steal
sign from Marquess. "Anyone loves
to run,"he said. "But I heard my
slide was horrendous."
