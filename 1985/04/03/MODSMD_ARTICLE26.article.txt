# Cardinal sweats through 1st spring practice
## 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
It's one of those annual rites of
spring. The temperature rises. Lake
Lagunita fills, shorts and tank tops
replace parkas, Wilbur Field fills with
sun worshippers, and the Stanford
football team puts on the pads and
hits the field for five weeks of spring
practice.
"For the first day, they did just
fine," Defensive Coordinator Dick
Mannini said after yesterday's initial
practice. " They picked up where they
left off, and they're just as hard
working."
The team is practicing every Tues
day, Wednesday and Thursday from
3 to 5 p.m., and will scrimmage Satur
day mornings beginning at 9 a.m. The
practice fields are located behind
Maples Pavilion.
Spring football will culminate with
the Alumni Game May 5. Last year's
initial contest brought back former
Stanford players and coaches like Jim
Plunkett, John Elway, Vincent
White, James Lofton and Bill Walsh.
Mannini said the players held up
well in full gear under the sun and 80-
degree heat. "(Strength Coach) Steve
Schulz did a super job with them in
winter training," he said. "Most of
them were in great shape."
The concern with the 1985 Card
inal is the inexperience of the offen
sive and defensive lines. Tackle John
Barns is the only returner on offense,
and the top five defensive linemen
are graduating as well.
"They're young kids, and they're
going to make some mistakes," Man
nini said. "It's a brand new one (on
defense), with no one returning.

We'll have to look at the strongest
group to get them to do what they do
best."
Three football players had to can
cel another commitment to be at
practice. Defensive backs Toi Cook
and Walt Harris and linebacker Mark
Machtolf all play baseball as well, and
missed yesterday's game with San
Jose State in order to practice.
"It's a nice little break from
baseball," Cook said. "It really
doesn't bother me as long as it
doesn't hurt the baseball team." The
Cardinal beat the Spartans 8-5.
Mannini said quarterback John
Paye, who missed half of last season
with injuries to his throwing hand,
was passing well yesterday. Another
key Cardinal, linebacker Dave
Wyman, will have a longer road to
recovery.
Wyman suffered severe damage to
the ligaments in his knee against
Arizona in the 10th game of last
season and underwent extensive sur
gery to repair the damage.
Though Wyman is still a long way
from getting back to the business of
hitting ballcarriers, Mannini said,
"He's so far ahead of where anyone
thought he'd be, it's scary. He'll prob
ably redshirt, though he probably
doesn't think so."
"What I'm going to do is be as
ready as I can for this fall," Wyman
said. "I can run on it, but playing
football on it is the ultimate test. I
can't go out there on it now.
"I kind of think I might redshirt
and give it another year. I've been
talking to a lot of people, and I think
it might be a good idea. I'm going to
try to make a career out of football."

his Stanford football players yesterday â€” in more ways than one. Here,
