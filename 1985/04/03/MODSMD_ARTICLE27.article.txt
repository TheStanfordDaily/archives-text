# Tennis teams look for wins at Berkeley
## Men 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's tennis team
will finish its postponed match with
California today at 1:30 p.m. The
original match, begun at Berkeley
one week ago, was stopped midway in
the singles matches because of rain.
The match will resume with Stan
ford ahead by a set in two matches,
and serving for the first set in two
other matches. Stanford's No. 1
player, Dan Goldie, is serving at 4-5
in his first set against Cal's top player,
No. 87-ranked Steve DeVries.
Although Stanford, according to
Coach Dick Gould and veteran team
members, should not have much diffi
culty beating unranked Cal, past
matches between Stanford and Cal
have not lacked much in the way of
excitement.
"On paper we should win easily,"
said John Letts, who plays No. 5
singles and No. 3 doubles for the
Cardinal. "We've had some scares,
though. In the last couple of matches
with Cal we've fallen behind 3-1 or 3-
0 in the singles before coming back to
win."
Gould is pleased with the start his
team has in the first Pacific 10 Con
ference meeting between these two
teams this season.
"The key at this point is to sustain
the intensity and keep the good
playing going," Gould said.
