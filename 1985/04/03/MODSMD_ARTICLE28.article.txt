The Stanford women's tennis team,
evidently fully recovered from last
week's loss to USC, travels to
Berkeley's Channing Courts today to
take on California.
The Cardinal. 16-1 overall and
ranked second nationally, defeated
Cal earlier this season, thrashing the
Bears 7-0 in a darkness-shortened
match at Stanford.
This afternoon's return engage
ment may he as lopsided. The Bears'
No. 5 singles player. Jill Barr, has
pneumonia, and their No. 4 netter,
Colette Kavanagh, is listed as ques
tionable with a knee injury.
However, since the teams met in
February, Cal has improved. The
eighth-ranked Bears are 18-7 overall
and 6-0 in the Northern Pacific Con
ference, including victories over
sixth-ranked San Diego State and
lOth-ranked UCLA.
If Cal wins any matches today,
those wins will probably come at the
top of the ladder. Freshman Jennifer
Prah is ranked 18th nationally and
junior Heather Ettus is two notches
lower. Stacy Savides, whose sister
Stephanie plays for Stanford, pairs
with Julie Grummel to make up the
Bears' No. 1 doubles team.
Match time is 2 p.m.

No sibling showdown today — Stanford's Stephanie Savides will play in
the No. 3 doubles match, while her sister Stacy will co-anchor Cal's No.
1 doubles team.
