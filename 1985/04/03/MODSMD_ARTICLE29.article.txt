# USC spikers visit Maples

A rested Cardinal men's volleyball
team hosts No. 2 USC tonight in a
league match that begins at 7:30 in
Maples Pavilion.
Stanford, 21-7 overall and ranked
fifth in the latest national poll, returns
home after last week's grueling four
game road trip through the south
land. The swing saw the men play
four matches in six days.
While the Cardinal split those away
matches — losing to Pepperdine and
UC-Santa Barbara and downing C'al
State-Northridge and Loyola
Marymount — it slipped from fourth
to fifth place in the California Inter
collegiate Volleyball Association
standings.
Saturday's match with Santa Bar
bara was played for fourth place. The
Gauchos started the evening a half
game behind the Cardinal, but after
their four-set triumph (7-15, 15-13,
15-4, 15-9) Santa Barbara, 8-4 in
CIVA, sat alone in fourth.
Cardinal Co-coach Don Shaw felt
that fatigue was a factor in the UCSB
match. "Maybe a day's rest and it
might have been different," Shaw
speculated. "We won that first game,
but when the momentum turned we
weren't able to reach within ourselves
for that little extra."
Nagging injuries further hampered
the Cardinal. Freshman Scott
Fortune was slowed by a gimpy knee,
and junior Jon Root and senior Craig
Lauchner suffered from respiratory
tlu. A lack of depth — the men use
seven or eight players at the most —

may have finally caught up with Stan
ford. "Those things (injuries) really
take their toll during the course of the
season," Shaw said.
Though his team fell a notch in the
league standings after the Santa Bar
bara debacle, Shaw was somewhat
satisfied with the week's perfor
mances. "We feel pretty good about
going 4-4 on the road this season,"
Shaw said.
Stanford won two of four games on
its other protracted road trip earlier
this season. Last week, Shaw said,
"we were looking for a split and we
got it.
"Whenever a team can split its
away matches and take care of the
home games, then that team should
be in the playoffs."
Having already accomplished a
split of its road games, the Cardinal
must now work for a sweep of its four
remaining home contests. Stanford's
task is complicated, though, because
two of the men's opponents, USC
tonight and UCLA next Wednesday,
stand ahead of the Cardinal in the
CIVA.
Stanford will have its hands full
with USC. The squads have met twice
this year, each taking one match. The
Cardinal surprised the Trojans late
January with a two-sets-to-one vic
tory in the semifinals of the UCSB
Collegiate Invitational. USC got its
revenge 1 1 days later, blanking the
Cardinal in a league contest, 15-9,
15-12, 15-10.
