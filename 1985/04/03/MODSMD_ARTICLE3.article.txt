# Commission on investments to get part-time staffer
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Editorial staff 
In response to an earlier request by the
Commission on Investment Responsibility
(C-IR), the University has announced that it
will appoint a part-time staff worker to aid in
combating the commission's work load.
Commission members reacted both
positively and negatively to the University's
decision.
C-IR Chairman Richard Brody said he was
"very pleased" with the appointment, noting
that "it underscores the University's commit
ment to be responsible" about its investment
policies.
Brody. a political science professor, said the

added resource would allow the C-IR to take
the initiative in examining the University's in
vestments.
According to University Treasurer Rod
Adams, the staff member will devote 20 to 30
percent of his time to the C-IR. The rest of his
time will be spent doing other work for the
University relating to its investments. Adams
said the staff member should be hired by mid-
May, in time to meet with the commission
before it breaks for the summer.
Mark Landesmann, a student representa
tive on the C-IR, said he was "highly disap
pointed" with the University's decision.
Landesmann said 30 percent of a staff
member's resources will be better than noth

ing, but will not be enough for the C-IR to
conduct effectively a case-by-case examina
tion of the University's investments.
ASSU Senator Jon Adelstein also ex
pressed displeasure with the decision to allot
the commission one-third of a staff member's
time. "It is painfully inadequate," Adelstein
said. Adelstein has co-sponsored many South
Africa-related bills with Landesmann in the
senate this school year.
Adelstein was also unhappy that the staff
member will be working for the University on
its investments when not working for the C
IR. That situation, he said, makes a staff
member "inherently biased."
Brody said he rejects the idea that the staff

member's affiliation with the University's in
vestments will cause a conflict. Rather, he
said, it will be beneficial because he will be
familar with the portfolio that the C-IR will
be examining.
Landesmann said there would be benefits
to familiarity with the portfolio, but said he
would prefer that the staff member be com
pletely independent to ensure objectivity.
Aside from the objection to the staff mem
ber's potential bias, lioth Adelstein and Lan
desmann said the University did not allot the
C-IR enough help. The demands of a case-by
case examination of the University's portfolio
is too great a task with only 30 percent of a
staff member, according to Adelstein.

Landesmann said the committee would re
quire either a further increase in resources or
a streamlining of the divestment decision
making process to perform its duties effec
tively.
"We will have to make a fundamental
reassessment of the University's stance on in
vestment policy," Landesmann said.
Adelstein said the assignment of 30 percent
of a staff member was symptomatic of a lack
of commitment on the part of the University.
He said he would not count out some form of
student protest similar to those held over
apartheid last quarter.
