# Softballers host Bruins

Tough competition was the name of the
game tor the Stanford Softball team at the
Texas A&M Invitational last weekend, and
it doesn't look as if it will get easier for the
Cardinal.
Stanford, which won one of nine games in
the Texas A&\l round-robin tourney, plays
host to defending national champion UCLA
in a double-header beginning at 2 p.m. today
at Roble Field. And the Bruins, 14-1, still
have key players who led the way to a 45-6-
1 season in 19N4.
Last year, UCLA pitcher Debbie Doom
won the Broderick Award, symbolic of the
country's best female collegiate softball
player, and she doesn't appear to have suf
fered a letdown. Doom is 7-0 with a 0.14
earned run average. In 52 innings, she has
struck out 59 batters and given up only two

walks.
However, conceding to Doom and waiting
for another pitcher could be a mistake,
should the Cardinal decide to do so. Tracy
Compton is ft-1. has a 0.30 ERA and has 51
strikeouts in 47 innings.
Today's games mark the first of eight
Stanford will play through Saturday, six of
which are on the road. After traveling to Cal
Poly-Pomona tomorrow, Stanford will play
Western Collegiate Athletic Association
double-headers at Arizona State Friday and
at Arizona Saturday.
UCI.A. which lost to Hawaii in the Rain
bows' tournament last week, outscored its
four opponents there 12-3. The Bruins are
led by outfielder Tricia Mang. who is hitting
.298 and leads UCLA with 12 RBIs. Last
season, as a freshman, Mang's 13th-inning
home run gave the Bruins a 1-0 victory over
Texas A&M in the national title game.
