# NCAA adopts shot clock

### 
LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) — Shoot it or lose it,
the NCAA Men's Basketball Rules Committee
decided.
The panel's decision last night means Monday
night's championship game — won by Villanova,
master of the delay game — will be the last with
out the 45-second shot clock. The clock — forc
ing teams to shoot or forfeit the ball within 45
seconds of taking possession — will stay on the
whole game, all season long.
Twenty-five conferences — 19 of them Divi
sion I — experimented with the clock this
season, but it was not used in the NCAA Tourn
ament. The Pacific 10 Conference, in which
Stanford plays, did not use the clock this year.
During a wrap-up meeting after the Final

Four in Lexington, the Rules Committee also
stiffened penalties for intentional fouls, banned
printed matter on T-shirts and made it a rule
that the score is final once a referee leaves the
floor after a game.
That had been an interpretation of the rules
for years, said Edward Steitz, secretary-editor of
the committee. The committee made it official
after confusion resulted in a victory being
awarded to, taken away from and then given
back to West Virginia.
All rules changes must be approved by at least
eight of the 12 committee members. Steitz
would say only that the vote on the clock "was
not close." Last year, the shot clock was rejected
by a narrow margin.
