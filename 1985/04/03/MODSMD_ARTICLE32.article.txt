## Strong acting cannot save bad script in 'Husbandry' 
### NANCY HENRY 
There is no question that the economic predicament of
American farmers, the ecological decay of American
farmland, and the changing familial values of American
culture are critical and controversial issues which
playwrights must treat and the public must face. The play
"Husbandry," showing through April 21 at the Eureka
Theatre in San Francisco, attempts to address each of
these problems and to show how they are linked in the
lives of one typical family. Unfortunately, Patrick Tovatt's
script seems to emphasize only that these are indeed sepa
rate themes — and that a more tightly structured and
clearly focused plot is needed to bring to light the serious
ness of each.
Harry and Dee are the prototypical, strait-laced,
hard-working farm couple who lives the life that every
one, including their son, Les, and daughter-in-law, Bev,
love to romanticize about, but could never imitate. Up at
5, milk the cows, tend the field; their routine varies only
when the children or grandchildren, about whom they
constantly reminisce, come to visit. Their simple but com
fortable and stable existence is disrupted by the delayed
impact of government regulations which forced them into
methods of farming that devalue the land and render it al
most impossible for them to continue farming and by the
waning help of Harry who can no longer maintain the
farm alone. Their desperate and seemingly natural solu
tion is to demand, first subtly and then unreservedly, that
their son, long moved to the city with a career-minded
wife and two children. These very general and vague con
flicts are introduced during the course of a very normal,
very realistic evening of conversation between the worried
parents and the confused younger couple.
One of the problems, in fact, one that contributes to the
play's lack of basic dramatic technique, is that the
dialogue — in both subject and style — is mundane and
uninteresting; idle talk about the best home-baked bis
cuits in the world, the great aunt that moved to the city,
the water faucet in the tub, rather than adding a touch of
sentiment or realistic detail, merely serves to clutter the
plot with irrelevant nostalgia. The "homey" talk is inter
spersed with completely unexpected and ill-placed poetic
reveries about the way life was, about the condition of the
land and what we are doing to it — speeches that belong
in the infinitely more effective essays of Wendell Berry,
the Kentucky environmentalist whose writings have no
doubt influenced the play.

The problem is precisely that we do not know what the
real conflict is. Is it that the government has incom
petently and unfairly interfered with the farmers, treating
them as mere pawns in the game of international and eco
nomic affairs? Is it that for the past 40 years the land has
been abused to such an extent that the independent
farmer as we once knew him will cease to exist? Or is it
that, while once a son would not have hesitated to come to
the aid of his family, devote his life to carrying on a tradi
tion of generations — which Les (who has more sense of
duty and family than one would expect from the average
modern son) is simply not willing to do without much soul
searching? Certainly the drama of the situation stems
from a combination of these things; yet in order to create
a successful play, one that will hold our attention, the con
flict cannot be so lacking in focus. Not that ambiguity in it
self is a fault, but when a play is so self-consciously trying
to address pertinent issues, it must introduce and build to
a conflict. Its dialogue must have a purpose, and the char
acters must be more than realistic.
The performances in this play are discouragingly
wasted, for they are all exceptional. The tension and emo
tion that is generated on stage emanates amazingly from
the actors themselves as they deliver lines that are
curiously void of poignancy when considered alone.
Abigail Van Alyn's strong-willed, motherly, but helplessly
irrational Dee is a believable and powerful character.
Sigrid Wurschmidt as Bev has not the strength of a farm
wife, but is equally determined in defending her lifesyle
and equally irrational when her child is ill. The men are
less volatile but exhibit a seething internal energy that is
repressed by virtue of their maleness and which contri
butes to the chemistry between characters which seems
isolated and out of place in a weak dramatic structure
which will not support such heavy emotions. The set, de
signed by Ron Pratt and Gene Angell, deserves specific
mention. Beautifully realistic, it creates the romantic am
biance of the quaint but practical farmhouse which is so
appropriate for the story.
The issues raised in this drama are significant and
legitimate social concerns. Understandably, the Eureka
saw a need to present them artistically, but this play
demonstrates that in the theater, important ideas, even
strong performances will not hold a work together; the
ideas must be given form or they will go unnoticed and
their importance will be undermined.

plays through April 21 at the Eureka Theatre in San Francisco.
