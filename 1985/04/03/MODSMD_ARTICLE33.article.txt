# 'King David': lackluster, uninspiring

### GREGORY WEINGARTEN Editorial staff 
"King David." the latest star vehi
cle for actor Richard Gere, is rather
uncharacteristic of the pictures
usually associated with the American
film star. Don't expect to see Gere,
who stars in the title role, plying his
goods on the likes of Lauren Hutton

Gere never really manages to evoke
the emotional intensity necessary to
convey the greatness and sheer
magnetism that characterized the
legendary leader.

or Debra Winger in this one. "King
David," directed by Bruce Beresford
("Tender Mercies," "Breaker
Morant") contains no steamy
romance scenes, but attempts to fol
low in a dry, historical manner the life
of the second king of Israel, David,
as reported in I and II Samuel and I
Ch ro nicies.
Gere's performance in the film is
good, but like the picture itself, Gere
never really manages to evoke the
emotional intensity necessary to con

vey the greatness and sheer mag
netism that characterized the legen
dary leader. One is left at the end of
the film without any feeling or under
standing for the biblical king.
In addtion, virtually all the actors,
except Gere, in 'King David" were
British and Australian — their flaw
less accents (they sounded as if they

were on leave from the the Royal
British Shakespeare Company)
clashed noticeably with Gere's at
tempt to Anglicize his American
speech. This inconsistency is made
even more glaring by the fact that the
younger King David is played by a
British actor, lan Sears. The acting,
though, on the whole, is good, yet no
one, with the exceptions of the
prophet Samuel (Dennis Quilley) and
King Saul (Edward Woodward),
manages to stand out; this is perhaps

due not so much to the actors as to
the script, which never allows
anyone's character to develop suffi
ciently.
In one sense, Beresford, who has
proven himself to be a skilful direc
tor, should be lauded for not resort
ing to the usual Hollywood-style sen
sationalism that one so often as
sociates with "sand and sandals"
epics (just check out NBCs "A.D."
for an example). The film is not ex
cessively opulent in the style of Cecil
B. DeMille; there are no played-up
bedroom scenes; there are, however,
some violent battle scenes, but even
they are used for the sake of realism
rather than the exploitive goriness so
pervasive in Hollywood productions.
(The squeamish, nevertheless, should
take note that "King David' contains
a fair number of decapitations and
hit-and-run chariot-mashing epi
sodes.)
Beresford's painstaking attention
to detail and avoidance of sen
sationalism are commendable. One
gets the feeling when one is viewing
"King David" that one is seeing the
ancient period in which the story is
set as it must have actually appeared
— a harsh, desert existence on the
fringes of civilization. The garb of the
Israelites and the Philistines looks au
thentic, as do their dwellings. Beres
ford tells the story of David in a flat,
historical fashion as it might have oc

curred. Somehow, though, the
filmmaker's attempt to be accurate
and chronological ultimately makes
the film drawn-out, uninspiring, and,
quite frankly, boring.
The film ambitiously tries to show
the whole life of King David in two
hours which go by very slowly — the
resulting product is a film that could
be called "The Best of King David."
We see David from his boyhood
through old age. In between are the
"highlights" from his life, including
the young David's battle with the
giant Goliath (who takes on rather
mortal proportions in Beresford's at
tempt to play down the sensational),
his marriage to King Saul's daughter,
his flight from the jealous Saul, his
legendary marriage to Bathsheba,
who is played by the striking Alice
Krige, and his feud with his son Ab
salom (Jean-Marc Barr).
The cursory, historical manner in
which these elements of David's life
are related fail to work together. The
only subplot that is developed, albeit
minimally, is the feud between David
and the aging King Saul. Unfortun
ately, David himself never quite
emerges as a fully developed charac
ter. The viewer is left with an empty
feeling by the end of the film, without
any compassion, understanding or
wonderment for David the individual
or king.
