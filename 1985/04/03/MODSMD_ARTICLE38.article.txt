heart attack" on Friday morning, ac
cording to his wife, Rachelle Mar

"Everybody's hoping he'll be out
on Friday," his wife said last night.
He'll be back to work "within three
or four weeks, no question about
that," she added.
In addition to receiving many notes
and phone calls, Marshall has been
inundated with flowers.
Marshall was scheduled to teach
only one course this quarter, a politi

responsibility. The seminar has been
canceled.
