U.S. denounces Soviet 'Star Wars'
WASHINGTON — The Soviet Union is protesting President
Reagan's "Star Wars" initiative only because it has launched a gigantic,
similar effort of its own and wants to preserve a monopoly in the area of
high-tech warfare, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said yester
day.
**What I'm trying to portray is what we know to be the facts,"
Weinberger said in releasing the Pentagon s fourth annual report on So
viet military power/" And that is that the Soviets are working, have been
working for a long time — longer than we have — on defensive sys
tems."
The Soviets are campaigning against the American effort to develop
an anti-missile system that could be deployed in space "because they are
doing it themselves and they want to be left alone to do it,"he contin
ued.
"They're very clearly pointed toward acquiring the precise kind of ca
pability that they not only deride but argue is so terribly destabilizing
and dangerous. And from their point of view, it probably is, because it
would mean it would break their monopoly," the secretary said.
Weinberger's comments, which were beamed by satellite to Europe
and Japan, were offered in an hour-long briefing during which he recited
numerous other examples of what he called the Soviets' relentless drive
to increase and modernize their weapons.
The slick, 143-page edition of "Soviet Military Power 1985," bound
in a red cover and crammed with photos, charts and drawings, elaborates
by reporting the emergence of new ballistic and cruise missiles; construc
tion of much more capable submarines and fighter and bomber aircraft;
an increase in the size of ground forces; and a military space effort that
includes development of a heavy-lift rocket, a space shuttle and a
smaller "space plane" that could be used to defend manned space sta
tions.
"They continue to press ahead with modernization of all elements of
their strategic and conventional forces," Weinberger said.
It is in the area of Star Wars research, however, that the 1985 report
strikes new ground, focusng on Soviet efforts at a time when Reagan has
asked Congress to provide $3.7 billion for research in fiscal 1986 alone.
U.S. attacks Japan's trade barriers
WASHINGTON — Capitol Hill pressure on the Japanese to drop
trade barriers intensified yesterday as a Senate panel approved manda- „
tory tariffs and quotas unless new markets are opened to U.S. goods.
"We need to open up and get back to something that resembles free
trade," Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Texas) declared as the Senate Finance
Committee approved the measure 12-4.
As the panel acted, the House prepared to take up a non-binding ver
sion similar to one approved by the Senate last week.
House Speaker Thomas "Tip"-O'Neill (D-Mass.) told reporters he
urged U.S. Ambassador Mike Mansfield by telephone earlier yesterday
to tell Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone that "they better
make some concessions or they've got trouble."
In the phone conversation, O'Neill said, Mansfield reported progress
in efforts to open the Japanese market to American telecommunications
equipment. But the speaker said the envoy reported that an array of
problems remained in other trade areas.
The United States is pressing for access to sell billions of dollars worth
of telecommunications switching equipment to Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone, a state monopoly being transformed into a private corpora
tion. j
The Senate's latest measure would force President Reagan to retaliate
with tariffs and quotas unless he could obtain compensation for the full
extent of alleged Japanese "unfair trade practjCc&'^y,,..,
The committee chairman. Sen. Robert PackvJoodXß-Ore.) said he ex
pected the measure to become law if the House Ways and Means Com
mittee "reports out anything at all" in a similar vein.
Packwood said, however, he was unsure if such a statute could be en
forced in the courts if the administration refused to act on it aggressively.
Criticism of the White House for not using the trade powers without
prompting is mounting on Capitol Hill.
Israeli prisoners moved or released
BEIRUT, Lebanon — The Israeli army began closing the Ansar
prison camp in southern Lebanon yesterday and the military command
said more than 600 of the prisoners would be released.
Israeli radio reported that 1,200 of the Shiite Moslem and Palestinian
prisoners at Ansar were being transferred to Israel and the camp dis
mantled as part of the second phase of the Israeli withdrawal from
Lebanon.
The military command in Tel Aviv said the prisoners being moved
were "being temporarily transferred to a detention facility in Israel."
Lt. Gen. Moshe Levy, the Israeli chief of staff, told Israel radio that
more than 600 prisoners will be released starting today.
An army-announcement suggested other prisoners might be released
if Shiite Moslem attacks on Israeli soldiers diminished. The army "will
release the detainees in accordance with developments in south
Lebanon" as the army withdraws, the announcement said.
The Israelis invaded Lebanon in 1982 and Israeli troops are expected
to complete their withdrawal by late May or early June. The Shiite Mos
lems have stepped up attacks on the Israelis. About 220 attacks on Is
raeli soldiers in March killed 19 Israeli soldiers. Two Israeli soldiers
were killed in the first two days of April by guerrilla ambushes and
bombs.
Villagers in south Lebanon said the Israeli army started moving
prisoners from the Ansar camp yesterday morning.
Defense favored in Aquino trial
MANILA, Philippines — Early court rulings, the failure of key wit
nesses to appear, and much of the testimony in the Benigno Aquino as
sassination trial have so far favored the defense.
After five weeks and 46 witnesses, the prosecution has failed to un
cover a significant new fact against Armed Forces chief Gen. Fabian Ver
or the other 25 defendants.
Much of the evidence uncovered by a fact-finding board that recom
mended the indictments has entered the court record without being pre
sented in open trial. The defense, invoking rights against self
incrimination. has filed motions to exclude the volumes of testimony by
the accused themselves.
Prosecutors say they are still confident of building a strong case of mil
itary conspiracy in the Aug. 21, 1983 double murder of top opposition
leader Aquino and Rolando Galman, the man the military said killed
him. Only one of the defendants is a civilian.
But chief prosecutor Manuel Herrera complains the trial has been
going at a "dizzying tempo" and protested last week that prosecutors
have been subject to "warnings, reprimands and contempt proceedings
as compared to the nil situation for the defense."
The court has ruled favorably on defense motions to drop the name of
Ver from the case's official title, to keep accused soldiers not entitled to
bail under military custody instead of in civilian jails and not to require
the accused to be present at every stage of the trial.
French kidnap victim freed .
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Gillcs Sidney Peyrollcs, head of the French
cultural center in Lebanon's northern port of Tripoli, was released un
harmed, 10 days after being abducted, the French Embassy said yester
day.
"He was released some time during the night," said embassy spokes
man Francois Abi Saab. "He is in good health. I have talked to him on
the phone."
The spokesman declined to say where Peyrolles, 32, was staying after
his release.

Israeli radio reported that 1,200 of the Shiite Moslem and Palestinian
prisoners at Ansar were being transferred to Israel and the camp dis
mantled as part of the second phase of the Israeli withdrawal from
Lebanon.
The military command in Tel Aviv said the prisoners being moved
were "being temporarily transferred to a detention facility in Israel."
Lt. Gen. Moshe Levy, the Israeli chief of staff, told Israel radio that
more than 600 prisoners will be released starting today.
An army-announcement suggested other prisoners might be released
if Shiite Moslem attacks on Israeli soldiers diminished. The army "will
release the detainees in accordance with developments in south
Lebanon" as the army withdraws, the announcement said.
The Israelis invaded Lebanon in 1982 and Israeli troops are expected
to complete their withdrawal by late May or early June. The Shiite Mos
lems have stepped up attacks on the Israelis. About 220 attacks on Is
raeli soldiers in March killed 19 Israeli soldiers. Two Israeli soldiers
were killed in the first two days of April by guerrilla ambushes and
bombs.
Villagers in south Lebanon said the Israeli army started moving
prisoners from the Ansar camp yesterday morning.
Defense favored in Aquino trial
MANILA, Philippines — Early court rulings, the failure of key wit
nesses to appear, and much of the testimony in the Benigno Aquino as
sassination trial have so far favored the defense.
After five weeks and 46 witnesses, the prosecution has failed to un
cover a significant new fact against Armed Forces chief Gen. Fabian Ver
or the other 25 defendants.
Much of the evidence uncovered by a fact-finding board that recom
mended the indictments has entered the court record without being pre
sented in open trial. The defense, invoking rights against self
incrimination. has filed motions to exclude the volumes of testimony by
the accused themselves.
Prosecutors say they are still confident of building a strong case of mil
itary conspiracy in the Aug. 21, 1983 double murder of top opposition
leader Aquino and Rolando Galman, the man the military said killed
him. Only one of the defendants is a civilian.
But chief prosecutor Manuel Herrera complains the trial has been
going at a "dizzying tempo" and protested last week that prosecutors
have been subject to "warnings, reprimands and contempt proceedings
as compared to the nil situation for the defense."
The court has ruled favorably on defense motions to drop the name of
Ver from the case's official title, to keep accused soldiers not entitled to
bail under military custody instead of in civilian jails and not to require
the accused to be present at every stage of the trial.
French kidnap victim freed .
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Gillcs Sidney Peyrollcs, head of the French
cultural center in Lebanon's northern port of Tripoli, was released un
harmed, 10 days after being abducted, the French Embassy said yester
day.
"He was released some time during the night," said embassy spokes
man Francois Abi Saab. "He is in good health. I have talked to him on
the phone."
The spokesman declined to say where Peyrolles, 32, was staying after
his release.
U.S. denounces Soviet 'Star Wars'
WASHINGTON — The Soviet Union is protesting President
Reagan's "Star Wars" initiative only because it has launched a gigantic,
similar effort of its own and wants to preserve a monopoly in the area of
high-tech warfare, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said yester
day.
**What I'm trying to portray is what we know to be the facts,"
Weinberger said in releasing the Pentagon s fourth annual report on So
viet military power/" And that is that the Soviets are working, have been
working for a long time — longer than we have — on defensive sys
tems."
The Soviets are campaigning against the American effort to develop
an anti-missile system that could be deployed in space "because they are
doing it themselves and they want to be left alone to do it,"he contin
ued.
"They're very clearly pointed toward acquiring the precise kind of ca
pability that they not only deride but argue is so terribly destabilizing
and dangerous. And from their point of view, it probably is, because it
would mean it would break their monopoly," the secretary said.
Weinberger's comments, which were beamed by satellite to Europe
and Japan, were offered in an hour-long briefing during which he recited
numerous other examples of what he called the Soviets' relentless drive
to increase and modernize their weapons.
The slick, 143-page edition of "Soviet Military Power 1985," bound
in a red cover and crammed with photos, charts and drawings, elaborates
by reporting the emergence of new ballistic and cruise missiles; construc
tion of much more capable submarines and fighter and bomber aircraft;
an increase in the size of ground forces; and a military space effort that
includes development of a heavy-lift rocket, a space shuttle and a
smaller "space plane" that could be used to defend manned space sta
tions.
"They continue to press ahead with modernization of all elements of
their strategic and conventional forces," Weinberger said.
It is in the area of Star Wars research, however, that the 1985 report
strikes new ground, focusng on Soviet efforts at a time when Reagan has
asked Congress to provide $3.7 billion for research in fiscal 1986 alone.
U.S. attacks Japan's trade barriers
WASHINGTON — Capitol Hill pressure on the Japanese to drop
trade barriers intensified yesterday as a Senate panel approved manda- „
tory tariffs and quotas unless new markets are opened to U.S. goods.
"We need to open up and get back to something that resembles free
trade," Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Texas) declared as the Senate Finance
Committee approved the measure 12-4.
As the panel acted, the House prepared to take up a non-binding ver
sion similar to one approved by the Senate last week.
House Speaker Thomas "Tip"-O'Neill (D-Mass.) told reporters he
urged U.S. Ambassador Mike Mansfield by telephone earlier yesterday
to tell Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone that "they better
make some concessions or they've got trouble."
In the phone conversation, O'Neill said, Mansfield reported progress
in efforts to open the Japanese market to American telecommunications
equipment. But the speaker said the envoy reported that an array of
problems remained in other trade areas.
The United States is pressing for access to sell billions of dollars worth
of telecommunications switching equipment to Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone, a state monopoly being transformed into a private corpora
tion. j
The Senate's latest measure would force President Reagan to retaliate
with tariffs and quotas unless he could obtain compensation for the full
extent of alleged Japanese "unfair trade practjCc&'^y,,..,
The committee chairman. Sen. Robert PackvJoodXß-Ore.) said he ex
pected the measure to become law if the House Ways and Means Com
mittee "reports out anything at all" in a similar vein.
Packwood said, however, he was unsure if such a statute could be en
forced in the courts if the administration refused to act on it aggressively.
Criticism of the White House for not using the trade powers without
prompting is mounting on Capitol Hill.
Israeli prisoners moved or released

prison camp in southern Lebanon yesterday and the military command
