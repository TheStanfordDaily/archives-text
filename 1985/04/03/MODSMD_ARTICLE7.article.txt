# Soviet leader agrees to summit

### 
WASHINGTON — Soviet leader Mikhail Gor
bachev has "agreed in principle" to a summit
meeting with President Reagan, but the time and
place still must be worked out, a senior U.S. official
said yesterday.
Two possible sites and times are Helsinki, Fin
land, in August, and the United Nations in New
York in September, the official, who insisted on
anonymity, told The Associated Press.
It would be the first U.S.-Soviet summit since
1979, when former President Jimmy Carter and the
late Leonid Brezhnev signed the second Strategic
Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT II) to reduce some
kinds of nuclear weapons.
The two sides are stockpiling other missiles,
however, and have been unable to agree on ways to
stop their arms race. In declaring it was "high time"
for a summit, Reagan said at his last news confer

ence two weeks ago that he would try to quicken
the pace of negotiations now being held in Geneva,
Switzerland, if he met with Gorbachev.
But Reagan and the U.S. official said the agenda
would range beyond weapons to include other is
sues, as well. Among them, presumably, are human
rights, which the Soviets pledged to improve when
they and 34 other countries, including the United
States, signed the Helsinki agreement in the Fin
nish capital in 1975.
Reagan has frequently criticized the Soviets'
record. The Helsinki agreement will be marked by
a 10-year anniversary observance on Aug. 1. It is
an important accord for the Soviets since it
climaxed more than a decade of effort to confirm
their influence in Eastern Europe.
The president's spokesman, Larry Speakes, told
reporters "there have been no discussions about ar

rangements for a summit, no meeting set, no time
set, nothing along those lines."
Speakes added: "Nothing has taken place now
and I don't know of any specific plans for any
meetings or arrangments."
Reagan, in an Oval Office interview Monday
with The Washington Post, refused to discuss the
contents of Gorbachev's letter but said he was
"hopeful" that a summit could be held. Other ad
ministration officials were similarly tight-lipped.
"I wrote, and he (Gorbachev) answered, and
we're in negotiations, and we'll just leave it like
that," the president said.
Asked Tuesday whether he was encouraged by
the letter, Reagan said, "It's always encouraging to
get a letter." When asked whether he had sent
Gorbachev a letter in return, he said, "I just got
his."
