JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
â€” Violence flared in at least seven
townships in the eastern Cape Prov
ince before dawn yesterday. A year
old baby was burned to death in one
black enclave after rioters with a
gasoline bomb set the house afire,
police said.
In Johannesburg, about 40
demonstrators crowded into the
headquarters of Citibank, protesting
what they called the "indifference" of
the American bank and foreign firms
to the killings of blacks by police.
Police said black townships in the
Eastern Cape had calmed later in the
day after 10 days of bloodshed that
have left at least 39 blacks dead.
Nineteen of the dead were marchers
shot by police outside the industrial
center of Uitenhage on March 21.
A spokesman at Pretoria police
headquarters said the baby died

during the night when rioters threw a
bomb into a house in the Veeplaas
black township outside Port
Elizabeth on the Indian Ocean.
The explosion set fire to the house
and nine nearby shacks, including one
in which the child was sleeping, said
the spokesman, who spoke on condi
tion he not be identified.
Police used shotguns, rubber bul
lets and tear gas several times during
the night to break up crowds that
stoned police patrols and piled up
burning roadblocks, the spokesman
said. Two policemen and two soldiers
were slightly injured in townships
near Port Elizabeth, he said.
He said a black mob attacked a
black councilor in Thabong township
near Welkom in the Orange Free
State. The councilor opened fire, he
said, wounding a man and a woman.
In Johannesburg, protesters
slipped into the downtown Citibank

office building at mid-morning in
ones and twos, assembled on a middle
floor and then entered the Citibank
headquarters on the 22nd floor.
"Why are you keeping quiet about
the massacre of our people?" leader
Sydney Mofumadi asked three
Citibank executives who sat down
with a delegation of five protest
leaders for an hour-long meeting.
"Are you so shortsighted that you
cannot see your hand in the killing of
our people?" Mofumadi said.
Neil Munro, in charge of Citibank
personnel, responded, "We believe
we are making noises in the right
places. We believe there has been in
justice. We've been making
representations."
Later, the bank issued a statement
saying Citibank "remained commit
ted to peaceful social reforms" and
that Citibank "finds apartheid

morally unacceptable and deplores its
continuation in South Africa."
Citibank recently said it would no
longer lend money to the public sec
tor in South Africa. But the bank is
actively seeking new private clients.
The protest marked a new tactic by
the United Democratic Front anti
apartheid coalition, the largest black
rights movement in the country.
For the first time, the protesters
singled out a foreign company for
protests against apartheid, the gov
ernment's racial separation policies.
Public gatherings of even small
groups of people are illegal and the
United Democratic Front was one of
dozens of groups recently banned
from meeting indoors.
The Reagan administration has
criticized apartheid but has insisted
on "quiet diplomacy" to urge changes
by the South African government.
