Officials fast for farms
ST. PAUL, Minn. — A group of Democratic
legislators fasted for a second day yesterday to
rally support for a bill stalled in the Republican
controlled House that would halt all farm
foreclosures in the state for one year.
Twenty-six lawmakers, all members of the
Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, signed a
pledge to fast, maintain a vigil or support those
who are fasting until the full House votes on the
measure a third time Thursday.
"It's a symbolic attempt to show people who
are living in uncertainty and real economic in
security that there are people who care," said
state Rep. Todd Otis. "I realize it's a symbolic
thing."
The fasting lawmakers set up a table outside
the House chambers and at least three were staff
ing the table for three-hour shifts around the
clock.
The state Senate, where DFLers have a 42-25
majority, has twice passed legislation to impose a
moratorium on farm mortgage foreclosures. But
the bill was overwhelmingly defeated by a com
mittee in the House, where the Republicans hold
a 69-65 majority.
Two unsuccessful attempts have been made on
the House floor to override the committee action
and bring the bill up for a vote by the full House.
The last procedural vote ran strictly along party
lines.
Nazi search thwarted?
NEW YORK — More than 30 Baltic and Uk
rainian emigre groups have stepped up a cam
paign to thwart the Justice Department's investi
gation of Nazi collaborators, World Jewish
Congress officials charged yesterday.
The organization's investigation disclosed "a
widespread campaign, fraught with anti-
Semitism, to derail the government's pursuit of
war criminals," said Kalman Sultanik, vice presi
dent of the Jewish group.
"The campaign has intensified greatly in the

last six months," said Eli Rosenbaum, a consul
tant to the Jewish Congress and former Justice
Department lawyer.
"These are not fringe groups, these are main
stream groups with hundreds of thousands of
members," said Elan Steinberg, the Jewish
group's spokesman.
The charges were denied by members of the
Lithuanian and Ukrainian communities, who said
opposition to the Justice Department effort
focused on its use of evidence provided by the
Soviet Union.
The emigre groups' alleged campaign is par
tially motivated by the "fear that the prosecu
tions are exposing the .. . fact that Hitler's an
nihilation of 6 million Jews was carried out not by
the Germans alone, but rather with the extensive
collaboration of Lithuanians, Latvians, Uk
rainians, Estonians and other Europeans," said
Israel Singer, executive director of the World
Jewish Congress.
EPA Superfund probed
WASHINGTON — The Environmental
Protection Agency can clean up toxic waste
dumps faster than the $5.3 billion, five-year
"Superfund" plan drafted by the Reagan admin
istration, Library of Congress researchers said
yesterday.
A study by the library's Congressional Re
search Service "completely discredits" adminis
tration arguments that $5.3 billion is the most
EPA could effectively spend, said Rep. James
Florio (D-N.J.), chairman of the House Energy
commerce subcommittee.
Carl Gagliardi, an EPA spokesman, said the
agency would not have any comments until it ob
tains and reads the study.
But EPA Administrator Lee Thomas, who
headed the Superfund program before taking
over the agency early this year, has told Congress
repeatedly that the nation lacks the technical
facilities and trained people for a quicker cleanup
effort.
The administration plan would more than

triple the $1.6 billion budgeted for Superfund
during its first five years, a period that ends next
Sept. 30. The Senate Environment and Public
Works Committee has approved a five-year
renewal of Superfund at $7.5 billion, while Florio
is talking in terms of $ 10.1 billion.
The EPA has said that there are at least 19,000
abandoned hazardous waste sites around the
country and that nearly 800 of them are bad
enough to be placed on a national priorities list.
Th«£ agency estimates that as many as 2,000
dumpVCcfaldSvinrcftip on the list and cost as much
as $23 billion to purify. The General Accounting •
Office, the investigative wing of Congress, proj
ects a 4,000-dump list costing at least $39 billion
to clean up.
Panel votes to cut MX
WASHINGTON — The Senate Armed
Services Committee voted yesterday to cut Presi
dent Reagan's request for MX missiles next year
by more than half, according to Senate sources.
The 10-9 vote to authorize only 21 missiles in
stead of 48 came in closed session as the
Republican-led panel began trying to draft a
defense-spending blueprint for next year, said
the sources, speaking on condition they not be
identified.
All 10 Republicans on the panel voted for the
21 figure, while all nine Democrats opposed it,
the sources said. Democrats had sought to elimi
nate the missile purchases entirely.
Stock prices take dive
Stock prices fell broadly yesterday as the mar
ket abruptly reversed course at mid-afternoon
and ended a two-session-old rally.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
which rose 5.97 on Monday and more than 12
points over the past two sessions, fell 7.07 to
1,265.68. The widely-known market indicator
had been up 3.53 at noontime.
