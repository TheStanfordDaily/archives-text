TENEBRAE SERVICE
A Protestant Service of Worship:
"Tenebrae" is the Latin word for darkness or shadow.
This sen/ice is a shortened version of the monastic
offices of Matins and Lauds. As we say the psalms
and listen to the readings, the lights and candles in
the church will gradually be extinguished to
commemorate Jesus' suffering and death.
