Kodak MP film... Eastman Kodak's professional color motion picture (MP) film
adapted for still use in your 35mm camera by Seattle Film Works. With micro-fine grain
and rich color saturation, its quality meets the exacting standards of Hollywood
filmmakers. And with wide exposure latitude, you don't have to be a pro to get great
everyday shots or capture special effects.
Experience remarkable versatility. Shoot in low light or bright light from ASA 200 up
to ASA 1200. If you're shooting in tungsten lighting, we'll color correct for this at no
charge. And enjoy the option of prints or slides, or both, from the same roll.
It's economical, too. For example, we'll process your film, send you mounted slides,
negatives and a new roll of film —all for the incredibly low price of $4.60 per roll plus
postage and handling. Quick, convenient mail order service... plus substantial savings.
Try our introductory offer. Of course it costs us more than $2 to send this to you. But
we're confident that once you've tried the film, you'll become a regular customer. Why
not see what this quality film can do for your photography. Send in today!
"there has long been the dream of one film that could produce
everything.... Such a film is here now in the form 0f5247.
