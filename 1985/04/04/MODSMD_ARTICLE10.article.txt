Kirpatrick switches
WASHINGTON — Former U.N. Ambassador
Jeane Kirkpatrick, saying she is "tired of swim
ming against the current of my own party,"
changed her voter registration yesterday from
Democrat to Republican.
Hours after her new voter registration card was
delivered to election officials in suburban
Montgomery County, Md., Kirkpatrick told
a news conference that she still admires her
Democratic heroes of the past.
"If Harry Truman were running for president
today, I would vote for him," she said, adding
that her first vote was cast for Truman in 1948.
She said her next vote was for Adlai Stevenson,
the Democratic presidential nominee who lost to
Dwight Eisenhower in 1952.
Kirkpatrick's long-heralded switch of party al
legiance came after she served four years as the
Reagan administration's chief representative to
the United Nations and developed a reputation
as an outspoken conservative on foreign policy
issues, frequently disagreeing with the State De
partment position.
Republicans marked the occasion with a recep
tion in her honor and she was joined at the news
conference by Maureen Reagan, the president's
daughter, and Frank Fahrenkopf, chairman of
the Republican National Committee.
"We are very thrilled," said Reagan, chair
woman of the GOP Women's Political Action
League.
"I can think of no greater pleasure to me,"
added Fahrenkopf.
During her U.N. career, Kirkpatrick had well
publicized disagreements with then-Secretary of
State Alexander Haig over policy in Latin
America and has been described by aides to his
successor, George Shultz, as opposing attempts

to improve relations with the Soviet Union.
She became a favorite of conservatives who
hoped that Reagan would name her secretary of
state or national security adviser when she an
nounced she was leaving her U.N. post. But no
such offer was made and Kirkpatrick is resuming
her former career as a writer and lecturer associ
ated with Georgetown University.
Union Carbide resumes
INSTITUTE, W.Va. — Union Carbide Corp.
officials said yesterday that work has begun to
prepare its Institute plant for renewed produc
tion in "10 to 15 days" of methyl isocyanate, the
gas that killed thousands in a leak in India.
The company said the Institute production unit
has been revised to make it safer since MIC gas,
used to make pesticides, escaped from a Carbide
plant and killed at least 2,000 people in Bhopal,
India on Dec. 3.
The Institute unit was shut down after that leak,
and Carbide said it wouldn't resume production
until after it was able to study the India leak.
When production resumes in Institute, the plant
will be the only site in the world where the
chemical is still made.
Robert Olford, president of Union Carbide
Agricultural Products Co., Inc., said engineers
and technicians plan to run final checks of the In
stitute unit over the next two weeks. He said MIC
production could resume after that.
Senate repeals tax rules
WASHINGTON — The Senate yesterday
voted to repeal strict record-keeping require
ments for tax-deductible vehicles and home com
puters after endorsing new expense-account tax

breaks for corporate executives and for workers
who drive company cars on personal business.
The Senate action, approved by a 92-1 vote,
would worsen the federal deficit by about $5.5
billion over the next four years. The House ver
sion would not affect the deficit.
Both bills would kill the law enacted last year
that requires taxpayers to keep a log or other up
to-date record of the use of a car or truck whose
mileage is split between business and personal
use. A similar requirement applies to home
based computers, video recorders and similar
equipment.
Before passing the repeal measure, the Senate
added two separate issues dealing with taxable
fringe benefits:
• It approved an amendment that would allow
employees tax-free use of a company vehicle if at
least 75 percent of the use is devoted to business.
• It rejected an effort to ensure that the Internal
Revenue Service does not weaken current-law
treatment of corporate executives' personal use
of company planes. The vote retained language
written by the Senate Finance Committee de
manding that the IRS give a bigger tax break to
those executives.
Market slumps
The stock market posted its second straight
loss yesterday, beset by uncertainties over inter
est rates and the economic outlook.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, ott
7.07 Tuesday, fell another 7.62 points to
1,258.06.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
slowed to 95.48 million shares from 101.66 mil
lion the day before.
