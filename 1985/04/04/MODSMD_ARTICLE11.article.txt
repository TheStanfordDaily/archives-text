Assassin arrested?
LOS ANGELES — A man described as a self
confessed contract killer suspected in the assas
sination of Philippine opposition leader Benigno
Aquino was arrested during a Los Angeles police
sting operation focusing on alleged theft rings,
officials said Wednesday.
Stephen Higgins, director of the federal
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in
Washington, yesterday announced the arrest of
Jose Santos, although Los Angeles police said he
had been arrested March 1 and turned over to
the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
"Santos is . . . alleged to be involved in the as
sassination of Philippine opposition leader
Benigno Aquino," Higgins said in a statement.
He did not elaborate on Santos' alleged part in
the August 1983 killing as Aquino returned to

his native country from self-imposed exile in the
United States.
Heat wave sweeps state
LOS ANGELES— A record spring heat wave
sent thousands of people to Southern California
beaches again yesterday, and sellers of fans and
ice cream reported brisk business while some
other parts of the nation got a natural freeze.
While rival beach areas in the Southeast had
record lows and snow dappled parts of the North
east, the temperature in downtown Los Angeles
reached 82 degrees yesterday, National Weather
Service spokeswoman Pat Rowe said. That was
down a bit from the 90s that set records earlier in
the week.
Tens of thousands of people were counted at
the beaches yesterday, although morning fog cut

the crowds to half of Tuesday's size along one
stretch of Los Angeles County beach, lifeguards
said.
"We re busy, but not as busy as yesterday,"
said Ralph Lee, a senior lifeguard at Los Angeles
County's central coast, which stretches from
Marina del Rey to Topanga Canyon.
On Tuesday, more than 375,000 people took
to the beaches and lifeguards who may otherwise
have spent an idle Easter vacation were called
into duty.
Today's weather
Sunny today with highs in the low 80s. North
west afternoon winds 10 to 25 mph. Fair tonight
and tomorrow with lows in the-40s to low 50s and
highs in the mid 80s.
