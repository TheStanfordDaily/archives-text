## Stanford grad fights high-tech crime 
### XAVIER BRIAND 
In the competitive world of Silicon
Valley, Douglas Southard sees that
the law of the jungle doesn't always
apply. Southard, 37, directs the Santa
Clara County Distict Attorney's
Technological Theft Association —
DATTA — that specializes in high
tech crime.
Going after computer criminals is
now a full-time job for the assistant
district attorney, who has become one
of the pioneers of high-tech prosecut
ing despite his background. "I was a
philosophy major as an undergradu
ate (at Stanford)," he said.
When Southard joined the district
attorney's staff in 1977, high
technology theft was not yet consid
ered a big problem. "From time to
time a case would pop up, and the of
fice was not really equipped to handle
it. The tendency then was to say, 'Well,
that's a civil case,' " he said.
But a number of cases in the late
1970s involving the theft of trace
secrets and semiconductor chips
worth millions of dollars began to
change that attitude. One of these
was the Peter Gopal case, to which
Southard was assigned.

After a much-publicized trial,
Gopal was convicted in 1981 of steal
ing integrated circuit-trace secrets
from several Silicon Valley giants, In
tel Corp. and National Semiconduc
tor among them.
Pressure to create a specialized
police force had been building in the
industry for some time, and the
Gopal case acted as a catalyst.
Recognizing the need for greater
security, 32 Silicon Valley firms had
created the Industrial Security
Managers Group (ISMG) in 1977.
Companies belatedly discovered
they were "fighting the same
windmills," said ISMG President
Peter Costner. The ISMG began
meeting each month to discuss com
mon issues and "act as a liaison with
law enforcement agencies in Santa
Clara Valley," he said.
ISMG made cracking down on
high-tech criminals a political issue
during the 1982 race for the district
attorney's post, and the winner, Leo
Himmelsbach, promised to do just
that. DATTA was formed in March,
1983.
As the succesful prosecuting attor
ney in the Gopal case, Southard was

the logical choice to take charge of
the new group.
DATTA is composed of about 30
investigators from nine police depart
ments — including Palo Alto, Moun
tain View and Sunnyvale — trained
to work in the major areas of com
puter crime: Theft of trace secrets,
theft of components, and unaut
horized access to stored information.
Trudy Eitel, one of two Palo Alto
police officers on DATTA, said her
expertise is in law enforcement, not
computers. However, the group's
strength is "relying on the expertise
of others" through a network of in
dustry contacts who share informa
tion during an investigation or at
DATTA's monthly meetings.
The group, which is not funded but
uses the time of the officers on loan
from the various departments,
worked on about 40 cases in 1984,
Southard said.

DATTA's performance was im
pressive enough last year to persuade
the California legislature to fund a
two-year "pilot program," starting
next month, that will help other
counties address their high-tech
crime problems.
The program, administered by
Southard and Palo Alto Police Capt.
Robert Elliott, will also produce anti
theft publications for smaller com
panies "most of whom are undercapi
talized in the security area and
frankly most at risk," Southard said.
Figures on losses due to theft in
Silicon Valley vary from a total of
$20 million to $100 million between
1978 and 1983. More than anthing
else, these numbers highlight the lack
of hard data on the subject.
One chronic problem of theft in
vestigation in Silicon Valley is a com-

pany's reluctance — particularly if it
is publicly held — to come forward
with evidence for fear that publicity
might damage corporate reputation,
said Southard.
Southard, who once prosecuted
child molesters, drew parallel be
tween the victims of both crimes.
"Are you doing as much . . . damage
to the victim with the court proceed
ings as the actual act did? It's a quan
dary and there's no real answer to it."
Southard praised Intel Corp. in
Santa Clara for bucking the trend and
cooperating with the district attor
ney's office. The company "takes a
hard line," even if its short-term prof
its are hurt by publicity, he said.
Not all the cases Southard gets are
as big as the $3.5 million semiconduc
tor chip theft in 1981 at Monolithic
Memorio Inc. in Sunnyvale. For in
stance, he cooperated with the Stan
ford Police Department during its
recent investigation of a Cupertino
high school student's alleged attempt
to illegally access a Stanford com
puter.
Hacking, the term coined by youth
ful computer buffs to describe intrud
ing into computer systems, is not the
problem it could be, said Southard,
even though he has averaged "about
a case every other month for the last
year, most of them innocuous."

Nevertheless, some experts believe
hacking is more than a passing trend.
Unauthorized access is a growing
problem because of the increasing
number of "pirate, electronic bulletin
boards and hard-core, malicious
juvenile hackers," said Donn Parker,
a senior management consultant at
SRI International in Menlo Park.
Parker, whom Southard refers to as
"the grandfather" of computer crime
experts, began his research in 1970
and is now an authority on computer
security, having written a Justice De
partment manual on the subject.
Parker said one method of foiling
hackers is to "have the computer it
self log and analyze all transactions,"
then produce "exception reports"
that identify deviations.
That system plus a rotating pass
word prevented the high school stu
dent from penetrating the Stanford
computer and altering the school
grades stored in the program, he said.
But technical safeguards can go
only so far, Parker said. "Human
controls," such as a "reward and
penalty system" to ensure that pass
words remain secret, are crucial to
preserve security, particularly because
most thefts are done from the inside.
Encryption — using scramblers and
other sophisticated security devices
— is an alternative method favored

mostly by large corporations that use
microwave transmission, which,
unlike telephone lines, can be inter
cepted "by anybody," Southard said.
"Your motivation may be youthful
exuberance, but it doesn't make
damage to the victim any less real,"
said Southard of hackers who cause
computer systems to shut down for
days.
DATTA got tough with hackers
last year by helping push through the
California legislature a bill that
makes it a misdemeanor to merely at
tempt to illegally access a computer.,
The law became effective on Jan.
1 and "closes the loophole" that re
quired proof of "specific felonious in
tent" before conviction, Southard
said.
Groups like DATTA, Southard '
believes, are an attempt by society to
"establish an infrastructure of
governmental services from the exec- '
utive branch here that will protect
capitalists who risk their capital on
certain projects."
The growing number of prosecu
tions, the Gopal case among them, '
has helped crystalize in the minds of
those in the industry that criminal
remedies are available, and that soci- ■
ety has to treat this kind of behavior
as a crime when the facts are there,"
Southard said.
