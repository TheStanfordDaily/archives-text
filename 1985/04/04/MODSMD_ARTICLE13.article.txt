## The 						Stanford Daily Snuff out subsidy 
### 
Warning: The surgeon general has determined
that cigarette smoking is dangerous to your
health.
Recommendation: The federal government
should determine that subsidizing the tobacco in
dustry is counterproductive — not only to logical
policy, but also to the health of the economy.
Illogical is a polite word to describe the current
practice of subsidizing 20,000 tobacco growers to
the tune of $100 million a year while spending
additional money disseminating information
about the dangers of tobacco use — information
generated at least in part by government-funded
research. Especially during a time of budgetary
cuts, funding two obviously contradictory pro
grams makes no sense.
And ironically, ending the government's pro
gram may actually be the best policy for the
tobacco industry. Turmoil is the word used by the
Los Angeles Times to describe an industry
beleagured by competition from cheap foreign
tobacco and by declining tobacco consumption.

Solution is the word Rep. Thomas Petri might
use to describe the effects of ending the govern
ment's subsidy program. The Wisconsin Republi
can is the sponsor of a bill that would end the
program.
Under the program, the government regulates
who grows tobacco, how much they grow and
how much they must pay for the right to grow it.
The basic economic questions of how much
tobacco to produce, how to produce it and how to
distribute it are currently answered by the gov
ernment rather than the marketplace. This makes
U.S. growers unable to compete with foreigners.
According to Petri, a recent study by North
Carolina State University predicts that deregulat
ing the tobacco industry would cause tobacco ex
ports to double, nearly eliminate U.S. imports
and increase total demand for U.S. tobacco by 50
percent to 100 percent or even more.
Conclusion: Congress and the senate should
enact Petri's bill and end federal government in
volvement with the tobacco industry.
