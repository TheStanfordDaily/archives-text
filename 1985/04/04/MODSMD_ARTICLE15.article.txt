# Why writers hate editors and vice versa
## 
### 
It is a cliche that writers do not like editors.
Editors think this is because writers are so incredi
bly arrogant that they refuse to admit they need
editors. It is also a cliche that editors do not like
writers; writers believe that this is because editors
are failed and frustrated writers who cannot face
the fact that writers do not need them.
The cliches are pretty close to the truth. Simply
put, writers dislike editors because editors try to
change their work; editors dislike writers because
writers resist having their work changed by editors.
That's the only point I'm going to draw from all this
writing you see before you. I'm just going to illus
trate it a little bit. I'll warn you, it gets pretty ugly,
and if you have a low tolerance for ranting and
raving you'll probably want to take the conclusion
and leave now.
All right. Before I start, let me digress for a mo
ment. I have written, so far, about 15 pages, in
which I have tried to organize this essay in a dozen
different ways. It always comes out sounding like
the kind of pseudo-intellectual literary criticism
that what's-his-name over in the French Depart
ment keeps trying to apply to the latest develop
ments in computer science. I begin to bore even
myself. So I'm not even going to try to justify
myself, since that seems to be at the root of my dif
ficulties. I'm just going to assume that you'll agree
with me that I'm a pretty good writer. If you dis
agree you can stop reading right here, because this
will only annoy you. But let's say, for the sake of
argument, that I can write as well as, say, the
editors of The Stanford Daily. Are you with me?
Good.
Now, bearing in mind our supposition, let me ex
plain to you why writers hate editors. I knew all this
before, in an abstract way, from reading things that
writers have said about editors. But then last month
my own work — namely, the last column I wrote —
was rather severely edited; so now I can tell you at
firsthand.
First of all, writers hate editors who delete
things. Writers are generally arrogant enough to
think that what they write should be printed. That's
why they write. I'm a writer. I'm arrogant — I'll ad
mit that, if it makes you happy. I'm as arrogant as I
can be and still be such a nice guy. And when an
editor deleted something that I thought should
have been left alone, I was annoyed. But I'm
reasonable, even if I am an egotist. This is a news
paper, after all. It says so, in the masthead. It also
says, "All submitted articles are subject to editing."

And the columnist information sheet I was given
reminds me that "it is a fact of newspaper work that
stories are cut many times late at night on the lay
out table."
OK. I can accept that. I don't like it, but then
there are a lot of things I don't like. The world is an
imperfect place. And since I am a reasonable fel
low, I am going to phrase this plea to the editors in
the gentlest possible terms: Please don't do that.
Please? Look: If you find yourself lacking space,
and you need to take a few lines from my column,
could you possibly put them on another page?

Anywhere will do, anywhere at all. Or if you can't
do that, if it's against editorial policy or it's just
impossible or something, I have another idea: Take
the picture instead. It's a nice picture, really, and I
do like it; but it takes up 13 57-character lines that
could have words on them. If something has to go, I
would infinitely prefer that it be the picture, not the
words. If anybody wants to know what I look like,
he can find me and look at me. The picture is ex
pendable. The words are not.
At least think about it?
There. That was the reasonable part. I can accept
cuts, if they are necessary. Even though I didn't
much care for the deletions that were made, I
suppose they were as good as could be expected. So
far, I am calm.
This is the part where I get upset. Pay close at
tention.
Whoever edited my colunm saw fit to change a
number of the words. My words. Let me say that
again, so you know where I stand on this: My
words. In particular, my title. Now that makes me
mad. It was, simply, stupid. It served no purpose.
The new title was one character shorter than my
title, which would have fit quite easily in its place. It
was irrelevant to the column, and it completely
changed the tone of the column. And it made me

mad. The reason the title and the author's name are
printed in large letters is that they are the most im
portant words. I don't want anybody changing the
most important words of my column. There's no
excuse.
Probably the same person thought that my
writing needed to conform to the Associated Press'
stylebook guidelines, because he made a whole
bunch of pointless changes to the column. None of
the changes were justified: all they did was change
the flow of the column. For the worse, need I add.
A bunch of stupid, useless changes in my words. As
far as I can see, the only possible reason for the
changes is that someone thought he could write my
column better than I could. He was wrong.
There's no excuse.
Now I'm going to rant for a while. This may
sound arrogant. It may be arrogant. That doesn't
matter, because it's also true. There is no reason for
the editor to make stylistic changes in this column,
none at all. I'm a good enough writer to choose my
own style and make my own choices. Even if I
weren't — or, even if I'm not, if you prefer — I
should still be allowed to embarrass myself in my
own way. This is not a news article, or anything like
a news article; it is a column, which is something al
together different. In fact, it is — usually — a
humor column, which is even more altogether dif
ferent. How I write is quite as important as,
sometimes more important than, what I write. If it
were a news story, then I could maybe see some
justification for changing the style. Stylistic consis
tency is a reasonable goal for newswriting, I
suppose. But — listen closely: this is important —
not for this column. My style is irrelevant to the rest
of the newspaper, and the rest of the newspaper is
irrelevant to my column. There is no reason at all to
make my style consistent with Tim Grieve's style or
Marilyn Wann's style or the AP's style; not only
that, but there is every reason to leave my style
alone. What I write is mine, and I don't want some
nameless editor who thinks he can write better than
I can, changing it to conform to whatever stylebook
he used when he took Editorial Techniques. Let
him write his own column. Let him write an edito
rial about me. But let him not fuck with my writing.
There. Have I made myself clear? That's why
writers hate editors. And now, of course, it's ob
vious why editors hate writers.

And the columnist information sheet I was given
reminds me that "it is a fact of newspaper work that
stories are cut many times late at night on the lay
out table."
OK. I can accept that. I don't like it, but then
there are a lot of things I don't like. The world is an
imperfect place. And since I am a reasonable fel
low, I am going to phrase this plea to the editors in
the gentlest possible terms: Please don't do that.
Please? Look: If you find yourself lacking space,
and you need to take a few lines from my column,
could you possibly put them on another page?

Anywhere will do, anywhere at all. Or if you can't
do that, if it's against editorial policy or it's just
impossible or something, I have another idea: Take
the picture instead. It's a nice picture, really, and I
do like it; but it takes up 13 57-character lines that
could have words on them. If something has to go, I
would infinitely prefer that it be the picture, not the
words. If anybody wants to know what I look like,
he can find me and look at me. The picture is ex
pendable. The words are not.
At least think about it?
There. That was the reasonable part. I can accept
cuts, if they are necessary. Even though I didn't
much care for the deletions that were made, I
suppose they were as good as could be expected. So
far, I am calm.
This is the part where I get upset. Pay close at
tention.
Whoever edited my colunm saw fit to change a
number of the words. My words. Let me say that
again, so you know where I stand on this: My
words. In particular, my title. Now that makes me
mad. It was, simply, stupid. It served no purpose.
The new title was one character shorter than my
title, which would have fit quite easily in its place. It
was irrelevant to the column, and it completely
changed the tone of the column. And it made me

mad. The reason the title and the author's name are
printed in large letters is that they are the most im
portant words. I don't want anybody changing the
most important words of my column. There's no
excuse.
Probably the same person thought that my
writing needed to conform to the Associated Press'
stylebook guidelines, because he made a whole
bunch of pointless changes to the column. None of
the changes were justified: all they did was change
the flow of the column. For the worse, need I add.
A bunch of stupid, useless changes in my words. As
far as I can see, the only possible reason for the
changes is that someone thought he could write my
column better than I could. He was wrong.
There's no excuse.
Now I'm going to rant for a while. This may
sound arrogant. It may be arrogant. That doesn't
matter, because it's also true. There is no reason for
the editor to make stylistic changes in this column,
none at all. I'm a good enough writer to choose my
own style and make my own choices. Even if I
weren't — or, even if I'm not, if you prefer — I
should still be allowed to embarrass myself in my
own way. This is not a news article, or anything like
a news article; it is a column, which is something al
together different. In fact, it is — usually — a
humor column, which is even more altogether dif
ferent. How I write is quite as important as,
sometimes more important than, what I write. If it
were a news story, then I could maybe see some
justification for changing the style. Stylistic consis
tency is a reasonable goal for newswriting, I
suppose. But — listen closely: this is important —
not for this column. My style is irrelevant to the rest
of the newspaper, and the rest of the newspaper is
irrelevant to my column. There is no reason at all to
make my style consistent with Tim Grieve's style or
Marilyn Wann's style or the AP's style; not only
that, but there is every reason to leave my style
alone. What I write is mine, and I don't want some
nameless editor who thinks he can write better than
I can, changing it to conform to whatever stylebook
he used when he took Editorial Techniques. Let
him write his own column. Let him write an edito
rial about me. But let him not fuck with my writing.
There. Have I made myself clear? That's why
writers hate editors. And now, of course, it's ob
vious why editors hate writers.

It is a cliche that writers do not like editors.
Editors think this is because writers are so incredi
bly arrogant that they refuse to admit they need
editors. It is also a cliche that editors do not like
writers; writers believe that this is because editors
are failed and frustrated writers who cannot face
the fact that writers do not need them.
The cliches are pretty close to the truth. Simply
put, writers dislike editors because editors try to
change their work; editors dislike writers because
writers resist having their work changed by editors.
That's the only point I'm going to draw from all this
writing you see before you. I'm just going to illus
trate it a little bit. I'll warn you, it gets pretty ugly,
and if you have a low tolerance for ranting and
raving you'll probably want to take the conclusion
and leave now.
All right. Before I start, let me digress for a mo
ment. I have written, so far, about 15 pages, in
which I have tried to organize this essay in a dozen
different ways. It always comes out sounding like
the kind of pseudo-intellectual literary criticism
that what's-his-name over in the French Depart
ment keeps trying to apply to the latest develop
ments in computer science. I begin to bore even
myself. So I'm not even going to try to justify
myself, since that seems to be at the root of my dif
ficulties. I'm just going to assume that you'll agree
with me that I'm a pretty good writer. If you dis
agree you can stop reading right here, because this
will only annoy you. But let's say, for the sake of
argument, that I can write as well as, say, the
editors of The Stanford Daily. Are you with me?
Good.
Now, bearing in mind our supposition, let me ex
plain to you why writers hate editors. I knew all this
before, in an abstract way, from reading things that
writers have said about editors. But then last month
my own work — namely, the last column I wrote —
was rather severely edited; so now I can tell you at
firsthand.
First of all, writers hate editors who delete
things. Writers are generally arrogant enough to
think that what they write should be printed. That's
why they write. I'm a writer. I'm arrogant — I'll ad
mit that, if it makes you happy. I'm as arrogant as I
can be and still be such a nice guy. And when an
editor deleted something that I thought should
have been left alone, I was annoyed. But I'm
reasonable, even if I am an egotist. This is a news
paper, after all. It says so, in the masthead. It also
says, "All submitted articles are subject to editing."

And the columnist information sheet I was given
reminds me that "it is a fact of newspaper work that
stories are cut many times late at night on the lay
