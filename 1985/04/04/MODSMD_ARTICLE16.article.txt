A shot in the foot
If, as W. Hardy Callcott writes
(The Daily, April 1), Stanford's
mission is education, then rejecting
the Ronald Reagan Presidential
Library does as much good as shoot
ing one's self in the foot. Presidential
libraries make source documents of
history available to students and
scholars. Refusing such an opportu
nity redefines academic freedom to
include only one political viewpoint
and eliminates the diversity of
thought and opinion necessary to
free discourse.
Stanford could better act directly
to help student finances by examin
ing its own costs and discovering why
tuition must increase 9 to 10 percent
in a period of 3 to 4 percent infla
tion. Rejecting the Reagan library is
"feel-good politics," a futile gesture
that harms Stanford by refusing a
valuable gift â€” one that Callcott and
others might use to write criticism
not based in petulance, but grounded
in fact.

Stop at the signs
The lack of concern for their own
safety prompts me to write concern
ing those bicyclists who continue to
ride through stop signs on campus
without making appropriate stops. I
see many of these individuals on a
daily basis as I enter and leave the
campus and it appears they have
little regard for the importance of
following California Vehicle Code
rules, which include bicycles.

One of my concerns is that many
of these riders have established a
habit of not stopping at appropriate
stop signs. This habit could ulti
mately prove hazardous to them, if
not fatal. I suggest that all bicyclists
evaluate their own riding habits and
change those habits which may cost
them their lives.
Remember, if you ride a bicycle,
you are considered to be driving a
vehicle in California. The stop signs
are there for you as well.

Titillation not truth
Regarding your editorial on the
$723 / quarter-BMW incident in the
March 8 Daily, you claim that "what
(sophomore Andy) Beyer did un
dermines journalists' attempts to
print the truth."
Beg to differ! Journalists and
papers don't necessarily print "the
truth"; very often they select from
among an infinite number of stories
the ones which titillate the reader
and present some shocking aspect of
contemporary culture.
The idea, of course, is not simply
to print "truth," but to gain
notoriety and attention for them
selves and their organization by
appealing to our morbid appetites,
thus gaining the position of sage of
the culture. Certainly not a good
view of truth!
And so, vulturelike, they feed on
negative situations and can be easily
tricked by the Beyers of this world!
