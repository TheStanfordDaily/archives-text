## A
						decline of the democratic ideal? 
### 
Present-day thinking is apt to be
confused about the nature of the
"rule of law" and the different
purposes a democratic system ought
to serve. The evil of the so-called
democratic system is precisely that
law has become subservient to gov-

VIEWPOINT

ernment administration rather than
the other way around. What we now
call laws are actually rules which can
be adjusted from day to day in
whatever manner the ruling majority
thinks is necessary in order to achieve
the desired results. In other words,
government seems to no longer be
under the law.
We have come to call every action
of government a law, instead of
"general rules" that are designed to
get approval of the majority. As long
as this peculiar situation prevails, we
cannot stop the tendency of demo
cratic government to direct — ac
cording to the will of the majority —
more and more of the whole life of
society. This trend toward an om
nipotent and all-controling govern
ment is built into the particular kind
of institutions we have and the drift
will not stop unless we change the na
ture of those institutions. Such a ten
dency necessarily creates a gradual
transformation of the spontaneous
order of a free society. In the long run
this unavoidably leads to a system
dominated by coalitions of organized
interests.
Austria provides quite a good illus
tration of this confusion about the
rule of law. The president of the
Austrian National Assembly serves
also as the president of one of the
most powerful coalitions of organized
interest — the Federation of Labor.
Since he belongs to the same party as
the majority holder in the National
Assembly, his influence on the gov

ernment and the political issues is sig
nificant. This unique concentration of
power is clearly responsible for much
of the famous "Austrian Social
Climate," and the so-called
"Austrian Social-Partnership."
There is undoubtedly a natural
desire to have both the enactment of
general rules and the conduct of cur
rent governmental affairs judged in
accordance with popular wishes. But
we have put these two fundamentally
different tasks in the powerful hands
of one and the same representative:
the democratically elected assembly.
The result is that such a body has long
ago ceased to be a purely legislative

But in modern 'democratic' societies
the same people who govern — who
are our employees — also lay down
laws.

assembly, as was originally intended.
The main function of these elected
legislative bodies is no longer to make
general rules to direct and control the
activities of government and to tell
government to take specific actions.
Our representative bodies are, in a
strict sense, no longer only law
giving, but also governing. They at
tempt to combine both functions in
the same authority with an extraordi
nary result.
The designers of most of the West
ern constitutions in the 18th and 19th
centuries hoped to achieve a reign of
freedom by separating the task of
legislation from the task of govern
ment. Many still believe that we have
achieved this by having a democratic
assembly which legislates and an ex
ecutive branch that carries out the
laws. But the present systems corre

spond to the ideal only because we
have started using the term "law" in
two entirely different ways.
While "law" used to mean a gen
eral rule equally applicable to all, we
have come to call a law whatever the
representative body resolves. Hence
we have failed fully to achieve the
original concept with which the ideas
of freedom under the law were con
nected — that government ought to
be under the law. Government under
the law means that the rulers should
have no power over private people
except to enforce the general rules of
law. But in modern "democratic"
societies, the same people who gov-

ern — who are our employees — also
lay down laws. These "laws" are, of
course, administrative and organiza
tional directives designed to run the
(sometimes useless) machinery of
government; to tell civil servants how
to act; to state the (sometimes hid
den) purpose for which our money is
to be spent, and so forth down the
line. Those rules constitute a set of
"commands" to government
bureaucrats as they are in totalitarian
economies.
If we want both government and
legislation to be in democratic hands,
we should put these important mat
ters in the hands of two different
democratic bodies instead of the
hands of the same group. If we want
to maintain democracy in the long
run, we must separate legislative and
executive bodies.

One body should be concerned
with the law-giving in the sense that
theoreticians of democracy originally
conceived of it. That requires general
rules that apply equally to all mem
bers of a society and provide the only
excuse for applying coercion to the
private citizen. The other body
should have the task of directing the
use of the governmental appartus —
partly for the purpose of enforcing
the rules, but chiefly for the purpose
of rendering to the citizens those few
services which cannot be provided by
the market and which we want gov
ernment to render. This second
governmental body would have
power to enforce those general "rules
of just conduct" laid down by the first
assembly and would carry out a pro
gram of action.
The task of government in the case
of the central government would, in
many ways, become rather similar to
the tasks of any local government.
This central government would be
bound by a "higher" law and
therefore would be able to concern it
self about particulars, about concrete
services to be rendered to the
citizens; but it would not be in the po
sition (as it is today) of adjusting the
general rules or laws to the specific
purpose of current government.
The current predicament of demo
cratic institutions and the opportunity
for their improvement incited econo
mist and social philosopher / Nobel
laureate Friedrich Hayek to compose
a striking proposal of a reconstruction
of the democratic ideal (cf. "The Es
sence of Hayek," Hoover Press, Stan
ford, 1984). An examination of
Hayek's work is invaluable to the
reader who desires to acquire a thor
ough understanding of the problems
we face and the tools available to
solve them.
