# TMU bid process begins
## Sixteen food service firms tour Tresidder eateries 
### BARBARA SCHULER Staff writer 
Representatives from 16 firms toured food service
facilities at Tresidder Union and Encina Station yesterday
as part of an open bidding process for the University's
commercial food service contracts.
The current contracts with Servomation Corp.,
which runs Union Crossroads and Encina Station, and
with Coffee House, Inc. (CHI), a wholly-owned sub
sidiary of the ASSU that operates the Coffee House,
expire in August.
McDonald's, Wendy's and several national food service
organizations were among the corporations that attended
yesterday's pre-bid conference. Because of the competi
tive nature of the bidding process, none of the corpora
tions contacted would reveal any details about changes
they might propose in the campus eateries.
The decision to open bidding for the contracts does
not necessarily indicate dissatisfaction with the Univer
sity's current contractors, according to Nanci Howe, assis
tant director of Tresidder Union and project coordinator
for the food bid process.
"It provides an opportunity for us to make some
changes and ... to see what new lease operators are out
there. It's a typical business practice," she said.
Servomation and the CHI plan to resubmit I ids for a
second five-year contract with the Universitv and will

likely compete with one another over the Coffee House
contract, according to David Jordan, area manager of Ser
vo ma ti on.
Jordan said that after putting "the financial (figures) to
gether," he "woilld probably make a recommendation
that we bid on the Coffee House," although the final deci
sion on the company's proposal does not rest with him.
He said Servomation, or any non-student contractor,
would likely encounter some opposition at the outset from
those loyal to a student-run Coffee House, but he con
tends that worries about decreased student involvement
are unwarranted.
"Look at the Corner Pocket," he said, referring to the
entrepreneurial venture begun by Stanford students in
1982 with Servomation financial support. "There aren't
many companies that would have taken that kind of risk."
Jordan sees student staffing as "a positive thing. Stu
dents come to where students are." In fact, he lamented
the difficulty Servomation has had getting students to
work at the Main Course, citing its "atmosphere" and the
fact that "working beside full-time people is a different
feeling than working beside other students" as two causes.

tegrate students into decision making.
"The responsibility students now have in the operation
of the Coffee House would not likely be as great in a non
student-run operation. Students play such a large role
here," he said, citing the board of directors on which four
students and four non-student staff members sit and the
widespread use of student managers.
Despite the opportunities it offers for student participa
tion, the CHI has repeatedly encountered concerns about
its financial viability.
According to Coffee House Manager Gary Verzani, the
CHI "did lose a lot of money in the past and they were
on very shaky financial ground for a while .. . but since
I've started working here, the Coffee House has made
money."
Referring to Tresidder management, Verzani said,
"Certainly they want someplace that's financially viable,
but it's not their major concern. They're not as concerned
as we are about that."
What concerns Tresidder more than CHl's internal
finances, according to Howe, is the declining sales and
customer counts, which have been attributed to slow ser
vice and an increase in competition from vendors such as
the Corner Pocket, offering more popular menu items.
Howe said the advantages and the disadvantages of cur
rent contractors in a very competitive bidding process
tend to "balance out." While knowledge of their clientele
and of the problems they must address enhance their
proposals, "we also know more about their weak points,"
she said.
At yesterday's introductory meeting, Andrea Austin,
chair of the Tresidder Union Board Food Committee,

outlined some of the criteria on which evaluations will be
made.
In addition to such obvious requirements as "high
quality of operations, merchandising, food and customer
service," she said that "being responsible to the academic
rhythm" and "reflecting strong student involvement" are
also prominent on the committee's list of priorities.
Howe highlighted Tresidder's plans for the relocation
and renovation of The Store and the Coffee House
sometime in the next two or three years. The Store would
move into the Coffee House's current location and the
Coffee House would move into the area formerly occu
pied by the bowling alley.
For the Coffee House, whose officers frequently cite
poor design and meager kitchen facilities as reasons for
slow service and an insufficient menu, these changes
would make turning a profit a lot easier, according to Ver
zani.
"When we make a move like that we'd expect it to in
crease business, but in the meantime we have to work with
what we have," Howe said.
Tresidder management hopes "that the contractor we
hire now would help with design and other considera
tions" during the $2-3 million renovation, she added.
Due May 2, these bids will go to an evaluation commit
tee composed of Howe, Austin, COP member Melissa
Auchard and Betty Tyson, an at-large administrator.
Howe will send recommendations to Tresidder Union
Director Ellie Oppenheim, who will make her recommen
dations to Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons. The new
contractors will be informed of the University's final deci
sion July 1.
Howe said, "We'd be happy with one or two contrac
tors (to run the three operations) but we'd have to be
overwhelmingly convinced that more than two would be a
good idea."
