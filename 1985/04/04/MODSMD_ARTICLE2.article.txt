# TMU bid process begins
## Sixteen food service firms tour Tresidder eateries 
### BARBARA SCHULER Staff writer 
Representatives from 16 firms toured food service
facilities at Tresidder Union and Encina Station yesterday
as part of an open bidding process for the University's
commercial food service contracts.
The current contracts with Servomation Corp.,
which runs Union Crossroads and Encina Station, and
with Coffee House, Inc. (CHI), a wholly-owned sub
sidiary of the ASSU that operates the Coffee House,
expire in August.
McDonald's, Wendy's and several national food service
organizations were among the corporations that attended
yesterday's pre-bid conference. Because of the competi
tive nature of the bidding process, none of the corpora
tions contacted would reveal any details about changes
they might propose in the campus eateries.
The decision to open bidding for the contracts does

Servomation and the CHI plan to resubmit I ids for a
second five-year contract with the Universitv and will

likely compete with one another over the Coffee House
contract, according to David Jordan, area manager of Ser

gether," he "woilld probably make a recommendation
that we bid on the Coffee House," although the final deci

He said Servomation, or any non-student contractor,
would likely encounter some opposition at the outset from
those loyal to a student-run Coffee House, but he con
tends that worries about decreased student involvement
are unwarranted.
"Look at the Corner Pocket," he said, referring to the
entrepreneurial venture begun by Stanford students in
1982 with Servomation financial support. "There aren't
many companies that would have taken that kind of risk."
Jordan sees student staffing as "a positive thing. Stu
dents come to where students are." In fact, he lamented
the difficulty Servomation has had getting students to
work at the Main Course, citing its "atmosphere" and the
fact that "working beside full-time people is a different
feeling than working beside other students" as two causes.
Todd Kerr, chairman of the CHI board of directors, ac

staff but he questioned the degree to which they would in
