## Spikers lose to No. 2 USC in five sets Heartbreaker in Maples 
### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
The stage was set for the Card
men's volleyball team to pull off a
dramatic upset last night over No. 2
USC here, but the actors must have
forgotten their lines. What was a light
drama quickly turned into an agoniz
ing tragedy.
Up two sets to one and on a roll,
the Cardinal appeared primed for its
biggest league victory of the season.
Senior setter Craig Lauchner's
sometimes erratic jump serve was on,
Stanford's blocking was consistently
obstructing the Trojan offense, and
freshman Scott Fortune's knee was
hanging tough.
Things changed in an awful hurry.
Lauchner's serve began flying long,
short and every which way; Trojan
hitters began finding openings in the
Cardinal defensive wall; Fortune's
gimpy knee collapsed.
Those events enabled USC to
storm back from its 8-15, 15-8, 12-
15 deficit with a vengeance. The
Trojans took the final two sets 15-7
and 15-11.
"I came up here prepared for five
sets," Trojan Coach Bill Yoder said,
"and I got it.
"In coming back, we wanted to be
real steady and let them make the
mistakes. And we were steady in the
fourth and fifth sets. We were
tentative early; we just weren't run

ning our offense."
USC outside hitter Dave Yoder,
the coach's brother, agreed: "We
didn't play that smoothly early, but
we outlasted them. We fought hard,
and that took a lot of heart."
The fifth and deciding game was
tight until the end. It was tied at
three, five, eight and 10. With both
teams siding out well, there was little
scoring. Even when Fortune's knee
stiffened with the Cardinal ahead 2-1,
in came little-used sophomore Step
hen Blue. Blue's gutsy effort off the
bench kept Stanford in the match.
Stanford's heroics went for naught.
The Trojans took five of the next six
points and with them the match. The
run was punctuated by thunderous
kills from USC's Chinese import
Chao Ying Zhang and sophomore
Adam Johnson. Stanford's hopes for
a story-book comeback were finally
dashed by a Maples-rattling block of
Cardinal outside hitter Brett
Monello's kill attempt.
In defeat, Stanford Co-coach Don
Shaw was philosophical. "We battled
and the guys hung in there. At 10
apiece in the fifth game, that ball can
take some crazy bounces," he said.
"This match showed me that we're
coming together as a team, maturing
together. We have a real blend of dif
ferent personalities," Shaw said,
something that tends to undermine
team unity.

The Cardinal, which fell to 8-7 in
California Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association play and 21-8 overall,
was paced by junior middle blocker
Jon Root's 29 kills (.309 hitting
percentage). Junior outside hitter
Chris Braun, who Shaw said "played
his best all around match of the

season." added 29 more kills (.250).
Monello contributed 12 kills (.175)
and Fortune had 11 (.389).
The Cardinal looks to regroup to
morrow night in Maples against San
Diego State. The match begins at
7:30.
