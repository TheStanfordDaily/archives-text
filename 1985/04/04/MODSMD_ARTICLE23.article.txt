## Goldie doesn't glitter for netters Stanford finishes off Cal, 6-3 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
It was no surprise that the No. 1-
ranked Stanford men's tennis team
defeated No. 13-ranked California 6-
3 yesterday at Berkeley. What was
surprising was that Stanford's top
player, Dan Goldie, suffered his
second dual match loss of the season.
Goldie is ranked No. 1 in the
country in the recent Intercollegiate
Tennis Coaches Association poll, but
in one week he has lost two matches
to low-ranked players — Arizona's
Benji Papal and Cal's Steve DeVries.
"Dan's losses will definitely affect
his ranking, but that's not what I'm
conerned about," Coach Dick Gould
said. "I just want him to play well
against USC and UCLA. He may not
be playing well right now, but a
month down the road that will prob
ably change."
Goldie may have lost some confi
dence after his straight set loss to the
unranked Arizona freshman, but the
crowd was an additional factor in the
Cal upset.
"The crowd really helped DeVries
(ranked 87th in the nation). There
were a couple hundred people there.
I think a lot of it was mental," sopho
more Mark Jacobson said. "Steve

played really well, though .... He's
quick and has a great backhand."
Goldie won the first set 7-6 before
dropping the next two, 6-3, 6-0.
Goldie did not recover well in his No.
1 doubles match, losing a close 7-5,
7-6 match with partner Eric Rosen
feld to DeVries and Chris Schoop.
John Letts lost the No. 5 singles
match to Don Leone, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3.
Both he and Goldie have lost in both
of Stanford's last two matches. Letts
is currently ranked 23rd in the nation.
The Cardinal's other high-ranked
singles players fared better yesterday,
in what was a continuation of a match
postponed because of darkness last
week. No. 3 Jim Grabb knocked off
Schoop 6-4, 6-1, No. 7 Derrick Ros
tagno stopped Dan Wright 6-2, 7-5
and No. 16 Rosenfeld whipped Brian
Rowers 6-1, 6-2.
With the Cal match out of the way
for better or worse, Stanford will face
No. 2-ranked USC and No. 4-ranked
UCLA this weekend in the out
door/indoor event.
The results of this weekend's
matches will be critical to the Card
inal's fortunes at the upcoming
NCAA Championships.
