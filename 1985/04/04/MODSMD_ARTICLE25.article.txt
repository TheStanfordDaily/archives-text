# Netters survive Bear scare, 5-4

### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Disaster almost struck the No.
2-ranked Stanford women's tennis
team yesterday against California.
Almost.
Stanford slipped, squeaked and
squirmed by eighth-ranked Cal, 5-
4. The match at Berkeley's Chan
ning Courts went down to the final
set of the final match.
The worst part of the near
fiasco was that the Cardinal, which
defeated these same Bears 7-0
earlier this year, had no excuses.
Coach Frank Brennan played his
best lineup. And Cal was without
its No. 4 and No. 5 singles players.
Stanford took four of the six
singles matches, but then lost
quickly at No. 1 and No. 3
doubles. So it was up to the Card
inal's No. 2 team of Anna Ivan
and Patty Fendick to save the day.
They did, beating Cal's Linda
Oeschsle and Caroline Yao 6-2, 4-
6, 6-3 to clinch the match.
"Berkeley really played up to
their potential," Brennan said.
"When they won at No. 1 singles,
they really got it going. Our No. 2
doubles team pulled us through

and we were very lucky to
escape."
Junior Alyce Werdel, who was
forced to replace Linda Gates at
No. 1 doubles when Gates injured
her knee in her loss at No. 1
singles, said the Cardinal played
"fairly well" in the singles.
"We were up 4-2 after singles,"
Werdel said, "and I think we
might have let up a little bit in
doubles."
The non-conference victory
raised Stanford's overall record to
17-1, but it also raised some ques
tions about the Cardinal if it hopes
to repeat as national champions.
Stanford's biggest area of con
cern seems to be at the bottom of
the singles ladder and No. 3
doubles. Stanford lost at No. 5
singles yesterday for the second
time in four matches and the No. 3
doubles team of sophomore Step
hanie Savides and freshman Kay
Tittle lost for the third time in four
matches.
The Bears, who dropped to 18-
8 overall, were enthusiastic about
their performance despite losing.
