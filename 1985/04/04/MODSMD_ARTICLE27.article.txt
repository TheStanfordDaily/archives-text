## Cardinal, Bears battle for Six-Pac lead 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
The last time the Stanford baseball
team's supremacy in the Pacific 10
Southern Division was contested, the
Cardinal responded with a three
game thrashing of UCLA. The Bruins
have not won a conference game
since.
Now the challengers are the Cali
fornia Golden Bears, and Stanford is

hoping for a repeat performance. The
three-game series begins today at
Evans Diamond in Berkeley.
Cal is currently riding a seven
game winning streak, including series
sweeps of UCLA and USC. The
Bears, ranked No. 12 in the nation,
now hold a 9-3 mark in Six-Pac play
— one game behind the third-ranked
Cardinal, which is 10-2.
According to Stanford Coach Mark

Marquess, high rankings and winning
records are not the only things the
two teams have in common. "They're
a lot like us — consistent," Marquess
said. "Their pitchers throw strikes,
they play good defense and they like
to run."
They certainly do like to run. The
Bears have stolen 119 bases in 141
attempts, compared to 77 in 111 for
Stanford. Cal can hit, too. The Bears

have a team batting average of .309.
The Cardinal is hitting .318, including
an astounding .370 in league play.
Offensively, Cal is led by sopho
more outfielder Rich Aldrete. If that
last name sounds familiar, it's be
cause Rich's older brother is former
Stanford Ail-American Mike
Aldrete. Aldrete is hitting .361 for
the season.
Other Cal standouts include
catcher Mike Knapp (.351), Tim
Jester (.338, 7 HRs), Jeff Weiss
(.336, 8 HRs), and two-time All Pac
-10 selection Lance Blankenship
(.316, 28 stolen bases).
Mark Davis continues to pace the
Cardinal attack, although his average
has dipped to a mere .391. He is a
definite candidate for Six-Pac Player
of-the-Year honors with a .490
average in conference play. He also
has seven homers and 29 RBIs.
Walt Harris and Rick Lundblade
have been just as abusive to opposing
pitchers. Harris is batting .382, and
Lundblade has 11 homers and 39
RBIs to go with his .356 average.
Bear Coach Rich Milano will send
Mark Sampson (5-2, 2.61 ERA) to
the mound today. Marquess will
counter with Jeff Ballard (7-1, 3.71),
who is Stanford's career leader in
wins (30) and innings pitched
(348.1).
Ballard, a senior, is a veteran of the
Cal-Stanford rivalry. Cal and Arizona
State are "the biggest ones," he said.
"We always get up for them."
Although Cal leads the all-time se
ries 177-144, the Cardinal has
dominated the Bears in recent years.
Stanford has won 20 of the last 30
games between the teams, including
five out of six last season. Cal hasn't
won at Sunken Diamond in four
years.
Ballard feels that the key to ex

tending the Cardinal dominance will
be keeping the fleet Bears off the
bases. "They've got some power and
some good hitters, but their running
game is the biggest part of their
team," he said. "I've got to go to my
strengths — get the breaking ball
over when I'm behind and spot the
fastball. I have to keep the ball in the
yard and not walk anybody."
Despite the importance of the se

* ries, the team is not overly excited.'**
"It's big, but it's not do-or-die," Bal
lard said.
"We're always ready to play,"
Marquess said. "That's one of om;
strengths. We never get too up or too
down."
The series continues at Sunken
Diamond tomorrow at 2:30 p.m.,
then finishes with a 1 p.m. contest at
Berkeley on Saturday.
