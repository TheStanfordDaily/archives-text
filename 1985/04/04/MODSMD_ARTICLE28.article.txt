## UCLA softballers sweep Stanford Doom strikes down Card 
### DAVE DUTCHER Senior sportswriter 
For all but one team this season, a game
with UCLA's softball team has meant Doom,
namely standout pitcher Debbie Doom, the
best collegiate softball player in the country
last season.
Yesterday, Stanford became another team
to lose to Doom, 6-0 at Roble Field. The
Cardinal, which has yet to win in the Western
Collegiate Athletic Association this season,
then lost its fourth conference game, 6-0 to

the Bruins, the No. 2 team in the country, in
the nightcap.
"I hope they're both seniors," Stanford
Coach Kathy Lincoln said of Doom, 8-0, and
Tracy Compton. who struck out 14 en route
to the second-game victory. "I'm glad (top
ranked) Fullerton and UCLA are over with."
The Cardinal lost a double-header to Fuller
ton State March 15.
The defending national champion Bruins,
whose only loss in 17 outings was to Hawaii,
started off quickly in the first game — three of

their first four hitters scored in the first inning
off loser Lisa Buchanan. Designated hitter
Tricia Mang, who leads UCLA in RBIs, drove
in two with a triple. UCLA didn't finish the
game quite as strongly, scoring single runs in
the second, third and seventh inning.
Doom, meanwhile, did the job on the
mound. She gave up three hits and struck out
13, including seven of the last eight batters.
With the exception of senior Cathy Taft, who
led off the third with a double, no Stanford
players got past first base.
Nevertheless, Lincoln is pleased with the
Cardinal's progress at the plate, which began
during the Texas A&M Invitational March
29-31. Although it lost eight of nine games in
the round-robin tournament, Stanford's hit
ting has improved, Lincoln said.
"I felt good coming in after the tourna
ment. We hit well in the tournament," she
said. "It wasn't fantastic (yesterday), but we
hit the ball and made them field it. I think we
have more confidence at the plate.
"There's a difference in the the hitting be
tween the kids who were freshmen last year
who are sophomores now — it's phenomenal.
All the kids who were here last year are hit
ting."
They weren't against Compton, who held
the Cardinal to two hits. But the second game
was scoreless until the third inning, when
three UCLA runs followed a controversial
two-out call — the umpires ruled that out
fielder Taft trapped a fly ball. After the third,
the Bruins scored in each of the fourth, fifth
and sixth innings.
Stanford opens an eight-game road trip
today at Cal Poly-Pomona.

UCLA pitchers Debbie Doom and Traci Compton.
