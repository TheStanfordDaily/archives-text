# Cycling club wins three over break
## 
### 
The Stanford cycling club started the
collegiate racing season strongly, winning
the team title in three out of four races
over spring break. In the process it
amassed high point totals in crucial early
season races and defeated rival UC-Santa
Barbara.
The team scored 249 points at the Uvas
Dam Road Race March 23, 232 at the Ev
ergreen Community College Road Race
March 24 and 153 at the Berkeley Road
Race March 30, winning all three races.
Fatigued and somewhat out of practice tor
criteriums, the team scored only 70 points
at the Berkeley Criterium March 31, com
ing in fourth.
In its three wins, Stanford easily
defeated strong teams from California and
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo. Stanford edged
out UC-Santa Barbara — last year's top
team in the United States Cycling Federa
tion Western Division — at its March 30
race, showing that if the Cardinal contin
ues to score well, it may displace Santa
Barbara as the West's best collegiate team.
Meanwhile, senior Katrin Tobin proved

that she is rapidly becoming one of the best
women cyclists in the country by placing
16th overall in the Beatrice Bicycling Clas
sic in Texas. Tobin, sponsored by the Win
ning/Peugeot/Mavic team, was the Hth
American in the race, which included
many of the world's premier cyclists.
"1 was really encouraged because I ve
only been racing a year and 1 think I still
have a lot of potential," Tobin said. "Most
of the other women have been racing
anywhere from three to 12 years."
"I think it's an incredible performance,
Coach Tim Nicholson said. "She was
racing against the very best women in the
world and now she has an excellent shot of
making the national team."
Nicholson also said Expert riders Art
Walker, Brad Chen, Russell Mead and
Eric Topp performed well at the team s
races, as well as Novice riders Mike
Fadich, Mike Collins, Tom Moyer and
Henry Pasternak. Laura Rodman, Sarah
Carpenter, Sara Wilkins, Peggy McKee
and Dana Price rode well for the Stanford
women's team, Nicholson said.
