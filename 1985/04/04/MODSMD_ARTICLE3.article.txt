# LOTS additions may ease waits

Help niuv he on the wav for students who
spend long nights working on the University's
LOTS systems.
Two new main frames and plans for an im
proved queuing system could ease the burden on
students who now face prolonged waits to get
access to resources on the three LOTS computer
systems.
According to Sean Welsh, LOTS manager, a
computer system manufactured by Systems Con
cept Corp. is on order and could alleviate some
overcrowding, although he couldn't specify who
would have access to that system. "We haven't
made any decisions about how we will allocate
that source," he said.
Oueenette Baur, LOTS administrator, said the
new system will be tested this summer and "will
probably be up next fall."
LOTS now uses three DEC System 20 main
frames produced by the Digital Equipment Cor
poration, Baur said, adding that each presently
services about 2,000 users.
Baur said that a new system produced by IBM
"just arrived" at CERAS and will be incor
porated for use "very soon." The system, part of
IBM's Advanced Education Project grant, will be
used "in support of academic and research com
puting in the social sciences under the terms of
IBM."
As the LOTS systems now operate, students
not only face long waits to get a terminal, but
sometimes find there are insufficient resources
available for use once a terminal opens.
"LOTS has always been behind in having
enough resources for demand," said Baur.
"We've just barely survived the demand in the
past."
Overcrowding is worse during Dead Week
when many students working on final programs
for computer science classes compete for access
to one of the system's resources. During winter
quarter, each system could simultaneously han

dle 40 users, according to Welsh.
According to Welsh, students are partially to
blame for the lengthy waits they experience at
the end of each quarter.
"Students, in general, are very bad managers
of their time," Welsh said, noting that most stu
dents procrastinate and don't begin working on
final programs until the last minute. "Everybody
is in here during Dead Week," he said.
With the exception of Dead Week, Welsh said
there is "not really" an overcrowding problem.
"The capacity is available at other times," Welsh
said, adding that LOTS is under-utilized during
the early weeks of each quarter.
According to several students, however, the
overcrowding problems exist throughout each
quarter and only increase during Dead Week.
Sophomore Matt Sinder, an international rela

tions major who took Computer Science 106 last
fall, said the busiest period he experienced was in
the middle of the quarter when programs were
assigned on a weekly basis. He said that at the
end of the quarter he had two weeks to work on
his programs.
"There was one time at 5 in the morning when
1 couldn't get on because all the terminals were
taken and there was no system to limit time use,"
Sinder said.
Sinder also noted that "there seemed to be a
lot of overcrowding because different classes had
their programs due on the same day. There
should be better communication between the in
structors of the classes to avoid that situation."

Two new main frames at LOTS could help students who sometimes have to suffer through
terminal shortages and long queues as they wait to use computer terminals here.
