## 'Return of the Soldier': enjoyable, well-acted Rebecca West's novel becomes an effective film, recreating the fragile epoch of post-WWI England 
### STEVE VINEBERG Editorial staff 
' Rebecca West's remarkably deft
arid economical 1918 novel "The
Return of the Soldier" — her first —
is a small, glittering fragment of the
intellectual thought of its epoch. Two
women await the return of Chris
Baldry from the Great War: his wife
Kitty, a gorgeous, petted doll, and his
cousin Jenny, who is plain but
devoted. Both love Chris, and both
depend on him to order their lives;
even in his absence, he dictates their
roles in England's propertied class —
as patient attendants and keepers of
the home fires. When he is sent back,
however, he is amnesiac. He has
"lost" nearly 15 years and his only
thoughts are of a middle-class
woman, Margaret Allington, whom
he loved as a youth; he doesn't re
member how their romance ended or
anything that followed, including his
marriage to Kitty. His damaged men
tal state places Kitty in the absurd po
sition of stranger in her own home,
trying to win anew the affections of
the man she has called her husband
for a decade, and furthermore, she
has a rival she never knew existed —
a rival, moreover, whom she would in
the normal course of events consider
beneath notice.
Surface and depth are West's con
trolling metaphor. Kitty and Jenny
stri've to preserve the calm surface of
a well defined aristocratic life, not
wishing to probe beneath it, but when
Chfis returns so severely altered, his
manliness— the cornerstone of their
fragile world — dissipated into an
aging boyishness ("our splendid sane
Chris, all broken and queer"), that
elegant exterior is disturbed and their
fivds thrown into turmoil. Kitty sends
for Margaret, confident that when he
sees the object of his youthful adora
tion pocked by age and poverty he
will naturally turn from her to Kitty
(whose day-to-day existence is con
cerned with retaining her china-doll
prettiness), but to her alarm, he leaps
past the marks of time and class on
Margaret's face and sees only the
wfoman he loves.
Reading this highly accomplished
debut novel, in which the finely
wrriught prose illuminates the theme
(Jenny is the first-person narrator),
we gaze into a mirror reflecting the
concerns of England's educated men
and women in the bustling
"modernity" after World War I. It's
all there — the slow cracking of the
class system, the early feminist con
sciousness (Virginia Woolf had pub
lished her first book, "The Voyage

Out," three years before), and espe
cially Freud, whose theories hung in
the air like the thick, heady smell of
gardenias. "The Return of the Sol
dier" shares its major conflict with
Pirandello's masterpiece, "Henry
IV" (which he wrote in 1921):
Should we satisfy our hunger for self
knowledge by sounding the depths of
our personalities, a process that in
evitably brings pain with it, or should
we maintain an idyll which we pay for
with our ignorance? Wedging two
relationships in separate time frames
next to each other, West has in effect
juxtaposed two idylls and two
traumas that cannot coexist; as long
as Chris remains tied to the past,
Kitty's domestic bliss is impossible,
but the moment he is snapped back to
the present (and there is a key that
will achieve this psychological reloca
tion, just as there is in "Henry IV" —
in Freudian literature of this period,
there is always a key) his idyll is shat
tered, permanently.
We can no longer come as close to
a novel like this as readers once
could, but the emotional and esthetic
distance we maintain from it has
become one of its pleasures, and Alan
Bridges, who directed the film ver
sion, has duplicated that pleasure. Su
perbly designed (by Luciana Arrighi)
and costumed (by Shirley Russell),
"The Return of the Soldier" is a most
enjoyable film that resists the obvious
temptation — to parody its source —
without pretending it isn't a relic of
an earlier age. Hugh Whitemore, the
screenwriter (a playwright in sudden
demand, he is responsible for the cur
rent Broadway drama, "Pack of
Lies," as well as the teleplays
"Concealed Enemies" and "A Dedi
cated Man"), has made no attempt to
contemporize West's story, and his
fidelity accentuates the enormous dif
ference between the vision of West's
era and our own without mocking
either. Yes, the movie is a safe, com
fortable experience — how could any
film version of this material be potent
today? — but the plushly beautiful
reconstructions of Edwardian En
gland and the corresponding
reproduction of the late Edwardian
sensibility could not have been easily
arrived at; a true period piece, like
this one is, is an extremely difficult
proposition. There are a few errors —
an overdeveloped attention to
Jenny's feelings for her cousin, which
are better left as suggestions, some
fairly bald Freudian imagery, and the
photographer, Stephen Goldblatt
(though his work is very competent),
might have found a more original vis

ual approach than the memory haze
he employs throughout the picture —
but not many. And the cast could
scarcely be improved upon: Alan
Bates plays Chris, Julie Christie is
Kitty, Glenda Jackson is Margaret,
and Frank Finlay and lan Holm make
brief but memorable appearances as

Margaret's husband, William Grey,
and Dr. Anderson, who treats Chris
(and who is the voice of the Freudian
debate over whether or not his pa
tient should be heaved into a troubled
present). The only major performer
in the film who scores less than a
resounding success is Ann-Margret,

whom Bridges has (oddly) cast as
Jenny.
Ann-Margret isn't a bad actress,
but the current widespread apprecia
tion for her talents is still a little
premature. In fact, whenever she
does adequate work (in the 1971
"Carnal Knowledge," for example),

When we catch our first glimpse of
Julie Christie, she is having her hair
washed by a servant; leaning back,
luxuriating in the sensual comfort her
position allows her.

many reviewers tend to overrate it,
out of an exaggerated response to the
strides she's taken since her young
sexpot days; when she played
Blanche Dußois last year in the TV
"Streetcar Named Desire" she
received so much praise for her per
formance that one wondered whether

her enthusiasts had ever seen Vivien
Leigh in the part. She gave an intelli
gent reading, line for line, hut she
made Blanche seem so normal and
well adjusted in the first half that you
couldn't make any sense out of this
woman's fantastic history, and she
banalized Tennessee Williams'
poetry. Every now and then she
exposed a raucous inner edge that,
though it wasn't appropriate for
Blanche, was entertaining in its own
right, and I realized that was what I
had always enjoyed Ann-Margret for
— that and her beauty. Casting an
actress who looks like Ann-Margret
in a role like Jenny is like selecting a
stunning woman to play Sonia in
"Uncle Vanya" and then trying to
make her look unattractive; either
you fail, in which case the experiment
looks foolish, or else you succeed but
in doing so blot out the qualities that
drew us to the actress in the first
place. (That is what occurred when
Mia Farrow buried herself in the part
ot the nightclub singer's mistress in
"Broadway Danny Rose.") Ann-
Margret carries Jenny off, more or
less, but she doesn't give us a reason

to watch her — and partly that is the
fault of the role, a sort of female Nick
Carraway, emotionally involved with
the protagonists but really removed
from the central struggle. Part of the
problem, too, is that she can't hope to
sustain our interest when those daz
zling British actors are on screen.
Bates, Christie, Jackson and Frank
Finlay are all particularly gifted mem
bers of the generation of English
performers that first attracted the
notice of film audiences in the mid
-19605. Bates played the reticent, un
worldly stranger tutored by Anthony
Ouinn in "Zorba the Greek" in 1964;
the following year, Frank Finlay
countered Olivier's "Othello" with
one of the most brilliant lagos of the
century, and Julie Christie starred in
"Darling" and "Dr. Zhivago."
Glenda Jackson recreated the role of
Charlotte Corday, which she had
played on stage, in the 1967 film of
Peter Brook's "Marat/Sade." These
actors (and lan Holm) have played
together on stage and screen — Jack
son and Bates in "Women in Love,"


Julie Christie is excellent as Kitty, the wife of the returning soldier
(Alan Bates), who struggles to regain the love of her husband in "The

Return of the Soldier." Ann-Margret plays Jenny, the soldier's cousin
Glenda Jackson also stars.
