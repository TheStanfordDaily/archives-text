Howard Jones — Dream Into
Action ★ ★ ★ V2
Perhaps the best thing to happen
to the synth pop scene in the last
couple years has been the concept
of melody. Whereas some bands
like Depeche Mode and Shriekback
get away with pounding, droning
rhythm tracks and little else,
Howard Jones succeeds by inject
ing infectious, upbeat melody lines
and making songs into actual songs.
This increases the listenability of
his music considerably. Where his
debut, "Human's Lib," was filler!

The Power Station — The Power
Station ★ ★
This stuff is definitely pretty
boring. Nothing like Duran Duran
(it should be half like Duran
Duran) and too much like Robert
Palmer (it should only be a quarter
like Palmer). His tiresome vocal
style and the monotonous, un
changing instrumentation fail to
elevate any songs from the rest, and
ultimately the whole album sounds
like it might have been released five
years ago — so that we'd all have
forgotten about it by now. The
pounding drums obliterate any real
bass line or guitar work that

with more tension and ability to
reflect, here the sound is somewhat
more relaxed, comfortable, and less
aggressive. Though this lends itself
more to the play lists of the coaser
vative hits-oriented stations of the
world, Jones' songs and arrange
ments still distinguish themselves
from all the rest. His one-man
band synthesizer approach still
works beautifully (even in concert)
and integrates perfectly with his
voice. If he resists the lucrative pull
of commercialism long enough to
fully develop his own strengths, the

over the British Invasion. Witness
the rave reviews of John Fogerty,
X, and Bruce Springsteen. These
artists are excellent, of course —
and now there's a definite trend
toward good ol' this-is-what-it's
like-to-live-in-New-Jersey-or-any-
other-economically-depressed-area
music. Well, Tom Petty is adding
his interpretation of life in the
South. And though the songs are
consistently good and the sound is
solid and diverse enough for enjoy
able listening, Petty's lyrics fail to
communicate the American Exper
ience quite as well as the others.
This isn't a major flaw, but the arri-

and trite, as well as unexciting.
Power Station's cover of "Bang a
Gong (Get It On)" adds nothing to
the original T. Rex version and
seems designed only to take up
space and to provide easy airplay.
Even Duran Duran abominations
like "Is There Something I Should
Know" seem more inspired and ar
tistic. And when Duran Duran
seems inspired and artistic by com
parison, you know Power Station's
got real problems. There's little
reason to buy this one-song-more
than-an-EP — there was little
enough reason to record it in the
first place.

val of this album has been accom
panied by such hype and publicity
that its non-classic nature disap
points at first. Still, almost every
song is catchy and grows on you,
and Petty has captured some
Southern spirit in his music without
drawing too heavily on established
groups or styles. The sound isn't
markedly different than that on
previous albums, and probably
won't substantially change Petty's
audience; but its consistency and
quality make it one of his best so
far.

Southern Accents ★ ★ ★ V2
It's very fashionable right now to
jump on anything roots-oriented or
Americana and tout it as victory


Durannies John Taylor and Andy
Taylor might be providing, and
result in songs that are mainstream


combination of tomorrow's tech
nology and Jones' creativity will
prove formidable.
