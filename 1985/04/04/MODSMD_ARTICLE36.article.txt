# Committee investigates hazing
## 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
On the eve of fraternity rush here, an Inter-Fraternity
Council (IFC) committee is conducting an investigation of
hazing in order to issues recommendations on clarifying
University policy.
The committee will be headed by Bruce Friedman,
vice-president of the IFC, and will include four other fra
ternity members. Formed at the end of winter quarter, the
committee is now investigating fraternity hazing and will
issue recommendations at the end of this quarter.
If the IFC approves the committee's recommendations,
they will be implemented at the beginning of next year,
according to Rick Hoskins, president of the IFC.
"They will be recommending some sort of system to
ensure all people pledging fraternities know what hazing
is and to make sure hazing doesn't occur," Hoskins said.
Last quarter, the Phi Delta Theta fraternity was put on
probation for hazing. At that time, Hoskins said there was
confusion as to whether the specific event constituted
hazing.
"It wasn't that Res Ed and the IFC disagreed," Hoskins
said. "There was just ambiguity in that we didn't know
how to define hazing. It can be a confusing term.
"Nobody knows to what extent hazing goes on at Stan
ford, and depending on how you define it, that can vary,"
he said.

Norm Robinson, associate dean of Student Affairs f<jr
Residential Education, said Res Ed is not involved in the
hazing investigation and has left it up to the IFC to deal
with the matter.
"What we would like is for the IFC and the ISC (Inter-
Sorority Council) to take care of their own concerns, just
as they did when they issued the party guidelines after the
Beta incident," Robinson said. "But we'll certainly be in
terested in what they come up with."
In that November incident, four students accused a
male student of attackng them at a Beta Theta Pi party
and subsequently filed charges with Stanford police.
Diana Conklin, assistant dean of Res Ed and director of
the Row, applauded the IFC for its willingness to look
into the entire hazing issue. Res Ed's approval of the
recommendations will not be needed unless the IFC seeks
it, Conklin said.
Andy Cohen, president of the Phi Delta Theta frater
nity, said the definition of hazing currently used by the
University is vague.
Hoskins said the purpose of the committee's recom
mendations is mainly informational.
"If anything, there will be a benefit because everybody'
will know what their rights are and that will help make
sure hazing doesn't happen," he said.
