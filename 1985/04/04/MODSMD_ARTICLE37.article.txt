## Experts tell of Europe fear 
### DEBORAH KEHLE Staff writer 
Europeans are asking themselves
"what the hell's going on" with the
United States' arms policy, Gina
Cowen, a fellow at Stanford's Cen
ter for International Security and
Arms Control, said here last night.
Cowen told a small group that
the extremes and reversals in U.S.
defense strategy have left the
NATO countries feeling as though
"they're always coming five
minutes too late" — whenever
NATO concurs with a change in
U.S. policy, another change occurs
which negates the first one. She
cited the frequent reversals over
the ratification of the SALT II arms
treaty as an example. The result is
an increase in "disaffection and dis
trust" of the United States in
Europe.
The Strategic Defense Initiative,
popularly known as "Star Wars,"
heightens this distrust, according to
Cowen. Traditionally, nuclear
weapons were thought to he a
deterrent to conventional warfare.
The European members of NATO
relied upon the threat of U.S. nu
clear intervention to protect them
from Soviet aggression. A "Star
Wars" system would rely on defen
sive systems to destroy missiles, and
many Europeans feel such a change
in strategy, from dependence on of
fensive retaliation to defensive ca
pability, "will leave Europe vulner
able," Cowen said.
European fears may not be well
founded because the "Star Wars"

defense is still in the theoretical
stage, she said. Moreover, a defen
sive system would not necessarily
detract from deterrence in Europe.
Cowen went on to point out that
the current system does not neces
sarily protect Europe.
"Deterrence only deters a war
which is rationally comtemplated,"
she said. "There may be silly things
. . . one little crisis here, one little
crisis there" which might
precipitate conventional warfare in
Europe.
"The Europeans haven't both
ered to think beyond the nuclear
threshold," Cowen said.
Although, she said, the

Europeans are "desperate to see
improvement in superpower rela
tions" and want a return to detente,
their defense is based on being "on
the verge of losing" in a conven
tional war with the Soviets, thus
provoking the United States into a
nuclear confrontation with the So
viet Union on their behalf.
Cowen was joined in the Rin
conada talk by by David Gress, a
visiting scholar at the Hoover Insti
tution and specialist on the NATO
alliance.
The Rinconada discussion was
part of the Great Decisions 1985
speakers series sponsored by
Stanford-In-Government.
