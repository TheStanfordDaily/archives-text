The 10 students honored by the
winter quarter Dean's Awards for
Service range from the president of
the Inter-Fraternity Council to the
Daily cartoonist who created the
Deedleman series.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons announced the recipients of
the awards for winter quarter last
week. The six include five individual
honors and one award to a collective
of five women.
The award is given # each quarter,
but does not necessarily represent a
special effort during that quarter.
Rather, it recognizes a cumulative ef
fort by the student, either graduate or
undergraduate.
Those recognized this quarter are:
• Wendell Hades, graduate student in
applied physics. Lyons recognized
Eadcs for his "years of service to the
Stanford student chapter of the In

and steady involvement, ensuring
that lEEE functions and programs
occur as planned and meet the needs
of the student membership.'

• Elizabeth Ehrlich, senior in politi
cal science. Erlich received the award
"for her enduring, creative and suc
cessful efforts to promote public ser

founder of the Stanford Volunteer
Network and coordinator of
residence representatives for commu
nity service projects, and also as the
inspiration and hard work behind the
Public Service Summer Fellowship
Program." Lyons said.
• Rick Hoskins. senior in electrical
engineering. He has received the
award "for his leadership of the
Inter-Fraternity Council, displaying a
rare combination of vision, devotion,
honor and tough-mindedness; for
hard work and success, as head of the
Heritage Fund, raising money for un
dergraduate scholarships." Lyons
said.
• Susan Mathison, senior in human
biology. Mathison's "four years of
service to her fellow students as a stu
dent assistant in DAPER's Sports
Medicine Section'' was cited, along
with her "readiness to play other
roles — resident assistant, friend and
confidante, bully, adviser, cheer
leader— whatever will help the men
ding process."

• Mark Wilson, senior in studio art.
Wilson received the award for
"gently leading us to view our foibles
and consider our absurdities; for sel
ling the originals of his cartoons to
benefit the Stanford Children's
Hospital; and for the compassion,
nenerositv and humanitv thai distin

guish both his art and his person."
