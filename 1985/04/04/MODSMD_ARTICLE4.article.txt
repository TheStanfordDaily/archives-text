The 10 students honored by the
winter quarter Dean's Awards for
Service range from the president of
the Inter-Fraternity Council to the
Daily cartoonist who created the
Deedleman series.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons announced the recipients of
the awards for winter quarter last
week. The six include five individual
honors and one award to a collective
of five women.
The award is given # each quarter,
but does not necessarily represent a
special effort during that quarter.
Rather, it recognizes a cumulative ef
fort by the student, either graduate or
undergraduate.
Those recognized this quarter are:
• Wendell Hades, graduate student in
applied physics. Lyons recognized
Eadcs for his "years of service to the
Stanford student chapter of the In
stitute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers . . . and for his pragmatic
and steady involvement, ensuring
that lEEE functions and programs
occur as planned and meet the needs
of the student membership.'

• Elizabeth Ehrlich, senior in politi
cal science. Erlich received the award
"for her enduring, creative and suc
cessful efforts to promote public ser
vice among Stanford students — as a
founder of the Stanford Volunteer
Network and coordinator of
residence representatives for commu
nity service projects, and also as the
inspiration and hard work behind the
Public Service Summer Fellowship
Program." Lyons said.
• Rick Hoskins. senior in electrical
engineering. He has received the
award "for his leadership of the
Inter-Fraternity Council, displaying a
rare combination of vision, devotion,
honor and tough-mindedness; for
hard work and success, as head of the
Heritage Fund, raising money for un
dergraduate scholarships." Lyons
said.
• Susan Mathison, senior in human
biology. Mathison's "four years of
service to her fellow students as a stu
dent assistant in DAPER's Sports
Medicine Section'' was cited, along
with her "readiness to play other
roles — resident assistant, friend and
confidante, bully, adviser, cheer
leader— whatever will help the men
ding process."

• Mark Wilson, senior in studio art.
Wilson received the award for
"gently leading us to view our foibles
and consider our absurdities; for sel
ling the originals of his cartoons to
benefit the Stanford Children's
Hospital; and for the compassion,
nenerositv and humanitv thai distin

guish both his art and his person."
• Women's Guide Collective, made
up of Francesca Flynn. Celeste
Landry. Lisa Laumann, Joan Vlan
cuso, Zoevonda Sutton and Jennifer
Watson. The award recognizes the

arc doing a lot of work." He said he
was "happy that the University
recognizes the work of the IFC."
Hoskins said he also appreciates
the recognition of his works as the na
tional chairman for the Heritage
Fund. He said he hiked this year's
fund-raising goal from $40,000 to
$60,000 , adding that the fund will at
least make the goal. He calls the op
portunity for students to work on the
fund "unique to Stanford" and "good
for students because they get to
mingle with business people."
When Wilson found out he had
been called to Lyons' office, he says
he thought, "Oh my God, what did I
do wrong?" He said he "thought it
had something to do with my aca
demic record, which has never been
spectacular."
Mathison says that her job in the
training room involves 25 to 30 hours
each week with nine other students
and staff members. She says they do
"everything from taping ankles and
knees to treating blisters and cuts."

group's "tireless pursuit of the goal of
producing an updated and improved
Women's Guide to Stanford; for their
success in producing an attractive
publication that pulls together infor
mation previously dispersed all over
campus."
Ehrlich said she was surprised at
the award, adding that the volunteer
network has continued to grow since
she did an internship last year with
Catherine Milton, special assistant to
the University president. Public ser
vice opportunities at Stanford have
grown "in the number of opportuni
ties and number of people participat
ing .. . two or three years ago nobody
knew what it (public service) meant.
Hoskins said he also was surprised
to receive the award because, "first, a
lot of my work was with fraternities,
and, second, because a lot of people
