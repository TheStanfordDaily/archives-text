# Blood dearth
## AIDS scares some donors 
### TODD RAMMING Staff writer 
The Stanford University Blood
Bank is falling 10 percent short of its
goal for the current fiscal year due, in
large part, to a widespread public fear
of contracting the deadly AIDS virus,
according to Rhoda Burns, supervisor
of blood donor recruitment.
Donations to the University Blood
Bank, which supplies blood to Stan
ford Hospital and Children's Hospi
tal, have dropped about 4 percent in
the last several months to an average
of 1,550 units. Burns said.
The blood bank received only
9,400 units of blood as of February
for the current fiscal year, which
began Sept. 1. Last fiscal year the
blood bank received 18.500 units of
blood.
Burns said, however, that the fear
of acquiring AIDS (acquired immune
deficiency syndrome) from donating
blood is unfounded.
"People don't seem to realize that
all collection of blood is done with
disposable equipment and that there
is absolutely no risk of contracting
AIDS or any other infection from
donating blood," she said.
While Stanford has always been
able to obtain blood in the past, from
a supplemental source if necessary,
shortages have swept across the Bay
Area. The current dearth in the Bay
Area's blood supply "is already
alarming and if we don't see a big
turn-around in live to six weeks,
we're going to have a chronic
shortage of blood â€” and that would
be a crisis.'' said Brian MeDonough.
executive director of the Irwin
Memorial Blood Bank in San Fran
cisco.
While an acute emergency could
still be met by a network of blood
banks from across the country, "in
terms of everyday functioning, we
(Stanford) do not have an untapped
supplemental source and we need to
get the number of donors up," said
Carl Grumet, associate director of the
blood bank
The only solution lies in increased
public participation in blood drives
because "artificial bloods are tempo
rary at best, highly expensive and still
at the research stage," said Roger
Svoboda, an administrator at the
Stanford Medical School Blood Cen
ter.
In an effort to inform the public on
the safety of giving blood. Irwin
Memorial has budgeted "a lot of
money for marketing and education,"
Burns said. While Stanford has not
begun such a program, "we will meet
with any group that would like more
information." Burns said.
No danger exists to the blood
donor, but transfusion recipients are
at a risk of receiving AIDS con
taminated blood.
Burns said members of high risk
populations, including ga\s. have

been "very responsible locally in
deferring themselves from being
blood donors at this time."
In a continuing effort to protect the
patient population, Stanford became
on July 1, 1983 the first blood bank in
the nation to begin screening for the
AIDS virus. Since the institution of
the screening, no cases of AIDS have
been reported in patients receiving
blood from the Stanford bank. Burns
said.
Two recipients of blood from
various centers in the area, including
Stanford before the screening was in
stituted, contracted transfusion
related AIDS and one has died, ac
cording to Edgar Engleman, associate
professor of pathology and medicine
and medical director of the blood
center.
At a cost of about $6 per donor,
the current test is able to detect an
abnormal ratio in the white blood cell
composition, Engleman said. Unfor
tunately, the abnormal ratio of sup
pressor T-cells to helper T-cells de
tected in the Stanford test shows up in
approximately 1.5 percent of the
donors who do not have AIDS,
Engleman said.
Recently, Stanford has concluded
testing on a new screening test which,
it is estimated, would exclude only
one-half of 1 percent of the donor
population without AIDS, Svoboda
said.
The new screening process, termed
the HTLV-111 test, "is trying to
detect someone who has produced
antibodies after being exposed to
AIDS," Svoboda said. Engleman said
this new test is more specific, because
it tests for evidence that the patient
actually has been exposed to AIDS,
rather than the highly accurate but in
direct evidence of measuring T-cell
ratios.
The new and cheaper HTLV-111
test would also be more effective in
exposing "potential carriers" of
AIDS. Such carriers, bearing the
AIDS in an incubation stage, would
manifest no noticeable symptoms of
AIDS, save the presence of the an
tibodies detected by the HTLV-111
test. Svoboda said.
If donor samples are detected as
carrying AIDS, the blood will be im
mediately discarded from the donor
pool and several repeat tests will be
carried out on the sample, Svoboda
said. Upon final verification of AIDS
by an outside lab, verfication which
could take up to 10 months, "we will
notify them (the donors with
AIDS)," Svoboda said.
Notification cannot be given any
earlier than three months after the
donation, as required by law in order
to prevent high risk populations from
using the blood banks as testing
centers for AIDS, he said.
"We will be keeping an internal
registry" and the names of patients
will be added to a national registry
which is available to all blood banks.
The national registry serves only to
identify individuals carrying diseases

transmissible through the blood and
does not specifically identify one as a
bearer of AIDS, Svoboda said.
Fearing the real, but ever
decreasing, danger of AIDS, the
practice of "directed donors" has
become very popular, Burns said. By
this program, blood is donated by a
particular donor for a specific

recipient. Whereas only 28 donors
participated in the program in the
past fiscal year, 418 have already
contributed units through the pro T
gram this fiscal year, according to
Burns. .
Currently, however, "we don't
have enough blood" for the general
population, Burns said.
