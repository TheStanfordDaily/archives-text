Japan to send envoy to Washington
TOKYO — Japan accused a U.S. Senate committee of proposing dis
criminatory action on trade between the two countries and says it will
send a special envoy to Washington today.
Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe said he was sending Reishi Teshima, a
deputy foreign minister, to Washington to discuss the situation. Abe
himself has an April 13 meeting scheduled with Secretary of State
George Shultz in the U.S. capital.
Tne Senate committee said it was acting because of alleged discrimi
nation by Japan in restricting access of U.S. goods to its markets. Trade
ran nearly $37 billion in Japan's favor in 1984.
Japanese government officials defended recent steps to permit foreign
competition in telecommunications business, but said opening the mar
ket does not guarantee the sale of foreign goods.
The Senate Finance Committee approved legislation Tuesday by a 12-
4 vote that would compel President Reagan to impose tariffs and quotas
on Japanese goods unless he can obtain compensation for sales lost
through what it called "unfair trade practices."
A Foreign Ministry statement in response said: "The government of
Japan hopes, for the sake of good bilateral relations between Japan and
the United States, that the bill will not pass the U.S. Congress."
It called the legislation "not only a discriminatory bill singling out
Japan but also a threat to the entire free trade system itself."
Telecommunications is a key area of interest to the United States,
along with electronics, forest products and medical supplies.
Sen. Frank Murkowski told Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
during a two-day visit that there is a crisis in trade relations and
Congress is trying to "gain attention from Japan."
Sales of Japanese goods in the United States exceeded U.S. sales here
by $36.8 billion in 1984. U.S. congressmen have accused Japan of erect
ing unfair barriers to foreign products.
Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, told reporters Congress does not
believe retaliatory moves will resolve tfie trade conflict.
"We are waiting short of introducing protectionist legislation because
we know that isn't the answer," he said. Murkowski heads the East
Asian subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Japan customarily has blamed much of the trade imbalance on high
U.S. interest rates and the strong dollar, which makes U.S. goods expen
sive, but also has promised to reveal more market-opening measures
April 9.
The Kyodo news agency quoted government sources as saying the
package would eliminate tariffs on imported industrial products over a
three-year period beginning next year, and lower tariffs on agricultural
goods.
Israel frees prisoners in Lebanon
ANSAR, Lebanon — The Israeli army freed more than 750 prisoners
in southern Lebanon yesterday and many of the released men chanted
"Khomeini, Khomeini" and shouted defiance of the Israeli occupiers.
With its withdrawal from Lebanon only weeks away, the Israelis
closed the Ansar prison camp, freed the prisoners and sent a fleet of
trucks to dismantle other military positions.
The prisoners — many of them Shiite Moslems who espouse the
teachings of Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini — chanted
"God is great. War until victory. Khomeini, Khomeini" as they sat in Is
raeli army trucks that took them from Ansar to the Lebanese villages
where they were freed.
Some had their hands tied in front of them with strips of white plastic,
but the rest clapped and made V for victory signs with their fingers.
"We love Khomeini. He knows everything," a 20-year-old Shiite said.
The young prisoner identified himself only as Jihad, an Arabic word that
means "holy war."
-On Tuesday, the Israelis took 1,100 other Ansar prisoners to a new
detention center in Israel. The release of about a tftird of the prisoners
wastiesigned to ease tensions with southern Lebanon's increasingly hos
tile Shiite Moslems.
Israel's transfer of an estimated 1,100 Lebanese prisoners to a deten
tion center in Israel appears to be inconsistent with Geneva Convention
regulations governing war prisoners, the State Department said yester
day.
In response to a question, the department said the United States has
consistently held the view that the convention applies to areas of
Lebanon under Israeli occupation.
It noted that the convention states that "protected persons" are to be
detained only within the occupied country and that "their transfer to the
territory of the occupying power is prohibited."
The department said that while Israel's actions appear to be inconsis
tent with the Geneva convention, it added that Israeli spokesmen have
said that the detained people will be released at a later date.
About 20 staffers of the International Red Cross monitored the
release of the prisoners from Ansar yesterday. Michel Cagneaux, head
of the relief agency's Tel Aviv office, said the unofficial count showed
758 prisoners were released. But Yossi, the camp commander, put the
figure at 752.
Panel approves foreign aid bill
WASHINGTON — The House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday
approved a $14.5 billion foreign aid bill, including $1.5 billion in extra
aid for Israel, despite Reagan administration warnings it could undercut
negotiations with the Jewish state for economic reforms.
As a final step before sending the full bill to floor of the House, the
committee added the emergency aid for Israel to help it cope with an
economic crisis.
Israel already was to receive $3 billion in arms and cash grants under
the bill, which is for the fiscal year beginning next October 1.
The committee, whose action generally followed the recommen
dations of its regional subcommittees, also approved:
• $5 million for military assistance to non-communist resistance forces
fighting the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia.
• A cut in recommended military aid to the Philippines to encourage
reforms in the country's armed forces.
• A ban on aid to Pakistan unless President Reagan certifies the aid will
help keep the country from building a nuclear bomb.
• A requirement that the administration certify that Saudi Arabia is
helping move toward Middle East peace before going through with a
previously approved sale of AWACS radar planes to the Saudis.
• A ban on direct or indirect U.S. aid to the Chinese family-planning
program because of reports of infanticide and forced abortion to hold
down China's population growth.
Salvadoran elections upheld
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — The Central Election Council
rejected a petition yesterday from rightist parties to void the results of
this week's national elections, the council's president said.
The council president, Mario Samayoa, said representatives of two
rightist parties joined him in unanimously rejecting a petition filed by
their own parties asking that Sunday's elections be annulled because of
alleged fraud.
The announcement came shortly after the country's military leader
ship denied charges that the armed forces had pressured people to vote
for President Jose Napoleon Duarte's centrist Christian Democratic
Party in the legislative and municipal elections.
Samayoa, who represents the Christian Democrats on the council, said
the official count of votes would resume Monday, after the Easter Week
vacation period has ended.
The Christian Democrats say their count shows they won 33 of the 60
National Assembly seats. The Central Elections Council has not yet
released official results.
Francico Merino, representative of the extreme right Republican
Nationalist Alliance on the council, said the panal agreed that elections
at a national level could not be annulled "because of irregularities in a
few municipalities."
Gen. Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova, the defense minister, earlier
read a communique at a news conference rejecting rightist charges of
military interference. He was accompanied by members of the military
high command.
