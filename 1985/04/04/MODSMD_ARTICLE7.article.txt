# Senate approves benefit phase out
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Senate
unanimously approved and sent to
President Reagan yesterday a bill
to phase out federal jobless benefits
for 339,000 unemployed Americans
who otherwise faced an abrupt cutoff
of payments this week.
Senate Majority Leader Robert
Dole (R-Kan.) said he was "fairly
certain" President Reagan would sign
the $160 million measure, which
passed by a 94-0 vote.
The phase-out bill, approved in the
House on Tuesday, enables un
employed workers already receiving
benefits as of this week to continue
getting their checks after the program
expires.
If Reagan were to veto the bill, no
checks could be written after Satur
day, even if workers had not received
the full 14 weeks of checks.
"It's this bill or nothing," Robert
Packwood (R-Ore.), Senate finance
committee chairman, said before the
vote was taken. "It would be unfair to
jerk the rug out from under people
getting benefits and who expect to
receive their full allotment of pay
ments."
Before passing the phase-out, the
Senate rejected two amendments that
Packwood said would cause Reagan
to veto the bill.
The first amendment, sponsored by
Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) would
have extended the Federal Supple

mental Compensation program for
six months. It was defeated 58-34.
The second measure, introduced by
Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) would
have made it easier for states with
high unemployment to qualify for ex
tended state-federal jobless pay
ments. That amendment went down
62-32.
The Federal Supplemental Com
pensation Program provides up to 14
weeks of payments to jobless workers
who have exhausted their 26 weeks of
state benefits. The president wanted
to let the three-year-old program die
when it expires Saturday.
The House approved the phase-out
plan Tuesday on a voice vote hours
after its Ways and Means Committee
endorsed it. The rush tactics were ne
cessary so that the bill could be sent
to Reagan before the Easter-
Passover recess begins Thursday.
Under the phase-out plan, un
employed workers already receiving
benefits as of this week would con
tinue to get their checks after the pro
gram expires. If Reagan vetoes the
bill, no checks can be written after
Saturday, even if workers had not
received the full 14 weeks of checks.
But Packwood said the phase-out,
estimated to cost $160 million to
$180 million, is the costliest proposal
Reagan and Republicans in Congress
would accept.
