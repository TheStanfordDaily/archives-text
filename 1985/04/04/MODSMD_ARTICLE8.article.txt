# Republicans seek deficit reductions
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€”
Negotiators for the White House
and Senate Republican leaders
struggled yesterday to complete
agreement on a multi-billion dol
lar package of spending cuts to
reduce federal deficits, but said
differences remained over Social
Security, defense and education.
"We hope to conclude prelimi
nary work today," Senate
Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-
Kan.) told reporters after meeting
with President Reagan at the
White House and a few hours
before the formal talks resumed
on Capitol Hill.
White House spokesman Larry
Speakes said any deficit-reduction
plan would be brought to Reagan
for his review, but added, "1 would
anticipate that the president would
give a nod very quickly." He said
there was a "good chance" that
could take place before the presi
dent's scheduled departure for a
California vacation tomorrow.
But after reaching tentative
agreement on a $14 billion, three
year package of farm program cuts
Tuesday, sources said negotiators
at a preliminary morning session
quickly ran into difficulty when
some senators objected to
Reagan's call for sharp reductions
in education programs, including

student loans.
Sources close to the negotia
tions added that while no final
decisions had been made, there
was an "inclination" to accept
Reagan's recommendation to
eliminate the federal subsidy for
Amtrak, most Small Business Ad
ministration functions and the Ur
ban Development Action Grant
program.
On the other hand, the sources
said Reagan's proposal to end
grants for mass transit was likely
to be rejected in favor of a reduc
tion in funding.
Dole told reporters the two
sides had yet to discuss defense
spending and Social Security, but
other sources said any overall
agreement would probably call for
after-inflation spending increases
of 3 percent a year through 1988
for the Pentagon.
That would save billions of dol
v lars from Reagan's original re
quest, which would have increased
defense spending by 5.9 percent,
8.2 percent and 8.8 percent
through 1988, while restoring
some of the reductions voted in
the GOP-controlled Senate
Budget Committee last month.
The sources spoke only on con
dition they not be identified.
