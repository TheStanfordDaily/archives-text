# Senate condemns South African policies
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Senate voted yesterday
to condemn South African racial policies and re
quest an administration report on a police shooting
incident in the Eastern Cape region that took at
least 19 lives.
The Senate acted after House Democrats unani
mously endorsed a resolution calling for increased
pressure — including economic sanctions — against
South Africa until it shows progress in dismantling
its apartheid policy of strict racial separation.
Sponsored by Sens. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.)
and Lowell Weicker (R-Conn.), the Senate's non
binding resolution was adopted 89-4.
Senators voting against the measure were Barry
Goldwater (R-Ariz.), Chic Hecht (R-Nev.), Jesse
Helms (R-N.C.), and Steven Symms (R-Idaho.)
Sen. John East (R-N.C.) voted present.
Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) called the measure
"a way of expressing our outrage" over apartheid
and the March 21 shootings in East Cape. It was
the only discussion of the measure as the Senate
pushed forward to clear away business before next

week's Easter recess.
Lugar also thanked Kennedy and Weicker, co
sponsors of pending legislation to impose tough,
anti-apartheid economic sanctions, for their as
surances that they will "think through very care
fully our policies toward South Africa." The
stronger measure will come up later in Lugar's
Foreign Relations Committee.
The Senate resolution endorsed a statement by
Secretary of State George Shultz that South
Africa's policy "is totally repugnant to the people
of the United States" and that the East Cape kil
lings "underline how evil and unacceptable apar
theid is."
It also backed remarks by Shultz that police vio
lence in South Africa is "deplorable" and that
Americans "have nothing but denunciation to say
for it."
The measured asked Shultz to submit a report on
the violence to Congress by May 15.
The Reagan administration's "constructive en

gagement" policy calls for quiet negotiations aimed
at easing South Africa's repression of blacks, but
stops short of confrontation or economic sanctions.
"As a consequence of constructive engagement,
the United States is perceived as an accomplice of
apartheid," said Rep. Howard Wolpe (D-Mich.)
after a two-hour closed caucus attended by 144
House Democrats.
The resolution adopted by the group "lays out
the growing understanding that constructive en
gagement has had some very destructive conse
quences," said Wolpe, a sponsor of legislation to
ban future U.S. investment in South Africa and end
U.S. bank loans to the Pretoria government.
The document also calls on Congress to adopt
such legislation, saying U.S. foreing policy must
make "immediate and substantial" strides toward
forcing dismantling of the apartheid system, under
which South Africa's majority blacks are denied a
voice in the government by the ruling white
minority.
