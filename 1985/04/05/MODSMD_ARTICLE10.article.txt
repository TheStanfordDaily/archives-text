# Reagan reaches budget compromise
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President
Reagan and Senate Republican
leaders, bidding to gain control over
federal deficits, agreed yesterday on a
budget compromise that would slow
the rise in Social Security benefits,
scale back the defense buildup and
cut deeply into politically popular
domestic programs.
In addition to the Social Security
change, the plan calls for eliminating
the federal subsidy for Amtrak. im
posing a freeze in Medicare payments
and making cuts in dozens of farm,
education, health and other federal
programs.
The proposal would trim an esti
mated S9 billion from Reagan's
defense buildup in 1986 and $69 bil
lion over three years, but still permit
Pentagon budget authority to rise by
3 percent a year after inflation
through 1988.
The Social Security change would
hold the cost-of-living increase to two
percentage points for each of the next
three years. Any inflationary increase
above 4 percent would be covered
with an additional increase in the
benefit.

Even so. Rep. Qaude Pepper (D-
Fla.) complained that the provision
would force •'millions of Social Secur
ity recipients" below the poverty
level. He said he was "shocked that
the president would agree ... to go
back on his commitment" made
during last year's campaign not to
support a change in benefits.
In all. the plan would trim $52 bil
lion from next year's projected deficit
of $230 billion, and $295 billion over
three years. Red ink would decline
from $175 billion in 1986 to $99 bil
lion in 1988.
White House Chief of Staff Donald
Regan called the compromise plan
"the most ambitious budget reduc
tion plan in post-war history" and
said the president "is committed to
this package and he intends to fight
for passage in both houses" of
Congress.
Outlining the various elements of
the proposal Regan said it would
eliminate 1" federal programs and
reduce 30 others, ranging from farm
price supports to highway construc
tion to Coast Guard operations.
"It's a very tough package." Sen.

Pete Domenici (R-N.M), the Senate
Budget Committee chairman, said as
the agreement was announced after
several days of private negotiations
between Senate GOP leaders and
White House aides.
"•It's tough medicine for a tough
time."
Senate Republican Leader Robert
Dole of Kansas said Reagan would
formally endorse the package later in
the day. "He's fully aboard. He's
going to be an enthusiastic player in
this." Dole said of the president.
In effect, the budget represented a
trade-off between Reagan's demand
for deep domestic spending cuts and
continued insistence by many Repub
lican senators that the president scale
back the size of his Pentagon budget.

was unexpected, since Reagan
