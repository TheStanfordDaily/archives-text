Air Force loses billions
WASHINGTON — The Air Force, while
producing joint radar-jamming equipment with
the Navy, is wasting S3 billion by also developing
its own system for some combat aircraft, congres
sional investigators said yesterday.
-Its simply a proliferation of jammers." Frank
Conahan. director of the national security and in
ternational affairs division of the General Ac
counting Office, told a House Government
Operations subcommittee.
Committee Chairman Jack Brooks (D-Texas)
said the military services "do as they please"
after getting their money and contended the
Pentagon philosophy is. "We make money the
old-fashioned way — we put it in cost overruns."
Brooks also held up an outer covering from a
current Air Force jammmer. which he said had
buckled in flight and was indicative of serious
problems with the equipment.
Conahan said the Air Force is replacing the
older version with a new model of the same jam
mer. without operational testing to make certain

the same problems won't recur.
Air Force officials responded to the accusa
tions in closed session, requesting the secrecy on
grounds that some of the information was classi
fied.
Weinberger explains
SAN FRANCISCO — An apology need not
be a precondition for a meeting between Soviet
and U.S. leaders over the slaying of a U.S. Army
intelligence officer, but the Soviets should dis
cipline those responsible for the shooting.
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said last
night.
In a news conference before his speech to the
World Affairs Council of Northern California.
Weinberger said. "All that's required is for the
Soviets to discipline their troops and not permit
this kind of murder to be repeated."
Earlier this ueek. Weinberger, in an apparent
break from the Reagan administration's plan for
dealing with the incident, said the United States
should wait for an apology before military com

manders from both sides met to discuss the inci
dent.
Weinberger had described the March 2-i
shooting of Maj. Arthur Nicholson in East Berlin
as a calculated act that amounted to an expres
sion of Soviet policy.
During a 12-minute meeting last night with the
press. Weinberger said the United States will
seek some kind of compensation for Nicholson's
family, although nothing could full) repa\ them
for their loss.
