whistJeblowers began filing in late 1983 as the
Diablo Canyon plant approached getting an
NRC operating license.
"In its initial evaluations of the first few
hundred allegations, the (NRC) staff made an ef
fort to discharge some of its ministenal duties."
the suit said. "However, in March 1984 ... it
routinely began to violate its rules and
procedures ... just as the pace of allegations
began to intensify"
As a result, it said. McDermott. O'Neill and
other whistJeblowers got no explanation in more

than 9" percent of the cases when the allegations
were found to be without merit bs the NRC after
going through a screening process.
"In many cases." the suit added, "the NRC
staff merelv forwarded affidavits and exhibits to
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. (the plant's owner)
for resjxmse and accepted the utility's uniform
denials verbatim, without an> question or expla
nation."
Thomas De\ine. an attorne> for McDermott
and O'Neill, said the NRC. instead of having its
o*n otticidte investigate the allegations, "looked
the other wax and deputised PG&E to investi
gate itself "
George Sarkisian. a spokesman for PG&E,
said the utiiitx takes everx allegation seriouslv"
but added that "almost all" of the allegations
proved to be mentless after an investigation
"We don't believe ultimatelv that thev're con
cerned with the safetx of the plant." Sarkisian
said of Devine's group. "They're more concerned
with stopping the development of nuclear power
genetically."
