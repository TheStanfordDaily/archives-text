## Stanford grad teaches gorillas sign language Features 
### SETH WATKINS 
Gorillas "can communicate their
thoughts, their wishes, their desires in
sign language," said Penny Patterson,
a psychologist who has studied the
linguistic capabilities of lowland
gorillas for more than a decade.
Koko, a female gorilla, and Mi
chael, a male, use American Sign
language (ASL) to communicate with
humans at the Gorilla Foundation, a
non-profit organization in Woodside.
ASL is a language used by many
hearing-impaired and speech
impaired people in North America.
The grammar of ASL is different
from that of standard English, but lin
guists maintain that it is possible to
express in ASL all of the concepts
and shades of meaning that can be ex
pressed in a spoken language.
Koko signed the sentence, "darn
floor bad bite" — translated as "that
darn bad foor bit me" — after an
earth tremor felt in Woodside, Pat
terson said in a recent interview.
"Darn" is one of several curse words
that Koko and Michael have invented
and sign in anger or in frustration, she
said.

Patterson, who has a doctorate in
psychology from Stanford, says that
gorillas can form ASL signs because
their hand structure is similar to that
of humans. However, "their vocal
chords and vocal tract are not the
same as ours and do not permit
speech. They can produce some
speech sounds, but with great diffi
culty."
Attempts made in the 1940s to
teach chimpanzees spoken English
were unsuccessful, but researchers in
the '60s and '70s claimed success in
teaching them ASL. Patterson was
one of the first of those researchers
and says she chose to work with goril
las because "we have a lot to learn
about communicating with other
species and the gorilla has been so
little studied."
Although gorillas cannot vocalize,
Patterson says that "they seem to
eavesdrop on what we say in En
glish." On one occasion a visitor to
Koko's apartment at the Gorilla
Foundation spoke of Koko, in En
glish, as a "juvenile." Koko, who had
been looking out the window at the
time, signed, "No, gorilla."

Koko has been learning ASL for 12
of her 13 years and has a vocabulary
of more than 500 words, which Pat
terson has described as "adequate"
for a signer.
Fluent human signers have vocabu
laries of 2,000 to 5,000 words, but by
"modulating" a sign — exaggerating,
speeding up or slowing down the ar
ticulation of a sign — a signer can
alter its meaning: One sign can be
made to mean big, great or huge.
Koko "takes full advantage" of
modulation, Patterson said. "It's al
most humorous at times to see her
sign signs that are enormously exag
gerated in order to make a point."
However, some psychologists and
linguists maintain that chimps and
gorillas trained in ASL are not using
language, but are responding to
stimuli or cues from trainers. When
Don Roberts, professor of communi
cation, was asked whether gorillas
trained in ASL are using sign lang
uage, he replied, "I don't know, but 1
doubt it."
According to Patterson, however,

Michael signs "lettuce-tree," a compound sign which refers to acacia and bamboo branches. According to
Patterson, Koko and Michael invent such signs to describe things for which they have no existing sign.

Koko, a female gorilla, has been taught sign language by Penny Patterson and has a working vocabulary of
about 500 words. Patterson says that the gorilla is using language and not merely responding to stimulus.
"gorilla eat banana" or "banana eat
gorilla."
Patterson argues that loose word
order is acceptable in ASL for tv\o
and three-word sentences that Koko
uses. In ASL, grammatical relation

"there's no question" that the gorillas
use language. "We're not just seeing
them parrot baek what we feed them.
They express their own ideas."
Patterson related an incident in which
an employee at the Gorilla Founda
tion had the flu and wore a surgical
mask while working with Michael.
"Michael made up a word for surgical
mask," an item he had never seen
before, she said. "They do this all the
time for things in their room that we
have not given them labels for. And
the signs they make up are very
similar to the ones human children
make up."
In another incident, Michael, who
is 12 years old, would not sign the
word "out" to be allowed out of his
trailer and he was crying. Patterson
signed to him, "How feel?" and Mi
chael responded, "Feel sorry out."
Skeptical linguists maintain that
gorillas do not follow a set word order
when using ASL signs. Spoken En
glish follows subject-verb-object
word order: "The gorilla eats the
banana." However, Koko might sign.

ships among words may be indicated,
in part, by modulating signs. None
theless, Koko consistently places ad
jectives after nouns.
Patterson maintains that Koko re
members past events and can talk

about them, displaying an ability
known as displacement that is
thought to be a uniquely human char
acteristic by many psychologists.
On one occasion, Koko bit her,
Patterson said. The following day.

Studies with apes 'have shown us that
yes indeed, even relatives as distant as
chimps and gorillas can comunicate.'
— Donald Johanson

when she asked Koko. "What did you
do yesterday?" Koko responded,
"Wrong, wrong."
"What wrong?" Patterson signed.
"Bite," Koko replied.

According to Donald Johanson. a
Stanford professor of anthropology
and the director of the Institute of
Human Origins in Berkeley, ASI.
studies with apes have shown that
they demonstrate displacement and
"have shown us that yes, indeed, even
relatives as distant as chimps and
gorillas can communicate."
"1 think there is enough evidence
that it's not just stimulus response."
he added.
According to Johanson, Patterson's
work with Koko and Michael "has
given us some real evidence of how
our earliest ancestors communicated
with each other" — evidence which is
lacking in fossil records.
Patterson's work with gorillas has
also generated some new ideas on
methods of teaching autistic children
to speak.
Patterson hopes that Michael and
koko will eventually mate, but Koko,
who has been raised among humans,
is attracted to male humans as well as
gorillas. Moreover, the two gorillas
have been raised together like
siblings since infancy and gorillas do
not mate with siblings.
"We've been encouraging that sort
of behavior for five years, but it's
really up to them," Patterson said.

when she asked Koko. "What did you
do yesterday?" Koko responded,
"Wrong, wrong."
"What wrong?" Patterson signed.
"Bite," Koko replied.

According to Donald Johanson. a
Stanford professor of anthropology
and the director of the Institute of
Human Origins in Berkeley, ASI.
studies with apes have shown that
they demonstrate displacement and
"have shown us that yes, indeed, even
relatives as distant as chimps and
gorillas can communicate."
"1 think there is enough evidence
that it's not just stimulus response."
he added.
According to Johanson, Patterson's
work with Koko and Michael "has
given us some real evidence of how
our earliest ancestors communicated
with each other" — evidence which is
lacking in fossil records.
Patterson's work with gorillas has
also generated some new ideas on
methods of teaching autistic children
to speak.
Patterson hopes that Michael and
koko will eventually mate, but Koko,
who has been raised among humans,
is attracted to male humans as well as
gorillas. Moreover, the two gorillas
have been raised together like
siblings since infancy and gorillas do
not mate with siblings.
"We've been encouraging that sort
of behavior for five years, but it's
really up to them," Patterson said.
Gorillas "can communicate their
thoughts, their wishes, their desires in
sign language," said Penny Patterson,
a psychologist who has studied the
linguistic capabilities of lowland
gorillas for more than a decade.
Koko, a female gorilla, and Mi
chael, a male, use American Sign
language (ASL) to communicate with
humans at the Gorilla Foundation, a
non-profit organization in Woodside.
ASL is a language used by many
hearing-impaired and speech
impaired people in North America.
The grammar of ASL is different
from that of standard English, but lin
guists maintain that it is possible to
express in ASL all of the concepts
and shades of meaning that can be ex
pressed in a spoken language.
Koko signed the sentence, "darn
floor bad bite" — translated as "that
darn bad foor bit me" — after an
earth tremor felt in Woodside, Pat
terson said in a recent interview.
"Darn" is one of several curse words
that Koko and Michael have invented
and sign in anger or in frustration, she
said.

Patterson, who has a doctorate in
psychology from Stanford, says that
gorillas can form ASL signs because
their hand structure is similar to that
of humans. However, "their vocal
chords and vocal tract are not the
same as ours and do not permit
speech. They can produce some
speech sounds, but with great diffi
culty."
Attempts made in the 1940s to
teach chimpanzees spoken English
were unsuccessful, but researchers in
the '60s and '70s claimed success in
teaching them ASL. Patterson was
one of the first of those researchers
and says she chose to work with goril
las because "we have a lot to learn
about communicating with other
species and the gorilla has been so
little studied."
Although gorillas cannot vocalize,
Patterson says that "they seem to
eavesdrop on what we say in En
glish." On one occasion a visitor to
Koko's apartment at the Gorilla
Foundation spoke of Koko, in En
glish, as a "juvenile." Koko, who had
been looking out the window at the
time, signed, "No, gorilla."

Koko has been learning ASL for 12
of her 13 years and has a vocabulary
of more than 500 words, which Pat
terson has described as "adequate"
for a signer.
Fluent human signers have vocabu
laries of 2,000 to 5,000 words, but by
"modulating" a sign — exaggerating,
speeding up or slowing down the ar
ticulation of a sign — a signer can
alter its meaning: One sign can be
made to mean big, great or huge.
Koko "takes full advantage" of
modulation, Patterson said. "It's al
most humorous at times to see her
sign signs that are enormously exag
gerated in order to make a point."
However, some psychologists and
linguists maintain that chimps and
gorillas trained in ASL are not using
language, but are responding to
stimuli or cues from trainers. When
Don Roberts, professor of communi
cation, was asked whether gorillas
trained in ASL are using sign lang
uage, he replied, "I don't know, but 1
doubt it."
According to Patterson, however,

Michael signs "lettuce-tree," a compound sign which refers to acacia and bamboo branches. According to
Patterson, Koko and Michael invent such signs to describe things for which they have no existing sign.

Koko, a female gorilla, has been taught sign language by Penny Patterson and has a working vocabulary of
about 500 words. Patterson says that the gorilla is using language and not merely responding to stimulus.
"gorilla eat banana" or "banana eat
gorilla."
Patterson argues that loose word
order is acceptable in ASL for tv\o
and three-word sentences that Koko
uses. In ASL, grammatical relation

"there's no question" that the gorillas
use language. "We're not just seeing
them parrot baek what we feed them.
They express their own ideas."
Patterson related an incident in which
an employee at the Gorilla Founda
tion had the flu and wore a surgical
mask while working with Michael.
"Michael made up a word for surgical
mask," an item he had never seen
before, she said. "They do this all the
time for things in their room that we
have not given them labels for. And
the signs they make up are very
similar to the ones human children
make up."
In another incident, Michael, who
is 12 years old, would not sign the
word "out" to be allowed out of his
trailer and he was crying. Patterson
signed to him, "How feel?" and Mi
chael responded, "Feel sorry out."

gorillas do not follow a set word order
when using ASL signs. Spoken En
