## Stanford grad teaches gorillas sign language Features 
### SETH WATKINS 
Gorillas "can communicate their
thoughts, their wishes, their desires in
sign language," said Penny Patterson,
a psychologist who has studied the
linguistic capabilities of lowland
gorillas for more than a decade.
Koko, a female gorilla, and Mi
chael, a male, use American Sign
language (ASL) to communicate with
humans at the Gorilla Foundation, a
non-profit organization in Woodside.
ASL is a language used by many
hearing-impaired and speech
impaired people in North America.
The grammar of ASL is different
from that of standard English, but lin
guists maintain that it is possible to
express in ASL all of the concepts
and shades of meaning that can be ex
pressed in a spoken language.
Koko signed the sentence, "darn
floor bad bite" — translated as "that
darn bad foor bit me" — after an
earth tremor felt in Woodside, Pat
terson said in a recent interview.
"Darn" is one of several curse words
that Koko and Michael have invented
and sign in anger or in frustration, she
said.

Patterson, who has a doctorate in
psychology from Stanford, says that
gorillas can form ASL signs because
their hand structure is similar to that
of humans. However, "their vocal
chords and vocal tract are not the
same as ours and do not permit
speech. They can produce some
speech sounds, but with great diffi
culty."
Attempts made in the 1940s to
teach chimpanzees spoken English
were unsuccessful, but researchers in
the '60s and '70s claimed success in
teaching them ASL. Patterson was
one of the first of those researchers
and says she chose to work with goril
las because "we have a lot to learn
about communicating with other
species and the gorilla has been so
little studied."
Although gorillas cannot vocalize,
Patterson says that "they seem to
eavesdrop on what we say in En
glish." On one occasion a visitor to
Koko's apartment at the Gorilla
Foundation spoke of Koko, in En
glish, as a "juvenile." Koko, who had
been looking out the window at the
time, signed, "No, gorilla."

Koko has been learning ASL for 12
of her 13 years and has a vocabulary
of more than 500 words, which Pat
terson has described as "adequate"
for a signer.
Fluent human signers have vocabu
laries of 2,000 to 5,000 words, but by
"modulating" a sign — exaggerating,
speeding up or slowing down the ar
ticulation of a sign — a signer can
alter its meaning: One sign can be
made to mean big, great or huge.
Koko "takes full advantage" of
modulation, Patterson said. "It's al
most humorous at times to see her
sign signs that are enormously exag
gerated in order to make a point."
However, some psychologists and
linguists maintain that chimps and
gorillas trained in ASL are not using
language, but are responding to
stimuli or cues from trainers. When
Don Roberts, professor of communi
cation, was asked whether gorillas
trained in ASL are using sign lang
uage, he replied, "I don't know, but 1
doubt it."
According to Patterson, however,

Michael signs "lettuce-tree," a compound sign which refers to acacia and bamboo branches. According to
Patterson, Koko and Michael invent such signs to describe things for which they have no existing sign.

Koko, a female gorilla, has been taught sign language by Penny Patterson and has a working vocabulary of
about 500 words. Patterson says that the gorilla is using language and not merely responding to stimulus.
