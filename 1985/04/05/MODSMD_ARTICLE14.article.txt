## The
						Stanford Daily The
						Playboy decision 
### 
We've seen ourselves on TV this week, ex
plaining it in 10-second bits. We've heard our
selves describing it on the radio. And we've read
ourselves defending it in local newspapers. Now,
we think, is the time to explain it fully.
"It" is The Daily's decision to run advertising
from Playboy when one of the magazine's
photographers visits Stanford later this month to
take pictures for a "Girls of the Pac-10" feature.
It is not a decision we came to without a good
deal of thought, and it is not one we take lightly.
Although Stanford Students Opposed to Por
nography (STOP) have circulated petitions ur
ging us to decide otherwise, we feel, for a number
of reasons, that we have an obligation to run
Playboy's ads.
First, we don't want to put ourselves in the po
sition of choosing our advertisers based on
whether we find them morally acceptable. The
Daily Californian, UC-Berkeley's student-run
paper, has decided not to run the Playboy ad on
the basis that Playboy is "oppressive to women."
While we agree, there are others who would
argue that certain other businesses are oppressive
to any number of groups. Planned Parenthood
supports abortion and is therefore oppressive to
unborn children, some would argue. The CIA at
tempts to overthrow the Nicaraguan government
and is therefore oppressive to the Sandinistas,

others would say. The list goes on and on, so if we
rejected all "objectionable" advertisers, we
would be out of business very quickly.
* Second, by running the advertisement we are
not making an editorial statement about Playboy.
By not running the ad, we would be making an
editorial statement, and that is something we do
only in this space each day. We, like STOP, do
feel strongly in our desire that women here not
pose for Playboy's cameras. As University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy said yesterday,
"Playboy's formula amounts to exploitation of
the Stanford name for its own economic gain, in a
way that damages all of us by associating us with
values that are not widely shared here . . . but, of
course, if no one shows up, they won't get away
with it." If any women here decide to pose, they
must realize that they are putting forth an image
of all Stanford women, an image that most here
reject. That is our editorial position, and this is
the space — the only space — in which we take
that position.
Finally, we don't believe an ad in The Daily
will trick any women here to pose for Playboy.
Stanford students are a pretty intelligent lot:
smart enough, we think, to make up their own
minds after listening to all sides of the argument.
We know what we would decide, but in the final
analysis, the decision is— and must be — theirs.
