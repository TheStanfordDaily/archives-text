Reagan artifacts
I disagree with Hardy Callcott's
Viewpoint (The Daily, April 1). He
proposed that the University retract
its offer to house the Reagan library
in response to the proposed budget
cutbacks for education. The problem
that most liberals have with the
library arises from a misconception
of what it could contain.
As Reaganites point out, this is the
United States, not the Soviet Union.
It would be ironic indeed for the
Reagan library to be a Soviet-style
monument to the glory of the leader.
Instead, it should house items which
will allow future generations to
understand what Reagan truly
thought and did about the major
problems of today.
The library should include histori
cally important documents. The first
acquisition should be Reagan's per
sonal land contracts that he signed,
stipulating that only whites be per
mitted to reside on the property,
except for servants. The next should
be the first indictment of a sitting
cabinet member.
Reagan's high school report card,
comprised of Cs and Ds, would serve
as a reminder that anyone can be
president. Prominantly displayed
should be the collection of major
international treaties negotiated and
signed by Reagan. Since there are
none, an empty glass case will do.
The library should contain a num
ber of mementos, ranging from
movie posters for "Bedtime for
Bonzo" to puddles of toxic waste
from actual sites he has refused to
have cleaned up. Nancy Reagan's
famous $ 1,000-per-place-setting
china can be arranged beside a bottle

of ketchup, the "vegetable" recom
mended by the Reagan administra
tion for consumption by poor
children cut from the school lunch
program.
The library should also house a
variety of film clips. A film clip from
the Republican convention, in which
a leader of the Ku Klux Klan stated
that Reagan's platform "could have
been written by a Klansman," would
concisely summarize Reagan's
policies concerning blacks. The
commercial for tourism in Grenada,
which immediately preceded the
televised foreign policy debate be
tween Reagan and Mondale, would
illustrate the context of Reagan's
landslide victory.
Photographs adorning the walls
should include portraits of the presi
dent and his family. A photograph of
a smiling Chicano family living in a
one-room apartment would also be
appropriate since Reagan adminis
tration has claimed that it is a cul
tural preference for Chicanos to live
in overcrowded conditions. If
Reagan is able to appoint an anti
choice Supreme Court, a portrait of
the court might be hung from a
sterilized coathanger.
The landscaping for the library
presents no problems. Since Reagan
has stated that "trees cause more
pollution than cars," there should
not be any trees. However, Reagan
has also said that "If you've seen one
tree you've seen 'em all," so maybe
one tree could decorate the library
without too much adverse effect on
the air quality.
This letter may at first be taken to
be nothing but sarcasm. However, a
little reflection should convince you
that the main points are actually

reasonable. The Reagan presidency
is a very important phenomenon and
all documents and artifacts relating
to it should be collected in one place
where they can be carefully ex
amined and thought about. We
should not turn down such an oppor
tunity.

Playboy defense
Yesterday, as I waited in the usual
half-hour line at the post office, I
was approached by a woman with a
petition protesting Playboy maga
zine's visit to the Stanford campus.
The petition, it turns out, is being
circulated by a group known as
STOP (Stanford Students Opposed
to Pornography). This group asserts
that Playboy's publication of nude
photos of women encourages vio
lence against women — and rein
forces sexual stereotypes by portray
ing women as sex objects. So sure
are they of these beliefs that they are
lobbying The Daily not to publish
Playboy's ads, threatening to boycott
any hotel that hosts the Playboy
photographers, and attempting to
have the University itself refuse to
allow its name to be published in
connection with the pictorial.
I feel that my (and Playboy's) first
amendment rights are being
threatened by this nonsense, and
would like to raise a protest against
the protesters.
First of all, it is not clear that any
of the assertions put forth by STOP
are valid. It has never been proven in
any scientific manner that there is a
correlation between pornography
and violence against women. Nor
does Playboy in any way suggest that

these women fit into, or endorse, any
particular sexual roles.
Perhaps the people who protest so
vehemently should first read the
personal information that Playboy
publishes about their models. Are
they staid housewives? Well-kept
mistresses? "Objects without
thought or feeling?" No! By and
large, these are professional women
from all walks of life, who vary in
virtually every way except that they
are possessed of exceptional physical
beauty. Stereotypes? I challenge
those who make this claim to find
any stereotype that would ade
quately embrace such a diverse
group of individuals.
The above arguments not
withstanding, there is a far more
serious issue at stake here, which
should be of concern to all of us.
Does the "moral" imperative of
STOP's cause give them the right to
harass the Playboy photographers at
work, b'ackmail local hotel owners,
make editorial decisions for The
Daily and dictate the proper use of
the University's name? I think not —
and I resent the fact that they are
trying.
For STOP to succeed would be as
much an invasion of our first
amendment rights as if "right-to
life" groups succeeded in banning
birth-control counseling at Cowell
(or, worse yet, telling them what to
say). I strongly encourage any Stan
ford woman who wants to show that
she is not to be stereotyped (or
deterred by pressure groups) to pose
for Playboy, and demonstrate to
these people just how wrong they
are.
