# The 						numbing influence of TV
## 
### 
Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C), longtime champion
of good old American values like bigotry,
militarism and tobacco subsidies, is of the opinion
that network news programs misrepresent the state
of America with a nasty liberal bias. He and the
Fairness in Media group want to take over CBS and
become Dan Rather's bosses.
Helms is not alone in his efforts to change what
viewers see on television. Recently, Congressional
hearings were held in which several dignitaries
urged that more programs be shown containing an
anti-drug-use message. Some feminists have
exerted pressure on MTV to drop music videos
depicting women in degrading situations. And of
course, various groups at various points on the poli
tical spectrum have been decrying programs
showing teen-age sex, excessive violence, negative
minority role models and non-traditional lifestyles
for years.
Television programming has managed to offend
and disgust every conceivable group in the nation
at one time or another. The problem is not a trivial
one. nor is it simply something we can dismiss as a
manifestation of what George Will calls the"more
sensitive-than-thou" mindset that sometimes dis
tracts interest groups. On some level, in some
sense, even if only with regard to just one episode
of one program, each protest group is right and jus
tified in expressing its concern. The concern rests
on two assumptions; that TV influences attitudes,
and that each of us has a stake in the attitudes of
society and thus should attempt to influence them.
Of the former assumption there can be little
doubt. One need only cite the role of TV as the
major dispenser of information, as a provider of
entertainment, a focus of social interaction and a
guide to the purchase of everything from toilet
paper to business computers. The influence of TV
has reached such towering proportions that the
Democratic Party has (belatedly) acknowledged
the need to field telegenic, TV-literate candidates,
and TV Guide can run an article titled "Sam and
Diane: Their 'Cheers' Romance May Be Sending
the Wrong Message" without shame.
Television's influence is clear; it plays with per
ceptions as no medium before it. It is Ã¼biquitous
and thus easily accessible. It reaches the mind
through what for humans is the chief collector of
evidence: the eyes. Human beings believe what
thev see, and if they see something a lot, they

believe it a lot. The awareness that something is
biased or fictional means little. The evidence of
one's eyes is strong; images stay with us even if
contravening facts don't.
The second assumption poses the more difficult
problem. The attitudes of the society in which we
live certainly have an effect on each of us; they of
ten determine what we can do, and when and how
we can do it. Thus it follows that in a free society,
one can and should attempt to influence those atti
tudes. But there are limits, and given TV's power.

controlling television programming to influence at
titudes may go far beyond those limits.
The fundamental question is: Do we want to
control people's minds or not? The issue is no less
dramatic than that, for to prevent or to force the
airing of a program in a powerful medium is to
withhold or foist upon the public whatever view
point that program represents. In a very real way. it
is to control thought.
It can be argued that controlling minds through
TV is what network programmers arc already
doing, and the objection of interest groups is that
minds are being controlled in the wrong way. But
even interest groups are likely to agree that current
programming is not quite the equivalent of Big
Brother. If TV leads us to believe that more violent
crime exists than truly does, that blondes are dumb,
and that blacks spend most of their time cracking
jokes, it is in great part because there are elements
in each of those scenarios that appeal to a lot of
people. What we see on TV often reflects our most
deeply seated prejudices and presumptions. It also
panders endlessly to the terrible trio: money, sex
and power. Add violence and death, and you've
covered the basis of nearly every program from
"Three's Company" to "Hill Street Blues." Unlike
the fine arts. TV doesn't provide insight into fears

and desires; it simply repackages them, thus per
petuating and legitimizing them. That's the power
of TV.
Singly, the reforms advocated by those wishing
to change TV programs wouldn't alter this state of
affairs. In the aggregate, however, theirs is a very
dangerous approach to influencing hearts and
minds. The argument is that TV can be used to al
lay fears and correct misperceptions. This goal is a
worthy one, but the implications are disturbing.
1 happen to think Helms has all the makings of a
good Nazi and wouldn't want him having a say
about the 6 a.m. farm report, much less the 6 p.m.
news, but the real problem lies not in his message,
but in the way TV would allow it to be presented.
The current method of seeking to influence minds
through television is to repeatedly bombard the
viewer with the image and/or message. There is no
exchange of ideas; there is no debate. It's persua
sion without persuading, convincing through os
mosis.
Presidential "debates" are a prime example. In a
tepid echo of any real argument, the candidates aim
long versions of their campaign commercials at
each other, hoping that viewers will finally have
heard the message enough times to conclude it
must be true. With few exceptions, TV programs
and TV messages ask Americans not to think about
anything, but simply to watch and choose the most
appealing picture. Apart from the clear injustice of
this insidious kind of persuasion, it should be ap
parent that no one is served by a populace condi
tioned to be mindless in this way.
Interest groups protesting TV programming have
strong arguments, but the course upon which they
are embarking is ominous. Attempting to shape
television programs to change attitudes is the kind
of solution to societal problems that ought to be
pursued with caution. Devoting more energy to
creating an environment where people are critical
interpreters of what they see rather than passive
receivers would certainly blunt the effect of TV on
attitudes. Long-term planning, however, is not in
vogue, and it's likely that influence-by-TV at
tempts will increase. Unfortunately, though televi
sion is not new, it might very well be placed on the
ever-growing list of technology which society has
not yet come to proper terms with.
