## Thoughts on the approach of death 
### 
What do we think of, when ap
proaching near to death.
To death, on any view, there is a
great finality, and therefore a sum
ming up. Some tell us that before the
mind of one suddenly facing death
passes his entire life in an instant.
Perhaps something like this
sometimes does happen, but be that
as it may, the very persistence of this
notion testifies to our sense of death
as a summing up.

VIEWPOINT

To see one's life and work summed
up, one's part in life's drama drawn to
a close, also gives a kind of perspec
tive: perspective on what is trivial and
what important, what one regrets and
what was worthwhile.
One may regret the way one has
spent that inconvertible and most
precious currency, time, as the lure of
the petty drops away; regret things
done wrong that at the time seemed
small. One may be glad for small
kindnesses given and received.
Sometimes people rush into burn
ing buildings at the last moment to
try, successfully or unsuccessfully, to
save others. We do not quite know
why. A few years ago, a young man
lept into the path of an oncoming
BART train to rescue a young child
he didn't know. Astonishingly, he too
escaped; and when interviewed was
as surprised as anyone at his sudden
heroism, which he could not explain.
And, faced with death, we wonder.
One wonders about what life is,
about one's place in the cosmos, or
about God; not so much because
death may bring these things closer as
because, even if one disbelieved still
and utterly in a supernatural realm,
the things which the prospect of death
brings to mind — the summation of
life, perspective on it, love reconcilia
tion, doing good, sorrow, wondering
— are, like death itself, inherently re
ligious topics: topics that place my
own life in relation to the whole of

life, and raise the question of its
meaning.
People who have brushed close
with death often are changed —
usually chastened, yet better and hap
pier people for having had to con
front these questions. This may prove
true not only of those who have had
so-called near-death experiences, but
also of those surviving train wrecks or
reprieved, like Arthur Koestler, from
the condemned cell.
But certainly, death is frightening
and sad. The old story has it that
when Jesus approached the tomb of
Lazarus he wept, even though he
knew that he himself would soon
raise Lazarus from the dead. Because
death is all it is, we easily avoid think
ing of it; and when confronted with
the death of a loved one we may
easily despair, turn away, became bit
ter, or refuse to think. We may
become frantic, or inured.
In quite the same way it is hard, but
salutary, to reflect constructively on
the prospect of war — especially nu
clear war — or upon any of the
apocalyptic scourges that we are in
creasingly able to fashion with our
growing scientific acumen and tech
nological power: germ warfare, envi
ronmental destruction, genetic
manipulation, casual abortion, and so
on. Perhaps it is a good thing that of
these, nuclear war, which so clearly
focuses our minds on the powers of
destruction we hold, comes to us near
the start with its most evident chal
lenges.
How do we respond to the prospect
of a world where humans have more
and more the power to shape their
fate, to wrest from nature keys that
unlock all bounds and barriers to our
action? How do we respond to an
atomic world where we can hurl from
the skies a destruction as massive as
the falling moon?

proaching near to death.
