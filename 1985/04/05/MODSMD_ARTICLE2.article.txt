## Profs to air views on Hoover ties 
### SHIRISH DATE Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate committee
charged with determining the effects
of a closer relationship between the
University and the Hoover Institution
has scheduled an open hearing for
April 25.
Sociology Prof. Sanford
Dornbusch, chairman of the Faculty
Senate Committee on the Relation
between the Hoover Institution and
the Professoriate at Stanford, the

purpose of the forum is to allow all
faculty members an opportunity to
express their views on the Hoover
question.
"The Faculty Senate asked us to
find lots of different ways of gather
ing information," he said. "This is
one of the public ways of doing
things."
In addition to the April 25 hearing,
the committee is planning various
methods of collecting data, including
meetings with affected departments,
individual faculty members known to
have specific background on the sub
ject and individuals who specifically
request interviews.
The committee is also preparing a
letter for circulation among faculty
members that asks for accounts
detailing:
• experiences with joint or courtesy
appoinments in relation to the
Hoover Institution;
• "current or potential benefits of
relationships with the Hoover Institu
tion to your department or school or
to the University as a whole";
• "current or potential costs of
relationships with the Hoover Institu
tion to your department or school or
to the University as a whole."
The letter also solicits "faculty
recommendations concerning rela
tions between the Hoover Institution
and the rest of the University."
Thus far, meetings have been

scheduled with the Political Science,
History, Economics and Sociology
Departments, Dornbusch said.
Meetings with other departments will
also be planned if requested, he
added.
The committee was formed late last
quarter and includes, in addition to
Dornbusch, Profs. W. Bliss Carnoc
han, English; Lee Cronbach, educa
tion (emeritus); Walter Falcon, Food
Research Institute; David Kennedy,
history; Eleanor Maccoby, psychol
ogy; and James Sweeney,
engineering-economic systems.
Provost James Rosse is an ex-officio
member.
The Faculty Senate voted unani
mously to create the committee at its
Feb. 21 meeting and asked that it
report back to the senate by May 16,
a deadline later pushed back to May
30.
Senate debate on Hoover and the
subsequent creation of a committee
was sparked by a report written by a
six-person committee appointed by
the Board of Trustees to examine
ways to improve working relations
between Hoover and University de
partments. This committee, chaired
by Political Science Prof. Robert
Ward, reported last fall that more
joint appointments between Hoover
and Stanford could create a social
sciences program here rivaling Har
vard's John F. Kennedy School of
Government.
The Ward report criticized mem
bers of the Political Science Depart
ment for behaving unprofessionally
by blocking joint appointments.
Faculty members responded by
calling the report "one-sided,"
"misleading" and "factually wrong."
Critics also pointed out that four of
the six committee members had
Hoover connections.
Political Science Prof. John Man
ley, outspoken critic of the Ward
report and a leader in efforts to ex
amine Hoover-Stanford ties for the
assessment of the Faculty Senate
committee.
"If this committee allows an open
discussion of and,a serious look into
the question of the Hoover relation
ship . . . then it will serve a terribly
useful purpose within the Stanford
community," he said.
But "if the committee refuses to
look into the political activities at
Hoover. . . then the [Faculty Sgnate]
committee will serve no useful func
tion," he added.
Ward said he believes the Faculty
Senate committee will do an
"outstanding" job of outlining costs
and benefits of closer ties to Hoover.
"It's a first-rate committee," he said.
