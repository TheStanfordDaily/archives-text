## Ballard stymies Cal on four-hitter, 7-1 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
BLRKELEY — There's an old sports
saying that great players have great days in
big games. Yesterday at Evans Diamond, the
old saying came true as Jeff Ballard and Mark
Davis led Stanford to a convincing 7-1 win
over California.
I he victory gave the Cardinal a two-game
lead over the Bears in the Pacific 10 Southern
Division. Stanford is now 1 1-2 in the Six-Pac.
Cal, which had a six-game conference winning
streak snapped, is 9-4.
Ballard, 8-1, pitched his fifth consecutive
complete game, lie gave up only four hits and
tied his season high for strikeouts with eight.
"I felt good today," he said. "Sometimes
when you feel good, you think you're just
gonna go and shut them down, and you end
up throwing instead of pitching."
Ballard didn't throw — he pitched. He had
the Bears constantly off balance with an as
sortment of fastballs, sliders, curveballs and
changeups. Cal's left-handed hitters were lun
ging at low, breaking balls nil day.
"He's just a veteran. He's got four good
pitches, and he can locate them," Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess said of the senior left
hander, who is Stanford's all-time winningest
pitcher. "He doesn't give you much."
"I le's our guy," Marquess continued. "And
you can see why today."
Ballard got all the runs he would need in
the first inning. Before the large crowd had
settled into its seats, Pete Stanicek walked
and raced home on a double to right-center

by Ruben Amaro. Davis singled Amaro to
third and then allowed him to score by break
ing up a double-play on Mike Deßenon's
ground ball.
After Cal scored its only run on an RBI
groundout by Tim Jester in the first, Stanlord
regained its two-run lead in the second tin a
fielder's choice by Stanicek that scored Toi
Cook, who had doubled.
The onslaught against Bear starter Mark
Sampson continued in the third. Davis walked
and moved to second on a single by Rick
Lundblade. After Deßenon walked to load
the bases, Walt Harris blooped an RBI single
to center. John Ramos' fielder's choice made
the score 5 -1.
Thanks to Davis, Sampson didn't survive
the top of the fourth. Stanicek started the in
ning with a double against the fence in left
center and a quick steal of third. Sampson
managed to strike out Amaro, but his first
pitch to Davis was a little careless.
"It was a eurveball," Davis said. "He hung
it up high."
Davis hung it up a lot higher, driving a long
home run to left-center — his eighth round
tripper of the year— and making the score 7-
1.
Most hitters look for a fastball on the first
pitch and won't swing at a curve. Will Davis?
"Not usually," he said. "But when they
hang it about letter-high, and it's yelling, "Hit
me! Hit me!' I'll hit it."
Davis' 3-for-4 day raised his Six-Pac bat
ting average to .509. After the game,
Marquess was asked if the junior center

fielder should be considered for post-season
honors. "He's one of the best outfielders in
our league," he said. "He'd better be an All-
America candidate.''
Dave Masters replaced Sampson and was
greeted by Lundblade's 395-foot double to
straightaway center. However, the 6-9 right
hander settled down and blanked the Card
inal the rest of the way.
But Ballard had all he needed. The only
man to reach base from the fourth until the
eighth only got there because of an error.
"When he gets the lead, he's real tough,"
Marquess said.
Ballard cruised into the ninth inning hav ing
retired 16 of the previous 18 batters, but he
had some trouble putting the Bears away. "1
got out of rhythm," he said. "I pushed myself
a little bit."
After Jester and Mike Knapp walked to
start the inning, Jeff Weiss lined an 0-2 pitch
to left to load the bases with no outs. Still,
Marquess decided to stay with Ballard.
"He was handling those guys (coming up),"
Marquess said.
And he got them out again. First, he snuck
a 3-2 slider past Nick Lewis, who didn't swing
at any of the six pitches. Then Jerry Goff hit a
bouncer to Stanicek, who tagged Weiss and
threw to Lundblade for a game-ending
double-play.
Today, the two teams play a 2:30 p.m.
game at Sunken Diamond, where the Bears
have not won in four years. Stanford's Rob
Wassenaar (4-1, 4.64 ERA) will oppose Will
Schock (6-0, 4.87).
