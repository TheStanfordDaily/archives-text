# Golfers take sixth in tourney
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff sportswriter 
Following a disastrous first round
Tuesday which dropped the Cardinal
well out of sight of the leaders, the
Stanford men's golf team could have
given up and walked through the last
two rounds. Instead, the Cardinal
rallied to defeat several key District 8
counterparts and finish sixth at the
Western Intercollegiate at the
Pasatiempo Golf Club in Santa Cruz.
The Cardinal's opening-round total
of 392 placed it in 14th place, a dis
tant 22 shots behind the leader. Stan
ford improved each round, however,
shooting 380 Wednesday and a
tournament-best 363 yesterday to
finish at 1 135, only seven shots be
hind third-place Brigham Young.
Tournament-champion San Jose
State (I I 10) and runner-up UCLA
(111!) made mincemeat of the rest of
the field, turning the tournament into
a two-team chase. The Spartans led
throughout the three-day tourna
ment. stubbornly staving off the
Bruins, who had to rally from a
mediocre first round 379.
Stanford Coach Tim Schaaf viewed
the Cardinal's comeback in the last
two rounds as a sign that the golfers
are coming out of a slump which they
had suffered through in the past two
tournaments. " I'he whole group had
a good clay and feels good about it
(the final round)," Schaaf said. The
Cardinal golfers were "back in the
groove mentally" in the first round
•but just did not play well," Schaaf
said.
Schaaf said that by defeating teams
such as USC. Arizona, the University
ol the Pacific. New Mexico State and
Oregon, the Cardinal greatly im
proved its position in regard to a
berth in the upcoming NCAA Cham
pionships. "We wound up beating the
teams we had to beat, Schaat said.

District 8 will probably be
represented in the national cham
pionships by six teams, with 10 teams
currently vying for these spots, ac
cording to Schaaf. But to feel secure
about making the national champion
ships, Stanford "definitely wants to
be one of the top four teams" in the
district at the end of the season,
Schaafsaid.
The Cardinal, which had been
ranked as highly as No. 2 on the West
Coast during the middle of March,
struggled through the last two tourna
ments and found itself in a fight for an
NCAA berth. But Stanford's finish at
the Western Intercollegiate helped
them eliminate Pacific, Oregon and
New Mexico State from any chance of
bumping the Cardinal from an
NCAA berth, according to Schaaf.
In addition, the Cardinal is now
two victories up on both Arizona and
USC in head-to-head competition,
with two tournaments remaining.
Stanford can close these two teams
out of NCAA tournament contention
the next time they meet.
In individual competition at the
Western Intercollegiate, UCLA's
Duffy Waldorf captured individual
honors with a 217 three-round total.
Waldorf's teammate, Mark
Levander, tied San Jose's Sean Kelly
and Arizona State's Billy Mayfair lor
second place. The threesome finished
at 219.
Stanford scores included lim Rob
inson at 223, Don Walsworth at 228.
John Dickey at 230, Scott Erickson at
231, Doug Thompson at 231 and
Carl Wagner at 235.
The Cardinal next plays April 13-
14 when it hosts the Stanford U.S. In
tercollegiate at the Stanford (Jolt
Course. The tournament should be a
good one, according to Schaaf. with
the season "getting down to the wire
and quite a few teams competing for
spots" in the NCAA Championships.
