# Natters' No. 1 ranking on line
## 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's tennis team
faces its toughest Pacific 10 Con
ference competition of the season
today and tomorrow against No.
2-ranked USC and No. 4-ranked
UCLA. The Cardinal will take on
the Trojans today at noon and
UCLA tomorrow afternoon and
evening.
The indoor matches, to be
played tomorrow at 6:30 p.m. in
Maples Pavilion, feature No. 1,
No. 2 singles and No. 1 doubles.
The matches will mark the first
time Stanford has played UCLA
since its 5-4 loss in the NCAA
Championship final match last
year.
Stanford has played USC once
this season, in the Intercollegiate
Tennis Coaches Association I cam
Championship final match. I he
Cardinal won 6-3, taking five of
six singles matches. The title gave
Stanford the No. I ranking, previ
ously UCLA's, in the ITCA poll
following the match.
Since the team championship,
Stanford has held on to its top
ranking, but USC and UCLA are
more than capable of knocking the
Cardinal out of the No. 1 spot.
The Trojans have three 19N4
All-Americans ranked in the top
20 this season: Todd Witsken (4),
Rick Leach (11) and Jorge Lozano
(17). USC has two other returning
19X4 All-Americans, including
Antonv Emerson and Tim Pawsat.
However, the Trojans come into
today's match still smarting from a
5-4 loss to UCLA last week. Stan
ford Coach Dick Gould said

LJSCs loss to UCI / is evidence
that tomorrow's match with the
Bruins will be the No. I against
No. 2 event, regardless of the
ITCA rankings which ranks DSC
second nationally.
The Bruins are led by Michael
kures and Jeff Klaparda, ranked
No. 9 and No. 13. respectively.
Kures was named Pac-1 0 Player ot
the Year in 19X4 after he won the
Pac-10 Southern Division singles
title with straight-set wins against
USC's Witskcn. and Stanford's
Dan Goldie.
UCLA's Klaparda — a senior
from Los Angeles — has com
peted with Kures for the No. 1
singles spot this season. He is a
two-time All-America, and has
worked on following his singles
matches with an all-out doubles
effort.
In the No. 1 doubles match, di
rectly following the two indoor
singles matches, Stanford will
probably put Goldie and Jim
Grabb against either Ken Diller
and Brad Pearce, 10-0 overall, or
Kures and Mark Basham, 9-4
overall.
Kures and Basham defeated the
Cardinal's former No. 1 doubles
team of Grabb and John Letts to
give the Bruins the national title in
the NCAA Championship tourna
ment last year. Grabb and Letts
have been experimentally broken
up bv Gould, however. Letts is
now playing No. 3 doubles with
sophomore Scott Moody.
Thus far, Stanford has not had
to worry much about similes com
