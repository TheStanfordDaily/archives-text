# Natters' No. 1 ranking on line
## 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's tennis team
faces its toughest Pacific 10 Con
ference competition of the season
today and tomorrow against No.
2-ranked USC and No. 4-ranked
UCLA. The Cardinal will take on
the Trojans today at noon and
UCLA tomorrow afternoon and
evening.
The indoor matches, to be
played tomorrow at 6:30 p.m. in
Maples Pavilion, feature No. 1,
No. 2 singles and No. 1 doubles.
The matches will mark the first
time Stanford has played UCLA
since its 5-4 loss in the NCAA
Championship final match last
year.
Stanford has played USC once
this season, in the Intercollegiate
Tennis Coaches Association I cam
Championship final match. I he
Cardinal won 6-3, taking five of
six singles matches. The title gave
Stanford the No. I ranking, previ
ously UCLA's, in the ITCA poll
following the match.
Since the team championship,
Stanford has held on to its top
ranking, but USC and UCLA are
more than capable of knocking the
Cardinal out of the No. 1 spot.
The Trojans have three 19N4
All-Americans ranked in the top
20 this season: Todd Witsken (4),
Rick Leach (11) and Jorge Lozano
(17). USC has two other returning
19X4 All-Americans, including
Antonv Emerson and Tim Pawsat.
However, the Trojans come into
today's match still smarting from a
5-4 loss to UCLA last week. Stan
ford Coach Dick Gould said

LJSCs loss to UCI / is evidence
that tomorrow's match with the
Bruins will be the No. I against
No. 2 event, regardless of the
ITCA rankings which ranks DSC
second nationally.
The Bruins are led by Michael
kures and Jeff Klaparda, ranked
No. 9 and No. 13. respectively.
Kures was named Pac-1 0 Player ot
the Year in 19X4 after he won the
Pac-10 Southern Division singles
title with straight-set wins against
USC's Witskcn. and Stanford's
Dan Goldie.
UCLA's Klaparda — a senior
from Los Angeles — has com
peted with Kures for the No. 1
singles spot this season. He is a
two-time All-America, and has
worked on following his singles
matches with an all-out doubles
effort.
In the No. 1 doubles match, di
rectly following the two indoor
singles matches, Stanford will
probably put Goldie and Jim
Grabb against either Ken Diller
and Brad Pearce, 10-0 overall, or
Kures and Mark Basham, 9-4
overall.
Kures and Basham defeated the
Cardinal's former No. 1 doubles
team of Grabb and John Letts to
give the Bruins the national title in
the NCAA Championship tourna
ment last year. Grabb and Letts
have been experimentally broken
up bv Gould, however. Letts is
now playing No. 3 doubles with
sophomore Scott Moody.
Thus far, Stanford has not had
to worry much about similes com
petition. But recently, both John
Letts and Dan Goldie have had diffi
culty in the No. 1 and No. 4 spots.
Within one week, Goldie has lost two
straight, to unranked Benji Papal of
Arizona and Steve DeVries of Cal.
Gould said the possible loss of
Goldie's No. 1 ranking is unimpor
tant in light of the caliber of this
weekend's competition, and he is op
timistic about Goldie's ability to
rebound either this weekend or in
time for the NCAA team and individ
ual championships.

For the time being, Stanford's
players and coach refuse to speculate
as to whether Goldie has lost confi
dence at his No. 1 spot.
"Nothing especially is going wrong,
but my timing is off and I'm a little bit
slow," Goldie said. "My back is a
little bit sore."
Goldie has been plagued with "off
and on" back pain all season. He
defaulted his doubles match in the
team championship earlier this
season in order to play pain-free in
the singles competition of that tourn
ament.
Goldie has played and beaten
USCs Witsken once this season, 6-2,
6-4. But the junior admits he is "a bit
nervous" about the prospect of
meeting Witsken again outdoors, and
UCLA's Kures in No. 1 indoor
singles.
The indoor matches were set up by
Gould in 1973 to solve problems with
the limited bleacher space surround
ing the Varsity Tennis Courts.
"There used to be a line all the way
to Maples Pavilion an hour before the
match just to get tickets. There used
to be people in the trees and the
hedges and people laying on their
stomachs looking under the fence
trying to get a glimpse of the match,"
Gould said.
Gould bought a carpet to cover the
basketball floor, and drew 14,000
spectators to the first outdoor/indoor
event. Stanford has played UCLA in
doors nine times, winning six of those
matches. Since 1972, the win/loss
record between Stanford and UCLA
is 18-17.
"I think, in general, the players like
to play indoors. It plays very much
like outdoors," Gould said.
