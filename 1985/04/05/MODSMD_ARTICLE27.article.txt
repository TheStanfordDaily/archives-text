## Will the shot clock rule destroy the college game? 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
The 12 members of the NCAA
Basketball Rules Committee prob
ably didn't send smoke under the
door Tuesday after they voted to
implement a 45-second shot clock in
all games next season, including the
NCAA post-season tournament.
But the decision has left many
coaches around the country fuming.
NCAA, they say, you just spoiled our
game.

Analysis

There are many reasons for their
opposition, but they all seem to boil
down to this: College basketball is
slowly and surely moving frighten
ingly closer to the professional game.
And that, they say, is a mistake.
The NBA, with its 24-second
clock, with its three-point line and
without its zone defense, is trash to
the college basketball fan. The season
is too long. There is too much scoring.
The playoffs are in a best-of-seven
format, so post-season upsets are
about as scarce as good defense. In a
word, the NBA is boring. Boring with
about 10 o's.
The college game is different. You
can play any type of defense you want
— zones are OK. You only get two
points for a basket, no matter if it's a
lay-up or a 35-footer. And you can
take as long as you want to shoot or
not shoot the ball.
Until Tuesday. Now you have to
shoot the ball within 45 seconds after
you get it. You don't and you lose it.
Having a 45-second clock and
keeping it on for the entire game does
two things to the college game. First,
it prevents so-called stall ball, where
a team of lesser talent and athletic
skill can stay close to a more talented
one by simply holding the ball.
But it's the shot clock's second ef
fect that has many coaches up in
arms. Not turning the clock off in the
final four or five minutes effectively
prevents the end of a game from be

coming a free-throw shooting contest
when the losing team intentionally
fouls to stop the clock.
It also may make the upset an en
dangered species.
"The rich are going to get richer
and the poor are going to get
poorer," said Oregon State Coach
Ralph Miller, a long-time opponent
of the clock who also happens to be
the winningest active Division I
coach. "You will not see a team like
North Carolina State or a Villanova
go through and win a national cham
pionship with a clock, and that's too
bad."

Even advocates of the clock agree
upsets probably will be less prevalent
now. "It elminates the farce, the
travesty game," said Edward Steitz,
the secretary-editor of the Rules
Committee. "It does tend to prevent
the upset, too."
And that's a problem. Upsets are
the meat and potatoes of the college
game. Stanford was 3-15 in the
Pacific 10 Conference this year, but
the sour conference season was
mitigated by two victories over co
champion use.

Stanford Assoc. Coach Bruce Pearl — seated to the left of Coach Tom
Davis — says he is in favor of the shot clock, but not in the final five
minutes.
"l think Villanova beating George
town or North Carolina State beating
Houston (in 1983), the little guy
beating the big guy, is what college
basketball's all about," said Stanford
Assoc. Coach Bruce Pearl, who is in
favor of the clock, but not in the final
five minutes.
Therein lies a glaring contradiction.
The very day after Villanova, a huge
underdog, beat Georgetown in what
many are calling the greatest game in
NCAA tournament history, the
NCAA Rules Committee voted in fa

vor of a shot clock and for all practi
cal purposes guaranteed that a Vil
lanova won't do it again.
The contradictions don't stop
there.
By taking the slow-down out of the
game, the NCAA also took out a
large chunk of coaching. The days of
lesser talented teams winning games
by holding the ball are over. As Stan
ford Asst. Coach and former NBA
player Kermit Washington says,
"Games will be won by the athletes
now."
Putting more emphasis on talent
and less on coaching also puts more
emphasis on recruiting. And, as we all
know, too much emphasis on recruit

ing often means probation. So why
would the NCAA, policemen of
recruiting practices, adopt a rule
which probably will increase recruit
ing violations?
"I think what they're reacting to is
the free-throw contest at the end of
the game," Pearl said. "But I think
there are other ways to combat that.
You can give referees more freedom
to call intentional fouls."
The NCAA also might have been
reacting to its fans. Fans object to
slow-down games. They say it's not
basketball. And since fans fill seats,
which fills pocketbooks, the NCAA
listens when fans talk. It hears all
those boos when a team goes into

four corners or some other delay
game.
The NCAA, however, seems to be
all ears and no eyes. It can't see the
college game is imitating its big
brother.
"If the games are the same, people
will have to make a choice," Pearl
said. "If people have a choice be
tween college and pro basketball,
they'll choose the pro game. The guys
in college can play, but those guys in
the pros can really do it."
And what does James Naismith,
who invented basketball nearly a cen
tury ago, have to say about all this?
Nothing. He just turned over in his
grave.
