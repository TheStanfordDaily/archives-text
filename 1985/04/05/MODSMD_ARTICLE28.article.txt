# Point-shaving, cocaine and bribery cited
## Tulane drops hoops 
### 
NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Tulane University,
rocked by a point-shaving scandal and the discovery of
NCAA violations, said yesterday it planned to drop
men's basketball.
And an Orleans Parish grand jury indicted three
players, including John "Hot Rod" Williams, and five
others on a total of 20 counts of sports bribery and
conspiracy in the gambling case.
In addition, a second nine-count indictment named
Gary Kranz, a student, with selling cocaine to members
of the team.
Teammates named with Williams were David
Dominique, accused of sports bribery, and Bobby
Thompson, accused of conspiracy in sports bribery.
District Attorney Harry Connick said the investiga
tion is not over and involves others. He did not elabo
rate but said the case would be given to a judge Mon
day.
Basketball Coach Ned Fowler, who hasn't been im
plicated in the alleged point-shaving scheme, resigned
yesterday along with two assistants. Tulane President
Eamon Kelly said Fowler admitted making cash pay
ments to several players — a violation of NCAA rules.
The Times-Picayune quoted sources as saying that
Williams told prosecutors he secretly got $100 a week
from Fowler during the season.
The newspaper also quoted sources as saying Wil
liams told prosecutors he received a $10,000 payment

in a shoebox when he was a high school senior to at
tend Tulane.
Those indicted were the same eight people who had
been arrested earlier in the case. They were:
• Williams, 23, of Sorrento, La., a 6-10 senior center
who was Metro Conference Player of the Year in
1983-84 and all-conference in 1984-85.
• Thompson, 21, of New Orleans, a 6-foot senior
guard.
• Dominique, 19, of New Iberia, La., a 6-7 sophomore
swingman.
• Kranz, 21, of New Rochelle, N.Y.
• David Rothenberg, 22, of Wilton, Conn., once a
member of Kranz' fraternity.
• Mark Olensky, 21, of Fair Lawn, N.J., also once a
member of Kranz' fraternity.
• Craig Bourgeois, 23, New Orleans, not a student.
• Roland Ruiz, 48, of New Orleans, who has a record
of two convictions for operating as a bookie.
Kelly, speaking at a news conference, said he
thought it was critical the 150-year-old private univer
sity take a clear and decisive stand, even though bas
ketball teams have been fielded since 1912.
"The only way I know to demonstrate unam
biguously this academic community's intolerance of
the violations and actions we have uncovered is to dis
continue the program in which they originated," he
said.
