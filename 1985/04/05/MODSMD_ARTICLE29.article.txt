# Softball team loses twice
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER Senior sportswriter 
The Stanford softball team's three
day, six-game road trip got off to a
rocky start yesterday as the Cardinal
lost a nonconference double-header,
1-0 and 11-0, to Cal Poly-Pomona.
In the opener, Betsy Watson, 3-13,
pitched a perfect game — with one
exception. She gave up a first-inning
home run to Candi Burke. Stanford
couldn't support Watson at the plate,
however, with only two hits. K.K.
Bush had a third-inning single, and
Maria De La Rosa singled in the
fourth inning.
In the second game, Pomona got
off to a good start — but this one was

better than in the first game. Loser
Lisa Buchanan, 4-13, gave up four
first-inning runs, including Burke's
second solo homer of the day. It
didn't stop there: The next batter.
Donna McElrae, hit a home run. All
told, Pomona scored four in the first
— all with two out.
Pomona tapped Buchanan for
three more runs in the second, all
with one stroke of the bat. Burke hit
her third home run, a three-run shot
with one out. Buchanan lasted five
and-one-third innings before yielding
to Monique Bautista, who pitched for
the first time this season and finished
the game.
Stanford's offense, meanwhile, had

four hits in the second game. Lisa and
Laura Buchanan singled con
secutively in the sixth inning, and
Kathy Dominguez and Monique
Bautista singled in the fifth.
Pomona scored three runs in the
fifth, its rally spurred by four con
secutive hits — two singles, a double
and another single.
The Cardinal, 0-4 in the Western
Collegiate Athletic Association, will
play a conference double-header
against Arizona State at Tempe,
Ariz., tonight. Stanford will then
complete its road swing, traveling
south to Tucson, Ariz., for two games
against Arizona Saturday.
