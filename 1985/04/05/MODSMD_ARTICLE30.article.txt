## First qualification in team's history Gymnasts make NCAAs 
### 
The Stanford men's gymnastics program
has been around a long time â€” 47 years to be
exact. In that span of time, the team has never
competed in the NCAA tournament.
The drought has ended.
Cardinal Coach Sadao Hamada received
news Wednesday from the NCAA that his
team has been selected to compete in the 10-
team national event April 12-13 at the Uni
versity of Nebraska. "I can't tell you how
happy I am for the team," Hamada said.
"When we started the season, we only had
six members," he said. "Throughout the
season, we kept improving. I would tell the
team about how we were moving up in the
rankings, and that kept their enthusiasm at a
high level. Their hard work paid off."
The other nine schools selected were top
seeded Penn State, Ohio State, Nebraska,
Arizona State, Southern Illinois, lowa, Okla

homa, Fullerton State, and defending cham
pion, UCLA. Stanford was selected partly be
cause its average score for the season was
279.77, seventh-best in the nation.
Another key to Stanford's selection was
certainly its strong performance at the recent
Pacific 10 Invitational at Berkeley. In its best
finish ever, Stanford racked up 280.85 points
to finish third behind UCLA and Arizona
State. The Cardinal beat national powers
Fullerton State and New Mexico in the meet.
During the season, Stanford broke nearly
every one of its individual and team records.
Near the end of the regular season, the Card
inal broke the team scoring record with
283.30 points.
The team has been led by veterans Jon
Levy and Randy Besosa. Levy set the school
record with a 57.85 mark this year. Close be
hind was Besosa at 57.35.

"Jon and Randy have both had excelllent
seasons," Hamada said. "They have been the
backbone of our squad."
Other team members are Gary Smith
(55.85), Mike Matzek (55.85), Mark Arnold
(55.85) and Chuck Gerardo (55.25). "Gary
Smith has made great strides this year,"
Hamada said "Matzek has been a surprise.
He is a tough competitor and an extremely
hard worker."
"Mark Arnold was bothered by a knee in
jury this year, but he is in good shape now,"
he continued. "Chuck Gerardo has per
formed to his potential. He started slow, but
has worked hard to become an excellent gym
nast."
Hamada was recently named Pac-10 Gym
nastics Coach of the Year. It is the second
time in the past three seasons he has gained
that distinction.
