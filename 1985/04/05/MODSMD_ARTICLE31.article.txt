## Lack of Fortune could hurt spikers Card hosts lowly SDSU 
### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's volleyball team, fifth in its league
with a 8-7 mark, hosts San Diego State tonight in Maples
Pavilion. The match will begin at 7:30.
The Cardinal hopes to regroup after Wednesday night's
five-set loss to visiting USC and enhance its playoff
prospects. Could the men experience a letdown against
the seventh-place Aztecs?
Not according to Cardinal Co-coach Don Shaw. "The
guys know what it will take to make the playoffs," Shaw
said. "I'll know for sure if they're ready after tonight's
(Thursday's) practice. I'll think we'll come out ready."
Stanford might be without the services of freshman
Scott Fortune, who played four sets against USC with a
very painful knee before coming out. Even if Fortune is
unable to make the starting lineup, Stanford can always
use sophomore Stephen Blue, who demonstrated in
Fortune's absence that he is a more than capable substi
tute.
Stanford's Shaw is uncertain what to expect from
SDSU. "Because we haven't seen them in so long, we
don't really know what's in store," Shaw said.
The teams last met in late January when the Cardinal
squeaked out a five-set thriller, rallying from a 12-7 defi

cit in the final game. "We struggled to get out of there
with a win," Shaw said.
Shaw did know that the Aztecs feature two outstanding
athletes, setter John Eddo and senior middle blocker Eric
Barton. "They're their top two players and they rely on
them a lot, Shaw said. "None of the other guys (on the
team) appear to be in that category.
"But if either of those two get hot, they can carry a
team."
Stanford, of late, has done a good job in shutting down
the opponent's key hitters. With the league's tallest
lineup, the Cardinal presents an offense with a formidable
defensive wall. Just ask USC's Bill Yardley, a first-team
All-America. Wednesday night, Yardley saw a number of
his powerful hits "roofed" for Cardinal winners.
It Stanford can get by the Aztecs, the future should be
rosy. "If we can v'.j this one," Shaw said, "we'll be in
pretty good shapv\ ... If we can weather this stretch of
games," the worst will be over. The Cardinal has played
seven games in the last 14 days.
Assuming Stanford can limp through its last three
games and remain in fifth place, the team will have a two
week stretch with only one game — plenty of time for
Fortune to nurse his shaky knee and for the rest of the
squad to regroup and prepare for the NCAA tournament
on March 26-27 in Los Angeles.
