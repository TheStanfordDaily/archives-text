# Diversions
## Theater provides an alternative adventure in San Francisco 
### 
Many students are familiar with the
traditional attractions of San Fran
cisco, cable cars and Ghirardelli
Square, among others. For students
wishing to escape to the City, but also
to escape the tourists and vendors,
viewing a play could be a relaxing so
lution. The Geary Theater is cur
rently running a play designed to help
the viewer escape the hustle and
bustle of city life altogether. This dif
ferent type of San Francisco diversion
is to be found through the staging of
"Our Town."
The American Conservatory
Theater's current production is of
Thornton Wilder's oft-performed
American "classic." The play, a
somewhat nostalgic view of turn-of
the-century rural American life,
comes close to justifying its inclusion
in the repertory. Unfortunately, there
are enough problems that it never
realizes its full potential.
"Our Town" —for those of you
who are lucky enough never to have
seen a schmaltzy high school version
— is about life in Grover's Corners,
New Hampshire, circa 1901. The first
act is about daily living, the second
about love and marriage, and the
third about death. There is a narrator,
described as a stage manager, who
gives information about the history
and the future of the town. Grover's
Corners is a small town with
"traditional" American values. A
great deal is made of the fact that the
little town has no "culture" in the
snobbish sense of the word, and even
more is made of the importance of
the simple joys of moonlight, moun
tain vistas, the smell of heliotrope,
etc.
The ACT production, directed by
Janice Hutchins and William Ball,
manages (for two acts at least) to con
vey the simplicity and innocence of
Grover's Corners without being
sappy, patronizing or preachy. Peter
Donat, as the stage manager,

captures the essence of a New
Englander — wry, laconic and proud
— with what is generally a mar
velously understated performance.
The hint of superiority when he
describes the simple pleasures of the
town, the ironic frankness discussing
the future of its inhabitants, and the
smallest hint of pain describing the
death of an adolescent boy all add up
to a fine presentation of the moral,
straightforward individuals we like to
think made up America in the good
old days. The only thing that mars an
otherwise wonderful performance is
the directors' inclusion of a long ice
cream soda mime in the second act.
While the bit is flashy and cute (it
drew applause opening night) it
seems a bit out of place in the midst
of such a subtle performance.
There are a number of other
notable performances in the show.
ACT regulars Marrian Walters and
Sydney Walker both are good as a
gossipy old woman who cries at wed
dings and a bitter, drunken
choirmaster, respectively. Annette
Bening and Scot Bishop are also quite
good as Emily and George, the
romantic leads. Bening especially
does a fine job conveying adolescent
fears and joys. The famous scene in
which George and Emily "find out
they were made for one another" at a
soda fountain is quite well done, as
are the various histrionics leading up
to the wedding.
There are a number of problems
with the production, however. The
most noticeable is that the lack of a
genuine New England accent on the
part of most of the cast members.
There are strains of British, Southern
and several other accents that come
out instead in various places. The
word "George" seems to be
pronounced differently by every cast
member. It is not clear why the ac
cents were not dropped; the play
doesn't really need them and the at

tempts produced were distracting.
In addition, some of the acting is
not up to scratch. The normally
charming Rosemarie Smith as Mrs.
Gibbs and Francine Tacker as Mrs.
Webb turn in very flat performances
and lack the warmth that one would
expect in mothers, even overworked
ones. Worse yet, in the third act, An
nette Bening begins emoting hysteri
cally in the scene in which Emily
(now dead) looks back at the past. At
this point, the play falls off the
tightrope of verisimilitude that it
walks for two acts and falls into un
abashed melodrama. Bening is a bet
ter actress than she shows in the third
act, and it is unfortunate that the play
should finish out on such a wrong
note.
Overall, despite the faulty conclu
sion, the play succeeds in justifying its
production. The charm and simplicity
of the first two acts, aided enor
mously by David Percival's lovely
lighting (especially the moonlit se
quences), raise questions in the minds
of a modern audience. Was life really
ever that simple? What would it be
like to have a world that didn't
restructure itself every five years and
wasn't overwhelmed by "new and im
proved"? Despite the fondness with
which the directors have treated
Grover's Corners, it is not glorified to
the point of absurdity nor reduced to
sweet simplicity with no substance.
The care that has gone into the pro
duction makes the first two acts (at
least) worth seeing. The ACT "Our
Town" is true to Wilder's intentions:
it is a time capsule looking back to a
different era, and that, in itself prob
ably is enough to justify its unearth
ing.
Who can tell? Maybe one trip to a
play in the City will cure you of the
lure of Fisherman's Wharf long
enough to avoid the springtime
tourists.

fears and joys. The famous scene in
which George and Emily "find out
they were made for one another" at a
soda fountain is quite well done, as
are the various histrionics leading up
to the wedding.
There are a number of problems
with the production, however. The
most noticeable is that the lack of a
genuine New England accent on the
part of most of the cast members.
There are strains of British, Southern
and several other accents that come
out instead in various places. The
word "George" seems to be
pronounced differently by every cast
member. It is not clear why the ac
cents were not dropped; the play
doesn't really need them and the at

tempts produced were distracting.
In addition, some of the acting is
not up to scratch. The normally
charming Rosemarie Smith as Mrs.
Gibbs and Francine Tacker as Mrs.
Webb turn in very flat performances
and lack the warmth that one would
expect in mothers, even overworked
ones. Worse yet, in the third act, An
nette Bening begins emoting hysteri
cally in the scene in which Emily
(now dead) looks back at the past. At
this point, the play falls off the
tightrope of verisimilitude that it
walks for two acts and falls into un
abashed melodrama. Bening is a bet
ter actress than she shows in the third
act, and it is unfortunate that the play
should finish out on such a wrong
note.
Overall, despite the faulty conclu
sion, the play succeeds in justifying its
production. The charm and simplicity
of the first two acts, aided enor
mously by David Percival's lovely
lighting (especially the moonlit se
quences), raise questions in the minds
of a modern audience. Was life really
ever that simple? What would it be
like to have a world that didn't
restructure itself every five years and
wasn't overwhelmed by "new and im
proved"? Despite the fondness with
which the directors have treated
Grover's Corners, it is not glorified to
the point of absurdity nor reduced to
sweet simplicity with no substance.
The care that has gone into the pro
duction makes the first two acts (at
least) worth seeing. The ACT "Our
Town" is true to Wilder's intentions:
it is a time capsule looking back to a
different era, and that, in itself prob
ably is enough to justify its unearth
ing.
Who can tell? Maybe one trip to a
play in the City will cure you of the
lure of Fisherman's Wharf long
enough to avoid the springtime
tourists.

After going back to her 12th birthday, Emily Webb (Annette Bening) is overwhelmed with love for her
mother (Francine Tacker) in a scene from the Pulitzer Prize-winning drama "Our Town," running through
April 20 at the Geary in San Francisco.
Many students are familiar with the
traditional attractions of San Fran
cisco, cable cars and Ghirardelli
Square, among others. For students
wishing to escape to the City, but also
to escape the tourists and vendors,
viewing a play could be a relaxing so
lution. The Geary Theater is cur
rently running a play designed to help
the viewer escape the hustle and
bustle of city life altogether. This dif
ferent type of San Francisco diversion
is to be found through the staging of
"Our Town."
The American Conservatory
Theater's current production is of
Thornton Wilder's oft-performed
American "classic." The play, a
somewhat nostalgic view of turn-of
the-century rural American life,
comes close to justifying its inclusion
in the repertory. Unfortunately, there
are enough problems that it never
realizes its full potential.
"Our Town" —for those of you
who are lucky enough never to have
seen a schmaltzy high school version
— is about life in Grover's Corners,
New Hampshire, circa 1901. The first
act is about daily living, the second
about love and marriage, and the
third about death. There is a narrator,
described as a stage manager, who
gives information about the history
and the future of the town. Grover's
Corners is a small town with
"traditional" American values. A
great deal is made of the fact that the
little town has no "culture" in the
snobbish sense of the word, and even
more is made of the importance of
the simple joys of moonlight, moun
tain vistas, the smell of heliotrope,
etc.
The ACT production, directed by
Janice Hutchins and William Ball,
manages (for two acts at least) to con
vey the simplicity and innocence of
Grover's Corners without being
sappy, patronizing or preachy. Peter
Donat, as the stage manager,

captures the essence of a New
Englander — wry, laconic and proud
— with what is generally a mar
velously understated performance.
The hint of superiority when he
describes the simple pleasures of the
town, the ironic frankness discussing
the future of its inhabitants, and the
smallest hint of pain describing the
death of an adolescent boy all add up
to a fine presentation of the moral,
straightforward individuals we like to
think made up America in the good
old days. The only thing that mars an
otherwise wonderful performance is
the directors' inclusion of a long ice
cream soda mime in the second act.
While the bit is flashy and cute (it
drew applause opening night) it
seems a bit out of place in the midst
of such a subtle performance.
There are a number of other
notable performances in the show.
ACT regulars Marrian Walters and
Sydney Walker both are good as a
gossipy old woman who cries at wed
dings and a bitter, drunken
choirmaster, respectively. Annette
Bening and Scot Bishop are also quite
good as Emily and George, the
romantic leads. Bening especially
does a fine job conveying adolescent
fears and joys. The famous scene in
which George and Emily "find out
they were made for one another" at a
soda fountain is quite well done, as
are the various histrionics leading up
to the wedding.
