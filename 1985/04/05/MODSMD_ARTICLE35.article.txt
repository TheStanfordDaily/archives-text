## Tahoe offers wide variety of spring skiing options 
### 
After recent heavy snowfalls in the
Sierra Mountains, spring skiing con
ditions look extremely promising and
the Tahoe area offers a variety of
downhill skiing options. Twenty-two
resorts serve an average of 200,000
people daily throughout the
November-to-May season. If you
plan to go skiing but are not sure you
can afford the prices of lift tickets at
Squaw Valley or Heavenly more than
one or two times, you may want to
consider skiing some of the other
resorts.
Driving east on Interstate 80, the
first ski area you'll encounter is
Boreal. Conveniently located on 1-80
at the Castle Peak exit. Boreal is an
ideal ski resort for a number of
reasons, including quality conditions,
lift-ticket value and convenience.
Nine chairlifts service more than
300 acres of varied terrain, keeping
lift lines to a minimum. You're
guaranteed a full day of skiing — lift
lines are usually nonexistent. On the
busiest days, five to eight minutes is
the longest vou'll wait. Boreal's

slopes are best suited to beginning
and intermediate skiers. The most
difficult runs may not be challenging
enough for mo e advanced skiers.
Boreal also boasts the largest night
skiing operation in the Sierra. Unlike
other ski areas, where everyone
leaves by 4:30 p.m., at Boreal many
people are just arriving. The slopes
are lit until 10 p.m. Oftentimes,
people drive up from the Bay Area or
Sacramento and ski that evening
upon arrival.
Lift rates at Boreal are extremely
reasonable, as are ski rentals. Adult
all-day weekend lift tickets cost
$16, and half-day tickets are less ex
pensive. Midweek adult tickets are
$14. For information on special
group rates and help arranging group
ski trips, call (916) 426-3666.
When you finally pack up your skis
for the day, there are a variety of ac
commodations available. Boreal
Motel is within walking distance, and
hotels, motels and The Bradley
House Bed and Breakfast Inn are in
nearby Truckee. To make reserva

tions at Boreal's Motel, call (916) 426-
3668.
A final reason you may prefer
skiing at Boreal is convenience. 11 you
ski at Squaw Valley or other resorts
beyond Highway 89, heavy traffic at
day's end considerably lengthens the
time you'll spend driving home.
One mile from 1-80 on old High
way 40 is Soda Springs. This smaller
resort offers the unique opportunity
to be rented in its entirety by groups
or clubs. Adult lift tickets are $12 on
weekends. Fridays are college days
and tickets cost $10. If you enjoy
snowboarding, rentals and lessons are
available. Lessons are given at 10
a.m. and 2:00 p.m. on weekends.
For expert skiers, the unrivaled
Tahoe favorite is Squaw Valley. Site
of the eighth Winter Olympic Games
in 1964, Squaw Valley is contin
uously improving runs, adding lifts
and modernizing eating and lodging
facilities. A gondola, the world's larg
est tram, and 25 lifts open the area up
to skiers of every ability. Seventy per

cent of the slopes are beginning and
intermediate.
Grooming equipment is used on a
number of slopes, including the more
advanced runs. Adult all-day lift tick
ets at Squaw cost $24. I ockers can be
rented if you want to save money and
bring your own lunch. Squaw Vallv is

eight miles northwest of Tahoe City
off State Route 89.
The other resorts surrounding the
lake are of varying sizes, and the
prices range upward of $12. Most
charge between $16 and $20 on
weekends. If you are interested in
cross-country skiing, some of the

smaller resorts offer lessons, or you
can choose where you want to ski.
With sunshine on the forecast, the
skiing conditions look promising for
downhill and cross-country skiers
alike for the upcoming weekends.
