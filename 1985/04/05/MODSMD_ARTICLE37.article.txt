## Pole speaks on civil rights 
### KAREN BOLLERMANN Staff writer 
Polish human rights leader Wladyslaw Sila-Nowicki
spoke yesterday at the Law School on "Perspectives on
Freedom in Poland," making connections between
post-World War ll Poland and the rise of a grass-roots
civil rights movement embodied by Solidarity.
Speaking through an interpreter, the 72-year-old
Polish lawyer said that although the United States,
Great Britian and Poland had been allies prior to and
during World War 11, "when the war ended, these
former allies forgot about Poland."' As a result, Sila-
Nowicki said, "After World War 11, against their
(Poland's) will, Poland found itself in the Communist
camp."
Though Poland currently enjoys more civil freedom
than many Eastern Bloc satellite countries, Sila-
Nowicki said that "conditions are still far from ideal, as
in the United States." He attributes Poland's relative
degree of freedom to the formation and rise of grass
roots movements and organizations such as Solidarity.
Sila-Nowicki described the function and effect of
Solidarity on the Polish people and on the Polish state.
"Because trade unions have markedly stressed civil
freedoms, a civil war broke out in 1981, which
weakened hut did not crush Solidarity. Nevertheless

Solidarity has changed the outlook and thinking of mil
lions of people in Poland."
Despite strong opposition from the Polish govern
ment under which other Polish trade unions have
bowed, "There is no question that this movement will
fight for its existence. Solidarity is the only trade union
which has remained solid and aware of its tasks," Sila-
Nowicki said.
Although approximately 50 percent of the Polish
laboring classes belong to and support Solidarity, he
cited the conspicuous lack of involvement by youths
and workers from large corporations as current weak
nesses within the organization, but said this situation
will eventually improve.
Sila-Nowicki categorized Solidarity as "not an anti
communist movement, but rather an organization
fighting for increased civil freedom." However, the
existence of an independent trade union "cannot be
reconciled to communism and is adverse to it. Its very
existence creates a condition of anxiety in other Eas
tern satellite countries," he said.
The Polish people possess a "profound awareness of
freedom, which gives them hope for Poland, the
United States and other satellite countries," as both
the United States and Poland have "a profound love
for freedom," he said.
