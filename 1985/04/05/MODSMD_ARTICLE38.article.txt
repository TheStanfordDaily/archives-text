# Hospital treats Siamese twins
## 
### 
Siamese twins horn Tuesday are in #
stable condition at the Stanford
Hospital and are currently undergo
ing tests to determine it they can be
separated, according to Mike Good
kind of Medical Center News Serv ice.
The twins are joined just below the
diaphragm, Goodkind said. 1 hey
arrived at Stanford early Wednesday
morning.
Now doctors are doing "extensive
medical testing to determine what's
connected between the two (twins),"
Goodkind said. Prior to any opera
tion, doctors must determine it the
twins have all the organs they need to
survive on their own.
Goodkind said he expects doctors

to announce within one to two days
their decision on whether the twins
can be separated.
The identity of the twins remains
secret at the request of their family.
The twins were born Tuesday night
in Watsonville and "were transferred
up (to Stanford) in the wee hours of
Wednesday morning," Goodkind
said yesterday.
Goodkind said there is no single
physician in charge of the situation,
but rather there is a "whole medical
team working on it." For instance, it
"requires at least one pediatric sur
geon and an expert on early child
hood illness" (a neonatologist), he
said.
