# VTSS major receives nod
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
The Values, Technology, Science
and Society (VTSS) program was ap
proved as a major at yesterday's Fac
ulty Senate meeting.
The senate also approved a recom
mendation by the Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies (C-US) that the
Latin American Studies Program be
authorized to award an honors cer
tification in Latin American Studies
to majors in other programs. In other
business, the senate heard a positive
report on the value of distribution re
quirements.
Two VTSS degrees, bachelor of
arts (A.8.) and bachelor of science
(8.5.), will be available. Both will re
quire seven core courses totaling 28
units and computer literacy attained
by completing either Computer Sci
ence 106 or "proof of ability to use
the computer in academic work."
Students pursuing an A.B. degree will
also be required to master engineer
ing or science literacy and have a
thematic concentration: "a series of
courses organized around either an
area of technological application or a
traditional academic discipline."
The B.S. degree also requires a
thematic concentration: "a series of
courses in mathematics, the physical
sciences, computer science and/or en
gineering, designed by the student
under the supervision of a faculty
member in the area or discipline."
The report also stresses faculty advis
ing as an "important component of
the VTSS major."
VTSS Chairman James Adams, as
sociate dean in the School of Engi
neering and a member of the Faculty
Senate, said, "I expect we'll get about
40 people graduating" from the pro

gram, and it will be pretty evenly
divided between both degrees.
"The period for which this pro
posal is being made is for five years,
beginning September 1, 1985," said
C-US Chairman Jonathan Roughgar
den, professor of biology.
Criticism of the proposal targeted
VTSS' breadth of faculty and the
choice to introduce alternative
courses rather than build from those
currently offered by the University.
English Prof. John Bender ques
tioned whether VTSS could sustain
six or seven courses annually. Adams
said there should not be a problem,
because these core courses have been
offered every year.
Philosophy Prof. John Perry ques
tioned why the philosophy depart
ment was not utilized enough, espe
cially when teaching the "values" sec
tion of the program. Perry said VTSS
should offer more advanced courses
and use the basic ethics courses of
fered by the Philosophy Department.
Adams said VTSS offers alterna
tive courses because it often stresses a
different angle or wants to cover ma
terial at a faster rate than many se
quence courses currently offered.
It is hoped that the Faculty Sen
ate's approval of an honors certifica
tion in Latin American Studies will
set a precedent, said History Prof.
Carolyn Lougee, originator of the
idea.
The honors certification "is in
tended to complement study in any
conventional major," the proposal
states. It is "open to students major
ing in any field."
It will include at least 25 units con
sisting of "at least one course survey
ing Latin America comprehensively,
historically, or from the perspective
of the discipline, or in an explicitly in
terdisciplinary frame." The certifica
tion will also require "at least 20 ad
ditional units outside the student's
major discipline in 100-level courses
or higher, focusing directly on Latin
America or closely related topics."
Language proficiency in either

Spanish or Portuguese equivalent to
one course at the third-year level ot
University training is also required.
Roughgarden said the student could
fulfill the requirement with an oral
test if requested.
Lougee said the motion will enable
students to have more than one con
centration without double majoring.
It allows students the opportunity to
achieve an advanced level of research
in both areas, a benefit students do
not have enough time for with a
double major, she said.

According to a survey on the value
of distribution requirements, circ
ulated by the C-US, "Students clearly
believe that the distribution require
ment helped them," Roughgarden
told the senate. The findings were
based on 313 responses of graduating
seniors polled in January 1985, and
on eight former members of the Sub
committee on Distribution Require
ments.
Eighty-two percent of the respon
dents agreed that the new distribution
requirements improved their educa

tion, the report states.
However, 14 percent of the seniors
said that "the distribution require
ments forced them to take a course
that was too elementary for them."
There is "limited hard evidence"
that the new requirements have en
couraged a better balanced program
than the old requirements, Rough
garden said. The report shows that
the 1983-84 senior class had a some
what broader profile of course selec
tion than that of 1978-79.
