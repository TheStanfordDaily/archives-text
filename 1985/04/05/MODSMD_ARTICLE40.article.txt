## CINEMA SCOPE 
### 
Love and Death (1975)
U.C.Theater, Berkeley
This is a funny Woody Allen movie,
but its snob appeal is a put-off; you can't
help being conscious of the bewilderment
of moviegoers not conversant with Dos
toevski and Chekhov and Tolstoi at
many of his jokes. This is the cloest filmic
equivalent to a play like Tom Stoppard's
"Travesties." With Diane Keaton, Jes
sica Harper and talented young Alfred
Lutter, who played Ellen Burstyn's son
in "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore."
Plays today with "Stardust
Memories."
Indiana Jones and the Temple of
Doom (1984)
Memorial Auditorium
The first 20 minutes of the sequel to
"Raiders of the Lost Ark" contains the
same vertiginous pleasures as the best
parts of director Steven Spielberg's
"1941," and on the whole it's a superior
piece of craftsmanship to "Raiders" in
almost every way. But once Indiana
Jones (Harrison Ford), the archeologist
adventurer hero, and his friends (Kate
Capshaw and a young charmer named
Ke Huy Quan), get to India, the fun
stops. Indy undertakes the recovery of
two treasures stolen from a poor Indian
village — its children and a sacred stone
— and finds both in the Temple of Doom
within the palace of a creepy child
Maharajah. This section of the movie is
so repugnant and so relentlessly sadistic
that by the time the fun resumes, a good
hour later (with a crackerjack mine tun
nel rollercoaster ride), we're no longer in
the mood to enjoy it. Even Harrison
Ford appears to be having a lousy time —
though that may be the result of physical
pain (he suffered a ruptured disc during
the shooting) or of the frustrations of
playing opposite Kate Capshaw, who
throws herself into her dumb role with a
great deal more enthusiasm than skill.
Plays Sunday at 7 and 9:30.
The Maltese Falcon (1941)
Kresge Auditorium
Humphrey Bogart at his best in one of
the key roles of his career: Sam Spade,
the hero of Dashiell Hammett's lean, ex
istential detective thriller, who is
misanthropic and borderline paranoid
and fiercely loyal to a private code of eth
ics. Warners bought the rights to Ham
mett's novel in the very early 1930s and
certainly got their money's worth out of
it: Ricardo Cortez and Bebe Daniels
starred in the first, fairly literal version in
1931, and then it was dressed up for
Bette Davis (with Warren William in the
Spade role) and retitled "Satan Met a
Lady" in 1936. The Bogart version is, of
course, definitive. John Huston wrote the
screenplay and directed it, his first time
out: It was a stunning (and much talked
about) debut. With Mary Astor (in her

best peformance), Lee Patrick, Gladys
George, Ward Bond, Jerome Cowan and
a trio of homosexual villains (and Spade
is virulently anti-homosexual): Sydney
Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and Elisha
Cook, Jr.
Plays tonight at 9.
The Scarlet Pimpernel (1934)
Festival, Palo Alto
Delightful nonsense, adapted by a slew
of writers (Robert E. Sherwood, Sam
Berman, Arthur Wimperis and Lajos
Biro) from the Baroness Orczy novel
about a British fop who leads a double
life, liberating aristocrats under the very
noses of the officials of the French Revo
lution. Leslie Howard gives one of his
most ingratiating performances in the
title role and Merle Oberon looks so
ravishing as his deceived wife that you
may not notice (at first) how sketchy her
ideas on acting are. With Raymond Mas
sey, Nigel Bruce, Bramwell Fletcher,
Joan Gardner and Walter Rilla; directed
by Harold Young.
Plays through Wednesday with "The
Count of Monte Cristo."
Weekend (1967)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
Jean-Luc Godard's contemporary vi
sion of hell is not his most consistently
brilliant movie, or his most satisfying, or
his most accessible. But perhaps it should
be called his greatest, because at its best
— in the long erotic monologue (which
has only one equal in movies: Bibi An
dersson's description of the orgy in
"Persona") and the traffic jam sequence
(which is peerless) — it ranks with the
most provocative works of art of our cen
tury. "Weekend" marked the end of
Godard's classic period, which began in
1959 with "Breathless"; in the late '60s
he tumbled into a pedantic Maoist phase
from which he did not fully emerge until
1980. With Mireille Dare and Jean
Yanne.
Plays Tuesday with "La Chinoise."
La Chinoise (1967)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
A Jean-Luc Godard masterpiece, in
which he addresses the question of
revolutionary terrorism. No one else has
ever made movies in a style so complexly
intellectual and yet so sensuous and im
mediate; it's political, it's philosophical,
it's Pop. With Jean-Pierre Leaud, Anne
Wiazemsky, Francis Jeanson and Juliette

Berto; shot by the great Raoul Coutard.
Plays Tuesday with "Weekend."
The Lost Weekend (1945)
Cedar, San Francisco
James Agee (an alcoholic) called this
famous movie about a man on a binge "a
good Ph.D. thesis," and there's some
thing in that: It plays emphatically, with
every scene proving a point directly
linked to its theme. But it's a memorable
picture, partly because the dialogue,
which the director, Billy Wilder, and the
producer, Charles Brackett, collaborated
on, is pungent in a way that movies of
this period seldom are, and partly be
cause of Ray Milland's portrayal of the
boozer hero. Wilder's previous film,
"Double Indemnity," had suffered from
a tepid supporting cast, but he made up
for that fault here, with the help of Jane
Wyman, Frank Faylen, Howard Da
Silva, Doris Dowling, Philip Terry and
Clarence Muse. Based on a (fairly com
pelling) novel by Charles Jackson, "The
Lost Weekend" took the Best Picture
Oscar in its year, as well as Academy
Awards for direction, screenplay and for

Milland's acting.
Plays today and tomorrow with
"Sunset Boulevard."
Liliom (1930)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
The Hungarian playwright Ferenc
Molnar wrote this fantasy in 1909, and it
has been filmed three times: by Frank
Borzage in 1930, by Fritz Lang in 1933
(it was the last film he made before
emigrating to America) and by Henry
Koster in the form of Rodgers and Ham
merstein's "Carousel" in 1956. You have
to have a lot of patience for Molnar's
leaden whimsy, which had really dated
before any filmmaker had tried his hand
at this material, and this early talkie ver
'sion is painfully slow; the actors take
pauses that entire scenes might be played
in. Borzage's famed lyricism is not much
in evidence here, though the photogra
phy (by Chester Lyons) and art direction
(by Harry Oliver) are fairly exotic —
Borzage retained the Budapest setting of
the play — and border intriguingly on the
Expressionistic. Charles Farrell is pretty
dreadful as Liliom, the bum with a chip

on his shoulder who falls for an honest
working girl; as Julie, whom he marries
and abuses, Rose Hobart has some sweet
moments. The cast also includes Estelle
Taylor, H.B. Warner, Lee Tracy and
Walter Abel. S.N. Behrman (!) and
Sonya Levien co-authored the adapta
tion.
Plays Sunday with "Road to Rio."
The Elephant Man (1980)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
David Lynch's remarkable movie
about John Merrick, the "Elephant
Man," a human being hideously
deformed from birth. The screenplay by
Christopher DeVore, Eric Bergren and
Lynch is strong and unsentimental, but
the film is romantic — in the truest sense.
Its subject is the triumph of the human
spirit over the horrors of birth and envi
ronment. John Hurt is superb as Mer
rick; Anthony Hopkins, much more
restrained than usual, is surprisingly ef
fective as Frederick Treves, the London
doctor who "discovers" him. Freddie
Francis' magnificent black-and-white
photography emphasizes the symbols of
the Industrial Revolution: The film looks
like Dickens might have directed it. With
fine supporting performances by John
Gielgud and Wendy Hiller.
Plays Thursday with "Dune."
Dune (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The viscous, putrescent nightmare im
agery of "Eraserhead" and the rigidly
controlled romanticism of "The Ele
phant Man" lead one to expect miracles
of David Lynch's third full-length movie,
an adaptation of Frank Herbert's be
stselling epic fantasy, and indeed it is of
ten visually astonishing — especially
when the sand worms are around. But
Lynch, the Dali of contemporary
filmmakers, isn't really the right director
for this stuff. He doesn't appear to be in
terested in the (dozens of) characters or
in archetypes, either, though the story
comes equipped with a mythic dimension
and it cries out for our emotional in
volvement with the heroes; faithful to
Herbert's complicated narrative, he per
sonalizes the imagery yet remains totally,
curiously outside the story. His mark is
all over the movie, but it never trans
forms the unwieldy material. Inside the
Fritz Langian decor (designed by An
thony Masters and shot by Freddie
Francis) and the imaginative make-up,
an enormous cast barely makes a dent in

the confusing, overloaded story and the
jargonistic dialogue. (The movie is en
tirely in English, but it feels dubbed.)
Among the actors are Kyle MacLachlan,
Francesca Annis, Patrick Stewart. Rich
ard Jordan, Everett McGill. Jorgen
Prochnow, Jose Ferrer, Max von Sydow,
Brad Dourif, Kenneth McMillan, Silvana
Mangano, Sian Phillips and (in more suc
cessful bits) Sting, Linda Hunt and Alicia
Roanne Witt.
Plays Thursday with "The Elephant
Man."
Comfort and Joy (1984)
U.C.Theater. Berkeley
Bill Forsyth has invented a new sub
genre: an ironic comedy of manners so
understated it's practically submerged,
with the double take as its standard. He
may be the most distinctive comic
writer/director since Preston Sturges, and
"Comfort and Joy" is his "Christmas in
July" — a minor comedy but a perfectly
charming one. Forsyth is as serene as
Sturges was manic, but they share a vi
sion of the world as an immense mad
house. Bill Paterson heads an ideal cast
(Eleanor David, Rikki Fulton, Alex Nor
ton, Roberto Bernardi, George Rossi
and others). He plays a Glaswegian disc
jockey suffering from a depression after
his girl friend moves out; hankering for a
change in his career — he wants to be a
reporter — he becomes a middleman in
the war between two ice cream vending
gangs (the Scottish mafiosi). Shot by
Chris Menges and scored by Mark
Knopfler, Forsyth's collaborators on
"Local Hero."
Plays Tuesday with "Local Hero."
Local Hero (1983)
U.C.Theater, Berkeley
Utterly charming. That clever mini
malist comic actor, Peter Riegert, plays
an oil company executive who flies to
Scotland to buy up a village so that his
firm can set up a refinery on the land —
and the village turns out to be almost as
magical as Brigadoon. Living in a breath
taking landscape, under a showplace sky
where meteor showers erupt and the
aurora borealis makes guest appear
ances, the citizens have established an
entirely peaceful, laissez-faire society
where a very strange mix of people co
exist harmoniously. The Scottish writer
director, Bill Forsyth, keeps his camera
at a discreet distance, so that what hap
pens up on screen seems peculiarly self
contained, and the unrushed scenes snap
back at you with a delayed comic spring.
The cast is impeccable; among its gems
are Denis Lawson, Peter Capaldi and es
pecially Burt Lancaster. He's only in a
few scenes (he plays the oil company
chief), but he embodies the quirkily
benevolent spirit of the movie.
Plays Tuesday with "Comfort and
Joy."
