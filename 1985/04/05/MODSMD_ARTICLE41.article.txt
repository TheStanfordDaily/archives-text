## Sen. Kennedy to speak at hunger conference 
### DANNY PEARL 
Stanford volunteers are busy making final
arrangements for a six-day conference on
world and local hunger which will attract
more than 30 prominent speakers from across
the country, including Sen. Edward Kennedy
(D-Mass.).
The conference will begin Monday after
noon with a hunger rally in White Plaza.
James Grant, executive director of UNICEF,
will deliver the keynote address Monday at
7:30 p.m. in Kresge Auditorium. Kennedy
will speak at 12:15 Thursday in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
University President Donald Kennedy, who
is on the conference steering committee,
reacted enthusiastically to Sen. Kennedy's
planned appearance. "1 was happy to extend
the invitation to Sen. Kennedy and am just
delighted that he is able to accept, particularly
in view of his recent on-the-scene experience
in Africa."

Senator Kennedy made a Christmas visit to
Ethiopia and the Sudan, during which he and
his children performed volunteer work in
refugee camps.
Conference director Sarah von der I.ippe, a
senior majoring in international relations,
touted Senator Kennedy's credentials. "He
has shown a great deal of concern for hunger
in America and the world. 1 wish there were
more like him." Kennedy is a former chair
man and a member for 23 years of the Senate
Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee
Policy. He is also the author of a November
1984 senate report on hunger in America.
Melody Miller, Sen. Kennedy's deputy
press secretary, said Sen. Kennedy will
focus his remarks on the effects of the African
famine. She said he probably will not discuss
South African divestiture, an issue which has
been problematic for him. "We tend to think
of African hunger problems and the problem
of South Africa and human rights as two dif

ferent things," Miller said.
Miller also downplayed recent newspaper
reports that Kennedy is on the verge of
declaring his intention to run for president in
1988. "Senator Kennedy has always said he
would like to be president. There's really
nothing new."
Kennedy was originally asked to speak in
White Plaza, according to organizer Andrea
Butter. She said the speech was moved to
Dinkelspiel Auditorium presumably for se
curity reasons. The auditorium has a capacity
of about 700. Butter said loudspeakers will be
set up in White Plaza to allow more students
to hear the speech. KZSU plans to broadcast
the speech live, according to program director
Linda Christie.
For security reasons. Miller and von der
Lippe both declined to discuss security
details. Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington said, "We'll do what we can to make
sure he (Kennedy) is safe."

Kennedy's last Stanford speech was in 1977
at the medical school.
Rev. Jesse Jackson, who was being sought
to deliver the closing address, turned down
the invitation.
Other well-known speakers slated to ap
pear at the conference include Marion Wright
Edelman, a long-time civil rights and public
interest activist who heads the Children's
Defense Fund; Dr. Larry Brown, chairman of
the Physician's Task Force on Hunger in
America, which recently issued a report indi
cating that 20 million Americans suffer from
hunger; C. Payne Lucas, executive director of
Africaire, an Afro-American organization
concerned with famine relief; and Craig
Nalen, president of the Overseas Private In
vestment Corporation.
The conference will also feature panel dis
cussions, workshops and a Thursday after
noon "Hunger Faire" in White Plaza, where
relief organizations will discuss with students

employment opportunities and the mechanics
of food aid.
As many as 100 students and 20 faculty
members have been working on the week
long conference. 1 heir efforts have been
coordinated by Stanford Students Making a
Difference, a consortium of student organiza
tions which includes the Stanford Volunteer
Network, the Stanford International Devel
opment Organization and the ASSU.
"Everyone has chipped in with whatever they
can he helpful with," said Awetu Simmesso of
the Stanford East African Relief Organiza
tion.
