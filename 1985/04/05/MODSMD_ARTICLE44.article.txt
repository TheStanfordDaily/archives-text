# FREEZE FRAME
## 
### 
Ahorse is a horse is a horse, of course. But
are these modern-day ponies fooled by
that painted backdrop? Do they expect a
trio of trail-wise buckaroos to hustle out of a
nearby saloon, jump into their saddles and
growl in unison, "Let's ketch them varmints"?
Amy Carrico of Kansas City, Missouri caught this
whimsical setting for Freeze Frame. Along with a
small taste of photographic fame, she wins $35.
Do you have an eye-stopping, thought-pro
voking photograph lying around, waiting to be
seen by the Break staff? If so, please send it in to
us at Freeze Frame, 303 Nortft Clenoaks Blvd., Suite
600, Burbank. CA 91502 Please be sure to in
clude a stamped, self-addressed envelope in
which we may return your pictures, and please
label each picture with your name and address.
The deadline for our next contest is lune 28,
1985.
