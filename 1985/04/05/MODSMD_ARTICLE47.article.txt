# Doc Bucolic's List of Backpacking Gear

### 
Some vistas, some kinds of happy solitude, are only delivered by foot power (right).
(Below) Glance through the fence rails and you'll notice these hlkere in the Great Smokey
Mountains have discovered the pleasures of a rest stop.

Because of the space race and the spin
off of lightweight, resilient materials, back
packing has gone from the primordial to
the posh in less than a decade. The bewil
dering assortment of adjustable metal
frame packs, flexible but fixed plastic-frame
packs and convertible internal-frame packs
can cause the rookie to consider taking up
bocce ball or water polo instead. Don't be
intimidated. Shop around, not only for the
pack itself, but also for a knowledgeable
outdoor store proprietor. Insist on trying
the pack with an improvised load. Hike
around the shop, sit down, bend over,
climb up and down stairs. If the pack follows
you, providing freedom, flex and float (a
pack properly suspended from the hip
should feel as if it is floating slightly away
from your back), then you have a fit
smoother than Betty Grable's nylons.
Eating Out
Most freeze-dried food tastes like saw
dust and contains little in the way of ani
mal octane. Instead of some fluff in foil,
take along pemmican, butter, cheese,
beans, oatmeal and dense-as-a-brick brown
bread. In other words, stock up on the
same type of high-fat, high-protein grub
that fueled Admiral Peary's crazed assault
on the North Pole. Real food never goes
out of style.
Do not leave anything in rigid contain
ers; use zip-lock bags for repackaging ev
erything, even mulligan stew, and plan
meals so that you order from the luxury
menu first. As burger emporiums recede
into the dust, you get less picky, and as
your pack gets lighter your consciousness
climbs higher.
Depth of Field
Backpacking ventures, by their very na
ture, are unforgettable. Images imprint
deeper into your memory because there
are no civilized distractions, no murderous
machines, no Three's Company reruns fog
ging up your skull. But those outdoor inter
ludes committed to film are indisputably
indelible. Personally, I would rather leave
behind half my provisions and all of my
fresh Hanes than my 300-millimetre lens.
Fortunately one need not forsake protein
nor hygiene for photography. The prudent
selection of camera equipment will easily
put your "field research" in clear focus.
Wilderness light is a fickle phenomenon,
requiring both fast and slow film. Koda
chrome 64 and Kodak Ektachrome 400 films
cover every vagrant light. But outdoor pho
tographers with tenacity and a certain mad
glint in the eye may prefer the color satura

tion qualities of Kodachrome 25 film. For
black and white photography there is no
quandary; Kodak Tri-X pan film is the most
facile film that ever went for a dip in devel
oping solution.
A small, well designed tripod is a must.
Marginal light and movement are forest
factors which call for a mechanical assist.
Trust only a sturdy expensive model, as it
is a gut-wrenching experience to watch a
cheap drugstore tripod suddenly lurch
earthward and drill your beloved camera
into the landscape.
With the capabilities of contemporary
single-lens-reflex cameras, most strobes,
meters, filters, cable releases and the like
become superfluous gadgets. A basic selec
tion of high-caliber lenses, on the other
hand, provide an indispensable window on
the outdoor world. Though not the last
word, the following set of lenses promise
trail-tested performance: 50 mm f/1.4, a
compact, high-speed, all-purpose lens par
ticularly useful for scenic and candid shots;
100 mm f/4 macro, a wildly versatile lens
ideal for zeroing in on the cosmos at your
feet, as well as standard nature study and
portraiture; 300 mm f/4, a truly portable
telephoto so fast and crisp that it provides
a range of handheld shooting possibilities
from the journalistic to the romantic.
Inside Track
"Of the many vows that I took, I have
found the one about travelling on foot to
be the most beneficial." â€” Gandhi
Because it requires less strength than
state of mind, backpacking is as much a re
ligion as it is a recreation. That does not
mean it is a somber or mystical affair. After
all, backpacking is not really a faith, but a

small fervor. And it is a blessedly physical
as well as mental endeavor which leaves
worldly concerns and clocks and concrete
and digital devices far behind. No stress,
no strain, no interfacing. What better Rx for
psychic paralysis than to get off your tail
and hit the trail?

It is far better that the pilgrim make a
U-turn for the provinces than head into the
hinterland ill-prepared. Doc Bucolic sug
gests that you bash a few books, brain
drain backpacking acquaintances and
browse outdoor stores. But the quickest,
most pleasant way to become an experi
enced timber rat is to enlist with a back
packing club, then accompany them on
a shakedown cruise. In the meantime, Doc
Bucolic preaches the following notions con
cerning smart hiking hardware.
