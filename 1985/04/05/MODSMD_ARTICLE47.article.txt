# Doc Bucolic's List of Backpacking Gear
## 
### 
Some vistas, some kinds of happy solitude, are only delivered by foot power (right).
(Below) Glance through the fence rails and you'll notice these hlkere in the Great Smokey
Mountains have discovered the pleasures of a rest stop.

Because of the space race and the spin
off of lightweight, resilient materials, back
packing has gone from the primordial to
the posh in less than a decade. The bewil
dering assortment of adjustable metal
frame packs, flexible but fixed plastic-frame
packs and convertible internal-frame packs
can cause the rookie to consider taking up
bocce ball or water polo instead. Don't be
intimidated. Shop around, not only for the
pack itself, but also for a knowledgeable
outdoor store proprietor. Insist on trying
the pack with an improvised load. Hike
around the shop, sit down, bend over,
climb up and down stairs. If the pack follows
you, providing freedom, flex and float (a
pack properly suspended from the hip
should feel as if it is floating slightly away
from your back), then you have a fit
smoother than Betty Grable's nylons.
Eating Out
Most freeze-dried food tastes like saw
dust and contains little in the way of ani
mal octane. Instead of some fluff in foil,
take along pemmican, butter, cheese,
beans, oatmeal and dense-as-a-brick brown
bread. In other words, stock up on the
same type of high-fat, high-protein grub
that fueled Admiral Peary's crazed assault
on the North Pole. Real food never goes
out of style.
Do not leave anything in rigid contain
ers; use zip-lock bags for repackaging ev
erything, even mulligan stew, and plan
meals so that you order from the luxury
menu first. As burger emporiums recede
into the dust, you get less picky, and as
your pack gets lighter your consciousness
climbs higher.
Depth of Field
Backpacking ventures, by their very na
ture, are unforgettable. Images imprint
deeper into your memory because there
are no civilized distractions, no murderous
machines, no Three's Company reruns fog
ging up your skull. But those outdoor inter
ludes committed to film are indisputably
indelible. Personally, I would rather leave
behind half my provisions and all of my
fresh Hanes than my 300-millimetre lens.
Fortunately one need not forsake protein
nor hygiene for photography. The prudent
selection of camera equipment will easily
put your "field research" in clear focus.
Wilderness light is a fickle phenomenon,
requiring both fast and slow film. Koda
chrome 64 and Kodak Ektachrome 400 films
cover every vagrant light. But outdoor pho
tographers with tenacity and a certain mad
glint in the eye may prefer the color satura

tion qualities of Kodachrome 25 film. For
black and white photography there is no
quandary; Kodak Tri-X pan film is the most
facile film that ever went for a dip in devel
oping solution.
A small, well designed tripod is a must.
Marginal light and movement are forest
factors which call for a mechanical assist.
Trust only a sturdy expensive model, as it
is a gut-wrenching experience to watch a
cheap drugstore tripod suddenly lurch
earthward and drill your beloved camera
into the landscape.
With the capabilities of contemporary
single-lens-reflex cameras, most strobes,
meters, filters, cable releases and the like
become superfluous gadgets. A basic selec
tion of high-caliber lenses, on the other
hand, provide an indispensable window on
the outdoor world. Though not the last
word, the following set of lenses promise
trail-tested performance: 50 mm f/1.4, a
compact, high-speed, all-purpose lens par
ticularly useful for scenic and candid shots;
100 mm f/4 macro, a wildly versatile lens
ideal for zeroing in on the cosmos at your
feet, as well as standard nature study and
portraiture; 300 mm f/4, a truly portable
telephoto so fast and crisp that it provides
a range of handheld shooting possibilities
from the journalistic to the romantic.
Inside Track
"Of the many vows that I took, I have
found the one about travelling on foot to
be the most beneficial." — Gandhi
Because it requires less strength than
state of mind, backpacking is as much a re
ligion as it is a recreation. That does not
mean it is a somber or mystical affair. After
all, backpacking is not really a faith, but a

small fervor. And it is a blessedly physical
as well as mental endeavor which leaves
worldly concerns and clocks and concrete
and digital devices far behind. No stress,
no strain, no interfacing. What better Rx for
psychic paralysis than to get off your tail
and hit the trail?

It is far better that the pilgrim make a
U-turn for the provinces than head into the
hinterland ill-prepared. Doc Bucolic sug
gests that you bash a few books, brain
drain backpacking acquaintances and
browse outdoor stores. But the quickest,
most pleasant way to become an experi
enced timber rat is to enlist with a back
packing club, then accompany them on
a shakedown cruise. In the meantime, Doc
Bucolic preaches the following notions con
cerning smart hiking hardware.


Footwear: Boots are weights which must
be lifted and relifted, continually breaking
the grip of gravity. Most hikers take approx
imately 2,000 steps a mile, averaging about
ten miles a day. That's 20,000 steps; if your
boots weigh even one pound each, that's
20 tons of overlooked freight. Choose foot
wear that weighs mere ounces High
arched running shoes are an inexpensive
alternative to the costlier, heavier trail
boot. Buy only footwear which fits the
first lacing. "Breaking-in" shoes went out
with corsets.
Backpacks. You won't find what you want
at a discount store. Stick to the dedicated
outdoor stores. Remember that there is a
correlation between quality and cost. Your
spine will resent you for every penny you
pinch
Rain-ment Comfort, warmth and quality
can be summed up in one word — Gore-
Tex, a fabric which is windproof, water
proof, light weight and breathable A dou
ble stitched, seam-sealed Gore-Tex parka

will serve admirably as rain gear, all pur
pose outdoor wear and stylish about-town
garb. In Gore-Tex you can go from tromp
ing the back country to stomping at the
Savoy, no sweat (literally).
Sleeping Bags Poly is jolly Every manu
facturer has his own name, from Poly Guard
to Hollowfil, for the polyester insulation
used in nylon shell sleeping bags Poly
ester is less expensive, more durable and
more versatile than goose or duck down
Wet or dry, poly retains its loft and does
its job
Sleeping Pads Undoubtedly the easiest
choice in outdoor equipment, the Ther
marest is a combination air mattress (self
inflatable) and open cell foam pad It rolls
to half the size of conventional trail pads
and provides an elevated zone between
you and cold, hard terra-firma.
Tfnts The Space Age has been the shin
ing light of the tent industry Such labo
ratory developments as Gore-Tex fabric,

high-tensile alloys (for the shock-corded
poles) and computer-enhanced, stress
tested designs have led to very light,
roomy, efficient shelters. They cost a lot of
mazuma They're worth it
Stoves: Many good stoves, from simple al
cohol burners to self-priming white gas var
ieties, are available and affordable Though
it's heavier than some, Doc Bucolic likes
the solid, dependable Coleman Peak I be
cause it behaves in a blizzard, ne\er breaks
down and does not require a Master's De
gree in engineering to operate.
Honest Hose A good hiking sock is like
motor oil, without it you won't go any
where Doc Bucolic gets very impatient
with backpacking "bimbos" who spend a
fortune on marvy gear then skimp on socks.
Hiking socks come in silk, poly, nylon, cot
ton, wool and blends thereof Regardless
of composition, there is no such thing as a
"jake" sock for less than five bucks Trial by
trail will determine just what hose humors
your toes.

Because of the space race and the spin
off of lightweight, resilient materials, back
packing has gone from the primordial to
the posh in less than a decade. The bewil
dering assortment of adjustable metal
frame packs, flexible but fixed plastic-frame
packs and convertible internal-frame packs
can cause the rookie to consider taking up
bocce ball or water polo instead. Don't be
intimidated. Shop around, not only for the
pack itself, but also for a knowledgeable
outdoor store proprietor. Insist on trying
the pack with an improvised load. Hike
around the shop, sit down, bend over,
climb up and down stairs. If the pack follows
you, providing freedom, flex and float (a
pack properly suspended from the hip
should feel as if it is floating slightly away
from your back), then you have a fit
smoother than Betty Grable's nylons.
Eating Out
Most freeze-dried food tastes like saw
dust and contains little in the way of ani
mal octane. Instead of some fluff in foil,
take along pemmican, butter, cheese,
beans, oatmeal and dense-as-a-brick brown
bread. In other words, stock up on the
same type of high-fat, high-protein grub
that fueled Admiral Peary's crazed assault
on the North Pole. Real food never goes
out of style.
Do not leave anything in rigid contain
ers; use zip-lock bags for repackaging ev
erything, even mulligan stew, and plan
meals so that you order from the luxury
menu first. As burger emporiums recede
into the dust, you get less picky, and as
your pack gets lighter your consciousness
climbs higher.
Depth of Field
Backpacking ventures, by their very na
ture, are unforgettable. Images imprint
deeper into your memory because there
are no civilized distractions, no murderous
machines, no Three's Company reruns fog
ging up your skull. But those outdoor inter
ludes committed to film are indisputably
indelible. Personally, I would rather leave
behind half my provisions and all of my
fresh Hanes than my 300-millimetre lens.
Fortunately one need not forsake protein
nor hygiene for photography. The prudent
selection of camera equipment will easily
put your "field research" in clear focus.
Wilderness light is a fickle phenomenon,
requiring both fast and slow film. Koda

black and white photography there is no

With the capabilities of contemporary
single-lens-reflex cameras, most strobes,

word, the following set of lenses promise
trail-tested performance: 50 mm f/1.4, a
compact, high-speed, all-purpose lens par
ticularly useful for scenic and candid shots;
100 mm f/4 macro, a wildly versatile lens
ideal for zeroing in on the cosmos at your
feet, as well as standard nature study and
portraiture; 300 mm f/4, a truly portable
telephoto so fast and crisp that it provides
a range of handheld shooting possibilities
from the journalistic to the romantic.
Inside Track
"Of the many vows that I took, I have
found the one about travelling on foot to
be the most beneficial." — Gandhi
Because it requires less strength than
state of mind, backpacking is as much a re
ligion as it is a recreation. That does not
mean it is a somber or mystical affair. After
all, backpacking is not really a faith, but a

small fervor. And it is a blessedly physical
as well as mental endeavor which leaves
worldly concerns and clocks and concrete
and digital devices far behind. No stress,
no strain, no interfacing. What better Rx for
psychic paralysis than to get off your tail
and hit the trail?

It is far better that the pilgrim make a
U-turn for the provinces than head into the
hinterland ill-prepared. Doc Bucolic sug
gests that you bash a few books, brain
drain backpacking acquaintances and
browse outdoor stores. But the quickest,
most pleasant way to become an experi
enced timber rat is to enlist with a back
packing club, then accompany them on
a shakedown cruise. In the meantime, Doc
Bucolic preaches the following notions con
cerning smart hiking hardware.


Footwear: Boots are weights which must
be lifted and relifted, continually breaking
the grip of gravity. Most hikers take approx
imately 2,000 steps a mile, averaging about
ten miles a day. That's 20,000 steps; if your
boots weigh even one pound each, that's
20 tons of overlooked freight. Choose foot
wear that weighs mere ounces High
arched running shoes are an inexpensive
alternative to the costlier, heavier trail
boot. Buy only footwear which fits the
first lacing. "Breaking-in" shoes went out
with corsets.
Backpacks. You won't find what you want
at a discount store. Stick to the dedicated
outdoor stores. Remember that there is a
correlation between quality and cost. Your
spine will resent you for every penny you
pinch
Rain-ment Comfort, warmth and quality
can be summed up in one word — Gore-
Tex, a fabric which is windproof, water
proof, light weight and breathable A dou
ble stitched, seam-sealed Gore-Tex parka

will serve admirably as rain gear, all pur
pose outdoor wear and stylish about-town
garb. In Gore-Tex you can go from tromp
ing the back country to stomping at the
Savoy, no sweat (literally).
Sleeping Bags Poly is jolly Every manu
facturer has his own name, from Poly Guard
to Hollowfil, for the polyester insulation
used in nylon shell sleeping bags Poly
ester is less expensive, more durable and
more versatile than goose or duck down
Wet or dry, poly retains its loft and does
its job
Sleeping Pads Undoubtedly the easiest
choice in outdoor equipment, the Ther
marest is a combination air mattress (self
inflatable) and open cell foam pad It rolls
to half the size of conventional trail pads
and provides an elevated zone between
you and cold, hard terra-firma.
Tfnts The Space Age has been the shin
ing light of the tent industry Such labo
ratory developments as Gore-Tex fabric,

high-tensile alloys (for the shock-corded
poles) and computer-enhanced, stress
tested designs have led to very light,
roomy, efficient shelters. They cost a lot of
mazuma They're worth it
Stoves: Many good stoves, from simple al
cohol burners to self-priming white gas var
ieties, are available and affordable Though
it's heavier than some, Doc Bucolic likes
the solid, dependable Coleman Peak I be
cause it behaves in a blizzard, ne\er breaks
down and does not require a Master's De
gree in engineering to operate.
