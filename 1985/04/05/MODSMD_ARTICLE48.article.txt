As he looked at a book with photo
graphs ot prehistoric cave paintings,
it occurred to Edward Heins, a stu
dent at The Cooper Union School of Art that
humankind has always relied principally on
three particular colors for expressions of
drama Perhaps early humans were limited
because red and black pigments - from ber
ries from ashes and carbon — were the
prime materials at hand Or perhaps these
colors also the colors of blood and of mid
night are inherently stirring Along with

white, which increases drama by adding con
trast. red and black are still favorites today
Whatever must be bold, whatever must be
noticed is likely to use some or all of this
trio. Change black to dark blue and you have
the recipe for an American flag, for just one
example
Acting on his hunch, Heins went looking
around New York City for exemplars of these
three prominent locations on the color spec
trum The result is this photo essay, a state
ment in red, black and white, the colors that
cannot be ignored







Teakettles, fireplugs and fire engines:
doorframes, ads and graffiti scribblings:
objects that demand attention often
use the insistent colors of red black
and white.
