### CHARLIE GOFEN Editorial staff 
The long wait is almost over.
Undergraduate Admissions plans to mail all ac
ceptance, wait-list and rejection letters today to the
17,637 applicants to Stanford's Class of 1989. ac
cording to Dean of Admissions Jean Fetter.
"It is a time of mixed emotions," Fetter, who is
in her first year as admissions dean, said yesterday.
"We are exhilarated about accepting a fantastic
group of applicants, but sad for the ones to whom
we could not offer places . . . but who could do very
well here."
Fetter, who has called the admissions process
"an intellectual and physical marathon," said yes
terday that she has gotten a "last wind at the 100-
yard mark" in the final days of reading applica
tions. She noted that the team of readers was con
centrating in its final day on 60 to 70 borderline ap
plicants whose files have already been read at least
four times.
After admitting an initial group of extraor
dinarily qualified students early in the process, ad

missions officials have concentrated on a large
"swim category" of well-qualified students, aiming
to accept about 2.400 applicants in total, Fetter
said.
Eleven admissions staff members on a full-time
staff of 25 have been responsible for reading appli
cations, Fetter said. Each applicant file receives at
least two readings in the process, and most receive
at least three.
"We've been working from 8 a.m. to 1 a.m. . ..
seven days a week," said Fetter, who emphasized
the "unbelievable" effort of her staff, particularly
Director of Freshman Admissions John Bunnell, a
22-year Stanford admissions veteran. "They've
given their all," Fetter said. "They've had no per
sonal life to speak of."
Fetter said it is a "measure of how hard we've
worked" that Stanford had 4,000 more applicants
this year than did any one Ivy League school.
Prospective freshmen around the country say
they are anxious as they rummage through the mail
cach day in hopes of a thick Stanford envelope.
"I'm dying," said Karen Fredrickson, a senior at

Lake Oswego High School, outside of Portland,
Ore. "I'm getting really impatient and don't want
to wait any longer "
Chris Springer, a senior at Sacramento Country
Day School, said, "I just rechecked the notification
date again. I've been pretty impatient."
Bill Patrick, a senior at the St. Albans' School for
Boys, in Washington, D.C., said he feels "kind of
anxious" as he awaits final judgment from Stan
ford. He said that Stanford is his top choice, but
that he is not too worried because he has a scholar
ship for one year of study in China after high school
and plans to re-apply to Stanford if he is not ad
mitted.
Patrick said there is a great deal of admissions
competition within his school, noting that
"Stanford is the first choice for most people who
apply to it."
Patti Fazio, a senior at the Latin School of
Chicago, said she is "very eager to see what
[Stanford's] reply will be." But she added that she
would not be disappointed if she was rejected be
cause "I just applied to see if I could get in."
