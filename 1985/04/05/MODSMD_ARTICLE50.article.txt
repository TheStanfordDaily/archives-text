there's a studio loft where the pace
nearly matches the frenzy on the
streets outside. That's where Lynn
Goldsmith, photographer and musician,
comedienne, record, video, TV producer/
director, stock agency owner, talent man
ager, image consultant, song- and
scriptwriter and photographers' rep, is plot
ting her roadshow to American colleges.
"I want to stay in touch with what I know
to be the future," she explains. Not content
to let her photographs, records and videos
do all the talking, Goldsmith has organized
a college lecture tour. On that tour, she will

assume the guise of a man named Will
PowerSTa guy who's here to make cham
pions out of us all. In fact, Goldsmith plays
several different characters in order to
prove that success is within everyone's
reach.
Ambitious? Yes, absolutely. She doesn't
demur at success.
"There aren't many photographers as
successful, especially women, as I am. And
I'm not saying that in a braggart way. I feel
like a jerk sitting here saying so, but I could
tell anyone how to do the same thing," she
says, intending to do just that.
"I didn't perform any magic! If there was
a door closed, I figured out a way to get
around it.
"Who am 1 to call up and get a story on
the President? Who doesn't want to photo

graph the President? You figure it out."
Goldsmith figured out she could get a
session with then President Gerald Ford if
she sold a story on his personal White
House photographer, David Kennerly, to a
photography magazine. Now former Presi
dent Ford is one of several thousand celeb
rities among her one million color trans
parencies and two million black-and-whites
neatly filed, ready for shipment to maga
zines who print her with utter regularity.
Within seconds of my arrival at the loft,
she has set up her VCR to play videos of
singles from the album she did last year,
Danting for Mental Health, plus a register
and-vote commercial for MTV, her own
publicity tape and a motivational tape for
the (fictional) "Will Powers Institute." The
room goes dark, Lynn goes to retrieve cof-
