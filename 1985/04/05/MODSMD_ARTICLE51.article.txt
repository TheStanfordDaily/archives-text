fee, the tape starts and there's Meat Loaf
spitting beer on himself while "Will Pow
ers" chants, "You are an important person,
a rare individual. There has never been
anyone just like you."
"You can make it happen. It's you. Only
you," the tape keeps saying. It spins
through "Adventures in Success," "Oppor
tunity," "Smile" and "Kissing With Confi
dence" and constructs a world in which the
bald grow hair, the fat get thin, the wrink
led smooth out and adversity is true op
portunity — all over a soundtrack helped
along by Robert Palmer, Sting and Todd
Rundgren.
A child of Detroit and Miami Beach High
School (where she joined 14 clubs) and
the University of Michigan, where she took
two degrees in three years (a teaching cer
tificate plus radio and TV direction),
Goldsmith never figured she would be a
photographer.
"I thought I would either be a singer
songwriter or a director," she remembers.
She was in a band in college, living next
door to future film director Larry Kasdan
(The Big Chill). Eventually, Goldsmith co
managed the rock band Grand Funk Rail
road. She also did national publicity for
Elektra Records, helped invent the video
magnification system used to project rock
concerts at Madison Square Garden and
the Hollywood Bowl, and started to direct
the first late-night television rock show,
ABC's In Concert.
"I was using stills to storyboard my
ideas. The record company came to a

Chuck Berry concert and wanted to buy my
stills of Chuck Berry." When the photos
earned more than she got for directing
the show, she took a surprised look at
photography.
"I was the youngest director in the Di
rectors Guild of America," she says,"and I
was tired of proving myself." There was a
lot of proving to be done, too, for a young
woman in that fraternity.
"Photography was something I could do
alone. It was simpler, it paid more, and I
could get more satisfaction because of
the connection I had with the subjects I
photographed."
The rest is hardworking history, though
Goldsmith claimed her share of the fa
mous-photographer market with blister
ing speed.
"I didn't wait for assignments. I got to
the people I wanted to shoot, shot and
sold the pictures. For celebrities who rel

ished the publicity, she often shot free, re
tained all rights and got permission to
market the results wherever she could. She
not only made her cut-line übiquitous in
the U.S., U.K., Japan and elsewhere, but set
up a stock agency and began to represent
about 30 far-flung photographers, who ex
tend the reach of LGI — Lynn Goldsmith
Incorporated — considerably.
Popularly known as a rock photographer,
Goldsmith is quick to point out that her
range is far greater than just rock & roll
She nods to last week's work for Harper's
Bazaar and an on-going Faberge contract.
"You don't get those kinds of jobs if they
see you as a rock photographer," she cau
