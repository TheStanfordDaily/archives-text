other major magazines don't seem to
mind
When it comes to doing her lecture tour,
though, she knows her life in the rock world
makes her somebody kids want to talk to.
She's done definitive shots of Mick lagger,
Michael lackson, Patti Smith, Laurie Ander
son, Bruce Springsteen and Sting. You al
most have to ask who she hasn't shot, with
1,000 bands and performers in stock; album
covers for Frank Zappa, the B-525, lan
Hunter, Black Uhuru, Carly Simon, Simon
and Garfunkel, the Talking Heads, among
others; assorted tour books; and starting
last year, one book a year dedicated to a
single star or group. So far she's done the
Police and Springsteen, with half the
profits going to a humanitarian group
called "Save the Children.''
"I love taking pictures and I'll do it my

whole life," she says, "but I don't consider
myself a photographer. I see myself — it
sounds silly — as Will Powers, an example
of someone breaking limitations, breaking
barriers, breaking categories."
She's right. She sounds downright corny.
And she doesn't mind admitting it.
You begin to sense a certain courage
when you know a lot of postmoderns will
find her optimistic videos downright naive.
They're equally at home on MTV, she says,
and the Disney Channel. They're even used
by Captain Kangaroo, as therapy for autis
tic children and by Britain's National Mar
riage Guidance Council.
We kick the talk back to photography.
She calls herself a freak for Kodak products
— Kodachrome 25 film in the studio,
Kodachrome 64 film outside and for shoot
ing groups. She gives a few mechanics of
her sessions and talks about looking
through the lens with both inner vision and
peripheral vision.
It's clear, though, that for Lynn Gold
smith, photography is just one facet of a
much larger communication process.



Among the many celebrities who have
been on the business end of Goldsmith's
lens are actor Richard Gere (left), new
wave songstress Annie Lennox (above)
and actress Karen Allen (below).
