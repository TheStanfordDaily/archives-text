# Lynn Goldsmith and Will Powers: Two of a Kind
## 
### 
Will Powers is photographer Lynn
Goldsmith transformed into a play-acting
character. He's also a man who seems to
be talcing over her life, starting with a col
lege lecture tour.
The tour took shape when Lynn did a
story on G. Gordon Liddy and discovered
the college circuit through Liddy's booking
agency, Brian Winthrop International.
She'll talk about photography and show
her motivational videos. Ironically, her
photos of rock stars are her ticket to talk

at colleges, but her goal is to demystify
success.
"You realize in photographing the stars
that everybody is vulnerable, even the
people you think are immune to such
things. College kids want to know how I got
next to their heroes. Well, guess what?
Sting is no better than you. That's my
basic approach.
"College is a halfway house. I want to
add reality to it, help them learn how to
operate in the real world.
"I want to be with the audience for my
photographs and videos. I want to interact,
answer questions, participate without TV
or a magazine in the middle. It's a dif
ferent world out there now and unless
you communicate with it you don't know
what it is."


Will Powers,
as played by Goldsmith,
Is a guy who won't be held back.
