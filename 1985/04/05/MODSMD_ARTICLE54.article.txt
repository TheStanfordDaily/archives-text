# LOW LIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY
## 
### ERIC ESTRIN 
With the variety of sensitive, high
speed film on the market these
days, you can take pictures any
where, as long as you keep in mind a few
basic points. First of all, it helps to have a
camera with a fast lens — meaning f/2.8 or
better (the lower the number, the faster
your lens). Even if your lens is not that fast,
you can still take low-light photographs —
but you may need to use a tripod to keep
your camera steady for longer exposures.

In either case, make sure you're using an
appropriate film for your subject. Koda
color VR 400 or 1000 film is recommend
ed for color prints. The higher speed (1000)
is preferable for extremely low light. The
lower-speed film offers more versatility in
a wider range of situations. Kodak Ekta
chrome 200 or 400 film can be used for
slides shot in natural light, or Kodak Ek
tachrome 160 film for slides when the pre
dominant light source is from tungsten
bulbs. Kodak Tri-X pan film is recom
mended for black and white shots.
Almost all indoor settings lit without
flash or other professional gear would be
considered low-light photographic oppor
tunities. These settings often provide
pleasing results, because sunshine filtering
in through windows eliminates harsh
shadows and makes for even, flattering
light. To maximize this condition, make
sure window shades and blinds are opened,
whenever possible. Similarly, when shoot
ing indoors at night or on overcast days, it
may help to turn on all lights in the room.

When taking pictures in this manner, try
to position your subject facing the light.
Take a meter reading from the subject's
face, or whatever area you consider the most
important part of the shot. If you include
the light source, or even large portions of a
reflective surface such as a light-colored wal I
in the reading, you risk "fooling'' your light
meter and underexposing your subject.
Conversely, try not to include much of the
open window or other light source in the
frame. This part may be overexposed if you
have taken a reading from your subject.
Other kinds of low-light photo oppor
tunities take place outside the home after
daylight. Early evening is a good time to
capture sunsets and other nature shots
in a soft, pleasing light. In addition, most
city lights are turned on by this time, and
they can serve as the focal point of a va
riety of shots.
It's easy to take pictures of city lights at
night, because they turn out well at a wide
range of exposures. Perhaps a stream of
automobile headlights along a dark road
way makes for an interesting geometric
design in black and white. Or, you might
prefer shooting a colorful neon sign, or
an entire block of storefronts. Fast shut
ter speeds will emphasize detail in the
lights themselves, while longer exposures
result in more detail in surrounding shad
dow areas.

also be utilized to great effect when shoot
ing indoor concerts or sporting events,
or outdoor events at night. For sports
events, it's often best to shoot at the fast
est shutter speed possible, in order to stop
the action. If low-light conditions force
you to expose for i/6o second or longer,
chances are, you will get some blurred
motion. This phenomenon is minimized,
however, at the peak of the action — the
top of an athlete's jump, the moment a
ball hits a bat, and so on. In addition, you
can get satisfying results by panning your
camera with the action, blurring only the
background.
Once you start experimenting, you'll find
there's literally no end to the array of
good photographs available in dim light.
Streetlights, candlelights, even the light
of a clear, night sky can provide enough
illumination to make beautiful pictures.
All that's usually needed is a camera
with a fast lens, some sensitive film, and a
healthy imagination.


Votive candles provide even, warm
light, as well as an unusual frame for
the subject.

but reflected light off a white tablecloth
helps show detail in their faces.
