# POSTERS
## 
### ERIC ESTRIN 
Are you inspired by the sight of a
beautiful sunset, a snow-capped
mountaintop or the perfect wave? Do
you find yourself sneaking peeks inside,
your wallet during dull moments in the
classroom, just to glance at a favorite pic
ture of your boyfriend or girlfriend? Have
you ever been captured on film in a truly
memorable scene — maybe posing with
someone you admire, or sliding into home
plate with the wi-nning run?
Well, wallet-sized snapshots are great,
but for your really special images, maybe
it's time to think big. Kodak Processing
Labs have now made it simple to blow up
35-millimetre color negatives and slides to
poster size — a whopping 20 x 30 inches —
at a price usually associated with prints
less than half as big.
Thanks to new printing technology,
Kodak is able to produce these massive
megaphotos at a list price of only $17.95,
while smaller color blowups of 16 x 24 typ
ically list for around $36.50. In order tc
keep costs down, there are some restric
tions. however, which apply specifically tc

poster-size prints.
First of all, the blowups can be made
only from 35-millimetre color negatives or
slides. Anything smaller than that would
require too great a magnification and the
resulting print might appear out of focus or
too grainy. Secondly, no customized work
— such as touch-ups or cropping — can be
done on the finished product. And finally,
the posters are available on textured paper
only.
George Bears, Marketing Director for
Kodak Processing Labs, says the poster
service has been booming since its na
tional introduction toward the end of 1983
(the product had been test-marketed re
gionally for about a year before that). Sur
veys show that about 42 percent of the
posters made are scenic shots; another 28
percent are people pictures; and the re
mainder fall into pets and other categories.
According to Bears, more than 90 percent
of the people using the sen/ice say they are
delighted with the print quality. Problems
tend to arise only when the original nega
tive or slide is of poor quality.
The first rule of thumb is to make cer
tain your photo is completely sharp. Check
it with a magnifying glass Any blurring
will be greatly magnified
The same goes for graininess Often, a

small picture will look okay with some
grain in it, but when enlarged to 8 x 10, the
grain becomes conspicuous Well, at 20 x
30, you can bet the phenomenon will be
intensified; so unless that effect is your in
tended goal, be sure that your slide or
negative shows as little grain as possible.
To do this, you'll want to start by using a
fine-grained film. Kodacolor VR 100 film is
recommended if you're shooting color print
film, but Kodacolor VR 200 film is also ac
ceptable Any of Kodak's low-speed slide
films — Kodachrome 25 or 64 films and
Kodak Ektachrome 64 film — are ideal, but
Kodak Ektachrome 160 or 200 film can also
bring good results.
Another tip: select a photo that is well
exposed, neither too dark nor too light,
with pleasing colors.
When you've decided which picture you
want to cover your wall, make sure there
are no scratches or marks on the film, for
these aberrations will surely be magnified
on the final print. Then take it to your
photo dealer and ask him to send it to
Kodak. You should see the finished results
.in about ope week.
As with any piece of artwork, you
should select something you want to see a
lot of. Because now you can see more of it
than ever before.
