Donald Galles, a member of the
Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity, was
elected president of the Interfraternity
Council (IFC) Wednesday night.
Galles, a junior majoring in computer
science and electrical engineering, said
his major goal as IFC president will be
"to strengthen the IFC and therefore
strengthen the fraternity system."
The IFC serves as a single inter
mediary between the University and the
various fraternities, making recommen
dations on policies and actions the Uni
versity might undertake in regard to the
Greek system here. The IFC also helps
coordinate fraternity community service
projects, such as yesterday's IFC
sponsored blood drive in White Plaza.
"Just recently, the IFC has really
become stronger and taken new direc
tions in working with fraternities and
the faculty." Galles said last night. He
said he will continue the fraternity svs
