Costa Ricans nab murder suspect
SAN JOSE. Costa Rica — Police tipped by the United States captured
the prime suspect in the kidnap-slaying of a U.S. narcotics agent after a
bnef gun battle at a farmhouse yesterday, authorities reported.
Security Minister Benjamin Piza said Costa Rican agents, acting on in
formation from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, found
Rafael Caro Quintero on a farm close to San Jose's international airport.
In Mexico City, a spokesman for the Attorney General's Office said
procedures had begun to extradite Caro Ouintero for questioning in the
killing of DEA agent Enrique Camarena Salazar. 37. who was abducted
Feb. 7 and found dead March 5. No charges have been filed against Caro
Ouintero.
Piza said the agents were greeted by gunfire when they went into the
farmhouse, but there were no injuries and Caro Ouintero surrendered.
With him were four men and a 17-year-old Mexican woman who
claimed to have been kidnapped. Piza said.
Camarena was kidnapped within sight of the U.S. consulate in
Guadalajara. Mexico, which has become known as a center of the drug
trade in Mexico. His body was found on a ranch 60 miles southeast of
the city with that of a Mexican pilot who worked with him and had been
abducted separately.
Mexican authorities describe Caro Ouintero as a major drug trafficker
in Guadalajara and say he had vowed many times to kill Camarena.
Francisco Fonseca of the Mexican Attorney General's Office said
Caro Ouintero was detained by Costa Rican security officials after he
presumably entered Costa Rica illegally in a private airplane with five
other people.
DEA agents had last seen Caro Ouintero in February at the
Guadalajara airport, where he embraced a ranking police officer and
then boarded a private plane.
Baker cautions aganist trade war
WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary James Baker said yesterday
that he is not sure that the United States would win a trade war with
Japan.
Baker told a Senate hearing that while "we do need more access to
Japanese markets for beef, agricultural products, telecommunications
and a lot of other things. .. I'm just not sure that the way to get there is
to have an all-out trade war."
"I'm not sure we'd win that,'' Baker told the Senate Appropriations'
subcommittee on foreign operations.
Baker said the Reagan administration is eager to secure an agreement
at an annual economic summit with six other countries next month to set
up a new round of international trade talks.
He predicted, however, that congressional approval of limits on U.S.
imports from Japan would "absolutely foreclose the possibility'* of con
vincing that nation to come to the trade table.
Meanwhile in Tokyo, Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe dispatched his
deputy for economic affairs in an effort to quell increasing congressional
demands for stiff action to correct a trade deficit that grew to 536.8 bil
lion in Japan's favor last tear.
State Department spokesman Bernard Kalb said Reishi Teshima. the
economic envoy, will meet with several senior officials, including Allen
Wallis. under secretary of state for economic affairs, to discuss the cur
rent state of trade relations.
Kalb said the Teshima would also be meeting with other administra
tion officials and probably with congressmen involved in trade issues.
He declined to comment on the state of U.S.-Japan trade ties.
After the congressional hearing, reporters asked Baker about the ef
fects of an international trade war.
'"We'd have no market for our products." he replied. "We'd be
foreclosed from exporting. And it would have a very deleterious effect
on the world economy."
Earlier. Sen. Arien Specter < R-Pa.) asked what would be wrong with a
flat prohibition against any Japanese goods coming into the United
States in excess of what Japan permitted into this country.
"The only thing that I think is wrong with that ... is that (it) is out
right protectionism, and what you'd be doing about that in my opinion
would be a trade war," Baker replied.
Israelis raid Lebanese Shiite village
KAWTHARIET ASSIYAD. Lebanon — Israeli troops searching for
guerrillas swept through a Shiite Moslem village in southern Lebanon on
yesterday and reported they killed eight "armed terrorists" in the raid.
Several miles to the south, a roadside bomb exploded and wounded
three French soldiers of the U.N. peacekeeping force. U.N. spokesman
Timur Goksel said it was the first time U.N. troops had been victims of a
roadside bomb since they took up peacekeeping duties in southern
Lebanon in 1978.
Bombs placed along roads are a frequent weapon of guerrillas fighting
Israeli occupation troops who are in the process of withdrawing from
Lebanon. Three Israeli soldiers were wounded in two roadside bomb
blasts yesterday.
In Sidon. provincial capital of south Lebanon, fighting between Chris
tian and Moslem militiamen tapered off after overnight battles left two
people dead and 22 injured. But police said seven people were wounded
by sniper fire yesterday. The latest casualties raised the toll in Sidon in
the last seven days to 47 dead and 179 wounded.
Reporters who entered Kawthariet Assiyad after the Israeli raid found
women weeping in the streets over the victims and over the destruction
of three houses in the village, which is nine miles south of Sidon.
Villagers said the Israelis had entered at first light and left in the early
afternoon. They said ihe raiding part) included 40 armored personnel
earners and at least two Merkava tanks.
The Israeli military command in Tel Aviv said its soldiers had killed
eight "armed terrorists'" in the raid, five as they tried to escape in a car
and three others who were fleeing a nearby cave.
The bodies of two village men were seen in Lebanese Red Cross am
bulances on the edge of the village. It could not immediately be deter
mined if they had been included in the Israeli army's count.
Red Cross volunteers said no weapons were found on either man.
One, identified as Mohammed Amin Karaki, 28, died of bullet wounds
on a \illage road, the volunteers said. The other. Ahmed Mohsen. 21,
had been hit in the back with machine-gun fire in a nearby field, they
added.
One ttoman. Ansaf Kujok. said that during the raid "bullets were fall
ing here like rain.'' The porch of a house nearby was littered with
hundreds of emptv machine-gun shell casings.
The raid on Kawthariet Assiyad followed the pattern of most of the
more than 40 anti-guerrilla sweeps the Israelis have conducted since
their "iron fist" polic> was initiated on Feb. 19 in response to attacks on
Israeli soldiers b\ guerrillas.
The French peacekeepers were wounded b> a blast near the village of
Jouaxa. east of T\re Goksel said the three Frenchmen were taken by
helicopter to a U N. field hospital and were in satisfactory, condition.
Chinese regret cutback in U.S. aid

regretted" the U.S. decision to reduce its contribution to a United Na
tions population program because of news reports of forced abortion in

official news agency said.
The Reagan administration said Saturday it was reducing its contribu
tion to the U.N. Fund for Population Activities by $10 million, the
amount the ageno plans to spend in China this >ear.

for the U.N. program's family-planning activities in China.
"It is to be deeply regretted that the U.S. administration, in defiance
of the facts, has made this decision based on distorted reports and
rumors in the American press." Wane said.

that he is not sure that the United States would win a trade war with
Japan.
Baker told a Senate hearing that while "we do need more access to
Japanese markets for beef, agricultural products, telecommunications
and a lot of other things. .. I'm just not sure that the way to get there is
to have an all-out trade war."
"I'm not sure we'd win that,'' Baker told the Senate Appropriations'
subcommittee on foreign operations.
Baker said the Reagan administration is eager to secure an agreement
at an annual economic summit with six other countries next month to set
up a new round of international trade talks.
He predicted, however, that congressional approval of limits on U.S.
imports from Japan would "absolutely foreclose the possibility'* of con
vincing that nation to come to the trade table.
Meanwhile in Tokyo, Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe dispatched his
deputy for economic affairs in an effort to quell increasing congressional
demands for stiff action to correct a trade deficit that grew to 536.8 bil
lion in Japan's favor last tear.
State Department spokesman Bernard Kalb said Reishi Teshima. the
economic envoy, will meet with several senior officials, including Allen
Wallis. under secretary of state for economic affairs, to discuss the cur
rent state of trade relations.
Kalb said the Teshima would also be meeting with other administra
tion officials and probably with congressmen involved in trade issues.
He declined to comment on the state of U.S.-Japan trade ties.
After the congressional hearing, reporters asked Baker about the ef
fects of an international trade war.
'"We'd have no market for our products." he replied. "We'd be
foreclosed from exporting. And it would have a very deleterious effect
on the world economy."
Earlier. Sen. Arien Specter < R-Pa.) asked what would be wrong with a
flat prohibition against any Japanese goods coming into the United
States in excess of what Japan permitted into this country.
"The only thing that I think is wrong with that ... is that (it) is out
right protectionism, and what you'd be doing about that in my opinion
would be a trade war," Baker replied.
Israelis raid Lebanese Shiite village
KAWTHARIET ASSIYAD. Lebanon — Israeli troops searching for
guerrillas swept through a Shiite Moslem village in southern Lebanon on
yesterday and reported they killed eight "armed terrorists" in the raid.
Several miles to the south, a roadside bomb exploded and wounded
three French soldiers of the U.N. peacekeeping force. U.N. spokesman
Timur Goksel said it was the first time U.N. troops had been victims of a
roadside bomb since they took up peacekeeping duties in southern
Lebanon in 1978.
Bombs placed along roads are a frequent weapon of guerrillas fighting
Israeli occupation troops who are in the process of withdrawing from
Lebanon. Three Israeli soldiers were wounded in two roadside bomb
blasts yesterday.

tian and Moslem militiamen tapered off after overnight battles left two
people dead and 22 injured. But police said seven people were wounded
by sniper fire yesterday. The latest casualties raised the toll in Sidon in
the last seven days to 47 dead and 179 wounded.
Reporters who entered Kawthariet Assiyad after the Israeli raid found
women weeping in the streets over the victims and over the destruction
of three houses in the village, which is nine miles south of Sidon.
Villagers said the Israelis had entered at first light and left in the early
afternoon. They said ihe raiding part) included 40 armored personnel
earners and at least two Merkava tanks.
The Israeli military command in Tel Aviv said its soldiers had killed
eight "armed terrorists'" in the raid, five as they tried to escape in a car
and three others who were fleeing a nearby cave.
The bodies of two village men were seen in Lebanese Red Cross am
bulances on the edge of the village. It could not immediately be deter
mined if they had been included in the Israeli army's count.
Red Cross volunteers said no weapons were found on either man.
One, identified as Mohammed Amin Karaki, 28, died of bullet wounds
on a \illage road, the volunteers said. The other. Ahmed Mohsen. 21,
had been hit in the back with machine-gun fire in a nearby field, they
added.
One ttoman. Ansaf Kujok. said that during the raid "bullets were fall
ing here like rain.'' The porch of a house nearby was littered with
hundreds of emptv machine-gun shell casings.
The raid on Kawthariet Assiyad followed the pattern of most of the
more than 40 anti-guerrilla sweeps the Israelis have conducted since
their "iron fist" polic> was initiated on Feb. 19 in response to attacks on
Israeli soldiers b\ guerrillas.
The French peacekeepers were wounded b> a blast near the village of
Jouaxa. east of T\re Goksel said the three Frenchmen were taken by
helicopter to a U N. field hospital and were in satisfactory, condition.

regretted" the U.S. decision to reduce its contribution to a United Na
tions population program because of news reports of forced abortion in

official news agency said.
The Reagan administration said Saturday it was reducing its contribu
tion to the U.N. Fund for Population Activities by $10 million, the
amount the ageno plans to spend in China this >ear.

disperses the money, said in Washington that they had received guaran
tees that none of its remaining 536 million contribution would be used

"It is to be deeply regretted that the U.S. administration, in defiance
of the facts, has made this decision based on distorted reports and
rumors in the American press." Wane said.
Costa Ricans nab murder suspect
SAN JOSE. Costa Rica — Police tipped by the United States captured
the prime suspect in the kidnap-slaying of a U.S. narcotics agent after a
bnef gun battle at a farmhouse yesterday, authorities reported.
Security Minister Benjamin Piza said Costa Rican agents, acting on in
formation from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, found
Rafael Caro Quintero on a farm close to San Jose's international airport.
In Mexico City, a spokesman for the Attorney General's Office said
procedures had begun to extradite Caro Ouintero for questioning in the
killing of DEA agent Enrique Camarena Salazar. 37. who was abducted
Feb. 7 and found dead March 5. No charges have been filed against Caro
Ouintero.
Piza said the agents were greeted by gunfire when they went into the
farmhouse, but there were no injuries and Caro Ouintero surrendered.
With him were four men and a 17-year-old Mexican woman who
claimed to have been kidnapped. Piza said.
Camarena was kidnapped within sight of the U.S. consulate in
Guadalajara. Mexico, which has become known as a center of the drug
trade in Mexico. His body was found on a ranch 60 miles southeast of
the city with that of a Mexican pilot who worked with him and had been
abducted separately.
Mexican authorities describe Caro Ouintero as a major drug trafficker
in Guadalajara and say he had vowed many times to kill Camarena.
Francisco Fonseca of the Mexican Attorney General's Office said
Caro Ouintero was detained by Costa Rican security officials after he
presumably entered Costa Rica illegally in a private airplane with five
other people.
DEA agents had last seen Caro Ouintero in February at the
Guadalajara airport, where he embraced a ranking police officer and
then boarded a private plane.
