# Reagan calls for Nicaraguan peace
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan called
yesterday for a ceasefire and peace negotiations in
Nicaragua and warned that he would seek a re
sumption of military aid to rebel forces if the ruling
leftists do not agree to a settlement within 60 days
after opening negotiations.
Nicaragua promptly rejected Reagan's plan, ter
ming it a "public relations manuever" and vowing
that •"the government of Nicaragua will never
negotiate" with the anti-Sandinista rebels.
In calling for the ceasefire and negotiations.
Reagan urged Congress to release $14 million in
aid to the rebels. Congress refused last year to ap
propriate any more money to support them.
"While the ceasefire offer is on the table. I
pledge these funds will not be used for arms or
munitions," Reagan said. He said the money would
pay for food, clothing, medicine and "other support
for survival."
His proposal represented a new strategy in the
face of overwhelming congressional opposition to
military aid for the rebels fighting the Nicaraguan
government. But one Democratic congressional
leader called Reagan's statement "old wine in new
bottles."
A ceasefire proposal by Nicaraguan opposition
groups sets April 20 as the deadline for the govern
ment to agree to peace talks. The Sandinistas have
rejected the offer, and Reagan asked the rebels to
extend it until June 1.
Reagan said the "communists in Nicaragua have
turned, at least up until now. a cold shoulder to ap
peals for national reconciliation from the pope and
the Nicaraguan bishops. And we know that without
incentives, none of this will change."
"I am calling upon both sides to lay down their
arms and accept the offer of church-mediated talks
on internationally supervised elections and an end
to repression right now in place against the church,
the press and individual rights." Reagan said.
"But peace negotiations must not become a

cover for deception and delay." he said, adding that
if there is no agreement within 60 days of the
beginning of talks, he would lift all restrictions on
U.S. funds "unless both sides ask me not to."
A statement issued by the Nicaraguan Embassy
in Washington said, "The president's plan is but
another public relations manuever to secure more
U.S. tax dollars for the contra revolutionary
forces" that it said are controlled by former mem
bers of deposed dictator Anastasio Somoza's na
tional guard.
"The government of Nicaragua will never
negotiate with this CIA-created group. They are
guilty of the most atrocious crimes against the
Nicaraguan people." the statement said.
After announcing his proposal. Reagan met in
the evening with three Nicaraguan opposition
leaders — Arturo Cruz. Adolfo Calero and Al
fonso Robelo. They accepted Reagan's suggestion
for an extension until June 1 in their deadline for
the Sandinistas to accept peace talks.
"The ball is in the Sandinista park now and we're
waiting for an answer from them." said Calero.
leader of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, the
largest rebel group.
Asked what would happen if the proposal is
rejected, Calero replied. "Then the situation in
Nicaragua will have to be settled by the force of
arms, by diplomacy and by political give and take."
White House deputy press secretary Robert Sims
said the president would speak on behalf of the
proposal April 15. a day after he returns from a 10-
day California vacation, at a Nicaraguan Refugee
Fund dinner.
The president ainnounced his initiative from the
podium of the White House briefing room, calling
his offer as "a proposal for peace in Central
America that can enable liberty and democracy to
prevail in this troubled region and that can protect
the security of our own borders, economy and
people."

Regardless of whether Congress approves the
rebel funds. Reagan said. "We're not going to quit
and walk away from them, no matter what hap
pens."
Reagan submitted his plan to Congress in a clas
sified report Wednesday night, with no public an
nouncement of its transmission. White House
spokesman Larrv Speakes predicted the plan would
dissolve congressional opposition to the release of
the funds.
"I think they will look at it in a different light at
the end of this dav," he said.
But Rep. Thomas Foley (D-Wash.), the House
majority whip, said Reagan's proposal was "old
wine in new bottles.
"I can't imagine a member of Congress opposed
to this in the past being persuaded that this is any
thing different." he said.
Foley added that he expects the votes on
Reagan's request to be "very close."
With Reagan's report in hand. Republican con
gressional leaders were free to introduce resolu
tions in the House and Senate seeking the monev.
Such a resolution was introduced yesterday in
the Senate, where a vote was scheduled April 23.
House GOP leaders did not introduce a companion
resolution \esterday, but Foley said the introduc
tion should come April 15 when Congress returns
from its Easter-Passo-.er recess, leading to a vote
later this month.
Congress cut off aid for the rebels last vear. but
left an opening for the administration to seek the
money again. Both the House and Senate must ap
prove the resolution in order for the funds to be
released.
Reagan has been warned repeated!) by congres
sional allies that he lacks the votes to win under
cover aid for the rebels, also known as "contras."
House Minority Leader Robert Michel (R-Ill.) said
Wednesdas that aid for the rebels "de->d the
water."

released.

WASHINGTON — President Reagan called
yesterday for a ceasefire and peace negotiations in
Nicaragua and warned that he would seek a re
sumption of military aid to rebel forces if the ruling
leftists do not agree to a settlement within 60 days
after opening negotiations.
Nicaragua promptly rejected Reagan's plan, ter
ming it a "public relations manuever" and vowing
that •"the government of Nicaragua will never
negotiate" with the anti-Sandinista rebels.
In calling for the ceasefire and negotiations.
Reagan urged Congress to release $14 million in
aid to the rebels. Congress refused last year to ap
propriate any more money to support them.
"While the ceasefire offer is on the table. I
pledge these funds will not be used for arms or
munitions," Reagan said. He said the money would
pay for food, clothing, medicine and "other support
for survival."
His proposal represented a new strategy in the
face of overwhelming congressional opposition to
military aid for the rebels fighting the Nicaraguan
government. But one Democratic congressional
leader called Reagan's statement "old wine in new
bottles."
A ceasefire proposal by Nicaraguan opposition
groups sets April 20 as the deadline for the govern
ment to agree to peace talks. The Sandinistas have
rejected the offer, and Reagan asked the rebels to
extend it until June 1.
Reagan said the "communists in Nicaragua have
turned, at least up until now. a cold shoulder to ap
peals for national reconciliation from the pope and
the Nicaraguan bishops. And we know that without
incentives, none of this will change."
"I am calling upon both sides to lay down their
arms and accept the offer of church-mediated talks
on internationally supervised elections and an end
to repression right now in place against the church,
the press and individual rights." Reagan said.
"But peace negotiations must not become a

cover for deception and delay." he said, adding that
if there is no agreement within 60 days of the
beginning of talks, he would lift all restrictions on
U.S. funds "unless both sides ask me not to."
A statement issued by the Nicaraguan Embassy
in Washington said, "The president's plan is but
another public relations manuever to secure more
U.S. tax dollars for the contra revolutionary
forces" that it said are controlled by former mem
bers of deposed dictator Anastasio Somoza's na
tional guard.
"The government of Nicaragua will never
negotiate with this CIA-created group. They are
guilty of the most atrocious crimes against the
Nicaraguan people." the statement said.
After announcing his proposal. Reagan met in
the evening with three Nicaraguan opposition
leaders — Arturo Cruz. Adolfo Calero and Al
fonso Robelo. They accepted Reagan's suggestion
for an extension until June 1 in their deadline for
the Sandinistas to accept peace talks.
"The ball is in the Sandinista park now and we're
waiting for an answer from them." said Calero.
leader of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, the
largest rebel group.
Asked what would happen if the proposal is
rejected, Calero replied. "Then the situation in
Nicaragua will have to be settled by the force of
arms, by diplomacy and by political give and take."
White House deputy press secretary Robert Sims
said the president would speak on behalf of the
proposal April 15. a day after he returns from a 10-
day California vacation, at a Nicaraguan Refugee
Fund dinner.
The president ainnounced his initiative from the
podium of the White House briefing room, calling
his offer as "a proposal for peace in Central
America that can enable liberty and democracy to
prevail in this troubled region and that can protect
the security of our own borders, economy and
people."

Regardless of whether Congress approves the
rebel funds. Reagan said. "We're not going to quit
and walk away from them, no matter what hap
pens."
Reagan submitted his plan to Congress in a clas
sified report Wednesday night, with no public an
nouncement of its transmission. White House
spokesman Larrv Speakes predicted the plan would
dissolve congressional opposition to the release of
the funds.
"I think they will look at it in a different light at
the end of this dav," he said.
But Rep. Thomas Foley (D-Wash.), the House
majority whip, said Reagan's proposal was "old
wine in new bottles.
"I can't imagine a member of Congress opposed
to this in the past being persuaded that this is any
thing different." he said.
Foley added that he expects the votes on
Reagan's request to be "very close."
With Reagan's report in hand. Republican con
gressional leaders were free to introduce resolu
tions in the House and Senate seeking the monev.
Such a resolution was introduced yesterday in
the Senate, where a vote was scheduled April 23.
House GOP leaders did not introduce a companion
resolution \esterday, but Foley said the introduc
tion should come April 15 when Congress returns
from its Easter-Passo-.er recess, leading to a vote
later this month.
Congress cut off aid for the rebels last vear. but
left an opening for the administration to seek the
money again. Both the House and Senate must ap
prove the resolution in order for the funds to be
released.
Reagan has been warned repeated!) by congres
sional allies that he lacks the votes to win under
cover aid for the rebels, also known as "contras."
