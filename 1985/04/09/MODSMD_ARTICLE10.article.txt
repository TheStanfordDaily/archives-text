Bush pushes budget
WASHINGTON — While President Reagan
relaxes at his California ranch, Vice President
George Bush is attempting this week to sell a new
deficit-reduction plan to Congress and the
country.
"The concern was just that we maintain the ad
ministration's momentum in pushing this budget
compromise and the vice president is here and on
the scene and the natural one to do that," said
Marlin Fitzwater, Bush's spokesman.
Bush began the week yesterday morning run
ning a meeting with other White House officials
and representatives of 10 business groups to
outline the plan for $52 billion in spending cuts
that Reagan and senior Republican senators
agreed on last week. The plan would reduce next
year's projected budget deficit to $175 billion.
"They were preaching to the choir," said Dirk
Van Dongen, president of the National Associa
tion of Wholesaler-Distributors. "We think it is a
very heroic package, as somebody characterized
it during the meeting, and we are going to sup
port it right down the line."
Alexander Trowbridge, president of the Na
tional Association of Manufacturers, said, "By
and large, I think the message that the business
community had was 'well done,' and we're going
to be as supportive as we can to see that the kind
of credible downward slide on this deficit gets put
in place."
AIDS test approved
WASHINGTON — A California firm's test to
find indirect evidence of the virus believed to
cause the deadly disease AIDS was approved
yesterday by the Food and Drug Administration
— the third such test to gain government bless-

The agency approved the commercial screen
ing test developed by Litton Bionetics, a division
of Litton Industries, Inc., of Beverly Hills, Calif.
The test, similar to two others previously ap
proved, is designed to screen blood and other
substances for antibodies to the suspected virus.
The newly approved test, as well as the others
by Abbott Laboratories of North Chicago and
Electro-Nucleonics, Inc., of Fairfield, N.J., uses
an inactivated or killed AIDS virus at one stage
to attract antibodies that might be present in the
blood.
Apartheid protests
NEW YORK — With folk singer Pete Seeger
leading them in song, hundreds of Columbia Uni
versity students continued yesterday to protest
the school's ties to South Africa and defied or
ders to stop barricading a campus building.
Faculty members organized in support of the
students, and threatened to begin holding classes
off campus to protest the university's South
African investments and its handling of the stu
dent demonstration.
Meanwhile, seven students who had been on a
hunger strike since March 25 agreed to end their
fast after five of them met with Columbia Presi
dent Michael Sovern for one-and-one-half hours
last night.
One of the fasting students, a South African,
required treatment at a hospital after fainting on
Monday, and another of the original seven
hunger strikers resumed eating Sunday on doc
tor's orders.
Alien haven proposed
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — Illegal aliens from
Central America and Haiti who claim they are
political refugees would get moral and other sup

port from this university city under a proposal
before the council yesterday.
Under the resolution, city agencies and
employees would not cooperate with federal el
forts to expel the estimated 5,000 illegal im
migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala and Haiti
who have fled to Cambridge.
The resolution also would extend city services
to all Cambridge residents, whether or not they
are U.S. citizens. Proponents of the measure say
refugees worried they will be forced to prove
citizenship may not be seeking medical treatment
or education for their children.
One purpose of the resolution is to show sup
port for the refugees, who fear political persecu
tion, torture and death if sent back to their native
countries, said city Councilor Alice Wolf, who
sponsored the measure.
"Many things start at the local level and we
can't wait for the federal government to come
around," she said. "I believe we have an obliga
tion to shelter people who are being persecuted
in other countries."
The proposed resolution is modeled on one
passed in February by city councilors in
Berkeley, said Wolf.
Market slumps
The stock market slumped to a three-week low
yesterday yielding to some afternoon selling after
a weak early advance faded.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
about 3 points in early trading, was off 6.07 at
1,252.98 by the close. That marked a low point
for the average since it finished at 1,249.67 on
March 18.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
dropped off to 79.96 million shares from 86.91
million last Thursday, before the long Easter-
Passover holiday weekend.
