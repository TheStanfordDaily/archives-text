Duke for death penalty
SACRAMENTO — Gov. George Deuk
mejian told a law enforcement conference yester
day that the death penalty is worth using if it
saves "just one victim" of repeat murderers.
Addressing the second annual Governor's
Conference on Crime Victims, Deukmejian
again criticized the California Supreme Court for
its high rate of reversals in death penalty cases
and said public safety "is and shall always be my
greatest goal as a public servant."
"I believe the California Supreme Court
should give great deference to the wishes of our
people and implement capital punishment now,"
Deukmejian said, citing a poll showing 83 per
cent support for the death penalty among Cali
fornia voters.
"As far as I'm concerned, if the death penalty
will save the life of just one innocent person, if it
will save just one victim, then it is a punishment
we must have in California," the Republican
governor added.
Deukmejian cited his administration's budget
increases for victims compensation programs, for
more state law enforcement personnel and for
special child abuse prosecution teams as he

criticized lenient court treatment of criminals.
"We revere a system of justice which protects
the rights of the accused by ensuring them due
process under the law. But isn't it equally com
pelling that we show the same fairness and com
passion to crime victims as well?" he asked.
"Our legal system carries consideration of the
criminal to rather great extremes, while all but ig
noring the rights of the innocent victim."
Bradley running ahead
LOS ANGELES — Tom Bradley looked con
fidently yesterday toward a possible fourth term
as mayor while his chief rival. Councilman John
Ferraro, clung to the hope of forcing a runoff.
With Bradley running comfortably and consis
tently ahead of Ferraro in recent opinion polls,
the real suspense in today's election was in a
volatile city attorney's race. Political sparks flew
when three candidates withdrew in the closing
days of the campaign.
The race was narrowed to two contenders. City
Controller James Kenneth Hahn, 34, the son of
veteran county supervisor Kenneth Hahn; and
attorney Lisa Specht, 39, a one-time Las Vegas

dancer who rose to become a partner in one of
the nation's most prominent law firms.
Street drugs tested

exposed to MPTP, a legal "designer drug" whose
structure is nearly identical to Demerol, said
Chauncey Veatch, director of the state Depart

talized with advanced Parkinson's and another
30 are beginning to exhibit early symptoms after
having injected the synthetic drug, Veatch told
reporters.
