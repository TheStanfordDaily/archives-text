## Lovelorn get help from the love Bug 
### 
It's spring quarter. It's been spring
quarter for several days now. I'm just
beginning to realize the full horror of
that statement.
You should see my box at The
Daily — Mother Hubbard bare. No
one is concerned about potholes or
century-old alums this quarter. In
stead, I get my workload from stu
dents who can't wait for the post of
fice, hut deliver their heartfelt
traumas in person and with great con
viction, pleading insanity even before
they've figured out a way to commit
their favorite crime.
It's the season of the lovelorn, and
111 take the role of emotional adviser
this once mainly because it's spring
quarter and because I understand
their universal dilemma, being guilty
of some derangement myself.
Of course, if I had any lasting solu
tions, I wouldn't be sitting in a
deserted office right now, making
little green letters pop out of a finger
smudged terminal screen.
If you want real wisdom, you
should check the continuing discus
sions on the walls of the womens'
bathrooms at busy places like Meyer;
maybe the guys' too. I don't know
about those, though.
However, if you're stuck in a
lecture and can't conveniently consult
one of these oracles, you might want
to read the questions below. If noth
ing else, they may make you feel bet
ter by comparison.

Dear Bug Me,
Why doesn 7 Charlie Brown just ask
the little redheaded girl out for a date?
- Ari Levitt
Methinks this question is an
evolved species of the traditional "I
have this friend . . formula, but
either way it is a valid problem — not
just for good old Chuck but probably
for everyone's 'friend' at some time
or other.
It's a good thing you didn't ask
about a friend, because there would
be no way I could explain the reasons

for some anonymous person's in
securities.
As it is, there is someone to consult
about the convolutions of Charlie
Brown's emotions and his resulting
predicaments. I'll let Charles Schulz
explain it to you exactly as he wrote it
to me in a short and insightful note.
"Charlie Brown doesn't ask the
little red-haired girl for a date be
cause he is afraid she would laugh in

his face, and as he once said, 'It hurts
when a face gets laughed in.'
"Now, you and I know that this
probably doesn't happen, but that's
because we're not the ones that have
to do the asking. It makes all the dif
ference in the world.
"Charlie Brown, of course, will
realize this 50 years from now when
it's too late."
I should probably leave you with
this sentiment, ready to go forth, take
risks and enjoy 50 years of laugh-free
relationships, but that would not be
representing the gruesome phenome
non of spring quarter accurately.
Read on.
Where do I apply to fall in love?
Can I get academic credit for a suc
cessful relationship? - Forlorn in
Faisan
You sound like a textbook case of
spring-quarter craze, but I'm not sure
that you should rely on textbooks for
a cure.
SCIRE (Student Center for Inno
vation in Research and Education)
might give you credit for the lessons
you learn from love, but it doesn't
have a form that takes your social se
curity number and matches it with a
suitable telephone number. If it did, it
probably wouldn't have been discon
tinued under a restructuring of extra
departmental programs. It would be
profitably advertising in questionable

publications.
Teresa Rodriguez, student co
director of SCIRE, has never heard
of her program giving credit for a sug
gestion like yours, but she encourages
you to make a proposal to the policy
board, anyway.
If the board approves your project,
you will need a faculty sponsor to
help in planning the direction of your
project and your reading lists. You'll
need to put in three hours of research
or analysis a week for each unit of
credit you want to receive.
The standard movie/dinner combo
date would provide that, but you
could go for big credits if you use
your creativity.
SCIRE gives three units of credit
for most of its courses, and no more
than five in all cases. (That's a gruel
ing 15 hours of 'research' every week
for 10 weeks, remember.)
At the end of the quarter you'll
need to write a 15-page research
paper, too.
Rodriguez said that most projects
have to be "pretty academic and spe
cific" even though they are usually
"innovative and can't be placed
within University categories or given
inter-disciplinary status."
From what she said, it sounds like
your successful relationship would
come under the practicum category,
defined as a credit-earning practical
experience.
It being spring quarter, and the last

quarter SCIRE will offer its services,
I wish you luck.
Are techies or fuzzies better lovers?
- Curious in Cardenal
Because I had only one weekend
before deadline on this question, 1
must admit I didn't have time to re
search this answer personally. Maybe
that's something you'll want to do if
my conclusions don't satisfy you.
I'm assuming this is a consumer
advocate-type question and you're
just concerned about getting the most
for your emotional investment.
Of course, if you just want to be
able to quote this column during con
versations with prospectives at parties
as proof that whichever type you are
is the best, I give you full license to
use my name in saying whatever you
like. You need all the help my small
endorsement can provide if you think
it would be a crucial argument in your
favor.
If not, let's consider this analyti
cally. It takes groups of two or more
people to be in love, make love, have
a relationship, etc. in general, but for
this simplified model, we'll assume
only two participants are invloved.
The possibilities for comparison
aren't endless. There can either be
combinations of techie-techie and
fuzzie-fuzzie or the ever-popular
mongrel variety, techie-fuzzie (I
prefer the term fuzzie-techie myself.)

The first option, a techie-techie re
lationship, may provide some inter
esting rendezvous at LOTS, but won't
win any awards in the communication
category.
Likewise, doubling up fuzzies may
be warm and cuddly, but, like most
good things in life, it will probably
leave lint all over your car seats.
The remaining duo, like Oreo
cookies, a cheerleader's oxfords and
yin-yang, provides a kind of
Hallmark-Card harmony of op
posites. The front of the card shows
two hand-holding forms silhouetted
in black against a lipstick red sunset
— and the inside is invitingly blank.
Of course, these are just impres
sions that have very little to do with
the quality these combinations of
people will experience in their rela
tions.
I called Prof. Herant
Katchedourian. who teaches a course
in human sexuality, and he could find
no answer to give me, saying,
"Sometimes the answer is to say the
question doesn't make sense. I don't
know that it (being a better lover) has
anything to do with that (being techie
or fuzzie)."
I hope this doesn't discourage you
from being curious in Cardenal,
anyway.

ing else, they may make you feel bet
ter by comparison.

Dear Bug Me,
Why doesn 7 Charlie Brown just ask
the little redheaded girl out for a date?
- Ari Levitt
Methinks this question is an
evolved species of the traditional "I
have this friend . . formula, but
either way it is a valid problem — not
just for good old Chuck but probably
for everyone's 'friend' at some time
or other.
It's a good thing you didn't ask
about a friend, because there would
be no way I could explain the reasons

for some anonymous person's in
securities.
As it is, there is someone to consult
about the convolutions of Charlie
Brown's emotions and his resulting
predicaments. I'll let Charles Schulz
explain it to you exactly as he wrote it
to me in a short and insightful note.
"Charlie Brown doesn't ask the
little red-haired girl for a date be
cause he is afraid she would laugh in

his face, and as he once said, 'It hurts
when a face gets laughed in.'
"Now, you and I know that this
probably doesn't happen, but that's
because we're not the ones that have
to do the asking. It makes all the dif
ference in the world.
"Charlie Brown, of course, will
realize this 50 years from now when
it's too late."
I should probably leave you with
this sentiment, ready to go forth, take
risks and enjoy 50 years of laugh-free
relationships, but that would not be
representing the gruesome phenome
non of spring quarter accurately.
Read on.
Where do I apply to fall in love?
Can I get academic credit for a suc
cessful relationship? - Forlorn in
Faisan
You sound like a textbook case of
spring-quarter craze, but I'm not sure
that you should rely on textbooks for
a cure.
SCIRE (Student Center for Inno
vation in Research and Education)
might give you credit for the lessons
you learn from love, but it doesn't
have a form that takes your social se
curity number and matches it with a
suitable telephone number. If it did, it
probably wouldn't have been discon
tinued under a restructuring of extra
departmental programs. It would be
profitably advertising in questionable

publications.
Teresa Rodriguez, student co
director of SCIRE, has never heard
of her program giving credit for a sug
gestion like yours, but she encourages
you to make a proposal to the policy
board, anyway.
If the board approves your project,
you will need a faculty sponsor to
help in planning the direction of your
project and your reading lists. You'll
need to put in three hours of research
or analysis a week for each unit of
credit you want to receive.
The standard movie/dinner combo
date would provide that, but you
could go for big credits if you use
your creativity.
SCIRE gives three units of credit
for most of its courses, and no more
than five in all cases. (That's a gruel
ing 15 hours of 'research' every week
for 10 weeks, remember.)
At the end of the quarter you'll
need to write a 15-page research
paper, too.
Rodriguez said that most projects
have to be "pretty academic and spe
cific" even though they are usually
"innovative and can't be placed
within University categories or given
inter-disciplinary status."
From what she said, it sounds like
your successful relationship would
come under the practicum category,
defined as a credit-earning practical
experience.
It being spring quarter, and the last

quarter SCIRE will offer its services,
I wish you luck.
Are techies or fuzzies better lovers?
- Curious in Cardenal
Because I had only one weekend
before deadline on this question, 1
must admit I didn't have time to re
search this answer personally. Maybe
that's something you'll want to do if
my conclusions don't satisfy you.
I'm assuming this is a consumer
advocate-type question and you're
just concerned about getting the most
for your emotional investment.
Of course, if you just want to be
able to quote this column during con
versations with prospectives at parties
as proof that whichever type you are
is the best, I give you full license to
use my name in saying whatever you
like. You need all the help my small
endorsement can provide if you think
it would be a crucial argument in your
favor.
If not, let's consider this analyti
cally. It takes groups of two or more
people to be in love, make love, have
a relationship, etc. in general, but for
this simplified model, we'll assume
only two participants are invloved.
The possibilities for comparison
aren't endless. There can either be
combinations of techie-techie and
fuzzie-fuzzie or the ever-popular
mongrel variety, techie-fuzzie (I
prefer the term fuzzie-techie myself.)

The first option, a techie-techie re
lationship, may provide some inter
esting rendezvous at LOTS, but won't
win any awards in the communication
category.
Likewise, doubling up fuzzies may
be warm and cuddly, but, like most
good things in life, it will probably
leave lint all over your car seats.
The remaining duo, like Oreo
cookies, a cheerleader's oxfords and
yin-yang, provides a kind of
Hallmark-Card harmony of op
posites. The front of the card shows
two hand-holding forms silhouetted
in black against a lipstick red sunset
— and the inside is invitingly blank.
Of course, these are just impres
sions that have very little to do with
the quality these combinations of
people will experience in their rela
tions.
I called Prof. Herant
Katchedourian. who teaches a course
in human sexuality, and he could find
no answer to give me, saying,
"Sometimes the answer is to say the
question doesn't make sense. I don't
know that it (being a better lover) has
anything to do with that (being techie
or fuzzie)."
I hope this doesn't discourage you
from being curious in Cardenal,
anyway.

It's spring quarter. It's been spring
quarter for several days now. I'm just
beginning to realize the full horror of
that statement.
You should see my box at The
Daily — Mother Hubbard bare. No
one is concerned about potholes or
century-old alums this quarter. In
stead, I get my workload from stu
dents who can't wait for the post of
fice, hut deliver their heartfelt
traumas in person and with great con
viction, pleading insanity even before
they've figured out a way to commit
their favorite crime.
It's the season of the lovelorn, and
111 take the role of emotional adviser
this once mainly because it's spring
quarter and because I understand
their universal dilemma, being guilty
of some derangement myself.
Of course, if I had any lasting solu
tions, I wouldn't be sitting in a
deserted office right now, making
little green letters pop out of a finger
smudged terminal screen.
If you want real wisdom, you
should check the continuing discus
sions on the walls of the womens'
bathrooms at busy places like Meyer;
maybe the guys' too. I don't know
about those, though.
However, if you're stuck in a
lecture and can't conveniently consult
one of these oracles, you might want
to read the questions below. If noth
ing else, they may make you feel bet
ter by comparison.
