## The 						Stanford Daily Understanding hunger 
### 
A few days ago radio stations around the world
simultaneously broadcast the song "We are the
World" by the American group U.S.A. for
Africa. Even Air Force One tuned in for the
president to hear the song. Yesterday in White
Plaza, the song was played to herald the opening
rally of the conference on hunger. But a large
number of Stanford students chose not to listen.
We can't figure out why. The conference has
been well planned, addresses essential topics,
comes early in the quarter, includes interesting
speakers and is held on campus.
Frankly, the opportunity to hear and interact
with some of the foremost experts from around
the country — and from our own campus —
shouldn't be missed.
The conference is appropriate in all possible
ways. Stanford is one of the most prestigious edu
cational institutions in the world, and the focus of
this conference is to educate the community on
different aspects of hunger in the United States
and abroad. Awareness of the issue of hunger is
greater than ever before, and a day doesn't pass
without the media reporting relief efforts by com
munities across the United States. Yet there is
little understanding of the more complex issues of
hunger in the world. The Stanford conference
hopes to address them without insulting the intel
ligence of the community.
The organizers of "You Can Make a Differ
ence: On Hunger" have put together an impres

sive array of experts in all areas of the hunger
issue, including everyone from widely respected
university professors and the most visible U.S.
senator on hunger issues to leaders of interna
tional relief agencies.
The conference even provides for the most
pre-professional leanings on campus. The confer
ence not only is meant to raise awareness and un
derstanding, but also aims to help members of the
community learn about possible involvement
beyond financial donations. A number of profes
sionals in hunger-related fields have donated
their time to explain opportunities for careers in
hunger relief. In addition, a hunger fair is
planned for Thursday and is scheduled to include
organizations open for involvement by students
now, after graduation and for the rest of their
lives.
No one can deny that hunger is one of the most
important issues of our time. It cuts boundaries of
political orientation, geography, race and class.
We all have the responsibility to learn, and this
conference is one of the easiest and most interest
ing ways of doing it.
So take a break from your studies and your
suntans this week. Go to the hunger fair, attend a
few of the daily panel discussions, participate in a
dorm presentation or workshop. Take advantage
of the opportunity to become aware of the
hunger situation. There is little that is more im
portant.
