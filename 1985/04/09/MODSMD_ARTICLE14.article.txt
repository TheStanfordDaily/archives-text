Consenting players
The present excitement over the
impending visit of a Playboy photog
rapher will be remembered — if at
all! — as the great non-issue of the
year. I can't imagine that any mem
ber of the Stanford community
would really presume to dictate what
sort of photographs her neighbors
might look at, take or pose for.
I find it particularly perplexing
that so many of Playboy's opponents
are solid defenders of gay rights. The
fundamental issue is, after all, the
same — the right of consenting
adults to do what they please in
private. j
It is to the protesters' credit that
they have expressed their dissent
entirely through legitimate channels.
Still, the sweeping illogic of their
position makes it clear that their
reaction is more emotionally than
rationally based. Well-meaning
people have allowed aesthetic dis
taste to provoke them into attempt
ing what calmer reflection will show
to be an unwarranted intrusion into
the rights of others.

Civil rights leaders
I write this letter in response to
Jason Matherly's column (The Daily,
April 3) titled, "Pendleton is a true
civil rights leader." The type of
opinions expressed by Matherly
struck me as truly representative of
views held by the many young
professionals who are taking control
of the social, economic and political
destiny of America today.
No wonder Matherly supports
Pendleton, Reagan's civil rights
commissioner; this man does not
"undermine the credibility of those
who have diligently worked to
achieve positions of prominence" or
"subtly deny them the respect they
and all achievers deserve." Perhaps
this is the first civil rights leader who
hasn't asked Matherly to recognize
the fallacies of "self-reliance" and

"individual responsibility."
With an individual like Pendleton
in office, we may comfortably attri
bute the failure of blacks to attain
equal status in our society to their
inherent inadequacies, rather than
considering more insidious causes.
We may dismiss "the generic par
roters of old and tired rhetoric and
relentless pushers of failed pro
grams" without compunction, along
with the many problems such people
and programs attempt to address.
What a relief! This guy Pendleton
sure is courageous. Thank goodness
he has forced himself to say exactly
what all those daring Reagan sup
porters have said all along. What
Jason forgets is that the problems
existing in 1960s have followed us
into the 1980s. Those blacks have
not gotten what's coming to them.
Until more people in America,
minorities especially, have housing,
gainful employment and political
power, we must reject "leaders"
such as Pendleton. We must learn
from"the obvious and utter failures
of social legislation" in the past in
order to write successful legislation
for the future. With an attitude like
Matherly's, the existing injustices
will not only survive, they will thrive.

Flights of fantasy
It is perhaps to be expected that
the columnists of a student newspa
per may not always be as realistic as
their counterparts in the real press,
but the two flights of fantasy on your
April 2 Opinions page would never
theless have been more suitable for
the April Fools' Day edition.
Stephen Debenham's column,
"Sandinistas threaten U.S. national
security," was characterized by so
many deliberate omissions and basic
inaccuracies that it would take an
other article of the same length to
correct them all.
However, as an Irish student at
Stanford, I feel a moral obligation to
reply to Ronald Hilton's simplistic

attack on Irish neutrality in "The
Irish goose and the Texan gander."
Ireland is bne of a considerable
number of small, enlightened
countries which refuse to play a role
in the military plans of either the
Soviet Union or the United States,
because they believe, unlike Presi
dent Reagan and Soviet leader Mik
hail Gorbachev, that building more
missiles cannot possibly further the
cause of peace. Ireland's small
volunteer army is devoted to anti
terrorist work in Northern Ireland
and U.N. peacekeeping activities in
Lebanon and Cyprus.
For the president of the California
Institute of International Studies,
Hilton shows a remarkable lack of
knowledge of international affairs.
He refers to "Irish leaders like Lenin
Prize-winning Moscow favorite Sean
Macßride"; Macßride has not been
an Irish leader since the 19505, he
holds the Nobel Peace Prize, and is
an internationally respected U.N.
official. Hilton talks of demands for
an end to the use of plastic bullets by
police in Northern Ireland "so that
the IRA can use their real bullets
with more impunity"; the Northern
Irish police uses plastic bullets, not
against IRA terrorists, but against
unarmed demonstrators, several of
whom have been killed by these
weapons. However, it is in his final
paragraph that Hilton reveals his
true attitude to things international:
"And, Reagan, since you have
enough clout to push the MX
through Congress, tell Ireland to join
NATO and place some missiles
there."
The people of the United States
elected Reagan; the people of
Ireland elect their own sovereign
government. Missile sites may go
down well in Montana and
Wyoming, but it'll be a long time
before you see an MX silo in Blarney
Castle; we are not yet the 51st state.
