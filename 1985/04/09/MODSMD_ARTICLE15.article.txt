# Get students off the gravy train
## 
### 
Too many people liked my last column. It was on
how to cut the military budget. All over campus,
people would walk up to me to tell me they liked
the column. I think I have a remedy.
Today, I would like to make the argument for
ending government aid to students. I am con
centrating on aid to students because probably a
better case could be made for it than could be made
for giving taxpayers money directly to educational
institutions or professors.
The subject of aid to students is in the news be
cause the proposed Reagan administration budget
reduces the amount of aid available to those from
upper-income families and would set a ceiling on
the amount of aid any individual student could
receive. The squawking and squealing has been
something to hear.
The Reagan budget proposes to save $2.3 billion
by more tightly focusing federal student financial
aid. Students whose family incomes were more
than $25,000 would be eligible only for subsidized
guaranteed student loans. They would no longer be
eligible for Pell grants and work-study programs.
No federally subsidized loans would be granted
to students with family incomes exceeding $32,500.
No student would get more than $4,000 in federal
aid; but all students — whatever their family
income — would continue to be eligible for $4,000
federally guaranteed (but not directly subsidized)
loans.
Despite all the squawking and squealing —
mostly from bankers and from college administra
tors, who don't want to have student-customers
who have to spend tuition dollars carefully — sup
port for the Reagan budget proposal has come
from a number of liberals.
This liberal support (for example, from the New
Republic magazine and in the Palo Alto area from
liberal Democratic activist Hal Plotkin) is to be ex

pected since the Reagan proposal cuts welfare for
the rich and concentrates spending on somewhat
less affluent students.
In 1984, approximately 7,000 college students
from families with incomes of more than $100,000
were granted subsidized guaranteed loans.
The squawking and squealing by the rich and
their beneficiaries is having some effect. It cur-

rently appears as if Congress, with the Reagan ad
ministration's concurrence, will raise the cut-off for
aid eligibility from the administration's current
proposal of $32,500 in family income to $60,000.
This would continue aid to those from families ear
ning less than $60,000 a year. In addition, it ap
pears that the ceiling on total aid per student will be
raised from $4,000 to $8,000.
The guaranteed loan element in the student-aid
program has long been recognized by economists as
a bonanza for the banks. At present, the govern
ment pays an annual 3.5 percent special allowance
to banks on the unpaid balance for the life of the
loan. The federal government also pays the main
interest payment, at present 8 percent, while the
student is in college. For fiscal 1985, the special al
lowance alone will amount to a $1.5 billion subsidy
to the bankers.
The federal government will hand out $13.3 bil
lion in student aid this year. This is an increase of

1,300 percent since 1969.
The current aid package dates back to the Carter
administration. At that time, politicians and
bureaucrats, who were terrified at the prospect of
tuition tax credits, decided to offer increased aid to
upper-income college students. Giving a bone to
the rich collegians split up a potential winning coal
ition that was calling for tax credits for elementary,
secondary and higher education.
As a result of this political wheeling and dealing,
more than half of the students at the average
private college are on the welfare gravy train —
and the pressure to enact tuition tax credits has
been noticeably reduced.
The fact is that there are no important student
aid problems that could not be better handled by
repealing all federal student aid and instituting a
program of tuition tax credits for all who contribute
to the support of a student's education. Allowing
wealthy individuals and companies to obtain credits
for contributions to scholarship funds would ensure
the existence of scholarship money available to stu
dents from poor families.
Tuition tax credits at the college as well as the
elementary and secondary level would allow
families to keep their own money to spend on edu
cation. Such a program would provide a clear in
centive for tight-fisted care in spending money on
tuition.
This does not mean that there would be no role
for part-time jobs or loans in financing a college
education. But jobs should be real, productive
ones, not creatures of federal subsidies. And stu
dents, whose future income will be high because of
their college educations, should pay the full cost of
loans.
Let's get students off the gravy train.

loan. The federal government also pays the main
interest payment, at present 8 percent, while the
student is in college. For fiscal 1985, the special al
lowance alone will amount to a $1.5 billion subsidy
to the bankers.
The federal government will hand out $13.3 bil
lion in student aid this year. This is an increase of

1,300 percent since 1969.
The current aid package dates back to the Carter
administration. At that time, politicians and
bureaucrats, who were terrified at the prospect of
tuition tax credits, decided to offer increased aid to
upper-income college students. Giving a bone to
the rich collegians split up a potential winning coal
ition that was calling for tax credits for elementary,
secondary and higher education.
As a result of this political wheeling and dealing,
more than half of the students at the average
private college are on the welfare gravy train —
and the pressure to enact tuition tax credits has
been noticeably reduced.
The fact is that there are no important student
aid problems that could not be better handled by
repealing all federal student aid and instituting a
program of tuition tax credits for all who contribute
to the support of a student's education. Allowing
wealthy individuals and companies to obtain credits
for contributions to scholarship funds would ensure
the existence of scholarship money available to stu
dents from poor families.
Tuition tax credits at the college as well as the
elementary and secondary level would allow
families to keep their own money to spend on edu
cation. Such a program would provide a clear in
centive for tight-fisted care in spending money on
tuition.
This does not mean that there would be no role
for part-time jobs or loans in financing a college
education. But jobs should be real, productive
ones, not creatures of federal subsidies. And stu
dents, whose future income will be high because of
their college educations, should pay the full cost of
loans.
Let's get students off the gravy train.
