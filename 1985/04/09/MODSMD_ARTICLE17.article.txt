# Selflessness cannot exist even cloaked as altruism
## 
### 
I want to discuss two experiences I've had that have
served as allegories for me over the past couple of years.
The first happened in Italy two summers ago. I was
walking alone in Venice when I encountered a beggar on
one of the side streets. He was covered in two layers of
dirt, but he was no more than 30.1 automatically opened
my wallet, thinking, "I'm so much better off than this
man; the least I can do is give him the rest of my change."
However, when I looked in my change pocket, I found
only a 50-lire piece, the equivalent of five cents. I was dis
appointed that I had so little to give to the beggar, but I
dropped the coin in his metal pan, thinking, "Well, it can
still go toward buying him a bread roll, and it's still better
than giving him nothing."
My 50-lire actually bought more than I thought it
would. I had walked to a stone fountain about 50 feet
away from where the beggar
was sitting when I turned
around to look at him. Once
he had caught my attention,
he put the coin on his tongue,
stuck it out so that I could see
the metal, swallowed it, and
gestured at me in the Italian
equivalent of "Fuck you." In
my meager yet earnest self
lessness, I found myself ac
costed by this man's pride.
Initially I didn't understand
the beggar's reaction. Instead
I was incensed because he responded to me in a way that I
hadn't expected. It wasn't so much that I believed my
generosity was so great; I figured that 100 American
tourists speaking in loud accents had passed him before,
each throwing in his pan 100 lire and each posturing as the
epitome of altruism. Still, I thought this beggar would act
differently. Then I wondered how I did expect him to act,
and finally I realized that I hadn't expected him to act in
any particular fashion. Instead I had lumped him into one
dirty group known as "beggars" that solely existed so that
I could give them money and forget about them. Since this
man had forced me to acknowledge him as an individual
rather than a member of my nebulous grouping, I wasn't
able to forget about him the way I had with other beggars.
I began to wonder what motive really caused me to give
him the money in the first place.
Because I had seen my action as basically altruistic, I
looked up "altruism" in the American Heritage Diction
ary, my pocket source of knowledge. It defined the word
as the "selfless concern for the welfare of others." I
agreed that I was concerned for the welfare of this man;

otherwise, I wouldn't have given him the last of mj
money. What I did question for the first time was the idea
of selflessness. Did I forget about myself for the minute il
took me to open my wallet and drop the coin in his pan?
Did I give up my paltry 50 lire with no expectations?
The answers to both these questions (which really are
the same question) were no. I did not forget that I existed
for that particular minute precisely because I did expect to
gain some sort of benefit — in the same way had 1 spent
my money on something else. In this case the benefit I ex
pected to receive was some mild good feeling within
myself for doing the most I could at that moment for
someone less fortunate. The benefit the beggar received
was the opportunity to show a faceless American tourist
that he was at least more than a cheap metal pan filled
with coins. Once I understood my well-intentioned but
nevertheless selfish motive for
giving away the coin, I was
better able to accept and
respect the beggar's reaction.
He did what he thought was
best with the coin just as I did
when I gave it to him. And if
he seemed satisfied with the
results of this transaction, I
believe that eventually -I
received a genuine bargain. J
was certainly more satisfied
with the results once I under
stood the root of my motive
than when I had tried to negate myself under the cloak of
thoughtless altruism. !
All this crude analysis is best summed up for me by an
earlier experience on a Boston subway car. I was headed
toward South Station when an old man sat down next to
me carrying two full grocery bags. He wore three tattered
flannel shirts (it was late fall) and a wool cap that was mis
sing half its brim. I was looking at his hands, which
seemed blown up like balloons, when I noticed that his
two bags were filled entirely with paper products, things
like paper towels and boxes of tissue. I couldn't fathom
why he would spend his money on all these paper prod
ucts when he looked as if he slept on a Kenmore Square
bench every night. While I was staring at his hands and his
paper products, he started singing "I am. I am," until he
got off the subway a few stops later. At first I thought il
was really strange that he would sing those words, but the
more I think about it, the more it seemed natural for him
to have sung it.

the beggar's reaction. Instead
I was incensed because he responded to me in a way that I
hadn't expected. It wasn't so much that I believed my
generosity was so great; I figured that 100 American
tourists speaking in loud accents had passed him before,
each throwing in his pan 100 lire and each posturing as the
epitome of altruism. Still, I thought this beggar would act
differently. Then I wondered how I did expect him to act,
and finally I realized that I hadn't expected him to act in
any particular fashion. Instead I had lumped him into one
dirty group known as "beggars" that solely existed so that
I could give them money and forget about them. Since this
man had forced me to acknowledge him as an individual
rather than a member of my nebulous grouping, I wasn't
able to forget about him the way I had with other beggars.
I began to wonder what motive really caused me to give
him the money in the first place.
Because I had seen my action as basically altruistic, I
looked up "altruism" in the American Heritage Diction
ary, my pocket source of knowledge. It defined the word
as the "selfless concern for the welfare of others." I
agreed that I was concerned for the welfare of this man;

otherwise, I wouldn't have given him the last of mj
money. What I did question for the first time was the idea
of selflessness. Did I forget about myself for the minute il
took me to open my wallet and drop the coin in his pan?
Did I give up my paltry 50 lire with no expectations?
The answers to both these questions (which really are
the same question) were no. I did not forget that I existed
for that particular minute precisely because I did expect to
gain some sort of benefit — in the same way had 1 spent
my money on something else. In this case the benefit I ex
pected to receive was some mild good feeling within
myself for doing the most I could at that moment for
someone less fortunate. The benefit the beggar received
was the opportunity to show a faceless American tourist
that he was at least more than a cheap metal pan filled
with coins. Once I understood my well-intentioned but
nevertheless selfish motive for
giving away the coin, I was
better able to accept and
respect the beggar's reaction.
He did what he thought was
best with the coin just as I did
when I gave it to him. And if
he seemed satisfied with the
results of this transaction, I
believe that eventually -I
received a genuine bargain. J
was certainly more satisfied
with the results once I under
stood the root of my motive
than when I had tried to negate myself under the cloak of
thoughtless altruism. !
All this crude analysis is best summed up for me by an
earlier experience on a Boston subway car. I was headed
toward South Station when an old man sat down next to
me carrying two full grocery bags. He wore three tattered
flannel shirts (it was late fall) and a wool cap that was mis
sing half its brim. I was looking at his hands, which
seemed blown up like balloons, when I noticed that his
two bags were filled entirely with paper products, things
like paper towels and boxes of tissue. I couldn't fathom
why he would spend his money on all these paper prod
ucts when he looked as if he slept on a Kenmore Square
bench every night. While I was staring at his hands and his
paper products, he started singing "I am. I am," until he
got off the subway a few stops later. At first I thought il
was really strange that he would sing those words, but the
more I think about it, the more it seemed natural for him
to have sung it.
