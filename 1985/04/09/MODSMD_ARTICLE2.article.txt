# Greeks begin rush
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
Students hoping to join Greek life
at Stanford flocked to parties at
three fraternities and all six
recognized sororities last night as
the annual spring rush began.
Interfraternity Council represen
tatives said last night that they an
ticipate a slight increase in the num
ber of men rushing fraternities, and
sorority rush organizers said nearly
100 more women are taking part
this year than in 1984.
Kappa Alpha, Alpha Delta Phi
and Zeta Psi each threw parties last
night, and 12 other fraternities will
give their first rush parties later this
week.
Steve Lautzenhiser, co-chairman
of the IFC Rush Committee, said he
is expecting "a larger turnout ini
tially" for rush as "a lot of people
have heard about it." Lautzenhiser
added that he also expects "a little
bit of an increase across the board in
pledges."
"We've really been pumping
rush," said Donald Galles, co
chairman of the rush committee and
president-elect of the IFC. "A lot of
people have worked really hard and
we've been seeing eye to eye with
the University recently. I'm sure it
will go smoothly."

Galles also noted that recent pos
itive press coverage of fraternities
could generate increased interest in
Rush. "There's been some good ar
ticles just recently which have been
helping," Galles said.
According to Lautzenhiser, each
fraternity is allowed to host two
evening parties and one afternoon
gathering during the three weeks of
rush. During the evening parties,
hard liquor may be served only from
7:30-10:30, while beer and wine are
permitted until the parties end at
approximately midnight, he said.
The afternoon parties, held

during the second week of rush,
take place from 2:30-7:30 and
"should be more informational"
than the parties during the first
week, Lautzenhiser said. He added
that no hard drinks are served and
fraternities are encouraged to pro
vide dinner and present a slide show
picturing fraternity activities and
events.
Galles said the IFC party
guidelines devised last-faLL will be
followed, and a special effort will be
made to de-emphasize alcohol as
the focal point of the parties.
"We don't want the emphasis to

be on alcohol," Lautzenhiser con
curred.
Lautzenhiser noted that "a team
of 1FC people will visit each party,"
checking to see that equally attrac
tive, non-alcoholic alternatives are
served and that large quantities of
food are available. He added that
each party will have three
"designated sobers" who will pro
vide rides for those students who
have had too much to drink and are
unable to make it home on their
own.
