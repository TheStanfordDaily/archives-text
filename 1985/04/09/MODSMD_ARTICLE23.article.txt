## But Stanford jumps to No. 1 in national poll Bears end Cardinal's sweep dreams 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
BERKELEY — After a weekend split with California,
the Stanford baseball team's Pacific 10 Southern Division
lead still stood at two games. But the Cardinal's 3-1
record for the week — including two wins over the 12th
ranked Bears — enabled the team to vault past Oklahoma
and Miami-Florida into the No. 1 spot in the nation.
On Saturday, Lance Blankenship kept the Bears within
striking distance of the first-place Cardinal with three hits
and six RBIs, including a two-run ninth-inning homer that
gave Cal a thrilling 10-8 win.
The homer, a hooking shot to left off a 1-2 pitch from
reliever Kevin Kunkel, ruined a stirring Stanford come
back. Down 8-2 after seven innings, the Cardinal had ex
ploded for six runs in the eighth to tie the game.
Cal Coach Bob Milano was proud of his team for not
giving up when Stanford came back. "It was best ex
emplified by watching the guys out of the dugout and
down the line," he said. "They won't quit — just like
Stanford."
As the Cardinal had done in the previous two games,
the Bears jumped out to a lead in the first inning. Dan
Truax walked and moved to second on a passed ball.
Mickey Speck singled Truax to third, but was later picked
off by Stanford starter Jack McDowell. In the ensuing
rundown, Speck was tagged out, but Truax managed to
sneak across the plate.
Stanford took the lead in the fourth with two unearned
runs off Cal starter Will Schock. Ruben Amaro reached
first on an error by Blankenship — about the only thing
the Bear third baseman did wrong all day.
After Rick Lundblade walked, Mike Deßenon drilled
an RBI single to center. An errant throw by center fielder
Tim Jester allowed Lundblade and Deßenon to advance
to second and third. Walt Harris then scored Lundblade
with a groundout.

The Cardinal seemed poised to break the game open in
the fifth, but Schock struck out Mark Davis with runners
at second and third and got Deßenon on a groundout with
the bases loaded. Through the first seven innings, Schock
allowed only three hits and struck out nine. He has yet to
lose this year.
In the sixth, RBI singles by Jester and Blankenship put
Cal ahead 3-2 and finished the day for McDowell. Things
could have been a lot worse for Stanford, but a pickoff
and a failed steal attempt held the Bears to two runs.
It did get a lot worse for the Cardinal in the next inning.
A single by Kevin Maas, a walk to Truax and an inten
tional walk to Aldrete loaded the bases with one out. Lee
Plemel got Weiss to hit a shallow fly ball to left for the
second out, but he then walked Jester to force in a run.
Plemel got ahead of Blankenship 0-2, but his next pitch
was a fastball that Blankenship ripped into the left corner
for a three-run double. "I was looking for him to waste a
pitch or two," Blankenship said. "I was surprised it was
right there."
Jerry Goff followed with a rocket to center that Davis
got to at the fence but dropped for an error that made the
score 8-2 and brought Kunkel in for Plemel. The game
seemed over, but, to borrow a line from Joe Kapp. the
Cardinal did not quit — the Cardinal did not die.
After Lundblade walked and Deßenon singled, Harris
drove an RBI single up the middle. John Ramos' infield
single scored Deßenon, who had advanced on a wild
pitch. John Verducci almost made it 8-7, but his home run
bid just curved foul.
Working cautiously now, Schock uncorked another wild
pitch that scored Harris. With the score now 8-5, Milano
went to his stopper — relief ace Andy Wortham. Wor
tham walked Verducci and gave up an RBI single to
Stanicek. Amaro laid down a textbook bunt to score Har-
