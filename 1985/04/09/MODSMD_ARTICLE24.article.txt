# Stanford recovers to beat UCLA Saturday
## USC serves up loss No. 1 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
Good tennis. There's no other way to describe
the Stanford men's tennis team's matches against
USC and UCLA this weekend.
Stanford came out of the tough competition with
a split, losing to No. 2-ranked USC on Friday, 5-4,
and defeating 4th-ranked UCLA Saturday by the
same score.
Stanford Coach Dick Gould said he was pleased
with some aspects of the weekend's play, but he
saw certain areas, including doubles play, where
improvement is needed.
In February, when Stanford beat USC 6-3 in the
ITCA team championship, doubles competition
was not a factor — the Cardinal won five of six
singles matches to win the title before any doubles
competition even started.
Friday was a different story. The score going into
the doubles competition was 3-3, and Stanford was
put in the position of having to win two doubles
matches against a team with three excellent
doubles pairs.
Gould recently split up Stanford's top team of
Jim Grabb and John Letts to spread the playing tal
ent evenly. But perhaps he spread his players too
thin — USC won both the No. 1 and No. 2 doubles
matches and Stanford suffered its first loss of the
season.
"I like our doubles teams as they are, but they
just need more playing time," Gould said. "By the
end of the year, the teams should be solid."

Gould considers this weekend's matches
"practice matches" for what really counts — the
NCAAs. In that respect, the competition was a
good preparatory experience for all teams in
volved.
"This match couldn't have been closer. Seven of
the nine matches went to three sets," USC Coach
Dick Leach said. "Our matches with Stanford have
usually been very close, but never like this. We
were fortunate to win today," he said.
Leach was pleased that his team performed so
well in the absence of junior Tim Pawsat, who at
32-13, has played in more matches than any other
Trojan this year.
"Tim pulled a groin muscle and will probably be
out for a while. He usually plays No. 4 singles for
us, and last year finished second in the NCAA
doubles championship with Rick (Leach). But we
did it today without him," Leach said.
A bright spot for the Cardinal all weekend was
Dan Goldie. He broke his two-game losing streak
with impressive wins over USCs Todd Witsken, 6-
2, 7-5, and UCLA's Jeff Klaparda, 6-2, 6-0.
Stanford's Jim Grabb and Derrick Rostagno also
played well in their matches against USC's Jorge
Lozano, ranked No. 17, and Rick Leach, son of
USC Coach Dick Leach.
The turning point in the USC match came at No.
6 singles with Pat McEnroe competing against An
tony Emerson. Usually the No. 6 matches receive
minimal attention, but not Friday.
The score in singles matches was Stanford 3,
USC 2. With a win, McEnroe could have put Stan

ford up 4-2 and taken some pressure off the
doubles teams.
McEnroe won the first set, 6-4, and was up 6-2 in
the tiebreaker of the second set, but couldn't win
one of four match points. Emerson won the tie
breaker, 8-6, and the next set, 7-5, to win the
match and tie up the overall match at 3-3.
Tension flared in the third set when McEnroe
made a rare but loud and extended dispute of a
called fault. The crowd supported McEnroe, but
the match points didn't fall Stanford's way. In the
heat of the tiebreaker, Gould turned away after
missed opportunities to bite his thumbnail.
Leach called Emerson's comeback "the greatest
tiebreaker of his life. We slowed (Stanford) down
right there. It's the only thing that kept us in the
match."
A quiet Emerson said it was all luck.
"I was lucky — you have to be lucky — to come
back down 6-2," he said."McEnroe played a good
tiebreaker, but some of my shots just got in, and it
really turned the match around."
Stanford was hurt by two additional lost tie
breakers in the second and third doubles matches.
Playing with Rostagno, McEnroe met and lost to
Emerson again in the No. 2 doubles match, 7-6, 4-
6, 6-4.
Rostagno delivered two unreturnable serves to
tie the third set at 4-4 and bring Stanford up from
its 1-4 game deficit. But the momentum lagged —
volleys began to hit the white tape and stop. Down

Patrick McEnroe doesn't usually dispute umpires' calls, but he did
during his three-set loss to USC's Antony Emerson Friday.
