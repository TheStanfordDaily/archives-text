# Stanford recovers to beat UCLA Saturday
## USC serves up loss No. 1 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
Good tennis. There's no other way to describe
the Stanford men's tennis team's matches against
USC and UCLA this weekend.
Stanford came out of the tough competition with
a split, losing to No. 2-ranked USC on Friday, 5-4,
and defeating 4th-ranked UCLA Saturday by the
same score.
Stanford Coach Dick Gould said he was pleased
with some aspects of the weekend's play, but he
saw certain areas, including doubles play, where
improvement is needed.
In February, when Stanford beat USC 6-3 in the
ITCA team championship, doubles competition
was not a factor — the Cardinal won five of six
singles matches to win the title before any doubles
competition even started.
Friday was a different story. The score going into
the doubles competition was 3-3, and Stanford was
put in the position of having to win two doubles
matches against a team with three excellent
doubles pairs.
Gould recently split up Stanford's top team of
Jim Grabb and John Letts to spread the playing tal
ent evenly. But perhaps he spread his players too
thin — USC won both the No. 1 and No. 2 doubles
matches and Stanford suffered its first loss of the
season.
"I like our doubles teams as they are, but they
just need more playing time," Gould said. "By the
end of the year, the teams should be solid."

Gould considers this weekend's matches
"practice matches" for what really counts — the
NCAAs. In that respect, the competition was a
good preparatory experience for all teams in
volved.
"This match couldn't have been closer. Seven of
the nine matches went to three sets," USC Coach
Dick Leach said. "Our matches with Stanford have
usually been very close, but never like this. We
were fortunate to win today," he said.
Leach was pleased that his team performed so
well in the absence of junior Tim Pawsat, who at
32-13, has played in more matches than any other
Trojan this year.
"Tim pulled a groin muscle and will probably be
out for a while. He usually plays No. 4 singles for
us, and last year finished second in the NCAA
doubles championship with Rick (Leach). But we
did it today without him," Leach said.
A bright spot for the Cardinal all weekend was
Dan Goldie. He broke his two-game losing streak
with impressive wins over USCs Todd Witsken, 6-
2, 7-5, and UCLA's Jeff Klaparda, 6-2, 6-0.
Stanford's Jim Grabb and Derrick Rostagno also
played well in their matches against USC's Jorge
Lozano, ranked No. 17, and Rick Leach, son of
USC Coach Dick Leach.
The turning point in the USC match came at No.
6 singles with Pat McEnroe competing against An
tony Emerson. Usually the No. 6 matches receive
minimal attention, but not Friday.
The score in singles matches was Stanford 3,
USC 2. With a win, McEnroe could have put Stan

ford up 4-2 and taken some pressure off the
doubles teams.
McEnroe won the first set, 6-4, and was up 6-2 in
the tiebreaker of the second set, but couldn't win
one of four match points. Emerson won the tie
breaker, 8-6, and the next set, 7-5, to win the
match and tie up the overall match at 3-3.
Tension flared in the third set when McEnroe
made a rare but loud and extended dispute of a
called fault. The crowd supported McEnroe, but
the match points didn't fall Stanford's way. In the
heat of the tiebreaker, Gould turned away after
missed opportunities to bite his thumbnail.
Leach called Emerson's comeback "the greatest
tiebreaker of his life. We slowed (Stanford) down
right there. It's the only thing that kept us in the
match."
A quiet Emerson said it was all luck.
"I was lucky — you have to be lucky — to come
back down 6-2," he said."McEnroe played a good
tiebreaker, but some of my shots just got in, and it
really turned the match around."
Stanford was hurt by two additional lost tie
breakers in the second and third doubles matches.
Playing with Rostagno, McEnroe met and lost to
Emerson again in the No. 2 doubles match, 7-6, 4-
6, 6-4.
Rostagno delivered two unreturnable serves to
tie the third set at 4-4 and bring Stanford up from
its 1-4 game deficit. But the momentum lagged —
volleys began to hit the white tape and stop. Down

Patrick McEnroe doesn't usually dispute umpires' calls, but he did
during his three-set loss to USC's Antony Emerson Friday.
5-4, McEnroe couldn't hold his serve, and the
Cardinal officially lost its first dual match of
the season.
Stanford came back Saturday with a victory
over UCLA, 5-4. Again, the score in matches
after the outdoor competition was 3-3, but
the Cardinal was able to take the No. 1 singles
and doubles indoor matches for the win.
The indoor matches featured the No. 1 and
No. 2 singles and the No. 1 doubles matches.
Goldie took about 45 minutes to defeat
Klaparda, ranked 12th in the nation, 6-2, 6-0.
Klaparda was consistently passed at the net,
and had difficulty returning Goldie's serves.
Goldie received a standing ovation from the
crowd of about 3,500 in Maples at the end of
the match.
Goldie's and Grabb's 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 win in
the No. 1 doubles match decided the Cardinal
victory. Stanford had most of its trouble with
Michael Kures' serve, but both Cardinal
players fed the ball down the middle and al
leys for winner after winner.
Grabb and Goldie kept their composure
throughout the match, and even though it was
only the second time they had played to

gether, they performed well as a team.
"The tennis in the indoor matches was
phenomenal. I think the tennis you saw was
top-20-in-the-world caliber," Gould said.
"By the end of the year, Dan and Jim should
be a great doubles team. They played reason
ably well against the No. 1 doubles team in
the nation (USC's Witsken and Lozano) and
beat Kures and Basham."
The win partly avenged UCLA's 5-4 vic
tory in the NCAA championship match last
year — a match which was also decided by the
No. 1 doubles competition. Three of the
players who played in that match were out on
the court again Saturday night. Only John
Letts was missing, because he and Grabb have
been broken up experimentally by Gould.
Gould said real revenge will have to wait.
"There's no revenge for a national champion
ship in a practice match. Only one match
counts — only one real match counts, and
that's the NCAA championship."
• ••
In a welcome breather from its tough
weekend competition, the men play San Jose
State here today in their 18th dual match of
the season.
Gould hopes his team can get through this
week's competition injury-free and injury
rested for more tough matches next week
against UCLA and USC.

Gould does not yet have a set lineup for the
match, but he said he would like to play Scott
Moody and Mark Jacobson in singles matches
to keep them in practice. He also wants to
give his injured players — including Goldie
(back pain) and Grabb (pulled groin muscle)
— a break from competition.
Dave Kuhn plays No. 1 singles for San Jose
State. He is 8-9 in that position. Mark
Murphy follows in the No. 2 spot with an 11 -4
dual match record.
Murphy and Kuhn also play No. 1 doubles
together. The No. 2 doubles team consists of
John Vigil and Joel Robison, currently 4-4.
San Jose State placed fourth in February's
Northern California Championship. Stanford
also participated in the event and won the
NorCals for the 19th consecutive time with 39
separate match victories.
Stanford also has home matches against
Arizona State and Arizona Friday and Satur
day. The Cardinal, 3-1 in the Pac-10,
defeated both teams over spring break by
scores of 9-0 and 7-2, respectively.
Against Arizona, Stanford's No. 1 player,
Goldie, lost his first match of the season to
Benji Papal — an unranked freshman. Goldie
appears to have recovered from the loss,
however. He won both of his singles matches
against USC and UCLA in straight sets.

after the outdoor competition was 3-3, but
the Cardinal was able to take the No. 1 singles
and doubles indoor matches for the win.
The indoor matches featured the No. 1 and
No. 2 singles and the No. 1 doubles matches.
Goldie took about 45 minutes to defeat
Klaparda, ranked 12th in the nation, 6-2, 6-0.
Klaparda was consistently passed at the net,
and had difficulty returning Goldie's serves.
Goldie received a standing ovation from the
crowd of about 3,500 in Maples at the end of
the match.
Goldie's and Grabb's 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 win in
the No. 1 doubles match decided the Cardinal
victory. Stanford had most of its trouble with
Michael Kures' serve, but both Cardinal
players fed the ball down the middle and al
leys for winner after winner.
Grabb and Goldie kept their composure
throughout the match, and even though it was
only the second time they had played to

gether, they performed well as a team.
"The tennis in the indoor matches was
phenomenal. I think the tennis you saw was
top-20-in-the-world caliber," Gould said.
"By the end of the year, Dan and Jim should
be a great doubles team. They played reason
ably well against the No. 1 doubles team in
the nation (USC's Witsken and Lozano) and
beat Kures and Basham."
The win partly avenged UCLA's 5-4 vic
tory in the NCAA championship match last
year — a match which was also decided by the
No. 1 doubles competition. Three of the
players who played in that match were out on
the court again Saturday night. Only John
Letts was missing, because he and Grabb have
been broken up experimentally by Gould.
Gould said real revenge will have to wait.
"There's no revenge for a national champion
ship in a practice match. Only one match
counts — only one real match counts, and
that's the NCAA championship."

In a welcome breather from its tough
weekend competition, the men play San Jose
State here today in their 18th dual match of
the season.
Gould hopes his team can get through this
week's competition injury-free and injury
rested for more tough matches next week
against UCLA and USC.

Gould does not yet have a set lineup for the
match, but he said he would like to play Scott
Moody and Mark Jacobson in singles matches
to keep them in practice. He also wants to
give his injured players — including Goldie
(back pain) and Grabb (pulled groin muscle)
— a break from competition.
Dave Kuhn plays No. 1 singles for San Jose
State. He is 8-9 in that position. Mark
Murphy follows in the No. 2 spot with an 11 -4
dual match record.
Murphy and Kuhn also play No. 1 doubles
together. The No. 2 doubles team consists of
John Vigil and Joel Robison, currently 4-4.
San Jose State placed fourth in February's
Northern California Championship. Stanford
also participated in the event and won the
NorCals for the 19th consecutive time with 39
separate match victories.
Stanford also has home matches against
Arizona State and Arizona Friday and Satur
day. The Cardinal, 3-1 in the Pac-10,
defeated both teams over spring break by
scores of 9-0 and 7-2, respectively.
Against Arizona, Stanford's No. 1 player,
Goldie, lost his first match of the season to
Benji Papal — an unranked freshman. Goldie
appears to have recovered from the loss,
however. He won both of his singles matches
against USC and UCLA in straight sets.

Basketball . . . registration . . . and now tennis. Maples Pavilion went through an
other one of its transformations for Saturday night's Stanford-UCLA tennis match.
Good tennis. There's no other way to describe
the Stanford men's tennis team's matches against
USC and UCLA this weekend.
Stanford came out of the tough competition with
a split, losing to No. 2-ranked USC on Friday, 5-4,
and defeating 4th-ranked UCLA Saturday by the
same score.
Stanford Coach Dick Gould said he was pleased
with some aspects of the weekend's play, but he
saw certain areas, including doubles play, where
improvement is needed.
In February, when Stanford beat USC 6-3 in the
ITCA team championship, doubles competition
was not a factor — the Cardinal won five of six
singles matches to win the title before any doubles
competition even started.
Friday was a different story. The score going into
the doubles competition was 3-3, and Stanford was
put in the position of having to win two doubles
matches against a team with three excellent
doubles pairs.
Gould recently split up Stanford's top team of
Jim Grabb and John Letts to spread the playing tal
ent evenly. But perhaps he spread his players too
thin — USC won both the No. 1 and No. 2 doubles
matches and Stanford suffered its first loss of the
season.
"I like our doubles teams as they are, but they
just need more playing time," Gould said. "By the
end of the year, the teams should be solid."

Gould considers this weekend's matches
"practice matches" for what really counts — the
NCAAs. In that respect, the competition was a
good preparatory experience for all teams in
volved.
"This match couldn't have been closer. Seven of
the nine matches went to three sets," USC Coach
Dick Leach said. "Our matches with Stanford have
usually been very close, but never like this. We
were fortunate to win today," he said.
Leach was pleased that his team performed so
well in the absence of junior Tim Pawsat, who at
32-13, has played in more matches than any other
Trojan this year.
"Tim pulled a groin muscle and will probably be
out for a while. He usually plays No. 4 singles for
us, and last year finished second in the NCAA
doubles championship with Rick (Leach). But we
did it today without him," Leach said.
A bright spot for the Cardinal all weekend was
Dan Goldie. He broke his two-game losing streak
with impressive wins over USCs Todd Witsken, 6-
2, 7-5, and UCLA's Jeff Klaparda, 6-2, 6-0.
Stanford's Jim Grabb and Derrick Rostagno also
played well in their matches against USC's Jorge
Lozano, ranked No. 17, and Rick Leach, son of
USC Coach Dick Leach.
The turning point in the USC match came at No.
6 singles with Pat McEnroe competing against An
tony Emerson. Usually the No. 6 matches receive
minimal attention, but not Friday.
The score in singles matches was Stanford 3,
USC 2. With a win, McEnroe could have put Stan

ford up 4-2 and taken some pressure off the
doubles teams.
McEnroe won the first set, 6-4, and was up 6-2 in
the tiebreaker of the second set, but couldn't win
one of four match points. Emerson won the tie
breaker, 8-6, and the next set, 7-5, to win the
match and tie up the overall match at 3-3.
Tension flared in the third set when McEnroe
made a rare but loud and extended dispute of a
called fault. The crowd supported McEnroe, but
the match points didn't fall Stanford's way. In the
heat of the tiebreaker, Gould turned away after
missed opportunities to bite his thumbnail.
Leach called Emerson's comeback "the greatest
tiebreaker of his life. We slowed (Stanford) down
right there. It's the only thing that kept us in the
match."
A quiet Emerson said it was all luck.
"I was lucky — you have to be lucky — to come
back down 6-2," he said."McEnroe played a good
tiebreaker, but some of my shots just got in, and it
really turned the match around."
Stanford was hurt by two additional lost tie
breakers in the second and third doubles matches.
Playing with Rostagno, McEnroe met and lost to
Emerson again in the No. 2 doubles match, 7-6, 4-
6, 6-4.
Rostagno delivered two unreturnable serves to
tie the third set at 4-4 and bring Stanford up from
its 1-4 game deficit. But the momentum lagged —
volleys began to hit the white tape and stop. Down


Jeff Stevens/Daily
Patrick McEnroe doesn't usually dispute umpires' calls, but he did
during his three-set loss to USC's Antony Emerson Friday.
5-4, McEnroe couldn't hold his serve, and the
Cardinal officially lost its first dual match of
the season.
Stanford came back Saturday with a victory
over UCLA, 5-4. Again, the score in matches
after the outdoor competition was 3-3, but
