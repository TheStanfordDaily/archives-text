# Card spikers smash SDSU
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's volleyball team
continued to rewrite the Cardinal
record book Friday night with a
show-up-and-win victory over visit
ing San Diego State, 15-4, 16-14, 15-
10.
The triumph upped Stanford
league mark to 9-7, assuring the
squad its first .500 season. At 22-8
overall, the men have long since
surpassed the season high for total
wins.
Most importantly, Friday's success
cut Stanford's magic number for
making the NCAAs to one game. A
Stanford victory — the fifth-place
Cardinal has two remaining games —
or a Hawaii loss would send Stanford
to the NCAA tournament in Los An
geles later this month. The men's
team has never before been invited to
play in the postseason.
As records fall with every game,
Stanford would appear to be coming
together as a team. After the SDSU
cakewalk, Stanford Co-coach Don
Shaw said: "It's the mark of good
team to not play well and still win."
Stanford's talent simply outclassed
the Aztecs.
Shaw and the rest of the coaching
staff are looking for more, however.
Conceding that his team has been
sharper, Shaw said, "I'm a little dis
appointed with the level of execution
and concentration. The guys weren't
playing their positions and roles as
well as they should have.
"We know we can't play that way
and beat the excellent teams. I'm dis
appointed in that our standards are
higher."
The sloppiness might have been
more a case of an inferior team bring
ing a quality one down to its level.
"We started playing pretty well in the
first game," Shaw said, "but it was
also partly that they really kind of fell
apart."

SDSU Coach Mark Warner echoed
Shaw: "We didn't seem to be men
tally into it. It kind of all started in the
first game when a shot dropped in the
middle of our court while everyone
just stood around. Those kind of
dumb mistakes rub off on your
teammates and drag the whole team
down."
What those dumb mistakes did was
drag the whole game down. Stanford,
as Shaw noted, also played ragged
volleyball. In the end, though, the
Cardinal was a little less ragged than
the Aztecs.
Warner, whose team is now 5-9 in
league and 10-10 overall, couldn't
conceal his dismay: "I'm not saying I
expected to win this, but I thought it
might go five sets."
When the two teams met in late
January, the Cardinal struggled to
escape San Diego with a thrilling five
set victory. Things have changed a
whole lot since then. This time
around, the Aztecs were simply no
match for a matured and improved
Stanford team.
"I just hope our team hasn't given
up with regard to salvaging the
season," Warner said. Stanford's
Shaw can be sure his squad has not
given up on the season. The Card
inal's season has just begun.
Stanford was paced by junior All-
America Jon Root, whose 20 kills
(.487 hitting percentage) led all hit
ters. Junior outside hitter Brett
Monello added 15 kills (.297).
SDSU was led by John Eddo's 10
kills (.310) and senior Eric Barton's
eight (.250). Before the match, Shaw
said he felt that a key would be stop
ping the Eddo-Barton combination.
"Neither one hurt us a whole lot
tonight," Shaw said afterward.
The Cardinal returns to action to
morrow night at 7:30 in Maples
Pavilion as Stanford hosts the defend
ing national champion UCLA Bruins.
