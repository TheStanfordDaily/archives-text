# Netters host No. 16 ASU
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
With the better part of a week
to recover from Wednesday's
near-disaster against California,
the No. 2-ranked Stanford
women's tennis team is back in ac
tion today, hosting 16th-ranked
Arizona State at 1:30 p.m.
"1 think the players are a little
shocked over the Cal match,"
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan
said of the Cardinal's 5-4 victory
over the Bth-ranked Bears. "But
as I've said before, (Cal is) good
and they're capable of doing that.
I'm happy to get out of there with
a 5-4 victory.
"It gave us the opportunity to
win a 5-4 match," he continued.
"That's good for us."
Against Cal, Cardinal senior
Linda Gates was bothered by ten
dinitis in her knee, and she lost at
No. 1 singles and wasn't able to
play doubles. Brennan said Gates
has almost recovered, but won't
play singles and maybe not
doubles today.
All Gates' absence probably will
do is make today's match closer,
but not close enough to cause
alarm. Stanford, 17-1 overall and
8-1 in the WCAA, defeated
Arizona State, 7-2, in Tempe ear
lier this year. And that was with
out sophomore Patty Fendick,
who was sidelined with a knee in
jury.
Arizona State, which hasn't
defeated the Cardinal since 1977,
is led by Sherri Norris, who is
ranked 15th in singles, and Carole
Coparanis, who upset Stanford's
Leigh Anne Eldredge, 7-5, 3-6, 6-
4, the last time the teams met.

Coparanis then teamed with Nor
ris to beat Eldredge and Gates at
No. 1 doubles, 7-6, 6-1.
"They are playing pretty well,"
Brennan said of the Sun Devils.
"They don't seem to be playing
very well at the bottom of the lad
der, though, and that's been our
problem lately. So we match up
with them pretty well."
Brennan's biggest worry today
probably isn't Arizona State, but
that his netters might be looking
past the Sun Devils to this
weekend, when the Cardinal
travels to Austin, Texas, for the
prestigous Longhorn Invitational
tournament. The three-day event
features eight of the nation's top
10 ranked teams, including all of
the top five.
And that means No. 1-ranked
USC — the team that ended Stan
ford's 40-match win streak two
weeks ago — will be there.
Barring upsets, Stanford will
have to defeat No. 5-ranked
Miami-Florida in Friday's first
round and then No. 3-ranked
Texas, the tournament's host, if it
hopes to get a shot at the Trojans
and the tournament title Sunday
afternoon.
Even if the Cardinal doesn't get
that rematch with USC this
weekend, it will get it April 20 at
Stanford in the teams' second
WCAA meeting. A possible
fourth meeting with the Trojans
could come at the NCAA cham
pionships in Oklahoma City May
16-24.
As many as four Cardinal
singles players and two doubles
teams could make a run for those
individual championships.
