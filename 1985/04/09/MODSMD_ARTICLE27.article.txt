# Team sets Stanford course record on Sunday
## Golfers finish 2nd in tourney 
### KEN STEVENS Staff sportswriter 
Having struggled through an often
frustrating mid-season, the Stanford
women golfers nudged a step closer
to realizing their goal of gaining an
NCAA tournament berth yesterday
by finishing second to U.S. Interna
tional University at the California In
tercollegiate in San Jose.
The Cardinal women, ranked No.
13 in the latest national poll, need to
finish in the top 14 in the computer
rankings at the end of the season in
order to qualify for the NCAA tourn
ament. They did nothing to hurt their
chances at the California Intercol
legiate.
Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin said
he believes that his team is in strong
position heading into the final two
tournaments of the season. "For us it
(the California Intercollegiate) was a
major stride toward qualifying for
NCAA," Baldwin said. "After we
won our tournament in the fall (the
Stanford Women's Intercollegiate
Nov. 2-4) we got a little sluggish. But
I feel we're really coming along
now."
At the California Intercollegiate,
USIU came from eight shots back
after Sunday's first round to capture
the championship. USIU's three
round total of 893 was seven shots
better than Stanford. San Jose State
and UCLA tied for third place at 910.
Baldwin was impressed with
USIU's performance. "It's the best
they've ever played as a team," he
said.
The Cardinal looked ready to walk
away with the tournament following a
team and course record 289 in the
first round Sunday at the Stanford
Golf Course. The old course record
of 290 was set by Tulsa in 1983. The
289 was six shots better than any
Stanford women's team had previ
ously shot on the Stanford Golf
Course.
Stanford, however, ballooned to
311 on the first 18 holes yesterday at

San Jose only to recover with an even
300 during the afternoon round.
Baldwin said that the Cardinal
women "beat a couple of significant
foes" in defeating SJSU and UCLA.
The Spartans are currently ranked
No. 2 in the nation and the Bruins are
No. 9.
The individual competition at the
California Intercollegiate came to an
exciting conclusion yesterday with
USIU's Laurette Maritz edging her
teammate Helen Alfredsson and
Stanford's Kathleen McCarthy by
one stroke.
Maritz, a first-team All-American
as a freshman last year, calmly sank a
15-foot putt for par on the 18th hole
to finish at 220 for the tournament.
Moments later, McCarthy, an All-
American herself as a freshman last
year, missed a six-foot putt for birdie
that would have given her a tie for the
championship. She finished with 221,
including an opening-round 68 Sun
day.
Other Stanford scores included
Trish McGonigle and Anna
Oxenstierna at 227, Kathy Kostas at
228, Kay Cornelius at 237 and Step
hanie Kondik at 242.
The Cardinal women have two
tournaments remaining on their
schedule this season. Monday they
open play in the three-day Lady Sun
Devil at Phoenix and on April 24-26
they play again in Phoenix in the
WCAA Championships. If all goes
well for the Cardinal over the next
couple of weeks, the women will play
again May 22-25 in the NCAA cham
pionships at Cape Cod.
Baldwin realizes the importance of
the next two tournaments. "We have
six competitive days left (in the
season)," he said. "We've got to
produce, we've got to play well."
Nevertheless, Baldwin said he is
confident that the team will pull
through. "I really have a good feeling
about the team and they feel good
about themselves," he said.

second.
