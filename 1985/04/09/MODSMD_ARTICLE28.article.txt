# Mixed results for tracksters
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's and women's track teams met with
varied results in this weekend's Texas Relays at the Uni
versity of Texas, the site of this year's NCAA champion
ships.
Cardinal Head Coach Brooks Johnson had mixed reac
tions about the meet. "We have to get mentally tougher
now," he said. "We're in pretty good shape now, but to
make that quantum leap forward, you have to put the
mental with the physical."
"When you combine the two," continued Johnson,
"you can figure out exactly where your deficiencies
are. . . . That's what we need to do now."
Perhaps the biggest winner for the Cardinal was Regina
Jacobs, who won the 1,500-meter race with a time of
4.16.34, the second-fastest time recorded this year in the
women's collegiate ranks. Jacobs has now already
qualified for the NCAAs, which will begin May 31.
The Stanford women also placed well in the 5,000-
meter run — Ellen Lyons, Kathy Smith and Michelle
Mason finished sixth, 10th and 11th, respectively.
Lyons, a senior, recorded a time of 15.55.9, smashing
her previous personal best by 47 seconds. Though pleased
with her overall placing, Lyons said she felt she "went out
a little too quickly" and tired too much by the finish of the
race.
"Brooks said that one girl would try to set a fast pace at
the beginning, and the whole pack followed. ... I think
that first half-mile hurt me at the end," Lyons said.
| The Stanford men's team got its best performance of
the meet from the 4 x 1,500-meter relay team of Brian
Stoll, Mark Olson, Brian Pettingill and Jeff Atkinson. The
four combined to finish second behind Arkansas, des
cribed matter-of-factly by Johnson as "having more tal
ent."
The primary purpose behind Stanford's trip to the
relays, according to Johnson, was to get some exposure to
the track on which the NCAAs will be run this year.
"Some people showed well and some didn't perform as
capably as they could," Johnson said, "but our main rea
son for going was to get some people used to competing
there."
Other strong Cardinal performances were Karen Nick
erson's throw of 173 feet and eight inches the discus, good
for first place. Shotputter Pam Dukes set a new personal
high with a heave of 50 feet and one-quarter inch,
surpasssing the NCAA qualifing throw, and Lisa
Bernhagen cleared five feet and 10 inches for fourth place
in the high jump.
The Cardinal will host Washington and San Diego State
this weekend at the Stanford Stadium track.
