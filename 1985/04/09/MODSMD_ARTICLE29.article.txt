# Softballers still slumping
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER Senior sportswriter 
It went from bad to worse for the Stanford softball team
in Arizona last week. Now the Cardinal is looking to
overcome a hitting slump as well as the hitting of its oppo
nents.
Stanford, which had not scored in four losses this
month, was no-hit by Laura Poole in a 7-0 loss to Arizona
State Friday. The Cardinal broke its scoring streak in the
nightcap against the Sun Devils, but it wasn't enough to
salvage a split. Instead, Stanford lost 8-2, and two losses
to Arizona Saturday dropped the Cardinal's record to 7-
33, 0-8 in the Western Collegiate Athletic Association.
The numerous double-headers — 18 — on Stanford's
schedule this season have resulted in fatigue, especially
for the Cardinal's pitchers, according to Coach Kathy Lin
coln. But there are problems at the plate as well.
"We're all in a hitting slump," Lincoln said. "We don't
have as much confidence as we did at the beginning of the
year. It seems that, no matter how hard we hit the ball,
someone's there."
Except, perhaps, for freshman Maria De La Rosa and
junior Monique Bautista. In the nightcap against Arizona

State, De La Rosa's sixth-inning triple drove in Bautista
and senior Cathy Taft, who had walked before Bautista
got on with a fielder's choice. Bautista also had a second
inning single, one of the Cardinal's three hits behind loser
Betsy Watson (3-18).
Watson also took the first Arizona loss, 6-1, as Stanford
was held to two hits. Again, it was De La Rosa and
Bautista — with a triple and a single, respectively — who
produced the Cardinal's run in the fifth inning. Arizona,
which had a three-run third inning, had 11 hits.
The second game, though, was a standoff. Arizona
scored its runs in the bottom of the eighth, and Stanford
could only score one in the bottom of the extra inning.
According to international softball tiebreaker rules, a
team puts on second base the player who batted last in the
previous inning. For the Cardinal, that was De La Rosa,
who scored on Bautista's double — Stanford's lone hit.
"The difference between the first and second game was
amazing," Lincoln said. "I think Arizona was a little bit
overconfident after the first game."
Stanford, which played six road games Thursday
through Saturday, will play a double-header at San Fran
cisco State today, beginning at 1:30 p.m.
