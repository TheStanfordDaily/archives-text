# Bathroom fliers prompt meeting
## Police, GLAS discuss possible arrests 
### MICHAEL GOFF Editorial staff 
Concerned that Bay Area media
coverage of homosexual trysting sites
in bathrooms at Stanford would force
police to start making arrests and
might attract "homosexuals that tend
toward violence," GLAS members
met with Stanford Police Department
representatives Friday.
David Cuff, representative of the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stan
ford, said that at the meeting Stan
ford Police Chief Marvin Herrington
reiterated his earlier position that the
police would not make arrests until
the effect of GLAS's poster campaign
can be determined. Herrington also
reportedly assured the group that he
would meet with them again to seek
other solutions before ordering ar
rests if the fliers don't work.
The GLAS fliers, posted in
bathrooms across campus, warn that
the police department is monitoring
sexual activities in the restrooms and
"will begin making arrests if such ac
tivity does not cease."
The fliers also urge readers to take
into consideration the arrests of 10
men in University bathrooms in 1980
and to "modify their behavior appro
priately."
Herrington told The Daily last
week that his department is again
looking into the activity "in response
to a number of complaints."
Those apprehended may be

charged with soliciting or engaging in
lewd conduct, but are usually charged
with loitering near a public toilet with
lewd intent.
The reason for the Friday meeting
was the lack of complete understand
ing on both sides. The gay community
"wasn't really clear on the types of
complaints they (the police) had
received," Cuff said.
Cuff also said the meeting was
spurred by fears that the publication
of the locations of the "tea rooms"
throughout the area might attract
"homosexuals that tend toward vio
lence, and who might see this as a
chance to come here directing vio
lence at [those posting fliers] and the
tea room users."
Cuff said there was no real way of
knowing if the fliers have been suc
cessful because GLAS has "left the
monitoring of the bathrooms to the
police." But Herrington is reported
to have told the group that no new
complaints have been received since
the flier campaign began.
Mark Dupont, co-president of the
Stanford Gay and Lesbian Law Stu
dents Association, told The Daily
that GLAS and other campus gay
groups have been concerned about
the "possibility of arrests when thore
may not really be grounds for them."
He said that California courts have
called the law, Penal Code 647,
