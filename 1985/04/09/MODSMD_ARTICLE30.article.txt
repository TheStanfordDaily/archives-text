# Stanford sports roundup
## 
### 
Men's rugby
The Stanford men's rugby team,
playing its first match in a month, lost
an early lead Saturday and fell in the
waning moments to host San Jose
State, 20-14.
The Cardinal shot ahead 6-0 in the
first half on two Andy McTavisch
penalty kicks. After the break, Stan
ford's forwards continued their
domination of the scrums and
lineouts, giving the backline many
opportunities to move the ball
downfield. Owen Ratchye scored
after recovering his own pop-kick
early in the second half to put the
Cardinal up 10-0.
Later, with Stanford up 10-4, Chris
Stevens darted through and around
several Spartan defenders before dish
ing the ball off to a group of sup
porting forwards. After several passes
among the forwards, flanker

McTavisch received the ball and took
it in for a try to put Stanford up 14-4.
As the half wore on, San Jose cut
into the Cardinal lead and eventually
won on a last-second run.
Women's rugby
The Stanford women's rugby club
made history this weekend by win
ning the Northern California league
championship for the first time. Stan
ford easily defeated both opponents it
faced during the NorCal playoffs held
here on Saturday.
The ruggers met UC-Santa Cruz in
their first match. In their previous
meeting the two teams had played a
very close game — Stanford won by
only one try — but it was all Stanford
on Saturday. Excellent team play se
cured an easy victory for the Card
inal.
In the second game, the Cardinal

faced itsr rivals from San Jose. Ihe
Bay Area She-Hawks are the only
team to have beaten this year s squad,
and Stanford took the opportunity to
enjoy a little revenge.
Although they spent virtually the
entire first half in BASH's end of the
field, all the Stanford ruggers could
manage was a Joan Saunders kick
that made the score 3-0. Up to this
point the Cardinal had been adhering
to a game plan calling for stand-off
Jennifer Crawford to kick frequently.
But the second half was to be a bit
different.
Crawford, now allowed to run;
single-handedly ran through the
entire She-Hawk defense, leaving q
path of defenders strewn about the
field. Her try and the successful con
version brought the score to 9-0. One
more score by Su/.y Shi meek made
the final margin 13-0 and gave Stan?
ford the league championship.
