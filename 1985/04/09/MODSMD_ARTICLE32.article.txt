# Stanford crews finish strongly
## 
### DAN NEWELL 
Despite the unseasonal blustery overcast skies,
more than 1,800 participants and the very best
crews in the country competed in the San Diego
Crew Classic Saturday. The classic is North
America's largest annual rowing event.
At least a dozen medalists from the 1984 Olym
pics rowed in San Diego, as well as crews from
Stanford, California, Harvard, Yale, Wisconsin,
Navy, British Columbia, perennial crew power
house Washington and representative crews from
more than 40 other universities and rowing clubs
from across the United States and Canada.
The Stanford men's varsity team placed sixth in
the Copley Cup finals, the junior varsity men were
fifth in the finals for their division, the freshman
squad placed fourth and the novice men almost
made the finals with only seven rowers before a
seat broke during their qualifying race.
The Stanford varsity women took fifth in the

Whittier Cup finals, while the women's junior var
sity and the freshman women placed second.
Men's Varsity Coach Ken Dreyfuss was espe
cially pleased with the performance of the varsity
and junior varsity boats.
"1 think we surpassed our expectations in terms
of getting both crews in the finals," Dreyfuss said.
Freshman/Novice Coach Jim Nearwell said: "If
you'd have told us the varsity and junior varsity
would be in the finals five years ago, we'd have
thought you were crazy. It would have been a 100-
to-1 shot five years ago to say that."
According to Nearwell, five years ago the Stan
ford men's varsity was rowing for the Cal Cup,
which is limited to California crews. He called the
Cal Cup "a cup for also-ran crews."
Three years ago the Stanford varsity crew won
the Cal Cup, which elevated the Cardinal to the

Copley Cup races against the best crews in the na
tion. "At first, they were over their heads . . . but
not anymore," Nearwell said.
John Davis, coach for the varsity women's pro
gram, was equally enthusiastic about the results re
corded by the women's crews.
"The varsity was ahead of Radcliffe, which was
real good," he said. "Radcliffe was No. 2 in the na
tion last year. It was a real pleasure to see that."
He was especially pleased with the junior varsity,
saying: "They probably shone the most."
The freshman women's eight trailed only Cal in
their race. "They finished second but didn't have
the race they thought they could," Davis said.
Similarly, the men's freshman eight didn't quite
get it together during their finals, finishing behind
Cal, Orange Coast College and UCLA despite
having beaten Orange Coast in their qualifying race
and Cal at last month's River City Regatta.
