In a move which has been ex
pected for some time, Stanford
Asst. Recruiting Coordinator Dick
Laguens has been hired to fill the
newly created post of recruiting
coordinator at USC.
"It's a good move for him,"
Stanford Athletic Director Andy
Geiger said yesterday. "It's time
for him to do something new."
Laguens, 34, was a student at
the business school during the two
years he worked here. His duties
ranged from data processing in the
Athletic Department to assisting
the coaches with the Cardinal

linemen during practices.
At USC, Laguens will be re
sponsible for administering the
recruiting programs for the Uni
versity's 20 intercollegiate sports.
Geiger said the move was not a
major thing. "It's something that
happens every day,"he said. "He
was kind of an intern here. In fact,
he asked me to call USC and rec
ommend him."
"It was a friendly parting,"
Geiger added. "He's a good guy
and we wish him well."
Laguens, who played linebacker
at UC-Davis in 1970-71 and has
coached football at the high school
and junior college levels, was un
available for comment last night.
