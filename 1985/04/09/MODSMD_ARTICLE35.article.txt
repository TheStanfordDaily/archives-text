## With ' The Purple Rose of Cairo,' Allen keeps racking up cinematic adventures 
### STEVE VINEBERG Editorial staff 
Woody Allen's movies over the last
eight years (since "Annie Hall," in
1977) have been of highly variable
quality, but he hasn't stood still: At
this point he may be our most consis
tently adventurous director (except
for Robert Altman), as well as our
most prolific, working steadily at the
rate of a picture a year. Watching his
movies season after season, you get
the sense of a filmmaker genuinely
striving to work out an esthetic in
terms of his personal concerns and in
response to his audience. That hasn't
always been a pleasant experience for
us; for a while his screen persona,
which he convinced us to see as an ex
tension of himself just as surely as
Chaplin wanted his audiences to
identify him with the Little Tramp,
usurped emotional space that by right
belonged to other characters
("Manhattan" was a Chaplinesque
display of ego), and sometimes Al
len's impatience with us for not fol
lowing where he wanted to lead us
turned bitter and assaultive
("Stardust Memories"). But even
those of us who had adored his early
comedies, like "Bananas" and the
best parts of "Everything You Al
ways Wanted to Know About Sex,"
and complained about the increased
self-consciousness and decreased
humor in his later pictures, could see
that he was seeking ways to deepen
his comedy — and, angry and
frustrated as we might be ducking an
attack like "Stardust Memories," it
was difficult not to sympathize in the
long run with the dilemma of a bril
liant comic writer/director not
satisfied with treading water for his
entire career.
For many of Allen's fans, "Annie

Hall" achieved the perfect marriage
of pathos and humor. Certainly it was
a touchstone film for the generation
that had grown up with Woody Al
len's soulful schlemiel — many of my
friends went to see it four or five
times. But like many touchstone films
("The Graduate," for one) it wasn't
quite as good as it was cracked up to
be. It had many lovely moments, hut
its coziness was finally an inadequate
substitute for the suffusion of feeling
you knew Allen wanted, and it was
perhaps a trifle too "wise" — his self
assurance about his characters' be
havior and what it meant had the ul
timate effect of letting the bubbles
out of the comedy. And Allen
seemed to know this movie wasn't
where he aimed to end up, because
despite its phenomenal popular and
critical success, despite the immediate
connection it forged with its audience
(or perhaps partly because of it?), he
has never made another one like
"Annie Hall."
"Annie Hall" was Allen's first film
with the photographer, Gordon Wil
lis, and the art director, Mel Bourne,
who have worked with him on all of
his movies since; with "Manhattan"
he picked up a third collaborator,
editor Susan E. Morse (and in
"Stardust Memories" he lost his co
writer, Marshall Brickman, who had
begun to make his own films). This
artistic team, who aided Allen's as
tonishing technical growth —
"Bananas," after all, is just about the
worst-looking classic comedy ever
produced — seem capable of ap
proximating any style and reproduc
ing any milieu with a witty, self
reflexive authenticity that crackles
("Stardust Memories" may have
been horrendous, but it was visually
extraordinary) and also of submerg

ing the entire process so that you can
barely separate out the jokes from
the wrap-around period detail. A
Woody Allen comedy no longer
derives its humor from the formerly
characteristic tension between the
pop-up verbally diarrhetic heroes and
the absurd situations they keep fin
ding themselves in. ("A Midsummer
Night's Sex Comedy," his most ill-at
ease movie, is a notable exception:
Nothing the characters do in it seems
convincingly in period.)
In the 1983 trompe I'oeil mock
documentary "Zelig," even Allen's
own performance, as well as that of
his co-star, Mia Farrow, receded into
the visual scheme; the movie — a
perfect mini-comedy — was a feat of
technical and acting wizardry. And at
last Allen had found a way to suggest
emotional depth without sacrificing
the comic invention that distin
guished his early films (and his short
stories, especially in the "Without
Feathers" collection): His
protagonist, Leonard Zelig, the
human chameleon, was a comic vision
of a (potentially) tragic character.
You can see how Allen's new ap
proach to acting, both in his own per
formances and in those of his fellow
actors, parallels his visual strategies in
"Broadway Danny Rose," too,
though the movie itself isn't very
good (it falls flat after a promising
entree) — the surprise in this movie is
Allen himself, who gives Danny Rose
a core of real emotion.
This lengthy introduction may help
to explain why I responded as I did to
Allen's latest movie, "The Purple
Rose of Cairo." It's a slender film,
like "Zelig," also running under 90
minutes and restricted to a single
comic conceit, but I think it's a mar

vel — ineffuhlv sweet, imaginative
and (finally!) suffused with feeling.
Allen himself doesn't appear; he per
forms the ultimate act of submersion
into the material by turning it over to
Mia Farrow. She plays Cecilia, a poor
working girl in the New Jersey of the
Depression, married to an insensitive
lug (Danny Aiello) who squanders
her wages — eked out at a hash joint
where she and her sister (played by
Stephanie Farrow, Mia's true-life
sibling) are employed as waitresses —
on craps and liquor, and then bru
talizes her. Returning night after
night to the local moviehouse, the
Jewel, where she knows the manager
(Irving Metzman, an asset to any
comedy) and his staff by name, and
they greet her like a member of the
family, she loses herself in whatever
she sees up on the screen — and then
carries it with her through the day, so
that she resides in a permanent
daydream and functions at only a
semi-conscious level in the restau
rant. When her distractedness loses
her the job, and she surprises Monk,
her husband, with another woman,
her only recourse is to run back to the
Jewel and retreat into the feature. It
is a programmer called "The Purple
Rose of Cairo," and as she watches it
over and over, savoring the scene in
which the juvenile, explorer Tom
Baxter (Jeff Daniels), is taken out on
the town by his New York socialite
friends, we see this scene again and
again too. We become so familiar
with every gesture and the timing of
every phrase that we almost gasp
when, suddenly, Tom pauses for a
moment and looks directly at Cecilia.
(It's an amazing moment: When
Woody Allen's technique is in perfect
sync with his ingenuity, no one can
touch him.) Then Tom Baxter steps

down off the screen and confronts
her.
From that point on the movie
operates on several narrative (and
comic) levels at once. Tom wants to
be "free to make my own choices,"
and he begs Cecilia, whom he has fal
len in love with, to show him her
world; these scenes parody movie
conventions, as Tom learns to his dis
may that his money won't buy him
dinner in a real restaurant, and to his
bemused delight that when he kisses a
real woman there isn't an automatic
fade-out. Meanwhile, the characters
he has abandoned up on the screen
can't play out the rest of the story, so
they panic and argue, and then they
begin to insult individual members of
the audience, who have grown rest
less and started to complain out loud;
this section of the film (the most in
ventive), which is peerlessly acted by
Edward Herrmann, Zoe Caldwell,
John Wood, Deborah Rush, Van
Johnson, Milo O'Shea and Karen
Akers, parodies both the conventions
of fiction and the concerns of contem
porary criticism in a way that suggests
parts of Gilbert Sorrcntino's mar

velous runaway novel "Mulligan
Stew." And Tom's unheard-of be
havior alarms the studio executives,
who see lawsuits in their future, as
well as Gil Shepherd, the actor who
played Tom in the film and who is
terrified that his character run amuck
will endanger his own burgeoning
career. (He's hoping to play Charles
Lindbergh next time out.) So he
shows up in New Jersey, too, to try to
persuade Tom to rejoin the other
characters on the screen. Meeting this
movie idol in person is the most excit
ing thing that has ever happened to
Cecilia — even more exciting than
meeting a fictional character — and
Gil is first flattered by her wide-eyed
response to him and then so touched
that/ie falls in love with her too.
"The Purple Rose of Cairo" is a
full-length variation on one of Allen's
best stories, "The Kugelmass
Episode," in which a middle-aged
Jewish man, unhappy with his life and
bored with his marriage, is
transported into 19th-century rural
France to have an affair with the


Woody Allen's "Manhattan," released in 1979, tells the story of his
search for the ideal relationship, a search that includes an ex-wife
(Meryl Streep) who has left him for another woman, a neurotic intellec
tual (Diane Keaton) and a 17-year old high school student (Mariel
Hemingway).
