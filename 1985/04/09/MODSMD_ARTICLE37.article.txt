# Waters goes beyond Pink Floyd at coliseum

So ya thought ya
Might like to go to the show
To feel the warm thrill of confusion
That space-cadet glow . . .
— "The Wall," 1979
Roger Waters does not like to give concerts, ab
hors touring: a shame, really, because lately he's
been getting pretty good at it, as his performance
Wednesday night at the Oakland Coliseum clearly
demonstrated.
And it's about time, too.
He's had a substantial amount of experience as
the bassist, vocalist, lyricist and general motivating
force for Pink Floyd, the legendary British art-rock
group. Before disbanding last year. Pink Floyd —
Dave Gilmour, Nick Mason, Rick Wright and
Waters — had released such classic albums as "The
Dark Side of the Moon," "The Wall" and "Wish
You Were Here" — conceptual works that have
been highly acclaimed for their innovative use of
the sound studio in creating captivating, intro
spective and provocative music.
However, Pink Floyd was never proficient as live
musicians— the vocals lacked intonation, the jams
lacked direction, the instrumentation was sparse.
So Pink Floyd relied heavily on effects for the suc
cess of its live performances— the group pioneered
the use of videos and front-screen projection, often
constructed larger-than-life mannequins of the
characters in its works, and made extensive use of
pre-recorded sound effects. This dependence on
conceptually coherent audio-visual effects reached
its extreme in the Floyd's last tour, that of "The
Wall" in 1980. In order to communicite the con
cept of rock star/fan alienation, the band actually
performed behind an elaborately constructed wall
made of 10-foot blocks.
And it was all Roger Waters' idea.
Although Dave Gilmour's fans may disagree,
Roger Waters is probably right when he claims, "I
am Pink Floyd." And Wednesday's show saw
Roger proving he was more — he presented the
concert perfomance that Pink Floyd's music always
deserved but never experienced, as well as per
forming his own original material.
The tour was officially titled "Roger Waters:
Pros and Cons plus some Old Pink Floyd Stuff."

And indeed the first half of the evening was solidly
Floydian domain. After opening with "Welcome to
the Machine," Roger and his band played "Set the
Controls For the Heart of the Sun,'' "Money,"
"Have a Cigar," "Wish You Were Here,"
"Nobody Home" and others, as well as a medley of
songs form "Animals" and"The Final Cut." The
irony of Waters' lyrics revelaed themselves as he
sang "In the Flesh":
So you thought ya
Might like to go to the show . . .
I've got some bad news for you, sunshine:
Pink isn t well, he stayed back at the hotel
And they sent us along as a surrogate band
We're gonna find out where you fans really
stand!
The songs were presented in a manner faithful to
their origins: Most of them featured their original
Pink Floyd videos, while some were accompanied
by the new work form Gerald Scarfe, the
provocative animator who was responsible for
much of the gripping, disturbing imagery in the
movie adaption of "The Wall." But one of the most
entertaining facets of the concert for any long-time
appreciator of Pink Floyd's music was the refresh
ing twist that many of the songs received because of
the different musicians involved. Most notable
were the contributions from Mel Collins (ex-King
Crimson), whose energetic saxophone solos
breathed new life into songs that verge on being
dinosaurian. And although Jay Stapley isn't any
Dave Gilmour or Eric Clapton (who accompanied
Waters on an earlier leg of this tour), he gave an
admirable, quality performance as one of the
band's two guitarists.
Michael Kamen, who has done much orchestra
tion and piano work for the Floyd and Waters,
added depth and texture with his keyboad playing,
while two female backup vocalists complemented
the saxophone in capturing that blues/gospel feel to
which much of Waters' music lends itself.
Waters' first set ended with the famous
"Another Brick in the Wall — Part Two," ironi
cally both one of Pink Floyd's few chart-topping
singles and one of the least convincing pieces that
night— the audience simply refused to mindlessly
chant, "We don't need no education," much to
Waters' relief, I'm sure. Roger then broke for a 20-

minute intermission — supposedly for a rest and set
change, but probably also to allow ample time for
the sale of various tour merchandise. Indeed,
finances are certainly one of the prime motivations
for this tour in general, and the particular incursion
of so much Pink Floyd material in the show in par
ticular. It was as if Waters was saying, "OK, I gave
you your bloody Pink Floyd stuff, now listen to
me."
Which is what we were expected to do for the
second half — experience the live presentation of
Waters' first (if "The Final Cut" doesn't count)
solo effort: "The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking."
The audience must have been very polite and ap
preciative (or were they confused and lost?) be
cause they didn't say a word throughout the entire
piece.
For the second half, there were three
syncronized video screens exploding with the art of
Gerald Scarfe, illustrating the story line of "Pros
and Cons." The result was a very powerful audio
visual introspecton into the mid-life crisis of a 20th
century man. If that sounds like your idea of a fun
time, than this show was very entertaining . Despite
(or maybe because of) the fact that for most of the
audience, the experience was confusing, disturbing,
and disorienting, it seemed they were attentive,
receptive, as if they were saying to Roger "OK, you
gave us our Pink Floyd stuff, now we'll listen to
you."
And for anyone who did listen, the second half
was fascination. The intricate development of con
ceptual themes, both orally and visually, was com
plex and effective. Admittedly, one must know a
lot of Waters' previous work to catch all the allu
sions, but I do not feel this can be considered a
flaw. It is music that rewards highly any effort
taken to apprecited it.
Finally, the sound quality of the show was
remarkable, featuring an excitingly effective quad
rophonic sound system that literally made the
music three-dimensional. This, coupled with the
coliseum's flattering acoustics, a clean P.A., well
produced effects and the wise use of headphones by
nearly all of the band members made the audio
experience pleasing to a degree that is rarely
achieved in a concert setting.


Roger Waters, the innovative force behind the British art-rock group
Pink Floyd, is now touring solo, taking with him earlier works of
Floydian domain along with his first solo effort: "The Pros and Cons of
Hitchhiking."
