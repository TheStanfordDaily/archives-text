## Twins to be split in next few weeks 
### 
The separation of two Siamese
twins currently at the Medical
Center will probably occur "within
the next few weeks," according to
Jamie Kunimoto of the Medical
Center News Service.
The decision was reached early
yesterday morning, according to
Kunimoto.
The twin girls, joined just below

the diaphragm, were delivered by
Caesarean section one week ago in
Watsonville and transferred im
mediately to Stanford, according
to Medical Center spokesman
Mike Goodkind.
Extensive testing has shown
that, although the twins' livers are
connected, "they (the joined
livers) are functioning as separate
entities," Kunimoto said.
