# SWOPSI course holds protest against violence toward women
## 
### BARBARA SCHULER Staff writer 
Carrying lighted candles and signs bearing
such slogans as "No More Women's Curfews
for Men's Crimes" and "Rape Isn't Just a
Woman's Problem," 60 women marched
through Palo Alto last night to protest violence
against women.
Susannah McKaye, one of the instructors for
a SWOPSI self-defense course sponsoring the
march, cited the recent rash of rapes in Palo
Alto and Menlo Park as one reason for the
march. "We thought it was a good time to do a
'Take Back the Night' march and we wanted to
include the community," she said.
Organized by students in a winter quarter
class called "Issues in Self-Defense for
Women," the march attracted mostly Stanford
students, although members of the community
and people from as far away as the South Bay
and San Francisco also participated.
"We're from San Jose," said one doctor
marching with three friends. "But we think it's
important enough to come up here and support
them, and we'd hope that if it happened in our
community, they'd come support us."

One chant heard along the route was, "What
do you want? No rape. When do you want it?
Now." But as marchers turned down a dark res
idential street, they changed their response
from "no rape" to "streetlights."
One woman disappointedly remarked, "Now
we're hack to the old reformist-versus-radical
arguments. 1 don't really want streetlights, I just
want to be able to walk alone at night."
At the rally following the march, several
speakers addressed a crowd which had grown to
more than 100, including greater numbers of
men and community participants.
Among the speakers were Jeffrey Masson,
former director of the Sigmund Freud archives
and a psychoanalyst who works with victims of
sexual abuse, and Wahneema Lubiano, a Stan
ford graduate student raped on campus several
years ago.
In talking about how to treat a rape survivor,
Lubiano said, "If she fought back or if she
simply endured, she did the right thing" and
should never be told otherwise. Lubiano em
phasized the torment she suffered and talked
about the disruption of every aspect of life
caused by her rape.

While Masson acknowledged that violence
aaainst women and methods for handling it are
"a man's problem," he said that the only
legitimate role sympathetic men can play is "to
listen and believe." Closing with a comment
that brought heavy applause, Masson said he
hopes women will "take back a lot more than
the night."
After talks by Lubiano, Masson and Jennifer
Walker, a counselor for the Mid-Peninsula
YWCA Rape Crisis Center, one member of the
SWOPSI class demonstrated self-defense tech
niques against a padded attacker in a "model
mugging."
As McKaye explained the different moves
used, the crowd shouted encouragement to the
victim, who demonstrated three hypothetical at
tack situations, including that of a sleeping
woman. Because many of the area's recent at
tacks have occurred in the victims' homes,
women should be prepared for this type of at
tacks, said McKaye.
A fact sheet distributed at the rally cited Palo
Alto Police Department statistics, which state
17 rapes and 15 attempted rapes occured in the
city of Palo Alto in 1984.
