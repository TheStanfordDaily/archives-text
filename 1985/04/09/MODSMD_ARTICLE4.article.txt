# Gay groups, med center clash over AIDS blood test
## 
### TODD RAMMING Senior staff writer 
The University Medical Center and
the Gay and Lesbian Alliance at
Stanford (GLAS) have issued clash
ing statements concerning the
HTLV-111 test which the Stanford
Blood Bank recently approved for
screening blood donations for possi
ble AIDS contamination.
Differing views here parallel a
statewide confusion surrounding the
controversial new test.
The procedure detects the presence
of antibodies to the AIDS virus and
indicates people who have been
exposed to AIDS (acquired immune
deficiency syndrome) although they
may not have contracted the disease,
according to Roger Svoboda, an ad
ministrator at the Stanford Medical
School Blood Center.
"The test is not very accurate.
Roughly one in five people will test
positively for exposure to the HTLV

111 virus whether or not they have
really been exposed," according to a
recent GLAS newsletter to its mem
bers.
Although such inaccuracy was a
concern during preliminary evalua
tion of the HTLV-111 test, "it turns
out that [such estimates are] simply
wrong," said Dr. Edgar Engleman,
associate professor of pathology and
medicine and medical director of the
blood center.
Of the six companies developing
the HTLV-111 test, the two receiving
Food and Drug Administration ap
proval have both demonstrated their
tests to give false positive readings in
less than one-half of 1 percent of all
cases, Engleman said. Data from the
blood bank here, the Red Cross and
Irwin Memorial Blood Bank in San
Francisco have all concurred on these
findings, he said.
But Holly Smith of the San Fran
cisco AIDS Foundation quotes a

recent report from the Centers for
Disease Control that estimates the
HTLV-111 test could give false posi
tive readings 5 to 30 percent of the
time.
The differing figures on the ac
curacy of the test have arisen because
different members of the medical
community have "all been conjectur
ing as to what the (HTLV-III) test
will and will not show."
Higher estimates of the inaccuracy
of the test also may have arisen be
cause certain lab technicians have
performed the test "not as sensitively
as necessary" in certain cases, Smith
said. The test is complex and
demands much training to execute it
properly, she added.
Amid continuing clinical investiga
tion into the HTLV-111 test, dispute
continues on the numerous legal
questions of AIDS testing, questions
that seek to defend the civil rights of
the gay population while protecting

the donor blood pool from contami
nation.
According to a bill signed into law
Thursday by Gov. Deukmejian, all
donated blood must be tested for
AIDS, and donors who show positive
results will be notified after a waiting
period.
According to the bill, "Every single
blood or blood component to be
transfused into a human must be
tested and labeled 'non-reactive,' "
said Peter Taylor, senior assistant to
Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los
Angeles), the sponsor of the legisla
tion.
Donors who are found with posi
tive results to AIDS screening will be
added to a state registry of carriers of
blood transmissible diseases. Accord
ing to the new law, the list may no
longer be "reason specific" as to what
blood transmissible disease a particu
lar donor carries, Taylor said. All
disease specifications currently at

tached to names on the list will be
removed, he said.
A companion bill, signed into law
at the same time as the Roos bill, es
tablishes provisions to protect the
confidentiality of the AIDS screen
ing.
In order to prevent high-risk
groups from using the blood donation
centers as a testing source for the
AIDS virus, $5 million has been ap
propriated by the Roos bill to es
tablish centers specifically where one
may go for AIDS testing, Taylor said.
A moratorium has been set upon
notification of blood donors found to
be possible carriers of AIDS until 90
days after the establishment of these
testing centers. At the end of this per
iod, blood banks will be able to notify
a donor of positive reaction to AIDS
screening no sooner than 60 days
from the day of donation, Taylor said.
The HTLV-111 test — which indi
cates only exposure to the AIDS virus

— "is not a clear indication or diag
nosis of AIDS," said David Cuff, offi
cial spokesperson for the GLAS
steering committee. "We (the steer
ing committee) feel that since the in
formation one receives from the test
is meaningless and does not give any
indication that one has AIDS, the
new law is not a positive step," he
said.
GLAS and other groups fear the
dangers to those whose names appear
on a list of possible AIDS carriers.
"Numerous people have lost their
jobs, houses and insurance when it
was discovered they have AIDS," ac
cording to a recent GLAS newsletter.
In addition, AIDS has been used as
an excuse to deny child visitation
rights and as a "subterfuge to dis
criminate against gay people," said
Leonard Graff of the National Gay
Rights Advocates, a non-profit law
firm.
