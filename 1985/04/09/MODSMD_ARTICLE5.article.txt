# Kennedy opens week-long hunger conference
## Kick-off rally draws 300 
### MARK LAWRENCE Staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy opened a five
day program of speeches, panel discussions and films on
world famine yesterday, calling on students to educate
themselves on the topic to help alleviate a world crisis.
Kennedy joined four student speakers in the White
Plaza rally that attracted close to 300 participants.
"Conferences like this, if they really produce a deeper un
derstanding of the issue in all its complexity and if they
produce a sustained commitment to their resolution, can
make an important contribution," he said.
Senior Sarah von der Lippc, director of the conference
and the first speaker in yesterday's program, shouted to
the crowd in an attempt to incite enthusiasm for the pro
gram. "Let's make some noise. There's a rumor circulat
ing that Stanford students don't care, that we are the 'me'
generation," she said.
Von der Lippe asked the crowd, "Do you care?" and
was answered with a forceful "yes."
Black Student Union Chairman Steve Phillips, Assis
tant Director of the Row Keith Archuletta and senior
Woody Ichiyasu also delivered addresses. They discussed
the relationship between famine and political oppression
and the need to tie famine relief with political self
determinism for people of the Third World.

Kennedy's speech followed Von
der Lippe's introductory remarks.
• Drawing upon his experience as a
member of a 1973 committee to
Study hunger under the sponsorship
of the National Academy of Science
National Research Council, Kennedy
presented several of the issues of
world famine.
; "The first thing I learned is that
food production, considered globally,
is adequate to feed all the world's
people, but it does not," said Ken
nedy.
; Distribution is "the critical mat
ter," he said. "As we have seen, even
in times of widely recognized crises
like the present one in Ethiopia when
normal economic barriers can be
eliminated and rules of trade
$uspended, it is difficult business
indeed to get food and hungry people
together."
Kennedy noted other "lessons" he
learned about the hunger problem:
• "Consumption and nutrition are

deeply embedded in culture, which
means that food must be the right
food and that merely supplying the
proper things in the proper propor
tions does not make any guarantees
about what what will happen when
people get it home," he said.
• "Hunger," he said, usually refers to
those people suffering from "calorie
stavation," but, if improper
"nutritional status" is considered, the
number of "hungry" people in the
world could be anywhere from 300
million to 1.2 billion.
• "Amelioration of hunger, especially
in those nations that can be termed
the 'poorest of the poor,' is linked in
extricably to all the other aspects of
developemental economics," he said.
Kennedy added that mere relief is
not enough to solve the hunger prob
lem. If it is the only strategy used to
combat hunger, he said, "we will
doom ourselves to disappointment,
and we will doom the populations of
developing nations to recurring natu
ral cycles of hunger and starvation —
because we will have satisfied our
selves with the amelioration of
symptoms and not causes."
