# Kennedy opens week-long hunger conference
## Kick-off rally draws 300 
### MARK LAWRENCE Staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy opened a five
day program of speeches, panel discussions and films on
world famine yesterday, calling on students to educate
themselves on the topic to help alleviate a world crisis.
Kennedy joined four student speakers in the White
Plaza rally that attracted close to 300 participants.
"Conferences like this, if they really produce a deeper un
derstanding of the issue in all its complexity and if they
produce a sustained commitment to their resolution, can
make an important contribution," he said.
Senior Sarah von der Lippc, director of the conference
and the first speaker in yesterday's program, shouted to
the crowd in an attempt to incite enthusiasm for the pro
gram. "Let's make some noise. There's a rumor circulat
ing that Stanford students don't care, that we are the 'me'
generation," she said.
Von der Lippe asked the crowd, "Do you care?" and
was answered with a forceful "yes."
Black Student Union Chairman Steve Phillips, Assis
tant Director of the Row Keith Archuletta and senior
Woody Ichiyasu also delivered addresses. They discussed
the relationship between famine and political oppression
and the need to tie famine relief with political self
determinism for people of the Third World.
