The solution to world hunger lies in a "new respect for
the capacity of the individual" and the strengthening of
public opinion, the executive director of UNICEF told an
audience that filled Kresge Auditorium last night.
Delivering the keynote speech for the Hunger Confer
ence, James Grant, executive director of UNICEF since
1980, pointed to recent technological developments and
mass communication as "grossly under utilized" means of
alleviating world hunger.
Grant said technological developments have now made
ending hunger and malnutrition possible through self
help.
One recent discovery has involved the modification of
saline solution previously given intravenously. According
to Grant, the addition of glucose to the solution makes it
possible and more beneficial to take the solution orally.
As a result of this development, it is now easy to make
home remedies.
"But this is only possible if we can reach the poorest
half of the world, and they are the ones usually the most
reluctant to respond," he said.
To reach the poorest of the poor, Grant suggested using
communication channels now neglected. At the end of a
three-month national immunization campaign involving
newspapers, government officials and
churches, Colombia managed "what
no other ccuntry had done in his
tory," Grant said.
The solution "lies in encouraging
people to better provide for them
selves," Grant said. "The role of gov
ernment is to facilitate, not to impede
this."
Grant encouraged students to
"spread the word that there is a
major potential today to help solve

the problems of world hunger" and to
support the role of self-help.
"Once this is articulated as a major
new ethic, it will have a tremendous
effect on other countries," Grant
said.
Grant called the current famine in
Ethiopia a "loud emergency" and
noted a lack of attention given to
what he labeled "silent emergencies."
"Not many people are aware that
even if there were no drought in
Africa, there would be 4 to 5 million
children dying annually in Africa," he
said. The number increases to almost
15 million worldwide, said Grant.
