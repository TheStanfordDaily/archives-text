Protesters urge U.S. missile freeze
LONDON — Europe's anti-nuclear protesters, marching by the tens
of thousands in traditional Eastertime peace rallies, called on Washing
ton yesterday to match Moscow's freeze on deploying medium-range
missiles.
Arrests of trespassers and demonstrators were reported outside U.S.
missile bases in Britain, Italy and West Germany, but police reported no
major incidents linked to the anti-nuclear rallies.
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher rejected the call made by
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev on Sunday for a freeze on deployment
of new U.S. cruise and Pershing 2 missiles in Europe.
Thatcher said to end NATO deployments now would "freeze in" an
enormous Soviet advantage, estimated by the White House at 10 to 1.
Gorbachev said the Soviet Union would halt deployment of SS-20
medium-range rockets in Europe until November, but would resume the
sitings if there were no similar action taken by the West. He also said he
accepted President Reagan's offer to hold a superpower summit.
Initial press and political reaction in Europe was divided between
those who dismissed the Kremlin gesture as a ploy aimed at splitting the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and those who hailed it as a
breakthrough in the East-West impasse.
Ortega rejects Reagan's proposal
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — President Daniel Ortega has rejected
President Reagan's proposal for a cease-fire and peace negotiations, his
office announced yesterday.
The presidential press office said Ortega announced his decision
during weekend talks with Colombia's foreign minister, Augusto
Ramirez Ocampo, whom he met in Havana. Ortega also met with
Cuban President Fidel Castro.
Reagan made the proposal last Wednesday in Washington. He
coupled it with a warning that he would seek resumption of military aid
to anti-Sandinista rebels if the leftist government did not agree to a
settlement within 60 days after opening negotiations.
During the meeting with Ramirez Ocampo, Ortega "expressed with
absolute clarity he does not accept the ultimatum presented by President
Reagan," the press office statement said.
It said Ortega urged a resumption of U.S.-Nicaraguan talks in Man
zariillo, Mexico, which the United States broke off in January.
Yesterday's statement was the first to quote Ortega directly on
Reagan's proposal.
Last week, the state-run Voice of Nicaragua radio denounced the pro
posal as "a public relations maneuver."
Political strife continues in Sudan
KHARTOUM, Sudan — The new military junta dismantled the state
security council and completed a roundup of former government leaders
following the coup that deposed President Gaafar Nimeiri, the official
news agency said Sunday.
It said anti-Nimeiri demonstrations and a general strike were continu
ing.
Nimeiri, considered one of the United States' firmest allies in Africa,
remained in Cairo, capital of neighboring Egypt.
The news agency SUNA said its transmissions had been interrupted
temporarily Sunday "because the masses of the people today decided to
continue the political strike and civil disobedience until the state security
apparatus was disbanded and all the figures of the defunct regime ar
rested and put on trial."
"We resume our transmission now that the state security council has
been disbanded and all the prominent figures of the defunct regime have
been arrested," said the agency, without giving details of the arrests.
"Brothers in the engineers union have volunteered to operate our trans
mission equipment because the political strike and civil disobedience is
still continuing."
Krajeski said Swareddahab "expressed interest in the maintenance of
continued good relations with the United States and appreciation for the
assistance the United States has provided Sudan in recent years."
Militias Battle in Sidon and Beirut
SIDON, Lebanon — Christians and Moslems fighting for control of
this southern port city ignored cease-fire appeals yesterday and people
streamed from the city to escape the battle, which has cost more than 50
lives in 11 days.
In Beirut, 25 miles to the north, rival militias fought with rocket
propelled grenades and machine guns across the "green line" frontier
between the capital's Christian and Moslem sectors.
The fighting in Sidon involves Christian and Moslem militiamen, Pal
estinian fighters from two refugee camps, and units of the Lebanese
army trying to stop the factional conflict.
Lebanon's defense minister promised to send more soldiers in the
coming days.
Police and hospital spokesmen said three people were killed yester
day, all at the Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp: two Palestinian brothers
aged 15 and 16 and an 11-year-old girl who was their cousin. At least 10
people were reported wounded, including two Palestinian fighters and
an army trooper.
Casualties in 11 days of fighting in the ancient port city stood at 51
dead and more than 220 wounded.
Christian and Moslem politicians and religious leaders met for three
hours yesterday at Sidon's Maronite Christian bishopric seeking an end
to the fighting.
