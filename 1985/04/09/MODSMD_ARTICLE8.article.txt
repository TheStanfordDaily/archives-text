# Soviets assail U.S. response

### 
MOSCOW â€” The Soviet Union said yesterday
that the Reagan administration had dismissed its
"major new peace initiative" in an effort to
diminish the plan's effect on world public opinion.
Visiting American congressmen welcomed Mik
hail Gorbachev's announced readiness for a sum
mit with President Reagan, but the official news
media gave the summit short disclosure and con
centrated instead on praising the Soviet leader's
latest proposal on arms control.
On Sunday. Gorbachev announced a
moratorium on deploying medium-range missiles
in Europe until November and renewed the Krem
lin's call for a ban on testing space weapons during
the U.S.-Soviet arms talks in Geneva.
The United States contends the Soviets have a
great advantage in medium-range missiles already
installed, and has said its space-defense research
program is not negotiable.
Gorbachev proposals appeared on the front
pages of the Communist Party newspaper Pravda
and the government daily Izvestia. It was the main
item on radio newscasts, which said it had attracted
worldwide attention, and the evening television
news carried laudatory interviews with factory
workers.
Tass, the official news agency, said Gorbachev's
proposals were stressed by Lev Tolkunov, head of

the Soviet of the Union, one of two houses of the
Soviet parliament, at a meeting with the visiting
Americans.
The U.S. delegation, led House Speaker Thomas
O'Neill and the Republican minority leader,
Robert Michel, is expected to get a fuller exposi
tion of Soviet arms policy today from Foreign Mini
ster Andrei Gromyko.
The representatives said they hoped to meet
Gorbachev tomorrow. There is time on the delega
tion's schedule, but there has been no official con
firmation that a meeting will occur.
Delegation members expressed pleasure at what
they called Gorbachev's "positive attitude" toward
Reagan's invitation to a summit.
"1 think it augurs well for world peace when the
two dominant nations of the world can get at the
table and sit down," O'Neill said.
Gorbachev's comments on a summit were in
cluded in the published interview, but news media
commentary focused on arms control.
The Soviet leader pledged to freeze deployment
of new medium-range missiles in Europe until No
vember "whether the United States follows our ex
ample" or not.
He also said the Soviets were "suspending," for
an unspecified period, the deployment of longer
range rockets in East Germany and Czechoslo

vakia, which started in late 1983 when NATO
began deploying Pershing 2 and cruise missiles.
The comments did not change the Soviet bar
gaining position, and the official U.S. response was
cool.
"If they want a freeze, fine. It's not enough,"
White House spokesman Larry Speakes said, in
sisting that the Soviet Union already has an advan
tage in medium-range missiles.
Michel called the moratorium "a freeze on an
imbalance that's about 10 to one in their favor.
Rep. Frank Guarini, a New Jersey Democrat,
described it as "a good public relations ploy," con
sidering the Dutch intention to delay a decision on
deploying the 48 cruise missiles assigned to it until
Nov. 1.
Georgi Arbatov, head of a Kremlin think tank on
U.S.-Soviet relations, told reporters the White
House response was "nonsense."
"He (Speakes) doesn't count a lot of things like
the British and French missiles," he said.
There is a longstanding dispute over whether to
count the French and British weapons as part of the
NATO arsenal in negotiating cuts in the Soviets'
estimated 414 triple-warhead SS-20s and the
Western allies' 134 cruise and Pershing 2 missiles
now in place.
NATO plans to deploy a total of 572 medium
range missiles in Europe to counter the SS-20s.
