# Mondale blames communication for loss

WASHINGTON — To Walter
Mondale, it was the medium and not
the message that buried him in the
1984 presidential election.
"I think I was essentially correct on
the fundamental issues," said
Mondale in his first national exposure
since the election in which, as he put
it,"I took a very classic shellacking."
The defeated Democratic nominee
appeared on the NBC show "Meet
the Press" on Sunday, and it was clear
that during the past five months he
has done a lot of thinking about his
campaign and why it ended the way it
did.
So have a lot of other Democrats,
and many of them came away from
that election with a far different view
than Mondale. Those opposing views
are the basis for the debate now going
on within the Democratic Party.
Mondale offered no regrets about
what he or his party was advocating in

1984.
In response to some of the ques
tions during the 30-minute program,
the former vice president echoed
campaign speeches. He persisted in
his belief that President Reagan will
be forced to ask for a tax increase to
deal with budget deficits.
He talked about the "great cost to
the economy" of Reagan's economic
policies and about the need for fair
ness and justice.
Mondale referred to the Demo
cratic Party "as the party of change,
of justice, of hope," and added, "1
believe that the public will reassert its
support for our candidates."
"I did not communicate hope and
opportunity and change, even though
that's what I was saying. That's not
what they heard, and I'm responsible
for that," Mondale told The Wash
ington Post in an interview published
toHav

If he was right on the issues, what
went wrong with his campaign?
"Where I think I fundamentally mis
handled n.y case to the American
people is that I dwelt unduly on the
problems. ... I do not think I empha
sized the positive the way I should."
Not only was he accentuating the
negative, but his opponent was a
master at communicating a positive
message.
"The fact of the matter is, Presi
dent Reagan's ability to communicate
— even things that I think are
demonstrably not accurate — verges
on genius," said Mondale. "And I
don't think anybody accused me of
the same capability."
Even while Mondale could recog
nize how the president benefited
from sticking with a positive message,
the defeated Democratic nominee
couldn't bring himself to take that

course. It was the same old Mondale
on the television screen, warning
voters that their taxes were going to
go up, echoing perhaps the most dis
astrous message of his presidential
campaign.
It is hard to find another Democrat
willing to stand up these days and talk
about the need to raise taxes. Sen.
Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) and Rep. Rich
ard Gephardt (D-Mo.), authors of
the Democrats' tax simplification
plan, insist their proposal would be
"revenue neutral," the phrase also
used by the White House to tell
people that tax simplification would
not be a backdoor method of raising
taxes.
Mondale talked about the need for
the Democratic Party to be perceived
as receptive to change, but during the
brief interview he offered no hint of
how the party should change, what
new programs it ought to offer.
