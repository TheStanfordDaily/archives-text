# Pentagon says Soviets test SS-20

WASHINGTON â€” Although
the Soviets are testing an im
proved version of the SS-20 nu
clear missile pointed at Western
Europe, it remains unclear how
soon they might start deploying it,
a Pentagon spokesman said yes
terday.
"We simply don't know what
their intentions are," said spokes
man Michael Burch. "We have
watched them keep up with their
building program, where they're
building more and more (launch)
sites. Now whether they put more
SS-20s in those, or put 24s (SS-X
-24 missiles) or this new 25 (SS-X
-25 missile) in them. . . . We simply
don't know at this point."
The SS-X-25 and the SS-X-24
are two new intercontinental bal
listic missiles that the Pentagon
has said the Soviets will deploy
this year and next, respectively.
The Washington Post quoted
private and government sources as
saying the Soviets' announcement
Sunday of a moratorium on SS-20
deployments might be a hollow
gesture because they were busy
preparing a new version of the
missile.
In Santa Barbara, White House
Chief of Staff Donald Regan
told reporters: "We have known
for quite some time that they had a
new missile to replace the SS-20
and we recognize it is getting close
to a time when they could start to

deploy it. So therefore their want
ing to stop deploying the (SS-)
20s came as no surprise to us."
Burch, at a news briefing, said
the Reagan administration has
already made clear it places little
stock in the moratorium. He said
there is no way of knowing
whether the Soviets had planned a
slowdown in deployments while
awaiting the improved missile.
"What all have noted is that the
Soviets offered a freeze before (in
1982), and during the period of
their self-imposed freeze they con
tinued to deploy missiles," Burch
said. "The other thing is even if
they would freeze right now, it still
gives them a 9- or 10-to-l advan
tage in the total number of war
heads facing NATO forces.
"You have to weigh their freeze
offer very carefully."
The question of SS-20 deploy
ments is of crucial importance to
the United States and its allies
within the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, because the three
warhead SS-20 is the most modern
intermediate-range missile in the
Soviet arsenal.
The fact that the Soviets were
testing an improved version of the
SS-20 was disclosed on April 2,
when the Pentagon released its
latest assessment of Soviet military
power.
