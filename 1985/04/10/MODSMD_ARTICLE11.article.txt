Reagan writes Soviets
SANTA BARBARA — White House chief of
staff Donald Regan said yesterday"it would be a
big letdown" if President Reagan met Soviet
chief Mikhail Gorbachev in a summit that was
merely a get-acquainted meeting and did not
produce results.
He said there was no way of telling whether a
summit was more likely next year than in 1985.
"I see no time frame as having been set," he said.
Briefing reporters as President Reagan relaxed
on vacation at his mountaintop ranch, Regan
seemed to tighten U.S. conditions for a super
power meeting. In recent weeks White House of
ficials have said that the president had dropped a
demand that any summit be sure to produce tan
gible results, and Reagan himself has appeared to
soften his preconditions for a summit.
Later in the day, a White House official said
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill (D-Mass.), cur
rently leading a congressional delegation on a
visit to the Soviet Union, was carrying a new let
ter from Reagan to Gorbachev.
The message reaffirms Reagan's "interest in
solving problems that the two countries face,"
said the official, who spoke on condition that he

not be identified. He added that the letter
"reaffirms the president's interest in a meeting,
as conveyed earlier" by Vice President George
Bush.
But the official, who said he assumed the
message already had been delivered to the Krem
lin, insisted that there was "nothing new" in the
Reagan letter.
On Sunday, Gorbachev said in an interview
with the Soviet Communist Party newspaper
Pravda that he was prepared to hold a summit
meeting with Reagan. Gorbachev was quoted as
saying "a serious impulse should be given to
Soviet-American relations at a high political
level."
Regan said, "We've always felt that there
should be a lot of ground work and an agenda set
before any meeting before the two leaders, and
we're still on that."
"We think it would be a big letdown — not
only for America but also for the rest of the
world — if the two leaders were to meet and ac
complish nothing," he said.
Washington Post libel
WASHINGTON — A divided federal appeals
court yesterday reinstated a $2 million jury ver

diet against The Washington Post, ruling that the
newspaper had libeled Mobil Oil Corp. President
William Tavoulareas in a 1979 article about his
business dealings.
In a 2-1 decision, the three-member U.S.
Court of. Appeals said the trial record shows
"that the falsehoods contained in the article were
published not merely through negligence or inad
vertence, but with reckless disregard of whether
they were false or not, i.e., with actual malice."
Boisfeuillet Jones, the Post's general counsel,
said the newspaper was "very disappointed and
surprised by the decision" and would ask the full
court to rehear the case.
Stocks mixed
Stock prices finished mixed yesterday after a
quiet and meandering session on Wall Street.
Some savings and loan issues advanced as in
terest rates fell in the credit markets.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
more than 4 points at midday, closed with a .88
gain at 1,253.86.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
came to 83.98 million shares, against 79.96 mil
lion Monday.
