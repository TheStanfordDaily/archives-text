NAACP offers Penn aid
SAN DIEGO — Local leaders of the NAACP
say they're offering legal and financial assistance
to Sagon Penn because of concern the 23-year
old won't receive a fair trial on charges of killing
a policeman and wounding another officer and a
civilian.
The Rev. Robert Ard, vice president of the
local NAACP chapter, said the concern stems
from allegations that police provoked the attack
by beating Penn with nightsticks.
Penn. who remains jailed in lieu of $250,000
bail, has pleaded innocent to charges of murder
and attempted murder in the March 31 shooting
death of police Agent Thomas Riggs and the
wounding of Agent Donovan Jacobs and civilian
ride-along Sara Pina-Ruiz.
"We have decided to assist Sagon Penn in the
pursuit of justice and to do whatever we can to
ensure he receives due process under the law and
maintains the integrity of his civil rights," Ard
said Monday in a joint statement with Curtis
Moore, president of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People.
According to police, Penn was stopped by

Jacobs while driving a pickup truck carrying
friends home from an outing. Riggs, accompa
nied by Mrs. Pina-Ruiz, joined Jacobs in what
began as a routine traffic stop.
Police said Penn threw the first punch in a
scuffle that led to the shootings, but some wit
nesses said Jacobs called Penn "boy" and asked if
he was a gang member.
The witnesses said Jacobs grabbed Penn by the
arm and hit him repeatedly with a nightstick.
The victims were shot with a service revolver
wrestled from one of the officers' holsters.
"At this time, we are not affixing blame, guilt
or innocence on anyone," said Ard, pastor of San
Diego Christ Church. "We are calling for a full
investigation of this tragic incident and a full
revelation of the findings to this community."
Duke won't replace loss
SACRAMENTO — Gov. George Dcuk
mejian said yesterday he doesn't intend to give
local schools any extra state dollars to make up
for the $150 million to $180 million they are
losing because of delays in starting the state lot
tery.

"We do not have any plan to do that," the Re
publican governor told a Capitol news confer
ence in response to questions about making up
for the lost lottery revenues.
Deukmejian repeated earlier estimates by in
terim lottery director Howard Varner that the
first games won't start until "sometime in Sep
tember," about six months after the March 22
startup date mandated in the lottery initiative ap
proved by voters last fall.
Deukmejian stressed that his proposed $10.9
billion support budget for local schools contains
substantial increases apart from the lottery funds,
which were designated by the initiative to be
above and beyond any other school aid.
Today's weather
Mostly cloudy today with highs in the lower
70s. Mostly cloudy tonight with a chance of
showers. Lows in the mid 40s to the mid 50s.
Decreasing cloudiness tomorrow. Highs in the
mid 60s to mid 70s.
