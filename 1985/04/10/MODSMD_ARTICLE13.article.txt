## Radiation combats arthritis, kidney disease 
### PATRICK LIN Editorial staff 
In the 1950s at Stanford, the late
Henry Kaplan developed Total Lym
phoid Irradiation (TLI) as a form of
radiation therapy for Hodgkin's
disease, a cancer of the lymphatic sys
tem.
Today, use of TLI is being ex
panded from anti-cancer therapy to
the treatment of a wide variety of
non-neoplastic disorders.
In recent studies reported by
Samuel Strober, professor of
medicine, and his colleagues, the ra
diation therapy has been shown to be
effective against common auto
immune disorders, such as
rheumatoid arthritis, and effective in
preventing graft rejection in
transplant surgery.
The reason for TLl's broad ap
plicability is that it efficiently sup
presses the body's immune system.
However, unlike other immunosup
pressive regimens, TLI does not
seriously compromise the body's abil
ity to fight off infections.
Thus, TLI enables a body to
tolerate a foreign graft while leaving
it still capable of combating infec
tions.
During TLI treatment, the body is
almost completely shielded by lead.
Only those areas in the neck, chest
and abdomen containing lymph
nodes and other lymphoid tissue are
exposed to radiation.
Over the course of several weeks, a
linear accelerator applies radiation in
small doses to the exposed areas. The
total amount of radiation that the
body absorbs is roughly 2,000 rads,
approximately five times a lethal dose
of radiation.
Such a dose would normally kill an
individual by destroying the bone
marrow cells that give rise to red and
white blood cells. However, since
bone marrow is shielded in TLI, the
body can withstand the high levels of
radiation.
After the radiation therapy,
patients are given several doses of
anti-thymocyte globulin to kill off any
remaining mature T-lymphocytes, a
subset of immune cells.

The mechanism by which TLI shifts
the immune system into a suppressed,
tolerant state is not completely un
derstood, but two processes are
clearly involved, according to
Strober.
First, the radiation depletes the
body of mature immune cells and
causes an immediate im
munosuppression.
Second, as the body recovers and
repopulates its lymph nodes with new
immune cells, the subset of cells
known as suppressor T-lymphocytes
are generated much more rapidly
than an antagonistic subset of cells
known as helper T-lymphocytes.
Suppressor T-lymphocytes are re
sponsible for suppressing the body's

immune response. For example, the
cells can block the development of
the cytotoxic T-lymphocytes that di
rectly destroy transplanted organs.
Helper T-lymphocytes, in contrast,
are involved in inducing an immune
response. In TLI, these cells do not
seem to mature properly, according
to Strober, and this favors suppressor
T-lymphocytes.
In auto-immune disorders, the
body's immune cells become over
reactive and begin to attack the body
itself. Part of the problem appears to
be an imbalance in the immune sys
tem that favors helper T-lymphocytes
over suppressor T-lymphocytes.
In this month's issue of the" Annals
of Internal Medicine, Strober and his
co-workers reported that TLI was

highly effective in treating patients
with two common types of auto
immune disorders â€” rheumatoid
arthritis and lupus nephritis.
Rheumatoid arthritis, a disease of
the joints, afflicts approximately 2
million people in the United States.
Lupus nephritis, a disease affecting
the kidneys, afflicts several hundred
thousand people.
In Strober's studies, 15 out of 20
arthritis patients who had failed to
improve with conventional arthritis
treatments dramatically improved
with TLI.
Eight out of 10 lupus patients for
whom conventional therapy failed
showed marked improvement in kid
ney function after one year with TLI.
in January, Strober and his col

leagues reported the results of using
TLI to prevent graft rejection in kid
ney transplant patients.
Out of 25 patients studied, 84 per
cent retained grafts after one year.
This success rate was comparable to
that obtained with the new drug
Cyclosporin A, currently regarded as
the best available means for prevent
ing graft rejection.
While as effective as Cyclosporin A
in preventing rejection, TLI may
prove to have certain advantages over
the drug.
According to Strober, Cyclosporin
A has certain undesirable side effects.
For example, it is toxic to the kidneys,
liver and central nervous system.
Cases have been reported in which

patients on Cyclosporin A lost kidney
function and had to be put on dialysis
machines.
Moreover, patients must continue
to take large doses of Cyclosporin A
tor the rest of their lives. This can cost
a patient roughly $5,000 a year, ac
cording to Strober.
TU's advantage over Cyclosporin
A is that TLI "minimizes side-effects
and cost," said Strober. Patients need
to be maintained only on low doses of
prednesone, an anti-inflammatory
steroid, after the initial treatment.
While TLI seems to hold great
promise for many patients, Strober
recognizes that public acceptance of
radiation therapy may be slow.
"There's a very substantial concern
by people for the use of irradiation
for non-malignant disease," he said.
People are apprehensive that radia
tion therapy may increase their
chances of getting cancer.
According to Strober. the effects of
radiation therapy on patients with
Hodgkin's disease has been ex
tensively studied. Of the 1,500 cured
patients, there has been found no in
creased risk of getting rapidly devel
oping cancers such as leukemia and
lymphoma, Strober said.
In addition, he said, during the six
years since he began using TLI to
treat patients with auto-immune dis
orders, none of the approximately
100 patients have developed tumors.
However, Strober noted, there may
be an increased risk of getting cancers
that develop much later in life, such
as skin and lung cancer. This is a diffi
cult issue to resolve because the
studies are all based on Hodgkin's
disease patients, who already may
have an increased risk for cancer.
Whether or not TLI does increase
the risk of cancer later in life, Strober
believes that the therapy "must be
evaluated in a business-like, cost
benefit analysis" and that people
should not be immediately in
timidated by the use of radiation.
For Strober, the benefits of TLI, in
terms of improvement of the quality
of life of patients, seem to outweigh
the known potential risks associated
with the treatment.
