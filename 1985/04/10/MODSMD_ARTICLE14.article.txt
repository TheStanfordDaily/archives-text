Journalist I.F. Stone put it bluntly when he
said, "Every government is run by liars, and
nothing they say should be believed." Stone's
axiom may be harsh, but considering the recent
arguments of members of the Reagan administra
tion, probably not at all that far from the truth.
In the March/April issue of the Columbia Jour
nalism Review, George Bush's press secretary is
quoted as saying, "You can say anything you
want in a debate and 80 million people hear it. If
reporters then document that a candidate spoke
untruthfully, so what? Maybe 200 people read
it."
During the president's more than four years in
office, numerous misstatements and errors have
been brought to light. Previously, aides dismissed
these as minor problems that didn't affect the
president's credibility.
The current administration is hardly the first to
have been caught lying. As far back as the Eisen
hower administration, when the president's
stroke was initially reported as a cold, the gov
ernment has lied or consciously misinformed the
public many times.

Sometimes those dubious statements had
reasoning, such as national security. When
former President Carter's press secretary, Jody
Powell, was asked whether a rescue mission was
planned in Iran, he said no. The next day, the res
cue effort was an abysmal failure.
But the statement from Bush's secretary is dif
ferent. It goes from dismissing errors to promot
ing them, and that is a dangerous step.
Trust in government is something that is
supposed to be promoted. What the president
says is supposed to be accurate, or at least as
close to the truth, as possible.
When former President Nixon lied about
something as frivolous as the recipe for the cake
at his daughter's wedding, the press began to
question all his statements. If he would lie about
something frivolous, could he be expected to tell
the truth about Cambodia?
Now, the same must be said of Reagan. If the
administration is willing not only to dismiss error
but to promote it, what can be believed? Every
thing that the president says must come under
question.
