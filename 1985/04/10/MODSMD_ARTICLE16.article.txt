# Sex and exploitation in a capitalistic society
## 
### 
The ads for "The Sure Thing," one of this year's efforts
to cash in on the college spring break crowd, present a
capsule summary of the state of sexual relationships in
capitalist America.
The top half of the ads feature the studio's idea of the
prototypical male sexual fantasy: a "bronzed goddess,"
almost dressed in a string bikini, reclining on a beach. The
nearby title identifies her as "the sure thing."
Below are two student-types — a young man, gazing
rapturously at the sex symbol, and behind him — second
ary to him — a woman, apparently fully dressed, giving
him a loving look of wry impatience.
The copy reads: "The sure thing comes once in a
lifetime .. . but the real thing lasts forever."
What does this say about modern love? It's easy to see
that the bikini woman is reduced to a commodity — the
promise of sexual satisfaction is being offered to the
(male) viewer in exchange for his movie-going dollars.
This kind of commerce can be seen on our very own
campus, as the Playboy corporation offers Stanford
females $400 for the right to use their sexual images,
which will in turn be sold (at an obscene profit) to horny
men for their rhythmic admiration.
(And while I'm on the subject, I'd like to publicly disas
sociate myself from The Daily's editorial on the running
of Playboy ads. The Daily editorial writers essentially
argued that moral questions should not interfere with eco
nomic decisions — which makes them a pack of hypocrites
for telling Stanford to divest from Motorola.)
The "sure thing" is a commodity, but what about the
other woman in the ad? The copy seems to identify her as
"the real thing," i.e., "true love." Essentially, though, she

is "the real thing" only in the sense that Coke is.
At the same time that the ad holds out the promise of
sexual fulfillment through the figure of the woman on the
beach, it tells us it can provide emotional connection as
well, through vicarious identification with the film's char
acters. (Later ads promised even more: "See it with some-

one you want to fall in love with!" was the main pitch.) In
this way the culture industry increases its profits by selling
two products at once: sex and romance.
The selling of sex is seen — rightly — as exploitative.
But the real damage is not to the model (or stripper, or
prostitute) — she gets paid a full market rate (though
$400 seems a little low). Nor are women, who are identi
fied with one-dimensional sex objects, the only ones hurt.
Both women and men are poorer because their real ex
perience of sexuality is replaced by a commercially
created reality — a complex human interaction is reduced
to what is, at bottom, only a cash transaction.

This same substitution goes on when romance is sold as
just another product, as in a song by the British band The
Psychedelic Furs: "My set it plays love songs all day / It
sells toothpaste, razors, Band-Aids / It sells love and it
sells hair spray."
The emotional pornography of soap operas and easy lis
tening radio is more insidious than the traditional sexual
sort. It meets our needs — in a false way — but at the
same time recreates them, defining our images of relation
ships in a way that is marketable.
What they are selling is the ideology of romance — the
archetype of finding your one and only true love and
living happily ever after. This fits in well with the basic
commercial plot — the consumer finds happiness through
the purchase of a product. The product, in this case, is Mr.
or Ms. Right.
Karl Marx once said that the relations between men and
women reflect the development of society as a whole. In a
slave culture, women are treated as another form of slave;
under capitalism, men and women become commodities
to each other.
The commodity aspects of modern relationships are
embodied in romance. An exchange is made — sexual
access for fidelity. Usually it is the woman who is
presumed to be making the sacrifice by allowing sex —
women are still encouraged to deny that physical pleasure
is something desirable in itself, and instead to see it as a
means for other ends.
What makes fidelity valuable? It proves the right each
partner has over the other's body. The partner is trans
formed into a kind of property — allowing the relation
ship to convey social status. The desirability of our mate

demonstrates our social worth, just as the expensivenfcss
of our car displays our economic value.
Some writers have seen a growing rejection of
monogamy, and have labeled this a "flight from commit
ment. ' But it can also be seen as a new kind of commit
ment, a commitment to a more human sexuality, where

Women and men are poorer
because their real experi
ence of sexuality is replaced
by a commercially created
reality.

people and pleasures are valued for their own sake, not
for their exchange values.
It's not possible to uncover a "natural" form of rela
tionship — humans left their instincts behind when they
began to develop culture. But we can achieve forms that
are consciously chosen, after a critical examination of our
values and desires. The first step to this is a rejection of
the commercial dreams that we are constantly bombarded
with.

which will in turn be sold (at an obscene profit) to horny
men for their rhythmic admiration.
(And while I'm on the subject, I'd like to publicly disas
sociate myself from The Daily's editorial on the running
of Playboy ads. The Daily editorial writers essentially
argued that moral questions should not interfere with eco
nomic decisions — which makes them a pack of hypocrites
for telling Stanford to divest from Motorola.)
The "sure thing" is a commodity, but what about the
other woman in the ad? The copy seems to identify her as
"the real thing," i.e., "true love." Essentially, though, she

is "the real thing" only in the sense that Coke is.
At the same time that the ad holds out the promise of
sexual fulfillment through the figure of the woman on the
beach, it tells us it can provide emotional connection as
well, through vicarious identification with the film's char
acters. (Later ads promised even more: "See it with some-

one you want to fall in love with!" was the main pitch.) In
this way the culture industry increases its profits by selling
two products at once: sex and romance.
The selling of sex is seen — rightly — as exploitative.
But the real damage is not to the model (or stripper, or
prostitute) — she gets paid a full market rate (though
$400 seems a little low). Nor are women, who are identi
fied with one-dimensional sex objects, the only ones hurt.
Both women and men are poorer because their real ex
perience of sexuality is replaced by a commercially
created reality — a complex human interaction is reduced
to what is, at bottom, only a cash transaction.

This same substitution goes on when romance is sold as
just another product, as in a song by the British band The
Psychedelic Furs: "My set it plays love songs all day / It
sells toothpaste, razors, Band-Aids / It sells love and it
sells hair spray."
The emotional pornography of soap operas and easy lis
tening radio is more insidious than the traditional sexual
sort. It meets our needs — in a false way — but at the
same time recreates them, defining our images of relation
ships in a way that is marketable.
What they are selling is the ideology of romance — the
archetype of finding your one and only true love and
living happily ever after. This fits in well with the basic
commercial plot — the consumer finds happiness through
the purchase of a product. The product, in this case, is Mr.
or Ms. Right.
Karl Marx once said that the relations between men and
women reflect the development of society as a whole. In a
slave culture, women are treated as another form of slave;
under capitalism, men and women become commodities
to each other.
The commodity aspects of modern relationships are
embodied in romance. An exchange is made — sexual
access for fidelity. Usually it is the woman who is
presumed to be making the sacrifice by allowing sex —
women are still encouraged to deny that physical pleasure
is something desirable in itself, and instead to see it as a
means for other ends.
What makes fidelity valuable? It proves the right each
partner has over the other's body. The partner is trans
formed into a kind of property — allowing the relation
ship to convey social status. The desirability of our mate

demonstrates our social worth, just as the expensivenfcss
of our car displays our economic value.
Some writers have seen a growing rejection of
monogamy, and have labeled this a "flight from commit
ment. ' But it can also be seen as a new kind of commit
ment, a commitment to a more human sexuality, where

Women and men are poorer

ence of sexuality is replaced

reality.

people and pleasures are valued for their own sake, not
for their exchange values.
It's not possible to uncover a "natural" form of rela
tionship — humans left their instincts behind when they
began to develop culture. But we can achieve forms that
are consciously chosen, after a critical examination of our
values and desires. The first step to this is a rejection of
the commercial dreams that we are constantly bombarded
with.
