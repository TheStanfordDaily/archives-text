## Pendleton is no civil rights leader 
### 
The April 3 column by Jason Matherly on
Clarence Pendleton, the chairman of the U.S. Civil
Rights Commission, embodies a superficial, banal
understanding of the situation and overflows with
blatent inaccuracies. Matherly puts forth two basic
arguments: first, that Clarence Pendleton is "one of
the only true leaders in civil rights"; second, that
Pendleton "has been taking a lot of flack" because
he is courageous and insightful enough to "steer
clear of the rusty bandwagon of status quo civil
rights advocates" (i.e., because Pendleton's views
differ from those of the mainstream civil rights
leadership).

VIEWPOINT

Matherly errs on both points. Quite simply,
Matherly lacks even a reasonably discerning under
standing of the dynamics of the Pendleton situa
tion.
Matherly's contention that Pendleton is a
"courageous civil rights leader" is erroneous. How
can Pendleton possibly be a civil rights leader
when, as far as he is concerned, the civil rights
struggle was won long ago? Strange though it may
seem. Pendleton, head of the U.S. Civil Rights
Commission, does not think that civil rights is any
longer a problem or a concern of the government.
He is quite forthright in his belief that discrimina
tion and racism no longer exist as civil rights issues.

Pendleton has, as Math
erly says, received a lot
of flack. However, this
flack has been elicited
more by Pendleton's
manner, by his style,
than by his views.

In response to a question after his recent speech
at the Stanford Law School, Pendleton stated, "I
was in Washington. D.C., hack during a time when
racism still existed." as if to imply that, with the
passage of a few years and a few laws, racism has
been obliterated. Pendleton clearly believes that it
has. According to a recent article by David Bell in
The New Republic (April 1). when asked what are
the major civil rights problems in the United States,
Pendleton succinctly replied. "I don't know of any,
except enforcement, and enforcement is in the eye
of the beholder."
When asked about further research on civil
rights, Pendleton says that "we have studied the
civil rights issue to death. . . . This is about the last
hurrah." Asked about the need for black political
leaders. Pendleton states. *1 don't know why we
need black leaders. We don't have white leaders,
do we?"

Bell adequately summarizes Pendleton's view of
racism and civil rights: Pendleton "denies that race,
which he habitually dismisses as 'pigment,' plays
any significant role in American society and seems
to regard anyone who thinks otherwise as the pris
oner of a slave mentality." Obviously, Pendleton is
not a civil rights leader, and doesn't identify himself
as one, because he sees no civil rights problems in
the United States. In his view, the struggle for civil
rights is over and won.
Clarence Pendleton has, as Matherly says,
received a lot of flack. However, this flack has been
elicited more by Pendleton's manner, by his style,
than by his views. Matherly asserts that "the
virulent reactions Pendleton's actions and words
have drawn from the inertia-stricken civil rights
leadership reveals the stagnation and tunnel vision
that has beset these so-called 'leaders.' "
More accurately, that Pendleton has drawn such
reactions reveals something about him. What it
reveals (as if it weren't already obvious to anyone
who has talked to the man) is that Pendleton is an
abrasive, disrespectful, obnoxious and combative
showman repeatedly prone to making needlessly
inflammatory and insulting remarks. On more than
one occasion, Pendleton has accused respected civil
rights leaders (people such as Jesse Jackson, Ben
jamin Hooks, etc.) of being racist and immoral.
Pendleton has gone on to characterize them as
"part of a race industry and a problem for black
progress." In a speech in Akron, Ohio, Pendleton
compared Jesse Jackson to Jim Jones, the leader of
the mass suicide in Guyana, and implied that
America's black leadership is leading black people
to an analogous fate.
"Open the plantation gates and let us out!"
Pendleton demanded. "We refuse to be led into an
other political Jonestown, as we were during the
presidential campaign. No more Kool Aid Jesse,
Vernon and Ben! We want to be free!"
His assessment of the comparable worth idea at a
news conference further reveals Pendleton's
derogatory, acrid manner: He termed the issue
"the looniest idea since Looney Tunes." He said
this not privately or off the record, but at a news
conference.
Pendleton's propensity to insult and deride ideas
or people with whom he disagrees is the cause of
the "verbal dung" that has been flung at him. The
tremendous criticism he has received results not so
much from his views as from the manner in which
he chooses to express his views.
Countless commentators have astutely observed
that the main cause of Pendleton's dilemma is his
constant inclination to insult and disparage well
known black leaders. A March 10 Washington Post
editorial criticized Pendleton for making "broad,
unsupported pronouncements and attacking the
motives of those who disagree with him."
Furthermore, the Post says that Pendleton's
"style has become troubling even to those who may
agree with him." For example, a social scientist
who has worked on research projects for the Civil
Rights Commission says that Pendleton's primary
function on the commission is to "undermine confi
dence and embarrass people."
Nationally syndicated columnist Carl Rowen

says that "Pendleton has gone out of his way to in
sult blacks of unquestioned intellect and notable
achievement." William Rasberry, also a nationally
syndicated columnist, accurately observes that by
stating his views with "such reckless misjudgment,"
Pendleton "comes off only as an opportunist
seeking to curry favor with his white, conservative
sponsors. His vitriolic remarks do not trigger dis
cussions of the issues; they only trigger discussions
of Clarence Pendleton."

Pendleton is quite
forthright in his belief
that discrimination and
racism no longer exist as
civil rights issues.

Clearly, Pendleton has been castigated, but not
because he doesn't "conform to the mold of a
black civil rights leader," as Matherly claims.
There is no mold to which black leaders are ex
pected to conform. Matherly rhetorically asks,
"Why are all vocal blacks who desire some degree
of credibility expected to think alike?" Such a
statement reveals Matherly's feeble knowledge of
black leadership.
Historically, "vocal blacks who desire some
degree of credibility" have held widely different
opinions on what governmental actions would most
benefit blacks. W.E.B. Dubois and Booker T.
Washington by no stretch of the imagination held
the same views. Malcolm X and Martin Luther
King saw black progress as traveling vastly differ
ent routes. The Urban League and the NAACP,
two of the largest civil rights organizations, have al
ways used different strategies and implemented dif
ferent programs to promote black advancement.
And who would possibly say that Minister Louis
Farrakhan, the most visible black leader during the
past two years (with the obvious exception of Jesse
Jackson), thinks the same way that other black
leaders do?
In conclusion, Pendleton is certainly not a civil
rights leader and would not even consider himself
one, as he believes that civil rights is no longer a
problem in the United States. Also, the criticisms
of Pendleton by established, respected black
leaders have little to do with his actual views.
Established black leaders don't like Pendleton
due to his constant insults and derisions directed at
them, and due to his arrogant, disrespectful,
abrasive and flippant attitude toward them and is
sues that are important to black Americans. As
evidenced by Matherly's column, although
Pendleton has alienated blacks, he has done one
thing well: As Rowen says, Pendleton "has given
great comfort to those whites who recoil at any sug
gestion that racism is still rampant in America."
