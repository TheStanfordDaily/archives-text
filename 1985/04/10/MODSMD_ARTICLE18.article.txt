It tolls for thee
Any man's death diminishes me
because I am involved in Mankinde;
Therefore never send to know for
whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee.
-John Donne
I had trouble sleeping the other
night. I was thinking about Maj.
Arthur Nicholson, the U.S.
officer shot in East Germany.
Nicholson's death disturbed me. I
pored over the information in my
head; and when I came upon the
source of the disturbance, the nature
of my beast, I found it had nothing
to do with Nicholson's death at all. It
had to do with 19 deaths in South
Africa last week. It had to do with
the value of human life. And it had
to do with Ronald Reagan.
When one man died tragically in
East Germany last Sunday, I listened
to the words that went around;
words like "unnecessary," "brutal,"
"murder." And I nodded my head in
approval as President Reagan took
steps to remedy the sad situation.

When 19 people died tragically in
South Africa last week, I heard the
same words and approved of the
unabashed condemnation. And then
I listened to the words of Reagan;
words like "riot," "law enforce
ment," "tragic, but." Last week,
when 19 died, Reagan sent to know
for whom the bell tolled. It matiered
to him — black/white, South
African/American, partner/foe. For
whatever reason, it mattered. Some
how, the deaths of 19 South Africans
did not diminish him to the extent of
the death of one American.
Now I know why I could not sleep
the other night, and I wonder how
Ronald Reagan can sleep any night.
But then again, he does not seem to
understand about the bell, or about
tragedy, or about the value of human
life. So I grieve for one American,
19 South Africans and for Ronald
Reagan. It tolls for thee, it tolls for
thee.
