## Physicists look for gravity waves 
### CHRIS HAQQ 
In a joint effort between Stanford
and the Xongshan University in
Guangzhou (Canton), China,
physicists are aiming to search for
gravity waves in an area encompass
ing up to 600 million light years.
Although predicted by many physi
cal theories, including Einstein's gen
eral theory of relativity, gravity waves
have never been seen. The emission
of gravity waves is thought to occur
with the acceleration of matter. The
phenomenon can be considered
somewhat analogous to the emission
of electromagnetic waves that result
from the acceleration of a charged
particle, explained Physics Prof. Peter
Michelson, who is coordinating the
Stanford effort in the experiment
along with Physics Prof. William Fair
banks. Just as electromagnetic waves
arise from the acceleration of elec
trons in wires, gravity waves arise
whenever a particle with mass is ac
celerated.
Gravity waves given off in the ac
celeration of most objects are too
small in magnitude to be easily de
tected. Physicists have decided to
look for the most powerful gravity
waves, those given off in the collapse
of massive stars.
The physicists hope to determine
some of the characteristics of gravity
waves. Competing physical theories
of gravitation propose slightly differ
ent characteristics for gravity waves
and the proposed experimentation

may reveal which theory is closest to
reality.
The Stanford detector will be able
to detect bursts of gravity waves given
off by coalescing black holes. Because
the waves resulting from the collapse
of a symmetric round star might can
cel each other, Michelson says the de
tector will probably detect binary, or
twin, black holes, whose collapse is
very assymmetric.
Many binary star systems are lo
cated outside our galaxy and are
thought to be older than galaxies. For
this reason, experimental data may
provide information about the nature
of the universe before galaxies
formed and about the formation of
black holes, according to Michelson.
The actual Stanford detector is an
aluminum bar three meters long. It
operates something like a tuning fork
that will resonate if a note of the ap
propriate frequency is sung nearby.
The present detector is sensitive to
gravity waves of 100 hertz frequency,
which is the approximate frequency
calculated for waves emitted from the
collapse of a star the size of our sun.
The frequency of the wave emitted
varies according to the size of the col
lapsing star.
The problem of isolating the detec
tor from background noise is the
major engineering challenge of the
experiment. In order to ensure that
no motion of the bar results from in
ternal heat energy, the device is

cooled to a temperature of two
degress Kelvin (-456 F, or -271 C).
At this condition, the device is suffi
ciently sensitive to detect gravity
waves from stars.
While the Chinese detector is at
room temperature and considerably
less sensitive, correlations between
events observed here and in China
will give physicists confidence that
the events are actually gravity waves,
and not freak accidents. With an old

detector, the Stanford group has
already seen 574 events that could be
gravity waves, but because no other
group could corroborate the data, the
physicists could not be sure that they
had actually seen significant events.
Soon, researchers from Louisiana
State University, the University of
Rome and the University of
Maryland will have detectors in oper

ation and all groups will run coin
cidental experiments.
The two groups of researchers,
here and in China, will send data to
each other at the end of each week.
They will examine about 50 events
per day, provided there are enough
events. Fairbanks and Michelson ex
pect the events to be rare at first, but
hope to increase the number of
events detected by searching a broad
area. The experiment will be able to
find black holes between our galaxy,
the Milky Way. and the Virgo cluster
of galaxies. When three detectors are
operated, a coordination of signals
should allow the location of black
holes in space. Support for the re
search comes from the National Sci
ence Foundation.
Michelson says Stanford soon will
ask the National Science Foundation
to fund a five-year program to com

plete construction of two new detec
tors sensitive to gravity waxes of 1
kilohert/ and able to detect waves
from superno\ as.
A 50-ton supercooled detector is
planned to detect bursts ol gravity
waxes from coalescing binary black
holes in deep space. Ihe physicists
hope to be able to cool the 40-foot
bar down to 0.01 degrees Kelvin,
something that has never before been
accomplished. This detector could
find black holes in an area en
compassing (>OO million light years.
1 .iter this year. Fairbanks and Mic
helson will go to China to help the
Xongshan researchers build their own
supercooled detector. Currently.
Xongshan physicist Hu Fn-ke is at
Stanford learning the construction
technology.
Over the next five years, the re
searchers hope to build an array of
three or four detectors sensitive to
gravity waves of different frequencies
so that waves from stars of many dif
ferent si/os ma\ be detected.
