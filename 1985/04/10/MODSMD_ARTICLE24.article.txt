# Hybrid cells make human antibodies

Researchers at Stanford Medi
cal Center have reported the pro
duction of a new human
monoclonal antibody potentially
able to reduce dramatically the
number of deaths from infections
in hospitals.
Monoclonal antibodies are
highly specific, pure proteins made
by specially cloned cells known as
hybridomas.
Ever since the production of the
first monoclonal antibody by Koh
ler and Milstein in 1975,
monoclonal antibodies have been
hailed as powerful new tools for
the diagnosis and treatment of
disease.
However, despite the great po
tential ascribed to monoclonal an
tibodies, their actual therapeutic
use has been very limited until
recently. The reason is that the
technology for producing the an
tibodies utilizes mouse cells.
Mouse antibodies, when in
jected into humans, are
recognized as being non-human
and foreign by the human immune
system. Eventually, the human
host produces its own antibodies
against the mouse antibodies and

destroys them.
Stanford scientists, however,
have now developed a means for
producing human monoclonal an
tibodies. The method has sucess
fully produced an antibody capa
ble of fighting a type of blood
borne bacterial infection known as
gram-negative sepsis.
Approximately 200,000
patients contract gram-negative
sepsis every year and 75,000 of
these patients die. Gram-negative
sepsis is believed to be the leading
cause of death from infections in
hospitals.
The new antibody is the first
human monoclonal antibody
believed to have therapeutic
promise, according to Nelson
Teng, assistant professor of gyne
cology and obstetrics. Teng was
one of the researchers involved in
the study.
Traditionally, monoclonal an
tibodies were made by fusing a
mouse antibody-producing lym
phocyte with a mouse myeloma
cell. The myeloma cell, being
derived from a cancer cell, is im
mortal and lives forever in tissue
culture.
