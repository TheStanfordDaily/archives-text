# Hybrid cells make human antibodies
## 
### PATRICK LIN Editorial staff 
Researchers at Stanford Medi
cal Center have reported the pro
duction of a new human
monoclonal antibody potentially
able to reduce dramatically the
number of deaths from infections
in hospitals.
Monoclonal antibodies are
highly specific, pure proteins made
by specially cloned cells known as
hybridomas.
Ever since the production of the
first monoclonal antibody by Koh
ler and Milstein in 1975,
monoclonal antibodies have been
hailed as powerful new tools for
the diagnosis and treatment of
disease.
However, despite the great po
tential ascribed to monoclonal an
tibodies, their actual therapeutic
use has been very limited until
recently. The reason is that the
technology for producing the an
tibodies utilizes mouse cells.
Mouse antibodies, when in
jected into humans, are
recognized as being non-human
and foreign by the human immune
system. Eventually, the human
host produces its own antibodies
against the mouse antibodies and

destroys them.
Stanford scientists, however,
have now developed a means for
producing human monoclonal an
tibodies. The method has sucess
fully produced an antibody capa
ble of fighting a type of blood
borne bacterial infection known as
gram-negative sepsis.
Approximately 200,000
patients contract gram-negative
sepsis every year and 75,000 of
these patients die. Gram-negative
sepsis is believed to be the leading
cause of death from infections in
hospitals.
The new antibody is the first
human monoclonal antibody
believed to have therapeutic
promise, according to Nelson
Teng, assistant professor of gyne
cology and obstetrics. Teng was
one of the researchers involved in
the study.
Traditionally, monoclonal an
tibodies were made by fusing a
mouse antibody-producing lym
phocyte with a mouse myeloma
cell. The myeloma cell, being
derived from a cancer cell, is im
mortal and lives forever in tissue
culture.
I he tusion of the lymphocyte and
myeloma cell is also immortal and is
known as a hybridoma. It produces a
single, pure antibody — a monoclonal
antibody — and offers a means for
generating large quantities of that
specific antibody.
I he technique was previously not
applicable lor making human
monoclonal antibodies because there
was no suitable immortal human cell
to fuse with human antibody
producing lymphocytes.
leng and his colleagues overcame
the problem by employing an artifi
cially constructed immortal cell — a
heteromyeloma — which was created
bv fusing mouse and human myeloma
cells.
When human lymphoctes were
fused with the heteromyeloma, the
resulting cell — also called a
heteromyeloma — produced pure,

human monoclonal antibodies.
Teng and co-workers used the new
technique to produce a human
monoclonal antibody against en
dotoxin, a protein made by the bac
teria Escherichia coli.
Normally, E. coli resides in the
human digestive tract and causes no
problems. However, in patients with
certain conditions, E. coli breaks
through the digestive tract and grain
negative sepsis results. Patients at risk
include those with diabetes or cancer
and those undergoing transplant sur
gery.
In gram-negative sepsis, the en
dotoxin produced by the bacteria can
have lethal effects, causing fever,
lowering of blood pressure, shock and
respiratory collapse.
Antibiotics, while effective in kil
ling the bacteria, do not neutralize
the endotoxin and therefore are not
wholly effective in treating gram
negative sepsis.
The human monoclonal antibody
made bv Tent? and his colleagues.

however, hinds to endotoxin and ef
fects its destruction. In laboratory
tests, the antibody was shown to be
highly effective in protecting mice
from gram-negative sepsis.
The antibody is very powerful be
cause it recognizes and binds to many
different types of endotoxin
molecules. Different bacteria tend to
produce different endotoxins, and an
antibody to one endotoxin may not
necessarily be effective against an
other

Teng's antibody recognizes a wide
variety of endotoxins because it was
designed to bind to a region of the en
dotoxin molecule that is common to
all such molecules.
leng and his co-workers believe
that their human monoclonal an
tibody "should hold great promise in
both the analysis and treatment" of
gram-negative sepsis. Testing of the
antibody in human patients is sched
uled to begin sometime this year.
