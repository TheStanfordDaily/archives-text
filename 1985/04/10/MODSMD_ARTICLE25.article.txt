## Card destroys Davis, 20-5 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
Stanford's No. 1 ranking may he disputed
in places such as Miami and Oklahoma, hut
don't expect much argument in Davis.
Playing its first game since becoming the
nation's top-ranked team, the Cardinal served
notice that it may be keeping the top spot for
a while, with a 20-5 bombing of host UC-
Davis.
Stanford's 17-hit, seven-home run perfor
mance justified the judgment of the
ESPN/Collegiate Baseball pollsters and left
two Aggie pitchers wondering why these men
in cardinal and white were allowed to come in
and ruin their ERAs.
Believe it or not, Davis actually led in this
game. The Aggies took a 1-0 lead in the first
on first baseman Don Leßeau's homer, but it
didn't last long.
In the second, Walt Harris was hit by a
pitch and stole second. He then rode home on
a homer by designated hitter Jeff Ballard —
better known as the ace of the Cardinal's
starting staff. Not to be shown up by a pitcher,
John Ramos immediately followed with a
longball of his own to make the score 3-1. The
barrage had begun.
Stanford poured six more runs across the
plate in the third. The big blows were a homer
by Mike Deßenon and a three-run blast by
Ramos — his sixth of the year.
Mercifully, Aggie starter Jeff Tappin was
removed after giving up another homer— to
Ruben Amaro — and an RBI double to Rick
Lundblade. In his three-and-one-third inning
nightmare, Tappin allowed 11 earned runs
and 10 hits— including five home runs.
Ron Myers came on for Davis and escaped
the fourth without further damage. However,
he endured a six-run inning of his own in the
fifth. Ballard started the inning with a single;
then, an error, a walk and two doubles later,
Deßenon finished the frame with his second
round-tripper of the day — making the score
17-4.
After his 4-for-4 day, Ballard may have
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess wondering
whether the designated hitter is such a good
idea after all. Ballard has six hits — three for
extra bases — and seven RBIs in his nine at
bats this season.
The Cardinal scored its final three runs in
the ninth. An error gave James Gasho his
third plate appearance of the year, and the
reserve junior outfielder didn't waste it,
smashing a three-run homer that allowed
Stanford to match its season-high for runs.
In addition to the team's explosive offense,
the performance of reliever Rick Dietz was a
positive sign for the Cardinal. Dietz over
powered the Aggies for three innings, allow
ing no hits and striking out five. Only one ball
hit off him left the infield.
