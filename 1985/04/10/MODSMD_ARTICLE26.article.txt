# Spikers host reeling Bruins

### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's volleyball
team will try to clinch its first-ever
NCAA playoff berth tonight when
it hosts UCLA in a league match
in Maples Pavilion. The contest
begins at 7:30.
It's been a disconcerting year
for Bruin Coach Al Scates, whose
team has won the national cham
pionship four times. With an un
distinguished record of 9-6 in con
ference and a 27-7 overall mark.
UCLA stands on unfamiliar
footing. The Bruins are currently
tied for third in the California In
tercollegiate Volleyball Associa
tion with UC-Santa Barbara.
The Bruins and the Gauchos
were long ago buried by confer
ence champion Pepperdine, 17-0,
and USC, 12-3. Stanford, with a
9-7 record, rests in the league's
fifth spot, a half-game up on
Hawaii, 8-8.
This season has been a rude
awakening for Scates, a man ap
parently accustomed to getting his
way. "I'm just not used to it
(losing)," Scates said, "and I'm

really not getting used to it. I'm
just getting aggravated.
"I love to win and I hate to lose;
I just never really thought about
which force is greater."
Stanford, long a league door
mat, surely learned over the years
which "force" is greater. After
years of maulings at the hands of
UCLA, the Cardinal would like to
take a little revenge on the Bruins.
And it would seem that UCLA
is good prey. The Bruins stagger
into Maples having lost three
straight league games— to UCSB,
Pepperdine and USC. Moreover,
UCLA doesn't like leaving Pauley
Pavilion. The team has split its six
away matches.
Tonight's contest could be his
toric for Stanford men's volleyball.
With a victory, the Cardinal would
clinch a spot in the post-season
NCAA tournament. Even if the
squad falls short, its magic num
ber stands at one. That means that
any Stanford triumph or Hawaii
defeat would send the Cardinal to
Los Angeles later this month.
