that one of his assistants was aware of
$2()0-a-week under-the-table pay
ments to the Salukis star center.
Dean Stuck, special assistant in
charge of intercollegiate athletics at
the school, announced the resignation

knew about weekly $200 payments
made by a university booster to 6-
foot-11 center Kenny Perry.
Carbondale chiropractor Roy
White told university officials last

Thursday he agreed to the payments
in the summer of 1982, when Perry
transferred from the University of
Evansville. White also contended
Van Winkle was involved in the ar
rangement, hut Stuck said an internal
investigation launched after White's
disclosure showed no wrongdoing hy
the coach.
"I have not uncovered any
evidence to corroborate an allegation
that Allen Van Winkle was involved
in any payments to Perry," he said.
Perry sat out the 1982-83 season
because of NCAA rules regarding
transfer students, but was named the
1983-84 Missouri Valley Conference
Newcomer of the Year. This year, his
final year of eligibility, he averaged
13.4 points and 6.7 rebounds per
game as the Salukis finished the
season with a 14-14 record, 6-10 in
the conference.
