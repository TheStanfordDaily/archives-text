Mark Murphy "came down from
the mountains" to play tennis for San
Jose State this year, and yesterday he
was the only Spartan to defeat a Stan
ford opponent in the Cardinal's 8-1
win.
Murphy beat Derrick Rostagno in
the No. 2 singles match, 6-0, 6-4. It
was the second time Rostagno, cur
rently No. 7 in the country, has lost to
him this year. Murphy also upset Cal
ifornia's No. 2 player, Chris Schoop,
in San Jose State's match against
Berkeley earlier this season.
"Mark grew up in the mountains of
Oroville near Chico and came down
to go to American River Junior Col
lege last year and San Jose State this
year," Coach John Hubbell said.
Hubbell said his "player who came
out of nowhere" has been working on
being more aggressive — taking a
chance in his matches in order to im
prove to the point where he can com
pete against the best of players.
"His problem is that he's too com
petitive. He can't stand to lose a
point, even in practice," Hubbell
said.
Murphy exhibited his competitive
side yesterday, keeping steady pres
sure on Rostagno after the first-set
blowout.
"Derrick didn't come out well and
lost the first set badly," Coach Dick
Gould said. "What was good was that
he pulled himself together and played
a competitive second set. But Mark
stayed tough, which is often hard to
do after starting out so well," he said.
Hubbell was especially pleased
