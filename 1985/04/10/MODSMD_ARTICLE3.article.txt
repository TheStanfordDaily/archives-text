# Senate approves fee
## Also paves way for Bob Hope appearance

Staff writer
The ASSU Senate approved a base
Association fee of just more than
$191,000 in its meeting last night at
the Law School. This figure is only 5
percent more than last year's fee, a
significant drop from the more than
30 percent increase in each of the two
preceding years.
In addition, the senate approved a
bill that will allow the Speakers
Bureau to bring Bob Hope to campus
May 8.
In other business, it passed a
resolution to "discourage" Playboy
magazine from including Stanford
women in its "Girls of the Pac 10"
feature. This move was initiated by
STOP (Stanford Students Opposed to
Pornography).
Many student groups presented ob
jections to the original recommen
dations of the Program Board and the
Senate Appropriations Committee.
The most vocal of these were the
Black Liberation Month Planning
Committee (BLM), the Stanford
Arms Control and Disarmament
Forum (SACDF) and the Contra
ceptive Information Center (CIC).
In its original review of BLM's
budget, the Appropriations Commit
tee cut its total Program Board al

location from $4,300 to $2,800.
After statements by BSU Treasurer
Donna Anderson and Council of
Presidents (COP) member David
Porter, the allocation was raised to
$4,000, equal to the allocations of the
past two years.
"This is some of the most innovat
ive and creative programming on
campus," said Graduate Senator
Mark Mazur in defense of BLM.
SACDF, recovering from a period
of little programming prior to last
year, requested an additional $2,000
to supplement that portion of its
budget that was to be carried forward
to next year. Because it has had such a
banner year, it used $2,000 of next
year's money on this year's program
ming.
"There is not an auditorium at
Stanford that we have not filled, with
the exception of the stadium and
Maples," said SACDF Director Ben
Austin.
After lengthy debate, the senate
approved the additional funding for
this "group that's dealing with one of
the most sensitive issues facing us,"
according to Senator John Boranian.
CIC, which requested Program
Board funding for the first time in its
existence, ran into much senate resis

tence. The rationale against providing
funding for this service was that the
University had a responsibility to
fund it as a part of student health
care.
Graduate Senator Suzanne Uhland
helped to defeat this request by ex
pressing her fear that the University
may begin to take advantage of the
Program Board's funds because of
the fund's growth.
The Coalition Against Apartheid
also opposed the original allocation
recommendations. Because its budget
showed no programming for the past
year, the Program Board mistakenly
assumed it was an upstart group and
cut the amount of its allocation.
After a statement from representa
tive Eric Diesel, its final allocation
was raised to $ 1,399 from the original
$666.
In its move to bring Bob Hope to
Frost Amphitheatre next month, the
ASSU has little chance to make
a profit although it is almost assured
of breaking even. According to
Porter, Hope's contract guarantees
him $10,000 plus all other profits up
to $50,000, after which profits revert
to the ASSU.
Examples from other schools indi
cate that ticket sales will exeed the
6,073 necessary for a profit.
