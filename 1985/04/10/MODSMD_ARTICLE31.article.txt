# Softballers split 2 with SF State
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER Senior sportswriter 
The Stanford softball team won its
first game of the month yesterday
after nine straight losses, and will be
looking to repeat the performance
today at home against California.
The Cardinal's eighth victim of this
season was host San Francisco State.
Stanford downed the Gators by the
score of 5-0 in the second game of a
double-header to give the Cardinal,
which lost the opener, 2-1, its first
victory since March 29 at the Texas
A&M Invitational.
With the drought seemingly over,
Stanford will turn its focus to Califor
nia, 17-13, today at 1:30 p.m. on
Roble Field. The Bears, of the North
ern Pacific Conference, defeated the
Cardinal twice at Berkeley Feb. 27,
but these teams' level of play might
have reversed since then, Stanford
Coach Kathy Lincoln said.
"We're hitting better now," she
said of her team, which had five
singles yesterday. "We're still strug
gling a little, but we hit it hard. We
got key hits with people in scoring po
sition, and we don't always do that.
"We're in a defensive groove. If
we're up for it, we're a better team.

They may be struggling now."
Lincoln said Cal's defense might be
suspect because it relies on strong
pitching. However, because Stanford
has faced top-ranked teams such as
UCLA and Fullerton State in West
ern Collegiate Athletic Association
play, Lincoln said the Bears' pitching
might be a notch below what the
Cardinal has been seeing lately.
That is, with the exception of San
Francisco State. Stanford had trouble
getting used to the Gator pitchers'
slow deliveries, Lincoln said, and
could do little at the plate until the
second game. In the opener, losing
pitcher Lisa Buchanan, 4-16, scored
in the fourth after a single, two wild
pitches and an error.
In the second game, winner Betsy
Watson, 4-18, was the recipient of
three hits and a three-run fifth inning.
Stanford had not had more than two
hits in a game for Watson in her past
four losses dating back to March 31.
In the fifth inning of yesterday's
nightcap, K.K. Bush and Laura and
Lisa Buchanan scored. In the first,
Cathy Taft led off with a single and
scored. In the sixth, Kathy Domin
guez scored after a leadoff walk.
