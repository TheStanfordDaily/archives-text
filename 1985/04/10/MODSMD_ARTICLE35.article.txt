# SCLC to institute Honor Code changes involving penalty grading and proctoring
## 
### 
Proposed changes to the Honor
Code designed to eliminate penalty
grading and to clarify proctoring of
examinations may become official
this week, according to members of
the Student Conduct Legislative
Council.
The proposed texts were released
March 20. If no further comments are
submitted by either students or fac
ulty concerning the changes by
Friday, the proposals will become
law, according to SCLC head Barbara
Babcock, a professor at the law
school. If comments or complaints
are received,.the council will weigh
their merits and either keep the
Friday deadline or postpone it for ad
ditional discussion.

Babcock said she welcomes the
changes.
"These revisions are a real good
compromise," she said. "I think these
are good clarifying ammendments."
The proposed revisions are worded
as follows:
Temptations for violation
Procedures that create temptations
to violate the Honor Code would
read as follows, with the proposed ad
dition in italics:
"Examples of undesirable
procedures include the following:
failure to give clear directions and in
structions concerning course require
ments and the limits of acceptable col

laboration in coursework; treating re
quired work casually. . ."
Penalty grading
"Under the Legislative and Judicial
Charter, students afe not to be
penalized for violations of the Honor
Code without notice, hearing and ad
judication, as therein provided. An
instructor may not, therefore, lower a
student's grade or impose any other
academic penalty on the grounds of
dishonesty in the absence of such for
mal proceedings."
Under the current interpretations
and applications of the Honor Code,
a student's grade may not be lowered
by an instructor on the grounds of

dishonesty "unless the student is in
formed and gives consent."
"An instructor who suspects dis
honesty may, with the students's con
sent, require that the work be redone
and resubmitted, giving a grade on
the resubmitted work," the current
text states.
Proctoring
"Proctoring means being present in
the examination room during a writ
ten examination, with the following
exceptions: l)The prohibition against
proctoring should not be construed to
prohibit an instructor or teaching as
sistant from remaining in the ex

amination room for the first few
minutes to distribute and explain the
examination; or from visiting the ex
amination room briefly to transmit
additional information; or from re
turning at the end of the examination
to collect the examination papers. 2)
Nor does the prohibition against
proctoring prohibit an instructor or
teaching assistant from visiting the
examination room in response to spe
cific prior reports from students that
cheating has been observed, in con
nection with that exam, to investigate
the basis for such reports. The in
structor or teaching assistant may also
visit the examination room briefly
and infrequently in order to answer
students' questions."
