# Financial Aids Office misjudges funds, cuts eligibility
## 
### DAVID RISSER Senior staff writer 
The Financial Aids Office has notified all
federal work-study students and employers
that it is reducing all remaining job eligibility
dollars for spring quarter.
Students whose financial aid arrangements
require them to earn $700 or less this quarter
will have their eligibility cut by 25 percent.
Those who must earn more than $700 during
spring quarter face a reduction to a flat $525.
According to a memorandum sent to all
work-study employers by the Financial Aids
Office, each student with a federal work

study grant has been notified regarding the
exact amount of the new eligibility. Mary
Roberts, assistant director of Financial Aids,
expects that the reduction for most students
will not exceed $100.
The grant funds "make it feasible for all of
us to employ and enjoy part-time undergrad
uate student help otherwise not possible," the
memorandum reads.
The eligibility reduction only applies to the
approximately 270 students who work in Uni
versity offices, libraries and food services un
der the federal work-study program. Students
who hold campus jobs as part of their finan

cial aid packages but are not on federal work
study will not be affected by the decrease in
available funds.
The reduction in grant money does not rep
resent a federal cut in aid, but instead reflects
an overcommitment of funds by the Financial
Aids Office. The overcommitment occurs
every year with the expectation that the situa
tion will correct itself as some students miss
work when they become ill, stop out or go
overseas. This year, however, the annual drop
in demand for federal work-study money
never developed.
"We have not had that attrition this year, so

our formula did not work," Roberts said.
The Financial Aids Office "would like to
see the departments pick up all or a portion of
the remaining dollars not covered by our
grant," according to the memorandum sent to
employers. The office has notified those stu
dents affected by the cuts that University loan
funds will be made available to them if an em
ployer finds it impossible to underwrite the
reduction.
"Nobody will be short resources; it's just a
case of where it will come from," Roberts
said. The Financial Aids Office is committed
to finding a way for all students affected to

make up their deficits, she added.
Freshman Greg Carlson's spring quarter
eligibility was cut from slightly more than
$700 to $525, but his employer, Meyer Li
brary, is willing to transfer enough library
funds to cover the federal work-study reduc
tion.
"It's really no problem for most people in
the library. . . . We can work more and get the
(original) amount of money," Carlson said.
Carlson said that because he probably
would not have worked enough to reach his
original eligibility level, the reduction is "not
a big loss."
