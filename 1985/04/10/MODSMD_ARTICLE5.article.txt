# Med center initiates home care program
## 
### LYNN MARCUS Staff writer 
A new program at the Stanford Hospital will
enable many patients to leave the hospital ear
lier and will provide them with "better continu
ity of care" at lower cost, according to the pro
gram's director.
Kathy Janz, director of the new Home Care
Program, said she is in the process of recruiting
full- and part-time staff for eight positions and
expects to launch the program by May 1.
Janz said the program will provide services to
older patients with chronic heart or lung prob
lems, cancer and fractures. Nurses and nurse's
aides will also visit patients at their homes to
provide pediatric care.
Many of the services to be made available by
the program are currently provided either at
nursing homes or during lengthy hospital stays
which often cost Stanford more than the reim
bursement received from government pro
grams, Janz said.
She said these practices have resulted in
higher costs to the general population through
public expenditures for health care agencies and
high insurance premiums.
In establishing the new program. Stanford is
following a nationwide trend. The number of
hospital-based home care programs has been on
the rise lately, with a 19.5 percent increase
during the last three months of 1984. from 748
to 894.
Janz cited a number of factors contributing to
heightened pressure on hospitals to provide
more outpatient services.
One is the change in reimbursement policies
of government health care agencies since 1983.
MediCal. the state health care program for the
poor, now bases reimbursements on daily rates
negotiated annually with each hospital rather
than on actual costs. Last year's contract paid
20 to 30 percent less than costs, according to the
David Sakai. director of finance at the hospital,
who described the rate negotiated for fiscal
1986 as "barely adequate." The negotiated rate
is confidential.
Also starting in 1983, the government in
stituted a new payment program for Medicare,
the federal health care program for the elderly.
The program reimburses hospitals at a fixed

rate predetermined tor each specific illness cat
egory. Janz anticipated that the bulk of the
patients qualifying for services from the Home
Care Program will be on Medicare.
Janz said the new program "should save
money on the Medicare-MediCal side."
"If we don't save money, we won't have
coverage for anyone over 65," she added. "We
have to save money to preserve the two sys
tems."
In recent years, increased pressure to cut
costs has also come from private insurance com
panies and from competition with other hospi
tals and health care programs, Janz said.
In addition, there is an "increased patient
desire to be at home" while recovering from ill
ness and an "increased awareness" on the part
of patients and members of the hospital com
munity of the services that can be made
available at a patient's home, Janz said.
"We provide rehabilitation or nursing
services that would have been provided (in in
stitutions) but on a visit basis," Janz said. She
stressed that there is a "strong emotional com
ponent" involved in establishing the program
because it is "an alternative to institutionaliza
tion" and allows the patient to be treated in a
familiar and comfortable environment.
In some cases, she said, the effectiveness of
treatment may also be increased. A stroke vic
tim relearning kitchen skills, for example, would
be able to practice using his own refrigerator
and other items in his home environment.
One unusual feature of the program makes
nurses available 24 hours a day through an
answering service and beeper system.
Sheldon King, executive director of the
hospital, said a major advantage of the program
will be the ability to use the hospital's own
"well-trained and experienced nurses."
"We can be sure our patients will receive bet
ter continuity of care"' than they would if nur
sing homes or free-standing home care pro
grams took over patient care after hospitaliza
tion. he said.
The new program will operate out of a space
rented at the Lytton Gardens Nursing Home on
University Avenue in Palo Alto.
