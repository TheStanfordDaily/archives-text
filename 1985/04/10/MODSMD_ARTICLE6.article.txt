# Hunger panel urges student action
## 
### EVELYN UHLIG 
While agreeing that widespread poverty
and the lack of national coherent policies
need to be addressed to reduce long-term
international hunger, three development ex
perts advocated last night different courses
of action to help solve the world hunger
problem.
C. Payne Lucas, the executive director of
Africarc. described the serious environmen
tal problems in Africa and stressed the ur
gent need and value of volunteer work. Re
search is hadlv needed to create specific
policies to reduce poverty and famine, he
said.
Describing Africa as a "demographic
nightmare," Lucas pointed to the need to
acquire more and better information on

population and crop production.
"We still find lots of African nations put
ting in sugar cane factories." Lucas said.
"That's ridiculous, because it's cheaper to
import."
"Africa is truly a nation in trouble," he
said, identifying depletion and irregular dis
tribution of natural resources as a major
problem. Mentioning the dearth of forests as
an example. Lucas said, "Women walk five
to 10 miles a day in search of firewood."
His statement that undergraduates study
ing international development need the op
portunity to serve in Third World nations
drew enthusiastic applause from a Kresge
Auditorium audience of 250.
Walter Falcon, director of the Stanford
Food Research Institute, emphasized the

need for collective action to make national
policies against widespread hunger. "I think
the world is afflicted at the present with a
case of problemitis," Falcon said. He ex
plained that current strategies have created
a host of small programs which attack indi
vidual problems and have failed to develop
comprehensive policies aimed at solving
long-term hunger problems.
He cited food price policy, the use of tech
nology, and economic investments as three
areas which need further analysis. "There is
no cheap way out," he said, adding that
large investments in hunger-stricken nations
arc needed, as inexpensive ways do not exist
for nations to create jobs or food supplies.
Guillermo Arroyave, a professor of
nutrition at San Diego State Univer
sity, discussed the dangerous effects
of malnutrition. Long-term vitamin
deficiencies lead to infections,
psycho-social maladjustment and
learning disabilities, he said.

Problems arise when famine
stricken areas are given food that is
not nutritionally balanced, as the con
sumption of sizeable quantities of
carbohydrates and proteins may
result in other deficiencies. Arroyave
said skim milk powder — at one time
distributed in Africa — exhausted vi
tamin A reserves in malnourished
people and resulted in vitamin A
blindness.

"Malnutrition and hunger should
not be cured, but prevented," Ar
royave said.
Stressing reform of agricultural sys
tems in Central America, Arroyave
noted that the most fertile land
is used to grow export crops, such as
coffee, cotton and marijuana.
"Agricultural practices are in urgent
need of change," Arroyave stated.
