Rebels propose date for peace talks
MEXICO CITY — Dismissing El Salvador's recent elections as
"evident deceit," Salvadoran rebels called yesterday for President Jose
Napoleon Duarte to return to the bargaining table to seek an end to the
country's {jve-year civil war.
In one of two communiques on the subject, the rebels proposed "the
immediate continuation of the dialogue process with a meeting at the
highest level April 21."
An official vote tally from El Salvador's March 31 elections won't be
available until next week, but Duarte's centrist Christian Democratic
Party has claimed victory over a conservative coalition. Its results, based
on pollwatchers' reports, have been accurate in past elections.
The projected results would give Duarte a majority in the National
Assembly for the first time since his inauguration last June 1. He has said
the conservative majority in the current assembly has blocked his in
itiatives, including the peace talks that started with two rounds last fall.
"This excuse no longer exists. Even more, the FDR-FMLN, just as the
majority of observers, believes that a great part of those who voted for
the Christian Democratic Party did it really in favor of dialogue and a
political solution," the rebel statement said.
It was issued by the Democratic Revolutionary, Front, or FDR, which
is the political wing of Salvadoran rebels, and the Farabundo Marti Na
tional Liberation Front, or FMLN, the coalition of five guerrilla groups
fighting the U.S.-supported Salvadoran government.
The groups maintain an office in Mexico City.
Israeli jets strike Lebanese enclave
SHEMLAN, Lebanon — Israeli jets attacked this Chouf Mountain
town at dawn yesterday and destroyed a building the Israeli military
called a PLO headquarters, eight miles southeast of Beirut.
Eight Palestinian and Druse fighters were reported killed in the raid,
Israel's fifth air attack on this year on positions it said were guerrilla out
posts. Israeli military sources in Tel Aviv said the target was a
headquarters for the Popular Struggle Front, a Marxist faction of the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
In southern Lebanon, witnesses said tank-led Israeli armored columns
conducted a search-and-arrest raid in the port of Tyre. The witnesses
said the Israelis seized at least 25 men and hauled them away in a truck
during the raid.
Following the Israeli air raid, a Druse militia commander in Shemlan,
who declined to give his name, told reporters half of those killed were
Palestinian guerrillas and the rest were from Druse leader Walid
Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party militia.
They were killed by a single bomb that destroyed a two-story, white
stone building on Shemlan's eastern outskirts.
It was Israel's closest air strike to Beirut since the 1982 invasion of
Lebanon. At that time, PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's enclave in the
Moslem sector of Beirut was repeatedly attacked by Israeli jets.
In Israel, Prime Minister Shimon Peres told Israel radio the Israeli
raid was a preventive strike. "They acted to prevent a terrorist unit from
acting in the future," he said.
Iraqi planes raid two Iranian cities
BAGHDAD, Iraq — Iraqi planes raided two Iranian cities yesterday,
Iran accused its enemy of using poison gas, and the U.N secretary
general left Baghdad after another fruitless effort to end the war.
Iraq said its jet fighters attacked a tanker in the Persian Gulf, in its
campaign against the oil imports that finance Iran's war effort, but there
was no confirmation from shipping sources.
An Iraqi military spokesman said in a radio broadcast that warplanes
raided Ghilan-e Gharb and Sar-e Pol Zahab as "punishment against the
Iranian regime for its insistence on continuing the war," and such raids
"will go on until the rulers of Iran accept total peace."
Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency confirmed the raids and
said they damaged residential buildings, but gave no casualty reports. It
said Iraqi jets flew over the southern city of Susangerd but were driven
off by antiaircraft fire.
The raids were announced after U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar left Baghdad for New York at the end of a tour that took him
to Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, Iran and Iraq in search of a so
lution to the war.
Perez de Cuellar told reporters at the airport that the gap between the
two belligerents was "as wide as ever," but he was able to "evaluate the
situation." He returned to New York via London.
Suicide mission kills two Israelis
BEIRUT, Lebanon — A car bomb exploded at an Israeli checkpoint
yesterday, and a guerrilla group said a 16-year-old Shiite girl had driven
it on a suicide mission. Israel said two of its soldiers were killed and two
wounded.
The Israeli military command in Tel Aviv said the car arrived from
north of the Israeli lines and exploded at the Bater al-Chouf checkpoint,
15 miles east of the port city of Sidon.
The National Resistance, which has claimed most of the attacks on Is
raeli occupation force in southern Lebanon in recent months, said it was
responsible for the car bombing.
The deaths brought the number of Israelis killed in Lebanon since the
June 1982 invasion to 646. Of those, 42 have died this year.
A caller who said he spoke for the National Resistance telephoned
The Associated Press in Beirut and said Sana Mheidleh crashed a
Peugeot 504 loaded with 440 pounds of explosives into an Israeli patrol,
causing several casualties. The state radio quoted the National Resis
tance later as claiming "about 50" Israelis were killed.
Israeli military sources said the Peugeot passed through a checkpoint
manned by Druse militiamen and joined an Israeli army convoy evacuat
ing equipment from positions in the eastern sector of Lebanon.
The driver set off the explosives when soldiers at an Israeli checkpoint
approached the car to examine it, the sources said.
Israel Radio said the car contained 66-110 pounds of explosives.
Sudanese president stays in Egypt
CAIRO, Egypt — Sudan's ousted president. Gaafar Nimeiri, who
boasted that "no one can remove me from rule" shortly before being
deposed in a coup last weekend, may well end up as a political refugee in
Egypt.
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt has made clear he will play host to
Nimeiri for as long as the 55-year-old army general, a close ally of Egypt
during his 16-year reign, wants to stay.
Egypt also has granted asylum in the last 20 years to three Middle
East monarchs — Saudi Arabia's King Saud, King Idriss Senussi of
Libya and Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi of Iran, all dead now.
A military coup in Sudan on Saturday, following a popular uprising
and general strike, ended Nimeiri's regime. He learned of the coup in
Cairo, where he stopped cn route home from a nine-day visit to the
United States that began on March 27.
"I am still the president, and no one can remove me from rule,"
Nimeiri was quoted as telling the Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat in
an interview during his Washington visit. "The disturbances are only a
transient matter."
Although he said that Nimeiri could stay in Egypt as long as he
wanted, Mubarak quickly moved to emphasize that Egypt's relations
with Sudan transcend personal considerations.
"We support any government in Sudan if the people want it,"
Mubarak told reporters on Sunday. "We do not interfere in Sudan's in
ternal affairs."
Mubarak also disclosed that he had been in touch with the leaders
"since the first communique'' announcing the coup. "Our relations with
them are very good." he added.

Iranian regime for its insistence on continuing the war," and such raids
"will go on until the rulers of Iran accept total peace."
Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency confirmed the raids and
said they damaged residential buildings, but gave no casualty reports. It
said Iraqi jets flew over the southern city of Susangerd but were driven
off by antiaircraft fire.
The raids were announced after U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar left Baghdad for New York at the end of a tour that took him
to Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, Iran and Iraq in search of a so
lution to the war.
Perez de Cuellar told reporters at the airport that the gap between the
two belligerents was "as wide as ever," but he was able to "evaluate the
situation." He returned to New York via London.
Suicide mission kills two Israelis
BEIRUT, Lebanon — A car bomb exploded at an Israeli checkpoint
yesterday, and a guerrilla group said a 16-year-old Shiite girl had driven
it on a suicide mission. Israel said two of its soldiers were killed and two
wounded.
The Israeli military command in Tel Aviv said the car arrived from
north of the Israeli lines and exploded at the Bater al-Chouf checkpoint,
15 miles east of the port city of Sidon.
The National Resistance, which has claimed most of the attacks on Is
raeli occupation force in southern Lebanon in recent months, said it was
responsible for the car bombing.
The deaths brought the number of Israelis killed in Lebanon since the
June 1982 invasion to 646. Of those, 42 have died this year.
A caller who said he spoke for the National Resistance telephoned
The Associated Press in Beirut and said Sana Mheidleh crashed a
Peugeot 504 loaded with 440 pounds of explosives into an Israeli patrol,
causing several casualties. The state radio quoted the National Resis
tance later as claiming "about 50" Israelis were killed.
Israeli military sources said the Peugeot passed through a checkpoint
manned by Druse militiamen and joined an Israeli army convoy evacuat
ing equipment from positions in the eastern sector of Lebanon.
The driver set off the explosives when soldiers at an Israeli checkpoint
approached the car to examine it, the sources said.
Israel Radio said the car contained 66-110 pounds of explosives.
Sudanese president stays in Egypt
CAIRO, Egypt — Sudan's ousted president. Gaafar Nimeiri, who
boasted that "no one can remove me from rule" shortly before being
deposed in a coup last weekend, may well end up as a political refugee in
Egypt.
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt has made clear he will play host to
Nimeiri for as long as the 55-year-old army general, a close ally of Egypt
during his 16-year reign, wants to stay.
Egypt also has granted asylum in the last 20 years to three Middle
East monarchs — Saudi Arabia's King Saud, King Idriss Senussi of
Libya and Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi of Iran, all dead now.
A military coup in Sudan on Saturday, following a popular uprising
and general strike, ended Nimeiri's regime. He learned of the coup in
Cairo, where he stopped cn route home from a nine-day visit to the
United States that began on March 27.
"I am still the president, and no one can remove me from rule,"
Nimeiri was quoted as telling the Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat in
an interview during his Washington visit. "The disturbances are only a
transient matter."
Although he said that Nimeiri could stay in Egypt as long as he
wanted, Mubarak quickly moved to emphasize that Egypt's relations
with Sudan transcend personal considerations.
"We support any government in Sudan if the people want it,"
Mubarak told reporters on Sunday. "We do not interfere in Sudan's in
ternal affairs."
Mubarak also disclosed that he had been in touch with the leaders
"since the first communique'' announcing the coup. "Our relations with
them are very good." he added.
Rebels propose date for peace talks
MEXICO CITY — Dismissing El Salvador's recent elections as
"evident deceit," Salvadoran rebels called yesterday for President Jose
Napoleon Duarte to return to the bargaining table to seek an end to the
country's {jve-year civil war.
In one of two communiques on the subject, the rebels proposed "the
immediate continuation of the dialogue process with a meeting at the
highest level April 21."
An official vote tally from El Salvador's March 31 elections won't be
available until next week, but Duarte's centrist Christian Democratic
Party has claimed victory over a conservative coalition. Its results, based
on pollwatchers' reports, have been accurate in past elections.
The projected results would give Duarte a majority in the National
Assembly for the first time since his inauguration last June 1. He has said
the conservative majority in the current assembly has blocked his in
itiatives, including the peace talks that started with two rounds last fall.
"This excuse no longer exists. Even more, the FDR-FMLN, just as the
majority of observers, believes that a great part of those who voted for
the Christian Democratic Party did it really in favor of dialogue and a
political solution," the rebel statement said.
It was issued by the Democratic Revolutionary, Front, or FDR, which
is the political wing of Salvadoran rebels, and the Farabundo Marti Na
tional Liberation Front, or FMLN, the coalition of five guerrilla groups
fighting the U.S.-supported Salvadoran government.
The groups maintain an office in Mexico City.
Israeli jets strike Lebanese enclave
SHEMLAN, Lebanon — Israeli jets attacked this Chouf Mountain
town at dawn yesterday and destroyed a building the Israeli military
called a PLO headquarters, eight miles southeast of Beirut.
Eight Palestinian and Druse fighters were reported killed in the raid,
Israel's fifth air attack on this year on positions it said were guerrilla out
posts. Israeli military sources in Tel Aviv said the target was a
headquarters for the Popular Struggle Front, a Marxist faction of the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
In southern Lebanon, witnesses said tank-led Israeli armored columns
conducted a search-and-arrest raid in the port of Tyre. The witnesses
said the Israelis seized at least 25 men and hauled them away in a truck
during the raid.
Following the Israeli air raid, a Druse militia commander in Shemlan,
who declined to give his name, told reporters half of those killed were
Palestinian guerrillas and the rest were from Druse leader Walid
Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party militia.
They were killed by a single bomb that destroyed a two-story, white
stone building on Shemlan's eastern outskirts.
It was Israel's closest air strike to Beirut since the 1982 invasion of
Lebanon. At that time, PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's enclave in the
Moslem sector of Beirut was repeatedly attacked by Israeli jets.
In Israel, Prime Minister Shimon Peres told Israel radio the Israeli
raid was a preventive strike. "They acted to prevent a terrorist unit from
acting in the future," he said.
Iraqi planes raid two Iranian cities
BAGHDAD, Iraq — Iraqi planes raided two Iranian cities yesterday,
Iran accused its enemy of using poison gas, and the U.N secretary
general left Baghdad after another fruitless effort to end the war.
Iraq said its jet fighters attacked a tanker in the Persian Gulf, in its
campaign against the oil imports that finance Iran's war effort, but there
was no confirmation from shipping sources.

raided Ghilan-e Gharb and Sar-e Pol Zahab as "punishment against the
