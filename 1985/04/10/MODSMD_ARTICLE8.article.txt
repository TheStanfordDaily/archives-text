# Japan to open foreign market
## 
### 
TOKYO â€” Japan announced a three-year plan
yesterday to open its markets to foreign products.
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone urged his
people to buy imported goods, saying a trade war.
would bring economic disaster upon them.
No quick results were expected from the
Japanese plan, and initial reaction from the United
States was muted. Congress, frustrated by a $37
billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan in 1984, has
demanded the United States retaliate if Japan does
not ease trade barriers.
The Japanese also stressed the need to reduce
the dollar's value against the yen, which contributes
to the trade imbalance by making Japanese prod
ucts cheaper to the consumer and U.S. goods more
expensive.
Japan's three-year program deals with telecom
munications, electronics and other major trade
areas of most concern to the United States.
Nakasone urged the Japanese, in a nationally
televised speech and news conference after the pro
gram was announced, to "please buy foreign prod
ucts."
He said Japan must move rapidly toward freer

trade because "terrible depression and unemploy
ment" would result if such trading partners as the
United States took protectionist measures. Japan
has few natural resources and it* economy is built
on industrial exports.
Japan had an overall trade surplus of $44-.2 bil
lion last year, $36.8 billion of it with the United
States. Congress has called for sanctions unless
Japan makes it easier for American goods to enter
its markets and redress the balance.
The report on "external economic measures"
issued yesterday includes the plan to open markets
and says an outline of the program will be com
pleted by July.
In the package are pledges to accept foreign
clinical test data for medical equipment, eventually
to lower tariffs on plywood products, to simplify
technical standards for computer equipment and to
ease the way for the purchase of American commu
nications satellites.
It also promises greater freedom for foreign
lawyers to practice in Japan, another U.S. demand;
more Japanese aid to developing nations, and at
tention to the interests of Southeast Asia and

Europe in future tariff cuts.
The United States sees telecommunications,'
electronics, medical supplies and products
as areas in which American companies could com
pete successfully if they were let into the market.
The prime minister stressed the urgency of the
trade issue with a candor that is rare in Japanese
politicians.
He called on "every one of our citizens to please
buy foreign products." He said that if each of
Japan's 120 million people bought $100 worth of
foreign goods, the trade surplus could be cut by $ 12
billion.
Nakasone, 66, used charts and graphs to illus
trate his argument that Japan's tariffs are among
the lowest in the world but that the Japanese
people spend far less per person than Americans
and Europeans on foreign manufactured goods.
He praised President Reagan for defending free
trade, and said it was his "intense desire that noth
ing happen to injure the foundation of friendly
U.S.-Japan relations."
