# Bradley wins

### 
LOS ANGELES — Tom Bradley,
the son of Texas sharecroppers and
grandson of slaves, made history yes
terday becoming the first Los An
geles mayor elected to four full terms.
Bradley's chief opponent, Council
man John Ferraro, conceded the race
when about 24 percent of the vote
had been counted. Of the city's 2,367
precincts, 572 had been counted,
showing him with 37,965 votes, or 32
percent, of the vote to Bradley's
77,435, or 65.8 percent.
"Not all is lost. I ran a good cam
paign. I can hold my head high," Fer
raro, 60, told supporters at the Wil
shire Hyatt Hotel after calling Brad
ley to congratulate him. "We brought
before the people of Los Angeles
some important issues that needed to
be discussed."
With the majority of the votes out
standing, Bradley predicted he would
win "with the greatest margin of vic
tory in the history of the city."
He won his third term in 1981,
thwarting former Mayor Sam Yorty's
attempt at a comeback by a 64-32
percent margin.
"Los Angeles has made history
tonight. You have shown (what) this
great and culturally diverse city can
do," the mayor told supporters at the
Biltmore Hotel.
The apparent victory yesterday
also put the 67-year-old mayor in a
good position to again try to become
California's first black governor.
Bradley ran for governor in 1982 but
lost to Gov. George Deukmejian.
Ferraro had accused Bradley of want
ing to be re-elected just to position

himself for a gubernatorial race, but
Bradley said he had no such plans.
In the 3rd Council District, with 68
of 194 precincts counted, incumbent
Joy Picus, who drew the ire of a Re
publican opponent by getting an en
dorsement from President Reagan's
daughter Maureen, was far ahead of
her five challengers. She had 7,437
votes, or 55.2 percent, well above the
50 percent margin needed to avoid a
runoff.
However, Councilwoman Peggy
Stevenson's vote count fell below that
margin, in early returns. She had
2,184 votes, or 44 percent, to 1,633
or 33 percent for the nearest of her
five challengers, Mike Woo.
Voters were handily approving a
charter amendment to impose strict
limits on city campaign contributions,
with 78 percent saying yes to 22 per
cent no. But a measure that would ex
pand the council by two members,
from 15 to 17, was losing, with 67
percent of the voters opposed and 33
percent in favor.
The hotly contested city attorney's
race remained close with 24 percent
of the vote counted. City Controller
James Kenneth Hahn had 60,144
votes, or 52 percent, to 46,014, or 40
percent, for attorney Lisa Specht,
who hoped to keep Hahn from get
ting 50 percent of the overall vote
and force him into a runoff.
Three other candidates who
dropped out of the race but remained
on the ballot captured the rest of the
vote.
Specht expressed confidence there
would be a runoff, Hahn that he
would win outrieht.
