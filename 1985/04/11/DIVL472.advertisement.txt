Cornell faculty members. The curriculum in
cludes computer science, fine arts, pre-law and
pre-med studies, and languages. Sign up for a
few weeks or the entire summer. Courses are
offered in three-, six-, and eight-week sessions.
A great adventure. Explore beautiful lakes
and parks, spectacular waterfalls and ravines.
Enjoy swimming, sailing, tennis, golf, climbing,
camping, soaring, biking, birding, and hiking. A
