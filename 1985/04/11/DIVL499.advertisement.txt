I WHO DOES YOUR
CHECKING ACCOUNT
BELONG TO?
YOU?
OR YOUR BANK?
It's your money. California Federal asks, why
should you have to pay your bank every time you
use your money? Are you charged every time you
write a check for your money? Are you charged
every time you withdraw your money? Or every
time you use their automated teller? After all, whose
checking account is it?
It's your checking account. At Cal Fed there is
no per check charge, no check-writing limit, and no
charge for using our 24-hour automated tellers.
There's not even a monthly fee when you maintain
a low minimum balance. At Cal Fed your checking
account is your checking account.
Open yours today. It pays to check with us.
