# McFarlane: a meeting or a summit?
## 
### 
SANTA BARBARA — In an
abrupt shift, the White House said
yesterday that President Reagan is
ready now for a get-acquainted
"meeting" with Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, but that a problem
solving "summit" would require
more preparation and must offer the
promise of success.
For weeks, top administration offi
cials have used the terms "summit"
and "meeting" interchangeably.
Robert McFarlane, Reagan's national
security adviser, sought to put an end
to that practice as he briefed
reporters at a hotel 25 miles from the
vacationing president's ranch.

The administration's sudden insis
tence on a distinction between the
two terms clearly was an attempt to
dampen expectations of real im
provement in U.S.-Soviet relations
flowing from a Reagan-Gorbachev
conference.
Reading a written statement
television cameras, McFarlane said,
"The president has stressed that he
would welcome a meeting with the
general secretary. We would also
welcome a summit at the proper time
and as the culmination of an extended
dialogue which has produced tangible
accomplishment.
"There is no predicting how long

this process could take," he said. "It
could be this year."
McFarlane said Reagan was ready
for a get-acquainted meeting with
Gorbachev on short notice but played
down the likelihood that would occur
in the near future.
The national security adviser said,
"The president believes that the
climate of the relationship is such as
to justify a meeting now and for the
foreseeable future, absent any He
matic change in Soviet attitudes."
He said there would not have to be
a specific agenda for a meetng.
A senior administration official,
speaking on condition he not be iden

tified, said a Reagan-Gorbachev
meeting in New York would be likely
this fall if the Soviet leader attended
the opening of the U.N. General As
sembly. "It would be my best guess"
that they would meet then, the offi
cial said.
Any conference — meeting or
summit — would have to offer
prospect of a serious exchange 01
views and not give Gorbachev a
propaganda forum, the official added.
In weighing whether to agree to a
meeting or summit, the United States
will take into account the tone of So
viet rhetoric and of the Geneva arms
negotiations, the official said.
