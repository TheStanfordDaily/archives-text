Arms exporters indicted
NEW YORK — Four U.S. arms dealers were
indicted yesterday on charges they tried to il
legally export more than $12 million in military
equipment, including rifles to Poland and night
vision goggles to help Argentina against Britain
in the Falklands war.
"The indictment gives us a rare look inside the
business of dealing in illegal arms and military
equipment," U.S. Attorney Raymond Dearie
said at a news conference.
"These international operations have nothing
to do with political philosophy, national interests
or ideology," he said. "It is a matter of money."
He said the indictment represents the first time
that racketeering charges have been used by the
government against suspected illegal arms
dealers.
The 14-count indictment also charged the four
with violating arms export laws.
Dearie said that between 1982 and 1984 the
four plotted illegal shipments of 100 automatic
weapons and 100,000 rounds of ammunition,
worth more than $1 million, to Poland; 1,300
night-vision goggles, worth more than $8 million,
to Argentina; 400 more of the goggles, worth
more than $3 million, to the Soviet Union via
West Germany; and 110 boxes of small arms and
ammunition, worth more than $250,000, to Iraq.
Only the Argentine purchase reached its des
tination, federal officials said. In the Soviet case,
the sale was actually negotiated by federal agents
posing as Soviet operatives, Dearie said.
IRS tries to catch up
WASHINGTON — The head of the Internal
Revenue Service promised yesterday that most

Americans will get their federal tax refunds on
time and angrily disputed allegations that over
worked employees had destroyed tax returns.
"Sheer, utter nonsense," IRS Commissioner
Roscoe Egger said of reports that workers in the
Philadelphia return-processing were so harried
by production quotas that they had shredded
some returns. "We have no evidence of that kind
of thing," he told a news conference, adding that
if somebody will present such evidence, the guilty
employees will be prosecuted "so fast it'll make
your head swim."
Troubles with a new SIO3 million computer
system installed late last year in the service
centers have dramatically slowed the processing
of returns this year. Egger said most of the bugs
have been worked out, and in most cases, returns
that are filed by the deadline next Monday mid
night and that result in a refund will be processed
by the end of May.
The agency has a lot of catching up to do. It
already is sitting on a backlog of 23.3 million un
processed returns, compared with fewer than 15
million at the same time last year.
Nazi group squelched
SEATTLE — A violent neo-Nazi group that
has been linked to the slaying of a Denver radio
talk show host and two armored truck holdups
worth more than $4 million is now mostly in jail,
federal officials say.
An investigation of the group that called itself
The Order began late last year and has produced
the arrests of 24 group members and close as
sociates in 13 states, officials say.
The group's founder died in a Dec. 7 shootout
with the FBI; his reputed successor is in custody.
No more than half a dozen followers are still at

large, officials add. A racketeering indictment
naming many or all of those named so far could
come next week, the government lawyer in
charge of the investigation said.
Members of The Order have been linked by
the FBI to the June 18 slaying of Denver radio
talk show host Alan Berg, a Jew and frequently
caustic critic of right-wing groups, and to "virtual
carbon-copy" armored truck holdups that netted
$3.6 million in Ukiah on July 19 and $500,000 in
Seattle on April 23, all during 1984.
In recent congressional testimony, FBI Direc
tor William Webster cited The Order as an exam
ple of a growing danger of terrorism on the right.
lUD, infertility link told
BOSTON — Using an intrauterine device for
birth control seems to double the risk of infer
tility, and 88,000 U.S. couples may be unable to
have children because of damage from lUDs,
new research finds.
The authors of two major studies being pub
lished today recommend that women who have
never had children should not have these devices
inserted but should choose some other form of
contraception.
Earlier studies have shown that women who
use lUDs face a higher than usual risk of pelvic
inflammatory disease. This infection can damage
the Fallopian tubes and cause infertility. The new
studies, however, are the first to show a direct
link between lUDs and infertility.
According to the National Center for Health
Statistics, an estimated 2.2 million American
women use lUDs. They are the fourth most com
mon form of contraception after voluntary
sterilization, birth control pills and condoms.

The Order began late last year and has produced
the arrests of 24 group members and close as
sociates in 13 states, officials say.
The group's founder died in a Dec. 7 shootout
with the FBI; his reputed successor is in custody.
No more than half a dozen followers are still at

large, officials add. A racketeering indictment
naming many or all of those named so far could
come next week, the government lawyer in
charge of the investigation said.
Members of The Order have been linked by
the FBI to the June 18 slaying of Denver radio
talk show host Alan Berg, a Jew and frequently
caustic critic of right-wing groups, and to "virtual
carbon-copy" armored truck holdups that netted
$3.6 million in Ukiah on July 19 and $500,000 in
Seattle on April 23, all during 1984.
In recent congressional testimony, FBI Direc
tor William Webster cited The Order as an exam
ple of a growing danger of terrorism on the right.
lUD, infertility link told
BOSTON — Using an intrauterine device for
birth control seems to double the risk of infer
tility, and 88,000 U.S. couples may be unable to
have children because of damage from lUDs,
new research finds.
The authors of two major studies being pub
lished today recommend that women who have
never had children should not have these devices
inserted but should choose some other form of
contraception.
Earlier studies have shown that women who
use lUDs face a higher than usual risk of pelvic
inflammatory disease. This infection can damage
the Fallopian tubes and cause infertility. The new
studies, however, are the first to show a direct
link between lUDs and infertility.
According to the National Center for Health
Statistics, an estimated 2.2 million American
women use lUDs. They are the fourth most com
mon form of contraception after voluntary
sterilization, birth control pills and condoms.
