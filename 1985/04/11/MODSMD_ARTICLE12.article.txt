Marijuana cargo seized
SAN FRANCISCO — More than 32 tons of
marijuana, with an estimated value of up to $195
million, was discovered on a battered fishing boat
after it was stopped for a routine safety check,
federal authorities reported yesterday.
"It's the biggest (West Coast) haul any of us
can recall," said U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency
Agent and Public Affairs Officer Bob Cox, estimat
ing the street value of the contraband, believed to
have originated in Thailand, at $2,000 to $3,000
a pound.
U.S. Customs Special Agent Tom McDermott
said investigators suspect that a "mother ship"
off the coast unloaded the 65,000-pound cargo of
foil-wrapped marijuana bales onto the Oregon
Beaver, a 76-foot fishing boat out of Coos Bay,
Ore.
The Beaver cruised into San Francisco Bay
about 6:30 p.m. Tuesday, and was directed by
the Coast Guard crew on the Cutter Point Chico
to tie up at nearby Pier 45 for a safety check, said
Chief Petty Officer John Hollis.
"They were going to do a routine safety in
spection, and while they were doing that, they un
covered the marijuana," Hollis said.
"It was all over the place." said Hollis, explain
ing that pot was found in the engine room, the
boat's hold and several other locations.
After the vessel was searched, the Coast Guard
escorted it to Yerba Buena Island in the middle
of the bay. Its cargo was examined and unloaded
yesterday by federal agents, who were continuing
their investigation.
The boat's six-man crew was arrested and held
at San Francisco County Jail without bail, pend
ing review of the case by the U.S. Attorney's Of

fice's Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task
Force.
Bradley nixes bid gossip
LOS ANGELES — Mayor Tom Bradley,
newly re-elected to an historic fourth term,
savored his resounding victory yesterday and
refused to be goaded into speculation about his
future in politics.
Reporters bombarded him with questions
about the governorship, a job Bradley, 67, nar
rowly missed in a duel with George Deukmejian
in 1982, but he repeatedly turned them aside.
"I guess I can't make it clear, but I've tried,"
he said in exasperation at his news confer
ence yesterday. "No, I'm not planning on
running for governor. You've interpreted that in
many ways— feel free to do so this morning."
The grinning Bradley said he wanted to bury
the hatchet with his only serious challenger, John
Ferraro, 60, and "get on with the business of
building this city."
With all precincts reporting, Bradley garnered
297,172 votes or 67.66 percent of the ballots
cast. Ferraro drew 133,923 votes or 30.49 per
cent. None of the seven other candidates whose
names appeared on the ballot mustered even 1
percent of the vote.
Tank trashes freeway
BARSTOW — An Army tank on a dirt road
beneath Interstate 15 destroyed one freeway
support and severely damaged two others last
night, forcing traffic to be rerouted indefinitely,
the California Highway Patrol said.

The accident occurred between 7 and 7:30
p.m. after the tank was unloaded from a train,
CHP Officer Daniel Laza said. It apparently was
headed for the Army s national training center at
nearby Fort Irwin.
"The tank was driving underneath the over
crossing," Laza said. "It knocked out one pillar
completely and severely damaged two others."
California condor dies
LOS ANGELES — A wild California condor
died yesterday after being found ailing on a
Sierra foothill ranch — another blow to efforts to
save the endangered species of giant birds from
extinction.
"This is significant. It's one less condor out
there. California Department or Fish and Game
spokesman Ralph Young said of the death of the
bird on a ranch 30 miles southeast of Porterville.
No more than 1" of the birds, including five
breeding pairs, were known to exist in the wild
last year. The program to save the birds, which
are included on the federal endangered species
list, suffered a major setback when scientists last
month said they were unable to locate three of
the breeding pairs.
oung said it was not immediately known if
the bird found on the ranch was among those
previously identified, since it was not tagged.
Today's weather
There will be fog or low clouds this morning,
with clearing later in the day. Highs will be in the
lower 70s. Afternoon winds will range from 15 to
25 mph. The picture will be much the same to
morrow, with highs in the upper 70s.
