## Instant answers for dating questions 
### JASON COLE Editorial staff 
Tomorrow night, many people will
be faced with a dilemma. The prob
lem will make them sweat, worry, grit
their teeth and bite their nails. They'll
ask friends for help, but the friends
will just tease them because they're
so nervous.
Tomorrow night, many people will
have to decide what to do on a date.
In an attempt to make that deci
sion easier, two Stanford graduates
have designed the Insta-Date Kit. For

$4.95, it doesn't go so far as to pro
vide you with a date, but it does do
everything else, from deciding what to
talk about to where to go to dinner to
what to do at the end of the night (or
"The Grand Finale").
The kit is an invention of Mark
Breier, who is currently a Stanford
business school student, and Jeff
Pinsker, a 1983 graduate in econom
ics. Breier came up with the idea
three years ago at a Christmas party
hosted by Amazing Events Inc., a
creative entertainment firm that he
founded with several other Stanford
graduates in 1981.
The idea wasn't a spur of the mo
ment one, but a premeditated effort
to impress a woman he had met at the
party. "I was trying to come up with
some idea about how I could surprise
her and still be surprised myself. I had
this invisible ink pen lying around,
and eventually came up with the
original Insta-Date Kit."

The idea worked perfectly, Breier
said, "We ended up going to the
Acapulco for drinks, and we had
some great conversation topics, in
cluding a classic blooper: 'Discuss
everything you know about dental
hygiene.' Actually, she's a dental
hygiene freak, and so she got really
excited about it and just took off for
the next 20 minutes.
"I am still dating the same girl," he
said.
The kit covers six stages during the
date. It determines where to go for
drinks, what to talk about over
drinks, where to go for dinner, what
to talk about over dinner (two con
versation topics are given), what to
do for after-dinner entertainment and
then "The Grand Finale."
At each stage, a couple is given
eight numbered options (except "The
Grand Finale," which has six). The
option is uncovered with a "mystery
pen" (which develops the invisible
ink) and a couple is told what to do,
talk about or go to.
Like its two developers, the kit is
both serious and tongue-and-cheek.
Dinner options range from fine local
restaurants to casual restaurants to
buying TV dinners. Conversations
subjects can be serious or can
"describe the time you were most in
ebriated." Grand finale subjects re
quire parental judgement, and thus
should not be described in this article.
It even includes a chance to win an
all-expenses-paid night in San Fran

cisco for the best answer to the ques
tion, "What happened at your Grand
Finale?" "We're looking for an inter
esting answer, even if it didn't actu
ally happen. We encourage lying,"
Breier said.
Versions of the kit are made for the
San Francisco area and the Mid-
Peninsula area. Breier and Pinsker
began marketing the kit on
Valentine's Day and have sold ap
proximately 1,000 to more than 65
merchants along the Peninsula.
Generally, we're pleased, but it's a
matter of getting sales up to par,"

Breier said. Pinsker added that
"people need to be educated as to
what it really is."
The kit took two years to develop,
during which time the two refined the
conversation topics and chose the
places for drinks and dinner. They
helped finance the kit by getting the
restaurants and bars to pay for listings
in the kit. The establishments were
also chosen because none require
reservations.
The idea has taken off throughout
the media with features in

newspapers (reaching as far as The
Times of London, according to
Breier), radio stations and television
programs. A woman in Toronto actu
ally bought one of the kits and asked
when a version for that city would be
available.
"Eventually, we'll start marketing
in more areas," Pinsker said. In the
meantime, neither is worried about
someone else copying the idea. The
idea is copyrighted and even if some
body tries to copy it"the technology
is pretty hard to find," according to
Pinsker.
