## The

						Daily recommends: Council of Presidents 
### 
The recent history of student government at
Stanford University has been anything but admi
rable.
Example: In 1982, Council of Presidents
(COP) member Fred Buhl had his executive au
thority revoked by his three fellow COP mem
bers. Buhl in turn claimed that the COP was act
ing unconstitutionally. A COP slate in the spring
election petitioned to get the election invalidated
on grounds of procedural irregularities.
Numerous senators charged that Graduate
Senator Jim McGrath was exercising almost un
limited power over the senate from the throne of
the rules committee chairmanship. The senate of
ten conducted five-hour meetings that turned
into bitter battles over bylaw changes.
Example: This year, several ASSU senators
have quit. COP member Alice Wells resigned.
Numerous senators charged Senate Chair Eric
Berg and the ever-present McGrath with need
lessly blocking senate business. Several student
groups claimed that the senate had mangled their
fee assessment requests. Senate meetings were
characterized by persona! acrimony and bureau
cratic obstructionism.
Some of us on The Daily Editorial Board have
followed the irresponsible actions of the ASSU
for four years now. We have been to senate
meetings that last hours yet accomplish little.
We have repeatedly heard ASSU candidates
promise to streamline the ASSU bureaucracy,
end internal bickering and restore student confi
dence in the governmental system. Yet year after
year, the ASSU limps along as before, wasting
time and wasting money while achieving nothing.
The ASSU senate oversees a budget of $ 1 million
a year; but does anyone know what the senate
does, aside from bickering about bylaws and
obstructing student groups?
In short, we have become disillusioned with the
current student governmental system at Stanford.
We are tired of listening to ambitious plans for
San Francisco shuttles, pizzerias at the boathouse
and big-name concerts that never materialize.
We are tired of hearing lifeless, alliterative rheto
ric from resume-padders who stress their dedica

tion to such amorphous goals as "accessibility"
and "cooperation."
The Daily Editorial Board has unanimously
decided that Stanford student government needs
a radical change. Given this imperative, we feel
that the Hammer & Coffin slate offers a creative
alternative to the current stultifying status quo.
The H & C slate wants to disband the ASSU
senate and replace it with a smaller, restructured
organization dedicated to serve, not regulate,
campus groups. The slate members promise to
donate the $16,000 they will receive as COP
members to the ASSU general fund.
The H & C slate's plans for a public service or
ganization to replace the senate seem logical and
practical to us. Admittedly, the H & C slate
members will have to work hard to achieve these
major changes; the ASSU will probably need a
new constitution. However, we believe that the
H & C slate will preside ably over the difficult
transition period. Already it is starting to
plan the precise series of steps needed to ac
complish its goals.
We know that the Chappie slate has tradition
ally been entered as a joke, and the current
slate's somewhat flippant statement in the elec
tion handbook at first glance appears to affirm
this view. However, we are convinced that the
H & C slate is serious this year. Andy Frisch, Mi
chael Collins, Leslie Leland and Tim Quirk are
intelligent, articulate individuals who impressed
us with their dedication to restructure the
deservedly maligned ASSU.
At best, the current ASSU is ineffective and
useless; at worst, it is counterproductive and
wasteful. The H & C slate is the only COP slate
that promises a definitive change in student
policy.
We hope that all students equally disillusioned
with the recent conduct of the ASSU will take the
dramatic step of repudiating the current system
by voting for Hammer & Coffin. As this year's
debacle illustrates, the ASSU can no longer be
"streamlined," patched and improved; it must be
dismantled and replaced.
