# ASSU Senate
## 
### 
When you look at our senate endorsements
below, you will see that we have endorsed only
seven undergraduates and one graduate for the
20 voting seats available in next year's ASSU
Senate. That is no simple error of arithmetic.
Rather, of the 29 candidates who met with us last
weekend, only these eight struck us as the sort of
people needed to take the ASSU through a time
of what should be radical change.
Why these eight? That question is answered
below on an individual basis. Why not the other
21? That answer is a little more complicated.
Virtually all the candidates said, to varying
degrees, that the current behavior of the ASSU
Senate falls short of what should be expected.
"The senate has a tremendously horrible image,"
said one. "The biggest problem with student gov
ernment here is that it's not representing the stu
dents," added another.
The responses to the senate's inefficiencies this
year varied. Some wanted to disband the senate.
Some wanted to "streamline" the senate. One
said, "Increase the number of senators to in
crease accountability." Another said, "Decrease
the number of senators to increase accoun
tability."
But of all these would-be reformers among the
23 first-time senate hopefuls, only nine had actu
ally gone to a senate meeting. So when one candi
date told us he could "work very well within the
system," we had to wonder. How could he know
if he had never seen the system work?
Another striking fact about this year's crop of
candidates was the shortage of ideas among
them. Last year, we heard over and over about a
shuttle bus to San Francisco, a deader Dead
Week, photo ID cards, better food service and
the like. Certainly, there were a few of the stan
dard pie-in-the-sky ideas this time, but most can
didates were interested only in getting elected
and working with the system. It's hard to decide
what to make out of that. Either the candidates
have simply given up after watching previous
senates fail to produce concrete results on these
standard campaign topics, or they realize that the
problems with the ASSU itself are so great that
they can't hope to actually accomplish anything.
So why not the 21? In most cases, they showed
either little knowledge of the ASSU or little ef
fort to learn, either no desire to change the sys
tem or a desire without a plan, or — worse yet —
a proven track record of working against the stu
dent interest within the ASSU. Only the follow
ing eight candidates truly impressed us.
Michael Tuchin
This sophomore psychology major knows just
how bad the ASSU Senate can be; he suffered
through the fee assessment process this year,
watching as his Axe Committee budget was
hacked illogically into two separate parts. Tuchin,
who says he has suffered "sheer frustration" with
this year's senate, wants to give students more
opportunities to vote on issues which affect them.
Jeff Soukup
ASSU incumbents had a hard time getting The
Daily's endorsement this year; they had to

defend the actions— or inaction, as the case may
be — of this year's senate and Council of Presi
dents. But this junior international relations
major has something to show for himself after a
year in the senate. He is one of only four under
graduate senators who actually attended all the
senate meetings, and he has the respect of many
of those who have worked with him.
Joel Bellenson
This junior in biology and international relations
has proven himself a go-getter in the world of
student activities. He has worked in political
campaigns, led the Hillel in social action and
coordinated a soon-to-happen benefit concert for
East Africa. His concern for social issues could
make him the conscience of the senate.
Kimberly Denend
Denend wonders why the thinking that has
brought about the "unprecedented innovations"
for which Stanford is famous can't prevail in the
ASSU Senate. We do too. She attributes the sen
ate's problems to a "unadventurous, close
minded, stifling atmosphere," and she is willing
to take some chances to change that.
Ed Renwick
This freshman sees the senate for what it has
been: "an attitude of indifference and individual
senators' involvement in petty power battles."
Renwick is ready to rise above the often-cited
bickering and bylaws to actualy accomplish
something in the senate. He says he will devote
himself to "fiscal accountability . . . student ser
vice needs, and the establishment of a creative,
responsive and dedicated student government."
Charles Hokanson
This sophomore recognizes that the senate is
facing a crisis. "Either change it or get rid of it,"
he says. "We can rebuild the senate to an effec
tive legislative body, one that is responsive to stu
dent needs. One that is effective in dealing with
problems facing the University community.
These are the things I, if elected, will fight to in
troduce," Hokanson says, and he has the energy
and enthusiasm to do it.
Larry Bloch
Although this junior has never been to a senate
meeting, he has done his homework. He has
already begun preliminary work on a fall quarter
activities day that would allow Stanford clubs and
social organizations to show what they have to of
fer to potentially interested students. This sort of
one-person initiative is something that has been
missing in this year's senate,
Brita Jaffee
Only a handful of the graduate senators sched
uled interviews with us, and of those, only Jaffee
truly impressed us. A graduate student in history,
Jaffee can provide a much-needed voice for
graduate-student concerns in the senate.

facing a crisis. "Either change it or get rid of it,"
he says. "We can rebuild the senate to an effec
tive legislative body, one that is responsive to stu
dent needs. One that is effective in dealing with
problems facing the University community.
These are the things I, if elected, will fight to in
troduce," Hokanson says, and he has the energy
and enthusiasm to do it.
Larry Bloch
Although this junior has never been to a senate
meeting, he has done his homework. He has
already begun preliminary work on a fall quarter
activities day that would allow Stanford clubs and
social organizations to show what they have to of
fer to potentially interested students. This sort of
one-person initiative is something that has been
missing in this year's senate,
Brita Jaffee
Only a handful of the graduate senators sched
uled interviews with us, and of those, only Jaffee
truly impressed us. A graduate student in history,
Jaffee can provide a much-needed voice for
graduate-student concerns in the senate.
When you look at our senate endorsements
below, you will see that we have endorsed only
seven undergraduates and one graduate for the
20 voting seats available in next year's ASSU
Senate. That is no simple error of arithmetic.
Rather, of the 29 candidates who met with us last
weekend, only these eight struck us as the sort of
people needed to take the ASSU through a time
of what should be radical change.
Why these eight? That question is answered
below on an individual basis. Why not the other
21? That answer is a little more complicated.
Virtually all the candidates said, to varying
degrees, that the current behavior of the ASSU
Senate falls short of what should be expected.
"The senate has a tremendously horrible image,"
said one. "The biggest problem with student gov
ernment here is that it's not representing the stu
dents," added another.
The responses to the senate's inefficiencies this
year varied. Some wanted to disband the senate.
Some wanted to "streamline" the senate. One
said, "Increase the number of senators to in
crease accountability." Another said, "Decrease
the number of senators to increase accoun
tability."
But of all these would-be reformers among the
23 first-time senate hopefuls, only nine had actu
ally gone to a senate meeting. So when one candi
date told us he could "work very well within the
system," we had to wonder. How could he know
if he had never seen the system work?
Another striking fact about this year's crop of
candidates was the shortage of ideas among
them. Last year, we heard over and over about a
shuttle bus to San Francisco, a deader Dead
Week, photo ID cards, better food service and
the like. Certainly, there were a few of the stan
dard pie-in-the-sky ideas this time, but most can
didates were interested only in getting elected
and working with the system. It's hard to decide
what to make out of that. Either the candidates
have simply given up after watching previous
senates fail to produce concrete results on these
standard campaign topics, or they realize that the
problems with the ASSU itself are so great that
they can't hope to actually accomplish anything.
So why not the 21? In most cases, they showed
either little knowledge of the ASSU or little ef
fort to learn, either no desire to change the sys
tem or a desire without a plan, or — worse yet —
a proven track record of working against the stu
dent interest within the ASSU. Only the follow
ing eight candidates truly impressed us.
Michael Tuchin
This sophomore psychology major knows just
how bad the ASSU Senate can be; he suffered
through the fee assessment process this year,
watching as his Axe Committee budget was
hacked illogically into two separate parts. Tuchin,
who says he has suffered "sheer frustration" with
this year's senate, wants to give students more
opportunities to vote on issues which affect them.
Jeff Soukup
ASSU incumbents had a hard time getting The
Daily's endorsement this year; they had to

defend the actions— or inaction, as the case may
be — of this year's senate and Council of Presi
dents. But this junior international relations
major has something to show for himself after a
year in the senate. He is one of only four under
graduate senators who actually attended all the
senate meetings, and he has the respect of many
of those who have worked with him.
Joel Bellenson
This junior in biology and international relations
has proven himself a go-getter in the world of
student activities. He has worked in political
campaigns, led the Hillel in social action and
coordinated a soon-to-happen benefit concert for
East Africa. His concern for social issues could
make him the conscience of the senate.
Kimberly Denend
Denend wonders why the thinking that has
brought about the "unprecedented innovations"
for which Stanford is famous can't prevail in the
ASSU Senate. We do too. She attributes the sen
ate's problems to a "unadventurous, close
minded, stifling atmosphere," and she is willing
to take some chances to change that.
Ed Renwick
This freshman sees the senate for what it has
been: "an attitude of indifference and individual
senators' involvement in petty power battles."
Renwick is ready to rise above the often-cited
bickering and bylaws to actualy accomplish
something in the senate. He says he will devote
himself to "fiscal accountability . . . student ser
vice needs, and the establishment of a creative,
responsive and dedicated student government."
