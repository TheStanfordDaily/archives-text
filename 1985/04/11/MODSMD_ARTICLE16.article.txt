# Fredism — A youth menace?
## 
### 
The lackeys arrived, each with a form laid gently upon a
silver salver. They laid the salvers atop the massive ebon
desk, carved, so it is said, from a single block of teak, a gift
from an Eastern potentate. Kow-towing once they fell
back on their knees, awaiting the decision with fatalistic
miens of their profession.
The light shining through the stained glass window
briefly haloed the massive brow of the ancient enthroned
in judgment behind the desk. It seemed as if each of his
past pronouncements had left its mark, a crease here, a
gray hair there. His acumen was the stuff of legends and it
was said that he had never erred. A troubled look crossed
his face, causing the hearts to rise in the throats of the sup
plicants. He eyed the forms, his gaze unwinking.
To the left, a valedictorian, captain of the volleyball
team, president of the junior class, 1380 SATs. To the
right, a salutatorian, captain of the field hockey team,
senior class president, 1400 SATs.
He cast his white silk robe aside and laid his hand heav
ily on the left salver. His right arm shot out to his side and,

after a brief pause, his hand
rotated clockwise, the thumb
pointing to the Oriental car
pet. A brief groan rose uncon
trollably from the first lackey's
throat. He bowed three times
and arose. Carefully grasping
the offending application be
tween thumb and forefinger,
he backed out of the room,
hurrying to prepare an artfully
smudged "Best wishes in your
future academic career" form
letter.

The second lackey kneeled, his eyes seemingly
transfixed by the heavy gold signet ring that now rested
atop the right salver. The dean's — surely by now you must
realize that it is none other than Dean Fred that sits be
hind the ebon expanse — hand rotated again, and did not
stop until the thumb pointed at the mysterious runes in
scribed in the ceiling.
"Geeeer-eight," he loaredV-not Unlike the cry of a fa
mous breakfast cereal mascot.
"Oh frabjous day,"the supplicant cried, "Calloah
Callay!" He rose from his knees, hurriedly kissed the
dean's ring, grabbed the salver and rushed from the
room. "The parchment," he shouted, "Where's the callig
rapher, call Federal Express."
Well all right, I'm told that's not how it's done. I under
stand that the actual admissions decisions are made by an
admissions committee using an Ouija board. In real tough
cases they slaughter a chicken and read the entrails. The
dean only supervises the process. You would never know
that based upon how the undergraduates feel about Dean
Fred, a cult figure invested with uncanny powers of per
ception and super-human wisdom. I mean really, how
many of you can name the dean of your school or the head
of the Financial Aids Office, to name just two bureaucrats
who should be much more important to the average stu
dent than the dean of admissions.
Fredism is the silliest of the elitist rituals that run ram
pant among the undergraduates at Stanford. The idea that
they are somehow better than the common clay because
they attend Stanford permeates the rural atmosphere of
the Farm. Since Dean Fred is the arbiter of good taste,
Überfuhrer fur den Meistervolk, a necessary part of the
elitist mythology is that Dean Fred can do no wrong. If
this were not true, some of the undergraduates might not
belong here, which is, of course, unthinkable.
I suppose it's natural, though. Being admitted to Stan
ford is extremely prestigious and a sure indication that
you're a hell of a human being. Unfortunately, at the time
you're admitted, you're a hell of a 17-year-old human
being. Don't get me wrong, being a successful 17-year
old, not unlike successfully completing toilet training, is
something of which you can be justifiably proud. It's just

that it's not the sort of thjng you want to have mentioned
in the first paragraph of your New York Times obituary.
Attending Stanford is not a golden ticket, good for a
free ride through life. Most people here profess to realize
this, and work very hard to succeed here. But every time I
see a "We got in" T-shirt, I have to wonder. I recently
overheard a Stanford senior explaining to a high school
freshman the secret to being admitted to Stanford. His ad
vice boiled down to brown nose your teachers and lie on
your essay. These are not the life skills that will win you
that five-bedroom house in Portola Valley.
He went on to explain that it wouldn't be the end of the
world if the young man wasn't accepted at Stanford.
"Why, most of the people I've interviewed with," he said,
"didn't go to nearly as good a school as Stanford." That
seemed to puzzle him. and I think I detected a tinge of
hurt feelings in his voice.
If you want, you can chalk this up as sour grapes on my
part. I was a miserable failure as a teenager (actually, I'm
not doing so hot in mv 20s, either, but that's harrllv

germane) and couldn't have
gotten into Stanford in a mil
lion years. However, if you
won't hold that against me, I'll
try not to look on it as a total
breakdown in the Stanford ad
missions process.
Consider the following: Do
you know anyone at Stanford
who has bad handwriting and
is not a National Merit Scholar
or star on the tennis team? Do
you know anyone at Stanford
who professes any interest at

all in teaching high school? Finally, take a little poll and
find out how many of your friends' parents had something
to do with high school teaching.
I'm not saying that all it takes to get into Stanford is
neat handwriting and a mom in the high school English
department, although that probably helps. Nor am I
112 achers jfchottghlnany
df"them' 1 are.'nrclfaT rrn trying to point out is that the
people most responsible for undergraduates- getting into
Stanford could never have gotten in themselves, even on
Dean Fred's worst day. I doubt that my high school teach
ers would have recognized intelligence if it walked up to
them and bit them on the knee.
In all fairness, I should add that high grades at Stanford
are a pretty sure sign that you're elite. They'll impress the
dickens out of interviewers and graduate schools. They
will not, however, make you God. And also, please don't
tell someone who went to Tuscaloosa A & M that a 2.2 at
Stanford is the equivalent of a 4.0 at A & M. It's not true,
no matter who told you, and it's not likely to win you any
friends.
Dean Fred's gone now. I personally think he was crazy
to quit a job where he was universally loved by 6,000
young people. Maybe he thought it was his personality, in
which case I'm sure he's been rudely awakened by now —
luckily Fredism isn't the state religion or I'd probably go
to the stake for that remark. I occasionally wonder what
happens when he meets someone with whom he had a less
than great correspondence in years past. I would bet the
conversation is also considerably less than great.
There's a new dean now. Dean Jean. She's already the
best known, and most loved, dean on campus. (Would
new carpeting in anyone else's office make The Daily?)
She's inherited the right stuff, the uncanny ability to
shuffle through 17,000 applications and pick the best
1,500. Well, at least that's what next year's freshmen will
think. In four years, she'll be responsible for almost all of
the undergraduates on campus, and Dean Fred will only
be a fading memory. That's really something that she
should think about — while she's posing for her T-shirt.
