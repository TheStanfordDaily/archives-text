Daily's standards
On the one hand, The Daily asks
Stanford to make the University's
moral attitudes part of its investment
policy and, therefore, to divest itself
of stock in firms that do business
with the government of South
Africa. On the other hand. The
Daily insists that in doing its own
business it has the right to keep
advertisement policy and editorial
policy separate and, therefore, will
accept advertisements from Playboy
magazine.
If The Daily expects Stanford to
combine moral principles and eco
nomic policies, then perhaps it
should hold itself to this same stan
dard.
