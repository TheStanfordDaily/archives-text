VACAVILLE (AP) — Theodore Streleski, the former
Stanford doctoral student convicted of killing Mathema
tics Prof. Karel deLeeuw, intends to return to San Fran
cisco and work in mathematics when he is released from
Vacaville State Medical Facility in September, Streleski's
attorney said yesterday.
Streleski, who was formally ordered yesterday to
remain in state prison until his term is com
pleted Sept. 9, has rejected parole offers that bar him
from returning to the Bay Area.
At a one-and-one-half-hour hearing here yesterday,
three Department of Corrections officers testified that
Streleski refused to accept parole conditions, such as a
ban on travel to the Stanford area, and Streleski read a
20-minute prepared statement reviewing legal details of
his case.
Streleski's attorney, Michael McGowan, said the deci
sion by the Board of Prison Terms to revoke Streleski's
March 8 parole was a foregone conclusion and no surprise
to his client. Streleski said shortly before March 8 that he
would not accept the conditions of parole offered him.
He has denied any remorse for the killing deLeeuw in
1978 and has refused to promise he would not return to
Stanford and kill others after his release.
Streleski had been scheduled for release March 8. But
he refused to sign papers putting conditions on his parole,
and officers immediately returned him to prison pending
the hearing yesterday. It was the third time Streleski had
refused parole conditions and been returned to prison.
Streleski, 48, had spent 19 years as a graduate student
seeking a doctorate in mathematics and blamed deLeeuw
for preventing him from receiving the degree.
In an interview before his first scheduled parole last
/ear, Streleski told a reporter that he did not regret the
nurder, that it was "unlikely" that he would kill again
after his release from prison, but that he wouldn't make
any promises.
"I don't want to do anything that says I didn't mean it. I
meant it," Streleski said. "I am absolutely noncommittal
on whether I will go back to Stanford and kill again."
