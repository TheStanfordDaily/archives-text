# Chairman Lynch leads a profitable Saga
## 
### GREG CROSSFIELD 
During the last decade, droves of
students have gone through the rigors
of business school to get a coveted
master's in business administration.
The popularity of the degree has
made it seem as though getting an
MBA is a prerequisite to success.
But Charles Lynch, 56, the chair
man and chief executive officer of
Saga Corp. since 1982, has achieved
success without the aid of an MBA.
Rather than academic background,
he says the experience he gained by
working at different companies was the
background he needed to help attain
record-setting earnings figures for his
billion-dollar corporation.
"A lot of MB As start a lot higher
than they should and in one sense get
hurt," Lynch said. "They don't have a
chance to reflect on what they really
don't know about business. They
have been trained intellectually and
in a lot of techniques, but you don't
really learn until you get in there and
roll your sleeves up."
Lynch had rolled up his sleeves at
places like Dupont, SCOA Industries
and W.R. Grace prior to becoming
president of Saga in 1978.
After getting his bachelor's degree
from Yale in 1950, Lynch went to the
marketing department at Dupont,

where he learned a great deal about
the managment of human resources.
"I was very fortunate at Dupont. It
set the foundation of basic principles
that evolved in my career. Most
notable was their method of handling
people, which was very positive.
"I left the company satisfied with
what I had learned. I was at that time
the youngest director of marketing. I
looked above me to asstistant general
manager and general manager, and
there wasn't one person above me
who didn't have a technical degree. I
had a burning desire to prove that I
could run something and I reflected
on where I was. I thought I should get
into an enviornment where I had a
chance at upward movement," Lynch
said.
Lynch's next move was to SCOA
Industries.
"I went to SCOA as president of
five manufacturing companies in a
larger enviornment," Lynch said.
"SCOA was the first time I had full
responsibility from a profit-and-loss
perspective. I had come up on the
marketing route, and I was now act
ing very much like a general manager.
"It allowed me to then get a better
understanding of what was really
needed in the fundamentals of run
ning a business: the controls, the stra

tegic planning of a business and the
kind of personel practices that were
going to be effective," he said.
Lynch then moved to W.R. Grace,
where he was given an opportunity to

learn about finance. His responsibili
ties at one point included 26 compan
ies in a variety of industries. It proved
to be invaluable to his experience at
Saga.

"At W.R. Grace, the orchestration
was a real test because you were
trying to administer a massive group
of people in a massive group of busi
nesses and put some semblence of un
derstanding and ideas in and at the
same time run them profitably. I also
gained more knowledge on how to
run a business, and a better under
standing of the finance of a business
than any other time in my career,"
Lynch said.
"In each case, whether at Dupont,
SCOA or Grace, I worked for people
that I thought were really going to
teach me something. Certainly money
does have an impact. I would not take
the job if I did not respect the person
I was going to work for.
"The learning curve is never end
ing. Even coming out here as chief
executive officer, one of the chief
considerations was coming out here
to work with Ernie Arbuckle, the
former dean of Stanford business
school. The idea of working with
Ernie and learning while at the same
time running a business was ex
tremely important," he said.
Lynch's arrival was the result of a
study commissioned by Saga's
founders, which concluded that
outside managers should be brought

in to run the company. The job*
moved his wife,. Linda, and three
children from their home in Prince
ton, N.J., to Atherton.
Saga operates five restaurant
chains, including Mac Arthur Park
and the Velvet Turtle, and provides
contract food service to hospitals,
hotels, businesses and colleges. Un
der Lynch's command, the company's
revenues have grown from $656 mil
lion to $1.13 billion, while earnings
have rocketed from $1.5 million to
$31 million.
When corporations try to increase
earnings, they often concentrate on
cutting the costs in areas without con
sidering the negative impact on the
morale of employees. This was not the
case with Saga.
"What we did here is say, 'Let's
look at our revenue base, but let's
work on our cost side,' " Lynch said.
"Given that we have a low (profit)
margin, as is the case in most of the
restaurant business, that is where we
are going to have the toughest time
competing. This is the kind of busi
ness where every local person is a
competitor. We elected to take every
line item in our profit-and-loss state
ment and challenge it as to what we
thought we could do effectively and
still maintain a highly viable business."

margin, as is the case in most of the
restaurant business, that is where we
are going to have the toughest time
competing. This is the kind of busi
ness where every local person is a
competitor. We elected to take every
line item in our profit-and-loss state
ment and challenge it as to what we
thought we could do effectively and
still maintain a highly viable business."


Stanford alumnus Charles Lynch is the chief executive officer of Saga
Corp.
During the last decade, droves of
students have gone through the rigors
of business school to get a coveted
master's in business administration.
The popularity of the degree has
made it seem as though getting an
MBA is a prerequisite to success.
But Charles Lynch, 56, the chair
man and chief executive officer of
Saga Corp. since 1982, has achieved
success without the aid of an MBA.
Rather than academic background,
he says the experience he gained by
working at different companies was the
background he needed to help attain
record-setting earnings figures for his
billion-dollar corporation.
"A lot of MB As start a lot higher
than they should and in one sense get
hurt," Lynch said. "They don't have a
chance to reflect on what they really
don't know about business. They
have been trained intellectually and
in a lot of techniques, but you don't
really learn until you get in there and
roll your sleeves up."
Lynch had rolled up his sleeves at
places like Dupont, SCOA Industries
and W.R. Grace prior to becoming
president of Saga in 1978.
After getting his bachelor's degree
from Yale in 1950, Lynch went to the
marketing department at Dupont,

where he learned a great deal about
the managment of human resources.
"I was very fortunate at Dupont. It
set the foundation of basic principles
that evolved in my career. Most
notable was their method of handling
people, which was very positive.
"I left the company satisfied with
what I had learned. I was at that time
the youngest director of marketing. I
looked above me to asstistant general
manager and general manager, and
there wasn't one person above me
who didn't have a technical degree. I
had a burning desire to prove that I
could run something and I reflected
on where I was. I thought I should get
into an enviornment where I had a
chance at upward movement," Lynch
said.
Lynch's next move was to SCOA
Industries.
"I went to SCOA as president of
five manufacturing companies in a
larger enviornment," Lynch said.
"SCOA was the first time I had full
responsibility from a profit-and-loss
perspective. I had come up on the
marketing route, and I was now act
ing very much like a general manager.
"It allowed me to then get a better
understanding of what was really
needed in the fundamentals of run
ning a business: the controls, the stra

tegic planning of a business and the
kind of personel practices that were
going to be effective," he said.
Lynch then moved to W.R. Grace,
where he was given an opportunity to

learn about finance. His responsibili
ties at one point included 26 compan
ies in a variety of industries. It proved
to be invaluable to his experience at
Saga.

"At W.R. Grace, the orchestration
was a real test because you were
trying to administer a massive group
of people in a massive group of busi
nesses and put some semblence of un
derstanding and ideas in and at the
same time run them profitably. I also
gained more knowledge on how to
run a business, and a better under
standing of the finance of a business
than any other time in my career,"
Lynch said.
"In each case, whether at Dupont,
SCOA or Grace, I worked for people
that I thought were really going to
teach me something. Certainly money
does have an impact. I would not take
the job if I did not respect the person
I was going to work for.
"The learning curve is never end
ing. Even coming out here as chief
executive officer, one of the chief
considerations was coming out here
to work with Ernie Arbuckle, the
former dean of Stanford business
school. The idea of working with
Ernie and learning while at the same
time running a business was ex
tremely important," he said.
Lynch's arrival was the result of a
study commissioned by Saga's
founders, which concluded that
outside managers should be brought

in to run the company. The job*
moved his wife,. Linda, and three
children from their home in Prince
ton, N.J., to Atherton.
Saga operates five restaurant
chains, including Mac Arthur Park
and the Velvet Turtle, and provides
contract food service to hospitals,
hotels, businesses and colleges. Un
der Lynch's command, the company's
revenues have grown from $656 mil
lion to $1.13 billion, while earnings
have rocketed from $1.5 million to
$31 million.
When corporations try to increase
earnings, they often concentrate on
cutting the costs in areas without con
sidering the negative impact on the
morale of employees. This was not the
case with Saga.
"What we did here is say, 'Let's
look at our revenue base, but let's
work on our cost side,' " Lynch said.
"Given that we have a low (profit)
margin, as is the case in most of the
restaurant business, that is where we
are going to have the toughest time
competing. This is the kind of busi
ness where every local person is a
competitor. We elected to take every
line item in our profit-and-loss state
ment and challenge it as to what we
thought we could do effectively and
still maintain a highly viable business."
