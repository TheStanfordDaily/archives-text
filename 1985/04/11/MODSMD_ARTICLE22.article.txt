## Loss leaves Card volleyball still looking UCLA spikes playoff bid 
### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
The UCLA Bruins stalked, ran down and then
bear-hugged the Cardinal men's volleyball team
into submission here last night. In the end, Stanford
was mauled, 10-15, 15-10, 15-9, 15-13, in the
league match.
The loss dropped Stanford, fifth in the California
Intercollegiate Volleyball Association, to 9-8 in
league and 22-9 overall. More important, it
narrowed Stanford's slim lead over sixth-place
Hawaii, 8-8, to half a game.
The Cardinal lost an opportunity to clinch its
first-ever postseason playoff bid. "It was a big
game in that it would definitely have put us in
there (the NCAAs)," Co-coach Don Shaw said. "It
would also have been great to get a win against
UCLA with all their tradition."
Traditionally, the top five teams in the CIVA ad
vance to the NCAA tournament.
Only next Wednesday's home match with
Long Beach State remains on the Cardinal's league
slate — and that match is shaping up as a must-win
proposition. With a victory, Stanford will finish 10-
8 and in good shape — sort of.
The problem is that UC-Santa Barbara, 9-5 and
currently in third, plays two matches in Hawaii over
the weekend. If the Gauchos capture either con
test, Stanford will go to Los Angeles later this

month. But if the Rainbows pull off a sweep and
end up 10-8, they finish tied with Stanford, and
if Santa Barbara also finishes 10-8, the fun begins.
The Cardinal coaching staff, with years of com
petitive volleyball under its belt, isn't really sure
how three 10-8 teams would be pared to two. An
arm-wrestling battle, if not the best, would be the
least confusing method.
All this confusion would have been avoided if
Stanford could have won last night. That makes the
team's sometimes lackadaisical performance all the
more bewildering.
"We just didn't seem to have it going," Shaw
said. "We had spells, mostly in the passing. This
was one of those games that came down to the ser
vice and the serve return. The Bruins were able to
do those things better than we were."
In game one, the Cardinal jumped to an 8-1
lead, staggered and let UCLA back in at 11-10, but
regrouped to take the final four points and, with
them, the game. Junior Chris Braun's and freshman
Scott Fortune's block of a would-be Bruin kill put
the set in the books.
Thereafter, things were different. Stanford fell
behind 6-0 in the second game and, although the
Cardinal rallied to knot it up at 8-8, the Bruins
eventually triumphed, 15-10. Gangly sophomore
Arne Lamberg's kill, one of his 16 on the night,
tied the match at a set apiece.

The third set was pretty much decided by
UCLA's run of 10 unanswered points that turned a
3-0 Cardinal lead into a 10-3 Bruin advantage.
Just as in the second set, an inspired comeback
sputtered after Stanford got back into things. After
pulling to within one at 10-9, the Cardinal was
done in by another extended Bruin run, this time of
five points.
Explaining the repeated failures to sustain mo
mentum after fighting back, Shaw said, "You use a
lot of energy getting back into the game. There are
a lot of phases in each game. There's a beginning, a
middle and an end. When you don't combine good
efforts in each phase, then you're in trouble."
For a while, game four looked like it would go
Stanford's way. But the Cardinal, ahead from the
outset until UCLA pulled even at 13-13, just
couldn't chase the Bruins up a tree. UCLA staged
its last run of the night from a 13-11 deficit, taking
the last four points. Norwegian Asborn Volstad's
powerful kill finished off the Bruins' prey.
With the victory, UCLA came out of a three
game hibernation of sorts. "It was a good win for
us," Bruin Coach A 1 Scates said. "I don't think
we've ever lost more than three games in a row
since I've been here. If nothing else, it was big for
me."
