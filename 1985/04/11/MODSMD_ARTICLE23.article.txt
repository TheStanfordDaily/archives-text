When Terry Taylor and Howard Wright put
their signatures on the dotted lines yesterday,
the cast of the 1985-86 Stanford men's basket
ball team was — at last— officially completed.
Taylor and Wright round out a five-man
recruiting class which, from all indications,
should be one of the finest in Cardinal basket
ball history. The other three players — 6-10
center Derek Bruton of Gilroy, 6-4 guard Todd
Lichti of Concord and 6-7 forward Bryan
McSweeney of Dana Point — committed to
Stanford in November.
Yesterday was also letter-of-intent day for
swimming, and George Haines, coach of the
Stanford women swimmers, landed Jenna
Johnson, the nation's top high school swimmer,
and four others who finished in the top five at
last weekend's national meet.

Johnson was a member of the gold medal
winning American 400-meter freestyle relay
team at the Olympic Games last summer, and
she won a silver in the 100 butterfly.
Basketball Coach Tom Davis didn't land any
Olympians, but he was happy with his newest
class.
"We couldn't be more pleased," Davis said.
"All five of these students were very highly
recruited — all had offers from several other
major institutions. This class has a chance to be
nationally rated as a group."
Indeed it does. All five recruits boast high
school credentials that would make most college
coaches open their eyes.
Taylor, a 6-1 point guard from the Denver
suburb of Aurora, was named Colorado Player
of the Year after leading the state in scoring last
