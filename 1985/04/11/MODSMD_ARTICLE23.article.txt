# Hoopsters, swimmers sign to play on Farm

When Terry Taylor and Howard Wright put
their signatures on the dotted lines yesterday,
the cast of the 1985-86 Stanford men's basket
ball team was — at last— officially completed.
Taylor and Wright round out a five-man
recruiting class which, from all indications,
should be one of the finest in Cardinal basket
ball history. The other three players — 6-10
center Derek Bruton of Gilroy, 6-4 guard Todd
Lichti of Concord and 6-7 forward Bryan
McSweeney of Dana Point — committed to
Stanford in November.
Yesterday was also letter-of-intent day for
swimming, and George Haines, coach of the
Stanford women swimmers, landed Jenna
Johnson, the nation's top high school swimmer,
and four others who finished in the top five at
last weekend's national meet.

Johnson was a member of the gold medal
winning American 400-meter freestyle relay
team at the Olympic Games last summer, and
she won a silver in the 100 butterfly.
Basketball Coach Tom Davis didn't land any
Olympians, but he was happy with his newest
class.
"We couldn't be more pleased," Davis said.
"All five of these students were very highly
recruited — all had offers from several other
major institutions. This class has a chance to be
nationally rated as a group."
Indeed it does. All five recruits boast high
school credentials that would make most college
coaches open their eyes.
Taylor, a 6-1 point guard from the Denver
suburb of Aurora, was named Colorado Player
of the Year after leading the state in scoring last
season with a 26.1 point-per-game
average.

Wright, a 6-8 power forward from
San Diego who turned down Wash
ington, Texas and Wichita State to
sign with Stanford, was named to the
1985 McDonald's honorable
mention All-America team.
It doesn't stop there. Lichti was
named East Bay Player of the Year
and was ranked in the top 75 by The
Sporting News. Bruton made the
First Team All-California squad and
McSweeney was named First Team
All-Orange County by the Los An
geles Times and the Orange County
Register.
Added together, this team — two
guards, two forwards and a center —
averaged 113 points and 55 rebounds
per game during the 1984-85 season.
Despite their resumes, Davis does
not expect his recruits to step in and
contribute immediately. "With all
freshmen, we realize it will take some
time to adjust to Pac-10 play," he
said. "Next year, we're only going to
be as good as our seniors are."
If he's still saying that four years
from now, watch out.
For the Stanford women's basket

ball team, it's all over but the signing.
The Cardinal has received verbal
commitments from three highly re
garded recruits, and expects to have
the letters of intent in hand soon.
The recruits are 6-2 forward Evon
Asforis of Queens Village, N.Y., 5-9
guard Emily Wagner from the
Detroit suburb of Pleasant Ridge,
Mich., and 6-5 center Jill Yanke of
Boise, Idaho. All remained firm on
their commitments after Coach Dotty
McCrea resigned under pressure last
month.
"I always knew I was going to Stan
ford," said Yanke, who will become
the tallest women's basketball player
in Stanford's history. "When I visited
there, I felt very comfortable and just
loved the campus. It would have been
hard to turn all that down."
Yanke brings some impressive
credentials with her — she was selec
ted to the preseason USA Today Top
25 team and recently named Idaho
Player of the Year — but she is
matched by her fellow recruits.
Wagner and Asforis are both
Parade Magazine Fourth Team Ail-
Americans. In addition, Wagner was
recently honored as Michigan's Miss
Basketball, and Asforis captained
August Martin High School to the
New York state title and the nation's
No. 2 ranking this year.
