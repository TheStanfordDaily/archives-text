### GEOFF SANBORN Editorial staff 
Everything pointed to a Stanford upsei of 15th-ranked
California in a Softball double-header played on Roble
Field yesterday afternoon.
Stanford was coming off a 5-0 victory over San Fran
cisco State during which the Cardinal had apparently
emerged from its prolonged hitting slump, and Cal, ac
cording to Stanford Coach Kathy Lincoln, had been strug
gling of late.
But when the players walked off the field, Cal had a
pair of shutout victories — 6-0 and 2-0 — and Stanford
had disappointing losses No. 35 and 36.
"I don't know what the deal is about us and scoring
runs," senior outfielder Cathy Taft said. "We played well,
and got a lot more hits than usual... .We should have

Terri Silliman and the Cardinal took a mighty swipe at knocking off
15th-ranked California, but failed to score a run in 14 innings and
dropped a pair to the Bears 6-0 and 2-0.
There was no shortage of reasons
for the loss as far as Lincoln was con
cerned. Reason No. 1: "We couldn't
get the key hits." Stanford had run
ners in scoring position five times in
the first game and twice in the second
game.
Reason No. 2: "We weren't
playing heads-up on the bases," Lin
coln said. Cardinal rallies were killed
when Taft was thrown out at the plate
in the second game and when K.K.
Bush was nailed in the opener. Lin
coln's reasons No. 3, 4 and 5: Too

many errors — five on the day — a
slow start and some questionable um
piring.
Lisa Buchanan, 4-17, took the loss
in the opener. After Cal, 19-13,
jumped on her for four runs in the
first inning, she settled down to throw
a five-hitter the rest of the way.
In the second game, Betsy Watson
was stuck with her 18th loss against
four wins, once again a victim of
Stanford's inability to score. "Betsy
was effective today," Lincoln said.
"Her drop was working well, and she
was getting a lot of ground balls."
Asked if she was disappointed with
her team's hitting, Lincoln said: "The
way we've been hitting is much better
than last year."
