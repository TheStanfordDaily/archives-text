# Senior to caddy at Masters
## 
### JENNIFER KOCH Staff sportswriter 
When golfs Masters Tournament
begins today in Augusta, Ga., the
field of 125 professionals will be
mostly predictable — the top 120 gol
fers on the money list as well as past
winners automatically qualify for the
tournament.
The real surprise in this tourna
ment will be the sex of George Ar
cher's caddy.
This will be the second time Stan
ford senior Elizabeth "Leo" Archer
has caddied the Masters for her
father. The first was in 1983 when she
earned the distinction of becoming
the first woman to caddy the tourna
ment.
Caddied exclusively in the past by
black, male caddies employed by the
club, this prestigious tournament was
opened to outside caddies for the first
time in the spring of 1983. Tom Wat
son, as well as several other players
who travel with personal caddies,
protested the club's policy. Once Ar
cher learned that the tournament had
been opened, she wrote a letter to the
club and was granted permission to
caddy for her father.
George Archer joined the profes
sional golf tour in his early 20s after
winning several Bay Area amateur
tournaments. He has competed in 13
professional tournaments, including
the U.S. Open, the PGA and the
British Open. Previous wins include
the Bing Crosby Pro-Am and the
Masters in 1969. A first-place finish
in the Bank of Boston Classic last
September was his most recent win.
Saying she "needed a summer
job," Archer went on tour with her
father in 1980, caddying for tourna
ments like the Memphis Open and
the Crosby. Then came her appear
ance at the Masters, which generated
interviews by ESPN and Sports Il
lustrated.
A few women have begun caddying

since Archer's trendsetting appear
ances in professional tournaments.
The wives of some of the younger
players now travel with and caddy for
their husbands. Often economic
reasons are involved, as a caddy is
usually paid a salary of $200 as well
as 3 to 5 percent of the golfer's win
nings.

Archer said the most difficult
aspect of caddying is carrying 60
pounds of equipment. This often in
cludes rain gear, essential in humid
areas. The heat is intensified by the
heavy uniforms that the caddies are
required to wear. Caddies for the
Masters Tournament must wear uni
form shoes, socks and hats, as well as
a white jumpsuit.
Although Archer is not responsible
for her father's club selection, she
said it is important for a caddy to
know yardage on the holes in order to
know what club the golfer will need.
Also essential is "an understanding of
golf etiquette, the courtesy not to step
in people's way, and the ability to
remain quiet."
Archer said that one of the advan
tages of caddying a professional
tournament is the opportunity to
meet celebrities like former President
Ford. Other aspects are "the excite
ment when Dad is playing well or

about to break a course record. I'm
full of pride that he's my dad and still
a competitive athlete at age 45."
Archer has also had her share of
frustrating and embarrassing experi
ences as a caddy. In the Quad City
Open in Davenport, lowa, she agreed
to meet her father halfway down the
next fairway. She arrived in time to
learn that she had missed his hole-in
one on the previous hole.
As for her most embarrassing, Ar
cher said that moment occurred when
"I had a coughing spasm at the 16th
hole of the Crosby on national TV,
and Dad screamed at me to get off
the green."
Archer, who thought "the game
was so boring until I was 16 and
began to appreciate the difficulty of
the sport," has recently began to take
up golf herself.
Her main sport, however is track
and field. She has competed in Stan
ford's program for the past four
years. Although she was a hurdler in
high school and participated in discus
and shot events her first year at Stan
ford, Archer is now primarily in
volved in javelin competition.

Feeling that this will be her most
successful year so far in track, Archer
"sees room for improvement. I'd like
to see what kind of potential I have."
She has made her name known on
the Stanford campus as well as on the
professional golf circuit. In addition
to her involvement in track, she is
currently an RA in Schiff House. She
was awarded a University public ser
vice award last year for her efforts in
starting a school in her hometown of
Gilroy to teach handicapped children
to swim.
An American Studies major, Ar
cher's future plans include graduate
school, where she hopes to study psy
chology and theology.
In the more immediate future,
however, Archer's goal is to caddy
the British Open this summer. Archer
worked in Parliament for six months
last year and says that "I would like
to go back to what I consider to be
the home of golf."
She also hopes to continue caddy
ing for her father in years to come. As
she says, "When Dad turns 50 and
plays the senior tour, caddies get to
ride in golf carts,"

ment will be the sex of George Ar
cher's caddy.
This will be the second time Stan
ford senior Elizabeth "Leo" Archer
has caddied the Masters for her
father. The first was in 1983 when she
earned the distinction of becoming
the first woman to caddy the tourna
ment.
Caddied exclusively in the past by
black, male caddies employed by the
club, this prestigious tournament was
opened to outside caddies for the first
time in the spring of 1983. Tom Wat
son, as well as several other players
who travel with personal caddies,
protested the club's policy. Once Ar
cher learned that the tournament had
been opened, she wrote a letter to the
club and was granted permission to
caddy for her father.
George Archer joined the profes
sional golf tour in his early 20s after
winning several Bay Area amateur
tournaments. He has competed in 13
professional tournaments, including
the U.S. Open, the PGA and the
British Open. Previous wins include
the Bing Crosby Pro-Am and the
Masters in 1969. A first-place finish
in the Bank of Boston Classic last
September was his most recent win.
Saying she "needed a summer
job," Archer went on tour with her
father in 1980, caddying for tourna
ments like the Memphis Open and
the Crosby. Then came her appear
ance at the Masters, which generated
interviews by ESPN and Sports Il
lustrated.
A few women have begun caddying

since Archer's trendsetting appear
ances in professional tournaments.
The wives of some of the younger
players now travel with and caddy for
their husbands. Often economic
reasons are involved, as a caddy is
usually paid a salary of $200 as well
as 3 to 5 percent of the golfer's win
nings.

Archer said the most difficult
aspect of caddying is carrying 60
pounds of equipment. This often in
cludes rain gear, essential in humid
areas. The heat is intensified by the
heavy uniforms that the caddies are
required to wear. Caddies for the
Masters Tournament must wear uni
form shoes, socks and hats, as well as
a white jumpsuit.
Although Archer is not responsible
for her father's club selection, she
said it is important for a caddy to
know yardage on the holes in order to
know what club the golfer will need.
Also essential is "an understanding of
golf etiquette, the courtesy not to step
in people's way, and the ability to
remain quiet."
Archer said that one of the advan
tages of caddying a professional
tournament is the opportunity to
meet celebrities like former President
Ford. Other aspects are "the excite
ment when Dad is playing well or

about to break a course record. I'm
full of pride that he's my dad and still
a competitive athlete at age 45."
Archer has also had her share of
frustrating and embarrassing experi
ences as a caddy. In the Quad City
Open in Davenport, lowa, she agreed
to meet her father halfway down the
next fairway. She arrived in time to
learn that she had missed his hole-in
one on the previous hole.
As for her most embarrassing, Ar
cher said that moment occurred when
"I had a coughing spasm at the 16th
hole of the Crosby on national TV,
and Dad screamed at me to get off
the green."
Archer, who thought "the game
was so boring until I was 16 and
began to appreciate the difficulty of
the sport," has recently began to take
up golf herself.
Her main sport, however is track
and field. She has competed in Stan
ford's program for the past four
years. Although she was a hurdler in
high school and participated in discus
and shot events her first year at Stan
ford, Archer is now primarily in
volved in javelin competition.

Feeling that this will be her most
successful year so far in track, Archer
"sees room for improvement. I'd like
to see what kind of potential I have."
She has made her name known on
the Stanford campus as well as on the
professional golf circuit. In addition
to her involvement in track, she is
currently an RA in Schiff House. She
was awarded a University public ser
vice award last year for her efforts in
starting a school in her hometown of
Gilroy to teach handicapped children
to swim.
An American Studies major, Ar
cher's future plans include graduate
school, where she hopes to study psy
chology and theology.
In the more immediate future,
however, Archer's goal is to caddy
the British Open this summer. Archer
worked in Parliament for six months
last year and says that "I would like
to go back to what I consider to be
the home of golf."
She also hopes to continue caddy
ing for her father in years to come. As
she says, "When Dad turns 50 and
plays the senior tour, caddies get to
ride in golf carts,"
