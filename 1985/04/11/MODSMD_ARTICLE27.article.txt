## 'Desperately Seeking Susan' well-acted farce 
### GREGORY WEINGARTEN Editorial staff 
Funny, engaging, witty, fast-paced, young, high-energy
— in short, "Desperately Seeking Susan" is everything
the recent Academy Awards was not. Director Susan
Seidelman, who displayed an offbeat mentality in her in
dependently produced new wave "Smithereens," brings
another gem to the screen. Although "Desperately
Seeking Susan" is a bit more of a mainstream, mass ap
peal comedy, the Seidelman touch — a combination of
wit, humor and insight — makes her current film an ir
resistable charmer.

"Desperately Seeking Susan" is a punk/new wave ver
sion of the screwball comedies of the 50s. Seidelman
manages to infuse this genre with enough energy and can
dor to compensate for the wacky, unbelievable plot.
"Desperately Seeking Susan" is an entertaining farce, not
the type of film one examines for Freudian imagery. One
of the film's strenths is the fact that it never loses its satiri
cal edge. This is accomplished to a great extent through
the film's brilliant characterizations, which are achieved
thorugh the talented cast under Seidelman's dirction.
The storyline of "Desperately Seeking Susan" concerns
a bored New Jersey housewife, Roberta (Rosanna Ar
quette), from upper-middle class suburbia who is married
to an egocentric hot tub salesman (Mark Blum) who stars
in his own television commercials. Roberta's only solace
from her dreary existence is an item in the personal ads
that she has been following religiously that reads
"Desperately Seeking Susan" and is signed "Jim," fol
lowed by a place and time. Susan, a street-wise, free spirit
played by rock video star Madonna, is the object of Jim's
affection, and his attempts to arrange rendezvous with this
new wave femme fatale captivate Roberta. She decides to
investigate one of the pair's upcoming get-togethers in
nearby New York City.
Roberta becomes fascinated by Susan, whose I'll-do
what-I-want, when-I-want and with-whom-I-want atti
tude represents the antithesis of her dull, married life. She
ends up pursuing her idol, hoping to emulate her to the
point where the yuppie housewife from Fort Lee, N.J.,
follows Susan to the lower depths of Manhattan's East
Village buying second-hand clothing on the side in an at
tempt to imitate the foreign life form she represents.
Following a run-in with a lamppost that results in a
nasty blow to her head, Roberta, knocked unconscious,
wakes up to find she has no recollection of who she is.
Through a cast of mistaken identity, she is taken for
Susan. It is here that the real farce begins. Suddenly,
Roberta, who now thinks she's Susan, finds herself lost in
the totally unfamiliar digs of New York's Lower East

Side. Enter into her life a handsome projectionist who
runs B-movies (Aidan Quinn), the hot pursuit of a mafia
hitman and a million other delightfully mad quirks too
numerous to list and you have a madcap adventure,
romantic comedy, social satire, cultural expose and screw
ball story all wrapped up into one crazy picture.
It takes a talented cast to pull off a farce like this one,
and that is precisely what Seidelman's entourage of won
derfully wacky players does with flying colors. Rosanna
Arquette is excellent as the bored housewife and as her
alter-ego, Susan. Arquette, who was marvelous in her last
role as the protagonist in John Sayles's "Baby, It's You"
(she also starred in the television adaptation of Norman
Mailer's "The Executioner's Song"), has a unique qualtiy
and appeal — a freshness and honesty that leaps across
the screen in one of the most endearing personalities to
emerge from the 1980s crop of gifted young performers.
There is something so inextricably cute about her that its
hard not to fall head over heels for this illuminating screen
presence at first glance. This quality, however, is not with
out its dangers. Cuteness, while refreshing at first, can go
grow tiring (take Dudley Moore for example), and Ar
quette could be quickly typecast into playing young,
lovable, ingenues — a mold which can become hard to
break out of. Nevertheless, Arquette breathes freshness,
depth and sensitivity into her screen persona.
Madonna, who appears to make the transition from
video to film with effortless ease, is perfect as the uni
nhibited and Bohemian Susan. Madonna has a genuine
knack for comedy that steals the show at many points.
One of the most hilarious moments in "Desperately
Seeking Susan" is seeing Madonna, who has had a run-in
of sorts with Roberta's husband, Gary, in his suburban
home. Susan finds the trappings of suburban yuppiedom
just as bizarre and strangely appealing as Roberta finds
her own new Lower East Side surroundings. Laurie Met
calf, who plays Gary's sister, is also a delight as the rum
and-Tab drinking bachelorette whose effort to be a
"modern woman" parodies brilliantly females who con

sider "Cosmopolitan" a modern bible and Phil Donahue
the new-age messiah.
"Desperately Seeking Susan" never ceases to charm
and delight its audience in a tale that is something like an
'80s-version "Madame Bovary" with a happy ending. If
her latest vehicle proves succesful, and it has all the right
ingredients, Susan Seidelman could easily emerge into the
forefront of new directors, a presence that would be
refreshing in Hollywood's male-dominated industry (the
film is also produced by two women, Sara Pillsbury and
Midge Sanford).

"Desperately Seeking Susan" never ceases to charm

refreshing in Hollywood's male-dominated industry (the
film is also produced by two women, Sara Pillsbury and
Midge Sanford).

Funny, engaging, witty, fast-paced, young, high-energy
— in short, "Desperately Seeking Susan" is everything
the recent Academy Awards was not. Director Susan
Seidelman, who displayed an offbeat mentality in her in
dependently produced new wave "Smithereens," brings
another gem to the screen. Although "Desperately
Seeking Susan" is a bit more of a mainstream, mass ap
peal comedy, the Seidelman touch — a combination of
wit, humor and insight — makes her current film an ir
resistable charmer.

"Desperately Seeking Susan" is a punk/new wave ver
sion of the screwball comedies of the 50s. Seidelman
manages to infuse this genre with enough energy and can
dor to compensate for the wacky, unbelievable plot.
"Desperately Seeking Susan" is an entertaining farce, not
the type of film one examines for Freudian imagery. One
of the film's strenths is the fact that it never loses its satiri
cal edge. This is accomplished to a great extent through
the film's brilliant characterizations, which are achieved
thorugh the talented cast under Seidelman's dirction.
The storyline of "Desperately Seeking Susan" concerns
a bored New Jersey housewife, Roberta (Rosanna Ar
quette), from upper-middle class suburbia who is married
to an egocentric hot tub salesman (Mark Blum) who stars
in his own television commercials. Roberta's only solace
from her dreary existence is an item in the personal ads
that she has been following religiously that reads
"Desperately Seeking Susan" and is signed "Jim," fol
lowed by a place and time. Susan, a street-wise, free spirit
played by rock video star Madonna, is the object of Jim's
affection, and his attempts to arrange rendezvous with this
new wave femme fatale captivate Roberta. She decides to
investigate one of the pair's upcoming get-togethers in
nearby New York City.
Roberta becomes fascinated by Susan, whose I'll-do
what-I-want, when-I-want and with-whom-I-want atti
tude represents the antithesis of her dull, married life. She
ends up pursuing her idol, hoping to emulate her to the
point where the yuppie housewife from Fort Lee, N.J.,
follows Susan to the lower depths of Manhattan's East
Village buying second-hand clothing on the side in an at
tempt to imitate the foreign life form she represents.
Following a run-in with a lamppost that results in a
nasty blow to her head, Roberta, knocked unconscious,
wakes up to find she has no recollection of who she is.
Through a cast of mistaken identity, she is taken for
Susan. It is here that the real farce begins. Suddenly,
Roberta, who now thinks she's Susan, finds herself lost in
the totally unfamiliar digs of New York's Lower East

Side. Enter into her life a handsome projectionist who
runs B-movies (Aidan Quinn), the hot pursuit of a mafia
hitman and a million other delightfully mad quirks too
numerous to list and you have a madcap adventure,
romantic comedy, social satire, cultural expose and screw
ball story all wrapped up into one crazy picture.
It takes a talented cast to pull off a farce like this one,
and that is precisely what Seidelman's entourage of won
derfully wacky players does with flying colors. Rosanna
Arquette is excellent as the bored housewife and as her
alter-ego, Susan. Arquette, who was marvelous in her last
role as the protagonist in John Sayles's "Baby, It's You"
(she also starred in the television adaptation of Norman
Mailer's "The Executioner's Song"), has a unique qualtiy
and appeal — a freshness and honesty that leaps across
the screen in one of the most endearing personalities to
emerge from the 1980s crop of gifted young performers.
There is something so inextricably cute about her that its
hard not to fall head over heels for this illuminating screen
presence at first glance. This quality, however, is not with
out its dangers. Cuteness, while refreshing at first, can go
grow tiring (take Dudley Moore for example), and Ar
quette could be quickly typecast into playing young,
lovable, ingenues — a mold which can become hard to
break out of. Nevertheless, Arquette breathes freshness,
depth and sensitivity into her screen persona.
Madonna, who appears to make the transition from
video to film with effortless ease, is perfect as the uni
nhibited and Bohemian Susan. Madonna has a genuine
knack for comedy that steals the show at many points.
