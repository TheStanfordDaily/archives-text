# 'House of Bernarda Alba' marred by acting

### NANCY HENRY 
"The House of Bernarda Alba," a
dark and solemn drama by Spanish
playwright Federico Garcia Lorca, is
a potentially powerful and disturbing
tragedy in the classic style. Its pro
duction at the San Francisco
Repetory Theatre is dark and solemn,
but lacks the power to disturb and at
times even to interest its audience.
The play begins and ends with the
weaping and wailing apppropriate to
the funeral of a Spanish aristocrat and
to the oppressive, almost feudal at
mosphere of his household, which
now consists of six daughters, two
servants and a crazy old woman, all
suffering under the tyranny of the
proud and heartless widow, Bernarda
Alba. A pervading and leaden Catho
lic influence and restrictive social
structure are evident in the set,
costumes and speech of the charac
ters from the opening scene. The cast
is entirely female, and as soon as the
condition of the daughters becomes
clear, so does the corruptive,

degenerative nature of their situation.
More than the death of a father
plagues these women. Complete iso
lation from men and the constant
ravings of Bernarda that her children
are too good for the likes of the com-

mon men in their village, have
combined to pervert and distort the
attitudes of the daughters toward
emotions, marriage and sex and to
turn them against one another in a vi
scious and obsessive battle for the
one man in all their lives.
This is one of the best'known and

appreciated plays of Lorca, a severe
social critic who was considered a
threat to the government and conse
quently assassinated under Spain's
military regime in 1936. His critique
in this work is one that strikes at the

heart of the Spanish social order
while perceptively portraying human
nature under the extreme and un
natural stress. Many of the play's sub
tleties, however, seem to be lost in a
production that suffers from uneven
and mediocre performances. Each of
the daughters should obviously create

a unique persona on stage. Even their
names have a significance, one that in
this case can only be determined from
the context of the script, but some of
the characters are simply not
developed enough to make this an ef
fective device.
Angustias, for example, is indeed
anguished, for she is the one deceived
into believing the male suitor, Pepe el
Romano, is courting only her, yet
Susan Allen seems lost and somewhat
dispassionate as the eldest daughter
frightened only by the prospect of
growing old unmarried. Magdalena,
Mimi Unser, is cold and threatening,
a youthful portrait of the aging Ber
narda. Martirio sympathizes with the
insane old woman, played with a
crazed intensity by Gretchen Grant,
but just what it is about her character
that distinguishes her is unclear.
Pamela Minet plays the fiery Adela
whose spirit has yet to be broken; she
is willing to give herself wholly to this
one man, rather than remain in this

house of death with her sisters. The
performances are competent but
lackluster, and in a work which relies
so much on technichal and artistic
quality to keep the interest of a
modern audience, the production
sometimes drags and loses any
thematic thread of relevance, even its
universal element of human tragedy.
Rebecca Roper as Bernarda Alba

deserves particular mention here, for
though she was playing the role for
the first time (substituting for Kate
Black, unable to appear in several
performances), Roper demonstrated
more energy and life than any other
actresses.
The music, originally composed for
this production, is haunting if a bit
bizarre, contributing to the macabre,
depressing air in the small theater.
The size of the theater itself may have
been a problem with an ambitious,
large-casted piece probably intended
for a more traditional stage.

The play is indeed an interesting
psychological study of women
deprived of any kind of natural exis
tence and is an undoubtably accurate
portrait of the social repression which
has historically shaped and twisted
the Spanish aristocracy. This produc
tion, however, lacks the creativity and
vitality to make it a truly worthwhile
venture for those otherwise un
familiar with Lorca's work or not in
terested in classic drama. "The House
of Bernarda Alba" runs through
April 21 at the San Francisco
Repetory Theatre.
