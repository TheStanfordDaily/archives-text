# Slates propose ASSU changes
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Staff writer 
The Blue Chip, 4-C and Hammer
and Coffin (H & C) slates for Council
of Presidents clashed in a sparsely at
tended but wide-ranging discussion of
the ASSU at Branner Hall last night.
Contending the ASSU is a haven
for "resume-packing tards," H & C
called for the elimination of the
ASSU Senate.
"I think the Brady Bunch put it
best when they sang, 'When it's time
to change, you've got to rearrange,' "
said Tim Quirk, explaining the H & C
slate's plan to eliminate the senate.
H & C members Quirk, Leslie
Leland and Andy Frisch pledged to
change the ASSU from a "malignant
growth" bureaucracy to a "service"
organization. H & C member Mike
Collins was not present.
The 4-C slate said, however, that it

is only necessary to "streamline" the
ASSU while maintaining the same
services it now offers. The slate, many
of whose members are currently in
volved in the ASSU, said their exper
ience with student government would
be a vital asset.
"Lots of steps can be taken to
make the senate function more effec
tively," said 4-C member Eugene
Chen, currently an ASSU senator.
Other 4-C members are Randy
Cribbs, Laura Corser and Hubert
Cheng.
The "removal of bureaucracy" was
at the top of the agenda of Mike
Schenkman, Ken Ramberg, Brad
Hinrichs and Noah Croom of the
Blue Chip slate.
Schenkman is a sophomore history
major. Hinrichs, also a sophomore,

majors in both history and biology.
Schenkman is currently marketing
director of the Coffee House and
Hinrichs now is Sigma Chi pledge
president, Ramberg, a sophomore
political science/economics major,
has served as an intern for both
Grubb & Ellis and Shearson Lehman
American Express and Croom, a
sophomore economics major, has
been active in the ASSU Lobby Of
fice and Stanford-in-Government.
"Since I've been at this school,
nothing tangible has come back to me
(from the ASSU)," Ramberg said.
"The ASSU shouldn't be something
that's detached from the student
body."
Hinrichs said upgrading food ser
vice offerings to a Sterling Quad-type
system, improving the Concert Net
work and Speakers Bureau and in
stituting fee assessments for capital
improvements are the Blue Chip's
major goals.
On the 4-C, Chen, a junior, cur
rently serves on the Senate Appropri
ations, Shuttle Service, Outreach and
Undergraduate and Residential Edu
cation Committees. Cribbs, a junior
physics and history major, is a project
coordinator for the Stanford Volun
teer Network. Corser is a sophomore
public policy major, a member of the
Nominations Commission and direc
tor of ASSU internships. Cheng, a
junior biology major, has been
Lecture Notes project manager for
the past three years and served on the
ASSU Centennial Commission.
H & C member Quirk, a sopho
more communications major, is a
staff member of the Stanford Chapar
ral, the campus humor magazine, and
a KZSU staffer. Leland is a co
terminal senior majoring in product
design and mechanical engineering.
Frisch, a sophomore, is also a
Chappie staffer. Collins, a junior, is a
geology major and editor of the

Chaparral.
H & C proposes the elimination of
the senate and the placing its allocat
ing power into the hands of the stu
dents. "(The senate) served a pur
pose once, but it doesn't anymore,"
Quirk said. "Elect us and the senate
will exist no more."
Chen called for streamlined appro
priations procedures and restoration
of the integrity of the Program Board.
The 4-C slate proposed enlarging
the COP to five members, stirring up
opposition from the other slates.
"We would like to have five people
to cut through the normal, everyday
work that the COP is faced with,"
Corser said. "That way we can get
down to the projects that have to be
done."
4-C said its addition to the COP
would be Kathleen Stewart. Stewart's
name will not appear on the ballot,
but the other slates agreed this is per
fectly legal under the current ASSU
constitution.
Blue Chip member Schenkman
said he was "unsettled" about
whether a fifth representative was
needed, as it seemed to "contradict"
the 4-C desire for a streamlined gov
ernment.
"In order to change the system,
you have to work from the inside,"
Schenkman said, adding that his slate
supports a general rewriting of the
ASSU constitution in order to reduce
the number of senators.
Corser added that the Blue Chip
proposal to lower the number of
senators might cut down the diversity
of representation necessary in a good
organization.
Quirk countered that the ASSU
"doesn't represent students at all."
He proposed instead that all funding
issues should be decided by a direct
student ballot.
"As Tim says, it's so simplistic it's
beautiful," Frisch added. "Students
should have the ultimate say (about)
who should get funding "
Corser questioned the practicality
of the H & C proposal.
