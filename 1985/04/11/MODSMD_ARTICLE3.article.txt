### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Staff writer 
The Blue Chip, 4-C and Hammer
and Coffin (H & C) slates for Council
of Presidents clashed in a sparsely at
tended but wide-ranging discussion of
the ASSU at Branner Hall last night.
Contending the ASSU is a haven
for "resume-packing tards," H & C
called for the elimination of the
ASSU Senate.
"I think the Brady Bunch put it
best when they sang, 'When it's time
to change, you've got to rearrange,' "
said Tim Quirk, explaining the H & C
slate's plan to eliminate the senate.
H & C members Quirk, Leslie
Leland and Andy Frisch pledged to
change the ASSU from a "malignant
growth" bureaucracy to a "service"
organization. H & C member Mike
Collins was not present.
The 4-C slate said, however, that it

is only necessary to "streamline" the
ASSU while maintaining the same
services it now offers. The slate, many
of whose members are currently in
volved in the ASSU, said their exper
ience with student government would
be a vital asset.
"Lots of steps can be taken to
make the senate function more effec
tively," said 4-C member Eugene
Chen, currently an ASSU senator.
Other 4-C members are Randy
Cribbs, Laura Corser and Hubert
Cheng.
The "removal of bureaucracy" was
at the top of the agenda of Mike
Schenkman, Ken Ramberg, Brad
Hinrichs and Noah Croom of the
Blue Chip slate.

major. Hinrichs, also a sophomore,
