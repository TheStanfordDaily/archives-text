KZSU will air the most promising tracks from these albums tonight at 6.
The rating scale is from one to five stars.

USA For Africa —
We Are The World

There's no reason to rate this
entire album, first because it's hard
to rate a collection of independent
songs that differ widely in style and
quality, second because it'd be
pretty pretentious to do so. The
spirit behind this record is enough
to warrant its purchase, whether
the songs are good or not. And as a
bonus for being so altruistic, you
get "We Are The World," the
uplifting single that everyone's
heard (and sung along to, admit it)
already; "Tears Are Not Enough,"
its Canadian equivalent;
"Trapped," an awesome

Springsteen live cut; "Just a Little
Closer," by the Pointer Sisters;
"Trouble in Paradise," by Huey
Lewis; and five more songs that by
tontrast are mediocre. Prince's
track is probably the most disap
pointing on the album; "4 The
Tears In Your Eyes" sounds like it
was composed while Prince Himself
was riding a bus in Minneapolis —
and he apparently had to get off at
the next stop. But we shouldn't be
critical. The fact is that this is the
ideal record to shove in the faces of
rock-haters nationwide — it
demonstrates that the spirit that
drives the music, in the words of
Dr. Seuss, "means a little bit
more."

Tears For Fears — Songs From
The Big Chair ☆ ☆ Vi
The full-page advertisement an
nounces that "Songs From The Big
Chair" is a "masterwork of modern
pop design." What it Ls, in fact, is a
major disappointment. Tears For
Fears simply ignore the elements
which made their first album, "The
Hurting," so wonderful, and in
stead blithely present the sort of
synth-pop album which has made
bands such as Spandau Ballet rich
and famous. "The Hurting," with
its haunting lyrics, creative syn
thesizers and original melodies,
has been criticized for its intensity
and dirgeful qualities; this album
leaves its buyer listening for any

similar sense of purpose. In short,
"The Hurting" sounded like noth

ing else; this album sounds like
everything else. One has the feeling

that each song is a minute too long.
Neither the lyrics nor the music is
enough to hold one's attention
through the six minutes of
repetitious, programmed sound of
the "international hit," "Shout,"
and the same holds true for the
blend of "Broken" and "Head
Over Heels" into a pseudo-live
recording which reminds one more
of the soundtrack from a James
Bond movie than of carefully con
sidered music. However, these
changes do have their advantages:,
this album is much easier to listen
to than the first, should garner con
siderable airplay and should easily
best its predecessor's sales.
— Ben Vaughan

Jeff Beck, Pete .Townshend,
Herbie Hancock, Sly Dunbar,
Robbie Shakespeare and Nile
Rodgers appear on this album for
no reason. The underutilization of
big-name talent doesn't stop there,
either. Most of the songs on the al
bum would have been just as good
without Jagger himself. They would
have been regular old pop songs
that peak around 20 on the pop
charts. Just like they are. Jagger
without the Stones is tiresome,
stretched-out and just way too
commercial. Without the ample
personality of the rest of the band,
the rationale behind listening to the

songs is almost erased. Jagger's
cutesy raps in the middles of the
hits stand out as the best parts of
the record: a pretty pitiful state of
affairs. This is Jagger without the
artistic influences of the rest of the
group, able to do things exactly his
way. If it lets off steam, provides
room for creativity and keeps the
group from disbanding for a few
more years, people will stand for it.
After all, what would you rather
have: this and a new Stones album,
or nothing at all?
