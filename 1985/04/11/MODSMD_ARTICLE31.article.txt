# Gabriel's 'Birdy' record: innovative, 'progressive'
## 
### ANDREW CROWELL 
Every once in a while, a musician
comes along whose consistent inno
vation and charisma astound and
amaze both fans and critics alike.
Peter Gabriel is one such performer,
and his latest effort, a soundtrack to
the movie "Birdy," easily confirms
the noteworthy reputation he has
gained with his last five albums.
Gabriel, who began his musical
career with the group Genesis more
than a decade ago, turned solo in the
mid '70s and since that time has gath
ered the support of an extremely wide
and diversified audience. Hits like
"Shock the Monkey," "Solsbury
Hill" and"I Have the Touch"
received and still receive considerable
airplay, though never quite enough
to classify Gabriel as a mainstream
artist. Indeed, the largest portion of
Gabriel's work will probably never be
heard on the airwaves due to its ex
tremely progressive nature.
"Birdy," Gabriel's first attempt at
a movie score, combines some of this
musician's best material — new and
old — into a cohesive work that is
surprisingly listenable. No doubt the
reader will agree that other than a
very rare "Chariots of Fire" or "Star
Wars" soundtrack, many musical
works of this type simply grow old
and tiring all too quickly. The essen
tial problem is a lack or complete ab
sence of vocals; oftentimes, the music
simply fails to interest without its sup
porting visual image. "Birdy" has the
potential to fall into this same trap,
but Gabriel's artistic mastery
prevents this from happening. The
warning on the back cover that the al
bum contains "recycled material"
and no lyrics will no doubt scare off
many buyers, but pabriel has
blended just enough new with the old
and enough of his characteristic yelps
and howls to give the album momen
tum and more importantly substance.

"At Night" and "Floating Dogs"
both set rather serious and ominous
moods layered with Gabriel's
textured synthesizer sounds and
forebodingly primitive percussion.
The simple and beautifully melodic
"Close Up," taken from "Family
Snapshot," and the introspective
"Slow Water" are effectively inter
spersed to provide a relief from the
darker nature of the surrounding
tracks. After only the first few songs,
the album begins to closely resemble
a Brian Eno "Ambient" work; it is no
surprise to find that Eno's cohort
Daniel Lanois helped produce this al
bum. "Quiet and Alone" showcases
Gabriel's Prophet synthesizer and its
ability to reproduce virtually any
sound imaginable. "Sketchpad
With Trumpet and Voice" brilliantly

fuses Jon Hassel's warped trumpet
sounds with Gabriel's vocal acrobat
ics to create one or both performers'
most interesting pieces to date.
"Birdy" is a relatively short album,
but within it is a complete and satisfy
ing work. I must admit that on first
hearing, I was a bit disappointed with
the album, though I quickly dis
covered the problem was that I wasn't
playing it loud enough to fully appre
ciate the background effects or hyp
notizing quality of the drumbeats.
Truly this work reveals yet another
side of Gabriel's talent and ability as
an acitve, thinking musician. Al
though I have not yet seen the film
myself, I would venture to say that
this soundtrack must only enhance
"Birdy's" substance, as the score it
self has so much of its own to offer.


"Birdy" represents Peter Gabriel's first attempt at a film score.
Gabriel, who began his musical career more than a decade ago with the
rock group Genesis, turned solo in the mid-70s.
