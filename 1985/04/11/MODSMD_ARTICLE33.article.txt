## A 						classic work of magic realism is translated 
### Mario de Andrade 
"Macunaima"

Random House, $14.95

Let me start off by saying what
"Macunaima" isn't. It isn't a novel, or
a collection of short stories, or a work
of non-fiction. It's not even "new."
Although Random House just
released the first English translation,
the Brazilian poet Mario de Andrade
wrote the book in 1927.
To define what the book is is more
difficult. The dust jacket describes it
as a "folkloric rhapsody," but I've no
intention of trying to figure out what
that means. I'd call it a tale cycle, a
series of chapters that almost work as
separate stories, and are bound to
gether by a single theme. The book is
also — going back to the dust jacket
for confirmation — a "landmark
precursor of Latin American magical
realism."
Andrade is known best as a poet
and a writer of children's fantasy
stories. "Macunaima" has elements
of both; Andrade uses his poet's
sense of image and metaphor, and the
hero Macunaima's adventures bear
more than a little resemblence to
Grimm's fairytales in their combina
tion of magic, violence and ad
venture.
The stuff of "Macunaima,"
however, is not that of your typical
after-school children's special.
Macunaima, an Indian from the far
corner of Northern Brazil, travels
through his native land in search of a
magical amulet. Innocent enough.
But in his travels, Macunaima
becomes the emperor of the
Amazons by raping the Queen of the
Forest, decapitates the moon (a
"brutal bulldyke"), dresses up as a
french prostitute to seduce a man
eating giant, and continually fools
around with his older brother's
girlfriends, the daughters of the sun,
fishwives, and any other woman that
he sees.
This book isn't just crude, it's viol
ent. Macunaima often takes women
by force, and they enioy it. People die
— well, that's nothing special, but
they die horribly. For example,
Macunaima accidently kills himself

when a monkey suggests that he eat
his own "nuts," and gives him a rock
to crack them open. Much of the
book reads like a Brazilian "Naked
Lunch."
It's hard for me to decide whether
the crudity and violence in
"Macunaima" is unusual or
remarkable, because I know little or
nothing about Brazil in the 19205. In
fact, this is one of the biggest prob
lems I have with "Macunaima." I
suspect that the book is as much a so
cial document as a work of literature,
and I have trouble differentiating the
literary from the documentary. I
don't know how much of
"Macunaima" is a joke that I don't
get, and I suspect readers with the
same background as mine will also
feel themselves at a disdavantage.
The hero Macunaima and his brot
hers, Jigue and Manaape, come from
the jungles of Northern Brazil. Their
life in the rain forests is simple and
primitive — they sleep in hammocks,
pick ticks off their heads, eat fish
which they catch by beating the river
with sticks, and participate in tribal
dances and rituals. In the very begin
ning of the book, the story seems
timeless, and one supposes that the
story takes place a very long time ago,
during that interminate age when the
world was full of heroes, giants and
monsters.
The first few chapters read like a
somewhat raunchy fairytale.
Macunaima and Manaape use their
magic powers to get them out of fan
tastic situations. Macunaima tragi
cally loses his "ladylove" and em
barks on a quest to recover her stolen
jewel. And certain passages read like
fables; Macunaima invents the offi
cial swear of Brazil and the word
"asshole," and various characters get
sick of life and ascend to the heavens
as stars, planets or what have you.
But when Jigue, Manaape and
Macunaima near what Andrade calls
"the huge and uncouth city of Sao
Paulo," strange things begin to hap
pen that have nothing to do with the
magic of fairytales. The trio enter "a
broad savannah, which seemed to be
dotted with clusters of tall palm trees

... all bearing a plume of smoke in
the place of fronds." Macunaima im
mediately goes to bed with three
women he finds on the street, and
when he wakes up they explain to him
that "everything in the city was some
kind of machine contraption ... the
black pumas leaping through the
streets were really Fords, Chevrolets
and Dodges . . . the long-armed
monkey was called an elevator."
Macunaima discovers at the same
time we do that he is in the modern
day city of Sao Paulo, surrounded by
machines, tall buildings, cars and
commerce. He first reacts to
"machine-contraptions" the way he
reacts to everything else — he wants
to have sex with them, or at least with
the the Goddess of the Machine. He
has a hard time understanding that
this would not be a good idea. The
women of Sao Paulo enthrall him —
especially the prostitites — and he
writes home to his Amazon subjects
encouraging them to abandon their
Amazon ways and become more
whorelike.
At the same time Macunaima
becomes aware that there is more to
his native Brazil then he could have
ever imagined, the reader realizes
that Andrade is not writing about a
mythical past but rather the Brazil he
sees all around him. Later in the
book, a character named Hercules
Florence shouts "Remember the year
1927! I've just invented photogra
phy!"
So, though "Macunaima" initially
seems to be written about the long
ago and far away, Andrade is more
likely to be satirizing modern-day
Brazil than writing a quaint history of
the nation. In Macunaima's letter to
the Amazons, the satire is obvious;
Macunaima writes:
"(Sao Paulo) is intersected by
roads cleverly made narrow ... in
such a way as to render the arteries
incapable of letting the populace
through . . . the cops strive to
balances the excesses of public wealth
.. . they apply such diligence in this
effort that at every opportunity they
squander the nation's money."
If "Macunaima" is a social satire,

then I'm not sure if it fits into the
genre of magical realism. The storm
of butterflies in "One Hundred Years
Of Solitude" is magic for the sake of
magic; the animals that talk in
"Animal Farm" are "magical" for the
purposes of the story.
That doesn't mean I can't see how
Andrade was supposed to have in
fluenced Garcia Marquez, or magical
realists in general; a strict defininition
of magical realism is one which ac
cepts magic as commonplace. Often,
the "magic" occurs — as in
Andrade's book — when two cultures
collide, one primitive and the other
civilized and presumably "realistic."
But in other works of magical realism
that I've read, there is a tacit respect

for the magic described. Magic is pos
sible — a dog may talk, someone's
nose may become a foreign secretary
— but is isn't commonplace. In
"Macunaima" magic, not realism, is
the order of the day, and the book
does not have the tissue-filtered,
dreamlike quality of many "true"
works of that genre.
"Macunaima" was hard for me to
read through. I couldn't really care
about any of the characters, the lang
uage wasn't wonderful, and I got be
wildered, occasionally disgusted, by
what was going on in the narrative.
That doesn't mean I don't like the
book. I do. But I can't decide whether
I like it as a document, a piece of

writing, or a clever bag of literary
tricks.
At the end of the book,
Macunaima bails out and ascends to
the heavens, taking with him the
legends of his travels and heroic
deeds. His story is preserved when a
parrot lands on the narrator
(Andrade's) shoulder and tells him
the tale. Andrade prepares, as the
book ends, to tell the world the story
of Macunaima, explaining that he
"wants to start the voice of the world
singing in a vulgar tounguc." Since
English is getting to be a universal
language, he may well succeed with
the publication of this translation.

encouraging them to abandon their
Amazon ways and become more
whorelike.
At the same time Macunaima
becomes aware that there is more to
his native Brazil then he could have
ever imagined, the reader realizes
that Andrade is not writing about a
mythical past but rather the Brazil he
sees all around him. Later in the
book, a character named Hercules
Florence shouts "Remember the year
1927! I've just invented photogra
phy!"
So, though "Macunaima" initially
seems to be written about the long
ago and far away, Andrade is more
likely to be satirizing modern-day
Brazil than writing a quaint history of
the nation. In Macunaima's letter to
the Amazons, the satire is obvious;
Macunaima writes:
"(Sao Paulo) is intersected by
roads cleverly made narrow ... in
such a way as to render the arteries
incapable of letting the populace
through . . . the cops strive to
balances the excesses of public wealth
.. . they apply such diligence in this
effort that at every opportunity they
squander the nation's money."
If "Macunaima" is a social satire,

then I'm not sure if it fits into the
genre of magical realism. The storm
of butterflies in "One Hundred Years
Of Solitude" is magic for the sake of
magic; the animals that talk in
"Animal Farm" are "magical" for the
purposes of the story.
That doesn't mean I can't see how
Andrade was supposed to have in
fluenced Garcia Marquez, or magical
realists in general; a strict defininition
of magical realism is one which ac
cepts magic as commonplace. Often,
the "magic" occurs — as in
Andrade's book — when two cultures
collide, one primitive and the other
civilized and presumably "realistic."
But in other works of magical realism
that I've read, there is a tacit respect

for the magic described. Magic is pos
sible — a dog may talk, someone's
nose may become a foreign secretary
— but is isn't commonplace. In
"Macunaima" magic, not realism, is
the order of the day, and the book
does not have the tissue-filtered,
dreamlike quality of many "true"
works of that genre.
"Macunaima" was hard for me to
read through. I couldn't really care
about any of the characters, the lang
uage wasn't wonderful, and I got be
wildered, occasionally disgusted, by
what was going on in the narrative.
That doesn't mean I don't like the
book. I do. But I can't decide whether
I like it as a document, a piece of

writing, or a clever bag of literary
tricks.
At the end of the book,
Macunaima bails out and ascends to
the heavens, taking with him the
legends of his travels and heroic
deeds. His story is preserved when a
parrot lands on the narrator
(Andrade's) shoulder and tells him
the tale. Andrade prepares, as the
book ends, to tell the world the story
of Macunaima, explaining that he
"wants to start the voice of the world

"Macunaima"

Random House, $14.95

Let me start off by saying what
"Macunaima" isn't. It isn't a novel, or
a collection of short stories, or a work
of non-fiction. It's not even "new."
Although Random House just
released the first English translation,
the Brazilian poet Mario de Andrade
wrote the book in 1927.
To define what the book is is more
difficult. The dust jacket describes it
as a "folkloric rhapsody," but I've no
intention of trying to figure out what
that means. I'd call it a tale cycle, a
series of chapters that almost work as
separate stories, and are bound to
gether by a single theme. The book is
also — going back to the dust jacket
for confirmation — a "landmark
precursor of Latin American magical
realism."
Andrade is known best as a poet
and a writer of children's fantasy
stories. "Macunaima" has elements
of both; Andrade uses his poet's
sense of image and metaphor, and the
hero Macunaima's adventures bear
more than a little resemblence to
Grimm's fairytales in their combina
tion of magic, violence and ad
venture.
The stuff of "Macunaima,"
however, is not that of your typical
after-school children's special.
Macunaima, an Indian from the far
corner of Northern Brazil, travels
through his native land in search of a
magical amulet. Innocent enough.
But in his travels, Macunaima
becomes the emperor of the
Amazons by raping the Queen of the
Forest, decapitates the moon (a
"brutal bulldyke"), dresses up as a
french prostitute to seduce a man
eating giant, and continually fools
around with his older brother's
girlfriends, the daughters of the sun,
fishwives, and any other woman that
he sees.
This book isn't just crude, it's viol
ent. Macunaima often takes women
by force, and they enioy it. People die
— well, that's nothing special, but
they die horribly. For example,
Macunaima accidently kills himself

when a monkey suggests that he eat
his own "nuts," and gives him a rock
to crack them open. Much of the
book reads like a Brazilian "Naked
Lunch."
It's hard for me to decide whether
the crudity and violence in
"Macunaima" is unusual or
remarkable, because I know little or
nothing about Brazil in the 19205. In
fact, this is one of the biggest prob
lems I have with "Macunaima." I
suspect that the book is as much a so
cial document as a work of literature,
and I have trouble differentiating the
literary from the documentary. I
don't know how much of
"Macunaima" is a joke that I don't
get, and I suspect readers with the
same background as mine will also
feel themselves at a disdavantage.
The hero Macunaima and his brot
hers, Jigue and Manaape, come from
the jungles of Northern Brazil. Their
life in the rain forests is simple and
primitive — they sleep in hammocks,
pick ticks off their heads, eat fish
which they catch by beating the river
with sticks, and participate in tribal
dances and rituals. In the very begin
ning of the book, the story seems
timeless, and one supposes that the
story takes place a very long time ago,
during that interminate age when the
world was full of heroes, giants and
monsters.
The first few chapters read like a
somewhat raunchy fairytale.
Macunaima and Manaape use their
magic powers to get them out of fan
tastic situations. Macunaima tragi
cally loses his "ladylove" and em
barks on a quest to recover her stolen
jewel. And certain passages read like
fables; Macunaima invents the offi
cial swear of Brazil and the word
"asshole," and various characters get
sick of life and ascend to the heavens
as stars, planets or what have you.
But when Jigue, Manaape and
Macunaima near what Andrade calls
"the huge and uncouth city of Sao
Paulo," strange things begin to hap
pen that have nothing to do with the
magic of fairytales. The trio enter "a
broad savannah, which seemed to be
dotted with clusters of tall palm trees

... all bearing a plume of smoke in
the place of fronds." Macunaima im
mediately goes to bed with three
women he finds on the street, and
when he wakes up they explain to him
that "everything in the city was some
kind of machine contraption ... the
black pumas leaping through the
streets were really Fords, Chevrolets
and Dodges . . . the long-armed
monkey was called an elevator."
Macunaima discovers at the same
time we do that he is in the modern
day city of Sao Paulo, surrounded by
machines, tall buildings, cars and
commerce. He first reacts to
"machine-contraptions" the way he
reacts to everything else — he wants
to have sex with them, or at least with
the the Goddess of the Machine. He
has a hard time understanding that
this would not be a good idea. The
women of Sao Paulo enthrall him —
especially the prostitites — and he
writes home to his Amazon subjects
encouraging them to abandon their
Amazon ways and become more
whorelike.
At the same time Macunaima
becomes aware that there is more to
his native Brazil then he could have
ever imagined, the reader realizes
that Andrade is not writing about a
mythical past but rather the Brazil he
sees all around him. Later in the
book, a character named Hercules
Florence shouts "Remember the year
1927! I've just invented photogra
phy!"
So, though "Macunaima" initially
seems to be written about the long
ago and far away, Andrade is more
likely to be satirizing modern-day
Brazil than writing a quaint history of
the nation. In Macunaima's letter to
the Amazons, the satire is obvious;

"(Sao Paulo) is intersected by
roads cleverly made narrow ... in
such a way as to render the arteries
incapable of letting the populace

.. . they apply such diligence in this
effort that at every opportunity they
squander the nation's money."
