"During Ceasefire"

Harper & Row, $12.95.
John Tranter, an Australian poet
who read on campus this Tuesday,
was explaining to a group of students
and professors afterward how his
country is in the midst of a vital and
exciting time for poetry. And this suc
cessful creativity is owed in part, he
said, to the influence of American
poetry. But the work of the Beat and
New York writers of the' 50s and '60s
is what they are excited about, not
what is being written today. "The last
15 years or so have been a rather dry
period over in the states, one would
have to say."
You bet they have. I even bailed
out of my subscription to "The
American Poetry Review"; what
should be the exhibits of this
country's finest work are so uniformly
banal. The hokum divides itself into
two categories: There are the so
called exercises of formal ingenuity,
little diddles and precious things with
funny syllabic patterns, what I call
workshop-poems, eminently crafted,
but somehow dead (certainly over
wrought). The second category is ac
tually more prevalent, probably be
cause it takes less talent, and this is
the category I call the Hymn to the
Wimpy Ego— you know that kind of
poem I'm talking about, where a poet
gets up from his desk, tells the cat not
to miss him (or her), and then looks
through his favorite window at some
rock on the ground outside and
wonders how achingly lonely his
whining little soul is: "O humble
rock, with no feelings to utter / no
fingers to type / with. / One of
us / might be / the lucky / er."
This is what has been missing: one,
that a poem, in part at least, can ad
dress other people, that it not always

be "overheard," that it be, in a sense,
"public"; and two (it is amazing that
this has to be re-asserted), that "the
structure of the poem (be tied to
gether with) everything in the social,
economic complex of the world"
(William Carlos Williams), in short,
that it attempt to match in language
the absolute and dire newness of what
is happening in the world, technologi
cally or religiously or politically, crass
or sublime— that it not stand still or
breathe easy.
I don't want to overstate this (too
much): there are many American
poets who are legitimately inventive
(Charles Bernstein, Robert Duncan,
David Antin, Adrienne Rich, to
name a few Californians) but what
does it say about American culture
when our enfants terribles are in their
50s, if not dead? We are living at a
time, I think, just before American
writers get on the stick again. So it is
with an especial closeness that one
looks at the first book of a young
poet.
S. Ben-Tov's "During Ceasefire" is
her first book, and the success and
verve with which she presents a vision
both particularly personal and en
gaged by shared and global concerns
make its publication a happy,
exceptional event.
Perhaps what is at first most strik
ing about the poetry in Ben-Tov's
book is how, in contrast to the main
stream of stuff today, there is no
solipsism in it, no perverse facile
angst. The poems in "During
Ceasefire" explore various voices,
times and terrains other than the
poet's own— without any of the con
descension that often comes when a
poet aims oh-so-empathetically to
speak for the "other."
My favorite section of the book is a
series of poems written in the voice of

Amelia Earhart, the famed woman
pilot whose boldness, charm and
mysterious disappearance have made
her, here, a mythic figure. Indeed, she
appears as a muse for poetry, ex
emplifying both boundless explora
tion and attention to detail: "What's
not trivial: attention to the

board, / not to dishonor my englobed
flight/and the Electra with near
misses. / Calculation suits the stars. I
play / my eyes and fingers over dials,
and adjust; / the wings alter and bal
ance. / We are still on course, / and
the real course, the aimless up
ward, / surrounds me like a mind." In
"Earhart Flies Through the Mon
soon," the language rushes mus
cularly without being breathless:

"terror unfastens my heart! But I am
will, / my wild gauges steadying
toward luminous numbers / as we
nose down against the groin of the
winds. / Strung lightening fuses me;
trapped in the panel / the compass
revolves backward; cold / sun, feath
er floating in the fuselage, come

home / breathing; my hand controls
the ailerons; / let us stroke down this
rift the world is beginning / to appear
in."
This combination of jarring, beau
tiful imagery with lines of
proclamatory stateliness recalls, in
some ways, the work of Adrienne
Rich. Like Rich, Ben-Tov dreams of
forging a "common language" with
which women can speak of experi

ences that are singularly feminine and
hence have been treated in the
canonical works of literature with
silence only. In "Carillon for
Cambridge Women," the poet asks of
the local women artists, "Who will re
member us?" and then, in powerful
simplicity, lists their first names, this

The poems explore various voices,
times and terrains other than the
poet's own — without any of the
condescension that often comes when
a poet aims oh-so-empathetically to
speak for the 'other.'

poem being a marker of their achieve
ment. A new art and a new commu
nity is coming: "The horizon of
caryatids, carved in distorted
heat,/from their pyres support the
dome of sunrise. / Their robes flicker
at the rim of clear thinking."
If, as I said, these poems occasion
ally evoke the tone of other poets,
their voice — their voices — belong
to a new and distinctive talent. The
range in the forms Ben-Tov both
adopts and invents is impressively
wide. She is equally adept at various
so-called closed forms — couplets,
tercets, she even pulls off a convinc
ing sestina — as well as more elastic
free-verse arrangements. Most singu
lar, though, is a certain texture of ex
perience that informs these poems.
The title poem is "about" the poet's
time in Israel and the emotional am
bivalence of her relationship to her

father, who, she notes, "invented Is
rael's first rocket bomb." "Suicides
annoy him," she writes. "He hides
grenades, / like the children's game
with painted eggs / he used to play in
Europe with his sister. / He experi
ments; a field goes up in puffs."
Back in the United States, among

the sheltered classiness of an Ivy
League university, the tragedy and
hope of Israel inform her thinking in
a persistent but understated way. The
language of romance now seems
tainted: "He calls her 'darling';/ / She
has many memories / she has seen the
pale puff, like chaff, / of a green val
ley struck by shellfire;// He calls her
'little girlV/She believes that she is
mortal."
Ben-Tov's is an uncommonly able
and far-ranging debut. Already
beyond the sappy conventions that
get senseless applause these days, and
untempted by doctrinaire evaluations
of feminism or Zionism, her work has
created a space for itself where it can
think freely, or to use her own words,
where it would enter into "a constel
lation of pure travel."

In an era when very little good American poetry is written, young poets
like S. Ben-Tov should be watched closely.

said, to the influence of American
poetry. But the work of the Beat and
New York writers of the' 50s and '60s
is what they are excited about, not
what is being written today. "The last
15 years or so have been a rather dry
period over in the states, one would
have to say."
You bet they have. I even bailed
out of my subscription to "The
American Poetry Review"; what
should be the exhibits of this
country's finest work are so uniformly
banal. The hokum divides itself into
two categories: There are the so
called exercises of formal ingenuity,
little diddles and precious things with
funny syllabic patterns, what I call
workshop-poems, eminently crafted,
but somehow dead (certainly over
wrought). The second category is ac
tually more prevalent, probably be
cause it takes less talent, and this is
the category I call the Hymn to the
Wimpy Ego— you know that kind of
poem I'm talking about, where a poet
gets up from his desk, tells the cat not
to miss him (or her), and then looks
through his favorite window at some
rock on the ground outside and
wonders how achingly lonely his
whining little soul is: "O humble
rock, with no feelings to utter / no
fingers to type / with. / One of
us / might be / the lucky / er."
This is what has been missing: one,
that a poem, in part at least, can ad
dress other people, that it not always

be "overheard," that it be, in a sense,
"public"; and two (it is amazing that
this has to be re-asserted), that "the
structure of the poem (be tied to
gether with) everything in the social,
economic complex of the world"
(William Carlos Williams), in short,
that it attempt to match in language
the absolute and dire newness of what
is happening in the world, technologi
cally or religiously or politically, crass
or sublime— that it not stand still or
breathe easy.
I don't want to overstate this (too
much): there are many American
poets who are legitimately inventive
(Charles Bernstein, Robert Duncan,
David Antin, Adrienne Rich, to
name a few Californians) but what
does it say about American culture
when our enfants terribles are in their
50s, if not dead? We are living at a
time, I think, just before American
writers get on the stick again. So it is
with an especial closeness that one
looks at the first book of a young
poet.
S. Ben-Tov's "During Ceasefire" is
her first book, and the success and
verve with which she presents a vision
both particularly personal and en
gaged by shared and global concerns
make its publication a happy,
exceptional event.
Perhaps what is at first most strik
ing about the poetry in Ben-Tov's
book is how, in contrast to the main
stream of stuff today, there is no
solipsism in it, no perverse facile
angst. The poems in "During
Ceasefire" explore various voices,
times and terrains other than the
poet's own— without any of the con
descension that often comes when a
poet aims oh-so-empathetically to
speak for the "other."
My favorite section of the book is a
series of poems written in the voice of

Amelia Earhart, the famed woman
pilot whose boldness, charm and
mysterious disappearance have made
her, here, a mythic figure. Indeed, she
appears as a muse for poetry, ex
emplifying both boundless explora
tion and attention to detail: "What's
not trivial: attention to the

board, / not to dishonor my englobed
flight/and the Electra with near
misses. / Calculation suits the stars. I
play / my eyes and fingers over dials,
and adjust; / the wings alter and bal
ance. / We are still on course, / and
the real course, the aimless up
ward, / surrounds me like a mind." In
"Earhart Flies Through the Mon
soon," the language rushes mus
cularly without being breathless:

"terror unfastens my heart! But I am
will, / my wild gauges steadying
toward luminous numbers / as we
nose down against the groin of the
winds. / Strung lightening fuses me;
trapped in the panel / the compass
revolves backward; cold / sun, feath
er floating in the fuselage, come

home / breathing; my hand controls
the ailerons; / let us stroke down this
rift the world is beginning / to appear
in."
This combination of jarring, beau
tiful imagery with lines of
proclamatory stateliness recalls, in
some ways, the work of Adrienne
Rich. Like Rich, Ben-Tov dreams of
forging a "common language" with
which women can speak of experi

ences that are singularly feminine and
hence have been treated in the
canonical works of literature with
silence only. In "Carillon for
Cambridge Women," the poet asks of
the local women artists, "Who will re
member us?" and then, in powerful
simplicity, lists their first names, this

The poems explore various voices,
times and terrains other than the
poet's own — without any of the

speak for the 'other.'

poem being a marker of their achieve
ment. A new art and a new commu
nity is coming: "The horizon of
caryatids, carved in distorted
heat,/from their pyres support the
dome of sunrise. / Their robes flicker
at the rim of clear thinking."
If, as I said, these poems occasion
ally evoke the tone of other poets,
their voice — their voices — belong
to a new and distinctive talent. The
range in the forms Ben-Tov both
adopts and invents is impressively
wide. She is equally adept at various
so-called closed forms — couplets,
tercets, she even pulls off a convinc
ing sestina — as well as more elastic
free-verse arrangements. Most singu
lar, though, is a certain texture of ex
perience that informs these poems.
The title poem is "about" the poet's
time in Israel and the emotional am
bivalence of her relationship to her

father, who, she notes, "invented Is
rael's first rocket bomb." "Suicides
annoy him," she writes. "He hides
grenades, / like the children's game
with painted eggs / he used to play in
Europe with his sister. / He experi
ments; a field goes up in puffs."
Back in the United States, among

the sheltered classiness of an Ivy
League university, the tragedy and
hope of Israel inform her thinking in
a persistent but understated way. The
language of romance now seems
tainted: "He calls her 'darling';/ / She
has many memories / she has seen the
pale puff, like chaff, / of a green val
ley struck by shellfire;// He calls her
'little girlV/She believes that she is
mortal."
Ben-Tov's is an uncommonly able
and far-ranging debut. Already
beyond the sappy conventions that
get senseless applause these days, and
untempted by doctrinaire evaluations
of feminism or Zionism, her work has
created a space for itself where it can
think freely, or to use her own words,
where it would enter into "a constel
lation of pure travel."
— Bob Basil


In an era when very little good American poetry is written, young poets
like S. Ben-Tov should be watched closely.
