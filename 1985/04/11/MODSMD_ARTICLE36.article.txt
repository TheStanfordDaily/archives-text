## Hook will receive Medal of Freedom 
### 
President Reagan has announced
he will award the Presidential Medal
of Freedom, the nation's highest civil
ian award, to a Hoover Institution
senior research fellow on May 23.
Sidney Hook, professor emeritus of
philosophy at New York University,
will be honored for his contributions
in the fields of education and philoso
phy.
Hook, 82, has done intensive re

search into the causes and conse
quences of totalitarianism and has
opposed totalitarian influences in the
intellectual world. Collegues say he is
an example of his own dictum:
"Man's vocation should be the use of
the arts of intelligence in behalf of
human freedom."
He is also well known in the aca
demic community for his historical
and analytical work on Karl Marx and
the varieties of history.
