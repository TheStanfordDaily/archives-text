# Radio debate pits U.S. vs. Soviets
## 
### BRYAN WALSER Staff writer 
In a rare public exchange between
Soviet and American arms control
experts, a Stanford scientist told two
Soviet scientists during a public radio
program aired yesterday that "a win
dow of opportunity" exists to limit
the development of space-based
weapons because "neither country
has a capability that is extremely ad
vanced at this time."
Sidney Drell, deputy director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
and co-director of the Center for In
ternational Security and Arms Con
trol here, made his remarks during a
special broadcast by KQED-FM of
San Francisco. He was joined by
William Perry, also of the arms con
trol center and a former member of
President Reagan's Scowcroft Com
mission.
Yevgeniy Velikhov, vice president
of the Soviet Academy of Sciences,
and Raold Sadgeyev, director of the
Institute for Space Research of the
Soviet Academy of Sciences, partici
pated in the exchange from Moscow
via satellite.
The experts concurred that space
should not become a battleground
between the superpowers. Disagree
ment focused on the Soviets' self
proclaimed moratorium on all space
weapons research, announced in Au
gust 1983.
When the Soviets endorsed the
moratorium, they had already
developed anti-satellite weapons of
their own, according to Walter Soy of
Lawrence Livermore Laboratories,
who was quoted in a pre-recorded in
terview.
Drell said, "It's always easy to say,
'Let's have a moratorium,' when one
side has developed something and the
other hasn't— that's the trouble with
moratoria: They always comes after
one side has done something and the
other hasn't."
Another point of conflict arose
over a Feb. 18 story in the London
Guardian quoted by Lynn Joiner, the
program's host.
The Guardian reported that
Velikov attended a Stockholm con
ference of scientists and said the So

viet Union was no longer going to
push for a ban on anti-satellite weap
ons and indicated the Soviet Union
was going to start testing anti-satellite
weapons again.
During the broadcast, Velikov,
speaking in English, first replied that
"It is a completely misleading obser
vation because I never spoke there."
He then reconsidered and said, "I
spoke in London and Stockholm in a
completely different way. Our pro
posal, the treaty of '83, is to ban all
weapons in space, not only anti
satellite weapons, but all weapons in
space which it is possible to use
against any target in the surface, air
or atmosphere. It is unproductive to
divide this treaty into parts. I think
the one answer to the arms race in
space is to ban all weapons in space.
It is my main point."
After the program, Joiner ex
pressed disappointment with the
Soviets' lack of candor. She attrib
uted it to the program being recorded
on the evening of April 1 — the
morning of April 2 in Moscow and
the day Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger released the Pentagon
booklet, "Soviet Military Power."
Joiner suspects the Soviets had prior
knowledge of the press conference
and ordered Velikov and Sadgeyev to
stick very closely to the party line.
She said she was "disappointed that
the Soviets were not as interested in
dialogue as I would have hoped."
Joiner said she has been in contact
with Gosteleradio, the Soviet State
Committee on Television and Radio,
since February 1983. Calling her ef
forts "hard plow work," Joiner said
she finalized arrangements for the
broadcast in February of this year.
She told Gosteleradio she would pro
vide a non-governmental channel
through which the Soviets could in
itiate a dialogue about space weap
ons.
She said she emphasized to Soviet
authorities that Americans are not
stupid and know the Soviet Union has
an anti-satellite weapon in orbit and
are aware that both sides have been
engaged in space weapons research
for many years.
