# Minority grad enrollment drops
## 
### DAVID S. GOLDSTEIN Staff writer 
Stanford graduate programs enrolled 27
fewer new students of "targeted" minority
backgrounds this year than last year — a
21 percent decrease, according to this
year's annual report on graduate student
affirmative action.
The report, by Vice Provost Gerald
Lieberman, is being distributed to Faculty
Senate members this week and will be dis
cussed at the senate's April 18 meeting.
Blacks, Chicanos, Native Americans and
Puerto Ricans collectively constitute 385

enrolled graduate students this year, down
from 397 last year. Those minorities
represented 5.9 percent of all graduate
students last year but only 5.7 percent this
year, the report said.
And, despite this year's 5 percent in
crease in graduate applications from tar
geted minorities, 12 percent fewer were
admitted and 21 percent fewer enrolled.
The largest minority enrollment declines
occurred in the schools of law, medicine
and engineering, the report said.
Lieberman, who also serves as dean of
graduate studies and research, said he was
discouraged that fewer admitted minority

students enrolled this year than in 1983-
84.
"It is unclear whether more of these stu
dents went to other universities or decided
not to pursue graduate studies at all," the
report said. Lieberman added that any ex
planations would be speculative.
"We need to be far more aggressive in
pursuing the students who have been ad
mitted," said Cecilia Burciaga, associate
dean of the graduate division.
Burciaga, who was extensively involved
in preparing the report, suggested the Uni
versity call rather than write students to in

form them that they are admitted. She said
she feels phone calls would personalize the
offers of admission and give the University
an opportunity to survey the feelings of
prospective graduate students.
"There are still a lot of factors that are
still unknown," she said, but she added
that financial aid is becoming more critical.
Burciaga said her office is charting
minority applications, admissions and en
rollments of the past decade to supplement
the report, which only cites figures for this
year and last. She expects to finish that
project in two months.
