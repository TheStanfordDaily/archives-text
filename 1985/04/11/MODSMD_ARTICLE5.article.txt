# The 						Draw: same houses, new ritual
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Editorial staff 
Inquisitive freshmen roam the
campus, asking upperclassmen how
many sundecks each Row house has
to offer. Persistent co-op patrons
stand in White Plaza, luring passers
by with fresh-baked bread. Com
placent Storey House residents
stride across campus, sporting "We
got in" dorm T-shirts.
Some of the rules have changed,
but the object of the game has not:
Pick a lucky number in Stanford's
annual Undergraduate Housing
Draw and live a year of luxury.
The 1985 Draw is scheduled for
April 23-26, at the Clubhouse in the
Old Union Courtyard. Residential
Education plans to distribute this
year's Drawbooks tomorrow,
marking the start of the complex
house-visiting and priority
gathering rituals that precede the
Draw each year.
"It's going to be an interesting
Draw," says Rodger Whitney, assis
tant dean of Student Affairs and
director of the Housing Center.
"There are a lot of changes from
last year."
The most important change will
"strengthen the guaranteed status"
by allowing all students with
guaranteed housing for the upcom
ing year to draw from a better pool
of numbers than their unguaranteed
counterparts, according to Whitney.
Whitney said the change, which
was recommended by the Commit
tee on Services to Students-
Residences, a Res Ed advisory
group, will "help people in their
guaranteed year to have a better
shot at getting into some of the
more popular residences."
Guaranteed students will draw
from a bin of numbers ranging from
0001 to 3,000, giving them a great
advantage over all unguaranteed
students, who will draw from num
bers 3,001 through 5,000. In past
years, all students drew from the
same pool of numbers, and un
guaranteed students who made the
assignable group — determined by
the total number of housing spaces
available — often had a good
chance of getting more desirable
housing than some guaranteed stu
dents.

Other changes in the Draw affect
housing priorities and the future
status of three residences.
In past years, students could get
an SI (the highest) priority at some
campus residences by fulfilling cer
tain requirements, such as taking
four East Asian Studies courses for
the East House. But starting this
year, the highest priority at every
residence will be the returning resi
dent priority.
Returning residents at the Suites
should be aware that Res Ed has al
tered the top priority there to limit
its use. This year, students living in
six-person suites can use the return
ing resident priority only to return
to six-person suites, and those in
four-person suites can use their top
priority only for four-person suites.
Last year, the four-person suites
for males filled completely with re
turning residents, largely because
six-man suite residents formed
groups of four and used the return
ing resident priority to get into the
smaller suites. Whitney said the
priority change for the Suites should
thwart a recurrence.

Two co-ops and one theme house
which "have had difficulty filling in
the past three years" will be
switched to University-operated or
self-operated housing if they do not
fill 90 percent of their assignable
spaces after round two of the Draw
this year, Whitney said.
Co-op residents have launched a
campaign — using bread-baking tal
ent to their advantage — to interest
students in their mode of housing,
specifically in Terra and Synergy,
the two co-ops Res Ed is consider
ing altering. The French House may
also undergo a program change
pending the results of the Draw.
"It's our hope that they've all
done enough outreach and given
enough priorities that they'll fill,"
Whitney said. "We'd like to keep
the programs."
The following are some other
changes affecting this year's Draw:
• Under the revised waiting-list
policy, students will receive a num
ber above 5,000, instead of a date
position as used in previous years,
when they join the waiting list after
round two of the Draw. "We will

take numbers in order, and students
can sequence themselves better and
see where they are on the list,"
Whitney said.
• Two dorms that currently have
only single-sex floors — Stern's
Burbank and Wilbur's Okada —
will each have a co-ed floor and an
equal number of males and females
next year, in hopes of increasing the
dorms' popularity, Whitney said.
• The charge for staying in the
Draw through the second round and
then not accepting housing has been
raised from $10 to $25. (Leaving
the Draw after round one assign
ments, as pledges of housed frater
nities traditionally do, is not a viola
tion of Draw regulations and thus
carries no fee.)
• For the first time, Res Ed has stip
ulated a maximum number of stu
dents allowed to draw together.
That number is eight. Further, be
cause students with guaranteed
housing will be drawing from a dif
ferent pool of numbers than those
with unguaranteed housing, all
members of groups drawing to
gether must have the same housing
status for the upcoming year.
• Res Ed has instituted a new
restrictive smoking policy in which
"the tie goes to the non-smoker
everywhere," Whitney said.
Whitney said that current Draw
policies are complex but that Res
Ed is working to simplify them each
year. He advises students who are
unclear about policies to "read the
Drawbook, talk to RAs, talk to
upper-class students . . . and don't
guess on anything." He adds, "Visit
as many houses as possible, get all
possible priorities . . . and don't
second-guess the Draw by [using]
last year's cutoff numbers to make
your choices.
He said students with guaranteed
housing must use 006 (any campus
residence) as their final choice if
they want to ensure that they
receive a housing assignment.
Whitney said the University is
considering possibilities for building
more undergraduate housing. Stan
ford currently houses 87 percent of
all undergraduates who are enrolled
and not on overseas programs, he
said.

Some of the rules have changed,
but the object of the game has not:
Pick a lucky number in Stanford's
annual Undergraduate Housing
Draw and live a year of luxury.
The 1985 Draw is scheduled for
April 23-26, at the Clubhouse in the
Old Union Courtyard. Residential
Education plans to distribute this
year's Drawbooks tomorrow,
marking the start of the complex
house-visiting and priority
gathering rituals that precede the
Draw each year.
"It's going to be an interesting
Draw," says Rodger Whitney, assis
tant dean of Student Affairs and
director of the Housing Center.
"There are a lot of changes from
last year."
The most important change will
"strengthen the guaranteed status"
by allowing all students with
guaranteed housing for the upcom
ing year to draw from a better pool
of numbers than their unguaranteed
counterparts, according to Whitney.
Whitney said the change, which
was recommended by the Commit
tee on Services to Students-
Residences, a Res Ed advisory
group, will "help people in their
guaranteed year to have a better
shot at getting into some of the
more popular residences."
Guaranteed students will draw
from a bin of numbers ranging from
0001 to 3,000, giving them a great
advantage over all unguaranteed
students, who will draw from num
bers 3,001 through 5,000. In past
years, all students drew from the
same pool of numbers, and un
guaranteed students who made the
assignable group — determined by
the total number of housing spaces
available — often had a good
chance of getting more desirable
housing than some guaranteed stu
dents.

Other changes in the Draw affect
housing priorities and the future
status of three residences.
In past years, students could get
an SI (the highest) priority at some
campus residences by fulfilling cer
tain requirements, such as taking
four East Asian Studies courses for
the East House. But starting this
year, the highest priority at every
residence will be the returning resi
dent priority.
Returning residents at the Suites
should be aware that Res Ed has al
tered the top priority there to limit
its use. This year, students living in
six-person suites can use the return
ing resident priority only to return
to six-person suites, and those in
four-person suites can use their top
priority only for four-person suites.
Last year, the four-person suites
for males filled completely with re
turning residents, largely because
six-man suite residents formed
groups of four and used the return
ing resident priority to get into the
smaller suites. Whitney said the
priority change for the Suites should
thwart a recurrence.

Two co-ops and one theme house
which "have had difficulty filling in
the past three years" will be
switched to University-operated or
self-operated housing if they do not
fill 90 percent of their assignable
spaces after round two of the Draw
this year, Whitney said.
Co-op residents have launched a
campaign — using bread-baking tal
ent to their advantage — to interest
students in their mode of housing,
specifically in Terra and Synergy,
the two co-ops Res Ed is consider
ing altering. The French House may
also undergo a program change
pending the results of the Draw.
"It's our hope that they've all
done enough outreach and given
enough priorities that they'll fill,"
Whitney said. "We'd like to keep
the programs."
The following are some other
changes affecting this year's Draw:
• Under the revised waiting-list
policy, students will receive a num
ber above 5,000, instead of a date
position as used in previous years,
when they join the waiting list after
round two of the Draw. "We will

take numbers in order, and students
can sequence themselves better and
see where they are on the list,"
Whitney said.
• Two dorms that currently have
only single-sex floors — Stern's
Burbank and Wilbur's Okada —
will each have a co-ed floor and an
equal number of males and females
next year, in hopes of increasing the
dorms' popularity, Whitney said.
• The charge for staying in the
Draw through the second round and
then not accepting housing has been
raised from $10 to $25. (Leaving
the Draw after round one assign
ments, as pledges of housed frater
nities traditionally do, is not a viola
tion of Draw regulations and thus
carries no fee.)
• For the first time, Res Ed has stip
ulated a maximum number of stu
dents allowed to draw together.
That number is eight. Further, be
cause students with guaranteed
housing will be drawing from a dif
ferent pool of numbers than those
with unguaranteed housing, all
members of groups drawing to
gether must have the same housing
status for the upcoming year.
• Res Ed has instituted a new
restrictive smoking policy in which
"the tie goes to the non-smoker
everywhere," Whitney said.
Whitney said that current Draw
policies are complex but that Res
Ed is working to simplify them each
year. He advises students who are
unclear about policies to "read the
Drawbook, talk to RAs, talk to
upper-class students . . . and don't
guess on anything." He adds, "Visit
as many houses as possible, get all
possible priorities . . . and don't
second-guess the Draw by [using]
last year's cutoff numbers to make
your choices.
He said students with guaranteed
housing must use 006 (any campus
residence) as their final choice if
they want to ensure that they
receive a housing assignment.
Whitney said the University is
considering possibilities for building
more undergraduate housing. Stan
ford currently houses 87 percent of
all undergraduates who are enrolled
and not on overseas programs, he
said.
