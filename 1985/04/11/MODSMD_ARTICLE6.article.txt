# Amendment 14
## Fee refund change opposed 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
Vowing to protect the current fee
assessment refund system, the Stan
ford Libertarians are campaigning
against the ASSU's Constitutional
Amendment 14.
The Libertarians have started the
Campaign to Save Refund Rights in
opposition to the amendment, which
would eliminate cash student fee
assessment refunds. The group dis
tributed fliers at registration and is
planning to put up posters on campus
as part of the campaign.
Students are now able to receive
refunds for student groups with which
they do not agree. Constitutional
Amendment 14 would change this
system and "proposes that the fees of
those students who object to the
funding of an organization would be
transferred, instead, to a special fund,

thus depriving the organization to
which they object of the use of their
money," according to the ASSU
Elections Handbook.
If passed, the amendment, spon
sored by Mark Soble, chairman of the
Senate Budget and Finance Commit
tee, would take effect with fees col
lected in the 1986-87 academic year.
Sophomore Tim Groseclose, the
leader of the Stanford Libertarians,
said the ASSU has enjoyed "over a
decade of proven success" with a sys
tem of refundable fees.
Fee refunds were originally in
stituted in 1972 on the premise that
people who are not interested in a
particular program shouldn't have to
pay for it, according to Bill Evers, a
member of Stanford Libertarians. He
said he thinks that premise is still
valid.
Soble said, however, that "most
people get money back because they
like money, and not because they
dislike the student organization. It is
a classic example of the free rider."
Students can, therefore, "get
whatever advantages derived from
these services without paying for it,"
said Senate Chair Eric Berg.
"On the average, every time a stu
dent organization wants to spend a
dollar, we end up taxing the student
$1.33," Berg said. Therefore, every
one who is not getting refunds is
being charged a higher amount, he
said.
Berg said the senate's recommen
dation in the handbook is "neutral"
because many graduate students were
against the measure. Many graduate
students do not necessarily benefit
from the organizations to which they
pay money, he said.
Also, if the amendment passes,
some people will vote no across the
board to lower the overall amount of
fee assessments, said Senator Jeff
Soukup. As a result, some very im

portant programs will be eliminated,
he said.
Evers said another reason for in
stituting fee refunds was that some
believed the ASSU would "become a
playpen for student politics" unless
some "check is placed on them." He
also said the ASSU's financial man
agement of the Coffee House is fur
ther evidence that students should be
wary of the ASSU's ability to handle
money.
In response, Soble said, "that (their
argument) just wouldn't be applica
ble or relevant."
He said the ASSU "will not di
rectly receive any of the money that
the ASSU gets. The money goes di
rectly to the student organizations."
Soble said that, because 20 to 25
percent of students get refunds, if his
amendment is passed the ASSU will
have to collect less money for fee as
sessments. Also, people are more
likely to take their votes seriously be
cause they will not be able to get their
money back in cash, he said. Soble
emphasized that his amendment still
allows students to prevent groups
from getting their money if they are
against that group.
