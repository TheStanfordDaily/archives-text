Saying "hunger is continuing to
grow as a problem" in the United
States, a featured speaker in the
week-long hunger conference here
blasted Reagan administration health
and welfare policies in a speech yes
terday at Kresge Auditorium.
"We have regressed in reflecting
our basic decency in our public
policies," said Larry Brown, chair
man of the Physician Task Force on
Hunger in America and a Harvard
University faculty member. "I think
we have a crisis in America... . Noth
ing better reflects that problem than
hunger in a nation of wealth."
Hunger is "a political phenome
non" that "has to be a bipartisan
issue," Brown said, saying "today our
leaders are not responding" to the
needs of those who are unable or can
not afford to feed themselves.
"Survival is a do-it-yourself proposi
tion" under the policies of the

Reagan administration, he said.
"We don't have a resource prob
lem; we have a priority problem,"
Brown said, saying that if funds now
spent on military projects were trans
ferred to health and welfare pro
grams, domestic hunger problems
could be solved.
With additional funding, programs
now in place "can end hunger in six
months," he said.
"This is not the first time that we
have seen hunger in this country,"
Brown said, pointing out that hunger
in the 1960s was alleviated through
expansion of the food stamp and
school lunch programs.
"For more than a decade, hunger
was virtually eliminated as a problem
in this country," he said.
Hunger is "fundamentally a reflec
tion of poverty," and budget cuts in
the areas of health and welfare have
shrunk the safety net of programs
established to keep people above the
poverty level, Brown said.
He said one-third of the families
below the poverty level are
ineligible for food stamps, adding that
food stamps only provide each person
with 49 cents per meal. Twelve billion
dollars was cut from food assistance
programs from 1982-85, "when the
need was peaking dramatically," he
said.
Hunger "was caused — it wasn't an
accident," Brown said.
Brown told of numerous instances
of extreme poverty and hunger he
witnessed last year during travels

across the country as a member of the
hunger task force.
One case involved a woman living
in the Rio Grande Valley with eight
children and a disabled husband. The
woman had run out of food stamps
earlier in the month, and the dinner
for the entire family consisted of
three tortillas, a cup of milk and a
container of cold water.
Brown also spoke of hunger "in
America's bread basket," citing in
stances of patients with symptoms of
starvation at Chicago's Cook County
Hospital.
He concluded with a brief question
and answer period, encouraging
members of the audience to urge
their governmental representatives to
increase spending on programs to al
leviate hunger.
