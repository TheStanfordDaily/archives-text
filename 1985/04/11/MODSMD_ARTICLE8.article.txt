Artificial heart patient is well
STOCKHOLM, Sweden — Doctors said yesterday the fourth man to
receive a permanent artificial heart was doing "surprisingly well" yester
day three days after the implant.
But the patient's doctors refused to identify him or comment on
reports that he was 53-year-old Leif Stenberg, a defendant in a tax eva
sion trial who came to be known in Sweden's tabloids as "Mr. X."
"For the time being we are very content with his condition," said Dr.
Bjarne Semb of Stockholm's Karolinska Hospital. Semb led the 12-
member team that on Sunday performed the first permanent artificial
heart implant outside the United States.
The patient, identified by the hospital only as a Swede in his mid-50s,
was "mostly resting," according to Semb. He said the patient was talking
and taking liquids and light food and characterized him as recuperating
"surprisingly well."
Reports about the identity of the patient overshadowed the medical
aspects of the case. And there was also speculation that a recipient of an
artificial heart might be considered legally dead under Swedish law and
thus immune from prosecution.
Judge Birgitta Engvall, who is to hear the case against Stenberg,
refused to comment. But chief prosecutor Magnus Sjoberg said "the op
eration changes nothing in the judicial sense."
Semb would not be drawn into the issue at a news conference yester
day. "We had an agreement (to protect the patienfs anonymity)," he
explained, then asked reporters: "From now on, please show sOme com
mon consideration towards this run-down human being."
Dr. Robert Jarvik, inventor of the metal and plastic Jarvik-7 heart im
planted in the patient, said he was "very pleased" with the operation.
Jarvik, who observed the surgery, told a news conference, "The patient
is in very good spirits and we've learned a lot here."
Jarvik said the Symbion Corp., which manufactures the artificial heart
he invented, donated the $15,500 Jarvik-7 and the special equipment
used at Karolinska in the operation.
Top Mexican drug boss arrested
MEXICO CITY — Mexican police arrested the man they call the na
tion's leading narcotics dealer and were questioning him yesterday.
Ernesto Fonseca, known as "Don Neto," and 23 other people were
arrested Tuesday in the Pacific resort of Puerto Vallarta. TTie Attorney
General's Office said Fonseca is considered the nation's drug overlord
and leader of La Familia — The Family — the group that runs the
Mexican drug trade.
The arrests came as Rafael Caro Ouintero, arrested in Costa Rica last
week as a prime suspect in the kidnap-slaying of an American narcotics
agent, appeared before a federal judge on a variety of drug charges.
He said he was tortured and forced to sign a confession. He did not
admit to kidnapping or murder in his statements, part of a court record
that now reaches 4,000 pages.
Enrique Camarena Salazar of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency
and a Mexican pilot who worked with him were kidnapped separately
Feb. 7 in Guadalajara. Their badly beaten bodies were found March 5 in
plastic bags on-a ranch 60 miles southeast of the city.
The Attorney General's Office said Fonseca, 60, was brought to the
capital Tuesday night. Under Mexican law, police may hold a person for
up to 72 hours before bringing him before a judge.
The government newspaper El Nadonal reported Tuesday that auth
orities found an arsenal of high-powered weapons when they arrested
Fonseca.
Caro Quintero, 29, is reputed to be one of the top four members of La
Familia. He is charged now with "crimes against the health" of the na
tion, criminal conspiracy and weapons smuggling.
The Attorney General's Office has said he also might be charged with
homicide or kidnapping in Guadalajara for the Camarena slaying.
Eight indicted for alien smuggling
TUCSON, Ariz. — Seven South Koreans and a Mexican-American
who have been indicted and arrested comprised "the largest Korean
(alien) smuggling operation we've seen," a federal prosecutor said yes
terday.
A federal grand jury Tuesday indicted the eight on charges of smug
gling South Koreans into the United States in what immigration officials
termed a major international ring.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Gene Bracamonte and a Border Patrol super
visory investigator, Manny Escobedo, said the operation allegedly fun
neled Koreans through border points in Arizona. Harold Ezell, U.S. Im
migration and Naturalization Service western regional commissioner,
said there were also California crossings.
In Los Angeles, Ezell said the group was grossing at least $500,000
and smuggling at least 50 aliens per month.
But Bracamonte said he thought the ring had brought fewer than 100
people into this country through Mexico between last June and March,
the period the alleged conspiracy covers.
Each of the eight was named in one conspiracy count, four counts of
smuggling illegal aliens and four counts of transporting illegal aliens.
Bracamonte said each potentially could face up to 45 years in prison and
fines of $18,000 upon conviction.
Guerrillas attack Salvadoran city
SANTA CRUZ LOMA, El Salvador — Villagers here buried their
dead for the second time in a day late Tuesday as this mountain village
tried to get over the effects of an attack by leftist guerrillas.
At least 300 guerrillas came at dusk Monday, apparently looking for
Civil Defense Force volunteers. When they left the next morning at least
20 people were dead, most of them civilians and some of them women
and children, and the ground was littered with propaganda leaflets.
There had been scattered guerrilla activity in the past, but stunned
residents said the assault was unlike anything that had ever happened in
Santa Cruz Loma. 25 miles southeast of San Salvador.
Guerrillas have hit civil defense posts both to discourage volunteers
and to get arms and other supplies, but the strikes generally have been
selective and rarely involved large numbers of civilians.
The residents of Santa Cruz Loma said they thought the guerrillas
were government troops until they saw rebel initials on some of the uni
forms. The villagers said they shot first.
"They shouted not to shoot, that they were on our side," said Jesus
Valles, the local Civil Defense Force commander.
"They did it to confuse us and we stopped shooting. We thought they
were part of an anti-insurgency unit. When they got closer, we saw that
they were not soldiers."
Residents said the rebels went from house to house, taking supposed
Civil Defense volunteers out and shooting them or cutting their throats.
They said the guerrillas went to houses without hesitation, as if they had
been chosen in advance.
Several people were missing and presumed kidnapped.
Of the 20 confirmed dead, only seven were identified as defense force
volunteers.
Vietnam vets re-examine their past
WASHINGTON — Wiser with a decade's hindsight and buoyed by a
resurgence of patriotism, the men who fight our wars say they want to
know what went wrong and what went right on the battlefields of South
east Asia.
Ten years after the fall of South Vietnam, the legacies of that war are
now being openly debated within the military.
Interviews with more than a dozen officers, military academy instruc
tors and Vietnam veterans still produce frequent references to the social
and political handicaps under which they felt Americans fought in Viet
nam — restrictions on targets and tactics, bungling by civilian leaders
and an intrusive press that undermined public support.
"Our armed forces see themselves as having been taken for 10 years
down a one-way street leading to a dead end by a civilian leadership that
never understood the fundamentals of military strategy." said Prof.
Alvin Bernstein, the chairman of the Strategy Department at the Naval
War College in Newport, R.I.
