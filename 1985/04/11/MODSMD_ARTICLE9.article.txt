# Soviet leader meets delegates
## 
### 
MOSCOW — Mikhail Gorbachev spent nearly
four hours with an American congressional delega
tion yesterday, twice the usual time allotted, and
said it was time U.S.-Soviet relations emerged from
a dangerous "ice age."
The time has come for talking, the Soviet leader
said, and one of the Americans predicted he would
be a "very formidable adversary" in a summit with
President Reagan.
Members of the first U.S. delegation to meet
Gorbachev since the funeral of Konstantin Cher
nenko, whom he replaced March 11, said they
brought the new leader a letter from Reagan. They
would not discuss its contents.
The congressmen said Gorbachev reaffirmed his
interest in a summit, but did not say when it might
be possible.
On Sunday, Gorbachev said the Soviet Union
was freezing deployment of medium-range nuclear
missiles in Europe until November. The White
House said that was public relations.
Tass, the official news agency, quoted Gorba
chev as telling the delegation:
"The time is such now that people shaping the

policy of the two countries should by all means con
verse with one another. The world situation is dis
quieting, even dangerous, and a kind of ice age is
being observed in relations between the U.S.S.R.
and the United States. At least this was so until the
most recent time."
House speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.)
told a news conference the meeting covered arms
control, human rights, trade, regional issues and
cultural exchange.
"From our talks, it is apparent that real opportu
nities for expanded trade and cultural contacts ex
ist."
Gorbachev received O'Neill, Robert Michel (R
-111.), Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), and Silvio Conte
(R-Mass.), who are the senior members of a 13-
man House delegation visiting the Soviet Union.
O'Neill said the meeting lasted three hours and
43 minutes, which is nearly double the time Krem
lin visitors usually get. Its length underscored the
emphasis the new leadership is putting on U.S.-
Soviet relations.
The Soviet press reported Gorbachev's state
ment on arms control the day the delegation
arrived, and Tass said yesterday that Foreign Mini

ster Andrei Gromyko and George Shultz, the
American secretary of state, would meet in Vienna
May 14.
State television broadcast a lengthy report on the
meeting between Gorbachev, 54, and the congress
men, including a videotape of the preliminaries.
Asked about the nuclear-freeze statement,
O'Neill said: "I like to believe (Gorbachev) was
speaking his mind, his heart and his feeling for
world peace. I don't want to look at it as
propaganda."
Michel said Gorbachev mentioned the cool
White House response, and "his characterization
was that we rejected his proposal out of hand."
He said Gorbachev was waiting for a "full
response" to his last letter to Reagan on a summit,
adding that the response was not in the letter
delivered yesterday.
"In taking my measure of the man, I certainly
have to agree with the speaker (O'Neill) that he
could be a very formidable adversary," Michel said.
"But by the same token, knowing my president as
well as I do, the two could .. . have a spirited con
versation and dialogue."
