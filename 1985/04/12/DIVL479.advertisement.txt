CAMPUS-WIDE FAST
To raise funds for two innovative self-help projects — one in Asia, one in
Africa — the Stanford International Development Organization (SIDO)
is organizing a campus-wide fast on TUESDAY, APRIL 16.
AFRICA: Nyafaru is a cooperative in
the remote Tangewana region of
Zimbabwe, the youngest
J independent African country. 1n1975,
V A I the Rhodesian war destroyed the
I I Community's builidings, orchards,
> ® I livestock and school, and many
' a |k | uri D 1 people fled to neighboring
V V—/\rNI MtLr J Mozambique as refugees. By late
\ / 1980, the approximately three
y thousand inhabitants returned to
rebuild their homes, school, and
cooperative. For the next year,
A children, teachers, and parents made
bricks to restore their school, and
today, the Nyafaru School draws
students from many other
A - communities. Now, the Nyafaru
\ community is attempting to
\ re-establish their once-profitable
\ trout fishing enterprise. The $4,000
g I requested will permit the purchase of
TIA/A \J TIM F-NJ TQ initial trout stock ( fin B erlin g s )> feed,
I IVY VJ I I I O and the raw materials to build cement
nnA I r/7*Tr fish tanks. ODN affiliates at Harvard
M VVU 112 KUI tv I and Yale have joined SIDO in
T J sponsoring Nyafaru.
\ / ASIA: Seb ka is a cottage industry
cooperative of 100 women in
Bangladesh, one of the poorest
J countries in the world. The co-op was
A established to enable the poor
women (mostly single mothers) in the
Nandipara village to achieve
B W economic pelf-sufficiency and
Wj# organizational skills. The cooperative
mw engages in a variety of productive
activities: husking rice as well as
i - %/ /m ■ I producing handicrafts, fishing nets,
\ yCjIJ / and garments. Sebika has aisked for
\ B w w / $5,900 to get this project off the
A|U D PT I lIVA TEZ ground. As the cooperative realizes a
V-//1 *T. ■ "V I I Vly/A IL_ profit, proceeds will be used to
enable other poor women to join
Sebika.
