S.F. probes cable car ills
SAN FRANCISCO — Tourists adore it and
commuters rely on it, but city supervisors sought
a probe yesterday into problems plaguing the
city's 112-year-old cable car system despite a
recent renovation.
"I'd like to find out what the heck the extent of
the problem is," said Supervisor Bill Maher yes
terday."The cable car system is certainly a sym
bol of San Francisco. It's got to work right."
Maher is chairman of the supervisors' Traffic
and Transportation Committee and he said he
will ask the full board on Monday to hold public
hearings on a series of problems with the new
system. Supervisor Richard Hongisto, who heads
the public works committee, also wants an inves
tigation.
There have been several difficulties with the
67-block-long cable car system since it went back
into service last June after a two-year renovation.
Although city officials praised the system as on
time and on budget when it resumed service, the
tab has mounted to $63.7 million for a renova
tion that was supposed to cost $58.2 million.
"There will definitely be additional costs," said
Lynn Pio, who managed the system's rehabilita
tion. "What those costs will be, I don't know. But
it's not going to be cheap."
Aide: no fund seeking
SACRAMENTO — In a long-distance at
tempt to curb the federal deficit, Gov. George
Deukmejian's top aide has issued a memo that
discourages agency and department heads from
seeking federal funds to augment the state
budget.
But critics say the move is misguided and may
only result in federal aid going to other states.
Legislative Analyst William Hamm says the
directive may violate "the spirit" of budget lang
uage that says state officials should seek the max
imum amount available when they apply for the
federal grants.
"That has long been interpreted to mean that if
it's out there and available to California, depart
ments and agencies ought to go get it," as long as
the application is consistent with "the programs
and policies that have been adopted by the
Legislature," Hamm added.
The memo, issued March 27 by Chief of Staff

Steve Merksamer, mentions Deukmejian's
"commitment" to reducing the federal deficit
and the administration's interest in "reducing the
size of state government."
In keeping with those goals, the memo adds,
"No request for federal grant funds shall be made
until full consideration has been given to both the
impact of the request on the federal deficit and
the consistency of the request with the staffing,
funding levels and policies of the governor's
budget."
Agencies face major loss
SACRAMENTO — State agencies, plagued
by weaknesses in internal controls, computer
processing and sloppy financial operations, face
an unncessary $24 million loss. Auditor General
Thomas Hayes reported yesterday.
Hayes, in a 285-page report to the Legislature,
said his survey showed that 25 of the 36 major
state agencies each "had at least one weakness in
the internal controls that apply to financial
operations."
Some government offices have failed to keep
track of major equipment, such as office
machines and computers, Hayes said.
The 36 agencies represent about "85 percent
of the $50 billion in .. . account balances in the
state," Hayes said, in the survey covering the
1983-84 fiscal year.
McDonald's returns
SAN YSIDRO— A new McDonald's restau
rant, painted bright yellow with a childrens' play
ground outside, opened yesterday about 400
yards north of the site of last summer's massacre.
The opening of the new outlet fulfilled a prom
ise by McDonald's to replace the restaurant that
was torn down after a gunman burst into the es
tablishment and killed 21 people before he was
slain by police.
"Everyone we've talked to has been totally
supportive," company spokesman Dick Star
mann said, adding that about half of the 75
employees had worked at the old McDonald's,
including several who survived the rampage.
"Last July, we made a commitment to the
people of San Ysidro that we'd reopen and we'd
be back. That was fulfilled this morning when we
opened the doors," Starmann said.

The new restaurant is on the same street as the
old one but is in a different shopping center
about a quarter mile away.
"It's been a busy day — a typical day for a typi
cal McDonald's," Starmann said as scores of
noontime customers queued up at the counter to
place their orders.
Goetz tale repeat likely?
LOS ANGELES — If public transit companies
aren t liable for security aboard buses, riders will
arm themselves as they do on New York sub
ways, an attorney warned the state Supreme
Court yesterday.
Attorney Steven Mazza, representing five
members of a family who were injured during a
brawl on a Los Angeles bus, asked the court to
find that the Southern California Rapid Transit
District had a duty to protect their safety and
may be sued for damages.
"If buses were safer, more people would ride
them," said Mazza. "The RTD says it's going
broke, but this would help them."
Mazza cited the case of New York's subway
vigilante, Bernhard Goetz, saying that a ruling
absolving the RTD of responsibility might be a
license for citizens to take up arms.
"It would be just like in New York City with
the man who shot four people," he said. "We
don't want people going on the buses with guns
and knives."
R TD attorney Marc Poster told the court that
to insure public safety on buses, the company
would have to hire an expensive battalion of se
curity guards to ride shotgun on buses.
Justice Cruz Reynoso asked Poster: "So you're
saying if there s a violent fight, you keep driving,
issue transfers and keep your eyes closed to the
fact the fight is going on?"
Poster replied: "I m saying most bus drivers as
a practical matter wouldn't act that way. They
care about the people on the bus. The question is
if they don't do anything, should we shift the
costs to the RTD? I say no."
Today's weather
loday s high temperatures will be in the upper
80s, with sunny skies and 15-25 mph westerly
winds during the afternoon. Tonight's lows will
be in the mid-40s to mid-50s range, and tomor
row's highs will be around the low 90s.

S.F. probes cable car ills
SAN FRANCISCO — Tourists adore it and
commuters rely on it, but city supervisors sought
a probe yesterday into problems plaguing the
city's 112-year-old cable car system despite a
recent renovation.
"I'd like to find out what the heck the extent of
the problem is," said Supervisor Bill Maher yes
terday."The cable car system is certainly a sym
bol of San Francisco. It's got to work right."
Maher is chairman of the supervisors' Traffic
and Transportation Committee and he said he
will ask the full board on Monday to hold public
hearings on a series of problems with the new
system. Supervisor Richard Hongisto, who heads
the public works committee, also wants an inves
tigation.
There have been several difficulties with the
67-block-long cable car system since it went back
into service last June after a two-year renovation.
Although city officials praised the system as on
time and on budget when it resumed service, the
tab has mounted to $63.7 million for a renova
tion that was supposed to cost $58.2 million.
"There will definitely be additional costs," said
Lynn Pio, who managed the system's rehabilita
tion. "What those costs will be, I don't know. But
it's not going to be cheap."
Aide: no fund seeking
SACRAMENTO — In a long-distance at
tempt to curb the federal deficit, Gov. George
Deukmejian's top aide has issued a memo that
discourages agency and department heads from
seeking federal funds to augment the state
budget.
But critics say the move is misguided and may
only result in federal aid going to other states.
Legislative Analyst William Hamm says the
directive may violate "the spirit" of budget lang
uage that says state officials should seek the max
imum amount available when they apply for the
federal grants.
"That has long been interpreted to mean that if
it's out there and available to California, depart
ments and agencies ought to go get it," as long as
the application is consistent with "the programs
and policies that have been adopted by the
Legislature," Hamm added.
The memo, issued March 27 by Chief of Staff

Steve Merksamer, mentions Deukmejian's
"commitment" to reducing the federal deficit
and the administration's interest in "reducing the
size of state government."
In keeping with those goals, the memo adds,
"No request for federal grant funds shall be made
until full consideration has been given to both the
impact of the request on the federal deficit and
the consistency of the request with the staffing,
funding levels and policies of the governor's
budget."
Agencies face major loss
SACRAMENTO — State agencies, plagued
by weaknesses in internal controls, computer
processing and sloppy financial operations, face
an unncessary $24 million loss. Auditor General
Thomas Hayes reported yesterday.
Hayes, in a 285-page report to the Legislature,
said his survey showed that 25 of the 36 major
state agencies each "had at least one weakness in
the internal controls that apply to financial
operations."
Some government offices have failed to keep
track of major equipment, such as office
machines and computers, Hayes said.
The 36 agencies represent about "85 percent
of the $50 billion in .. . account balances in the
state," Hayes said, in the survey covering the
1983-84 fiscal year.
McDonald's returns
SAN YSIDRO— A new McDonald's restau
rant, painted bright yellow with a childrens' play
ground outside, opened yesterday about 400
yards north of the site of last summer's massacre.
The opening of the new outlet fulfilled a prom
ise by McDonald's to replace the restaurant that
was torn down after a gunman burst into the es
tablishment and killed 21 people before he was
slain by police.
"Everyone we've talked to has been totally
supportive," company spokesman Dick Star
mann said, adding that about half of the 75
employees had worked at the old McDonald's,
including several who survived the rampage.
"Last July, we made a commitment to the
people of San Ysidro that we'd reopen and we'd
be back. That was fulfilled this morning when we
opened the doors," Starmann said.

The new restaurant is on the same street as the
old one but is in a different shopping center
about a quarter mile away.
"It's been a busy day — a typical day for a typi
cal McDonald's," Starmann said as scores of
noontime customers queued up at the counter to
place their orders.
Goetz tale repeat likely?
LOS ANGELES — If public transit companies
aren t liable for security aboard buses, riders will
arm themselves as they do on New York sub
ways, an attorney warned the state Supreme
Court yesterday.
Attorney Steven Mazza, representing five
members of a family who were injured during a
brawl on a Los Angeles bus, asked the court to
find that the Southern California Rapid Transit
District had a duty to protect their safety and
may be sued for damages.
"If buses were safer, more people would ride
them," said Mazza. "The RTD says it's going
broke, but this would help them."
Mazza cited the case of New York's subway
vigilante, Bernhard Goetz, saying that a ruling
absolving the RTD of responsibility might be a
license for citizens to take up arms.
"It would be just like in New York City with
the man who shot four people," he said. "We
don't want people going on the buses with guns
and knives."
R TD attorney Marc Poster told the court that
to insure public safety on buses, the company
would have to hire an expensive battalion of se
curity guards to ride shotgun on buses.
Justice Cruz Reynoso asked Poster: "So you're
saying if there s a violent fight, you keep driving,
issue transfers and keep your eyes closed to the
fact the fight is going on?"
Poster replied: "I m saying most bus drivers as
a practical matter wouldn't act that way. They
care about the people on the bus. The question is
if they don't do anything, should we shift the
costs to the RTD? I say no."
Today's weather
loday s high temperatures will be in the upper
80s, with sunny skies and 15-25 mph westerly
winds during the afternoon. Tonight's lows will
be in the mid-40s to mid-50s range, and tomor
