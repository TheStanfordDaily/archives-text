## Students transform 'junk' into works of art 
### LEE CLINE 
The results of a winter quarter
sculpture class are being displayed
this week in the Annenberg
Auditorium lobby. The works are
responses to two separate assign
ments given by instructor Matt
Haberstroh: to create one sculpture
modeled after the 1950s form of junk
abstraction, and another in the mode
of 1960s pop art — called "the style
of Claes Oldenberg," by student
Henry Bankhead.
What is particularly intriguing
about the set of abstract sculptures is
the "junk" material used: bits of
wood, milk crates, PVC pipe, rubber
gloves, a bicycle wheel and a disem
bodied turntable are each used as
single elements to create a whole. In
short, the sculptures are made from
common "junk" brought together in
uncommon ways to form surprising,
often humorous art.
Susan Robinson said of the materi
als used in her abstract, "black
monolith" sculpture: "We had this
really ugly black chair . . . and 1 just

brought it in one day . . . and I
brought in some crates."
Robinson assembled the crates
around her chair and eventually came
to develop "different worlds in each
of the crates. It was fun finding stuff
for each of these little worlds," she
said.
Bankhead, creator of the
"composite piece with two logs and a
wheel in the middle," said of putting
these more or less random objects to
gether, "Usually I really don't have
an idea in mind ... 1 put the objects
together and move them around until
it strikes me as something with aes
thetic value."
Tim Self, artist of the "assembly
piece with the green branch," also
said that he began with nothing spe
cific in mind. "I built a little, and if 1
liked it, it would stay."
Hae Yuon Kim, who built a figure
like white wooden piece, said, "I
started with scrap pieces of wood. 1
didn't have anything in mind, but it
started to look like a figure. ... I
added a brush to one of the arms. . . .

I just kept adding to it. I didn't try to
actually portray a figure, but I did
things to suggest it. It looks like a car
toonish figure."
Tandreia Rogers also found a focus
as she built her black-and-white
piece. "I cut a lot of pieces of wood
into different shapes. It started
looking like a cityscape. ... I put dots
on the wood to allude to lights."
The other of works, although they
may be more predictable, are cer
tainly no less amusing than the
"junk" sculptures on the other side of
the lobby. "The assignment was to
take an everyday object and blow it
up to several times its size," says Selt.
The statement here lies in the size
disparity and, to a lesser extent, the
contrast of materials between the true
object and the sculpture. Among the
various objects represented are a pair
of vinyl headphones, a tea bag — "tea
for 2,000" — a Q-Tip and a TV din
ner, with many a surprise thrown in.
Self, who is majoring in electrical
engineering, chose to make a Macin
tosh disc, as "I thought it was pretty

much a Stanford thing." Stephanie
Sears built a roll of toilet paper, be
cause "I figured no one else would do
it."
Bankhead, the artist of the some
what lethargic-looking pair of pink
cloth scissors sprawled on the floor,
said, "I did it soft because it seems to
work with the fact that scissors have
to be hard to work. ... I think there's
a statement in that."
I he class was a special seminar that
met one evening a week and was
taught by Haberstroh, currently a
teaching assistant for a daytime
sculpture class. Many of the students
in the seminar were not art majors;
rather, their majors ranged from psy
chology to electrical engineering.
"It's a great class," said Self. "I like
Matt (Haberstroh). Initially he was
vague in what he wanted us to do, but
in the end it gave us a lot more room
to work."
Self particularly enjoyed the infor
mality of the class. "It wasn't like
classical sculpture; it was more a
feeling than a logical process."

In response to an art assignment to make a sulpture in the "style of
Claes Oldenberg," Henry Bankhead took two logs and a wheel to create
the above piece. The figure (far left) was done by Hae Yuon Kim, who
said, "I didn't try to actually portray a figure, but I did things to suggest
it. It looks like a cartoonish figure." Bankhead also did a sculpture of
pink scissors, and said, "I did it soft beacuse it seems to work with the
fact that scissors have to be hard to work."
