# Opinions
## THE 						STANFORD DAILY The 						Daily recommends: Fee assessments 
### 
The Band
Amount requested, section 1: $21,491
Recommendation: YES
Amount requested, section 2: $20,668
Recommendation: NO
Because the Band is an indispensable part of the
Stanford experience, because the Band provides
a truly enjoyable service to all students, as well as
to the entire Stanford community, and because
the Band continues t6 promote campus spirit in a
way that no other organization can, we strongly
encourage a vote for the Band's operating
budget, which is represented by section 1 of its
fee request. However, we cannot recommend a
YES vote on section 2, which would pay for the
Band's road trip to Washington. The trip sounds
like fun for Band members, and we hope they can
find the money to go; the University has ex
pressed willingness to chip in But $20,000 is
simply too much for students to spend for a trip
that will directly benefit very few of them.
SURE
Amount requested: $16,640
Recommendation: YES
SURE, a volunteer organization concerned with
women's safety on campus, provides a much
needed service here. The escort service now
works seven days a week, which is good, but
receives only about nine calls per night, which is
not good. With hope that SURE will work to at
tract more clients, we encourage students to sup
port the service with a YES vote.
Chaparral
Amount requested: $11,040
Recommendation: YES
Attending a school without a humor magazine is
like building a house without a hammer. Stanford
without the Chaparral might not be quite so bad
as all that, but we support it anyway. If it receives
the fee requested, which is certainly not an inor
dinate amount, the Chaparral must still get most
of its revenue from sales and advertising next
year.
ASSU Course Guide
Amount requested: $25,868
Recommendation: NO
Next year's Course Guide promises to be more
complete than previous editions, but we've never
felt the course evaluations were terribly useful,
given that most tend to be overwhelmingly posi
tive. Furthermore, the most useful section of the
Course Guide — the course abstracts — is
available at Meyer Library.
Rape Education Project
Amount requested: $6,700
Recommendation: YES
REP sponsors movies and dorm discussions,
raises awareness and promotes education on
rape. $6,700 is a small price to pay for this
valuable community service.
ASSU Route Extension
Amount requested: $39,788
Recommendation: NO
The ASSU Route Extension (ASSURE) would
extend the hours and routes of the current Mar
guerite shuttle service to increase security and
convenience for students traveling around
campus. However, the routes and hours of the
SURE escort service overlap and supersede
ASSURE's, and $39,788 is a lot to spend for
convenience.
Axe Committee, section 1
Amount requested, section 1: $4,000
Recommendation: YES
Amount requested, section 2: $5,0067
Recommendation: YES
Section 1 of the Axe Committee's request would
fund the pre-Big Game fireworks rally, the rally
in San Francisco and miscellaneous rooting ex
penses like the Stanford banner, all parts of Stan
ford tradition well worth keeping. Section 2 of
the budget is more questionable. It provides
funds for the maintenance and repair of the Axe
case — something clearly desirable — and a very
expensive Friday-before-Big-Game
Meganooner. In its infinite wisdom, the ASSU
combined the two expenditures, forcing us to
support the Meganooner if we want the Axe case.

The ASSU has left us no choice. We must recom
mend a YES vote on section 2 as well.
Club Sports
Amount requested: $42,000
Recommendation: YES
Club Sports involves 1,700 students, and anyone
who wants to take part can. Furthermore, non
participating students do not bear an inordinate
amount of the cost for Club Sports. Fee assess
ments fund only one-third of Club Sports'
budget: The remainder is provided by the Ath
letic Department and the fund-raising activities
of the various clubs.
KZSU
Amount requested: $57,116
Recommendation: YES
KZSU needs its fee assessment to continue oper
ation and to begin updating some of its less-than
modern equipment. KZSU's one shortcoming is
its number of student listeners, but station
promoters promise that they're working to rem
edy that. We need a campus radio station, and we
should vote to fund KZSU.
Graduate Student Association
Amount requested: $13,333
Recommendation: YES
The Graduate Student Association is one of the
few groups on campus that provide programming
exclusively for graduate students, and its efforts
have been largely successful. It deserves a YES
vote for its reasonably small fee request.
Speakers Bureau
Amount requested: $58,720
Recommendation: YES
The ASSU Speakers Bureau works hard to bring
a variety of speakers to Stanford, and that contri
butes to the educational experience here. Its
budget is straightforward, and though the
$58,720 it requests is no small sum, it is justified
by the high prices top-name speakers demand.
Black Student Union
Amount requested: $23,416
Recommendation: YES
The Black Student Union continues to be a
visible and valuable force on campus. It is effec
tive in fostering a strong black community at
Stanford and developing programming which
benefits the entire Stanford community.
The Women's Center
Amount requested: $5,890
Recommendation: YES
The Women's Center serves as a support and
resource center for women. Its speakers this year
have raised a variety of issues at Stanford, and it
deserves student support.
Tuesday Films
Amount requested: $14,215
Recommendation: YES
Tuesday Films presents movies known as
"university films," for which admission cannot be
charged. The series provides a valuable educa
tional service in presenting these politically and
culturally diverse films on campus, and it is
worthy of support.
The Daily
Amount requested, section 1: $20,000
Recommendation: NEUTRAL
Amount requested, section 2: $20,000
Recommendation: NEUTRAL
We can't, of course, speak entirely objectively
about The Daily's fee assessment request, so our
formal recommendation is neutral. There are
strong reasons, however, for The Daily to get
both sections of its $40,000 request. The Daily
communicates the news and events of the Stan
ford area to students for about 2 cents an issue. In
the past two years, The Daily has done well
financially, because of both one-time-only events
like the Super Bowl here which have attracted
additional advertising revenues, and the im
proved economy overall. Accordingly, The Daily
asks for only $40,000 this year, down from
$50,000 last year.
