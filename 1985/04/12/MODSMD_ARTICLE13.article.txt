In his book "Breaking With Moscow," Soviet
defector Arkady Shevchenko says the daughter
of Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko once
told him her father, a key Kremlin policy maker
for 40 years, sees Moscow only through the win
dows of his limosine and has not set foot on the
city's streets for decades.
It would appear the architects of the ASSU
constitution, which is once again "in the process
of being upgraded" via the usual sweep of
amendments, rub elbows with Stanford students
as often as Gromkyo goes window shopping
along Lenin Prospekt. As a leading ASSU official
put it recently, "It's a good thing The Daily
(Editorial Board) takes the time to figure out the
amendments. Otherwise, no one would know
what the hell they mean."
It's true some of the ideas trapped within the
ASSU-speak of the amendments make good
sense. In particular, the concern that generated
Amendment No. 14, which would eliminate the
special fee refund system, stems from a genuine

student need.
But students deserve better than renewed ef
forts to tinker with a constitution that institution
alizes bickering and bylaws. As somebody who
never even heard of the ASSU once said,
"Diamonds are diamonds and crap is crap. They
never change."
It is, of course, difficult to glean diamonds from
crap, as this can never happen. But the purveyors
of ASSU constitutional amendments have yet to
admit this. By voting down all the constitutional
amendments, we can send them a strong message
that bureaucratic "fine-tuning" by bureaucrats is
not acceptable, that the ASSU Senate should —
and does — have more important things to do
with its time.
The following hereby is, then, enacted as Arti
cle I, Section 1, of this year's endorsements of
The Editorial Board of The Stanford Daily
Publishing Corporation, with the subsequent Sec
tions being renumbered accordingly:
Vote no on all constitutional amendments.
