# Idaho: land of slumber

I lay comfortably upon the warm sand, a cold beer in
my hand. Two blondes lay next to me, one more beautiful
than the other. Their tan bodies gleamed in the sunlight.
Their breath was hot and their bodies were likewise.
To those of you who were lucky enough to spend your
vacation in Hawaii, Palm Springs or one of various other
exotic places, a scene like this could very likely have oc
curred. To those of you not quite so lucky,.this image may

arise only as a dream.
But to we treasured few who
were extremely fortunate
enough to pine away our vaca
tion amidst the thrills and
chills of Boise, Idaho, this en
ticing scenario appears more
like a pipe dream — an unap
proachable mirage.
Yes, I was there. And now
I'm back. And I'm all the
more better for it, also.
I am now caught up on all
the movies I had been

meaning to see, and am done with more than half my
reading list for American Fiction. But best of all, I believe
I have finally caught up on all my sleep. Usually an ex
tremely restless sleeper, the sights and sounds of beloved
Boise (or shall I say lack of) were like a lullaby to my ears.
Although sleep may be only a trivial detail to many of
you, to me it has been an unattainable desire. I often lie
awake nights wondering how to get to sleep. I roll over so
often in bed I get dizzy. And the more I think, the less I
sleep.
As a child, I studied my dilemma (while trying to get to
sleep one night), and decided that a successful method
would be to picture total blackness. In this way, there
would be nothing I could think about. Not so, oh sleepless

one. In no time, a star would appear or an airplane or E.T.
or anything. The end result — no sleep.
Later in my life, my brother suggested I put my whole
body to sleep part by part, beginning at my feet. No dice
again. By the time I reached my arms the first time, my
feet had already caught on to the scheme. Soon they in
sisted that I turn over or they would go on strike. I tried to
bargain with them and offer them a new pair of slippers.

Still they refused. By this time,
my knees also woke up and
began to chime in. I soon gave
in. Again — more sleepless
nights.
As a last resort (and al
though it sounds ridiculous), I
stooped so low as to count
sheep. What number comes
after
999,999,999,999,999,999
anyway? And what could I do
regarding the population

crisis? The sheep demanded
more food, better housing, higher pay, etc. What's a poor
boy to do? One more time — nQ more sleep. I was almost
ready to give in.
But alas, a dear friend, a native Idahoan herself, invited
me to her house over spring break. Now I am that much
better for it.
However, although Idaho was the solution to my prob
lem, many of you may have other queries.
To be or not to be?
To sleep or not to sleep?
To Idaho or not to Idaho?
Don't look at me for the answers. It all depends on what
you're looking for.
