Polish Jews
As the son of Polish Jews and as
one who still has family in Poland, I
read Kathleen Maloney's piece on
Poland (The Daily, April 2) with
more than casual interest. Her des
cription of Poland's economic situa
tion was credible in my opinion but,
like many Westerners, Maloney
overly romanticized the Poles.
Speaking of Poland's great losses
in World War 11, the writer said that
millions of "Poles" died in the Nazi
concentration camps. To say this,
though, is to misattribute the loss,
for the millions who died in the
camps were mostly Jewish. Poland
has a long history of anti-Semitism
and it is important to note that its
natives distinguish Polish-born Jews
from Roman Catholic Poles; one
cannot be both a Jew and a Pole.
Maloney's misleading statement is
also quite ironic in view of the Poles'
widespread complicity in Hitler's
Final Solution: Large numbers of
Poles, encouraged by the country's
anti-Semitic church, assisted the
Nazis in ridding Poland of its large
Jewish population. Poland did
indeed lose much in World War II;
however, I very much doubt that it
mourned the loss of its once-great
Jewish community.
