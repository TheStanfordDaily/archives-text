# Divestment fight spreads

### DAVID RISSER Senior staff writer 
BERKELEY â€” Chanting "Hey hey, ho ho, apar
theid has got to go," more than 100 students have
camped out on the steps offhe Sproul Hall administra
tion building here for the last two days to urge the UC
Board of Regents to divest from all banks and corpora
tions with business interests in South Africa.
At the same time, hundreds of students at Columbia
University in New York City are entering the ninth day
of a round-the-clock blockade of Hamilton Hall and
have reportedly received a statement of support from
South African Nobel Peace Prize laureate Bishop Des
mond Tutu.
The camp-in at Berkeley began on Wednesday after
a planned anti-apartheid rally of about 400 people. As
the rally ended, some protesters gathered at Sproul
Hall and were joined by "a lot of peple acting spon
taneously." according to Berkeley sophomore Rodney
Ward.
A list of demands submitted to Berkeley President
David Gardner by the UC Divestment Coalition, one
of many groups supporting the protest, calls for "a
pledge of complete and immediate divestment" and a
public hearing to allow faculty and student input into a
university treasurer's report to be presented to the
regents.
The protesters want the regents to make a decision
on divestment at their May meeting in Berkeley rather
than at a Santa Cruz meeting scheduled for June, when
school is not in session.
"We are trying to put pressure on the regents," said
sophomore Traci Taylor. "We know what they're
doing with our money and we don't like it. I want total
divestment."
Coalition leaders estimate that 30 percent, or $1.7
billion, of UC's investments are in companies that do

business in South Africa. The regents, however,
compute their South African exposure at about $17
million by counting only the percentage of each invest
ment that corresponds to the percentage of a com
pany s totalbusiness that is related to South Africa.
"I don't care what the amount is, I don't want to see
a penny of my money going to the government in
South Africa," Ward said.
The Berkeley student senate has passed a resolution
in support of the sit-in that also questions the previous
responsiveness of the regents to student demands.
"We are going to be here until we o et an answer
from the administration," said Gary Sjostrom, a mem
ber offthe Berkeley Campaign Against Apartheid.
"We are going to stay and join with Columbia. The
students there cheered when they heard (of the
Berkeley demonstration)."
Indeed, the Berkeley camp-in is "partly a response
to what's happening at Columbia," according to
Berkeley Campaign Against Apartheid member
Joanna Burroughs.
The camp-in at Columbia began last Thursday with a
rally sponsored by the Columbia Coalition for a Free
South Africa. Students gathered outside the main en
trance to Hamilton Hall, a major university classroom
and office building, and chained the doors shut.
At least 100 students have camped out every night
since then, and yesterday's daytime crowd swelled to
more than 800 participants.
Both Sproul Hall at Berkeley and Hamilton Hall at
Columbia were the sites of many anti-Vietnam War
protests in the 1960s and early '70s. Protesters at
Berkeley have renamed Sproul "Stephen Biko Hall"
after an anti-apartheid black South African student
killed in prison; those at Columbia have renamed
