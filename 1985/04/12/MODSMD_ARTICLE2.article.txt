# Divestment fight spreads
## 
### DAVID RISSER Senior staff writer 
BERKELEY â€” Chanting "Hey hey, ho ho, apar
theid has got to go," more than 100 students have
camped out on the steps offhe Sproul Hall administra
tion building here for the last two days to urge the UC
Board of Regents to divest from all banks and corpora
tions with business interests in South Africa.
At the same time, hundreds of students at Columbia
University in New York City are entering the ninth day
of a round-the-clock blockade of Hamilton Hall and
have reportedly received a statement of support from
South African Nobel Peace Prize laureate Bishop Des
mond Tutu.
The camp-in at Berkeley began on Wednesday after
a planned anti-apartheid rally of about 400 people. As
the rally ended, some protesters gathered at Sproul
Hall and were joined by "a lot of peple acting spon
taneously." according to Berkeley sophomore Rodney
Ward.
A list of demands submitted to Berkeley President
David Gardner by the UC Divestment Coalition, one
of many groups supporting the protest, calls for "a
pledge of complete and immediate divestment" and a
public hearing to allow faculty and student input into a
university treasurer's report to be presented to the
regents.
The protesters want the regents to make a decision
on divestment at their May meeting in Berkeley rather
than at a Santa Cruz meeting scheduled for June, when
school is not in session.
"We are trying to put pressure on the regents," said
sophomore Traci Taylor. "We know what they're
doing with our money and we don't like it. I want total
divestment."
Coalition leaders estimate that 30 percent, or $1.7
billion, of UC's investments are in companies that do

business in South Africa. The regents, however,
compute their South African exposure at about $17
million by counting only the percentage of each invest
ment that corresponds to the percentage of a com
pany s totalbusiness that is related to South Africa.
"I don't care what the amount is, I don't want to see
a penny of my money going to the government in
South Africa," Ward said.
The Berkeley student senate has passed a resolution
in support of the sit-in that also questions the previous
responsiveness of the regents to student demands.
"We are going to be here until we o et an answer
from the administration," said Gary Sjostrom, a mem
ber offthe Berkeley Campaign Against Apartheid.
"We are going to stay and join with Columbia. The
students there cheered when they heard (of the
Berkeley demonstration)."
Indeed, the Berkeley camp-in is "partly a response
to what's happening at Columbia," according to
Berkeley Campaign Against Apartheid member
Joanna Burroughs.
The camp-in at Columbia began last Thursday with a
rally sponsored by the Columbia Coalition for a Free
South Africa. Students gathered outside the main en
trance to Hamilton Hall, a major university classroom
and office building, and chained the doors shut.
At least 100 students have camped out every night
since then, and yesterday's daytime crowd swelled to
more than 800 participants.
Both Sproul Hall at Berkeley and Hamilton Hall at
Columbia were the sites of many anti-Vietnam War
protests in the 1960s and early '70s. Protesters at
Berkeley have renamed Sproul "Stephen Biko Hall"
after an anti-apartheid black South African student
killed in prison; those at Columbia have renamed

DC-Berkeley students protesting the university's investments in South Africa have camped out on the
steps of Sproul Hall, an administration building.
Hamilton "Nelson Mandela Hall"
after a political prisoner in South
Africa.
Columbia's portfolio includes $33
million in investments in companies
with business in South Africa, and
Columbia protesters are also calling
for total divestment.
The camp-in follows a hunger
strike by a group of Columbia stu
dents that ended when the group was
allowed to meet with Columbia Uni
versity President Michael Sovern.
Each passing day brings different
people to the demonstration. Folk
singer Pete Seeger has led the
protesters in song, and Bono, the lead
singer for the group U2, reportedly
dropped by.
Yesterday, community leaders
from Harlem marched to the scene to
join the protest. "It represented a
coming together of community and
students," said coalition steering
committee member David Goldiner,
a Columbia junior. "They joined the
rally and people were all cheering. It
was very emotional, very powerful,"
he said.
According to members of the coali
tion, Bishop Tutu, interviewed on
WCBS radio yesterday, said, "I salute
them for their commitment and wish
to thank them on behalf of the victims
of apartheid."
Although the student blockade has
not completely sealed off Hamilton
Hall, the university has gone to court
seeking an injunction against the
protesters and has brought discipli
nary proceedings against some stu
dents.
The injuction sought by Columbia

has been postponed by a New York
court until Tuesday.
"Columbia has used all kinds of
low, slimy practices," said Goldiner.
"They are not treating us as a group
and are threatening some individ
uals."
Faculty at Columbia are an integral
part of the ongoing protest, as 200
have formed the Columbia Faculty
Against Apartheid in support of the
student demonstrators.
The group unanimously passed two
resolutions this week. One calls for
total divestment; the other demands
that the university avoid using legal
and disciplinary proceedings as a sub
stitute for "real action," according to
Sociology Prof. Eric Hirsch.
Sympathetic professors held a
teach-in last night that attracted
hundreds of students and have
refused to hold classes in Hamilton.
Other professors who do not
teach classes in Hamilton canceled
classes last Friday in support of the
protest, Teichner said.
"Business is not going on as usual,"
Hirsch said. "We are trying to make
people a bit uncomfortable and force
them to make a choice. The faculty
group has tried to persuade other fac
ulty not to hold classes in Hamilton."
"I expect (the protest) to grow un
til the trustees vote for divestment,"
he added. "All other avenues have
been ineffective in getting a
response."
At UC-Santa Barbara, 1,200 staff,
faculty and students have signed a pe
tition urging divestment, and on
Wednesday a few hundred people
marched against apartheid on that
campus.
Leaders of the Columbia effort
predicted last night that some form of
take-over or sit-in will soon occur at
both Rutgers and Harvard.
