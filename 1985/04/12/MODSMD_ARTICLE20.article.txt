## Film explores life and times of gay activist Harvey Milk 
### MARY YUH Editorial staff 
"Almost everything I've done was
for the gay movement," says assas
sinated San Francisco Supervisor
Harvey Milk in the Academy Award
winning movie directed by Robert
Epstein.
"The Times of Harvey Milk,"
shown last night in a crowded Sterling
Quad Dining and Performance Cen
ter, documents "a traumatic period of
history," said Deborah Hoffmann,
who edited the film with Epstein.
"We decided early on that the film
would not be a biography . . . but
about the political times that Harvey
was involved in and the effect it had."
Milk, born May 22, 1940 and
raised in New York, had known that
he was gay since the age of 14. He
moved to San Francisco and threw
himself into community organizing,
but the self-proclaimed "Mayor of
Castro Street" ran for city office
three times and lost three times. Fi
nally, under the newly created district
system, he was elected to the Board
of Supervisors by District Five, the
Castro Street district. He served for
barely 11 months before he was mur
dered, along with then-San Francisco
Mayor George Moscone, by Dan
White on Nov. 11, 1978.
The first openly gay person to hold
elective office, Milk was a champion
for human rights. He called
repeatedly for all minorities to band
together and emphasized the need for
"the rank and file," not just commu
nity leaders, to work together to gov
ern their communities.
"He was coming from the people
. . . he wasn't only for gay rights,"
says Jim Elliot, a machinist and union
man interviewed in the film.
Nevertheless, Milk was undoubt
edly special to the gay community.
"The feeling was just one of total
joy," says former aide Tory
Hartmann of that victorious election
night. The gay people "now had
someone to represent them."
Arguably the most important poli

tical and social battle of his career —
the fight against Proposition 6 —
propelled Milk into prominence
beyond the borders of San Francisco.
The proposition would have
prohibited all gay people from hold
ing jobs as public school teachers in
California.
Sally Gearhart, who lobbied with
Milk against the proposition, charac
terizes the battle as a clash between
two sets of fears. On one side were
the gay people, afraid of losing the
few rights they had gained and facing
the prospect of being legally
penalized for their private lives, and
on the other were fundamentalists
afraid of having their children in
fluenced by people they considered
perverted or even evil.
Milk and Gearhart waged an inten
sive grass roots campaign, and
Proposition 6 lost. The jobs of gay
schoolteachers in California could
now be considered safe.
On the night of their victory, Milk
makes an impassioned plea: "Most
importantly, every gay person must
come out." He believed that if people
were only aware of how many gay
people they knew, that gay people
were everywhere and were normal
people just like everyone else, then
their myths and fears would be gone.
Milk fully realized that his
prominence as a gay city official made
him a likely candidate for assassina
tion. "It could happen at any time,
any day, any place. I'm just not going
to worry about it,"he says in the
movie.
When Milk was murdered,
straights and gays alike mourned. The
city joined en masse in a candlelight
march in an emotional and dignified
demonstration of sorrow. There was a
"feeling of such loss. . . . Harvey
stood for something more than just
himself," says one of his aides in the
film. The film seemed to indicate that
Milk stood for the rights of all people
to be themselves and to govern them
selves.
When White was found guilty of

manslaughter instead of murder, the
city exploded into riots. The verdict
was seen by the people as an indica
tion by society that if a person is
white, middle class and upholds tradi
tional values, he can get away with
anything, even murder, says school
teacher Tom Ammiano in the film.
Interestingly enough, while the film
documented the people's riots, it did
not document the police riots at The
Elephant Wall, a Castro Street bar.
Frustrated by orders not to retaliate
with violence against the rioters in
front of City Hall, some policemen
drove to this bar and beat up many
gay men. None of the policemen were
ever prosecuted.
When asked why this event was not
documented in the film, Hoffmann
replied that there were so many
stories to tell, all emotionally ex
hausting, that it simply was not possi
ble to tell them all.
"The main point of the film was
Harvey Milk's call to come out," said
Roland van Gaalen, member of the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford
(GLAS).
"The film is bringing back to life
his wonderful personality. . . . It's
bringing our heritage to younger gay
people and people who didn't live in
the Bay Area and maybe weren't
aware of what was happening," said
Gerard Koskovich, gay rights activist
and a GLAS member.
"We wanted the audience not to be
just San Francisco or gay," said Hoff
mann. Ideally, by seeing the movie,
people should "go through the
change the union man (Jim Elliott)
went through in real life" from being
homophobic to realizing that gay
people are simply people.
GLAS member David Cuff echoed
that desire, saying, "At the very least,
people should empathize with the
union man and realize that once you
get to know gay people, they're no
different from anyone else."
As Milk once said, "You cannot
live with hope alone, but without it
life is not worth living."
