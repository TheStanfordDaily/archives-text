## Wildcats look to bite into Card's lead 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
On March 6, when Stanford was
ranked sixth in the nation, Coach
Mark Marquess of the Stanford
baseball team was asked whether a
high ranking would have an adverse
effect on his club. "Our team doesn't
feel any pressure because of it."he
said. "If we were No. 1, it might be a
problem."
Now, five weeks later, the Cardinal
is No. 1 Any pressure now, coach?
"I don't really think so because it
fluctuates so much," Marquess said.
"It's not like we've been there for six
or seven weeks. But it's nice to be
recognized."
Asst. Coach Dean Stotz also
downplayed the influence of the na
tion's top spot. "It hasn't affected
them (the players) one way or the
other, to be honest," he said. "But
they're proud of their accomplish
ments and rightfully so."
This weekend, Stanford will get its
first stern test since becoming No. 1
when it hosts No. 26 Arizona in a
three-game series beginning today at
2:30 p.m.
The series will mark the beginning
of the second half of the Pacific 10
Southern Division schedule. Stanford
(12-3) currently holds a two-game
lead in the Six-Pacover 10-5 Califor
nia. Arizona and Arizona State share
third with 7-8 records, five games off
the pace.
If fatigue is a factor in the Six-Pac
race, the Cardinal should be in good
shape. Stanford has played only 34
games (26-8) — the fewest in the
conference. Today's game is
A izona's 50th.
Though five games ahead with 15
to play seems like a lot, Marquess is
wary of the Wildcats. "They had one
bad weekend against UCLA (a three

game sweep) that really put them he
hind the eight ball." he said. "But we
expect them to challenge in the
second half."
Stanford took two of three games
trom Arizona in Tucson earlier in the
year. In the series, 62 runs were
scored — 38 by the Cardinal. Both
Marquess and Stotz blamed the
playing conditions rather than the
pitchers for the large scoring totals.
"Their field is conducive to scoring
runs," Stotz said. "The air is light,
they've got a big park, and the infield
there is very fast."
Marquess had a simpler explana
tion: "Arizona. If you're a hitter, you
love to play in Arizona."
Marquess and Stotz also agreed on
the Wildcats' strengths — starting

pitching and team speed. Arizona
boasts 1984 Six-Pac strikeout king
Joe Magrane (8-6, 4.18 ERA), Mike
Young (8-4, 4.1 1) and Dave Carley
(5-2, 4.33).
"Their two left-handers (Magrane
and Young) could be first-round draft
picks, and the righthander (Carley)
matches up well with our right-hand
hitting lineup," Stotz said.
The Wildcats have also stolen 112
bases — 30 of them by shortstop
Tommy Hinzo, whom Stotz calls pos
sibly "one of the fastest players in the
country."
At the plate Arizona is led by first
baseman Todd Trafton. Trafton is
hitting .373 with seven home runs
and 56 RBIs. Other contributors are
Randy Hayes (.383, 38 RBIs). Hinzo

(.358) and third baseman Gar Millay
(.346, 9 HRs, 52 RBIs).
Marquess realizes that the Wildcats
could end Stanford's reign atop the
polls very quickly. "One bad
weekend and you can go from No. 1
to No. 50," he said.
Arizona's starting rotation for the
weekend is not settled as of yet, but
Magrane will probably get the call
today, with Young pitching tomor
row's 1 p.m. game and Carley hurling
on Sunday.
Stanford's rotation is set. Jeff Bal
lard (8-1, 3.40) will pitch today, and
Rob Wassenaar (5-1,4.11) will go to
morrow. In the 1 p.m. series finale,
Jack McDowell (6-3, 4.41) will be the
Cardinal starter.

(5-2, 4.33).
"Their two left-handers (Magrane
and Young) could be first-round draft
picks, and the righthander (Carley)
matches up well with our right-hand
hitting lineup," Stotz said.
The Wildcats have also stolen 112
bases — 30 of them by shortstop
Tommy Hinzo, whom Stotz calls pos
sibly "one of the fastest players in the
country."
At the plate Arizona is led by first
baseman Todd Trafton. Trafton is
hitting .373 with seven home runs
and 56 RBIs. Other contributors are
Randy Hayes (.383, 38 RBIs). Hinzo

(.358) and third baseman Gar Millay
(.346, 9 HRs, 52 RBIs).
Marquess realizes that the Wildcats
could end Stanford's reign atop the
polls very quickly. "One bad
weekend and you can go from No. 1
to No. 50," he said.
Arizona's starting rotation for the
weekend is not settled as of yet, but
Magrane will probably get the call
today, with Young pitching tomor
row's 1 p.m. game and Carley hurling
on Sunday.
Stanford's rotation is set. Jeff Bal
lard (8-1, 3.40) will pitch today, and
Rob Wassenaar (5-1,4.11) will go to
morrow. In the 1 p.m. series finale,
Jack McDowell (6-3, 4.41) will be the
Cardinal starter.

Shortstop John Verducci will look to raise his average over the .300
mark this weekend as Stanford hosts Arizona in a three-game Six-Pac
series.


Shirish Date/Daily
Toi Cook will try to help the Cardinal slide past the Wildcats and stay in first place in the Six-Pac and retain
the No. 1 national ranking.
