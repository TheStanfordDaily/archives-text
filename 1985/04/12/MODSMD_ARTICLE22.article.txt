# Netters hurting in Texas
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
AUSTIN, Texas — It poured
here yesterday morning, and
rain is predicted again today for
the first round of the prestigious
Longhorn-Kaepa Women's
Tennis Classic.
15ut Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan wouldn't mind if it
rained all weekend, and the
three-day, eight-team tourna
ment were washed away in the
Colorado River that runs
through this city.
Asked yesterday if he was
hoping for rain, Brennan firmly
replied, "Yes. That's an affirm
ative."
You see, Brennan and his No.
2-ranked Cardinal find them
selves in the company of the na
tion's top women's tennis teams
— all of the top five and eight of
the top 10 ranked teams are
here — not at full strength.
And saying that Stanford,
which takes on fifth-ranked
Miami (Fla.) today at 2 p.m., is
even at half strength might he a
hit generous. Two of the Card
inal's top eight netters didn't
make the trip, and a third who
did might not play this weekend.
For starters, freshman Anna
Ivan, IK-1 in singles this season
and ranked fourth nationally,
isn't here. Ivan woke up Wed
nesday morning with a bad
virus, and although she may fly
in tonight, Brennan is not hold
ing his breath.
"It hurts us a lot because

Anna is not only a great singles
player, she's turned out to be a
great doubles player, too,"
Brennan said. "Other than that,
we don't miss her at all."
As if the lords of the nets
decided striking Ivan from the
Cardinal's lineup wasn't
enough, they took a second and
most probably a third Stanford
player.
Senior team captain Linda
Gates is still bothered by ten
donitis in her knee, and Bren
nan listed her as doubtful for
singles and questionable for
doubles this weekend. Fresh
man Cari Hagey, however,
definitely won't play. Hagey
didn't make the trip, as her right
shoulder is still so sore that she
won't be able to serve for a few
more weeks.
So extensive and so sudden
was the slew of injuries and ill
nesses that Brennan was forced
to call on junior walk-on Susan
Ross — 45 minutes before the
team left Wednesday afternoon.
With only seven players here,
and only six of them healthy
enough to play singles, Stanford
is probably the underdog in
today's first-round match with
Miami. Hurricane Coach lan
Davenhage, obviously unin
formed about Stanford's criti
cal losses, still considers his
team the underdog.
"I think it's a good situation
for us because, according to the


Jeff Stevens/Daily
The Cardinal will struggle this weekend in Austin without freshman Anna
Ivan, who stayed home with a viral infection.
