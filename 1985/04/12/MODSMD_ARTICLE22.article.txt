# Netters hurting in Texas
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
AUSTIN, Texas — It poured
here yesterday morning, and
rain is predicted again today for
the first round of the prestigious
Longhorn-Kaepa Women's
Tennis Classic.
15ut Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan wouldn't mind if it
rained all weekend, and the
three-day, eight-team tourna
ment were washed away in the
Colorado River that runs
through this city.
Asked yesterday if he was
hoping for rain, Brennan firmly
replied, "Yes. That's an affirm
ative."
You see, Brennan and his No.
2-ranked Cardinal find them
selves in the company of the na
tion's top women's tennis teams
— all of the top five and eight of
the top 10 ranked teams are
here — not at full strength.
And saying that Stanford,
which takes on fifth-ranked
Miami (Fla.) today at 2 p.m., is
even at half strength might he a
hit generous. Two of the Card
inal's top eight netters didn't
make the trip, and a third who
did might not play this weekend.
For starters, freshman Anna
Ivan, IK-1 in singles this season
and ranked fourth nationally,
isn't here. Ivan woke up Wed
nesday morning with a bad
virus, and although she may fly
in tonight, Brennan is not hold
ing his breath.
"It hurts us a lot because

Anna is not only a great singles
player, she's turned out to be a
great doubles player, too,"
Brennan said. "Other than that,
we don't miss her at all."
As if the lords of the nets
decided striking Ivan from the
Cardinal's lineup wasn't
enough, they took a second and
most probably a third Stanford
player.
Senior team captain Linda
Gates is still bothered by ten
donitis in her knee, and Bren
nan listed her as doubtful for
singles and questionable for
doubles this weekend. Fresh
man Cari Hagey, however,
definitely won't play. Hagey
didn't make the trip, as her right
shoulder is still so sore that she
won't be able to serve for a few
more weeks.
So extensive and so sudden
was the slew of injuries and ill
nesses that Brennan was forced
to call on junior walk-on Susan
Ross — 45 minutes before the
team left Wednesday afternoon.
With only seven players here,
and only six of them healthy
enough to play singles, Stanford
is probably the underdog in
today's first-round match with
Miami. Hurricane Coach lan
Davenhage, obviously unin
formed about Stanford's criti
cal losses, still considers his
team the underdog.
"I think it's a good situation
for us because, according to the

Ivan, who stayed home with a viral infection.
rankings, we're not supposed to win,"
he said yesterday. "So there's no
pressure on us, and we can come out
loose."
If the Miami Dolphins feature the
Killer Bs, than the Miami Hurricanes
women's tennis team has the Killer
Rs. The last names of four of the six
starters begin with R.
Miami, 26-4, has three singles
players ranked in the top 22, and two
doubles teams in the top 11. The
doubles pair of Ros Riach and Kathy
Richmond, who lost to Gates and
Elise Burgin in the NCAA doubles
final last year, is ranked first nation
ally, even though they play No. 2 for
the Hurricanes.
Brennan will counter with a
patchwork singles lineup of Patty
Fendick, Leigh Anne Eldredge, Steph
anie Savides, Kay Tittle, Alyce Wer
del and Ross, probably in that order.
If the match should come down to
doubles, Stanford might be in a bit of
trouble, as the pride of the Hur
ricanes is their doubles teams. In fact,
Miami has won five matches in the
past two years after trailing 4-2 in
singles.
"We work very hard on doubles,"
Davenhage said. "Most tough
matches come down to doubles."
Brennan wil go with Eldredge and
Fendick at No. 1, and then Savides
and Tittle at either No. 2 or 3. The

other Cardinal pair will be Gates and
Werdel, with Ross replacing Gates if
she is unable to play.
If Stanford finds a way to beat
Miami, it will face the winner of 10th
ranked UCLA and third-ranked
Texas, who is hosting the tourna
ment. The Cardinal is guaranteed
three matches, weather permitting. In
the event of rain, the tournament's
format will be junked, and each team
will play two matches, preferably
against teams it hasn't met this
season.
This trip marks the first and only
for Stanford out of the West Coast
region during the regular season. Last
year, when Stanford won the NCAA
title, the Cardinal neglected to
venture east, and was penalized in the
pretournament seedings, ranked
second behind Trinity (Texas).
Now that Brennan has finally
decided to take his show east of the
Sierra, his Cardinal stands to lose
more than one place in the rankings.
With eight of the top 10 teams on
hand, one or two losses here could
drop Stanford considerably.
"They don't make any concessions
if you lose a match," Brennan said of
the polls. "They don't say, 'You lost
that match without this player or that
player.' "
Card note
Stanford and Miami have two com
mon opponents in San Diego State
and No. 1-ranked USC. Miami lost to
both 5-4. Stanford also lost to USC 5-
4, but defeated San Diego State 7-2.


Adam Grossman/Daily
Alyce Werdel will have to pick up the slack for Coach Frank Brennan at
No. 5 singles if the injury-plagued Cardinal hopes to stay ranked No. 2
in the nation.
