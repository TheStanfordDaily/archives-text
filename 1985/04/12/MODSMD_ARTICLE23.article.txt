# Men to host Arizona teams
## Goldie seeking to avenge upset 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's tennis team
resumes Pacific 10 Southern Division
competition today and tomorrow
with matches against two "young and
improving" teams — Arizona State
and Arizona
Although the Arizona teams have
found themselves near the bottom of
the Six-Pac this year, Stanford Coach
Dick Gould plans to play a full start
ing lineup in both matches.
Stanford defeated both teams over
spring break, shutting out Arizona
State and beating Arizona 7-2. One
of Stanford's two losses to Arizona
came at No. 1 singles, with Dan
Goldie — the nation's top-ranked
player — losing to Benji Papal in
straight sets.
The loss to Papal was Goldie's first
of the season, but neither he nor
Gould expect another surprise match
from the unranked freshman.
"The key will be his return of
serve. Papal does have a good serve
which Danny will need to adjust to.
But I have a lot of confidence in
him," Gould said.
Goldie seems even more confident
than his coach. "I'm going to play the
same way I always do. Nothing differ
ent," he said. "His serves are pretty
good but nothing great."
Against Arizona State, 19-9 over
all, Goldie will play Andy Roediger
in No. 1 singles. Roediger also plays

No. 1 doubles with Keith Thomas.
They are 13-7 in dual match competi
tion.
Arizona State is unranked in the
current Intercollegiate Tennis
Coaches Association poll, but was
ranked 17th in preseason polls. It
has had one upset loss, 6-3, to
Arizona this season.
The Wildcats, led bv Papal, are 12-
12 overall, and in last place in the Six-
Pac with a 1 -6 league record. Arizona
has won eight of its last 1 1 matches to
turn around a poor season beginning.
Papal plays No. 1 doubles with
sophomore Jose Wasserfirer. They
are 6-4 in dual match competition. At
No. 2 doubles, lan Ailer and John
Schmitt will probably see Stanford's
Pat McEnroe and Derrick Rostagno.
Gould considers the Arizona teams
something to be "reckoned with in
the future. They have some good
young players, and are well-coached.
Down the road they will be good
teams," he said.
Neither Arizona team has any cur
rently ranked players. Stanford has
three in the top 10, including Goldie
(No. 1), Jim Grabb (No. 3), and Der
rick Rostagno (No. 7).
Stanford will meet UC-Irvine
Wednesday in its last home match
before heading south to play UCLA
and USC. Irvine is ranked 17th na
tionally in the current Head Intercol
legiate Tennis Standings.
