## 
### CAROLYN TARKINGTON Staff sportswriter 
For the first time in the history of Stanford men's gym
nastics. the Cardinal will have a team at the NCAA
championships held today and tomorrow in Lincoln, Neb.
This has been Stanford's best season ever. The team of
six set several school records throughout the season and
capped the season with an NCAA berth. It is also the first
time Stanford will be represented with a full team at the
NCAAs since the beginning of the Cardinal gymnastics
program in 1938.
"It's really been a very exciting year for us." Coach
Sadao Haniada said. "We are a very unique team in that
we are relatively >oung and very small in number, but our
potential became evident early on in the season. The si/e
of our team didn't seem to hurt us one bit."
What makes the Cardinal accomplishment so outstand
ing is that the team is composed of only six gymnasts, all
of whom compete all-around â€” freshmen Mike Mat/ek
and Chuck Gerardo. sophomores Mark Arnold and
Randy Besosa and juniors Jon Levy and Gary Smith.
"I think that because all of the gymnasts on the team do
compete in the all-around, it pulls us together. We are a
tighter and stronger team because of it." Hamada said.
The talent and perseverance of the team is not the only
key to its success. Hamada. currently in his 13th season as
head coach of the Cardinal, has been a critical factor in
the team's success.
Hamada has been named Pac-10 Gymnastics Coach of
the Year. It is the second time in the past three seasons he
has gained that distinction.

"Sadao has been a strong team motivator," Smith said.
"He really helps pull the team together bv motivating us
as individuals. He works with each of us on a very individ
ual level. With individual motivation running high, the
team spirit just naturally comes together."
Hamada has coached individual gymnasts to the
NC AAs in the past, two of which are currently the top all
around team members. Levy and Besosa.
As a 1 l W) graduate of Japan's internationally known
Nippon C oil age ot Health and Physical Education,
Hamada paced his team to a second-place finish in the
All-Japan C hampionships. Hamada was an outstanding
national-level competitor during his collegiate days,
finishing second in the 1970 and 1971 National Senior
AAU All-Around Championships.
I his year s Cardinal team is ranked No. 6 in the nation.
W hen asked how the team is going to approach its first na
tional championships. Hamada replied, "Of course it will
be exciting just to be there. But we are also going with the
attitude that we are strong contenders for a place in the
top six. It won't be easy, but we have the potential to do
it."
Hamada's predictions of a place in the top six are well
founded. Ihe Cardinal has been improving in consistency
and performance from meet to meet throughout the entire
season.
"I joked once at the beginning of the season that if we
keep going at this rate. h\ the time the end of the season
comes around we'll be No. 1 in the country," Hamada
said. Going into the NCAAs at No. f>. the Cardinal is not
too far from turning that joke into a real
