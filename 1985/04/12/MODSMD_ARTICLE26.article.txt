# Men golfers host U.S. Intercollegiate
## Stanford hoping for comeback 
### KEN STEVENS Staff sportswriter 
Stanford Men's Golf Coach Tim Schaaf is hoping
history will repeat itself as his team heads into the
final weeks of the season, beginning with the Stan
ford U.S. Intercollegiate tomorrow and Sunday at
the Stanford Golf Course.
Last year, the Cardinal golfers found themselves
in the midst of a slump with only a month remain
ing in the season. After playing poorly in the first
round of the Western Intercollegiate in Santa Cruz,
they recovered with two solid rounds, which, ac
cording to Schaaf, helped turn the team's season
around.
"We played well from there on," Schaaf said,
noting that the Cardinal went on to finish second in
the Pac-10 Championships and qualified for the
NCAA Championships.
Some of the names and faces may have changed,
but the Cardinal men seem to be repeating the
events of a year ago. At least Schaaf hopes so.
As recently as a month ago, the Cardinal was
finishing consistently at the top of the leaderboard,
waltzing toward a trip to Florida for this year's na
tionals. Then disaster struck.

Within the period of a week at the end of March
and the beginning of April, Stanford finished 50
shots out of contention at the Fresno Pepsi Classic
and 25 shots back at the Western Intercollegiate.
However, be it coincidence or not, there was a
silver lining in the Cardinal's otherwise dismal
finish at the Western Intercollegiate much like last
year.
Following an opening round of 392 that closed
the door on any Cardinal hopes of winning the
tournament, Stanford improved to 380 in the
second round and then proceeded to fire a
tournament-best 363 in the final round. The indi
vidual scores for this round read 71, 71, 73, 74, 75
and 76.
Schaaf is hoping that the Cardinal's play in the
closing rounds of the Western Intercollegiate will
— as it did last year — start the team on a roll that
will carry it all the way to Florida.
Schaaf indicated that the final round at the West
ern Intercollegiate was a confidence builder for
several of the golfers. "A couple of the guys who
have been struggling (Doug Thompson and Carl
Wagner) got out of ruts," Schaaf said.

At the Stanford U.S. Intercollegiate, the Card
inal men will be able to challenge UCLA and San
Jose State, both of whom are currently beating the
Cardinal in head-to-head competition, the major
factor for NCAA tournament berths.
With the top four teams in District 8 at the end of
the season assured of berths in the nationals, Stan
ford is currently battling with San Jose for the third
spot. The Cardinal is two victories ahead of both
USC and Arizona.
"The important match-up is against San Jose,"
Schaaf said, noting that a Cardinal victory over the
Spartans this weekend would tie the teams in head
to-head competition. The season series would then
be decided when the two schools play in the Sun
Devil Invitational April 25-27 at Scottsdale, Ariz.
The fact that this weekend's tournament is being
played on the Cardinal's home course could prove
to be a very big plus for Stanford.
Earlier this season the Cardinal golfers were vic
torious on their home course in the Stanford Fall
Intercollegiate.
Also, the Spartan men traditionally do not play
as well at Stanford, Schaaf said.
