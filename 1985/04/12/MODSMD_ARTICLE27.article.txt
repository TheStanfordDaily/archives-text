# Softball trying to break slump
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER Senior sportswriter 
The Stanford softball team will
take on a junior college squad today,
but that probably doesn't mean an
easy time for the Cardinal.
Stanford, 8-36, will play a non
conference double-header against
Cuesta College of San Luis Obispo at
Roble Field at 2 p.m. Cuesta is com
parable to another junior college
team the Cardinal has played this
season, according to Cardinal Coach
Kathy Lincoln.
"Cuesta should be similar to San
Jose City College," Lincoln said.
"They're one of the better junior col
lege teams around." Stanford won
only one of three games against San
Jose City, losing a double-header
Feb. 22.
The Cardinal also lost a double
header to California on Wednesday
and will be looking to get out of what
Lincoln said is a "big slump all
around."
"It's hard to get over it," she said.
Asked if Stanford players are putting
more pressure on themselves as
slumps and losses continue, Lincoln
said "a lot" of pressure is "definitely"
being applied at the plate. "They're
definitely thinking about things more

because we're not winning. You
analyze things more when you lose."
One of the Cardinal's problems has
been establishing momentum, but
Lincoln said trying to solve slow starts
that allow opponents to get momen
tum is potentially dangerous.
"I've gone over it in my mind 1,000
times," she said. "It has to be from
them. If you push it, there's more
pressure. Right now, we have to keep
it as much fun as possible."
Stanford's four remaining Western
Collegiate Athletic Association
games might be more fun than the in
itial eight, all losses. Two of the Card
inal's final WCAA games will be
against Long Beach State at Roble
Field tomorrow at 1 p.m.
"They've lost to some good teams,
but they're definitely not one of the
stronger teams in the league," Lin
coln said. Long Beach, 17-15 overall
and 2-4 in the WCAA, has strong
pitching and defense, but only a .213
team batting average. Its team earned
run average, though, is 1.08.
The 49ers, who play a double
header today against Cal, are led by
pitchers Kim Lee and Diane Lewis.
That pair probably will start tomor
row, and Sandy Winchester also
might pitch.
