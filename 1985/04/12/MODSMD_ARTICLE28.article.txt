## Donations keep Cardinal sailing along 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
In various marinas around the Bay
Area, many valuable and virtually
unknown Stanford assets are being
berthed.
More than 15 sail- and motorboats,
all part of the Stanford sailing team
boat donation program, are currently
docked at local marinas, where they
are maintained and used by the
sailing program until they are sold.
The boat donation program,
started by Stanford Sailing Director
Joe Petrucci approximately three
years ago, was begun primarily to
finance sailing team activities but is
also beneficial to the recreational and
educational aspects of the sailing pro
gram.
"The primary goal of the donation
program is to turn over those boats
donated and use the money from
their sale to foster the varsity sailing
team," Petrucci said. "Basically,
owners donate their yachts to our
program when they are in the finan
cial situation to do so, we maintain
the boats for approximately 24
months, sell them and use the
proceeds to aid the team."
Because boats are constantly being
donated and sold, there is a steady
turnover of yachts, but Stanford
usually boasts a fleet of around 16.
According to Petrucci, the donation
program has been so succesful largely
due to word of mouth and the con
stant availability of the Stanford staff.
"We do receive many donations
from Stanford alumni, but a large
portion of our donations come from
totally unaffiliated people," Petrucci
said. "Our inventory is worth approx

imately half a million dollars, but that
is only a floating asset approximation
that has not yet been turned into cash
that we can use for the team."
According to Petrucci, all of the
boats are used not only to raise
money, but also to increase sailing
skill and general interest in the sport.
The person in charge of maintain
ing all of the donated boats is full
time volunteer Mike Donovan.
Donovan coordinates the various
other volunteers who serve as skip
pers/senior safety officers for the
donated vessels.
i"The way our program is set up,
each vessel is run hv a safetv offirer

who is responsible for the main
tanence and safety of his or her ves
sel," Donovan said. "Safety officers
are also in charge of securing and
training new crew members for the
vessels."
A sufficient crew is required on
each vessel each time it is taken out,
be it for a recreational outing with the
Stanford program or a leisure sail.
The newest member of the Stan
ford fleet is a 40-foot Wilderness
racing yacht, the "Flying Machine."
Only recently donated, the "Flying

Machine" will be used to start up a
new facet of the sailing program: big
boat racing.
"We have been waiting for a boat
like the Wilderness 40-foot for a long
time," Petrucci said. "We would like
to start up a racing team that could
compete in the lORA (International
Offshore Racing Association) Series
locally. Eventually, we would love to
have a similiar boat on the East Coast
for summer tour competition."
Doug McNitt, a sophomore at
Stanford and the designated manager
of the "Flying Machine" racing pro
gram, also has high hopes for the big
boat racing program.
"The Wilderness 40 is a very fast
boat and is the prime vessel to start
off the racing program," McNitt said.
"Right now we are just trying to get
the ball moving, pick out the skipper
and crew, and get our first race be
hind us."
According to McNitt, very few uni
versities sponser big boat racing
teams because of the cost of equip
ping and transporting such large ves
sels.
Once the "Flying Machine" begins
racing, it will most likely remain in
the Bay Area until its eventual sale.
Until that time, it will also serve as a
sort of flagship for the Stanford

sailing program.
Before the "Flying Machine" can
begin competitive racing, a rotating
crew of approximately 20 must be
chosen and trained.
"Very few people really know
about the opportunities that the
sailing program can offer," Petrucci
said. "We are always open to any in
terested parties, experienced or not."
Besides being maintained primarily
for eventual sale, those boats donated
are also used in many other ways. .«•
"All of the boats we own give
members of the Stanford community
a chance to become better sailors, im
proving their talent and skill by
sailing on such large vessels,"
Petrucci said. "Although the boats
cannot be taken out alone, all mem
bers of the Stanford sailing program
can sail on the boats free of charge
when accompanied by a skipper and
crew." ~
The sailing program offers similiar
opportunities 'to all of its members.
A $35 membership fee also allows
members to sail free of charge on all
of the vessels located at Lake
Lagunita during recreation hours.
Any persons interested in racing
with the "Flying Machine" team
should call the Sailing Office at 497-
2811, or Doug McNitt at 323-5398.
