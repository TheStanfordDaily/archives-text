# USW files complaint after Lagunita worker resigns
## 
### SHIRISH DATE Senior staff writer 
The "forced resignation" of a Lagunita Food
Service worker has raised a furor among United
Stanford Worker (USW) officials, who have
accused the University of violating a number of
federal and state labor laws in connection with
the event.
USW officials filed an unfair labor practice
complaint last Thursday with the National
Labor Relations Board, charging that the Feb.
28 resignation of Caine Han was forced upon
him and was "in retaliation for union com
plaints" on his behalf, a violation of federal
labor laws.
Han said in an interview that he was told by
Susanna Wong, assistant manager at Lagunita
Food Service, that his hours would be cut from
40 to 15 a week. Han said Wong then asked him if
he wanted to resign. He said he signed a resig
nation form because he would be unable to live
working only 1 5 hours a week.
"They (management officials) said they
wanted to stand up to the union," Han said.
Lagunita Food Service Manager Barbara
Adamson refused to comment on the matter,
but Suzanne Little, a personnel representative
for Employee Relations, said her office is "as
concerned as the union" about Han's com
plaint.
"If there has been an unfair practice, we
would want to deal with it." she said.
Han said he believed the decision to cut his
hours was Adamson's and that Wong merely
"followed the order" to get rid of him.
Union officials are also accusing Lagunita

Food Service of harassing Han and Han's
father, a full-time food service worker at
Lagunita, to pressure Han into dropping his
charges against the University.
Han Han, Caine Han's father, said Wong
tried to pressure him into convincing his son not
to pursue his complaints against Stanford.
"Susanna told me if my son is still fighting Stan
ford. that means 1 am fighting too," he said.
Wong denied "harassing" either Han or his
father, saying any meetings she had with them
were "relating to work."
Caine Han said Wong called him Sunday be
cause she was worried that his public outcry
against the University would result in her losing
her job. But Han said. "I don't want her to get
fired. . . . Everything that goes wrong, she's the
one . . . they blame."
University attorney Michael Vartain said he
was unaware of any harassment, but that 'any
threats would be totally inappropriate."
Vartain said his office would be investigating
the matter fully and would take necessary steps
to ensure harassment does not occur. "It is cer
tainly not the University policy to allow that
kind of action," he added.
Han said he is afraid the University will use
Wong as a scapegoat if union and public pres
sure mounts on management. "Susanna is going
to get fired" because "the manager (Adamson)
wants to cut the budget by using non-union
people with no benefits." he said.
In March 1983, Han filled a temporary
opening at Lagunita Food Service, hoping it
eventually would lead to a perman
ent, union-protected position. But
two years later — after about a dozen
attempts at filling permanent posi
tions — Han was still working as a
"temporary" worker with no union
protection, vacation time or sick
leave, he said.
USW Field Representative Rodney
Barnett said he first talked to Han at
a February union meeting for
Lagunita Food Service members.
Barnett said Han approached him
after the meeting and asked if the
union would help him get a perman
ent position.
According to the 1982 contract be
tween the union and Stanford,
"regular staff' in the collective bar
gaining unit here includes employees
"in positions requiring at least 20
hours per week for a period actually
lasting at least four months."
Barnett said an employee who has
worked an initial four months and a
three-month probation period is a
bargaining unit member with full
union rights. Han "has the right to
work a permanent job," he added.
Barnett said he placed Han's ap
peal for bargaining-unit membership
on the agenda of the Feb. 27 meeting
of the Committee on Union-
University Concerns (CUUC), a joint
committee comprising labor and
management representatives. At that
meeting, Barnett says management
told union officials that Han was a

student hasher working only 13 hours
a week.
On Feb. 28, Han resigned, effec
tive immediately. Management
claims he quit because he found an
other job. "1 cannot force a hasher
not to resign," said assistant manager
Wong.
But in the interview, Han said he
resigned because he could not survive
on the reduced hours. He wrote "1
might have another job opportunity
this week" on his resignation because
he said he couldn't think of another
reason for quitting. He said he is cur
rently unemployed and looking for
work.
Further, Han said his work
schedule included 37 hours a week. A
check stub for the pay period ending
Jan. 31 showed he had worked 94
hours — including 14 hours of
overtime for which he was paid
straight time — in two weeks and 151
hours in the month: an average of 38
hours per week.
Lee Thompson, a cook at Lagunita,
said Han had been working between
30 and 40 hours per week for the last
19 or 20 months.
In addition, Han said that in the
past three months, he has worked 65-
70 hours of overtime for which he
was not paid time and one-half, as
California labor law requires.
Vartain said he was not aware of
the overtime issue, but said Han
would be paid for any overtime he
worked. "The University complies
with California and federal overtime
laws," he said. "If there's a mistake in
his paycheck, it will be corrected."
Vartain also said he was not certain

how many hours Han had been
working per week, but said even if
Han had worked 30 to 40 hours a
week for the last two years, that con
dition would not automatically make
him a bargaining unit member. "If by
mistake a temporary worker has
exceeded a 20-hour-a-week limit ...
that's not the remedy," he said.
"If there's a continuing need for
that position, the opening will be
posted, and he or anyone else could
apply for it," Vartain said.
Han said he had applied for 10 to
12 permanent positions at Stanford,
including three food service
openings, but had been told each time
that other applicants were more
qualified for the position.
Barnett claimed Han had been
rejected for the positions because
Stanford "wanted to keep him
working there (Lagunita) as a tempo
rary" worker with no rights or
benefits. Barnett calculated that Han
would have accrued five weeks of
vacation time, six weeks of sick leave
and paid personal time off, had access
to medical benefits and would have
been earning $1 per hour more than
his ending wage had he been a bar
gaining unit member.
USW Chief Steward Linda Crouse
concurred, saying the incident
showed "to what extremes manage
ment will go to keep someone out of
the (bargaining) unit."
University officials have in the past
defended their use of temporary
workers as necessary for matching
variable workloads and have denied
charges of trying to weaken or break
the union.
