# USW files complaint after Lagunita worker resigns
## 
### SHIRISH DATE Senior staff writer 
The "forced resignation" of a Lagunita Food
Service worker has raised a furor among United
Stanford Worker (USW) officials, who have
accused the University of violating a number of
federal and state labor laws in connection with
the event.
USW officials filed an unfair labor practice
complaint last Thursday with the National
Labor Relations Board, charging that the Feb.
28 resignation of Caine Han was forced upon
him and was "in retaliation for union com
plaints" on his behalf, a violation of federal
labor laws.
Han said in an interview that he was told by
Susanna Wong, assistant manager at Lagunita
Food Service, that his hours would be cut from
40 to 15 a week. Han said Wong then asked him if
he wanted to resign. He said he signed a resig
nation form because he would be unable to live
working only 1 5 hours a week.
"They (management officials) said they
wanted to stand up to the union," Han said.
Lagunita Food Service Manager Barbara
Adamson refused to comment on the matter,
but Suzanne Little, a personnel representative
for Employee Relations, said her office is "as
concerned as the union" about Han's com
plaint.
"If there has been an unfair practice, we
would want to deal with it." she said.
Han said he believed the decision to cut his
hours was Adamson's and that Wong merely
"followed the order" to get rid of him.
Union officials are also accusing Lagunita

Food Service of harassing Han and Han's
father, a full-time food service worker at
Lagunita, to pressure Han into dropping his
charges against the University.
Han Han, Caine Han's father, said Wong
tried to pressure him into convincing his son not
to pursue his complaints against Stanford.
"Susanna told me if my son is still fighting Stan
ford. that means 1 am fighting too," he said.
Wong denied "harassing" either Han or his
father, saying any meetings she had with them
were "relating to work."
Caine Han said Wong called him Sunday be
cause she was worried that his public outcry
against the University would result in her losing
her job. But Han said. "I don't want her to get
fired. . . . Everything that goes wrong, she's the
one . . . they blame."
University attorney Michael Vartain said he
was unaware of any harassment, but that 'any
threats would be totally inappropriate."
Vartain said his office would be investigating
the matter fully and would take necessary steps
to ensure harassment does not occur. "It is cer
tainly not the University policy to allow that
kind of action," he added.
Han said he is afraid the University will use
Wong as a scapegoat if union and public pres
sure mounts on management. "Susanna is going
to get fired" because "the manager (Adamson)
wants to cut the budget by using non-union
people with no benefits." he said.
In March 1983, Han filled a temporary
opening at Lagunita Food Service, hoping it
