# Tracksters host four-way meet
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's and womens's track teams will try
to improve their respective 3-1 and 4-0 dual meet records
this weekend at home against Washington, San Diego
State and a recent addition, the USC women's team.
For the Cardinal women, coming off a fairly successful
showing at the Texas Relays highlighted by Regina
Jacobs, who recorded this year's fastest women's col
legiate time in the 1500 meters, a lot of attention is likely
to be focused on the Trojans, currently 10-0 in dual com
petition.
USC brings in an especially tough sprinting squad, led
by junior college transfer Gervaise McGraw, who had
posted a time of 52.30 in the 400 meters, the best time last
year in the JC ranks.
The Trojans also boast the return of Sabrina Williams,
an All-American in the long jump, and Doris Curtis, a
NCAA scorer in the 800 meters
Perhaps an equally formidable foe, the San Diego State
women are 6-2 in dual meets thus far and the only team
last year to defeat the Cardinal women in head-to-head
competition.
Though the graduation of NCAA shot put champion
Ramona Pagel will hurt, the Aztecs still have discus
thrower Laura DeSnoo, 10th in the 1984 Olympics. Also
to figure prominently will be the Aztecs' hurdler, Latanya
Sheffield, who finished first in last year's Western Col
legiate Athletic Association 400 hurdles final.
Similiarly, the Aztec men's strength rests with the
sprinting corps, the Stanford men's weakest area.
San Diego State standout Hurvie Miller, voted Out
standing Performer in the Western Athletic Conference
Championships last year, enters the meet with impressive
personal season bests of 10.41 and 21.07 in the 100 and
200 meters.
The Stanford men, in contrast, look for strong fin
ishes out of their distance performers and hammer
throwers, most notably Brian Masterson and Shaun Pick
ering, who have both already qualified for the NCAAs.
The meet will begin tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Stanford
Stadium, starting with the women's javelin.
