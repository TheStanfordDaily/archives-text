WALNUT CREEK (AP) —
The Pacific 10 Conference's deal
with Turner Broadcasting System
for live, prime-time broadcasting
of football games will be worth
about $5 million to the conference
over the two years of the agree
ment, Pac-10 Executive Director
Tom Hansen said yesterday.
The money will be distributed
among conference teams
"according to a sharing formula
that benefits more those teams
which participate" in the televised
games, Hansen said.
"We were very pleased that we
were able to reach an agreement
with one of the national cable
companies because our geographi
cal isolation makes it particularly
important that we receive national
exposure." he added.

Hansen said that up to 11 games
this year will be split between
CBS and Turner, and that the net
works will begin in September to
select the games they want, about
12 days in advance of each game.
"We've been working on it (the
Turner deal) ever since we signed
with CBS in January," Hansen
said, referring to the $9 million,
two-year pact with CBS. "We
talked to Turner last summer
about the 1984 season agreement,
which we failed to rea<?h. We
started talking again right after the
first of the year."
Hansen said that there was no
immediate indication of interest
by Turner's Super Station WIBS
in carrying other sports, such as
basketball.
