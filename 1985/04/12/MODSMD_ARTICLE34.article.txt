## Chez Louis brings artistry to French cuisine 
### 
Chez Louis
4170 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
493-1660
Located down El Camino 10
minutes from campus is an incon
spicuous French restaurant named
Chez Louis. Serving Stanford stu
dents since 1932, when it was called
L'Omelette, this establishment is a
rare find for connoisseurs of fine
French food.
In days past, the restaurant served
as a student haunt in part because it
was one of the closest establishments
to campus allowed to serve alcohol.
These days, the "dry" law no longer
exists, and not as many students
venture down EI Camino to dine at
Chez Louis. Members of former
Stanford generations who return to
the restaurant will find that not much
has changed in their absence; the
■food and the atmosphere are still su
perb. Present students would do well
•to follow the example of their
predecessors and travel down the
'road for an extraordinary meal.
The atmosphere of the restaurant is
relaxed and understated, with the
'country inn ambience of a rustic res
taurant. Decorations in the rooms in
clude an extensive collection of men's
hats ranging from a samurai hat to
•Jim Plunkett's football helmet,
'photographs out of Stanford's past,
and copper pans hanging from the
■dark wood beam interior. With soft
jnusic wafting through the air, and
[Soft light generated by the stone
fireplace and hurricane lamps, the
jnood is ideal for a quiet and private
dinner.
The service is attentive but not in
trusive, and is leisurely enough to al
low sustained table conversations.
Immediately after we were seated, our
waiter, Mark, arrived to take our
cocktail orders. I followed his sugges
tion to begin the meal with a French

cocktail, a Dubonnet, which arrived
quickly with my companion's more
traditional gin and tonic. Mark was
pleasant and helpful throughout our
meal, and his recommendations were
consistently fantastic. Chez Louis also
offers an extensive, if expensive, wine
list for consideration.
The food is prepared with high
standards; everything we ordered was
spectacular. Not only taste buds are
tantilized by the dishes, however, as
each plate is an artistic creation de
signed to delight the eyes as well. The
composition of each plate is planned
down to the tiniest garnish, making
each seem worthy of photographic in
clusion in a modern art museum.
For appetizers, we ordered an
asparagus dish off the day's special
list, and a mousseline of salmon and
Bay scallops ($3.75). While we
awaited their arrival, we were each
served a complimentary piece of
quiche. My companion, a self
declared non-fan of quiche, confessed
to liking the dish, as did I. The ap
petizers arrived quickly, each ar
ranged artistically on their platters.
Although the salmon and scallop se
lection was quite good (a pureed,
reduced, then chilled concoction), the
asparagus stole the pre-dinner spot
light. Each stalk of asparagus was del
icate and delicious, better than I can
ever remember having tasted.
There is a wide selection of ap
petizers, both hot and cold, on the
menu. The former list includes escar
gots de Bourgogne ($5.25), and
warm prawn salad with basil butter
($6.50). Cold appetizers include
smoked salmon ($6.95), bluepoint
oysters ($5.75) and homemade pate
($3.75). There is also a generous
choice of salads on the menu, ranging
in price from $3 to $6.
The main dishes are the highlight
of the menu, divided almost equally
into catagories of fish and of meat

and poultry. My date selected the
medallions of fillet of beef with mat
hurini sauce (a prune sauce with
raisins). His selection came with two
medium-sized pieces of beef cooked
to order. The arrangement of the
plate faintly reminded me of a face
emblazoned with a smile, with the
two pieces of meat as the eyes. If so, it
was an accurate foreshadowing of the
selection. As with my dish, the sauce
was light and not dependent upon su
perfluous cremes and thickening
agents; the result was an innovative
and tasty sauce which complemented,
rather than overwhelmed, the beef.
My companion declared his choice to
be a spectacular dish.
The Prawns a la Provencale, which
1 chose, were a wonderful decision on
my part as well. A provencale sauce
contains all the elements of Simon
and Garfunkel's "Parsley, Sage,
Rosemary and Thyme," and Chef
Michel Veron's interpretation was
tastefully seasoned. It would be diffi
cult to go astray when choosing an
entree from this menu; all the dishes I
sampled were sparkling and
memorable for their quality.
The seafood entrees include fillet
of petrale sole ($13.95), grilled fresh
salmon ($17.25), sea bass ($16.50)
and fresh Bay scallops ($15.95). The
meat entrees include chicken
($13.25), margret of duck ($15.50),
milk-fed veal ($16.75), New York
steak ($17.25) and fresh rack of lamb
($18.25). Each of the entree dishes,
of course, comes with a special sauce,
but also includes the soup of the day,
French bread and a side dish of
vegetables and rice or potatos. Al
though the entrees look small, but are
quite filling.
Nevertheless, we did not wish to
end our dining experience without
sampling dessert, so we took Mark's
advice and ordered Gratin of
Raspberrries with a Coulis of red

fruits ($4.50) and the not-listed
specialty, house sherbets. They came
quickly, and disappeared off our
plates only a little more slowly as we
attempted to savor their phenomenal
flavors. I thought my choice, the
former, was unsurpassable, with its
delicious combination of delicate
pastry floating as if an island in a sea
of raspberry sauce, adorned with ice
cream. The sherbets proved me
wrong.
The house sherbets, which change
depending on what is in season, were
the best ices I, or my companion, had
ever enjoyed. He had apple, straw
berry and melon, each in its own
pastry shell surrounded by fresh
fruits. Each tasted as if the fruit was
itself melting in one's mouth, but
somehow was even better than the
real thing. Many of the fruits come di
rectly from the garden of the owner,
Louis Borel, and all are converted
into sherbet in a complicated process
in the restaurant's kitchen.
Other desserts include a dark and
white chocolate mousse with mint
sauce ($4), poached fresh pear
with butterscotch ($3.75), and the
reknowned Floating Island with
carameled almonds and vanilla sauce
($9.75 for two). Each dessert comes
with a generous complimentary plate
of petite fours.
Although the prices at Chez Louis
seem steep, the food is so remarkable
that it can be construed as a bargain
with very little rationalization. It is
not a place to go if speed is a consid
eration; our meal took more than two
and-a-half hours to complete. On the
other hand, the atmosphere nearly
requires relaxation; rushing the food
would negate the preparation meth
ods, as well as one's complete enjoy
ment of what is a fine dining opportu
nity.
If you do not have the time or the
funds to finance a full meal at Chez

Louis, you should consider stopping
by the bar for some excellent live en
tertainment in the Bistro Lounge.
Complimentary hors d'oeuvres are
provided, as is music by Major &
Minor Thursday-Saturday from 9
p.m. until 1 a.m. Dinner is served

Monday-Saturday evenings, with
lunch offered on weekdays. Reserva
tions are recommended. And so is the
restaurant.
