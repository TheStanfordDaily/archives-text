## Learning to fly opens new vistas for students 
### 
"Up in the air, upside down" says the song,
but upside down is not the best place to start for
those beginning flying lessons. With the clear
skies of spring on the horizon, now is a great
time to consider leaving the ground for some
flying lessons.
The Stanford Flying Club offers one of the
better training packages available, providing
members of the Stanford community the oppor
tunity to act on their dreams. The club is a non
profit organization, so it is able to offer rates
considerably lower than those charged by other
Bay Area commercial flight schools. Members
of the club consistently cite an advantage of
flying ability: The world becomes a lot smaller.
For example, the Sierras, a quick hour away, are
easily accessible.
Additional benefits of the club include quality
maintenance, experienced instructors, good
availability and insurance coverage. Pilots
depart when they want and fly to suit their own
schedules. If you want to land, locate the
nearest airport on your map and radio your in
tentions. Once you've landed, you can park
your aircraft for a few hours, or a few days.
Nominal layover fees of approximately $5 are
sometimes charged.
Once in the air you are basically free to relax,
enjoy the feeling of flying and the view. The
aircraft climb 1,000 feet per minute and cruise
most happily at 8,000 to 9,000 feet. You can go
almost anywhere you desire, and arrive faster
than the road allows. In an airplane, one
does not constantly need to attentively watch
other drivers, traffic signs . . . and the speed
limit. Speeds in the Cessna aircraft are easily
two to four times faster than on the freeway.
If you are interested in obtaining your pilot's
license, perhaps you still question how difficult
it is to operate a plane. It is not overly difficult,
for student pilots can obtain solo licenses with
only nine to 18 hours of flight time. To fly with
passengers, additional training and a private
pilot certificate is mandatory. This requires
jompleting a written exam and a minimum of
40 hours flight time.
Not all is simple and carefree with flying,
however. Even before stepping into the plane,
there are check-ups to make on the aircraft's

body as well as the fuel and oil. Then, when pre
paring for takeoff, the radios are set, controls
checked and all of the checklist methodically
completed before communicating to the tower
that you are prepared for takeoff. The collision
lights are turned on, the pilot talks to the radar
station and takes off when given approval.
Palo Alto Airport offers the pilot k variety of
places to fly to for an afternoon or weekend.
Furthermore, it is one of the better training
locations and busiest airports of its kind in the
world. Weather is usually excellent and mem
bers can fly as often as their schedules permit.

When flying a plane,
one does not need to
attentively watch other
drivers, traffic signs or
the speed limit.

Because the club has 15 airplanes, there is no
problem reserving a plane. The airport itself
operates 24 hours a day, although pilots are on
their own after 9 p.m., when the tower closes.
To prepare students for a change in weather
conditions, bad weather training is provided
using a hood. This special device limits vision.
Pilots cannot look out the windows; their frame
of reference is restricted to the panels.
Approximately 100 to 250 people belong
to the Stanford Flying Club at any one time. In
addition to offering training and year-round use
of its aircraft, the club organizes activities in
cluding field trips and publishes a newsletter.
Membership cards, which cost $15, are being
offered for the remainder of the year,
ending Sept. 24. Recent events included an
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) safety
seminar and a visit to the FAA Bay Area radar
guidance facility. For information on learning to
flv and rental rates, call the Stanford Flying
dub at 851-2400.
