## Kennedy enjoys day on campus 
### DANNY PEARL Staff writer 
Sen. Edward Kennedy made the
most of his six-hour visit to the Farm
yesterday, fitting in tennis, a closed
luncheon and a briefing by the dean
of the Graduate School of Business.
The Faculty Club lunch was with a
small group, including University
President Donald Kennedy, two staff
members, four student organizers,
one personal friend and two John
Lewises.
One John Lewis, a professor of po
litical science, is director of the Cen
ter for International Security and
Arms Control here. The other John
Lewis is a second-year law student, to
whom an invitation was mailed by
mistake. "I figured they were either
rewarding me for working on Ken
nedy's campaign five years ago or
were choosing a random student,"
the student said.
Catherine Milton, special assistant
to President Kennedy, said, "We had
been briefed by the police to be on
the watch for suspicious characters.
But when (Lewis) showed me his in
vitation, I went back and explained
what happened to Sen. Kennedy and
President Kennedy. They both imme
diately said, "Well, let's have him to
lunch."
After lunch, Sen. Kennedy
proceeded to the varsity tennis
courts, where he played a with mem
bers of the tennis team.
