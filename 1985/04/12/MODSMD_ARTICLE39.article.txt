Baby Doll (1955)
Cedar, San Francisco
In his "middle" period (ending with
"The Night of the Iguana," in 1961),
Tennessee Williams wrote unabashedly
for his actors, letting them run wild with
screaming tantrums, thick, juicy
monologues, big Freudian revelation
scenes and horseplay of a specifically
Southern-infantile variety. Though his
plays of this era are mostly pretty bad,
filled with gaudy dialogue, this
screenplay, which he whipped up out of a
couple of one-acts ("27 Wagons Full of
Cotton" and "The Unsatisfactory Sup
per") is clever and enormously enjoy
able. Carroll Baker plays Baby Doll, the
virgin bride of Archie Lee Meighan (Karl
Maiden), who promised her daddy on his
deathbed to take care of his little girl but
to wait until she was "ready" before bed
ding her. When Archie expedites some
business by burning down a cotton gin
belonging to his neighbor, Silva Vaccaro
(Eli Wallach), Silva takes his revenge —
by paying Baby Doll a little visit. Elia
Kazan directed all these Actors Studio
performers (Mildred Dunnock,
Madeleine Sherwood, Lonny Chapman
and Rip Torn are also in the cast) as well
as a large number of Mississippi non
actors; the acting honors go (easily) to
Wallach, who has never been better, but
Kazan turns out to be the real star. (The
direction is mostly magnificent.)
Photographed by the great Boris Kauf
man. This movie caused a lot of fuss in its
day: The Catholic League of Decency
condemned it.
Plays today and tomorrow with "The
Last Tycoon."
North by Northwest (1959)
Kresge Auditorium
One of Alfred Hitchcock's last first
rate thrillers — a gloriously entertaining,
wittily sustained variation on his old
theme of the innocent trapped in in
trigue. Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint,
Jessie Royce Landis, Martin Landau and
Mount Rushmore are among the
featured players. Ernest Lehman wrote
the script, which contains one of the most
famous lines in any suspense film:
"That's funny — that duster's dustin'
crops where there ain't no crops." The
title, by the way, is both a reference to
"Hamlet" ("I am mad north
northwest. . . . ") and a clue to the geog
raphy of the movie.
Plays tonight at 9.
Places in the Heart (1984)
Memorial Auditorium
The ti*Ie ought to clue audiences in to
the sort of movie to expect: antique
Hollywood inspirational, in the style of
sermonizing children's novels about
families pulling together to survive hard
times ("Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage
Patch," "The Five Little Peppers and
How They Grew"). Sally Field gives a
feisty-little-lady performance as Edna
Spalding, who, raising two young
children in a small town in Texas, finds
herself a widow when a young black man
on a binge accidentally shoots and kills
her husband, the local sheriff. Edna is a
pint-size Southwestern madonna; after
her husband dies, she never betrays any
sexual longing. Robert Benton's movie
bears a close resemblance to "Cross
Creek," especially in its big triumph
over-the-land production number (Edna
harvests the county's first cotton crop to
walk away with the annual prize), but it's
even worse — "Cross Creek" suffered
more from ineptitude than from bad in
tentions. A number of talented actors
(John Malkovich, Lindsay Crouse, Ed
Harris, Amy Madigan) knuckle under to
Benton's unrelenting vision; dressed up
to look like Walker Evans models, under
"classic" lighting by Nestor Almendros,
they mostly look stiff and anxious.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 and 9:30.

Das Boot (1982)
Haus Mitteleuropa
This film, which was written and di
rected by the German filmmaker
Wolfgang Petersen, possesses no striking
thematic or characterological differences
from any other World War II submarine
adventure; what distinguishes it is its per
spective. Almost the entire picture is shot
from within the U-boat of the title; we
experience the attacks from British ves
sels as the crew of the boat does. It's a
solidly crafted movie — and a small,
funny essay on the horrors of intimate
communal living — but it has a structural
problem: the most exciting portion — a
series of three attacks by the British that
nearly decimates the sub — occurs too
early, so the last 45 minutes are more
wearing than they should be. And the
movie is cursed with an unfair downer of
an ending.
Plays Thursday at 7:30.
The Girl Can't Help It (1956)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This musical comedy, directed by
Frank Tashlin and shot by Leon Sham
roy, has a nifty opening number that
plays with the size of the screen (the film
is in Cinemascope); and straight through
the photography (in Eastmancolor) is
bold, bright, and comically varied, like a
Rose Bowl Parade. The art director and
costume designer must have had the time
of their lives, and in the fantasy se
quences, Shamroy's palette color
coordinates with the costumes. It's a pity
the substance (a script by Tashlin and
Herbert Baker), which features Jayne
Mansfield as a would-be singing star with
no talent and Tom Ewell as her agent, is
so pathetic. Mansfield looks sensational,
but Ewell, a stage comedian (who also
got to act opposite Marilyn Monroe, in
"The Seven Year Itch"), is pinched and

dried up on the screen; everything he
does seems prefabricated. The cast in
cludes Edmond O'Brien, Henry Jones
and (briefly) Barry Gordon, a decade
before "A Thousand Clowns." (He
already acts like a miniature adult.)
There are also lots of pop acts — Julie
London, Ray Anthony, The Platters,
Eddie Cochran, Abbey Lincoln (who
sings gospel in a red gown with a deep
decollete), and for those who care about
real rock 'n' roll, Little Richard, Fats
Domino and Gene Vincent (performing
"Be-Bop-a-Lula").
Plays tomorrow.
The Last Tycoon (1976)
Cedar, San Francisco
The famous unfinished F. Scott
Fitzgerald novel, adapted by Harold
Pinter and directed by Elia Kazan — one
would be hard put to find three talents
temperamentally less suited to each
other, and the movie is a predictable
bomb. What is less predictable is how
thoroughly, relentlessly boring it is.
Robert De Niro gives an excellent (if
submerged) performance as Monroe
Stahr, whom Fitzgerald based on M-G-
M's czar, Irving Thalberg; De Niro pro
vides Stahr with authentic reserves of
intelligence and wit. It's not a very
bracing performance, however; it doesn't
do much to enliven the movie. Tony
Curtis (as an impotent star of swashbuck
lers) and Jack Nicholson (as a Commu
nist emissary from the Screen Writers'
Guild) bring momentary relief from all
the lethargy, which drowns the likes of
Robert Mitchum, Jeanne Moreau,
Donald Pleasence, Ray Milland, Dana
Andrews, John Carradine, Theresa Rus
sell and Jeff Corey. As Kathleen, the
dream heroine, Ingrid Boulting gives one
of the worst debut performances in the
history of movies: She floats in on a huge

Asian bust, empty-eyed, waiting for
someone to direct her, and whenever she
speaks, her line readings are at odds with
her facial expressions — she seems to be
emotionally (and mentally) discon
nected.
Plays today and tomorrow with "Baby
Doll."
Ride the High Country (1962)
Cedar, San Francisco
. One of the greatest Westerns ever
made, this deeply affecting farewell to
the Old West was Sam Peckinpah's
second picture, and it first displayed both
his instinct for filmmaking and his in
stinctual understanding of the Western
myth. Working with the superb
cinematographer Lucien Ballard, Peck
inpah uses the resources of Cinemascope
and Metrocolor to describe the expansive
beauty of the late 19th-century West;
and he works from our built-in emotional
responses to his two leading actors, Joel
McCrea and Randolph Scott, who play
aging gunfighters. You can't believe how
good Scott is; McCrea, a fine (and largely
unnoticed) actor, is terrific, as he often is.
N.B. Stone, Jr. wrote the script. Mariette
Hartley plays the innocent young woman
Scott and McCrea save from a horrible
marriage.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
"Major Dundee."
Major Dundee (1965)
Cedar, San Francisco
Sam Peckinpah's Western, shot by
Sam Leavitt in Eastmancolor and
Panavision, is in love with open space,
with the painterly perspective the long
shot can provide. The pleasures of
watching this movie about the U.S.
cavalry, the Spanish, and the Indians in
clude Richard Harris's stylish perfor

mance as Dundee's adversary and
companion, and they aren't dimmed by
its heavy-handed script (by Harry Julian
Fink, Oscar Saul and Peckinpah himself)
or by Charlton Heston's stolidity in the
title role. (His outsize handsome profile
is almost — but not quite — enough to
overcome his inadequate acting.) But
Columbia's idiocy in chopping sections of
the film blurs the shape of the second
half. Peckinpah's resistance to this in
sensitive decision on the studio's part (he
had already dealt with the intractability
of producers when M-G-M insisted on
throwing "Ride the High Country" onto
the lower half of double bills instead of
giving it a decent release) branded him
"difficult," and he didn't work again in
Hollywood for four years. The cast in
cludes Senta Berger, Jim Hutton, James
Coburn, Michael Anderson, Jr., Warren
Oates and Slim Pickens.
Plays Sunday and Monday with "Ride
the High Country."
Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Gar
cia (1974)
Cedar, San Francisco
This nihilistic, practically necrophilic
film, in which the hero (Warren Oates)
carries the head of a dead man in a sack
for most of the running time, is possibly
Sam Peckinpah's worst. (Peckinpah and
Gordon Dawon wrote the script.) It does
have a fair amount of queasily effective
suspense, and Oates performs admirably,
but the Peckinpah trademarks are like
meaningless signposts here; some se
quences border on self-parody. With the
well-known Mexican actress Isela Vega,
Kris Kristofferson, Gig Young, Helmut
Dantine, Robert Webber and Emilio
Fernandez.
Plays Tuesday through Thursday with
"The Ballad of Cable Hogue."

Psycho (I960)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Alfred Hitchcock's most lauded
picture. It will scare the hell out of you if
you're seing it for the first time; the in
itiated return again and again to marvel
at the intricate design of the suspense se
quences and the interplay between
George Tomasin's editing and Bernard
Herrmann's jangling, expressive music
(scored solely for strings during the
shower scene). Watching this Grand
Guignol comedy, with its motel office full
of stuffed birds and its extravagant, aber
rant sexual psychology, is a perverse
plasure: No movie until •'Jaws" was so
wittily sadistic in its treatment of the au
dience. Anthony Perkins is marvelous as
the creepy motel owner, Norman Bates;
the supporting cast is headed by Janet
Leigh, Vera Miles, Martin Balsam, John
Gavin, John Mclntire and Simon Oak
land. "Psycho" turned out to be
Hitchcock's sunimitachievement; none
of his subsequent half-dozen movies can
even be discussed in the same breath.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday with
"The Birds."
The River (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Tom and Mae Garvey (Mel Gibson
and Sissy Spacek) own a farm that seems
to bring them nothing but grief. Their
bulldozer keeps breaking down, one of
their cows dies, they are in debt to every
one, and when the annual floods arrive
their land almost washes away. Quite
sensibly, the head of the local milling
company (Scott Glenn) works out a plan
with the local senator to flood the valley
in order to irrigate farm land elsewhere
in the country and provide hydro power
and jobs. But Tom and other farmers
him refuse to sell their land, so Joe puts
the pressure on the bank to foreclose ori
them. The director, Mark Rydell, ap
parently under the misconception that
he's making a 1930s problem picture
about the mistreatment of American
farmers, solemnly takes Garvey's side in
his conflict with Joe, even though his
obstinacy about holding onto his land
might strike us as schizophrenic. The
movie never questions the logic of refus
ing to sell land that barely survives the
flood every year; the Garveys act up to
some heroic ideal throughout the movie,
but their heroism is so lunatically
misplaced that after an hour you begin to
think you're crazy. A dopey
(though not as badly acted as
"Country"), shot by Vilmos Zsigmond}
who makes every exterior look like a
Maxfield Parrish.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday with "The
Natural."
Country (1984)
York, San Francisco
Jessica Lange and Sam Shepard as The
People (in the Steinbeckian sense), The
Salt of the Earth — Gil and Jewell Ivy
(names that stick in the craw). They farm
the "best land in the world," Black Hawk
County, lowa, but the failing economy
obliges them to live on loans from the
government-run Farmers Home Admin
istration. Now the FHA has decided that
the Ivys and many of their neighbors are
bad credit risks, so they demand immedi
ate pay-off on their loans, knowing that
the only possible route for these trapped
farmers is foreclosure. But the govern
ment has underestimated the resilience
of Those Who Are Close to the Soil.
Lange, Shepard, screenwriter William D.
Witliff and director Richard Pearce work
hard to earn their place in heaven: They
preach so long and hard that they forget
to supply any drama — the movie is in
ert. It's also shameless, fraudulent and
sanctimonious. With Wilford Brimley (of
course) as Lange's good-hearted old dad;
shot by David Walsh, who lights the film
as if it were an altar.
Plays Sunday with "Never Cry Wolf."
