Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.),
speaking yesterday in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, called on the United
States to provide massive amounts of
food aid to famine-stricken Africa
and challenged African countries to
prove themselves worthy.
During his midday address before a
capacity crowd of 800, Kennedy said
Ethiopia and Sudan should be pres
sured to enact long-term agricultural
reform. He also said "mercy cor
ridors" should be created immedi
ately to provide safe passage for relief
convoys in militarily sensitive parts of
Ethiopia.
"Mercy corridors are a feasible
response to save lives without signifi
cantly tilting the political balance in
the rebel areas (in Ethiopia)," Ken
nedy said. The Ethiopian government
has already rejected the idea of a
"food truce," but Kennedy said
mercy corridors are a less far
reaching notion.
Kennedy, whose speech was part of
Stanford's week-long hunger confer
ence. described graphically the tragic
ft cts of the African hunger crisis,
which he and his family observed
during a Christmas visit to Ethiopia
and Sudan. "We saw mothers watch
ing in despair, as famished children
succumbcd to measles and
pneumonia. We saw infants too weak
even to brush away the flies drinking
the moisture from their eyes. We saw
whole villages decimated by the
famine."
"Unless $1.5 billion more in emer
gency food and relief is supplied this
year, we will begin to see the tragedy
of Ethiopia repeated in other
countries," Kennedy said. Kennedy is
the co-sponsor of a Senate bill that
would make an open-ended ap
propriation over the next two years of
whatever dollar amount is needed to
provide 50 percent of Africa's food
needs.
But Kennedy declined to directly
criticize the Reagan administration's
proposed budget cuts for UNICEF,
the International Fund for Agricul
tural Development and other organi
zations. Answering a question from
the floor, Kennedy said, "I want to be
quite frank. I have always been a
strong supporter of the specialized
relief organizations. But this is their
test. They have a history of rivalries
between organizations and of waste
ful bureaucracy, and they are really

going to have to get their act together
now."
Kennedy said the Reagan adminis
tration deserves credit for its
response to the international hunger
crisis, but he sharply criticized the
president and his Senate supporters
for not doing enough about hunger in
the United States. "What we need
right now in Washington is a few
more votes for food for children and a
few less votes for MX missiles," said
Kennedy, earning enthusiastic ap
plause.
Students and members of the com
munity arrived as early as 9 a.m. to be
assured of seats. Many were avid
Kennedy supporters, like Michael
Kuruvilla, a Mountain View software
engineer. "Of all the people in

politics today, I respect him most.
He's not an actor. He's involved in
the hunger issue and other issues be
cause he cares." Some students ad
mitted they wanted to hear Kennedy
speak because of rumors that he will
seek the Democratic Party's nomina
tion for president in 1988.
Kennedy made two oblique refer
ences to a rumored 1988 presidential
bid. After acknowledging University
President Donald Kennedy, who in
troduced the Senator, Sen. Kennedy
quipped, " 'President Kennedy' —
That sort of has a ring to it. doesn't

it?" But Sen. Kennedy responded to
a student's question about how stu
dents could get involved with hunger
issues and with a Kennedy campaign
by saying, "I think I'll hold off on
answering the second part — for a
year or two."
Asked after his speech if he would
return to campus to announce a presi
dential bid, Kennedy said, "We'll
have to see. We always like to come
back here."
Student reaction to the speech was
generally favorable. "I liked it a lot,"
said sophomore Danny Kodmur. "1
expected him to take more jabs at
Reagan, and I was pleasantly
surprised that he emphasized the
problem itself, rather than our fail-

ures in attacking the problem."
Hunger conference organizers said
Kennedy's speech attracted the larg
est crowd of any conference events so
far. A White Plaza "Hunger Fair,"
which offered relief organization rep
resentatives a chance to make con
tacts with Stanford students,
benefited from Kennedy's inspira
tion. "We had 20 students taking ap
plications," said Carol Benson, the
Peace Corps' Stanford recruitment
coordinator. "That's much more than
we usually get when we come to
campus."

president and his Senate supporters
for not doing enough about hunger in
the United States. "What we need
right now in Washington is a few
more votes for food for children and a
few less votes for MX missiles," said
Kennedy, earning enthusiastic ap
plause.
Students and members of the com
munity arrived as early as 9 a.m. to be
assured of seats. Many were avid
Kennedy supporters, like Michael
Kuruvilla, a Mountain View software
engineer. "Of all the people in

politics today, I respect him most.
He's not an actor. He's involved in
the hunger issue and other issues be
cause he cares." Some students ad
mitted they wanted to hear Kennedy
speak because of rumors that he will
seek the Democratic Party's nomina
tion for president in 1988.
Kennedy made two oblique refer
ences to a rumored 1988 presidential
bid. After acknowledging University
President Donald Kennedy, who in
troduced the Senator, Sen. Kennedy
quipped, " 'President Kennedy' —
That sort of has a ring to it. doesn't

it?" But Sen. Kennedy responded to
a student's question about how stu
dents could get involved with hunger
issues and with a Kennedy campaign
by saying, "I think I'll hold off on
answering the second part — for a
year or two."
Asked after his speech if he would
return to campus to announce a presi
dential bid, Kennedy said, "We'll
have to see. We always like to come
back here."
Student reaction to the speech was
generally favorable. "I liked it a lot,"
said sophomore Danny Kodmur. "1
expected him to take more jabs at
Reagan, and I was pleasantly
surprised that he emphasized the
problem itself, rather than our fail-

ures in attacking the problem."
Hunger conference organizers said
Kennedy's speech attracted the larg
est crowd of any conference events so
far. A White Plaza "Hunger Fair,"
which offered relief organization rep
resentatives a chance to make con
tacts with Stanford students,
benefited from Kennedy's inspira
tion. "We had 20 students taking ap
plications," said Carol Benson, the
Peace Corps' Stanford recruitment
coordinator. "That's much more than
we usually get when we come to
campus."
