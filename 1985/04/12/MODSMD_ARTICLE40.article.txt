## Panel stresses hunger awareness 
### DEBORAH KEHLE Staff writer 
In the world hunger crisis, "There's
only one boat in which we have to
float or sink together," a Bangladesh
nutrition expert said in a Kresge
Auditorium speech last night.
Kamaluddin Ahmad, director of
the Institute of Nutrition of Dhaka
University, was one member of a
panel addressing "The Role of the
University in Solving World
Hunger."
C. Peter Timmer, professor of
Business and Agriculture at Harvard,
said, "It takes commitment, it takes
understanding, it takes capacity" to
solve the problem of world hunger.
His view was reiterated by his fel
low speakers.
Awetu Simesso, co-founder of the
Stanford East African Relief Organi
zation, pointed out that the problem
of famine is imbedded in a number of
interrelated problems and called on

people to "inform your compassion
with knowledge."
Craig Nalen, president of the Over
seas Private Investment Corporation,
agreed and rephrased Simesso's com
ment as "make sure you know some
thing before you try to go out and do
something."
Timmer explained that short-term
solutions to the problem of mal
nutrion often create long-term prob
lems, and vice-versa. "We all must
understand that hunger is a very com
plex problem," he said, calling for
all members of the University com
munity to search for answers that
could solve both short and long term
problems.
"Given the complexities and the
magnitude of the problem, please get
involved," Simesso said.
Nalen suggessted that one means of
aiding the Third World was through
business, especially through business
investment in developing nations.
