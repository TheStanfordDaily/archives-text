# Expert assails food gifts

Inundating famine-stricken nations with food gifts
will only aggravate the existing hunger situation, said
Garrett Hardin, professor emeritus of human ecology
at UC-Santa Barbara, during a panel discussion yester
day at Tresidder Union.
Hardin participated in a discussion with Political Sci
ence Prof. David Abernethy on "The Sanctity of the
Earth's Carrying Capacity" before an audience of 100.
Criticizing the practice of shipping food gifts to un
derdeveloped nations as "a very shallow view ot the
situation," Hardin explained that in the long run a par
ticular environment can only sustain a limited number
of individuals.
Hardin used an example of starving deer to illustrate
his point. If people fed and kept an entire herd of deer
alive one winter, the increase in deer over several years
could cause significant damage to the environment.
Many factors besides food complicate an environ
ment's carrying capacity for people, Hardin said.
Human beings need shelter, clothes and large sources
of energy. Sending food gifts to malnourished people
resolves the short-term problem of mass hunger but
results in more problems. "The next year, there are
even more shortages," he said.

Instead, Hardin said that information should be dis
tributed to these countries to try to attain zero popu
lation growth. The current growth rate in many under
developed nations is 2 to 3 percent, he said.
Abernethy agreed that the environment must be re
garded as a limited resource, and added that, in terms
of free aid, "the best intentions may lead to some of
the worst consequences." He also supported Hardin's
emphasis on the complexity of the interconnected ele
ments in all environments, and his contention that
trade-offs often must occur in the environment.
But Abernethy disagreed with Hardin's contention
that population growth should be the main concern,
saying that the people plus their resource demands
cause the problems.
In many nations, poverty contributes to population
growth, as in many cultures, children support aged and
impoverished parents, Abernethy said. What people
fail to realize is that "the benefits of children are more
than their cost,"he said.
While Hardin emphasized looking into the future to
avoid hunger problems, Abernethy also stressed
analyzing historical actions, saying it is "very important
to build the historical dimension into a look at the
present."
