# Briefly

### 
There will be no edit board
meeting this weekend. We'll meet
Tuesday at 3 p.m. instead. Any ob
jections?
It is, in all probability, the last of its
kind, and that's too bad. But we can
enjoy it while we have it. It is, of
course, the annual Hale-Vineberg
Daily bash at Casa Hale-Vineberg to
morrow night at 8. Eid tells us all,
"Mi casa es su casa," and when he
starts wildly ripping Talking Heads
posters from the walls tomorrow
night, he'll show that he feels the op
posite should be true as well. All
Daily tards invited; for more infor
mation, drop by the office and pick
up a flier.
