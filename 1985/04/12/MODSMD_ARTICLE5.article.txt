# Libertarian protests policy on registration
## 
### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff 
Last Dec. 6, a former head of the Arkansas Libertari
an Party was arrested in his Little Rock home for re
fusing to register with the Selective Service. Yesterday.
Paul Jacob told about 30 people in History Corner about
the issues of his case and what he sees as the federal gov
ernment's attempt to downplay the significance of
Selective Service registration.
Jacob, 25. went underground for a few years after he
was initially threatened with prosecution, but later re
surfaced to be with his f;imily. He is currently touring the
country before his May 6 trial to point out to people that
registration is more of a "big deal" than the Selective Ser
vice and the government make it out to be.
He maintains that his case is different from those of
better-known resistcrs like David Wayte because, unlike
them, he failed to write the Selective Service to say that he
was going to refuse to register. Thus, Jacob says, his pro
secution is directly tied to his protest activities.
According to Jacob, registering for the draft is tan
tamount to signing one's life away to involuntary ser
vitude. The Solomon Amendment, which denies federal
financial aid to students who fail to comply with registra
tion laws, should not deter students from following their
principles, he said.
"We're going to have to be willing to do without some
of the money from Big Brother if we're going to be suc
cessful in stopping the government from having control
over our lives," he said.

The only time young people should
be compeled to fight for the United
States is when it is directly attacked,
Jacob said. Even then, the draft
would be superfluous.
"What draft registration says to
young people is that we won't defend
ourselves and our homeland and our
liberties unless we're threatened with
a prison sentence. Whereas the
Selective Service tells us that they're
ready to send draft notices and put

100,000 people in training camps
within 13 days, if this country is ever
attacked, there will be millions of vol
unteers there, not 13 days later, but
the next day,"he said.
Jacob called the Selective Service's
advertising campaign part of a con
tinuing effort by the U.S. government
to disguise its desire to engage in in
terventionist wars around the globe.
The campaign includes TV spots with
"Michael Jackson clones" dancing
into the post office to sign registration
forms, and posters representing
registration as part of a rite of passage
to manhood, he said.
But, he added, "Young people are

smart enough to realize that there's
nothing in it for them to attack an
other country." Jacob estimated that
twice as many men of draft age have
resisted registering as the Selective
Service says, and said the govern
ment, confronted with this fact, has
been forced to put the draft on the
shelf for the time being. "Quite pos
sibly," he said, "that's one reason
why we are not losing soldiers in
ground combat in Central America."
Jacob urged the members of the
audience to resist registering in any
way possible. "Every time someone
registers, they send a message to
Washington that they are available."
