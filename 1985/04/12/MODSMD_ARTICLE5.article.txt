# Libertarian protests policy on registration
## 
### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff 
Last Dec. 6, a former head of the Arkansas Libertari
an Party was arrested in his Little Rock home for re
fusing to register with the Selective Service. Yesterday.
Paul Jacob told about 30 people in History Corner about
the issues of his case and what he sees as the federal gov
ernment's attempt to downplay the significance of
Selective Service registration.
Jacob, 25. went underground for a few years after he
was initially threatened with prosecution, but later re
surfaced to be with his f;imily. He is currently touring the
country before his May 6 trial to point out to people that
registration is more of a "big deal" than the Selective Ser
vice and the government make it out to be.
He maintains that his case is different from those of
better-known resistcrs like David Wayte because, unlike
them, he failed to write the Selective Service to say that he
was going to refuse to register. Thus, Jacob says, his pro
secution is directly tied to his protest activities.
According to Jacob, registering for the draft is tan
tamount to signing one's life away to involuntary ser
vitude. The Solomon Amendment, which denies federal
financial aid to students who fail to comply with registra
tion laws, should not deter students from following their
principles, he said.
"We're going to have to be willing to do without some
of the money from Big Brother if we're going to be suc
cessful in stopping the government from having control
over our lives," he said.
