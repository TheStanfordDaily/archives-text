Reagan accuses Soviets of threats
SANTA BARBARA — President Reagan is accusing the Kremlin of
trying to "incite and exploit differences" in the West with threats and
misrepresentation, and the administration yesterday blamed Moscow for
plunging relations between the two superpowers into a chill.
Reagan said a summit meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
likely would not mark a turning point in U.S.-Soviet relations.
"I would look on it as an opportunity to clear the air and express our
desire to have a relationship that would eliminate this great (nuclear)
threat that seems to hang over the world," Reagan said in comments
made a week ago and released yesterday.
Meanwhile, responding to charges leveled by Gorbachev, White
House spokesman Larry Speakes said, "The deterioration in U.S.-Soviet
relations which has taken place in recent years is due in a large part to
Soviet actions.
"There is a limit to the degree to which U.S. actions alone can thaw
out our cool relationship," he said.
Speakes' comments came in response to a statement Wednesday by
Gorbachev that "a kind of ice age is being observed in relations between
the U.S.S.R and the United States."
The comments by Reagan and Speakes reflected a tougher line of
rhetoric toward the Soviet Union than in recent weeks. It follows Gorba
chev's call for the United States to match a Soviet freeze on deployment
of medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe.
Speakes said U.S.-Soviet relations had been hurt by the Soviet missile
buildup in Europe, the invasion of Afghanistan, the Kremlin's strong
rhetoric and its walkout in 1983 from arms talks.
The administration has rejected the missile-freeze idea, saying it
would freeze in place a Soviet warhead advantage.
In a written reply to questions submitted by The Times of London,
Reagan lashed out at Moscow for attempting to rally world opinion
against the administration's "Star Wars" missile defense plan.
"It is not at all surprising that the Soviets are now seeking, as they
have in the past in regard to other issues, to incite and exploit differences
within the West as a means of undercutting alliance efforts to strengthen
our defense and deterrent forces.
"Their propaganda tools are familiar ones, involving misrepresenta
tion, threats and now a call for a moratorium that would freeze the im
balance in Europe," Reagan added.
Discussing prospects for an arms control agreement, Reagan said,
"Historically it has often taken considerable negotiation to work out
arms control agreements.
"The U.S. will not make unilateral concessions in an effort to come
quickly to agreement, not will we be subject to artificial deadlines before
agreement must be reached," he said.
Soviets recall death of FDR
MOSCOW — The Soviet Union is marking today's 40th anniversary
of the death of Franklin Roosevelt with unusual tributes that evoke nos
talgia for the years of Soviet-American alliance.
The tributes also are critical of current American policy.
Tass, the official news agency, issued two long stories yesterday about
Roosevelt, who died April 12, 1945. One was by Valentin Berezhkov, a
leading political analyst who was Josef Stalin's interpreter in talks with
Roosevelt.
Both stories praised FDR as a "statesman of world caliber" and "a
convinced champion of cooperation with the Soviet Union." They put
Roosevelt into the context of superpower politics 40 years later by con
trasting cooperation during his administration with the state of U.S.-
Soviet relations today.
The Soviets have long included Roosevelt in the group of foreign
statesmen deserving of praise and he has been cited as an example of
how U.S. presidents should treat the Soviet Union.
The Tass coverage of the anniversary of his death was unusual because
such tributes normally are reserved for figures from Soviet and Russian
history.
Mexican drug arrests: victory?
MEXICO CITY — Two of Mexico's top drug traffickers are behind
bars and their La Familia organization damaged, but U.S. and Mexican
officials agree a major anti-drug war lies ahead before they can claim
victory.
Authorities on yesterday continued questioning Ernesto Fonseca, 60,
known as "Don Neto," the man the government calls the nation's drug
overlord and leader of La Familia, or "The Family," a confederation of
drug traffickers.
He was arrested Tuesday as Rafael Caro Quintero, with a reputation
as one of the top four members of the organization, was brought before a
federal judge on drug charges following his arrest last week in Costa
Rica.
Caro Quintero had been sought as the chief suspect in the kidnap
murder of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique
Camarena Salazar and a Mexican pilot who worked with him, Alfredo
Zavala Avelar. Both men were kidnapped Feb. 7 in Guadalajara and
their bodies found March 5.
The power of La Familia reaches throughout Mexico with a well
organized, well-funded operation that has international connections.
"In many ways it is like a cobweb. You pull a string and think you are
getting close, only to find another string. It's an endless process and as
long as Jh"re is demand there is going to be a problem," said a ranking
Mexican^.ficial who spoke on condition he not be identified.
"Mexico works at its own pace, maybe not a quick as some would like,
but in the end you have more than you thought."
American officials criticized Mexico for its slow initial respone to
reports of Camarena's kidnapping within sight of the U.S. Consulate in
Guadalajara, home base for La Familia and considered a major drug
center in Mexico.
New Brazilian leader ill
SAO PAULO. Brazil — President-elect Tancredo Neves suffered a
worsening abdominal infection last night and underwent his seventh op
eration in less than a month, a government spokesman said.
Antonio Britto said the 75-year-old Neves experienced "sharp
changes in breathing, temperature and pulse," making the new surgery
necessary. Britto said the abdominal surgery was in progress while the
announcement was made.
Earlier in the day, Britto said Neves had rallied from an "extremely
unstable" condition that was marked by signs of lung and kidney failure
on Wednesday.
But a late afternoon medical bulletin — issued before the announce
ment of the new surgery — said Neves' condition "inspired concern." It
said his heartbeat and breathing rhythms had increased slightly and he
was again running a fever — a sign of a persistent intestinal infection.
Neves was to have taken office March 15 as Brazil's first civilian presi
dent in 21 years. But an intestinal ailment required emergency surgery
and he couldn't be sworn in. His vice president, Jose Sarney, was sworn
in and has been running the country .
Swedes fire at alien submarine
STOCKHOLM — Swedish naval units yesterday fired at a submarine
after receiving indications it was engaged in "alien" activities off the en
trance to the south coast port of Karlshamn, the news agency TT said.
It was not known if the unidentified craft had been hit, the domestic
agency said, quoting unidentified military sources.
It said the naval units fired antisubmarine grenades.
The grenades, fired in swarms, are set to detonate at different depths.
They were fired 500 yards from the port entrance, the sources were
quoted as saying.
The incident took place off Karlshamn, about 18 miles from the
Karlskrona archipelago, where an intense submarine hunt took place
last March and April after alien submarines were spotted in the area.
A Soviet Whiskey class U-137 submarine ran aground in October
1981, in the area where yesterday's shooting reportedly took place.

officials agree a major anti-drug war lies ahead before they can claim
victory.
Authorities on yesterday continued questioning Ernesto Fonseca, 60,
known as "Don Neto," the man the government calls the nation's drug
overlord and leader of La Familia, or "The Family," a confederation of
drug traffickers.
He was arrested Tuesday as Rafael Caro Quintero, with a reputation
as one of the top four members of the organization, was brought before a
federal judge on drug charges following his arrest last week in Costa
Rica.
Caro Quintero had been sought as the chief suspect in the kidnap
murder of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique
Camarena Salazar and a Mexican pilot who worked with him, Alfredo
Zavala Avelar. Both men were kidnapped Feb. 7 in Guadalajara and
their bodies found March 5.
The power of La Familia reaches throughout Mexico with a well
organized, well-funded operation that has international connections.
"In many ways it is like a cobweb. You pull a string and think you are
getting close, only to find another string. It's an endless process and as
long as Jh"re is demand there is going to be a problem," said a ranking
Mexican^.ficial who spoke on condition he not be identified.
"Mexico works at its own pace, maybe not a quick as some would like,
but in the end you have more than you thought."
American officials criticized Mexico for its slow initial respone to
reports of Camarena's kidnapping within sight of the U.S. Consulate in
Guadalajara, home base for La Familia and considered a major drug
center in Mexico.
New Brazilian leader ill
SAO PAULO. Brazil — President-elect Tancredo Neves suffered a
worsening abdominal infection last night and underwent his seventh op
eration in less than a month, a government spokesman said.
Antonio Britto said the 75-year-old Neves experienced "sharp
changes in breathing, temperature and pulse," making the new surgery
necessary. Britto said the abdominal surgery was in progress while the
announcement was made.
Earlier in the day, Britto said Neves had rallied from an "extremely
unstable" condition that was marked by signs of lung and kidney failure
on Wednesday.
But a late afternoon medical bulletin — issued before the announce
ment of the new surgery — said Neves' condition "inspired concern." It
said his heartbeat and breathing rhythms had increased slightly and he
was again running a fever — a sign of a persistent intestinal infection.
Neves was to have taken office March 15 as Brazil's first civilian presi
dent in 21 years. But an intestinal ailment required emergency surgery
and he couldn't be sworn in. His vice president, Jose Sarney, was sworn
in and has been running the country .
Swedes fire at alien submarine
STOCKHOLM — Swedish naval units yesterday fired at a submarine
after receiving indications it was engaged in "alien" activities off the en
trance to the south coast port of Karlshamn, the news agency TT said.
It was not known if the unidentified craft had been hit, the domestic
agency said, quoting unidentified military sources.
It said the naval units fired antisubmarine grenades.
The grenades, fired in swarms, are set to detonate at different depths.
They were fired 500 yards from the port entrance, the sources were
quoted as saying.
The incident took place off Karlshamn, about 18 miles from the
Karlskrona archipelago, where an intense submarine hunt took place
last March and April after alien submarines were spotted in the area.
A Soviet Whiskey class U-137 submarine ran aground in October
1981, in the area where yesterday's shooting reportedly took place.
Reagan accuses Soviets of threats
SANTA BARBARA — President Reagan is accusing the Kremlin of
trying to "incite and exploit differences" in the West with threats and
misrepresentation, and the administration yesterday blamed Moscow for
plunging relations between the two superpowers into a chill.
Reagan said a summit meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
likely would not mark a turning point in U.S.-Soviet relations.
"I would look on it as an opportunity to clear the air and express our
desire to have a relationship that would eliminate this great (nuclear)
threat that seems to hang over the world," Reagan said in comments
made a week ago and released yesterday.
Meanwhile, responding to charges leveled by Gorbachev, White
House spokesman Larry Speakes said, "The deterioration in U.S.-Soviet
relations which has taken place in recent years is due in a large part to
Soviet actions.
"There is a limit to the degree to which U.S. actions alone can thaw
out our cool relationship," he said.
Speakes' comments came in response to a statement Wednesday by
Gorbachev that "a kind of ice age is being observed in relations between
the U.S.S.R and the United States."
The comments by Reagan and Speakes reflected a tougher line of
rhetoric toward the Soviet Union than in recent weeks. It follows Gorba
chev's call for the United States to match a Soviet freeze on deployment
of medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe.
Speakes said U.S.-Soviet relations had been hurt by the Soviet missile
buildup in Europe, the invasion of Afghanistan, the Kremlin's strong
rhetoric and its walkout in 1983 from arms talks.
The administration has rejected the missile-freeze idea, saying it
would freeze in place a Soviet warhead advantage.
In a written reply to questions submitted by The Times of London,
Reagan lashed out at Moscow for attempting to rally world opinion
against the administration's "Star Wars" missile defense plan.
"It is not at all surprising that the Soviets are now seeking, as they
have in the past in regard to other issues, to incite and exploit differences
within the West as a means of undercutting alliance efforts to strengthen
our defense and deterrent forces.
"Their propaganda tools are familiar ones, involving misrepresenta
tion, threats and now a call for a moratorium that would freeze the im
balance in Europe," Reagan added.
Discussing prospects for an arms control agreement, Reagan said,
"Historically it has often taken considerable negotiation to work out
arms control agreements.
"The U.S. will not make unilateral concessions in an effort to come
quickly to agreement, not will we be subject to artificial deadlines before
agreement must be reached," he said.
Soviets recall death of FDR
MOSCOW — The Soviet Union is marking today's 40th anniversary
of the death of Franklin Roosevelt with unusual tributes that evoke nos
talgia for the years of Soviet-American alliance.
The tributes also are critical of current American policy.
Tass, the official news agency, issued two long stories yesterday about
Roosevelt, who died April 12, 1945. One was by Valentin Berezhkov, a
leading political analyst who was Josef Stalin's interpreter in talks with
Roosevelt.
Both stories praised FDR as a "statesman of world caliber" and "a
convinced champion of cooperation with the Soviet Union." They put
Roosevelt into the context of superpower politics 40 years later by con
trasting cooperation during his administration with the state of U.S.-
Soviet relations today.
The Soviets have long included Roosevelt in the group of foreign
statesmen deserving of praise and he has been cited as an example of
how U.S. presidents should treat the Soviet Union.
The Tass coverage of the anniversary of his death was unusual because
such tributes normally are reserved for figures from Soviet and Russian
history.
