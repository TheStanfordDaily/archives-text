# Israelis end pullout phase
## 
### 
NABATIYEH, Lebanon — The Israeli army
withdrew yesterday from this market town and the
hostile Shiite Moslem villages around it, and
hundreds of Lebanese streamed into the streets to
celebrate an end to nearly three years of Israeli oc
cupation.
"We are celebrating freedom," Mohammed
Mrouweh shouted over the din of chanting neigh
bors and honking horns on the town's main square.
"We want to tell the whole world that Lebanon
belongs to the Lebanese alone."
In the pullback, Israel relinquished control over
about 115 square miles of territory and between
60,000 and 70,000 people, the military command
in Tel Aviv said. About 772 square miles of south
Lebanon — a fifth of the country — still are occu
pied by Israeli soldiers, who invaded Lebanon in
June 1982.

Israeli military sources who spoke on condition
they not be identified said the pullback meant some
Israeli border settlements would again be within
range of guerrilla rockets.
The withdrawal was the second in a series that
began Feb. 16, when the Israelis left the southern
Lebanese port of Sidon.
The Israelis pulled back yesterday from villages
in an arc about 34 miles southeast of Beirut. Israeli
radio and televison quoted unidentified security
sources as saying that all troops would be back
home by June 6, the third anniversary of the Israeli
invasion.
Nabatiyeh became a hotbed of resistance after
Oct. 16, 1983, when an Israeli patrol drove into
town during a Shiite holy feast, an act that touched
off a riot.
Reports from Israel said attacks in the area per

sisted almost up to the troops' departure, with two
rockets being fired at an Israeli outpost overnight.
An Israeli major was killed by a mine in eastern
Lebanon, becoming the 647 th Israeli to die in
Lebanon since the invasion.
The withdrawal came on the eve of the seventh
day of Passover, an Israeli national holiday.
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin flew to
Nabatiyeh to watch the operation and told
reporters that there would be no permanent Israeli
presence in south Lebanon once withdrawal was
complete. He said Israeli-backed Lebanese
militiamen would protect the frontier.
Rabin warned on Israeli radio that any attacks on
Israel after the withdrawal would be treated more
severely than ambushes of Israel's occupation
force, which was attacked 230 times in south
Lebanon last month.
