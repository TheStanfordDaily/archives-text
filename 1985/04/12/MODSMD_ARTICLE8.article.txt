# Albania's Hoxha dies at 76
## 
### 
VIENNA, Austria — Enver Hoxha
of Albania, who fashioned a tiny
fortress of Stalinism in a world he
viewed as hostile, died yesterday at
age 76. He ruled for 42 years, longer
than any other communist leader.
Hoxha died of complications re
sulting from heart failure that oc
curred on Tuesday, the official Al
banian news agency ATA reported. It
said in a medical bulletin that the
Communist Party chief had suffered
from diabetes since 1948.
A period of mourning was decreed
until Thursday and Ramiz Alia, offi
cial head of state and Hoxha's likely
successor, was designated chairman
of the commission to arrange the fu
neral. Alia, 59, is said to have been a
close associate of Hoxha since the

19605. Alia has made most major
speeches and policy announcements
since taking over as head of state in
1982.
Hoxha gained power in 1943 as
leader of the Albanian partisans
fighting Italian and German occupa
tion troops. He stamped out religion
and all opponents, real and potential,
and made Albania a fortress of his
views, curtly dismissing allies with
whom he disagreed, regardless of the
cost in economic or military benefits.
Hoxha admired Josef Stalin, and
relations with the Soviet Union began
to sour after Stalin died in 1953.
When Nikita Khrushchev began
criticizing the late Soviet dictator,
Hoxha broke them completely.
He turned to China for technology
and other needs, finding a kindred

spirit in Mao Tse-tung. Then Mao
died, China began opening itself to
the West, and Hoxha formally
severed relations in 1978.
His view of Albania, which is about
the size of Maryland, made it unique
in many ways. No taxes are levied and
there are no private cars allowed.
Foreign travel by Albanians and visits
by foreigners are restricted more
tightly than in any other European
country. Hoxha rejected foreign
loans on grounds they would give
outsiders undue leverage.
Living standards now are higher
than ever before, although they
remain well below European norms
and few imported products are
available.
The war against religion by Hoxha,
son of a Moslem landowner, was most

intense in the 19605. Mosques and
churches were converted into public
buildings, warehouses and, according
to reports reaching the West, even
stables. Hoxha claimed later that his
was the only truly atheist nation in
the world.
His 42 years of rule represent the
longest period of independence in Al
bania's history, which is a story of
domination by Turkey, Italy and
various Balkan warlords.
The country conducts its affairs
secretly and communicates little with
the outside world. There have been
increased contacts with some West
ern countries recently but Albanian
diplomats, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said they expect the gen
eral attitude to continue.
