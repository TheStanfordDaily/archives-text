Shultz talks on economy
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State George
Shultz, continuing the administration's low-key
response to trade tensions with Japan, warned
yesterday against protectionism and said all U.S.
trading partners should work toward sustained
world economic growth.
"We — and other countries — share a respon
sibility to make some hard political decisions,"
the secretary of state said in a speech at Princeton
University, his alma mater. He called for reduc
ing global imbalances in trade, investment and
currencies.
Shultz, an economist, gave an address that was
partly a basic economics lesson and partly a
preview of the position President Reagan likely
will take next month at the seven-nation annual
economic summit in Bonn, West Germany.
Shultz warned against turning to protectionism
in the face of growing trade tensions, especially
moves in Congress and elsewhere to force Japan
to shrink its trade surplus.
"Protectionism is not the remedy to an ill
ness," Shultz said. "It is itself an illness. . . .
Protectionism keeps prices up, reduces living

standards and stifles growth."
He added, "We should not delude ourselves
into thinking that a lowering of foreign barriers
will have a decisive or even substantial impact on
the trade deficit."
The secretary of state continued, "We can
break the back of the trade deficit only through a
combination of, first, a stronger worldwide
recovery, and, second, a strengthening of other
currencies in relation to the dollar. .. . Even with
movement on these fronts, the effects on the
trade deficit will be gradual."
Fifth to get heart
LOUISVILLE, Ky. — A railroad engineer
from Illinois, the victim of a near-fatal heart at
tack in October, will become the world's fifth
recipient of a permanent artificial heart this
weekend, Humana Inc. announced yesterday.
The surgery was scheduled for 7 a.m. Sunday
after Jack Burcham of Le Roy, 111., signed a 17-
page consent form warning him and his family of
the procedure's experimental status and possible
dangers, including stroke.

Dr. William DeVries will lead Humana's surgi
cal team in its third implant since Nov. 25.
Surgeons will cut out Burcham's damaged nat
ural heart and replace it with a plastic-and-metal
Jarvik-7 heart. Two plastic tubes from the device
will be attached to a 323-pound compressor that
will drive the mechanical heart with puffs of air.
Three recipients of the Jarvik-7 are living, two
in Louisville and one in Sweden. Seattle dentist
Barney Clark, the first recipient of a permanent
artificial heart, survived 112 days after his im
plant on Dec. 2, 1982, at Salt Lake City.
Stock prices rise
Stock prices rose for the second straight ses
sion yesterday as interest rates tumbled in the
credit markets.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
about 8 points at its best level of the session,
closed with a 3.75 gain at 1,263.69. The average
climbed 6.08 points on Wednesday.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
reached 108.36 million shares, against 108.15
million the day before.
