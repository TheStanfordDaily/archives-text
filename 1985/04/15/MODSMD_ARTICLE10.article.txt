# NASA decides on space walk today
## Shuttle to move near satellite 
### 
CAPE CANAVERAL — NASA
officials decided yesterday to move
the space shuttle Discovery close to a
dead satellite, but postponed for a
day a decision on whether the
astronauts will take a risky, un
rehearsed space walk to bring it back
to life.
"We are not ruling out an EVA,"
Mission Control told the astronauts.
EVA is shorthand for Extra
Vehicular Activity — a space walk.
But officials decided not to use the
shuttle arm to bring an astronaut
within two feet of the slowly turning
Syncom satellite to pull a lever that
apparently failed to open when it was
launched Saturday.
If there were a space walk, the
switch might be pulled by an
astronaut using a tool from farther
away.
"The plan now is to do a rendez
vous and a photographic inspection
and we plan to do that on Tuesday,"

commander Karol Bobko was told.
Mission Contol said the exercise
might even come the following day.
When the Navy communications
satellite was ejected from the
shuttle's cargo bay, its electrical sys
tems failed to turn on, apparently be
cause the lever did not spring out.
"It is not known whether that lever
is partially extended or not extended
at all," Mission Control said.
Officials will continue to evaluate
options for tripping the switch, said
Mission Control's Bob Springer.
"We may elect to come up with a
procedure to attach something to the
RMS to be used remotely," Springer
added.
The new plan means the flight will
be extended by at least one day. That
probably would be the case anyway,
since weather at the Kennedy Space
Center is forecast to be bad on Wed
nesday.
After an intensive day of rehearsal

by space-suited astronauts on Earth
and discussions in several task forces,
a group of officials made their deci
sion in late afternoon. They plan to
meet again today to decide on the
space walk.
Mission Control told Bobko the
procedure for flipping the switch "has
been done numerous times already
.. . and it looks very do-able."
When that lever is opened, a timing
mechanism goes to work. It extends
the satellite's antenna after 80
seconds, starts its jets to produce a
fast spin after six minutes and fires
the Syncom's huge rocket engine
after 45 minutes.
Bobko was sent a detailed plan for
a rendezvous with the satellite — by
now about 50 miles in front of Dis
covery — and he said, "it looks pretty
reasonable." A space walk plan was
to be sent up later by radio-teletype.
The astronauts were told to reduce
their cabin pressure today, a normal

procedure a day before a space walk,
just in case the go-ahead is given.
Meanwhile, at the Johnson Space
Center in Houston, one group of
astronauts rehearsed ship-with
satellite rendezvous procedures, an
other was using a mockup shuttle
crane as a work platform, and a third
— in space suits — was trying various
tools to pull the lever on a whirling
target.
An interested observer of the deci
sion process was Sen. Jake Garn of
Utah, who is getting exactly the kind
of information he sought when he
signed aboard the flight as a congres
sional overseer. Garn, wired up with
electrodes and sensors on his head,
chest and stomach, was seen on
shuttle television for the first time
Sunday, explaining some of the medi
cal tests he was undergoing.
"You can see we are having a lot of
fun up here, trying to find out what
happens to the human body in zero-
G," he said.
