Cemetery visit debated
MIAMI BEACH, Fla. — The leader of the
Holocaust Memorial Council ancA Republican
senator yesterday urged President Reagan to
cancel his scheduled visit to a German military
cemetery where Nazis are buried.
"It's an outrage to honor those who, in 1944,
butchered American soldiers, who became a
symbol of cruelty, a symbol of inhumanity that
must be remembered forever," said Elie Wiesel,
a concentration camp survivor and chairman of
the holocaust council, whose 65 members were
appointed by the president.
"It's a bad idea, ill-conceived and ill-timed. I
feel that the president knows very little about
this," U.S. Sen. Paula Hawkins (R-Florida) said
at a news conference that she and Wiesel held.
American veterans and Jewish groups have
criticized Reagan's plans to honor German sol
diers killed while fighting Allied forces at the
"Battle of the Bulge" in 1944.
Also yesterday, Israel's Yad Vashem
Holocaust Memorial sent Reagan a cable urging
him to reconsider his decision to visit the war
cemetery.
"I think it is a mistake on his part that hurts the
victims of the Holocaust. It gives a certain
legitimacy to and rehabilitates Nazis," said
Yitzhak Arad, director of the Yad Vashem
Remembrance Authority.
Reagan is scheduled to lay a wreath at the Bit
burg military cemetery in West Germany during
his trip to Europe next month, but the outbreak
of criticism has prompted the White House to
reconsider the president's plans.
Presidential spokesman Larry Speakes has said
Reagan's schedule, including the Bitburg stop
May 5, is under review.

U.S. Sen. William Armstrong (R-Colo.) and
House Majority Leader James Wright (D-Texas)
yesterday discussed Reagan's trip to Germany on
the CBS network television show, "Face the Na
tion."
The congressmen suggested that Reagan add
to his itinerary trips in memory of people who
died in concentration camps and of Americans
killed in battle. The trip comes at a time when
holocaust survivors are marking the 40th an
niversary of the liberation of Nazi concentration
camps.
Soviets make offer
ATLANTA — Soviet Ambassador Anatoly
Dobrynin said Saturday his country might permit
on-site inspection of a radar installation to allay
U.S. concerns that the device was violating an
arms control agreement.
Dobrynin suggested the possibility of the in
spections during a panel discussion at a policy
center established by former President Jimmy
Carter, who said he was amazed at Dobrynin's
suggestion.
Carter called it "quite a departure" from pre
vious Soviet positions.
Carter said he checked with other Soviet
delegates to the session and was assured that
Dobrynin, who had to leave early, had intention
ally raised the prospect of on-site verification.
"I turned around and asked the Soviet delega
tion there, 'Does this mean that you would go
along with on-site inspection if that was neces
sary to determine the validity of a violation al
legation?' And they said, 'Yes, that's correct,
you've interpreted it correctly,"' he said at a
news conference.
"During our meeting when we were drafting

our recommendations, the Soviet delegation was
asked specifically, and they agreed that the state
ment by Dobrynin was accurate," said former
president Gerald Ford, a participant in the ses
sion and news conference.
Carter said he was "extremely gratified at the
forthcoming nature of the Soviet representation.
If their views mirror those that will be presented
at the negotiating table at (the arms control talks
in) Geneva, this will be very constructive."
Dobrynin's suggestion came in response to
comments from Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), who
said congressional concerns about possible Soviet
violations of existing arms agreements must be
addressed before Congress will accept a new
treaty.
AIDS found in monkeys
BOSTON — A virus almost identical to the
germ generally thought to cause AIDS has been
found in monkeys, and scientists believe it will
provide an important new tool for developing a
vaccine to control the epidemic of the fatal
disease.
The latest discovery also supports a theory that
AIDS began as a disease of monkeys and only
recently spread to people.
Scientists at the New England Regional
Primate Center identified the virus in macaque
monkeys. The animals were afflicted with
monkey AIDS, a disease that mirrors acquired
immune deficiency syndrome in people.
American experts believe that human AIDS is
caused by a virus called HTLV-111, for human T
cell lymphotropic virus type three, and they've
named the new monkey virus STLV-111, for
simians.
