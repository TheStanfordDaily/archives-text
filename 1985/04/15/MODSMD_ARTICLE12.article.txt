Pump prices rising
LOS ANGELES — Gasoline prices jumped 7
cents per gallon during the past two months, and
the upward trend will continue as wholesale
prices rise and the demand for unleaded gas
rivals supply, an analyst said yesterday.
"There's every indication that unleaded has to
climb some more," oil industry analyst Dan
Lundberg said. The price of unleaded could rise
by 10 cents per gallon next month to $1.26, he
said.
The average price nationally for all grades of
gasoline is $1.20 per gallon, Lundberg said. In
February, before retail prices began to respond
to rising wholesale costs, gas averaged $1.13 per
gallon for all grades.
A survey of 17,000 stations in all 50 states
compiled Saturday showed regular leaded
averaging $1.08 per gallon, regular unleaded
$1.16 per gallon and premium unleaded $1.28
per gallon. All prices are for self-serve.
Both regular leaded and unleaded gas rose 8
cents per gallon since Lundberg's Feb. 8 survey,
but he said it was more difficult to predict pump
prices for leaded.
"There is not only a glut of leaded gasoline,
but more and more leaded is being imported into
this country," he said.

The ratio of demand to inventories is out ofr
balance for leaded and unleaded, Lundberg said.
There is an oversupply of leaded gasoline, with
about 40 days of available supply on hand.
There is only a 15-day supply of unleaded
available, making up 40 percent of the gasoline
inventory, he said. The demand for unleaded,
however, is 60 percent of all grades of gasoline
sold.
Retailers are already having trouble getting all
the unleaded gas they want, Lundberg said.
Demand for unleaded also is expected to increase
when a phase-out of leaded gas begins July 1, he
said.
An Environmental Protection Agency law
takes effect on that date requiring the lead con
tent in gas to be decreased from 1.1 grams per
gallon to 0.5 grams, he said. A further decrease is
required by Jan. 1, 1986.
Despite the glut, leaded prices may increase if
pump prices for the different grades move in tan
dem as they traditionally have, Lundberg said.
Breathalyzers at prom?
ARCADIA — Students at Arcadia High
School's May 12 prom will be asked to submit to
a Breathalyzer test if they appear to be in
ebriated. the school board has decided.

"If we can save one life, it's worth it," district
Superintendent Elbert Souders said last week of
the decision, aimed at curbing alcohol abuse
among prom-goers.
Chaperones trained to use the Breathalyzer,
which measures alcohol levels by analyzing an in
dividual's breath, will ask students who appear
drunk to take the test, Souders said.
If it comes up positive, they'll be detained
while school officials call their parents to come
get them, he said. They may also be suspended.
The prom will be held in Anaheim, about 40
miles south of Arcadia.
Souders said the district was sending letters
home to parents about the Breathalyzer, which
was purchased by a parent group opposed to drug
abuse.
Alcohol abuse is the district's No. 1 drug prob
lem, he added.
Today's weather
Much cooler today. Low overcast with possible
drizzle in the morning. Partial clearing in the af
ternoon. Temperatures in the 60s to low 70s.
Mostly cloudy tonight and tomorrow with possi
ble drizzle. Lows in the upper 40s to low 50s.
Highs in the upper 50s and 60s.
