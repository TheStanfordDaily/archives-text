# New internship program opened at Berlin campus
## 
### JASON COLE Editorial staff 
Beginning next winter quarter,
humanities and social science intern
ships will be offered to students at
tending the overseas campus in Ber
lin. Sponsored by the Krupp Founda
tion, the program is an addition to the
engineering and science internship
currently available.
According to Mark Mancall, direc
tor of Overseas Studies, the intern
ships will "provide excellent opportu
nities for humanities students in an
active social environment."
Two types of internships will be
available to students. The first type
will be internships in business and
government. Students will enroll at
Stanford in Berlin during winter
quarter and then stop out from Stan
ford during spring quarter, when they
will be placed with a company or
agency. Students will not be able to
receive academic credit for the work
experience.
The second type will be internships
as research associates in humanities.
Like the first one, students will enroll
in Berlin winter quarter and stop out
in spring when they receive research
positions. Unlike the first program,
with proper arrangements students
can receive academic credit.
The structure of the new program
is based on the 3-year-old engineer
ing and science program, which also
requires one quarter of study at the
Berlin Center, followed by a three
to six-month internship. According to
Mancall, his office has been trying to
develop this program for some time.
Students are required to complete
at least two quarters of German lang
uage before going to Berlin. Students
are paid a living stipend of 1,500
DM a month during the internship
program.
"Science and engineering are so
favored at Stanford in every way,
we've wanted to develop some altern
ative for humanities students," Man
call said.
The internships will range from
management positions available in
business to opportunities working in
the arts or for political parties. "Since
this is very new, we'll try to tailor the
search for internships to what stu
dents want," Mancall said.
Mancall said he thinks the environ
ment alone would be well worth

taking an internship. "Berlin is a
'world' city. Many people consider it
the Paris of today, where artists gath
er and the political life is very ac
tive," he said.
During the quarter spent at the

Berlin Center, students must take
German language classes. The
curriculum includes classes in German
history, political science and culture.
Applications for the program are due
by May 25.

Director of Overseas Study Mark Mancall has been trying to establish
an internship program for Humanities and Sciences students for quite
some time. The new program will augment the current one, which is
primarily for engineering students.
