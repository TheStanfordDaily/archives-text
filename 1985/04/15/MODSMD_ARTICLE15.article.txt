That we inadvertantly omitted Stanford-in-
Government in Friday's list of endorsements is in
no way indicative of our feelings toward the
group. Sio offers several useful services to sm- Constitutional Amendments
dents, services which would be severely reduced —
should SiG not get its fee assessment. In addition
to serving as a clearinghouse for information on Constitutional Amendment 9
summer internships in Washington, D.C., SiG Capital fee
has sponsored an outstanding series of speakers Recommendation* NO

for its money and deserves a YES vote. „ ... a .
