## GLAS protecting gay community 
### 
The Gay and Lesbian Alliance at
Stanford (GLAS) Steering Commit
tee is concerned about the media
response to the "tea room" issue.
When I asked one local reporter not
to print the locations of the "tea
rooms," she claimed that her paper
was doing a public service by notify-

VIEWPOINT

ing people of areas they might wish to
avoid. This may be true, but in addi
tion. her efforts may well attract
homophobic individuals who would
attempt to stop the "tea room" activ
ity in their own primitive, but unfor
tunately effective, way.
All men who use campus restrooms
should be concerned about this. For
just as gay men are not always capa
ble of differentiating between straight
men and other gay men. homophobes
are not always capable of differentiat
ing between potential victims who are
in fact gay and those who are not.
GLAS places the protection of all
members of the Stanford community

from violence above preventing
anyone from merely being annoyed.
The general tone of the media
coverage is also problematic: It could
mislead one about the actual inten
tions of the GLAS Steering Commit
tee. We do not regard ourselves as
the "nice homosexuals" up in the Old
Firehouse opposed to the "nasty per
verts" down in the subterranean
bathrooms. Gay people — however
"nice" — cannot afford to draw such
distinctions in a society that continues
to deny our basic civil rights.
Nor is the GLAS Steering Commit
tee.taking orders from the police, as
the press has implied. Protests follow
ing the 1980 arrests at Stanford pres
sured the police into accepting a pro
posal from representatives of the gay
community to post flyers in the
future; the police are simply continu
ing with this agreement. We are com
mitted to taking further measures to
prevent police intervention should
they decide to begin making arrests.
GLAS feels it is never appropriate
to handle this issue with arrests. Be

cause most of these people are not
openly gay, the publicity following an
arrest for this "crime" can have par
ticularly catastrophic consequences:
divorce, loss of job, loss of standing in
the community. The punishment in
flicted by the media response for
merely being charged with this
nuisance is out of proportion with the
act, and is impossible to rectify once
the damage is done.
GLAS does not take a stand on the
propriety of "tea room" activity. We
simply feel that people should not be
arrested and subjected to the ordeal
that follows an arrest for an activity
that at worst constitutes a public
nuisance. It never has been and never
shall be the GLAS Steering Commit
tee's business to pass moral judg
ment; it is our business to prevent the
unnecessary arrests and persecution
of our gay and lesbian brothers and
sisters.
