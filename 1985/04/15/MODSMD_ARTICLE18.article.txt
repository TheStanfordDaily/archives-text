"Oh my God," she said, as she looked at her grades for
the first quarter and realized that life was not a fairy tale
filled with As. "What have I done?" she asked as she
shuffled back to her dorm for the last time and awoke
from her fantastic dream of money and boys and spring
and friends and abstract emotions like happiness and
things and things and other things. "What have you
done?" said Daddy on the phone from Wall Street, who
only wants his baby to be happy and successful and rich
like Daddy, "Oh, my baby." "Oh my God," they say,
"she was so young."

Last Tuesday night I sat alone in a McDonald's with a
Quarter Pounder, large fries and a chocolate milkshake,
and a guilty feeling. I felt guilty about an inane comment I
had made about somebody earlier that afternoon— it was
an elitist, egotistical, I'm-better-than-him type comment.
The person to whom I directed my comment responded
appropriately to my stupidity with a disapproving frown. I
had expected a giggle, and when I received the opposite I
was shocked. But I recognized how foolish I had been.
So there I sat in a plastic McDonald's booth staring
sadly into my milkshake and feeling sorry for myself.
Then I looked up. I watched a man, a McDonald's em
ployee, as he wiped off a table. The man was at least 40,
he looked stupid, he moved to the next table. He must be
retarded, I thought. His face was a simple expression of
concentration, and it made him look as if he belonged in a
Norman Rockwell painting. I thought about what a failure

this man's life had been — working in a McDonald's as a
floor person with no responsibility, no future. I was about
to chuckle to myself about this unfortunate lot in life when
I saw the disapproving frown of my friend glaring at me.
My God, I thought, I am doing it again.
I opened my eyes. The old man shed his image, and he
became a beautifully innocent human being. He had a
content smile always on his lips. And he was proud. How,
then, was I better than he?
My eyes left the man to his work, and I looked around
the McDonald's. I saw two construction workers dirty and
tired. Human beings. I saw a nicely dressed lady snacking
on her Chicken McNuggets. A human being. I saw a
group of children from a local hospital with their parents.
All human beings. "How had I lost contact with all these
people?" I thought.
I concluded that some values become distorted in our
college environment. The elements that begin to take con
trol of our lives shouldn't be — grades, career progres
sion, money. We inflate the importance of these objects
because here at school they are the yardsticks of our suc
cess. We measure ourselves against scales that really
shouldn't matter, and in this measuring process we lose
contact with sure, important values. Like compassion. We
compare ourselves to others instead of appreciating
others. Ultimately, one will not measure as high as an
other, and what then?
I looked up from my table and again looked around the
room. Everyone, so beautiful in his own right, looked
possessed as he rammed his hamburgers down his
throat. Hurry, Eat. Run. Race. Win. Except for the aged
employee, and except for a little girl sitting next to her
vulturous father. She was looking around the restaurant as
I was, and she was no doubt wondering what was wrong
beneath all those constricted faces. She looked at me, and
when I smiled she quickly turned away. How sad, 1
thought. Soon she too will be sucked into this lost world.
A beautiful girl and so very young.
