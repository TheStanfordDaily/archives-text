Jumping the fence
The ASSU Elections Handbook
lists me as an opponent of the Tues
day Films request for a fee assess
ment; I want to make it known that I
am now a wholehearted supporter of
the Tuesday Films.
I used to object to the film series'
failure to charge admission. Then I
found out that film rental is cheaper
if the film is shown for free than if
the film is shown commercially.
Therefore, a free film series makes
sense. Furthermore, most of the
films are not even released commer
cially.
I would like to respond to two
attacks that my esteemed colleague,
Jim McGrath, makes against the film
series in his statement in the elec
tions pamphlet. First, McGrath
makes the unsubstantiated claim that
the films are "disproportionately
attended by faculty and staff." It just
isn't true. In fact, three surveys show
that 99 percent of the film series'
audience is composed of students.
McGrath also claims that the
series relies unnecessarily "upon
services provided by (University)

Events and Services." Yet he never
brought this point up while the sen
ate was deciding to put the film
series on the ballot and to give it a
positive recommendation. Why
didn't he make his point to the sen
ate? Because it just isn't true, and
McGrath knows that it isn't. In fact,
the University requires Tuesday
Films to have its films projected by a
technician supplied by Events and
Services; thus the expenses that
McGrath objects to are completely
necessary.

Don't credit a clock
How dare Mark Zeigler take
credit away from the Stanford bas
ketball team for its inspirational
victory over USC at Maples Pavilion
in February in his analysis piece,
"Will the shot clock rule destroy the
college game?" (The Daily, April 5).
Stanford did not win because there
was no shot clock. They won because
they were the best team on the floor
that night. They won because un
requited Andy Fischer scored inside

and outside, Keith Ramee and
Novian Whitsitt outplayed the
vaunted USC guards and because
Kent Seymour blew past Pac-10
MVP Wayne Carlander for a three
point play when USC was trying to
get back into the game. They took it
at USC, they didn't sit on it.
Stanford scored more than 50
points in the second half that night.
Is that the kind of slowdown game
that allows big upsets?
What is wrong with the best team
winning, anyway? Aren't sports
about doing your best? If it's upsets
that we want, we should make the
first team that makes two in a row
from half court the winner. Then the
winner would be random and we
would have unknowns beating big
powers all the time.
As for the clock taking away from
coaching, most of a coach's job is
preparing his team in practice. Now
coaches will have to prepare their
teams to play 40 minutes of basket
ball, not five minutes of basketball
and 35 minutes of "dribble around in
circles."
