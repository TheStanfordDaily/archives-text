# Cal zealot fakes Axe theft story
## 
### JASON COLE Editorial staff 
For some weeks now the Axe has been missing
from its case in Tresidder Union. Most passing
students don't take too much notice of its ab
sence, except to say, "They're probably out fixing
it." The students then walk away, blissfully ig
norant.
But last week, a UC-Berkeley student tried to
strike fear in hearts of Stanford students and
create glee among his comrades. For a while he
managed to raise a few eyebrows and, in the end,
probably made most everybody smile or chuckle.
Ken Raust, a 24-year-old graduate student in
Berkeley's Forestry Department and a member
of the UC Rally Committee, tried to capitalize on
the current low profile of the Axe by writing a se
ries of fictitious letters to the San Francisco Ex
aminer and The Daily Californian, Berkeley's
student-run paper.
In the letters, Raust claimed to be both a group
called "Friends of Oski" and Stanford Athletic
Director Andy Geiger while explaining that the
Axe had been missing for almost a month.
Raust's letter to the Examiner said:
// Stanford students are wondering why they
haven't seen the Axe for a while, it's because they

don't even know where it is!
This is to inform everyone that the Axe has
'come home' to Berkeley and is in safe hands.
Our demands for its return are fair and simple.
Once the following conditions are met, we will
gladly turn it over to the farm boys:
1. That all charges be dropped against us;
2. That we get a picture of all of us with the Axe
on the cover of The Stanfurd Daily when it is

returned; and
3. That Stanfurd change its nickname from the
Cardinal to 7 rees or Redwoods.
Until that rime, you can rest assured that we
won't catch he "butterfingeritis" that our coun
terparts are offering from!
Go Bears!.
Friends of Oski.

with an Examiner article on Cal's alleged Axe heist.
