# Cal zealot fakes Axe theft story
## 
### JASON COLE Editorial staff 
For some weeks now the Axe has been missing
from its case in Tresidder Union. Most passing
students don't take too much notice of its ab
sence, except to say, "They're probably out fixing
it." The students then walk away, blissfully ig
norant.
But last week, a UC-Berkeley student tried to
strike fear in hearts of Stanford students and
create glee among his comrades. For a while he
managed to raise a few eyebrows and, in the end,
probably made most everybody smile or chuckle.
Ken Raust, a 24-year-old graduate student in
Berkeley's Forestry Department and a member
of the UC Rally Committee, tried to capitalize on
the current low profile of the Axe by writing a se
ries of fictitious letters to the San Francisco Ex
aminer and The Daily Californian, Berkeley's
student-run paper.
In the letters, Raust claimed to be both a group
called "Friends of Oski" and Stanford Athletic
Director Andy Geiger while explaining that the
Axe had been missing for almost a month.
Raust's letter to the Examiner said:
// Stanford students are wondering why they
haven't seen the Axe for a while, it's because they

don't even know where it is!
This is to inform everyone that the Axe has
'come home' to Berkeley and is in safe hands.
Our demands for its return are fair and simple.
Once the following conditions are met, we will
gladly turn it over to the farm boys:
1. That all charges be dropped against us;
2. That we get a picture of all of us with the Axe
on the cover of The Stanfurd Daily when it is

returned; and
3. That Stanfurd change its nickname from the
Cardinal to 7 rees or Redwoods.
Until that rime, you can rest assured that we
won't catch he "butterfingeritis" that our coun
terparts are offering from!
Go Bears!.
Friends of Oski.

Axe Committee members Michael Tuchin, Scott Martin and Whitney Haggins pose with the
Axe for San Francisco Examiner photographer Haruko. Haruko's photo appeared yesterday
with an Examiner article on Cal's alleged Axe heist.
He then sent two letters, both writ
ten on Stanford Athletic Department
stationery, allegedly written by
Geiger to The Daily Cal. The first
asked for the cooperation of The
Daily Cal in recovering the Axe.
The second letter was a copy of a
supposed request to all living groups
(dorms, fraternities, sororities and
co-ops) to help in the effort to
recover the Axe.
Raust, a fourth generation Cal stu
dent whose great-grandfather bought
an axe identical to the Axe way back
in 1898, got the idea after stopping at
Tresidder a couple of times and not
finding the Axe there. "It hasn't been
there since about February, and each

time I was there a couple of people
would come by and say 'Cal probably
stole it,' " he said.
From that sprang the idea to carry
out those statements as far as they
could go. "I figured that if the
(Stanford) Axe Committee couldn't
get to it for a couple of days, then
everybody would get suspicious and
the rumors would get going," he said.
Unfortunately for Raust, his plot
was a little ill-timed. According to
University Editor Peggy Spear, The
Daily Cal received the "Geiger" let
ters on Wednesday. "We were pretty
busy with the protest (the Sproul
Plaza sit-in protesting UC-Berkeley's
investment policies) and couldn't get
on it right away," she said.
But even worse, the Stanford Axe
Committee was about to take the Axe
out of hiding. On Thursday night, the
committee paraded it through dorms

in an effort to rally support for its fee
assessment request in the ASSU elec
tions which begin tomorrow.
Thus, when an Examiner reporter
called Axe Committee Staff Adviser
Jon Erickson about the story, he had
ample proof of the Axe's safety. Just
to be sure, members of the committee
had a picture of them holding the Axe
taken on Friday by an Examiner
photographer.
Other clues, such as the fact that
Geiger signs all his letters with his full
first name, Ferdinand, and not just
Andy, made it readily apparent that
the whole thing was a hoax.
Which didn't really bother Raust.
"1 expected it to go one way or an
other. Either it could be really inter
esting and exciting for a couple of
days until they produced the Axe, or
it wouldn't go anywhere," he said
without much disappointment.
