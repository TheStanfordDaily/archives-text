# The
						sad story of The Daily Features Editors:
## 
### 
There used to be a time, not so long ago, that Mary Yuh
and Jason Cole led serene and happy lives. Yes, once in a
while they would stay up late at the office, and, more often
than not, they would be behind. But basically things went
well for them.

But then one week, they were
left with few stories and even
fewer writers. Soon, Jason
began to look old and gray, and
Mary, once the personification
of the expression "Mandarin
Flower," became mean and
nasty.

So now, these two editors are making a plea for help. Save
them from the rigors of age and anger. Come write a
feature story for The Daily.
