## Card blows up, then blows out Arizona 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
A warning to the UCLA Bruins: If you come here and
win the opener of next weekend's series on Friday,
prepare to withstand a Cardinal avalanche.
Arizona was able to squeak out a tough 7-5 win Friday,
but Stanford came back to bury the Wildcats 20-8 on Sat
urday and 11-1 yesterday.
Earlier in the season, USC opened a series at Sunken
Diamond with a 6-5 victory, and Stanford's revenge was
quick and harsh. The Cardinal pounded the Trojan pitch
ing staff for 30 runs in the next two games, 15-4 and 15-5.
This weekend's Arizona series had a little bit of every
thing. There was a lot of good hitting, some good pitching,
some brilliant defense, some awful defense, some ejec
tions, a bench-clearing brawl and one frightening injury.
Yesterday's game was by far the calmest of the three.
The Cardinal jumped ahead early and rode the nine-hit
pitching of Jack McDowell to the win.
With the score 1-0, the Cardinal chased Wildcat starter
Dave Carley with a four-run second. After Walt Harris
and John Ramos pulled off a double steal, John Verducci
drove them both home with a single to center. Walks to
Pete Stanicek and Mark Davis loaded the bases and
brought on reliever Joe Estes. Rick Lundblade greeted
him with a two-run single that made the score 5-0.
The onslaught continued in the fourth. Stanicek singled
and went to second on a perfect bunt single by Ruben
Amaro. Davis then smoked an RBI double off the lett
field fence. After Lundblade was intentionally walked,
Mike Deßenon put Stanford ahead 8-0 with a two-run
single that hit Estes' glove and caromed into left.
The Cardinal went to the long ball in the fifth to finish
its scoring. Ramos hit his seventh homer of the year — his
third against the Wildcats — to get the inning started. 'I wo
batters later, Stanicek launched his third homer of the
season to left-center.
Mark Machtolf followed Stanicek's homer with one of
his own — a scorching rocket over the center-field fence.
Although he is often used as a defensive replacement in
the late innings, Machtolf doesn't get too many opportu
nities at the plate.

'"1 come in to play defense late in the game, and I enjoy
that. It's my job," Machtolf said. "But everybody wants to
hit."
McDowell wasn't threatened again until the eighth.
With men on second and first and one out, Joe O'Donnell
hit a sharp ground ball that seemed destined for center
field. However, Verducci dove to his left, smothered the
ball and flipped it to Stanicek, who caught it bare-handed
and threw to Lundblade for a thrilling double play.
"If you stick around and watch him play, there's none
better," Stanford Coach Mark Marquess said of Verducci.
McDowell lost his shutout in the ninth on a homer by
Mike Serine, but still picked up his seventh win of the
year. "It (the pitch to Senne) was a mistake," McDowell
said. "I was really trying to push the shutout."
"He's getting better every time out," Marquess said.
"There's not a better young pitcher in the country."
Saturday's game was a wild one, to say the least. After
five innings, the Wildcats owned a 5-4 lead largely be
cause of a two-run double by Todd Trafton and a homer
by Dave Shermet. The Cardinal threatened in every in
ning, but couldn't deliver the knockout punch to Wildcat
starter Joe Magrane.
The punch was delivered in the sixth in the form of 13
runs and nine hits. After Verducci walked and Stanicek
singled, Amaro drove in a run with a fielder's choice that
brought Derek Huenneke to the mound. Shortstop
Tommy Hinzo threw Davis' grounder away, and then the
roof fell in.
Lundblade doubled off the left-field fence to score a
run. After RBI singles by Harris and Cook, Ramos sliced
a three-run triple down the right-field line. Verducci sin
gled Ramos in, and Davis drove the ninth run of the in
ning across with another single.
Huenneke, who gave up nine runs and retired only one
batter, then left to a standing ovation from the Stanford
fans behind the Arizona dugout. John Green came on and
was greeted by a three-run homer to left-center by
Lundblade. After another run scored, Ramos mercifully
ended the inning with a ground out.

Stanford catcher John Ramos got to see what it's like on the other side of a home-plate collision yesterday, as
he scored what turned out to be the game-winning run in the second.
It was now 17-5, and the game could have ended peace
fully. But it didn't.
In the eighth, Lundblade was drilled in the shoulder by
a fastball from Green. The 6-5, 230-pound first baseman
was not pleased and decided to show his displeasure by
charging the mound. Both benches emptied, but no
serious blows were struck.
"The only thing I can do is protect myself," the usually
mild-mannered Lundblade said, adding, "Nobody ever
wins a baseball fight. It usually becomes like big-time
wrestling."
The beneficiary of the Cardinal offensive explosion was
Rob Wassenaar. After surrenderring five early runs, Was
senaar held the Wildcats during the middle innings, allow
ing his teammates to come back.
"I started to get all my pitches over," Wassenaar said.
"The big thing is that I was more aggressive."
"He kept us in the game until we got our engines
going," Ramos said.
Stanford never got its engines going on Friday. Al
though they struck out 12 times, the Arizona hitters
managed 15 hits off Jeff Ballard and Rick Diet/.. The
Wildcats also got impressive relief performances from Jim
McDonald and Estes.
Trafton put Arizona ahead 2-0 in the first with a two
run double down the left-field line, but Stanford also got
two runs in its half of the inning on an RBI single by Davis
and a fielder's choice by Lundblade.
The Wildcats regained the lead in the second on a
homer by Shermet but lost pitching ace Mike Young in
the bottom of the inning.
Leading off, Cook hit a wicked line drive that caught
Young directly in the face. Young suffered a fractured
arch and will undergo surgery later this week. He was
rushed to Stanford Medical Center and will remain there
for at least a week. He will have X-rays taken today to de
termine exactly what needs to be done.
After the Cardinal tied the game in the third, Ballard
and McDonald dominated the middle innings. Ballard had
nine strikeouts for the day, and McDonald was assisted by
three double plays.
Arizona broke through in the eighth. After Chip Hale
and Senne singled, Ballard made a fine play to get the lead
runner on a bunt by Trafton. He then struck out Gar Mil
lay, but pinch-hitter Murray Hicks drove a 2-0 pitch into
the left-center field gap for a two-run double.
The Wildcats added a disputed run in the inning to
make the score 6-3. After Chuck Johnson struck out on a
low pitch, the umpire signaled out and the Cardinal left
the field.
However, Arizona Coach Jerry Kindall came running
down from the third-base coaching box, telling Johnson to
run to first. He then argued that the ball had hit the
ground and that Johnson had not been tagged. The home
plate umpire asked the first-base umpire, who ruled
Johnson safe at first.
Marquess shot out of the Cardinal dugout, protesting
that because the home-plate umpire had signaled out, the
umpire at first should never have been consulted.
Marquess was not as successful as Kindall had been.
Both he and Asst. Coach Dean Stotz were ejected.
The extra out gave Shermet a chance to drive in the
third run of the inning with a single. "It (the call) didn't
help, but it didn't beat us," Stotz said. "They buried us in
the hit column."
Back-to-back homers by Amaro and Davis got Stan
ford to within one, but Estes replaced McDonald and shut
the Cardinal down in the eighth and ninth, picking up his
seventh save.
The two wins enabled Stanford to keep its two-game
lead in the Pacific 10 Southern Division.

Arizona ace Mike Young's encounter with a vicious Toi Cook line drive Friday will keep him
in the Stanford Medical Center for at least a week.

Stanford Coach Mark Marquess discovered to his frustration Friday that Pac-10 umpires do
change their calls — they just don't change them twice.
