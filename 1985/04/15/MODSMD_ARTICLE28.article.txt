# Gates, Eldredge clinch netters' 5-4 victory in Texas
## Stanford nips USC, wins title 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
AUSTIN, Texas — The man who is perhaps
the Stanford women's tennis team's biggest fan is a
fellow named Jim Hopkins. Hopkins likes the
Cardinal netters because they win, and he loves
them when they beat USC.
Hopkins, who had business in Texas last week,
detoured here to see his favorite team play in the
invitation-only Longhorn-Kaepa Tennis Classic, a
three-day tournament featuring eight of the na
tion's top 10 teams.
And in the tournament, Hopkins got his way.
Second-ranked Stanford won three matches. And
yesterday the Cardinal beat No. 1 USC, 5-4, to win
ftie tournament title.
Moments after the Cardinal won the final point
of the final doubles match, Hopkins walked on the
court where Stanford's Linda Gates and Alyce
Werdel had just pulled out a three-setter to clinch
the match.
He hugged Gates and Werdel, then he shook
Coach Frank Brennan's hand firmly and said,
"That's all I live for is to beat those bastards."
There might not be too many bastards on USC's
women's tennis team, but you can be sure there's
no love lost between Hopkins and USC.
The same can be said of the Cardinal netters and
their Trojan counterparts. USC ended Stanford's
40-match win streak with a 5-4 victory in Los An
geles last month, so motivation for Stanford in yes
terday's rematch was plain, old-fashioned revenge.
"It feels great to beat USC," Gates said as the
No. 2-ranked Cardinal improved its overall record

to 21-1. "I think this will build our confidence a
lot."
What made Stanford's performance in the tourn
ament so commendable was not that it beat the
Trojans and halted their 26-match win streak in the
tournament final. It was that the Cardinal even got
to the final.
Stanford beat fifth-ranked Miami (Fla.) 7-2 in
Friday's first round, then trounced No. 3 Texas in
the semifinals, a match in which the doubles were
postponed until yesterday morning due to a sudden
rainstorm Saturday. And the Cardinal was the un
derdog in both matches. Stanford had two of its top
eight netters at home and a third was only available
for doubles.
Freshman Anna Ivan, the nation's fourth-ranked
singles player, who woke up Wednesday morning
with a bad virus, and Cari Hagey, who has an
injured shoulder, both missed the trip. Gates, the
senior team captain, came along, but tendinitis in
her left knee limited her to doubles action only.
"I'm really surprised," Brennan said of winning
the first-place trophy, a wood plaque in the shape
of Texas. "I probably shouldn't say that, but I
really can. It was a really good gut-check for us at
this point in the season with so many key players
missing. We had great performances from
everybody."
Indeed he did. Heroines abounded all weekend,
with three of the more unlikely ones stealing the
show yesterday.
With the singles portion of the Stanford-USC
contest knotted at 3-3, the issue would be decided
in doubles. The Trojans went ahead 4-3 when

Cecilia Fernandez and Heliane Steden downed
Patty Fendick and Leigh Anne Eldredge, 6-3, 6-3,
at No. 1.
Literally seconds later, Stephanie Savides and
Kay Tittle evened the score by polishing off Mary
Norwood and Stephainie Harges, 6-2, 6-4, at No.
3. Now the match hung in the balance at No. 2
doubles, where USC's Dena Levy and Claudia
Hernandez had just taken the second set and sent it
into a third.
The final set stayed even until Gates and Werdel
broke serve to go in front 5-4. The Cardinal pair
made it triple game-set-match point when Gates
reeled off three overpowering serves. The Trojans
came back to make it 3-2, but Gates served up an
other big one, Hernandez returned it high, and
Werdel ripped a backhand volley which Levy put
into the net.
"I was a little uneasy because in my singles match
I didn't play very well," said Werdel, who lost 6-2,
6-0 at No. 5 singles. "1 wasn't all there mentally,
and I was worried that might happen in doubles."
It didn't, even though Werdel had played
doubles with Gates only one other time this season.
"If I had to play with anybody," Werdel said, "I'd
be most comfortable with Linda because I know
her the best. We're roommates."
Yesteday's other heroine was Kay Tittle. The Ir
ving, Texas, native won twice yesterday and was
the only Cardinal to finish the tournament with a
perfect 6-0 record.

Team captain Linda Gates, hobbled by tendinitis in her left knee,
powered three service winners in the final game of the tournament to
lead Stanford to a 5-4 victory over USC.
"I felt at home in the sense that I
played my last two section tourna
ments here," Tittle said. "I also had
lots of friends and family here."
USC Coach Dave Borelli attrib
uted Tittle with winning the key
match of the day by posting a 7-6, 6-3
victory at No. 4 singles over Hernan
dez, who had defeated Tittle in
straight sets twice earlier this season.
Behind 6-5 in the first set and 3-0 in
the 12th game, Tittle staved off four
set points and forced a tiebreaker,
which she won 7-2.
With Gates and Ivan out of the
singles lineup, Fendick moved into
the No. 1 spot and Eldredge into No.
2, and both rose to the occasion.
Fendick left little doubt who will be
the player to beat at next month's
NCAA singles championship, as she
beat 22nd-ranked Lise Gregory of
Miami, sixth-ranked Steden of USC
and No. 1-ranked Beverly Bowes of
Texas — all in straight sets. Eldredge
was rock solid at No. 2, winning all
three of her singles matches, two of

them in straight sets.
But the big story of the tournament
for Stanford wsa sophomore Steph
anie Savides, who was having prob
lems winning at No. 5 and now was
forced to play No. 3.
Savides, however, quickly let it be
known that whatever slump she was
in was over when she defeated
Miami's Ros Riach, the nation's
19th-ranked player, 7-6, 6-1, Friday
afternoon. Brennan called it"the
match of her collegiate career."
Brennan entered the tournament
hoping the rain that wiped out most
of Thursday's practice time would
continue and wash away the tourna
ment as well. With an undermanned
squad, Brennan was wary of slipping
in the rankings, upon which the
NCAA tournament seedings are
based.
Instead, he got rain only late Satur
day afternoon, and the Cardinal
hardly slipped in the rankings.
So is Stanford No. 1? "I think so,"
Brennan said. "[USC] beat us and
they deserved to be No. 1. Now we
beat them on a neutral court, so ..

really can. It was a really good gut-check for us at
this point in the season with so many key players
missing. We had great performances from
everybody."
Indeed he did. Heroines abounded all weekend,
with three of the more unlikely ones stealing the
show yesterday.
With the singles portion of the Stanford-USC
contest knotted at 3-3, the issue would be decided
in doubles. The Trojans went ahead 4-3 when

Cecilia Fernandez and Heliane Steden downed
Patty Fendick and Leigh Anne Eldredge, 6-3, 6-3,
at No. 1.
Literally seconds later, Stephanie Savides and
Kay Tittle evened the score by polishing off Mary
Norwood and Stephainie Harges, 6-2, 6-4, at No.
3. Now the match hung in the balance at No. 2
doubles, where USC's Dena Levy and Claudia
Hernandez had just taken the second set and sent it
into a third.
The final set stayed even until Gates and Werdel
broke serve to go in front 5-4. The Cardinal pair
made it triple game-set-match point when Gates
reeled off three overpowering serves. The Trojans
came back to make it 3-2, but Gates served up an
other big one, Hernandez returned it high, and
Werdel ripped a backhand volley which Levy put
into the net.
"I was a little uneasy because in my singles match
I didn't play very well," said Werdel, who lost 6-2,
6-0 at No. 5 singles. "1 wasn't all there mentally,
and I was worried that might happen in doubles."
It didn't, even though Werdel had played
doubles with Gates only one other time this season.
"If I had to play with anybody," Werdel said, "I'd
be most comfortable with Linda because I know
her the best. We're roommates."
Yesteday's other heroine was Kay Tittle. The Ir
ving, Texas, native won twice yesterday and was
the only Cardinal to finish the tournament with a
perfect 6-0 record.

Team captain Linda Gates, hobbled by tendinitis in her left knee,
powered three service winners in the final game of the tournament to
lead Stanford to a 5-4 victory over USC.
"I felt at home in the sense that I
played my last two section tourna
ments here," Tittle said. "I also had
lots of friends and family here."
USC Coach Dave Borelli attrib
uted Tittle with winning the key
match of the day by posting a 7-6, 6-3
victory at No. 4 singles over Hernan
dez, who had defeated Tittle in
straight sets twice earlier this season.
Behind 6-5 in the first set and 3-0 in
the 12th game, Tittle staved off four
set points and forced a tiebreaker,
which she won 7-2.
With Gates and Ivan out of the
singles lineup, Fendick moved into
the No. 1 spot and Eldredge into No.
2, and both rose to the occasion.
Fendick left little doubt who will be
the player to beat at next month's
NCAA singles championship, as she
beat 22nd-ranked Lise Gregory of
Miami, sixth-ranked Steden of USC
and No. 1-ranked Beverly Bowes of
Texas — all in straight sets. Eldredge
was rock solid at No. 2, winning all
three of her singles matches, two of

them in straight sets.
But the big story of the tournament
for Stanford wsa sophomore Steph
anie Savides, who was having prob
lems winning at No. 5 and now was
forced to play No. 3.
Savides, however, quickly let it be
known that whatever slump she was
in was over when she defeated
Miami's Ros Riach, the nation's
19th-ranked player, 7-6, 6-1, Friday
afternoon. Brennan called it"the
match of her collegiate career."
Brennan entered the tournament
hoping the rain that wiped out most
of Thursday's practice time would
continue and wash away the tourna
ment as well. With an undermanned
squad, Brennan was wary of slipping
in the rankings, upon which the
NCAA tournament seedings are
based.
Instead, he got rain only late Satur
day afternoon, and the Cardinal
hardly slipped in the rankings.
So is Stanford No. 1? "I think so,"
Brennan said. "[USC] beat us and
they deserved to be No. 1. Now we
beat them on a neutral court, so ..
AUSTIN, Texas — The man who is perhaps
the Stanford women's tennis team's biggest fan is a
fellow named Jim Hopkins. Hopkins likes the
Cardinal netters because they win, and he loves
them when they beat USC.
Hopkins, who had business in Texas last week,
detoured here to see his favorite team play in the
invitation-only Longhorn-Kaepa Tennis Classic, a
three-day tournament featuring eight of the na
tion's top 10 teams.
And in the tournament, Hopkins got his way.
Second-ranked Stanford won three matches. And
yesterday the Cardinal beat No. 1 USC, 5-4, to win
ftie tournament title.
Moments after the Cardinal won the final point
of the final doubles match, Hopkins walked on the
court where Stanford's Linda Gates and Alyce
Werdel had just pulled out a three-setter to clinch
the match.
He hugged Gates and Werdel, then he shook
Coach Frank Brennan's hand firmly and said,
"That's all I live for is to beat those bastards."
There might not be too many bastards on USC's
women's tennis team, but you can be sure there's
no love lost between Hopkins and USC.
The same can be said of the Cardinal netters and
their Trojan counterparts. USC ended Stanford's
40-match win streak with a 5-4 victory in Los An
geles last month, so motivation for Stanford in yes
terday's rematch was plain, old-fashioned revenge.
"It feels great to beat USC," Gates said as the
No. 2-ranked Cardinal improved its overall record

to 21-1. "I think this will build our confidence a
lot."
What made Stanford's performance in the tourn
ament so commendable was not that it beat the
Trojans and halted their 26-match win streak in the
tournament final. It was that the Cardinal even got
to the final.
Stanford beat fifth-ranked Miami (Fla.) 7-2 in
Friday's first round, then trounced No. 3 Texas in
the semifinals, a match in which the doubles were
postponed until yesterday morning due to a sudden
rainstorm Saturday. And the Cardinal was the un
derdog in both matches. Stanford had two of its top
eight netters at home and a third was only available
for doubles.
Freshman Anna Ivan, the nation's fourth-ranked
singles player, who woke up Wednesday morning
with a bad virus, and Cari Hagey, who has an
injured shoulder, both missed the trip. Gates, the
senior team captain, came along, but tendinitis in
her left knee limited her to doubles action only.
"I'm really surprised," Brennan said of winning
the first-place trophy, a wood plaque in the shape
of Texas. "I probably shouldn't say that, but I
really can. It was a really good gut-check for us at
this point in the season with so many key players
