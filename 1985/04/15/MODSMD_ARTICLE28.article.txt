# Gates, Eldredge clinch netters' 5-4 victory in Texas
## Stanford nips USC, wins title 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
AUSTIN, Texas â€” The man who is perhaps
the Stanford women's tennis team's biggest fan is a
fellow named Jim Hopkins. Hopkins likes the
Cardinal netters because they win, and he loves
them when they beat USC.
Hopkins, who had business in Texas last week,
detoured here to see his favorite team play in the
invitation-only Longhorn-Kaepa Tennis Classic, a
three-day tournament featuring eight of the na
tion's top 10 teams.
And in the tournament, Hopkins got his way.
Second-ranked Stanford won three matches. And
yesterday the Cardinal beat No. 1 USC, 5-4, to win
ftie tournament title.
Moments after the Cardinal won the final point
of the final doubles match, Hopkins walked on the
court where Stanford's Linda Gates and Alyce
Werdel had just pulled out a three-setter to clinch
the match.
He hugged Gates and Werdel, then he shook
Coach Frank Brennan's hand firmly and said,
"That's all I live for is to beat those bastards."
There might not be too many bastards on USC's
women's tennis team, but you can be sure there's
no love lost between Hopkins and USC.
The same can be said of the Cardinal netters and
their Trojan counterparts. USC ended Stanford's
40-match win streak with a 5-4 victory in Los An
geles last month, so motivation for Stanford in yes
terday's rematch was plain, old-fashioned revenge.
"It feels great to beat USC," Gates said as the
No. 2-ranked Cardinal improved its overall record

to 21-1. "I think this will build our confidence a
lot."
What made Stanford's performance in the tourn
ament so commendable was not that it beat the
Trojans and halted their 26-match win streak in the
tournament final. It was that the Cardinal even got
to the final.
Stanford beat fifth-ranked Miami (Fla.) 7-2 in
Friday's first round, then trounced No. 3 Texas in
the semifinals, a match in which the doubles were
postponed until yesterday morning due to a sudden
rainstorm Saturday. And the Cardinal was the un
derdog in both matches. Stanford had two of its top
eight netters at home and a third was only available
for doubles.
Freshman Anna Ivan, the nation's fourth-ranked
singles player, who woke up Wednesday morning
with a bad virus, and Cari Hagey, who has an
injured shoulder, both missed the trip. Gates, the
senior team captain, came along, but tendinitis in
her left knee limited her to doubles action only.
"I'm really surprised," Brennan said of winning
the first-place trophy, a wood plaque in the shape
of Texas. "I probably shouldn't say that, but I
really can. It was a really good gut-check for us at
this point in the season with so many key players
missing. We had great performances from
everybody."
Indeed he did. Heroines abounded all weekend,
with three of the more unlikely ones stealing the
show yesterday.
With the singles portion of the Stanford-USC
contest knotted at 3-3, the issue would be decided
in doubles. The Trojans went ahead 4-3 when

Cecilia Fernandez and Heliane Steden downed
Patty Fendick and Leigh Anne Eldredge, 6-3, 6-3,
at No. 1.
Literally seconds later, Stephanie Savides and
Kay Tittle evened the score by polishing off Mary
Norwood and Stephainie Harges, 6-2, 6-4, at No.
3. Now the match hung in the balance at No. 2
doubles, where USC's Dena Levy and Claudia
Hernandez had just taken the second set and sent it
into a third.
The final set stayed even until Gates and Werdel
broke serve to go in front 5-4. The Cardinal pair
made it triple game-set-match point when Gates
reeled off three overpowering serves. The Trojans
came back to make it 3-2, but Gates served up an
other big one, Hernandez returned it high, and
Werdel ripped a backhand volley which Levy put
into the net.
"I was a little uneasy because in my singles match
I didn't play very well," said Werdel, who lost 6-2,
6-0 at No. 5 singles. "1 wasn't all there mentally,
and I was worried that might happen in doubles."
It didn't, even though Werdel had played
doubles with Gates only one other time this season.
"If I had to play with anybody," Werdel said, "I'd
be most comfortable with Linda because I know
her the best. We're roommates."
Yesteday's other heroine was Kay Tittle. The Ir
ving, Texas, native won twice yesterday and was
the only Cardinal to finish the tournament with a
perfect 6-0 record.
