### CAROLYN TARKINGTON Staff sportswriter 
Jon Levy led the Stanford men's
gymnastics team to- a seventh-place
finish in the NCAA team competition
at the University of Nebraska this
weekend. Levy, a junior and three
year NCAA qualifier, put together a
series of outstanding individual per
formances for a fifth-place finish in
the individual all-around competi
tion.
Finishing first through third in the
team competition were Ohio State,
Nebraska and Penn State, with scores
of 285.35, 284.55 and 283.05,
respectively. Stanford totaled 279.90
points to finish seventh out of 10
teams.
Going into the tournament ranked
seventh, Head Coach Sadao Hamada
anticipated that it would "take a lot
of serious work to maintain or better
this position."
"Breaking into the top six in the
NCAAs is no easy feat," Hamada
said before leaving for the competi
tion. "It would be an especially as
tounding accomplishment for us since
this is the first time we've ever even
broken into the NCAAs as a team."
In the individual all-around com
petition, Levy placed fifth with 57.75
points. The score was only five
hundredths of a point away from a
fourth-place finish, and only one
tenth of a point below his personal
best of 57.85, a school record he set

this season. Levy's performance was a
vast improvement over his 21st-place
finish last season.
"1 am hoping that the team
qualifies this season," Levy said early
in the year. "I've been to two NCAAs
and both times it was without the
team. It's a lot harder to compete
without that support you've been get
ting from your team members
throughout the season."
Levy also finished fifth in the finals
of the parallel bar competition.
Stanford's other placings in the all
around were Randy Besosa in 19th,
Gary Smith in 28th, Chuck Gerardo
in 44th, Mike Matzek in 47th and
Mark Arnold in 49th, with scores of
56.45, 56.00, 54.55, 54.05 and 53.60,
respectively.
Hamada reported that he had
nothing but positive comments to
make regarding the team. "Jon and
Randy have both had excellent
seasons," Hamada said. "They have
been the backbone of our squad."
"Gary Smith has made great strides
this year, and Mike Matzek has really
been a surprise," he continued. "He's
been a tough competitor and an ex
tremely hard worker.
"Mark Arnold was bothered by a
knee injury this season but also
managed to show vast improvements
in his ability as a gymnast, and Chuck
Gerardo has performed to his poten
tial. He started out slow, but has
worked very hard this season to
become an excellent gymnast."


Junior Jon Levy made his third NCAA appearance a memorable one
this weekend. Levy led his Stanford teammates to a seventh-place team
