## Three sought for campus attack 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Editorial staff 
Police are searching for three men
who raped a young woman on
campus Friday night, Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington said yester
day.
The victim, who was walking in the
vicinity of the Manzanita Trailer
Park, was assaulted between 9 and
11:30 p.m., Herrington said.
Police said they currently have no
definite leads and no witnesses to the
crime, which is the first reported rape
on campus in several months.
The victim is not a Stanford stu
dent, but because police want to
protect her anonymity, Herrington
released no more information about
her identity.
Herrington said the victim de
scribed the assailants as three black
males in their early 20s, two of
average height and the third
noticeably shorter. Herrington said
police searched the Manzanita Park
area Friday night and Saturday
looking for persons who fit that des
cription, but did not find anyone.

Police also entered at least one
campus party Friday night in search
of the assailants, according to several
students who attended a Friday party
at El Centro in Old Union. Her
rington said police believed that the
assailants "might have been going to
parties on campus," noting the large
number of off-campus people who
come to Stanford parties.
The victim reportedly went to
Toyon Hall after the assault, where
residents summoned police around
11:30 p.m.
She was taken to Stanford Hospi
tal, offered counseling and treated
the same as a student would have
been, Herrington said. She suffered
cuts and abrasions and was obviously
traumatized, he added. Her parents
took her home that night.
The Sex Crimes Unit of the Santa
Clara County Sheriff s Office may
join the case Monday, Herrington
said.
He said anyone who may have wit
nessed an assault or other suspicious
activity Friday night should contact
police at 497-9633 or 911.
