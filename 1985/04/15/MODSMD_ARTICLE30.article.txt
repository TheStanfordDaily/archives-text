The Stanford men's tennis team raised its Pacific 10
Conference record to 5-1 this weekend, defeating
Arizona State 8-1 Friday and Arizona by the same score
Saturday.
The only two matches the Cardinal lost all weekend
were the No. 6 singles against Arizona State and the No. 3
doubles against Arizona.
Stanford Coach Dick Gould was pleased with the one
sided match outcomes, because the competition level was
several notches lower than it was in last weekend's
matches against No. 2-ranked USC and No. 4-ranked
UCLA.
"This weekend was a tough one for us coming off the
USC-UCLA matches. We're better on paper than both
Arizona State and Arizona, but that still means we have to
go out there and play," Gould said.
Stanford lost its first duol match of the season to USC
5-4 last week, but Gould seems to think his team has
rebounded and is now building up to play the Trojans
again in Los Angeles this weekend.
"The guys did a good job (against the Arizona teams).
Now they can rest and prepare for our trip down south to
L.A. for two big matches," Gould said.
Stanford won its matches this weekend without Derrick
Rostagno at No. 3 singles. Rostagno, who also plays No. 2
doubles with Pat McEnroe, has strep throat and may not
be well in time to play in Wednesday's home match
against UC-Irvine.
The hole in the lineup gave Gould a chance to experi
ment with some new players, including sophomore Mark
Jacobson and senior Paul Robinson.
Jacobson played No. 6 singles against Arizona State's
Mike Holden. He lost the Cardinal's only match, 7-6, 6-4,
