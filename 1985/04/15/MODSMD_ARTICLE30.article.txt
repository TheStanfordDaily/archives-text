### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's tennis team raised its Pacific 10
Conference record to 5-1 this weekend, defeating
Arizona State 8-1 Friday and Arizona by the same score
Saturday.
The only two matches the Cardinal lost all weekend
were the No. 6 singles against Arizona State and the No. 3
doubles against Arizona.
Stanford Coach Dick Gould was pleased with the one
sided match outcomes, because the competition level was
several notches lower than it was in last weekend's
matches against No. 2-ranked USC and No. 4-ranked
UCLA.
"This weekend was a tough one for us coming off the
USC-UCLA matches. We're better on paper than both
Arizona State and Arizona, but that still means we have to
go out there and play," Gould said.
Stanford lost its first duol match of the season to USC
5-4 last week, but Gould seems to think his team has
rebounded and is now building up to play the Trojans
again in Los Angeles this weekend.
"The guys did a good job (against the Arizona teams).
Now they can rest and prepare for our trip down south to
L.A. for two big matches," Gould said.
Stanford won its matches this weekend without Derrick
Rostagno at No. 3 singles. Rostagno, who also plays No. 2
doubles with Pat McEnroe, has strep throat and may not
be well in time to play in Wednesday's home match
against UC-Irvine.
The hole in the lineup gave Gould a chance to experi
ment with some new players, including sophomore Mark
Jacobson and senior Paul Robinson.
Jacobson played No. 6 singles against Arizona State's
Mike Holden. He lost the Cardinal's only match, 7-6, 6-4,

but Gould was not dissatisfied with
Jacobson's playing.
"Mark had absolutely no idea he
was going to play on Friday. When I
found Derrick was not going to come
out, I called Mark to see if he could
play. 1 called at two minutes past one
and told him he had to be out on the
court, ready to play at 1:30," Gould
said.
Although it was a surprise that
Jacobson played singles, his opponent
turned out to be an old friend and
long-time competitor. Jacobson
played Holden, a Los Altos native,
"for about the 16th time" Friday.
"Mark and I have been playing
since the [12-year-old competitions],
and our matches have usually been
really even and close," Holden said.
"This time I tried to take the net
away from him, and it seems to have
worked well."
Jacobson leads the overall win/loss
record between the two, but this time
came out on the losing end.
"It feels great to have won our only
match, especially since I'm home and

have the whole world out here to see
me play today," Holden said.
In Saturday's match, the Cardinal
defeated another young team,
Arizona, with one loss in No. 3
doubles. Dan Goldie won his No. 1
singles match against Benji Papell, 6-
3, 6-1. Papell was the first player to
defeat Goldie this season, in Stan
ford's match against Arizona over
spring break.
"Danny's game was a little more
aggressive this time but not op
pressive. He came to the net and vol
leyed well," Gould said. "Papell
really has a big forehand, but Danny
handled him well."
Stanford won all the singles
matches in straight sets. The third
doubles match was decided in
Arizona's favor, 6-2, 3-6, 7-6. Jacob
son and Paul Robinson had double
break and double-match point up 6-5
in the third set, but lost the game and
the tie breaker that followed, to
Arizona's John Schmitt and lan Aler.

UC-Irvine, currently ranked 17th in
the nation, before traveling for its
