# Card crews sunk by powerful Cal

### GEOFF SANBORN Editorial staff 
This year's "Big Row," the annual
dual meet between the Stanford and
California men's and women's crew
teams, was one of those sporting
events that can be explained in as few
as five words. Cal was better. Cal
won.
The Bears took eight out of the 10
races at Redwood Shores Saturday,
losing only in the men's novice four
and the women's varsity four events.
Although the Cardinal came close in
a couple of its losses, both the men
and women were consistently out
classed by their Berkeley rivals.
"Cal is awfully good," admitted
Stanford Men's Varsity Coach Ken
Dreyfuss. "They're the premier pro
gram in the area, and it's awfully
tough to beat them."
"We did fine, and Cal did better,"
said Cardinal Women's Varsity
Coach John Davis. "We outrowed
them technically, but they just have
more horsepower."
The Stanford men's biggest losses
came in the major events, the varsity
and junior varsity races. The varsity
lost hy 141V2 seconds — "We had the
potential to have a better race,"
Dreyfuss said — and the JV boat
finished six seconds behind Cal.

In the novice eight race, Stanford
was nipped at the finish line by seven
tenths of a second. "We were over a
length-and-a-half behind with 500
meters to go," said Frosh/Novice
Coach Jim Farwell, "and we put on a
huge sprint for the last 40 strokes. It
there had been five more strokes in
the race, we would have won."
The Cardinal women put in solid
showings in the varsity eight and JV
eight races, losing by four seconds
and three seconds, respectively. The
Stanford JVs had beaten Cal in the
San Diego Crew Classic earlier this
month, but fell short in Redwood
Shores.
"Cal came back and rowed a beau
tiful race," Davis said of Saturday's
JV contest. "We attacked and at
tacked and attacked and always fell
short."
Both of the Stanford women's
novice eight boats were beaten
"pretty soundly," Davis said.
The loss left the Cardinal women
with a lot of work ahead of them in
preparation for the Pacific Coast
Championships May 18-19 on Lake
Natoma near Sacramento. "We have
a way to go and a lot of ground to
make up in both the varsity and the
novice," Davis said.
