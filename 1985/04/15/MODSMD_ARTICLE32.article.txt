# Marshall highlights tracksters' showing
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN Editorial staff 
A seven-foot high jump by freshman Brian Marshall —
the best performance by a Cardinal jumper in 17 years —
highlighted a day of strong individual performances and
poor team finishes for the Stanford men's and women's
track teams here Saturday.
The Cardinal men lost to Pacific 10 Conference rival
Washington, 87-76, while defeating San Diego State 85-
75. The Stanford women did not even fare that well --
they bowed to USC, 86-57, San Diego State, 77-68, and
Washington, 74-58.
But team results were not as important as individual
finishes for the Cardinal, according to Asst. Coach Dave
Wollman. Nine men and five women won their events for
Stanford.
"We felt we did extremely well overall," Wollman said.
"Our problem is we have such high quality, but we just
don't have much quantity. We didn't win because we
aren't deep enough to go second and third in most
events."
Wollman described Saturday's contests as "training
meets" for the Pac-1() conference championships in mid-
May, and a number of Cardinal athletes served notice that
they are rounding into top form.

As far as Marshall is concerned, his seven-toot leap on
Saturday is only the beginning. "I was expecting it,' he
said yesterday."It was OK, but not anything to write
home about."
Marshall, who cleared 7-foot-3V2 in high school, has
been recovering steadily from a torn Achilles heel suf
fered over Christmas break, and should have some even
better jumps ahead of him. Seven feet "is just the starting
point for him," Wollman said.
Jeff Atkinson won the 1,500-yard race in a time of
3:44.3, followed closely by teammate Marc Olesen at
3:46.8. "Atkinson is just now starting to realize what he
can do," Wollman said. "The kid is strong enough to run
with anyone."
The women's squad was missing three of its top athletes
Saturday, and the Cardinal could ill afford the losses.
"The men are thin," Wollman said, "but the women are
thinner."
Ceci Hopp and Alison Wiley — both of whom are
former NCAA champions in their events — and freshman
Cory Schubert all missed the meet with injuries. Hopp
and Wiley should be back well before the Pac-lOs, but
Schubert's injury — nerve problems in her lower back —
could end her season.
