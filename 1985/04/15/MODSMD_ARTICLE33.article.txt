# Softballers go 2-2 on weekend
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER Senior sportswriter 
Despite a double-header loss, you might
call Friday and Saturday a success for the
Stanford softbal! team.
Although the host Cardinal lost a pair to
Long Beach State, 8-4 and 4-0, for its 37th
and 38th setbacks of the season Saturday, it
broke into double figures in the victory
column with a twinbill sweep of Cuesta Col
lege, 5-3 and 3-2, on Friday at Roble Field.
Asked if she considered the weekend suc
cessful, sophomore Lisa Buchanan replied,
"Definitely, because we broke into double
figures in the win column. That was a relief."
Stanford now has 10 victories, all in non
conference play, going into its final home
double-header and last Western Collegiate
Athletic Association games, against San L)iego
State Wednesday.
Against Cuesta and Long Beach, the Card
inal alternated between scoring early, late,
and not at all.
In the first game against Cuesta, Stanford
scored four runs in the first two innings, one
in the first and three in the second, to take an
early, insurmountable lead. Senior Cathy Taft

opened the first inning with a walk and scored
as the Cardinal benefited from two errors.
In the second, freshman Terri Silliman,
sophomore Betsy Watson and freshman Terry
Villalobos led off with walks. Silliman and
Watson scored and Villalobos was thrown out
before Taft, who singled after Villalobos
walked, scored the final run of the inning.
Stanford failed to blow the game open,
though, after the second. The Cardinal scored
one if the fourth when sophomore Lisa
Buchanan went to first on one of Cuesta's
three first-game errors and scored on Maria
De La Rosa's two-out triple. Cuesta made the
game close with a run in the third and two in
the fourth off winner Watson.
The Cardinal got its offense going late in
the second game against Cuesta, scoring two
in the sixth. It was enough to break a 1-1 tie,
withstand the run Cuesta scored in the top of
the seventh and give Buchanan her fifth vic
tory against 17 losses.
Taft led off the sixth with a triple and
scored on Watson's single. Watson stole
second before scoring on Buchanan's single.
Junior K.K. Bush enabled Stanford to take a
1-0 lead when she reached first on a fielder's

choice and scored in the third inning. Before
its four-hit sixth inning, the Cardinal, which
had five hits for the game, had but one hit —
De La Rosa's second-inning double.
Long Beach stopped Stanford's one-day,
two-game winning streak Saturday. The day
started promisingly for the Cardinal, which
scored four runs in the double-header's
opening inning. However, Stanford was shut
out during the rest of the first game and all of
the second, managing but six hits on the day
— five in the first game with three of those in
the first inning.
Four of the first five Cardinal hitters scored
in the first inning of the first game — Taft,
Laura Buchanan, De La Rosa and Monique
Bautista. Lisa Buchanan held Long Beach
scoreless until the fourth, when she gave up
five hits and three runs. Watson relieved in
the fifth, but the 49ers got two in the fifth to
take the lead before adding three in the sixth.
Watson, 5-21, also got the loss in the
second game, despite giving way to Lisa Buc
hanan during the 49ers' three-run fourth in
ning. Long Beach pitcher Kim Lee, whose
teammates scored their final run in the fourth,
gave up only Taft's fourth-inning single.
