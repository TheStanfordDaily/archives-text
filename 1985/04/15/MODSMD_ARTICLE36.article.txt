# Golfers shoot well, fall short
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff sports writer 
While several of the world's golfers
were at the Masters this weekend,
proving why they are considered the
best in their profession, the UCLA
and Stanford men golfers were busy
making absolute shambles of the
Stanford Golf Course at the Stanford
U.S. Intercollegiate.
The Bruins, led by a dazzling per
formance by Ail-American Duffy
Waldorf, fired a three-round total of
1,069, edging the Cardinal by five
strokes. None of the other teams

competing was able to break the
1,100 mark. Fresno State finished
third at 1,103, and San Jose State
took fourth place with a 1,109 total.
"It was strictly a two-team race,"
Stanford Coach Tim Schaaf said. "1
wouldn't be surprised if both UCLA
and we beat the tournament record."
Waldorf, who also won the West
ern Intercollegiate April 2-4 at Santa
Cruz, showed this weekend why he is
one of the top collegiate golfers in the
nation. He combined a final-round 65
yesterday with a pair of 67s to shatter

the tournament record with a 199.
"It was just a tremendous perfor
mance," Schaaf said. "We lost to
Duffy."
While Waldorf was running away
from the rest of the field, five Card
inal golfers were finishing in the top
nine.
Sophomore Rich Marik, who has
been in and out of the lineup
throughout the season, captured
second place with a three-round 212.
Immediately behind Marik were
juniors Don Walsworth (213) and
Carl Wagner (214), though Wagner's
score was not included among the
team's scores. Seniors Scott Erickson
and Doug Thompson finished in a tie
for eighth place at 216.
Other Stanford scores included
Tim Robinson at 221, Phil Rowley at
225, Lew Dickey at 226 and Cole
Thompson at 241.
Schaaf said that the Cardinal's suc
cess in the Stanford U.S. Intercol
legiate marks a significant step in the
team's recent turnaround. "The last
three tournaments we played, we
kind of tarnished our record. We
didn't live up to our No. 2 (West
Coast) ranking," he said. "(But) this
was an absolutely amazing perfor
mance."
"We got very much back into the
groove," Schaaf said. "We can ap
proach the next tournaments with
quite a bit of confidence."
Schaaf indicated that the Cardinal
has now all but secured a spot in this
season's NCAA nationals. However,
he said that there is still incentive to
play well through the remainder of
the season.
Not only do the Cardinal men want
to continue playing well in prepara
tion for the nationals, but a victory
over San Jose at the Sun Devil Invita
tional April 25-27 would edge Stan
ford past the Spartans in the season
series and would give the Cardinal
local "bragging rights" over its
Northern California rival, Schaaf
said.
Prior to the Sun Devil Invitational,
though, Stanford will play in the Brig
ham Young tournament Friday and

Saturday. Schaaf said that he will play
at this tournament the six golfers who
will be returning to next year's team.
While the men's team appears to
be headed to the nationals, the Stan
ford women golfers are engaged in a
dogfight to qualify for the NCAA
tournament. For the women, an
entire season's efforts have literally
come down to two tournaments,
beginning with the Lady Sun Devil at
Phoenix, Ariz., today through Wed
nesday.
"We have six competitive days
left," Cardinal Coach Tim Baldwin
said. "We've got to produce."
The Cardinal women, ranked 13th
in the most recent national poll, need
to remain in the top 14 in the com
puter rankings come the end of the
season to qualify for the Nationals in
Cape Cod May 22-25. Needless to
say, their margin for error is slim.
However, despite the Cardinal's
precarious situation, Baldwin
believes that the largely inexperi
enced team is starting to play with
more and more confidence and is
very capable of making the NCAAs.
Much of Baldwin's enthusiasm
probably stems from the women's
most recent showing. At the Califor
nia Intercollegiate April 7-8 at Stan
ford and San Jose, the Cardinal
women finished second to U.S. Inter
national University and defeated
both second-ranked San Jose State
and ninth-ranked UCLA by 10
strokes.
In addition to posting victories over
the Spartans and Bruins, Stanford
fired a team and course record 289 in
the first round. Each team's low 15
scores are calculated into the national
computer rankings and the Cardinal's
289 along with their third-round 300
was very significant with regards to
the team's post-season chances.
Stanford sophomore Kathleen
McCarthy was excited to see the team
playing well after an inconsistent
mid-season. "It felt good to be in
contention again," said McCarthy,
who finished one shot back in the
California Intercollegiate.

Carl Wagner finished fourth in the Stanford U.S. Intercollegiate, but
because Coach Tim Schaaf did not choose him as one of the five mem
bers of the team whose scores count toward the team total, Wagner
could not help in the Cardinal's team finish.
