### CHARLIE GOFEN Editorial staff 
The Stanford judo team beat San
Francisco State, 8-3, and California,
3-2, to win a three-way meet in
Maples Pavilion yesterday afternoon.
San Francisco State and Cal tied
for second place, 3-3.
Stanford Head Coach Willy Cahill
said he was surprised with Stanford's
easy victory over the Gators. "I
thought it would be close, not an an
nihilation," said Cahill, who singled
out two-match winner Vic Johnson as
particularly impressive at the meet.
Johnson threw San Francisco
State's Roberto Padilla with a leg
sweep less than two minutes into his
first match and then won his second
match, against Cal's Rocky Crivello,
in the first minute with a perfect leg
throw.
"Vic has brilliant techniques. . ..
He's perfected [the leg sweep],"
Cahill said.
A judoist can win a match by ipporx
— the equivalent of a knockout in
boxing — or by scoring more points
than his opponent. An ippon is
awarded to a judoist for throwing an
opponent largely onto his back with
considerable force, as Johnson did in
both of his matches, for pinning an
opponent for 30 seconds, and for
forcing an opponent to give up, often
by choking him.
Stanford's Carlos Sanders beat San
Francisco State's Tawfig Hindani
with two near-perfect stomach throws
that, added together, constituted an
ippon, ending the match.
Other Stanford winners against the
Gators by ippon were Reinhold
Gahlman, James Arnwine and Brett
Lewis. Arnwine and Lewis both got
powerful holds on their opponents,
maintaining control for the full 30

seconds.
Stanford's H. Sho Fuji, Mike
Dobres and Karel Zikan won their
matches by points.
Team captain John Molitoris was
choked out by San Francisco State's
Alan Yeo. According to Cahill,
Molitoris was physically prepared to
fight but not mentally or emotionally
ready. "John had too many obliga
tions," Cahill said, noting that
Molitoris was largely responsible for
setting up Maples yesterday morning.
"He didn't have time to get ready for
his fight."
Stanford's Philip Katz also lost by
ippon, coming away from his match
against Don Escobosa with a bloody
forehead. Tatiana Deeff, the only
woman fighting for Stanford, lost a
close match to the Gators' Phyllis
Franchy, and Stanford's Darrell
Schlom fought Michael McCrary to a
draw.
Against Berkeley, Stanford came
away with three ippon victories — by
Johnson, Gahlman and Charlie
Hokanson.
Gahlman won with a near-perfect
throw and subsequent pin. Cahill said
that Gahlman, who has little experi
ence in judo matches, gave an espe
cially "outstanding" performance at
yesterday's meet.
Hokanson choked out Cal's Doug
Forbes in a come-from-behind and
from-below move. With Forbes di
rectly on top of him, Hokanson used
his opponent's lapels to strangle him
and force him to give up.
Stanford lost two of the remaining
three matches. Arnwine fought Cal's
Scott Longwell to a draw, Lewis was
pinned by Ed Nicholas, and Sanders
was choked out by the Bears' Andy
Arvan with only 20 seconds left in his
match.
