# Anti-McGrath drive may violate ASSU rules
## 
### DAVID S. GOLDSTEIN Staff writer 
A last-minute campaign to block the re
election of ASSU Graduate Senator Jim
McGrath, launched Thursday by two other
graduate senators and the director of Tuesday
Films, will be investigated as a possible cam
paign violation, according to Elections
Hearing Officer Mike Heller.
Fliers signed by Graduate Senators Richard
Beigel and Mark Mazur and Tuesday Films
Director Eric Diesel were posted around
campus Friday, charging that McGrath
"regularly opposes funding to student
groups" and "has written financial reporting
requirements that make life more difficult for
student-organization treasurers." Late last
night, Beigel told The Daily that he wished to
retract the latter statement.
Kevin Gross, the ASSU elections commis
sioner, said, "There is a number of possible

problems with this poster. I have asked Mike
Heller to look into a possible violation of the
Campaign Practices Code."
Gross said the poster appears to have been
printed on a University computer printer,
which may violate an unfair advantage clause
in the code. Also, false statements would vio
late the fairness doctrinc clause. Gross said.
Heller, who said last night that he had not
seen the flier, said he will investigate whether
the fliers violate elections bylaws and will file
a report with the Hearings Committee. He
said that although he may begin informal in
vestigations immediately, the report would be
completed after the elections, which are to
morrow and Wednesday.
Gross said if the Hearings Committee finds
the flyer violates the code, those involved may
be disqualified. Of the three whose names ap
pear on the flier, ouly Beigel is running for
senate.

"We're sick of having him (McGrath) in the
senate," Beigel said. "He's hard to work
with."
McGrath said Beigel, Mazur and Diesel
oppose him for personal reasons.
"Does the word 'scapegoat' ring a bell?"
McGrath said.
McGrath said Diesel "took extreme excep
tion that anyone could disagree with him,"
and he "just doesn't like me all that much."
He said Beigel and Mazur hope to oust him
because he has battled them on several senate
issues. "If they can't win an argument against
me in the senate, then (their approach is to)
nuke me," McGrath said.
Beigel said he and Mazur made 1,000 of
the fliers, which read, "Dump McGrath." The
fliers ask graduate students from Humanities
and Sciences to write in Tony Davis, a
graduate linguistics student, rather than vote
for McGrath.

Eight positions are available and eight
names were on the ballot. But one, Ron
Pekar, was mistakenly placed on the
Humanities and Sciences ballot instead of the
School of Engineering ballot, and the error
has been rectified. It is thus possible that all
seven remaining candidates, including
McGrath, plus write-in candidate Davis may
be elected.
Although it seems likely that McGrath will
be re-elected despite the campaign against
him, he said he is "quite concerned with the
whole issue."
'i would be upset if the electorate made
decisions based on false information," he
said. The fliers claim McGrath used legal
technicalities to prevent the Speakers Bureau
from receiving funding in 1983. McGrath said
this charge is "demonstrably false" and
"completely off the mark."
"It's not like they couldn't have pretty

easily checked it out," he said.
McGrath said also it was current Senate
Chair Eric Berg, not McGrath, who wrote the
financial reporting requirements mentioned
in the fliers. McGrath said he has asked
Beigel and Mazur to withdraw both charges.
After a late phone conversation with
McGrath last night, Beigel agreed to drop the
charge that McGrath has made life more diffi
cult for treasurers of student groups.
Beigel said he "confused the authorships"
of two bills dealing with financial reporting
requirements. "Eric Berg wrote that, the fin
ancial reporting requirement, to which I was
referring."
Mazur, however, was reluctant to retract
the statement.
Mazur said he would go along with Beigel's
retraction, because Beigel was the author of
the poster.
