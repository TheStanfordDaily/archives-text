## Panel speaks on benefits of MNCs 
### TRACEY BANKS 
A top administrator with the gov
ernment's Overseas Private Invest
ment Corporation (OPIC) said
Friday that multinational corpora
tions could help alleviate hunger in
the Third World by providing jobs
and investment.
During a panel discussion lun in
conjunction with last week's hunger
conference, Gerald West, vice presi
dent in charge of development for
OPIC, emphasized the benefits that
properly screened multinational cor
porations (MNCs) can bring to a de
veloping country. He said that OPIC
tries to combat the "problem of
hunger by fostering investments that
generate income to the workers in
these countries."
Also on the panel were Stanford
Political Science Prof. David Aber
nethy and Ted Marks, former vice
president of Castle and Cook Corp.
West chided Abernethy for raising
"irrelevant theoretical issues" in
trying to define development, which
he tended to measure in strictly eco
nomic terms. He emphasized the
"importance of access to interna
tional markets that MNCs bring with
investments" as one of the greatest
benefits of their presence in develop
ing countries.
However, he said that how much
MNC involvement in Third World
countries should be allowed is a
"decision to be made by developing
countries themselves rather than by
bureaucrats or professors."
Abernethy observed that both crit

ics and defenders of MNC involve
ment in the Third World "tend to talk
past each other in deaf dialogue."
Abernethy said the first step in
producing effective communication
between supporters and critics of
MNC involvement is to create a defi
nition of development that includes
cultural and political progress as well
as net economic growth.
He stated that an "increase in the
capacity of local people to choose
their own elites" as well as the ability
of locals to "define and maintain
pride in their own culture" are impor
tant aspects of development often
overlooked by MNCs.
Marks used Castle and Cook as a
"representative example of a multi
national corporation." He viewed
MNCs as a very positive force in the
Third World because they "provide
income that couldn't be otherwise
available" to local workers.
Marks acknowledged that MNCs
bring problems of "congestion, over
population, soil erosion and un
employment" to some small com
munities. However, he added that
"the impact, over a period of time, is
helping a community develop in that
there is a significant economic bene
fit" to the country as a whole.
in response to Abernethy's allega
tions that the presence of MNCs in
countries with oppressive govern
ments "can be seen as a sort of silent
support of these regimes," he said
that any corporation "has got to be
able to stay throughout whatever
kind of political regime."
