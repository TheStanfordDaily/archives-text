# Heart patient goes home
## 
### 
Elizabeth Craze's joy at tricycle
riding and jumping down the stairs
belies the nearly two-decade odyssey
of fatal disease which has afflicted her
family.
The youngster was only two-and
one-half years old last Oct. 8 when
she became Stanford's youngest heart
transplant patient. On Saturday, her
parents took their bouncy daughter
back home to Cleveland, where she
was reunited with her 18-year-old
brother, Andrew.
He received his own heart
transplant July 10, 1983, and
returned to school the following fall.
Now he is doing well enough to
return to Stanford next fall â€” this

time as a computer science freshman.
Andrew and Elizabeth are the
children of Charles and Susan Craze.
The couple's oldest son and a set of
twins all died of the same disease,
which triggered Elizabeth and
Andrew's transplants.
"We certainly have high hopes that
Elizabeth will do extremely well and
have a long lifespan," said Dr. Sharon
Hunt, the Stanford cardiologist who
takes care of transplant patients after
surgery. "We've set no limits as to her
physical activity."
Hunt said familial cardiomyopathy
is essentially a deterioration of the
heart muscle. The condition is rare.

and even rarer as an inherited condi
tion. While the cause is uncertain,
Hunt said a current theory is that
some people inherit an almost fatal
sensitivity to a virus which is harmless
to most people.
Cardiomyopathy has accounted for
nearly half of the 335 transplants at
Stanford since January 1968. Other
than experimental drug treatments
which offer promise, transplantation
has been the major treatment for the
condition in its advanced stages. The
other most common reason for
transplantation, coronary artery
disease, occurs more often and can be
treated in a variety of ways.
