The day vacation ended
Mother Daily sat broodingly under
a hot, bright sun the day vacation
ended, but not all those returning
from vacation would appreciate the
fine weather.

the violently confrontational
meetings, the members were begin
ning to enjoy the serenity of life with
out "the board." And who wanted to
research edit ideas in the library
before Tuesday's 3:30 p.m. meeting
on a day like today?
Kicky Christopher, however, was
happy to see sunshine again. After an
exhausting stay in the best hotels on
the East Coast, she would be oh-so
glad to be back relaxing in the sun.
