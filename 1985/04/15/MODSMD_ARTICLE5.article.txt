# Computer dept. to switch schools
## 
### TODD RAMMING Senior staff writer 
The faculty of the Department of
Computer Science has voted to move
from the School of Humanities and
Sciences to the School of Engineer
ing, and Provost James Rosse says he
expects the move to be completed by
fall quarter.
The move, which has been under
discussion for some years, received
"nearly unanimous" approval by the
computer science faculty on April 2,
said Nils Nilsson, department chair
man. Slight sentiment against the
move "proceeded from people's cau
tionary concerns," he said.
The change will involve only an ad
ministrative shift, Nilsson said. The
department itself is neither changing
its location nor undergoing any inter
nal reorganization.
Rosse said he expects to rubber
stamp the proposed move pending
the resolution of administrative
details.
"Both schools (Humanities and
Sciences, and Engineering) are in fa
vor of it." said Norman Wcssells.
dean of the School of Humanities and
Sciences. "The department should be
where it will function best," he said.
"We expect the administrative
move will make it easier to cooperate
with the School of Engineering."
Nilsson said. "The subject matter, the
research efforts that are taken and
the combination of experiment with
theory seem to be the kind of activity
the engineering school is used to
dealing with," he said.
The original placement of com

puter science in the School of
Humanities and Sciences arose from
"historic, not logical reasons,"
Nilsson said. The field of computer
research arose as a branch of the
Mathematics Department many years
ago.
Two more immediate concerns
have brought the move to a speedier
conclusion.
Aware that the Electrical Engi
neering Department might begin a
computer section of its own, the
Computer Science Department fac
ulty are wary of "the danger of com
peting computer science depart
ments," Nilsson said. The department
hopes to "forestall a possible long
term problem" by moving, he said.
In addition, the Computer Science
Department hopes to complete plans
for an undergraduate major that have
rested on the back burner for four to
five years.
While no committee has been for
mally established to prepare the re
quirements of the proposed major,
Nilsson said the same curriculum
committee which handles the
graduate program in computer sci
ence could handle developing an un
dergraduate major.
Nilsson expects the move to the
School of Engineering to aid the
coordination of electrical engineering
and computer science classes which
would compose the undergraduate
major.
Nilsson said he hope? to have the
undergraduate major in place by
1986, and suggests that anxious stu
dents could take the Computer Sci
ence 108 sequence, which would un
doubtedly form the first year-long re
quirement of the major.
Although the Computer Science
Department will be operating under
the aegis of the School of Engineer
ing, it may offer a second major
through the School of Humanities
and Sciences. The second major
would deal with the more theoretical
side of computer science, Nilsson
said, while the program through the
School of Engineering would concen
trate more on applications.
"We need to continue to attract top
young people," Nilsson said.
