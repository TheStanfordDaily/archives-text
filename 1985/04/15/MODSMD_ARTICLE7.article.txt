### DANNY PEARL Staff writer 
The Stanford Police Department has begun an investi
gation of a string of petty thefts on campus. According to
police department records, 13 students had wallets, stereo
equipment and camera equipment stolen last week.
An average of three petty thefts occur in a typical week,
according to the records.
In five of the reported cases, wallets were taken from
residence dining halls within a half-hour of meals. Typi
cally, wallets are taken from backpacks, and in at least one
case, the wallet and backpack were found discarded in a
residence restroom, according to police records. Most of
the thefts are taking place in Row houses.
Row Director Diana Conklin warned resident assistants
about the thefts during a staff meeting last week, accord
ing to Theta Chi RA Benjamin Austin.
"We are definitely concerned," said Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington. ''It'sthe type of thing where we
get a report of someone leaving their wallet on their desk
and going to talk with a friend down the hall, and some
one walks in and takes their wallet."
"Students should be careful not to leave their doors
open and not to leave valuables in plain sight." Her
rington said. He also advised students to notify their resi
dent assistant or the police if they see suspicious people in
their residence.
Herrington said students should write down credit card
numbers and other important information now so they
have them if their wallets arc stolen. "I wouid advise
people to go through their wallet, look at each item and
think of the trouble it would cause if it were gone."
Austin described a wallet theft which occurred in Theta
Chi last week. "It was taken from a backpack in the Theta
Chi dining room that afternoon, just before dinner. Ap
parently. what the person did was either take the wallet
out of the backpack right in the dining room or take the
backpack into some private place like a bathroom, take
the wallet out and bring the backpack back.
"The backpack was found open and in the dining room,
so the wallet was obviously taken and not lost." said Aus
tin."lt was pretty upsetting for the student."
