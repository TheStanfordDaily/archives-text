Ten die in Lebanese violence
SIDON, Lebanon — At least 10 people were killed in weekend
battles in Sidon pitting Christians against Moslems and Palestinians,
police said yesterday.
Residents called it the most violent fighting since clashes began 17 days
ago.
in Tyre, also in south Lebanon, reporters said Israeli troops took more
than 60 men away from the el-Bass Palestinian camp on the city's edge.
Israeli military sources called it "routine activity," and said dozens were
held for questioning but no weapons were found.
In Sidon, the provincial capital of southern Lebanon and the nation's
second-largest city with 200,000 people, battles between Christian
Lebanese Forces militia in the hills ih the east and Moslem and Palestin
ian fighters on the city's edge raged into yesterday.
The battles subsided into sporadic sniping by afternoon, but shelling
resumed just before dark. At least 79 people were reported wounded,
but the number of casualties was not immediately available because am
bulances could not reach some areas.
The Palestinian refugee camps of Ein el-Hilweh and Mieh Mieh on
Sidon's outskirts came under heavy bombardment, and shells crashed
into the city's center. Palestinian guerrillas and their Moslem allies fired
back at Christian hilltop positions.
The sectarian fighting in Sidon broke out on March 29, after Samir
Geagea, a pro-Israeli militia leader, led a mutiny within President Amin
Getnayel's Phalange Party against the Syrian-oriented leadership.
Yesterday's casualties brought the toll since March 29 to 76 dead and
more than 359 wounded.
Police in Sidon, 25 miles South of Beirut, said 10 people were known
dead by yesterday. Hospitals said the dead included a 2-year-old Pales
tinian girl whose head was blown off by a shell.
The Moslem Voice of the Nation radio station, said that in addition to
the casualties in Sidon, five people were killed and more than 60
wounded in Christian areas elsewhere, but there was no independent
confirmation.
Saturday was the 10th anniversary of Lebanon's civil war. It began
with an assassination attempt on Pierre Gemayel, the late father of
Lebanon's current president and founder of the right-wing Phalange
Party, and a revenge attack on a bus that killed 28 people.
Some estimates put the number killed since then at more than 100,000.
Populist wins in Peruvian election
LIMA, Peru — Armored vehicles patroled the streets and troops
guarded polling places across the nation yesterday as millions of
Peruvians ignored a boycott call by guerrillas and voted for a president
and congress.
Shortly after the polls closed, the country's major television network
projected congressman Alan Garcia, 35-year-old candidate of the
populist Aprista Party, as the winner but indicated that he was headed
for a runoff.
The second-place finisher in the unofficial projections by Channel
Five was Alfonso Barrantes Lingan, 57-year-old Marxist mayor of Lima
and candidate of the United Left, a loose coalition of eight leftist parties.
The rest of the vote was split among seven other candidates.
Channel Five said its exit poll indicated that Garcia, whose party is
equivalent to Social Democratic parties elsewhere, was winning 45 per
cent of the vote to 22 percent for Barrantes. To win election, the victor
needed a plurality; otherwise, a second-round election between the top
two contenders will be held in June.
Before the polls opened, three people were wounded in Lima in
dynamite attacks against three precinct campaign headquarters in the
capital of the conservative Democratic Convergence Party.
Police said one man lost a leg and another man an eye in the attacks,
which were blamed on the Tupac Amaru guerrillas.
Election officials predicted an 80 percent turnout of the 8.3 million el
igible voters. Long lines formed before dawn at the polls, which opened
at 8 a.m.
The new president will inherit Peru's worst economic depression in
history and the prolonged battle with the Shining Path guerrilla move
ment, which has vowed to seize power and install a Maoist government.
Shultz cites progress with Japan
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State George Shultz, reporting prog
ress Saturday in negotiations to end America's trade imbalance with
Japan, called on Tokyo to speed up its review of trade barriers to U.S.
products.
Following a two-hour meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Shin
taro Abe, Shultz told reporters "considerable headway" has been made
toward opening Japanese markets to a variety of American goods.
Shultz said that Abe had assured him that technical standards for
telecommunication products, which represent a barrier to U.S. products,
would be reduced "to a bare minimum."
But the secretary added: "We must not only complete the standards
review quickly, we must begin tohear the cash registers ring."
The meeting came as the two countries tried to cool tensions over the
record $44 billion trade surplus posted by Japan in 1984, including $37
billion at the expense of the United States.
Abe agreed with Shultz's assessment of the trade talks. "We have
made a great deal of progress. I am very confident that Japanese-U.S.
trade relations are moving in the right direction," he said.
On the telecommunications issue, Shultz said "the foreign minister
told me today that this effort would be based on reducing standards to
those needed to prevent harm to the network, harm to users, or crosstalk
(interference)."
The secretary added that the matter would be wrapped up if possible
before the Bonn economic summit of industrialized nations in early
May.
At a later briefing for reporters, a senioi State Department official
said while the United States appreciates Japanese efforts to open their
markets, "in our view it needs to move much more quickly."
The official, speaking only on condition he not be identified, said the
most important aspect of the meeting was the opportunity for Shultz to
convey "the strength of feeling in this country" about Japanese trade
barriers and the threat of protectionist moves if more rapid progress is
not made.
Shultz delivered a warning to those in Congress who favor retaliation
if Japan does not swiftly open its markets to American goods. "We are
all threatened by protectionism," he said.
44 Protectionism is not a cure for an illness. It is itself an illness and one
that can spread, like a plague."
Other progress is being made in the area of satellite sales, where prob
lems of allocation of frequency bands would "be addressed in a way that
would permit the sale of private satellites to go forward," Shultz said.
The session between the two chief diplomats came at the end of a
week in which Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone made an
unusual television appeal to his countrymen "to buy as many imported
goods as possible," saying Japan's record trade surplus is creating
resentment overseas.

VIENNA, Austria — Ramiz Alia, the head of state of isolated Al
bania for the past three years, was elected Saturday as Communist Party

Hoxha, who died Thursday at the age of 76.

Party of Labor of Albania.
Even before Hoxha's death, foreign observers predicted Alia would
probably succeed to the post of party chief, a job that gave Hoxha practi
cally unlimited powers.

diplomatic sources in neighboring Greece A Moslem originally, he
comes from the Skodra region in northern Albania.
