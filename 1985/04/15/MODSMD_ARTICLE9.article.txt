# Democrats balk at reductions
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — House Democratic leaders
are pursuing a delaying strategy to make sure the
Republican-run Senate votes first on a plan to trim
the federal deficit by reducing Social Security bene
fit increases.
Congress returns from its Easter-Passover recess
today to a week of expected behind-the-scenes
manuevering in both chambers on the 1986 budget.
The simmering issue of cost-of-living increases
for Social Security recipients has already taken cen
ter stage.
And Democrats are doing their best to try to
make sure that Republicans take the heat for the
proposal to scale back these increases.
The plan proposed by President Reagan and
Senate Republican leaders for a 2 percent limit on
cost-of-living adjustments for the nation's 36 mil
lion Social Security recipients gets its first congres
sional airing today.
The Democrat-controlled House Aging Com
mittee is scheduled to hold a hearing on a variety of
Social Security-related issues.
The Senate is expected to begin formal debate

April 22 on the 1986 budget compromise ham
mered out between the White House and Senate
Republican leaders.
Meanwhile, the House Budget Committee, ear
lier expected to begin its work on the fiscal 1986
federal budget this week, has postponed the ses
sions for at least another week.
Instead, committee Democrats will have a series
of closed-door strategy sessions in the coming days.
House officials acknowledge that the main Demo
cratic strategy on the budget right now is one of
delay.
"Republicans claim an election mandate, they
should be out front. Why should we get ahead of
them on Social Security?" said Christopher Mat
thews, a spokesman for House Speaker Thomas
"Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass).
Matthews said he doubted the Budget Commit
tee would do any major work on the budget until
the Senate had completed its floor debate.
"It's not clear that the (White House-Senate Re
publican) deal is going to hold in the Senate
anyway," Matthews added.

The GOP plan, which would trim $52 billion
from the $200 billion-plus federal deficit next year,
also would halve the increase in defense spending
that Reagan first recommended. However, it en
dorses many of the deep spending cuts in domestic
programs that he sought.
Senate Democrats are expected to move to try to
strike the Social Security cap from the budget — a
move that backers of the plan say could cause the
entire package to unravel.
The Social Security proposal would limit cost-of
living increases for Social Security recipients to 2
percent over the next three years if annual inflation
is 4 percent or less. For higher rates, recipients
would get the inflationary increase minus two
percentage points.
In other action this week, a Senate Appropria
tions subcommittee tomorrow will review proposed
Reagan administration cuts in federal student aid.
And Senate permanent subcommittee on investiga
tions will hold three days of hearings, beginning to
morrow, on the government's system of security
clearances.
