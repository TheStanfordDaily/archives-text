Infant issue decided
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administra
tion ordered doctors and hospitals yesterday to
provide medically necessary treatment for
severely handicapped "Baby Doe" infants except
in cases where death appears inevitable.
The Department of Health and Human
Services released a final regulation covering the
so-called "Baby Doe" cases, infants with severe
or multiple handicaps might be denied necessary
medical treatment and allowed to die.
The regulations, which drew more than
116,000 comments from the public and special
interest groups, specify only three cases in which
doctors are justified in withholding medical treat
ment:
•When the infant is chronically and irreversibly
comatose.
•When treatment merely prolongs an inevitable
death.
•When treatment is so extreme and so likely to
be futile that it becomes inhumane to administer
it.
HHS Secretary Margaret Heckler, in a state
ment released with the regulations, said the final
rule "reflects a careful balance between the need
to establish effective protection of the rights of
disabled infants and the need to avoid unreason
able governmental intrusion into the practice of
medicine and parental responsibilities."
The Baby Doe rules are named after a highly
publicized 1982 case in Bloomington, Ind., in
which treatment was withheld from a newborn

infant suffering severe handicaps.
The administration at that time attempted to
enact a regulation requiring such treatment, but
was stopped by the courts. Congress stepped in
and passed legislation last year authorizing the
rules. The new regulations are based on that law;
they go into effect in 30 days.
Heart leaking blood
LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Jack Burcham was
rushed back into surgery yesterday where doctors
stopped the bleeding in his left chest cavity after
he lost at least 21 pints of blood during his first
night with an artificial heart.
Blood had seeped from stitches in synthetic
fabric that binds the aorta with the Jarvik-7
pump in Burcham's chest cavity, said Dr. Allan
Lansing, spokesman for the artificial heart im
plant team at Humana Hospital Audubon.
The power of the Jarvik-7 pump may have
strained the sutures, forcing a loss of at least 21
pints of blood during the night, Lansing said.
Earlier, he said the stitches were strained
during Sunday's struggle to implant the Jarvik-7
pump in Burcham's chest cavity, which was
smaller than doctors had expected.
Chief surgeon William DeVries opted for a
new incision in Burcham's chest, rather than
reopening the incision he cut in implanting the
device on Sunday, and that allowed a different
angle of the mechanical heart, Lansing said.
It also gave DeVries a clear view of the rear of
Burcham's aorta, and blood could be seen

seeping through stitches at the rear of the aorta,
Lansing said.
"Every little needle hole showed a tiny little
leak through it," Lansing said.
Inmates take over prison
ODENVILLE, Ala. — Hundreds of inmates
took control of a section of a state prison yester
day, holding the warden and 21 other people
hostage for more than 10 hours before releasing
all the captives unharmed, officials said.
Five employees were injured, including two
who were beaten unconscious.
About 200 inmates seized guns and fired shots
when they took over a central records office at
the 1,000-prisoner St. Clair County Correctional
Facility about 9:29 a.m:, intially trapping about
40 guards and employees, officials said.
At 8 p.m., however, state officials announced
the siege. "All of the hostages have been released
and the uprising is effectively over," said Billy
Joe Camp, press secretary to Gov. George
Wallace, whose Capitol office in Montgomery
monitored the day : long inmate rebellion.
Market climbs slightly
Stock prices edged upward yesterday, starting
a new week on a hesitant note. The Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials rose 1.10 to 1,266.78 by
2 p.m. on Wall Street.
