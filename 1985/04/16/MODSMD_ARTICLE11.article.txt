Fire hits computer firm
LOS ANGELES — The largest losses in a
$200,000 fire on the 18th floor of the downtown
Crocker Center tower were suffered by an Ohio
based firm that provides a computer information
network, officials said yesterday.
Most of the damage occurred early yesterday
in the offices of Mead Data Central, a Dayton
firm that provides the Nexis computer network to
paid subscribers, said Mead spokeswoman
Sharon Peake.
The fire was reported shortly before 1 a.m.
yesterday and was visible from the street, said
fire department spokesman Larry Ford. More
than 60 firefighters battled the West Sixth Street
blaze and brought it under control at 1:32 a.m.,
he said.
Belt-bag bill passes
SAC RAMENTO — A bill that would require
motorists to buckle their seat belts and
automakers to put air bags in future cars was ap
proved yesterday by the state Assembly.
The bill, backed by insurance firms and safety

groups, was sent to the Senate by a 46-29 vote,
after the author, Assembly Speaker Willie
Brown, said it would help make ordinary cars as
safe as race cars.
A Senate vote on a rival seat belt measure
backed by automobile makers, SBSO by Sen.
John Foran (D-San Francisco) was delayed until
Thursday after opponents pushed through
several amendments on Foran's bill.
Brown's bill — and the Foran measure — were
prompted by a federal order issued last summer
by U.S. Transportation Secretary Elizabeth
Dole.
That order requires all cars sold in American
by 1990 to have passive restraints, which are
devices that protect occupants in crashes without
their action. These include air bags, which inflate
in a head-on crash, or automatic seatbelts, which
activate without the motorist manually buckling
them.
Hero wins dog food
LOS ANGELES — Rewards befitting valiance
came to Hero the dog yesterday as he was offi
cially honored for his loyalty in guarding a com-

panion caninc who had been hit by a car.
A year's supply of dog food, health insurance
from a veterinarian and the promise of obedience
training all were Hero's, who also received a
commendation certificate from Councilman Er
nani Bernardi.
Hero, named by the Marlatts, gained fame
March 31 when a Doberman was hit by a car in
North Hollywood. Hero refused to leave her
side, licking her wounds and barking at passers
by in an apparent attempt to get help.
The badly injured Doberman later had to be
put to sleep, and Hero was taken to a county
animal shelter where he was auctioned off when
no one claimed him.
Today's weather
Mostly cloudy with a chance of showers . Highs

chance of showers. Highs in the upper 50s and
