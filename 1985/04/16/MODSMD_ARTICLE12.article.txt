## Uncovering beaches that have no cover 
### 
Dear Bug Me:
Where is the nearest nude beach? -
Mr. Moto
The official statement on nude
beaches from the California Highway
Patrol and the state parks police is
that there aren't any around here:
"We don't do that type of activity
around here. Besides, my boss might
read the article if you quote me. He
might think I consider going to them.
In fact, he might be listening now, so
I'd better just hang up now, before I
get fired." That's one scared bureau
crat.
Of course, after calling these
offices I had a few unofficial names of
unofficial locations with allegedly lax
unofficial clothing rules. If you want
to go there unofficially, I'm sure it
will be all right. I'm probably the only
one who'll admit to that, though.
The most frequently mentioned
spot was the north end of Baker's
Beach, a one-and-a-half to two-mile
long stretch near the Presidio, with an
obstructed view of military housing
behind it and a "family" beach south
of it.
On a hot weekend like this last one,
there will be 2,000 to 3,000 regular
bathers and 200 to 300 liberated indi

viduals who take their rays straight,
according to a U.S. Park Service
police officer who patrols the area
and didn't want to be quoted.
He said that sometimes when his
department gets complaints, officers
will give out citations for something
like public display with intent of
obscenity, but that usually they just
shoo nude bathers to the end of the
beach.

The other location is more elusive.
After questioning four or five offi
cials, I can only say that a place called
either Grey Whale Cove or Nudi
Beach is located on Highway 1 near
Pacifica, or maybe four miles south of
it.
If you can wait until June 5, when

The Bay Guardian publishes its
yearly review of nude beaches, I'm
sure you'll be exposed to more
choices than a cautious fear of skin
cancer will let you sample.
I suggest about a 12 or 15
sunscreen early in the season and a
nice big paper bag for your head.
Why is the student ID card too big?
When you rip at the perforations, you
get a card that has to be cut to fit in the
wallet of anyone 1 know. - Howard
Trie key
Having called more than my share
of administrators and bureaucrats in
the last few months, I was surprised
by the simplicity of this answer.
Assoc. Registrar Bob Houghton
doesn't see any reason why the paper
can't be perforated to the universally
standard size of our friends the Visa
Card and the Sunday Flicks pass, and
he'll see what he can do about it
during the next revision of the PTR
form.
You're still not ready to throw out
those scissors, though? Get this; it
won't cost them anything extra to
make the change. What more could
they want than to perform a free
public image project?

Hopes not up yet? How about
Houghton's estimate that sometime
in the future, registration will be
carried out on lots of separate forms
instead of one amalgamation — a slip
for your meal plan, a couple different
sheets for your class list and identifi
cation numbers, a short but eloquent
line for tuition, and even a card-sized
card that will get you into Green and
do all sorts of useful things that good
cards do, like slipping easily into your
wallet.
And if the University doesn't com
ply with your demands, let me know.
1 want to be a forum for great social
issues, an instigator of crucial
reforms. If honest, card-bearing stu
dents are disgruntled, 1 say we get
masses of people mad about if, then
get them to put on silly hats or T
shirts with stupid sayings and have
them burn their ID-card trimmings in
a little bonfire in White Plaza; maybe
we could even roast a few marshmal
lows in effigy.
But that might be too harsh. Let's
just hope the powers that be don't
force us to do something that drastic.
Why aren't they selling Copicards at
the bookstore? I spent more than an
hour the other day going all over
trying to buy one and never could.
Isn't this a service the University
should provide hassle-free? Why is the
price of copies so high, anyway? - Ari
Levitt
Oh good. Another big controversy
over a little card.
I hate to break it to you, but the
bookstore isn't going to sell
Copicards any more.
According to the bookstore's fin
ancial controller, Patrick McDonald,
the bookstore was only an agent for
Orca, the company that makes the
cards. He said the bookstore was
probably the company's largest dis
tributor because of their location on
campus.
Bookstore administrators decided
to sell the cards as a service to the
University community as long as costs
were at the break-even point, but the
amount of time employees in the cus
tomer service department had to
spend checking cards that had mal
functioned became prohibitive.
Most Copicards are bought in the
first week of each quarter, when
employees need to be dealing with
new textbooks, and McDonald said

that seemed to be a more important
service.
When bookstore managers realized
the problem existed, they decided
they would have to ask Orca for a
percentage of the profit which would
cover these extra costs. Orca decided
it couldn't accept this offer, so now
you'll have to search for your con
venient Copicard in a remote office in
Green Library, where Orca pays for
space in order to sell its cards.
McDonald claims that the library is
getting a larger cut than the
bookstore ever asked for, but no
Orca representative was available for
comment.
According to Roy Stampfli, head of

business and building services and the
library's representative in these
negotiations, Orca is trying to get
contracts with other groups on
campus, but he wouldn't indicate
which. His goal is to get a few more
machines to dispense the cards in the
libraries to improve service.
There is a Xerox machine in the
bookstore that only costs five cents a
copy, and that's your consumer bar
gain for the week. As Joe Carcione,
the green grocer, would say, "It's the
peak of Copicard season, so be sure
you buy for freshness and flavor."
Asparagus looks good, too.
