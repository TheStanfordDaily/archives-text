# Open America's doors

Illegal immigration is a growing problem in the United
States, particularly in the West, where refugees from Asia
and Latin America are drawn from underdeveloped and
politically unstable regions. If left unaddressed, many feel
the problem will grow in rancor into the next century, as
the chasm widens between American prosperity and
Third World poverty.
Current legal immigration to the United States is held
beneath an annual limit of 270,000. Clearly this ceiling
cannot support demand. Thailand's refugee camps, alone,
now hold 180,000 Vietnamese, Cambodians and Laotians
who await transport to the United States. Legislators feel
we have lost control of our borders. During the 19705, 3.5
million immigrants entered the United States illegally.
Every year, 1 million Latin American immigrants are
turned back at the Mexican border. At least that number,
however, fully 3,000 people every day, cross into the
United States illegally. A preference system gives priority
to political refugees and immigrants from developed
regions, effectively restricting immigration from under-

developed regions. The result
is that those who are most des
perate to escape poverty and
war have little choice but to
immigrate to the United
States illegally.
Debate has varied greatly
over how to staunch the flow
of immigrants.There is agree
ment only in that something
must be done soon. Proposed
solutions aim at containing le
gal immigration at near cur
rent levels while sharply cur-

tailing illegal immigration, particularly among Latin
American immigrants who stream across America's
southern borders.
The Simpson-Mazzoli bill, which failed in Congress last
summer, proposed economic sanctions against employers
who hire illegal immigrants, intending to dry up the jobs
which draw immigrants across the border. Simpson-
Mazzoli was opposed by the farm lobby, which needs ille
gal immigrants as cheap labor, as well as Hispanic groups,
which resent singling out Hispanic immigrants for legal
scrutiny. Simpson-Mazzoli would prove little more than a
patch over the problem. The bill proposes to raise slightly
the ceiling on immigration from Mexico, but far below
demand. Employers will continue to hire illegals as cheap
labor. Denied the opportunity for legal immigration,
Latin Americans will continue to immigrate to the United
States illegally.
Nonetheless, a streamlined version of the original
Simpson-Mazzoli bill appears likely to pass this year, not as
a solution to the problem but as the only bill possible
given the fixed interests.
One solution to the problem of illegal immigration, ob
vious in its absence from the political debate, is to throw
open America's doors to immigrants. The surest way to
end illegal immigration is to make immigration legal and
available to all who seek it. /
A basic problem with an open-door policy is that
Americans don't like immigrants. They perceive them as a
lawless element, threatening the cultural unity of the
country with their diversity and separateness. Americans
also resent immigrants as a burden on society, believing
they take jobs from native Americans, swell the welfare
rolls, crowd the cities and strain social services with
demands for housing, education and healthcare.
More than 60 percent of Americans favor reduced im
migration and deportation of illegal "aliens." Mispercep
tions aside, this mistrust of immigrants is ironic consider
ing America's heritage as a nation of immigrants â€” one
third of Americans today are the grandchildren or the
great-grandchildren of immigrants. But it is not new.

America opened her doors to cheap labor in the 19th cen
tury, but soon closed them to specific racial groups, estab
lishing national-origin quotas for the then less-desirable
Eastern and Southern European immigrants. In 1917, an
"Asiatic Barred Zone" was imposed on Asian im
migrants.
America's attitude toward immigration has been one of
pulling up the ladder behind us. Surges in population
through immigration threaten the prosperity of the group
by dividing the economic pie among a greater number.
The view, held by many Americans, that immigrants are a
burden to the state and a threat to society is difficult to
disprove: A surge in population from immigration will
certainly test the resources and adaptability of our nation,
as has all population growth. However, such a view is
cynically flawed in assuming America has reached the
limits of growth. And the view is more difficult to prove:
true when one considers the historical effects of immigra
tion in America.
Since the mid-19th century, immigrants have been the

economic and cultural catalyst
to our society, helping to
produce prosperity rather
than to dilute it. Immigrants
have been the steam driving
our great industrial machine.
Irish, Italian, Jewish and
Asian immigrants built
America's railroads, manned
her factories, '.oiled her steel
and worked her soil. Im
migrants came to America to
work, asking not a hand-out,
but a hand up to opportunity.

Often unskilled, illiterate and lacking a proficiency in En
glish, immigrants do not take jobs from Americans. They
fill jobs most Americans will not: as janitors, dish was
hers, stoop laborers and domestic servants.
Problems have arisen from immigrants who refuse to
assimilate into the American mainstream. This has been.
particularly evident among groups of illegal immigrants
who, lacking a legal place in society, withdraw into cul
tural neighborhoods and follow a transitory course. Im
migrants given rights and protection under the law as
citizens sink roots, often becoming America's best
citizens. Rather than lawless, they are law-abiding.
Having fled poverty and persecution, they are more ap
preciative of freedoms and opportunities they have gained
than those native Americans have enjoyed since birth.
Immigrants infuse society with values of family, hard
work, thrift and education, working to send their children
to school and to college, becoming that generation's doc T
tors, teachers and professionals.
A study by Barry Cheswick of the Hoover Institution
showed that within 16 years of coming to Amrica most
immigrants earn as much as the average native American.
Many must rely initially on welfare to stand on their feet
in a new land. Some, however, remain a permanent
welfare class. If America is to open her doors to im
migrants, she must ensure that immigrants are not com
mitted to second class citizenship. To be accorded full
rights as citizens, immigrants must be willing to assume
full responsibilities as productive members of society. A
testable proficiency in English required for citizenship
would encourage immigrants to assimilate with American
society and guarantee more worthwhile civil participation.
America can regain control of its borders but not by
compromising its moral position as refuge for the world's
hungry and downtrodden. America must look to its heri
tage and again open its doors to all who desire to share in
its dream of opportunity and freedom.
