STOP has same right
The letter from Brett Glass (The
Daily, April 5) asserts that the STOP
protest against Playboy's visit to
Stanford threatens "my (and
Playboy's) First Amendment rights."
I strongly disagree. To start at the
most pedantic level, the First
Amendment of our Constitution
limits governmental action, not
private behavior. I assure you that I
would complain loudly if the federal
government were to try to ban
Playboy from the mails, or if state or
local governments were to bar the
sale of the magazine under any anti
pornography regulations I have seen
enacted or proposed. But all that
STOP complains about is behavior
by private entities — Playboy and
those who cooperate with it. And
STOP itself is a private group. The
First Amendment is not directly
involved.
More basically, 1 would argue that
STOPs activities are themselves
exercises of core First Amendment
rights, just as Brett Glass' anti-STOP
letter is. As Justice William Douglas
once put it, a "function of free
speech under our system of govern
ment is to invite dispute. It may
indeed best serve its high purpose
when [it] creates dissatisfaction with
conditions as they are, or even stirs
people to anger. Speech is often
provocative and challenging. It may
strike at prejudices and preconcep
tions and have profound unsettling

effects as it presses for acceptance of
an idea." I think that description fits
the First Amendment-protected
behavior of STOP, just as it does the
letter of Brett Glass.
I should add that I am a signer of
one of the anti-Playboy petitions that
has been circulated. I don't like, and
therefore complain about, portrayals
of women that perpetuate sexual
stereotypes and ultimately contribute
to sex discrimination — even though
I strongly oppose, on First Amend
ment grounds, proposed ordinances
that, on the basis of similar percep
tions, would ban the distribution of
such "bad-stereotype"-promoting
depictions.

Save the capital fee
Last week, The Daily's editorials
criticized the ASSU, and particularly
the senate, for being unable to ac
complish anything constructive or
which would benefit students and
student groups. Unfortunately, The
Daily's anti-ASSU hysteria lead it to
editorially oppose something which
would do just that: the proposed
capital fee assessment constitutional
amendment.
This amendment creates a mecha
nism for the student body to vote on
multi-year fee assessments for capital
improvements which would benefit
the student body. In particular, if

passed, it would expedite the con
struction of additional office space
for student organizations as part of
the Tresidder Union expansion plan.
Capital fees could also be sought for
projects such as the renovation of
the Old Firehouse and reconstruc
tion of the Lagunita Boathouse.
The capital fee amendment has
broad support both within and
outside the ASSU. It has been en
dorsed by individuals associated with
the following organizations: the
Black Student Union, Tresidder
Union Board, Tuesday Films, the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance, the Vien
nese Ball Committee and the Charity
Carnival. We urge students not to let
their anger with the ASSU prevent
them from voting for something of
genuine benefit to students.

Daily schizophrenia
The Daily Editorial Board is
clearly schizophrenic. On March 7,
The Daily editorial claimed, "The
ASSU Senate made a good decision
Tuesday night in voting to place on
the spring ballot Senator Mark
Soble's bill to eliminate all cash
refunds on fee assessments. The
current system of refunds distorts the
funding process and makes the fee

assessments unfair and inefficient."
The editorial board concluded that
Constitutional Amendment 14 "will
leave us all better off in the long
run."
Last Friday, The Daily Editorial
Board contended that Constitutional
Amendment 14 "stems from a
genuine student need." Then the
editorial board said: Vote No.
Amendment 14 is not just a
"bureaucratic fine-tuning" of the
ASSU constitution. It is a major and
substantial change. In fact, the pro
posal has generated enough interest
to get the Stanford Undergraduate
Student Association to endorse the
amendment, and to get Stanford
Libertarians to oppose it.
I would like to encourage The Daily
Editorial Board to change its posi
tion on Amendment 14. Such an
action would demonstrate that there
is in fact a correlation between the
analysis and the recommendation
that was made by The Daily Edito
rial Board.

Constitutional Amendment 14 "will
leave us all better off in the long
run."
Last Friday, The Daily Editorial
Board contended that Constitutional
Amendment 14 "stems from a
genuine student need." Then the
editorial board said: Vote No.
Amendment 14 is not just a
"bureaucratic fine-tuning" of the
ASSU constitution. It is a major and
substantial change. In fact, the pro
posal has generated enough interest
to get the Stanford Undergraduate
Student Association to endorse the
amendment, and to get Stanford
Libertarians to oppose it.
I would like to encourage The Daily
Editorial Board to change its posi
tion on Amendment 14. Such an
action would demonstrate that there
is in fact a correlation between the
analysis and the recommendation
that was made by The Daily Edito
rial Board.
