### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
On the eve of the ASSU election, the Blue
Chip, 4-C and Hammer and Coffin Slates for
Council of Presidents met last night in a debate
broadcast by KZSU.
Running on the premise that the ASSU is a
group of "power-hungry tards," the H & C Slate
intends to revamp the senate, according to slate
member Tim Quirk.
"We are not opposed to the senate, but the
way it is run now," said H & C member Andy
Frisch.
The Blue Chip Slate sees itself as the "middle
of-the-road" slate, according to Blue Chip mem
ber Kenneth Ramberg.
The slate hopes "to work within the system
and re-arrange the senate," Ramberg said. He
gave examples of rewriting the constitution and
improving communication between the
"different groups" within the ASSU.
Michael Schenkman, another Blue Chip mem
ber, said smaller groups must not lose their voice,
which would be the case if the senate were dis
solved.
Randy Cribbs was the sole 4-C Slate member
at yesterday's debate. The slate also comprises
Eugene Chen, currently an ASSU senator, Laura
Corser and Hubert Cheng.
Cribbs said his slate does not "represent the
establishment," despite the fact that he is the
only 4-C Slate member without previous experi
ence in the ASSU.
"We are different people in diverse interests
and fields,' 1 . Cribbs said.
In response to the recent criticisms voiced
about the ASSU, Cribbs said, "I don't think it's
as major as The Daily and the H & C have made
it out to be. The majority of people I've talked to
think it (the ASSU) has done a fairly good job."

The three slates all agreed that too much red
tape exists in the group funding process.
"We would like to simplify the process," said
Blue Chip member Noah Croom. For example,
the Blue Chip slate would have a program board
make decisions and have the senate vote on its
recommendations, he said.
Cribbs agreed with the Blue Chip platform,
and added that the ASSU should not have the
power to split a group's fee assessment proposal.
H & C concurred with the other two slates.
"We don't plan to change how the groups get
funded through the program board," Frisch said.
But H & C does intend "to clean out" all the
students who hinder the board rather than
help it, Quirk said.

Danny Pearl, KZSU's moderator for the
debate, asked what assurance the student body
has that, if elected, all slate members will remain
in office for their entire term.
Cribbs said his slate members have shown their
dedication to the ASSU by actively and respon
sibly participating in it.
Blue Chip member Ramherg said his slate
would ensure fulfillment and commitment, be
cause they "are a dedicated group of sophomores
who will have to live with the changes they in
stitute-'].. Xy.
The H & C slate has made a pact to kill all
slate members if one fails to fulfill his or her
duties, said Leslie Leland, the third H & C mem
ber present at the debate. H & C member Mi
chael Collins was not present.
