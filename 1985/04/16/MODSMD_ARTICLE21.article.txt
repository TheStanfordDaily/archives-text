## Card takes top ranking to Santa Clara 
### TOM SENF Staff sports writer 
Its No. 1 ranking still intact, the
Stanford baseball team travels to
Ssnta Clara today for a 2:30 p.m.
contest with the Santa Clara Broncos.
After falling to Arizona 7-5 Friday,
Stanford sio:med back to win the
final two games of the series, 20-8
and 11-1. Despite the one loss, the
Cardinal's two lopsided victories con
vinced the ESPN/Collegiate Baseball
pollsters to keep Stanford at the top
of the rankings.
-In fact, all three of the nationally
ranked teams in the Pacific 10 South
ern Division held their positions. Cal
ifornia remained at No. 12, and
Arizona stayed at No. 26.
Stanford's two wins upped its Six-
Pac mark to 14-4. Cal, which won
two of three games against UCLA
last weekend, is two games back at
12-6. Arizona is fourth with a 8-10
record, two games behind third-place
Arizona State, which swept USC this
weekend.
The Cardinal abused the Wildcat
pitching staff for 36 runs and 40 hits
over the weekend. Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess, who was concerned
with his team's firepower at the
beginning of the season, got offensive
production from almost his entire
lineup against Arizona.
Pete Stanicek continued to do his
job as the leadoff man, going 7-for
-12 with three walks, three stolen
bases and eight runs scored. He even
added a home run on Sunday.
Mark Davis had another outstand
ing series. He was 6-for-12 with a
homer and five RBIs — a typical per
formance for the Six-Pac's leading
hitter.
Although his part in Saturday's
bench-clearing brawl got him a lot of
attention, Rick Lundblade did a lot
more to the Arizona staff with his bat
than with his fists. The senior first
baseman was 5-for-10 with a homer
and seven RBIs.

Known better as a power hitter,
Lundblade has quietly raised his
average to .378 to go along with his
team-leading 12 homers and 48
RBIs. "It was time to boost the
average a little bit," he said of his
recent concentration on average
rather than power.
Catcher John Ramos said the
Wildcats were trying to get him out
with fastballs up and away. Based on
what he's done to Arizona, it's time
for the Wildcats to come up with a
new strategy. In six games against
Arizona this year, Ramos has three
home runs and 13 RBIs.
Next to Davis, who has been spec
tacular consistently, Walt Harris has
probably been Stanford's most con

sistent hitter in 1985. Five more hits
last weekend left his average at .357.
The junior leftfielder has been over
.300 since the first week of the
season.
What's the key to Harris' consis
tency?
"Staying within myself, doing what
I do best: hitting the ball hard on a
line," he said.
Santa Clara has a little offensive
punch of its own. The Broncos are
currently 35-17, 8-6 in the West
Coast Athletic Conference. They split
two games with the Cardinal earlier
in the season.

By "hitting the ball hard on a line," outfielder Walt Harris has kept his batting average above .300 since the
first week of the season.
