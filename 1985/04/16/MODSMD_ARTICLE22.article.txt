### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
Arizona pitcher Mike Young,
struck in the face by a batted ball
Friday, will undergo surgery later
this week at the Stanford Medical
Center.
Young, a 20-year-old left
hander, suffered a fractured arch
under his left eye when he was hit
by a second-inning line-drive off
the bat of Toi Cook. He was taken
immediately to the medical center,
where he will remain until at least
the end of the week, depending on
when the surgery is performed.
Young had X-rays taken today
and is currently in stable condi
tion.
A first-round.draft choice of the
Chicago White Sox when he
graduated from Rolling Hills High

in Rancho Palos Verdes, Young
was the ace of the Arizona pitch
ing staff before his injury. He was
8-4, and his 4.17 ERA and three
complete games were team bests.
Both Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess and Asst. Coach Dean
Stotz said they thought Young
would be a first-round pick again.
Young was also one of the finest
pitchers in the Pacific 10 Southern
Division. He was tied for the con
ference lead in wins with
teammate Joe Magrane and Stan
ford's Jeff Ballard. His 86.1 in
nings pitched trailed only Magrane
and Ballard, and he was tied for
second in strikeouts with Ballard.
Although Young's 1985 season
is over, Arizona's trainer, R. Scott
Reynolds, said there would prob
ably be no permanent damage to
Young's sight.
