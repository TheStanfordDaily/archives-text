# Stanford finishes 12th at King's Point
## Sailing team sinks in East 
### GEOFF SANBORN Editorial staff 
With only four weeks remaining before the
start of the Pacific Coast Championships in
Redwood City, the Stanford sailing team
looks like it will have to fight to qualify for the
national championships. ~
The Cardinal suffered through what Coach
Joe Petrucci called "our weakest regatta so
far" this weekend in the Admiral's Cup at
King's Point, N.Y., finishing 12th out of 18
schools. King's Point Service Academy, the
No. 1-ranked team in the country and the
host of this weekend's competition, took first
place in the regatta, followed by Tufts in
second and Navy in third.
"The competition was more than intense,"
Petrucci said. "Everyone there was ranked in
the top 20. And in this level of competition, if
you don't perform well, you'll get eaten
alive."
The only Cardinal sailor who didn't get
completely cannibalized in King's Point was B
skipper Tom Kuhnle. With crew Marika Fus
sganger, Kuhnle won two of his 18 races over
the weekend — the only races won by any
Stanford sailor.
"The conditions in New York were a lot
like they are back home," said Kuhnle, a
Seattle native. "It was cold, blowy and the
wind was shifting radically — it shifted 180
degrees on Saturday.
"Personally, I thought I could have done

better," he continued. "But the East Coast
schools were a lot more intense than we are.
You have to really get psyched for that kind
of competition."
East Coast schools did dominate the
regatta, but Stanford was also outperformed
by three key West Coast rivals. UC-Irvine
finished a strong fourth, (JSC came in seventh
and Long Beach State placed ninth.
Only two California teams — the two top
finishers in the Pacific Coast Championships
here at the Stanford Sailing Center May 11-
13 — will advance to the North American
Championships in June. The competition be
tween Stanford, Irvine, USC and Long Beach
for those two spots should be fierce, according
to Petrucci.
"It's safe to say that (the Pacific Coast
Championships) are going to be an absolute
bloodbath," Petrucci said. "Our approach has
been that only two things matter — the
qualifiers and the nationals."
Petrucci considered the King's Point
regatta merely a "preparation for the
qualifiers," and so although he was disap
pointed by the showing, he was not dishear
tened.
"We've got a lot of unrealized potential,"
he said. "We have the players, and it's just a
matter of putting the hot players in at the
right time."
Petrucci experimented with a few different
skipper-crew combinations this weekend.

Regular A skipper Rich Bergsund alternated
with senior Rod Turner at the helm of the A
boat, Irma Rodriguez and Fussganger
switched off crewing the B boat for Kuhnle,
and Albert Boyce substituted for skipper
Gordon Wanlass of the C boat.
By the time the Pacific Coast Champion
ships roll around, Petrucci hopes to have
more of a set lineup. Because the champion
ships are at home, he is optimistic about his
team's chances.
"Sailing in the boats we sail in every day, on
the course we sail every day ... we should
qualify," Petrucci said.
Stanford has qualified in three of the last
five years for the nationals in the dinghy com
petition, and is the defending district cham
pion in three-boat team racing. The Cardinal
finished seventh at the nationals in three-boat
team racing last year.
Beginning now, according to Turner, the
team will start putting in a "much more in
tense effort. We've been practicing two days a
week, and we're going to have to go to four
days a week for the rest of the time until
qualifiers.
"We're going to have to concentrate more
on specific areas in practice," Turner contin
ued. "If we can work on particular sailing sit
uations long enough so that when we get into
them in a race we can react by instinct, we'll
be doing all right."
