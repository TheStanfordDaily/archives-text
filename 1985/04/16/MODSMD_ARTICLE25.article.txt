LAS VEGAS (AP) â€” Marvelous Mar
vin Hagler knocked down Thomas "Hit
Man" Hearns and stopped him at 2:01 of
the third round of a savage fight for
Hagler's undisputed middleweight title last
night.
Just moments after a doctor had been
called into the ring to examine a bad cut
over Hagler's right eye, the champion hurt
Hearns with a right to the head and un
leashed a barrage that dropped the chal
lenger. Hearns struggled up, but referee
Richard Steele looked at him and stopped
the bout.
In terms of action, it had to be one of the
great, great fights. It more than lived up to
the tremendous hype that preceded it.
"There is no doubt in my mind I will
knock out Tommy Hearns," the 30-year
old Hagler said before his 11th defense.
From the opening bell, that's what
Hagler set out to do.
Hagler attacked and attacked and at
tacked. The 6-foot-1 Hearns, the World
Boxing Council super-welterweight cham
pion, fought back and fought back and
fought back until he was simply over
whelmed by the savagery of the champion.
Hearns, who threw every punch in his
arsenal but could not hold Hagler off,
ripped a cut open over Hagler's right eye
in the first round. Then the champion had
a cut beneath the eye and his face was a
bloody mess.

It looked for a moment as if Hearns
would become champion earlier when
Steele stopped the action with blood
streaming down Hagler's face and ring
doctor Donald Romeo examined the cut as
the crowd of 16,034 at the outdoor arena
voiced its displeasure.
Romeo told Steele to lei the tight con
tinue and Hagler quickly took advantage
of his reprieve.
Hagler landed a tremendous right to the
jaw that sent Hearns reeling backward.
The champion, his bald pate glistening
with sweat, pounced like a hungry cat and
threw a volley of hard punches. Hearns
went down flat on his back.
Hearns struggled up just before Steele
could reach 10, then Steele quickly waved
that Hagler was still champion.
"He didn't bother me." Hagler said
after the fight. "I had to take some to give
some, but he got some too. I put my all in
it. The better man won."
Hagler had shown signs of slipping in
going 15 rounds with Roberto Duran and a
hard 10 with Juan Roldan. But he certainly
didn't look like a faded fighter on this
night.
After a little more than eight minutes of
action, Marvelous Marvin Hagler stood in
the ring, three championship belts draped
over his heaving chest. He looked bat
tered but he looked every inch the cham
pion he is.
