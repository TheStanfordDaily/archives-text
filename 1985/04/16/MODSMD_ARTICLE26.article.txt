ST. LOUIS (AP) â€” All-Star shortstop
Ozzie Smith yesterday became what his agent
claimed was baseball's highest-paid player by
agreeing to a four-year contract extension
through 1989 with the St. Louis Cardinals.
"In terms of dollars and cents, it makes him
the highest-paid player," said Ed Gottlieb,
the infielder's agent. "I think the highest con
tracts are (Mike) Schmidt and (George)
Foster at $2 million. Ozzie's contract for the
four-year extension is in excess of $2 mil
lion."
Negotiations with Smith had begun in ear
nest last month, and at one time it appeared
likely he would be traded.

"I'm happy and hopefully the organization
is happy. It's a great day," said Smith. "At
one time, it didn't look good. I have great
memories here."
Gottlieb said the final negotiating point was
a provision permitting Smith to buy a dis
tributorship from Anheuser-Busch Co. Inc.,
owner of the Cardinals. He will work for the
brewery beginning with the next off-season.
Gottlieb said the provision was worked out
late last week, with final details ironed out
yesterday morning. He said his client's con
tract was guaranteed, meaning the club will
pay Smith even if he is incapacitated by in
jury.
