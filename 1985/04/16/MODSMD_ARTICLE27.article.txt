suring that the race for the title in the
U.S. Cycling Federation's (USCF)
Western Section will be a close one.
The Cardinal scored 201 points at
the King City Road Race Saturday,
and 202 points at the San Ardo Road
Race Sunday, beating runner-up
Santa Barbara by nearly 20 points in
both races.

currently in a very close battle for
first place in the USCFs Western
Section. Both teams have scored
more than 200 points in each of at
least four races, but the Cardinal has
beaten Santa Barbara in three of the

five races in which they have faced

edge out Santa Barbara for the title.

riders — Brad Chen, Art Walker,
Eric Topp and Russell Mead — con
tinued to work together well this
weekend, beating strong challenges
from Santa Barbara and California
riders and defying 90-degree Salinas
Valley heat in both races. Walker
won the King City race with a strong
finishing sprint and finished fifth in
San Ardo, while Chen placed seventh
and third, respectively.

Katrin Tobin made winning look
easy, as she took both races in the
women's division. Teammate Laura
Rodman took fourth in both races.
Stanford's novices were led by
Mike Collins, who won Saturday's
race and placed 10th on Sunday, Tom
Moyer, who placed fourth in both
races, and novice B rider Ken
Aldape, who placed fifth on Saturday
and won the San Ardo race on Sun
day.
The team also announced plans for
races it is sponsoring on April 27-28.
The Stanford Criterium will be held
April 27 on a course around Wilbur
