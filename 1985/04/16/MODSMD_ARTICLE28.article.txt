# Cardinal lands golf recruit
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN Editorial staff 
If nothing else, Tim Baldwin knows how to
attract the women.
In Baldwin's six years as Stanford's
women's golf coach, he has brought more
quality high school golfers to the Farm than
any one school should be allowed to have.
Kathy Kostas, Kathleen McCarthy, Kay Cor
nelius, Trish McGonigle and Anna
Oxenstierna — all were among the highest
rated high school recruits on earth, and all fell
prey to the irresistible Baldwin recruiting
charm.

And now Baldwin can add another name to
that impressive list, and perhaps, in 1986, an
other NCAA tournament team to his resume.
Clare Dolan, a first-team high school All-
American from Gaithersburg, Md., has signed
a letter of intent to enroll at Stanford in the
fall and join the women's golf team.
"Clare is one of the top five high school
recruits in the world," Baldwin said.
"Although we return our entire team, Clare
will definitely see a lot of action her freshman
season. We are very pleased to have her join
our program."
Dolan, the Cardinal's only recruit for the

1985-86 season, will join junior Kostas, soph
omore McCarthy and freshmen Cornelius,
McGonigle and Oxenstierna next season to
round out what will probably be the most for
midable — and youthful — lineup in the pro
gram's history. \
In August 1984, Dolan won the NaCional
PGA Junior Championship at Palm Beach
Gardens, Fla., in a three-hole playoff with
Cheryl Morley of Winter Springs, Fla. She
was named a first-team AU-American by Golf
Digest and the American Junior Golf Associ
ation and is currently a member of the Na
tional Honor Society.

the SASA, the Business School and Kappa Sigma, continues
on Thursday and Friday. The matches begin at 5:30 p.m.,
and are open to the public.
