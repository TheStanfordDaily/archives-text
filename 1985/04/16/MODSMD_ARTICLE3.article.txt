## 
### JOYA WESLEY Staff writer 
Polls open today at 9 a.m. to al
low students to elect next year's
ASSU Senate, Council of Presidents
and senior class presidents.
Students will also decide whether
to approve nine constitutional
amendments and fee assessments
for 17 different student groups.
Thirty-one candidates will com
pete for 20— 10 regular and 10 al
ternate — undergraduate senate
positions. Ten candidates will seek
election to 20 graduate positions.
The remainder of the graduate posi
tions will be filled by write-in candi
dates.
Three slates are vying for the
Council of Presidents.
The Blue Chip Slate comprises
Brad Hinrichs, Noah Croom and
Kenneth Ramberg, all members of
the Sigma Chi fraternity, and Mi
chael Schenkman, an administrative
assistant for the current COP.
Senator Eugene Chen heads the
4-C Slate, which also includes Her
bert Cheng, ASSU Lecture Notes
manager; Laura Corser, director of
ASSU internships; and Randy
Cribbs, coordinator of the Stanford
Volunteer Network's Reach Out
Today project.
Finally, the Hammer and Coffin
Slate is Andy Frisch, Michael Col
lins, Leslie Leland and Tim Quirk.
The H & C Slate, a traditional pres
ence in COP elections, is affiliated

with the Chaparral, the campus
humor magazine.
Six slates are running for senior
class presidents.
Funding for 17 groups, totaling
$12.44 per student per quarter, will
be decided in the special fee elec
tions. These assessments, pending
their approval, will be added to the
approximately $5 per quarter Asso
ciation Fee.
The largest individual fee re
quests come from KZSU, whose
per-person figure would come to
$1.49 per quarter, the Speakers
Bureau, with $1.53, and ASSU Le
gal Counseling, with $1.30.
Of the nine constitutional amend
ments on today's ballot, only two
have received much attention.
Constitutional Amendment 14, if
approved, would eliminate cash
refunds of special fees.
The amendment's sponsor,
Senator Mark Soble, says the elimi
nation of cash refunds would result
in a 30-percent decrease in the
overall fee. According to Soble, trns
decrease would benefit the entire
student body, as opposed to the
small percentage of it which now
receives refunds.
The other major amendment,
Constitutional Amendment 9,
would allow for the establishment or
a capital fee system which would
facilitate such expenditures as the
renovation of the Boathouse and the
construction of more office space for
student groups in Tresidder Union.
The amount of this fee would be
determined and approved by the sen
ate and the student body.
Constitutional Amendment 11 was
written in response to the current
COP's decision not to replace COP
member Alice Wells after she
resigned this year. The amendment
would require the COP to fill any va
cancy within 14 days of its occur
rence.
Constitutional Amendments 12, 15
and 16 deal with procedures for call

ing special elections for amendments,
referendums, recalls and initiatives.
All three would increase the number
of signatures necessary on petitions to
call special elections for any of
actions.
Constitutional Amendment 13 is a
measure to remove power from the
University Board of Trustees con
cerning constitutional amendments.
The remaining two amendments,
17 and 10, would change some of the
constitution's wording without chang
ing any of its meaning, supporters
say. No. 10 will eliminate gender
specific terminology, and No. 17 will
move the contents of a by-law into
the constitution itself.
Students may vote from 9 a.m. un
til midnight at various polling sites on
campus.
