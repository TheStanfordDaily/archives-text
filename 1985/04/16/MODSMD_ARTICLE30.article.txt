## 'Lost in America': appealing Yuppie comedy 
### STEVE VINEBERG Editorial staff 
"The Big Chill" was a cautionary
(and hypocritical) fable about the
evils of Yuppiedom and the need to
preserve the ideals of the 19605. Both
"The Sure Thing" and "Desperately
Seeking Susan" contain Yuppie char
acters in important supporting roles,
but they function in the place of their
stuffed-shirt predecessors in screw
ball comedies — to provide a contrast
with the hero, so that the heroine, re
alizing what a mistake she's made by
allowing herself to be straitjacketed
in a dead relationship, can move her
self (and the plot) forward. But "Lost
in America" is the first real comedy
about Yuppies, and it has an entirely
new kind of energy, because the
director-star, Albert Brooks (who
also co-authored the script, with Mar
cia Johnson), doesn't make movies
like anyone else in the world. His last
picture, "Modern Romance" (I've
never seen his first, "Real Life"),
which he also starred in, was a
weirdly muted examination of the
end of an affair, and for the first half
— before the main character's ob
sessive ness about the woman who's
left him began to wear our patience
down — it was hilarious, though in
ways difficult to explain. The humor
didn't punch in, it wasn't cumulative,
and though it clearly derived from the
eccentricities of the protagonist's
style, there were many glitches in his
behavior not attributable to any
reasonable motive, and perhaps that,
as much as any other element in the
movie, was the source of the laughter.
1 noticed in "Lost in America," too,
that not everyone in the theater was
laughing at the same lines, but every
one was laughing at something. The
paradox at the heart of Brooks' style
$s a comedian and as a filmmaker —
his affectless intensity — turns out to
be the perfect instrument for getting
On screen (and sending up) a new
wrinkle on the American sociocul
tural canvas.
• Brooks plays David Howard, who
banks on capping eight years at a big
time advertising agency in Los An
geles (the last two spent in the
capacity of "creative director") with a
promotion his boss has practically
promised him. David and his wife
Linda (Julie Hagerty), a personnel
manager, have bought a new house in
anticipation of their ascent to this
new social and economic plateau,
though both are experiencing severe
anxiety, too; they feel tied into the

future they've worked toward,
robbed of their freedom to control
the course of the rest of their lives.
But David lands a transfer instead of
a promotion, and he's so furious at his
treatment that he explodes in his em
ployer's office and ends up fired.
(This scene recalls Gene Hackman's
rebellion against his boss in the 1981
"All Night Long," another comic
original, but the movies couldn't be
farther apart in tone or style.) Res
ponding manically to this turn of
events, David decides that fate has
freed him and Linda up to drop out of
society, like the heroes of his favorite
movie, "Easy Rider," so he per
suades her to quit her job; they li
quidate all their assets, buy a motor
home and drive off to look for
America and themselves.
Brooks and Johnson aren't writing
off the top of their heads; they have
literary and cinematic models, and
that explains why "Lost in America"
has such a classical feeling to it,
despite its weird, dissociated ap
proach to comedy. (It also explains to
some extent why it's a much more
satisfying movie than "Modern
Romance.") The Howards are
sensitive enough to experience the
moral and esthetic dislocation in the
pattern of their lives, and complex
enough to struggle with it, but out on
the road in quest of their destiny, they
can't help thinking like Yuppies;
they're Reagan-era Babbitts. The
first shots of Brooks (whom we have
already heard on the phone with his
Mercedes dealer) behind the wheel of
his spanking new Winnebago, with
the Steppenwolf recording of "Born
to Be Wild" pounding on the
soundtrack, are priceless: A biker
pulls up beside him at an intersection,
and, feeling an immediate
camaraderie with this fellow free
spirit, David flashes him a "thumbs
up" sign from his elevated seat. He's
so wrapped up in his fantasy of the
open-road that he doesn't realize how
completely that cottage-sized vehicle,
with its built-in microwave oven,
makes him look like a slumming
monarch. (The biker answers him by
flipping him off.)
If one source of "Lost in America"
is Sinclair Lewis, the other is Preston
Sturges. The Howards are like the
filmmaker Joel McCrea played in
"Sullivan's Travels" who gives up
making trivial comedies and walks off
in search of the agonized, trod-upon
little man he wants to build his next
picture around, but who takes no real

risks — a studio van follows him at a
discreet distance to see that he
doesn't get into any real trouble.
David and Linda intend to spend the
first night of their new existence
camping out under the stars, and then
signal their regenerated commitment
to each other by walking through a
second wedding ceremony. But the
town they pick for this symbolic act is
Las Vegas, where blue neon bells
adorn the facade of the church they
plan to wed in, and they wind up
sleeping in the kitschy "junior bridal
suite" of an expensive hotel. The next
phase of the movie follows the
"Sullivan's Travels" model too. Sul
livan gets more than he bargained for
when a bum knocks him out, steals
his wallet and leaves him at the scene
of a crime; arrested, unable to prove
his identity, he lands in a chain gang
and discovers the down side of life
with a vengeance. The Howards
tumble into their own nightmare per
version of a wish come true when
Linda gambles away all their money

and they have to settle down wher
ever they stop for the night — Saf
ford, Arizona, as it happens — and
look for any kind of work they can
get.
The opening shot of "Lost in
America" (which was photographed
by Eric Saarinen) looks like a straight
version of Magritte's "The Empire of
Light," and there's something
Magrittish about this whole movie:
Brooks puts together scene after
scene that reproduces the veneer of
reality but is preposterous under
neath — cinema verite gone haywire.
Because Brooks' performing and
directorial style (austere flakiness) is
so completely his own and so
throughly worked out, and because
he is terrific at getting deadpan per
formances out of the other actors in
the cast, some of these scenes are
truly prodigious— especially the con
frontation with his boss (Michael
Greene, with Tom Tarpey as the ad
man who wants to employ David in
New York), the scene in whch he tries

to talk the casino manager (Garry K.
Marshall) into giving him back the
money Linda has lost at roulette, and
the dialogue between David and the
employment agent (Art Frankel) he
visits in Safford. The most amazing
scene in the 1978 drama "Straight
Time" situated Dustin Hoffman in an
employment agency, desperate for a
job but forced to confess to the agent
that the gaps on his record are due to
the spaces of his life spent in prison.
In "Lost in America," a man whose
last job netted him an average of
$100,000 a year is offered a job at a
crossing guard.
Other moments don't pan out — an
encounter with a highway cop
(Charles Boswell) shifts comic gears
in the middle without the needed
transition and our glimpse of David
as a crossing guard doesn't live up to
its build-up. And then the whole
movie takes a sudden plunge to its
ending, before we've had the chance
to get used to the Howards' new en

forced lifestyle; it feels as though
someone pulled out the plug. But it's
a delightful movie — yet another
good American comedy. (In the past
year we've had "Splash,"
"Romancing the Stone," "This Is
Spinal Tap," "Moscow on the Hud
son," "The Adventures of Buckaroo
Banzai," "All of Me," "Choose Me,"
"Micki and Maude," and"The
Purple Rose of Cairo," as well as
parts of "16 Candles," "Repo Man"
and "Stranger Than Paradise.") Al
bert Brooks and Julie Hagerty are
terrific together; they give first-rate
comic performances that are in per
fect rhythmic opposition to each
other. He maintains a bizarre balance
between executive cool and hyper
kinetic enthusiasm. When he at
tempts to sell the casino manager on
the proposition that if he returns their
money, he'll receive a million dollars'
worth of free publicity, David slides
into a traditional ad man's pitch line,
"I have chills," with all the taut
poker-faced underplaying of his
profession. But Brooks plants this
ploy right in the middle of one of
David's worst attacks of nervous en
ergy, so we can hear the frantic ten
sion in his voice at the same time as we
hear him playing it cool.
Julie Hagerty approaches her role
differently — she only plays one emo
tional state at a time, but it consumes
her completely, and it's always seated
smack in the center of her eyes. The
wide-eyed comic innocence of
"Airplane!" and "A Midsummer
Night's Sex Comedy" has become
wide-eyed intensity in "Lost in
America,"and sometimes it makes
her look really crazed — especially in
the casino, where she does the fun
niest impression of a compulsive
gambler ever put in a movie. The
bonus in her performance is that
walking out on her job wipes the
Mary Hartman angst off her face —
she doesn't smile until then, and
when she finally does, her radiance
makes us grin — we can feel that
throwing all that money down the
drain actually liberates her. Reluctant
at first to trust David's impulses, she
turns out to be the true convert to his
"drop-out" philosophy, while he
proceeds to fall apart under the pres
sure of losing his life savings. But
there's a real connection between
Brooks and Hagerty on the screen.
Somehow they make these two
specimens of corporate burn-out,
each caught in a different psychic
loop, a perfect match.


Julie Hagerty and co-writer/director Albert Brooks star in Brooks' latest film, "Lost in America," a comedy
about disillusioned Yuppies who take to the road in an attempt to And the "real" America.
