# A1 Stewart performs his unique brand of pop/folk
## 
### RONALD CHRISLEY 
A 1 Stewart brought his unusually upbeat brand of
folk/pop to Palo Alto last Tuesday night at the Keystone.
Although he is a veteran club-circuit act, with his first and
biggest hit, "The Year of the Cat," having peaked almost
10 years ago, Stewart claimed that this was his first time in
Palo Alto, in spite of his many Bay Area appearances.
His set sufficiently represented his musical style, espe
cially its preoccupations with history and politics:
"Rumours of War," "On the Border" (about Rhodesia),
"Running Man" (referring to Nazi war criminal Josef
Mengele), "Lord Grenville" (the British admiral) and the
apocalyptic "Nostradamus," a song that relays some of
the prophesies of the 16th-century French philosopher of
the same name. In fact, Stewart himself jokingly referred
to his latest album, "Russians and Americans," as"David
Brinkley Reports" because of its near-journalistic politi
cal content, both neutral and perceptive.
The evening also saw some of Stewart's more personal,
romantic material, such as the famous "Time Passages,"
"One Stage Before" and "Accident on 3rd St." Although
he wittily plugged "Russians and Americans," he played
preciously little from it, omitting even the aptly named
"The One that Got Away," easily the most contagious of
the tracks. However, this deficiency of new pieces allowed
him to focus on his older material, with which the audi
ence was more familiar.
The thin instrumentation of the set was initially discon
certing â€” although the stage was littered with guitars,
saxophones, percussive devices, et al., many of the songs
lacked the almost-orchestral fullness that Stewart has pre
sented on previous tours, and on vinyl through the talents
of producers such as Alan Parsons. Unfortunately, one of
the effects of this streamlining was the use of a drum ma
chine instead of a live drummer. Although adequate, this
artifice proved to be unreliable (there were a couple of in
stances of start/stop problems with the machine) and
simply tacky. But the most glaring result of this sparseness
was the absence of the violin solo on "Broadway Hotel," a
passage that defines the essence of that song, as well as
much of Stewart's other works. This was replaced,
however, by a very entertaining Spanish guitar solo by
Peter White. The same thing can be said for both this song

and the concert in general: What it iost in substance, it
made up for in freshness. Or almost did.
The decisive factor of the evening was Stewart's calmly
charismatic stage presence. His genteel sureness,
combined with his wry, if rather Britishly bizarre, sense of
humor, demonstrated themselves in his between-song
anecdotes: a story about meeting Tiberius Caesar while
bathing, the description of his previous life as an inventive
16th-century monk named Don Perignon, and other tales
that resembled the "Clarence Frogman Henry" track on
"Indian Summer," his live album. Stewart has defined
"historical existential humor." This subtle and refined
showmanship made the evening more pleasant and
unique.
Stewart did not perform with his usual support band,
Shot in the Dark, but used a few talented Americans in
stead. Steve Reghi's guitars were clean and smooth, and
he faithfully reproduced the solos from Stewart's record
ings. Stewart's music features and flatters the saxophone
to such an extent that the audience was fooled into giving
the sax player, local boy Dave Camp, more laud than was
probably due. His contributions were positive, however,
including a flute accompaniment for "If It Doesn't Come
Naturally, Leave It."
Peter White, surrounded by instruments, was featured
throughout the show on acoustic and electric guitars,
keyboards and piano. Unfortunately, he performed a dis
appointingly mediocre "solo" that merely amounted to a
medley of "The Entertainer," "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desir
ing" and "Somewhere Over the Rainbow." But his mo
ment came immediately thereafter, when he broke into
the distinctive opening strains of "Year of the Cat," the
last piece in the set. All was forgiven.
A 1 & Co. returned for two encores: "Strange Girl," off
the new album, and one of his favorites, "Almost Lucy."
When the audience pleaded for yet a third, Stewart
pointed to his watch and smilingly admonished, "On be
half of myself and Twisted Sister, goodnight. Now go
home. It's past your bedtime."
The evening started off with Fettish's '70s-based rock
'n' roll, followed by the thoroughly British folk sounds of
The Strawbs, a perfect choice as a warm-up act for Al
Stewart.
