# Election rally draws few
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
A rally to generate interest in the ASSU elections today
and tomorrow and to encourage students to vote for Con
stitutional Amendments 9 and 14 attracted little more
than a handful of spectators yesterday afternoon at White
Plaza.
ASSU Senator Mark Soble, who organized the rally,
also denounced the Hammer and Coffin Slate running for
the office of Council of Presidents. "They have a platform
which, in my opinion, would hurt student organizations,"
he said.
Soble said he saw the rally "as a response to the Daily
endorsements . . . there needs to be another source of in
formation, particularly in this election."
The Daily Editorial Board last week endorsed the H &
C Slate and recommended that students vote no on all
constitutional amendments.
Constitutional Amendment 9, according to the ASSU
Elections Handbook, "provides a mechanism by which
the student body could vote to establish a multi-year fee
assessment for capital expenditures."
Soble called the amendment "essential," noting that it
would raise funds "for more student-organization office
space."
"No matter what else happens, vote for the capital fee,"
ASSU Senator Carey White told passers-by. Student or-

ganizations now occupy "joke space across the campus,
he said.
Constitutional Amendment 14, according to the hand
book, "would eliminate the ability of members of the
[ ASSU] to receive refunds of the [ ASSU] and special
fees."
Soble said the amendment would "increase the number
of people who vote simply because they care' and "allow
people to better estimate how much money" a specific
group receives each year. In addition, Soble said the
amendment would reduce the amount of student fees for
support of programs by $10 per year.
Soble also encouraged students to take the elections
seriously, stating that "If people don't care about this kind
of thing, it's going to screw student organizations."
Rallying against the H & C Slate, Soble said that the
group's platform would "screw small groups and screw
minority organizations," adding that the slate's plans for
direct student votes on issues "will hurt these small organ
izations."
As Soble spoke, several members of the Chaparral staff
— with which the H & C Slate is affiliated — handed out
copies of the humor magazine.
"I'm concerned about all these people who might vote
against us," said H & C Slate member Tim Quirk, point
ing out that very few people had stopped to listen to
Soble. "You can print that as long as it's clear I'm being
sarcastic," he said.
