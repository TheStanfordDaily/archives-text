# Pendleton slams U.S. race policies
## 
### ALLISON HARTWELL 
Calling for "equality of opportu
nity. not equality of result," the chair
man of the U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights last night told a near-capacity
crowd in Kresge Auditorium, "The
faster we get rid of those God-awful
preferential programs, the faster we
can move toward a racially neutral
society."
Clarence Pendleton, a 1982
Reagan appointee to the commission,
said his goal is to "end the new racism
that confronts black people today."
His appearance, sponsored by the
Stanford College Republicans,
sparked debate on his policies as well
as controversy over some fliers dis
tributed before his speech began.
Pendleton called the preferential
treatment given to blacks and other
minorities by federal government
programs a "new racism.'
"The name of the game of the

American government is how to get
yourself declared a victim," he said.
Pendleton said he is against affirm
ative action and "timetables, goals
and quotas" because they violate the
equal protection clause of the Consti
tution by discriminating against
whites.
In addition, such programs treat
"blacks as a commodity; there has to
be sufficient supply," he said.
According to Pendleton, blacks
and whites should be allowed to com
pete freely, and his duty is to
"promote a society that is truly blind
of color."
He considers busing another form
of discrimination. "To tell a black
student that he has to go to a white
school is racist," he said.
