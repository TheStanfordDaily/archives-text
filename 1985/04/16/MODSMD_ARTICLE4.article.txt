# Pendleton slams U.S. race policies
## 
### ALLISON HARTWELL 
Calling for "equality of opportu
nity. not equality of result," the chair
man of the U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights last night told a near-capacity
crowd in Kresge Auditorium, "The
faster we get rid of those God-awful
preferential programs, the faster we
can move toward a racially neutral
society."
Clarence Pendleton, a 1982
Reagan appointee to the commission,
said his goal is to "end the new racism
that confronts black people today."
His appearance, sponsored by the
Stanford College Republicans,
sparked debate on his policies as well
as controversy over some fliers dis
tributed before his speech began.
Pendleton called the preferential
treatment given to blacks and other
minorities by federal government
programs a "new racism.'
"The name of the game of the

American government is how to get
yourself declared a victim," he said.
Pendleton said he is against affirm
ative action and "timetables, goals
and quotas" because they violate the
equal protection clause of the Consti
tution by discriminating against
whites.
In addition, such programs treat
"blacks as a commodity; there has to
be sufficient supply," he said.
According to Pendleton, blacks
and whites should be allowed to com
pete freely, and his duty is to
"promote a society that is truly blind
of color."
He considers busing another form
of discrimination. "To tell a black
student that he has to go to a white
school is racist," he said.
When questioned about President
Reagan's proposed cuts in education

speaks to a near-capacity crowd at Kresge Auditorium last night.
spending, Pendleton answered that
"it is Congress that passes the budget,
not Ronald Reagan. It's up to the
House of Representatives controlled
by the Democrats." His comment
brought many jeers from the audi
ence.
Citing lower test scores for blacks,
Pendleton said the "results clearly
mean that there needs to be an all-out
effort for improvement in elementary
and secondary school for blacks."
He said other civil rights leaders
"peddle the wrong programs," such
as food stamps, and instead should
work to close the academic dis
crepancy.
A current program applauded by
many civil rights activists and assailed
by Pendleton is comparable worth,
which would require equal pay for
not only equal work, but for work of
equal value to the employer. "It is
government imposing wage systems
on a free market," he said.
After the speech, graduate student
Eric Diesel, an anti-Reagan activist,
told The Daily that a group of Stan
ford College Republicans stole fliers
he was distributing in the lobby of
Kresge.
Diesel said that a group of
about 12 people led by Jason Math
erly, president of the Stanford Col

lege Republicans, and Steve Dauber,
the group's immediate past president,
approached him at the speech, de
manding that he leave and taking his
materials.
However, Dauber said that al
though a group of College
Republicans approached Diesel and
asked him to leave Kresge, nothing
was taken from Diesel. Diesel's ac
cusation, he said, was a "blatant lie."
"1 didn't want him there," Dauber
said. He said Diesel told him he had
clearance from University Events and
Services, but Dauber said he then
checked with an Events and Services
representative who did not substan
tiate Diesel's claim.
According to Dauber, the Events
and Services representative asked
Diesel to leave but was ignored.
Diesel said he will file a complaint
with the University ombudsman.
Dean of Student Affairs Jim Lyons
and Student Organizational Services.
"I want their (the Stanford
Republicans) privileges to use the
University name revoked," he said.
"You can't discriminate against
someone because of his political
beliefs. . . . It's an obstruction of the
First Amendment," Diesel said.
Lyons told The Daily last night that
he hopes the two sides "will sit down
and talk about it."
"The University has always been a
free and open campus," he said.
