### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Staff writer 
A Stanford student was arrested
early Saturday evening for attempting
to steal a pizza from a Domino's
delivery truck, Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer said yesterday.
The student was identified as
senior Michael Minchin, president of
the Delta Upsilon fraternity.
Niemeyer said Officer David Lee
observed Minchin remove a pizza
from a Domino's delivery truck
parked in front of the DU house on
Mayfield Avenue at approximately
6:15 p.m.
Two Columbae residents said they
also witnessed the arrest.
Senior Cam Baker told The Daily

he saw "a DU guy" take a pizza from
the Domino's truck while Baker was
playing basketball.
"He was going back toward the
DU house, saw the cop, and tried to
put the pizza back in the truck,"
Baker said.
According to Niemeyer, the officer
did not observe Minchin attempting
to put the pizza back into the truck.
According to Niemeyer, Lee "pat
searched" Minchin, who identified
himself to the officer as "Mark
Thompson."
Sophomore Michael Tarpey said he
saw the thief run off as soon as the
policeman was through frisking him.
Baker said the thief ran across the
Sigma Chi lawn toward Tresidder

Union. Minutes later, the officer
returned to his cruiser, leading the
handcuffed student, Baker said.
Niemeyer said Minchin was chased
on foot until he was apprehended in
the Tresidder Union parking lot.
Niemeyer said Minchin was
charged with petty theft and resisting
arrest, both misdemeanors, and was
taken to North County Jail for
booking. The charges are to be
referred to the District Attorney's of
fice for action this morning,
Niemeyer said.
Minchin declined to comment on
the incident.
According to Niemeyer, incidents
involving Domino's Pizza deliveries
have troubled Stanford police for

some time.
"We've had a number of problems
involving Domino's delivery people,"
Niemeyer said. "We had one vehicle
stolen and driven off into Lake
Lagunita earlier this year."
Niemeyer added that there have
also been many reports of "strong
arm" robbery attempts and "phony
calls to phony places" on campus.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington also told The Daily that offi
cers have been on the lookout for stu
dents harassing pizza delivery men
and stealing pizzas.
Spokesmen for Domino's Pizza
refused to comment on Saturday's in
cident or the frequency of robbery at
tempts.
