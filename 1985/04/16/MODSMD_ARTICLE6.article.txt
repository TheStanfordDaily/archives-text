## 
### BARBARA SCHULER Senior staff writer 
A man wearing a black bandana and carrying a
plastic pistol burst into a history classroom yes
terday, shouting accusations at two students he
claimed were involved in such "leftist" activities
as health-care work and literacy campaigns.
As they rose from their seats in an attempt to
escape, the accused were "shot" and fell to the
floor. Before fleeing, the "assassin" threw a
newspaper at one of the victims, saying, "And
quit distributing this shit!"
Returning a,few seconds later — his bandana
removed from his face and his gun discharged —
Stanford student Matt Nicodemus said that
"students taking classes like this one (History
170: America in the 19605) from teachers like
him," pointing at History Prof. Clay Carson, a
civil rights activist and former draft resister,
would be risking their lives in many Central
American countries.
Nicodemus said he and others wanted to make
graphic what they see as the threat to the lives of
many Nicaraguans, among them politically active
students, posed by the U.S.-backed Contras ac
tive in Nicaragua.
As Nicodemus explained the purpose behind
the guerrilla theater simulation of life after "a
CIA-backed Contra invasion and takeover,"
several students expressed anger over the class
disruption.
"What gives you the right to come in here and
interrupt Prof. Carson, say these things . . . and
distribute your propaganda?" demanded sopho
more Jeff Schroeder.
Nicodemus replied that Carson had given his
consent. One student sitting in front of Schroeder
said, "Good, that's all I cared about."

A similar action in a morning French class in
volved graduate students Paul Baer and Lynn
Gazis. Several other actions, part of a "ClA
backed Contra invasion and takeover of the
Stanford campus," are planned for the rest of the
week, according to Nicodemus.
Citing that yesterday was "tax day"and men
tioning President Reagan's appeal to Congress
"to allocate $14 million in humanitarian, non
military aid to the Contras which buys everything
except weapons and munitions, freeing up other
Contra money for these purchases," Nicodemus
encouraged students to ihink of ways to exert in
fluence over the uses of their tax dollars.
He suggested "writing to your representatives.

if you're into that," or taking more direct action,
such as refusal of war-tax payment.
After Nicodemus left, Carson, who had been
lecturing on civil rights activist Ella Baker, said,
"I have a feeling that Ella Baker would have ap
proved."
Students contacted after class expressed
varying reactions to the event."I definitely
thought (the staged attack] was appropriate. I
was going to clap," said senior Katrin Tobin. "I
was struck by how vocal they were with their
views, and I was definitely sympathetic to their
right to speak "
