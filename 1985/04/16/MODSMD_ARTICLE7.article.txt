South Africa repeals racial laws
CAPE TOWN, South Africa — The government said yesterday it will
repeal laws prohibiting sex and marriage between whites and people of
other races, two pillars of the apartheid system aimed at preserving
white racial purity.
Anti-apartheid forces quickly called the announcement "window
dressing" and declared the laws unimportant compared with the primary
goal of winning the right to vote for South Africa's black majority con
sisting of 22 million people.
Whites on both sides took the move seriously. The Conservative Party
said the repeal would endanger "our national identity," and Louis Stof
berg, spokesman for the far-right Herstigte Nasionale Party said. "The
government has let loose a tiger that it won't be able to control."
The announcement, by Home Affairs Minister F.W. de Klerk to Parli
ament, was the most dramatic of a series of moves by white-minority
government in recent months toward social change and easing of apart
heid, the official policy of racial separation.
Repeal of the sex and marriage laws strikes at the foundations of apart
heid, which guarantees such white privileges as separate residential
neighborhoods, schools and hospitals.
De Klerk told Parliament the government believes legalization of sex
across the color line will create social problems, but feels it is time to
remove the issue "from the political arena."
Repeal of the 36-year-old Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act and
the 28-year-old Section 16 of the Immorality Act, expected this year,
will allow whites legally to have sexual relations with blacks, Asians and
people of mixed race, called coloreds in South Africa. There has been no
prohibition on relations among the non-white groups.
The laws were strictly enforced in most parts of the country, but have
been increasingly ignored in the large cities such as Johannesburg, Dur
ban and Cape Town where hundreds of whites and non-whites lived to
gether with the sufferance of authorities. About 200 people have been
prosecuted under the laws each year.
In Washington, State Department spokesman Bernard Kalb said,
"Efforts such as this appear to be a step in the direction of a more just
society, although we realize that much more needs to be done."
Nthato Motlana, community leader in Soweto, the populous black
township outside Johannesburg, said: "These two laws denied our
humanity by suggesting that sex with blacks was demeaning, but these
laws are of no particular interest to black South Africans."
The multiracial Southern African Catholic Bishops Conference said in
Pretoria that scrapping the two laws was "only window dressing."
Spokesman Tiaan van der Merwe of the white opposition Progressive
Federal Party, said it was only "a small step on the long and difficult
road to racial normality," but would put pressure on other aspects of
apartheid.
Chrysler connects with Mitsubishi
TOKYO — Chrysler Corp. announced yesterday that it would form a
joint company with its Japanese partner, Mitsubishi Motors Corp., to
build small cars in the American Midwest beginning in 1988.
The venture was announced in Tokyo by Chrysler Chairman Lee
lacocca, who issued a statement, and by Mitsubishi President Toyoo
Tate, who held a news conference.
Mitsubishi repeated a statement made several months ago that it was
looking at sites in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Kentucky. However, Tate
on yesterday added a fifth state, Michigan.
The statement said Mitsubishi would "take the lead in the day-to-day
operations of the (project) as well as design and construction of the
plant."
The companies didn't say what kind of car they would build, only that
it would be "small." The production figure given, 180,000 cars a year, is
substantially below the output of today's modern auto plants.
Tate also said 1.6-liter engines and transmissions would be shipped
from Japan for the two-door cars.
Joseph Phillippi, an automotive industry analyst with E.F. Hutton in
New York, said, "It's difficult to say now what kind of car this would be.
They're talking about the 1989 model year."
The timetable announced by the companies could conceivably give
them the remainder of this year to look for a plant site.
Chrysler said the plant would employ about 2,500 workers at full
capacity and the operation would lead to creation of another 8,800 sup
plier jobs in the auto industry.
Tate told the news conference that the plant would cost about $500
million.
A Mitsubishi statement said the two companies would decide the plant
location jointly "after thorough evaluation of financial and other per
tinent factors, including incentives to be offered by those states."
Tate and lacocca, who arrived Saturday for a six-day visit to Japan,
signed an agreement yesterday to form a joint venture, owned 50 per
cent by each company. They said a formal agreement would be signed
after they work out the details.
They said the cars will be distributed through Chrysler, Dodge and
Plymouth dealers and under the Mitsubishi name by Mitsubishi Motor
Sales of America Inc.
The likelihood that the Japanese government may not completely end
restrictions on exports of cars to the United States was seen as a factor in
Mitsubishi's decision to produce automobiles in the United States.
Honda Motor Co. Ltd. was the first Japanese automaker to establish
production in the United States, building its first car in 1982 in Ohio.
GM and Toyota Motor Corp. recently began production in California.
Nissan Motor Co. produced its first car last month in Tennessee, and
Mazda Motor Corp., 25 percent owned by Ford Motor Co., plans to
break ground this spring for a new plant in Flat Rock south of Detroit.
Chrysler and Mitsubishi also announced yesterday that Chrysler will
increase its ownership in Mitsubishi Motors to 24 percent from the pres
ent 15 percent by acquiring shares from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries,
which now owns 85 percent of Mitsubishi Motors.
Chrysler and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries formed Mitsubishi Motors
in 1971 as a joint venture. The new plan calls for allowing Mitsubishi
Motors ultimately to become a publicly held company whose shares are
traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
and Chrysler continuing to be the principal shareholders, Chrysler said.
Weizman to meet with Mubarak
JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Shimon Peres won Cabinet ap
proval by a single vote yesterday to send a close adviser to Egypt follow
ing a showdown with his foreign minister over who controls Israeli
foreign policy.
The fight between Peres and his chief political rival. Foreign Minister
Yitzhak Shamir, increased doubts about the durability of Israel's
troubled coalition government.
The Cabinet voted 13-12 in a telephone poll to send Minister Without
Portfolio Ezer Weizman to Egypt on "a goodwill mission" and for talks
with President Hosni Mubarak.
Shamir, leader of the right-wing Likud Bloc, objected to the trip as an
intrusion into his province, the conduct of foreign policy.
Before leaving for Cairo, Weizman told reporters: "I have not been
authorized or not authorized to negotiate. I am merely going for an ex
change of views and will report to the Cabinet on my return. The pur
pose of the visit is a goodwill mission to see old friends, to listen and to
express my own opinion within the framework of this government."
Speaking at Tel Aviv's Bcn-Gurion Airport, Weizman said he did not
believe the controversy in the Cabinet would damage the purpose of his
trip. "On the contrary, it is now easier for me to point out to my Egyp
tian friends there are different opinions in Israel and people here will
have to be persuaded to go along with my way of thinking."
Weizman is a former defense minister who was a key envoy in the
negotiations that culminated in the 1979 Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty.
He said he planned to return to Israel Thursday night.
Meanwhile, Israel radio reported that Peres and Mubarak have ex
changed messages on a possible summit meeting following Weizman's
trip.
Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed
that the two leaders were discussing a meeting. The sources said the sub
ject was briefly discussed by Peres and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
Richard Murphy, who arrived from Jordan in the middle of the contro
versy over Weizman's trip.

across the color line will create social problems, but feels it is time to
remove the issue "from the political arena."
Repeal of the 36-year-old Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act and
the 28-year-old Section 16 of the Immorality Act, expected this year,
will allow whites legally to have sexual relations with blacks, Asians and
people of mixed race, called coloreds in South Africa. There has been no
prohibition on relations among the non-white groups.
The laws were strictly enforced in most parts of the country, but have
been increasingly ignored in the large cities such as Johannesburg, Dur
ban and Cape Town where hundreds of whites and non-whites lived to
gether with the sufferance of authorities. About 200 people have been
prosecuted under the laws each year.
In Washington, State Department spokesman Bernard Kalb said,
"Efforts such as this appear to be a step in the direction of a more just
society, although we realize that much more needs to be done."
Nthato Motlana, community leader in Soweto, the populous black
township outside Johannesburg, said: "These two laws denied our
humanity by suggesting that sex with blacks was demeaning, but these
laws are of no particular interest to black South Africans."
The multiracial Southern African Catholic Bishops Conference said in
Pretoria that scrapping the two laws was "only window dressing."
Spokesman Tiaan van der Merwe of the white opposition Progressive
Federal Party, said it was only "a small step on the long and difficult
road to racial normality," but would put pressure on other aspects of
apartheid.
Chrysler connects with Mitsubishi
TOKYO — Chrysler Corp. announced yesterday that it would form a
joint company with its Japanese partner, Mitsubishi Motors Corp., to
build small cars in the American Midwest beginning in 1988.
The venture was announced in Tokyo by Chrysler Chairman Lee
lacocca, who issued a statement, and by Mitsubishi President Toyoo
Tate, who held a news conference.
Mitsubishi repeated a statement made several months ago that it was
looking at sites in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Kentucky. However, Tate
on yesterday added a fifth state, Michigan.
The statement said Mitsubishi would "take the lead in the day-to-day
operations of the (project) as well as design and construction of the
plant."
The companies didn't say what kind of car they would build, only that
it would be "small." The production figure given, 180,000 cars a year, is
substantially below the output of today's modern auto plants.
Tate also said 1.6-liter engines and transmissions would be shipped
from Japan for the two-door cars.
Joseph Phillippi, an automotive industry analyst with E.F. Hutton in
New York, said, "It's difficult to say now what kind of car this would be.
They're talking about the 1989 model year."
The timetable announced by the companies could conceivably give
them the remainder of this year to look for a plant site.
Chrysler said the plant would employ about 2,500 workers at full
capacity and the operation would lead to creation of another 8,800 sup
plier jobs in the auto industry.
Tate told the news conference that the plant would cost about $500
million.
A Mitsubishi statement said the two companies would decide the plant
location jointly "after thorough evaluation of financial and other per
tinent factors, including incentives to be offered by those states."
Tate and lacocca, who arrived Saturday for a six-day visit to Japan,
signed an agreement yesterday to form a joint venture, owned 50 per
cent by each company. They said a formal agreement would be signed
after they work out the details.
They said the cars will be distributed through Chrysler, Dodge and
Plymouth dealers and under the Mitsubishi name by Mitsubishi Motor
Sales of America Inc.
The likelihood that the Japanese government may not completely end
restrictions on exports of cars to the United States was seen as a factor in
Mitsubishi's decision to produce automobiles in the United States.
Honda Motor Co. Ltd. was the first Japanese automaker to establish
production in the United States, building its first car in 1982 in Ohio.
GM and Toyota Motor Corp. recently began production in California.
Nissan Motor Co. produced its first car last month in Tennessee, and
Mazda Motor Corp., 25 percent owned by Ford Motor Co., plans to
break ground this spring for a new plant in Flat Rock south of Detroit.
Chrysler and Mitsubishi also announced yesterday that Chrysler will
increase its ownership in Mitsubishi Motors to 24 percent from the pres
ent 15 percent by acquiring shares from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries,
which now owns 85 percent of Mitsubishi Motors.
Chrysler and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries formed Mitsubishi Motors
in 1971 as a joint venture. The new plan calls for allowing Mitsubishi
Motors ultimately to become a publicly held company whose shares are
traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
and Chrysler continuing to be the principal shareholders, Chrysler said.
Weizman to meet with Mubarak
JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Shimon Peres won Cabinet ap
proval by a single vote yesterday to send a close adviser to Egypt follow
ing a showdown with his foreign minister over who controls Israeli
foreign policy.
The fight between Peres and his chief political rival. Foreign Minister
Yitzhak Shamir, increased doubts about the durability of Israel's
troubled coalition government.
The Cabinet voted 13-12 in a telephone poll to send Minister Without
Portfolio Ezer Weizman to Egypt on "a goodwill mission" and for talks
with President Hosni Mubarak.
Shamir, leader of the right-wing Likud Bloc, objected to the trip as an
intrusion into his province, the conduct of foreign policy.
Before leaving for Cairo, Weizman told reporters: "I have not been
authorized or not authorized to negotiate. I am merely going for an ex
change of views and will report to the Cabinet on my return. The pur
pose of the visit is a goodwill mission to see old friends, to listen and to
express my own opinion within the framework of this government."
Speaking at Tel Aviv's Bcn-Gurion Airport, Weizman said he did not
believe the controversy in the Cabinet would damage the purpose of his
trip. "On the contrary, it is now easier for me to point out to my Egyp
tian friends there are different opinions in Israel and people here will
have to be persuaded to go along with my way of thinking."
Weizman is a former defense minister who was a key envoy in the
negotiations that culminated in the 1979 Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty.
He said he planned to return to Israel Thursday night.
Meanwhile, Israel radio reported that Peres and Mubarak have ex
changed messages on a possible summit meeting following Weizman's
trip.
Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed
that the two leaders were discussing a meeting. The sources said the sub
ject was briefly discussed by Peres and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
Richard Murphy, who arrived from Jordan in the middle of the contro
versy over Weizman's trip.
South Africa repeals racial laws
CAPE TOWN, South Africa — The government said yesterday it will
repeal laws prohibiting sex and marriage between whites and people of
other races, two pillars of the apartheid system aimed at preserving
white racial purity.
Anti-apartheid forces quickly called the announcement "window
dressing" and declared the laws unimportant compared with the primary
goal of winning the right to vote for South Africa's black majority con
sisting of 22 million people.
Whites on both sides took the move seriously. The Conservative Party
said the repeal would endanger "our national identity," and Louis Stof
berg, spokesman for the far-right Herstigte Nasionale Party said. "The
government has let loose a tiger that it won't be able to control."
The announcement, by Home Affairs Minister F.W. de Klerk to Parli
ament, was the most dramatic of a series of moves by white-minority
government in recent months toward social change and easing of apart
heid, the official policy of racial separation.
Repeal of the sex and marriage laws strikes at the foundations of apart
heid, which guarantees such white privileges as separate residential
neighborhoods, schools and hospitals.
De Klerk told Parliament the government believes legalization of sex
across the color line will create social problems, but feels it is time to
remove the issue "from the political arena."
Repeal of the 36-year-old Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act and
