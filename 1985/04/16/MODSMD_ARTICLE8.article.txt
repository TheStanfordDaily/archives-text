# Reagan seeks aid for Contras
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, launch
ing the second major legislative campaign of his
new term, appealed yesterday for $14 million for
guerrillas battling Nicaragua's leftist government,
calling the money "so little, yet such an important
symbol of our resolve."
Reagan met with Costa Rica's president and
members of Washington's conservative foreign
policy establishment and also issued a statement
from the Oval Office.
On Capitol Hill, opponents of Reagan's aid plan
opened their own lobbying blitz. And the Commit
tee for a Sane Nuclear Policy began running news
paper, television and radio ads featuring alleged
victims of rebel brutality.
Rep. Peter Kostmayer (D-Pa.), an opponent of
Reagan's proposal, predicted Reagan's lobbying
campaign would fail in the Democrat-controlled
House. "It would be the first step toward wider
U.S. involvement," he said, and would give the ad
ministration a blank check to wage open-ended war
in Central America.
But the president pointed to his April 4 proposal
for a cease-fire and church-mediated negotiations
between Nicaragua's Sandinista government and
U.S.-backed rebels, coupled with a renewed appeal
for covert aid to the guerrillas. He said he was
"asking Congress to give this peace initiative and
democracy a chance."
Reagan said the money he seeks is just a "small
amount, $14 million for the more than 15,000
Nicaraguans who are struggling for democracy."
"It is so little, yet such an important symbol of

our resolve, a signal to all of Central America and,
yes, to those everywhere in the world who depend
on us," he said in a statement.
The president was flanked by James Schlesinger,
defense secretary in the Ford administration; Zbig
niew Brzezinski, national security adviser in the
Carter White House; Jeane Kirkpatrick, who

'(I'm) asking Congress to
give this peace initiative
and democracy a chance.'

served four years as Reagan's ambassador to the
United Nations; and Vice President George Bush,
Saying he also enjoyed the support of former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who was not
present, Reagan said, "I'm asking Congress to
work with me to stem the flow of refugees, the
threat of hostile forces on our borders and a loss of
faith in America's commitment around the world
that could definitely result if we do not act quickly
and responsibly."

Having just returned from a 10-day vacation at
his California ranch while Congress was in Easter
recess, Reagan said he hasn't yet had a vote count
to indicate how his proposal will fare when it comes
up for a vote in the Senate April 23. But he added
he is "always cautiously optimistic."
White House officials have said they are starting
from behind as they seek to renew covert aid to
Nicaragua's "Contras," as the rebels are known.
Asked if Reagan would make a major push for
congressional approval of the aid money, as he did
last month in a successful drive for continued fund
ing of the MX missile, presidential spokesman
Larry Speakes replied, "That would be an under
statement."
But Speakes indicated the administration would
be open to a compromise if House Democrats are
successful in their effort to develop an alternative
to the Reagan plan.
"We're always mindful of legislative reality," the
spokesman said.
The president's unusually hectic first day back at
the White House began with a meeting with Costa
Rican President Luis Alberto Monge, who Speakes
said was flown to Washington from Miami aboard a
U.S. Air Force plane to meet with Reagan and con
gressional leaders.
Speakes said Monge, whose country borders
Nicaragua, was in the United States for medical
treatment and came to Washington to endorse
Reagan's cease-fire call.
In a letter released at the White House, Monge
offered "enthusiastic support" for the proposal.
