# NASA OKs rescue mission
## Crew prepares to save satellite 
### 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. —
Discovery's crew got the go-ahead
yesterday for an attempt to restore
power to a crippled $80 million
satellite with a homemade "fly swat
ter" made from a window shade, a
vacuum hose and a piece of plastic.
Astronauts Jeffrey Hoffman and
David Griggs put on space helmets
for an hour to breathe pure oxygen,
beginning the process of purging
nitrogen from their systems for a
space walk today during which they
will clamp the device onto the shuttle
arm.
Rescue day is tomorrow, when Dis
covery will close the 40-mile distance
with the satellite and extend its arm
flyswatter combination to try to snag
a four-inch lever on the side of the
huge revolving satellite.
The lever is an on-off switch for
electrical power to the satellite that
was supposed to flip outward auto

matically when the astronauts
deployed the satellite Saturday. By
pulling it, engineers hope to begin the
electrical sequence to restore the
satellite to its proper working condi
tion.
"You're go for EVA (extra
vehicular activity) tomorrow and a
rendezvous the day after tomorrow,"
shuttle commander Karol Bobko was
told yesterday.
"Oh boy, we'll look forward to it,"
he said.
"Our ingenuity people have been
working overtime," mission control's
Bob Hilmers said as he sent the crew
on a scavenger hunt through Dis
covery's cabin to find more items that
will be used on the device. The alumi
num frame of a window shade was
pressed into service and so was some
small wire, a Swiss army knife and a
bone saw.

The astronauts were instructed to
cut three square holes out of two
plastic covers of their flight files to
create ladder-like flexible wands.
One version will be attached to a
cone made of rolled up plastic, an
other will be on the aluminum ribbing
of the light shade, and each will be
taped to the arm.
If one doesn't work, the other will
be tried.
The idea is to allow the plastic to
slide along the side of the satellite and
hope that the protruding lever will
catch in one of the rungs.
"We're working on these things
and it's pretty interesting," said
astronaut Margaret Rhea Seddon,
who will operate the arm during
Wednesday's attempt.
Seddon, a surgeon, used the saw to
cut off the end of a pole that
astronauts use to reach circuit
breakers during ascent. In space jar

gon, it is known as a swizzle stick.
"The short doctor just got to
practice her orthopedic skills," she
said. "We just amputated the pusher
end of the swizzle stick."
The satellite exercise will extend
Discovery's flight by two days, to
Friday, adding bonus time to the
drug-processing work being con
ducted by Charles Walker, an en
gineer for the McDonnell Douglas
Corp.
A hands-on try by an astronaut on
the shuttle arm was rejected by
NASA as being too dangerous. The
satellite is 20 feet high, 14 feet in
diameter, weighs 15,200 pounds and
is revolving once every 35 seconds.
The satellite, known both as Syn
com and Leasat, is weightless but
retains the inertia of its huge mass,
which includes four tons of rocket
fuel.
