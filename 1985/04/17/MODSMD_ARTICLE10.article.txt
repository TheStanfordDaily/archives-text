# Discovery arm set for satellite
## 
### 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. —
Two spacewalkers fastened a
makeshift "flyswatter" to the end
of Discovery's robot arm yester
day, and the crew practiced ways
of using it to gently pull a switch to
activate an orbiting satellite filled
with volatile fuel.
At stake in today's attempt is
the life of the $80 million Syncom
communications satellite. If
NASA guessed right, flipping the
switch will start a 45-minute se
quence that erects the satellite's
antenna, puts Syncom into a faster
spin and sends it off to a useful or
bit high above Earth.
"If I could think of a better bul
let to fire, I'd be shooting it," said
flight director Randy Stone. "The
only thing on this satellite we can
do anything about is this lever. I
think we've got a very good proba
bility of tripping this lever."
Discovery's crew has two four
minute periods, 90 minutes apart,
to accomplish the task.
i
The first try is scheduled shortly
after 9 a.m. EST, when shuttle and
Syncom are over two Atlantic
Ocean islands called St. Peter and
St. Paul northeast of Brazil.
Clad in clumsy space suits,
astronauts David Griggs and Jef
frey Hoffman floated into Dis
covery's cargo bay Tuesday and
strapped two jury-rigged tools —
one described as a flyswatter, the
other as a lacrosse stick — to the

end of shuttle's 50-foot mechani
cal arm.
"Is that beautiful, or is that not
beautiful," said Griggs, stepping
back to admire his handiwork.
The unscheduled space walk
and repair attempt extended the
flight, which was supposed to end
Wednesday, but NASA had not
decided whether the landing will
be tomorrow or Friday.
If the repair maneuver works on
the first attempt and the weather
forecast is good, the shuttle may
land at the Kennedy Space Center
tomorrow morning. Otherwise,
homecoming day is Friday.
Today, commander Karol
Bobko and pilot Don Williams will
close the 40-mile distance with
Syncom and fly alongside. Mission
Specialist Margaret Rhea Seddon
will extend the arm to allow the
flexible end of the crude tool to
brush along the satellite's solar
panels.
"You were right when you said
that sometimes they ask you to do
all kinds of peculiar things with the
arm," Seddon said as she was
given an extended runthrough
from mission control in Houston
by astronaut Sally Ride.
Then she took the arm out for a
spin, moving Its flyswatter
equipped "end effector" over the
port side, just as she will on Wed
nesday when the satellite is over
head — its rocket motor pointing
toward the shuttle.
