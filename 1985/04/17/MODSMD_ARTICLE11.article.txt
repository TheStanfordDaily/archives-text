Judge seeks Indian aid
NEW YORK — A judge suggested yesterday
that Union Carbide provide $5 million to $10
million in emergency aid to victims of the
Bhopal, India, chemical leak disaster, and he said
the company could do so without admitting
liability for the deaths and injuries.
U.S. District Judge John Keenan told lawyers
in the legal fight over the toxic gas leak that
"fundamental human decency" required that
Connecticut-based Carbide take steps to ease
suffering in Bhopal without waiting for a final
court decision.
The money could be considered an advance
payment on any settlement or judgment, Keenan
said.
Carbide lawyer Bud Holman said an emer
gency relief program "would be possible," but
added that the company would prefer to reach an
overall settlement of the litigation arising from
last December's gas leak that the Indian govern
ment says killed at least 1,700 people and injured
200,000. Other estimates have put the death toll
above 2,000.
"If the reports that I've read are true, the sit

uation is still critical there," Keenan said in his
first meeting with laywers in the case. "What I
want to hear is resourceful, intelligent American
lawyers come up with a vehicle to accomplish
some good."
He said a contribution from Union Carbide
would be "an indication of good will," adding:
"God knows how much huge corporations spend
on advertising."
The judge said he wanted the executive com
mittee to meet with Union Carbide's attorneys
and furnish an emergency aid plan by May 6.
Heart patient improves
LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Doctors said yesterday
they were "very much relieved" that surgery had
stopped internal bleeding in artificial heart pa
tient Jack Burcham, and they resumed giving him
blood thinners in hope of averting possible
strokes often caused by blood clots.
Burcham, at 62 the oldest of the world's five
recipients of a permanent artificial heart,
remained in critical but stable condition in the
coronary care unit at Humana Hospital
Audubon.

Amtrak train derails
GRANBY, Colo. — An Amtrak train on the
way to Denver from the West Coast derailed in
Fraser Canyon southeast of here last night, injur
ing at least 10 passengers, authorities reported.
Two engines, a baggage car and three pas
senger cars of the 12-car train left the tracks in
the derailment about 8 p.m., authorities said.
The derailment site — east of the Silver Creek
ski area on the western side of the Continental
Divide about 45 miles northwest of Denver— is
inaccessible by automobile, and small rail cars
were being used to bring out the more seriously
injured, authorities said.
Stocks climb
The stock market recovered from its lows of
the day in active late trading today as analysts
seemed cheered by economic reports.
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 3.10
to 1,269.88 with five minutes to go. Advances led
declines 7 to 6.
