CSU editors gain rights
SACRAMENTO — California State Univer
sity student newspaper editors could endorse po
litical candidates under a bill approved yesterday
by an Assembly subcommittee.
Under current law, CSU student newspapers
are not allowed to take positions on candidates
and ballot propositions.
Assemblyman Dan Hauser (D-Arcata) said
the editor of the Humboldt State University
newspaper, the Lumberjack, was fired last No
vember for publishing political editorials.
Hauser said University of California
newspapers do not have the same restriction.
He said an administrative ruling many years
ago created the restriction, which he called "an
enfringement upon academic and student
freedom of expression."
Under the bill, A 81720, student newspapers
would have to run a statement that the opinion
was that of the student editors, and not the uni
versity or its financial supporters.
The higher education subcommittee voted 6-0
to send the bill to the full Education Committee.

Wilson re-elected
OAKLAND — Incumbent Mayor Lionel Wil
son won re-election to a third term last night
after a fierce campaign against six competitors
that some feared could divide black residents and
weaken their power base.
With 267 of 303 precincts reporting and most
absentee ballots counted, the 70-year-old Wilson
collected 29,025 votes, or 60 percent. Wilson
Riles Jr., his closest competitor, had 15,154, or
31 percent.
Wilson, an attorney and former Superior Court
judge, repeated the 1977 victory that made him
the city's first black mayor. He collected about
$250,000 for his campaign, which adopted the
slogan, "Let's Keep Up the Good Work, Oak
land." _
3,000 wells polluted
SACRAMENTO — Fifty-seven varieties of
pesticides have been found in wells throughout
California, a new legislative report says.
Assemblyman Lloyd Connelly (D-
Sacramento) called the report "shocking," and

said it shows pesticides are "a major threat to the
groundwater supply."
"Half the pesticides in the country are used in
California. It's not surprising that we have con
taminated wells from Del Norte to San Diego
counties," Connelly said yesterday.
Jet loses engine
SAN DIEGO — An American Airlines jet
with 90 people aboard landed safely yesterday
after one of its three engines fell off during a
flight from Dallas to San Diego.
The pilot and crew knew one of the engines
had failed but were unaware it had dislodged
from the plane, American Airlines spokesman
Joe Stroop said.
