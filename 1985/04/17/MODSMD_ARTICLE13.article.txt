## Professor studies chemicals in plant ripening 
### NIKO SCHIFF Editorial staff 
Research in the lab of one of Stan
ford's recently awarded young scien
tists, Asst. Chemistry Prof. Michael
Pirrung, focuses on the mechanism of
control over plant ripening. Pirrung's
research centers on the biosynthesis
of ethylene, the chemical that ac
tivates plant ripening and stress
responses.
Pirrung is one of eight Stanford
faculty members named as Presiden
tial Young Investigators for 1985 by
the National Science Foundation, in
recognition of outstanding potential
in research and teaching. Recipients
of the $500,000 award — spread over
a five-year period — are required to
have received their doctorates within
the last seven years. Pirrung, who
received his doctorate from UC-
Berkeley in 1980, has been at Stan
ford since 1981.
Pirrung's investigation of et
hylene's biosynthesis has brought to
gether the disciplines of chemistry
and plant physiology. Ethylene has
long been known as an essential fac
tor in the plant processes associated
with ripening and wilting, said Pir
rung. The hormone induces these
degenerative processes that lead to
the breakdown of hard tissues in
plants.
The puzzling aspect of the process
was the mechanism of ethylene's ef
fects, starting with its origin as a bio
chemical synthesized in the plant, Pir
rung said.
The process of ripening is charac
terized by the plant's production of
ethylene and the breakdown of hard
tissue such as cellulose into soft
tissues like sugars. This distinguishes
the taste of a hard green apple,
mainly composed of cellulose, from
the sweet taste of a red apple that has
most of its cellulose broken into
sugars.
The process of breakdown can be

initiated by the presence of ethylene,
which causes an autocatalytic reac
tion, Pirrung said. An autocatalytic
reaction is started or increased by the
presence of the final product, in this
case ethylene. This autocatalytic ef
fect is the reason for spraying unripe
fruit with ethylene, a gas at room
temperature. The spraying is fre
quently done in trunks en route to the
Midwest so the fruit can be ripened to
sell but not spoiled in transit, said Pir
rung.
Such artificial ripening leads to the
low quality of produce in the Mid
west, said Pirrung, noting the diffi
culty in obtaining good quality
tomatoes in Chicago. Pirrung also
suggested a method of softening the
hard avocados sold in supermarkets:
"If one places the avocados in a paper
bag with a banana the ethylene
produced by the quickly ripening
banana will trigger the reaction in the
avocado."
Pirrung first became interested in
the ethylene reaction when he ran
arrnins an article on the hormonal ef

fects of ethylene by a plant
physiologist, Shang Fa Yang, a pro
fessor at the UC-Davis Department
of Vegetable Crops. After looking at
the proposed mechanism of ethylene
biosynthesis from an organic
chemist's point of view, he realized it
could not be correct. "I saw that the
mechanism would not work and as a
chemist I felt I had something to con
tribute to understanding the
process," Pirrung said.
The two major questions at the
heart of this research are the mecha
nism of ethylene production and the
mechanism by which ethylene reg
ulates the ripening and stress
response of the plant, said Pirrung.
The research efforts in Pirrung's lab
and Yang's lab have provided an an
swer to the first question and strong
clues about the answer to the second.
The starting point for Pirrung was
the immediate biosynthetic precursor
to ethylene. Examination of this
molecule yielded critical information
leading to the establishment of a
chemical mechanism for the synthesis

of the ethylene molecule.
The precursor is an amino acid that
is frequently found in plants but is not
incorporated -into proteins. Because
this amino acid was not a nutritionally
useful protein, it was generally
ignored in the early search for a
source of the ethylene molecule. The
amino acid, aminocyclopropanecar
boxylicacid (ACC), is broken down
into ethylene, carbon dioxide and
cyanide in the course of the reaction.
The proposed mechanisms of the
conversion of ACC into ethylene ne
glected an important consideration in
chemistry, that of spatial relation
ships, Pirrung said. The three
dimensional arrangement of atoms in
a molecule is specified by the mecha
nism of the reaction that leads to the
molecule's formation as well as by the
properties of the atoms themselves.
This arrangement of atoms is referred
to as the stereochemistry of the
molecule.
Pirrung realized in his examination
of the proposed method of synthesis
that the stereochemical considera

tions in regard to the ethylene
molecule produced from ACC could
lead to important insights into the re
action mechanism.
The original mechanism suggested
by the UC-Davis researchers would
have led to a single or favored
stereochemical product.
To test the mechanism, Pirrung
took an ACC molecule tagged with
radioactive hydrogens attached to the
carbons that become ethylene in the
course of the reaction. The radioac
tive hydrogens, called deuterium,
were placed in the cis stereochemical
configuration, characterized by
having two atoms of a kind on the
same side of a molecule.
The products of the reaction
showed a mixture of the cis ethylene
product and its opposite stereochemi
cal configuration, trans, with the
tagged hydrogens on opposite sides of
the molecule.
This mixture of products suggested
a relatively random reaction that was
stepwise in its nature. From this in

formation, Pirrung was able to write
out a multi-step process involving a
complex chemical reaction in which
electrons, negatively charged sub
atomic particles, are ripped away
from the ACC molecule, causing its
eventual breakdown into ethylene.
The other question that surrounds
ethylene research is the mechanism
by which ethylene regulates the
plant's breakdown of cellulose and
the stress response of wilting. Eth
ylene causes the degeneration of a
damaged part of a plant (senescence)
and the eventual removal of the
wilted part (absecession).
Clues to this part of the mystery
have also come from the chemical ap
proach. "Being a chemist 1 like to
balance my chemical reactions," said
Pirrung. "The rest of the products of
the reaction are important to consider
in the regulation of the plant's
processes."
Among these products, cyanide
stood out as a possible control
molecule. Pirrung discussed the re
search with Chemistry Prof. John
Brauman, who felt that the ethylene
molecule itself could not be respon
sible for the biochemical changes in
the plant caused by its production and
that cyanide was the more likely
molecule. Further research has shown
that plants will ripen in the presence
of cyanide and it appears that its
function might be critical in the ripen
ing process.
This research can have an impact
on many aspects of food production.
"Ultimately it would be useful to
make a molecule that could prevent
ethylene's message from being sent or
from being received," said Pirrung.
The advantage to food production
can be seen in his example of a
soybean field in the sunlight. If eth
ylene production could be stalled,
more sunlight could enter the beans,
allowing more nutrients to be pro
cessed.

response of the plant, said Pirrung.
The research efforts in Pirrung's lab
and Yang's lab have provided an an
swer to the first question and strong
clues about the answer to the second.
The starting point for Pirrung was
the immediate biosynthetic precursor
to ethylene. Examination of this
molecule yielded critical information
leading to the establishment of a
chemical mechanism for the synthesis

of the ethylene molecule.
The precursor is an amino acid that
is frequently found in plants but is not
incorporated -into proteins. Because
this amino acid was not a nutritionally
useful protein, it was generally
ignored in the early search for a
source of the ethylene molecule. The
amino acid, aminocyclopropanecar
boxylicacid (ACC), is broken down
into ethylene, carbon dioxide and
cyanide in the course of the reaction.
The proposed mechanisms of the
conversion of ACC into ethylene ne
glected an important consideration in
chemistry, that of spatial relation
ships, Pirrung said. The three
dimensional arrangement of atoms in
a molecule is specified by the mecha
nism of the reaction that leads to the
molecule's formation as well as by the
properties of the atoms themselves.
This arrangement of atoms is referred
to as the stereochemistry of the
molecule.
Pirrung realized in his examination
of the proposed method of synthesis
that the stereochemical considera

tions in regard to the ethylene
molecule produced from ACC could
lead to important insights into the re
action mechanism.
The original mechanism suggested
by the UC-Davis researchers would
have led to a single or favored
stereochemical product.
To test the mechanism, Pirrung
took an ACC molecule tagged with
radioactive hydrogens attached to the
carbons that become ethylene in the
course of the reaction. The radioac
tive hydrogens, called deuterium,
were placed in the cis stereochemical
configuration, characterized by
having two atoms of a kind on the
same side of a molecule.
The products of the reaction
showed a mixture of the cis ethylene
product and its opposite stereochemi
cal configuration, trans, with the
tagged hydrogens on opposite sides of
the molecule.
This mixture of products suggested
a relatively random reaction that was
stepwise in its nature. From this in

formation, Pirrung was able to write
out a multi-step process involving a
complex chemical reaction in which
electrons, negatively charged sub
atomic particles, are ripped away
from the ACC molecule, causing its
eventual breakdown into ethylene.
The other question that surrounds
ethylene research is the mechanism
by which ethylene regulates the
plant's breakdown of cellulose and
the stress response of wilting. Eth
ylene causes the degeneration of a
damaged part of a plant (senescence)
and the eventual removal of the
wilted part (absecession).
Clues to this part of the mystery
have also come from the chemical ap
proach. "Being a chemist 1 like to
balance my chemical reactions," said
Pirrung. "The rest of the products of
the reaction are important to consider
in the regulation of the plant's
processes."
Among these products, cyanide
stood out as a possible control
molecule. Pirrung discussed the re
search with Chemistry Prof. John
Brauman, who felt that the ethylene
molecule itself could not be respon
sible for the biochemical changes in
the plant caused by its production and
that cyanide was the more likely
molecule. Further research has shown
that plants will ripen in the presence
of cyanide and it appears that its
function might be critical in the ripen
ing process.
This research can have an impact
on many aspects of food production.
"Ultimately it would be useful to
make a molecule that could prevent
ethylene's message from being sent or
from being received," said Pirrung.
The advantage to food production
can be seen in his example of a
soybean field in the sunlight. If eth
ylene production could be stalled,
more sunlight could enter the beans,
allowing more nutrients to be pro
cessed.

Research in the lab of one of Stan
ford's recently awarded young scien
tists, Asst. Chemistry Prof. Michael
Pirrung, focuses on the mechanism of
control over plant ripening. Pirrung's
research centers on the biosynthesis
of ethylene, the chemical that ac
tivates plant ripening and stress
responses.
Pirrung is one of eight Stanford
faculty members named as Presiden
tial Young Investigators for 1985 by
the National Science Foundation, in
recognition of outstanding potential
in research and teaching. Recipients
of the $500,000 award — spread over
a five-year period — are required to
have received their doctorates within
the last seven years. Pirrung, who
received his doctorate from UC-
Berkeley in 1980, has been at Stan
ford since 1981.
Pirrung's investigation of et
hylene's biosynthesis has brought to
gether the disciplines of chemistry
and plant physiology. Ethylene has
long been known as an essential fac
tor in the plant processes associated
with ripening and wilting, said Pir
rung. The hormone induces these
degenerative processes that lead to
the breakdown of hard tissues in
plants.
The puzzling aspect of the process
was the mechanism of ethylene's ef
fects, starting with its origin as a bio
chemical synthesized in the plant, Pir
rung said.
The process of ripening is charac
terized by the plant's production of
ethylene and the breakdown of hard
tissue such as cellulose into soft
tissues like sugars. This distinguishes
the taste of a hard green apple,
mainly composed of cellulose, from
the sweet taste of a red apple that has
most of its cellulose broken into
sugars.
The process of breakdown can be

initiated by the presence of ethylene,
which causes an autocatalytic reac
tion, Pirrung said. An autocatalytic
reaction is started or increased by the
presence of the final product, in this
case ethylene. This autocatalytic ef
fect is the reason for spraying unripe
fruit with ethylene, a gas at room
temperature. The spraying is fre
quently done in trunks en route to the
Midwest so the fruit can be ripened to
sell but not spoiled in transit, said Pir
rung.
Such artificial ripening leads to the
low quality of produce in the Mid
west, said Pirrung, noting the diffi
culty in obtaining good quality
tomatoes in Chicago. Pirrung also
suggested a method of softening the
hard avocados sold in supermarkets:
"If one places the avocados in a paper
bag with a banana the ethylene
produced by the quickly ripening
banana will trigger the reaction in the
avocado."
Pirrung first became interested in
the ethylene reaction when he ran
arrnins an article on the hormonal ef

fects of ethylene by a plant
physiologist, Shang Fa Yang, a pro
fessor at the UC-Davis Department
of Vegetable Crops. After looking at
the proposed mechanism of ethylene
biosynthesis from an organic
chemist's point of view, he realized it
could not be correct. "I saw that the
mechanism would not work and as a
chemist I felt I had something to con
tribute to understanding the
process," Pirrung said.
The two major questions at the
heart of this research are the mecha
nism of ethylene production and the
mechanism by which ethylene reg
ulates the ripening and stress
response of the plant, said Pirrung.
