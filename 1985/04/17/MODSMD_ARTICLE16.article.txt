# Officials shouldn't bend rules
## 
### 
Last Friday, ASSU Senator Richard Beigel, Senator
Mark Mazur and Eric Diesel, director of Tuesday Films,
put out an election flier entitled "Dump McGrath." In it
they made numerous allegations about ASSU Senator Jim
McGrath's behavior in the senate and instructed students
on how to vote to ensure his defeat in yesterday's and
today's elections.
The flier was a flagrant violation of University election
rules. Although The Daily reported Monday that Beigel,
Mazur and Diesel's actions will be "investigated as a pos
sible campaign violation," it takes little more than an abil
ity to read English to conclude that a blatant violation did
occur.

Here's the relevant campaign regulation: "No candi
date, slate or sponsor shall interfere with the campaigning
of any other candidate, slate or sponsor. . . . Failure to
obey this provision shall be grounds for disqualification."
The attempts at dodging responsibility by signers of the
flier borders on sickening. As The Daily reported Mon
day, Beigel now says that part of the statement about
McGrath was wrong. Oops. He has now decided that the
accusation that McGrath "has written financial reporting
requirements that make life more difficult for student or
ganization treasurers" was incorrect.
The reason? Beigel said he "confused the authorships"
of two bills dealing with financial reporting — apparently
Senate Chair Eric Berg wrote the bill that Beigel mis
takenly attributed to McGrath. The Daily said Mazur was
"reluctant" to retract the statement that appeared in the
flier, but would "go along with Beigel's retraction" since
Beigel wrote the piece. Honorable.
Sorry guys, but retracting a ladle-full of the defamatory
hogwash recklessly printed on 1,000 fliers and distributed
before an election doesn't make it OK. The time to decide
that you really don't mean what you say is certainly not
after you say it.
So they violated the rules. Beigel, who is running for re
election, and Diesel, who is sponsoring Tuesday Films,
should be disqualified from the elections. Let's delye a
little deeper: This sort of violation by ASSU veterans
deserves a little more attention. What did or didn't go
through these guys' minds when they put this flier to
gether and distributed it and why did they choose to vio
late the rules?
One important thing is missing from the actions of these
fellows: responsibility. It's time they learned about it.
Rule number one: You are responsible for your actions.
A conscious force was at work here, too, not only the
unconscious one of irresponsibility. These guys are not
stupid. I'm going to assume that two senators and a re
turning sponsor of Tuesday Films had full knowledge of
ASSU's campaign regulations.
Maybe that's assuming too much, but I don't think so.

They knew the rules. They knew they were violating
them. And they printed the flier anyway. They knew that
Beigel would be disqualified from the senate race and that
Diesel ran the risk of losing Tuesday Films. Maybe we're
supposed to view Beigel as a kamikaze candidate and
praise him for sacrificing his own chance at re-election
just to save us from Jim McGrath.
One thing is certain: They didn't give a damn about the
rules.
These same guys have ignored specific regulations
before. Last fall during national election time, Mazur
(then head of the now defunct Stanford Progressive Al
liance, or SPA) and Diesel (then director of the campus
Mondale-Ferraro campaign) flagrantly violated strict
University guidelines prohibiting the use of University
facilities for partisan political activity. Diesel's Mondale-
Ferraro used the University office telephone of SPA as a
contact point for campaign volunteers.
In addition to letting Mondale-Ferraro use the Univer
sity telephone, SPA allowed Students Against Reaganism,
or STAR, to use its telephone and other unspecified re
sources.
Last November, too, one thing was certain: They didn't
give a damn about the rules.
When people consciously violate rules or laws after
weighing the costs and benefits of their actions, it means a
couple of things: First, they don't respect the rules or laws,
and, second, the costs of violating them are not great
enough to prevent them from acting. Outside Stanford,
they call people who make that sort of decision criminals.
And they call people who make a habit of acting that way
repeat offenders.

Richard Beigel, who is run
ning for re-election, and
Eric Diesel, who is sponsor
ing Tuesday Films, should
be disqualified from the
elections.

So what do we do? Let people abuse rules whenever
they feel moved to do it? To allow anyone to make a
mockery of laws or of University rules and Stanford itself
is just plain unacceptable. But how do we convince people
that you just can't go around breaking the rules whenever
it suits your needs?
Every judge and every person with common sense
knows that you don't keep letting off repeat offenders
with slaps on the wrist. The goal of imposing penalties is
not simply to punish, but to eliminate the undesirable be
havior. And if a criminal doesn't respond to reason or
mild penalties, the judge doesn't say, "Oh well, he's just a
crazy kid" or, "Let's not be. to hard on the boy." He puts
him away for a long, long time.
He doesn't do this to be vindictive or for the fun of it.
He does it because if he doesn't, he lets a bunch of scamps
make a mockery of the law.

Every judge and every person with common sense

not simply to punish, but to eliminate the undesirable be

mild penalties, the judge doesn't say, "Oh well, he's just a
crazy kid" or, "Let's not be. to hard on the boy." He puts
him away for a long, long time.
He doesn't do this to be vindictive or for the fun of it.

Last Friday, ASSU Senator Richard Beigel, Senator
Mark Mazur and Eric Diesel, director of Tuesday Films,
put out an election flier entitled "Dump McGrath." In it
they made numerous allegations about ASSU Senator Jim
McGrath's behavior in the senate and instructed students
on how to vote to ensure his defeat in yesterday's and
today's elections.
The flier was a flagrant violation of University election
rules. Although The Daily reported Monday that Beigel,
Mazur and Diesel's actions will be "investigated as a pos
sible campaign violation," it takes little more than an abil
ity to read English to conclude that a blatant violation did
occur.

Here's the relevant campaign regulation: "No candi
date, slate or sponsor shall interfere with the campaigning
of any other candidate, slate or sponsor. . . . Failure to
obey this provision shall be grounds for disqualification."
The attempts at dodging responsibility by signers of the
flier borders on sickening. As The Daily reported Mon
day, Beigel now says that part of the statement about
McGrath was wrong. Oops. He has now decided that the
accusation that McGrath "has written financial reporting
requirements that make life more difficult for student or
ganization treasurers" was incorrect.
The reason? Beigel said he "confused the authorships"
of two bills dealing with financial reporting — apparently
Senate Chair Eric Berg wrote the bill that Beigel mis
takenly attributed to McGrath. The Daily said Mazur was
"reluctant" to retract the statement that appeared in the
flier, but would "go along with Beigel's retraction" since
Beigel wrote the piece. Honorable.
Sorry guys, but retracting a ladle-full of the defamatory
hogwash recklessly printed on 1,000 fliers and distributed
before an election doesn't make it OK. The time to decide
that you really don't mean what you say is certainly not
after you say it.
So they violated the rules. Beigel, who is running for re
election, and Diesel, who is sponsoring Tuesday Films,
should be disqualified from the elections. Let's delye a
little deeper: This sort of violation by ASSU veterans
deserves a little more attention. What did or didn't go
through these guys' minds when they put this flier to
gether and distributed it and why did they choose to vio
late the rules?
One important thing is missing from the actions of these
fellows: responsibility. It's time they learned about it.
Rule number one: You are responsible for your actions.
A conscious force was at work here, too, not only the
unconscious one of irresponsibility. These guys are not
stupid. I'm going to assume that two senators and a re
turning sponsor of Tuesday Films had full knowledge of
ASSU's campaign regulations.
Maybe that's assuming too much, but I don't think so.

They knew the rules. They knew they were violating
them. And they printed the flier anyway. They knew that
Beigel would be disqualified from the senate race and that
Diesel ran the risk of losing Tuesday Films. Maybe we're
supposed to view Beigel as a kamikaze candidate and
praise him for sacrificing his own chance at re-election
just to save us from Jim McGrath.
One thing is certain: They didn't give a damn about the
rules.
These same guys have ignored specific regulations
before. Last fall during national election time, Mazur
(then head of the now defunct Stanford Progressive Al
liance, or SPA) and Diesel (then director of the campus
Mondale-Ferraro campaign) flagrantly violated strict
University guidelines prohibiting the use of University
facilities for partisan political activity. Diesel's Mondale-
Ferraro used the University office telephone of SPA as a
contact point for campaign volunteers.
In addition to letting Mondale-Ferraro use the Univer
sity telephone, SPA allowed Students Against Reaganism,
or STAR, to use its telephone and other unspecified re
sources.
Last November, too, one thing was certain: They didn't
give a damn about the rules.
When people consciously violate rules or laws after
weighing the costs and benefits of their actions, it means a
couple of things: First, they don't respect the rules or laws,
and, second, the costs of violating them are not great
enough to prevent them from acting. Outside Stanford,
they call people who make that sort of decision criminals.
And they call people who make a habit of acting that way
repeat offenders.

Richard Beigel, who is run
ning for re-election, and
Eric Diesel, who is sponsor
ing Tuesday Films, should
be disqualified from the
elections.

So what do we do? Let people abuse rules whenever
they feel moved to do it? To allow anyone to make a
mockery of laws or of University rules and Stanford itself
is just plain unacceptable. But how do we convince people
that you just can't go around breaking the rules whenever
it suits your needs?
