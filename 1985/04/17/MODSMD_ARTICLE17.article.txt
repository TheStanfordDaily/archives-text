Thoughtful choices
All year long there have been
accusations that the ASSU is an
ineffective body, full of power
hungry resume-builders and
megalomaniacs. Well, now's the
chance to change the system for the
better. In the current election, we
must decide who will best represent
the entire student body and will
uphold the motto: "ASSU working
for you."
We encourage everyone to con
sider the platforms of the candidates
and slates on the merits of the ideas
presented, rather than simply upon
the enthusiasm with which they are
offered. Don't be fooled by cliches
about "effective" leadership and
catch-all phrases about commitment.
Instead, examine the specific
points given in each platform. Do the
candidates present specific
"solutions" to what are perceived as
the "problems" of the ASSU? And if
so, are their "solutions" realistic?
There's plenty of room for im
provement within the ASSU, and
many issues which must be addressed
by the candidates, including: group
funding, fee refunds, service proj
ects, the Coffee House, the in
frastructure of the ASSU and
communication and representation.
Some issues call for simple com
mon sense and innovation, while
others demand fundamental changes
in the present system. For instance,
communication and representation

can improve with informal meetings
of senators and dorms, a regularly
distributed ASSU News, and a
biweekly Daily report by an ASSU
liaison. Changes within the ASSU
might include a scaling down of the
size and scope of the senate.
Unless we elect candidates who
understand the issues and can work
to resolve the problems, we will only
lend to the bureaucratic image of the
ASSU. Think. And then vote. •

Playboy option
TODAY IS THE DAY. Playboy
is finally on the Stanford campus, in
advertisement form. The question is,
do you really want your picture in
Playboy?
Playboy will sell your body as
"Entertainment for men." Clothed
either fully or not at all, you will be
part of a gallery of sexual objects.
Your achievements will be trivialized
and made to seem sexually
suggestive.
The initial decision to pose is
yours, but Playboy makes the final
decisions. They decide what poses
they want, which photographs they'll
use. where your image is placed in
the layout and what personal infor
mation will accompany your photo.
After you sign a release, you lose all
rights to the photos and information

which once belonged to you.
You also have no control over how
you will be viewed by Playboy's
readership. Your body is beautiful,
and it belongs to you. Why let
Playboy turn it into a product? Sure,
tell people Playboy wanted you to
pose for them; but tell people you
turned Playboy down.

Vote for ASSURE
The ASSU Route Extender
(ASSURE) is the most important
item on today's election ballot. One
woman was reported raped Friday
night. Many other attacks go un
reported.
ASSURE could help stop these
crimes. ASSURE would continue the
present campus shuttle service until
12:30 at night; right now, bus service
stops at 6:15. ASSURE would run
six nights a week — from Sunday
through Friday night. ASSURE
would service the most far-flung
residences on campus— Escondido
and Governor's Corner. ASSURE
would cost approximately one dollar
a student per quarter — Santa Clara
buses cost 60 cents a ride, one way.
The SURE Escort Service sup
ports ASSURE. The ASSURE
shuttle bus would help SURE care
for more students by bringing more
students to their dorm than a jitney
could carry. ASSURE would free

SURE to take students directly to
their door in those few areas
ASSURE does not go. ASSURE
would allow SURE to concentrate
on services to the handicapped and
temporarily disabled.
Vote for ASSURE. Vote for a bus
that services both sexes; the rain falls
on men and women alike. Vote for a
fast ride home. Vote for a safe ride
home. Vote for yourself. Vote for
your friends. Vote for ASSURE.

The May field mystery
The Bug Me column of April 3 did
not completely or satisfactorily an
swer the question: "Where was
Mayfield and why did it disappear?"
Mayfield was what is now sometimes
referred to as South Palo Alto, with
its main street being California Ave
nue, mainly between the railroad
tracks and EI Camino Real. It was
there before the city of Palo Alto
existed, and was eventually
swallowed up by Palo Alto, as the
latter's southern boudaries kept
moving farther south. The streets
immediately south of the campus
with names of colleges are in the
College Terrace area, and the streets
across El Camino Real from there
were in the Southgate area, both
originally parts of Mayfield.

size and scope of the senate.
Unless we elect candidates who
understand the issues and can work
to resolve the problems, we will only
lend to the bureaucratic image of the
ASSU. Think. And then vote. •

Playboy option
TODAY IS THE DAY. Playboy
is finally on the Stanford campus, in
advertisement form. The question is,
do you really want your picture in
Playboy?
Playboy will sell your body as
"Entertainment for men." Clothed
either fully or not at all, you will be
part of a gallery of sexual objects.
Your achievements will be trivialized
and made to seem sexually
suggestive.
The initial decision to pose is
yours, but Playboy makes the final
decisions. They decide what poses
they want, which photographs they'll
use. where your image is placed in
the layout and what personal infor
mation will accompany your photo.
After you sign a release, you lose all
rights to the photos and information

which once belonged to you.
You also have no control over how
you will be viewed by Playboy's
readership. Your body is beautiful,
and it belongs to you. Why let
Playboy turn it into a product? Sure,
tell people Playboy wanted you to
pose for them; but tell people you
turned Playboy down.

Vote for ASSURE
The ASSU Route Extender
(ASSURE) is the most important
item on today's election ballot. One
woman was reported raped Friday
night. Many other attacks go un
reported.
ASSURE could help stop these
crimes. ASSURE would continue the
present campus shuttle service until
12:30 at night; right now, bus service
stops at 6:15. ASSURE would run
six nights a week — from Sunday
through Friday night. ASSURE
would service the most far-flung
residences on campus— Escondido
and Governor's Corner. ASSURE
would cost approximately one dollar
a student per quarter — Santa Clara
buses cost 60 cents a ride, one way.
The SURE Escort Service sup
ports ASSURE. The ASSURE
shuttle bus would help SURE care
for more students by bringing more
students to their dorm than a jitney
could carry. ASSURE would free

SURE to take students directly to
their door in those few areas
ASSURE does not go. ASSURE
would allow SURE to concentrate
on services to the handicapped and
temporarily disabled.
Vote for ASSURE. Vote for a bus
that services both sexes; the rain falls
on men and women alike. Vote for a
fast ride home. Vote for a safe ride
home. Vote for yourself. Vote for
your friends. Vote for ASSURE.

The May field mystery
The Bug Me column of April 3 did
not completely or satisfactorily an
swer the question: "Where was
Mayfield and why did it disappear?"
Mayfield was what is now sometimes
referred to as South Palo Alto, with
its main street being California Ave
nue, mainly between the railroad
tracks and EI Camino Real. It was
there before the city of Palo Alto
existed, and was eventually
swallowed up by Palo Alto, as the
latter's southern boudaries kept
moving farther south. The streets
immediately south of the campus
with names of colleges are in the
College Terrace area, and the streets
across El Camino Real from there
were in the Southgate area, both
originally parts of Mayfield.
