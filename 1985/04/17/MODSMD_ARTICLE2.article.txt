# White Plaza rally
## 350 protest Playboy 
### SHIRISH DATE Senior staff writer 
More than 350 people filled White Plaza yesterday
to hear speakers denounce Playboy magazine's visit to the
Stanford area to photograph women for its planned "Girls
of the Pac-10" pictorial.
The noontime protest was organized by Stanford Stu
dents Opposed to Pornography (STOP) and Women of
Stanford Law. It included skits satirizing Playboy photog
raphers and protest songs and speeches by, among others,
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Patricia Brandt Polhemus,
visiting Law Prof. Leonard Boudin, United Stanford
Workers leader Linda Crouse and Asst. Director of the
Row Keith Archuleta.
In addition, STOP member Vanessa Poster read a letter
supporting the protest written by film director Peter Bog
danovich, who was a friend of Dorothy Stratton, a
Playboy Playmate murdered by her ex-boyfriend.
Paul Engleman, a spokesman for Playboy Enterprises
in Chicago, said yesterday's protest would not affect the
magazine's plan to interview women for its October pic
torial. "Women who choose to pose in Playboy have a
right to choose for themselves, just as people at Stanford
have a right to protest," he said.
Sherral Snow, assistant to the Playboy photographer
currently in Palo Alto, said she was not worried about yes
terday's rally or STOP's plan to picket the Holiday Inn
where she and photographer David Chan are staying.
"We've had people protest before, so it's not anything
new," she said.
In his letter, Bogdanovich urged Stanford women not to

pose for Playboy, writing that Stratton was "humiliated
and tortured and killed" because of her association with
the magazine's "pornography mills."
Poster, quoting Bogdanovich, read, "Stanford's image
would make Playboy look good: smart, classy and so Cali
fornia. Playboy's image, however, would do nothing for
Stanford
Polhemus said Playboy perpetuates stereotypes that
damage healthy sexual attitudes here. "There is the
feeling that [sex] is an object to be bought and sold, that is
in some ways separate from human feelings," she said.
"Sexuality holds out the opportunity for great pleasure
.. . but Playboy's not part of that."
She finished by urging students to continue their fight
against Playboy's visit to Stanford. Playboy "has become a
symbol, and as a symbol, we should dump it," she said.
Boudin, who in the past has defended such notables as
Dr. Benjamin Spock and Daniel Ellsberg, defended
Playboy's right to publish as a First Amendment right, but
called on students to "continue and accelerate protests of
this kind."
"When Playboy takes an ad, we must take an ad. When
Playboy people are here on the campus, there need to be
counter-demonstrations. . . . That's the essence of the
First Amendment: our right to protest these things," he
said.
Crouse, USWs chief steward, said Playboy and pornog
raphy in general reflect societal conditions every
woman must contend with. She said every woman, in the
