## Win over Long Beach would all but clinch it Card tries for playoff berth 
### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
As the cliche reads, teams like to
have their destiny in their own hands.
The Stanford men's volleyball team
isn't exactly empty-fisted at the mo
ment, but the Cardinal doesn't have a
firm grip on things, either.
Stanford, currently in fifth place in
the California Intercollegiate Volley
ball Association with a 9-8 mark, is
looking for its first-ever playoff bid.
But the Cardinal has to be wondering
about the status of that bid tonight as
it hosts Long Beach State in Maples
Pavilion at 7:30. Unlike the home
team, the visiting 49ers, at 2-14, are
long since out of the playoff picturc.
Entering its last league match of
the year, Stanford holds a slim half
game lead over sixth-place Hawaii.
The Rainbows, at 8-8, host fourth
place UC-Santa Barbara, 10-6, later
this week for two games.
If Santa Barbara can capture either
contest, the matter is resolved —
Stanford can immediately buy tickets
for the NCAAs later this month. But
if the Rainbows sweep the Gauchos,
the playoff picture will be'unfocused.
Stanford, Hawaii and Santa Bar
bara would be deadlocked with
identical league records of 10-8.
Stanford swept Hawaii in their season
series, but Santa Barbara has done
the same to the Cardinal. Finally,
Hawaii will have swept the season se
ries with the Gauchos. Got it? These
circumstances cloud even a simple

understanding of the situation.
If the layman is confused, it's no
wonder. So are league officials and
the Cardinal coaches. "I called the
(league) commissioner," Stanford
Co-coach Fred Sturm said, "and he
wasn't clear. The league adopted
rules three or four years ago to decide
ties, but they haven't been used
since.
"This match is significant in that to
win won't hurt our (playoff)
chances," Sturm said. "In that sense,
it's a must win." Players and coaches
must know, however, that a Stanford
victory or loss will not be telltale. In
the end, Stanford's season — whether
or not there's a pot of gold at the end
of the rainbow — boils down to the
distant series in Hawaii.
Long Beach, like the Cardinal, is in
limbo. Its season has been entirely
forgettable. Still, Sturm felt they
would come out ready to play. "Their
motivation is to bring everyone else
down. They're not going to the
playoffs and they'd like to see others
not go either.
"They're in a position where they
don't have anything to lose. They can
be very relaxed."
In an odd way, Stanford doesn't
have anything to lose either. The
thrill of its first real pennant drive
should, however, be inspiration
enough. "The guys are really
excited," Sturm said.
