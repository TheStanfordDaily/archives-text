# Pac-10 honors five from Farm
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
The Pacific 10 Conference an
nounced a few awards and honors
yesterday, and, to say the least,
Stanford raked most of them in.
The league announced it will
send a 10-man basketball team to
Australia for two weeks this sum
mer. Stanford Coach Tom Davis
will coach it, and junior forward
Earl Koberlein will play on it.
The Pac-10 also announced its
coach and player of the year for
both swimming and gymnastics.
Of the four awards, Stanford
people won three of them. Stan
ford Men's Swim Coach Skip Ken
ney was named Coach of the Year,
sophomore Pablo Morales was
Swimmer of the Year, and Men's
Gymnastics Coach Sadao Hamada
also received Coach of the Year
honors.
Davis said the coach of the
league's all-star team is chosen on
a seniority basis, and he knew for
some time that his turn to coach it
had arrived. "I enjoy the travel,
and coaching an all-star team, of
course, will be fun," he said.
The team, which will tour
Australia June 23 to July 8, con
sists of one player chosen by each
school. The Pac-10 All-Stars will
play three of their games against the
Australian National team, which
will return the favor next fall when
it will play at each Pac-10 school.
Joining Koberlein will be guards

Steve Beck of Arizona State, An
thony Taylor of Oregon, Darryl
Flowers of Oregon State and
Keith Morrison of Washington
State; forwards Leonard Taylor of
California and Paul Fortier of
Washington; and centers Joe
Turner of Arizona, Jack Haley of
UCLA and Charlie Simpson of
use.
"Our coaching staff felt that we
should go with one of the seniors,"
Davis said of the selection of
Koberlein. "It was a really close
decision, but we finally chose
Earl."
After the type of season Stan
ford's men's swimming team had,
it probably wasn't very tough for
the Pac-10 to chose Kenney and
Morales as its coach and swim
mer of the year.
Kenney led the Cardinal to an
other Pac-10 title and its first-ever
NCAA championship. Morales,
an Olympian, set American
records in the 100- and 200-yard
butterfly and swam a leg on
ford's 400 medley relay team that
also set an American mark. He
also set a school record in winning
the 200 individual medley.
"I'm very honored," Morales
said last night. "There are a lot of
people in the Pac-10 that the
honor could have gone to."
When it came to coaching,
however, there was no question
about Kenney's qualifications for
the honor, Morales said.
