# Netters host Irvine

### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's tennis team
may have this weekend's crucial
matches against USC and UCLA
on its mind, but it can't ignore the
competition this afternoon against
17th-ranked UC-Irvine.
Today's match will be a warmup
for Stanford's second meetings with
No. 4-ranked UCLA and No. 2-
ranked USC Friday and Saturday in
Los Angeles. Both those teams
were at Stanford two weeks ago,
and USC upset Stanford, the No. 1
team in the nation, 5-4. Stanford
defeated UCLA by the same score.
Stanford is playing Irvine today
for the first time this season. At No.
17, Irvine is ranked by the Head In
tercollegiate Tennis Standings

several notches above some Pacific
10 Conference Southern Division
teams like Arizona State and
Arizona.
Stanford played the Arizona
teams over the weekend and, with
two 8-1 wins, brought its Six-Pac
record to 5-1. Stanford Coach Dick
Gould was pleased that his team
won the two "mentally difficult"
matches, noting his team's task of
adjusting to two Arizona teams that
offered substantially less competi
tion than did USC and UCLA.
Stanford should get a little more
competition from Irvine, however.
The Anteaters, 25-8 overall, had
won seven consecutive matches
going into their 7-2 loss to Califor
nia yesterday.
Junior Bruce Man Son Hing

plays No. 1 singles for Irvine and, at
22-10 this year, is currently ranked
46th in the HITS poll. Ken Derr,
22-8, plays No. 2 singles, followed
by Darren Yates (21-11) and Brad
Ackerman (19-14).
Irvine's top doubles team of
Julian Barham and Yates is ranked
28th in the country with a 21-6
overall record.
Stanford will play a full lineup,
with the possible exception of Der
rick Rostagno, who missed both
matches against the Arizona teams
because of strep throat.
The Cardinal will definitely need
a full lineup to defeat USC Satur
day. Stanford beat the Trojans 6-3
earlier this season in the Intercol
legiate Tennis Coaches Association
finals.
