# Santa Clara saved from Card nine
## Rain washes away lead 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
SANTA CLARA — It was spring break all over again
for the Stanford baseball team yesterday at Buck Shaw
Stadium. The Cardinal was leading Santa Clara 5-0 when
the game was rained out after four innings — one inning
shy of the five required for a complete game.
Over break, Stanford had three games washed out com
pletely and had another against UC-Santa Barbara shor
tened to six innings.
Stanford scored all of its runs in the first against Santa
Clara starter Ward Merdes. Pete Stanickek walked, went
to third on a double by Ruben Amaro and scored on a
wild pitch. After Mark Davis walked, Rick Lundblade
drilled an RBI single to left.
John Ramos drove Lundblade across with a double
down the left-field line. Then, with two outs, designated
hitter Doug Robbins smacked a two-run single to left.
The rain began in the second, and by the end of the in

ning, the umpires decided to suspend play. After about 40
minutes, the game resumed, but Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said the delay was what ultimately cost his team
its 29th win of the season.
"That's the second time this year I've disagreed with
the way it's been handled," Marquess said. "There was
about a half an hour where it wasn't ideal, but it was
playable."
Both the Cardinal offense and starter Kevin Kunkel did
their best to get five innings in. After the first, Stanford
sent only three men to the plate in each of the remaining
three innings. Kunkel pitched three shutout innings, al
lowing only two hits.
"It was one of his better outings," Marquess said. "He
had good control and a good breaking ball today."
After Lee Plemel retired the Broncos without a run in
the fourth, a real downpour began. Fifteen minutes later,
it became obvious that there would be no more baseball
for this overcast afternoon, and the game was called.
