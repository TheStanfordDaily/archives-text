# Levy and Besosa lead gymnasts to best finish
## 
### JENNIFER KOCH Staff sportswriter 
Randy Besosa wasn't uptight going into the
NCAA Gymnastics Championships last
weekend.
"We had nothing to lose. We made it when
nobody expected us to, and we just wanted to
go in and have a good showing," he said.
The six-member Stanford team did indeed
have a good showing, finishing seventh in its
first appearance in NCAA team competition.
Last season the Stanford team finished
ranked 15th in the country. Its preseason
ranking this year was No. 16, making its
move to seventh place the biggest jump in
Stanford history.
Besosa, a 5-foot-7 sophomore who finished
19th in the all-around, feels tne reason for
Stanford's success this season is an "increase

in personal ambition. Interest in the sport has
gone beyond gymnastics on the college level."
Teammate Jon Levy agreed, saying, "This
year has been more gymnastics-oriented.
Team members are concentrating on it rather
than seeing it as an obstacle to their studies."
A junior, Levy finished fifth in the all
around in the NCAA meet, moving up from
his Isth-place ranking last year, when he com
peted as an individual. With regard to his per
formance, Levy explained, "I expected to do
better than some people thought I would, but
not that well."
Levy, who made it to the finals in rings at
last years NCAAs, scored a 9.6 on the parallel
bars last weekend. That gave him sixth place
in that event, high enough for All-America
status.
"I was surprised to have done that well on

parallel bars, which, ironically, is one of my
weaker events. I barely missed qualifying for
finals in three other events. My best event is
the rings, which come easy to me. And my fa
vorite is floor exercise, where I have the most
freedom and the most control over my body,"
he said.
Besosa says his favorite event has always
been the high bar. "I'm up in the air and I
know I can hurt myself. 1 like the risk in
volved."
Besosa, who also competed in last year's
NCAAs as an individual, believes that com
peting as part of a team gave the tournament
a much different atmosphere.
"Competing with the same people that I
have competed with all season made the at
mosphere much more relaxed. There seemed
to be more energy. Gary Smith had a personal
best in the all-around, and Mark Arnold came
close to his best score," he said.
Levy said that having his teammates pres
ent made the competition seem "more like a
big meet. Since the whole team went, I could
make no excuses for myself. The positive en
thusiasm made it feel different than a routine
meet."
Besosa, who made major changes in both
his pommel horse and floor routines before
this competition, said of his performance, "I
was fairly consistent, but not my best on any
event. I had a rough routine on rings and was
careful after that. I wasn't completely on, but
I was able to minimize my deductions."
Besosa noted that "the season is not over."
He and Levy, as well as teammates Chuck
Gerardo and Mike Matzek, will go on to com
pete in the Championships of the United
States, a federation independent of collegiate
gymnastists.
These four gymnasts will continue to train
until May, when they will compete in a quali
fying meet at UCLA. The top 72 gymnasts in
the country, as decided by this competition,
will then go on to compete for 24 spots on the
U.S. national team.
Besosa and Levy finished in the top 72 last
year, but failed to qualify for the national
team. Both gymnasts feel that may change
this year. As Levy says,"This year, I want to
make the National team. If I do as well as I
have the last couple meets, I think my chances
are pretty good."
Both Besosa and Levy will also be compet
ing in the Maccabiah Games in Israel this
summer. They were selected, by Olympic
gymnastics coach Abie Grossfield and several
college coaches, as two of the six gymnasts to

represent the United States based on their
performance during the collegiate season.
The future of the Stanford gymnastics team
looks at least as bright as that of these two
gymnasts. Led by coach Sadao Hamada, the
Pacific 10 Conference Coach of the Year, the
team is expecting a finish among the top five
schools next year.
This is due in part to support from the Ath
letic Department in the form of three more
gymnastics scholarships. In addition, the team
will compete with two new freshman recruits
next year. With only a six-member team this
year, every gymnast had to compete in every
meet.
"Hamada held back on difficulty levels for

some of us because we couldn't afford an in
jury. I don't think we reached our full poten
tial," says Levy. Besosa feels this will change
next year. "Next season we will be able to
switch off meets. It also brings in more com
petition as to who will compete for the spots,"
he said.
Besosa and Levy both feel that Stanford's
appearance at the NCAAs last weekend
generated a great deal of respect for the team.
As Levy said, "Just by being there we
surprised a lot of people. Stanford was never
before considered as one of the top 10 spots,
but several of the coaches at the meet said
that Stanford looked classy. People will start
looking at us now."
