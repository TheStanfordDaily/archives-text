# Cardinal softball hosts Long Beach

### DAVE DUTCHER Senior sportswriter 
The Stanford softball team will be looking for
a first today in its final home double-header of
the season.
The Cardinal, 10-38, is trying to make San
Diego State its first Western Collegiate Athletic
Association victim after 10 losses. To do so,
Stanford's bats will likely have to come through
against good pitching. The first game is sched
uled for 1 p.m. at Roble Field.
San Diego State's pitchers boast a 1.15
earned run average, and there isn't much differ
ence between the possible starting pitchers.
Robyn Reid has a 1.13 ERA, and Laurie
Thompson's is 1.37.
"I don't think their pitchers are better than
anything we've seen this season," said Stanford
Coach Kathy Lincoln, who said she watched the
Aztecs play early this season. "They're pretty
basic â€” not a lot of change-ups or a lot of
movement on the ball."
The Cardinal is coming off a pair of losses,
8-4 and 4-0, to WCAA foe Long Beach State

here Saturday. Stanford had but six hits in the
14 innings against Long Beach State, and three
were in its four-run first inning in the opener.
The Cardinal was held to one hit in the
nightcap.
One bright spot at the plate for Stanford,
however, has been freshman Maria De La Rosa.
She tripled in a run in a 5-3 first-game victory
over Cuesta College at Roble Friday and
doubled against Cuesta in the second game, a 3-
2 Stanford triumph.
While San Diego State's pitching is strong, its
hitting doesn't appear to be. The Aztecs have a
.200 batting average, which might mean easy
pickings for likely Cardinal starters Betsy Wat
son, 5-21, and Lisa Buchanan, 5-17. San Diego
State's offense is led by Katy Murphy, who is
hitting .287 and has 10 runs batted in.
A few hours after today's double-header,
Stanford will head to Reno, Nev., for the six
team Reno Invitational. The Cardinal will play
Portland State, Hayward State and Nevada-
Reno tomorrow and Oregon and St. Mary's
Friday.
