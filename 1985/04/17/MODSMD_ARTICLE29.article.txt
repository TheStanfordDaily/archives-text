Women's rugby
The Stanford women's rugby team brought
home another first-place trophy last weekend.
The Cardinal won the 20th annual Santa Bar
bara Invitational, one of the largest tourna
ments in the country, for its third straight tourn
ament victory.
Stanford defeated the Belmont Shores club
Sunday in an outstanding defensive match to
win the championship. Neither team scored in
regulation or in two overtime periods.
The game came down to a kickoff. The teams
remained tied through three rounds, but the
Cardinal outscored Belmont Shores 2-1 in the
fourth round to claim victory. Joan Sanders and
Jennifer Crawford scored for Stanford.
Crawford was named the Most Valuable
Back of the tournament, the second tournament
this year the junior has received that honor.
Men's lacrosse
Playing on their home turf in the 16-team
Michelob Western States Lacrosse Tournament
held here last weekend, the Stanford men's
lacrosse team made it all the way to the semi
finals — the team's best performance in the
tournament since 1977 — before finally falling

to the Marin Lacrosse Club, 10-4.
Stanford earned the right to take on Marin in
the semifinals on Sunday after trouncing
Oregon Saturday morning, 15-5, and then com
ing from behind that afternoon to defeat the
Old Mission Bay Athletic Club (OMBAC) 11-
7.
On Sunday, Stanford found itself outplayed
by a more experienced club team from Marin.
The Cardinal, who fared better than any other
college team in the tournament, fell behind
early and never caught up.
Stanford, still undefeated in the Northern
Conference of the Western Collegiate Lacrosse
Association with a 10-0 record, will play on the
road this Saturday against Pacific. It will be the
Cardinal's last league game of the year before
the playoffs on April 27.

pointing 12th in the Admiral's Cup regatta in

events.
