# Hotel: no photos
## Playboy's setup in jeopardy? 
### SHIRISH DATE Senior staff writer 
Playboy's photographer came to
town yesterday to interview Stanford
women for the "Girls of the Pac-10"
pictorial, but the hotel where he is
staying is less than receptive about
the magazine's advertisement telling
women to "ask for the Playboy Suite"
and about its plans to photograph
women there.
According to Paul Engleman of
Playboy Enterprises in Chicago, the
magazine's advertisement soliciting
Stanford models asks interested
"coeds" to call David Chan at the
Palo Alto Holiday Inn and "ask for
the Playboy Suite."
But Holiday Inn General Manager
Daniel Rodriguez said the hotel has
no "Playboy Suite," and any attempt
by the magazine to imply that the
Holiday Inn did have one would
make him "consult with [his] lawyer."
Engleman said yesterday afternoon
that he had "not received any com
plaint" from Rodriguez regarding the
use of the term "Playboy Suite."
Chan and Sherral Snow, his assis
tant, said they did not know who
composed the advertisement. Both,
however, said previous advertise
ments in college papers had not in
cluded the term.

Chan and Snow checked into the
Holiday Inn in Palo Alto yesterday
afternoon to set up interviews with
prospective models for the maga
zine's October issue. Chan plans to
advertise in The Daily today, tomor
row and Friday, asking for interested
women to call him and schedule an
interview.
Chan said interviews would consist
of talking with the women and taking
Polaroid snapshots of them for identi
fication purposes. "I'll just be taking
Polaroid pictures, that's all," he said.
Chan also said women could bring
along snapshots of their own if they
wanted. The photographs are "to
remind me what they look like," he
added.
Rodriguez, however, said Playboy
had no right to take any photographs
for commercial purposes in the hotel.
"They must have authorization to
take pictures in the hotel," he said.
"I have no intention of giving au
thorization" to anyone, he added.
"No matter what kind of pictures
they want to take, the answer is no."
Laurie Wedemeyer, a member of
Stanford Students Opposed to Por
nography, said she believes the
Holiday Inn is condoning Playboy's
activities by renting the rooms. "If
you own and operate a business, you
always have the right to refuse ser
vice. ... I find it objectionable that
they're allowing him to conduct busi
ness there," she said.
But a spokeswoman for the hotel
who declined to be identified said
Holiday Inn has taken no position on
Playboy. "We haven't condoned any
thing," she said. "All they're doing is
staying here, and that's it."
Chan said he expects 50 to 60
women to interview with him by Sun
day. He added that he would ask the
women to wear "something sum
mery."
"I don't want them to wear Mid
western clothes — jeans and over
coats — so you can't tell whether
they're overweight," he said.
