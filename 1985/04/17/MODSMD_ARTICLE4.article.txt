# Police arrest Cal protesters

BERKELEY — As the sun set on
the steps of UC-Berkeley's Sproul
Hall yesterday, a group of anti
apartheid protesters painted signs:
"Dreams are a weapon too. Sleep in
at Biko Steps."
And as the sweet smell of spray
paint floated through the cool air,
about 50 more protesters huddled to
discuss their plans as the sixth day of
their sit-in and the first day of arrests
ended on the steps of Sproul Hall, the
UC-Berkeley administration building
the protesters have renamed "Biko
Hall" after Stephen Biko, a South
African student who opposed apart
heid until he was killed in prison.
It had been a long day for the
protesters, many of whom had been
there since sunrise yesterday, when
UC police arrested 141 of their com
patriots for trespassing and illegal
lodging. Of those, at least 20 — in
cluding one who allegedly bit UC
Police Officer James Hammett — will
be charged with resisting arrest.
The arrests came after repeated
warnings from UC police and admi
nistrators. "The protest on Sproul
Hall steps . . . has become illegal
despite repeated efforts by the ad
ministration to ensure that campus

rules are observed," University
Chancellor Ira Michael Heyman said
in a letter distributed on campus
Monday morning.
According to witnesses to yester
day's arrests, police warned the
protesters three times before they
opened the doors to Sproul and es
corted the ones who would be ar
rested into the building to be booked.
Only those protesters who chose to
remain on the steps despite the warn
ings were arrested.
Hours later, 17 more protesters —
many of them Associated Students of
the University of California senators
— were arrested at University Hall, a
UC system-wide administration
building, when they refused to leave
after meeting with a UC representa
tive who declined to grant their
demands.
The arrested protesters were taken
in buses to the Alameda County Jail
Center at Santa Rita, where approxi
mately 50 — those charged with
resisting arrest and those who refused
to give their correct names —
remained last night, according to a
reporter at The Daily Californian,
Berkeley's student-run newspaper.

were asking that all charges be
dropped against the protesters arrest
ed at Sproul, and that a treasurer's
report on UC investments in South
Africa be delivered at the May UC
Regents meeting at Berkeley, and not
at the June meeting at UC-Santa
Cruz.
The second point is also one of the
demands of the Sproul Hall
demonstrators. The demonstrators
claim UC holds 30 percent of its
stock, or $1.7 billion, in firms that do
business in South Africa. The regents,
however, compute their South
African holdings at about $17 million
by counting only the percentage of
each investment that corresponds to
the percentage of a company's total
business that is related to South
Africa.

The demonstrators fear that if the
regents consider the South African
question at their meeting at UC-
Santa Cruz in June, when school is
out of session, they will not be
exposed to the intense opposition stu
dents feel to apartheid. However, UC
administrators say the treasurer's
report, containing necessary informa
tion for the regents' decision, will not
be ready until June.
The demonstrators have also
demanded that UC immediately
divest of all its stock in companies
doing business in South Africa, but
one student protester said yesterday ,
that there is dissension among the
demonstrators over whether they are
willing to wait for such a move before
ending their sit-in.
Although the arrests had thinned
their ranks yesterday, protesters said
their movement is "just beginning."
Mario Savio, the father of the Free
Speech Movement that began with a
rally in Sprout Plaza 20 years ago,
returned yesterday to urge more than
1,000 people at a mid-day rally to
continue the fight against apartheid.
"It's a nationwide demonstration,"
Savio said to an audience that in
cluded students perched in trees to
hear him. "The students at Columbia
and Rutgers are watching you. Don't
let them down."
"They're saying, if the Berkeley
students can be crushed, other stu

dents can be crushed, too. But they
won't crush Berkeley students."
The demonstrators agree. Yester
day afternoon they began to dis
tribute thousands of yellow fliers call
ing for a boycott of all classes today.
They said that representatives of
Berkeley's Graduate Student Union
were calling all research assistants
and teaching assistants to urge them
not to hold their sections, and that
because the Alameda County Labor
Council supported the boycott, some
union workers would call in sick for
their UC-Berkeley jobs today.
Meanwhile, other organizers
planned today's activites: a last
minute boycott poster drive at 7 a.m.,

a morning study-in at Berkeley's stu
dent union, a 1 p.m. press conference
at the Golden Bear statue, a 2 p.m.
teach-in on the women's movement
and a 5 p.m. teach-in on the meaning
of civil-disobedience arrests, and, ot
course, the all-day and all-night sit
in.
Response to the protest has been
"overwhelming," said Berkeley
senior Martin Bucher. "We'd always
written off some groups, like fraterni
ties, but now they're coming to us and
saying, 'We're with you on this, too.' "
Sophomore Tom Bridle, who
passed out red ribbons of solidarity

yesterday, said that passers-by had
already given him almost $100 to
help pay for protest fliers and signs,
and that a number of people had
stopped at Sproul to donate food for
the protesters.
But at about 5:30 p.m. yesterday,
five Berkeley freshman walked
through the protest, saying in stage
whispers that they hoped to see police
"bash some heads" at the rally.
"They don't have the right to block
our doors and put up posters on the
property of the people of California,"
said Gil Sheppard, one of the fresh
men.
The protesters, however, say they
will continue, and that their move

ment will grow.
"Even today, with 160 of the core
people arrested, the rally was bigger
and better than ever before," Bridle
said. "And there were fresh faces
there today. It's growing, and it's not
going to die. It's really not going to
die."
But the real test will come tomor
row, Bridle said, when Berkeley's
four-day spring break begins. He said
the group's staying power will be de
termined by how many people stick
with the protest through the break
and how many return afterward.
Don Talbert, a member of the Bay
Area for a Free South Africa move

ment, said he is confident the protest
will continue.
"We plan to stay here," he said,
"just like they're doing all across the
country, in New York and Pittsburgh
and in Colorado."
Meanwhile, at Stanford yesterday
the Black Student Union released a
statement saying it would meet with
University President Donald Ken
nedy this afternoon to ask him to
"demonstrate leadership in the
struggle to end apartheid." The group
will also hold a press conference to
announce a boycott of companies
operating in South Africa and to
"outline its strategy for ending U.S.
and Stanford support for apartheid."
