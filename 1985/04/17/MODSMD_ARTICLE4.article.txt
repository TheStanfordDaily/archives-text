BERKELEY — As the sun set on
the steps of UC-Berkeley's Sproul
Hall yesterday, a group of anti
apartheid protesters painted signs:
"Dreams are a weapon too. Sleep in
at Biko Steps."
And as the sweet smell of spray
paint floated through the cool air,
about 50 more protesters huddled to
discuss their plans as the sixth day of
their sit-in and the first day of arrests
ended on the steps of Sproul Hall, the
UC-Berkeley administration building
the protesters have renamed "Biko
Hall" after Stephen Biko, a South
African student who opposed apart
heid until he was killed in prison.
It had been a long day for the
protesters, many of whom had been
there since sunrise yesterday, when
UC police arrested 141 of their com
patriots for trespassing and illegal
lodging. Of those, at least 20 — in
cluding one who allegedly bit UC
Police Officer James Hammett — will
be charged with resisting arrest.
The arrests came after repeated
warnings from UC police and admi
nistrators. "The protest on Sproul
Hall steps . . . has become illegal
despite repeated efforts by the ad
ministration to ensure that campus

rules are observed," University
Chancellor Ira Michael Heyman said
in a letter distributed on campus
Monday morning.
According to witnesses to yester
day's arrests, police warned the
protesters three times before they
opened the doors to Sproul and es
corted the ones who would be ar
rested into the building to be booked.
Only those protesters who chose to
remain on the steps despite the warn
ings were arrested.
Hours later, 17 more protesters —
many of them Associated Students of
the University of California senators
— were arrested at University Hall, a
UC system-wide administration
building, when they refused to leave
after meeting with a UC representa
tive who declined to grant their
demands.
The arrested protesters were taken
in buses to the Alameda County Jail
Center at Santa Rita, where approxi
mately 50 — those charged with
resisting arrest and those who refused
to give their correct names —
remained last night, according to a
reporter at The Daily Californian,
Berkeley's student-run newspaper.
