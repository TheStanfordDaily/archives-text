### MARY YUH Editorial staff 
A woman was arrested yesterday after she abandoned
her newborn child in a Stanford Hospital parking lot,
police said.
Identified as 37-year-old Betty Ann Johnson from New
York City, the woman was apprehended at the Hoover
Pavilion annex next to the hospital shortly after the baby
was found in the back of a pickup truck in a hospital em
ployee parking lot, Stanford Police Capt. Marvin Moore
said. She was treated at the Stanford Hospital, charged
with felony child abandonment and then taken to the
Santa Clara Valley Medical Center.
The baby girl, discovered around 10:30 a.m., was about
four hours old and still attached to her placenta when she
was brought to the hospital, according to Clinical Nursing
Coordinator Kathleen Palange. The baby was reported in
excellent condition at about 12:30 p.m., Palange said.
Santa Clara County Child Protective Services has
been contacted and the baby has been placed in protective
custody, Moore said. This is normal procedure in cases of
child abandonment and allows the hospital to provide
care, according to Palange.
It is unclear whether the baby will be placed in a foster
home or put up for adoption. Moore said. The possibility
exists that the babv will be returned to her mother, "but I

doubt it,"he said.
Johnson, taken in police custody to the hospital emer
gency department, required stitches to close tearing that
occurred during delivery, according to Mary Durando, an
emergency department supervisor. Johnson was reported
in stable condition.
Carol Jensen Vaughn, a hospital office assistant, said
that around 10:30 a.m. "two women came over and asked
for help."
Vaughn said she first called hospital security and then
followed the women to the pickup truck, where they saw
the baby, wrapped in what appeared to be drapery and
lying on newspapers in a cardboard box.
According to Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington,
another witness saw a woman put a baby in a pickup truck
and called hospital security. The woman, later identified
as Johnson, was found in the "brush behind the
mausoleum," he said.
Durando said Johnson told officers that she traveled
from New York to Florida to California and had been
camping in the woods near the mausoleum for at least
several weeks.
There were signs that Johnson "gave birth to the baby
there," Herrington said.
The baby is still at Stanford Hospital.
