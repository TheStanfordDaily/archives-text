Beirut sees worst strife in months
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Moslem militias battled in the streets of west
Beirut for the first time in months Monday, driving non-combatants to
cover with withering fire from rockets, automatic weapons and grenade
launchers.
Police said the American University hospital had received two dead
and 23 wounded from the fighting, while no immediate reports were
available from other hospitals and clinics. The battleground included the
main shopping and residential districts of the capital's Moslem sector.
At least two rockets struck the "Voice of Arab Lebanon" radio sta
tion run by the Sunni Moslem Mourabitoun faction, and it left the air.
The fighting started in the afternoon, pitting Berri's Amal militia
against its former allies of the Mourabitoun, " Ambushers" in Arabic.
Moslem politicians met at the home of the grand mufti, Sheikh Hassan
Khaled, the highest Moslem religious authority in Lebanon, and issued a
statement asking the Lebanese army to intervene.
But the fighting continued into thp night without letup.
Also yesterday, Israeli troops and their allies in the South Lebanon
Army militia raided the village of Yater in occupied south Lebanon,
rounding up 200 villagers, taking away eight men and blowing up seven
homes, a spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping force in the region re
ported.
Mexican drug leaders to stand trial
MEXICO CITY — The reputed leader of Mexico's major drug
empire, and 23 people arrested with him in the investigation of the
kidnap-murder of a U.S. narcotics agent, were ordered Monday to stand
trial on drug and weapons charges, a judge said.
The action by Federal Judge Jesus Hidalgo brings to nearly 40 the
number of people ordered to trial as part of the investigation.
None has been charged with the kidnap-murder of Drug Enforcement
Administration agent Enrique Camarena, however, including Ernesto
Fonseca, the reputed head of La Familia, or Rafael Caro Quintero, who
was ordered last week to stand trial. Caro Quintero has been called the
prime suspect in the Camarena case.
Camarena and the Pilot, who sometimes worked with him, were ab
ducted separately Feb. 7 in Guadalajara, capital of Jalisco state. Their
bodies were found March 5 on a ranch 60 miles southeast of the city.
"The formal imprisonment was decreed," Arzate Hidalgo said by
telephone of Fonseca and the others. He said only four were eligible for
bail.
They were arrested last Tuesday in Puerto Vallarta. Included in the
group are current and former agents of the Jalisco state judicial police
and two agents of the Federal Security Police.
There is no jury trial in Mexico. The judge has up to a year to hear tes
timony and determine guilt or innocence in a given case.
Shultz defends South Africa policy
WASHINGTON D.C. — Secretary of State George Shultz, respond
ing to critics who say U.S. policy toward South Africa perpetuates apart
heid, said yesterday the United States "must not throw American
matches on the emotional tinder of the region."
Shultz, speaking at a National Press Club luncheon, expressed sharp
opposition to a proposal before Congress that would ban new U.S. in
vestment and reduce U.S.-South African trade ties.
He said the proposal ignores the harm that would be inflicted
"precisely on the black majority whom the advocates of boycotts, em
bargoes and sanctions purportedly want to help.
"An economy that even now needs to create 250,000 new jobs for
young blacks each year and that will have twice as many of them enter
ing the job market by the turn of the century needs more job opportuni
ties, not fewer," he said. He added that a U.S. policy of exacerbating
hardship in South Africa could promote*" ipoe war" there..
Shultz spoke as the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Com
mittee held hearings on a proposal by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.)
and Sen. Lowell Weicker (R-Conn.) to reduce U.S. economic links to
South Africa.
The proposal would prohibit new U.S. investment in South Africa, the
sale of computers to that country and the import of South African gold
coins, known as Krugerrands.
Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.) said "there is a substantial amount of biparti
san support" in Congress this year for some type of anti-apartheid mea
sure.
He said the administration's policy of "constructive engagement"
toward South Africa is "not yielding results" and should be replaced by
a more activist policy.
Weicker said the South African government "will only trust the sin
cerity of our opposition to apartheid when we back it up with economic
sanctions."
Kennedy, alluding to South Africa's decision on yesterday to repeal
laws banning interracial marriages, described the measure as "too little,
too late."
But Shultz said the process of racial change is under way in South
Africa, commenting that there has been more reform in the past four
years than in the previous 30.
Ex-CIA men split over 'Contra' aid
WASHINGTON D.C. — Former CIA Director Stansfield Turner
urged Congress yesterday to reject President Reagan's proposal to
release $14 million in aid to the "Contras" in Nicaragua, calling it "a
dead-end policy" in Central America.
"The Nicaraguan communists are not an immediate threat to the
United States and its interests in Central America," Turner said.
Turner, who headed the agency under former President Carter, tes
tified before a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee which also heard
Ray Cline, a former deputy director of the CIA who firmly supports
Reagan's policy.
"If the United States turns its back on this group (the Contras) there
will be moves to accommodate with communist regimes throughout the
world and in Nicaragua." Cline said.
Republican and Democratic sources in the House predicted that the
Contra aid plan would lose by 30 votes, despite an intensifying lobbying
campaign by Reagan and his allies. A close vote in the Republican-led
Senate was predicted.
Under the proposal to be voted on next week, the $14 million would
go as humanitarian assistance to the Contras seeking overthrow of the
Sandinista government in Managua.
But if negotiations between the Sandinistas and the Contras failed, the
money would then be spent for weapons for the rightist rebels supported
by the president.
In a statement released by their U.S. embassy, the Sandinista govern
ment said, "No amount of manipulation will change the fundamental
fact that the Contras are guilty of the most atrocious crimes against the
Nicaraguan people."
Princess confirms father's Nazi ties
LONDON — Princess Michael of Kent, a Czechoslovak-born aristo
crat who married into Britain's royal family, confirmed Monday that her
father was an officer in Adolf Hitler's SS and said she was shocked by
the discovery, Buckingham Palace reported.
A palace statement said Baron Gunther von Reibnitz was part of the
elite Nazi force that ran concentration camps during World War II and
was responsible for the extermination of 6 million Jews.
Princess Michael, 40, learned of her father's past as a result of inves
tigations by the Daily Mirror newspaper and "this evening confirmed
that her father had been a member of the SS," the brief statement said.
Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, said Princess Mi
chael had grown up in Australia believing her father was a hero. She had
been told that he was in a concentration camp during,part of the war, the
report said.
Michael Shea. Queen Elizabeth ll's press secretary, said in the palace
statement: "It came as a total surprise to her when she heard the news
from James Whitaker (a Daily Mirror reporter) and it came as a total
shock. There will be no further comment or statement from the
princess."
But the Daily Mirror said Shea's statement that the princess never
knew her father was an SS major was "unbelievable."
