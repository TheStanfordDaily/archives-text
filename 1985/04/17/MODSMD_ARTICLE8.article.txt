# Reagan to visit concentration camp
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” President Reagan, in an
about-face designed to squelch the bitter outcry
over his decision to visit a German cemetery where
Nazis are buried, shouldered the blame yesterday
and announced he will visit a concentration camp
or similar site during his European trip next month.
But Jewish leaders who had criticized Reagan for
the decision to lay a wreath at the military cemetery
in Bitburg were not mollified, saying the ceremony
is inappropriate even if Reagan pays tribute to the
victims of the Holocaust.
Speaking to a group of about 200 religious
leaders, Reagan acknowledged that his decision not
to schedule a visit to the concentration camp at
Dachau had "provoked a storm of controversy."
Reagan said West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl had invited him to visit both the Bitburg cem
etery and a concentration camp. But Reagan said
the decision to bypass the concentration camp was
taken "because of my mistaken impression that
such a visit was outside the official agenda."
"Chancellor Kohl's recent letter to me, however,
has made it plain that my invitation to visit a con

centration camp was indeed a part of his planned
itinerary. So I have now accepted that invitation
and my staff is in Germany exploring a site that
would fit into our schedule there."
The president emphasized that he will keep the
Bitburg ceremony on his schedule, saying Kohl had
invited him to attend.
Such a visit was important, Reagan said, because
it would show that the United States and West Ger
many had turned their backs on the atrocities of
war and were able "to cement the 40 years of
friendship" between their two peoples.
"That's why I accepted the invitation to Bitburg
and that's why I'm going to Bitburg," Reagan said.
"For years I've said it, and I will say it again
today, and I will say it again on that occasion: We
must never forget the Holocaust nor should we
ever permit such an atrocity to happen ever again.
Never again," Reagan said.
"It was and remains my purpose, and that of
Chanellor Kohl, to use this visit to Germany on the
40th anniversary of the war's end in Europe to
commemorate not simply the military victory of 40
years ago but the liberation of Europe, the rebirth

of German freedom and the reconciliation of our
two countries," Reagan said.
"My purpose was and remains not to re
emphasize the crimes of the Third Reich in 12
years of power, but to celebrate the accomplish
ments" of the West Germans in their years of
freedom, Reagan said.
Reagan flies to Europe next month to take part
in the Bonn economic stfmmit of non-communist
nations, scheduled just before the 40th anniversary
of the surrender of Nazi Germany in May 1945.
Elie Wiesel, the chairman of the U.S. Holocaust
Memorial Council, said he was not satisfied with
Reagan's switch of plans. Wiesel spoke with
reporters after discussing the controversy with
Reagan's chief of staff, Donald Regan.
Wiesel told reporters that Reagan's visit to Bit
burg was still unacceptable because it contains
graves of the SS, the elite Nazi military unit.
"The SS are a symbol of international crime
against the Jewish people and humanity. It is the SS
who killed American war prisoners with their
hands. SS symbolize what we call Holocaust."
