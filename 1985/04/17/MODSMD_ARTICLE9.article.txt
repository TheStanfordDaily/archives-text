# CIA free to conceal sources
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The CIA and
other U.S. spy agencies are free to
conceal from the public the identities
of all intelligence sources, the Su
preme Court ruled yesterday.
The court, by a 7-2 vote, gave the
director of the Central Intelligence
Agency unlimited power to protect
not only secret agents but all other
sources of information — classified
and unclassified. That includes the
names of private scientists and re
searchers, and even academic jour
nals.
"Congress intended to give the
director of Central Intelligence broad
power to protect the secrecy and in
tegrity of the intelligence process,"
Chief Justice Warren Burger said for
the court.
"The reasons are too obvious to
call for enlarged discussion," he said.
"Without such protections the agency
would be virtually impotent."
The ruling comes at a time when
the Reagan administration is continu
ing to lobby Congress for broader ex
emptions from the Freedom of Infor
mation Act for intelligence and law
enforcement agencies.
Yesterday's decision overturned a
ruling that could have forced the CIA
to disclose the names of college re
searchers and others who contributed
to a notorious project in the 1950s
and 1960s involving brainwashing
and experimental drugs like LSD
being administered to unsuspecting
individuals.
At least two people died because of
the experiments.
The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals

ruled in 1983 in favor of a Ralph
Nader lobbying group that filed a
1978 suit under the Freedom of In
formation Act.
The appeals court said the CIA
may not withhold the names of its
sources merely, for example, to guard
against a public outcry. It said the
agency could conceal the names only
if it could show that the promise of
confidentiality was required to obtain
the information.
Burger said the appeals court
misunderstood "the realities of intel
ligence work, which often involves
seemingly innocuous sources as well
as unsuspecting individuals who pro
vide valuable intelligence informa
tion. A foreign government can learn
a great deal about the (ClA's) activi
ties by knowing the public sources of
information that interest the agency."
The CIA said the project was de
signed to counteract brainwashing
and use of mind-altering drugs by the
Chinese and Russians.
Justice Thurgood Marshall, in an
opinion joined by Justice William
Brennan, said Burger's opinion went
too far. The opinion "thwarts con
gressional efforts to balance the
public's interest in information and
the government's need for secrecy,"
Marshall said.
A congressional committee and a
presidential corn'ffrtssion investigated
the CIA project in the mid-19705,
shedding light on numerous abuses in
an effort that involved at least 80 in
stitutions and 185 private research
ers.
