AIDS seen as spreading
ATLANTA — AIDS is spreading beyond the
known risk groups to the general population, two
researchers said yesterday, but they differed over
how easily the deadly disease can be transmitted
through heterosexual contact.
"This is a general disease now," said Dr.
Robert Redfield, an infectious disease specialist
with the Walter Reed Institute of Research in
Washington, D.C. "Get rid of the high risk
groups— anyone can get it."
Dr. Walter Dowdle, director of the Center for
Infectious Disease at the federal Centers for
Disease Control, agreed that the virus is spread
ing to the general population, but said there "are
factors that indicate it's not going to be explo
sive."
Dowdle said transmission of the virus is diffi
cult enough that it is not likely to spread quickly
through the general population.
Until now, AIDS, an affliction in which the
body's immune system becomes unable to resist
disease, has been largely confined to
homosexuals, intravenous drug abusers -and
hemophiliacs, according to the CDC.
As of Monday, 9,500 cases of acquired
immune deficiency syndrome had been reported
to the CDC. Seventy-three percent had occurred
in homosexuals, 17 percent in drug abusers and
less than 1 percent in hemophiliacs.
The number of cases that have occurred
through heterosexual spread (77) is now higher
than the number of cases in hemophiliacs (64).
Any heterosexually active individual risks get
ting AIDS, even if contact with prostitutes and
drug abusers is avoided, Redfield said in an inter
view.
"The more (sexual) activity one has — particu
larly if it crosses over into these high risk groups,
the greater the risk" of getting AIDS, he said.
"I think you can tell people if they have one or
two or three sex partners, their risk of getting
AIDS is low," he said. "But if they have 30, their
risk is higher."

He also emphasized that, despite the spread of
disease to the general population, there is still no
evidence that it can spread from one prison to an
other except by inmate contact.

Soft drink bill defeated
WASHINGTON — A Senate committee, after
lobbying by the soft drink industry, defeated yes
terday a proposal that would have required prod
ucts containing aspartame to carry labels telling
people how much of the artificial sweetener they
are consuming.
The Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee defeated the labeling amendment on
a 9-7 party-line vote, with Republicans voting
against and Democrats voting for the disclosure
label.
The debate yesterday focused on the labeling
proposal for aspartame, which is sold under the
trade name NutraSweet and which some scien
tists say may be dangerous. Supporters of the
labeling requirement said it would at least allow
consumers to know how much of the substance
they are taking.
"What we're talking about is the right to know
for consumers," said Sen. Edward Kennedy of
Massachusetts, senior Democrat on the commit
tee. "We underestimate the consumer if we think
they are not interested or concerned, particularly
about their children."
CBS' fate undecided
CHICAGO — CBS Inc. kept its corporate eye
wide open yesterday at the network's annual
meeting, held against a background of soaring
stock prices and rumors that broadcasting
maverick Ted Turner was continuing efforts for a
hostile takeover.

The nearly three-hour meeting, comic and
chaotic at times, ended with no indication Turner
was any nearer to acquiring the company than
when the day began.
The "CBS Evening News" reported yesterday
that a Turner lawyer informed the Federal Com-,
munications Commission that Turner's formal
application for approval to take over the network
would be filed today.
Turner, who was in New York, refused com
ment.
Toward the end of the shareholders' meeting,
Wyman was asked whether he felt Turner was
"moral" enough to run CBS.
"I have expressed something less than total en
thusiasm in the past for the thought of him
managing this enterprise," Wyman said.
Former anchorman Walter Cronkite, a direc
tor of CBS, said Tuesday the network had always
given its news division freedom to operate, add
ing, "I see nothing in Ted Turner's record that'
would indicate we could have that kind of inde
pendence."
Turner is not the only suitor for the front
running network.
A conservative group. Fairness in Media,
which is affiliated with Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.),
has urged its supporters to buy CBS stock to end :
a perceived liberal bias in the network's news ;
reporting and "become Dan Rather's boss."
Stocks post small gain
The stock market churned out another small !
gain yesterday, continuing the slow-motion rally '
it began early last week.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, after
bouncing back and forth in a narrow range all \
day, closed with a 2.76 advance at 1,272.31. The '
average has risen for seven consecutive sessions,
but its net gain over that span has been just 19.33 '

"This is a general disease now," said Dr.
Robert Redfield, an infectious disease specialist
with the Walter Reed Institute of Research in
Washington, D.C. "Get rid of the high risk
groups— anyone can get it."
Dr. Walter Dowdle, director of the Center for
Infectious Disease at the federal Centers for
Disease Control, agreed that the virus is spread
ing to the general population, but said there "are
factors that indicate it's not going to be explo
sive."
Dowdle said transmission of the virus is diffi
cult enough that it is not likely to spread quickly
through the general population.
Until now, AIDS, an affliction in which the
body's immune system becomes unable to resist
disease, has been largely confined to
homosexuals, intravenous drug abusers -and
hemophiliacs, according to the CDC.
As of Monday, 9,500 cases of acquired
immune deficiency syndrome had been reported
to the CDC. Seventy-three percent had occurred
in homosexuals, 17 percent in drug abusers and
less than 1 percent in hemophiliacs.
The number of cases that have occurred
through heterosexual spread (77) is now higher
than the number of cases in hemophiliacs (64).
Any heterosexually active individual risks get
ting AIDS, even if contact with prostitutes and
drug abusers is avoided, Redfield said in an inter
view.
"The more (sexual) activity one has — particu
larly if it crosses over into these high risk groups,
the greater the risk" of getting AIDS, he said.
"I think you can tell people if they have one or
two or three sex partners, their risk of getting
AIDS is low," he said. "But if they have 30, their
risk is higher."

He also emphasized that, despite the spread of
disease to the general population, there is still no
evidence that it can spread from one prison to an
other except by inmate contact.

Soft drink bill defeated
WASHINGTON — A Senate committee, after
lobbying by the soft drink industry, defeated yes
terday a proposal that would have required prod
ucts containing aspartame to carry labels telling
people how much of the artificial sweetener they
are consuming.
The Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee defeated the labeling amendment on
a 9-7 party-line vote, with Republicans voting
against and Democrats voting for the disclosure
label.
The debate yesterday focused on the labeling
proposal for aspartame, which is sold under the
trade name NutraSweet and which some scien
tists say may be dangerous. Supporters of the
labeling requirement said it would at least allow
consumers to know how much of the substance
they are taking.
"What we're talking about is the right to know
for consumers," said Sen. Edward Kennedy of
Massachusetts, senior Democrat on the commit
tee. "We underestimate the consumer if we think
they are not interested or concerned, particularly
about their children."
CBS' fate undecided
CHICAGO — CBS Inc. kept its corporate eye
wide open yesterday at the network's annual
meeting, held against a background of soaring
stock prices and rumors that broadcasting
maverick Ted Turner was continuing efforts for a
hostile takeover.

The nearly three-hour meeting, comic and
chaotic at times, ended with no indication Turner
was any nearer to acquiring the company than
when the day began.
The "CBS Evening News" reported yesterday
that a Turner lawyer informed the Federal Com-,
munications Commission that Turner's formal
application for approval to take over the network
would be filed today.
Turner, who was in New York, refused com
ment.
Toward the end of the shareholders' meeting,
Wyman was asked whether he felt Turner was
"moral" enough to run CBS.
"I have expressed something less than total en
thusiasm in the past for the thought of him
managing this enterprise," Wyman said.
Former anchorman Walter Cronkite, a direc
tor of CBS, said Tuesday the network had always
given its news division freedom to operate, add
ing, "I see nothing in Ted Turner's record that'
would indicate we could have that kind of inde
pendence."
Turner is not the only suitor for the front
running network.
A conservative group. Fairness in Media,
which is affiliated with Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.),
has urged its supporters to buy CBS stock to end :
a perceived liberal bias in the network's news ;
reporting and "become Dan Rather's boss."
