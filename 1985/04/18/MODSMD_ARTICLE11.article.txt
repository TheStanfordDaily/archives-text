Tax grace called success
SACRAMENTO — The state's 90-day tax
amnesty program brought in $144 million from
delinquent taxpayers who ranged from business
executives to llama breeders to Santa Claus, state
officials said yesterday.
"The program was a resounding success, bring
ing in more than twice the revenue we thought it
would," said Assemblyman Tom Hannigan (D-
Fairfield) , author of the law authorizing the pro
gram.
"Thousands of taxpayers who were fugitives
from the tax system are now part of it, we hope,"
Hannigan said at a Capitol news conference.
Under the amnesty program, taxpayers who
have failed to pay or underpaid the state income
or sales tax could pay their back taxes, plus inter
est, between Dec. 10, 1984, and March 15. They
then avoided substantial penalties and criminal
prosecution.

Missile thief convicted
SAN FRANCISCO — A federal appeals court
yesterday upheld the conviction of a man who
said he broke into Vandenberg Air Force Base to
destroy an MX missile, rejecting his defense that
he had to act to prevent nuclear war.
Defendant Walter Dorrell failed to show either

that he had no legal way to change U.S. nuclear
policy or that he had reason to believe his actions
would stop the MX program, said the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
Dorrell "does have recourse to the political
process to redress his concerns regarding nuclear
war," said the opinion by Judge Joseph Sneed.
He said "impatience" with political protest does
not justify lawbreaking.
Dorrell was arrested by security guards near
the MX building at Vandenberg in December
1983. He had been carrying a sledgehammer and
other tools, as well as a can of spray paint, the
court said. He admitted painting political slogans
on the building.

LINDSAY — Gov. George Deukmejian
disputed charges yesterday by farm labor leader
Cesar Chavez that his administration is not en
forcing state farm labor laws, saying farm
workers have received more than $1 million in
settlements since he took office.
The Republican governor commented at an in
formal news conference following a tour of a
Tulare County agricultural cooperative, the Cali
fornia Citrus Producers plant in Lindsay.
Responding to reporters questions about the
state Agricultural Labor Relations Board

(ALRB), which Chavez says has been prevented
by Deukmejian from enforcing the law, Deuk
mejian said he has tried to restore "fairness" to
both workers and growers to a board which un
der his predecessor, Gov. Jerry Brown, was
biased against growers.
Responding to Chavez' charges, Deukmejian
said the ALRB has settled more farm labor
disputes in two years under his administration
than in the previous seven years under Brown
and that more than $1 million in settlements have
gone to farm workers.
Deukmejian also defended his support of Pres
ident Reagan's proposals to reduce farm sub
sidies as part of the effort to reduce federal
deficits.
Deukmejian said the farmers he has talked to
say the things that will help them most are not
subsidies, but rather lower interest rates and ex
panding export markets by making the American
dollar more competitive — two things that reduc
ing the deficit will help accomplish.
Today's weather

50s. Rain and showers are likely tomorrow; highs
will be in the 50s to mid-60s range.
