## Ott has right chemistry for success 
### GREG CROSSFIELD 
Last September, chemist Derek
Ott presented his paper on polymers
to the American Chemical Society's
Polymers for Fibers and Elastomers
symposium. The paper was presented
without a hitch to a large group of
chemistry professors in attendence.
The one thing that was unusual about
this presentation was that the chemist
was a high school senior.
Now a freshman here, Ott is finish

elementary school teacher, but he at
tributes his chemical interest and suc
cess to self-initiative.
While a sophomore, Ott developed
an interest in science . "The
availability of prizes in the form of
scholarships and cash caused me to
consider doing a science project," he
said. He put together a presentation
on effects of acid rain on plants.
While doing research for his acid

anthropology and biology. He wants
to learn how to analyze the brain
from both the psycological and
chemical perspectives.
Some might say that these are

tered Stanford, Ott was being pub

rain project, Ott came across the idea
of covering statues and other public
monuments with a protective
polymer coating. Further investiga
tion had to wait until the he had won
a few local awards and completed his
sophomore year.
So Ott proceeded to win a bevy of
awards in science at local science fairs
and moved on to national competi
tions, before returning to further his
research.
But then Ott encountered a lack of
expertise among the teachers at his
high school, forcing him to look else
where. Through a high school
teacher, he was introduced to Eck
hard Hellmuth, a chemistry professor
at the Univeristy of Missouri at
Kansas City.
Hellmuth agreed to help Ott get
the necessary background to investi

gate his polymer cover. In the fall of
Ott's junior year, when Ott took his
first high school chemistry class. Hel
lmuth started training Ott on lab in
struments as well as in calculus and
chemistry. While going to high school
classes during week days, Ott would
work in a college lab on afternoons
and weekends.
Ott didn't accomplish his original
objective of producing a polymer
coating, but he did use the skills
learned with Hellmuth to investigate
some other comtemporary issues in
poylmer chemistry.
It was this research that helped him
get invited to present his paper at the
American Chemical Society's confer
ence. "These invitations to present
papers are given only to those scien
tists whose work is considered con
troversial or important enough to be
of interest to a large group of his
peers," said an editor of Inorganic
Chemistry Magazine. "The scientists
invited to present at these sym
posiums are not doing mediocre
work."
Along with having the paper pub
lished in a book of papers presented
at this symposium, Ott was chosen as
a national finalist in the Westing
house Science Talent Search Scholar
ship competition. He was one of the
40 students, out of 1,000 applicants,
chosen go to Washington to compete
for scholorships. "I missed a lot of
school going to different cities to give
talks and compete," he said.
Despite spending most of his last
two years of high school in a lab, Ott
is hardly the stereotypical malad
justed scientist. His dorm members
describe him as a personable guy who
is a lot of fun. Ott's activities include
photography, basketball and sun bat
hing.
So how did this chemistry hot shot
do when he got to Stanford? Well, he
didn't exactly burn up the labs, he
said. "I put too much pressure on
myself to perform in my first chem
class," he said. "Starting with Chem
33 put me at an initial disadvantage
to those familiar with the procedures,
such as sections needed to do well in
chem."
When asked why he did not con
tinue polymer research at Stanford,
Ott said when you spend so much
time researching one subject you end
up knowing "everything about noth
ing."

Freshman Derek Ott was doing research on acid rain when he though of the idea of using a polymer coat to
protect statues and other public monuments. Although his research on the polymer has gotten sidetracked,
the idea has led to a successful career at the age of 19.
