## THE 						STANFORD DAILY Divest now 
### 
Closet diplomacy isn't working to end apart
heid in South Africa. That government's racist
policies must be answered with immediate action,
and that action must begin here and now at Stan
ford.
This means the University must completely
divest of its stocks in all corporations that do
business in or with South Africa, and students
must pressure the University to do so.
Stanford administration officials have main
tained that the University ought to divest of its
holdings only in those companies shown to com
mit "substantial social injury" and then only
"when all other remedies have failed." But U.S.
companies that deal with South Africa give
money to that country's oppressive, racist gov
ernment, bringing substantial social injury to the
vast majority of the population.
And it is unlikely that Stanford will fully divest
without substantial community pressure.
The Black Student Union has taken a step for
ward by organizing a boycott of U.S. companies
linked with South Africa. Still, the boycott, while

bringing pressure to bear on corporations, will
not directly affect the University's policy of "case
by case" divestment. A more visible campaign is
in order, and must be waged by the entire com
munity.
Non-violent individual initiative is the key to
meeting the administration's policy head on,
from letter-writing to non-violent civil dis
obedience. Marches and sit-ins at Columbia and
Rutgers brought national attention to the evils of
apartheid, and UC-Berkeley students were will
ing to be arrested in the name of the cause.
In as far as they remained non-violent, these
efforts command respect. But the isolated inci
dents of violence at Berkeley are contradictory
and counterproductive. A campaign aimed at
putting an end to violence in South Africa cannot
advocate violence at home.
Through creative non-violence, Stanford can
pick up the ball. Apartheid is a social system
based on institutionalized hatred, and it is
condoned by current Stanford policy. It's time for
a change,
