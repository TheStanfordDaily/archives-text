# Blacks must take many paths to end racism
## 
### 
With the onset of unabashed hedonism and
the pursuit of decadent pleasures that tradi
tionally characterize spring quarter at Stan
ford, one would hardly be surprised if the last
weeks of 1984-85 were unmarked by major
controversy. After all, spring is a time to exer
cise the body, not the mind. We can hardly be
blamed if we spend time enjoying our stereos,
automobiles and three-week beach vacations
before we have to divest ourselves of them
once the student aid cuts come through.
But wait! All is not lost! We're saved from
mental lethargy by — a controversy! Jason
Matherly, my esteemed fellow columnist, has
called Clarence Pendleton, chairman of the
U.S. Civil Rights Commission, "one of the
only true leaders in civil rights."
Riiight. Well, I was all set with a retort en
titled, "Ronald Reagan is One of the Only
True Intellectuals in Government," but I
don't think I have enough shovels to hand out
to everyone who reads this column. Math
erly's column left us with an acute shortage.
In any case, R. Richard Banks and Gary
Malone's response debunked Matherly's
claims far better than I could (The Daily,
April 10). My interest in the subject is slightly
more broad. For despite its well-catalogued
drawbacks, Matherly's column does manage
to touch upon an important issue. "Why," he
asks, "are all vocal blacks who desire some
degree of credibility expected to think alike?"
In fact, as Banks and Malone point out, all
blacks — vocal or not — don't think alike;
there is no good evidence to suggest that such
is the case. But the evidence doesn't matter.
Many people — I would go so far as to say a

majority, white and black — do expect blacks
to think alike.
Banks and Malone state, "There is no mold
to which black leaders are expected to con
form." Actually, there is such a mold. Black
leaders are expected to be liberal Democrats.
The Louis Farrakhans of the world aside, that
term aptly describes most prominent black
leaders. Anyone who deviates from that label
is something of a spectacle.
Indeed, such deviation is considered so odd
as to be newsworthy; Newsweek magazine, in
its Feb. 25 issue, ran an article entitled,

"Blacks: A House Divided?" The expectation
is that blacks are united. Any show of dis
agreement in the ranks is considered abnor
mal. I suspect that the Reagan administration
would not tolerate the outrageousness of
Pendleton's statements if he were not such a
novelty. ("Look! Here's one that doesn't
think like the rest of them!") They know
Pendleton is atypical; in a sense they are
playing against the false perception that
blacks are of one heart and one mind by al
most cynically creating an equally false per

ception that Pendleton is any sort of civil
rights leader at all.
The worst consequence of this myth is that
blacks themselves tend to believe, expect and
even demand it. When a black person departs
in public from what is considered the tradi
tional black political outlook, the criticism
levied upon him seems always to carry the
subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle) implica
tion that he is a traitor or a sell-out.
Syndicated columnist Carl Rowan accused
economist Thomas Sowell of "giving aid and
comfort to racists" when Sowell supported
Reagan's economic policies. And in a more
distressing example, Jesse Jackson delegates
at the 1984 Democratic Convention ex
pressed their feeling that Mondale supporters
Coretta Scott King and Andrew Young had
betrayed them, and booed both off the
podium. This is not to say that Rowan and the
Jackson supporters should have refrained
from disagreeing with Sowell and King and
Young. It would hardly make sense to keep
silent when someone black expresses an
opinion for which a white is strongly attacked.
Still, the vehemence of the disagreement, the
self-righteous ourtrage and the implicit
charges of treachery in these reactions to
blacks taking views apart from that of the
majority is disturbing.
In large part this expectation of a monolith
ic black political stance is a legacy of the
'60s, when the current generation of black
leaders rose to prominence and found success
in a movement of relative cohesiveness and
unity (though even then the coherence was by
no means total), and when middle white

America's first popular image of blacks was as
a large, protesting mass. What we often forget
is that the unity of black Americans lies less in
a uniformity of opinion than in the common
experience of racism. There is no black
American who has not suffered the sting of
racism at some time; indeed, from my per
spective, there are probably very few black
Americans who do not encounter some aspect
of racism in each day of their lives.
Blacks are ultimately united in that experi
ence and in opposition to it. How each black
actually deals with that experience is an entirely
different matter. The paths by which we travel
to reach the goal of equality can be, and are,
many. In fact, I would argue that in this day
and age, blacks' interests are best served by
attempting to change American society
through the utilization of numerous paths
rather than one. Pursuit of political power and
protection of social programs cannot suffice.
It is necessary to recognize the benefits of a
whole system approach. That means blacks
need people in law, in medicine, in business,
in education, in high tech, in the arts, in the
Pentagon, in the political mainstream, on the
left and yes, even on the right if there is to be
any hope of attaining some semblance of ra
cial equality in the next several centuries.
Each black person deals with racism and at
tempts to make his place in American society
in his own manner. * V
It is to be expected that many will go about
these tasks in a similar way. It is not to be ex
pected that all will adhere to this norm,
however, nor is to be expected that those who
deviate are to be treated as pariahs.

Pendleton's method is to deny racism's
existence altogether. While I disagree, 1
believe that Pendleton believes his is the best
way, and that he thinks he is helping black
people. Every black American would sin
cerely like to see the state of blacks improve;
it cannot be that any black would deliberately,
knowingly thwart such improvement. Banks
and Malone quite rightly point out that black
opposition to Pendleton is more likely a func
tion of his abrasive manner than of his being a
black antagonistic to the views of the civil
rights mainstream. But Matherly is correct in
contending that the latter is probably an ele
ment of the antipathy to Pendleton, and of the
criticism of others who have strayed from the
beaten path.
The times are changing, however, and there
is some indication that those who follow dif
ferent paths are more willing than in the past
to walk those trails in the open for all to see
and judge. A conservative black think tank
that met with Reagan last January declared
the current leadership's strategy bankrupt be
cause it concentrated on civil rights solutions
to the exclusion of economic ones, and this
appears not to have generated too heated a
retort. Good. The terms of the debate need to
be widened. It is high time that we began to
view the black leadership not as a colony or
ganism, but as a diverse array of able and in
telligent individuals.
Just a little something to think about be
tween three-week beach vacations.
