Is it back scratching?
In the April 11 Daily there was a
glowing report on the chairman of
Saga Corp. Saga is an immense food
service conglomerate which took
over and now runs the Stanford
Hospital cafeteria.
Coincidentally, Saga is now
making a bid to take over Tresidder
food service.
Members of United Stanford
Workers who have to eat Saga food
at the hospital's only cafeteria do not
give Saga a glowing report. Many say
that the food is terrible. Since Saga
came in, the prices have gone up and
the quality has gone down. They say
that compared to Saga, Tresidder's
food almost looks good, and dorm
food looks superb.
USW workers on campus are
appalled that Saga might also take
over the Tresidder cafeteria. We do

not want to see what happened at
the hospital happen on campus. On
behalf of concerned USW members,
USW is filing a formal "Bargaining
Demand" with the Stanford adminis
tration. Under labor law, union
workers have a right to bargain over
food and food prices at a workplace
cafeteria because food and food
service are part of our working con
ditions.
The entire Stanford community, in
fact, has a stake in Tresidder's food
service contract, which is now being
bid on by Saga and other corpora
tions. Unfortunately, we do not have
confidence that Tresidder manage
ment will handle the bids in a man
ner that is objective and responsive
to the community.
First, the director of Tresidder,
Ellie Oppenheim, has direct ties to
Saga. Her husband is a vice
president of Saga. We think that this

is a conflict of interest. Stanford Vice
President William Massy and former
Stanford Trustee Ernie Arbuckle
also have ties to Saga. Dean Morton,
who is on the Stanford Board of
Hospital Directors, also is on Saga's
board of directors. This makes us
wonder if our life at Stanford is
determined by who scratches whose
back, or by considerations of quality.
In the past, Stanford contracts
have gone to Wells Fargo, Dillin
gham Construction and other corpo
rations whose officers were Stanford
trustees. Thus, those who have had
decision-making power at Stanford
have made a profit as a result of
those decisions. We think this is a
conflict of interest and a question
able practice at a non-profit institu
tion.
Second, we are concerned about
the Coffee House. Tresidder man
agement is taking bids from huge

food service corporations that would
take control of the Coffee House
from the students. Tresidder man
agement seems determined to ignore
the community petition to keep the
Coffee House as a student-run
cooperative. Years ago, students had
to fight against Tresidder manage
ment for the right to run their own
coffee house, by setting up a boycott
and a picket line. USW and the
community supported that effort.
The students won and the Coffee
House improved greatly.
We hope that the students will
once again stand up for their rights
to have a say about their coffee
house in their student union. If they
do, the community once again will
support them.

A poem for Playboy
As a poet and an educator-in
training, I feel obliged to express the
opinion that the controversial ap
pearance of Playboy at Stanford
presents a wonderful opportunity for
young women here.
When I consider how my own
education helped make me the
dried-up old prune I am, I wish that
I had had such an opportunity to
show how truly feminine I was; it
would have been so much easier to
show the evidence of my love life
instead of writing poems about it,
that is before 1 became a dessicated
old bluestocking whose only purpose
in life is to pass on the rueful benefit
of my experience to luckier girls.
And in the hope of doing so, 1 have
composed the following in honor of
the event:

Girls, it's our right to make good
Selling pussy in Times Square;
Think how a spread in Playboy could
Aid us in planning our career!
Come on, ladies, don't be wimps,
We're talking Playboy, that's high
class.
Those gents are editors, not pimps;
That's culture, not our naked ass.
Tubman, Dickinson, Kollontai,
Mme. Curie and Sally Ride
Were never so smiled upon by fate:
No one used them to masturbate!
For ours is the kingdom of the free,
Of letters, law and high finance,
Of government, science, industry â€”
Now hold it, smile, and drop your
pants.
