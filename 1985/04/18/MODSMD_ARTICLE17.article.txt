## College Republicans are blatantly racist 
### 
As a white student concerned with attaining
justice and equality for racial and ethnic minorities
in this country, I feel compelled to comment on the
blatantly racist attempt on the part of the College
Republicans at Stanford to denigrate the civil rights
and black liberation movements. Through a rash of
recent newspaper articles and columns, certain

VIEWPOINT

members of College Republicans (Jason Matherly,
most prominently) have attempted to trivialize the
struggle and reverse the progress of blacks in the
United States and South Africa.
This campaign has stepped up the scope of its
civil rights assault with the abrasive, antagonistic
and bigoted fliers and posters announcing a campus
visit by Clarence Pendleton, chairman of the U.S.
Civil Rights Commission. Pendleton's role as a civil
rights leader was summed up eloquently by
R. Richard Banks and Gary Malone in their letter
to the editor (The Daily, April 10), where
Pendleton is shown to be no civil rights leader at all
because he. himself, believes that "discrimination
and racism no longer exist as civil rights issues."
lauding of such a misguided individual
and neir constant attacks on the vast majority of
black activists and leaders, the College Republicans
have crossed over the line of mere party politics
and entered the realm of racial prejudice. By belit
tling the efforts of black leadership in this country
and the voice of the black vote, which voted over
whelmingly Democratic (90 percent for Mondale)
in the 1984 election, the College Republicans have
taken the same viewpoint as when they stated sup
port of Buthelezi, the Zulu puppet of the apartheid
regime, while deriding the life-and-death struggle

of the oppressed black majority of South Africa.
Perhaps this systematic campaign is in response
to what they feel is agitation from black leaders in
both countries, while they desire quiet from such
sectors, in an effort to maintain the status quo. But
it is precisely this status quo that leaders in the civil
rights and black liberation movements wish to
abolish, the status quo that has heaped more than
300 years of brutal oppression on blacks of this na
tion while maintaining a virtual slave state in South
Africa, shackling the 75 percent black population
in the chains of racial separation. The black leader

describes as "status quo civil rights advocates,"

maintains unity despite vastly differing ideologies
and directions for the simple reason that the yoke
of white oppression has forced blacks to consoli
date their struggle.
During the 60s, the black liberation movement
spearheaded the attempts to enact a real change in
the status quo, and, as a result, they were targeted for
the harshest reaction. The attitudes that motivated
the oppressors then surface in the criticisms of indi
viduals such as Matherly today. One needs only to

travel as far as the other side of Highway 101 to see
that equality in employment, education and
housing is only an ideal, one that seems distant in
the face of the harsh reality of the existence of a
majority of this country's blacks. But in spite of
these facts, the College Republicans respond to the
problems of minorities with a barrage of criticism
leveled at those who are striving for justice, while
remaining deafeningly silent regarding suggestions
for improvement of the injustices. Why?
I recognize the grave injustices that exist con
cerning civil rights in this nation and, being white, I
realize that the burden of civil rights leadership
falls squarely on the shoulders of blacks. It may be
difficult for a white U.S. citizen to understand
oppression and racism, it may even border on a
strictly intellectual endeavor, but for many black
U.S. citizens the day-to-day realities present the
undeniably stifling atmosphere of the racist status
quo. It is this tangibility of ugly racial conditions to
black Americans that makes their position at the
forefront of the civil rights issue not only
legitimate, but a necessity.
When white reactionaries, such as Jason Math
erly and the College Republicans, use aberrations
like Clarence Pendleton and Buthelezi to demean
the efforts of the bulk of black leadership, they add
to the vast supply of racial injustice that thrives in
this country, while their attitudes serve as beacons
for those who would like to see a return of the Jim
Crow laws. The College Republicans are implying
that blacks have no legitimate grievances, nor the
competence to understand their own conditions.
But what the College Republicans achieve is a ra
cial contempt that is clear and ominous in its impli
cations.
