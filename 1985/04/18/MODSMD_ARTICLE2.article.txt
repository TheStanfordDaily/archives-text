# Police explain Liu murder
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Editorial staff 
Lt. Tom Reese of the Daly City
Police Department gave his account
last night of the solving of the murder
of U.S. journalist lie pry Liu and the
ties his killers may have to the
Taiwanese government.
Speaking at Branner Hall before
50 listeners, Reese and Detective
John Warren described how their de
partment and the FBI were able to
discover Liu's killers using interviews,
confessions and a fingerprint found
on a bicycle registered in 1971. Liu,
an author who lived in Daly City, was
a vocal critic of the Taiwanese gov
ernment.
After tracing the bike through five
private owners and a bike shop, they
discovered that the fingerprint
belonged to Chen Chi-Li, a
Taiwanese citizen who has ties to the
Bamboo Gang, a Taiwanese organ
ized crime group in the United States,

Reese said.
Chen, also know as the Duck, and
another killer. Wu Tun, have already
been tried in Taiwan and sentenced
to life imprisonment. A third suspect,
Tung Kuei-jSen, fled from Taiwan
and is still at large, according to
Reese.
"We have no warrant for Tung
Kuei-Sen at this time," Reese said.
He explained that the only evidence
he had against Tung was the state
ments of his co-conspirators, and in
California that is not enough
evidence against a suspect.
Those statements are enough,
however, if he is to be charged on a
federal level, according to Reese. "At
this time [the FBI] is not seeking any
warrants. They're still investigating
and waiting for us to take it as far as
wc can â€” which is pretty close right
now," Reese said.
"We still have one outstanding
suspect and some people that were

involved on the fringe," Reese said of
his next step in the case.
Reese also said the killers could use
a defense based on the fact that they
have already been tried and convicted
in another country.
It is still unclear whether the
Taiwanese government was involved
in the killing, Reese said. "The bot
tom line is, 'Who are you going to
believe? 1 " he said.
Taiwan has admitted that Chen was
doing intelligence work for the gov
ernment but denies that it ordered
Liu killed, according to Reese.
"Supposedly at one point prior to
going into training, he and Adm.
Wang (chief of Taiwan's military in
telligence) were talking about the
need to be patriotic," Reese said.
The admiral, who is now standing
trial in Taiwan, told Chen that Liu's
books were hurting Taiwan, Reese
said. "Wang then said, 'Henry Liu
should be taught a lesson,' " Reese
said. The admiral also gave Chen a
picture of Liu and Liu's address,
Reese added.
Wang denies that he meant for Liu
to be killed, and Chen now says he
didn't mean to kill Liu, according to
Reese.
The police have procured a tape in
which Chen gives an account that is
much more damaging to his case than
was his courtroom testimony, Reese
added.
If it is proven that the killing is the
result of a conspiracy, the United
States could consider cutting off de
fensive aid to the island nation, Reese
said.
Reese said, however, that he
doesn't "have any avenues to pursue
that. I look at it as a murder. We're
just preparing our case."
