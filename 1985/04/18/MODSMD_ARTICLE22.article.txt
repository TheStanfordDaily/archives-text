## NCAA proposes harsh penalties 
### 
KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) —
Schools could be forced to give up
football or basketball for two
years and the NCAA enforcement
staff would gain far-reaching
powers under a revolutionary se
ries of get-tough measures ap
proved yesterday by the National
College Athletic Association
Council.
"We're instituting the athletic
equivalent of the death penalty,"
said one observer who spoke on
condition he not be identified.
The proposals were drawn up by
the newly created NCAA Presi
dential Commission and will be
put to a vote of all NCAA schools
at a special convention June 20-21
in New Orleans. If adopted, most
will go into effect at once.
Jack Davis, president of the
NCAA, said in an interview that
he expects the measures to be be
adopted. Each will require a roll
call vote — meaning that every
school's vote will be a matter of
public record.
Bill Hunt, head of the NCAA
enforcement department, said
they are the most extraordinary
steps taken in the war to clean up
college athletics that he has seen
since he joined the association in
1972.
Essentially, the proposals will
divide the NCAA rules into major
and secondary infractions.
Major violations, said Hunt, are

those that show a repeated pattern
of willful wrong-doing and give a
school a clear competitive advan
tage. Secondary violations will be
defined as things that are isolated
or technical in nature and provide
a limited advantage.
In the past, secondary type vio
lations have usually resulted in a
private reprimand or a public
probation without sanctions, said
Hunt. But if approved in June,
these sort of infractions could
result in the permament in
eligibility of athletes; forfeiture of
games; prohibition of the head
coach or other staff members from
off-campus recruiting for one
year; a 20 percent reduction in the
number of scholarships the school
can offer in the affected sport, and
a fine ranging from $500 to
$5,000.
All penalties for secondary vio
lations would be at the discretion
of the assistant executive director
for enforcement, which since 1978
has been Hunt. Any decision by
Hunt could be appealed to the
NCAA Infractions Committee,
which in the past has decided
punishment in all cases.
The minimum penalty for major
violations would include all of the
following:
• A two-year probationary period.

regular-season match of his career last night at Maples Pavilion.
• The elimination of all expense-paid
recruiting visits to the school for one
year.
• Requiring all coaching staff mem
bers in the affected sport to forego
off-campus recruiting for one year.
• Requiring that all staff members
who knowingly engage in or condone
major violations be subject either to
termination or suspension without
pay for at least one year, or to be
reassigned within the university to a
position that does not bring them into
contact with student-athletes for at
least one year.
• One year of sanctions against
postseason competition and televi
sion appearances.
The so-called "gas chamber"
penalties will come into play, said
Davis, for "repeat violators" — when
any major violation is found within a
five-year period following the starting

date of a major penalty. The mini
mum penalties for repeat major
violators would be:
• Prohibiting some or all "outside"
competition in the sport involved in
the latest major violation for one or
two seasons and the prohibition of all
coaching staff members in that sport
from any coaching activity for two
years. An NCAA staff member said
"outside" competition would include
all competition above the intramural
level. "They would not even be able
to schedule NAIA schools," he said.
• Prohibiting the school from giving
out any scholarships and prohibiting
the coaching staff from any recruiting
activity for two years.
• Requiring that the school's staff
members resign any position on any
NCAA committee, including the
Council or the Presidential Commis
sion;
• Forcing the school to relinquish its
voting privileges in the NCAA for
four years.
