# Spikers must wait after win

### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
There was a disturbing sight in
Maples Pavilion last night. After the
Cardinal men's volleyball team
trounced Long Beach State — and in
the process did all it could to clinch a
very elusive NCAA playoff bid —
there were no overflowing bottles of
champagne, no cheek-to-cheek grins
and only a few half-hearted high
fives.
"It would be nice to be going
crazy," Co-coach Don Shaw said,
"but we can't. We know our fate is in
another team's hands. And that's not
a good feeling."
After Stanford's 15-9, 15-7, 15-7
breeze, the Cardinal players seemed
to look at one another, wondering if it
was all right to go "crazy." They
knew it wasn't all right now, not just
yet. Something other than celebra
tion, something far away, something
in Hawaii was on their minds.
With the Cakewalk, Stanford
closed out league play with a 10-8
mark. For the historians, no Cardinal
mr>/s team had ever won more
league games than it lost before.
But again, it was no time to
celebrate. While all of Stanford's
scheduled league games are com
pleted, the current season is, oddly,
anything but over. The Cardinal
closed to within a game of fourth
place UC-Santa Barbara, 10-6, and
extended its lead over sixth-place
Hawaii, 8-8, to a full game.
The men surely want to play more,
specifically down in Northridge later
this month in the NCAA playoffs.
Whether the team can buy tickets for

the trip south depends entirely on the
outcome of the UC-Santa Barbara-
Hawaii two-game series in Honolulu.
If the Rainbows sweep the twinbill,
three teams — Stanford, Santa Bar
bara and Hawaii — will end tied at
10-8. Only two of the three schools
can be awarded postseason berths.
And the word is that Stanford, un
der the tie-breaking procedures,
would be the odd team out. The three
10-8 teams' records against schools
already in the playoffs will be the de
ciding criterion. Stanford does not
have a win to its name against
playoff-bound Pepperdine, UCLA or
USC. Hawaii, meanwhile, beat USC,
and Santa Barbara downed UCLA.
The verdict on Stanford's season
will be levied by the Gauchos' play in
Hawaii. That makes Shaw, a graduate
of Santa Barbara, uneasy. "All teams
would like to determine their own
fate. We're kind of holding our
breath," he said. In discussing the
Hawaii-Santa Barbara match-up,
Shaw indicated that a "betting man"
wouldn't bet on a Hawaii sweep. He
was quick to note that anything could
happen, however.
Although Santa Barbara is playing
well, "the time difference and the en
vironment make it tough to play over
there. It's difficult to think only vol
leyball in Hawaii," Shaw said.
While last night's Stanford victory
may have left the team hanging, the
Cardinal showed it could deal with
the task at hand.
"We were able to dictate the ac
tion," Shaw said. "Even when they

scored points, it was more a result of
our mistakes and not their good
play."
Long Beach Coach Ken Preston,
whose team dropped to 2-15, was
beleaguered. "Oh, God, I'm so happy

there's only one more game left. I'm
embarrassed. If you've seen some of
our matches, you'd know why I'm so
embarrassed," he said.
Preston's 49ers had made the
playoffs four of the last five years and
finished fifth nationally last year.
"I didn't think we played badly for
us, you just have to know how we've
been playing lately," Preston said.

"We've been atrocious. This was as
good an effort as we've had in a
match in a month.
"This wasn't a very good match for
Stanford either — they were hitting
balls out. I suspect that they were just
going through the motions. I've seen
them play better, and if they get back
to the way they can play, then they'll
be a real factor in the playoffs."
