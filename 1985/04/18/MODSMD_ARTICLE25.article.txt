## Irvine no problem for Card 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
Whether or not the Stanford men's tennis team is
ready to play USC and UCLA for the second time
around this weekend, the Cardinal had little diffi
culty defeating UC-Irvine yesterday 8-1.
Stanford, 20-1 in dual match competition and 5-
1 in the Southern Division of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, will play USC tomorrow and UCLA Saturday
in Los Angeles. The outcome of those matches will
be important in determining NCAA Championship
seedings.
The match against Irvine was "good prepara
tion" for this weekend's competition, according to
Coach L;ck Gould. He is especially concerned
about doubles — against both UCLA and USC,
Stanford lost two of three doubles matches.
Stanford won all of the singles matches against

Irvine except at the No. 6 spot, where Neil Amor
defeated Stanford's Scott Moody 2-6, 6-1, 7-6.
"After the first set I let up and never got back in
the match," Moody said. "I was playing well, but
he just beat me. My serve wasn't all that great, and
his return of serve was really on."
Moody said his straight-set doubles victory with
partner John Letts was a much better match for
him.
"John and I have been playing really really well
lately. We're playing together," he said. Moody
plans to play as well when it counts — this
weekend.
For Irvine, the match against Stanford followed a
7-2 loss to California Tuesday that ended the
Anteaters' hopes for reaching the NCAA playoffs
in May.
"Now we have to concentrate only on winning

our league (the Pacific Coast Athletic Association)
like we have been able to do the past two years,"
Irvine Coach Greg Patton said. "We hoped wc
could beat Cal yesterday, but our intensity just
wasn't up.
"We gave (JSC a good scare earlier this season.
We were up 4-2 at the end of singles and lost 5-4,"
Patton said. "It was one of those beautiful days.
USC always gets us fired up. There are 'SC bumper
stickers all over Orange County, and our guys get
sick of seeing them."
Yesterday, Stanford players suppressed most of
his players' "emotional intensity," according to
Patton.
Dan Goldie defeated Irvine's top player Bruce
Man Son Hing 6-2, 6-4. "Bruce played really well,
but Goldie, he was a stud — especially from the
baseline," Patton said.
