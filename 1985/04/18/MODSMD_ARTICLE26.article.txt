## Savides: cooler temper, hotter tennis 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
I he sun was setting and the winds picking up at USC's
Marks Tennis Stadium March 27 when Stephanie Savides
stepped on Court No. 3 for her No. 6 singles match.
. Savides quickly won the first set 6-2, lost the second 6-
1, and then lost the third —rand the match — in a tie
breaker. Savides shook hands with USC's Dena Levy,
picked up her sweats and rackets, and stormed off the
court into the locker room.
Twenty minutes later, a distraught Savides returned,
this time to Court No. 4, where she and partner Kay Tittle
would play No. 3 doubles. In a little over an hour, Savides
and Tittle lost 6-3, 6-4.
Savides loss in singles gave the Trojans a 4-2 lead, and
the loss in doubles clinched their 5-4 victory. For Savides
and the two other sophomores on the Stanford team, the
loss broke a 40-match winning streak and was the first in
their collegiate careers.
," After I lost that match, I thought that was the ultimate
low, Savides says in retrospect. "I thought I was out of
there (the lineup). I thought I was gone. I thought my
season was over."
It wasn't, at least not the next day when Stanford played
at UCLA. Savides played, and Cardinal Coach Frank
Brenrtan even moved her up a notch to No. 5. "When I
saw I was in the lineup I realized I had to play well,"
Savides says.
She did, blasting Maria LaFranchie in straight sets 6-1,
6-1. The following day at Long Beach State, she won
again.
But the comeback wasn't complete until last weekend,
when Stanford traveled to Austin, Texas, and won the
prestigous Longhorn-Kaepa Tennis Classic.
Eight of the nation's top 10 teams were there. Two of
Stanford's top eight netters — freshmen Anna Ivan and
Qari Hagey — weren't. A third — senior captian Linda
Gates — had tendinitis in her knee that limited her to
playing only doubles.
With Gates, who was playing No. 1 singles, and Ivan,
who was playing No. 3, out of the singles lineup, Savides
was forced to play No. 3. Never mind that she had been
having her troubles at five and six.
Stanford, ranked No. 2 at the time, drew fifth-ranked
Miami in the tournament's first round Friday. And at No.
3 singles, Savides drew Ros Riach, a South African who
was ranked 19th nationally and had played the women's
professional tour as an amateur last summer.
"Against Miami, it was the first time I thought my
match was important and meant a lot to the team,"
Savides says. "Because we were so talented last year, I al
ways thought my match wasn't very important, that we'd
win no matter what I did."
( Savides rose to the occasion.
• She took Riach to a tiebreaker in the first set — then

won it 7-5. The second set was no problem — she won it
going away, 6-1. When it was over, Brennan called it"the
best match of her collegiate career."
"It was probably the best match I've played mentally,"
Savides admits. "Strokewise, 1 didn't do anything spe
cial."
What it did do was give Savides confidence. Dearly
needed confidence. Savides finished the three-day tourna
ment with a 5-1 record, 2-1 in singles and 3-0 in doubles
with Tittle.
Savides will be the first to tell you that she is an up-and
down player, and she has had an up-and-down career be
cause of it. Lately, however, there have been more downs
than ups.
Take away the early part of this season and the tourna
ment in Texas, and Savides' two-year career at Stanford
has been less than spectacular. She played No. 6 singles

most of last year, but Brennan dropped her from the
lineup at the NCAAs.
Before college, Savides, who grew up in Los Altos Hills
and graduated from Gunn High School, was the princess
of Northern California tennis. She won the California
State Open Championship in 1982 and was ranked as high
as 18th nationally in the under-18s. In doubles, Savides
paired with her older sister, Stacy, who now plays across
the Bay at California, to make up a nationally ranked
doubles team.
"1 think she started to slide a little bit towards the end
of her junior career," Brennan says. "When you're one
those wonder kids, you tend to do that. She started so fast
and continued to progress, but everyone just hit their
spurts a little later and caught up with her. She started to
lose face in her own neighborhood, and I think that was a
little shocking to her.

"Stephanie is panning out now. Very frankly, she had a
disappointing season last year. 1 know she's better than
that, she knows she's better than that, and now she's
proving it."
Savides' comeback has little to do with any change in
the technical side of her game — her strokes were already
polished when she arrived at Stanford. Rather, it has to
with a change upstairs.
You see, when they were handing out anger, the 5-foot
-3 Savides got an extra dose. Or doses. It's hard to imagine
how such an easy-going person off the court could ex
plode into fits of anger on it, but she did acquire a reputa
tion in the junior ranks as having a short fuse.
Although she has never broken a racket, Savides has
thrown her share. She tossed one into a pool when she was
16 and sent one sailing off a cliff a few years ago at a
tournament in West Virginia.
"I think my problem has been never being able to han
dle losing," she says."I haven't been able to allow myself
to lose every now and then. I'm a perfectionist."
Her problem became an even bigger one the summer
before she maticulated here. After losing the Northern
California 18's Championship to current teammate Ivan,
Savides was holding her racket by the handle and angrily
swinging it back and forth. It inadvertently — emphasis on
inadvertently — flew out of her hand and hit the chair
umpire in the arm.
"That really shocked me," she says."It really made me
stop and think."
Since then, she has made a concerted effort to control
her tantrums, and this season they have virtually vanished.
"As bad as she played last year, emotionally she was
worse," Brennan says. "Once the veins started popping
out in her neck, it was all over and she would lose. But this
year, she's maintained and it's improved her game 100
percent."
While Savides probably played the best tennis of her
collegiate career last weekend, she didn't win the tourna
ment championship by herself. She had some help from
her two sophomore teammates.
Savides, Leigh Anne Eldredge and Patty Fendick make
up what Brennan calls his best recruiting class in his six
years at Stanford. Fendick is ranked fifth nationally, but
could very well move to No. 1 after beating top-ranked
Beverly Bowes of Texas in straight sets Saturday.
Eldredge is 17-4 in singles this season and is ranked 11th.
"I was thrilled to get them," Brennan says."I was espe
cially impressed with that class because I got both great
singles and doubles players."
Ironically, he also got three women who literally hated
each other, particually when it came to Savides and
Eldredge. In the junior ranks, there is a bitter rivalry be
tween Northern and Southern California, and since

Coach Frank Brennan says that Stephanie Savides has "improved her game 100 percent" since controlling
the outbursts that had hurt her play last year. Savides has come on to play the best tennis of her collegiate
career, Brennan says.
Savides was the queen of the north
and Eldredge, from Altadena, the
queen of the south, the two were ad
versaries "by nature," according to
Brennan.
"I wanted to go to Stanford, but I
didn't want her to come here,"
Savides says of Eldredge. "And 1
think she felt the same way."
Evidently Eldredge did, but not
enough to sway her from Stanford to
UCLA, where Brennan was told she
would go. "It was particularly a prob
lem recruiting Leigh Anne," Brennan
says. "There was no love lost between
the two of the them and Stephanie
was already signed, sealed and
delivered.
"It was so awkward at first that I
wouldn't put them together in
practice. But after a while they
became better friends. They're not
best friends now by any means, but
they like each other very much."
Regardless, Stanford is 47-1 and
has an NCAA title to boot with
Savides, Eldredge and Fendick. And
three share the distinction of having
the opportunity to win four NCAA
crowns in their stay at Stanford.
Nonetheless, Savides says that al
though pro tennis may be on her
horizon, she isn't banking —or even
planning — on it.
"I wouldn't mind playing (pro) ten
nis a year or two, but I plan on going
to law school or business school," she
says."I don't think I could play tennis
all my life. I don't think I'd be good
enough. I've never thought of tennis
as a career."
As far as this season is concerned,
however, Savides says she still has
some unfinished business. There's
playing in the NCAA team cham
pionships, something Savides missed
out on last season. And, of course,
there's winning a singles match
against USC.
Savides will get her chance Satur
day when Stanford hosts USC. "I
want to win this weekend," she said.
And this time, it might be easier
done than said.
