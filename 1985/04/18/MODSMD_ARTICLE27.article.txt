## Women netters take on Arizona 
### 
With last Saturday's victory
over No. 1-ranked USC behind it,
the Stanford women's tennis team
will now try not to look ahead to
the Trojans — and past today's
opponent, the I2th-ranked
Arizona Wildcats.
Stanford will play USC Satur
day for the third time this season
in the second of iwo WCAA
matches with the Trojans. But
today, the Cardinal gets Arizona,
a team it defeated 6-3 in Tucson
last month.
Many schedules have the match
listed for tomorrow at 1:30 p.m.,
but it will be played today at the

same time.
The Wildcats are led by Jill
Smoeller, the lOth-ranked singles
player in the nation. At No. 1
singles, Smoeller will probably
play Patty Fendick, ranked fifth,
but on her way up after straight
set victories over the nation's No.
1- and No. 6-ranked players at the
Longhorn-Kaepa Tennis Classic
last weekend.
Stanford won the eight-team
tournament, despite playing
singles without senior Linda
Gates, who had tendinitis in her
knee, and freshman Anna Ivan,
who came down with a bad virus.
