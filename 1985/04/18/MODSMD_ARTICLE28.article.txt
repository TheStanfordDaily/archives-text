# Ends WCAA play with loss to Aztecs
## Card 0-12 in WCAA 
### DAVE DUTCHER Senior sportswriter 
Getting close usually counts only
with horseshoes and hand grenades,
so the Stanford softball team finished
its first Western Collegiate Athletic
Association season winless.
The Cardinal, 10-40, lost its 11th
and 12th WCAA games to San Diego
State yesterday at Roble Field. Stan
ford was held to two hits in its 1-0
first-game loss by winner Lori
Thompson.
The Cardinal lost the second game
3-2 in eight innings, despite getting a
potential winning run to third base in
the extra inning.
Yesterday's losses, not surprisingly,
were the closest Stanford came to
winning a WCAA game.
"It just gets so frustrating you don't
even want to think about it
anymore," Cardinal Coach Kathy
Lincoln said. "The kids are
frustrated, too. They play hard and
they play well. We can't buy a break
now. Everything that can go wrong
will. We have to search for positives,
but it's getting harder and harder to
do that."
Stanford hardly had a chance to

think about the bygone WCAA
season or about is final games at
Roble. About fuur hours after its
double-header, the Cardinal boarded
vans and headed to Reno, Nev., for
the Reno Invitational.
Stanford's first game, against
Portland State, begins today at noon
and will be followed by games against
host Nevada-Reno at 2 p.m. and
Hayward State at 4 p.m.
The Cardinal will play Oregon and
St. Mary's tomorrow. After seedings
are determined based on today's and
tomorrow's games, a single
elimination tournament will be held
Saturday to determine the winner.
Thompson scored the Aztecs' first
game run in the fifth inning after
leading off with a single off loser
Betsy Watson, 5-22. Thompson went
to third on a sacrifice and a single.
With two out, she scored on cleanup
hitter Shannon Mason's single.
San Diego State, 4-2 in the
WCAA, had eight hits in the first
game, all singles. Stanford's singles
were by Laura Buchanan in the first
and K.K. Bush in the sixth.
The Aztecs scored first in the

second game, in the second inning
with the help of two Cardinal errors.
Stanford, though, took a 2-1 lead in
the fourth when Lisa Buchanan, the
eventual losing pitcher, got on via
fielder's choice. After singles by
Monique Bautista and Maria De La
Rosa, Anna Sanchez, who came into
the double-header hitting .096, sin
gled in Buchanan and Bautista.
However, Stanford was stifled by
winner Lisa Michie from the fourth
inning on.
With the score tied after the
regulation seven innings, the
tional tiebreaker the WCA A employs
went into effect. A team begins an exr
tra inning by putting on second bass
the player who batted last in the pre
vious inning. In the top of the eighth,
Bautista was sacrificed from second
to third by Sanchez. With two out,
Bush grounded out to end the inning.
The Aztecs, though, got their run
ner home with only one batter,.
Michie attempted to bunt Priscillp
Montgomery to third, and the Card"-
inal tried unsuccessfully to throwh
Montgomery out. Michie was throwh
out at second, but Montgomery
scored in the process.
