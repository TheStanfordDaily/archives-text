The Stanford women golfers chal
lenged powerful Tulsa from the first
hole to the last this week at the Lady
Sun Devil in Phoenix, Ariz., indica
ting to the rest of the collegiate golf
world that they are ready to compete
with the best at next month's NCAAs
in Cape Cod, Mass.
The Cardinal, who earlier in the
season had suffered through the
growing pains which often accom
pany an inexperienced team, finished
just three shots back of Tulsa yester
day. Stanford finished at 902 for the
three-day tournament.
"I'm pretty psyched," said sopho
more Kathleen McCarthy, who
picked up a second-place trophy in
the individual competition, shooting
220 for the three rounds. "It's good
to finish this close to Tulsa and give

them a run for the money."
McCarthy said that the Cardinal
women should be in pretty solid posi
tion to gain an NCAA tournament
berth. "I think that we have a very
good chance," she said. "We brought
it together when we had to. We had
to shoot for low numbers, and we
did."
McCarthy finished three shots be
hind Tulsa's All-American Jody
Rosenthal for the individual title in
Phoenix. Other Stanford scores in
cluded freshman Anna Oxenstierna
at 223, freshman Kay Cornelius at
228, junior Kathy Kostas at 232 and
freshman Trish McGonigle at 238.
The Cardinal women next compete
in the WCAA Championships at
Phoenix next Wednesday through
Friday. Included in the eight teams
there will be Arizona State, UCLA
and USC.
