Sophomores Mathew Nosanchuk and Hillary Kircher are Stanford's
winners of this year's Truman Scholarships.
Marshall could not give exact fig
ures but said that "no school in the
country has done better. We get our
two students selected year after year.
We're way, way ahead of the pack."
Kircher, from Shawnee Mission.
Kan., won the scholarship for her in
terest in the economic development
of Latin America. She said ner inter
est in Latin America probably set her
aoart from some of the other candi
dates. many of whom are more inter
ested in political careers.
Marshall said she impressed Stan
ford's selection committee because of
her interest in both industrial engi
neering and Spanish. He said he
could "see her heading some kind of
project that would help the economic
development of Latin America."
Nosanchuk, from Birmingham,
Mich., was cited for his interest in
public service. Nosanchuk, who wrote
an essay about arms control as part of

the selection process, has worked on
the staff of Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.)
and said that, though he is undeclared
now, he plans to major in history and
will probably go to law school.
"We were impressed by his com
mitment to public service," Marshall
said of Nosanchuk. "I can see him
working on the staff of a member of
Congress someday, and, in the long
run, running for public office."
About 800 schools submitted two
nominees each for the scholarship.
One student from each state, as well
as 50 at-large students, won the
award.
