The Bongos — Beat Hotel
★ ★ ★ Vi
"Beat Hotel" will no doubt dis
appoint Bongos fans who were
hoping for a repeat of their master
ful "Drums Along the Hudson" or
more of the acoustic pop of the
"Numbers with Wings" EP. The
facade of stock pop sounds occa
sionally obscures the band's real
talent for creating fun, quirky
three-minute songs, and this makes
it more difficult for the listener to
determine if the Bongos' sound is
still intact. Fortunately, it is, but
finding it takes some time because
the album's producer has hidden
the drums and hollow-sounding
guitars which made their last LP so
good and added a great deal of au
ral filler. However, the lyrics have
survived these changes intact, and
the careful wording of the best
songs makes the big pop sounds
much easier to swallow. Songs such
as "A Story (Written in the Sky)"
and "Splinters" manage to combine
lyrics and musical hooks well
enough to make the album worth
having, but the overall effort is an
noying because the Bongos can do
much better.

KZSU will air the most promising tracks from these albums tonight at 6
The rating scale is from one to five stars.

Tubes —Love Bomb it it it it
It's hard to imagine a Tubes al
bum being predictable. The band is
responsible for such bizarre behav
ior both in concert and in tiny little
grooves like these that aberration is
expected — even though the
group's later work has tended to be
more AOR mainstream than crazy.
Side one provides several regular
old guitar-vocal-drum-keyboard
bass songs that should be playable
enough on rock stations and video
shows. Side two is crazy. The nine
or so sections all segue into one —
ahem — artistic whole, varying

from McCartney-ish slick-pop-soul
to dubrap to a rather astonishing
fusion of "Wooly Bully" and
"Theme From a Summer Place."
You have to hear it to believe it, so
tune in to the show for once. The
regular songs are well-arranged and
well-performed, the off-the-wall
songs are clever and entertaining. If
only lead singer Fee Waybill's voice
weren't so raspy and Joe-rocker,
the Tubes could rise above their
obscure, stereotyped reputation
and enjoy some success. After all
their effort on "Love Bomb," they
deserve it.

Alison Moyet — Alf ★ ★ ★
Considering the strangeness that
went on with Yaz's two albums, this
solo from lead vocalist Alison
Moyet is unexpectedly normal.
Conventional pop melodies, con
ventional pop instrumentation,
conventional pop lyrics and vocals
combine to form — you guessed it
— uninventive, unexciting KYUU
music to drive home by. It's hard to
imagine anyone listening to this al
bum on purpose; Moyet has slipped
from avant-garde all the way to
adult-contemporary in the space of
two years. This effort is decidedly
unexperimental, giving Yaz fans al
most no new synthesizer arrange
ments, unique song concepts or cre
ative vocal applications to listen
for. Moyet has an excellent voice,
and it proves very compatible with
new-wave-pop instrumentation.
But since everyone already knew
that by Yaz's first album, there is
simply no reason for her to continu
ally reaffirm her skill without any
artistic expansion. The music may
be nice to listen to, but it's nowhere
near as interesting as before.
