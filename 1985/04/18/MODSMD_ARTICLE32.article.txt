# The 						Beat Farmers offer a unique blend of music

### GEOFF SANBORN Editorial staff 
If all you've heard are the singles
— "California Kid" and "Happy
Boy" — off the Beat Farmers' debut
album "Tales of the New West,"
you've probably got the Farmers
pegged as a tongue-in-cheek novelty
band that plays bad-ass, deep-voiced
rockabilly. Well, peg again.
Actually, don't bother pegging at
all. You could label the Farmers
forever and still never completely en
compass the music of these four San
Diegans who have been bouncing
from bar band to bar band since the
mid-60s. On "Tales of the New
West," the Farmers have essentially
taken all of the American guitar
songs they have heard or played in
their careers, put them in a blender
and poured out 12 tunes that reflect
the influence of every one of their
musical heroes.
That makes for some dream com
binations. What would it sound like if
Lou Reed played with the Byrds?
Listen to the Farmers' "There She
Goes Again" (it sounds like John
Cougar, only 10 times better.) How
about if ZZ Top and Los Lobos got
together to cover a Bruce Springsteen
tune? Check out "Reason to
Believe." And what the hell are
Randy Newman and the Grateful
Dead doing together on "Showbiz?"
You've got to hear it to appreciate it.
By the way, don't try to imagine
the voice you hear on "California
Kid" and "Happy Boy" singing the
above songs. Every other song
besides those two on the album is
sung by other, more tenor-oriented
members of the band. With the ex
ception of bassist Rollie Dexter,
everyone in the band — "Country"

Dick Montana, Jerry Raney and
Buddy Blue — sings lead vocals and
plays both guitar and drums. These
strings, sticks and alternating vocals
are the heart of the Farmers' sound
— the only additional instruments
they use are harmonicas, an oc
casional accordion and one guest sax
solo.
If you're violently opposed to
country music, then you won't like
every song on this album. "Lost
Weekend" and "Goldmine" lean
strongly toward the country side of
rockabilly, "Where Do They Go" is a

conventional four-chord acoustic bal
lad and "Lonesome Hound" is an
electric Johnny Cash-style country
pounder. But if you've got an open
mind, every one of these country
oriented songs, except maybe "Lost
Weekend," will start to grow on you.
If you want to hear this band live
before you get the album — and you
should get the album — the Farmers
will be playing at the Betanooner in
front of the Beta Theta Pi house to
morrow afternoon. Admission is free,
but bring your Stanford ID.
