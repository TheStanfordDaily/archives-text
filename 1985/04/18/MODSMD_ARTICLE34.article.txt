## Cher can't 'Mask' shrewd manipulation 
### STEVE VINEBERG Editorial staff 
"Mask," written by Anna Hamil
ton Phelan and directed by Peter
Bogdanovich, tells the true-life story
of Rocky Dennis, a Southern Califor
nia boy with a rare condition known
popularly as "lionitis" and consisting
of gross facial distortions (amounting
to an expansion of areas of the face)
and deposits of calcium in the skull.
Expected to die in infancy, or to end
up blind, dead or retarded, Rocky
managed to survive until the age of
16, an exceptionally bright kid whose
mother. Rusty — a woman with no
use for convention, attached to a
motorcycle gang, raising Rocky in her
own style without the assistance of his
long-absent father — fought to keep
him mainstreamed, enrolled in public
schools and fully conversant with the

tough ways of the world. The film
covers roughly the last year of
Rocky's life: his transition to a new
school, his conflict with his mother
over her dependence on drugs, his
first romance. It's a triumph-over
adversity story, an inspirational
movie in which the young hero,
taught by his mother to "make him
self well" — she practices a kind of
holistic medicine to keep Rocky
healthy and nurse away the horren
dous headaches that sometimes dis
turb his sleep — illustrates over and
over again the power of positive
thinking.
Peter Bogdanovich-hasn't had a hit
movie in more than a decade, and he
and Anna Hamilton Phelan take no
chances on this one. Nothing in the
picture happens casually; everything
is carefully rigged to emphasize the

theme, which is the same as that of
most fairy tales: Appearances
deceive. Rocky (Eric Stoltz) isn't just
a physically deformed teenager with
normal impulses; he's super-normal
— a straight-A student, a Dodgers
freak with an impressive baseball
card collection, witty, personable,
sensitive, gregarious. As resplendent
on the inside as he is unsightly on the
outside, he's the Beast in the Perrault
fable, and Rusty, who appreciates her
son's inner worth and cultivates it, is
Beauty. As played by Cher, in the
first film role that has allowed her to
look truly glamorous — Rita
Hayworth-like, with a thick head of
lustrous red hair — Rusty is the
physical personification of Rocky's
heart and soul, and she looks espe
cially luminous in their scenes to
gether. Rusty's lifestyle (she spends
much of her time high on various
drugs and chooses unceremoniously
from among several lovers) does not
prevent her from providing Rocky
with all the emotional security he re
quires — as well as financial security,
though the movie doesn't elucidate
how she supports the two of them.
Moreover, the bikers (who call them
selves "the Turks") are as concerned
and sturdy a support system as any
teenager could ask for. When he
graduates at the head of his junior
high school class, they show up to
cheer his achievements; he leans over
to the principal (Ben Piazza) and in
forms him with a proud smile, "That's
my family."
Phelan and Bogdijnovich have
filled the movie with emblematic
scenes that any teen reader of S.E.
Hinton could decipher on cue. Rocky
regales his class with a summary (in
adolescent hip style) of the causes of
the Trojan War, with a special em
phasis on Helen's beauty; an old
lover of Rocky's, Gar (Sam Elliott),

takes Rocky to the carnival, where he
encounters a handsome reflection of
himself in the Hall of Mirrors; Rocky
works as a counselor's aide at a camp
for the blind, where he falls in love;
etc., etc. It's a shamelessly
manipulative movie — the kind of
movie 1 usually despise. Yet some of
it works, and 1 don't just mean it
works you over, because it is made by
skilled hands or because its subject
matter has so much built-in sentimen
tal force — though all of this can cer
tainly be said of "Mask." Peter Bog
danovich is not only shrewd; he's
gifted, too, and so the movie, which
under the control of another director
(James Brooks, who made "Terms of
Endearment," for instance) would be
easy enough to dismiss as a tear
jerker, is a more complicated
proposition. To be truthful, though I
knew what to make of "Mask," I was
at a loss about how to respond to it,
because though the movie is blatantly
a set-up, and some scenes display a
sensibility as atrocious as any in
recent movies — like one in which a
biker (Dennis Burkley), mute since
the outset of the picture, stutters out,
"I'm very proud of you. Rocky,"
after the boy's graduation — other
scenes, including the Hall of Mirrors
incident, somehow manage to tran
scend themselves and make an emo
tional impression. The movie upset
me for hours, and I woke up the next
morning with bits of it still swimming
around in my head. As a friend of
mine commented (paraphrasing a line
in the film), "Mask" does some of the
right things, though admittedly for
the wrong reasons.
The emotional authenticity of sec
tions of the movie derives, at least in
part, from the rapport between Cher
and young Eric Stoltz, who really


Peter Bogdanovich is the director of "Mask," his first feature effort in
nearly four years.
