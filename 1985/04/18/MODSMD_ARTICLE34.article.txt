## Cher can't 'Mask' shrewd manipulation 
### STEVE VINEBERG Editorial staff 
"Mask," written by Anna Hamil
ton Phelan and directed by Peter
Bogdanovich, tells the true-life story
of Rocky Dennis, a Southern Califor
nia boy with a rare condition known
popularly as "lionitis" and consisting
of gross facial distortions (amounting
to an expansion of areas of the face)
and deposits of calcium in the skull.
Expected to die in infancy, or to end
up blind, dead or retarded, Rocky
managed to survive until the age of
16, an exceptionally bright kid whose
mother. Rusty — a woman with no
use for convention, attached to a
motorcycle gang, raising Rocky in her
own style without the assistance of his
long-absent father — fought to keep
him mainstreamed, enrolled in public
schools and fully conversant with the

tough ways of the world. The film
covers roughly the last year of
Rocky's life: his transition to a new
school, his conflict with his mother
over her dependence on drugs, his
first romance. It's a triumph-over
adversity story, an inspirational
movie in which the young hero,
taught by his mother to "make him
self well" — she practices a kind of
holistic medicine to keep Rocky
healthy and nurse away the horren
dous headaches that sometimes dis
turb his sleep — illustrates over and
over again the power of positive
thinking.
Peter Bogdanovich-hasn't had a hit
movie in more than a decade, and he
and Anna Hamilton Phelan take no
chances on this one. Nothing in the
picture happens casually; everything
is carefully rigged to emphasize the

theme, which is the same as that of
most fairy tales: Appearances
deceive. Rocky (Eric Stoltz) isn't just
a physically deformed teenager with
normal impulses; he's super-normal
— a straight-A student, a Dodgers
freak with an impressive baseball
card collection, witty, personable,
sensitive, gregarious. As resplendent
on the inside as he is unsightly on the
outside, he's the Beast in the Perrault
fable, and Rusty, who appreciates her
son's inner worth and cultivates it, is
Beauty. As played by Cher, in the
first film role that has allowed her to
look truly glamorous — Rita
Hayworth-like, with a thick head of
lustrous red hair — Rusty is the
physical personification of Rocky's
heart and soul, and she looks espe
cially luminous in their scenes to
gether. Rusty's lifestyle (she spends
much of her time high on various
drugs and chooses unceremoniously
from among several lovers) does not
prevent her from providing Rocky
with all the emotional security he re
quires — as well as financial security,
though the movie doesn't elucidate
how she supports the two of them.
Moreover, the bikers (who call them
selves "the Turks") are as concerned
and sturdy a support system as any
teenager could ask for. When he
graduates at the head of his junior
high school class, they show up to
cheer his achievements; he leans over
to the principal (Ben Piazza) and in
forms him with a proud smile, "That's
my family."
Phelan and Bogdijnovich have
filled the movie with emblematic
scenes that any teen reader of S.E.
Hinton could decipher on cue. Rocky
regales his class with a summary (in
adolescent hip style) of the causes of
the Trojan War, with a special em
phasis on Helen's beauty; an old
lover of Rocky's, Gar (Sam Elliott),

takes Rocky to the carnival, where he
encounters a handsome reflection of
himself in the Hall of Mirrors; Rocky
works as a counselor's aide at a camp
for the blind, where he falls in love;
etc., etc. It's a shamelessly
manipulative movie — the kind of
movie 1 usually despise. Yet some of
it works, and 1 don't just mean it
works you over, because it is made by
skilled hands or because its subject
matter has so much built-in sentimen
tal force — though all of this can cer
tainly be said of "Mask." Peter Bog
danovich is not only shrewd; he's
gifted, too, and so the movie, which
under the control of another director
(James Brooks, who made "Terms of
Endearment," for instance) would be
easy enough to dismiss as a tear
jerker, is a more complicated
proposition. To be truthful, though I
knew what to make of "Mask," I was
at a loss about how to respond to it,
because though the movie is blatantly
a set-up, and some scenes display a
sensibility as atrocious as any in
recent movies — like one in which a
biker (Dennis Burkley), mute since
the outset of the picture, stutters out,
"I'm very proud of you. Rocky,"
after the boy's graduation — other
scenes, including the Hall of Mirrors
incident, somehow manage to tran
scend themselves and make an emo
tional impression. The movie upset
me for hours, and I woke up the next
morning with bits of it still swimming
around in my head. As a friend of
mine commented (paraphrasing a line
in the film), "Mask" does some of the
right things, though admittedly for
the wrong reasons.
The emotional authenticity of sec
tions of the movie derives, at least in
part, from the rapport between Cher
and young Eric Stoltz, who really

nearly four years.

carry the acting load between them;
aside from Laura Dern, whose
portrayal of the blind girl, Diana, in
cludes some lovely adolescent
flourishes, the supporting cast— Sam
Elliott, Ben Piazza, Richard Dysart
and Estelle Getty as Rusty's (oddly,
but unmistakably, New York-Jewish)
parents, Harry Carey, Jr. (!) as the
gang leader — is without distinction.
Stoltz isn't much good in the scenes in
which the script invests him with ex
traordinary wisdom and sensitivity
(the scenes in which the filmmakers
canonize him), but his balance of chil
dishness and moral self-righteousness
when he deals with his mother seems
emotionally right, even if you wish
the movie didn't persist in taking his
side whenever he attacks Rusty's life
style. (The real Rusty Dennis used to
research the physiological effects of
each of the drugs she ingested and
then take vitamins to correct the
deficiencies. That's the sort of quirky
detail the movie needs, along with a
lot more humor — the only possible
way to redeem a scene in which a
teenage boy lectures his mother on
drugs would be to acknowledge its
ludicrousness and play it for comedy.)
Stoltz must have loved acting with
Cher, who is not only a remarkably
generous actress but also a perfectly
straightforward one, devoid of tech
nique. Few screen performers make
such direct contact with the audience

by such (apparently) simple means,
and few are unaffected enough to
carry off a healing madonna role like
this one without making you squirm.
This is Cher's third dramatic appear
ance on screen, and her third success;
the frustrating part is that her perfor
mance feels truncated in the second
half, when Rusty fades out of the
picture for long stretches at a time,
showing up mainly in a series of

dopey close-ups of Cher standing in
doorways mooning up at Sam Elliott.
Cher has said that much of her best
work never made it to the final cut,
and you can believe it; everything
Rusty does makes sense, but you
don't see all her transitions, and you
miss the fluidity she brought to her
roles in "Come Back to the 5 &
Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean"
and "Silkwood."
The only piece of writing I admired
in this movie came in a confrontation
between Rocky and his lifelong pal,
Ben (Lawrence Monoson), another

child of the Turks, who delivers the
painful news that rather than follow
through on the European trip the two
of them have been planning and
saving up for, he's moving east to live
with his dad. Rocky, feeling
abandoned, lashes out at his friend,
calling him stupid (and thereby hit
ting Ben, who finds school an insur
mountable obstacle, in his weakest
area). When he walks into a new high
school that fall. Rocky carries a chip
on his shoulder; instead of meeting
the accustomed taunts of his fellow
students (before they have grown to
appreciate him) with his usual dis
arming humor, he shoves one of them
up against a locker. This section of
the movie could even be a lot
stronger — if Rocky really employed
his intellectual superiority to batter
Ben, instead of just waving it at him
— and it dissipates very quickly when
Rocky visits Diana and the knowl
edge that she still loves him restores
his inner peace. Clearly Hamilton and
Bogdanovich were after something
much simpler; the suggestion of emo
tional complexity mars the homiletic
nature of the rest of the movie (and,
of course, is commercially perilous).
But this brief exposure of Rocky's
potential for unattractive behavior
hints at the kind of movie someone
with a different sensibility might have
made of this material. In Perrault's
story, when Beauty kisses her Beast,
beyond acknowledging the beauty
inside him, she is embracing the beast
within herself. The makers of "Mask"
only take the fairy tale to the halfway
point.

takes Rocky to the carnival, where he
encounters a handsome reflection of
himself in the Hall of Mirrors; Rocky
works as a counselor's aide at a camp
for the blind, where he falls in love;
etc., etc. It's a shamelessly
manipulative movie — the kind of
movie 1 usually despise. Yet some of
it works, and 1 don't just mean it
works you over, because it is made by
skilled hands or because its subject
matter has so much built-in sentimen
tal force — though all of this can cer
tainly be said of "Mask." Peter Bog
danovich is not only shrewd; he's
gifted, too, and so the movie, which
under the control of another director
(James Brooks, who made "Terms of
Endearment," for instance) would be
easy enough to dismiss as a tear
jerker, is a more complicated
proposition. To be truthful, though I
knew what to make of "Mask," I was
at a loss about how to respond to it,
because though the movie is blatantly
a set-up, and some scenes display a
sensibility as atrocious as any in
recent movies — like one in which a
biker (Dennis Burkley), mute since
the outset of the picture, stutters out,
"I'm very proud of you. Rocky,"
after the boy's graduation — other
scenes, including the Hall of Mirrors
incident, somehow manage to tran
scend themselves and make an emo
tional impression. The movie upset
me for hours, and I woke up the next
morning with bits of it still swimming
around in my head. As a friend of
mine commented (paraphrasing a line
in the film), "Mask" does some of the
right things, though admittedly for
the wrong reasons.
The emotional authenticity of sec
tions of the movie derives, at least in
part, from the rapport between Cher
and young Eric Stoltz, who really

nearly four years.

carry the acting load between them;
aside from Laura Dern, whose
portrayal of the blind girl, Diana, in
cludes some lovely adolescent
flourishes, the supporting cast— Sam
Elliott, Ben Piazza, Richard Dysart
and Estelle Getty as Rusty's (oddly,
but unmistakably, New York-Jewish)
parents, Harry Carey, Jr. (!) as the
gang leader — is without distinction.
Stoltz isn't much good in the scenes in
which the script invests him with ex
traordinary wisdom and sensitivity
(the scenes in which the filmmakers
canonize him), but his balance of chil
dishness and moral self-righteousness
when he deals with his mother seems
emotionally right, even if you wish
the movie didn't persist in taking his
side whenever he attacks Rusty's life
style. (The real Rusty Dennis used to
research the physiological effects of
each of the drugs she ingested and
then take vitamins to correct the
deficiencies. That's the sort of quirky
detail the movie needs, along with a
lot more humor — the only possible
way to redeem a scene in which a
teenage boy lectures his mother on
drugs would be to acknowledge its
ludicrousness and play it for comedy.)
Stoltz must have loved acting with
Cher, who is not only a remarkably
generous actress but also a perfectly
straightforward one, devoid of tech
nique. Few screen performers make
such direct contact with the audience

by such (apparently) simple means,
and few are unaffected enough to
carry off a healing madonna role like
this one without making you squirm.
This is Cher's third dramatic appear
ance on screen, and her third success;
the frustrating part is that her perfor
mance feels truncated in the second
half, when Rusty fades out of the
picture for long stretches at a time,
showing up mainly in a series of

dopey close-ups of Cher standing in
doorways mooning up at Sam Elliott.
Cher has said that much of her best
work never made it to the final cut,
and you can believe it; everything
Rusty does makes sense, but you
don't see all her transitions, and you
miss the fluidity she brought to her
roles in "Come Back to the 5 &
Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean"
and "Silkwood."
The only piece of writing I admired
in this movie came in a confrontation
between Rocky and his lifelong pal,
Ben (Lawrence Monoson), another

child of the Turks, who delivers the
painful news that rather than follow
through on the European trip the two
of them have been planning and
saving up for, he's moving east to live
with his dad. Rocky, feeling
abandoned, lashes out at his friend,
calling him stupid (and thereby hit
ting Ben, who finds school an insur
mountable obstacle, in his weakest
area). When he walks into a new high
school that fall. Rocky carries a chip
on his shoulder; instead of meeting
the accustomed taunts of his fellow
students (before they have grown to
appreciate him) with his usual dis
arming humor, he shoves one of them
up against a locker. This section of
the movie could even be a lot
stronger — if Rocky really employed
his intellectual superiority to batter
Ben, instead of just waving it at him
— and it dissipates very quickly when
Rocky visits Diana and the knowl
edge that she still loves him restores
his inner peace. Clearly Hamilton and
Bogdanovich were after something
much simpler; the suggestion of emo
tional complexity mars the homiletic
nature of the rest of the movie (and,
of course, is commercially perilous).
But this brief exposure of Rocky's
potential for unattractive behavior
hints at the kind of movie someone
with a different sensibility might have
made of this material. In Perrault's
story, when Beauty kisses her Beast,
beyond acknowledging the beauty
inside him, she is embracing the beast
within herself. The makers of "Mask"
only take the fairy tale to the halfway
point.
"Mask," written by Anna Hamil
ton Phelan and directed by Peter
Bogdanovich, tells the true-life story
of Rocky Dennis, a Southern Califor
nia boy with a rare condition known
popularly as "lionitis" and consisting
of gross facial distortions (amounting
to an expansion of areas of the face)
and deposits of calcium in the skull.
Expected to die in infancy, or to end
up blind, dead or retarded, Rocky
managed to survive until the age of
16, an exceptionally bright kid whose
mother. Rusty — a woman with no
use for convention, attached to a
motorcycle gang, raising Rocky in her
own style without the assistance of his
long-absent father — fought to keep
him mainstreamed, enrolled in public
schools and fully conversant with the

tough ways of the world. The film
covers roughly the last year of
Rocky's life: his transition to a new
school, his conflict with his mother
over her dependence on drugs, his
first romance. It's a triumph-over
adversity story, an inspirational
movie in which the young hero,
taught by his mother to "make him
self well" — she practices a kind of
holistic medicine to keep Rocky
healthy and nurse away the horren
dous headaches that sometimes dis
turb his sleep — illustrates over and
over again the power of positive
thinking.
Peter Bogdanovich-hasn't had a hit
movie in more than a decade, and he
and Anna Hamilton Phelan take no
chances on this one. Nothing in the
picture happens casually; everything
is carefully rigged to emphasize the

theme, which is the same as that of
most fairy tales: Appearances
deceive. Rocky (Eric Stoltz) isn't just
a physically deformed teenager with
normal impulses; he's super-normal
— a straight-A student, a Dodgers
freak with an impressive baseball
card collection, witty, personable,
sensitive, gregarious. As resplendent
on the inside as he is unsightly on the
outside, he's the Beast in the Perrault
fable, and Rusty, who appreciates her
son's inner worth and cultivates it, is
Beauty. As played by Cher, in the
first film role that has allowed her to
look truly glamorous — Rita
Hayworth-like, with a thick head of
lustrous red hair — Rusty is the
physical personification of Rocky's
heart and soul, and she looks espe
cially luminous in their scenes to
gether. Rusty's lifestyle (she spends
much of her time high on various
drugs and chooses unceremoniously
from among several lovers) does not
prevent her from providing Rocky
with all the emotional security he re
quires — as well as financial security,
though the movie doesn't elucidate
how she supports the two of them.
Moreover, the bikers (who call them
selves "the Turks") are as concerned
and sturdy a support system as any
teenager could ask for. When he
graduates at the head of his junior
high school class, they show up to
cheer his achievements; he leans over
to the principal (Ben Piazza) and in
forms him with a proud smile, "That's
my family."
Phelan and Bogdijnovich have
filled the movie with emblematic
scenes that any teen reader of S.E.
Hinton could decipher on cue. Rocky
regales his class with a summary (in
adolescent hip style) of the causes of
the Trojan War, with a special em
phasis on Helen's beauty; an old
lover of Rocky's, Gar (Sam Elliott),

takes Rocky to the carnival, where he
encounters a handsome reflection of
himself in the Hall of Mirrors; Rocky
works as a counselor's aide at a camp
for the blind, where he falls in love;

Cher has said that much of her best
work never made it to the final cut,
and you can believe it; everything
Rusty does makes sense, but you
don't see all her transitions, and you
miss the fluidity she brought to her

The only piece of writing I admired
in this movie came in a confrontation
between Rocky and his lifelong pal,
Ben (Lawrence Monoson), another

child of the Turks, who delivers the
painful news that rather than follow
through on the European trip the two
of them have been planning and
saving up for, he's moving east to live
with his dad. Rocky, feeling
abandoned, lashes out at his friend,
calling him stupid (and thereby hit
ting Ben, who finds school an insur
mountable obstacle, in his weakest
area). When he walks into a new high
school that fall. Rocky carries a chip
on his shoulder; instead of meeting
the accustomed taunts of his fellow
students (before they have grown to
appreciate him) with his usual dis
arming humor, he shoves one of them
up against a locker. This section of
the movie could even be a lot
stronger — if Rocky really employed
his intellectual superiority to batter
Ben, instead of just waving it at him
— and it dissipates very quickly when
Rocky visits Diana and the knowl
edge that she still loves him restores
his inner peace. Clearly Hamilton and
Bogdanovich were after something
much simpler; the suggestion of emo
tional complexity mars the homiletic
nature of the rest of the movie (and,
of course, is commercially perilous).
But this brief exposure of Rocky's
potential for unattractive behavior
hints at the kind of movie someone
with a different sensibility might have
made of this material. In Perrault's
story, when Beauty kisses her Beast,
beyond acknowledging the beauty
inside him, she is embracing the beast
within herself. The makers of "Mask"
only take the fairy tale to the halfway
point.
