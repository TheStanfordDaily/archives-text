## Morgan 'lacks depth' 
### ANDREW CROWELL 
Until last week, I had never heard of Denroy Morgan
and, more particularly, had not heard of the release of his
"Make My Day" album. As Morgan records for RCA, I
felt like I should have heard of him, though I could only

plead guilty of ignorance. Some of the most progressive
and cogent new work receives very little exposure in my
opinion, and it is for these reasons that 1 did not dismiss
the opportunity to listen. Unfortunately, though, I was
disappointed and frustrated with what 1 heard.
1 must confess that when I saw the June 1984 album
notes I was quite curious as to why RCA was only just
now sending a copy to The Daily's entertainment ottice.
Was the album that good or were the big execs merely
trying to clear their shelves of some unsold — and for
good reason— merchandise? I'm afraid it may have been
for the latter reason.
The album does have some noteworthy points, though,
for the most part, it falls into the shapeless melange of
mainstream pop/reggae/calypso music without really add
ing anything new to this genre. While "Universal
Party/Into the Light" does have a certain toe-tapping
quality, it fails to evoke the festive and jubilant nature of
an "All Night Long"' or a "Celebration. I was pleased
that Denroy did not put the title track in an all-too
predictable side one, song one, position, although this
proved to be the one really pleasing aspect of the song.
"Bear With Me" is best described as a Chicago tune —
not only with its loosely harmonized background vocals
but in its lack of depth lyrically as well. "Everybody
Wants to be Somebody Else" means well in its attempt to
portray peoples' dissatisfaction with themselves and envy
of others but never quite fully develops this idea. "Hold
On (To the Good Things)" encourages the listener to take
hold of the positive and good things in life but doesn't
capture the depth or have the emotional appeal of a
"Wallflower," an anthem/ballad by Peter Gabriel.
I would be misleading you if 1 said "Make My Day" has
no redeeming qualities. The lyrics are all extremely posi
tive, even if they don't have any real depth or develop
ment. Similarly, the music has some catchy sections, but
unfortunately, these sections just don't last very long.


"Make My Day," a blend of pop, reggae and calypso
is Denroy Morgan's latest album.
