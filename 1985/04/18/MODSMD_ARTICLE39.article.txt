# Updike and notes on norms
## 
### Facing Nature" By John Updike Knopf, 110 pp., $13. 95 
1. This stuff is utterly ir
redeemable. In a poem called "No
More Access to Her Underpants,"
John Updike — author of 11 novels
and, according to the back flap of this
pne, "15 or so other books" (or so?:
This guy is either killingly coy or he
should get somebody to go over to his
bouse to count the number of match
ingly bound books on the book
shelves he reserves for his ouevre, not
me though.) — writes: "Her red dress
stretched across the remembered
small / of her dear bare back, bare for
me no more, / that once so softly bent
itself in bed / to take my thrusts and
then my stunned caress . . . / she
shows a face / of stone and turns to

others at the party." A common sub
urban situation, the kind of which
Updike is allegedly "King": Two
bodies which touched heretofore now
touch no more. The poem ends: "her
eyes like pits / of warmth in the
tousled light: all forfeit, / and locked
in antarctic ice by this bitch."
This is a common and stupid sexism
— not a sexism that is "depicted" or
circumscribed by an intelligence, but
one bought into. To illustrate the dif
ference, this is James Dickey (a man
not afraid of his own vulgarity), from
a poem called "Adultery": Nothing
"can come / Of us: of me with my
grim techniques / Or you who have
sealed your womb/With a ring of
convulsive rubber . . . / Listen: / We

have done it again we are / Still living.
Sit up and smile, / God bless you.
Guilt is magical." To be sure, Dickey
is not adverse to calling a woman a
bitch, but he is, as a poet, at least
aware of what kind of man that
makes him; and he, not Updike, can
inscribe into a poem this (still rather
basic) complexity of voice.

2. I quote a friend of mine: "You
must know by now that poetry is
dying. If you argue that point, I'm
gonna leave. So we must move on to
what is the key question: Is it
worth saving?

3. Yipes: evidence: from John
Updike: this: "Waiting Rooms: Mass.
Mental Health": "The women are
different — haughty tramps/

exhaling. One wears a paper
hat / and has good legs, though bitten
nails. / She asks me, 'You a doctor?' I
say, 'No,' / all agitated. When men
crack, we expect / murder to out;
when women crack, sex." (Like the
earlier poem, a sonnet.)

4. Two quotes from William Carlos
Williams: "You can put it down as a
general rule that when a poet begins
to devote himself to the subject
matter of his poems, genre, he has
come to the end of his poetic means."
And a poet needs "to liberate the
possibilities of depicting reality in a
modern world that has seen more if
not felt more than in the past— in or
der to be able to feel more (for we

know we feel less, or surmise we do.
Vocabulary opens the mind to
feeling.)"

5. It is easy to see why Updike is at
tractive to so many. He explores no
new vocabulary, opens the mind to no
new feeling. So even if his novels, es
says, stories and poems are all glint
ingly manufactured, his "vision" is
relentlessly ossifying and normal. By
the word "normal" I mean what "we
all," in our lazier moments, can agree
on to be the facts of the world we
share. So when Updike writes a story
about a little boy who loses his faith
in God, "we all" can say to ourselves
without surprise that, gosh, it was just
like that for us as well. And in this
way Updike aims to consolidate the
values that threaten this country with

permanent mediocrity. (It is interest
ing that every once in awhile Updike
will explore what might be called the
abnormal and dip into the Kinsey
report in order to describe one of the
more bending sexual acts, but, as a
reviewer before me has pointed out,
Updike won't publish these pieces in
the widely distributed New Yorker,
only in magazines the size and moral
equivalent of a closet.)

6. To return to my friend's dire
question: Is contemporary poetry
worth saving? After reading "Facing
Nature," I can certainlysee where the
question comes from, but I don't
think, finally, that the question makes
sense — put in the way it is — be

cause until our sensibilities are com
pletely squished out of us and we
roam among pruned palm trees
squeaking and gibbering with tooth
picks in our teeth, we will (on instinct,
to survive) have no choice but to put
together lines of words in memorable
rhythms (and that is the only descrip
tion of poetry I have ever been able
to keep in my head or have been able
to explain to people without looking
like a jerk).

7. A comparison test. Subject A:
"The Masses." Updike goes first.
"Small-city people hardly expect to
get/looked at, in their parkas / and
their hunting caps and
babushkas / and Dacron suits and
outmoded / bouffants." Now, of The
Pretenders, Chrissie Hynde:
"Corrugated tin shacks filled up with
kids / Man this ain't no Hampstead
nursery. / When you own a big chunk
of the bloody third world / the babies
just come with the scenery." Updike,
simulating empathy, hands us the
comfy, condescending and moronic
cliches we've become used to. Hynde
gives us a naked fact and an up-yours
maxim, in a banging cadence.
B: "Death." Updike: "Life is
worse than folly. We live / within a
cage wherefrom escape annihilates
the captive; this, too, / pain leads us
to consider anew." Pete Townshend:
"I hope I die before I get old."
C: "Girls/Angst." "You will
outlive me, artful girl, / ... the light
in your eyes like the light on your
pearl" (from "Head of a Girl,
At The Met ,? ; guess whom by.) Better:
"I see the girls walk by dressed in
their summer clothes. /1 have to close
my eyes until the darkness goes"
(from "Paint it Black" by Mick Jag
ger and Keith Richards).
D: "Light Verse." Updike: "Her
fingertips remind me of / A digital
computer; / She simply couldn't be,
my love, I A millimeter cuter." (I
should say "lite verse.") Here is "Oh
No" by Robert Creeley: "If you
wander far enough / you will get to
it / and when you get there / they will
give you a place to sit // for yourself
only, in a nice chair, / and all your
friends will be there / with smiles on
their faces / and they will likewise all
have places."

8. To swipe some swipes from T.S.
Eliot, I must conclude that, on the
evidence of this cheating little book
of poetry, Mr. Updike's brain may
indeed swarm with ideas, but I see no
evidence that it thinks, and his
epigrams are a facile substitute for
observation and inference.
— Bob Basil


This is a common and
stupid sexism. .. .
Updike's brain may
swarm with ideas, but I
see no evidence that it
thinks.
