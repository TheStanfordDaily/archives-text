# BSU calls for boycott
## Kennedy again rejects blanket divestment 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
The Black Student Union (BSU) yester
day called for "the entire Stanford commu
nity to join with us" in a boycott of products
of corporations operating in South Africa.
The BSU made the statement in a press
conference in front of University President
Donald Kennedy's office after members of
the group asked Kennedy to push for
blanket divestment of Stanford's stock in
corporations that do business in South
Africa. Kennedy, who has opposed such a
move in the past, again refused, members of
the BSU said.
BSU Chairman Steve Phillips said Ken
nedy also refused to join the boycott of "the
products of all corporations in South
Africa."
Although not asking for a student sit-in,
Phillips said "no options are going to be
closed," adding the group will "keep our

channels open and will just access (possible
actions) as we go along."
"We hope to pressure the corporations to
leave (South Africa) with a two-part strat
egy," Phillips said in a prepared statement.
"Part one consists of total divestment, start
ing with Motorola as the student body has
continually demanded. Part two is the
boycott of the products of companies such as
Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson and Revlon
that operate in South Africa."
Phillips said he expects an immediate tan
gible result from the boycott of Coca-Cola,
noting the"day to day awareness derived
from that."
A student sit-in at UC-Berkeley to
protest the UC system's investments in com
panies doing business in South Africa led to
the arrest of 159 people Tuesday.
"You cannot say that because Cal has
done something, we should do something,"
Phillips said. "The fundamental issue is not

who can match who in arrests."
Kennedy, who was not present at the
press conference, told the University News
Service he thinks "the legislative front is the
one on which we ought to move. We can
only have one foreign policy toward South
Africa, and we ought to influence what it
is."
He said, however, that "the students
made a strong, persuasive appeal for more
constructive action from me and my col
leagues on this issue."
Phillips said divestment is necessary be
cause corporations that do business in South
Africa pay taxes to that country's govern
ment, strengthening the government's racist
system of apartheid.
"Our first step is to take Stanford out and
wash our hands of a system that is so cruel
and unjust," said BSU Treasurer Donna
