William Stafford, a National
Book Award winner and former
consultant in poetry to the Library
of Congress, will be reading from
his work today at 4:15 pm in His
tory Corner, Bldg. 200, Rm. 2.
The reading is being sponsored by
The Creative Writing Program,
the Department of English and the
ASSU — and it concludes ASSU's
1985 Writer's Series, a program
which has brought John Barth,
James Dickey and Edward Albee
to campus.
Stafford is the author of many
books of poems, the most recent
being "A Glass Face in the Rain,"
published by Harper and Row. A
collection of essays and interviews,
"Writing the Australian Crawl:
Views on the Writer's Vocation,"
was published by the University of
Michigan Press in 1978.
No one in contemporary letters
is more unassailably plain
speaking, quote unquote, than
Stafford. "My p'oetry," he has
said, "seems to me direct and
communicative, with some oddity
and variety. It is usually not for
mal. It is much like talk, with some
enhancement.
"Often my poetry is discursive
and reminiscent, or at least is that
way at one level: it delivers a sense
of place and event; it has narrative
impulses. Forms are not usually
much evident, though tendencies
and patterns are occasionally
flirted with. Thomas Hardy is my
most congenial poetry landmark.

but actually the voice I most con
sistently hear in my poetry is my
mother's voice."
Born in Kansas in 1914, Stafc
ford did not publish a book of
poems until he was in his mid-50s.
In the interim, he worked as a
laborer on construction jobs, in
sugar beet fields and in an oil
refinery. A conscientious objector
during World War 11, he was com
missioned to alternative service in
the U.S. Conservation Service,
then in The Breathren Service
Commission and Church World
Service. After teaching at Lewis
and Clark College in Oregon for
30 years, he retired in 1978 and
has since devoted himself full-time
to his writing.
The terrain Stafford explores in
his work is geographically rural
and emotionally personal — he
seeks to raise the minutiae of the
common world to an uncommon
level of illumination. But critic
Paul Christensen has pointed out
that Stafford is more than merely
placid and notes in these lines
from "With My Crowbar Key" a
"macabre loneliness and maniacal
passion":
When 1 see my town over sights
of a rifle,
and carved by light
from the lowering sun,
then my old friends darken one by
one. " "
— Bob Basil
