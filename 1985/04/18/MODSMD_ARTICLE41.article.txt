"Unknown California"
Edited by Jonathan Eisen and
David Fine, with Kim Eisen
MacMillan, 404 pp., $10.95
It was the total weekend.
Went to San Diego, to this condo,
took some rays, ate Mexican down in
La Jolla, then found this bitchin'
Gelateria. Noticed, sitting in this
linoleum pleasure palace, that I didn't
show — I mean, no new lines — so I
went to the Tan-ery and used the tan
ning beds. The Tan-ery was in this
mall, but everything was closed — the
Taco Bell was closed, Computerland
was closed, even the Gelateria was
closed and the yogurt place had just
gone out of business. But there was
this, like, bookstore, and in between
the Zen books and the aerobics books
were books that had been, like, just
printed.
So I bought this book. It's called
"The Unknown California," and it's a
collection of essays about our state.
But it's not like a travel guide or any
thing — it's serious, totally, with es
says by real writers of literature, jour
nalists, new journalists, old
naturalists and college profs. And its
good and funny, and readable and
better than nachos.
"The Unknown California" is the
brainchild of Johnathan and Kim
Eisen and David Fine. They decided
that it would be a good idea to gather
what they felt to be the "best" writing
on California and by Californians in
an anthology that would give non-
Californians and natives a better idea
of what the state is like. They were
right. There are many books on Cali
fornia, and many books on Califor
nians, but I've never seen one that
has such a range of information and
insight.
The readings, some written little
more than a year ago and others more
than a century old, include short
stories, excerpts from novels, maga
zine articles and letters. There is an
essay by the reclusive Thomas
Pynchon on the Watts riots of the
'60s, a story by Mark Twain and a
condensation of the book "The Life
And Times Of Harvey Milk" by
Randy Shilts.
The articles are grouped into five
sections: an introduction, articles on
Northern and Southern California,
articles on protest movements, and an
account of the "paving of paradise"
with articles on boutiques, com
puters and Disneyland. The divisions
seem a little arbitrary; essays on '60s
counterculture are in the "Northern
California" section, and the introduc
tory essays could go anywhere else in
the book.
I imagine this division is one of

several attempts to make this book as
low-brow as possible. The editors of
the anthology seem somewhat ner
vous that their effort might be dis
missed by some as being more of a
textbook than a "good read." It does
have the flavor of a course reader for
"California 001." Like those of a
course reader, the articles seem to be
chosen and grouped together to
prove a point — objectively as possi
ble — about California and its culture.
But as interesting as I find the
readings in this book, I'm not sure
what exactly the editors' particular
"slant" is on our state. The readings,
in their attempt to present all sides of
the story, contradict each other or oc
casionally even cancel each other out.
The title of "The Unknown Cali
fornia" also confuses me: The book
seems to be a collection of interesting
details about the obvious. True,
before I read the book I never knew
that the dwarves in Disneyland
defend themselves by flailing over
eager children with their fake arms,
but I knew that Disneyland was there.
The title suggests that this is a travel
guide to places that haven't been
"discovered" yet. But where are the
finds? There's no fold-out map, no
intellectual La Honda bars, no so
phisticated L.A. truck stops.
A lot of space is devoted to the
defining of Los Angeles; while arti
cles about Northern California tend
to be about the past — migrant
workers in Salinas and '60s hippies in
the Haight — articles about Los
Angeles discuss the here, now and
plastic. We find out (surprise) that
people disagree about L.A. Lewis

Lapham, devout tasterner and editor
of Harper's Monthly, paints Los An
geles as a haven for the hypocrite:
If a man says he is a writer, it is pos
sible that he writes notes to his dog, in
green ink on a certain kind of yellow
paper that he buys in Paris. If a
woman says she's an actress, it is pos
sible that she once stood next to Mar
lon Brando in an airport, and he
looked at her in such a way that she
knew that he thought she was under
contract to Paramount.
However, John Gregory Dunne
(journalist, husband of Joan Didion)
sees the natural beauty of his
hometown. 112
When I think of Los Angeles now
... I sometimes feel an astonishment,

and attachment that approaches joy. 1
am attached to the way palm trees float
and recede down empty avenues. The
particular curve of the coastline as one
leaves the tunnel at the end of the
Santa Monica Freeway ... to the
deceptive perspective of the pale sub
tropical light.

Where are the finds? There's no fold
out map.

Even though the book lacks an
overriding viewpoint, the individual
articles go a long way in the Califor
nia tradition of "consciousness
raising." Pynchon's article on Watts is
chilling. Oliver Zeta Acosta, known
mainly as the "Dr. Gonzo" in Hunter
Thompson's "Fear and Loathing In
Las Vegas," shows a serious side in
an excerpt from his "The Revolt of
the Cockroach People," a novel
which pits Chicanos against "the
white Los Angeles power structure."
Even the dated material — articles on
the rebellion of field workers in the
19305, excerpts from Steinback —
remind the reader that California
never really was a land of gold,
romance and opportunity.

Let me go back to mentioning
some authors: Wallace Stegner, ex
director of the writing program here,
writes about what it means to him to
be Californian. There is an essay by
Will Irwin, an early 20th century eth
nographer of Chinatown who has
been out of print since 1911. Stuff by
Norman Mailer, Evelyn Waugh,
Henry Miller . . . lots of people whom
you'd never associate with the West
Coast. Maybe this book should have
been called "California; The Un
known Connection."
Who is this book for? Well, people
who've never been to California
might find it (um) hard to relate to,
but 1 assume anyone reading this
review has at least visited the state.
There's enough ancient, out-of-print
and obscure material to interest even
the jaded Californian.
As an ex-Easterner, I wonder if
this book would have altered my
preconceptions of California if I'd
read it before coming to Stanford.
Perhaps I wouldn't have stubbornly
insisted that Californians were bound
to be the same as Other People. Now
I know better. Until a book called
"The Unknown New Jersey" hits the
market, I'll be convinced that Califor
nia isn't a state, but a concept. To
tally.

The articles are grouped into five
sections: an introduction, articles on
Northern and Southern California,
articles on protest movements, and an
account of the "paving of paradise"
with articles on boutiques, com
puters and Disneyland. The divisions
seem a little arbitrary; essays on '60s
counterculture are in the "Northern
California" section, and the introduc
tory essays could go anywhere else in
the book.
I imagine this division is one of

several attempts to make this book as
low-brow as possible. The editors of
the anthology seem somewhat ner
vous that their effort might be dis
missed by some as being more of a
textbook than a "good read." It does
have the flavor of a course reader for
"California 001." Like those of a
course reader, the articles seem to be
chosen and grouped together to
prove a point — objectively as possi
ble — about California and its culture.
But as interesting as I find the
readings in this book, I'm not sure
what exactly the editors' particular
"slant" is on our state. The readings,
in their attempt to present all sides of
the story, contradict each other or oc
casionally even cancel each other out.
The title of "The Unknown Cali
fornia" also confuses me: The book
seems to be a collection of interesting
details about the obvious. True,
before I read the book I never knew
that the dwarves in Disneyland
defend themselves by flailing over
eager children with their fake arms,
but I knew that Disneyland was there.
The title suggests that this is a travel
guide to places that haven't been
"discovered" yet. But where are the
finds? There's no fold-out map, no
intellectual La Honda bars, no so
phisticated L.A. truck stops.
A lot of space is devoted to the
defining of Los Angeles; while arti
cles about Northern California tend
to be about the past — migrant
workers in Salinas and '60s hippies in
the Haight — articles about Los
Angeles discuss the here, now and
plastic. We find out (surprise) that
people disagree about L.A. Lewis

Lapham, devout tasterner and editor
of Harper's Monthly, paints Los An
geles as a haven for the hypocrite:
If a man says he is a writer, it is pos
sible that he writes notes to his dog, in
green ink on a certain kind of yellow
paper that he buys in Paris. If a
woman says she's an actress, it is pos
sible that she once stood next to Mar
lon Brando in an airport, and he
looked at her in such a way that she
knew that he thought she was under
contract to Paramount.
However, John Gregory Dunne
(journalist, husband of Joan Didion)
sees the natural beauty of his
hometown. 112
When I think of Los Angeles now
... I sometimes feel an astonishment,

and attachment that approaches joy. 1
am attached to the way palm trees float
and recede down empty avenues. The
particular curve of the coastline as one
leaves the tunnel at the end of the
Santa Monica Freeway ... to the
deceptive perspective of the pale sub
tropical light.

Where are the finds? There's no fold
out map.

Even though the book lacks an
overriding viewpoint, the individual
articles go a long way in the Califor
nia tradition of "consciousness
raising." Pynchon's article on Watts is
chilling. Oliver Zeta Acosta, known
mainly as the "Dr. Gonzo" in Hunter
Thompson's "Fear and Loathing In
Las Vegas," shows a serious side in
an excerpt from his "The Revolt of
the Cockroach People," a novel
which pits Chicanos against "the
white Los Angeles power structure."
Even the dated material — articles on
the rebellion of field workers in the
19305, excerpts from Steinback —
remind the reader that California
never really was a land of gold,
romance and opportunity.

Let me go back to mentioning
some authors: Wallace Stegner, ex
director of the writing program here,
writes about what it means to him to
be Californian. There is an essay by
Will Irwin, an early 20th century eth
nographer of Chinatown who has
been out of print since 1911. Stuff by
Norman Mailer, Evelyn Waugh,
Henry Miller . . . lots of people whom
you'd never associate with the West
Coast. Maybe this book should have
been called "California; The Un
known Connection."
Who is this book for? Well, people
who've never been to California
might find it (um) hard to relate to,
but 1 assume anyone reading this
review has at least visited the state.
There's enough ancient, out-of-print
and obscure material to interest even
the jaded Californian.
As an ex-Easterner, I wonder if
this book would have altered my
preconceptions of California if I'd
read it before coming to Stanford.
Perhaps I wouldn't have stubbornly
insisted that Californians were bound
to be the same as Other People. Now
I know better. Until a book called
"The Unknown New Jersey" hits the
market, I'll be convinced that Califor
nia isn't a state, but a concept. To
tally.

"Unknown California"
Edited by Jonathan Eisen and
David Fine, with Kim Eisen
MacMillan, 404 pp., $10.95
It was the total weekend.
Went to San Diego, to this condo,
took some rays, ate Mexican down in
La Jolla, then found this bitchin'
Gelateria. Noticed, sitting in this
linoleum pleasure palace, that I didn't
show — I mean, no new lines — so I
went to the Tan-ery and used the tan
ning beds. The Tan-ery was in this
mall, but everything was closed — the
Taco Bell was closed, Computerland
was closed, even the Gelateria was
closed and the yogurt place had just
gone out of business. But there was
this, like, bookstore, and in between
the Zen books and the aerobics books
were books that had been, like, just
printed.
So I bought this book. It's called
"The Unknown California," and it's a
collection of essays about our state.
But it's not like a travel guide or any
thing — it's serious, totally, with es
says by real writers of literature, jour
nalists, new journalists, old
naturalists and college profs. And its
good and funny, and readable and
better than nachos.
"The Unknown California" is the
brainchild of Johnathan and Kim
Eisen and David Fine. They decided
that it would be a good idea to gather
what they felt to be the "best" writing
on California and by Californians in
an anthology that would give non-
Californians and natives a better idea
of what the state is like. They were
right. There are many books on Cali
fornia, and many books on Califor
nians, but I've never seen one that
has such a range of information and
insight.
The readings, some written little
more than a year ago and others more
than a century old, include short
stories, excerpts from novels, maga
zine articles and letters. There is an
essay by the reclusive Thomas
Pynchon on the Watts riots of the
'60s, a story by Mark Twain and a
condensation of the book "The Life
And Times Of Harvey Milk" by
Randy Shilts.
The articles are grouped into five
