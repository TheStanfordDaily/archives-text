## Respectable lunacy 
### The Tree of Hands" By Ruth Rendell Pantheon Books, 271 pp., $13. 95 
Ruth Rendell is an acclaimed mys
tery writer, having received awards
for her work in both England and
America."The Tree of Hands,"
however, is not a mystery, but a thril
ler iri the tradition of Alfred
Hitchcock, a frightening glimpse of
the psychological horrors hidden
beneath mundane, respectable
surfaces.
In this novel, one of society's most
"respectable" emotions— the love of
a mother for her child — evolves into
a criminal passion. Benet Archdale, a
successful novelist and a single
mother by choice, loses her adored
2-year-old son to a sudden illness.
Benet's emotionally unstable mother,
visiting her daughter and grandson,
commits the initial crime of kidnap
ping another child as a consolation
for her daughter. This action is the
first in a series of events driven by an
exaggerated or insane motherly love.
The backdrop to this scene of respec

table lunacy is a series of sane but dis
reputable actions, including petty
theft and fraud. These two extremes
are skillfully woven together, chapter
by chapter, linked only by the kid
napped child, the common
denominator in the lives of Benet
Archdale and the less fortunate
welfare mother, Carol Stratton.
This contrast between the everyday
crimes of Carol Stratton's blue collar
world and the insane, love-driven
crime of Benet Archdale is the
greatest strength of the book, as it
gives the reader the overwhelming
sense that the obvious crimes are so
important, so normal, in comparison
to the possibilities unleashed when
the best of human emotions goes
awry.
Rendell's insight into human psy
chology, combined with her skill in
characterization and her realistic,
astutely recorded dialogue in both
white- and blue-collar settings, make
"The Tree of Hands" a readable,
thoughtful and frightening novel.
