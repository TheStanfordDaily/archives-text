## Macintosh use grows on campuses nationwide 
### MARK LAWRENCE Staff writer 
'• After several years of growing
Availability and decreasing cost, Ap
ple Macintosh computers are now
being widely used at Stanford and at
universities across the country, offer
tog both students and professors what
many have found to be a time-saving
and effective tool.
- About 50,000 Macintosh com
puters are now being used in the
nationwide Apple University Consor
tjum (AUC), according to Peter
Qlivieri of Boston College, who par
ticipated in an AUC conference here
last month. Stanford is one of 24 uni
versities selected by Apple to in
tegrate its computers into college
education. Other participating
schools include Columbia, Harvard,
Rice, Carnegie-Mellon and the Uni
versity of Washington.
Stanford's efforts to promote
microcomputers include Microdisc, a
discount purchase plan for Apple,
Hewlett Packard and IBM microcom
puters offered to students, faculty
and staff.
At Stanford, "on the order of
4,000 Macintoshes have been sold"
through Microdisc, according to Tom
Maliska, academic computing spe

cialist for Instruction and Research
Information Systems. "That in itself
speaks of the great student interest in
the computers. Almost all the com
ments have been positive."
Academic Computing Specialist
Eric Mathre said delivery of com
puters has been slow because of the
great demand but added: "I think
people are pleased. I haven't ever
talked to people who have a negative
view of the whole thing."
"It's easy to use and versatile," said
Macintosh owner Keith Yamashita, a
freshman. "The disadvantages that
first came out with it are being im
proved."
Contentment with Macintosh com
puters is not unanimous, however.
Freshman Melissa Walter, who
regularly uses Macintoshes at Meyer
Library, said, "Stanford's program is
good, but the thing I find frustrating
is that the Macintoshes will present
me with something I can't deal with.
It's supposed to be user-friendly, but
sometimes it presents you with things
you can't handle."
Recently, the faculty has also bene
fitted from the use of Macintosh com
puters. The Faculty Author Develop
ment program provides faculty with
the equipment and training necessary

to integrate the use of microcom
puters into their classes. Eleven pro
fessors are taking part in the pilot
program this year, and approximately
50 proposals have been submitted for
next yearly faculty from more than
20 academic departments.
Engineering Prof. Robert Eustis,
who used microcomputers in his In
troduction to the Thermosciences
class winter quarter, said of the com
puters: "They worked very we|l for us
and can be a very valuable teaching
tool. The feedback we got from stu
dents was very good."
"I am quite pleased with the way it
worked out," said Engineering Prof.
Henry Riggs, who used Macintoshes
in his Industrial Accounting class.
"The best I could tell from student
evaluations at the end of the quarter
was that there was a fairly positive re
action. For some students, working
with the microcomputer was a bonus
they got from the course," he said.
Riggs said the Macintosh was not
ideal because of a limited memory
capacity and the need to change disks
frequently, but he has
"recommended it and would plan to
use it again."

since the Microdisc program began here last year.
