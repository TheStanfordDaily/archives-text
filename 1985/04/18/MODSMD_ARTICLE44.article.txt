# Cable TV in the works

### KEVIN SHORT 
Though still enmeshed in a web of legal entanglements,
cable TV may be well on its way to the Stanford area.
According to a communique issued by Academic Com
puting and Information Systems (ACIS), the University is
interested in cable TV not only for the wider range of pro
gramming and interactive services that would become
available, but also for the possibilities of Stanford
originated programming that could be sent over the com
munity CATV system.
But the negotiations for cable TV here are proceeding
in the face of legal complications. A recent court ruling
that challenges the right of a municipality to franchise a
cable firm may affect the selection process.
. Further, a franchised firm will need at least 18 months
before services are available for use, according to ACIS
spokesperson Judith Trice.
Nevertheless, the City of Palo Alto, as the designated
bargaining agent for the Joint Powers — a consortium of
interests representing Stanford, Menlo Park, Atherton,
Palo Alto and East Palo Alto — is proceeding with the
task of licensing a cable firm to install and operate the new
system.
The court decision, rendered March 1 in Los Angeles
by the Federal Court of Appeals, establishes that a
municipality's awarding of an exclusive contract to one
cable firm might be in violation of First Amendment
rights of other firms capable of and interested in providing
equivalent services.

Century Federal, a local cable firm, continues to seek a
court order forcing Palo Alto and two other cities to grant
it permission to use public utility poles so it can begin con
struction of a cable system. The Joint Powers, in the
meantime, continue negotiations with Cable Communica
tions Cooperative of Palo Alto, Inc. and City Cable
Partners, Inc.
According to Harold Farrow, chief legal counsel for the
plaintiff in both cases, the issue at stake is whether "the
city has the right to displace competition in the commerce
of ideas."
In other words, any cable franchise, as an "electronic
publisher," is entitled to the same First Amendment rights
guaranteed newspapers and magazines as "print publish
ers."
But according to Anthony Bennetti, senior assistant city
attorney for Palo Alto, franchising is "a method by which
elected representatives of the people can safeguard the in
terests of the public by assuring a wide distribution of
cable services." Program selection and geography help
determine the scope of the distribution, he said.
Whatever the outcome of the legal issues, observers
agree that cable TV for Stanford and the surrounding
communities appears to be a certainty within the next few
years. Although Trice hesitates to predict an exact date
for completion, she assures that ACIS is "proceeding in
the hope that [it] will eventually bring CATV to Stan
ford".
