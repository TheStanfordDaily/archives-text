# STOP pickets hotel
## 
### SHIRISH DATE Senior staff writer 
With chants of "Stanford women are more than
bodies" and "I'm a person, not a bunny," about 20 stu
dents conducted an hour-long picket of the Palo Alto
Holiday Inn yesterday evening to protest a Playboy
photographer's stay at the hotel.
Meanwhile the photographer. David Chan, said
about 50 women called him yesterday to schedule in
terviews. "That's good for the first day,"he said.
Stanford Students Opposed to Pornography (STOP)
organized the protest to inform hotel guests of
Playboy's presence at the Holiday Inn, according to
STOP member Darby Hoover. Fliers distributed by
pickets urged hotel patrons "to take |their) concerns
regarding this issue to the hotel manager."
In addition, the flier asked patrons to boycott the

Holiday Inn if it allowed Chan to remain there. "Please
support us in our efforts â€” if Playboy continues to do
its business at the Holiday Inn, take your business else
where," it said.
Mickey Pineda, acting hotel manager, said she did
not know what the protest was about and declined to
comment further.
Chan said the protest "doesn't concern [him| one
bit," and that he was honored by "the reception"
STOP was giving him. Chan said he believed the pick
eting was "kindergarten stuff," and that women here
were inspired by protests they watched on television in
their youth.
STOP member Vanessa Poster said yesterday's
protest was organized as quickly as time allowed. "We
passed the word around as best we could," she said.

Police officer Jim Zboralske tells members of Stanford Students Opposed to Pornography to move off
Holiday Inn property in Palo Alto yesterday evening. The protesters picketed the hotel because David
Chan, who is photographing women for Playboy's "Girls of the Pac-10" pictorial, is staying there.
Hoover concurred, saying the or
ganizers were "hoping for as many
people" as would show up but not ex
pecting any particular number.
After about 20 minutes of picket
ing, Pineda asked Hoover to move
the protest from Holiday Inn's
driveway to the sidewalk. Marchers
remained on the driveway loop, and
30 minutes later, Palo Alto police of
ficer Jim Zboralske asked them to
move off Holiday Inn's "private
property." The pickets complied,
moving onto the sidewalk, and the
protest dispersed soon afterward.
Reaction to the protest was mixed.
Hotel visitor Nancy Finney, a resi
dent of Palo Alto, said she agreed
with the pickets. "I think it's won
derful that young people today are
speaking up," she said.
"I support it wholeheartedly," said
Los Altos resident Joe Ford, adding
that she could not believe Playboy
was coming to Stanford to recruit
women for its "sexist" magazine.
Hal Smith, a guest from North
Carolina, said the protest was

"hilarious" and the protesters could
have found a "more socially worthy"
cause. "It doesn't look like a very big
turnout, and it doesn't seem to be a
very important issue," he added.
But STOP members said the rally
had served its function in spite of the
attendance.
Hoover said protests in front of the
hotel would be repeated over the next
few days and added that STOP was
considering calling for a boycott
against Holiday Inn. Hotel manage
ment still has "a very good opportu
nity of asking Playboy to take [its]
business elsewhere," she said.
Holiday Inn General Manager
Daniel Rodriguez told The Daily
Tuesday he would oppose any
Playboy advertising that implied the
Holiday Inn had a "Playboy Suite" or
any attempt by Chan to photograph
women in the hotel.
An advertisement by Playboy in
yesterday's Daily told women inter
ested in posing for Playboy's "Girls of
the Pac-10" issue to call Chan at the
Holiday Inn and ask for "the Playboy
Suite."
Rodriguez was unavailable for
comment yesterday.
