# STOP pickets hotel

### SHIRISH DATE Senior staff writer 
With chants of "Stanford women are more than
bodies" and "I'm a person, not a bunny," about 20 stu
dents conducted an hour-long picket of the Palo Alto
Holiday Inn yesterday evening to protest a Playboy
photographer's stay at the hotel.
Meanwhile the photographer. David Chan, said
about 50 women called him yesterday to schedule in
terviews. "That's good for the first day,"he said.
Stanford Students Opposed to Pornography (STOP)
organized the protest to inform hotel guests of
Playboy's presence at the Holiday Inn, according to
STOP member Darby Hoover. Fliers distributed by
pickets urged hotel patrons "to take |their) concerns
regarding this issue to the hotel manager."
In addition, the flier asked patrons to boycott the

Holiday Inn if it allowed Chan to remain there. "Please
support us in our efforts â€” if Playboy continues to do
its business at the Holiday Inn, take your business else
where," it said.
Mickey Pineda, acting hotel manager, said she did
not know what the protest was about and declined to
comment further.
Chan said the protest "doesn't concern [him| one
bit," and that he was honored by "the reception"
STOP was giving him. Chan said he believed the pick
eting was "kindergarten stuff," and that women here
were inspired by protests they watched on television in
their youth.
STOP member Vanessa Poster said yesterday's
protest was organized as quickly as time allowed. "We
passed the word around as best we could," she said.

Police officer Jim Zboralske tells members of Stanford Students Opposed to Pornography to move off
Holiday Inn property in Palo Alto yesterday evening. The protesters picketed the hotel because David
Chan, who is photographing women for Playboy's "Girls of the Pac-10" pictorial, is staying there.
