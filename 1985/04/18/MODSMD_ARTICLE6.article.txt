### DAVID KISSER Senior staff writer 
BERKELEY — Chanting "Week two,
week two. UC Regents where are you?"
protesters here continued their anti-apartheid
sit-in at Sproul Hall yesterday despite the ar
rest of 159 at a demonstration Tuesday.
A crowd of about 5.000 gathered at noon
to hear speeches from students, faculty and
local and African politicians who demanded
the University of California sell its $1.7 bil
lion in investments in companies that do busi
ness in South Africa.
California Assemblywoman Maxine Waters
(D-Los Angeles), saying the UC budget must
be approved by the Assembly, promised that
she would urge fellow legislators to bring
pressure on the UC Regents to divest.
Singer Holly Near told the demonstrators:
"We are asking not just to feed Africa, but to
free Africa," then led the crowd in song.
Protesters were urging students to boycott
classes here vesterday as a demonstration of

their support for the divestment movement.
Protest organizers said the boycott was 80
percent successful.
Students and faculty members said they
were drawn to the rally, the biggest
demonstration at Berkeley since the protests
surrounding the Vietnam War. to show sup
port for the boycott, as well as to express
outrage over Tuesday's arrests.
" A lot ot professors have canceled classes,
and TAs canceled sections." according to
sophomore Hilary Flack. Another student re
ported that 12 students attended one 250-
person lecture course. "After the arrests,
something clicked," Rack said.
"The arrests really outraged people."
agreed Mia Laurence, a member of the UC
Divestment Coalition and the Campaign
Against Apartheid.
"When the university turns to arresting stu
dents. I ask: In whose interest is the university
operating? Is it serving us?" said one profes
sor at the rallv.

Alvin Kennedy, a member of Berkeley's
United People of Color, thanked the regents
and the university. "If it had not been for
their brilliance in arresting those people on
the steps, many of you would not he here
today," he told the crowd.
Most of those arrested in Tuesday's dawn
raid were released the same day. About 30 of
the arrestees were not released until yester
day afternoon because they identified them
selves to police only as "Stephen Biko," the
martyred anti-apartheid black South African.
Protesters have renamed Sproul Hall
"Stephen Biko Hall."
Brent Chadwick was among those arrested
on Tuesday. "I decided to go limp, and they
dragged me out." he said. Chadwick identi
fied himself as Stephen Biko and w as released
13 hours later, when he told police his real
name.
Some protesters alleged that police used
choke-holds while making arrests and

slammed one man's head against the steps at
Sproul.
"We didn't use a choke-hold on anyone,"
said Calvin Handy, public information officer
for the UC-Berkeley police. "We made every
effort to carry people as safely as possible."
Handy said 30 demonstrators offered viol
ent resistance to arrest, but that "outside of
those groups, there is a spirit of cooperation
here."
The police department is "in communica
tion with leaders (of the sit-in) to coexist in a
proper way." according to Handy. "The lead
ership seems to promote non-violence, and
the responsible student senate is also doing
that."
A group of student senators was arrested
Tuesday when it blocked the entrance to Uni
versity Hall.
Handy said yesterday that the police had
not been mobilized for any additional arrests
because there was less evidence of "lodging"
on the Sproul Hall steps.

"There was nothing (Tuesday) night to the
extent of the nights preceding the arrests," he
said. Monday night there was "heavy material
indication" that people were lodging at
Sproul, according to Handy. "We moved out
several truckloads of living equipment," he
said.
A few hundred demonstrators left Sproul at
2 p.m. to march to a courthouse in downtown
Berkeley, where the arraignment of some of
those arrested was scheduled.
Tom Dcbley, a university spokesman, told
The Daily that those students arrested may
also he subject to disciplinary proceedings if
the Student Activities Office believes that the
students have violated university rules. In
such cases, the vice chancellor decides on any
disciplinary action, which may range from a
written warning to dismissal.
"I don't see anything in this situation where
(dismissal) would happen," Dcbley said.
"There is a history of dissent on
this campus, a history where political
expression is an important part of the
educational process," Debley said.
"The question is, can you allow
anybody to do anything at any time?
That's the issue that arose in the '60s.
To not allow political expression out
there is wrong."
The present system aims for
"maximum expression of political
viewpoints with minimal obstruction
to the operation of the university,"
Debley said.
If arrests are to be made again, the
university will formally notify the
protesters and "give them an oppor
tunity to change their tactics," ac
cording to Debley. Those arrested
Tuesday were given time to leave if
they did not wish to be arrested.
In addition to the sit-in and
boycott, yesterday's protest included
a teach-in and a study-in held at the

student union.
"It is on this day that I am proudest
to be a part of this university," said
Prof. Ken Simmons, who had can
celed his classes. "My heart swells
with pride and gratitude," he added
as thousands cheered and rose to
their feet. Troy Duster, president
of the Black Faculty and* Staff Associ
ation, brought word that the "black
staff and faculty are in support of this
sit-in and the boycott."
An exiled member of the Pan-
African Congress voiced his support
of the sit-in, telling the crowd that
black South Africans do not want
U.S. companies to investment in
South Africa. "The UC and U.S. im
perialist system has . . . kept our
people in bondage," he said.
Mario Savio, the leader of the Free
Speech Movement that began here 20
years ago, spoke Tuesday and yester
day, stressing that the connection to
protests in the 1960s was a common
theme.
"For those reminiscing in the '60s,
the year 2000 is almost here — we

want change now," Kennedy said.
There was also a great deal of talk
of solidarity with the on-going protest
at Columbia University and the
demonstrations at UC-Santa Cruz
and Rutgers. Hundreds of the
protesters at Berkeley have signed an
open letter of solidarity, to be sent to
the sit-in at Columbia.
Berkeley has agreed to the
protesters' demand for a public
forum, which will be held on April
24. The demonstrators are also ask
ing that the regents consider divest
ment at their May meeting in
Berkeley, rather than at the June
meeting in Santa Cruz.
There are no classes at Berkeley
until Monday, but leaders here are
confident the protest will last over the
vacation weekend. As the sun set on
the eighth day of the sit-in, 250
demonstrators prepared to spend the
night.
Today, Assemblyman Willie
Brown is expected to speak, and
hundreds of longshoremen will join
the protest.

name.
Some protesters alleged that police used
choke-holds while making arrests and

slammed one man's head against the steps at
Sproul.
"We didn't use a choke-hold on anyone,"
said Calvin Handy, public information officer
for the UC-Berkeley police. "We made every
effort to carry people as safely as possible."
Handy said 30 demonstrators offered viol
ent resistance to arrest, but that "outside of
those groups, there is a spirit of cooperation
here."
The police department is "in communica
tion with leaders (of the sit-in) to coexist in a
proper way." according to Handy. "The lead
ership seems to promote non-violence, and
the responsible student senate is also doing
that."
A group of student senators was arrested
Tuesday when it blocked the entrance to Uni
versity Hall.
Handy said yesterday that the police had
not been mobilized for any additional arrests
because there was less evidence of "lodging"
on the Sproul Hall steps.

"There was nothing (Tuesday) night to the
extent of the nights preceding the arrests," he
said. Monday night there was "heavy material
indication" that people were lodging at
Sproul, according to Handy. "We moved out
several truckloads of living equipment," he
said.
A few hundred demonstrators left Sproul at
2 p.m. to march to a courthouse in downtown
Berkeley, where the arraignment of some of
those arrested was scheduled.
Tom Dcbley, a university spokesman, told
The Daily that those students arrested may
also he subject to disciplinary proceedings if
the Student Activities Office believes that the
students have violated university rules. In
such cases, the vice chancellor decides on any
disciplinary action, which may range from a
written warning to dismissal.
"I don't see anything in this situation where
(dismissal) would happen," Dcbley said.
"There is a history of dissent on
this campus, a history where political
expression is an important part of the
educational process," Debley said.
"The question is, can you allow
anybody to do anything at any time?
That's the issue that arose in the '60s.
To not allow political expression out
there is wrong."
The present system aims for
"maximum expression of political
viewpoints with minimal obstruction
to the operation of the university,"
Debley said.
If arrests are to be made again, the
university will formally notify the
protesters and "give them an oppor
tunity to change their tactics," ac
cording to Debley. Those arrested
Tuesday were given time to leave if
they did not wish to be arrested.
In addition to the sit-in and
boycott, yesterday's protest included
a teach-in and a study-in held at the

student union.
"It is on this day that I am proudest
to be a part of this university," said
Prof. Ken Simmons, who had can
celed his classes. "My heart swells
with pride and gratitude," he added
as thousands cheered and rose to
their feet. Troy Duster, president
of the Black Faculty and* Staff Associ
ation, brought word that the "black
staff and faculty are in support of this
sit-in and the boycott."
An exiled member of the Pan-
African Congress voiced his support
of the sit-in, telling the crowd that
black South Africans do not want
U.S. companies to investment in
South Africa. "The UC and U.S. im
perialist system has . . . kept our
people in bondage," he said.
Mario Savio, the leader of the Free
Speech Movement that began here 20
years ago, spoke Tuesday and yester
day, stressing that the connection to
protests in the 1960s was a common
theme.
"For those reminiscing in the '60s,
the year 2000 is almost here — we

want change now," Kennedy said.
There was also a great deal of talk
of solidarity with the on-going protest
at Columbia University and the
demonstrations at UC-Santa Cruz
and Rutgers. Hundreds of the
protesters at Berkeley have signed an
open letter of solidarity, to be sent to
the sit-in at Columbia.
Berkeley has agreed to the
protesters' demand for a public
forum, which will be held on April
24. The demonstrators are also ask
ing that the regents consider divest
ment at their May meeting in
Berkeley, rather than at the June
meeting in Santa Cruz.
There are no classes at Berkeley
until Monday, but leaders here are
confident the protest will last over the
vacation weekend. As the sun set on
the eighth day of the sit-in, 250
demonstrators prepared to spend the
night.
Today, Assemblyman Willie
Brown is expected to speak, and
hundreds of longshoremen will join
the protest.
BERKELEY — Chanting "Week two,
week two. UC Regents where are you?"
protesters here continued their anti-apartheid
sit-in at Sproul Hall yesterday despite the ar
rest of 159 at a demonstration Tuesday.
A crowd of about 5.000 gathered at noon
to hear speeches from students, faculty and
local and African politicians who demanded
the University of California sell its $1.7 bil
lion in investments in companies that do busi
ness in South Africa.
California Assemblywoman Maxine Waters
(D-Los Angeles), saying the UC budget must
be approved by the Assembly, promised that
she would urge fellow legislators to bring
pressure on the UC Regents to divest.
Singer Holly Near told the demonstrators:
"We are asking not just to feed Africa, but to
free Africa," then led the crowd in song.
Protesters were urging students to boycott
classes here vesterday as a demonstration of

their support for the divestment movement.
Protest organizers said the boycott was 80
percent successful.
Students and faculty members said they
were drawn to the rally, the biggest
demonstration at Berkeley since the protests
surrounding the Vietnam War. to show sup
port for the boycott, as well as to express
outrage over Tuesday's arrests.
" A lot ot professors have canceled classes,
and TAs canceled sections." according to
sophomore Hilary Flack. Another student re
ported that 12 students attended one 250-
person lecture course. "After the arrests,
something clicked," Rack said.
"The arrests really outraged people."
agreed Mia Laurence, a member of the UC
Divestment Coalition and the Campaign
Against Apartheid.
"When the university turns to arresting stu
dents. I ask: In whose interest is the university
operating? Is it serving us?" said one profes
sor at the rallv.

Alvin Kennedy, a member of Berkeley's
United People of Color, thanked the regents
and the university. "If it had not been for
their brilliance in arresting those people on
the steps, many of you would not he here
today," he told the crowd.
Most of those arrested in Tuesday's dawn
raid were released the same day. About 30 of
the arrestees were not released until yester
day afternoon because they identified them
selves to police only as "Stephen Biko," the
martyred anti-apartheid black South African.
Protesters have renamed Sproul Hall
"Stephen Biko Hall."
Brent Chadwick was among those arrested
on Tuesday. "I decided to go limp, and they
dragged me out." he said. Chadwick identi
fied himself as Stephen Biko and w as released
13 hours later, when he told police his real
name.
