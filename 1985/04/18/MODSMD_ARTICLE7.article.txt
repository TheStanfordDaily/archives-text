Demos to propose Nicaragua plan
WASHINGTON — House Speaker Thomas O'Neill said yesterday
that Democrats are considering a proposal for Red Cross refugee assis
tance to Central America as an alternative to President Reagan's plan to
release $14 million for the "Contra" guerrillas fighting in Nicaragua.
The House will vote next Tuesday or Wednesday on Reagan's Contra
aid proposal, and O'Neill said a count of Democrats shows the plan will
be defeated.
And in the Senate, sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said
Republican leaders were looking for a way to sidestejf any showdown
vote at all.
A proposal under discussion by Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), chair
man of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Sen. David Durenberger
(R-Minn.), chairman of the Intelligence Committee, would call for a
statement of support for the Contras, but end all military assistance.
But Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) said he believes the $14
million will be approved without change.
"I think we can approve it as is," said Dole. The Senate is to vote next
week.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes said Reagan would keep up
lobbying efforts on behalf of his Contra proposal by inviting 20 to 25
wavering members of Congress to talk about it.
With the rhetoric intensifying as the votes neared, O'Neill said he
believes Reagan's ultimate goal is to dispatch U.S. military forces to
Central America.
"I don't believe the president of the United States will be happy until
troops are in there," the Massachusetts Democrat said.
FBI chief defends contacts
WASHINGTON — FBI Director William Webster said yesterday
that his agents have interviewed some 100 travelers to and from
Nicaragua, but insisted the contacts were not a return to political abuses
of the past.
His assurances did not satisfy Democratic members of the House
Judiciary subcommittee on civil rights, who said their constituents com
plained to them about the contacts.
Webster said "in the area of 100, possibly less than 100" travelers
were contacted, and he added: "I can assure you there was a legitimate
counterintelligence purpose for every interview."
Rep. Don Edwards (D-Calif.), the panel's chairman, told Webster,
"There are a lot of people in the executive department who would like to
enlist the CIA or FBI on its side" in the government's opposition to the
Nicaraguan regime.
Referring to the Nixon administration's political use of the FBI, Ed
wards commented: "There have been terrible things that have happened
in the United States in the name of national security."
Edwards and Democratic Reps. John Conyers of Michigan, Robert
Kasienmeier of Wisconsin and Patricia Schroeder of Colorado said those
who complained to them were extremely upset and felt they were
harassed.
Schroeder said in Denver, a woman identifying herself as from
the Department of Defense Investigative Service contacted several
people including one of the congresswoman's staffers.
The investigator asked questions about an ecumenical church service
held March 24 to honor the memory of Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo
Romero y Galdamez of El Salvador, who was assassinated on that date
four years earlier, Schroeder's office said.
Cemetery visit faces opposition
WASHINGTON — Fifty-three senators yesterday criticized Presi
dent Reagan's plan to visit a German military cemetery where some
Nazi soldiers are buried and urged him to find "a more appropriate
gesture of reconciliation."
Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) released a copy of a letter to
Reagan signed by the senators from both parties. The letter, dated April
15, said the president "should not honor soldiers who fell in defense of
the Third Reich and its many atrocities."
The president has said he plans to visit the cemetery at Bitburg as a
gesture of solidarity with the West German government, a key U.S. ally.
The senators noted that many of those interred at the cemetery were
killed during the 1944 Battle of the Bulge, a German assault which led
to 81,000 U.S. casualties, including 19,000 dead.
"Given the bitterness of the Battle of the Bulge, the atrocities it en
tailed, and the massive participation of the SS, we believe that a visit to
Bitburg by an American president would be most unfortunate. We sug
gest that a more appropriate gesture of reconciliation by found," the let
ter said.
It a'io urged Reagan to memorialize "the innocent victims of the Nazi
Holocaust."
White House aides were searching yesterday for a concentration camp
site Reagan can visit during his May 1-6 trip and were expecting a deci
sion later in the week.
A Reagan visit to a concentration camp site would be added to the
scheduled ceremony at Bitburg. Veterans and Jewish groups angry over
the cemetery visit, which was announced last week, have not been mol
lified by the decision disclosed by Reagan on Tuesday to add a stop at a
camp.
Palestine role dominates talk
WASHINGTON— Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid and Presi
dent Reagan met yesterday in a session that was dominated by the issue
of the Palestinian role in the Middle East and described as "another pos
itive, small c 'ep" toward peace in that region.
.ne conversation about the Middle East peace process dealt
with the role of the Palestinians," a senior administration official told
reporters, speaking on condition that he not be identified. "We and the
Algerians both suspected this was going to be very high on our agenda."
The official declined to say whether Bendjedid, who met recently with
Jordan's King Hussein and received a Jordanian-Palestinian delegation
just before leaving for the United States, brought with him any message
from the Hussein.
Asked whether the Reagan-Bendjedid talks brought peace closer in
the Middle East, the official said. "It's a long road and I think we have
taken another positive, small step."
Vatican: no support for Contra aid
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, battling to win next week's
vote in Congress for $14 million to aid rebels fighting the leftist govern
ment of Nicaragua, claimed yesterday that he has Pope John Paul ll's
support for all U.S. activities in Central America, but the Vatican em
bassy disputed him.
Reagan's claim was in contrast with comments by White House
spokesman Larry Speakes, who said the pope has not endorsed the pres
ident's plan to aid the guerrillas. But Speakes refused to say that the
president had incorrectly interpreted the papal message.
Later, a statement by the Apostolic Nunciature, f he Vatican's em
bassy in Washington, stressed that the pope has not endorsed "any con
crete plan dealing, in particular, with military aspects."
On Tuesday, Reagan announced that he had just received a "verbal
message . . . from the pope urging us to continue our efforts in Central
America."
During a picture-taking session yesterday with Algerian President
Chadli Bendjedid, Reagan was asked if the pope had expressed support
for U.S. aid to Nicaraguan guerrillas.
"You know, 1 am not supposed to answer questions here, but he has
been most supportive of all of our activities in Central America,"
Reagan said.
The president was then asked whether the pontiff specifically sup
ported military aid to the rebels.
"I'm not going into detail, but all our activities," Reagan replied. He
declined to answer any other questions.
Earlier. Speakes. when asked about the papal message, said it was not
an endorsement of the president's call for $14 million to aid the rebels.

"Given the bitterness of the Battle of the Bulge, the atrocities it en
tailed, and the massive participation of the SS, we believe that a visit to
Bitburg by an American president would be most unfortunate. We sug
gest that a more appropriate gesture of reconciliation by found," the let
ter said.
It a'io urged Reagan to memorialize "the innocent victims of the Nazi
Holocaust."
White House aides were searching yesterday for a concentration camp
site Reagan can visit during his May 1-6 trip and were expecting a deci
sion later in the week.
A Reagan visit to a concentration camp site would be added to the
scheduled ceremony at Bitburg. Veterans and Jewish groups angry over
the cemetery visit, which was announced last week, have not been mol
lified by the decision disclosed by Reagan on Tuesday to add a stop at a
camp.
Palestine role dominates talk
WASHINGTON— Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid and Presi
dent Reagan met yesterday in a session that was dominated by the issue
of the Palestinian role in the Middle East and described as "another pos
itive, small c 'ep" toward peace in that region.
.ne conversation about the Middle East peace process dealt
with the role of the Palestinians," a senior administration official told
reporters, speaking on condition that he not be identified. "We and the
Algerians both suspected this was going to be very high on our agenda."
The official declined to say whether Bendjedid, who met recently with
Jordan's King Hussein and received a Jordanian-Palestinian delegation
just before leaving for the United States, brought with him any message
from the Hussein.
Asked whether the Reagan-Bendjedid talks brought peace closer in
the Middle East, the official said. "It's a long road and I think we have
taken another positive, small step."
Vatican: no support for Contra aid
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, battling to win next week's
vote in Congress for $14 million to aid rebels fighting the leftist govern
ment of Nicaragua, claimed yesterday that he has Pope John Paul ll's
support for all U.S. activities in Central America, but the Vatican em
bassy disputed him.
Reagan's claim was in contrast with comments by White House
spokesman Larry Speakes, who said the pope has not endorsed the pres
ident's plan to aid the guerrillas. But Speakes refused to say that the
president had incorrectly interpreted the papal message.
Later, a statement by the Apostolic Nunciature, f he Vatican's em
bassy in Washington, stressed that the pope has not endorsed "any con
crete plan dealing, in particular, with military aspects."
On Tuesday, Reagan announced that he had just received a "verbal
message . . . from the pope urging us to continue our efforts in Central
America."
During a picture-taking session yesterday with Algerian President
Chadli Bendjedid, Reagan was asked if the pope had expressed support
for U.S. aid to Nicaraguan guerrillas.
"You know, 1 am not supposed to answer questions here, but he has
been most supportive of all of our activities in Central America,"
Reagan said.
The president was then asked whether the pontiff specifically sup
ported military aid to the rebels.
"I'm not going into detail, but all our activities," Reagan replied. He
declined to answer any other questions.
Earlier. Speakes. when asked about the papal message, said it was not
an endorsement of the president's call for $14 million to aid the rebels.
Demos to propose Nicaragua plan
WASHINGTON — House Speaker Thomas O'Neill said yesterday
that Democrats are considering a proposal for Red Cross refugee assis
tance to Central America as an alternative to President Reagan's plan to
release $14 million for the "Contra" guerrillas fighting in Nicaragua.
The House will vote next Tuesday or Wednesday on Reagan's Contra
aid proposal, and O'Neill said a count of Democrats shows the plan will
be defeated.
And in the Senate, sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said
Republican leaders were looking for a way to sidestejf any showdown
vote at all.
A proposal under discussion by Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), chair
man of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Sen. David Durenberger
(R-Minn.), chairman of the Intelligence Committee, would call for a
statement of support for the Contras, but end all military assistance.
But Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) said he believes the $14
million will be approved without change.
"I think we can approve it as is," said Dole. The Senate is to vote next
week.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes said Reagan would keep up
lobbying efforts on behalf of his Contra proposal by inviting 20 to 25
wavering members of Congress to talk about it.
With the rhetoric intensifying as the votes neared, O'Neill said he
believes Reagan's ultimate goal is to dispatch U.S. military forces to
Central America.
"I don't believe the president of the United States will be happy until
troops are in there," the Massachusetts Democrat said.
FBI chief defends contacts
WASHINGTON — FBI Director William Webster said yesterday
that his agents have interviewed some 100 travelers to and from
Nicaragua, but insisted the contacts were not a return to political abuses
of the past.
His assurances did not satisfy Democratic members of the House
Judiciary subcommittee on civil rights, who said their constituents com
plained to them about the contacts.
Webster said "in the area of 100, possibly less than 100" travelers
were contacted, and he added: "I can assure you there was a legitimate
counterintelligence purpose for every interview."
Rep. Don Edwards (D-Calif.), the panel's chairman, told Webster,
"There are a lot of people in the executive department who would like to
enlist the CIA or FBI on its side" in the government's opposition to the
Nicaraguan regime.
Referring to the Nixon administration's political use of the FBI, Ed
wards commented: "There have been terrible things that have happened
in the United States in the name of national security."
Edwards and Democratic Reps. John Conyers of Michigan, Robert
Kasienmeier of Wisconsin and Patricia Schroeder of Colorado said those
who complained to them were extremely upset and felt they were
harassed.
Schroeder said in Denver, a woman identifying herself as from
the Department of Defense Investigative Service contacted several
people including one of the congresswoman's staffers.
The investigator asked questions about an ecumenical church service
held March 24 to honor the memory of Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo
Romero y Galdamez of El Salvador, who was assassinated on that date
four years earlier, Schroeder's office said.
Cemetery visit faces opposition
WASHINGTON — Fifty-three senators yesterday criticized Presi
dent Reagan's plan to visit a German military cemetery where some
Nazi soldiers are buried and urged him to find "a more appropriate
gesture of reconciliation."
Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) released a copy of a letter to
Reagan signed by the senators from both parties. The letter, dated April
15, said the president "should not honor soldiers who fell in defense of
the Third Reich and its many atrocities."
The president has said he plans to visit the cemetery at Bitburg as a
gesture of solidarity with the West German government, a key U.S. ally.
The senators noted that many of those interred at the cemetery were
killed during the 1944 Battle of the Bulge, a German assault which led
to 81,000 U.S. casualties, including 19,000 dead.
