# Lebanese government resigns

### 
BEIRUT, Lebanon — The government resigned
yesterday in the face of what Prime Minister Ras
hid Karami called "a horrific nightmare" — a
savage house-to-house battle between rival militias
for control of Moslem west Beirut. At least 29
people were reported killed and 120 wounded in
the worst fighting in Beirut in more than a year.
The battle capped three weeks of factional combat,
centered first in the southern port of Sidon, in
which well over 100 people have died.
Fighting between Moslems and Christians in
Sidon was in its 20th day yesterday. The death toll
there stood at 83.
"What has happened is a horrific nightmare,"
said Karami, a 63-year-old Sunni Moslem. He
agreed to lead a "national unity" government a
year ago to support the efforts of President Amin
Gemayel to unify the country.
The battle swirled around the Canadian Embassy
in west Beirut's main shopping district. Diplomatic
sources said staff members would remain on duty,
but their families were being evacuated to the
Christian port of Jounieh north of the capital.
Karami said Amal's crackdown on the
Mourabitoun, its former companion in battle

against Christian warlords, was "colossally danger
ous."
"No one can justify what is happening in our
capital, Beirut," he told the 4 million people of his
fragmented nation in a five-minute radio address.
"To apologize to you, brothers, for what has
happened, I tender to you and to Beirut the resig
nation of the national unity Cabinet," he said.
The prime minister then telephoned his resigna
tion to Gemayel in suburban Baabda. Local radio
stations said the president asked Karami to stay on
as caretaker until a new government can be
formed.
The Amal-Mourabitoun fighting began at dusk
Tuesday when Mourabitoun fighters tried to open
an office in a west Beirut residential neighborhood
in defiance of A ma I.
Jumblatt, the Druse warlord, joined his militia
w>th Amal in night-long machine gun and rocket
duels that spread throughout the Moslem sector.
The Shiite and Druse allies drove Mourabitoun
fighters from their headquarters in the Corniche
Mazraa by yesterday, using rocket-propelled
grenades and jeep-mounted 106 mm recoiless
rifles. They ransacked and burned the

headquarters.
Much of the headquarters battle raged around
the Gamal Abdel Nasser mosque. About 2,000
children, some of them handicapped, were trapped
in a nearby orphanage that was riddled by gunfire. ;
The orphanage director, Meriland Akkad, said
the children, aged between one and 16, were
"terrified, crying and screaming," but none was
hurt.
In Washington, State Department spokesmap
Bernard Kalb said the resignation "comes at an
untimely moment. The United States deeply
regrets the bloodshed that has occurred in west
Beirut."
Karami's resignation signals yet another political
crisis in Lebanon, which is occupied by Syria in the
east, Israel in the south and is under local control
elsewhere by warlords rather than the central gov
ernment.
As the prime minister announced his resignation,
Israeli warplanes made their sixth attack in
Lebanon this year. The military command in Tel
Aviv said its jets bombed a Palestinian guerrilla
base northwest of the Bekaa Valley town of Barr
Elias, scoring direct hits.
