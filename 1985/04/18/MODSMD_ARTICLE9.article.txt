# Shuttle's satellite rescue try fails
## 
### 
CAPE CANAVERAL â€” AH the
planning, rehearsal and makeshift
tools went for naught yesterday, as
Discovery's astronauts failed to
awaken a sleeping $85 million
satellite and had to abandon it as use
less space junk.
The effort concentrated on bring
ing the space shuttle close and tug
ging on a lever suspected of causing a
total power failure on the Syncom
satellite. That was done, but still the
satellite did not respond.
Astronaut Margaret Rhea Seddon
twice brushed the shuttle's mechani
cal crane against the satellite and hit
the master switch with a handcrafted
"flyswatter" tool.
"We have now proven it wasn't the
lever arm," an official said later.

Seddon had only six minutes to ac
complish the task, because after that
the satellite could not be positioned
properly for its mission to provide
Navy communications. When the
period was up, Mission Control or
dered the shuttle to leave.
The satellite will continue its un
productive drift around the earth for
years. Officials said it was premature
to talk about retrieving it, the way
two earlier failed satellites were
brought home by a shuttle crew.
"There are more problems associ
ated with recovery of this satellite
than there were with Palapa and
Westar," said Steven Dorfman, presi
dent and chief executive officer of
Hughes Communications, which
owns Syncom. "Obviously a rendez

vous and rescue mission on a subse
quent launch is a possibility."
The Syncom satellite is loaded with
nearly four tons of hydrazine fuel.
The fuel on the other two satellites,
both built by Hughes, had been
depleted before astronauts got near
them.
NASA devised the rendezvous as
suming that the lever had failed to
open fully during the satellite's
deployment from the shuttle Satur
day, preventing the flow of electrial
power that would send the craft to
higher orbit.
Discovery's commander, Karol
Bobko, expressed the crew's disap
pointment.
"We wish that the problem that we
fixed was the problem that was re

sponsible for the Syncom not getting
activated," he said. "I guess people
will have to do some more work on
that."
Hughes paid NASA $18 million for
the launch and will reimburse the
agency for the intensive repair effort
that included hundreds of experts
constructing mockups, rehearsing
procedures, working out a complex
rendezvous. Dorfman said the next
Syncom won't be launched in August
as scheduled unless engineers haVe
confidence it will work properly. 1
The shuttle's work done, Bobko
was given the choice of landing at the
Kennedy Space Center today or to
morrow morning.
"We'd just as soon stay up for an
extra day,"he said.
