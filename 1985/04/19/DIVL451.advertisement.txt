Dear Mr. Leight
In March of 1386 I will graduate from Stanford University with a B. S.
in Industrial Engineering and a B.fi. in Management Engineering. fit
that time I will be seeking a full-time internship in sales, marketing,
finance, and property management. I hope to gain good practical
experience, and I also feel my coursework (and excellent academic
record) plus my interest in Real Estate would be of value to your firm.
I further aspire to demonstrate consistency, creativity and competence
that would prove my value in permanent employment with Leight Realty.
I became aware of opportunities at your firm during my search of Tucson
Real Estate companies, fifter careful thought and co/isideration, I
surmised that job experience is among the best at Leight Realty.
fis the enclosed resume indicates, I have completed a wide array of
course work related not only to Industrial Engineering, but to
economics, finance, PflSCfiL and Real Estate as well. My Management
Engineering degree emphasizes economics, with a broad background in
managerial psychology, writing, and finance.
Please feel free to contact me should you desire additional
information. I will be calling you before April £5 concerning the
status of my resume.
II am convinced that rny knowledge of the Tucson area (I have lived in
j t Tucson for the past £1 years) plus my current Arizona Real Estate
License and creative, high-energy work ability, will form a valuable
addition to your firm.
Your time and consideration in reviewing my qualifications is greatly
appreciated. I look forward to talking with you.
Sincerely,
