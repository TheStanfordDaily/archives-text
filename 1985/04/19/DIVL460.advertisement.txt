WELL? COME,

WAY TO EASY
IFYOUTOS, Notolcl
Ken Kesey YOURPART, Seems
So Who Fuckin' Cares? Yet-ls-Not
Now, Ido, ACT
My Dearest Mr. KEN KESEY:
I LAWRENCE MORRIS LEIGHT, and various other students of Stanford
University, have decided to keep the BRAIN TRUST (Brain Trust, or brain trust, [OR:
Project: Brain Trust ★]) as co-ordinated in years previous. |We fully do recognize that
project synthesis is to be carried TO COMPLETION!).
Now: Your CO-ORDINATOR — you already know it. This is your place in...
Continue as before: Lectures, slide shows, campus advertisements, etc., and begin
your American Tour with Stanford. It will be the media extravaganza. The materials,
as I know, have been kept — TB, for example — pending the reissueance.
Begin reorganization. Contact me, and others, in class at Stanford University.
Dress: As Appropriate. Suggestion: As befits the contribution to the Inevitable
Occurance. I am one smoothly dressed businessman, appearantly possibly armed,
PLUS one smartly dressed woman, a business executive, PLUS a sexy model and a
sandled "Groupie." And more. Add more! [use your imagination.] You will find that
there is nothing that I cannot co-generate.
There is no more to say, except that this entire letter is an exercise in
pre-cognitive synthesis, i.e., presumptuousness, and is difinitively not meant as
(YOUR DECISION) unetete sortee.
Not at all sincerely yours,
Give me a break! Read the envelope!
Stanford (of course University)
An Industrial Engineer
PS: Absolutely no, and I want to make this perfectly clear, Absolutely NO
enclosures. The color of the day si: black, grey, green and orange; red, green,
blue and Yellow-Like-The-Sun. Yes! It's true!
* Brain Trust, your PROJECT CO-ORDINATOR.
