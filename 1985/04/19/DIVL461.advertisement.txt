I—THERE ARE NO
BUNNIES ON THIS
FARM!
We are not bunnies, we are not for the
ENTERTAINMENT OF MEN, we are not
"girls" of the Pac-10, we are not commercial
products.
We are women. We are Stanford students. We are proud of
these two facts, because we work hard and deserve respect.
We the women (and men) of this university are proud to say
"NO!" to PLAYBOY. Stanford is proud to set the standard
among the Pac-10 by refusing to cooperate with PLAYBOY
enterprises. We will continue to say NO, people are taking
notice of us.
They will begin saying no as well, and YOU will have
helped to create a positive difference in our society. Together,
we can help fight PLAYBOY, and the attitudes it dictates to all of
us.
SAY MO
TO PLAYBOY.
