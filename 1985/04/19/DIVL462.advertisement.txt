COLD SORES, FEVER BLISTERS, or HERPES?
Persons suffering from recurring cold sores or fever blisters of the
lips, face, arms, legs, or body (not genitals) are urgently sought
as participants in experiments aimed at determining the reasons
for these recurrences (and which may lead to a vaccine against
the virus). Volunteers will be paid a fee for participation. For
further information, please contact:
JOHN W. TORSETH, M.D.
Division of Infectious Diseases, Stanford School of Medicine,
497-5909 between 8:30 and 12:00.
