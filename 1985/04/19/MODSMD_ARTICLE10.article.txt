Bitburg visit defended
WASHINGTON — President Reagan yester
day defended his planned visit to lay a wreath at a
German cemetery where Nazi soldiers are
buried, saying those soldiers were victims of
Nazism "just as surely as the victims of the con
centration camps."
Canceling the visit to the military cemetery at
Bitburg during his 10-day European trip next
month would "leave me looking as if I had caved
in in the face of some unfavorable attention,"
Reagan said. "I think that there's nothing wrong
with visiting that cementery where those young
men are victims of Nazism also, even though they
were fighting in the German uniform, drafted
into service to carry out the hateful wishes of the
Nazis."
During a question-and-answer session with
editors and broadcasters invited to a White
House luncheon, Reagan acknowledged that
about 30 of the graves in the cemetery are those
of SS troops, whom he described as "the villains
. . . who conducted the persecutions and all."
"But there're 2,000 graves there," Reagan
said, "and most of those — the average age is
about 18. These are those young teenagers that
were conscripted, forced into military service in

the closing days of the Third Reich when they
were short of manpower."
"We're the victor, and they're there," the pres
ident added, "and it seemed to me that this could
be symbolic also of saying .. . this should never
happen again."
Landlord burns tenant
WASHINGTON — A woman was burned to
death by gasoline in her front yard yesterday
during a landlord-tenant dispute in which the
woman's sister was shot to death and her mother
wounded, police and witnesses said.
"He had a double-barrelled shotgun and was
shooting everywhere," witness Tanya Burton
said. "He went in the house, shot her, dragged
her out, threw the stuff (gasoline) on her . . . laid
her flat on the ground and hollered, 'Don't you
move,' and the next thing you know she went up
in flames."
Firefighters arriving on the scene extinguished
the body of Darrenna Shelton, 25. Police said she
was pronounced dead on the scene.
Shelton's sister, Sabrina Shelton, 28, was
pronounced dead several hours after the 3 p.m.

incident at the Washington Hospital Center.
Police said she had been shot twice.
Their mother, Gloria Shelton, 54, was released
following treatment for abrasions caused by
gunfire, hospital spokesman Joe Daniels said.
Darrenna Shelton's landlord, Francois
Bourgeau, 48, of Mount Rainier, Md., was
charged with murder in the case, police spokes
man Wendell Samuels said. Bourgeau was sched
uled for arraignment today in D.C. Superior
Court.
Stock advance fades
Stock prices gave ground yesterday after an
early advance faded, ending a stretch of seven
consecutive gains for the Dow Jones industrial
average.
Analysts said the positive implications of fall
ing interest rates were offset by concern about a
slowing economy.
Dow Jones's average of 30 blue chips, up
19.33 points over the past seven sessions, fell
back 7.18 to 1,265.13.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
reached 100.64 million shares, up from 96.02
million Wednesday.
