Senate chastises Reagan
SACRAMENTO — The state Senate
chastised President Reagan yesterday for his
planned visit to a German cemetery containing
the bodies of Nazi SS members, declaring that his
decision to lay a wreath there encourages neo-
Nazi groups in the United States.
The visit to the cemetery at Bithurg, a south
western German town of 25,000, is scheduled
during Reagan's European trip of May 1-6.
"I'm concerned about the symbol of an Ameri
can president going to a cemetery in Germany
. .. where the bodies of Nazis are buried," said
Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles). "There are
no redeeming features in that."
The Senate voted 26-0 to adopt SJR2I, a
resolution authored by Sen. David Roberti (D-
Los Angeles). The measure went to the Assem
bly.
Child sex law challenged
SACRAMENTO — A Stockton clinic has
appealed a court order that doctors report as
child abuse all sexual activity by children under

14, even if the children consent.
The Stockton Pregnancy Control Medical
Clinic claims that the Legislature did not intend
to include all sexual activity by children under 14
when it passed the reporting law, and that the
reporting would discourage sexually active teen
agers from seeking medical help.
But San Joaquin County District Attorney
Richard Eichenberger says that legally, a child
under 14 cannot give consent and all cases should
be reported to help catch child molesters.
The court documents say a 13-year-old preg
nant girl and her mother went to the clinic in Jan
uary and said the girl had had sex with a
21-year-old man. The clinic did not report the
case. The mother went to the police the next
month. Investigators contacted clinic doctors and
nurses, who said they did not report the case be
cause there was no crime.
7 smugglers plead guilty
SAN FRANCISCO — Seven men have
pleaded guilty in connection with a 10,900-
pound shipment of hashish that was smuggled
from the Middle East to Oakland last May, the

U.S. attorney's office said yesterday.
Authorities said the drug was found hidden in
cotton bales that were shipped from Fujairah in
the United Arab Emirates. The Drug Enforce
ment Administration said it was the largest
known seizure of hashish on the West Coast. Es
timates of its value have ranged from $34.9 mil
lion to $50 million.
U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello said
customs agents searched the cotton because it fit
a "profile" of suspicious shipments that was
developed for a period of steppcd-up inspections.
Officers said they removed the hashish, replaced
the cotton, and arranged a bogus delivery of the
drug for $100,000 that led to the arrests last Au
gust.
Today's weather
It will be mostly cloudy today, with a chance of
showers and highs in the mid-50s to mid-60s.
Winds will be northwesterly at 10-20 mph.
Tonight's lows will be in the upper 30s to near
50. There will be continued cloudiness and a
chance of rain tomorrow.
