## Stanford faces demand for affordable housing 
### AMY BIRD 
The high housing prices in Palo
Alto and the other communities sur
rounding Stanford strain the imagina
tion, but they are evidence of this
area's tremendous popularity. No one
can deny that the University, with its
cultural offerings and its part in the
development of Silicon Valley, has
played a significant role in making the
Mid-Peninsula so popular.
But Stanford is an institution
whose continued vitality depends on
its ability to attract and sustain a
diverse faculty, staff and student
body. More so now than ever, admi
nistrators face the task of ensuring
that high housing prices don't scare
off the people on whom Stanford's
future depends.
Charles Holloway, associate dean
of the Graduate School of Business
and chairman of the decanal sub
committee for faculty housing, said
that the University began seeing the
impact of increasing housing prices in
the mid-70s, and that by 1980 it had
become clear that Stanford was "in
trouble."
Many entry-level assistant profes
sors declined the positions for which
they had been recruited because they
simply couldn't afford to live in the
area, and many established scholars
and experts didn't find Stanford's
allure enough to offset the fact that
the market value of a luxurious home
in the Midwest might easily be less
than that of the smallest house in Palo
Alto. It is now estimated that the
average cost of a home in Palo Alto is
more than twice the national average,
which is just under $ 100,000, accord
ing to several realty experts.
The University reacted quickly to
the crisis by developing a number of
finance programs aimed to make
housing more affordable to its faculty
and senior-level staff.
The first of these, a second
mortgage co-investment program
called COIN, went into operation in
1980. It allowed a faculty or senior
staff member to borrow money from
the University and to pay reduced
current interest on the loan in ex
change for the University's right to
recapture the deferred interest out of
the appreciation on their residence.
The "10/30" loan program
replaced COIN in 1983. Although it
provides essentially the same service
to faculty and staff that COIN did, it
is differently structured. Instead of
using University money, the "10/30"
loan program is financed by outside
lenders.
Holloway doesn't consider the
10/30" loan program a long-term
solution to the problem of making
housing affordable to faculty and
staff. Although the University does

guarantee the deferred interest pay
ments to the outside lender, Hol
loway cited the difficulty of market
ing the program to financial institu
tions as one of its drawbacks. He said
it was "very likely" that Stanford will
have to develop a loan program in
which it participates in the ownership
of faculty and staff housing "in some
way."
HAP, a housing allowance pro
gram started in 1981 to help faculty
and senior staff members over the
hump of coming up with the extra
cash needed to purchase a home, lias
already meted out more than $1
million. This program provides newly
recruited faculty who buy homes
within a 15-mile radius of Hoover
Tower with a yearly compensation
proportional to and in addition to
their regular salaries.
For example, at its inception the
program provided an assistant profes
sor who earned $22,400 a year with a
housing allowance of $3,565 for the
first year. On the assumption that the
first year is always the hardest when
buying a house, the University
reduces the allowances by one
seventh annually, phasing them out
after seven years.
The most recent finance program,
approved last month, provides down
payment assistance for housing in the
form of unsecured loans supplied by
the University, fully amortized over
10 years.
Holloway said that although many
universities have similar housing pro
grams, none, to his knowledge, are as
extensive as Stanford's. "But no
other university faces a housing mar
ket as severely inflated as this one,"
he added. "Even with these pro
grams, we still have trouble recruiting
faculty."
Stanford as housing developer
But financing homes is only half
the problem the University faces.
Palo Alto has had a self-recognizd
job/housing imbalance for years. Be
cause of this, Stanford, on whose land
some 42,000 people work and study,
has been forced into the business of
building homes.
There is a great demand for
housing on or close to campus. Ac
cording to Robin Hamill, director of
Housing and Transportation Pro
grams, half the faculty who purchase
homes in any given year buy on
campus. And this is despite the inad
verant inflation that has occurred on
campus as Stanford money keeps get
ting pumped back into its housing
market through its finance programs.
John Felstiner, a professor of En
glish who has been at Stanford for 20
years, has lived in three different

houses on campus. When he pur
chased his first home, neither the
Palo Alto nor the Stanford housing
markets had become inflated.
Economically, the primary attraction
of purchasing a house on campus was
that the University automatically
financed the mortgage at an interest
rate slightly lower than the market
rate. But it's the convenience of living
on campus that has appealed to
Felstiner most.
"I've been very happy living on
campus," he said. "My wife and 1
both work, and with a family it's been
important to be able to run home
easily. I also like being close to all the
activities on campus."
But as the campus becomes more
densely developed, the University
must design its new housing com
plexes for the lots on the perimeter of
Stanford's lands, some of which are
annexed by Palo Alto and adjacent to
other residential communities. Stan
ford can't take steps to alleviate its
own housing shortage without consid
ering the impact of its actions on the

surrounding communities, whose
views on development are often very
different from those of the Univer
sity.
Hamill said the University acts
from what she calls a "perspective in
perpetuity," making plans as if it will
be here forever. "What happens here
is a result of our thirst for knowledge
and our commitment to be on the
forefront of knowledge, whatever it
is."
She contrasted this to the motiva
tion of a community like Palo Alto,
which she said had a definite eco
nomic component. "But it's an eco
nomic motivation that has at its heart
a desire for the well-being of the
people in the community. When
there's a conflict between the Univer
sity and the residential communities,
it's simply that each side is saying,
'We want to survive, but our way of
surviving contradicts your way.' "
Hamill said she could sympathize
wft'h Palo Alto residents who object
to Stanford building a housing devel
opment as large as the proposed

Stanford West, which would hold as
many as 1,100 housing units. "The
people who live here like Palo Alto
the way it has been — a quiet, family
oriented town with tree-lined streets.
But what's happened in the past 20
years is that it's been converted to the
economic hub of the Silicon Valley. A
lot of people are understandably hor
rified and are trying to put on the
brakes wherever they can," Hamill
said.
The anti-growth sentiment in Palo
Alto has been very strong. Between
1970 and 1980, fewer than 1,200 new
housing units were built. "So when
Stanford came along with a proposal
to build as many housing units as had
been built in the past decade all in
one area, across from one of the most
heavily trafficked roads in the area,
and all to its own benefit, it really
came down to a 'you versus us' in the
worst way," Hamill said.
"I think the residents of this com
munity were saying, 'Stanford, you're
being selfish. You're being selfish like
you were selfish when you pushed the

Oregon Expressway through so there
would be a direct route between
Highway 101 and the Research
Park,' " she said. "We can under
stand this position, but at the same
time we feel a mandate for our sur
vival as an institution and we have an
obligation to act accordingly."
Hamill added that although Palo
Alto's policies are preponderantly
anti-growth, it claims to have a com
mitment to correcting the job/housing
imbalance. "The rhetoric is pro
housing, but nobody wants it in their
neighborhood. And people don't say
they oppose housing because their
own property values will go up if it
isn't built, but that's implicit. The
jobs/housing imbalance has made a
lot of people rich, but it's never
couched that way. People just say it
would be great to have more lower
and moderate income housing, if only
there were a place to put it."
This kind of selective opposition to
new housing developments isn't a

not for staff. ... As soon as they realized it wasn't going to be for poor
people, a lot of the objections went away," said Robin Hamill, director
of Housing and Transportation Programs.

Peter Coutts Hill Condominiums, built in 1981 off Page Mill Road, en
gendered less controversy than the originally planned Frenchman's
Terrace "because it was clear it was going to be for junior faculty and
recent phenomenon. Sylvia Seman,
executive director of the Palo Alto
Housing Corporation, calls it the
"NIMBY" syndrome. She said that
there is genuine concern in Palo Alto
about the job/housing imbalance, but
that when it comes right down to con
struction, "everyone" agrees that
there's a need for more housing in
Palo Alto, but "not in my backyard."
Hamill said that Frenchman's
Terrace — a 1972 housing project
designed for the site that now holds
the Peter Coutts Hill Condominiums
— inspired heavy protest from the
community. Seman, a member of the
Palo Alto City Council at the time,
agreed that the opposition was
"impossible."
Frenchman's Terrace, a lower and
moderate income housing project,
was thought to be eligible for federal
funding. However, Seman said that
although Palo Alto eventually ap
proved the project "over a lot of dead
bodies," it was never built because
Stanford wanted to give preference to
people who worked at Stanford,
which the federal government's
financing wouldn't permit.
The Peter Coutts Hill Con
dominiums, built in 1981 off Page
Mill Road, are a very different proj
ect. Hamill said that from the start,
the project encountered less contro
versy than Frenchman's Terrace
"because it was clear it was going to
be for junior faculty and not for staff.
People didn't actually come out and
say they didn't want poor people
moving into their neighborhood, but
as soon as they realized it wasn't
going to be for poor people, a lot of
the objections went away."
The major source of protest of the
Peter Coutts Hill Condominiums
came from the community of College
Terrace, whose residents didn't want
to lose the open space they called
"Kite Hill." An agreement was
reached that left a parcel of land close
to campus "undeveloped in per
petuity" for the use of the commu
nity.
Eighty-six of the 140 Peter Coutts
units have been sold at market rates
to faculty and senior staff, according
to Barbara Klein, associate director
of Housing and Transportation Pro
grams. The others are being rented,
mostly to visiting faculty.
Sandra Archibald, assistant profes
sor at the Food Research Institute,
purchased a condominium in the de

velopment last year after she sold her
previous home in Davis. She said that
her home in Peter Coutts was the
most affordable for its size in the
area, but that she "almost didn't
come" because of the high prices.
"I had some capital before I came
here, so if housing was an issue for
me, think of what it must be like for
someone just starting out. I'm paying
four times as much to live here as I
would if I had accepted any of my
other job offers. And I lived in a big
ger house when I was a graduate stu
dent," Archibald said. She added that
she does like living in Peter Coutts,
especially because of its proximity to
campus.
Hamill said the University con
siders the Peter Coutts Hill Con
dominiums "very successful."
Another successful housing devel
opment is its first condominium proj
ect, Pearce Mitchell, which opened in
1976. It was originally designed for
emeriti professors, but has also
become popular with young faculty
members who have no children. Like
the Peter Coutts Hill Condominiums,
the units in Pearce Mitchell were sold
at market rates. Unlike Peter Coutts
and Frenchman's Terrace, Pearce
Mitchell encountered no significant
opposition.
"We built Pearce Mitchell on the
site of an old elementary school in the
middle of campus, so it wasn't as if we
were taking anything away from
anyone," Hamill said.
But Stanford's housing needs are
far from being met. In the effort to
provide more housing at lower prices,
the University has been in conflict
with Palo Alto since 1981 over its
proposed development of Stanford
West.
Stanford West originally combined
two parcels of land on opposite sides
of Willow Road in one comprehen
sive housing project. The largest par
cel, referred to as "the 46 acres," was
to hold up to 1,100 units of low- to
moderate-income housing for all uni
versity faculty and staff. Although
there was much controversy over the
project, a series of changes was sug
gested to make the project benefit
Palo Alto as well as Stanford, and the
Environmental Impact Report for the
project was finally approved.
The approval, however, was con
tingent upon Stanford agreeing to
certain mitigating measures, which
Hamill said "we could not accept."
"We sort of put down our tents for
a while," Hamill said. "We had put at
least $2 million into a project which
would have provided 1,100 badly
needed housing units and we got

blown out of the water."
The University has decided to sit
tight on the 46-acre parcel of Stan
ford West and try to push through the
construction of the smaller parcel,
1100 Welch Road, which would in
clude 42 small leasehold con
dominiums to be used as a "hometel"
for long-term out-patients at the
Medical Center and the families of
long-term in-patients, as well as 108
apartment units.
About the construction of 1100
Welch Road, Hamill said, "We think
that if it's friendly and if the city's
supportive and if we can get into the
ground in a reasonable period of
time, then we'll have faith that we
really can work out a modus operandi
with the community and we'll go back
and try Stanford West."
It seems that Stanford West won't
be forgotten. But Seman, whose in
volvement with Stanford West has
concerned designating some of the
units in the project for Palo Alto's
below market rate (BMR) program,
said, "There has been a kind of tug
ging back and forth as to whether
Stanford should serve Palo Alto or
only its own people. A lot of people
feel Stanford has contributed to the
housing shortage and very high prices
because of its development of the in

dustrial park and the urbanization of
the entire area."
The University was initially
opposed to designating some of the
Stanford West units for Palo Alto's
BMR housing project. It took the po
sition that Stanford West would aid
Palo Alto indirectly by freeing up the
housing situation in general.
Although it might seem tangential
to Stanford's real problem of provid
ing affordable housing, the concept of
BMR housing is actually at the heart
of the dilemma.
Stanford has a twofold purpose in
designing a project like Stanford
West. First, it is creating actual
housing units which are sorely needed
in the area. Second, it is trying to pro
vide affordable housing. So implicit in
the design of a lower- to moderate
income housing development is the
need for these houses to stay affor
dable instead of immediately assum
ing local market rates.
Hamill said this need is one of the
most difficult problems Stanford
faces. "Housing prices will go up if
you don't control them. We are
thinking about the possibility that we
would impose some kind of price con
trol mechanism, because what's the
point of developing lower- and
moderate-income housing and selling

it to someone at an affordable price
when they're going to turn around
and sell it at market rates and make a
killing. Stanford isn't out to give away
money," she said.
The University is researching legal
and economic mechanisms for price
control, according to Hamill.
Seman said that Palo Alto has
found a way to control the prices of
the homes it designates as BMR.
"The city puts deed restrictions on
the house that get recorded with the
grant deed when the first purchaser
buys the house. These restrictions
limit the appreciation on it so that
each buyer can make a tiny profit
based on a portion of what the infla
tion rate is, but it's still affordable to
the next buyer. We think that is the
key ingredient in the program — to
build up a stock of affordable
houses," she said.
There is a demand for lower- to
moderate-income housing at Stan
ford that will need to be maintained
by some method of price control, but
according to Holloway, it's in the
University's best interest to keep a
wide range in its housing inventory.
"Some faculty see housing as an in
vestment. If a house isn't part of the
market, then it can't be an invest
ment. Part of what made Peter Coutts

so successful is its quality and the ap
preciation on the value of the
homes," he said.
There is no indication that the
housing market will decline in the
near future, so anyone who can afford
to purchase a home is making a fairly
secure investment. Seman empha
sized that all experience indi
cates that the construction of lower
to moderate-income housing
developments like Stanford West has
no significant impact on the property
values of surrounding homes.
"People are afraid for their prop
erty values," Seman said. "One thing
I've discovered is that if a large devel
opment already exists, people have
no second thoughts about moving
next to it, but if they're living some
where and they catch wind of a plan
for a new housing development, espe
cially if it's lower or moderate
income, they get scared for their
property values and they fight tooth
and nail against it. But in Palo Alto
it's an unfounded fear."
Hamill said that across the board,
the University reaps no benefits from
the high housing prices, but she did
cite one exception. Apparently, fac
ulty retirement programs at univer
sities across the nation have proved to
be inadequate. But at Stanford, the
majority of retiring professors who
came to the University 30 to 40 years
ago and purchased homes are now
sitting on property which is easily
worth half a million dollars.
"They may still have a cash flow
problem, but they're basically
wealthy," Hamill said. Stanford has
made available a reverse annuity
mortgage program which would allow
retired faculty to continue to live in
their homes, but receive cash monthly
in the form of loans against their
residences.
Renting: on and off campus
To a person in a position to make
an investment in real estate, the
area's high prices may be both a
blessing and a curse. But what is the
effect of such high housing prices on
students who have no plans to buy
homes, and most likely no means?
Marsh McCall, a junior majoring in
English who calls himself a "faculty
brat," came to Stanford 10 years ago
with his family. His family purchasd a
home which is now worth con
siderably more than they paid for it,
but McCall says he's already "looking
for roommates" so that he can afford
to live in the area when he graduates.
He is willing to swallow the high
prices because he considers the Bay

The University's first condominium project, Pearce Mitchell, was built in 1976 on the site of an old elemen
tary school. Originally designed for emeriti professors, it has become popular with young faculty members.
Area an excellent place to pursue his
interest in a musical career.
Right now McCall lives on campus,
primarily for the convenience. Ac
cording to Rodger Whitney, director
of the Housing Center here, most un
dergraduates echo these sentiments.
"We house 87 percent of our under
graduate students. And of the 10 per
cent who live off campus, we estimate
that up to 500 would like to live on
campus if there were room."
Whitney said he didn't think
housing prices had a lot to do with
people's desires to live on campus.
"Some people actually find that they
can save money living off campus. I
would say that the majority of under
graduates live on campus because
they like the social life."
Governor's Corner, which opened
in the fall of 1982, is an 800-space
student housing complex designed to
satisfy some of the unmet demand for
on-campus housing. Whitney said it
"looked encouraging" that within the
next few years the University would
be able to build another student
housing complex "similar to Gover
nor's Corner."
"We're proud of what we've done
with our student housing, but we're
always trying to do more," Whitney
said.
He acknowledged that the Univer
sity wasn't as pleased with its inven
tory of graduate housing. "There's a
great demand among graduates for
single rooms, which the current
housing inventory doesn't satisfy. We
have too many one-bedroom
doubles." The University currently
houses 40 percent of its graduate stu
dents.
Whitney said the housing program
for graduates with families was more
satisfactory. He said the University
can provide all graduate students with

families with on-campus housing if
they want it. In addition, families
receive a four-year contract once they
are assigned to a residence, instead of
the one-year contract that single stu
dents receive.
Jim Young, a graduate student in
English who is married and has one
child, said that, on the whole, he has
found Escondido Village "a mar
velous place to live." He said the high
housing prices around Stanford
weren't a consideration when he
decided to come here.
Young, who intends to teach at the
university level, added, however, that
he plans to return with his family to
their home in Alberta, Canada, after
he completes his studies. He wouldn't
be able to consider living in this area
"because it's just too expensive for
anyone to start out in."
Hamill agreed that the high prices
make this area undesirable to young
couples with children. "My greatest
sadness is that Palo Alto will become
a community of old people. In the ab
sence of finance programs like ours, it
takes someone with a salary of
$150,000 to afford an attractive
single family home here. Not many
people with school-age children make
that kind of money."
Ken Warren, a graduate student in
English and the family representative
for the graduate housing committee,
said that Stanford's family housing
program made it possible for him to
study here. The first year he was ac
cepted to the graduate program he
didn't receive an on-campus
residence in the graduate draw and
was forced to delay his studies until
the next year, when he re-applied and
got on campus.
Since he has been at Stanford,
however, Warren has been disap
pointed by the University's policies

with regard to Escondido Village.
Last year he was among residents
who protested rent increases that had
been 70 to 80 percent over the previ
ous two or three years.
"Stipends had increased, but not at
that rate," Warren said. "I think I
speak for quite a few people when I
say that if we had known how rents
would increase we would have recon
sidered our decisions to come here a
few years ago."
Warren added that he feels high
housing prices influence many
graduate students' decisions not to
come to Stanford, although official
statistics fail to show this.
Although Palo Alto rents can be as
high as $1,100 for a one-bedroom
apartment, rough estimates indicate
that 15 to 20 percent of Stanford's
students stay in the Palo Alto area
after graduation and as many as 50
percent remain in the Bay Area.
Adam Schnitzer, who completed a
master's degree in fine arts at Stan
ford last year, said he plans to stay in
the area, as much as anything
"because I'm here." This is despite
the fact that he has found rents in the
area to be higher than in any other
place he has lived, including Boston
and Los Angeles.
"Palo Alto is different from a lot of
major cities where you usually can
find something cheap if you're willing
to scrounge around," Schnitzer said.
He also speculated that many of
the students who stay in the area after
graduation through inertia would
probably end up coming here by their
own choice sooner or later, "attracted
by the job opportunities and the
upper-class sensibilities they are used
to."
Manuel Morales, who graduated
from Stanford last year with a bach
elor's degree in fine arts and graphic

design, doesn't plan to stay in the
area. "You can't excuse the high
prices here by saying it's the most at
tractive place to live. There are a lot
of other attractive places to live.
What scenic beauty there is in this
area is offset by the pollution and the
population density and the never
ending traffic jam," he said.
Morales added that he thought
there was more to the local inflation

than meets the eye. "It's strange to
find couples in their 40s and 50s still
renting, but that's how it is here for a
lot of people. And you'd better
believe it's these people working at
$4.50 an hour who make the wealth
of Stanford and this entire area possi
ble."
But there's no indication that the
Palo Alto housing market and the
factors that contribute to it will

change in the near future. "Barring
the earthquake, prices around Stan
ford will continue to rise," Hamill
said.
The housing prices that pay tribute
to Stanford's success may be the in
strument of its own destruction, but
Hamill said the University will con
tinue to do its best to make housing
affordable to the people who want to
move to this area.
