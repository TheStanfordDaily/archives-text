## Stanford faces demand for affordable housing 
### AMY BIRD 
The high housing prices in Palo
Alto and the other communities sur
rounding Stanford strain the imagina
tion, but they are evidence of this
area's tremendous popularity. No one
can deny that the University, with its
cultural offerings and its part in the
development of Silicon Valley, has
played a significant role in making the
Mid-Peninsula so popular.
But Stanford is an institution
whose continued vitality depends on
its ability to attract and sustain a
diverse faculty, staff and student
body. More so now than ever, admi
nistrators face the task of ensuring
that high housing prices don't scare
off the people on whom Stanford's
future depends.
Charles Holloway, associate dean
of the Graduate School of Business
and chairman of the decanal sub
committee for faculty housing, said
that the University began seeing the
impact of increasing housing prices in
the mid-70s, and that by 1980 it had
become clear that Stanford was "in
trouble."
Many entry-level assistant profes
sors declined the positions for which
they had been recruited because they
simply couldn't afford to live in the
area, and many established scholars
and experts didn't find Stanford's
allure enough to offset the fact that
the market value of a luxurious home
in the Midwest might easily be less
than that of the smallest house in Palo
Alto. It is now estimated that the
average cost of a home in Palo Alto is
more than twice the national average,
which is just under $ 100,000, accord
ing to several realty experts.
The University reacted quickly to
the crisis by developing a number of
finance programs aimed to make
housing more affordable to its faculty
and senior-level staff.
The first of these, a second
mortgage co-investment program
called COIN, went into operation in
1980. It allowed a faculty or senior
staff member to borrow money from
the University and to pay reduced
current interest on the loan in ex
change for the University's right to
recapture the deferred interest out of
the appreciation on their residence.
The "10/30" loan program
replaced COIN in 1983. Although it
provides essentially the same service
to faculty and staff that COIN did, it
is differently structured. Instead of
using University money, the "10/30"
loan program is financed by outside
lenders.
Holloway doesn't consider the
10/30" loan program a long-term
solution to the problem of making
housing affordable to faculty and
staff. Although the University does

guarantee the deferred interest pay
ments to the outside lender, Hol
loway cited the difficulty of market
ing the program to financial institu
tions as one of its drawbacks. He said
it was "very likely" that Stanford will
have to develop a loan program in
which it participates in the ownership
of faculty and staff housing "in some
way."
HAP, a housing allowance pro
gram started in 1981 to help faculty
and senior staff members over the
hump of coming up with the extra
cash needed to purchase a home, lias
already meted out more than $1
million. This program provides newly
recruited faculty who buy homes
within a 15-mile radius of Hoover
Tower with a yearly compensation
proportional to and in addition to
their regular salaries.
For example, at its inception the
program provided an assistant profes
sor who earned $22,400 a year with a
housing allowance of $3,565 for the
first year. On the assumption that the
first year is always the hardest when
buying a house, the University
reduces the allowances by one
seventh annually, phasing them out
after seven years.
The most recent finance program,
approved last month, provides down
payment assistance for housing in the
form of unsecured loans supplied by
the University, fully amortized over
10 years.
Holloway said that although many
universities have similar housing pro
grams, none, to his knowledge, are as
extensive as Stanford's. "But no
other university faces a housing mar
ket as severely inflated as this one,"
he added. "Even with these pro
grams, we still have trouble recruiting
faculty."
Stanford as housing developer
But financing homes is only half
the problem the University faces.
Palo Alto has had a self-recognizd
job/housing imbalance for years. Be
cause of this, Stanford, on whose land
some 42,000 people work and study,
has been forced into the business of
building homes.
There is a great demand for
housing on or close to campus. Ac
cording to Robin Hamill, director of
Housing and Transportation Pro
grams, half the faculty who purchase
homes in any given year buy on
campus. And this is despite the inad
verant inflation that has occurred on
campus as Stanford money keeps get
ting pumped back into its housing
market through its finance programs.
John Felstiner, a professor of En
glish who has been at Stanford for 20
years, has lived in three different

houses on campus. When he pur
chased his first home, neither the
Palo Alto nor the Stanford housing
markets had become inflated.
Economically, the primary attraction
of purchasing a house on campus was
that the University automatically
financed the mortgage at an interest
rate slightly lower than the market
rate. But it's the convenience of living
on campus that has appealed to
Felstiner most.
"I've been very happy living on
campus," he said. "My wife and 1
both work, and with a family it's been
important to be able to run home
easily. I also like being close to all the
activities on campus."
But as the campus becomes more
densely developed, the University
must design its new housing com
plexes for the lots on the perimeter of
Stanford's lands, some of which are
annexed by Palo Alto and adjacent to
other residential communities. Stan
ford can't take steps to alleviate its
own housing shortage without consid
ering the impact of its actions on the

surrounding communities, whose
views on development are often very
different from those of the Univer
sity.
Hamill said the University acts
from what she calls a "perspective in
perpetuity," making plans as if it will
be here forever. "What happens here
is a result of our thirst for knowledge
and our commitment to be on the
forefront of knowledge, whatever it
is."
She contrasted this to the motiva
tion of a community like Palo Alto,
which she said had a definite eco
nomic component. "But it's an eco
nomic motivation that has at its heart
a desire for the well-being of the
people in the community. When
there's a conflict between the Univer
sity and the residential communities,
it's simply that each side is saying,
'We want to survive, but our way of
surviving contradicts your way.' "
Hamill said she could sympathize
wft'h Palo Alto residents who object
to Stanford building a housing devel
opment as large as the proposed

Stanford West, which would hold as
many as 1,100 housing units. "The
people who live here like Palo Alto
the way it has been â€” a quiet, family
oriented town with tree-lined streets.
But what's happened in the past 20
years is that it's been converted to the
economic hub of the Silicon Valley. A
lot of people are understandably hor
rified and are trying to put on the
brakes wherever they can," Hamill
said.
The anti-growth sentiment in Palo
Alto has been very strong. Between
1970 and 1980, fewer than 1,200 new
housing units were built. "So when
Stanford came along with a proposal
to build as many housing units as had
been built in the past decade all in
one area, across from one of the most
heavily trafficked roads in the area,
and all to its own benefit, it really
came down to a 'you versus us' in the
worst way," Hamill said.
"I think the residents of this com
munity were saying, 'Stanford, you're
being selfish. You're being selfish like
you were selfish when you pushed the

Oregon Expressway through so there
would be a direct route between
Highway 101 and the Research
Park,' " she said. "We can under
stand this position, but at the same
time we feel a mandate for our sur
vival as an institution and we have an
obligation to act accordingly."
Hamill added that although Palo
Alto's policies are preponderantly
anti-growth, it claims to have a com
mitment to correcting the job/housing
imbalance. "The rhetoric is pro
housing, but nobody wants it in their
neighborhood. And people don't say
they oppose housing because their
own property values will go up if it
isn't built, but that's implicit. The
jobs/housing imbalance has made a
lot of people rich, but it's never
couched that way. People just say it
would be great to have more lower
and moderate income housing, if only
there were a place to put it."
This kind of selective opposition to
new housing developments isn't a

not for staff. ... As soon as they realized it wasn't going to be for poor
people, a lot of the objections went away," said Robin Hamill, director
of Housing and Transportation Programs.
