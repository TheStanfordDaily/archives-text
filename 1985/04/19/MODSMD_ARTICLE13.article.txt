## THE 						STANFORD DAILY Call off cemetery visit 
### 
When President Reagan announced plans to
visit the graves of German soldiers killed in
World War 11, but not to commemorate the
Holocaust at a Nazi death camp, during his
"symbolic journey" to West Germany next
month, aides said he had made an impulsive deci
sion. They argued that Reagan's desire to
strengthen the NATO alliance had gotten the
better of him, adding that a dearth of Jews in the
president's inner circle had paved the way to in
sensitivity.
When administered carefully, symbolism can
be a good thing, and the president undoubtedly
had that goal in mind when he elected to visit the
Bitburg military cemetery May 5. But the Bitburg
visit would hardly send an eloquent message
about America's understanding of Nazism and
history. Reagan's attempt to quell political oppo
sition by arranging Wednesday to visit a concen
tration camp only muddies the waters. Murderers
and victims don't deserve equal treatment.
Bitburg was a staging ground during the Battle

of the Bulge, in which 19,000 Americans were
killed. Members of the Waffen, the combat arm
of the elite Nazi SS, are buried there.
The president said a month ago that there were
"very few" Germans still alive who "remember
even the war," let alone committed atrocities
against Jews. In fact, about 500 SS veterans are
expected to hold reunions in Germany at the
same time as the Reagan visit.
Reagan is often noted for saying, "You know,
I don't think we ought to focus on the past, I want
to focus on the future, I want to put that history
behind me." The Bitburg visit could be seen by
the Soviet Union — which lost millions in the
Great Patriotic War and would doubtless take of
fense at Reagan's ignoring the significance of
Nazism — as an attempt to aggravate East-West
relations.
The president has already reconsidered his visit
to a concentration camp, and there's still time to
call off the Bitburg ceremony. It would help the
living and the dead rest just that much easier.
