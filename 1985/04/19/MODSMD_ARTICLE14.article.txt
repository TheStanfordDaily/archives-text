# C'mon, Ron, pardon Hitler
## 
### 
Ronald Reagan has the right idea. Or at least he had —
now he's been forced to change his plans. He's going to
West Germany later this month, and at first he did not
plan to visit the site of the Nazi death camp at Dachau;
but he did decide to pay a visit to the Bitburg military
cemetery and lay a wreath to honor the dead. This, in the
"spirit of reconciliation" with which he hopes to impress
our West German allies.
Of course, some people don't like the idea of honoring
German soldiers while ignoring the people they helped,

however indirectly, to kill. And those people complained
loudly to the administration, and the administration had
to change Reagan's itinerary, which is a pity. Because
really, Reagan had the right idea. World War II was a long
time ago. It's time to let bygones be bygones.
I remember a poster that Mad magazine put out, back
when Gerald Ford was handing out presidential pardons
to everyone and his dog. The poster said, "So, why not. . .
pardon Hitler?" They meant it as satire, of course. But
thirjk about it. Why not? Have some sympathy for the
man. He is dead, after all, and it's been 40 years. Isn't 40
years a long time to hold a grudge?
Apparently the Great Communicator thinks it's too
long. And he's right. Well, maybe we shouldn't actually
pardon Hitler. But we can at least stop talking all the time
about what a nasty person he was. We can have some
respect for the dead.
And because Reagan is a nice guy, he's willing to forget
about some of the unpleasant things that happened. He's
willing to honor soldiers, most of whom died in an attempt
to preserve a nation that was considerably more evil than
the Evil Empire. It's water under the bridge. He was will
ing to overlook Dachau, and by extension Auschwitz and
Buchenwald and Treblinka and all those other places.
That's how nice a guy he is.
He thought that a visit to Dachau would "send the
wrong signal" to Germans. Well, he's right. It would. It
would tell Germans — and for that matter anybody who
was looking — that the leader of the United States
thought it was important to remember the Holocaust, that
he thought it was something more than a tragic accident
best dealt with by ignoring it.
And that is the wrong signal. He doesn't care, not very
much. Someone who cared would have realized that ig
noring Dachau and then going off to pay homage to dead
German soldiers was completely insensitive. That sounds
pretty negative, but it's not meant to. I think it's a very
positive thing for a leader to be insensitive. Insensitivity is
macho, and right now America needs macho leadership.
Could you imagine a sensitive non-macho wimp like Wal
ter Mondale or Alan Alda leading the country? Of course
not. We need macho leadership to take us through these

troubled times, and as Gil Scott-Heron says, since John
Wayne is dead, Reagan is the next best thing.
He's doing all right so far, isn't he? Aren't you better
off now than you were four years ago? It's all because
Reagan is insensitive. He's fixing up the economy by
being insensitive to the needs of the poor; he's making
America strong by being insensitive to an awesome
federal deficit; now he's going to strengthen our bonds
with West Germany by being insensitive to the victims of
the Holocaust. A lot of bleeding-heart knee-jerk liberal
fuzzy thinkers are upset about that. Well, the hell with
them. They simply don't understand political realities like
Ron and I do.
World War II was a long time ago. Who can remember
that far back? Like Ron says, "there are very few
[Germans] alive who remember the war and certainly
none of them who were adults and participating in any
way." Isn't it bad enough that there are no living Germans
over the age of 60? Do we have to keep rubbing their
noses in things like death camps? Do we have to keep rub
bing our own noses in it? After all, what are a few million
people, more or less? More died of the Black Death, and
we don't have Black Death memorials and ceremonies.
All those people would have died eventually anyway.
If we can't just ignore it like decent people — and I
suppose those bleeding hearts won't let us — at least we
could be more cheerful about it. If it hadn't been for
World War 11, America wouldn't be a superpower today,
so at least the victims died for a good cause.
What's everybody moping around for? Why haven't we
recognized those people as real American kind of heros?
Why aren't there any Death Camp inmate action figures

Why have there been no
Escape from Bergen-Belsen
video games, or T-shirts that
say "Mom and Dad went to
Auschwitz and all I got was
this lousy T-shirt"?

with kung fu grip? Why have there been no television sit
coms set in Buchenwald? Why no Escape from Bergen-
Belsen video games, or T-shirts that say "Mom and Dad
went to Auschwitz and all I got was this lousy T-shirt"?
I'll tell you why. It's because of the wimps, the bleeding
hearts. They want us all to remember history the way it
was, even if it is ugly. They want us all to feel bad about
something that wasn't even our fault. But why should his
tory be ugly? What's the point of remembering unpleasant
things? It just upsets people and sends them wrong sig
nals. If we have to remember them, let's remember them
in a good way, a fun way.
After all, it'll never happen again, will it?
