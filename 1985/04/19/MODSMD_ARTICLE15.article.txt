On March 22, The Wall Street Journal reported
that "South African police killed at least 17 blacks
marching into a white town. About 4,000 blacks
. . . confronted in Uitenhage by police who fired
into the crowd after the marchers threw stones and
spears, witnesses said."
The witnesses The Wall Street Journal must have
been referring to are the South African police in
volved in the shooting, as they were the only wit
nesses who claimed that the violence was initiated
by the marchers. Yet the police report made no
mention of spears. ,

VIEWPOINT

In fact, nowhere else but in The Wall Street
Journal did I read that the marchers were carrying
or throwing spears. Why is that? According to a
report issued by South African Minister of Law and
Order Louis LeGrange after consulting with the of
ficers involved, a hostile crowd of 4.000 armed with
stones, sticks and gasoline bombs had encircled the
police patrol, forcing the police to fire in self
defense after ordering the crowd to disperse. The
account of the Uitenhage massacre put forth by the
South African police and government is now being
destroyed as the facts are revealed.
In his testimony before a judicial inquiry into the
Uitenhage killings, the commanding officer of the
police unit involved is now saying what other wit
nesses had reported all along. According to
Lieut. Fouche, contrary to earlier government
accounts, no firebombs had been thrown at the
police armored cars, nor had they been surrounded
bv the crowd and been unable to retreat.

In fact, the commanding officer now states that
only one stone had been thrown before he shouted
"Fire! Immediately!" After questioning, the officer
admitted that the leader of the crowd did not have
a brick in his hand, as was reported. Black wit
nesses said that their leader was a minister and that
he had a Bible in his hand.
It is becoming painfully obvious that the crowd

Why were no warning shots fired? Why did the
police open fire so quickly? And why the tangled
web of lies emanating from the South African
police and government?

was on its way to attend funerals for victims of ear
lier violence in another township, Kwanobuhle,
and, in order to do so, had to pass through white
areas of Uitenhage. They were not, as the police
and government had indicated, aiming to assault
and kill people in the white residential areas.
"1 believed that my men and I would definitely
be overrun and killed if I did not give the order to
fire," the commanding officer testified. "Also, I
had gained the impression that the crowd was on its
way to the white residential areas of Uitenhage,
that they were on their way to kill people." As a

result, police opened fire on a crowd of 4,000, kil
ling 19.
Many troubling questions are raised by this inci
dent. Why were no warning shots fired? Why did
the police open fire so quickly? Why were bullets
rather than tear gas used to disperse the crowd?
And why the tangled web of lies emanating from
the South African police and government?

The inescapable conclusion which has been rein
forced by the recent killings in South Africa is that
apartheid and violence go hand in hand. More
than 270 people have been killed in violent conflict
in South Africa within the past 12 months. The
type of bloody conflict which has swept through the
Eastern Cape of South Africa in recent weeks is en
demic to apartheid. Next time you read in the
newspapers' "official" accounts of violence in
South Africa, think twice.
