Ad should not run
We would like to thank The Daily
for addressing the issue of Playboy's
visit to Stanford. We want to add a
few comments.
Not only "student-run" papers
such as The Daily Californian, but
respected and nationally read
newspapers like the Los Angeles
Times, refuse to print sexually op
pressive advertisements: "When a
newspaper adopts such a policy, as
[the L.A. Times] has done, it is not
banning the publication of the ad
vertisement altogether.... All that
the newspaper is saying is that it
does not care to publish the ad
vertisement, which would clash with
the tone of the newspaper. But the
advertiser is free to publish the ad
somewhere else" (L.A. Times,
March 25).
Like The Daily Californian, The
Stanford Daily is a student-run paper
which should represent the student
body. The Daily is making an edito
rial decision by running the ad, be
cause members of the Stanford
community have asked The Daily
not to print the ad.
The Playboy ad itself is dis
criminatory toward women and men.
It specifically mentions "girls" and
"coeds" who, to qualify, must be " 18
years of age or older." We are
women, not "girls." And if the term
"mankind" supposedly includes men
and women, then the term "coeds"

should include men and women, like
Brett Glass and ourselves. The term
"coeds" is outdated and dis
criminatory.
In Brett Glass' letter (The Daily,
April 5), he claims that the women
in Playboy are "from all walks of
life" and have nothing in common
but "exceptional physical beauty."
Stereotypes? Yes! the "beauty"
chosen is chosen to fit a stereotype
projected by men onto women.
Men have chosen a standard for
female beauty that they use to mea
sure us. Women's bodies are beauti
ful in themselves, without having to
fit the image of "the centerfold."
Even the women who pose don't
really look like their final photograph
ic images, airbrushed and modified.
Glass also mentions the First
Amendment controversy. The First
Amendment exists, and with good
reason, but it is not a ticket to limit
the rights of others. There is a point
when one's rights infringe upon
another's rights. In this case, the
concept of women's sexuality as
represented by Playboy limits the
rights of women in our society.
The First Amendment issue is an
already old argument used as an
excuse not to deal with sexism.
There is a continuum of pornography
from "soft porn," like Playboy, to
"hard core." Pornography, and
objectification and violence against
women, are acceptable, everyday
occurrences in our sexist, phal-

locentric world.
Finally, we object to The Daily's
condescending use of the word
"trick" ("we don't believe an ad in
The Daily will trick any women here
to pose for Playboy"). We are an
"intelligent lot" of women. We only
hope that the women who decide to
pose make an educated decision.
They are our sisters, and we want
them to know how we feel.

Motherly challenged
After being publicly attacked on
the Opinions page of your newspa
per (Jason Matherly's column, April
17), I feel I have no choice but to
make this statement.
1 hereby challenge that pencil
neck geek Matherly to a steel cage
professional wrestling match to be
held in Frost Amphitheatre between
acts of the April 29 Grateful Dead
show. This is especially appropriate,
since professional wrestling is billed
as the sport of the '80s, and Math
erly's ultra-conservative ideas are
also of the '80s (the 1780s, that is).
And if Matherly wants to team up
with Jim McGrath for a tag-team
match, I'm sure that wish could be
accommodated.
