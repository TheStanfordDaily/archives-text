With threats to abolish the ASSL Senate, the Hammer
and Coffin Slate solidly defeated both of its competitors in
this week's election to become next academic year's
Council of Presidents (COP).
In addition, preliminary election results released last
night showed that no constitutional amendments, which
require two-thirds of the vote to succeed, passed. The
constitutional amendment to eliminate cash refunds of
special fees suffered the most resounding defeat, receiving
nearly 3,000 more "no" votes than "yes" votes.
Elections Commissioner Kevin Gross said the results
remain incomplete because 10 absentee ballots need to be
counted, and the ballots for engineering graduate senators
need to be recounted.
The members of the victorious H & C slate — Michael
Collins, Andy Frisch, Leslie Leland and Tim Quirk —
were relaxed about their win.
"We're very happy, but although we've been elected,
we haven't won: We have a seriate to disband," said slate
member Michael Collins. Collins said that over the next
couple of weeks, the slate is "going to individually meet
with all the senators, and try to find out exactly what kind
of beer they like."
Slate member Tim Quirk said the H & C's philosophy
was "Make love, not bylaws."
Among the special fee requests, only the Chaparral, the
Course Guide and the second sections of the Axe Com
mittee and the Band were voted down. Special fee re

quests require simple majorities to pass.
In the undergraduate senate race, freshman Kd Ren
wick recieved the highest number of votes with 871. In the
graduate senate race, current Senate Chair Eric Berg was
the leader with 231 votes.
Many of the engineering and business, law and medicine
graduate senate seats will be filled by write-in candidates
who have until 9 p.m. tonight to submit declarations of in
tent in order to be eligible, according to Gross.
A runoff election will be held for Senior Class Presi
dents between the Slate of Mind and Macslate. The slates
garnered 209 and 204 votes, respectively, both failing to
win the necessary 51 percent of the vote.
The winners for the Student Conduct and Legislative
Council were, in order of number of votes, David Porter,
Larry "Bear" Bloch, Dave Hetzel and Thomas Fortin.
Gross said voter turnout this year was 6,172, a drop of
about 300 from last year. This number does not include
absentee ballots, all 10 of them, which Gross does not ex
pect to alter any of the results significantly.
Because of the number of votes cast on special fee re
quests, Gross speculates that they were what brought the
majority of people to the polls. More votes were cast for
the special fee requests than for any candidate or amend
ment.
This year s elections did have its share of problems, ac
cording to Gross. Several of the ballots were submitted in
ink and had to be re-filled out by members of the elections
commission so that the ballots could be counted.
Also, Gross referred two issues to the Elections

These issues were the "Dump

about the legality of the Stanford
College Republicans' publication of a
flier suggesting how its sympathizers
should vote.
The question revolves around
whether these fliers were paid for out
of the College Republicans' budget,
whether it need be disclosed as a

campaign expense and if so, by which
candidates, according to Gross.
Student voting habits followed
several patterns. Gross observed that
several voters voted "yes, no" al
ternately on all of the constitutional
amendments and special fee requests.
Many students voted for 10 under
graduate senators in succession, start
ing at various points on the list.
There was a substantial amount of
student response to the results. Black
Student Union Chair Steve Phillips
commented on H & Cs victory and
their plans to abolish the senate. "I
don't think they realize the repercus
sions such a move would have for stu
dent groups," he said.
Senator Mark Soble, author and

sponsor of the amendment to elimi
nate cash special fee refunds, was not
disheartened by his bill's defeat. "1
think students will approve some
thing along these lines within the next
five years. They are going to be
forced to if the special fee system is to
remain solvent," said Soble.
The following write-in candidates
for graduate senate positions have
until 9 p.m. to submit declarations of
intent to the elections commission:
Zenon Kuc, Ramu Avva and Russell
Quong from the engineering district;
Gordon Meyer, Artise Hardy, Mark
Blanton, Susan Scheiber, Mark
Umlas and Ted Cooperstein from the
business, law and medicine district.
