## Card will try to sweep Bruins again 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
Six weeks ago, the Stanford baseball team traveled to
Los Angeles to play UCLA in an early Pacific 10 South
ern Division series. The Cardinal was ranked sixth in the
nation; the Bruins were seventh. At stake was the lead in
the Six-Pac — Stanford was 3-0, UCLA 5-1.
It is hard to call such an early series pivotal to a team's
season, but for both the Cardinal and the Bruins, this was
the case. Stanford swept the three games at Jackie Robin
son Stadium to open up a 2'/2-game lead over UCLA.
Since then, the Cardinal has rolled to a 14-4 Six-Pac
record — good for a two-game lead over California. Stan
ford has also vaulted to the top of the national rankings.
The Bruins have sank as far as the Cardinal has risen.
The sweep started UCLA on an 11-game conference
losing streak that ended only last Sunday against Cal.
This weekend UCLA will try to get revenge as it comes
to Sunken Diamond for a three-game series beginning
today at 2:30 p.m.
Despite their recent problems, Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess is wary of the Bruins. "You hope you dpn't
catch them on a good weekend," he said. "They're incon
sistent, but that's what happens when you have a young
team."
Also, according to Marquess, there are no easy wins in
the Six-Pac. "If you don't play well in our league, the last
place team can sweep you," he said.
"USC and UCLA are similar," Marquess said.
"They're very good, but they're very young. They're
gonna be good, but they're also gonna be up and down."
In March the Cardinal was able to keep the Bruins
down mainly thanks to three complete-game pitching per

formances by Rob Wassenaar, Jeff Ballard and Jack
McDowell. McDowell was especially effective, hurling a
four-hit shutout with seven strikeouts.
To beat Stanford this time. UCLA will have to score a
lot more than the four runs it did last month. Right fielder
John Joslyn, hitting .356, and catcher Todd Zeile (.328)
are two players coach Gary Adams is counting on for run
production.
Designated hitter Steve Hisey is the Bruins' top power
man. He has seven home runs along with 32 RBls and a
.307 average. He was UCLA's most effective hitter
against Stanford in the first series, going 4-for-10 with two
RBls.
Beating Stanford anywhere has been tough this year,
but the Cardinal has been extremely tough at home. Stan
ford is 16-4 at Sunken Diamond — 8-2 in conference
games.
Marquess has no secret for his team's success at home.
"Sunken Diamond isn't especially advantageous to us
with short fences or anything. It's a very fair park," he
said. "The difference in this year's team is that we've
played well on the road."
Adams will probably sent his three top game-winners to
the mound against the Cardinal — Eric Nolte (6-2, 6.87
ERA), Scott Kershaw (3-2, 5.80) and Alex Sanchez (3-4,
4.21).
Marquess is impressed by Sanchez, a freshman. "Along
with McDowell, he's one of the top young pitchers
around," he said.
Ballard (8-2, 3.63) will pitch today for Stanford, and
Wassenaar (6-1, 4.48) will go tomorrow at 1 p.m.
McDowell (7-3, 3.98) will pitch the series finale Sunday.
