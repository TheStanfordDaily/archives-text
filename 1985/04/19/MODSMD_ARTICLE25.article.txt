# NCAA proposals for new penalties met favorably here

### GEOFF SANBORN Editorial staff 
For schools like Tulane, Florida
and Arizona State with a history of
naughtiness in their athletic pro
grams, the proposed "gas cham
ber" rules approved by the NCAA
Council Wednesday are probably
causing a lot of somber faces and
hushed conversations. But at Stan
ford, where hands are a little
cleaner, the mood is different.
"I don't really know much
about it," said Cardinal Football
Coach Jack Elway yesterday after
noon. "1 kind of skimmed over it
in the paper this morning."
In case you missed it, too, here's
a brief summary of what the
NCAA proposed, what one
NCAA observer called the
"athletic equivalent of the death
penalty." Violations will be
divided into major and secondary

infractions.
Major infractions — those that
show a repeated pattern of willful
wrong-doing and give a school a
clear competitive advantage —
will receive the minimum penalty
of a two-year probation and a one
year ban on recruiting (both off
and on-campus), on post-season
competition and on television ap
pearances.
Secondary infractions — those
that are isolated or technical in na
ture and provide a limited advan
tage — could result in the perman
ent ineligibility of athletes, for
feiture of games, a one-year
prohibition on off-campus recruit
ing, a 20 percent reduction in the
number of scholarships the school
can offer in the affected sport and
a fine ranging from $500 to
$5,000.
And that's not the worst of it. Two
major violations within five years will
mean the following: The offending
school cannot compete above the in
tramural level for one or two years in
the sport involved in the latest viola
tion, the entire coaching staff cannot
coach anywhere for two years, and no
scholarships or recruiting will be
allowed for two years.
Once Elway had been filled in on
the details, he gave his qualified sup
port to the proposals.
"I think it's good," he said, "but I
don't see enough in there about the
recruits. I think the damn recruits and
their parents should be penalized
more heavily. It generally takes two
to tango, doesn't it?"
Athletic Director Andy Geiger was
pleased with the NCAA proposal.
"We're supportive of the direction
the NCAA is going in," he said yes
terday. "I've thought for years we
should start recodifying the rules so
its clear what kind of jeopardy
schools can get into."
Geiger said he would be at the spe
cial NCAA convention in New Or
leans June 20-21, when the proposal
will be voted on, and it appears likely
that he will cast his vote in favor of
the measure.
