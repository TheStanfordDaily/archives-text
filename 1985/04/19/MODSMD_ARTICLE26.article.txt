# Netters down UA, USC next
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
The Stanford women's tennis team was near top form
long enough yesterday to clinch its match early against
Arizona by winning five of six singles matches. The
doubles, however, were a different story, and the nth
ranked Wildcats swept all three to make the final score 5-
4.
But second-ranked Stanford, 22-1 overall and 9-1 in
the WCAA, had an excuse, and a legitimate one at that.
Top-ranked USC is coming to town tomorrow.
"We were very unintense in the doubles," Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan admitted. "I think we were really
looking towards USC."
The two teams have already met twice this season, with
USC winning 5-4 in Los Angeles last month and Stanford
winning by the same score Sunday at the Longhorn-
Kaepa Tennis Classic in Austin, Texas. Tomorrow's
match will be the teams' third, with a possible fourth and
final meeting coming at the NCAAs next month.
"You have the top two programs in the country going at
it," Brennan said of tomorrow's match, which will start at
noon on the three grandstand courts at Stanford Tennis
Stadium. "This match usually decides who gets the No. 1
seed at the NCAAs."
Ironically, in the two previous Stanford-USC matches
this year, the team with more injured players has won. At
USC last month, the Trojans played without No. 2 netter
Heliane Ste.den, who was sidelined with a stress fracture in
her foot. Then, minutes into the match, Caroline


Todd Sitrin/Daily
Kay Tittle reached out for this return, but she and Stephanie Savides, moving up from
third to first doubles, lost to Arizona's Jill Smoller and Susan Russo, 6-2, 6-4.
Kuhlman sprained her ankle and was
forced to default at No. 1 singles.
When the teams met Sunday in the
final of the Longhorn tournament, it

was the Cardinal that was weakened
by illnesses and injuries. Freshmen
Anna Ivan and Can Hagey missed
the trip with a bad virus and a bad
shoulder, respectively. Senior Linda
Gates made it, but tendinitis in her
left knee limited her to doubles action
only.
Tomorrow's match should be inter

esting because although both teams
won't be at full health, they should be
close to it. Steden is back in USC's
lineup, but Kuhlman is still out. Stan
ford's Ivan and Gates have recovered
enough to play, but neither is at 100
percent.
In the most recent set of rankings,
USC is still rated one notch ahead of
Stanford since the rankings do not
reflect last weekend's texas tourna
ment. Nonetheless, Brennan con
siders his team the favorite tomor
row.
"We're going to be at home," he
said. "We're 1-1 against USC this
season, but I think we've got to have
the edge after beating them on a
neutral court."
For what it's worth, tomorrow's
match will also have a bearing on the
WCAA race. USC is undefeated in
conference play while Stanford has
lost once — to the Trojans. A Stan
ford victory tomorrow would tie it
with USC for the conference title, as
suming neither team is upset in the
remaining matches of the season.
Against Arizona yesterday, the
Cardinal probably would have swept
all six singles matches had blisters not
forced junior Alyce Werdel to default
her No. 6 singles match after she won
the second set 6-1 and was ahead 1-0
in the third.
Stanford netters won the other five
matches in straight sets, including
Patty Fendick over Jill Smoller at No.
1 singles.

Leigh Anne Eldredge, ranked seventh nationally in singles, handily won
her match over Arizona's Chris Seifert at No. 2 singles, 6-0, 6-1.
