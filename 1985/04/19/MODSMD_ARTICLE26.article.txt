# Netters down UA, USC next

### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
The Stanford women's tennis team was near top form
long enough yesterday to clinch its match early against
Arizona by winning five of six singles matches. The
doubles, however, were a different story, and the nth
ranked Wildcats swept all three to make the final score 5-
4.
But second-ranked Stanford, 22-1 overall and 9-1 in
the WCAA, had an excuse, and a legitimate one at that.
Top-ranked USC is coming to town tomorrow.
"We were very unintense in the doubles," Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan admitted. "I think we were really
looking towards USC."
The two teams have already met twice this season, with
USC winning 5-4 in Los Angeles last month and Stanford
winning by the same score Sunday at the Longhorn-
Kaepa Tennis Classic in Austin, Texas. Tomorrow's
match will be the teams' third, with a possible fourth and
final meeting coming at the NCAAs next month.
"You have the top two programs in the country going at
it," Brennan said of tomorrow's match, which will start at
noon on the three grandstand courts at Stanford Tennis
Stadium. "This match usually decides who gets the No. 1
seed at the NCAAs."
Ironically, in the two previous Stanford-USC matches
this year, the team with more injured players has won. At
USC last month, the Trojans played without No. 2 netter
Heliane Ste.den, who was sidelined with a stress fracture in
her foot. Then, minutes into the match, Caroline

Kay Tittle reached out for this return, but she and Stephanie Savides, moving up from
third to first doubles, lost to Arizona's Jill Smoller and Susan Russo, 6-2, 6-4.
