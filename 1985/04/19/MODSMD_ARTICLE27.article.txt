## Underclassmen to BYU tourney 
### KEN STEVENS Staff sportswriter 
Although the Stanford men's golf
team is currently playing the most im
portant part of its schedule to date
while tuning up for next month's Na
tionals in Florida, Cardinal Coach
Tim Schaaf is already taking some
time to look ahead to next season.
Today and tomorrow at the Brig
ham Young tournament, Schaaf will
play the Cardinal's six underclassmen
— juniors Phil Rowley, Carl Wagner
and Don Walsworth, sophomores
Rich Marik and Cole Thompson, and
freshman John Dickey. The team's
four seniors — Lew Dickey, Scott
Erickson, Tim Robinson and Doug
Thompson — will get a well-deserved
rest prior to next week's demanding
schedule.
Schaaf indicated that he is playing
the underclassmen to see how they
will perform as a unit, because the six
will form the nucleus of next year's
team.
If last week's results are any indica
tion, the Cardinal men should fare
well at BYU this weekend. At the
Stanford U.S. Intercollegiate last
on the Stanford Golf

Course, the Cardinal captured second
place with Marik, Walsworth and
Wagner finishing second, third and
fourth, respectively, in the individual
competition.
Following the BYU tournament,
the Cardinal golfers will play in two
prestigious tournaments within seven
days. Next weekend they compete in
the Sun Devil Invitational at Scot
tsdale, Ariz. Then, after a brief, one
day layoff, they begin play in the
Pacific 10 Conference Champion
ships in Pullman, Wash.
Though Stanford has all but
clinched a berth in the Nationals,
Schaaf said the Cardinal men have
plenty to shoot for in the next few
tournaments. He explained that a vic
tory over rival San Jose State at the
Sun Devil Invitational would give the
Cardinal a victory the Spartans
in the season series and the "local
bragging rights."
Moreover, a Cardinal victory at the
Pac-10 championships would greatly
add to Stanford's reputation, accord
ing to Schaaf, because the Pac-10 is
considered to be among the toughest
conferences in collegiate golf.
