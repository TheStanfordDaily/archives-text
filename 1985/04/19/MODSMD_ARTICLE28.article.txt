# Cardinal track hosts Northridge
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's and women's
track teams will approach tomorrow's
home dual meet against Cal State-
Northridge more to test their self
improvement and character than to
concentrate solely on their fifth vic
tories of the season.
Cardinal Head Coach Brooks
Johnson has elected to shuffle around
some of his usual lineups for this meet
to ensure a "quantum leap in devel
opment."
Most of the changes will occur in
the women's distance events, as
senior Ellen Lyons, NCAA qualifier
in both the 5,000 and 10,000 meters,
will not run her proven specialities.
Substitutions in the men's hammer
throw will probably be unlikely,
though, as Stanford's two NCAA
qualifiers, Brian Masterson and
Shaun Pickering, will confront
Northridge's Aaron Buckholtz and
Rick Meyers, owners of the top ham

mer tosses in NCAA Division 11.
As always, Johnson hopes for im
provement. "Same goals all the time
— kids try to be successful as they
can. It's not necessary to win or lose,
just the best job that you can," he
said.
"My expectations are not critical.
It's whether the kids [are] maximizing
their potential — the rest of it is just
fluff," said Johnson, who viewed
first- and last-place finishes only as
by-products.
Johnson put the Northridge meet,
and any other meet for that matter,
into stark perspective. "We have
starvation, pollution in the atmos
phere, threats of nuclear
holocausts. .. .You just can't get too
excited about kids running around in
a circle.
"Even if we beat a UCLA by a
thousand points, we're still going
have suffocation, starvation and nu
clear holocaust threats."
