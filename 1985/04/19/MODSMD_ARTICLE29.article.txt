# Stanford heads south to face UCLA, USC
## Tough pair for men netters 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's tennis team got
by its USC and UCLA matches in the
first round of Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division competition,
losing 5-4 to USC and defeating
UCLA by the same score.
This weekend is the true test for
the Cardinal, however. Stanford must
beat both teams away today and to
morrow to retain its No. 1 national
standing and secure a high seed in the
NCAA championships.
Stanford first received the No. 1
ranking after it defeated USC 6-3
earlier this season in the finals of the
Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches Asso
ciation Team Championship. The
Cardinal has kept possesion of the
top spot in the current Head Intercol
legiate Tennis Standings despite the
upset loss to the No. 2 Trojans two
weeks ago.
So the teams go into tomorrow's
match 1-1 this season with the top
ranking in the country on the line and
thoughts about the eventual outcome
of the NCAA championship match
floating about.
The NCAA race is further compli
cated by 1984's defending champion
UCLA — a team that has beaten
USC twice this year and came very
close to defeating Stanford in the in
door match played in Maples
Pavilion.
It would be nice for Stanford to
come out of the three-way logjam
ahead of the other two and still No. 1.
But more than a few tough matches
will have to be played to determine
who will be the odd team out.
For Stanford, avoiding that fate
will most certainly include winning
more than one of the three doubles

matches — something which it did
not do in both matches the first time
around.
Against USC, Stanford's No. 1
doubles team of Dan Goldie and Jim
Grabb lost to Todd Witsken and
Jorge Lozano in three sets. Lozano
and Witsken are ranked No. 1 in the
country by the HITS poll, and are un
defeated in 17 dual matches.
Stanford also lost the second
doubles match. Derrick Rostagno
and Pat McEnroe were defeated by
USC's Rick Bengston and Antony
Emerson 6-7, 6-4, 6-4.
"Derrick and Pat are either terrible
or very good. You never know how
they will play on a given day," Stan
ford Coach Dick Gould said.
Normally, USC plays Ricky Leach
and Tim Pawsat, ranked sixth nation
ally, in No. 2 doubles, but Pawsat was
out of the lineup in the first meeting
between Stanford and USC with a
pulled groin muscle.
The injury has apparently healed,
however, and Pawsat is expected to
return to competition in tomorrow's
match.
Gould has said all season that the
key to beating good teams like USC
and UCLA is winning the doubles
matches. The Cardinal is in no differ
ent position this time around but will
also have to deal with large Los An
geles crowds and the now-full USC
lineup.
Gould seems confident that his
team will come out of the weekend's
matches well. "We have to win two
out of three doubles but I think we're
capable of doing that," he said.
"These are obviously two important
matches for us and I think we can do
well."

John Letts, ranked third in the nation in doubles with Jim Grabb and
32nd in singles, will lead the Cardinal in a pair of matches against Six-
Pac rivals UCLA and USC.
