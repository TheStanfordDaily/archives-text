# Faculty minority count drops
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
In a report he referred to as "revealing and dis
appointing." Provost James Rosse told the Faculty
Senate yesterday that the total of tenure-line fac
ulty members from racial minorities at Stanford has
dropped to its lowest level since 1978-79.
Assoc. Dean of Graduate Studies and Research
Albert Gelpi, in his affirmative action report on
graduate students and on academic staff research,
also told the senate that although minority applica
tions had increased by 5 percent, both admissions
and enrollment had declined.
The decline was roughly the same as at other
schools around the nation. "The fact that Stanford
is holding its own with comparable institutions in
this matter cannot be a matter of self
congratulation. hut only of renewed determination
to do better than our not-so-good [efforts]." Gelpi
said.
In 1983-84, only one minority faculty member
was promoted to tenure, while eight left for various
reasons, leaving a total of 74 minority faculty mem
bers. Of those leaving, four are Hispanic, three are
Asians and one is black, according to Rosse's

report on faculty-attirrnative action. The total num
ber of tenure-line faculty declined by eight from
last year's high of 1,129.
Minority appointments since 1975 peaked in the
mid-80s during the 1982-83 academic year. At the
current level, minority appointments make up less
than 7 percent of the total.
Most of the loss took place in the humanities, ac
cording to Rosse. In 1984-85, six tenured minority
faculty members were lost in the humanities,
lowering the total number of tenured minority fac
ulty members in that department to 9 percent.
The number of women promoted to tenure-line
positions dropped from 53 to 52 during the 1984-
85 year, according to the report. Women in tenure
rank positions currently constitute 40 percent of all
female professors at Stanford.
Since 1975, there has been a steady increase in
the number of appointments of women to these
positions. Currently, 119 women have been ap
pointed to tenure-line positions, 10 percent of all
appointments to tenure-line rank.
The percent of women of those recruited has
shown a steady increase since 1974-75, Rosse said.
At this point, around 20 percent of new appoint
ments are women, he said.

"We have not turned the corner yet," Rosse said.
"We're several years away from making a large
number of (women and minority) appointments."
Rosse cited "reaching out for human resources
wherever they are" as a reason for affirmative ac
tion at the faculty level. Rosse also said affirmative
action "greatly increases and enhances" teaching.
"Stanford has dedicated itself to attracting and
having tomorrow's leaders," he said. "We need to
reach out to these groups . . . and provide them
with role models." The faculty needs to be able to
deal with all types of students, he said.
He also cited the Provost Affirmative Action
fund as a source of money to aid in the funding of
minority appointments. The purpose of the Affirm
ative Action fund is to sustain and enhance depart
ments and to realize that a good candidate may not
exactly match department needs, he said.
Rosse said, "The search (for minority appoint
ments) needs to be carried out with thoroughness
and care."
Gelpi's report on graduate student affirmative
action figures for fall 1984 showed "targeted
minorities as slightly down in the total graduate en-
rollment from the previous year:
from 397 to 385, or from 5.9 percent
of the total graduate enrollment to
5.7 percent."
"Only American Indians showed
increased number.s: a 20 percent
jump, from 25 in 1983 to 30 in
1984," he said.
Gelpi said, "The more disturbing
fact for the same period is that al
though our office is pleased that
minority applications increased last
year by an encouraging 5 percent,
minority admissions dropped by 12
percent, and new minority enroll
ments by 21 percent, that is, from 128
in fall 1983, to 101 in fall 1984."
He cited medicine as having the
largest decline, from 54 percent of 54
admits in 1983 to less than 50 percent
of 25 admits in 1984.
Recruitment of women was "the
reverse of that of minorities," Gelpi
said. "There were fewer applications
last year, but slightly more women
admitted and enrolled."
Fall 1984 statistics cited women
students as representing 25 percent in
the business school, 39 percent
in the law school and 32 percent in
the medical school, according to
Gelpi.

Rosse cited "reaching out for human resources
wherever they are" as a reason for affirmative ac
tion at the faculty level. Rosse also said affirmative
action "greatly increases and enhances" teaching.
"Stanford has dedicated itself to attracting and
having tomorrow's leaders," he said. "We need to
reach out to these groups . . . and provide them
with role models." The faculty needs to be able to
deal with all types of students, he said.
He also cited the Provost Affirmative Action
fund as a source of money to aid in the funding of
minority appointments. The purpose of the Affirm
ative Action fund is to sustain and enhance depart
ments and to realize that a good candidate may not
exactly match department needs, he said.
Rosse said, "The search (for minority appoint
ments) needs to be carried out with thoroughness
and care."
Gelpi's report on graduate student affirmative
action figures for fall 1984 showed "targeted
minorities as slightly down in the total graduate en-
rollment from the previous year:
from 397 to 385, or from 5.9 percent
of the total graduate enrollment to
5.7 percent."
"Only American Indians showed
increased number.s: a 20 percent
jump, from 25 in 1983 to 30 in
1984," he said.
Gelpi said, "The more disturbing
fact for the same period is that al
though our office is pleased that
minority applications increased last
year by an encouraging 5 percent,
minority admissions dropped by 12
percent, and new minority enroll
ments by 21 percent, that is, from 128
in fall 1983, to 101 in fall 1984."
He cited medicine as having the
largest decline, from 54 percent of 54
admits in 1983 to less than 50 percent
of 25 admits in 1984.
Recruitment of women was "the
reverse of that of minorities," Gelpi
said. "There were fewer applications
last year, but slightly more women
admitted and enrolled."
Fall 1984 statistics cited women
students as representing 25 percent in
the business school, 39 percent
in the law school and 32 percent in
the medical school, according to
Gelpi.
