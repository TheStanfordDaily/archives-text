NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Tulane University's
Board of Administrators voted unanimously yes
terday to end the 72-year-old basketball program
that this year caused the school its worst embar
rassment ever over charges involving fixed games,
drugs and illegal payments to players.
Players and other students are alleged to have
been involved in a point-shaving gambling scheme
to rig two games last February.
"I'm saddened and disappointed by the events
that have taken place and the necessity for taking
this action," said Tulane President Eamon Kelly,
who had recommended the abolition of the men's
basketball program.
Board Chairman Boatner Riley said the adminis

trators felt that "under the circumstances, Dr.
Kelly took exactly the appropriate action" with his
recommendation, which earlier this week was over
whelmingly approved by the school's senate.
Tulane teams played almost 1,400 games since
the school started intercolllegiate basketball in
1912.
Riley would not discuss the possibility that the
program might be revived at some later date.
However, Kent McWilliams, chairman of the In
tercollegiate Athletics Committee, said he hopes it
can be resumed.
"I told them that after the studies and all, we are
going to double our efforts and we are going to end
up with a program that suits the academic program

at Tulane. We are going to re-earn our credibility
and we'll be back to them."
Two members of last season's team are under in
dictment for point shaving. Another player pleaded
guilty in the conspiracy, and two are testifying
against their former teammates. Five others were
indicted in the gambling scandal: three students, a
convicted bookmaker and a young man accused of
being a courier for bribed money.
Cocaine is alleged to have been involved in the
scheme.
Athletic Director Hidman Wall, Coach Ned
Fowler and two assistant basketball coaches have
resigned. Kelly said Fowler admitted paying at least
one player for playing.
Wall has denied any knowledge of it.
