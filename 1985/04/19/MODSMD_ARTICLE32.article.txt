## Stanford softball drops three in Reno 
### DAVE DUTCHER Senior sportswriter 
Thanks to some big innings by three oppo
nents at the Reno Invitational yesterday, the
Stanford softball team suddenly has a seven
game losing streak.
The Cardinal, which lost its last four Western
Collegiate Athletic Association games Saturday
and Wednesday to Long Beach State and San
Diego State, lost three more yesterday in the
six-team tournament.
Portland State was the first to defeat Stan
ford, 9-0. Then came Nevada-Reno, 4-0, and
Hayward State, 8-1. Adding insult to injury is
the fact that Stanford has scored but three runs
in its past five games.
The Cardinal, 10-43, will play Oregon and St.
Mary's today at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., but it wasn't
known last night which game would be first.
Depending on its seeding, Stanford may also
play at 3:30 p.m. in the single-elimination
playoff that will follow round-robin play and
determine the tournament champion.
Portland State got to Cardinal starter and
losing pitcher Betsy Watson for five fourth
inning runs on five hits to take a 6-0 lead before
it got three in the fifth on four hits off Lisa Buc
hanan. For the game, Portland State had 14
hits.
Ronda Haun held Stanford to two hits, K.K.

Bush's second-inning single and Buchanan's
seventh-inning single.
Nevada-Reno, which had seven hits, scored
its runs in a five-hit third off loser Buchanan, 5-
19. The Cardinal missed a chance to score in the
fourth, coming up empty-handed after having
the bases loaded with none out.
In that inning, Laura Buchanan got one of her
two singles to lead off the inning and went to
second on Lisa Buchanan's single.
Monique Bautista loaded the bases with a
single, but any big-inning hopes died when
Maria De La Rosa flied out and Laura Buc
hanan was out at third after not tagging up.
Anna Sanchez's flyout ended the inning.
Two big innings propelled Hayward State,
which got three runs in the first and four in the
third. Watson, 5-24, took her second loss of the
day.
Stanford had six hits — three by Bautista and
two by Sanchez — against Hayward State.
The Cardinal got its run in the fourth when
Lisa Buchanan singled and went to second on
Bautista's single. Hayward State catcher Maren
Foster's throw to pick Bautista off first was er
rant, enabling Bautista and Lisa Buchanan to
advance one base.
After De La Rosa popped up, Sanchez sin
gled Lisa Buchanan home. A groundout and a
flyout ended the threat.
