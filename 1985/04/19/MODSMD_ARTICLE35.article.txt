## Ram's Head delivers 'Sweeney Todd' with bravado A 						talented cast carries off a powerful drama that is far from typical 
### RICHARD LANG 
If you're planning on attending the
Stanford production of "Sweeney
Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet
Street," be prepared for a big
surprise. This is not a typical Stanford
Spring Musical. I was under the im
pression that powerful emotion,
serious moral dilemmas and the ever
present darkness that accompanies
death were not descriptions that
Ram's Head considered when choos
ing a musical. I'm happy to say that
I'm wrong. A bold step has been
taken in moving from the traditional
upbeat, toe-tapping productions such
as "Anything Goes" and "Hello,
Dolly" to a serious, compelling
drama that has your heart, rather
than your feet, doing the pounding.
My congratulations to whoever in
itiated this move. Though the show is
plagued somewhat by a less-than
interesting musical score, an ex
tremely strong plot is carried off
skillfully by a wide range of talented
performers. My recommendation
goes out to anyone who enjoys
serious drama as well as to the tradi
tional musical goer who is ready for a
change.
The story line of "Sweeney Todd"
is fairly simple. Sweeney Todd, a bar
ber, returns from exile to his
hometown of London in hopes of a
joyful reunion with his wife and his
now-grown daughter, Johanna. He
arrives to find that his wife has
poisoned herself, and his daughter
has been made ward of the evil and
powerful Judge Turpin, who
originally sentenced Todd many years
ago. Todd, assuming a new identity,
returns to his post as a barber and
vows revenge on those who have
deceived him. When Todd is forced

to kill a potential blackmailer who
recognizes him from years ago, the
problem arises of how to dispose of
the body. With the help of Mrs.
Lovett, a local pastry merchant and
Todd's landlord, the two hit upon the
idea to use the dead men in Mrs.
Lovett's meat pies. Soon, a successful
business partnership has begun, with
Todd giving his customers too close a
shave and Mrs. Lovett inviting them
to dinner — as the main course. The
chilling and horrifying climax is
reached when fate finally gives Todd
the opportunity of revenge for which
he longs.

In the role of Sweeney Todd, Peter
Vilkin, while giving a strong perfor
mance, has a definite weakness as a
lead. His characterization of Todd
starts off too slowly, often lacking the
intense and fiery energy demanded of
it. Director Marc Fajer is mistaken in
not giving Vilkin more freedom to
use the entire stage. It would gener
ally enhance the positive visual
aspects of the play to see Todd as a
more active, expressive character.
Rather, his movements are confined
and overly subdued. The times when
Vilkin is allowed to be more explo
sive (his musical number
"Epiphany," for example) are chill

ing and powerful. These moments,
unfortunately, are too few and incon
sistently clustered at the end of each
act. Despite a couple of small pitch
problems, which I'm convinced were
nerves, Vilkin's obvious vocal talent
helps to cover what his character
. lacks, and on the whole he turns out a
fine performance.
By far my favorite character is that
of Mrs. Lovett, played very profes
sionally by Macall Dunahee. The bal
ance Dunahee draws between being
the cohort of Sweeney Todd in the
deadly meat-pie business and the
warm, maternal figure who takes
Tobias Ragg under her wing is su
perb. Her wit is finely tuned and
timely, yet does not distract from the
serious tone of the production. She is
a convincing performer with every
line and movement. When listening
( to Dunahee's finely tuned, poverty
class British accent, I was continually
reminded of such greats as "Oliver"
and "My Fair Lady." At times during
her vocal numbers, she was difficult
to understand, due in part to the com
plexity of the songs and a poor sound
system, as well as her own diction;
her singing, however, remained an
additional asset to the strongest char
acter in the show.
Alan De Clerck in the role of An
thony Hope, a sailor who befriends
Todd, wins big praise for his tender
and caring performance as the love
struck suitor. No woman could resist
the romantic charm that De Clerck
expressed. The humane element in
his character provides just enough
warmth to keep the show from
drowning in the continual horror of
death. His voice has a wonderfully

Auditorium.

natural quality to it, and his baritone
and tenor notes are a joy to hear. The
only problems appear during De
Clerck's duets with Paige Dooling, in
her role as Johanna. Dooling's
soprano notes, sung in an operatic
style, make it difficult to understand
what either character is singing. I fi
nally gave up trying, and just enjoyed
the two voices.
As for the rest of Dooling's charac
ter, I'm still at odds as to whether she
was wrong for the part, or the part
was just plain wrong. The character
and her actions were not consistent
with one another. Any woman who is
willing to kill a man without so much
as a flinch or second thought and then
elope with her lover needs to be a
much stronger individual. I realize
that an element of sweet, youthful in
nocence is trying to be maintained,
but the dissonance that emerges is
confusing. It's fortunate that the bulk
of Dooling's role relies on her vocal
'talent, for it is there that she shines.
Particular standouts in the
remainder of the cast include Tobias
Ragg and the Beggar Woman
(Andrew Barr and Chavela Bryant).
Barr smoothly transcends the change
from con artist, to servant boy, to
psychotic killer. He is genuine in all
the facets of his role. Bryant, too,
does a fine job with her representa

tion of the dark secrets that haunt this
particular period in fashion.
Special mention should be given to
Willam Marshall as Judge Turpin in
his musical number, "Johanna." His
moral struggle, while a bit overdone,
is still believable, and his voice is
wonderful. I could sit and listen to
him sing throughout the entire show.
As for Adolpho Pirelli and Beadle
Bamford (played by Michael McCall
and Paul Zawilski), much more
should have been done with both
roles.
My biggest gripe with the show as a
whole lies with the music. Stephen
Sondheim has written what often
seems non-musical, beyond the limits
that could be attributed to this being
an unusual show. This is very evident,
as the cast often has trouble with its
accuracy. Timing was occasionally off,
mostly because the show is full of
strange, often unpleasant rhythms
and vocalizations. There were some
standout numbers, notably "A Little
Priest" (Todd and Lovett), and the
final reprise of the "Ballad of
Sweeney Todd" (full chorus). As this
last number ended, I was completely
caught up in the powerful seriousness
of the scene. The intensity that the
chorus is able to produce is
phenomenal. I only wish that there
were more moments like this in the
show. This isn't a musical that you'll
leave with a particular song floating
through your head.
On the technical side of things,

congratulations are again in order.
David Stanton's set design lends the
perfect touch to the mood of the pro
duction. I'm sorry that the mass of
scaffolding was not used more

throughout the show, for when the
chorus was spread across all reaches
of the stage the energy was at its high
est. Setting the leads free to roam
more of the set would have increased

their performance, especially with
Todd himself.
I've yet to see a show in Memorial
Auditorium that I could completely
hear, and "Sweeney Todd" is no ex
ception. At times 1 could hear and
understand every Word, while at
other times I picked up nothing.
Whether a better sound system is
needed, or just a better sound design,
I don't know. But if you've seen any
thing in Mem Aud, this will come as
no surprise and can be overlooked.
If you're planning to see the show,
which I highly recommend, it is wise
to keep in mind a couple of sugges
tions. First, have a fairly good idea of
the plot beforehand. Take the time to
read the article in the program by
History Prof. Paul Seaver, entitled
"Who Was Sweeney Todd?" Because
a great deal of the story is told in
song, it is often lost among the poor
diction, sound problems, competing
action. Also, bring a jacket to the
show, as there is actually a wind that
blows through the auditorium. While
it does add to the overall effect of the
show, I didn't like being cold.
And most of all, be prepared for
something unusual — something very
different. Fajer has done a fine job of
bringing together one of the most
talented casts I've seen in a Stanford
production, and it promises to be a
winner. The show runs tonight and
tomorrow night, and also April 26
and 27. Tickets are available for $6 at
the Tresidder Ticket Office.

the cohort of Sweeney Todd in the
deadly meat-pie business and the
warm, maternal figure who takes
Tobias Ragg under her wing is su
perb. Her wit is finely tuned and
timely, yet does not distract from the
serious tone of the production. She is
a convincing performer with every
line and movement. When listening
( to Dunahee's finely tuned, poverty
class British accent, I was continually
reminded of such greats as "Oliver"
and "My Fair Lady." At times during
her vocal numbers, she was difficult
to understand, due in part to the com
plexity of the songs and a poor sound
system, as well as her own diction;
her singing, however, remained an
additional asset to the strongest char

Alan De Clerck in the role of An
thony Hope, a sailor who befriends
Todd, wins big praise for his tender
and caring performance as the love

his character provides just enough
warmth to keep the show from
drowning in the continual horror of
death. His voice has a wonderfully

natural quality to it, and his baritone
and tenor notes are a joy to hear. The
only problems appear during De
Clerck's duets with Paige Dooling, in
her role as Johanna. Dooling's
soprano notes, sung in an operatic
style, make it difficult to understand
what either character is singing. I fi
nally gave up trying, and just enjoyed
the two voices.
As for the rest of Dooling's charac
ter, I'm still at odds as to whether she
was wrong for the part, or the part
was just plain wrong. The character
and her actions were not consistent
with one another. Any woman who is
willing to kill a man without so much
as a flinch or second thought and then
elope with her lover needs to be a
much stronger individual. I realize
that an element of sweet, youthful in
nocence is trying to be maintained,
but the dissonance that emerges is
confusing. It's fortunate that the bulk
of Dooling's role relies on her vocal
'talent, for it is there that she shines.
Particular standouts in the
remainder of the cast include Tobias
Ragg and the Beggar Woman
(Andrew Barr and Chavela Bryant).
Barr smoothly transcends the change
from con artist, to servant boy, to
psychotic killer. He is genuine in all
the facets of his role. Bryant, too,
does a fine job with her representa

tion of the dark secrets that haunt this
particular period in fashion.
Special mention should be given to
Willam Marshall as Judge Turpin in
his musical number, "Johanna." His
moral struggle, while a bit overdone,
is still believable, and his voice is
wonderful. I could sit and listen to
him sing throughout the entire show.
As for Adolpho Pirelli and Beadle
Bamford (played by Michael McCall
and Paul Zawilski), much more
should have been done with both
roles.
My biggest gripe with the show as a
whole lies with the music. Stephen
Sondheim has written what often
seems non-musical, beyond the limits
that could be attributed to this being
an unusual show. This is very evident,
as the cast often has trouble with its
accuracy. Timing was occasionally off,
mostly because the show is full of
strange, often unpleasant rhythms
and vocalizations. There were some
standout numbers, notably "A Little
Priest" (Todd and Lovett), and the
final reprise of the "Ballad of
Sweeney Todd" (full chorus). As this
last number ended, I was completely
caught up in the powerful seriousness
of the scene. The intensity that the
chorus is able to produce is
phenomenal. I only wish that there
were more moments like this in the
show. This isn't a musical that you'll
leave with a particular song floating
through your head.
On the technical side of things,

congratulations are again in order.
David Stanton's set design lends the
perfect touch to the mood of the pro
duction. I'm sorry that the mass of
scaffolding was not used more

throughout the show, for when the
chorus was spread across all reaches
of the stage the energy was at its high
est. Setting the leads free to roam
more of the set would have increased

their performance, especially with
Todd himself.
I've yet to see a show in Memorial
Auditorium that I could completely
hear, and "Sweeney Todd" is no ex
ception. At times 1 could hear and
understand every Word, while at
other times I picked up nothing.
Whether a better sound system is
needed, or just a better sound design,
I don't know. But if you've seen any
thing in Mem Aud, this will come as
no surprise and can be overlooked.
If you're planning to see the show,
which I highly recommend, it is wise
to keep in mind a couple of sugges
tions. First, have a fairly good idea of
the plot beforehand. Take the time to
read the article in the program by
History Prof. Paul Seaver, entitled
"Who Was Sweeney Todd?" Because
a great deal of the story is told in
song, it is often lost among the poor
diction, sound problems, competing
action. Also, bring a jacket to the
show, as there is actually a wind that
blows through the auditorium. While
it does add to the overall effect of the
show, I didn't like being cold.
And most of all, be prepared for
something unusual — something very
different. Fajer has done a fine job of
bringing together one of the most
talented casts I've seen in a Stanford
production, and it promises to be a
winner. The show runs tonight and
tomorrow night, and also April 26
and 27. Tickets are available for $6 at
the Tresidder Ticket Office.


Macall Dunahee is convincing and ver^ professional in her role as Mrs.
Lovett, the proprietor of a deadly meat pie business who colludes with

If you're planning on attending the
Stanford production of "Sweeney
Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet
Street," be prepared for a big
surprise. This is not a typical Stanford
Spring Musical. I was under the im
pression that powerful emotion,
serious moral dilemmas and the ever
present darkness that accompanies
death were not descriptions that
Ram's Head considered when choos
ing a musical. I'm happy to say that
I'm wrong. A bold step has been
taken in moving from the traditional
upbeat, toe-tapping productions such
as "Anything Goes" and "Hello,
Dolly" to a serious, compelling
drama that has your heart, rather
than your feet, doing the pounding.
My congratulations to whoever in
itiated this move. Though the show is
plagued somewhat by a less-than
interesting musical score, an ex
tremely strong plot is carried off
skillfully by a wide range of talented
performers. My recommendation
goes out to anyone who enjoys
serious drama as well as to the tradi
tional musical goer who is ready for a
change.
The story line of "Sweeney Todd"
is fairly simple. Sweeney Todd, a bar
ber, returns from exile to his
hometown of London in hopes of a
joyful reunion with his wife and his
now-grown daughter, Johanna. He
arrives to find that his wife has
poisoned herself, and his daughter
has been made ward of the evil and
powerful Judge Turpin, who
originally sentenced Todd many years
ago. Todd, assuming a new identity,
returns to his post as a barber and
vows revenge on those who have
deceived him. When Todd is forced

to kill a potential blackmailer who
recognizes him from years ago, the
problem arises of how to dispose of
the body. With the help of Mrs.
Lovett, a local pastry merchant and
Todd's landlord, the two hit upon the
idea to use the dead men in Mrs.
Lovett's meat pies. Soon, a successful
business partnership has begun, with
Todd giving his customers too close a
shave and Mrs. Lovett inviting them
to dinner — as the main course. The
chilling and horrifying climax is
reached when fate finally gives Todd
the opportunity of revenge for which
he longs.

In the role of Sweeney Todd, Peter
Vilkin, while giving a strong perfor
mance, has a definite weakness as a
lead. His characterization of Todd
starts off too slowly, often lacking the
intense and fiery energy demanded of
it. Director Marc Fajer is mistaken in
not giving Vilkin more freedom to
use the entire stage. It would gener
ally enhance the positive visual
aspects of the play to see Todd as a
more active, expressive character.
Rather, his movements are confined
and overly subdued. The times when
Vilkin is allowed to be more explo
sive (his musical number
"Epiphany," for example) are chill

ing and powerful. These moments,
unfortunately, are too few and incon
sistently clustered at the end of each
act. Despite a couple of small pitch
problems, which I'm convinced were
nerves, Vilkin's obvious vocal talent
helps to cover what his character
. lacks, and on the whole he turns out a
fine performance.
By far my favorite character is that
of Mrs. Lovett, played very profes
sionally by Macall Dunahee. The bal
ance Dunahee draws between being
the cohort of Sweeney Todd in the
deadly meat-pie business and the
warm, maternal figure who takes

seems non-musical, beyond the limits
that could be attributed to this being
an unusual show. This is very evident,
as the cast often has trouble with its
accuracy. Timing was occasionally off,
mostly because the show is full of
strange, often unpleasant rhythms
and vocalizations. There were some
standout numbers, notably "A Little
Priest" (Todd and Lovett), and the
final reprise of the "Ballad of
Sweeney Todd" (full chorus). As this
last number ended, I was completely
caught up in the powerful seriousness
of the scene. The intensity that the
chorus is able to produce is
phenomenal. I only wish that there
were more moments like this in the
show. This isn't a musical that you'll
leave with a particular song floating
through your head.
On the technical side of things,

congratulations are again in order.
David Stanton's set design lends the
perfect touch to the mood of the pro
duction. I'm sorry that the mass of
scaffolding was not used more

throughout the show, for when the
chorus was spread across all reaches
of the stage the energy was at its high
est. Setting the leads free to roam
more of the set would have increased

their performance, especially with
Todd himself.
I've yet to see a show in Memorial
Auditorium that I could completely
hear, and "Sweeney Todd" is no ex
ception. At times 1 could hear and
understand every Word, while at
other times I picked up nothing.
Whether a better sound system is
needed, or just a better sound design,
I don't know. But if you've seen any
thing in Mem Aud, this will come as
no surprise and can be overlooked.
If you're planning to see the show,
which I highly recommend, it is wise
to keep in mind a couple of sugges
tions. First, have a fairly good idea of
the plot beforehand. Take the time to
read the article in the program by
History Prof. Paul Seaver, entitled
"Who Was Sweeney Todd?" Because
a great deal of the story is told in
song, it is often lost among the poor
diction, sound problems, competing
action. Also, bring a jacket to the
show, as there is actually a wind that
blows through the auditorium. While
it does add to the overall effect of the
show, I didn't like being cold.
And most of all, be prepared for
something unusual — something very
different. Fajer has done a fine job of
bringing together one of the most
talented casts I've seen in a Stanford
production, and it promises to be a
winner. The show runs tonight and
tomorrow night, and also April 26
and 27. Tickets are available for $6 at
the Tresidder Ticket Office.


Macall Dunahee is convincing and ver^ professional in her role as Mrs.
Lovett, the proprietor of a deadly meat pie business who colludes with
Sweeney Todd.
