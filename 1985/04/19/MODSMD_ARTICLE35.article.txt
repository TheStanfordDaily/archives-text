### RICHARD LANG 
If you're planning on attending the
Stanford production of "Sweeney
Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet
Street," be prepared for a big
surprise. This is not a typical Stanford
Spring Musical. I was under the im
pression that powerful emotion,
serious moral dilemmas and the ever
present darkness that accompanies
death were not descriptions that
Ram's Head considered when choos
ing a musical. I'm happy to say that
I'm wrong. A bold step has been
taken in moving from the traditional
upbeat, toe-tapping productions such
as "Anything Goes" and "Hello,
Dolly" to a serious, compelling
drama that has your heart, rather
than your feet, doing the pounding.
My congratulations to whoever in
itiated this move. Though the show is
plagued somewhat by a less-than
interesting musical score, an ex
tremely strong plot is carried off
skillfully by a wide range of talented
performers. My recommendation
goes out to anyone who enjoys
serious drama as well as to the tradi
tional musical goer who is ready for a
change.
The story line of "Sweeney Todd"
is fairly simple. Sweeney Todd, a bar
ber, returns from exile to his
hometown of London in hopes of a
joyful reunion with his wife and his
now-grown daughter, Johanna. He
arrives to find that his wife has
poisoned herself, and his daughter
has been made ward of the evil and
powerful Judge Turpin, who
originally sentenced Todd many years
ago. Todd, assuming a new identity,
returns to his post as a barber and
vows revenge on those who have
deceived him. When Todd is forced

to kill a potential blackmailer who
recognizes him from years ago, the
problem arises of how to dispose of
the body. With the help of Mrs.
Lovett, a local pastry merchant and
Todd's landlord, the two hit upon the
idea to use the dead men in Mrs.
Lovett's meat pies. Soon, a successful
business partnership has begun, with
Todd giving his customers too close a
shave and Mrs. Lovett inviting them
to dinner â€” as the main course. The
chilling and horrifying climax is
reached when fate finally gives Todd
the opportunity of revenge for which
he longs.

In the role of Sweeney Todd, Peter
Vilkin, while giving a strong perfor
mance, has a definite weakness as a
lead. His characterization of Todd
starts off too slowly, often lacking the
intense and fiery energy demanded of
it. Director Marc Fajer is mistaken in
not giving Vilkin more freedom to
use the entire stage. It would gener
ally enhance the positive visual
aspects of the play to see Todd as a
more active, expressive character.
Rather, his movements are confined
and overly subdued. The times when
Vilkin is allowed to be more explo
sive (his musical number
"Epiphany," for example) are chill

ing and powerful. These moments,
unfortunately, are too few and incon
sistently clustered at the end of each
act. Despite a couple of small pitch
problems, which I'm convinced were
nerves, Vilkin's obvious vocal talent
helps to cover what his character
. lacks, and on the whole he turns out a
fine performance.
By far my favorite character is that
of Mrs. Lovett, played very profes
sionally by Macall Dunahee. The bal
ance Dunahee draws between being
the cohort of Sweeney Todd in the
deadly meat-pie business and the
warm, maternal figure who takes
Tobias Ragg under her wing is su
perb. Her wit is finely tuned and
timely, yet does not distract from the
serious tone of the production. She is
a convincing performer with every
line and movement. When listening
( to Dunahee's finely tuned, poverty
class British accent, I was continually
reminded of such greats as "Oliver"
and "My Fair Lady." At times during
her vocal numbers, she was difficult
to understand, due in part to the com
plexity of the songs and a poor sound
system, as well as her own diction;
her singing, however, remained an
additional asset to the strongest char
acter in the show.
Alan De Clerck in the role of An
thony Hope, a sailor who befriends
Todd, wins big praise for his tender
and caring performance as the love
struck suitor. No woman could resist
the romantic charm that De Clerck
expressed. The humane element in
his character provides just enough
warmth to keep the show from
drowning in the continual horror of
death. His voice has a wonderfully


Macall Dunahee as Mrs. Lovett and Peter Vilkin as Sweeney Todd act together in a scene from "Sweeney
Todd." The musical plays tonight and Saturday, and then next weekend, on April 26 and 27, at Memorial
Auditorium.
