## Cal protest goes on as vacation begins 
### 
BERKELEY (AP) — As class
mates left for spring break, some
1,500 people rallied yesterday on the
steps of Sproul Hall at the University
of California in a protest against
South Africa's policies of apartheid.
"We're going to stay out here until
our demands are met," student John
Fox said. "We want the administra
tion to know that we are not giving
up."
Students, who have been
demonstrating for nine days, want
university regents to sell $1.7 billion
invested in companies doing business
in South Africa.
"You're an absolutely beautiful
sight," state Assembly Speaker Willie
Brown (D-San Francisco) told
demonstrators yesterday.
"I think it's abhorrent that the uni
versity policy is to continue investing
in companies doing business in South
Africa," said Brown, who sits on the
Board of Regents. "I'm frankly
ashamed of my fellow regents of the
University of California.
"If you keep up the level of
protests, you will start a wave that
will sweep the nation," he said.
"Every American needs to say, 'We
don't want any Americans doing any
business with South Africa.' "
Brown also indicated that a deci
sion by the university to divest would
have a favorable impact on the
legislature's view of its budget re
quest.
"If that (divestment) is the
response, then we should pass the
university budget," Brown said. "If

that is not the response, I think we
should pray for the university's soul."'
Anti-apartheid demonstrators
planned to meet in San Francisco to
morrow with other protesters for a
march and rally.
On Tuesday, police arrested 159
people in the largest single arrest of
protesters at the campus since 1964
in the heyday of the Free Speech
Movement.
As many as 5,000 people rallied at
noon Wednesday at Sproul Hall, the
administration building. Many stu
dents and teachers observed a
boycott of classes.
However, since attendance is not
taken, university officials said they
were unable to determine the effec
tiveness of the boycott.
There were also apartheid protests
at UC campuses in Santa Cruz, where
500 people demonstrated yesterday
in support of those arrested in
Berkeley, and in Santa Barbara,
where 300 people attended a noon
anti-apartheid rally Wednesday.
Similar sit-ins are under way at Co
lumbia in New York City and at Rut
gers in New Jersey.
Yesterday's demonstration at
Berkeley was joined by some 400
members of the International
Longshoremen's and Ware
housemen's Union who were in the
San Francisco Bay for a con
vention.
Eight years ago, regents rejected a
resolution calling for a complete
divestment of stocks in companies
doing business in South Africa.
