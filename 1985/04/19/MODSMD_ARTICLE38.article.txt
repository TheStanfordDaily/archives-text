## Hospital studies costs 
### LARRY WEBER 
In response to what Medical School
Dean David Korn called "major pres
sures in society to change established
patterns of health care delivery, to
reduce the rate of medical care cost,"
three task forces have been formed to
examine the Stanford Hospital's role
in these and other "hot issues."
The task forces, comprising
physicians and researchers from the
hospital, will report this spring on the
rols in primary care delivery and help
define future research and clinical di
rection to be taken in Nuclear Mag
netic Resonance (NMR) technology
and transplantation medicine. NMR
provides diagnosticians with detailed
photographs of the internal body
without me harmful radiation of X
rayji.
The first task force will deal with
primary care and has been set up to
help guide Stanford medicine, the
emphasis of which is advancing medi
cal technologies such as NMR and
transplantation medicine from the re
search lab to the clinical lab, into a
future where the emphasis is cost effi
ciency.
Because "teaching hospitals, like

Stanford and other medical schools,
are very expensive places to be sick,"
the hospital is not well equipped to
provide medical care cheaply, Korn
said.
In order for the medical program to
be profitable, the hospital must fill its
rooms. Because of its advanced abili
ties to diagnose and treat, Stanford
has to reach out to people who have
complex illnesses, which community
physicians may not be able to handle
because of limited facilities or knowl
edge, Korn said.
"We need to cast a very wide net to
get enough complicated diseases to
fill the hospital," he said.
One way in which to do this would
be to provide continuing education
and other incentives to community
doctors in return for referrals of their
most difficult cases to Stanford
Hospital, an option the primary care
task force is examining, Korn said.
This, however, poses a problem for
the medical school.
"You can't just train your medical
students on the small fraction of com
plex diseases that enter the hospital,"
he stated.
It is therefore vital that avenues for

learning outside Stanford Hospital be
available to students. "You need ex
amples of more common disease
forms to produce well-rounded doc
tors," he said.
"The task force is looking into
ways to maintain the economic
viability of the institution (the hospi
tal) and also provide outlets for our
teaching program outside of the
hospital," Korn said.
The NMR task force, Korn said,
must determine an administrative
structure which can incorporate the
research needs of Stanford scientists,
the burgeoning field of clinical NMR
and the fact of a rapidly growing and
changing technology. An original
plan proposed a large NMR center
for the campus, but Korn stressed
that such a facility might not fit these
criteria.
"If you look around the University,
you will see a number of NMR instru
ments being heavily used by scientists
as part of their ongoing research," he
said. "They need machines right in
their own work areas. For them,
having a big center would be useless."
Korn said that another potential
problem with a commitment to a
large NMR center is that the im
mense magnets used in taking body
images are the first of their kind, per
haps to be replaced by more efficient
models in the near future.
"You don't want your great big
center to be out of date on the morn
ing that the doors are open," he said.
"The focus of the task force is to find
a middle range of need."
According to Korn, the transfer of
NMR research knowledge to the
clinical realm will happen in an oper
ating facility at Stanford by late 1986,
enabling organ and metabolic reac
tion scans and studies never before
possible. Stanford currently has a
preliminary clinical laboratory in
Mountain View, which was rushed
into development by radiologists anx
ious to experiment with the technol
ogy, and by General Electric, a man

ufacturer of NMR imaging equip
ment.
Although it is NMR's recent ap
plicability that has spurred the task
force investigation, it is Stanford's
traditional expertise in the field of
immunology, Korn stated, that has
been the impetus for the task force on
transplantation medicine.
With the groundbreaking heart and
lung transplant program providing a
clinical foundation, kidney and bone
marrow transplantation represent a
next logical step for Stanford doctors
to take, Korn said.
"Bone marrow transplantation
really fits into our molecular genetic
research, with its emphases on can
cers and leukemias," he said.
According to Korn, the hindrance
to comprehensive transplantation
programs equivalent to the heart/lung
program has been the involuntary
segregation of surgeons,
pediatricians, immunologists and
other individuals who want such pro
grams for a thousand different
reasons.
