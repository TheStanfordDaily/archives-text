# Rally rips aid
## Students vow reply to Contra aid 
### MARK LAWRENCE Staff writer 
Approximately 180 people atten
ded a noon rally in White Plaza yes
terday to protest U.S. aid to the
Nicaraguan Contrasand to encourage
students to sign a pledge to demon
strate against any escalation of U.S.
military involvement in that country.
The rally, organized by the Emer
gency Response Network, came five
days before Tuesday's congressional
vote on President Reagan's proposed
$14 million "humanitarian aid" pack
age to the Contras, the rebels oppos
ing Nicaragua's Marxist Sandinista
government.
According to the proposal, the aid
is to be used for food, clothing and
medicine while peace negotiations
are taking place, but if peace is not
achieved within 60 days, the money
can be used for military purposes.
"The type of rhetoric that Reagan
has been giving about Nicaragua is
mind-boggling, said Raul Hinojosa,
a visiting fellow at the Food Research
Institute. Hinojosa attacked the
Reagan administration for what he
feels is an attempt to cover up the the
real, unpopular military nature of the
aid.
"What is really at question here is
whether the people will stand up to
the man who says trees cause pollu
tion and calls the MX a
•peacekeeper.' " Expressing his
belief that escalation of U.S. military
involvement could create a precedent
leading to outright war in C entral
America. Hinojosa added. "What 1
want to suggest to you now is that we

must make dear to our congressmen
how we are feeling and know the
watershed we are facing."
Hinojosa joined several other
speakers in urging students to sign
Pledge of Resistance cards commit
ting themselves to either legal protest
or non-violent civil disobedience.
More than 65,000 citizens in the
United States, including at least 50
members of the Stanford community,
had already signed before yesterday's
rally.
The Pledge of Resistance was or
ganized last ltfll by the network, a
nationwide coalition of religious,
peace and solidarity organizations.
One of those who has signed is
Rev. Byron Bland of United Campus
Christian Ministries, who told the
crowd yesterday,"I am angry about
Reagan — angry about the violation
of values that I hold dear. 1 think that
peace and justice [are] created by
people like you and me. I'm not ask
ing you to sign the pledge, but I'm
asking you to wrestle with the issue."
Scott Bohning, a graduate student
in civil engineering, said in support of
the pledge. "We want to show
Reagan that we're not snowed by his
rhetoric. It's very important that we
show the country how we feel about
this and not effectively endorse
what's happening."
In the final speech, an unidentified
speaker held a mask of Reagan's face
in front of his head and listed the
"democratic principles" that the
United States has violated in Central
