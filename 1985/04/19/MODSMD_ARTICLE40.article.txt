Suddenly, Last Summer (1959)
U.C.Theater, Berkeley
Tennessee Williams knew what he was
doing when he wrote this melodrama
about a young woman who tells a horrible
truth — that her homosexual cousin, a
poet, was cannibalized by the boys he
picked up casually on a North African
beach: He kept it short (it's a one-act),
and grotesque as it is, it plays well on
stage. But Gore Vidal, who adapted it for
the screen, and Joseph L. Mankiewicz,
who directed it (and whose tendency has
always been toward long-windedness),
stretched it out to 114 minutes, though
really it only sustains one's interest for an
hour. Elizabeth Taylor gives the role of
the beautiful truth-teller, Catherine
Holly, the good old Hollywood try, but
unlike other actresses playing Williams'
neurotic, fragile heroines (notably Vivien
Leigh in "A Streetcar Named Desire"
and Blythe Danner in the TV production
of "Eccentricities of a Nightingale"), she
doesn't soar, and so her hysterical mo
ments come across as stage madness.
Montgomery Clift is pretty dull as the
doctor (he was never any good at playing
respectable liberals), but Katharine Hep
burn, as the wealthy aunt who wants
Catherine lobotomized, is very funny in
the first half. Her unique accent and ec
centric physical graciousness turn out to
be perfect for the role; she exaggerates
them slightly, pulling certain words out of
her sentences — "dementia praecox,"
"Hong Kong," "Chicago" — as if she
found them weirdly fascinating, and ex
amining them amusedly. With Mercedes
McCambridge (who's quite dreadful) as
Catherine's weak, parasitic mother.
Plays Sunday with "The Glass
Menagerie" (TV version).
My Brilliant Career (1979)
Otero Lounge
Sybylla (Judy Davis, in a lively perfor
mance) is a rebellious spirit in turn-of
the-century rural Australia who is given a
temporary reprieve from farm life when
she is invited to visit her wealthy, stuffy
aunt. All the other women in her family
posture and say things like "Marriage
gives us respectability" and "1 prayed to
God for guidance," so we can see how in
dependent Sybylla is by comparison; did
she spring full-blown, we wonder, from
this conservative brood? This patchwork
of bits from "Little Women" and"The
Sound of Music" and various comedies of
the 19305, adapted by Eleanor Whit
combe from Miles Franklin's novel and
directed by Gill Armstrong, is rather
clumsily staged, and the role of Sybylla,
who flirts with writing and politics and
rejects the proposal of a decent, intelli
gent landowner (Sam Neill), is puzzling,
to say the least.
Plays Monday evening at 7:30.
Mrs. Soffel (1984)
U.C.Theater, Berkeley
Ron Nyswaner based his screenplay on
the true story of the wife of a prison war

den in turn-of-the-century Pittsburgh
who runs off with two brothers convicted
on a charge of murder. The director, Gil
lian Armstrong, and the two stars, Diane
Keaton and Mel Gibson, have welded the
sensational elements into a hard, dense,
pure film with something of the agonized
intensity of a Dostoevski novel. Kate Sof
fel is one of those characters who acts
with a kind of daring that is both im
pulsive and compulsive. She behaves in a
way that not only contradicts what she
knows to be legally wrong and under
stands to be abhorrent to society — like
Nora in "A Doll's House" — but also
removes her forever, she believes, from
God's mercy. Fascinated by the darkest
corner of human existence, she casts her
self into it, severing every tie to her old
life in a single motion. In Diane Keaton's
performance, Kate flies from fever to
fever; this actress has now climbed to the
highest plane in the pantheon of current

American actresses. Mel Gibson matches
Keaton's erotic intensity, but his sexual
potency here derives from a crippled
handsomeness, a passiveness; the two
have amazing rapport. Shot (exquisitely)
by Russell Boyd.
Plays today with "My Brilliant
Career."
The Cotton Club (1984)
Memorial Auditorium
The Cotton Club occupied a unique lo
cation at the crossroads of white society
and black culture (which met on the
whim of white savants), of gangland and
the New York aristocracy (which met as a
result of Prohibition). It's a great subject
for the movies: One imagines a
sumptuous, provocative, deliriously en
tertaining musical drama, filled with
fabulous numbers and scintillating per
sonalities and amazing incidents. But

Francis Ford Coppola, who directed
"The Cotton Club," had a different idea:
to star himself, star his technical razzle
dazzle and his spendthrift virtuosity —
nearly $50 million worth. The movie isn't
about the Cotton Club, any more than
"Apocalypse Now" was about Vietnam
or "The Outsiders" and "Rumble Fish"
were about teenagers. Written by Pulitzer
Prize-winner William Kennedy; with
Richard Gere and Diane Lane (as char
acters whose oddball love story obviously
doesn't belong in the movie); James
Remar as "Dutch" Schultz; Nicolas
Cage; Gregory and Maurice Hines and
Lonette McKee, whose joyous numbers
are almost always spoiled by Coppola's
disinterest in them; and Fred Gwynne,
Bob Hoskins and Julian Beck, who come
off well despite everything.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 and 9:30.
Top Hat (1935)
Kresge Auditorium
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers dance
to one of the four or five best film scores
ever written. The Irving Berlin songs in
clude "No Strings (Fancy Free)," "Isn't It
a Lovely Day (to Be Caught in the
Rain)?," "Top Hat, White Tie and
Tails," "Cheek to Cheek" and"The Pic
colino" — there isn't a bad apple in the
bunch, or an unmemorable dance. Fred
plays an American entertainer in London
who falls in love with Ginger and follows
her to Venice, where she wears her cele
brated satin-and-feathers ballroom gown
for their "Cheek to Cheek" pas de deux.
In "Isn't It a Lovely Day?," they dance in
a gazebo as rain falls all around them, and
in the inventive title number Astaire
leads a crew of men in formal dress in a
dance that turns on itself at the end, when
he uses his cane as a tommy gun and
mows the whole chorus down. ("Pennies
from Heaven" includes an hommage to
this moment.) Mark Sandrich directed a
script by Dwight Taylor and Allan Scott
— probably the best script Astaire and
Rogers were ever given; the supporting
cast features Edward Everett Horton,
Helen Broderick, Eric Blore and Erik
Rhodes (with a walk-on by Lucille Ball).
Plays tonight at 9.
Phantom India (1972)
U.C.Theater, Berkeley
Louis Malle begins his seven-part doc
umentary by explaining that though he
lived in India for months, training his
camera on everything he could discover,
he never felt he'd even started to unravel
the country's great mystery. We are the
beneficiaries of his quest, however, and
his refusal to interpret — to seize the

traditional omniscient point of view of
the documentarian — makes this one of
the most moral non-fiction films ever
made; it's comparable in this way to
James Agee's great literary document of
the Depression, "Let Us Now Praise Fa
mous Men." And it's altogether ex
traordinary.
Parts 1-3 play Monday.
The Garden of the Finzi-Continis
(1970)
York, San Francisco
The Finzi-Continis represent the
Jewish aristocracy in pre-war Ferrara;
this movie, adapted by Giorgio Bassani
and Vittorio De Sica from Bassani's
semi-autobiographical novel, shows us
the last gasps of that aristocracy, before
Mussolini snuffed it out. Muted yet vivid
— images whirl through your head years
after you think you've forgotten the film
— this picture marked a comeback for De
Sica, whose films after his neo-realist
masterpieces had been disappointments.
It was a triumph, but his last; he was dead
by 1974. Dominique Sanda (whose
beauty is other-worldly) and Helmut
Berger play the Finzi-Continis, and Lino
Capolicchio plays the Bassani part.
Plays Monday with "The Damned."
Southern Comfort (1981)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
Walter Hill made this fascinating film
about the causes and consequences of
violence, which, according to him and to
the screenwriters, Richard Kane and
David Giler, are synonymous. A National
Guard unit has been sent into the Bayou
swamps on war games; they steal some
Cajun canoes, and when their owners
return just as the guardsmen are crossing
river, and one clown "shoots" a volley of
blanks at them as a joke, the Cajuns
respond with real gunfire. At that point
the unit begins to fall apart, quarreling
among themselves about where the
blame lies. Never a unified group to start
with — these are not soldiers — they are
now eight men whose only common bond
is the increasing panic and paranoia they
feel as it becomes apparent that the vio
lence has not ended. Hill and the editor,
Freeman Davics, clamp the film in a vise
and keep tightening it; it is an impeccable
piece of craftsmanship, and on some level
it addresses issues raised by Vietnam, by
the Chicago Convention riots and Kent
State. (It is set in 1973.) The writers don't
develop the characters enough, but luck
ily the cast is full of distinctive actors:
Powers Boothe, Keith Carradine, Peter
Coyote, T.K.Carter, Lewis Smith, Les
Lannom and others. Andrew Laszlo shot

the picture in frosted, ghostly greens, and
the photography gets more and more
abstract as the movie goes on. With a su
perlative musical score by Ry Cooder.
Plays Monday with " Argie."
The Killer Elite'(l97s)
Cedar, San Francisco
Possibly the most extreme of Sam
Peckinpah's paranoid fantasies, this film,
which has a Marc Norman-Stirling Sillip
hant script (based on a Robert Rostand
novel called "Monkey in the Middle"),
posits James Caan as the Peckinpah alter
ego: a C.I.A. agent "retired" (i.e., shot
up) by his best friend who heals himself
and stages a comeback. Most of the Peck
inpah themes are present: friendship and
betrayal, the corruption and disinterest of
those in power, how to take the measure
of a man. It isn't a good picture, but it has
rapt, heart-stopping action sequences, in
cluding one behind the credits and one
involving a band of silver-robed Ninja
that is as exquisite a piece of moviemak
ing as any American director produced in
this period. Philip Lathrop's fine photog
raphy has the exotic use of color you of
ten find in a Peckinpah film, and there's a
solid central performance by James Caan,
who demonstrates his skill at communi
cating the frustration and pride of a
strong man suddenly forced to deal with
physical impairment.
Plays today and tomorrow with "The
Wild Bunch."
The Search (1948)
Cedar, San Francisco
The opening scenes are profoundly
moving: shots of refugee children from
Nazi concentration camps, responding
with suspicious fear to the efforts of
United Nations workers to feed and shel
ter them. The Red Cross ambulances ter
rify them; they associate vehicles like
these with the vans that carried other
children to the gas chambers. One child
hides the bread at dinner, in case he
should get no more; another runs away
from a friendly soldier and drowns. The
director, Fred Zinnemann (who made his
reputation on this film, and then went on
to direct "The Men," "The Member of
the Wedding," "High Noon," and"From
Here to Eternity"), employs his camera
as discreetly and unsensationally as possi
ble, though the narration keeps intruding
and telling us what we can see perfectly
well for ourselves. Unfortunately, after
this semi-documentary opening, the film
turns into a fairly sentimental (and con
ventional) tale of the efforts of a mother
(the soprano Jarmila Novotna) to track
down the son (Ivan Jandl) separated from
her during the war. It does have a fresh,
sweet performance from the boyish
young Montgomery Clift as an American
soldier, and a warm one from Aline Mac-
Mahon, the no-nonsense comedienne of
the 1920s and '30s, as one of the super
visors.
Plays Tuesday through Thursday with
"From Here to Eternity."

her to Venice, where she wears her cele
brated satin-and-feathers ballroom gown
for their "Cheek to Cheek" pas de deux.
In "Isn't It a Lovely Day?," they dance in
a gazebo as rain falls all around them, and
in the inventive title number Astaire
leads a crew of men in formal dress in a
dance that turns on itself at the end, when
he uses his cane as a tommy gun and
mows the whole chorus down. ("Pennies
from Heaven" includes an hommage to
this moment.) Mark Sandrich directed a
script by Dwight Taylor and Allan Scott
— probably the best script Astaire and
Rogers were ever given; the supporting
cast features Edward Everett Horton,
Helen Broderick, Eric Blore and Erik
Rhodes (with a walk-on by Lucille Ball).
Plays tonight at 9.
Phantom India (1972)
U.C.Theater, Berkeley
Louis Malle begins his seven-part doc
umentary by explaining that though he
lived in India for months, training his
camera on everything he could discover,
he never felt he'd even started to unravel
the country's great mystery. We are the
beneficiaries of his quest, however, and
his refusal to interpret — to seize the

traditional omniscient point of view of
the documentarian — makes this one of
the most moral non-fiction films ever
made; it's comparable in this way to
James Agee's great literary document of
the Depression, "Let Us Now Praise Fa
mous Men." And it's altogether ex
traordinary.
Parts 1-3 play Monday.
The Garden of the Finzi-Continis
(1970)
York, San Francisco
The Finzi-Continis represent the
Jewish aristocracy in pre-war Ferrara;
this movie, adapted by Giorgio Bassani
and Vittorio De Sica from Bassani's
semi-autobiographical novel, shows us
the last gasps of that aristocracy, before
Mussolini snuffed it out. Muted yet vivid
— images whirl through your head years
after you think you've forgotten the film
— this picture marked a comeback for De
Sica, whose films after his neo-realist
masterpieces had been disappointments.
It was a triumph, but his last; he was dead
by 1974. Dominique Sanda (whose
beauty is other-worldly) and Helmut
Berger play the Finzi-Continis, and Lino
Capolicchio plays the Bassani part.
Plays Monday with "The Damned."
Southern Comfort (1981)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
Walter Hill made this fascinating film
about the causes and consequences of
violence, which, according to him and to
the screenwriters, Richard Kane and
David Giler, are synonymous. A National
Guard unit has been sent into the Bayou
swamps on war games; they steal some
Cajun canoes, and when their owners
return just as the guardsmen are crossing
river, and one clown "shoots" a volley of
blanks at them as a joke, the Cajuns
respond with real gunfire. At that point
the unit begins to fall apart, quarreling
among themselves about where the
blame lies. Never a unified group to start
with — these are not soldiers — they are
now eight men whose only common bond
is the increasing panic and paranoia they
feel as it becomes apparent that the vio
lence has not ended. Hill and the editor,
Freeman Davics, clamp the film in a vise
and keep tightening it; it is an impeccable
piece of craftsmanship, and on some level
it addresses issues raised by Vietnam, by
the Chicago Convention riots and Kent
State. (It is set in 1973.) The writers don't
develop the characters enough, but luck
ily the cast is full of distinctive actors:
Powers Boothe, Keith Carradine, Peter
Coyote, T.K.Carter, Lewis Smith, Les
Lannom and others. Andrew Laszlo shot

the picture in frosted, ghostly greens, and
the photography gets more and more
abstract as the movie goes on. With a su
perlative musical score by Ry Cooder.
Plays Monday with " Argie."
The Killer Elite'(l97s)
Cedar, San Francisco
Possibly the most extreme of Sam
Peckinpah's paranoid fantasies, this film,
which has a Marc Norman-Stirling Sillip
hant script (based on a Robert Rostand
novel called "Monkey in the Middle"),
posits James Caan as the Peckinpah alter
ego: a C.I.A. agent "retired" (i.e., shot
up) by his best friend who heals himself
and stages a comeback. Most of the Peck
inpah themes are present: friendship and
betrayal, the corruption and disinterest of
those in power, how to take the measure
of a man. It isn't a good picture, but it has
rapt, heart-stopping action sequences, in
cluding one behind the credits and one
involving a band of silver-robed Ninja
that is as exquisite a piece of moviemak
ing as any American director produced in
this period. Philip Lathrop's fine photog
raphy has the exotic use of color you of
ten find in a Peckinpah film, and there's a
solid central performance by James Caan,
who demonstrates his skill at communi
cating the frustration and pride of a
strong man suddenly forced to deal with
physical impairment.
Plays today and tomorrow with "The
Wild Bunch."
The Search (1948)
Cedar, San Francisco
The opening scenes are profoundly
moving: shots of refugee children from
Nazi concentration camps, responding
with suspicious fear to the efforts of
United Nations workers to feed and shel
ter them. The Red Cross ambulances ter
rify them; they associate vehicles like
these with the vans that carried other
children to the gas chambers. One child
hides the bread at dinner, in case he
should get no more; another runs away
from a friendly soldier and drowns. The
director, Fred Zinnemann (who made his
reputation on this film, and then went on
to direct "The Men," "The Member of
the Wedding," "High Noon," and"From
Here to Eternity"), employs his camera
as discreetly and unsensationally as possi
ble, though the narration keeps intruding
and telling us what we can see perfectly
well for ourselves. Unfortunately, after
this semi-documentary opening, the film
turns into a fairly sentimental (and con
ventional) tale of the efforts of a mother
(the soprano Jarmila Novotna) to track
down the son (Ivan Jandl) separated from
her during the war. It does have a fresh,
sweet performance from the boyish
young Montgomery Clift as an American
soldier, and a warm one from Aline Mac-
Mahon, the no-nonsense comedienne of
the 1920s and '30s, as one of the super
visors.
Plays Tuesday through Thursday with
"From Here to Eternity."

Suddenly, Last Summer (1959)
U.C.Theater, Berkeley
Tennessee Williams knew what he was
doing when he wrote this melodrama
about a young woman who tells a horrible
truth — that her homosexual cousin, a
poet, was cannibalized by the boys he
picked up casually on a North African
beach: He kept it short (it's a one-act),
and grotesque as it is, it plays well on
stage. But Gore Vidal, who adapted it for
the screen, and Joseph L. Mankiewicz,
who directed it (and whose tendency has
always been toward long-windedness),
stretched it out to 114 minutes, though
really it only sustains one's interest for an
hour. Elizabeth Taylor gives the role of
the beautiful truth-teller, Catherine
Holly, the good old Hollywood try, but
unlike other actresses playing Williams'
neurotic, fragile heroines (notably Vivien
Leigh in "A Streetcar Named Desire"
and Blythe Danner in the TV production
of "Eccentricities of a Nightingale"), she
doesn't soar, and so her hysterical mo
ments come across as stage madness.
Montgomery Clift is pretty dull as the
doctor (he was never any good at playing
respectable liberals), but Katharine Hep
burn, as the wealthy aunt who wants
Catherine lobotomized, is very funny in
the first half. Her unique accent and ec
centric physical graciousness turn out to
be perfect for the role; she exaggerates
them slightly, pulling certain words out of
her sentences — "dementia praecox,"
"Hong Kong," "Chicago" — as if she
found them weirdly fascinating, and ex
amining them amusedly. With Mercedes
McCambridge (who's quite dreadful) as
Catherine's weak, parasitic mother.
Plays Sunday with "The Glass
Menagerie" (TV version).
My Brilliant Career (1979)
Otero Lounge
Sybylla (Judy Davis, in a lively perfor
mance) is a rebellious spirit in turn-of
the-century rural Australia who is given a
temporary reprieve from farm life when
she is invited to visit her wealthy, stuffy
aunt. All the other women in her family
posture and say things like "Marriage
gives us respectability" and "1 prayed to
God for guidance," so we can see how in
dependent Sybylla is by comparison; did
she spring full-blown, we wonder, from
this conservative brood? This patchwork
of bits from "Little Women" and"The
Sound of Music" and various comedies of
the 19305, adapted by Eleanor Whit
combe from Miles Franklin's novel and
directed by Gill Armstrong, is rather
clumsily staged, and the role of Sybylla,
who flirts with writing and politics and
rejects the proposal of a decent, intelli
gent landowner (Sam Neill), is puzzling,
to say the least.
Plays Monday evening at 7:30.
Mrs. Soffel (1984)
U.C.Theater, Berkeley
Ron Nyswaner based his screenplay on
the true story of the wife of a prison war

den in turn-of-the-century Pittsburgh
who runs off with two brothers convicted
on a charge of murder. The director, Gil
lian Armstrong, and the two stars, Diane
Keaton and Mel Gibson, have welded the
sensational elements into a hard, dense,
pure film with something of the agonized
intensity of a Dostoevski novel. Kate Sof
fel is one of those characters who acts
with a kind of daring that is both im
pulsive and compulsive. She behaves in a
way that not only contradicts what she
knows to be legally wrong and under
stands to be abhorrent to society — like
Nora in "A Doll's House" — but also
removes her forever, she believes, from
God's mercy. Fascinated by the darkest
corner of human existence, she casts her
self into it, severing every tie to her old
life in a single motion. In Diane Keaton's
performance, Kate flies from fever to
fever; this actress has now climbed to the
highest plane in the pantheon of current

American actresses. Mel Gibson matches
Keaton's erotic intensity, but his sexual
potency here derives from a crippled
handsomeness, a passiveness; the two
have amazing rapport. Shot (exquisitely)
by Russell Boyd.
Plays today with "My Brilliant
Career."
The Cotton Club (1984)
Memorial Auditorium
The Cotton Club occupied a unique lo
cation at the crossroads of white society
and black culture (which met on the
whim of white savants), of gangland and
the New York aristocracy (which met as a
result of Prohibition). It's a great subject
for the movies: One imagines a
sumptuous, provocative, deliriously en
tertaining musical drama, filled with
fabulous numbers and scintillating per
sonalities and amazing incidents. But

Francis Ford Coppola, who directed
"The Cotton Club," had a different idea:
to star himself, star his technical razzle
dazzle and his spendthrift virtuosity —
nearly $50 million worth. The movie isn't
about the Cotton Club, any more than
"Apocalypse Now" was about Vietnam
or "The Outsiders" and "Rumble Fish"
were about teenagers. Written by Pulitzer
Prize-winner William Kennedy; with
Richard Gere and Diane Lane (as char
acters whose oddball love story obviously
doesn't belong in the movie); James
Remar as "Dutch" Schultz; Nicolas
Cage; Gregory and Maurice Hines and
Lonette McKee, whose joyous numbers
are almost always spoiled by Coppola's
disinterest in them; and Fred Gwynne,
Bob Hoskins and Julian Beck, who come
off well despite everything.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 and 9:30.
Top Hat (1935)
Kresge Auditorium
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers dance
to one of the four or five best film scores
ever written. The Irving Berlin songs in
clude "No Strings (Fancy Free)," "Isn't It
a Lovely Day (to Be Caught in the
Rain)?," "Top Hat, White Tie and
Tails," "Cheek to Cheek" and"The Pic
colino" — there isn't a bad apple in the
bunch, or an unmemorable dance. Fred
plays an American entertainer in London
who falls in love with Ginger and follows
her to Venice, where she wears her cele
brated satin-and-feathers ballroom gown
for their "Cheek to Cheek" pas de deux.
In "Isn't It a Lovely Day?," they dance in
a gazebo as rain falls all around them, and
in the inventive title number Astaire
leads a crew of men in formal dress in a
dance that turns on itself at the end, when
he uses his cane as a tommy gun and
mows the whole chorus down. ("Pennies
from Heaven" includes an hommage to
this moment.) Mark Sandrich directed a
script by Dwight Taylor and Allan Scott
— probably the best script Astaire and
Rogers were ever given; the supporting
cast features Edward Everett Horton,
Helen Broderick, Eric Blore and Erik
Rhodes (with a walk-on by Lucille Ball).

this semi-documentary opening, the film
turns into a fairly sentimental (and con
ventional) tale of the efforts of a mother
(the soprano Jarmila Novotna) to track
down the son (Ivan Jandl) separated from
her during the war. It does have a fresh,
sweet performance from the boyish
young Montgomery Clift as an American
soldier, and a warm one from Aline Mac-
Mahon, the no-nonsense comedienne of
the 1920s and '30s, as one of the super
visors.
Plays Tuesday through Thursday with
"From Here to Eternity."

Suddenly, Last Summer (1959)
U.C.Theater, Berkeley
Tennessee Williams knew what he was
doing when he wrote this melodrama
about a young woman who tells a horrible
truth — that her homosexual cousin, a
poet, was cannibalized by the boys he
picked up casually on a North African
beach: He kept it short (it's a one-act),
and grotesque as it is, it plays well on
stage. But Gore Vidal, who adapted it for
the screen, and Joseph L. Mankiewicz,
who directed it (and whose tendency has
always been toward long-windedness),
stretched it out to 114 minutes, though
really it only sustains one's interest for an
hour. Elizabeth Taylor gives the role of
the beautiful truth-teller, Catherine
Holly, the good old Hollywood try, but
unlike other actresses playing Williams'
neurotic, fragile heroines (notably Vivien
Leigh in "A Streetcar Named Desire"
and Blythe Danner in the TV production
of "Eccentricities of a Nightingale"), she
doesn't soar, and so her hysterical mo
ments come across as stage madness.
Montgomery Clift is pretty dull as the
doctor (he was never any good at playing
respectable liberals), but Katharine Hep
burn, as the wealthy aunt who wants
Catherine lobotomized, is very funny in
the first half. Her unique accent and ec
centric physical graciousness turn out to
be perfect for the role; she exaggerates
them slightly, pulling certain words out of
her sentences — "dementia praecox,"
"Hong Kong," "Chicago" — as if she
found them weirdly fascinating, and ex
amining them amusedly. With Mercedes
McCambridge (who's quite dreadful) as
Catherine's weak, parasitic mother.
Plays Sunday with "The Glass
Menagerie" (TV version).
My Brilliant Career (1979)
Otero Lounge
Sybylla (Judy Davis, in a lively perfor
mance) is a rebellious spirit in turn-of
the-century rural Australia who is given a
temporary reprieve from farm life when
she is invited to visit her wealthy, stuffy
aunt. All the other women in her family
posture and say things like "Marriage
gives us respectability" and "1 prayed to
God for guidance," so we can see how in
dependent Sybylla is by comparison; did
she spring full-blown, we wonder, from
this conservative brood? This patchwork
of bits from "Little Women" and"The
Sound of Music" and various comedies of
the 19305, adapted by Eleanor Whit
combe from Miles Franklin's novel and
directed by Gill Armstrong, is rather
clumsily staged, and the role of Sybylla,
who flirts with writing and politics and
rejects the proposal of a decent, intelli
gent landowner (Sam Neill), is puzzling,
to say the least.
Plays Monday evening at 7:30.
Mrs. Soffel (1984)
U.C.Theater, Berkeley
Ron Nyswaner based his screenplay on
the true story of the wife of a prison war

den in turn-of-the-century Pittsburgh
who runs off with two brothers convicted
on a charge of murder. The director, Gil
lian Armstrong, and the two stars, Diane
Keaton and Mel Gibson, have welded the
sensational elements into a hard, dense,
pure film with something of the agonized
intensity of a Dostoevski novel. Kate Sof
fel is one of those characters who acts
with a kind of daring that is both im
pulsive and compulsive. She behaves in a
way that not only contradicts what she
knows to be legally wrong and under
stands to be abhorrent to society — like
Nora in "A Doll's House" — but also
removes her forever, she believes, from
God's mercy. Fascinated by the darkest
corner of human existence, she casts her
self into it, severing every tie to her old
life in a single motion. In Diane Keaton's
performance, Kate flies from fever to
fever; this actress has now climbed to the
highest plane in the pantheon of current

American actresses. Mel Gibson matches
Keaton's erotic intensity, but his sexual
potency here derives from a crippled
handsomeness, a passiveness; the two
have amazing rapport. Shot (exquisitely)
by Russell Boyd.
Plays today with "My Brilliant
Career."
The Cotton Club (1984)
Memorial Auditorium
The Cotton Club occupied a unique lo
cation at the crossroads of white society
and black culture (which met on the
whim of white savants), of gangland and
the New York aristocracy (which met as a
result of Prohibition). It's a great subject
for the movies: One imagines a
sumptuous, provocative, deliriously en
tertaining musical drama, filled with
fabulous numbers and scintillating per
sonalities and amazing incidents. But

Francis Ford Coppola, who directed
"The Cotton Club," had a different idea:
to star himself, star his technical razzle
dazzle and his spendthrift virtuosity —
nearly $50 million worth. The movie isn't
about the Cotton Club, any more than
"Apocalypse Now" was about Vietnam
or "The Outsiders" and "Rumble Fish"
were about teenagers. Written by Pulitzer
Prize-winner William Kennedy; with
Richard Gere and Diane Lane (as char
acters whose oddball love story obviously
doesn't belong in the movie); James
Remar as "Dutch" Schultz; Nicolas
Cage; Gregory and Maurice Hines and
Lonette McKee, whose joyous numbers
are almost always spoiled by Coppola's
disinterest in them; and Fred Gwynne,
Bob Hoskins and Julian Beck, who come
off well despite everything.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 and 9:30.
Top Hat (1935)
Kresge Auditorium
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers dance
to one of the four or five best film scores
ever written. The Irving Berlin songs in
clude "No Strings (Fancy Free)," "Isn't It
a Lovely Day (to Be Caught in the
Rain)?," "Top Hat, White Tie and
Tails," "Cheek to Cheek" and"The Pic
colino" — there isn't a bad apple in the
bunch, or an unmemorable dance. Fred
plays an American entertainer in London
who falls in love with Ginger and follows
her to Venice, where she wears her cele
brated satin-and-feathers ballroom gown
for their "Cheek to Cheek" pas de deux.
In "Isn't It a Lovely Day?," they dance in
a gazebo as rain falls all around them, and
in the inventive title number Astaire
leads a crew of men in formal dress in a
dance that turns on itself at the end, when
he uses his cane as a tommy gun and
mows the whole chorus down. ("Pennies
from Heaven" includes an hommage to
this moment.) Mark Sandrich directed a
script by Dwight Taylor and Allan Scott
— probably the best script Astaire and
Rogers were ever given; the supporting
cast features Edward Everett Horton,
Helen Broderick, Eric Blore and Erik
Rhodes (with a walk-on by Lucille Ball).
Plays tonight at 9.
Phantom India (1972)
U.C.Theater, Berkeley
Louis Malle begins his seven-part doc
umentary by explaining that though he
lived in India for months, training his
camera on everything he could discover,
he never felt he'd even started to unravel
the country's great mystery. We are the
beneficiaries of his quest, however, and
his refusal to interpret — to seize the

traditional omniscient point of view of
the documentarian — makes this one of
the most moral non-fiction films ever
made; it's comparable in this way to
James Agee's great literary document of
the Depression, "Let Us Now Praise Fa
mous Men." And it's altogether ex
traordinary.
Parts 1-3 play Monday.
The Garden of the Finzi-Continis
(1970)
York, San Francisco
The Finzi-Continis represent the
Jewish aristocracy in pre-war Ferrara;
this movie, adapted by Giorgio Bassani
and Vittorio De Sica from Bassani's
semi-autobiographical novel, shows us
the last gasps of that aristocracy, before
Mussolini snuffed it out. Muted yet vivid
— images whirl through your head years
after you think you've forgotten the film
— this picture marked a comeback for De
Sica, whose films after his neo-realist
masterpieces had been disappointments.
It was a triumph, but his last; he was dead
by 1974. Dominique Sanda (whose
beauty is other-worldly) and Helmut
Berger play the Finzi-Continis, and Lino
Capolicchio plays the Bassani part.
Plays Monday with "The Damned."
Southern Comfort (1981)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
Walter Hill made this fascinating film
about the causes and consequences of
violence, which, according to him and to
the screenwriters, Richard Kane and
David Giler, are synonymous. A National
Guard unit has been sent into the Bayou
swamps on war games; they steal some
Cajun canoes, and when their owners
return just as the guardsmen are crossing
river, and one clown "shoots" a volley of
blanks at them as a joke, the Cajuns
respond with real gunfire. At that point
the unit begins to fall apart, quarreling
among themselves about where the
blame lies. Never a unified group to start
with — these are not soldiers — they are
now eight men whose only common bond
is the increasing panic and paranoia they
feel as it becomes apparent that the vio
lence has not ended. Hill and the editor,
Freeman Davics, clamp the film in a vise
and keep tightening it; it is an impeccable
piece of craftsmanship, and on some level
it addresses issues raised by Vietnam, by
the Chicago Convention riots and Kent
State. (It is set in 1973.) The writers don't
develop the characters enough, but luck
ily the cast is full of distinctive actors:
Powers Boothe, Keith Carradine, Peter
Coyote, T.K.Carter, Lewis Smith, Les
Lannom and others. Andrew Laszlo shot

the picture in frosted, ghostly greens, and
the photography gets more and more
abstract as the movie goes on. With a su
perlative musical score by Ry Cooder.
Plays Monday with " Argie."
The Killer Elite'(l97s)
Cedar, San Francisco
Possibly the most extreme of Sam
Peckinpah's paranoid fantasies, this film,
which has a Marc Norman-Stirling Sillip
hant script (based on a Robert Rostand
novel called "Monkey in the Middle"),
posits James Caan as the Peckinpah alter
ego: a C.I.A. agent "retired" (i.e., shot
up) by his best friend who heals himself
and stages a comeback. Most of the Peck
inpah themes are present: friendship and
betrayal, the corruption and disinterest of
those in power, how to take the measure
of a man. It isn't a good picture, but it has
rapt, heart-stopping action sequences, in
cluding one behind the credits and one
involving a band of silver-robed Ninja
that is as exquisite a piece of moviemak
ing as any American director produced in
this period. Philip Lathrop's fine photog
raphy has the exotic use of color you of
ten find in a Peckinpah film, and there's a
solid central performance by James Caan,
who demonstrates his skill at communi
cating the frustration and pride of a
strong man suddenly forced to deal with
physical impairment.
Plays today and tomorrow with "The
Wild Bunch."
The Search (1948)
Cedar, San Francisco
The opening scenes are profoundly
moving: shots of refugee children from
Nazi concentration camps, responding
with suspicious fear to the efforts of
United Nations workers to feed and shel
ter them. The Red Cross ambulances ter
rify them; they associate vehicles like
these with the vans that carried other
children to the gas chambers. One child
hides the bread at dinner, in case he
should get no more; another runs away
from a friendly soldier and drowns. The
director, Fred Zinnemann (who made his
reputation on this film, and then went on
to direct "The Men," "The Member of
the Wedding," "High Noon," and"From
Here to Eternity"), employs his camera
as discreetly and unsensationally as possi
ble, though the narration keeps intruding
and telling us what we can see perfectly
well for ourselves. Unfortunately, after
this semi-documentary opening, the film
turns into a fairly sentimental (and con
ventional) tale of the efforts of a mother
(the soprano Jarmila Novotna) to track
down the son (Ivan Jandl) separated from
her during the war. It does have a fresh,
sweet performance from the boyish
