## Baby's fate uncertain Court will make temporary custody decision today 
### MARY YUH Editorial staff 
A detention hearing is scheduled today to determine
whether the baby found Tuesday in a Stanford Hospital
parking lot should be released to the mother or retained
by the probation department until another hearing can be
scheduled in about three weeks, according to a Santa
Clara County official.
Deputy Probation Officer Edwin Hill told the Times
Tribune he believes the judge will temporarily designate
the baby a "court dependent" because of uncertainty
about the mental state of the mother, 37-year-old Betty
Ann Johnson.
The baby eventually could be returned to her mother,
placed in a foster home, put up for adoption or released to
relatives. No relatives have been located, according to the
Times Tribune.
The baby is currently staying at the Stanford Hospital,
and "until a temporary or permament solution is reached,
the baby will be taken care of," said Mike Goodkind,
director of the Medical Center News Bureau.
"The baby is in excellent condition," Goodkind said.

"She is being treated with antibiotics, but that is routine
treatment for infants born under non-antiseptic condi
tions."
The baby was born about 8:30 Tuesday morning. Ac
cording to Stanford Police Chiet Marvin Herrington, the
baby appears to have been born in the brush near the
mausoleum.
Johnson, who has been charged with telony child aban
donment, was taken away for psychiatric evaluation Wed
nesday evening, according to Barbara Young, the nurse
assigned to Johnson's care at Santa Clara Valley Medical
Center. "If she needs treatment, then she's at the psychia
tric ward. If there's nothing wrong with her, then she went
to jail," Young said.
The exact whereabouts of Johnson could not be deter
mined.
Young described Johnson as "a little flighty. 1 didn't
think she was really out of it. 1 asked her why she hadn't
just taken her baby to the Stanford Hospital, why she just
left it. She said to me she felt too guilty, that she knew she
couldn't take care of it. T couldn't just walk in there and
give it up,' she said."
