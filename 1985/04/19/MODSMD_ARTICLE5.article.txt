# Playboy forum panelists clash

"Stanford lends a spurious air of
respectability to the whole busi
ness," said one panel member at
last night's "Examining Playboy at
Stanford" forum. "Nice, well-off,
intelligent women do it, so it must
be OK."
The problem with this attitude is
that it "gives a glossy cover to
what a lot of women have to do to
survive," according to sociologist
Elizabeth Wilson, visiting profes
sor in feminist studies.
The seven-member pailel, spon
sored by Stanford Students
Opposed to Pornography (STOP),
Women of Stanford Law, the
Feminist Studies Program and the
Office of the President, addressed
several pre-distributed questions
regarding pornography in general
and the recruitment of Stanford
students for Playboy's upcoming
"Girls of the Pac-10" issue. After
90 minutes, moderator Sue Rein
hold was urged by the 150-person
audience to open the floor to a
"free-for-all" of queries.
In order to "get as many differ
ent viewpoints as possible and ad
dress as many of the issues as pos
sible." the forum included a law
professor, a Playboy fan, an ex
model and the editor in chief of
The Daily, among others, said
STOP member and panelist
I-aurie Wedemcyer.

The lone endorsement of
Playboy came from Brett Glass, a
graduate student in electrical engi
neering. He said that rather than
degrading women, "Playboy has
raised my opinion of women. ... I
don't disapprove of the pictures
because I think they celebrate the
beauty of the human form."
The other panel members, with
the exception of Daily Editor in
Chief Tim Grieve, who remained
neutral, were unanimous in their
opposition to Glass' assertions.
Sophomore Anne Marie Locke, a
former New York model with the
Ford Modeling Agency, said
Playboy "demeans sex and
sexuality because it divorces the
body from the mind and feelings."
Wilson also denounced the nar
row view of sexuality presented by
Playboy. The magazine offers its
readers "men who are interesting
only by virtue of their wealth and
power, and women who are inter
esting only by virtue of their ab
normally large breasts. . . . [The
magazine] has very little to say
about peoples' real desires and
anxieties about sex."
Many panel members concurred
that Playboy's pervasiveness and
society's acceptance of its "soft
porn" as innocuous make its
degradation of women and
sexuality all the more pernicious.
