Violence escalates in South Africa
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — A black moib seized two white
men on the fringe of a white neighborhood in riot-torn Cape Province
last night and set one of them on fire, police reported.
They said the torched victim was critically burned, but the other man
apparently escaped.
A police spokesman also said officers opened fire on a threatening
crowd of blacks after nightfall near Port Elizabeth on the Indian Ocean,
killing three.
Yesterday was one of the bloodiest days in weeks in the persistent
black agitation against the white-minority government's oppressive
apartheid policy of race discrimination.
A spokesman at national police headquarters in Pretoria said the at
tack took place in Uitenhage, near the black townships that have been
torn daily by riots since police killed 20 people on the way to a funeral
March 21.
A government inquiry into that police shooting heard evidence earlier
yesterday that 17 of the victims — mostly teen-agers — were shot from
behind. The evidence was seen as casting doubt on the' government's
version that the blacks were attacking when police fired.
The attack on the white men took place on the northern fringe of
Uitenhage, which borders the black shantytown of Langa, site of the
March 21 shooting. Uitenhage residents reached by telephone said there
were rumors the whites were pulled from their car. Police could not con
firm this.
Liu killer sentenced in Taiwan
TAIPEI, Taiwan — Taiwan's former military intelligence chief was
sentenced to life imprisonment yesterday for the murder of a Chinese-
American journalist.
Two of the former chiefs aides, atao linked to the slaying of writer
Henry Liu in California, were given jail terms of two years each.
The three, who were implicated by two local underworld figures con
victed earlier in separate trial, could have been sentenced to death by the
five-judge military court martial.
The sentences will be automatically reviewed by a higher military
tribunal, but the three can file their own appeal within 10 days.
Neither Vice Adm. Wong Hsi-ling, 58, former head of the Defense
Ministry's intelligence bureau and the highest-ranked Nationalist
Chinese officer to be court martialed, nor his two aides were present in
court for the three-minute session to hear the verdict.
Wong, who allegedly ordered the killing, was charged with murder.
The two other intelligence officers — Wong's deputy, Maj. Gen. Hu Yi
min, 58, and Col. Chen Yu-men, 41, a deputy section chief of the bureau
— were charged with being accessories.
Liu, 52, who worked for the Chinese-language San Francisco Journal
and whose articles sometimes were critical of the Taiwan government,
was shot dead by two assassins in the garage of his home in Daly City,
Calif., last Oct. 15.
Liu's wife, Helen has claimed the killing was politically motivated.
The Taiwan government has denied any involvement in the slaying and
said the intelligence officers may have acted on their own.
Britain expels Soviet spies
LONDON — Britain yesterday ordered a Soviet diplomat and an
Aeroflot official expelled as spies, but said it still hoped to maintain
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's drive to improve relations with
Moscow.
Given seven days to leave Britain were Capt. Oleg Alexandrovich
Los, 44, assistant naval attache since November 1982, and Vyacheslav
Anatolyvich Grigorov, 37, a charter flight manager for the Soviet state
airline Aeroflot since May 1982. Both are married and have children.
The Foreign Office said Los, who has diplomatic status, "had been
found to have engaged in activities incompatible with his status," while
Grigorov "engaged in unacceptable activities."
The phraseology is a euphemism for espionage. The Foreign Office
gave no other details of their activities.
Mrs. Thatcher's 10 Downing St. office made no comment on the ex
pulsions.
Guennadi Shabannikov, Soviet Embassy press attache, said, "The em
bassy would like to make it absolutely dear that this unwarranted action
of unfriendly character is without any foundation whatsoever."
Some but not all cases brought retaliation by Mos
cow, and the Foreign Office said yesterday that the government "would
take an extremely serious view of any attempt to retaliate" by ordering
Britons out of Moscow.
Soviet Ambassador Viktor Popov was called to the Foreign Office by
Derek Thomas, a deputy secretary of state, to be told of the explusion
order. Despite the order, Thomas said, Britain "wished to improve
bilateral relations and expand contacts with the Soviet Union. Our
policy is and remains serious and realistic but vigilant in the search for
greater mutual security and confidence."
Israel commemorates Holocaust
TEL AVIV, Israel — Rush-hour traffic froze and people halted in
mid-stride, heads bowed, at the wail of sirens signaling a two-minute
silent tribute today to the six million Jewish victims of the Nazi
Holocaust.
Prominent Israelis, angered at President Reagan's plans to visit a West
German cemetary in May where members of Hitler's SS stormtroopers
are buried, declared the Holocaust must not be forgotten.
Traffic in Israel's cities resembled a frozen tableau at 8 a.m. as drivers
halted in the middle of the street, getting out of their cars to stand at at
tention at the whine of the sirens. Pedestrians bowed their heads.
The annual Holocaust Day observance officially began Wednesday
night with commemorative ceremonies for Holocaust survivors.
"We say today to those who took part in the defeat of the Nazi beast
that it is their duty too to remember and to remind, to educate and to
make sure that this monstrous occurrence never happens again," said
Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir at a commemorative Tel Aviv rally
Wednesday night, when the annual Holocaust Day observance began.
Although Shamir did not name Reagan, aides who distributed the text
of the speech pointed to the remark as indirect criticism of Reagan.
Prime Minister Shimon Peres told a rally at the Yad Vashem
Holocaust Memorial that reconciliation between two peoples who
fought each other in World War II was legitimate, but "there is no
reconciliation with the past, with wickedness, with the devil."
Knesset Speaker Shlomo Hillel told the Israeli parliament Wednesday
that Reagan's decision "resembles a contribution, albeit an unwitting
one, to the process of forgetting" the Holocaust.
Union Carbide to pay $5 million
NEW YORK — Union Carbide agreed yesterday to finance a $5 mil
lion emergency aid program for victims of the Bhopal chemical disaster,
but said a "fair global settlement" of the victims' lawsuits would do more
good.
Carbide acted two days after U.S. District Judge John Keenan
publicly urged the corporation to spend $5 million to $10 million as a
show of "good will" without waiting for court action to be resolved. Such
a donation, Kccn&n said, would not imply that the Danbury, Conn.-
based corporation admits any liability for the Dec. 3 accident.
According to Indian government figures, some 1,700 people were
killed and up to 200.000 were injured when a cloud of methyl isocyanate
gas escaped from a pesticide plant and drifted through a slum area of
Bhopal.
The New Delhi government sued Union Carbide last week, adding to
more than 60 other suits'against the company that were brought by
private American attorneys on behalf of accident victims. All the cases
have been placed before Keenan for at least preliminary action.
The company's response to Keenan's suggestion came in a letter from
its vice president and treasurer, Rolf Towe.
"Union Carbide Corp. shares the court's deep concern about the
health and welfare of the surviving victims of the Bhopal gas leak
tragedy and recognizes the importance of immediate interim relief,"
Towe wrote.
