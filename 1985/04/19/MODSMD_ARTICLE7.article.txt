# Reagan's Contra plan in trouble
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The Republican-led Senate
Appropriations Committee voted 15-13 yesterday
to approve President Reagan's plan to release $14
million in aid to Nicaraguan rebels. But other
developments showed the president's proposal was
in deep trouble with votes scheduled on the House
and Senate floor Tuesday.
In the House, Democrats rejected a Republican
compromise, which would have prohibited use of
the $14 million for military assistance.
Instead, the House Rules Committee sent to the
floor a broader humanitarian aid package for
Central America which would help refugees and
provide money for a peace-keeping force once the
Nicaraguan civil war was over.
The Senate committee vote was in part a holding
pattern, intended to allow further negotiations with
the White House.
Many members of the committee, including

Republicans, said they would vote against Reagan's
proposal on the floor, although they supported it
yesterday for procedural reasons.
Republican leaders tried unsuccessfully to find
ways to amend Reagan's plan, which as a special
appropriations measure was difficult to change in
committee. But the rules governing debate in the
full Senate are expected to allow the possible com
promise to replace the original Reagan proposal.
Under Reagan's plan approved by the commit
tee, the $14 million would be provided as food,
clothing and medical assistance for a 60-day cease
fire period.
After that, Reagan could divert the money to
weapons and ammunition if the Nicaraguan gov
ernment, in the president's judgment, had failed to
negotiate seriously with the Contra rebels seeking
to overthrow the leftist Sandinista regime.
The alternative agreed to by House and Senate

Republican leaders reportedly had Reagan's agree
ment earlier in the day yesterday. But by late after
noon when the appropriations panel voted,
Chairman Mark Hatfield of Oregon said there was
no compromise.
An administration official, speaking on condition
he not be identified, confirmed that an agreement
had been reached with senators of both parties on a
measure appropriating the $14 million for the cur
rent fiscal year, but providing that all of the money
would be for non-lethal assistance.
House GOP Whip Trent Lott of Mississippi had
said the compromise would assure that "we donlt
let the Contras go down the drain."
House Minority Leader Robert Michel (R-11J.)
had predicted Reagan's original proposal would
lose in the House next week, and there was some
chance the president might also be beaten in the
Republican-led Senate.
