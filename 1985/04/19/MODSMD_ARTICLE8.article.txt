BEIRUT â€” Shiite and Druse
militias flushed out and captured the
last of their rivals in west Beirut yes
terday, as Prime Minister Rashid
Karami fled to Syria, which spon
sored his national unity Cabinet and
was reported pressuring him to
its resignation.
There were sporadic gunbattles as
men of the Shiite Moslem militia
Annal and their Druse allies seized
dozens of fighters of the
Mourabitoun, a Sunni Moslem militia
with which they once were allied
against Christian warlords.
Witnesses said the search was con
ducted from house to house in the
capital's Moslem sector, and the
captives were driven from their
homes under armed guard.
The sweep ended a savage battle
for control of west Beirut that began
Tuesday and prompted Karami, a
Sunni Moslem, the announce the res
ignation of his government.
Dozens of armed robberies and
store-lootings were reported in
Beirut as thieves took advantage of
the lawlessness.
Diplomats and political analysts
speculated that the Syrians, deter
mined to prevent Palestine Libera
tion Organization chief Yasser Arafat
from regaining a power base in west
Beirut, did not try to discourage the
Amal and Druse militias from smash
ing the Mourabitoun.
The Shiite and Druse militias are
Syria's strongest allies in Lebanon.
The Mourabitoun were trained and
armed by the PLO.
Karami resigned Wednesday be
cause of what he called the "horrific
nightmare" of the street in

which 33 people were killed and 135
wounded.
He formed the unity government a
year ago as part of the effort by Presi
dent Amin Gemayel, a Maronite
Christian with close ties to Syria, to
end nearly two decades of political
chaos in Lebanon.
Local radio stations said President
Hafez Assad of Syria feared the resig
nation of Karami's government
would plunge Lebanon into all-out
civil war and was pressuring the
prime minister to withdraw it.
Syria has more than 30,000 troops
in the Bekaa Valley of eastern
Lebanon and is the nation's main
power broker.
