# Turner unveils CBS takeover bid
## 
### 
NEW YORK â€” Cable televi
sion pioneer Ted Turner unveiled
a brash bid yesterday to take con
trol of CBS Inc. without spending
any cash and against the resistance
of the nation's top-rated television
network.
Industry analysts, who
disagreed on the exact value of the
multibillion-dollar proposal,
voiced skepticism that Turner
could pull off such a coup.
CBS has vowed to remain in
dpendent but had nothing to say
about Turner's announcement.
However, the Atlanta-based
broadcaster, yachtsman and
baseball owner won immediate
support from Fairness in Media, a
group associated with Sen. Jesse
Helms (R-N.C.), which had
sought to buy enough CBS stock
to "become Dan Rather's boss."
Turner Broadcasting System
Inc. "has no plans to make funda
mental changes in the CBS televi
sion network," Turner told
reporters yesterday. "TBS will
seek to improve the quality, objec
tivity and diversity of CBS pro
gramming."
He refused to answer questions.
"I want to make it very clear
that Turner Broadcasting is acting
on its own and has no connection
with any ideology or other group
in this transaction," Turner said.
If Turner succeeds, it would be
the second change of ownership
among the nation's big three net
works. Last month, American
Broadcasting Cos. and Capital

Communications Inc. announced
that they would merge in a
friendly $3.5 billion deal. That
plan is still subject to approval by
federal regulators and sharehold
ers.
Turner said he is offering a
package of stock and notes in his
own Atlanta-based Turner Broad
casting System Inc. for each of
CBS's 29.7 million shares out
standing. He said that he is offer
ing no cash and that he has no
partners.
His Cable News Network said
those securities would be worth
$175 a share, making the deal
worth about $5.2 billion. Wali
Street analysts put lower values on
the deal, one as low as $120 a
share.
CBS stock rose $5.25 a share
after the announcement but then
retreated and ended the day at
$106.12'/2, down $3.62V2 from
Wednesday's close on the New
York Stock Exchange. Turner
Broadcasting's common stock was
unchanged at $24 in over-the
counter trading.
The announcement, which
ended weeks of speculation that
Turner would bid for CBS, said his
offer was conditioned on obtaining
67 percent of CBS's stock.
Turner said that if he obtained
67 percent of CBS's stock, he
would take control of the board
and then merge his company with
the network, with the same terms
offered to the shareholders who
had not tendered their shares.
