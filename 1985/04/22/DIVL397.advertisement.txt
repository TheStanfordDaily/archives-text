Common-Sense a new book by
Morality and Tanner Lecturer
Consequentialism michael slote
Ethical consequentialism, including utilitarians, judge
the morality of human actions by their consequences.
But everyday morality seems to conflict With
consequentialism in several areas: common-sense
morality dictates that ends cannot justify means, for
example. Slote examines cases of apparent conflict
between these two approaches to ethics, and proposes
important revisions of consequentialism which make
it more compatible with common sense.
