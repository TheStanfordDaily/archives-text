WASHINGTON — President
Reagan's controversial visit to a Ger
man military cemetery may have
pierced his "mantle of invincibility"
and could hurt him in congressional
fights over the budget and aid to
Nicaraguan rebels, a former key
Reagan aide said yesterday.
"This could not have come at a
worse time," David Gergen, who was
White House communications direc
tor during the first Reagan adminis
tration, said on ABC-TV's "This
Week with David Brinkley."
"This series of events could make it
easier for people in Congress to vote
against him," Gergen said. "There's a
very definite threat of a rolling conse
quence."
Gergen said that "the president for
a number of months now has had this
mantle of invincibility, an aura of au
thority, that he's worn — certainly
since his re-election and even before.
"I think that once that is pierced, it
becomes more difficult for him to win
the big votes," said Gergen, referring
specifically to votes this week on the
$14 million aid package for the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels and subse
quent votes on the administration
budget.
Gergen said "a series of terrible
mistakes" in the White House
produced the controversy over
Reagan's planned visit next month to
a cemetery in Bitburg, West Ger

many, containing 2,000 graves, in
cluding 47 of members of the elite SS
corps, blamed for many atrocities
against Jews.
Senate Majority Leader Robert
Dole (R-Kan.) said about the wave of
criticism prompted by Reagan's deci
sion, "It's a serious problem — it's
not going to go away."
"Somebody didn't fully inform the
president about the cemetery visit,"
Dole said on NBC's "Meet the
Press."
Two other members of Congress,
House Foreign Affairs Chairman
Dante Fascell (D-Fla.) and Rep. Jack
Kemp (R-N.Y.) also spoke out yes
terday against the cemetery visit.
Addressing the American Israel
Public Affairs Committee in Wash
ington, Fascell and Kemp endorsed
sentiments expressed by leaders of
the lobbying group in a letter urging
Reagan not to go to the cemetery.
Gergen said the visit to a military
cemetery was agreed to by Reagan in
November when visiting West Ger
man Chancellor Helmut Kohl "broke
down" emotionally in the White
House as he implored Reagan to
make such a visit.
Later, a White House advance
team went to Bitburg when the graves
were covered by snow and was told
by German officials there was noth
ing there that would embarrass the
president, according to Gergen.
