Jackson leads protest
WASHINGTON — Thousands of protesters
marched outside the White House on Saturday to
start three days of demonstrations against Presi
dent Reagan's military buildup and policies on
South Africa and Central America.
Protesters massed on the Ellipse, the park
outside the White House grounds, then swung up
Pennsylvania Avenue toward the Capitol for a
rally.

As they passed the White House, the Rev.
Jesse Jackson dropped to the pavement and ut
tered a prayer that referred to Reagan's planned
visit next month to a military cemetery in Bit
burg, West Germany.
"Touch our president in some special way,"
the kneeling civil rights leader said. "Some place
between Bitburg and Johannesburg, let him
choose another way."
The demonstration, marking the 10th anniver
sary of the end of the Vietnam War, was echoed

on the West Coast, where 4,000 protesters
marched in downtown Los Angeles and others
rallied in Seattle.
"What brings us here is the need to reverse the
policies of the Reagan administration — the in
humane treatment of the U.S. public, especially
the poor, and of people in Third World countries
such as El Salvador," said Joel Koplitz, 25, a
protester in Los Angeles.
U.S. plans Arab aid
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State George
Shultz, sayirg the way is open for diplomatic
progress in Middle East, pledged yesterday that
the United States would help protect Arab
countries that negotiate directly with Israel.
"Those who take risks for peace should know
that the United States will help them defend
themselves," said Shultz, who did not offer any
specifics about what form such assistance might
take.
"The United States must continue to support
those who seek negotiations and peaceful solu
tions against those who promote violence and
oppose peace," he said in an address to the
American Israel Public Affairs Committee's an
nual policy conference.
Shultz noted that after Jordan's King Hussein
tried to bring Palestinians to the bargaining table
with the Israelis, Jordanian diplomats were assas
sinated and offices of Jordanian Airlines were
bombed.
"Now is the time for the Arabs to let negotia
tions proceed," he said.
