## Big Way throws parties and benefits charity 
### MARILYN WANN Staff writer 
Everybody likes Big Way.
Corporate sponsors like Big Way
because it plans campus-wide events
at which they can hang advertising
banners and strew freebies.
Students like Big Way because it
gives them a good excuse to buy a
rubber raft and lie out on the lake or
to run through fountains chasing a
Frisbee.
People at the local children's day
care centers like Big Way because it
donated more than $3,000 to these
centers last year.
University officials like Big Way
because it keeps students happy and
having fun without being purely
hedonistic and losing that volunteer
spirit.
Even Big Way planners like Big
Way because they can spread their
motto of fun for a good cause, or
"gaudeamus pro bona causa," to
their fellow students.
Sophomore Coral Damkroger is
pleased even though she hasn't gotten
her raft yet. "I bought a yacht, but
unfortunately all they've done is take

my money. I think I'll get it, I mean,
things come up," she explained. "I
anticipate a nice little cruise for two,
anyway."
Damkroger bought one of Big
Way's two-man Seeview yachts, a
model with a clear bottom, because
she was planning to get a raft anyway
and liked giving the money to a good
cause.
"I didn't know what it (Big Way)
was about, but I knew it had some
thing to do with the lake," she ad
mitted. Now, she thinks she might get
more involved next year if she enjoys
this spring's events.
Sophomore Chris Festa said he is
pleased with his Big Way job as
events coordinator because it gives
him "a chance to do these fun ideas
and give them to the campus."
An avid Frisbee golf player, he
joined the club to help Big Way or
ganize this sport as one of its spring
quarter events, scheduled for Satur
day.
The Big Way course includes nine
holes, mostly located in fountains,
with a special hole-in-one contest if
you can get your Frisbee from the

Claw to the fountain in the Old
Union courtyard in one hurl.
The finale is a shot from the fifth
floor of Terman into the pond, with
onlookers partying at the
"clubhouse" on the patio above.
Festa tried to organize a course
called Suntanning 001 for academic
credit, but when that didn't work out,
he told Big Way about his contact
with Hawaiian Tropics, which is now
sponsoring a tanning contest at Sun
fest, an event planned for May 25.
Hawaiian Tropics is the newest of
Big Way's four national sponsors.
The others are Anheuser Busch's
Budweiser, Pepsi Cola and Frito Lay.
These sponsors cover the costs of
Big Way events so that the money
from memberships or ticket sales can
all go to charity. For Sunfest, the
companies will bring refreshments
and free suntan oil and STARTS will
provide bands.
Tanners in the First Annual Big
Way Zonker Harris Hawaiian Tropic
Memorial Tanning Contest will use
their bodies as bingo boards, match
ing the hues of arms, legs, noses and
faces to colors announced from paint

color strips ranging from bloodblis
tering red to ghastly white.
Students who are judged to have a
match will win T-shirts, with the top
male and female winners possibly
taking expense-paid trips to Busch
Gardens and Daytona Beach.
"We've written George Hamilton a
letter," said Jay Alter, alias Captain
Big Way. "I don't think he's going to
respond."
Last year, when Bob Levy, who
originally had the idea of dressing up
in a shower-curtain cape and purple
high-tops to sell "yachts," graduated,
the club was left with some undis
tributed funds and no figurehead.
Alter has restarted the club and or
ganized a large staff for planning
events in hopes of raising $4,000 and
subscribing 800 members this year.
To do this, Captain Big Way ap
peared at registration each quarter
and has been sighted in White Plaza a
few times.
Membership is now at a low 100
yachtsmen, and the captain isn't to
happy about this, so he's started a dis
count rate for groups. Ten of more
people will pay $2 each, not the reg
ular $5, to take part in Frisbee golf.
Big Way Tennis May 11 — with its
rule that players can use anything but
tennis racquets — and Sunfest.
Alter may be a bit schizophrenic
when discussing Captain Big Way,
but he's very enthusiastic.
"He's a Ronald McDonald person
ality — the ultimate in the conscien
tious partier," said Alter. "There was
no training for my role. He's a spon
taneous character, kind of tacky,
too."
The mild-mannered former dorm
representative for Big Way now dons
a magenta cape, Everlast boxer shorts,
cut-off Bud pajamas, a yellow shirt
and the classic purple high-tops to
proclaim his credo that the definitive
good party is not getting a beer truck
and hiring a band, but doing some
thing unusual for a good reason.
Underneath the obsession with
having great parties, Big Way deals
with serious problems.
Volunteer coordinator Martha
Moody is pleased with her job of sug
gesting where to donate money be
cause she is interested in children's is
sues.
Big Way will try to do something
for each of the five centers on campus
and for Belle Haven Child Develop
ment Center in East Menlo Park,
which is already receiving a toy shed.
"Some of the centers have ex
pressed interest in volunteers' donat
ing time for fund-raisers a couple of
Saturdays this quarter," Moody said.
It is more difficult to find people will
ing to fit this type of work into their
schedules than people willing to
party, she is finding.
"Student organizations in general
get kind of laughed at," she said,
describing the time she asked people
to buy memberships at her own dorm
meeting. "After that, they had plenty
of questions."
Moody said that Big Way also
hopes to establish a permanent $500
scholarship for student families that
can't afford day care.
Alter, too, sees difficulties for his
club, from needing office and storage
space — he has boxes of T-shirts and
other giveaway items piled in his

room — to not being able to get
money from the ASSU.
The Offices of the Dean of Stu
dents Affairs and Student Organiza
tion Services (SOS) provide both ad
vice and restrictions.
Groups like Big Way can't use the
Stanford name in soliciting aid for
non-University purposes without
submitting a proposal and getting
registered with Michael Ramsey-
Perez, coordinator of SOS.
Ramsey-Perez is impressed with
Big Way's work, as is Margaret Ann
Fidler, associate dean of Student Af
fairs.
"It's one kind of commitment to
raise money," Fidler said. "It's an
other kind of commitment to actually
work with programs. That involves
time."
Alter has strong opinions about his
group and student groups in general
after working with these administra
tors.
"We take on a big commitment,"
he said, using Fidler's word. "The
more successful we are, the easier it is
for another group to do something on
campus."
He cites working with national
sponsors as one crucial area of re
sponsibility. If Big Way claims it
needs money to put on an event, it

must be sure it will go through with its
plans.
Ramsey-Perez explains this from
another viewpoint, saying, "We don't
want the same people being hit up 48
times for what are probably low-level
priorities for the overall University.
Then when the University goes to
them to ask for, say, equipment for
the engineering buildings, they say,
'But we've already helped you 48
times.' "
Alter said he thought there are
already too many organizations that
don't work together on campus, citing
the low participation in the Charity
Carnival this weekend.
"It's a shame," he said, but quickly
started talking about an idea for next
year, a formal dance co-sponsored
with the Women's Center and held in
the Quad to benefit hungry children
in the area.
Alter, who resigned from the senate
this year, said, "We're the antithesis of
the ASSU, even though we do put up
fliers. We don't go to the ASSU for
funding. I know they would not fund
somebody like us, which is a real
shame."
So while Big Way seems to be
pleasing all of the people all of the
time, they don't seem to be able al
ways to satisfy their own hopes for
their club.
