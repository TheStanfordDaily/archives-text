Owing to a recent fiasco at Tulane Univesity,
the already tarnished reputation of college ath
letics has lost nearly all its luster.
Tulane University decided to drop its basket
ball program after some of its players were in
dicted for taking bribes to shave points and
confessed to taking under-the-table payments
from coaches. Many other schools have been
convicted of violating NCAA rules in the last few
years, including Pacific 10 Conference members
Oregon State, Arizona and USC. In addition,
hundreds of schools have doubtless violated rules
and not been caught.
The NCAA has a near-impossible task of
cleaning up college athletics, but it has found a
good place to start. In the wake of the recent
Tulane scandal, the NCAA Council approved
Wednesday a series of strict rules to punish
schools with lawless athletic programs. These
long-overdue rules — called by one NCAA ob
server the "athletic equivalent of the death
penalty" — should serve to keep many schools on
the straight and narrow path of legality, and thus
restore the sheen of decency that college sports
once enjoyed.
Under the NCAA proposal, violations will be
divided into major and secondary infractions.
Major infractions are those that show a repeated
pattern of willful wrongdoing and give a school a
clear competitive advantage. Schools convicted
of this charge will receive a minimum penalty of a

two-year probation and a one-year ban on all
recruiting, post-season competition and televi
sion appearances. In addition, two major viola
tion charges within five years will mean much
harsher penalties: The offending school will be
prohibited from competing above the intramural
level for one or two years in the sport involved in
the latest violation, the entire coaching staff will
be forbidden to coach anywhere for two years,
and no scholarships or recruiting will be allowed
for two years.
Secondary infractions are those that are iso
lated or technical in nature and give a school a
limited advantage. Under the NCAA proposal,
this charge could result in the permanent in
eligibility of athletes, forfeiture of games, a one
year prohibition on off-campus recruiting, a 20
percent reduction in the number of scholarships
the school can offer in the affected sport and a
fine ranging from $500 to $5,000.
NCAA President Jack Davis has announced
that all NCAA schools will convene in June for a
roll-call vote on the measures, meaning that
every school's vote will be a matter of public
record. The measures are harsh, and many
schools surely oppose them, but because the vote
is public, the proposal will probably pass. The
NCAA deserves credit for taking the first step
toward amelioration by making a laudable offer
no school can refuse.
