# In defense of drinkers' rights
## 
### 
Students and all young people should be concerned
about a new national political movement: the neo-
Prohibitionist effort to control alcohol use.
Back in 1895, when John Stuart Mill published his es
say "On Liberty," the classical liberal writer argued that
drunks should be punished when they violated the rights
of others or when they failed to uphold their obligations to
others. But the drunk's own good was not sufficient war
rant for interference with his or her personal liberty.
In fact, Mill cites as symptomatic of a despotic society
restrictions on the number of liquor outlets as a supposed
way of reducing temptation.

But now, more than 50 years since the repeal of
Prohibition, the Prohibitionists are on the march again.
The federal government is in effect mandating a national
legal drinking age of 21. Massachusetts has banned happy
hours, ladies' nights and similar discount promotions. Liq
uor taxes are going to be hiked this year.
Also distressing are legal developments that run di
rectly counter to the central principles of personal
responsibility that underlie most American laws. Bad laws
are being enforced and bad legal doctrines are being fol
lowed that hold a host — whether commercial bartender
or private homeowner — guilty for the damage done by
those to whom liquor is served. The drinker should be
held strictly responsible for what he or she does— not the
host.
First of all, it is important to put the current drinking
situation in perspective. In the 50 years following the
Declaration of Independence, liquor consumption per
capita was three times what it has been during the last 50
years.
Second, the neo-Prohibitionists in focusing on the bev
erage forget about the people — their rights, values and
customs. Americans use alcohol in their religious
ceremonies, wedding festivities and ship launchings. They
drink for recreation and relaxation.
• Some cultures, such as those in Italy and Israel, have no
legal drinking age restriction at all, yet they have vastly
fewer problems of alcohol abuse than exist in America.
Approximately two-thirds of American adults drink, but
only about 10 percent have serious problems of abuse.
Finland has comparatively very low alcohol consump

tion, but serious alcohol problems are frequent among its
people. Argentina and Luxembourg, among the heaviest
drinking countries in the world, are relatively problem
free. The problem is in the people and not in the liquid
concoction.
Third, television advertising has once again become a
convenient whipping boy. Advertising is blamed for
drinking problems, and increasingly frequent proposals
are made to bar beer and wine ads from television. Once
again people and their culture seem to be neglected in the
quick search for mechanical solutions. The Soviet Union,
for example, has little advertising of alcohol, yet from all
reports, it has a very high incidence of alcohol problems.
Fourth, it is a serious attack on the Bill of Rights and
America's heritage of liberty to make our individual rights
dependent on statistical studies.
Proponents of a 21-year minimum drinking age point to
the fact that one-quarter of the alcohol-related traffic
accidents involve 18- to 20-year-olds. This is true.
But one-quarter of those accidents also involve 21- to
24-year-olds. Are their rights the next to go?
Author Rex Reed wonders whether those 55 and older
will be denied the right to drink, since they often have
weaknesses — like bad eyesight or slower reflexes — that
are compounded by drinking.
In any case, once we start down the road to rights res
ting only on statistics, how long will it be before we are
locking up all black teenagers in preventative detention in
order to reduce crime or before we commit similar
atrocities against civil liberties?
Finally, I would like to say a few words about the
benefits of drinking. This will not be an argument that
W.C. Fields or H.L. Mencken without the drink would not
be the real thing nor half as funny.
1 myself am something of a sobersides, only infre
quently drinking beer and wine. But medical evidence has
recently come to my attention which suggests that some
people may be drinking too little.
One or two drinks a day (there is no improvement with
more) raise the blood level of "good" fats — the high
density lipoproteins which are thought to protect against
arteriosclerosis.
Although this beneficial effect is a widely known fact
among heart and blood researchers, the current neo-
Prohibitionist sentiment is so fashionable that this impor
tant medicinal use of alcohol gets virtually no attention in
the broadcasting news or in newspaper and magazine arti
cles.
The so-called Noble Experiment of Prohibition in the
1920s was a disaster. That social-control effort was
backed by a coalition of progressive liberals and religious
fundamentalists. We need to stand up for our rights of
personal liberty or something similar will happen again.

Finally, I would like to say a few words about the
benefits of drinking. This will not be an argument that
W.C. Fields or H.L. Mencken without the drink would not
be the real thing nor half as funny.
1 myself am something of a sobersides, only infre
quently drinking beer and wine. But medical evidence has
recently come to my attention which suggests that some
people may be drinking too little.
One or two drinks a day (there is no improvement with
more) raise the blood level of "good" fats — the high
density lipoproteins which are thought to protect against
arteriosclerosis.
Although this beneficial effect is a widely known fact
among heart and blood researchers, the current neo-
Prohibitionist sentiment is so fashionable that this impor
tant medicinal use of alcohol gets virtually no attention in
the broadcasting news or in newspaper and magazine arti
cles.
The so-called Noble Experiment of Prohibition in the
1920s was a disaster. That social-control effort was
backed by a coalition of progressive liberals and religious
fundamentalists. We need to stand up for our rights of
personal liberty or something similar will happen again.
