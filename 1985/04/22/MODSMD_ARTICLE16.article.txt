## Fighting homophobia at Stanford 
### 
Last Saturday, while in a campus restroom, I saw
something that made my blood run cold. On the
door of a stall covered with homophobic graffiti
was the shocking and simple message, "Faggots
have no rights."

VIEWPOINT

"My God," 1 thought, ' Has it really comc to
this?" Could there actually be people so prejudiced
that they were prepared to deny someone basic
rights? A quick look through history shows that the
first step toward killing, abusing or enslaving some
one is to deny his rights, to deny his basic humanity.
In this century, Armenians, Jews, gypsies and
gays have all been declared non- or subhuman and
decimated. Could the thoughts which led to such
slaughter, even if those who wrote them down did
not intend to kill anyone, be found at one of the na
tion's best schools?
I thought about it.and the answer was not long in
coming. I remembered last year when a friend was
overjoyed that the statue "Gay Liberation" was at
tacked. because he didn't want to go to a school
known for being tolerant of gays.
1 was also angered when a resident assistant I
knew was concerned because he had been seen
near the statue when the local news crews were
there. He was afraid he'd be labeled a "gay."
Then there was the time I ate lunch with a group
of people who were trying to "figure out" who
were the gays in the dorm. Not surprisingly, the
people they chose were people they didn't like.
And. of course, throughout my years here. I have
read enough hatred on the bathroom walls to know
that the inscription 1 saw last week was no fluke.
I say none of this in an attempt to single anyone

out, because it is pretty clear to me that homo
phobia, whether it is blatant or subtle, is not unusual
either at Stanford or in the rest of this country. 1
would be a liar if 1 claimed I have managed to
shake myself totally of such feelings, much to my
embarrassment.
It is against the backdrop of such a homophobic
society that I write. It is time we (and here I am es
pecially referring to my fellow heterosexuals) look
at our society and ask ourselves if we want to live
with such a hate-filled attitude toward part of our
society, part of ourselves.
For too many years, our society has attacked
homosexuals and homosexuality in a way that only

Homophobia, whether it is blatant or subtle, is not

country.

shows our inability to cope with difference. We
have defined "right" as being "straight." using a
circular logic we accept only because it does not af
fect the majority of us.
The wrongness of such an approach can be
shown by a simple experiment. Look back at the
quote from the bathroom wall. Put your race, reli
gion. gender or. better yet, your own name next to
the phrase ' have no rights." How does the message
look now? Would we allow anyone to define us as
subhuman, to attack us for our beliefs? How much
the more so in the case of an inherent, organic ele

ment of ourselves, our sexuality? Who would rea
sonably stand for that?
But we heterosexuals must do more than
recognize that hatred of homosexuality and
homosexuals is a hatred of humans and thus, a
negation of every known system of ethics. We must
attempt to correct this problem, both as a society
and as individuals.
As a nation, we must recognize that "gay rights"
are human rights and citizens' rights and must not
be denied. Our society prides itself on being open
â€” let us earn that title. As individuals, we straights
need to be more open to gays, even though we have
been taught by previous generations to hate them.

We must do this, if not for moral reasons, then
for pragmatic ones. Over and over again, history
shows us that when one group is attacked, all are
less free. Moreover, a nation that draws its
lifeblood from hatred, even if the hatred is directed
only against a small group, eventually self-destructs
or is destroyed by others. It seems to me that we
have a choice: Either we work to eliminate preju
dice or we go the way of the mighty and the dead.
