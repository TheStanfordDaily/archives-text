No discrimination
I agree with Londa Schiebinger
(The Daily, April 3) that there
should be a continuing effort to
identify and eliminate discrimination
against women (or any other iden
tifiable group) studying science at
Stanford University.
The problem of societal discrimi
nation against women is real and
needs to be corrected. However,
Schiebinger s bill of charges against
the Physics Department in particular
appears to be unfounded.
The statistical evidence presented
certainly indicates that women repre
sent only 10 percent or so of each
year's graduating class but, taken by
itself, this small ratio of women to
men provides no indication of sex
related discrimination within the
department.
A more reasonable way to treat
these figures would be to compare
them to similar results from other
undergraduate institutions around
the country. According to the Amer
ican Institute of Physics' annual
survey of undergraduate degree
granting institutions, the percentage
of bachelor's degrees in physics
granted to women over the last five
years has slowly increased from 9.7
to 13.7 percent.
Schiebinger's figures show that
Stanford is reasonably close to the

national average given the large
effect on the female-to-male ratio
that the gain or loss of one physics
major (for whatever reason) has in
such a small undergraduate depart
ment.
Another pertinent figure might be
the relative number of female
physics majors who do go on to
graduate versus their male counter
parts. I suspect that the department
would also do well in this compari
son.
An isolated lapse of discretion by
one professor does not establish a
departmental policy on the use of
erotica in the classroom. I believe
that Schiebinger does Stanford's
undergradute women a disservice by
suggesting they would be so easily
traumatized by this minor incident
that they could never again face their
Physics 51 textbook (or remain in
the department).
It is clear this single event does not
lead to the conclusion that there is a
department-wide effort to exclude
women from the "physics club." On
the contrary, during five years in the
physics graduate program, I have
never heard a fellow student com
plain or imply that she felt dis
criminated against within the
department.
In the absence of a valid poll of
the concerned students or docu
mented cases to the contrary, I con
clude that this is not a major issue. I

feel safe in asserting that the vast
majority of physicists would welcome
an increase in the proportion of
women in our ranks.
The dearth of female role models
for aspiring physicists is unfortunate,
but it is not necessarily related to
their decision whether to go on to
graduate school. My experience, in
any case, has been that graduate
students in physics are motivated
more by a fundamental curiosity
about nature than by a pragmatic
appraisal of the work environment
they will eventually participate in.
Most of the graduate students in
physics that I know were motivated
to study science at a very early age.
If there is a clear-cut explanation for
the lack of female physicists, it prob
ably is associated with the various
influences on children's development
in our culture.
The claim that the Physics Depart
ment discriminates againsi women is
(at present) unsubstantiated. My
impression is that the department
would make every effort to correct
any problems that arise in this area.
It is perhaps encouraging to note
that if such a minor incident can
generate so much controversy, it may
be due to the infrequency of more
substantive occurrences of discrimi
nation against women on campus.
