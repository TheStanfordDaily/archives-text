# Playboy packs its bags

### SHIRISH DATE Senior staff writer 
As a parting gift to Playboy, about
30 protesters from Stanford Students
Opposed to Pornography and
Women at Stanford Law (WSL) yes
terday gave photographer David
Chan a petition signed by 1,400
members of the Stanford community
and a bouquet of flower stems.
Chan, who leaves for UC-Berkeley
today to recruit Cal women for the
magazine's "Girls of the Pac-10" pic
torial, said he was not impressed by
the petition and had found at Stan
ford what he came for. "We got more
girls than we need," he said, adding
that 70 women had interviewed with
him to be considered for the October
issue.
WSL member Vanessa Wenden
burg said the petition was signed by
law students, undergraduates, faculty
and administrators at Stanford. The
flower stems, she said, were "to sym
bolize the way Playboy severs the
minds and souls of women from their
bodies," using them while "in bloom"
and discarding them afterward.
"Playboy has a narrow view of
humanity and beauty," she added.
Chan said he "would have to think
about" the bouquet, adding that he
had not heard of that symbol before.
"When we photograph a young lady,
we photograph I her] in full bloom,"
he said.
The petition said that Playboy,
though "not the most heinous of por
nographers, .. . reinforces sex
stereotypes by portraying women as
sexual objects and thus furthers
sexual inequalities in our society."
Further, the petition opposed
"Playboy's use of the Stanford name
in connection with any . . . center
folds or photo displays."
According to Wendenburg, the se
ries of protests — including a White
Plaza rally Tuesday, picketing of the
hotel Wednesday and Thursday and a
forum Thursday night — was a suc
cess because the two groups had
"alerted thousands of women" to the
consequences of posing for Playboy.
In addition, the groups are plan
ning to "contact other Pac-10
campuses slated for inclusion in the
Playboy pictorial" in hopes of spark
ing opposition at other schools, ac
cording to a press release distributed
at yesterday's demonstration.
Chan said the protest at Stanford
was the biggest he had encountered in
several years and the only one thus
far on his current tour of Pacific 10
Conference schools. But rather than
hurting Playboy, the protesters have
helped give Playboy free publicity,
Chan said.
"They've done their thing in the
last few days; they've done enough
PR work. We don't need them
anymore," he said.

Chan said that among the more
than 100 women who called him to
schedule interviews, approximately
70 were seriously interested in
posing. He said he would photograph
two or three women from Stanford
for the pictorial.
Chan was scheduled to photograph
one woman yesterday afternoon be
cause he said he was almost certain
she would appear in the magazine.
"She wanted to try out for Playmate
(of the month), so I assume she'll
make it (in the Pac-10 pictorial)," he
said.
WSL member Maria Kivel said she
scheduled an interview with Chan to
talk to him about why she was
opposed to Playboy's visit. Chan, she
said, was courteous at first but then
was simply trying to "get rid" of her
and fellow WSL member Sophie
Hahn.

Chan said he does not specifically
remember speaking with Kivel and
Hahn, saying that anything the pair
said to him "went in one ear and out
the other."
In a letter they wrote Chan after
their meeting, Kivel and Hahn asked,
"Why would 1 want you to tell me I'm
beautiful ... or ugly? That you would
think 1 came for such a pronounce
ment makes me laugh."
Chan said he had not read the let
ter.
Yesterday's protest began at ap
proximately 10:45 a.m., when the
group began chanting "Porno on the
fourth floor, don't go in that front
door," and, "We are people in the
Pac-10, not entertainment for men"
from the sidewalk in front of the Palo
Alto Holiday Inn.
