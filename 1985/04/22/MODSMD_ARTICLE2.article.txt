As a parting gift to Playboy, about
30 protesters from Stanford Students
Opposed to Pornography and
Women at Stanford Law (WSL) yes
terday gave photographer David
Chan a petition signed by 1,400
members of the Stanford community
and a bouquet of flower stems.
Chan, who leaves for UC-Berkeley
today to recruit Cal women for the
magazine's "Girls of the Pac-10" pic
torial, said he was not impressed by
the petition and had found at Stan
ford what he came for. "We got more
girls than we need," he said, adding
that 70 women had interviewed with
him to be considered for the October
issue.
WSL member Vanessa Wenden
burg said the petition was signed by
law students, undergraduates, faculty
and administrators at Stanford. The
flower stems, she said, were "to sym
bolize the way Playboy severs the
minds and souls of women from their
bodies," using them while "in bloom"
and discarding them afterward.
"Playboy has a narrow view of
humanity and beauty," she added.
Chan said he "would have to think
about" the bouquet, adding that he
had not heard of that symbol before.
"When we photograph a young lady,
we photograph I her] in full bloom,"
he said.
The petition said that Playboy,
though "not the most heinous of por
nographers, .. . reinforces sex
stereotypes by portraying women as
sexual objects and thus furthers
sexual inequalities in our society."
Further, the petition opposed
"Playboy's use of the Stanford name
in connection with any . . . center
folds or photo displays."
According to Wendenburg, the se
ries of protests — including a White
Plaza rally Tuesday, picketing of the
hotel Wednesday and Thursday and a
forum Thursday night — was a suc
cess because the two groups had
"alerted thousands of women" to the
consequences of posing for Playboy.
