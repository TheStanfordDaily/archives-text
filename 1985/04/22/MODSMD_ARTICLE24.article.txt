## Harris, Cook lift Card past UCLA 
### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
Only one Stanford regular hadn't hit a home run betore
this weekend's series with visiting UCLA. Though he
carried a .357 batting average into the three-game set.
Walt Harris had the unenviable reputation as an on-base
guy, a Punch-and-Judy hitter. He was supposed to set the
table for the big guns who hit later in the order and seem
to get all the recognition.
Harris may have changed all that over the weekend. He
smacked his first career homer Saturday in Stanford's 4-6
loss to the Bruins — but that was just an omen of better
things to come. Harris saved his real heroics for yester
day's rubber game.
And it was the stuff of dreams. With two on and two out
in the bottom of the ninth and the Cardinal down 8-6,
Harris took his practice cuts. Short, choppy ones — like a
singles hitter. He was just up there to get on and keep the
rally alive. But Harris did much, much more.
After two quick strikes, Harris worked Bruin pitcher
Bill Wenrick to a 2-2 count. The next offering, a curveball
that spun more than it curved, ended the game. Harris
lashed Wenrick's mistake over the left-field fence tor a
three-run game-winning "dinger."
"It was a hanging curveball, a little high," Harris said.
"It felt absolutely terrific — I knew it was gone when I hit
it."
Bruin Asst. Coach Dennis Delany saw it the same way.
"It was a curveball, but it wasn't where it was supposed to
be. Wenrick was trying to waste a pitch, but he got it over
the plate. It was just a bad pitch, plain and simple."
Bad pitch or not, Harris' feat helped the Cardinal turn
what seemed destined to be a second-straight home loss
into a rousing comeback victory.
Stanford trailed throughout yesterday's finale — and
looked lousy in the process. UCLA got things going in the
second. Center fielder Sean Berry's second round-tripper
of the year was a grand-slam off starter Jack McDowell
that gave the Bruins the early lead. 4-0.
Stanford responded in its half of the inning with three
runs off Bruin starter Eric Nolte. Catcher John Ramos'
one-out single with the bases loaded brought in two runs.
John Verducci's two-out drag bunt scored Toi Cook from
third.

UCLA took a 6-3 lead in the fourth on catcher Todd
Zeile's two-run, two-out single to left.
Stanford stayed in the hunt with a two-run uprising in
the fifth that again cut the lead to a single run. With two
out and nobodv on, Mark Davis lined a base hit to left.
With only one swing, Lundblade turned the inning into a
Cardinal rally. Stanford's first baseman drove Nolte's first
delivery over the left-center wall for his second homer in
three days.
Lundblade. who now has 14 round-trippers to lead
Stanford, explained: "1 just got in that groove and got
some good pitches to hit."
In the seventh, the Bruins again padded their advan
tage, trying to distance themselves from the pesky Card
inal. With a runner on third and two outs, right fielder
Steve Sowell looked for a fastball on the first pitch from
Cardinal reliever Rick Dietz, who had replaced
McDowell. Sowell got it, and he gave the ball a ride.
"He was sitting on a fastball. It was at his knees, but it
wasn't a bad pitch. It was just some good hitting," Dietz
said.
The Bruins held onto their 8-5 advantage until the bot
tom of the ninth. That's when the fireworks began.
Pete Stanicek's lead-off walk and Amaro's single
through the right side of the Bruin infield started the Stan
ford rally. But a force play and sacrifice fly later, the
Cardinal was down to its last out and still in a two-run
hole.
Pinch hitter Mark Machtolf kept the fans in their seats
with an end-of-the-bat bloop single to right. That set the
stage for Sunday's hero, Harris. And you know the rest.
"1 don't know what got into Wally this weekend,"
Lundblade said, "but we certainly needed it."
Stanford skipper Mark Marquess was equally surprised:
"He (Harris) is probably the least likely guy to hit one out
for us."
For his part, Harris remained humble despite all the
hoopla. "1 think I'll mix a few homers in with my doubles
and singles now," he said. Would he start swinging for the
fences, after his unexpected power surge? "No, I'm still
