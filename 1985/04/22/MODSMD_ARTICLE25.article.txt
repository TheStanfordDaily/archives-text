# But Ivan suspended 'indefinitely'
## Women netters stop No. 1 USC â€” again 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
If you don't like to get wet or are
afraid of the dark or have no pa
tience, Saturday's Stanford-USC
women's tennis match wasn't for you.
But if you're one of those Cardinal
fans who lives and dies to beat the
USC Trojans, this match came made
to order.
Currently second- but soon to be
top-ranked Stanford beat currently
top-ranked but soon to be moving
down USC, 5-4, Saturday afternoon,
evening and night.
Never mind that Stanford was
forced to sweep all three doubles
matches to win it. Or that the match
took minutes under nine hours to
complete, thanks to a rain and a dark
ness delay. Or that it started under
cloudy skies on the three grandstand
courts at Stanford Tennis Stadium
and finished in the barn-like indoor
courts at the Bayside Tennis Club, a
topspin lob off Highway 101 in San

Carlos.
Stanford won. And concessions
from Cardinal Coach Frank Brennan
are something you won't hear. He'll
take the victory, the No. 1 ranking in
the next Intercollegiate Tennis
Coaches Assocation poll and the No.
1 seed at the rapidly approaching
NCAA championships in Oklahoma
City next month.
But as Brennan was savoring the
sweet taste of victory over the
Trojans, he also was the bearer of bad
news. Freshman Anna Ivan was out
of the lineup Saturday because she
"has been suspended indefinitely
from the Stanford women's tennis
team," Brennan said.
"She did not adjust well to the
team concept of play at Stanford,"
Brennan said last night. "I feel that
this decision is in the best interest of
Anna Ivan and the Stanford women's
tennis program."
Ivan, who was unavailable for com
ment yesterday, is ranked fourth na

tionally in singles and had an 18-1
singles record this year. She played
No. 3 singles and paired with Patty
Fendick at No. 2 doubles for most of
the season.
Other than the Ivan incident,
everything was rosy for Brennan and
company. The victory over the
Trojans was Stanford's second in
three tries this season and the second
in six days. The Cardinal defeated
USC 5-4 last Sunday in the finals of
the Longhorn-Kaepa Tennis Classic
at Austin, Texas.
But it was the way Stanford won
Saturday that had Brennan smiling.
The Cardinal trailed 4-2 after the
singles and was forced to sweep all
three doubles matches if it hoped to
raise its overall record to 22-1 and
lower USC's to 26-2.
It did.

years of coaching here after being

women tennis players and coaches stood on the Bayside Tennis Courts in San Carlos, congratulating one an
other on their victory.
down 4-2 in singles," Brennan said as
the hundred or so fans that had fol
lowed the match indoors filed out of
the Bayside complex. "Unfor
tunately, I've lost a few.
"After we were down 4-2, I looked
at the doubles matches and said to the
team, 'There's not one doubles match
we can't win,' " he continued.
"Usually there's one throw-away
match, but not this time."
The match started on time at noon,
but rain interrupted singles play for
more than an hour and the
doubles didn't begin until after 5 p.m.
At 6:45 p.m., Stanford's Linda Gates
and Leigh Anne Eldredge prevailed
7-5, 7-6 at No. 1 doubles to cut
USC's lead to 4-3.

However, it was too dark to com
plete the other two matches, which
had entered the third set with the
Cardinal ahead 3-2 at No. 2 and tied
2-2 at No. 3.
So Brennan got on the phone and
found two available indoor courts at
Bayside. Then the fans got in their
cars and found the Bayside courts in
San Carlos.
It took an hour and 20 minutes to
get the matches resumed, but all of 17
minutes to finish them.
At No. 2 doubles, the Cardinal pair
of Fendick and Alyce Werdel
quickly fell behind 4-3 before the duo
held serve, then broke it to move in
front 5-4. Meanwhile at No. 3, Stan
ford's Stephanie Savides and Kay
Tittle broke serve, held it, lost a
game, then held serve again to take a
5-3 lead.
Match-point at both courts came
simultaneously. And seconds after

Fendick volleyed a winner down the
line to win at No. 2, Savides put away
an overhead for the victory at No. 3.
Then pandemonium broke out.
"I knew we had the potential to
win the match," Tittle said of her
doubles match, in which she and
Savides lost the first set. "We also
happened to be the match that lost it
at USC (last month). So Stephanie
and 1 looked at each other and said,
'It's not going to happen again.' "
The victory was probably sweetest
for Savides. The Cardinal sophomore
entered the match 0-2 in singles and
1-3 overall against the Trojans this
season. Savides avenged those losses
Saturday. Savides and Fendick were
the only Cardinal netters to win at
both singles and doubles Saturday.
"Stephanie is really getting her due
now," Brennan said. "She's had some
problems with USC, and now she's
getting her due."

"After we were down 4-2, I looked
at the doubles matches and said to the
team, 'There's not one doubles match
we can't win,' " he continued.
"Usually there's one throw-away
match, but not this time."
The match started on time at noon,
but rain interrupted singles play for
more than an hour and the
doubles didn't begin until after 5 p.m.
At 6:45 p.m., Stanford's Linda Gates
and Leigh Anne Eldredge prevailed
7-5, 7-6 at No. 1 doubles to cut
USC's lead to 4-3.

However, it was too dark to com
plete the other two matches, which
had entered the third set with the
Cardinal ahead 3-2 at No. 2 and tied
2-2 at No. 3.
So Brennan got on the phone and
found two available indoor courts at
Bayside. Then the fans got in their
cars and found the Bayside courts in
San Carlos.
It took an hour and 20 minutes to
get the matches resumed, but all of 17
minutes to finish them.
At No. 2 doubles, the Cardinal pair
of Fendick and Alyce Werdel
quickly fell behind 4-3 before the duo
held serve, then broke it to move in
front 5-4. Meanwhile at No. 3, Stan
ford's Stephanie Savides and Kay
Tittle broke serve, held it, lost a
game, then held serve again to take a
5-3 lead.
Match-point at both courts came
simultaneously. And seconds after

Fendick volleyed a winner down the
line to win at No. 2, Savides put away
an overhead for the victory at No. 3.
Then pandemonium broke out.
"I knew we had the potential to
win the match," Tittle said of her
doubles match, in which she and
Savides lost the first set. "We also
happened to be the match that lost it
at USC (last month). So Stephanie
and 1 looked at each other and said,
'It's not going to happen again.' "
The victory was probably sweetest
for Savides. The Cardinal sophomore
entered the match 0-2 in singles and
1-3 overall against the Trojans this
season. Savides avenged those losses
Saturday. Savides and Fendick were
the only Cardinal netters to win at
both singles and doubles Saturday.
"Stephanie is really getting her due
now," Brennan said. "She's had some
problems with USC, and now she's
getting her due."
If you don't like to get wet or are
afraid of the dark or have no pa
tience, Saturday's Stanford-USC
women's tennis match wasn't for you.
But if you're one of those Cardinal
fans who lives and dies to beat the
USC Trojans, this match came made
to order.
Currently second- but soon to be
top-ranked Stanford beat currently
top-ranked but soon to be moving
down USC, 5-4, Saturday afternoon,
evening and night.
Never mind that Stanford was
forced to sweep all three doubles
matches to win it. Or that the match
took minutes under nine hours to
complete, thanks to a rain and a dark
ness delay. Or that it started under
cloudy skies on the three grandstand
courts at Stanford Tennis Stadium
and finished in the barn-like indoor
courts at the Bayside Tennis Club, a
topspin lob off Highway 101 in San

Carlos.
Stanford won. And concessions
from Cardinal Coach Frank Brennan
are something you won't hear. He'll
take the victory, the No. 1 ranking in
the next Intercollegiate Tennis
Coaches Assocation poll and the No.
1 seed at the rapidly approaching
NCAA championships in Oklahoma
City next month.
But as Brennan was savoring the
sweet taste of victory over the
Trojans, he also was the bearer of bad
news. Freshman Anna Ivan was out
of the lineup Saturday because she
"has been suspended indefinitely
from the Stanford women's tennis
team," Brennan said.
"She did not adjust well to the
team concept of play at Stanford,"
Brennan said last night. "I feel that
this decision is in the best interest of
Anna Ivan and the Stanford women's
tennis program."
Ivan, who was unavailable for com
ment yesterday, is ranked fourth na

tionally in singles and had an 18-1
singles record this year. She played
No. 3 singles and paired with Patty
Fendick at No. 2 doubles for most of
the season.
Other than the Ivan incident,
everything was rosy for Brennan and
company. The victory over the
Trojans was Stanford's second in
three tries this season and the second
in six days. The Cardinal defeated
USC 5-4 last Sunday in the finals of
the Longhorn-Kaepa Tennis Classic
at Austin, Texas.
But it was the way Stanford won
Saturday that had Brennan smiling.
The Cardinal trailed 4-2 after the
singles and was forced to sweep all
three doubles matches if it hoped to
raise its overall record to 22-1 and
lower USC's to 26-2.
It did.

years of coaching here after being

women tennis players and coaches stood on the Bayside Tennis Courts in San Carlos, congratulating one an
