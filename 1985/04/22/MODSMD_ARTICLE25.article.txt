# But Ivan suspended 'indefinitely'
## Women netters stop No. 1 USC â€” again 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
If you don't like to get wet or are
afraid of the dark or have no pa
tience, Saturday's Stanford-USC
women's tennis match wasn't for you.
But if you're one of those Cardinal
fans who lives and dies to beat the
USC Trojans, this match came made
to order.
Currently second- but soon to be
top-ranked Stanford beat currently
top-ranked but soon to be moving
down USC, 5-4, Saturday afternoon,
evening and night.
Never mind that Stanford was
forced to sweep all three doubles
matches to win it. Or that the match
took minutes under nine hours to
complete, thanks to a rain and a dark
ness delay. Or that it started under
cloudy skies on the three grandstand
courts at Stanford Tennis Stadium
and finished in the barn-like indoor
courts at the Bayside Tennis Club, a
topspin lob off Highway 101 in San

Carlos.
Stanford won. And concessions
from Cardinal Coach Frank Brennan
are something you won't hear. He'll
take the victory, the No. 1 ranking in
the next Intercollegiate Tennis
Coaches Assocation poll and the No.
1 seed at the rapidly approaching
NCAA championships in Oklahoma
City next month.
But as Brennan was savoring the
sweet taste of victory over the
Trojans, he also was the bearer of bad
news. Freshman Anna Ivan was out
of the lineup Saturday because she
"has been suspended indefinitely
from the Stanford women's tennis
team," Brennan said.
"She did not adjust well to the
team concept of play at Stanford,"
Brennan said last night. "I feel that
this decision is in the best interest of
Anna Ivan and the Stanford women's
tennis program."
Ivan, who was unavailable for com
ment yesterday, is ranked fourth na

tionally in singles and had an 18-1
singles record this year. She played
No. 3 singles and paired with Patty
Fendick at No. 2 doubles for most of
the season.
Other than the Ivan incident,
everything was rosy for Brennan and
company. The victory over the
Trojans was Stanford's second in
three tries this season and the second
in six days. The Cardinal defeated
USC 5-4 last Sunday in the finals of
the Longhorn-Kaepa Tennis Classic
at Austin, Texas.
But it was the way Stanford won
Saturday that had Brennan smiling.
The Cardinal trailed 4-2 after the
singles and was forced to sweep all
three doubles matches if it hoped to
raise its overall record to 22-1 and
lower USC's to 26-2.
It did.

Nearly nine hours after they had stepped onto the Stanford Tennis Stadium courts to face USC, the Stanford
women tennis players and coaches stood on the Bayside Tennis Courts in San Carlos, congratulating one an
other on their victory.
