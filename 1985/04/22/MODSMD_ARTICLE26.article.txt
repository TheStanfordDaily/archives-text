### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
In its second time around against
Pacific 10 Conference opponents
UCLA and USC this weekend, the
Stanford men's tennis team knew ex
actly what it needed to do to win: get
four of six singles matches or two of
three doubles matches.
Unfortunately, it didn't come close
to that goal — or to doing much of
anything, for that matter. The Card
inal suffered one of its worst losses
ever to UCLA Friday, 8-1, followed
by a 5-4 loss to USC Saturday.
Stanford went into the matches
ranked No. 1 in the country, but after
this second loss to No. 2-ranked USC
and first loss to No. 4-ranked UCLA,
the Cardinal will undoubtedly take a
dive in the next polls. Coach Dick
Gould did his best to find something
positive in that fact.
"Some of the guys have been
playing afraid to lose, and now that
we're no longer No. 1, maybe we'll
start playing to win," Gould said.
The pressure may be off the Card
inal, but the speed of its fall was un
expected. Stanford had only lost one
match all season before Friday — a 5-
4 defeat at the hands of USC several
weeks ago.
Gould described the way his team
came out against UCLA Friday as
"atrocious." Stanford dropped five of
six singles matches to clinch its
second dual match loss of the season
before doubles competition even got
underway.
Dan Goldie, ranked No. 1, lost to
Michael Kures, No. 8 in the country,
6-3, 6-4. Stanford's Jim Grabb,
ranked No. 2, lost to No. 11 Jeff
Klaparda, 3-6, 7-5, 6-3. The list of

losses continued down to No. 6
singles, where Pat McEnroe defeated
David Livingston in straight sets for
what proved to be the Cardinal's only
match win of the day.
"Pat found a way to win — no one
else did," Gould said. "1 really want
to get the point across that there's a
big difference between wanting to
win and finding a way to win. Pat was
the only one to find that way," he
said.
Although Gould said he bears re
sponsibility for not getting his team
ready to play Friday, he also said
UCLA is "definitely the hottest team
in the nation" right now.
"UCLA is playing very well. It won
five out of six singles matches when it
played USC. They are solidly the top
team right now," Gould said.
Stanford, on the other hand, ap
pears to need some work if it expects
to be a championship team.
"Any way you look at it, against
UCLA, USC and SMU — our tough
est matches of the season so far —
we've won five of 18 total doubles
matches. A championship team
doesn't do that," Gould said.
Stanford lost all three doubles
matches to UCLA, but because the
match outcome had already been
decided by UCLA's five singles
match victories, there wasn't quite
the same incentive for the Cardinal to
do well.
In Saturday's match against USC,
however, the doubles matches were
probably what cost Stanford the loss,
its third of the season.
The teams were tied 3-3 after
singles competition, and were 1-1 in

doubles matches before Stanford's
No. 3 doubles team of Scott Moody
and John Letts lost 2-6, 7-5, 6-2 to
Rick Leach and Eric Amend. Stan
ford was up a service break in the
third set, but could not hold on to the
lead and lost the set. the doubles
match, and the match as a whole.
The doubles teams often get undue
blame for dual-match losses because
they play last, but losing two out of
three doubles matches is a bad habit
Stanford has fallen into.
It happened to the Cardinal last
year in the finals of the NCAA
championships against UCLA. Stan
ford lost two of three doubles
matches, and the national title, 5-4.
It happened again to the Cardinal
in the Pac-10 match against USC
played at Stanford three weeks ago.
That 5-4 loss — the first of the 1985
season for Stanford — also followed
two out of three doubles losses.
What's frustrating for Gould is that

he and his team know what needs to
be done to win the national champi
onship, but as Gould said, knowing is
very different from doing.
"The base is there, but we have to
work on mechanics," Gould said. "1
think we can change things around,
but we're going to have to do it aw
fully fast. There isn't much time," he
said.
The NCAA tournament will begin
May 18. The toughest matches left on
Stanford's schedule are against No. 5
Pepperdine April 30 and No. 12 Cali
fornia May 3.
If there was a small bright spot in
this weekend's matches, Stanford's
No. 1 doubles team of Grabb and
Goldie did defeat USC's Todd
Witsken and Jorge Lozano, 6-3, 7-6.
Witsken and Lozano, ranked No. 1
nationally, were previously unde
feated in 17 matches.
Grabb is ranked No. 3 in doubles,
but that ranking was based on
matches with his original partner,
John Letts. Gould split up Grabb and
Letts before. Stanford's first matches
with UCLA and USC. As of yet.

Grabb and Goldie are not ranked to
gether as a doubles team.
Goldie lost both of his No. 1 singles
matches, however, and will probably
drop from his current top national
ranking. Along with the loss to
UCLA's Kures. Goldie was upset by
4th-ranked Witsken, 7-5, 6-4.
Grabb split his singles matches,
soundly defeating USC's Rick Leach.
6-2, 6-3, after his three-set loss to
UCLA's Klaparda the day before.
Grabb was one of the few Stanford
players who came back after Friday's
K-l blowout to win a match Saturday.
Gould said he didn't know how his
team would react to Friday's loss.
"I had no idea how we would play
(Saturday). We started out atro
ciously again — it looked like it
would be another 5-1 situation (after
the singles)," Gould said.
"Whenever you're put in the situa
tion we were put in of playing the two
top teams in the country within two
days, you have to be ready to play.
And we just weren't leady. It was a
great opportunity to do well, but we
didn't," Gould said.

Stanford has fallen into.
It happened to the Cardinal last
year in the finals of the NCAA
championships against UCLA. Stan
ford lost two of three doubles
matches, and the national title, 5-4.
It happened again to the Cardinal
in the Pac-10 match against USC
played at Stanford three weeks ago.
That 5-4 loss — the first of the 1985
season for Stanford — also followed
two out of three doubles losses.
What's frustrating for Gould is that

he and his team know what needs to
be done to win the national champi
onship, but as Gould said, knowing is
very different from doing.
"The base is there, but we have to
work on mechanics," Gould said. "1
think we can change things around,
but we're going to have to do it aw
fully fast. There isn't much time," he
said.
The NCAA tournament will begin
May 18. The toughest matches left on
Stanford's schedule are against No. 5
Pepperdine April 30 and No. 12 Cali
fornia May 3.
If there was a small bright spot in
this weekend's matches, Stanford's
No. 1 doubles team of Grabb and
Goldie did defeat USC's Todd
Witsken and Jorge Lozano, 6-3, 7-6.
Witsken and Lozano, ranked No. 1
nationally, were previously unde
feated in 17 matches.
Grabb is ranked No. 3 in doubles,
but that ranking was based on
matches with his original partner,
John Letts. Gould split up Grabb and
Letts before. Stanford's first matches
with UCLA and USC. As of yet.

Grabb and Goldie are not ranked to
gether as a doubles team.
Goldie lost both of his No. 1 singles
matches, however, and will probably
drop from his current top national
ranking. Along with the loss to
UCLA's Kures. Goldie was upset by
4th-ranked Witsken, 7-5, 6-4.
Grabb split his singles matches,
soundly defeating USC's Rick Leach.
6-2, 6-3, after his three-set loss to
UCLA's Klaparda the day before.
Grabb was one of the few Stanford
players who came back after Friday's
K-l blowout to win a match Saturday.
Gould said he didn't know how his
team would react to Friday's loss.
"I had no idea how we would play
(Saturday). We started out atro
ciously again — it looked like it
would be another 5-1 situation (after
the singles)," Gould said.
"Whenever you're put in the situa
tion we were put in of playing the two
top teams in the country within two
days, you have to be ready to play.
And we just weren't leady. It was a
great opportunity to do well, but we
didn't," Gould said.
In its second time around against
Pacific 10 Conference opponents
UCLA and USC this weekend, the
Stanford men's tennis team knew ex
actly what it needed to do to win: get
four of six singles matches or two of
three doubles matches.
Unfortunately, it didn't come close
to that goal — or to doing much of
anything, for that matter. The Card
inal suffered one of its worst losses
ever to UCLA Friday, 8-1, followed
by a 5-4 loss to USC Saturday.
Stanford went into the matches
ranked No. 1 in the country, but after
this second loss to No. 2-ranked USC
and first loss to No. 4-ranked UCLA,
the Cardinal will undoubtedly take a
dive in the next polls. Coach Dick
Gould did his best to find something
positive in that fact.
"Some of the guys have been
playing afraid to lose, and now that
we're no longer No. 1, maybe we'll
start playing to win," Gould said.
The pressure may be off the Card
inal, but the speed of its fall was un
expected. Stanford had only lost one
match all season before Friday — a 5-
4 defeat at the hands of USC several
weeks ago.
Gould described the way his team
came out against UCLA Friday as
"atrocious." Stanford dropped five of
six singles matches to clinch its
second dual match loss of the season
before doubles competition even got
underway.
Dan Goldie, ranked No. 1, lost to
Michael Kures, No. 8 in the country,
6-3, 6-4. Stanford's Jim Grabb,
ranked No. 2, lost to No. 11 Jeff
Klaparda, 3-6, 7-5, 6-3. The list of

losses continued down to No. 6
singles, where Pat McEnroe defeated
David Livingston in straight sets for
what proved to be the Cardinal's only
match win of the day.
"Pat found a way to win — no one
else did," Gould said. "1 really want
to get the point across that there's a
big difference between wanting to
win and finding a way to win. Pat was
the only one to find that way," he
said.
Although Gould said he bears re
sponsibility for not getting his team
ready to play Friday, he also said
UCLA is "definitely the hottest team
in the nation" right now.
"UCLA is playing very well. It won
five out of six singles matches when it
played USC. They are solidly the top
team right now," Gould said.
Stanford, on the other hand, ap
pears to need some work if it expects
to be a championship team.
"Any way you look at it, against
UCLA, USC and SMU — our tough
est matches of the season so far —
we've won five of 18 total doubles
matches. A championship team
doesn't do that," Gould said.
Stanford lost all three doubles
matches to UCLA, but because the
match outcome had already been
decided by UCLA's five singles
match victories, there wasn't quite
the same incentive for the Cardinal to
do well.
In Saturday's match against USC,
however, the doubles matches were
probably what cost Stanford the loss,
its third of the season.
The teams were tied 3-3 after
singles competition, and were 1-1 in

doubles matches before Stanford's
No. 3 doubles team of Scott Moody
and John Letts lost 2-6, 7-5, 6-2 to
Rick Leach and Eric Amend. Stan
ford was up a service break in the
third set, but could not hold on to the
lead and lost the set. the doubles
match, and the match as a whole.
