In its second time around against
Pacific 10 Conference opponents
UCLA and USC this weekend, the
Stanford men's tennis team knew ex
actly what it needed to do to win: get
four of six singles matches or two of
three doubles matches.
Unfortunately, it didn't come close
to that goal — or to doing much of
anything, for that matter. The Card
inal suffered one of its worst losses
ever to UCLA Friday, 8-1, followed
by a 5-4 loss to USC Saturday.
Stanford went into the matches
ranked No. 1 in the country, but after
this second loss to No. 2-ranked USC
and first loss to No. 4-ranked UCLA,
the Cardinal will undoubtedly take a
dive in the next polls. Coach Dick
Gould did his best to find something
positive in that fact.
"Some of the guys have been
playing afraid to lose, and now that
we're no longer No. 1, maybe we'll
start playing to win," Gould said.
The pressure may be off the Card
inal, but the speed of its fall was un
expected. Stanford had only lost one
match all season before Friday — a 5-
4 defeat at the hands of USC several
weeks ago.
Gould described the way his team
came out against UCLA Friday as
"atrocious." Stanford dropped five of
six singles matches to clinch its
second dual match loss of the season
before doubles competition even got
underway.
Dan Goldie, ranked No. 1, lost to
Michael Kures, No. 8 in the country,
6-3, 6-4. Stanford's Jim Grabb,
ranked No. 2, lost to No. 11 Jeff
Klaparda, 3-6, 7-5, 6-3. The list of

losses continued down to No. 6
singles, where Pat McEnroe defeated
David Livingston in straight sets for
what proved to be the Cardinal's only
match win of the day.
"Pat found a way to win — no one
else did," Gould said. "1 really want
to get the point across that there's a
big difference between wanting to
win and finding a way to win. Pat was
the only one to find that way," he
said.
Although Gould said he bears re
sponsibility for not getting his team
ready to play Friday, he also said
UCLA is "definitely the hottest team
in the nation" right now.
"UCLA is playing very well. It won
five out of six singles matches when it
played USC. They are solidly the top
team right now," Gould said.
Stanford, on the other hand, ap
pears to need some work if it expects
to be a championship team.
"Any way you look at it, against
UCLA, USC and SMU — our tough
est matches of the season so far —
we've won five of 18 total doubles
matches. A championship team
doesn't do that," Gould said.
Stanford lost all three doubles
matches to UCLA, but because the
match outcome had already been
decided by UCLA's five singles
match victories, there wasn't quite
the same incentive for the Cardinal to
do well.
In Saturday's match against USC,
however, the doubles matches were
probably what cost Stanford the loss,
its third of the season.
The teams were tied 3-3 after
singles competition, and were 1-1 in
