# Underclassmen golfers take third

For the 19th time in the last 21 seasons, the Brigham
Young University men's golf team — No. 7 in the most
recent national rankings — captured the championship in
its own Cougar Classic, defeating a largely outclassed field
at the Riverside Country Club in Provo, Utah.
The Cardinal golfers, playing without their three top
starters — seniors Tim Robinson, Doug Thompson and
Scott Erickson — finished a very respectable third, shoot
ing 1,094 for the three-round tournament. BYU's win
ning total was 1,068 and New Mexico took second place
at 1,090.
The absence of the three seniors in Utah was part of an
experiment being carried out by Stanford Coach Tim
Schaaf. He played at BYU the six golfers who will be re
turning to next year's team to see how they would com
pete as a unit. Thus, he was pleased, not disappointed,
with the third-place finish.

"The group as a whole played well," Schaaf said. "We
played against their (BYU's) top five and were only be
hind by eight after the second round."
Schaaf said that this weekend's performance should be
a confidence-builder for the six golfers come next year.
"It proved to those guys that they are a good group of
players and with a reasonable amount of improvement
could be excellent next year," he said.
The individual competition at the Cougar Classic was
dominated by host BYU. Cougar freshman Brent
Franklin fired a 10-under 206 for the three rounds to
capture the first-place trophy. Franklin set the course on
fire Saturday, firing a final-round 63 over the par-72
course.
Stanford sophomore Rich Marik finished in a tie for
sixth place with Colorado's Matt Potter, shooting a 3-
under 213. Marik's performance marked his second con
secutive strong showing. Last weekend he captured

second place in the Stanford U.S. Intercollegiate on the
Stanford Golf Course.
Schaaf is obviously delighted with Marik's recent play.
"Rich Marik is playing as well as anybody (on the team),"
Schaaf said.
Schaaf was also encouraged by sophomore Cole
Thompson's performance in Utah. Thompson shot 217
for the tournament. "Cole hasn't played much (this
season), but this is the best he's played since he's been at
Stanford," Schaaf said.
Junior Carl Wagner, who finished fourth last weekend
at the Stanford U.S. Intercollegiate, continued to shoot
well this weekend, finishing at 218 for the tournament.
Other Stanford scores included freshman John Dickey at
222, junior Phil Rowley at 226 and junior Don Walsworth
at 228.
Robinson, Doug Thompson and Erickson will return to
the line-up this week as the Cardinal men travel for two
major tournaments.
