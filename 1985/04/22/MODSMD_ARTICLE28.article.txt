# Card track teams win
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Staff sportswriter 
Under cold and windy conditions, the Stanford
men's and women's track teams each posted its fifth
dual-meet victory over visiting Cal State-Northridge.
The Cardinal women, shifted around in an experi
mental lineup that saw some distance and middle
distance specialists running in unfamiliar events, hand
ily defeated its outmatched Northridge opponent. 86-
52.
"1 changed the kids around in some events so they
wouldn't get stale," said Stanford Head Coach Brooks
Johnson. "I wanted them to have some fun, which is
really what it is all about, rather than just being hyper
competitive."
Trailing after only the high jump competition, the
first event of the meet, the Cardinal women took com
mand five events later to go ahead 34-15, a lead they
never relinquished.
Overall, the Stanford women won 10 out of the 16
total events and placed no worse than second in every
event.
Denise Gaztambide, the Cardinal women's heptath
lete, displayed her versatile talents en route to three
second-place showings, in the javelin, high jump and
triple jump.
As has been the case for most of the season, the
Stanford women ran well in both the middle-distance
and distance events, claiming all the first-place finishes
in both categories.
Distance runner Kathy Smith, who recorded a per
sonal best time of 9:53.0, led the way in a Cardinal
sweep in the 3,000 meters. Kathy Kozak and Tammy
Thomas scored second and third place, respectively.
The Cardinal depth was also evident in the 800
meters, as the first four positions were occupied by
Stanford runners, headed by Marcia Martin, who came
in with a time of 2:14.74.
The Cardinal men, on the other hand, recorded only
one sweep during the afternoon, a crucial and decisive
one-two-three placing in the 5,000 meters to ensure
their 82-76 victory over Northridge.
Entering the pivotal 5,000 race, the second-to-last
event of the day, the Stanford men narrowly led 73-71
and desperately needed a strong performance. They
got just that.
With just less than 400 meters left in the race, the
tightly packed foursome suddenly dissipated as Stan
ford's Ryan Stoll and Mark Olesen surged ahead with
Olesen eventually outkicking Stoll for the win. Fresh
man Steve Schadler rounded out the sweep, finishing
third.
Johnson called the Cardinal men's victory "a col
lectively pretty good effort" and was pleased with the
clutch performance shown in the 5,000 meters.
"[lt was the] next-to-last competition and we com
peted well. That's a mark of a good team, to come
through when you have to. To be a great team, you
beat the teams you're not suppose to beat. We're not a
great team yet," Johnson said matter-of-factly.
Stanford's Shaun Pickering had a field day, contribu
ting 11 points to the Cardinal total. Pickering won both
the discus and hammer, outbattling teammate Brian
Masterson in the latter event, while capturing third
place in the shotput.
