# Wiggin: 'It's fun to be back in it again'
## 
### PETER HAVEN Staff sportswriter 
When Paul Wiggin walked away
from Stanford football a little more
than a year ago, he took a lot of
memories with him — both good and
bad.
W'iggin's last game here as head
coach ended on a note that, unfortun
ately for him, summed up his last
season and perhaps his coaching
career here on the Farm.
On the rainy, soggy turf of Stanford
Stadium, Wiggin's Cardinal lost a
sloppy Big Game to California, 27-
18. It was the last loss for a man
whose four-year stint as head coach
had produced a 16-28 record.
But last March, Wiggin resurfaced
into the world of football coaching in
a place that surprised some of those
who witnessed his last days here —
Eden Prairie, Minn., and the main
offices of the NFL's Minnesota
Vikings.
When Coach Bud Grant reclaimed
the job he had left in the hands of Les
Steckel one year before, Wiggin saw
an opportunity and took it. Grant
named Wiggin his defensive line
coach, and no one could be happier
about it than Wiggin himself.
"Well, I like it," Wiggin said in a
phone interview from the Vikings'
offices. "I've always enjoyed football.
In the year I was out, 1 watched a lot
of it and went to a lot of games. It's
fun to be back in it again."
Though Wiggin's last days here
weren't the most pleasant, his attrac
tion to football and his love of Stan
ford were strong enough to lure him
back to the stadium to watch his
players play without him. He did that
for the USC, Washington and Illinois
games this past season.
"I miss the kids," Wiggin said.
"Stanford is my school, and I still
think a lot of it. My roots are there."

Wiggin, who transfered to the
Farm from Modesto Junior College in
1954, was a three-year starter at of
fensive and defensive tackle. In 1955
and 1956, under then-Head Coach
Chuck Taylor, he earned firts-team
All-America honors and was the
Cardinal co-captain in 1956.
After an 11-year career as a pro
fessional player with the Cleveland
Browns, Wiggin embarked on a 12-
year odyssey through the coaching
ranks. His travels included stops for
coaching jobs with the Kansas City
Chiefs, the San Francisco 49ers and
the New Orleans Saints.
And then, on Feb. 1, 1980, Wiggin
came back to the Farm as the Card
inal's new head coach.
In four years here, there were high
points and lows. On the field,
however, the lows outnumbered the
highs, and in his last campaign, 1983,
Stanford could muster only a 1-10
record. After the sixth game of that
season. Athletic Director Andy
Geiger met with Wiggin and, in ef
fect, asked Wiggin to resign.
For Wiggin, the experience was a
"painful" one.
"It was difficult for me, but I don't
think anybody saw any form of
resentment on my part," Wiggin said.
"No matter what idealistic things are
expected of a football coach, the bot
tom line is you must win.
"In all honesty, it (the coaching
career at Stanford) wasn't a total fail
ure. I think there were some good
things there," he said.
But would he ever tackle the job
again?
"No. Not because it isn't a great
job. For me it was difficult. I wore
two hats — head football coach and
alum. There were guilts that really
came from not being able to live up to
expectations. If it (the Stanford
coaching job) works, it would be a

fabulous job."
The pressures of being a head foot
ball coach are many, but at Stanford,
where coaches must assemble a team
of young men that must must live up
to rigorous academic as well as physi
cal challenges, the pressure is intensi
fied.
For a head football coach,
"Stanford is not an easy place to

function," Wiggin said.
For example, Wiggin would have
liked to have been able to recruit
more junior college transfers. The
junior college resource is one area
Jack Elway, Wiggin's successor, has
already tapped.
"I would have liked to have had the
ability to recruit more junior college
players," Wiggin said. "And we tried

to do that, but couldn't. Those were
the rules. I think that what they're
doing now is right."
The switch from the spotlight that
surrounds the head coach to the rela
ti\e obscurity of the assistant coach is
a transition that Wiggin isn't exactly
regretting.
"I don't want to be that (head
coach) again." Wiggin said. "I don't
want to go through the feeling of
walking back from the stadium after
some bad things had happened. I
don't want to feel that way again. Life
is just too short for that."
In the next breath, however, Wig
gin is quick to say that he is not em
bittered about his experience as the
Stanford head coach.
"I don't want any sour grapes to
come out of this. There's a lot of good
feelings and great people there
(Stanford). I don't want any embit
terment to come out of that. Stanford
is a real class place, and I have some
very fond memories there."
Now that Wiggin is back in coach
ing again, he is displaying a confi
dence and competitive spirit that one
would expect from a former college
All-America and professional Pro-
Bowler.
"I'm looking forward to being with
my own group of people (the defen
sive line), and I don't want anybody
taking over my people or pulling me
aside and telling me how to do my
job," he said. "I figure I'm as good a
line coach as anybody anywhere, and
I wouldn't want anyone to take over
my job."
"I'm thrilled to be back with a guy
like Bud Grant and to be back in
football again. And you watch. I'm
going to do a damn good job. I'm not
saying I'm going to lead this team to
the Super Bowl, but I'm going to do
the best I can," Wiggin said.

Although the unsettling experience
of being fired from one s job is
enough to shake anyone's confidence,
Wiggin was bolstered by an event that
occurred in the interim between his
Stanford and Minnesota jobs — the
Los Angeles Olympic Games.
Peter Ueberroth, head of the Los
Angeles Olympic Organizing Com
mittee, selected one special envoy for
each country at the Games. The job
involved living and working with the
country's team and making sure that
everything went smoothly for the ath
letes. Wiggin was appointed to the
U.S. team. •.
For the former head coach, the job
meant that he had to prepare for
months in advance, command a 16-
person staff, and be in charge of
everything from transporting kayaks
to Lake Casitas to making sure secur
ity was up to par.
"It was a great experience. 1
needed that. The last experience 1
had wasn't a good one," Wiggin said.
"There was a sense of accomplish
ment and doing a good job. It was a
big job, and I feel I handled it well."
Administration has always been
one of Wiggin's strong points, but he
again says he is happy to be out of the
"walk-around" role.
The assistant coach-head coach re
lationship is like that of the teacher
and administrator, Wiggin said. And
now Paul Wiggin is excited about
being a teacher again in the field of
his expertise — the football field. He
is, once more, reunited with his natu
ral element.
"There's a little boy in all of us,"
Wiggin said. "And there's a little boy
in coaching, even when you get to be
Paul Wiggin's age."
One gets the feeling that Wiggin,
at the age of 50, is younger and
stronger than ever — and a little bit
wiser.

of being fired from one s job is
enough to shake anyone's confidence,
Wiggin was bolstered by an event that
occurred in the interim between his
Stanford and Minnesota jobs — the
Los Angeles Olympic Games.

Paul Wiggin is back on the sidelines again — this time with the Min
nesota Vikings — and he's predicting that he'll do a "damn good job."
When Paul Wiggin walked away
from Stanford football a little more
than a year ago, he took a lot of
memories with him — both good and
bad.
W'iggin's last game here as head
coach ended on a note that, unfortun
ately for him, summed up his last
season and perhaps his coaching
career here on the Farm.
On the rainy, soggy turf of Stanford
Stadium, Wiggin's Cardinal lost a
sloppy Big Game to California, 27-
18. It was the last loss for a man
whose four-year stint as head coach
had produced a 16-28 record.
But last March, Wiggin resurfaced
into the world of football coaching in
a place that surprised some of those
who witnessed his last days here —
Eden Prairie, Minn., and the main
offices of the NFL's Minnesota
Vikings.
When Coach Bud Grant reclaimed
the job he had left in the hands of Les
Steckel one year before, Wiggin saw
an opportunity and took it. Grant
named Wiggin his defensive line
coach, and no one could be happier
about it than Wiggin himself.
"Well, I like it," Wiggin said in a
phone interview from the Vikings'
offices. "I've always enjoyed football.
In the year I was out, 1 watched a lot
of it and went to a lot of games. It's
fun to be back in it again."
Though Wiggin's last days here
weren't the most pleasant, his attrac
tion to football and his love of Stan
ford were strong enough to lure him
back to the stadium to watch his
players play without him. He did that
for the USC, Washington and Illinois
games this past season.
"I miss the kids," Wiggin said.
"Stanford is my school, and I still
think a lot of it. My roots are there."

Wiggin, who transfered to the
Farm from Modesto Junior College in
1954, was a three-year starter at of
fensive and defensive tackle. In 1955
and 1956, under then-Head Coach
Chuck Taylor, he earned firts-team
All-America honors and was the
Cardinal co-captain in 1956.
After an 11-year career as a pro
fessional player with the Cleveland
Browns, Wiggin embarked on a 12-
year odyssey through the coaching
ranks. His travels included stops for
coaching jobs with the Kansas City
Chiefs, the San Francisco 49ers and
the New Orleans Saints.
And then, on Feb. 1, 1980, Wiggin
came back to the Farm as the Card
inal's new head coach.
In four years here, there were high
points and lows. On the field,
however, the lows outnumbered the
highs, and in his last campaign, 1983,
Stanford could muster only a 1-10
record. After the sixth game of that
season. Athletic Director Andy
Geiger met with Wiggin and, in ef
fect, asked Wiggin to resign.
For Wiggin, the experience was a
"painful" one.
"It was difficult for me, but I don't
think anybody saw any form of
resentment on my part," Wiggin said.
"No matter what idealistic things are
expected of a football coach, the bot
tom line is you must win.
"In all honesty, it (the coaching
career at Stanford) wasn't a total fail
ure. I think there were some good
things there," he said.
But would he ever tackle the job
again?
"No. Not because it isn't a great
job. For me it was difficult. I wore
two hats — head football coach and
alum. There were guilts that really
came from not being able to live up to
expectations. If it (the Stanford
coaching job) works, it would be a

fabulous job."
The pressures of being a head foot
ball coach are many, but at Stanford,
where coaches must assemble a team
of young men that must must live up
to rigorous academic as well as physi
cal challenges, the pressure is intensi
fied.
For a head football coach,
"Stanford is not an easy place to

function," Wiggin said.
For example, Wiggin would have
liked to have been able to recruit
more junior college transfers. The
junior college resource is one area
Jack Elway, Wiggin's successor, has
already tapped.
"I would have liked to have had the
ability to recruit more junior college
players," Wiggin said. "And we tried

to do that, but couldn't. Those were
the rules. I think that what they're
doing now is right."
The switch from the spotlight that
surrounds the head coach to the rela
ti\e obscurity of the assistant coach is
a transition that Wiggin isn't exactly
regretting.
"I don't want to be that (head
coach) again." Wiggin said. "I don't
want to go through the feeling of
walking back from the stadium after
some bad things had happened. I
don't want to feel that way again. Life
is just too short for that."
In the next breath, however, Wig
gin is quick to say that he is not em
bittered about his experience as the
Stanford head coach.
"I don't want any sour grapes to
come out of this. There's a lot of good
feelings and great people there
(Stanford). I don't want any embit
terment to come out of that. Stanford
is a real class place, and I have some
very fond memories there."
Now that Wiggin is back in coach
ing again, he is displaying a confi
dence and competitive spirit that one
would expect from a former college
All-America and professional Pro-
Bowler.
"I'm looking forward to being with
my own group of people (the defen
sive line), and I don't want anybody
taking over my people or pulling me
aside and telling me how to do my
job," he said. "I figure I'm as good a
line coach as anybody anywhere, and
I wouldn't want anyone to take over
my job."
"I'm thrilled to be back with a guy
like Bud Grant and to be back in
football again. And you watch. I'm
going to do a damn good job. I'm not
saying I'm going to lead this team to
the Super Bowl, but I'm going to do
the best I can," Wiggin said.

Although the unsettling experience
