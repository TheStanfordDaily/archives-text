### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
Residents of three University houses on
"probation" during the Undergraduate Housing
Draw say the prospects of their houses filling
look very positive.
Two co-ops. Terra and Synergy, and one
theme house, the French House, are now on
probation because of problems filling in previous
Draws. In order to avoid becoming themeless
self-operated houses, the three residences on
probation must fill at least 90 percent of their as
signable undergraduate spaces by the end of the
Draw's second round.
After intensive outreach programs designed to
generate interest in the houses, residents say they
expect to make it through the Draw, which
begins tomorrow, with no problems.
Deborah Camiel. a resident of Terra, esti
mated that nearly 200 priorities had been given
to people interested in living in Terra.
More than "150 people came to our open
house on Tuesday night and that was just one
night," Camiel said. "Many of them are also
coming back for a second priority."
Beth Povell. another resident of Terra, said
Terra residents spoke at various house meetings
and distributed written invitations to dinner in
order to spark interest in the house. Average at
tendance at these dinners was approximately
seven people per night. Povell said.
With 43 spaces available to undergraduates.
Terra must fill 39 of those spaces by round two of
the Draw.
"It's looking very positive â€” I know a lot of
people who want to live here now." Povell said.
"I'm unguaranteed, and I have the feeling I'm
going to have a hard time.
Jack Chin, a resident assistant at Synergy, said
interest in Synergy has "definitely been a lot bet
ter than last year." Approximately 150 to 200

students attended a Synergy party on Friday, ac
cording to Chin.
Attendance at open houses last Monday and
Tuesday was not as high. Chin said, "hut Synergy
always has a problem bccause we're so far from
the center of campus."
During the two days of open house. Chin esti
mated that 30 people had shown up to see
Synergy.
"Hut that's a lot better than last year, since
then it was more like six people," lie said.
Synergy has 44 assignable undergraduate
spaces and 12 spaces reserved for graduate stu
dents. Approximately 75 priorities have been

issued so far. Chin said.
"We don't know how high people are putting
Synergy on their priority list, and it all depends
how well thc> draw, too," Chin said. "It's hard to
tell how we'll do right now." .
The French House has issued an
"extraordinary number of house agreements."
according to RA Claude Millman. Residents
have issued approximately 100 priorities to those
interested in living in I.a Maison Francaise.
Millman said priorities were issued before the
Draw began and also will be available this week.
