# Spikers make playoffs

The Cardinal men's volleyball team will be more than a
wallflower at the NCAA Western Regional party in
Northridge this weekend. Stanford, a debutante of sorts,
will be right out there on the dance floor.
The men received an invitation to the prestigious event
Friday evening when UC-Santa Barbara came back to
dump Hawaii in five sets, 15-11, 11-15, 12-15, 15-5, 15-
6.
The Gauchos victory, which followed their uninspired
four-set loss to the same Hawaii squad Wednesday, left
Stanford, at 10-8, alone in fifth in the California Intercol
legiate Volleyball Association. The top five teams in the
CIVA are traditionally awarded tickets south.

With the setback, Hawaii finished 9-9 and in sixth while
Santa Barbara, 11-7, ended the year in fourth.
The Cardinal players must have been biting their nails
waiting for a report on Friday's game. If the Rainbows
had won — and they were in command with a two-sets-to
one lead — three teams, including the Cardinal, would
have concluded with 10-8 marks. And only two of the
three could go to the regionals.
Under the unusual tie-breaking procedures, Stanford
would have been the odd team out.
The regionals, held in Northridge to determine the
final spot entry into the round of four, will feature USC,
UCLA, Santa Barbara and Stanford. The Cardinal will be
making its first-ever playoff appearance after its first-ever
above-.500 league season.
