# Softball takes 1 in Reno

### DAVE DUTCHER Senior sportswriter 
Some bad weather that pitchers enjoyed, some revenge
and a victory were the highlights of the Stanford Softball
team's second day at the Reno, Nev. Invitational.
The Cardinal, 11-45, won one and lost two games
Friday after losing three Thursday. The first five games
constituted the round-robin portion of the tournament,
and the final game — a 7-5 loss to host Nevada-Reno —
was part of the subsequent single-elimination portion that
determined final tournament standings.
High winds were a key factor in Stanford's first game
Friday, a 1-0 loss to Oregon. The Ducks scored in the bot
tom of the seventh off loser Lisa Buchanan, 5-20, when
Chrissi Long hit a one-out double. An out later, Capi
Lynn singled to left and went to second when Cathy Taft
unsuccessfully tried to throw Long out at third. Susan Ul
rich, who had two of Oregon's five hits, then drove Long
home with a single on an 0-2 pitch.
"The wind in Reno just picked up," Stanford catcher
Laura Buchanan said. "There were some real strong
winds, and it was hard to concentrate on hitting the ball. It
was hard to keep our eyes on the ball. But Lisa's
(Buchanan) changeup was just devastating in the wind.
Our pitchers like to pitch when it's windy."
Stanford paid back a "debt" in its lone tournament vic
tory, over St. Mary's, 3-0, in its second game Friday.
"The first game we played them (March 12) was the
one Margaret (Pezzini) got hurt in," Laura Buchanan
said. "We thought it was a bad play, and we really just
wanted to beat them for Margaret. Her birthday is next

week, so we thought we'd get her a nice present."
The Cardinal got all the offense it needed for winner
Betsy Watson in the first inning. Laura Buchanan, who
had two of Stanford's seven hits, led off with a single and
went to second on Dominguez's sacrifice, but didn't ad
vance when Taft got on after an error.
After Taft stole second, Lisa Buchanan walked to load
the bases. Laura Buchanan then scored on Bautista's
sacrifice fly to left, but Taft and Lisa Buchanan didn't ad
vance.
Stanford got its other two runs in the third. Taft led off
with a single, stole second, went to third on a wild pitch
and scored on Lisa Buchanan's single. Bautista then hit
into a fielder's choice, forcing Buchanan at second.
After Sanchez struck out, De La Rosa singled and
Bautista, trying to go to third, scored on the left fielder's
throwing error. De La Rosa went to third on the play, but
the inning ended on Bush's groundout.
The Cardinal got its biggest inning of the tournament
against Nevada-Reno, scoring five runs with the help of
three errors to go ahead, 5-0, in the second. However,
Stanford's offense disappeared thereafter and the
Wolfpack scored in the second through fifth innings.
"They just got pumped up and hit the heck out of the
ball," Laura Buchanan said of the Wolfpack, which had
10 hits to the Cardinal's eight. "I talked to a couple of
players who said they had had a long losing streak and
they really wanted to hit the ball. They've seen our
pitchers, and they're used to them. They were primed to
hit the ball."
