# Doctors split Siamese twins
## 
### 
Doctors at Stanford Hospital suc
cessfully separated a pair of Siamese
twin girls Saturday.
The twins, who are now 21 days
old. were joined at the abdomen be
tween the sternum and the navel.
They were reported in stable condi
tion after the operation.
Doctors had expected the opera
tion to take four hours because they
thought the twins' livers were joined.
However, the livers were separate,
and the entire operation was com
pleted in three hours.
Dr. Stephen Shochat, the surgeon
who led the team that separated the
twins, estimated the twins will remain
at the hospital for about two weeks.
He said they may have minor ab
dominal scars because of the opera
tion, but would suffer no other long
term effects.
The twins were born at Watsonville
General Hospital April 2 and trans
ferred to Stanford.
