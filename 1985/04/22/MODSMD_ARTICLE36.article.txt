### PETER HAVEN Staff writer 
Stanford sophomore Joseph An
derson was arrested Wednesday night
on charges of driving under the influ
ence of alcohol and failing to report
damaged property to its owners, the
Stanford Police Department said
Friday.
Anderson is accused of backing his
silver BMW into two parked bicycles
in front of Florence Moore Hall and
leaving the scene without notifying
the bicycle owners, according to
Police Chief Marvin Herrington.
Herrington said a witness, who he
would not identify, "apparently ob
served someone backing over some
bicycles in front of Florence Moore.
Apparently, the driver left the scene.
The [witness] saw this and followed
[the driver] and saw where he
stopped."
The driver stopped in back of the
Delta Upsilon fraternity house, and

the witness contacted Stanford police
around 10:50 p.m., Herrington said.
Herrington — reading from the ar
rest report — said he did not know il
the individual called the police de
partment or simply stopped a patrol
car. but he said four officers were
"involved" in the incident.
"An officer went over and saw An
derson with a couple of other pas
sengers who got up and took off,"
Herrington said. "They (the officers)
could smell liquor on him."
Anderson was then taken to
the police station for a blood-alcohol
test, where he was found "over the
limit for drunk driving," Herrington
said.
"Point-one percent is presumptive
evidence of driving under the influ
ence, and he was over," Herrington
said. Anderson was then arrested
and booked into the North County
Jail, he added.

It was after midnight when Ander
son finally arrived at the jail, Her
rington said. Herrington did not
know if Anderson had been released
from jail, but he said he assumed An
derson "was out by now and is await
ing trial."
Anderson could not be reached for
comment.
Herrington would not reveal the
name of the witness who reported the
incident.
"As far as we're concerned, the
witness is a key to this because he saw
it happen. I don't want to release his
name, because 1 don't want any at
tempts to harass him," Herrington
said.
According to Herrington, the case
has now been referred to the Santa
Clara County District Attorney's Of
fice. Apparently, however, no further
action has been taken.
"1 don't think anything has been
filed," Lorraine O'Keefe of the DA's
office said Friday.
