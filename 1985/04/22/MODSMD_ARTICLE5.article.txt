# Hope is lost
## Nearby benefit blocks show 
### INDRA SEHDEV Staff writer 
There's no hope in sight for the
ASSU Speakers Bureau this spring,
as entertainer Bob Hope has canceled
an appearance here because of
scheduling conflicts.
Hope had planned to perform a
comedy and song show in Frost Am
phitheatre May 9, said Caroline
Rhoden, core committee member of
the ASSU Speakers Bureau. Accord
ing to Rhoden, Hope's appearance
here had been "in the making since
fall."
Hope is not coming to Stanford be
cause of a clause in a contract his
agent signed with Sequoia Hospital in
Redwood City, Rhoden said.
Hope agreed to do a benefit show
at The Circle Star Theatre for Se
quoia Hospital "months" before he
agreed to perform at Stanford,
Rhoden said.
"The contract . . . signed between
Hope Enterprises and them (Sequoia
Hospital) included a clause which
said that he (Hope) could not appear
in another show within 60 days or
100 miles" of the Sequoia Hospital
benefit, Rhoden explained.
"We (at the ASSU) went through
Mr. Hope personally, not through his

agent. Mr. Hope didn't realize that
the theater was anywhere near our
area. His agent would have caught
this months ago."
"Mr. Hope's publicist called on
Tuesday, the day we were going to
put our ticket order in and the day we
received our advertising package
from Hope Enterprises," to inform
the Speakers Bureau of the over
looked clause in the contract, Rhoden
said.
"We immediately tried bargaining
with the hospital. Mr. Hope's men got
a hold of them to see if they would
negotiate," Rhoden said. "The ASSU
even agreed to limit its advertising,
but they wouldn't cooperate."
Sequoia Hospital is selling its tick
ets for $20 and $100, according to
Rhoden. "They think since ours are
selling for $7 and $15, everyone will
come to our show. They have sold
half of their tickets already. They
have mostly $100 seats remaining,
though."
"Sequoia is advertising based on
exclusivity. They were unhappy that
Mr. Hope signed with us," Rhoden
added.
"If we did the show this Tuesday,
we'd be OK, but there's no advertis
ing. We were going to advertise the
third week before the show," Rhoden
said.
"Mr. Hope wanted to come here.
He was excited to do a show. He was
genuinely sorry about not coming,"
Rhoden said. "He's in a tough posi
tion, though. He can't offend [the
people at Sequoia Hospital], but he
knew to what extent we'd worked on
this."
Rhoden said the Speakers Bureau
has thought about asking someone
else to take Hope's place. "It's too
late, though. There are only two-and
one-half weeks before the show date.
We would have to arrange new ad
vertising and a new contract."
Rhoden said the show's cancella
tion is disappointing because of the
preparation wasted. "The (ASSU)
Senate had approved a bill giving us
the $40,000 we needed for our
budget. Events and Services had got

ten the place, lighting and sound
equipment for the show. We'd gotten
police security, ticket takers and
people to clean up after the show.
We'd reserved Mr. Hope's hotel
room. We were working on getting
rain insurance. We'd arranged every
thing, right down to getting the
people to deliver portable toilets to
Frost.
"Everything was poised to go ex
cept advertising and tickets, which
would have been done by Friday."
