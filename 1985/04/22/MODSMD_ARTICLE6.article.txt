# Drell backs more limited defense research
## 
### DAVIDS. GOLDSTEIN Staff writer 
The United States should stick to conven
tional nuclear defense weaponry while it takes a
limited look at futuristic, non-nuclear weapons,
a Stanford arms control expert was expected to
tell a Senate subcommittee this morning.
In testimony prepared for the Defense Sub
committee of the Senate Appropriations Com
mittee, Sidney Drell, deputy director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, proposes
research that falls within the limits current
treaties with the Soviet Union.
"At the present primitive state of many of the
new technologies, it is far too early for us to un
dertake large technology demonstrations which
would be politically mischievous with regard to
Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty compli
ance, as well as-technologically unwarranted,"
he said in the prepared testimony.
"We do not know, even conceptually, how to
build a strategic defense of our society that can
render nuclear weapons impotent and obsolete,

as called for by the president," Drell said.
Drell, also a co-director of the Stanford Cen
ter for International Security and Arms Con
trol, said Congress should appropriate about $2
billion for strategic defense research "by means
that are fully consistent with the ABM Treaty."
Drell told The Daily last night that the United
States needs to "continue research as a hedge,"
but should not spend too much money research
ing exotic systems that scientists know little
about. Rather, the United States should keep
"doing what we know how to do," which in
cludes producing ground-based lasers and
nuclear-tipped missiles.
Conventional ballistic missile defense (BMD)
"must occupy a central role in any strategic
defense planning" because it is "based on tested
integration of proven system components,"
Drell testified. Development of such compo
nents, which include interceptors, radars, com
puters and communications equipment, is per
mitted within limits under the terms of the
ABM Treaty.

Because most futuristic defense proposals
seem impractical or distant in development,
Drell recommends keeping research in these
areas "totally within reasonable limits," he told
The Daily. He was expected to advise the sub
committee that "exotic concepts" such as parti
cle beam weapons and free electron lasers
should be awarded about 5 to 10 percent of the
total funds devoted to directed energy research.
Drell said developing more accurate and
reliable attack warning systems is necessary. "A
constant improvement of our sensor quality and
survivability is vital and should be a matter of
extremely high priority," he said.
He also recommended that the United States
do what it can "to protect our satellites from
direct attack and harden them against long
range nuclear weapons effects."
Drell said that because strategic defense sys
tems ideally would destroy incoming missiles in
their "boost phase" — before they enter the at-

mosphere — "a modest development
program" is warranted to evaluate
"fast-burn boosters" and rapid
deployment of decoys from missiles
following the boost phase.
Space-based chemical infrared
lasers, which have been proposed to
kill missiles in early boost phase,
would be too expensive and too vul
nerable, Drell said. "These factors
make such laser battle systems in
space completely impractical," and
research should focus on ground
based ultraviolet lasers, he said.
Drell also recommends "a robust
research program within ABM
Treaty limits" to look into nuclear
driven X-ray lasers, because they
"could be the basis of a potentially ef
fective defensive layer."
"Since the Soviet Union is, vir

tually certainly, also conducting re
search and development in this area,
the United States has a strong in
centive to understand what perfor
mance levels are actually ac
hievable," he said.
The systems needed to acquire,
analyze and respond to large amounts
of data from sensors also warrant
funding, Drell said.
"A moderately sized program to
define requirements and to develop
both hardware and software for the
challenging control problem clearly is
required," he said.
Drell also proposed establishing a
panel of technology, military, defense
and arms control experts to advise the
administration on priorities for de
fensive weapons. It should review
defense research and development to
ensure that it remains within both
military and arms control goals and
policies, he said.
