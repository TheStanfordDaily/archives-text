### MARY YUH Editorial staff 
Betty Ann Johnson, the woman ar
rested last week on suspicion of aban
doning her baby near Stanford
Hospital, has been accidentally
released from jail, according to Stan
ford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
"Apparently someone inadver
tently released this Miss Johnson. We
don't know where she is," Niemeyer
said.
"They (the police) didn't file any
charges on her, so by law they had to
let her go," said an Elmwood
Women's Jail clerk who identified
herself only as Elaine. Charges must
be filed within 48 hours after arrest.
Johnson was arrested Tuesday
shortly after her newborn baby girl
was found in a Stanford Hospital
parking lot. According to police
reports, the baby was born that morn-,
ing in the brush behind the
mausoleum. After receiving stitches
at Stanford Hospital for tearing that
occurred during childbirth. Johnson
was transferred to Santa Clara Valley
Medical Center (VMC) that same af
ternoon.
The charge of felony child aban
donment was filed the following day.
according to Niemeyer.
"We filed 271 (felony child aban
donment) with a court clerk on the
17th (Wednesday)." Niemeyer said.
"My detective then called (Elmwood)
and notified a sergeant there who told
us she (Johnson) was at VMC but
that when she got to Elmwood, they
would keep her in custody there."
"They mav have filed charges with

the county, but nobody notified us.
She (Johnson) came in Thursday
from VMC and she was released later
that day," said a deputy at Elmwood
who refused to identify herself.
"We did notify them and they did
assure us she would be held. . . . It's
one of those things where something
through the cracks," Niemeyer
said.
A warrant for Johnson's arrest will
go out today across the nation, ac
cording to Niemeyer. "Quite frankly,
the chances of getting her back are
pretty slim," he said.
Johnson's baby girl was detained in
protective custody as a court depen
dent, according to a Santa Clara
County official.
At Friday's detention hearing, "the
baby got detained as expected," said
Deputy Probation Officer Edwin
Hill. The hearing was to determine
whether the baby should be released
to the mother or remain in protective
custody.
The baby will be released tempo
rarily to a satellite foster home. Hill
said.
"I don't know when baby girl
Johnson will be released. I have a
hunch she won't be released over the
weekend," said Mike Goodkind.
director of the Medical Center News
Bureau, late Friday afternoon.
The baby is still in good health,
Goodkind said.
A jurisdictional hearing will be
held May 6 to determine whether the
baby will be permanently released to
the mother, placed in a foster home
or given up for adoption. Hill said.
Johnson must sign a release relin
quishing her maternal rights before
the baby can be given up for adop
tion, according to Hill.
The baby probably will be released
to Johnson only under certain condi
tions. "The mother has to prove she is
psychologically fit and has a stable
place to live and indicate willingness
to care for the baby," Hill said.
"Mom's (Johnson's) presence at
this next hearing is necessary," he
said.
"Normally, and this is not a normal
case, we try to reunite the family
whenever possible, as long as there is
no danger or potential danger to the
child," said Lee Casey, supervisor of
the Dependent Intake Unit of the
Juvenile Probation Department.
"What happens to the baby depends
on what happens with the mother."
Neither Hill nor Casey was aware
that Johnson had been released. They
were not available for further com
ment. It is not known what will hap
pen to the baby if the mother is not
found.
