Israelis sink 'guerrilla' boat
TEL AVIV, Israel — The navy sank a boat carrying guerrillas on their
way to attack Israel, and 20 of the passengers are presumed to have
drowned, the military command announced today.
The navy captured eight of the 28 guerrillas on the boat after exchang
ing fire with them Saturday night off the Israeli coast, the military com
munique said. It added that the dead body of one guerrilla was pulled
from the water and the other 19 were presumed drowned.
It gave no further details about the location of the boat sinking and a
spokesman said he did not know why the announcement was held up for
more than a day.
The communique said that from questioning of the captured guerril
las, "it appeared the boat was carrying terrorists for attacks on several
central targets" during this week's Independence Day celebrations. The
Israelis use the term "terrorists" to designate Palestinian guerrillas.
A naval patrol "identified a suspicious boat and demanded that it
stop. When it refused, warning shots were fired," said the commlinique.
The guerrillas fired back with light weapons and rocket-propelled
grenades and tried to get away, according to the announcement.
The Israeli patrol returned fire, sinking the boat, the military said.
The navy patrol took into custody eight of the guerrillas and found
three rubber dinghies and another small fiber-glass landing craft on the
boat, said the communique.
Last year the Israeli navy said it intercepted two boats carrying guer
rillas planning to attack Israel.
Cabinet approves Israeli withdrawal
JERUSALEM — The Cabinet voted yesterday for withdrawal of all
Israeli troops from Lebanon by June 1, and approved the creation of a
security belt in south Lebanon to be patrolled by Israeli-backed
Lebanese militiamen.
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin announced the decision after a
stormy seven-hour Cabinet meeting.
He said Israel will "reserve freedom of action" to send patrols across
the border and to set up observation posts to prevent the return of the
Palestinian guerrillas who were routed by Israel's June 6,1982 invasion.
Shiite Moslem guerrillas, who have been blamed for most of the
recent attacks on Israel's occupation army, have vowed to resist efforts
to establish the buffer zone.
The withdrawal is designed to end the most divisive war in the Jewish
state's 37-year history, one that has killed 647 Israelis and thousands of
Lebanese.
Israel Radio said the Cabinet vote on withdrawal was 17-3, with one
minister abstaining.
Government spokesmen quoted Police Minister Haim Bar-Lev as
saying all three dissenting votes were cast by former defense ministers
Ariel Sharon, who planned and led the 1982 invasion; his successor,
Moshe Arens, and Ezer Weizman, defense chief during Israel's first in
vasion of Lebanon in 1978.
Israel Television identified the abstainer as Yosef Shapira, a minister
without portfolio representing the religious-nationalist Morasha
(Tradition) Party.
Four members of the 25-member Cabinet were absent.
Israel Radio earlier said Prime Minister Shimon Peres wanted to com
plete the three-phase withdrawal before June 6, the third anniversary of
the Israeli invasion. Israel claimed it invaded its northern neighbor to
uproot Palestinian bases it said were being used for guerrilla attacks on
Israel.
In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Kathleen Lang said
the United States would have no immediate comment on the Cabinet's
decision.
Israeli troops in south Lebanon began dismantling military installa
tions in the pprt city of Tyre, 50 miles south of Beirut, yesterday.
Lebanese reporters said the Israelis burned documents and blew up
equipment, and a 70-truck Israeli convoy arrived to pick up troops and
gear.
The Israeli Cabinet dec>H#*d Jan. 14 to withdraw in stages from its lines
at the Awali River just north of the port city of Sidon, about 35 miles
north of the border.
The pullout, originally scheduled for completion by fall, was speeded
up after Shiites stepped up attacks on the Israeli invaders.
Israel responded with an "iron fist" policy in which villages were
sealed off and searched, and suspected guerrillas rounded up. The Is
raelis have raided 46 villages since Feb. 16 and at least 88 people have
been killed.
NATO affiliate's offices bombed
BRUSSELS, Belgium — A bomb with the force of about 220 pounds
of TNT exploded Saturday at the headquarters of a NATO affiliate,
slightly injuring three people, police said.
A previously unknown leftist group, the Revolutionary Front for
Proletarian Action, claimed responsibility.
The bomb was placed on a window sill at the offices of the North At
lantic Assembly and detonated around daybreak. It ripped away part of
a wall at the back of the 19th-century building, and touched off a fire in
the archives room. The fire was quickly controlled, police said.
The blast also extensively damaged a nearby historical mansion, shat
tered windows and demolished a car. Three people living nearby were
cut by glass but needed no medical attention.
The initials of the Revolutionary Front for Proletarian Action were
sprayed in red paint near where the bomb exploded. Two hours after the
explosion, a man claiming he represented that organization called Bel
gium's French-speaking RTBF news network. A network official quoted
him as saying: "The 20th of April Unit has struck at the NATO Assem
bly this night."
Spokesman Richard Grant said: "The North Atlantic Assembly is an
organization that brings together elected members of parliament of all
16 NATO nations. It is absurd to attack us."
The 30-year-old assembly is completely independent of the North At
lantic Treaty Organization, but it provides a link between the alliance
and the parliaments of the allies.
