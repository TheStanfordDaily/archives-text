# Reagan aides work out strategy
## Rebel-aid compromise crumbling 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan's top
foreign policy advisers gathered at the White
House yesterday to map strategy on Nicaragua as
efforts to reach a congressional compromise on aid
for anti-Sandinista rebels appeared to collapse.
Sens. John Kerry (D-Mass.) and Thomas Harkin
(D-Iowa) meanwhile, announced that Nicaraguan
leader Daniel Ortega had told them his country
would agree to an immediate cease-fire if the
United States ended all support for anti-Sandinista
rebels.
Both the House and the Senate are scheduled to
vote tomorrow on Reagan's request for $14 million
in aid for the Contras.
The president earlier had agreed to a compro
mise in which the money, requested for the fiscal
year ending Sept. 30, would be used for food,
medicine and logistical support instead of arms.
But congressional sources, speaking on condition
that they not be identified, said efforts to win sup
port for the compromise in the Republican
controlled Senate had collapsed. As a result, the
Senate will vote on Reagan's original plan to pro
vide direct military assistance.
Senate Democrats, who met yesterday with Sen

ate Minority Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), are
expected to develop their own plan similar to a plan
devised by House Democrats and some Republican
moderates, the sources said.
The House plan would provide $10 million for
"humanitarian" aid to Nicaraguan refugees. An
other $4 million would go to the Contadora nations
— Mexico, Panama, Venezuela and Colombia — to
carry out the terms of their proposed peace plan for
Central America.
In his radio address from Camp David, Md., Sat
urday, the president said the Democratic alterna
tive would be a "shameful surrender" that would
provide aid to the guerrillas "only ... if they aban
don their struggle to liberate Nicaragua."
Reagan returned to the White House by helicop
ter yesterday from his weekend retreat, where his
top advisers met to discuss Central America. But a
meeting that had been scheduled with Republican
and Democratic senators to discuss the Nicaragua
legislation was postponed.
"The timing did not work out and the meeting
will be held as soon as we can get it together," said
Bob Sims, deputy White House press secretary for
foreign affairs.

But congressional sources said the meeting was
postponed by the White House because the Demo
cratic delegation would have included liberal oppo
nents of any aid to the Contras. These sources said
Retigan had planned to use the meeting to per
suade some moderate Democrats to support the
compromise.
Secretary of State George Shultz, Defense Secre
tary Caspar Weinberger, CIA Director William
Casey and Reagan's national security adviser
Robert McFarlane met yesterday afternoon to dis
cuss Central America.
Sims said Reagan would also be briefed on the
latest developments.
Reagan shook his head noncommittally when
reporters covering his arrival on the White House
South Lawn shouted questions about the Ortega
proposal.
Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.)
interviewed on NBC's "Meet the Press," said the
Ortega offer needs to be analyzed carefully. "It
may be just warmed-over PR (public relations)
from Ortega. Maybe it contains something new.
Certainly we'll look at it. But until we see it, it's
pretty hard to comment on it," Dole said.
