# Former Argentine rulers on trial

### 
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina â€” Nine of Argen
tina's former military rulers went on trial yesterday
charged with kidnapping, torturing and killing
thousands of people during the "dirty war" against
leftists in the 19705.
Police blocked off streets around the Federal
Criminal Court of Appeals and officers with auto
matic weapons patrolled the area. A police com
munique said the security measures would be main
tained around the clock until the end of the trial,
whichjs expected to take at least three months.
Human rights groups and leftist political parties
said they expected 50,000 people to attend a march
and rally they planned outside the Congress build
ing a few blocks from the court in downtown

Buenos Aires.
Court officials have said the nine defendants will
be required to appear in court only when the ver
dicts are delivered.
The "dirty war" of the late 1970s cost the lives of
at least 9,000 people, most of them suspected lef
tists without any real links to terrorism, according
to a government commission that Alfonsin created.
Italo Luder, a former provisional president, took
the stand as the trial got under way. Court Presi
dent Carlos Arslanian questioned Luder about a
decree he issued, while filling in for ill President
Isabel Peron in October 1975, which called on the
armed forces to "annihilate" leftist subversion.

Luder said the decree in no way meant physical
elimination nor did it mean the laws of the constitu
tion could be circumvented.
Luder's testimony was requested by the defense,
which contends that the decree sanctioned harsh
tactics used to stamp out leftist terrorism in the late
19705.
Five of the nine former rulers are charged with
kidnapping, torture, homicide, robbery, illegal
search and falsifying documents.
Court officials say any of the nine found guilty
could be sentenced to 25 years in prison, the maxi
mum penalty under Argentina's civilian criminal
code.
