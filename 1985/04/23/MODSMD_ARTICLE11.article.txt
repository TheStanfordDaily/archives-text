Survivalists end siege
THREE BROTHERS, Ark. — The leader of a
survivalist group and four members of a neo-Nazi
sect surrendered without a struggle yesterday,
ending a three-day standoff with heavily armed
and camouflaged authorities who had sur
rounded a camp in the Ozarks.
James Ellison, leader of the Covenant, the
Sword and the Arm of the Lord, was taken to the
Baxter County Jail, along with four members of
The Order, a white supremacist group, Tom Hill,
a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms, said in Washington.
State and federal lawmen converged on the
camp Friday afternoon with a warrant for Ellison
and began negotiating for his surrender. The
warrant charged Ellison with directing the con
version of guns to automatic weapons at the
white supremacist group's 224-acre encamp
ment.
At a news conference after the 10:30 a.m. ar
rests, FBI agent Ray McElhaney said the opera
tion was a success because lawmen were able to
avoid violent confrontation. Authorities had
moved cautiously in their search out of fear the
group might have planted landmines, but McEl
haney said they found no booby traps.
CBS rejects Turner bid
NEW YORK — CBS Inc.'s board of directors
unanimously rejected Ted Turner's hostile
multibillion-dollar attempt for the company yes
terday, calling it grossly inadequate.
CBS said it had sent a four-page letter to
stockholders urging them to ignore Turner's bid
for their shares. The network t>aid its financial ad
viser, Morgan Stanley & Co.. decided the pro
posal was "financially imprudent."
The network also said that in light of a number
of "pejorative statements" by Turner about
various minority, religious and ethnic groups, his
proposal would undermine the network's broad
acceptance by the American public. It did not
specify what those pejorative statements were.
A call to Turner's spokesman in Atlanta was
not returned.
Also yesterday, CBS filed a counterclaim to a
Turner lawsuit in federal court in Manhattan,
charging Turner with violating state and federal
securities laws.

Rape recanter accepted
JAFFREY, N.H.— Outside of the 80 people
who belong to the Pilgrim Baptist Church, few of
this town's 4,500 people know the young woman
who has recanted testimony that sent a man to
prison for rape.
But in a town in which most people know each
other or know of each other, lack of familiarity is
no bar to gossip.
Residents have discussed Cathleen Crowell
Webb's story since she confessed to lying about
being raped by Gary Dotson in Chicago in 1977.
A judge didn't believe the new claim by Webb,
and has ordered Dotson to continue serving his
prison term.
But much of the talk about Webb is protective
toward a stranger who has lived in Jaffrey less
than two years.
The Rev. Emily Preston, pastor of the United
Church of Jaffrey and chairwoman of the New
Hampshire Civil Liberties Union, said people are
sympathic. "People here are willing to accept
point blank her apology," she said.
"My own sense is, if she went to a grocery store
she'd have people sympathizing with her —
silently," she said. "I don't mean they'd come up
and hug her. That's not a New Englander's way. I
don't think people would turn their backs on
her."
Police accused of torture
NEW YORK — Two police officers were ar
rested last night and charged with inflicting
"medieval torture" on an 18-year-old narcotics
suspect by using an electric stun gun, a prosecu
tor said.
Sgt. Richard Pike and Officer Jeffrey Gilbert
were charged with assault in the second degree, a
felony, Oueens District Attorney John Santucci
said.
Santucci told a news conference that the
suspect, Mark Davidson, was burned Wednesday
night with a device shaped like a hand-held tape
recorder that had two electronic prongs.
The officers were arrested for "infliction of
what you might consider a medieval torture on an
18-year-old individual in custody," the prosecu
tor said.
Davidson said Sunday, "1 was in pain. I was
pleading with them to please stop. The pain was
so bad. They said they would do it all night."

Soviet air threats?
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administra
tion said yesterday that a Soviet air controller in
Berlin threatened a year ago to intercept a cor
porate aircraft unless the United States provided
Soviet authorities with more information about
the plane.
State Department spokesman Edward
Djerejian said the United States protested the
threat to Soviet authorities and"the Soviet con
troller's remark was officially retracted by Soviet
officials."
He said there has been no recurrence of such
remarks or incidents since the April 1984
episode, and that other corporate jets have gone
into the Berlin air corridor without difficulty.
Djerejian said the incident occurred over Ber
lin when a Soviet air controller suggested the
aircraft could be intercepted by Soviet fighters
unless U.S. officials identified the corporation
which owned the plane.
Interception could mean that the plane would
be forced down or shot down.
The corporate name was provided to the
Soviets, although Djerjian did not disclose the
name Monday. After that, "the aircraft proceeded
through the corridor safely and without harass
ment," he said.
The incident was reported Monday by colum
nists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak, but
Djerejian said it had been made known to
reporters a year ago.
While Djerejian didn't take issue with the
columnists' assertion that the Soviet controller
threatened to shoot the plane down, he used the
word "intercept" when he described the incident
and did not define it further.
Djerejian said the matter arose during a dis
cussion between U.S. and Soviet air controllers
over the technical details of procedures for giving
notice of allied flights.
Stocks face decline
Stocks mostly fell in a lackluster session yester
day, although key market measures escaped with
only slight losses.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
finished unchanged at 1,266.56 after edging up
less than a point last week.
