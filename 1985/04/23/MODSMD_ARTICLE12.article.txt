1,000 animals said stolen
LOS ANGELES — At least 1.000 animals
were taken in a raid on medical research labora
tories at UC-Riverside, said an animal-rights
group spokesman who disputed yesterday claims
that 260 were removed.
However, a statement read by another Animal
Liberation Front sympathizer attending the news
conference with Javier Burgos referred to the
"several dozen" animals that were taken in Sat
urday's raid.
Burgos also released ALF photographs of the
animals, including one showing a monkey with
tape wrapped tightly around its head covering
eyelids that were sewn shut as part of research
into blindness.
"We are angry that these people are getting
away with murder, literal murder," Burgos said
of researchers who use animals in experiments.
"It can't help. It's not science."
Burgos said research on animals cannot be
conducted humanely, as researchers contend,
and denied that animal experiments arc scien
tific.
"It's quackery, greed," said Burgos. He is a
teacher and the founder of another animal rights'
group. SUPRESS — Students United Protesting
Research on Sentient Subjects — but said he was
speaking on behalf of the ALF.
"If your cat were sick, would you experiment
on a healthy human being?" said Burgos, who
contended that animal experiments have not led
to any advancements in medicine.
