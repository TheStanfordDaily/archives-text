## In search of Eden and Fred's neighbors 
### 
Dear Bug Me,
I heard that Christie Brinkley and
Billy Joel (or is it Christie and Billy
Brinkley or Billy and Christie Joel)
just bought an apartment in Fred Har
gadon's building in New York. Is this
true? What impact has this had on any
of their lives? Do they party together?
Will Billy and Christie be in Gaieties?
- Samette Soton
I can understand how one might
not be too deathly embarrassed ask
ing me this slightly improbable ques
tion, but can you picture calling long
distance to New York and interrupt
ing The Great Oz of Admissions at
his dinner hour?
Let's set that very scene. The
phone rings in that endearing nasal
tone that phones from the East Coast
have.
I'm expecting some appropriate
and not very humorous recorded
message to ask for my name and
number and the adjective that best
describes my message, when I hear
this gravelly voice with asparagus be
tween its teeth saying hello — not
something you'd leave on an answer
ing machine. In other words, Dean
Fred live in concert.
"Hello," it said. Figuring that was a
precious quote when uttered by Dean
Fred, I busily scribbled it down in my
note pad, leaving awkward silence
scampering around a very expensive
phone line for several seconds, yodel
ing static into the ears of the man who
influenced four years of my life.
I think what followed was the most
confused explanation of myself I've
ever given anyone. I felt like collaps
ing and just pleading, "You remem
ber me, don't you? I used the word
'icarian' as my adjective. How many
of those did you get? I'm a member of
the last class you admitted. Really,
I'm not a crackpot."
i As it was, I think he got the idea
that I wanted something for The
Daily, and he had just promised to
call me back the next day, when I
made the mistake of telling him it was
about Billy Joel and Christie
Brinkley, at which point he mused,
sort of unbelievingly and gruffly,
"What is all this?"
From the way he said it, I've in
ferred that if these two celebrities are
his neighbors, Dean Fred doesn't
know much about it, and therefore
doesn't party with them. Oh, and he

didn't call back.
The only possible impact I can see
all this having on Hargadon is the
usual irritation associated with ob
noxious phone calls, the type that
clears up with time and a little
psoriasis cream, and maybe some
minor budgetary losses in wasted
recording machine tape from the
repeated attempts I've since made at
getting in touch with him again, to
apologize for my adjective, if nothing
else.
I don't think that being mentioned
in Bug Me is going to sell many

records, so the impact of all this on
the happy couple is probably mini
mal.
If you're wondering about Billy
and Christie's last names now, all 1
can say is that according to my
roommate, who has Billy Joel
pictures all over our room and who
nearly mugged me when she thought
I might call him, they are keeping
their own names.
When did "All Right Now" become
Stanford's theme song? Why can't
The Band play more up-to-date
music? - curious in Cedro
Dr. George Lawry, now a physician
at the Menlo Medical Center, but
once a drum major for The Band, said
that this song was arranged at his in
sistence in the fall of 1970, in spite of
serious doubts about its worth from
Arthur Barnes, director of bands, and
other key people in the band at that
time.
"It didn't become the instant
touchdown song until 1972, but it was
very popular when it hit, too," Lawry
said, explaining that it was the only
hit song ever made by a group called
Free, which later became Bad Com
pany.
Hal Michelson, the announcer for
The Band's halftime shows, remem

bers that before "All Right Now,
the song "Yellow River" was the
crowd-mobilizing force at games, and
that even now, some of the younger
"old farts," or band alums, will yell
for it from the stands.
"I'd argue with the assertion that
it's Stanford's theme song," he said.
He thinks that "All Right Now" will
also fall out of playing favor as it
becomes more popular with other
schools' bands. He recalls hearing it
in some of the quarterfinal NCAA
basketball tournament coverage this
year. The USC marching band has in
cluded the song in its repertoire for
some time now, and some obviously
misled Trojan supporters now say it is
their fight song.
Michelson also mentioned that the
oldest chart the band uses now is
"Uptight" with "Satisfaction," which
has been popular for 20 years.
The current drum major, Andy
Switky, explained the process of get
ting new music into play. He works
with Barnes and other arrangers like
himself to pick songs that have
enough musical value to work for all
the parts in the band.
"Most of the new stuff that comes
out is garbage musically," he said.
"Most people like to dance to them,
but they're just too simple for the
band to play."
New songs The Band will play are
"Blinded By Science" and "One At
A Time," an obscure song by The
Who.
Whether a song gets played by The
Band doesn't just depend on its
popularity on the radio, but on the
quality of the arrangement that is
made. Switky referred to "Disco"
Ray Gruenwald, the drum major in
1982, who arranged about 60 songs
into Band charts, and had 15 that are
still frequently played, an unusually
high rate.
Most mediocre arrangements go
into the files for field charts, which
will be played when The Band needs
a particular song title for a field show.
The Band has even been known to rip
up some arrangements after the first
play through, so this quality is crucial.
Soon to come under this scrutiny
are the songs "Rubber Band Man"
and "Safety Dance," which should
freshen up The Band's repertoire and
make it all right now for you.

What is Kingscote Gardens and
who lives there? - Curious in Cedro
How does the Garden of Eden
sound for an answer? Or maybe the
Stanford Hyatt, Tara, Twelve Oaks
and a mansion-sized version of home,
all rolled into a four-story, 32-
apartment idyll less than 100 yards
from Tresidder.
Kingscote Gardens is a private
apartment building built in 1917 with
a 99-year lease from the University,
owned by Howard Trust of New York
and managed by Hare, Brewer and
Kelley in Palo Alto.
Tenants sign monthly agreements
and pay monthly rents of anywhere
from $1,000 down to $400 for apart
ments with kitchenettes. That's right;
no food service.
It's probably harder to get into

than Storey House, Toyon. and the
Suites combined, especially after this
gets printed. (Frankly, my name's
probably already on the waiting list
ahead of you.)
The people who live there usually
have some interest in partaking of the
Stanford community, according to
10-year resident Theresa Marie
Rhyne, who moved into Kingscote
Gardens her junior year and stayed,
working now for the University and
selling and showing art in the area.
There are an increasing number of
undergrads living at Kingscote, but
this is in contrast to Claude Eg
gertsen, a retired University of Mic
higan professor, and his wife, who are
revisiting their honeymoon home of
53 years ago while attending a con
ference of the Comparative and In
ternational Education Society spon

sored by the Stanford School of Edu
cation.
"The garden was just as beautiful
then as it is now," Eggertsen said as
he sat on a side patio, isolated in a sea
of velvet green grass, taking in the
muted sunlight under the mossy trees.
After a long and very civilized chat
in the front room, with its panoramic
window fringed by ancient wisteria,
the residents implored me not to
make Kingscote Gardens sound too
good here.
Well, I've done my best at making
it sound like a dump, considering the
material. A very serious drawback to
keep in mind is the fact that they have
obnoxious caterpillars dropping from
their trees just like everywhere else
on campus.
Even Eden isn't perfect.
