## THE 						STANFORD DAILY Reagan vs. Nicaragua 
### 
An actor is only as good as his script, and in the
ongoing debate about U.S. funding for the Con
tras in Nicaragua, President Reagan's script has
been poor. In fact, a mime may have done a bet
ter job at convincing Congress to vote today in
favor of giving $14 million in military aid to the
rebels — at least Reagan's foolishness wouldn't
have been as evident then.
Last Tuesday, for instance, Reagan told a
group of religious leaders: "I just had a verbal
message delivered to me from the pope urging us
to continue our efforts in Central America." He
repeated a version of the line again Wednesday.
But the critics of Reagan's performances had a
field day when a Vatican spokesman denied that
the pope said any such thing. Although Pope
John Paul II had received two letters concerning
Central America from Reagan in the previous
two weeks, the pope did not respond in any way,
the spokesman said.
Saturday, Reagan documented how Nicaragua
was hastening toward becoming "a communist
terrorist arsenal." "Just this week," he revealed,
"we confirmed the presence of Russian military
personnel in the battle zones of northern
Nicaragua." His script made the situation sound
serious.
But the actor's agents had to tone down the
sound of the performance later in the day. An ad
ministration official said that "probably less than

a dozen Soviet observers had been spotted . . .
near the Honduran border."
In the meantime, a proposal being circulated in
the House of Representatives seems far more
logical and defendable. Rather than getting the
United States more involved militarily, it would
seem better to provide for the human needs of
the Contras. As Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Ver.), a
member of the Senate Intelligence Committee,
describes Reagan's proposal, "The $14 million is
a down payment on eventual American military
involvement in Central America, and I don't
think there is any military reason to justify it."
To avoid totally abandoning the rebels, the
best proposal is one currently being put forward
in the House. This bill would provide $10 million
to the Contras through independent
humanitarian organizations like the International
Red Cross or the United Nations and would
retain $4 million to go to peacekeeping efforts in
the event of successful peace negotiations.
Maybe President Reagan has had so much
trouble making a good case for military aid be
cause a good case doesn't exist. If it exists, let him
state it clearly and accurately — it will stand on
its merits. In the meantime, he should look in the
mirror when he accuses the Sandinistas and his
opponents in this country of running a
"sophisticated disinformation campaign of lies
and distortion."
