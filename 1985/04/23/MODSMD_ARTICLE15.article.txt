Bond is no sexist
As a colleague of Dick Bond's in
the Physics Department, 1 have been
watching the Physics 51 / Playboy
soap opera unfold with original
amusement that has gradually and
unfortunately turned to growing
concern.
1 have hesitated to write out of
fear that such remarks would
precipitate others and would con
tinue the drama into summer reruns.
Dick Bond is no sexist! In fact,
there is no more even-handed, non
discriminating individual in the
Physics Department or anywhere
else in my experience.
I served during the past two years
with Dick on the Physics Depart
ment's graduate admissions commit
tee. This year 12 of the 54 letters of
acceptance went to young women
and, in each case, Dick could be
easily be described as their champion
on the committee. At the last
meeting, the department minority
action sub-committee (consisting of
students within the department)
presented arguments for the addi
tional admittance of four minority
students. Two were added to the
original 54 and, to no one's surprise,
each was enthusiastically supported
by Dick Bond.
Dick will be embarrassed by these
remarks, as will most of my col
leagues. He certainly does not and
did not view himself as the commit
tee's champion of anyone or of any
particular group. His support
emanated as a natural facet of his
character and professionalism and
neither he nor anyone else ever
thought to focus any specific atten
tion on the matter.

'Tis true that Dick lowered a
previously covered blackboard in his
Physics 51 lecture to discover the
pin-up that someone else had tacked
up. Maybe he should have ignored it
or torn it down and perhaps it was an
error in judgment to leave it up for
the later lecture.
But these oversights (if that's what
they were) are indeed trivial and
should not and must not be allowed
to color the reputation of a fine
human being.
Dick's office in Varian 322 is
adjacent to mine; we interact on
nearly a daily basis, and I would
invite anyone who doubts the above
sentiments to visit Dick on the third
floor of Varian to see for him or
herself.
You will find him to be a gifted
scientist whom Stanford University
can be justly proud to call a member
of the community.

Where is The Daily?
An estimated 50,000 people
marched in San Francisco Satur
day, primarily to protest President
Reagan's policies in South Africa
and Central America. A sizable
contingent of Stanford students and
faculty participated in the march.
Yesterday's Daily covered protests
in Washington D.C., Los Angeles
and Seattle â€” but there was no
mention of the San Francisco protest
(by far larger than any of the others)
or of Stanford's participation in it.
What's going on?
