## In defense of context and Israel 
### 
Last quarter's exchange of opinions in The Daily
regarding the Arab-Israeli conflict consistently
lacked both international and historical contexts.
This phenomenon led to the following: 1) Israeli
policy — and hence Israel's existence — became
the sole focus of debate. 2) "Anti-Israel" writers
distorted and misrepresented verifiable facts. 3)
"Anti-Israel" writers condemned Israel according
to a standard of conduct which they applied to no
other nation. 4) "Anti-Israel" writers dismissed the
origins and history of the conflict as irrelevant to
understanding the conflict, and thus as irrelevant to
peacefully resolving it. These four results of non
contextual analysis were abundantly, and most
recently, evidenced in Jim Naureckas' column,
"Any racial or religious group can be an oppres
sor" (The Daily, Feb. 27).

VIEWPOINT

Contrary to Naureckas' assertions, there is no
basis whatsoever for a judgment which equates Is
rael's human rights record with that of the racist
apartheid regime in South Africa — or with the
human rights record of any Arab or Muslim
country. In fact, since the creation of the State of
Israel in 1948, non-Jewish residents have been ac
corded the same citizenship rights as their Jewish
neighbors, including, most notably, the rights to
vote, form political parties and serve as members of
the Knesset (Israeli Parliament). In fact, Jews and
non-Jews are not officially or forcibly segregated.
In fact, Hebrew and Arabic are both official lan
guages of the state, and Arab members of the
Knesset may address that body in Arabic. In fact,
Jews, Arabs (Christian, Sunni Muslim, Bedouin),
Druze and Circassians (non-Arab Muslims) all
have a voice in the only democracy in the Middle
East: Israel.
Yet because of Arab rejection of coexistence
with Jews, Israel has been in a constant state of war
since its inception. Today, the elimination of Israel
remains the official goal of every Arab country —
save Egypt — as well as the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO). This Arab policy of no
recognition, no negotiation and no peace, of
"armed struggle for the liberation of Palestine" and
the "liquidation of the Zionist entity," is rooted in
the racist notion that the Middle East should con
tain only an "Arab presence." Consequently, Jews
have faced discrimination and persecution in Syria,
Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq. Yemen, Algeria,
Tunisia, Libya and Iran (non-Arab Muslim); Copts
are deprived of basic rights in Egypt; Kurds are op

pressed in Iraq, Ba'hais are executed in Iran, and
the list goes on.
In striking contrast, the government of Israel
recognizes the desire of its Arab citizens to main
tain cultural, religious and linguistic ties with the
rest of the Arab world, and thus the fact that Arab
citizens may have mixed loyalties. Accordingly,
non-Jews are not required, but may choose — as
did the Druze community — to serve in the Israel
Defense Forces (IDF).
And what of the Arab population in the occupied
territories? Contrary to Naureckas' assertions, The
New York Times writes, "Israel's administration
(of the West Bank and Gaza) is surely the most
benign occupation in history." The West German
weekly Der Spiegel notes: "The supposed Zionist
hell is (an Arab tourist's) paradise." How could
these publications reach such audacious conclu
sions? Here are the verifiable facts: 1) From 1967-
1978, the per capita growth rate of the West Bank
and Gaza exceeded the per capita GNP of Isael,
Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. 2) Since
1967, at least 46 percent more educational institu
tions and classrooms have been added to a system
providing free education in the West Bank and
Gaza. 3) Complete freedom of movement exists
between Israel and the territories. 4) The Israeli
occupied territories are the only places in the entire
Arab world in which Arabs are free to express their
opinion in an independent press and engage in the
democratic process of election by secret ballot.
In order to fully understand Israel's occupation
of the West Bank and Gaza, one must recall the
events which preceded and precipitated that occu
pation: From 1948 to 1967, the Jordanians occu
pied the West Bank and the Egyptians controlled
Gaza. In those 19 years, material and social condi
tions were far worse than they have ever been un
der Israeli administration. For 19 years, residents
of Gaza were prohibited from working in "Egypt,
and a curfew was imposed from 9 p.m. to dawn.
(Violators were put to death.) The Egyptians
outlawed local newspapers and held no elections.
Jordan's record in the West Bank is worse. The
Jordanians didn't even bother to set up a central
administration for the area. In 19 years, their policy
of military repression of any insubordination led to
the deaths of scores of Palestinian Arabs.
In mid-May of 1967, President Nasser an
nounced that "Egypt, with all her resources, is
prepared to plunge into a total war that will be the
end of Israel." For three weeks, Arab armies
massed on Israel's borders as Nasser's invective in
tensified. On June 5, Israel decided to launch a pre

emptive attack on Egypt, and warned Jordan to
stay out of the war. Jordan refused, and in six days
Israel captured the Sinai, West Bank, Gaza and
Golan Heights.
Remember, in a war fought in defense of its right
to exist, Israel acquired territory which it wisely
decided to relinquish only in exchange for 1)
recognition of its right to exist within secure bor
ders, and 2) a promise of peace. To date, only one
Arab leader — the late President Sadat — has pos
sessed a reciprocal wisdom; as a result, the Sinai
once again belongs to Egypt. One would hope that
other Arab states and the PLO are forthcoming in
their desire for coexistence with Israel. Israeli
Prime Minister Peres has already agreed to direct
talks with a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation,
and has invited Jordan's King Hussein to address
the Knesset in a mutual quest for peace.
That Israel remains willing to negotiate peace is
as remarkable as it is undeniable. Furthermore, it is
critical to remember that during the 19 years of
Arab control over the West Bank and Gaza, there
was never any mention of autonomy for the region
or of the need to create a Palestinian state.
Understanding that PLO rejectionists are the
best allies of Israeli annexationists, it is no wonder
that the annexationists are gaining more influence
in Israeli society. Until and unless the PLO can say
the six magic words, "Israel has a right to exist," it
excludes itself from any negotiations, and continues
to deceive the Palestinian Arabs by making prom
ises it can't keep. The first step toward peace is the
willingness to compromise — a willingness which
Israel has repeatedly and dramatically shown.
Clearly, then, the second step toward peace
remains where it has been since the Arab rejection
of the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan: in the
mouths of Arab leaders.
After the catastrophe which befell the Jewish
people during World War 11, the survivors found
sanctuary in Israel — just as oppressed Jews from
the Soviet Union are able to do today. Recently, Is
raeli Operation Moses rescued many of the black
Jews of Ethiopia from famine and oppression —
just as the 1951-52 Operation Magic Carpet
rescued the Yemenite Jews. Clearly, the history of
the Jewish people demonstrates a continuing need
for the Jewish state. And Israel's noble accomplish
ments in guarding the rights of this people through
out the world further demonstrate its commitment
to human rights.

have a voice in the only democracy in the Middle
East: Israel.
Yet because of Arab rejection of coexistence
with Jews, Israel has been in a constant state of war
since its inception. Today, the elimination of Israel
remains the official goal of every Arab country —
save Egypt — as well as the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO). This Arab policy of no
recognition, no negotiation and no peace, of
"armed struggle for the liberation of Palestine" and
the "liquidation of the Zionist entity," is rooted in
the racist notion that the Middle East should con
tain only an "Arab presence." Consequently, Jews
have faced discrimination and persecution in Syria,
Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq. Yemen, Algeria,
Tunisia, Libya and Iran (non-Arab Muslim); Copts
are deprived of basic rights in Egypt; Kurds are op

pressed in Iraq, Ba'hais are executed in Iran, and
the list goes on.
In striking contrast, the government of Israel
recognizes the desire of its Arab citizens to main
tain cultural, religious and linguistic ties with the
rest of the Arab world, and thus the fact that Arab
citizens may have mixed loyalties. Accordingly,
non-Jews are not required, but may choose — as
did the Druze community — to serve in the Israel
Defense Forces (IDF).
And what of the Arab population in the occupied
territories? Contrary to Naureckas' assertions, The
New York Times writes, "Israel's administration
(of the West Bank and Gaza) is surely the most
benign occupation in history." The West German
weekly Der Spiegel notes: "The supposed Zionist
hell is (an Arab tourist's) paradise." How could
these publications reach such audacious conclu
sions? Here are the verifiable facts: 1) From 1967-
1978, the per capita growth rate of the West Bank
and Gaza exceeded the per capita GNP of Isael,
Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. 2) Since
1967, at least 46 percent more educational institu
tions and classrooms have been added to a system
providing free education in the West Bank and
Gaza. 3) Complete freedom of movement exists
between Israel and the territories. 4) The Israeli
occupied territories are the only places in the entire
Arab world in which Arabs are free to express their
opinion in an independent press and engage in the
democratic process of election by secret ballot.
In order to fully understand Israel's occupation
of the West Bank and Gaza, one must recall the
events which preceded and precipitated that occu
pation: From 1948 to 1967, the Jordanians occu
pied the West Bank and the Egyptians controlled
Gaza. In those 19 years, material and social condi
tions were far worse than they have ever been un
der Israeli administration. For 19 years, residents
of Gaza were prohibited from working in "Egypt,
and a curfew was imposed from 9 p.m. to dawn.
(Violators were put to death.) The Egyptians
outlawed local newspapers and held no elections.
Jordan's record in the West Bank is worse. The
Jordanians didn't even bother to set up a central
administration for the area. In 19 years, their policy
of military repression of any insubordination led to
the deaths of scores of Palestinian Arabs.
In mid-May of 1967, President Nasser an
nounced that "Egypt, with all her resources, is
prepared to plunge into a total war that will be the
end of Israel." For three weeks, Arab armies
massed on Israel's borders as Nasser's invective in
tensified. On June 5, Israel decided to launch a pre

emptive attack on Egypt, and warned Jordan to
stay out of the war. Jordan refused, and in six days
Israel captured the Sinai, West Bank, Gaza and
Golan Heights.
Remember, in a war fought in defense of its right
to exist, Israel acquired territory which it wisely
decided to relinquish only in exchange for 1)
recognition of its right to exist within secure bor
ders, and 2) a promise of peace. To date, only one
Arab leader — the late President Sadat — has pos
sessed a reciprocal wisdom; as a result, the Sinai
once again belongs to Egypt. One would hope that
other Arab states and the PLO are forthcoming in
their desire for coexistence with Israel. Israeli
Prime Minister Peres has already agreed to direct
talks with a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation,
and has invited Jordan's King Hussein to address
the Knesset in a mutual quest for peace.
That Israel remains willing to negotiate peace is
as remarkable as it is undeniable. Furthermore, it is
critical to remember that during the 19 years of
Arab control over the West Bank and Gaza, there
was never any mention of autonomy for the region
or of the need to create a Palestinian state.
Understanding that PLO rejectionists are the
best allies of Israeli annexationists, it is no wonder
that the annexationists are gaining more influence
in Israeli society. Until and unless the PLO can say
the six magic words, "Israel has a right to exist," it
excludes itself from any negotiations, and continues
to deceive the Palestinian Arabs by making prom
ises it can't keep. The first step toward peace is the
willingness to compromise — a willingness which
Israel has repeatedly and dramatically shown.
Clearly, then, the second step toward peace
remains where it has been since the Arab rejection
of the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan: in the
mouths of Arab leaders.
After the catastrophe which befell the Jewish
people during World War 11, the survivors found
sanctuary in Israel — just as oppressed Jews from
the Soviet Union are able to do today. Recently, Is
raeli Operation Moses rescued many of the black
Jews of Ethiopia from famine and oppression —
just as the 1951-52 Operation Magic Carpet
rescued the Yemenite Jews. Clearly, the history of
the Jewish people demonstrates a continuing need
for the Jewish state. And Israel's noble accomplish
ments in guarding the rights of this people through
out the world further demonstrate its commitment
to human rights.

Last quarter's exchange of opinions in The Daily
regarding the Arab-Israeli conflict consistently
lacked both international and historical contexts.
This phenomenon led to the following: 1) Israeli
policy — and hence Israel's existence — became
the sole focus of debate. 2) "Anti-Israel" writers
distorted and misrepresented verifiable facts. 3)
"Anti-Israel" writers condemned Israel according
to a standard of conduct which they applied to no
other nation. 4) "Anti-Israel" writers dismissed the
origins and history of the conflict as irrelevant to
understanding the conflict, and thus as irrelevant to
peacefully resolving it. These four results of non
contextual analysis were abundantly, and most
recently, evidenced in Jim Naureckas' column,
"Any racial or religious group can be an oppres
sor" (The Daily, Feb. 27).

VIEWPOINT

Contrary to Naureckas' assertions, there is no
basis whatsoever for a judgment which equates Is
rael's human rights record with that of the racist
apartheid regime in South Africa — or with the
human rights record of any Arab or Muslim
country. In fact, since the creation of the State of
Israel in 1948, non-Jewish residents have been ac
corded the same citizenship rights as their Jewish
neighbors, including, most notably, the rights to
vote, form political parties and serve as members of
the Knesset (Israeli Parliament). In fact, Jews and
non-Jews are not officially or forcibly segregated.
In fact, Hebrew and Arabic are both official lan
guages of the state, and Arab members of the
Knesset may address that body in Arabic. In fact,
Jews, Arabs (Christian, Sunni Muslim, Bedouin),
Druze and Circassians (non-Arab Muslims) all
have a voice in the only democracy in the Middle
East: Israel.
