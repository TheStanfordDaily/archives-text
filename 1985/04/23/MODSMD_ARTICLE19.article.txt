A "Dean Martin Celebrity Roast" in miniature
(Monologue 1): My younger brother Jon has just
decided that he will matriculate at Stanford this
coming fall. Therefore, it is with great pleasure that
1 dedicate this column to him. You might find this
self-indulgent, hut 1 see it as appeasement. As soon
as he became bigger than me. 1 went off to pre
school. and to be honest, he probably deserves to
lay me out at least once a day for the next year. I
believe that since I'm making him into a celebrity
before he even comes here, he might forgive me for
the times I forced him to pick up the frisbee when it
was two inches from my feet. So remember the
name — Jon Weisman. He's about 5-foot-10,
knows a lot about sports and likes to date a lot.
Jon's decision to apply to Stanford was not
surprising because my older brother Greg and I
both attend this institution. However, his major in
spiration while writing his application was seeing
my freshman application. I will reprint an essay
from my application in order for all to gain a better
understanding of the effect it had on him:
Essay 2. What event in your life has been most
memorable to you? Briefly explain.
At this moment (Oct. 30, the most
memorable event of my life happened last Tuesday.
A senior on the third floor of my dorm came
downstairs to my room to talk with me. This girl is
the type of person who can't bear to touch a dog.
and if you tell her you've \sorn your jeans for two
days without washing them, she has a near heart at
tack and s.iys. "Oh. yuck!" Any way , she was telling
me about her first year at Phillips (Academy, An
dover) when I noticed a top retainer entangled in
her long black hair So 1 said,"You know, you have
a retainer caught in your hair. Is it yours?"
"She reacted as if she (sic) seen someone's limb
hacked off in some cheap horror movie. She made
a gagging noise, screamed and flicked the retainer
owl of her hair as quickly as she could. She then

said, "That was so gross. I mean my hair is a mess,
but that is disgusting!"
"I asked her if she'd pick it up with a Kleenex. I
didn't want it on my floor that much. She did this
reluctantly, and then she threw it in my hallwav."

So I said, 'You know,
you have a retainer
caught in your hair. Is it
yours?'

This essay (and my entire application) was hand
written in ink. When Jon read it last fall, he realized
that if someone could write an essay like that and
still get in and have a column, he had a better
chance than the 17.000 applications seemed to in
dicate.
Sporadic toasts are made
Jon's first response to the news of his acceptance

was, "I'm ecstatic." We're happy for you too, Jon,
so we have some special advice to give you to fur
ther your enjoyment of this great university:
1. Don't become alarmed when you see students
in your fall quarter calculus class wearing ASSU T
shirts, saying things like, "I would have scored
above the median had I studied harder," and hiss
ing when Berkeley professors are mentioned. That
is all just a stage.
2. Don't be fooled when these same people insist
they haven't studied at all for a test. It is a facade.
(Besides, they are the same people who look at
your bluebook to check how well you did.)
3. Search for sex instead of love. It is much easier
to find the latter.
4. When you start watching "All My Children,"
remember that Tad is a slime but is best liked along
with Erica; Hillary loves Tad but has married a
dying man; and that Nina flares her nostrils. If you
happen to forget all this, say that you watch
"Starblazers" and "He-Man" every afternoon.
This will gain you a lot of respect, especially from
people like your sister.
Finally, we all agree that it's "Great!" that you
"got in," but remember (according to Daily colum
nist Jeff Raines) that "Getting into Stanford is not
a golden ticket, good for a free ride in life." You
must work hard and strive to achieve here because
that's what Stanford — and America — is all about.
We're proud of you, Jon. and we wish you all the
best in your Stanford career. (Loads of luck to
you.) The only regret we all have is that Brother
Greg will have already graduated. Speaking of
Greg, he is about 5-foot-7, knows a lot about comic
books, and likes to date a lot. . . .
(Call me a sandwiched ham, but what can I say?
I'm ecstatic about both of my brothers!)

American studies. Her column appears every other
