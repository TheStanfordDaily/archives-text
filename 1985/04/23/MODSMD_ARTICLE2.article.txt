# Panel eyes psychiatry expansion
## 
### LYNN MARCUS Staff writer 
Seeking to expand psychiatric facilities while limiting
costs, members of a Stanford Medical Center task force
have recently opened "serious discussions" with private
health care corporations.
If an arrangement can be worked out between Stanford
and one of four corporations, these discussions could lead
to an unusual venture involving joint construction and op
eration of a psychiatric facility, according to members of
the Task Force on the Future of Psychiatric Facilities at
the medical center.
But members of the task force say they share the con
cerns of doctors and hospital administrators here and
throughout the country that affiliation with for-profit in
stitutions could compromise a teaching hospital's inde
pendence. As a result, they say the task force is proceed
ing slowly and considering a variety of alternatives.
Other options under consideration include accommo
dating the existing psychiatric unit within the main hospi
tal building and moving it to the Children's Hospital after
the New Children's Hospital opens sometime in 1989.
Opening a new facility, however, would enable the De
partment of Psychiatry to offer services that administra
tors and faculty members say are needed by doctors,
medical students and community members. Services such
as a locked facility for dangerous psychotic patients, a
treatment program for alcoholics and drug addicts, a
gcriatric unit and a program for adolescents and children
with psychological problems could be provided and
housed in an KO-bed facility, according to Psychiatry Prof.
Lorrin Koran, a member of the task force.
Current inpatient psychiatric facilities at the medical
center include only a 20-bed unit at the Hoover Pavilion,
and an additional 13 beds there and 14 at Children's
Hospital for psychosomatic patients.
The 1 1 - member task force was set up in March 1984 to
address the problem of where to relocate the 20-bed psy
chiatric unit at Hoover Pavilion, located across from the
Stanford Shopping Center on Quarry Road, almost one
mile from the main hospital building. The problem arose
as a byproduct of the $112 million Hospital Moderniza
tion Project (I1MP) now underway. One goal of the HMP
is to close the pavilion lo inpatient services and relocate its
189 beds, most of which arc for medical surgical patients,
by late 1987 or early 1988.
Elvia Garwood, deputy director of the HMP, said that
most of the medical surgical beds will be transferred to the
centcr now under construction, and the remainder may be
accommodated by a new unit being considered by hospital
planners. But "the 20 psychiatric beds have to go some
where," Garwood said.
The task force began exploratory talks with private cor
porations last summer, and members visited hospitals run
by four corporations. Sheldon King, executive director of
the hospital and task forcc chairman, said the current
stage of discussions with the corporations will end in late
June, when members of the group are expected to narrow
the pool to two candidates.
King said building and operating a facility in conjunc
tion with a corporation could make expansion feasible be
cause of the corporation's easy access to capital and the
