# Panel eyes psychiatry expansion
## 
### LYNN MARCUS Staff writer 
Seeking to expand psychiatric facilities while limiting
costs, members of a Stanford Medical Center task force
have recently opened "serious discussions" with private
health care corporations.
If an arrangement can be worked out between Stanford
and one of four corporations, these discussions could lead
to an unusual venture involving joint construction and op
eration of a psychiatric facility, according to members of
the Task Force on the Future of Psychiatric Facilities at
the medical center.
But members of the task force say they share the con
cerns of doctors and hospital administrators here and
throughout the country that affiliation with for-profit in
stitutions could compromise a teaching hospital's inde
pendence. As a result, they say the task force is proceed
ing slowly and considering a variety of alternatives.
Other options under consideration include accommo
dating the existing psychiatric unit within the main hospi
tal building and moving it to the Children's Hospital after
the New Children's Hospital opens sometime in 1989.
Opening a new facility, however, would enable the De
partment of Psychiatry to offer services that administra
tors and faculty members say are needed by doctors,
medical students and community members. Services such
as a locked facility for dangerous psychotic patients, a
treatment program for alcoholics and drug addicts, a
gcriatric unit and a program for adolescents and children
with psychological problems could be provided and
housed in an KO-bed facility, according to Psychiatry Prof.
Lorrin Koran, a member of the task force.
Current inpatient psychiatric facilities at the medical
center include only a 20-bed unit at the Hoover Pavilion,
and an additional 13 beds there and 14 at Children's
Hospital for psychosomatic patients.
The 1 1 - member task force was set up in March 1984 to
address the problem of where to relocate the 20-bed psy
chiatric unit at Hoover Pavilion, located across from the
Stanford Shopping Center on Quarry Road, almost one
mile from the main hospital building. The problem arose
as a byproduct of the $112 million Hospital Moderniza
tion Project (I1MP) now underway. One goal of the HMP
is to close the pavilion lo inpatient services and relocate its
189 beds, most of which arc for medical surgical patients,
by late 1987 or early 1988.
Elvia Garwood, deputy director of the HMP, said that
most of the medical surgical beds will be transferred to the
centcr now under construction, and the remainder may be
accommodated by a new unit being considered by hospital
planners. But "the 20 psychiatric beds have to go some
where," Garwood said.
The task force began exploratory talks with private cor
porations last summer, and members visited hospitals run
by four corporations. Sheldon King, executive director of
the hospital and task forcc chairman, said the current
stage of discussions with the corporations will end in late
June, when members of the group are expected to narrow
the pool to two candidates.
King said building and operating a facility in conjunc
tion with a corporation could make expansion feasible be
cause of the corporation's easy access to capital and the
proven success of private corpora
tions in completing projects quickly
and managing operations efficiently.
But despite a recent dramatic rise
in the number of hospitals owned and
run by investor-owned chains — in
cluding a substantial number of
private psychiatric hospitals — prece
dents for the type of affiliation the
task force is considering are few, and
the concerns of the medical commu
nity are many.
King expressed skepticism that "a
for-profit institution will be able to
satisfy our commitments to teaching
and research."
Results of a survey published in
January by Douglass Health Care
Consultants showed that nearly 30
percent of the administrators at
various teaching hospitals throughout
the country share this concern, and
that 67 percent fear a loss of
autonomy or flexibility in joint affilia
tions.
"I think that as a University officer,
I would share many of the concerns
about the effect of [a joint venture]
on our academic functions," said
David Hopkins, executive assistant to
the vice president of medical affairs
and a member of the task force.
"You tend to hear (from members
of the corporations) how they would
leave us to do our thing. 1 recognize
that many members of the faculty
here and at the medical school would
view it as an intrusion on the Univer
sity," he said.
Koran said one of the issues to be
dealt with is "governance," adding,

"It is not clear whether the University
would accept not having a majority
on the board of directors" of the new
facility, or whether a corporation
would settle for a minority either.
Koran also said that although the
corporations have indicated a willing
ness to treat Medicare and MediCal
patients, problems relating to admis
sion regulations could also produce a
snag in negotiations. MediCal, for ex
ample, does not pay for patients
treated in free-standing psychiatric
hospitals, and in order to keep treat
ing these patients, the new facility
would have to be a subdivision of the
hospital.
Although expansion under the
HMP is leaving the hospital "land
poor," King said "the priority is to
have a facility that attaches to the
main facility."
Despite these reservations, Hop
kins said he was impressed with the
small psychiatric hospital he visited at
Vanderbilt University in Tennessee,
which has the same affiliation Stan
ford is considering. Officials at the
hospital, run jointly by the University
and the world's largest investor
owned multi-hospital chain, Hospital
Corporation of America (HCA),
"talk a lot about quality and stand
ards, and 1 was impressed that they
genuinely meant it," Hopkins said.
He said the hospital management was
"very business-like," but gave him
the impression that "they thought
they were doing something good and
worthwhile."
The approach of the task force has
been partially influenced by an
uproar at Harvard after similar
negotiations were concluded in late
1983. An agreement by the board of

trustees at Harvard's major teaching
hospital, Massachusetts General
Hospital, to sell the McClean psychi
atric facility to HCA generated such
strong protest from the Harvard fac
ulty that the trustees were forced to
cancel the proposed sale and
renegotiate a lease.
"It (the incident) sensitized us ad
ministrators to the fact that the fac
ulty has these concerns and ought to
he fully informed," said Hopkins.
"And I think we're making every ef
fort to do that."
The negotiations at Harvard in
cluded only officials and hospital
managers, but the task force at Stan
ford also includes David Korn. dean
of the medical school; David Men
delow, associate dean of the medical
school; Thomas Gonda, chairman of
the psychiatry department; and
Koran. Hopkins said the faculty is
also kept informed of the task force's
actions through committee meetings.
Hopkins said that besides expand
ing research opportunities and pro
viding services the community needs,
affiliation with a proprietary firm
could enhance the teaching program.
"Medical students want exposure to
as many different kinds of situations
as they can get," Hopkins said. Train
ing in psychiatry for Stanford medical
students is currently complemented
by work at the Veteran's Administra
tion Medical Center in Palo Alto, but
neither women nor adolescents are
treated there.
Koran said he was optimistic about
the opportunites a new facility could
provide. "I think there is a tendency
(within the Department of Psychia
try) to prefer the new facility if the is
sues can be successfully resolved."
