## Card nine off to Stockton for breather against UOP 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
After beating UCLA twice this weekend
with dramatic ninth-inning home runs, the
No. 1-ranked Stanford baseball team should
have an easier time of it today when it travels
to Stockton for a 3 p.m. game against Pacific.
For the first time this season, the Cardinal
was in serious danger of losing a series. Stan
ford entered the ninth inning of Sunday's
game trailing 8-5. One run and two outs later,
Walt Harris jolted a Bill Wenrick curveball
for a three-run homer, giving the Cardinal a
9-8 win and leading Harris to Pacific 10 Con
ference Player of the Week honors.
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess, who
watched Harris' blast from behind the right
field fence after being ejected earlier in the
inning, felt fortunate to escape with a victory.
"This was a big win for us. We were fighting
for our lives," Marquess said. "Things weren't
going our way — this team has a lot of heart."
Until Harris' heroics, Stanford's hitting star
of the day had been Rick Lundblade. The
senior first baseman, now hitting .383, was 3-

for-4 with three RBIs and his 14th round
tripper of the year. "These are the kind of
wins that really add up at the end of the
season," he said.
The Cardinal got another one of those kind
of wins on Friday. Jeff Ballard and Alex
Sanchez hooked up in a tough pitchers' duel
that left the score at 3-3 after eight innings.
The game appeared headed for extra in
nings, but on a 1-1 pitch from UCLA reliever
Dana Ridenour, Toi Cook won it for Stanford
with a homer to left.
The two wins left the Cardinal's Pacific 10
Southern Division record at 16-5 — two
games ahead of second-place California. The
Bruins fell to 7-14 in the Six-Pac.
Whether Stanford was able to keep its No.
1 national ranking is not known as of yet —
the new ratings come out this afternoon.
The UOP Tigers don't figure to give the
Cardinal much trouble, but neither did U.S.
International, which pulled off a 5-4 upset
over Stanford in February. UOP is 15-25
overall, and 5-13 in the Pacific Coast Athletic
Association.

The Tigers already have a couple of shock
ers to their credit this year. They beat 12th
ranked Cal 8-3 and knocked off No. 22
Fresno State 5-4.
Coach John Picone's main problem this
year has been offense. The Tigers are batting
an anemic .239 as a team. Their leading hitter
is Tim Carroll, who is batting only .291. The
power, what little there is of it, is supplied by
Hobie Schultz and Bill Waggoner — both
with five homers.
However, UOP does have a strong pitching
staff. Stanford will see either Darrell Van Roy
or Mat Snider on the mound. Van Roy is 7-4
and led the PCAA in ERA until last week,
when it jumped to 3.88. Last year, Van Roy's
14 wins were tied for fourth best in the nation.
Snider is the Tigers' giant-killer, beating
both Cal and Fresno State. He has been the
winning pitcher in each of his last three ap
pearances.
After today's game, Stanford begins a six
game conference road trip with a three-game
weekend series at USC.
