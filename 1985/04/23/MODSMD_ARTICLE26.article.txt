# Card tries to rebound against 49er netters
## 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The competition level tails off a bit for the
Stanford men's tennis team this afternoon at
1:30 p.m. here against Long Beach State.
Today's match marks the Cardinal's return to
action following back-to-back losses to Pacific
10 Conference rivals UCLA and USC over the
weekend.
Long Beach, currently ranked 19th in the na
tion, gets its wins by having six relatively equally
talented players to compete with, Stanford
Coach Dick Gould said. The 49ers' best win of
the season thus far has been against No. 5-
ranked Pepperdine.
Peter Smith, the No. 42 player in the country,
and Steve Cluse have played No. 1 singles for
Long Beach this season. Smith also plays No. 1
doubles..with Vince Hor Casitas.
The 49ers will find out today whether they
are fortunate or unfortunate to experience first
hand how the Stanford netters return to the
courts after the 8-1, and 5-4 losses that
deprived Stanford of its No. 1 national ranking.
Several Cardinal players said the move down
from No. 1 will give the team "a fighting spirit"
on its way to the NCAA championship tourna
ment next month.
"We aren't as confident as after the Louisville
tournament. We have something to really play

hard for now," sophomore Derrick Rostagno
said.
Stanford defeated USC 6-3 in an earlier
ITCA tournament at Louisville, Ky. In that
match, the Cardinal won five of six singles
matches to take the tournament title before the
doubles competition started.
Since then, Stanford has been flying high on
the No. 1 ranking — but no more.
"This weekend, every little thing that could
have gone wrong went wrong. It's not that I was
playing badly, but I missed all the important
points — even within the games. A putaway
would be out by inches. It was all missed by a
little, little, teeny mistake," Rostagno said.
Rostagno probably won't remember with
pleasure the two singles and two doubles
matches he lost this weekend, but the sopho
more said the slump, if it is one, won't last.
"A 6-4, 6-2 loss could have just as easily been
a 6-4, 6-2 win this weekend. I could have really
won easily but the luck just didn't seem to be
there,' Rostagno said. "I guess that could apply
to the team."
If the luck ran out for the Stanford men's ten
nis team Friday and Saturday, the team can at
least hope for different circumstances when
Stanford, USC and UCLA get together again in
the national championships. And that, Gould
says, is when it "really counts."
