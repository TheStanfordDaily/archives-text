# Cal baseball beats ASU, Stanford lead stays at two
## 
### 
BERKELEY â€” California scored
nine runs in the bottom of the first in
ning and coasted to a 12-4 victory
over Arizona State in a Pacific 10
Southern Division game yesterday.
The triumph gave Cal a 14-7
record in the Six-Pac and kept the
Bears two games behind league
leading Stanford.
Arizona State fell to 11-10 in the
Six-Pac, five games off the pace and
tied for third with Arizona, but the
Sun Devils are on probation and in
eligible for the league championship.
Cal's big inning was keyed by a

grand-slam by designated hitter Jerry
Goff. Shortstop Dan Truax added a
two-run blast in the outburst.
Dave Masters, normally a reliever
for the Bears, started and went the
distance, striking out eight to improve
his record to 4-3.
Next weekend, Cal will be at
Arizona, while the Sun Devils travel
to UCLA.
Kurt Dempster, 3-4, started and
took the loss for the Sun Devils. After
striking out the leadoff hitter for the
Bears, Dempster walked the next five
batters before leaving the game.
