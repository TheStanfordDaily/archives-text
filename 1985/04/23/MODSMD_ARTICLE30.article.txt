## 'Way Down East' 
### 
Film restoration is a marvelous mystery to me. When I
was an undergraduate, my film freak friends and I used to
fantasize that the celebrated lost footage cut from movies
before or just after their original release — the bulk of
Erich von Stroheim's "Greed," the two missing songs
from the George Cukor " A Star Is Born," the "Jitterbug"
number from " The Wizard of Oz" — would someday turn
up in a vault, dusty but intact, and at last we would be able
to see these films as their makers had intended them to be
seen.
Now these are no longer fantasies. We live in an era
where the distinction between nostalgia buff and historian
has become blurred in the arts, where men and women are
eagerly engaged in preserving the remnants of our cultural
and pop cultural past. Witness the reissue of the Blue
Note Jazz series, the trend toward reconstructing ballets
long believed to have vanished permanently from the
repertory, the wide availability of the most obscure songs
by Cole Porter and George Gershwin. And those of us
who care about movies have been fortunate enough to
reap the benefits of the remarkable work done by preser
vationists at New York's Museum of Modern Art, the
UCLA Him Archives and the L. A. County Museum. Two
summers ago, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences sponsored special preview performances of a
new print of "A Star Is Born" to which Ron Haver at the
L.A. County Museum had returned all but eight of the 27
minutes cut from the release print after its New York
premiere in 1954. And last month, San Francisco
audiences were given the opportunity to see two "new"
silent movies in a single week. A print from Kino Interna
tional of the bulk of Erich von Stroheim's 1928 "Queen
Kelly" (which he never finished) provided the focus of a
week-long Stroheim festival at the Castro Theatre, and
Peter Williamson of the Museum of Modern Art in New
York arrived in Berkeley to host a Pacific Film Archive
screening of the definitive cutting of D.W. Griffith's "Way
Down East," unseen in its entirety since 1920.
If these events seem parochial, unworthy of note
outside the small community of film historians, in fact
they enrich all of us who love movies, augmenting our un
derstanding of our own popular culture, which time and
neglect have chipped away at since the first (and possibly
greatest) epoch of American movies, the silent era. Most
moviegoers believe that silent movies were "flickers" —
fatuous, melodramatic trifles so crudely shot and edited
that the actors' movements reproduced at jerky high
speed. This general misconstruction has been encouraged
not only by parodists like Mel Brooks, in his alleged
"tribute" to the heyday of the silent clowns, "Silent
Movie," but also by film teachers and the programmers of
film series all over the country, who have repeatedly (and
in some places over the outcry of distressed film
aficionados who know better) projected silents at the
wrong speed. The movies of this period were cranked at
18 frames per second, and ours run at 24; you can imagine
how substituting the latter for the former might well
garble the intentions of a great director like Griffith or
Stroheim. (The Communications Department at Stanford
owns a variable-speed projector, yet 1 have never seen a
silent movie in a public showing on campus projected at
18 frames per second.) Some years ago in another city I
took a group of friends to a showing of Griffith's "The
Birth of a Nation," having promised them a chance to see
one of the greatest movies ever produced, and a
reputable, university-affiliated movie house so wrecked it
by projecting it incorrectly that no one could calculate
what had made the film a classic. The recent attention
paid to reclaiming old films, and providing an experience
for audiences that is as close as possible to that enjoyed by
their original audiences — at Berkeley, "Way Down
East" ran for 163 minutes in a mostly tinted print (major
studio releases were often hand tinted, frame by frame)
accompanied by the original organ score (played live) —
restores the stature of filmmakers like Griffith. Unable to
see his movies as he'd meant them to be seen, many stu
dents have accepted his contribution to movies with be
wilderment, assuming erroneously that whatever he'd ac
complished has been comically superseded by the sophis
tication of contemporary film. In fact, no director, in this
country or any other, has ever surpassed D.W. Griffith;
among moviemakers, he is our Melville.
Actually, a better comparison would be to Dickens;
seen in their complete form, his movies spin like 19th
century narratives (especially "Orphans of the Storm,"
which in tone and setting — the French Revolution — was
clearly inspired by "A Tale of Two Cities"), and "Way
Down East" has a meticulous, rhymed, novelistic finish
that no one had seen in six-and-a-half decades, involving
characters whom viewers of the usual revival print would

not recognize. Imagine that the only edition of "David
Copperfield" available to readers had spanned 600 pages,
and someone suddenly reprinted the lull length (over
800-page) version, featuring subplots and characters
eliminated years ago, and you will have an idea of the ex
perience of seeing the abridged "Way Down East" and
then the print restored by the Museum of Modern Art
crew.
In this case, both the blame for the truncation and the
credit for the restoration lie chiefly in Griffith himself.
After the triumphant premiere of "Way Down East" (an
adaptation of a stage play by Lottie Blair Parker and
Joseph R. Grismer he had paid the shockingly — unprece
dentedly — exhorbitant price of $175,000 for the rights to
film; the movie repaid that investment many times over).

Griffith continued to play with it for several years and
eventually edited out about a quarter of it, including most
of the comic scenes, which the original reviewers had not
regarded favorably. When the Museum archivists set
about putting together a definitive print, many versions
were in circulation or in private collections, all of them
variants of Griffith's original; the most complete was a 16
mm. print he had donated to the Museum in the 19305.
Fortunately, he had also provided a shot-by-shot analysis
which, in tandem with the original musical score, fur
nished a model for the reconstruction. The new print con
tains all but five or six minutes of the original, and (as in
the reassembled "A Star Is Born") stills and intertitles
bridge the gaps left by missing scenes.
Griffith was a child of the 19th century; his sensibility,
like that of Dickens, was informed by the popular

melodrama he saw on the stage, and like Dickens he made
it the narrative basis of his work and transcended it. He
was also an expert thief (like Shakespeare), borrowing
ideas or even whole pasages from other storytellers and
then transforming them. "Way Down East" begins as an
updated "Cinderella" and turns into "Tess of the
d'Urbervilles," and if you look sharp you can also spot
scraps from Hawthorne, from Edith Wharton's "Ethan
Frome," and even from "Charley's Aunt." (Griffith's suc
cessors validated this process by working oil him: Images
from "Way Down East" turn up in such unexpected
places as "The Wizard of Oz" — the ornery, tyrannical
Miss Gulch is a variation on the busybody spinster Martha
Perkins — and Disney's "Snow White," where the
heroine's communion with the birds derives from a serene
interlude with Lillian Gish. And, as Pauline Kael has

pointed out, a single shot of the ice thaw on the river
spawned an entire national cinema — that of the Soviets.)
The story of the picture centers on Anna Moore (Lillian
Gish), urged by her widow mother to visit wealthy
relatives in the hopes of buoying up their diminishing fam
ily savings. Annas snobbish cousins treat her shabbily,
but an eccentric aunt whom they dare not cross (lest she
fail to acknowledge them in her will) insists that Anna be
permitted the privileges of a house guest; she dresses the
girl in beautiful new clothes and sends her downstairs to
join an elegant party, where she attracts the attention of
the incorrigible lecher Lennox Sanderson (Lowell Sher
man). (Cinderella goes to the ball and meets Alec
d'Urberville.) He courts her relentlessly and, tricking her
with a fake marriage, seduces her; when she becomes
pregnant, he reveals the truth and abandons her. The

baby dies after a few months, and Anna's landlady, Maria
Poole (Emily Fitzroy), learning of its illegitimacy, throws
her out. She wanders into the countryside, seeking em
ployment, and finds it at the home of Squire Bartlett
(Burr Mcintosh), who represents an austere, unforgiving
Puritanism, and his wife (Kate Bruce), the emblem of a
warm, charitable Christianity. Their son David (Richard
Barthelmess) is engaged to Kate Brewster (Mary Hay),
but they are ill matched and he falls in love with Anna;
her feelings of guilt cause her to reject his proposal of
marriage, however, and when Sanderson shows up once
again — this time to imperil Kate's virtue — he tries to in
timidate Anna into leaving the Bartletts' farm because he
fears for his own reputation. One day Emily Fitzroy
arrives in town and, recognizing Anna, relates her story to
the town's chief gossip. Martha Perkins (Vivia Ogden),
who passes it on to Squire Bartlett. Bartlett, appalled,
turns Anna out into a fierce snowstorm (though not
before she has unmasked her seducer); she tries to drown
herself, but David rescues her at the last moment and
Bartlett begs her forgiveness.
The plot sounds in summary like an amalgam of cliches,
and of course it was already archaic by the time Griffith
got to it. But 1 have heard audiences cheer (without irony)
during the eleventh-hour rescue in "Orphans of the
Storm," and the celebrated climax of "Way Down East,"
with Richard Barthelmess hopping from one ice floe to
the next in a frantic effort to save Lillian Gish from tum
bling into the falls, is still breathtaking. The key to under
standing Griffith's greatness, 1 think, is in seeing how he
suffuses cliches with so much feeling that they take on the
power of myth — the way the square dance does in John
Ford's "My Darling Clementine," for example, or the
whirling ballroom sequence in Orson Welles' "The Mag
nificent Ambersons" — and how he enshrines certain
images so that they seem to exist outside the bounds of
time. In "Birth of a Nation," Griffith turned to earlier
myth-makers, the painters Frederic Remington and Mat
thew Brady, for inspiration; the rural idyll in "Way Down
East" — Lillian Gish on the bank of the river with Rich
ard Barthelmess, her hair flowing down her back, and
later alone, watching the reflection of the late afternoon
sun on the water — recalls Corot. (The spanking new
print enhances the work of Griffith's photographer, Billy
Bitzer, which in deteriorated versions goes largely un
noticed. Here he is working with the assistance of Hendrik
Sartov.) Another shot of Gish on the road, hesitating at
the door of a stranger from whom she must beg food and
lodging, has the same strange balance of pastoral and dark
elements as the Bourgereau painting "The Broken
Pitcher," a metaphoric representation of lost virginity.
The entire film can be said to contain that balance, be
cause Anna is always in danger (until the very end), from
figures who in Griffith's eyes possess the grasping claws of
demons. Lennox Sanderson is not the only villain in the
piece, nor is Squire Bartlett the only pillar of Puritanism
to be toppled. As in other films (notably the modern sec
tion of "Intolerance"), Griffith seethes with anger here at
the interference of tongue-wagging spinsters; his depic
tion of the chill, granite-faced Maria Poole and the cack
ling Martha Perkins — both middle-aged single women —
contrasts with the gentle, sympathetic hand that shapes
the scenes involving the younger characters. For most of
the film Martha is a comic caricature, but. between the
time she receives Maria Poole's news and the time she
releases it, she seems to be acting under the influence of
hellish forces; there is a startling, Stroheim-like shot of
her after she has spoken, rocking back and forth in a chair,
hugging herself with vicious delight.
Certainly Griffith could not have taken the worn
platitudes of this victimized-innocent fable as far as he did
if he had chosen a different actress for the role of Anna
Moore. All the mysteries of the miracle of artistic col
laboration are embodied in the work Griffith and Lillian
Gish did together in the 1910s and early "20s, in films like
this one, "Birth of a Nation." "True Heart Susie,"
"Hearts of the World," "Orphans of the Storm" and
(especially) "Broken Blossoms." No actress has ever
portrayed domestic happiness as beautifully as Gish, be
cause no one has ever made so frighteningly clear how
fragile such contentment is and how close the abyss. In
Griffith's movies ("True Heart Susie" is an exception, and
so, actually, is "Orphans of the Storm," where it is
Dorothy Gish and not Lillian who falls into a nightmare),
Gish plays frail heroines damaged by adversity who are in
danger of being overtaken by neurotic impulses —
Ophelias hovering on the edge of the river hank. The waif
spinning round and round in the locked closet in "Broken

Blossoms," the grief-mad lover wandering the battlefields
in search of her soldier in "Hearts of the World," the
ravaged virgin drawn by the current in "Way Down East"
— these are the desperate feminine extremes to which
Gish exposes us. She did indeed play Ophelia in the '30s,
to Gielgud's Hamlet, and all that remains of that produc
tion are a handful of stills and the haunting studio portrait
by Edward Steichen; but in "Way Down East" we have a
good idea of what she must have been like. It was her own
idea to lie on the ice floe with her hair and one tiny hand
drifting in the water, and she caught a chill in that hand
that has never left her. (Her performance attained some
sort of bizarre height in physical bravery; As is well
known, she nearly went over the falls for real during the
shooting of this scene.)

Her portrayal of Anna is full of emotional changes, reg
istered with such astonishing naturalism in her delicate
face that we never catch her in a false movement. There are
the scene in which Sanderson makes a pass at her and then
soothes her offended sensibilities by proposing marriage;
the "wedding night," when her trusting devotion to her
spurious husband stirs her deeply hidden sensuality, and
she abandons herself to her childish dreams of marital
love; the scene in which Sanderson tells her the truth, and
she pulls her wedding ring on and off her finger as pathetic
proof that he must be joking. Most extraordinary of all is
the sequence (right out of Thomas Hardy) in which she
baptizes her dying baby and tries hopelessly to warm its
feet with her breath. She takes us so far inside the psy
chology of entrapment and loss and despair that we seem
to comprehend it for the first time, as we do when we read
"King Lear"; we may search our memories for other
actresses who have brought aberrant emotional states to
the screen with such breathless purity, but only a handful
come to mind — Vivien Leigh whispering, "Caught in a

trap! on the telephone as Brando advances in "A Street
car Named Desire," Katharine Hepburn dragging her an
cient wedding gown down the stairs at the end of "Long
Days Journey into Night," Diane Keaton clutching her
husband s writing award just before she calls an end to
their marriage in "Shoot the Moon." (Tennessee Williams
wrote the role of Blanche Dußois in "Streetcar" for Lil
lian Gish — a piece of information that helps us im
measurably, 1 think, in understanding his play.)
I he same year as "Way Down East," Eugene O'Neill
wrote "Beyond the Horizon," the play that won him his
first fame (and his first Pulitzer Prize); his two antagonists
were brothers, one a practical man of the soil and the
other a poet infected with wanderlust. David Bartlett, the
hero of "Way Down East," is a heroic figure in whom the
best impulses of both Mayo brothers are wedded: He is a
dedicated farmer (like his father) and a gentle-souled poet
(like his mother). Richard Barthelmess, whose career
continued into the early '40s, was that rare actor who
could carry off country-boy bashfulness without appear

ing unmanly or sacrificing any of his sensitivity — in other
words, without playing a bumpkin. And he and Gish were
an ideal match — here, where the script connects them
psychically, "Peter Ibbetson"-style, before they have even
met, and in "Broken Blossoms," where Barthelmess did
his finest work as a lonely Chinese in London's limehouse
district. The two pairs of roles are tonal opposites: in
"Broken Blossoms," the scenes between the Chinese and
the wait are overhung with a sense of tragic foreboding,
whereas the brief romantic interludes in "Way Down
East" suggest an emotional wholeness, a tightness, that
Griffith offers as a promise of happiness to come. If Anna
were to drown in that river, the movie would be un
finished — a cheat. Griffith understood this well enough
to gather all his plot strands into a bouquet for the deeply
satisfying finale; and at the end of this newly restored ver
sion of a Griffith near-masterpiece, containing the final
scene he had excised ill-judgedly sometime during the
'20s, the audience stumbles out into, the lobby grinning
and wiping away tears.
Film restoration is a marvelous mystery to me. When I
was an undergraduate, my film freak friends and I used to
fantasize that the celebrated lost footage cut from movies
before or just after their original release — the bulk of
Erich von Stroheim's "Greed," the two missing songs
from the George Cukor " A Star Is Born," the "Jitterbug"
number from " The Wizard of Oz" — would someday turn
up in a vault, dusty but intact, and at last we would be able
to see these films as their makers had intended them to be
seen.
Now these are no longer fantasies. We live in an era
where the distinction between nostalgia buff and historian
has become blurred in the arts, where men and women are
eagerly engaged in preserving the remnants of our cultural
and pop cultural past. Witness the reissue of the Blue
Note Jazz series, the trend toward reconstructing ballets
long believed to have vanished permanently from the
repertory, the wide availability of the most obscure songs
by Cole Porter and George Gershwin. And those of us
who care about movies have been fortunate enough to
reap the benefits of the remarkable work done by preser
vationists at New York's Museum of Modern Art, the
UCLA Him Archives and the L. A. County Museum. Two

baptizes her dying baby and tries hopelessly to warm its
feet with her breath. She takes us so far inside the psy
chology of entrapment and loss and despair that we seem
to comprehend it for the first time, as we do when we read
"King Lear"; we may search our memories for other
actresses who have brought aberrant emotional states to
the screen with such breathless purity, but only a handful
come to mind — Vivien Leigh whispering, "Caught in a

trap! on the telephone as Brando advances in "A Street
car Named Desire," Katharine Hepburn dragging her an
cient wedding gown down the stairs at the end of "Long
Days Journey into Night," Diane Keaton clutching her
husband s writing award just before she calls an end to
their marriage in "Shoot the Moon." (Tennessee Williams
wrote the role of Blanche Dußois in "Streetcar" for Lil
lian Gish — a piece of information that helps us im
measurably, 1 think, in understanding his play.)
I he same year as "Way Down East," Eugene O'Neill
wrote "Beyond the Horizon," the play that won him his
first fame (and his first Pulitzer Prize); his two antagonists
were brothers, one a practical man of the soil and the
other a poet infected with wanderlust. David Bartlett, the
hero of "Way Down East," is a heroic figure in whom the
best impulses of both Mayo brothers are wedded: He is a
dedicated farmer (like his father) and a gentle-souled poet
(like his mother). Richard Barthelmess, whose career
continued into the early '40s, was that rare actor who
could carry off country-boy bashfulness without appear

ing unmanly or sacrificing any of his sensitivity — in other
words, without playing a bumpkin. And he and Gish were
an ideal match — here, where the script connects them
psychically, "Peter Ibbetson"-style, before they have even
met, and in "Broken Blossoms," where Barthelmess did
his finest work as a lonely Chinese in London's limehouse
district. The two pairs of roles are tonal opposites: in
"Broken Blossoms," the scenes between the Chinese and
the wait are overhung with a sense of tragic foreboding,
whereas the brief romantic interludes in "Way Down
East" suggest an emotional wholeness, a tightness, that
Griffith offers as a promise of happiness to come. If Anna
were to drown in that river, the movie would be un
finished — a cheat. Griffith understood this well enough
to gather all his plot strands into a bouquet for the deeply
satisfying finale; and at the end of this newly restored ver
sion of a Griffith near-masterpiece, containing the final
scene he had excised ill-judgedly sometime during the
'20s, the audience stumbles out into, the lobby grinning
and wiping away tears.
Film restoration is a marvelous mystery to me. When I
was an undergraduate, my film freak friends and I used to
fantasize that the celebrated lost footage cut from movies
before or just after their original release — the bulk of
Erich von Stroheim's "Greed," the two missing songs
from the George Cukor " A Star Is Born," the "Jitterbug"
number from " The Wizard of Oz" — would someday turn
up in a vault, dusty but intact, and at last we would be able
to see these films as their makers had intended them to be
seen.
Now these are no longer fantasies. We live in an era
where the distinction between nostalgia buff and historian
has become blurred in the arts, where men and women are
eagerly engaged in preserving the remnants of our cultural
and pop cultural past. Witness the reissue of the Blue
Note Jazz series, the trend toward reconstructing ballets
long believed to have vanished permanently from the
repertory, the wide availability of the most obscure songs
by Cole Porter and George Gershwin. And those of us
who care about movies have been fortunate enough to
reap the benefits of the remarkable work done by preser
vationists at New York's Museum of Modern Art, the
UCLA Him Archives and the L. A. County Museum. Two
summers ago, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences sponsored special preview performances of a
new print of "A Star Is Born" to which Ron Haver at the
L.A. County Museum had returned all but eight of the 27
minutes cut from the release print after its New York
premiere in 1954. And last month, San Francisco
audiences were given the opportunity to see two "new"
silent movies in a single week. A print from Kino Interna
tional of the bulk of Erich von Stroheim's 1928 "Queen
Kelly" (which he never finished) provided the focus of a
week-long Stroheim festival at the Castro Theatre, and
Peter Williamson of the Museum of Modern Art in New
York arrived in Berkeley to host a Pacific Film Archive
screening of the definitive cutting of D.W. Griffith's "Way
Down East," unseen in its entirety since 1920.
If these events seem parochial, unworthy of note
outside the small community of film historians, in fact
they enrich all of us who love movies, augmenting our un
derstanding of our own popular culture, which time and
neglect have chipped away at since the first (and possibly
greatest) epoch of American movies, the silent era. Most
moviegoers believe that silent movies were "flickers" —
fatuous, melodramatic trifles so crudely shot and edited
that the actors' movements reproduced at jerky high
speed. This general misconstruction has been encouraged
not only by parodists like Mel Brooks, in his alleged
"tribute" to the heyday of the silent clowns, "Silent
Movie," but also by film teachers and the programmers of
film series all over the country, who have repeatedly (and
in some places over the outcry of distressed film
aficionados who know better) projected silents at the
wrong speed. The movies of this period were cranked at
18 frames per second, and ours run at 24; you can imagine
how substituting the latter for the former might well
garble the intentions of a great director like Griffith or
Stroheim. (The Communications Department at Stanford
owns a variable-speed projector, yet 1 have never seen a
silent movie in a public showing on campus projected at
18 frames per second.) Some years ago in another city I
took a group of friends to a showing of Griffith's "The
Birth of a Nation," having promised them a chance to see
one of the greatest movies ever produced, and a
reputable, university-affiliated movie house so wrecked it
by projecting it incorrectly that no one could calculate
what had made the film a classic. The recent attention
paid to reclaiming old films, and providing an experience
for audiences that is as close as possible to that enjoyed by
their original audiences — at Berkeley, "Way Down
East" ran for 163 minutes in a mostly tinted print (major
studio releases were often hand tinted, frame by frame)
accompanied by the original organ score (played live) —
restores the stature of filmmakers like Griffith. Unable to
see his movies as he'd meant them to be seen, many stu
dents have accepted his contribution to movies with be
wilderment, assuming erroneously that whatever he'd ac
complished has been comically superseded by the sophis
tication of contemporary film. In fact, no director, in this
country or any other, has ever surpassed D.W. Griffith;
among moviemakers, he is our Melville.
Actually, a better comparison would be to Dickens;
seen in their complete form, his movies spin like 19th
century narratives (especially "Orphans of the Storm,"
which in tone and setting — the French Revolution — was
clearly inspired by "A Tale of Two Cities"), and "Way
Down East" has a meticulous, rhymed, novelistic finish
that no one had seen in six-and-a-half decades, involving
characters whom viewers of the usual revival print would

not recognize. Imagine that the only edition of "David
Copperfield" available to readers had spanned 600 pages,
and someone suddenly reprinted the lull length (over
800-page) version, featuring subplots and characters
eliminated years ago, and you will have an idea of the ex
perience of seeing the abridged "Way Down East" and
then the print restored by the Museum of Modern Art
crew.
In this case, both the blame for the truncation and the
credit for the restoration lie chiefly in Griffith himself.
After the triumphant premiere of "Way Down East" (an
adaptation of a stage play by Lottie Blair Parker and
Joseph R. Grismer he had paid the shockingly — unprece
dentedly — exhorbitant price of $175,000 for the rights to
film; the movie repaid that investment many times over).

Griffith continued to play with it for several years and
eventually edited out about a quarter of it, including most
of the comic scenes, which the original reviewers had not
regarded favorably. When the Museum archivists set
about putting together a definitive print, many versions
were in circulation or in private collections, all of them
variants of Griffith's original; the most complete was a 16
mm. print he had donated to the Museum in the 19305.
Fortunately, he had also provided a shot-by-shot analysis
which, in tandem with the original musical score, fur
nished a model for the reconstruction. The new print con
tains all but five or six minutes of the original, and (as in
the reassembled "A Star Is Born") stills and intertitles
bridge the gaps left by missing scenes.
Griffith was a child of the 19th century; his sensibility,
like that of Dickens, was informed by the popular

melodrama he saw on the stage, and like Dickens he made
it the narrative basis of his work and transcended it. He
was also an expert thief (like Shakespeare), borrowing
ideas or even whole pasages from other storytellers and
then transforming them. "Way Down East" begins as an
updated "Cinderella" and turns into "Tess of the
d'Urbervilles," and if you look sharp you can also spot
scraps from Hawthorne, from Edith Wharton's "Ethan
Frome," and even from "Charley's Aunt." (Griffith's suc
cessors validated this process by working oil him: Images
from "Way Down East" turn up in such unexpected
places as "The Wizard of Oz" — the ornery, tyrannical
Miss Gulch is a variation on the busybody spinster Martha
Perkins — and Disney's "Snow White," where the
heroine's communion with the birds derives from a serene
interlude with Lillian Gish. And, as Pauline Kael has

pointed out, a single shot of the ice thaw on the river
spawned an entire national cinema — that of the Soviets.)
The story of the picture centers on Anna Moore (Lillian
Gish), urged by her widow mother to visit wealthy
relatives in the hopes of buoying up their diminishing fam
ily savings. Annas snobbish cousins treat her shabbily,
but an eccentric aunt whom they dare not cross (lest she
fail to acknowledge them in her will) insists that Anna be
permitted the privileges of a house guest; she dresses the
girl in beautiful new clothes and sends her downstairs to
join an elegant party, where she attracts the attention of
the incorrigible lecher Lennox Sanderson (Lowell Sher
man). (Cinderella goes to the ball and meets Alec
d'Urberville.) He courts her relentlessly and, tricking her
with a fake marriage, seduces her; when she becomes
pregnant, he reveals the truth and abandons her. The

baby dies after a few months, and Anna's landlady, Maria
Poole (Emily Fitzroy), learning of its illegitimacy, throws
her out. She wanders into the countryside, seeking em
ployment, and finds it at the home of Squire Bartlett
(Burr Mcintosh), who represents an austere, unforgiving
Puritanism, and his wife (Kate Bruce), the emblem of a
warm, charitable Christianity. Their son David (Richard
Barthelmess) is engaged to Kate Brewster (Mary Hay),
but they are ill matched and he falls in love with Anna;
her feelings of guilt cause her to reject his proposal of
marriage, however, and when Sanderson shows up once
again — this time to imperil Kate's virtue — he tries to in
timidate Anna into leaving the Bartletts' farm because he
fears for his own reputation. One day Emily Fitzroy
arrives in town and, recognizing Anna, relates her story to
the town's chief gossip. Martha Perkins (Vivia Ogden),
who passes it on to Squire Bartlett. Bartlett, appalled,
turns Anna out into a fierce snowstorm (though not
before she has unmasked her seducer); she tries to drown
herself, but David rescues her at the last moment and
Bartlett begs her forgiveness.
The plot sounds in summary like an amalgam of cliches,
and of course it was already archaic by the time Griffith
got to it. But 1 have heard audiences cheer (without irony)
during the eleventh-hour rescue in "Orphans of the
Storm," and the celebrated climax of "Way Down East,"
with Richard Barthelmess hopping from one ice floe to
the next in a frantic effort to save Lillian Gish from tum
bling into the falls, is still breathtaking. The key to under
standing Griffith's greatness, 1 think, is in seeing how he
suffuses cliches with so much feeling that they take on the
power of myth — the way the square dance does in John
Ford's "My Darling Clementine," for example, or the
whirling ballroom sequence in Orson Welles' "The Mag
nificent Ambersons" — and how he enshrines certain
images so that they seem to exist outside the bounds of
time. In "Birth of a Nation," Griffith turned to earlier
myth-makers, the painters Frederic Remington and Mat
thew Brady, for inspiration; the rural idyll in "Way Down
East" — Lillian Gish on the bank of the river with Rich
ard Barthelmess, her hair flowing down her back, and
later alone, watching the reflection of the late afternoon
sun on the water — recalls Corot. (The spanking new
print enhances the work of Griffith's photographer, Billy
Bitzer, which in deteriorated versions goes largely un
noticed. Here he is working with the assistance of Hendrik
Sartov.) Another shot of Gish on the road, hesitating at
the door of a stranger from whom she must beg food and
lodging, has the same strange balance of pastoral and dark
elements as the Bourgereau painting "The Broken
Pitcher," a metaphoric representation of lost virginity.
The entire film can be said to contain that balance, be
cause Anna is always in danger (until the very end), from
figures who in Griffith's eyes possess the grasping claws of
demons. Lennox Sanderson is not the only villain in the
piece, nor is Squire Bartlett the only pillar of Puritanism
to be toppled. As in other films (notably the modern sec
tion of "Intolerance"), Griffith seethes with anger here at
the interference of tongue-wagging spinsters; his depic
tion of the chill, granite-faced Maria Poole and the cack
ling Martha Perkins — both middle-aged single women —
contrasts with the gentle, sympathetic hand that shapes
the scenes involving the younger characters. For most of
the film Martha is a comic caricature, but. between the
time she receives Maria Poole's news and the time she
releases it, she seems to be acting under the influence of
hellish forces; there is a startling, Stroheim-like shot of
her after she has spoken, rocking back and forth in a chair,
hugging herself with vicious delight.
Certainly Griffith could not have taken the worn
platitudes of this victimized-innocent fable as far as he did
if he had chosen a different actress for the role of Anna
Moore. All the mysteries of the miracle of artistic col
laboration are embodied in the work Griffith and Lillian
Gish did together in the 1910s and early "20s, in films like
this one, "Birth of a Nation." "True Heart Susie,"
"Hearts of the World," "Orphans of the Storm" and
(especially) "Broken Blossoms." No actress has ever
portrayed domestic happiness as beautifully as Gish, be
cause no one has ever made so frighteningly clear how
fragile such contentment is and how close the abyss. In
Griffith's movies ("True Heart Susie" is an exception, and
so, actually, is "Orphans of the Storm," where it is
Dorothy Gish and not Lillian who falls into a nightmare),
Gish plays frail heroines damaged by adversity who are in
danger of being overtaken by neurotic impulses —
Ophelias hovering on the edge of the river hank. The waif
spinning round and round in the locked closet in "Broken

Blossoms," the grief-mad lover wandering the battlefields
in search of her soldier in "Hearts of the World," the
ravaged virgin drawn by the current in "Way Down East"
— these are the desperate feminine extremes to which
Gish exposes us. She did indeed play Ophelia in the '30s,
to Gielgud's Hamlet, and all that remains of that produc
tion are a handful of stills and the haunting studio portrait
by Edward Steichen; but in "Way Down East" we have a
good idea of what she must have been like. It was her own
idea to lie on the ice floe with her hair and one tiny hand
drifting in the water, and she caught a chill in that hand
that has never left her. (Her performance attained some
sort of bizarre height in physical bravery; As is well
known, she nearly went over the falls for real during the
shooting of this scene.)

Her portrayal of Anna is full of emotional changes, reg
istered with such astonishing naturalism in her delicate
face that we never catch her in a false movement. There are
the scene in which Sanderson makes a pass at her and then
soothes her offended sensibilities by proposing marriage;
the "wedding night," when her trusting devotion to her
spurious husband stirs her deeply hidden sensuality, and
she abandons herself to her childish dreams of marital
love; the scene in which Sanderson tells her the truth, and
she pulls her wedding ring on and off her finger as pathetic
proof that he must be joking. Most extraordinary of all is
the sequence (right out of Thomas Hardy) in which she
baptizes her dying baby and tries hopelessly to warm its
feet with her breath. She takes us so far inside the psy
chology of entrapment and loss and despair that we seem
to comprehend it for the first time, as we do when we read
"King Lear"; we may search our memories for other
actresses who have brought aberrant emotional states to
the screen with such breathless purity, but only a handful
come to mind — Vivien Leigh whispering, "Caught in a

trap! on the telephone as Brando advances in "A Street
car Named Desire," Katharine Hepburn dragging her an
cient wedding gown down the stairs at the end of "Long
Days Journey into Night," Diane Keaton clutching her
husband s writing award just before she calls an end to
their marriage in "Shoot the Moon." (Tennessee Williams
wrote the role of Blanche Dußois in "Streetcar" for Lil
lian Gish — a piece of information that helps us im
measurably, 1 think, in understanding his play.)

hellish forces; there is a startling, Stroheim-like shot of
her after she has spoken, rocking back and forth in a chair,
hugging herself with vicious delight.
Certainly Griffith could not have taken the worn
platitudes of this victimized-innocent fable as far as he did
if he had chosen a different actress for the role of Anna
Moore. All the mysteries of the miracle of artistic col
laboration are embodied in the work Griffith and Lillian
Gish did together in the 1910s and early "20s, in films like
this one, "Birth of a Nation." "True Heart Susie,"
"Hearts of the World," "Orphans of the Storm" and
(especially) "Broken Blossoms." No actress has ever
portrayed domestic happiness as beautifully as Gish, be
cause no one has ever made so frighteningly clear how
fragile such contentment is and how close the abyss. In
Griffith's movies ("True Heart Susie" is an exception, and
so, actually, is "Orphans of the Storm," where it is
Dorothy Gish and not Lillian who falls into a nightmare),
Gish plays frail heroines damaged by adversity who are in
danger of being overtaken by neurotic impulses —
Ophelias hovering on the edge of the river hank. The waif
spinning round and round in the locked closet in "Broken

Blossoms," the grief-mad lover wandering the battlefields
in search of her soldier in "Hearts of the World," the
ravaged virgin drawn by the current in "Way Down East"
— these are the desperate feminine extremes to which
Gish exposes us. She did indeed play Ophelia in the '30s,
to Gielgud's Hamlet, and all that remains of that produc
tion are a handful of stills and the haunting studio portrait
by Edward Steichen; but in "Way Down East" we have a
good idea of what she must have been like. It was her own
idea to lie on the ice floe with her hair and one tiny hand
drifting in the water, and she caught a chill in that hand
that has never left her. (Her performance attained some
sort of bizarre height in physical bravery; As is well
known, she nearly went over the falls for real during the
shooting of this scene.)

Her portrayal of Anna is full of emotional changes, reg
istered with such astonishing naturalism in her delicate
face that we never catch her in a false movement. There are
the scene in which Sanderson makes a pass at her and then
soothes her offended sensibilities by proposing marriage;
the "wedding night," when her trusting devotion to her
spurious husband stirs her deeply hidden sensuality, and
she abandons herself to her childish dreams of marital
love; the scene in which Sanderson tells her the truth, and
she pulls her wedding ring on and off her finger as pathetic
proof that he must be joking. Most extraordinary of all is
the sequence (right out of Thomas Hardy) in which she
baptizes her dying baby and tries hopelessly to warm its
feet with her breath. She takes us so far inside the psy
chology of entrapment and loss and despair that we seem
to comprehend it for the first time, as we do when we read
"King Lear"; we may search our memories for other
actresses who have brought aberrant emotional states to
the screen with such breathless purity, but only a handful
come to mind — Vivien Leigh whispering, "Caught in a

trap! on the telephone as Brando advances in "A Street
car Named Desire," Katharine Hepburn dragging her an
cient wedding gown down the stairs at the end of "Long
Days Journey into Night," Diane Keaton clutching her
husband s writing award just before she calls an end to
their marriage in "Shoot the Moon." (Tennessee Williams
wrote the role of Blanche Dußois in "Streetcar" for Lil
lian Gish — a piece of information that helps us im
measurably, 1 think, in understanding his play.)
I he same year as "Way Down East," Eugene O'Neill
wrote "Beyond the Horizon," the play that won him his
first fame (and his first Pulitzer Prize); his two antagonists
were brothers, one a practical man of the soil and the
other a poet infected with wanderlust. David Bartlett, the
hero of "Way Down East," is a heroic figure in whom the
best impulses of both Mayo brothers are wedded: He is a
dedicated farmer (like his father) and a gentle-souled poet
(like his mother). Richard Barthelmess, whose career
continued into the early '40s, was that rare actor who
could carry off country-boy bashfulness without appear

ing unmanly or sacrificing any of his sensitivity — in other
words, without playing a bumpkin. And he and Gish were
an ideal match — here, where the script connects them
psychically, "Peter Ibbetson"-style, before they have even
met, and in "Broken Blossoms," where Barthelmess did
his finest work as a lonely Chinese in London's limehouse
district. The two pairs of roles are tonal opposites: in
"Broken Blossoms," the scenes between the Chinese and
the wait are overhung with a sense of tragic foreboding,
whereas the brief romantic interludes in "Way Down
East" suggest an emotional wholeness, a tightness, that
Griffith offers as a promise of happiness to come. If Anna
were to drown in that river, the movie would be un
finished — a cheat. Griffith understood this well enough
to gather all his plot strands into a bouquet for the deeply
satisfying finale; and at the end of this newly restored ver
sion of a Griffith near-masterpiece, containing the final
scene he had excised ill-judgedly sometime during the
'20s, the audience stumbles out into, the lobby grinning
and wiping away tears.
Film restoration is a marvelous mystery to me. When I
was an undergraduate, my film freak friends and I used to
fantasize that the celebrated lost footage cut from movies
before or just after their original release — the bulk of
Erich von Stroheim's "Greed," the two missing songs
from the George Cukor " A Star Is Born," the "Jitterbug"
number from " The Wizard of Oz" — would someday turn
up in a vault, dusty but intact, and at last we would be able
to see these films as their makers had intended them to be
seen.
Now these are no longer fantasies. We live in an era
where the distinction between nostalgia buff and historian
has become blurred in the arts, where men and women are
eagerly engaged in preserving the remnants of our cultural
and pop cultural past. Witness the reissue of the Blue
Note Jazz series, the trend toward reconstructing ballets
long believed to have vanished permanently from the
repertory, the wide availability of the most obscure songs
by Cole Porter and George Gershwin. And those of us
who care about movies have been fortunate enough to
reap the benefits of the remarkable work done by preser
vationists at New York's Museum of Modern Art, the
UCLA Him Archives and the L. A. County Museum. Two
summers ago, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences sponsored special preview performances of a
new print of "A Star Is Born" to which Ron Haver at the
L.A. County Museum had returned all but eight of the 27
minutes cut from the release print after its New York
premiere in 1954. And last month, San Francisco
audiences were given the opportunity to see two "new"
silent movies in a single week. A print from Kino Interna
tional of the bulk of Erich von Stroheim's 1928 "Queen
Kelly" (which he never finished) provided the focus of a
week-long Stroheim festival at the Castro Theatre, and
Peter Williamson of the Museum of Modern Art in New
York arrived in Berkeley to host a Pacific Film Archive
screening of the definitive cutting of D.W. Griffith's "Way
Down East," unseen in its entirety since 1920.
If these events seem parochial, unworthy of note
outside the small community of film historians, in fact
they enrich all of us who love movies, augmenting our un
derstanding of our own popular culture, which time and
neglect have chipped away at since the first (and possibly
greatest) epoch of American movies, the silent era. Most
moviegoers believe that silent movies were "flickers" —
fatuous, melodramatic trifles so crudely shot and edited
that the actors' movements reproduced at jerky high
speed. This general misconstruction has been encouraged
not only by parodists like Mel Brooks, in his alleged
"tribute" to the heyday of the silent clowns, "Silent
Movie," but also by film teachers and the programmers of
film series all over the country, who have repeatedly (and
in some places over the outcry of distressed film
aficionados who know better) projected silents at the
wrong speed. The movies of this period were cranked at
18 frames per second, and ours run at 24; you can imagine
how substituting the latter for the former might well
garble the intentions of a great director like Griffith or
Stroheim. (The Communications Department at Stanford
owns a variable-speed projector, yet 1 have never seen a
silent movie in a public showing on campus projected at
18 frames per second.) Some years ago in another city I
took a group of friends to a showing of Griffith's "The
Birth of a Nation," having promised them a chance to see
one of the greatest movies ever produced, and a
reputable, university-affiliated movie house so wrecked it
by projecting it incorrectly that no one could calculate
what had made the film a classic. The recent attention
paid to reclaiming old films, and providing an experience
for audiences that is as close as possible to that enjoyed by
their original audiences — at Berkeley, "Way Down
East" ran for 163 minutes in a mostly tinted print (major
studio releases were often hand tinted, frame by frame)
accompanied by the original organ score (played live) —
restores the stature of filmmakers like Griffith. Unable to
see his movies as he'd meant them to be seen, many stu
dents have accepted his contribution to movies with be
wilderment, assuming erroneously that whatever he'd ac
complished has been comically superseded by the sophis
tication of contemporary film. In fact, no director, in this
country or any other, has ever surpassed D.W. Griffith;
among moviemakers, he is our Melville.
Actually, a better comparison would be to Dickens;
seen in their complete form, his movies spin like 19th
century narratives (especially "Orphans of the Storm,"
which in tone and setting — the French Revolution — was
clearly inspired by "A Tale of Two Cities"), and "Way
Down East" has a meticulous, rhymed, novelistic finish
that no one had seen in six-and-a-half decades, involving
characters whom viewers of the usual revival print would

not recognize. Imagine that the only edition of "David
Copperfield" available to readers had spanned 600 pages,
and someone suddenly reprinted the lull length (over
800-page) version, featuring subplots and characters
eliminated years ago, and you will have an idea of the ex
perience of seeing the abridged "Way Down East" and
then the print restored by the Museum of Modern Art
crew.
In this case, both the blame for the truncation and the
credit for the restoration lie chiefly in Griffith himself.
After the triumphant premiere of "Way Down East" (an
adaptation of a stage play by Lottie Blair Parker and
Joseph R. Grismer he had paid the shockingly — unprece
dentedly — exhorbitant price of $175,000 for the rights to
film; the movie repaid that investment many times over).

Griffith continued to play with it for several years and
eventually edited out about a quarter of it, including most
of the comic scenes, which the original reviewers had not
regarded favorably. When the Museum archivists set
about putting together a definitive print, many versions
were in circulation or in private collections, all of them
variants of Griffith's original; the most complete was a 16
mm. print he had donated to the Museum in the 19305.
Fortunately, he had also provided a shot-by-shot analysis
which, in tandem with the original musical score, fur
nished a model for the reconstruction. The new print con
tains all but five or six minutes of the original, and (as in
the reassembled "A Star Is Born") stills and intertitles
bridge the gaps left by missing scenes.
Griffith was a child of the 19th century; his sensibility,
like that of Dickens, was informed by the popular

melodrama he saw on the stage, and like Dickens he made
it the narrative basis of his work and transcended it. He
was also an expert thief (like Shakespeare), borrowing
ideas or even whole pasages from other storytellers and
then transforming them. "Way Down East" begins as an
updated "Cinderella" and turns into "Tess of the
d'Urbervilles," and if you look sharp you can also spot
scraps from Hawthorne, from Edith Wharton's "Ethan
Frome," and even from "Charley's Aunt." (Griffith's suc
cessors validated this process by working oil him: Images
from "Way Down East" turn up in such unexpected
places as "The Wizard of Oz" — the ornery, tyrannical
Miss Gulch is a variation on the busybody spinster Martha
Perkins — and Disney's "Snow White," where the
heroine's communion with the birds derives from a serene
interlude with Lillian Gish. And, as Pauline Kael has

pointed out, a single shot of the ice thaw on the river
spawned an entire national cinema — that of the Soviets.)
The story of the picture centers on Anna Moore (Lillian
Gish), urged by her widow mother to visit wealthy
relatives in the hopes of buoying up their diminishing fam
ily savings. Annas snobbish cousins treat her shabbily,
but an eccentric aunt whom they dare not cross (lest she
fail to acknowledge them in her will) insists that Anna be
permitted the privileges of a house guest; she dresses the
girl in beautiful new clothes and sends her downstairs to
join an elegant party, where she attracts the attention of
the incorrigible lecher Lennox Sanderson (Lowell Sher
man). (Cinderella goes to the ball and meets Alec
d'Urberville.) He courts her relentlessly and, tricking her
with a fake marriage, seduces her; when she becomes
pregnant, he reveals the truth and abandons her. The

baby dies after a few months, and Anna's landlady, Maria
Poole (Emily Fitzroy), learning of its illegitimacy, throws
her out. She wanders into the countryside, seeking em
ployment, and finds it at the home of Squire Bartlett
(Burr Mcintosh), who represents an austere, unforgiving
Puritanism, and his wife (Kate Bruce), the emblem of a
warm, charitable Christianity. Their son David (Richard
Barthelmess) is engaged to Kate Brewster (Mary Hay),
but they are ill matched and he falls in love with Anna;
her feelings of guilt cause her to reject his proposal of
marriage, however, and when Sanderson shows up once
again — this time to imperil Kate's virtue — he tries to in
timidate Anna into leaving the Bartletts' farm because he
fears for his own reputation. One day Emily Fitzroy
arrives in town and, recognizing Anna, relates her story to
the town's chief gossip. Martha Perkins (Vivia Ogden),
who passes it on to Squire Bartlett. Bartlett, appalled,
turns Anna out into a fierce snowstorm (though not
before she has unmasked her seducer); she tries to drown
herself, but David rescues her at the last moment and
Bartlett begs her forgiveness.
The plot sounds in summary like an amalgam of cliches,
and of course it was already archaic by the time Griffith
got to it. But 1 have heard audiences cheer (without irony)
during the eleventh-hour rescue in "Orphans of the
Storm," and the celebrated climax of "Way Down East,"
with Richard Barthelmess hopping from one ice floe to
the next in a frantic effort to save Lillian Gish from tum
bling into the falls, is still breathtaking. The key to under
standing Griffith's greatness, 1 think, is in seeing how he
suffuses cliches with so much feeling that they take on the
power of myth — the way the square dance does in John
Ford's "My Darling Clementine," for example, or the
whirling ballroom sequence in Orson Welles' "The Mag
nificent Ambersons" — and how he enshrines certain
images so that they seem to exist outside the bounds of
time. In "Birth of a Nation," Griffith turned to earlier
myth-makers, the painters Frederic Remington and Mat
thew Brady, for inspiration; the rural idyll in "Way Down
East" — Lillian Gish on the bank of the river with Rich
ard Barthelmess, her hair flowing down her back, and
later alone, watching the reflection of the late afternoon
sun on the water — recalls Corot. (The spanking new
print enhances the work of Griffith's photographer, Billy
Bitzer, which in deteriorated versions goes largely un
noticed. Here he is working with the assistance of Hendrik
Sartov.) Another shot of Gish on the road, hesitating at
the door of a stranger from whom she must beg food and
lodging, has the same strange balance of pastoral and dark
elements as the Bourgereau painting "The Broken
Pitcher," a metaphoric representation of lost virginity.
The entire film can be said to contain that balance, be
cause Anna is always in danger (until the very end), from
figures who in Griffith's eyes possess the grasping claws of
demons. Lennox Sanderson is not the only villain in the
piece, nor is Squire Bartlett the only pillar of Puritanism
to be toppled. As in other films (notably the modern sec
tion of "Intolerance"), Griffith seethes with anger here at
the interference of tongue-wagging spinsters; his depic
tion of the chill, granite-faced Maria Poole and the cack
ling Martha Perkins — both middle-aged single women —
contrasts with the gentle, sympathetic hand that shapes
the scenes involving the younger characters. For most of
the film Martha is a comic caricature, but. between the
time she receives Maria Poole's news and the time she
releases it, she seems to be acting under the influence of
hellish forces; there is a startling, Stroheim-like shot of
her after she has spoken, rocking back and forth in a chair,
hugging herself with vicious delight.
Certainly Griffith could not have taken the worn
platitudes of this victimized-innocent fable as far as he did
if he had chosen a different actress for the role of Anna
Moore. All the mysteries of the miracle of artistic col
laboration are embodied in the work Griffith and Lillian

so, actually, is "Orphans of the Storm," where it is
Dorothy Gish and not Lillian who falls into a nightmare),
Gish plays frail heroines damaged by adversity who are in
danger of being overtaken by neurotic impulses —
Ophelias hovering on the edge of the river hank. The waif
spinning round and round in the locked closet in "Broken

Blossoms," the grief-mad lover wandering the battlefields
in search of her soldier in "Hearts of the World," the
ravaged virgin drawn by the current in "Way Down East"
— these are the desperate feminine extremes to which
Gish exposes us. She did indeed play Ophelia in the '30s,
to Gielgud's Hamlet, and all that remains of that produc

turns Anna out into a fierce snowstorm (though not
before she has unmasked her seducer); she tries to drown
herself, but David rescues her at the last moment and
Bartlett begs her forgiveness.
The plot sounds in summary like an amalgam of cliches,
and of course it was already archaic by the time Griffith
got to it. But 1 have heard audiences cheer (without irony)
during the eleventh-hour rescue in "Orphans of the
Storm," and the celebrated climax of "Way Down East,"
with Richard Barthelmess hopping from one ice floe to
the next in a frantic effort to save Lillian Gish from tum
bling into the falls, is still breathtaking. The key to under
standing Griffith's greatness, 1 think, is in seeing how he
suffuses cliches with so much feeling that they take on the
power of myth — the way the square dance does in John
Ford's "My Darling Clementine," for example, or the
whirling ballroom sequence in Orson Welles' "The Mag
nificent Ambersons" — and how he enshrines certain
images so that they seem to exist outside the bounds of
time. In "Birth of a Nation," Griffith turned to earlier
myth-makers, the painters Frederic Remington and Mat
thew Brady, for inspiration; the rural idyll in "Way Down
East" — Lillian Gish on the bank of the river with Rich
ard Barthelmess, her hair flowing down her back, and
later alone, watching the reflection of the late afternoon
sun on the water — recalls Corot. (The spanking new
print enhances the work of Griffith's photographer, Billy
Bitzer, which in deteriorated versions goes largely un
noticed. Here he is working with the assistance of Hendrik
Sartov.) Another shot of Gish on the road, hesitating at
the door of a stranger from whom she must beg food and
lodging, has the same strange balance of pastoral and dark
elements as the Bourgereau painting "The Broken
Pitcher," a metaphoric representation of lost virginity.
The entire film can be said to contain that balance, be
cause Anna is always in danger (until the very end), from
figures who in Griffith's eyes possess the grasping claws of
demons. Lennox Sanderson is not the only villain in the
piece, nor is Squire Bartlett the only pillar of Puritanism
to be toppled. As in other films (notably the modern sec
tion of "Intolerance"), Griffith seethes with anger here at
the interference of tongue-wagging spinsters; his depic
tion of the chill, granite-faced Maria Poole and the cack
ling Martha Perkins — both middle-aged single women —
contrasts with the gentle, sympathetic hand that shapes
the scenes involving the younger characters. For most of
the film Martha is a comic caricature, but. between the
time she receives Maria Poole's news and the time she
releases it, she seems to be acting under the influence of
hellish forces; there is a startling, Stroheim-like shot of
her after she has spoken, rocking back and forth in a chair,
hugging herself with vicious delight.
Certainly Griffith could not have taken the worn
platitudes of this victimized-innocent fable as far as he did
if he had chosen a different actress for the role of Anna
Moore. All the mysteries of the miracle of artistic col
laboration are embodied in the work Griffith and Lillian
Gish did together in the 1910s and early "20s, in films like
this one, "Birth of a Nation." "True Heart Susie,"
"Hearts of the World," "Orphans of the Storm" and
(especially) "Broken Blossoms." No actress has ever
portrayed domestic happiness as beautifully as Gish, be
cause no one has ever made so frighteningly clear how
fragile such contentment is and how close the abyss. In
Griffith's movies ("True Heart Susie" is an exception, and
so, actually, is "Orphans of the Storm," where it is
Dorothy Gish and not Lillian who falls into a nightmare),
Gish plays frail heroines damaged by adversity who are in
danger of being overtaken by neurotic impulses —
Ophelias hovering on the edge of the river hank. The waif
spinning round and round in the locked closet in "Broken

Blossoms," the grief-mad lover wandering the battlefields
in search of her soldier in "Hearts of the World," the
ravaged virgin drawn by the current in "Way Down East"
— these are the desperate feminine extremes to which
Gish exposes us. She did indeed play Ophelia in the '30s,
to Gielgud's Hamlet, and all that remains of that produc
tion are a handful of stills and the haunting studio portrait
by Edward Steichen; but in "Way Down East" we have a
good idea of what she must have been like. It was her own
idea to lie on the ice floe with her hair and one tiny hand
drifting in the water, and she caught a chill in that hand
that has never left her. (Her performance attained some
sort of bizarre height in physical bravery; As is well
known, she nearly went over the falls for real during the
shooting of this scene.)

Her portrayal of Anna is full of emotional changes, reg
istered with such astonishing naturalism in her delicate
face that we never catch her in a false movement. There are
the scene in which Sanderson makes a pass at her and then
soothes her offended sensibilities by proposing marriage;
the "wedding night," when her trusting devotion to her
spurious husband stirs her deeply hidden sensuality, and
she abandons herself to her childish dreams of marital
love; the scene in which Sanderson tells her the truth, and
she pulls her wedding ring on and off her finger as pathetic
proof that he must be joking. Most extraordinary of all is
the sequence (right out of Thomas Hardy) in which she
baptizes her dying baby and tries hopelessly to warm its
feet with her breath. She takes us so far inside the psy
chology of entrapment and loss and despair that we seem
to comprehend it for the first time, as we do when we read
"King Lear"; we may search our memories for other
actresses who have brought aberrant emotional states to
the screen with such breathless purity, but only a handful
come to mind — Vivien Leigh whispering, "Caught in a

trap! on the telephone as Brando advances in "A Street
car Named Desire," Katharine Hepburn dragging her an
cient wedding gown down the stairs at the end of "Long
Days Journey into Night," Diane Keaton clutching her
husband s writing award just before she calls an end to
their marriage in "Shoot the Moon." (Tennessee Williams
wrote the role of Blanche Dußois in "Streetcar" for Lil
lian Gish — a piece of information that helps us im
measurably, 1 think, in understanding his play.)
I he same year as "Way Down East," Eugene O'Neill
wrote "Beyond the Horizon," the play that won him his
first fame (and his first Pulitzer Prize); his two antagonists
were brothers, one a practical man of the soil and the
other a poet infected with wanderlust. David Bartlett, the
hero of "Way Down East," is a heroic figure in whom the
best impulses of both Mayo brothers are wedded: He is a
dedicated farmer (like his father) and a gentle-souled poet
(like his mother). Richard Barthelmess, whose career
continued into the early '40s, was that rare actor who
could carry off country-boy bashfulness without appear

ing unmanly or sacrificing any of his sensitivity — in other
words, without playing a bumpkin. And he and Gish were
an ideal match — here, where the script connects them
psychically, "Peter Ibbetson"-style, before they have even
met, and in "Broken Blossoms," where Barthelmess did
his finest work as a lonely Chinese in London's limehouse
district. The two pairs of roles are tonal opposites: in
"Broken Blossoms," the scenes between the Chinese and
the wait are overhung with a sense of tragic foreboding,
whereas the brief romantic interludes in "Way Down
East" suggest an emotional wholeness, a tightness, that
Griffith offers as a promise of happiness to come. If Anna
were to drown in that river, the movie would be un
finished — a cheat. Griffith understood this well enough
to gather all his plot strands into a bouquet for the deeply
satisfying finale; and at the end of this newly restored ver
sion of a Griffith near-masterpiece, containing the final
scene he had excised ill-judgedly sometime during the
'20s, the audience stumbles out into, the lobby grinning
and wiping away tears.
Film restoration is a marvelous mystery to me. When I
was an undergraduate, my film freak friends and I used to
fantasize that the celebrated lost footage cut from movies
before or just after their original release — the bulk of
Erich von Stroheim's "Greed," the two missing songs
from the George Cukor " A Star Is Born," the "Jitterbug"
number from " The Wizard of Oz" — would someday turn
up in a vault, dusty but intact, and at last we would be able
to see these films as their makers had intended them to be
seen.
Now these are no longer fantasies. We live in an era
where the distinction between nostalgia buff and historian
has become blurred in the arts, where men and women are
eagerly engaged in preserving the remnants of our cultural
and pop cultural past. Witness the reissue of the Blue
Note Jazz series, the trend toward reconstructing ballets
long believed to have vanished permanently from the
repertory, the wide availability of the most obscure songs
by Cole Porter and George Gershwin. And those of us
who care about movies have been fortunate enough to
reap the benefits of the remarkable work done by preser
vationists at New York's Museum of Modern Art, the
UCLA Him Archives and the L. A. County Museum. Two
summers ago, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences sponsored special preview performances of a
new print of "A Star Is Born" to which Ron Haver at the
L.A. County Museum had returned all but eight of the 27
minutes cut from the release print after its New York
premiere in 1954. And last month, San Francisco
audiences were given the opportunity to see two "new"
silent movies in a single week. A print from Kino Interna
tional of the bulk of Erich von Stroheim's 1928 "Queen
Kelly" (which he never finished) provided the focus of a
week-long Stroheim festival at the Castro Theatre, and
Peter Williamson of the Museum of Modern Art in New
York arrived in Berkeley to host a Pacific Film Archive
screening of the definitive cutting of D.W. Griffith's "Way
Down East," unseen in its entirety since 1920.
If these events seem parochial, unworthy of note
outside the small community of film historians, in fact
they enrich all of us who love movies, augmenting our un
derstanding of our own popular culture, which time and
neglect have chipped away at since the first (and possibly
greatest) epoch of American movies, the silent era. Most
moviegoers believe that silent movies were "flickers" —
fatuous, melodramatic trifles so crudely shot and edited
that the actors' movements reproduced at jerky high
speed. This general misconstruction has been encouraged
not only by parodists like Mel Brooks, in his alleged
"tribute" to the heyday of the silent clowns, "Silent
Movie," but also by film teachers and the programmers of
film series all over the country, who have repeatedly (and
in some places over the outcry of distressed film
aficionados who know better) projected silents at the
wrong speed. The movies of this period were cranked at
18 frames per second, and ours run at 24; you can imagine
how substituting the latter for the former might well
garble the intentions of a great director like Griffith or
Stroheim. (The Communications Department at Stanford
owns a variable-speed projector, yet 1 have never seen a
silent movie in a public showing on campus projected at
18 frames per second.) Some years ago in another city I
took a group of friends to a showing of Griffith's "The
Birth of a Nation," having promised them a chance to see
one of the greatest movies ever produced, and a
reputable, university-affiliated movie house so wrecked it
by projecting it incorrectly that no one could calculate
what had made the film a classic. The recent attention
paid to reclaiming old films, and providing an experience
for audiences that is as close as possible to that enjoyed by
their original audiences — at Berkeley, "Way Down
East" ran for 163 minutes in a mostly tinted print (major
studio releases were often hand tinted, frame by frame)
accompanied by the original organ score (played live) —
restores the stature of filmmakers like Griffith. Unable to
see his movies as he'd meant them to be seen, many stu
dents have accepted his contribution to movies with be
wilderment, assuming erroneously that whatever he'd ac
complished has been comically superseded by the sophis
tication of contemporary film. In fact, no director, in this
country or any other, has ever surpassed D.W. Griffith;
among moviemakers, he is our Melville.
Actually, a better comparison would be to Dickens;
seen in their complete form, his movies spin like 19th
century narratives (especially "Orphans of the Storm,"
which in tone and setting — the French Revolution — was
clearly inspired by "A Tale of Two Cities"), and "Way
Down East" has a meticulous, rhymed, novelistic finish
that no one had seen in six-and-a-half decades, involving
characters whom viewers of the usual revival print would

not recognize. Imagine that the only edition of "David
Copperfield" available to readers had spanned 600 pages,
and someone suddenly reprinted the lull length (over
800-page) version, featuring subplots and characters
eliminated years ago, and you will have an idea of the ex
perience of seeing the abridged "Way Down East" and
then the print restored by the Museum of Modern Art
crew.
In this case, both the blame for the truncation and the
credit for the restoration lie chiefly in Griffith himself.
After the triumphant premiere of "Way Down East" (an
adaptation of a stage play by Lottie Blair Parker and
Joseph R. Grismer he had paid the shockingly — unprece
dentedly — exhorbitant price of $175,000 for the rights to
film; the movie repaid that investment many times over).

Griffith continued to play with it for several years and
eventually edited out about a quarter of it, including most
of the comic scenes, which the original reviewers had not
regarded favorably. When the Museum archivists set
about putting together a definitive print, many versions
were in circulation or in private collections, all of them
variants of Griffith's original; the most complete was a 16
mm. print he had donated to the Museum in the 19305.
Fortunately, he had also provided a shot-by-shot analysis
which, in tandem with the original musical score, fur
nished a model for the reconstruction. The new print con
tains all but five or six minutes of the original, and (as in
the reassembled "A Star Is Born") stills and intertitles
bridge the gaps left by missing scenes.
Griffith was a child of the 19th century; his sensibility,
like that of Dickens, was informed by the popular

melodrama he saw on the stage, and like Dickens he made
it the narrative basis of his work and transcended it. He
was also an expert thief (like Shakespeare), borrowing
ideas or even whole pasages from other storytellers and
then transforming them. "Way Down East" begins as an
updated "Cinderella" and turns into "Tess of the
d'Urbervilles," and if you look sharp you can also spot
scraps from Hawthorne, from Edith Wharton's "Ethan
Frome," and even from "Charley's Aunt." (Griffith's suc
cessors validated this process by working oil him: Images
from "Way Down East" turn up in such unexpected
places as "The Wizard of Oz" — the ornery, tyrannical
Miss Gulch is a variation on the busybody spinster Martha
Perkins — and Disney's "Snow White," where the
heroine's communion with the birds derives from a serene
interlude with Lillian Gish. And, as Pauline Kael has

pointed out, a single shot of the ice thaw on the river
spawned an entire national cinema — that of the Soviets.)
The story of the picture centers on Anna Moore (Lillian
Gish), urged by her widow mother to visit wealthy
relatives in the hopes of buoying up their diminishing fam
ily savings. Annas snobbish cousins treat her shabbily,
but an eccentric aunt whom they dare not cross (lest she
fail to acknowledge them in her will) insists that Anna be
permitted the privileges of a house guest; she dresses the
girl in beautiful new clothes and sends her downstairs to
join an elegant party, where she attracts the attention of
the incorrigible lecher Lennox Sanderson (Lowell Sher
man). (Cinderella goes to the ball and meets Alec
d'Urberville.) He courts her relentlessly and, tricking her
with a fake marriage, seduces her; when she becomes
pregnant, he reveals the truth and abandons her. The

baby dies after a few months, and Anna's landlady, Maria
Poole (Emily Fitzroy), learning of its illegitimacy, throws
her out. She wanders into the countryside, seeking em
ployment, and finds it at the home of Squire Bartlett
(Burr Mcintosh), who represents an austere, unforgiving
Puritanism, and his wife (Kate Bruce), the emblem of a
warm, charitable Christianity. Their son David (Richard
Barthelmess) is engaged to Kate Brewster (Mary Hay),
but they are ill matched and he falls in love with Anna;
her feelings of guilt cause her to reject his proposal of
marriage, however, and when Sanderson shows up once
again — this time to imperil Kate's virtue — he tries to in
timidate Anna into leaving the Bartletts' farm because he
fears for his own reputation. One day Emily Fitzroy
arrives in town and, recognizing Anna, relates her story to
the town's chief gossip. Martha Perkins (Vivia Ogden),
who passes it on to Squire Bartlett. Bartlett, appalled,
turns Anna out into a fierce snowstorm (though not
before she has unmasked her seducer); she tries to drown
herself, but David rescues her at the last moment and
Bartlett begs her forgiveness.
The plot sounds in summary like an amalgam of cliches,
and of course it was already archaic by the time Griffith

bling into the falls, is still breathtaking. The key to under
standing Griffith's greatness, 1 think, is in seeing how he
suffuses cliches with so much feeling that they take on the
power of myth — the way the square dance does in John
Ford's "My Darling Clementine," for example, or the
whirling ballroom sequence in Orson Welles' "The Mag
nificent Ambersons" — and how he enshrines certain
images so that they seem to exist outside the bounds of
time. In "Birth of a Nation," Griffith turned to earlier

the door of a stranger from whom she must beg food and
