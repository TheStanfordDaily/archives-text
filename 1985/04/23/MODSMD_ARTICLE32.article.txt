# 'The Gondoliers': comic opera excellently re-created
## The
						Stanford Savoyards bring Gilbert and Sullivan's musical to the stage in a quality production 
### TODD RAMMING Senior staff writer 
Quipping and quaffing in the
British tradition, the Stanford
Savoyards have proven themselves up
to the task of capturing the subtle
wordplay and comic characterization
of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera,
"The Gondoliers," which concludes
its run this weekend at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
The orchestra, unfortunately, does
not match the talent and expertise of
the actors. The musicians seem un
prepared and approach the overture
with timidity. Throughout the perfor
mance, the orchestra fails to convey
the depth and emotion of the Sullivan
compositions.
I he music of Gilbert and Sullivan
operas, it must be acknowledged, is
renowned for its fiendish difficulty.
Nonetheless, the obviously well
prepared actors deserve an orchestra
suficiently well rehearsed so as to

play with the energy and confidence a
Sullivan composition requires.
The sizeable opening-night crowd
remained appreciative, however, for
the impressive chrorus of contadine
(country girls) and gondolieri, and of
course the soloists, drowned the
weakness of the orchestra in a flow of
words delivered with clarity and
range of surpassing quality.
During the two-and-one-half-hour
performance, the plot unravels along
the lines of rather standard comic
fare. Twenty years before the opera
opens, the heroine Casilda was
married as a baby to the infant heir of
the throne of Barataria. The heir
soon disappeared, however, sup
posedly to Venice. The Duke of
Plaza-Toro, accompanied by the
Duchess, their daughter Casilda and
their attendant, Luiz, sail to Venice in
search of the missing monarch.
In Venice, Don Alhambra, the
Grand Inquisitor, informs the Duke's
party the missing heir is one of the

two gondoliers, Marco and Giuseppe.
It is known beyond a shadow of a
doubt, however, that it is not known
which of the two is which, the In
quisitor affirms.
Giuseppe and Marco rule jointly in
Barataria, where they establish a re
publican monarchy. Giuseppe and
Marco, who have both taken wives,
are yet unaware that whichever is the
heir has been previously married.
As the plot reaches a climax of
comic complexity, the nurse of the in
fant heir arrives to resolve all con
flicts.
Although staying within the limits
of the stylized method of speaking
typical of the Gilbert and Sullivan
tradition, several actors create quite
colorful characters. Chris Dant as the
Duke, Roger Graves as the atten
dant, Ed Glazier as the Grand In
quisitor and Andrew Arrow as Marco
add real personality to the stock char
acters which they play.

The chorus constantly maintains an
awareness of its presence on stage
and, although often in the back
ground. continually varies its activity.
Not satisfied to repeat mindlessly
some particular motion, each chorus
member seems as careful with his ac
tions as if he were at center stage.
Granted, the humor of Gilbert and
Sullivan, so expertly recreated by the
Savoyards, comes from a bygone era.
"The Gondoliers" first ran at the
Savoy Theatre on Dec. 14. 1889.
Despite the 100-year gap. even a
died-in-the-wool Benny Hill fan
would give way to laughter when the
Duke of Plaza-Toro attempts to in
struct the Marco and Guiseppe in
proper court etiquette.
An excellent, well-rehearsed and
faithfully recreated rendition of Gil
bert and Sullivan fare, the current
Savoyard production of "The Gon
doliers" is well worth the $6.50 ticket
price ($4.00 for students).


Janet Homayounfar, Chris Dant, Diane Listen and Roger Graves from
"The Gondoliers." Three more performances are scheduled for Friday,
