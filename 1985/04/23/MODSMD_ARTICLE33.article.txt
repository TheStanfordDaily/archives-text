## Minister raps apartheid 
### WILLIAM PENNEY 
A Stanford minister raised in South Africa yesterday
criticized religious groups in that country for not taking a
more solid stance against the apartheid regime.
Ernie Young, chaplain at the Stanford Medical Center,
outlined his views and fielded questions about religious
resistance to apartheid in South Africa in a forum held at
the Bechtel International Center.
Young lived in South Africa until coming to the United
States in 1974. when political pressure forced him to leave
South Africa. Young said the pressure came in the
form of being banned by the government, which he des
cribed as "a fate worse than death, especially for a
writer." He went on to say that a banned person must stay
in his home "from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m." and that he "may not
publish, speak or have anything to do with the written
word." or even "be around photocopiers."
Young was banned because of his outspoken opposition
to the apartheid system. After living in the United States
lor five years, he became a U.S. citizen in 1979.
Young catagorized religious groups as "supportive,"
"apolitical" or "in opposition" to the apartheid regime.
He pointed to the Christian Dutch Reformed Church as
supportive of apartheid, saying its clergymen "justify
(apartheid) biblically and theologically through the Old
Testament." He said the church feels "that's how it will be
when the kingdom comes."
According to Young, religous groups "apolitical"
toward apartheid include Baptists, Lutherans, Pentacos
tals, Jews, Roman Catholics and the predominantly black
Church of Zion.
"Roman Catholics and Jews were victims of enormous
anti-semitism and prejudice from the whites'
predominantly Calvinist religions," until, he noted, the

outset of South Africa's alliance with Israel, which he
"could not understand, especially in light of the
Holocaust."
Religious groups in opposition to apartheid are the
"daughter churches" of the Dutch Reformed Church. He
described their position as "bringing people to the
surface" who are opposed to apartheid.
In all. Young made the point that "the churches have
done very little to oppose the present regime," but have
served to bring forth individuals, such as Nobel Prize win
ner Archbishop Desmond Tutu, to form an "effective op
position." He added later, "1 don't see the churches doing
it (opposing apartheid). I sec individuals doing it."
Young also answered questions from the audience of
about 35. Responding to the concern that only blacks
would be hurt by an American boycott of South Africa, he
reported that American firms employ only "22,000 blacks
out of a black population of 22 million."
He described a policy that benefits 22,000 people as
"short-sighted." Young said he believes the attitudes of
South African blacks toward the United States could
become resentful when change comes to South Africa.
"Come the revolution, there may be so much anger
toward Americans," he warned.
Looking ahead, he answered a question concerning
South Africa's future by describing the current violence as
"a turning point" which "escalates the underlying anger"
among the people. He concluded by saying he felt a
"sense that change is happening" within the segregated
nation.
Yesterday's forum was the second in the International
Perspectives on Peace series presented by members of
Stanford's international community.
