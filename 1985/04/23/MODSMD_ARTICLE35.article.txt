# Briefly

Edit board meets today at 4.
Another reminder: Daily Terror,
the heretofore undefeated Daily IM
softball team, takes on its first real
opponent Saturday at 1 p.m. All
Tards are welcome on the IM fields.
Be there or be out at third.
Happy hour possibilities loom large
on the horizon.
I don't care what Clint and Mike
tell you: I'm in command here.
Briefly is back, a giant on the scene,
really making a name for itself.
It's not the only one building a
future. There's more to Mary than
her body; she is, thanks to her wit an
grace, promoting the cause of sister
hood. Best wishes for her continued
success. Make contacts early, and re
member, stories mean clips.
