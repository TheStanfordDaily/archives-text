# ASSU tallies extra ballots
## Changes in graduate senate race 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
The addition of approximately 325
ballots had little impact on the results
of last week's ASSU elections, affect
ing only the order of alternate
graduate senators and failing to
change the outcome of any fee assess
ment measures.
According to Kevin Gross, ASSU
elections commissioner, the new
results include approximately 250
graduate student votes "where the
district was not marked correctly"
and 68 absentee and improperly com
pleted ballots.
In a related matter, Gross said that
a number of groups seeking fee as
sessments failed to turn in a state
ment of financial disclosure detailing
campaign funding and expenditures
before last Friday's deadline. Gross
said that technically such groups
could be disqualified from the elec
tion, although he added that it is
unlikely such action would be taken.
"I think it's extremely negligent of
groups which are seeking large fee as
sessments from the students to fail to
comply with election regulations,"
Gross said.
According to ASSU Hearings Offi
cer Mike Heller, the groups failing to
turn in statements were the Rape
Education Project, The Band, the
Axe Committee, ASSU Legal Coun
seling. the Chaparral, Club Sports
and SURE.
Heller said he was unsure of what
action would be taken against the
groups, adding that any action must
first be approved by the ASSU
hearing committee. Heller said he

would meet with members of the
committee this week.
The tightly contested race for four
voting positions in the graduate sen
ate district of humanities and science
changed slightly with the tabulation
of the new ballots, as the fifth- and
sixth-place finishers after the initial
count reversed postions. After the
final count, a total of four votes
separated Richard Beigel, winner of
the last voting seat, from Jim
DeLaHunt and Jim McGrath, the
fifth- and sixth-place finishers,
respectively.
DeLaHunt, who had trailed
McGrath by one vote after the initial
results, surpassed the veteran senator
162-161 to grab the fifth postion.
Beigel maintained his slim three-vote
lead for fourth place, finishing with
165 votes.
DeLaHunt and McGrath, along
with Tim Childs and Frederick
Vachss, the seventh- and eighth-place
finishers, respectively, will serve as
alternate senators from that district.
Current Senate Chair Eric Berg,
Brita Jaffee and Frances Pordes
captured the first three humanities
and sciences graduate senate spots.
Alternate senators, while not
granted automatic voting privileges,
may speak in senate debates and
write bills. In addition, if a voting
senator is absent from an ASSU
meeting, an alternate senator may
assume the voting rights of the absent
senator.

politics for several years and a fre
