# John Kenneth Galbraith:
## Developed states impose ideals 
### MARK LAWRENCE Staff writer 
Arguing that developed nations
neglect their own histories and
wrongfully impose industry and
their ideologies on developing na
tions. John Kenneth Galbraith last
night spoke on the roots of hunger
in the developing world.
Galbraith, emeritus professor of
economies at Harvard, addressed a
packed Terman Auditorium in a
speech entitled "Ideology and
Agricultural Development." His
appearance was sponsored by the
Stanford International Develop
ment Organization as a follow-up to
the conference on hunger held here
two weeks ago.
Galbraith. the author of several
books, including "The New Indus
trial State" and"The Affluent Soci
ety." drew upon his experience as
ambassador to India during the
Kennedy administration to examine
agriculture as a necessary stage in
national development. He gave a
similar speech last October at the
United Nations for a ceremony ob
serving World Food Day.
"The greatest problem of our
time is to bring nuclear weapons

and warriors under control, but we
also have to deal with hunger," said
Galbraith. He acknowledged that
short-term relief efforts are
"extraordinarily important" but
chose to address the issues of devel
opment with a "larger view."
"Economic life is a historical
process, a constant process of trans
formation." Galbraith said. "The
mistake is in believing that the ad
vanced industrial countries, socialist
or capitalist in their developed
form, arc a guide and a model for
the less advanced," he said.
Galbraith said, "For each stage in
the sequence of economic develop
ment. there is an appropriate
policy."
Developed nations. both
capitalist and socialist, have at
tempted to impose industrialization
and the ideologies currently
working for them upon developing
economies, he said.
Developing nations, he said, go
through a process that must begin
with the establishment of
agriculture. In his address to the
United Nations, he said. "In all the
earlier stages of economic develop
ment. the appropriate and efficient

and necessary emphasis is on
agriculture."
Developed nations have lost sight
of their own agricultural origins, he
added. Before industrialization oc
curred in those countries,
agriculture had the "highest claim."
"So it was in Europe before the
Industrial Revolution, in the United

States in the last century and then in
what is now the Soviet Union. The
reason for this agricultural emphasis
is simple and forthright: The first
essentials of life arc food and
textiles." he said.

come up, industrialized countries
look at their own industrial develop
ment, and it is industrialization that
they stress," he said.
In addition. Galbraith said that
questions of political ideology are
meaningless to the developing
country.
"Here, neither questions of

capitalism [nor] socialism are relevant
to agricultural development. We must
follow a third system, a system of
agriculture. We see the need that de
veloping nations not burden them
selves with the ideological baggage of
developed nations," he said.
Galbraith called such imposition by
the developed world a "conspiracy of
error." He added. "It must not con
tinue."
Following Galbraith's address,
David Abcrnethy, a professor of poli

tical science; Mary Williamson, a
senior majoring in international rela
tions and history; and Francisco
Thometz, a doctoral student in
developmental economics, com
mented on and raised questions about
the speech.
In addition to the audience in Ter
man Auditorium, an overflow crowd
of approximately 200 watched the
speech via closed-circuit television in
Skilling Auditorium and Room 156
in Terman.
