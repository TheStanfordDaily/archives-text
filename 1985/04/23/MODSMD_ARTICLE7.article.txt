What is so hard about spending
$15,000?
Over the past LI years, Ham
marskjold House has amassed
$14,869 in unspent house dues, and
house residents arc not sure what to
do with the money.
A "growing consciousness" of the
money has developed over the past
year, according to Gideon Yoffe, a
resident of the international theme
house. Now residents arc submitting
proposals for its use.
"We want to put it to good use,"
Yoffe said. "We're not going to spend
it on VCKs, hot tubs or beach trips."
The house has agreed to use part of
the interest on the money market ac
count for a public service fellowship.
Acording to fellowship organizer
Yoffe. the $400 to 800 fellowship will
support one to three students who
will travel abroad this summer to do
voluntary social work through an es
tablished organization such as
Amigos of America and Crossroads

Africa. The fellowship will he open to
Jill Stanford students who are not cur
rent Hammarskjold residents.
Two years ago. Financial Manager
Kate Howard found the surplus
money in at least three different and
unknown accounts, according to Vic
tor Valdivia, current financial
manager.
In past years, not all of the money
collected for room and hoard was
spent. Voffe said. "We save the extra
money for an emergency." For the
past two years, the annual surplus
money was distributed to residents in
the form of rebates instead of saved
in an account.
House residents plan to spend only
the interest on the principal. Yoffe
said that no one could object to
spending the interest. "We feel we
can't touch the capital because it's not
really ours." he said.
House residents say they plan to
send letters to 2(H) past residents to
get suggestions about what to do with
the money in the future.
