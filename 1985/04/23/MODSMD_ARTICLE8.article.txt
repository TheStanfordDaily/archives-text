Soviets: Force not to be ruled out
WASHINGTON — The Soviet Union, disputing the State Depart
ment's account, said yesterday it had not ruled out the use of force to
prevent a recurrence of the shooting of a U.S. Army major by a Soviet
sentry in East Germany.
In a statement issued here, the Soviets called the slaying of Maj. Ar
thur Nicholson "regrettable" but said they had not "renounced the right
to take legitimate steps" to stop an unknown intruder on an espionage
mission.
Nicholson was shot while on a reconnaissance mission. After a.meeting
of the top U.S. and Soviet military officers in Germany, the State De
partment announced last Tuesday the Soviets had agreed not to permit
"use of force or weapons" against American military liaison personnel.
The statement, signed by Boris Malakhov, a second secretary in the
Soviet embassy, said "one cannot help but be puzzled" by the State De
partment account.
It went on to accuse the department of presenting the results of the
meeting of the military officers "in a distorted light."
First, the embassy said, the Soviets had not agreed to consider some
sort of compensation for Nicholson's slaying. Second, it said, the Soviets
had not renounced the right to take legitimate steps provided for by mili
tary manuals.
"The actions of the Soviet sentry were completely lawful," the state
ment said. "They were not taken against a member of the U.S. military
mission, as such, but against an unknown intruder who was carrying out
an intelligence mission and did not comply with the warnings of the
sentry."
There was no immediate response from the State Department.
Cease-fire fails to halt war
BEIRUT, Lebanon — The Christian militia commander declared a
cease-fire in Sidon yesterday but combat continued in the southern port
city, which has been a Christian-Moslem battleground for nearly a
month. At least 111 people have been reported killed.
Christian gunners in the hills east of Sidon were in action throughout
the day. Sporadic shellfire still fell on the city's suburbs after the cease
fire called by Samir Geagea, chief of staff of the Lebanese Forces militia,
and a few hours later intermittent machine-gun fire was heard east of the
city.
A Christian militia official in Beirut claimed Moslem gunners were
firing on Christian villages east of Sidon after the cease-fire, which was
called on the 25th day of fighting.
The spokesman, who spoke on condition he not be identified, said
Christian fighters "are observing the cease-fire" and not returning fire.
Geagea told a news conference earlier in the day at his headquarters
in east Beirut, the Christian sector of the Lebanese capital, that he would
withdraw his fighters from Sidon's outskirts today.
He said he ordered his men to stop shooting "even if the cease-fire is
only from one side." ,
Soviets accused of more site buildup
WASHINGTON — Despite Mikhail Gorbachev's announcement of a
unilateral freeze, the Soviet Union has continued construction of seven
European sites for SS-20 nuclear missiles, U.S. Arms Control Director
Kenneth Adelman said yesterday.
"It fits with previous Soviet moratoriums wherein they say they stop
but meanwhile the threat posed increases and increases," Adelman told
The Associated Press.
"If there is a moratorium they sure haven't started any new SS-20
sites, but they have continued aggressively on the ones that already were
under construction," said another U.S. official who demanded
anonymity.
Adelman said the United States would maintain its schedule of
deploying new Pershing 2 and cruise missiles in Western Europe, aimed
at Soviet territory. About 100 have been installed in West Germany,
Britain and Italy.
Gorbachev announced on April 7 that the Soviets would halt SS-20
installations until November. He asked the United States to join in a
number of arms control measures.
The Easter proposal was promptly rejected by U.S. officials as a
propaganda ploy. The State Department said some 70 SS-20s were
deployed after a similar moratorium was announced by the late Soviet
President Leonid Brezhnev three years ago.
According to U.S. estimates, the Soviets have 414 deployed SS-20s,
about 100 of them targeted on Asia. The NATO countries are installing
new U.S. Pershing 2 and cruise missiles as a countermeasure.
Japanese firms told to hike imports
TOKYO — The foreign trade minister summoned top executives of
60 leading Japanese companies yesterday and asked them to submit
plans by mid-May for increasing imports.
The unprecedented move by Keijiro Murata came two weeks after
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasonc announced measures to open
Japan's markets to foreign goods. Nakasone also asked the people to
buy more imports in an effort to reduce the huge trade imbalance with
the United States and other allies.
Executives "shared the same concern" about the trade crisis, and it
was Murata's impression "that we got a total commitment from the
guests," Shinobu Murai, deputy director of the ministry's International
Trade Administration Bureau, told a news conference after the meeting.
He added, however, that the executives said foreign companies must
improve quality, meet delivery deadlines and set up effective service
operations for consumers if they are to succeed in the Japanese market.
Murata asked that each company appoint a senior executive to lead a
team on imports, prepare a plan by mid-May and submit reports on
results to the ministry.
Japan had a trade surplus of $36.8 billon with the United States last
year and $10.7 billion with the European Common Market, according to
figures from the U.S. Commerce Department and Japanese Finance
Ministry.
Sarney takes over as Brazil's leader
BRASILIA. Brazil — Jose Sarney was declared president yesterday
and said he would carry out the plans of Tancredo Neves, the veteran
politician who died before he could take officc as Brazil's first civilian
president in 21 years.
Neves died in a Sao Paulo hospital Sunday at age 75 after a series of
operations that began hours before he was to be sworn in March 15. His
body was brought to the capital yesterday, carried through thousands of
mourners who chanted his name as the coffin passed.
Congress met in special session earlier yesterday and declared the
presidency vacant, allowing Vice President Sarney. 54, to become chief
of state of Latin America's largest nation.
Neves was a master of Brazilian politics and held offices ranging from
city councilman to ptime minister in a half-century career. The new civil
ian government that he was to have led ended a generation of military
rule that began with a coup in 1964.
U.S. aircraft explodes in Honduras
TEGUCIGALPA. Honduras — An explosion ripped apart a U.S.
military helicopter parked at an airport in northern Honduras, injuring
eight American crew members, a U.S. Embassy spokesman said yester
day.
One man suffering serious back injuries was flown to a U.S. military
hospital in Panama, but the other seven were only slightly injured, said
embassy spokesman Arthur Skop.
The spokesman did not give any reason for the explosion Sunday in a
CH-47 helicopter taking part in the joint U.S.-Honduran exercises
known as Big Pine 111.
Skop also said divers had found the body of one of two U.S. Air Force
fliers who disappeared last week after their AO-37 fighter-bomber
crashed in northern Honduras on a training mission. He did not identify
the body.
