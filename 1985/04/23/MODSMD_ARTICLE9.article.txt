# Senators present Contra plan

WASHINGTON — Senate
Democrats yesterday proposed a
Nicaraguan aid compromise to Presi
dent Reagan under which the United
States would provide $14 million in
humanitarian aid to the Contra rebels
if the insurgents and the leftist Sandi
nista government agreed to a cease
fire.
The plan was discussed at an all
day bargaining session — briefly at
tended by the president — among
several key Senate Democrats, top
White House aides, and senior Senate
Republicans, including Majority
Leader Robert Dole.

By late yesterday it was not clear if
the administration had accepted any
or all of the elements of the proposal
suggested by a broad spectrum of
Senate Democrats.
The proposal comes against the
backdrop of decisive votes on Contra
aid in the Senate and House today.
It would:
• Provide the $14 million for the
rightist Contras, but only if its
delivery can be independently moni
tored.
• Allow the assistance to the Contras
if the Sandinistas refused to
negotiate.

• Cut off the aid to the Contras if
they violate a negotiated cease-fire.
• Require direct negotiations be
tween the United States and the San
dinistas.
• Provide a mechanism for imposing
economic trade sanctions against the
Managua government if the Sandinis
tas refuse to negotiate seriously
toward a peace settlement.
• Relieve the Contras of the obliga
tion to continue a cease-fire if it were
violated by the Sandinistas.
• Provide U.S. help to the Contadora
nations seeking to negotiate a cease

fire if they were successful.
• Encourage the president to ask
Congress for military help for the
Contras and sanctions against the
Sandinistas if the Managua govern
ment refuses over time to agree to a
cease-fire.
Details of the Democratic alterna
tive were released by aides to Senate
Minority Leader Robert Byrd (D-
W.Va.).
Shortly before the meeting, Byrd
said the Democrats "are willing to
compromise, and we hope the presi
dent is willing, too."
