# Soviet leader consolidates power

MOSCOW — Mikhail Gorbachev
yesterday added three men, including
the head of the KGB secret police, to
the ruling Politburo in a move seen as
tightening the new Soviet leader's
hold on the Communist Party
hierarchy.
The appointments were made
public at the regular spring meeting
of the party's Central Committee,
which also announced that the 27th
Communist Party congress will be
held on Feb. 25, 1986.
Gorbachev, 54, became party gen
eral secretary on March 11 after the
death of 73-year-old Konstantin
Chernenko. Yesterday's meeting of
the Central Committee was the first
since Gorbachev assumed party lead
ership.
In an address to the 300-plus mem
bers of the policy-setting body, Gor
bachev said the United States had
demonstrated in the first round of the
Geneva arms talks that it does not
want an agreement. He accused the
Reagan administration of reneging on
a pledge to discuss a weapons ban in
space.
The Politburo, which at 10 voting
members following Chernenko's
death was at its smallest size in years,
was enlarged to 13.
Throughout the 13 months of
Chernenko's rule, no changes were
made on the Politburo or on the
Central Committee's powerful
Secretariat. 4
The three new full Politburo mem
bers are:
• KGB chief Viktor Chebrikov, 61,

promoted from alternate member
ship;
• Nikolai Ryzhkov, 55, who has a
background in heavy industry and is
chief of the Central Committee's eco
nomic department;
• and Yegor Ligachev, 64, head of
the party department that exercises
control over membership and ap
pointments.
The new Politburo members have
been at nearly all major party and
government meetings on the eco
nomy and ideology that Gorbachev
has attended in recent months.
The appointment of Ryzhkov and
Ligachev was significant because
Politburo members usually serve a
term as alternates first. Foreign Mini
ster Andrei Gromyko, in 1973, was
the last non-alternate to become a
full member.
The official Soviet news agency
Tass, which announced the new ap
pointments, also said 56-year-old
Viktor Nikonov, agricultural minister
for the Russian republic, had been
named to the Secretariat.
Nikonov was named to oversee the
farm sector of the country's largest
and most agriculturally important
republic on Jan. 28, 1983, after
Andropov came to power.
Tass did not say what responsibili
ties Nikonov will have, but it was
assumed Gorbachev brought him in
to oversee agriculture. Some Western
observers believe a portfolio on the
Secretariat carries more authority
over the day-to-day operations of a
given sector than does membership
on the Politburo, which meets once a
week.
