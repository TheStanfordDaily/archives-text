# Reagan advises budget 'backbone'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President
Reagan said yesterday that
Congress should "stop making
excuses and start showing some
backbone and leadership" by ap
proving a politically hazardous
budget plan limiting Social Secur
ity increases and killing some
popular spending programs.
Arguing that Amtrak subsidies
and the Job Corps should be ter
minated along with other pro
grams, Reagan declared, "We can
no longer afford to finance every
thing."
Reagan addressed the annual
meeting of the National Associa
tion of Realtors in the opening
salvo of a lobbying campaign for
congressional approval of a plan
intended to shrink the federal def
icit below $100 billion by 1988
without raising taxes.
The audience of several
thousand real estate brokers
cheered and applauded the presi
dent repeatedly and promised to
urge Congress to vote for the plan
endorsed by Reagan and Senate
Republican leaders.
Reagan readily acknowledged
that passage of the budget "will
not be easy to get through the po
litical process." He said lobbyists
representing various interest
groups "are out in force," working
with sympathetic members of
Congress to substitute tax in
creases for budget cuts.

The Senate opens debate on the
budget package today, and
Reagan will make an address on
the budget from the Oval Office
tonight.
Republicans and Democrats
alike are drafting amendments to
save some of the more than a
dozen programs targeted for ex
tinction or soften the blow aimed
at a longer list of projects in line
for deep cuts or spending freezes.
Reagan's plan also will have to
compete with comprehensive al
ternative budgets containing tax
increases and a one-year freeze in
Social Security benefits for all but
low-income recipients.
Reagan's plan would curb the
increase in Pentagon spending tc 3
percent after inflation. Reagan
called that a "rock bottom level"
and said, "We can no longer af
ford to use defense spending as a
whipping boy for the failure of
Congress to make the necessary
reductions in our domestic spend
ing."
The plan also would limit Social
Security increases to 2 percent for
each of the next three years —
which is less than the 4 percent ex
pected boost in inflation. Any in
crease in inflation over 4 percent
would be matched by higher
benefits.
Another part of the package
contains $18 billion in Medicare
savings and beneficiary increase*
over three years.
