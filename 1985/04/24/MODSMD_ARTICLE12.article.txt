Watergate figure dies
WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. — Former Sen.
Sam Ervin, the self-styled "country lawyer"
whose homespun humor, animated eyebrows and
love of the Constitution made him a folk hero
when he presided over the Senate Watergate
hearings, died of respiratory failure yesterday.
He was 88.
"The cause of death was attributed by his doc
tors to respiratory failure which developed
during the day," said Roger Rollman, a spokes
man at Winston-Salem's North Carolina Baptist
Hospital. "The kidney failure for which Mr. Er
vin was admitted to the center was a significant
contributing factor in the death."
During his 20 years in the Senate, Ervin was
both a critic of civil rights legislation and a cham
pion of civil liberties. He fought affirmative ac
tion proposals, battled efforts to return prayer to
public school, and exposed military surveillance
of anti-war protesters and other dissenters during
the Vietnam War era.
That independence made him a natural choice

when Senate leaders cast about for someone to
chair the sensitive and potentially explosive
hearings on Watergate in the summer of 1973.
To the North Carolina Democrat, the scandal
that led to the resignation of a president was the
biggest tragedy to befall the nation since the Civil
War.
"In the Civil War, there were many redeeming
features of sacrifice and valor displayed on both
sides," he said. "But there was no sacrifice or
spirit of sacrifice, or no valor, really, displayed on
the part of those responsible for the Watergate
hearings, except to sacrifice their character."
Is Coke still it?
NEW YORK — Coca-Cola Co. announced
with much hoopla yesterday that it is changing
the secret flavor formula for Coke, its flagship
product for 99 years and the world's best-selling
soft drink.
Executives were cagey at a news conference
about whether the new product is sweeter
tasting, possibly to avoid embarrassment over

claims in a recently canceled advertising cam
paign that Pepsi was sweeter and, therefore, not
as good as Coke.
"You can't measure sweetness," said Robert
Goizueta, chairman and chief executive officer of
the Atlanta-based company.
Stocks rise broadly
NEW YORK — Stocks rose broadly yester
day, triggered by a late rally in the blue chips that
lifted the Dow Jones industrial average to its
highest level in nearly seven weeks.
Financial, auto, paper and retail issues also
paced the gainers, and most computer stocks
rebounded from their recent drubbing.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose
12.15 to 1,278.71, its best gain since March 19,
when it climbed 21.42. Tuesday's rise also lifted
the average to its highest level since it stood at
1,280.37 on March 6.
Advances led declines 3 to 2 on the New York
Stock Exchange, whose composite index rose
0.63 to 105.43.
