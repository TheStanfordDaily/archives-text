PSA jetliner engine fails
SAN DIEGO — An engine failure shortly
after takeoff yesterday forced a Pacific Southwest
Airlines jetliner to abort its flight to Phoenix and
return to Lindbergh Field, where it landed safely,
authorities said.
One of the DC-9's two engines failed after the
plane was airborne for a few minutes. The plane,
with 60 passengers aboard, landed safely af9:l6
a.m., airport tower chief Jim Dea said.
"It was an engine failure and it shut down,"
PSA spokesman Bill Hastings said. "As far as the
specifics as to why the engine shut down, we
won t know for some time until after the mainte
nance people go through the engine."
There were no reports of panic among the pas
sengers on the plane, which landed within sight of
emergency vehicles that had been put on alert as
a precaution, Hastings said.
Animal activists arrested
BERKELEY — Nine people protesting the
use of animals in research experiments were ar
rested yesterday for investigation of blocking a
public entrance to a UC laboratory.
UC-Berkeley campus police arrested the

members of the Animal Rights Direct Action
Coalition after warning them three times to dis
perse the protest outside Tolman Hall, which
houses laboratories for the psychology depart
ment, a university spokesman said.
They were cited and released by police, and
are scheduled to be formally charged and ar
raigned in May.
According to protest spokeswoman Betsy
Swart of San Francisco, the coalition was joined
by "Punks for Pets" in an effort to publicize a na
tional campaign to stop using animals in research.
Wednesday has been labeled "World Day For
Laboratory Animals."
The Tolman Hall group was critical of what it
called Berkeley's "consistent violations and
abuses" of federal and professional codes
governing animal experimentation in the 18 re
search centers on the campus that use animals.
Diablo test gets OK
WASHINGTON — The Nuclear Regulatory
Commission gave the go-ahead yesterday to start
up the secorid reactor at the $5.4 billion Diablo
Canyon nuclear plant for low-power testing.
On a 4-1 vote, the commission approved the
low-power license for 1.1 million-kilowatt West

inghouse reactor after the agency's top safety
regulators called it "one of the cleanest plants
we've seen."
Commissioner James Asselstine dissented,
saying he has the same problems he had last sum
mer when he cast the lone vote against allowing
the Unit 1 sister reactor at the plant to operate.
Asselstine said the commission has still failed
to address the "complicating effects" an
earthquake near the San Luis Obispo plant might
have on evacuating residents from a 10-mile area
around it in the event of a radiological accident.
The plant is located near an earthquake fault just
off the Pacific Coast.
DarreH Eisenhut, deputy director of the NRC's
ice of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, said the
plant meets all fire protection, environmental
qualification guidelines and new regulatory
criteria implemented after the 1979 accident at
the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania.
We re comfortable that the plant meets all
the design requirements," Eisenhut said. "This is
the cleanest low-power license that I can recall
since TMI."
Today's weather
Continued warm and sunny, with highs in the
70s and lows in the 50s.
