## A 						new and better way to diagnose diseases? 
### PATRICK UN Editorial staff 
Within the next five years, the use
of recombinant DNA technology may
radically change the way infectious
diseases are diagnosed, according to
Stanley Falkow, chairman of medical
microbiology at the medical school.
The traditional, time-honored
method for diagnosing diseases is a
laborious and time-consuming
process. Samples from patients must
be grown in laboratory cultures, and
then the microorganisms must be
analyzed by various tests.
The procedure takes at least a day
because growing the cultures could
take anywhere from overnight to
several days.
Recombinant DNA technology,
however, may soon make it possible
to make diagnoses within hours and
circumvent the need for growing
cultures.

The new technique relies on a
process known as DNA-DNA
hybridization. Essentially, it employs
cloned genes of microorganisms as
probes to detect and identify the
pathogens.
DNA is a double-stranded
molecule wound in a double-helix.
The two strands each contain a series
of bases, and genetic information is
encoded by the sequence of these
bases.
When DNA is heated, the double
helix melts and the two strands dis
sociate from each other.
DNA-DNA hybridization occurs
when the heated DNA is cooled. As
this happens, the single-stranded
DNA molecules find their partners
and "hybridize" to reform the
double-helices.
Hybridization is a highly specific
process. Single-stranded DNA from

one gene generally will not bind to
single-stranded DNA from another
gene.
The reason for such specificity is
that binding of the strands occurs be
tween the bases. The sequence of
these bases are unique for every gene.
If two DNA strands were from differ
ent genes, the sequences would not
match and the strands would not form
a double-helix.
To exploit hybridization for
diagnosing diseases, DNA clones are
needed of genes carried by microor
ganisms. In particular, clones of genes
that enable a microorganism to cause
diseases are needed.
These cloned genes must be
labeled in order to be used as probes.
That is, they must be made radioac
tive so that they can be detected.
Once a labeled probe is available,
detecting the presence of disease
causing bacteria is fairly straightfor
ward. One obtains a sample of
mucous, for example, from a patient
and extracts all the DNA from that
sample. The DNA is heated to melt
the double-helices, and a single
stranded, labeled DNA probe is
added to the mixture.
As the mixture cools, the radioac
tive probe would hybridize to bac
terial DNA, and the sample would
become radioactive. Any radioactive
probe that does not hybridize can be
washed out of the sample.
The hybridization procedure is a
fairly standard laboratory technique
and it is known to be very accurate
and sensitive. In addition, it can be

performed within a matter of hours
and thus holds a distinct advantage
over the traditional method of diag
nosis.
According to Falkow, the fact that
the old method takes a day or more is
becoming less and less desirable.
"There is a big tendency now to try
to diagnose infectious agents in the
clinical material, " he said.
There are two new ways that a
rapid diagnosis can be achieved. One
involves DNA-DNA hybridization,
and the other employs highly specific
monoclonal antibodies, Falkow ex
plained.
While both are accurate and
sensitive, the antibody approach may
suffer a drawback, he said. A mutant
bacteria, which carries a small change
in a gene, may be structurally differ
ent from wild-type bacteria and may
escape detection by antibodies.
Such a mutation would not affect
DNA-DNA hybridization, however,
and in this respect hybridization holds
an advantage over antibodies.
In Falkow's laboratory, a number
of disease-causing genes have been
isolated and cloned from pathogenic
bacteria. Such genes include those in
volved in gonorrhea, chlamydia (a
common venereal disease), menin
gitis, cholera, various forms of diar
rhea, and several other types of infec
tions.
According to Falkow, much atten
tion is currently being focused on
chlamydia as possibly the first disease
to be routinely diagnosed by DNA
DNA hybridization.

Chlamydia is a sexually transmitted
disease that is even more prevalent
than gonorrhea, according to Falkow.
In fact, it is the most common infec
tious disease among young, college
age adults, he said.
Consequences of the disease can be
serious. Pelvic inflammatory disease
and sterility can result from the infec
tion.
Currently, diagnosis of the disease
takes four or five days, due to the
long culture period of the bacteria.
However, in a Johns Hopkins study
done collaboratively with Falkow's
group, DNA-DNA hybridization was
able very rapidly to detect the organ
ism in more than 90 percent of the in
fected individuals. Moreover, the
diagnosis was made at a fraction of
the cost of the traditional method.
The rapidity, accuracy and low-cost
of DNA-DNA hybridization has
made it highly attractive for
widespread clinical use.
But, Falkow noted, before people
are willing to use the technique
routinely, a new method would prob
ably have to be devised for labeling
the DNA probes without radioactiv
ity.
A possible labeling scheme would
use enzymes to tag the DNA probes.
The enzyme would be able to induce
a color change or some other detec
table alteration in the sample.
Such schemes, though being tested,
are not yet as sensitive as radioactive
labeling.
While Falkow's laboratory has
produced many cloned genes that can

be used as probes for infectious ma
terial, development of the probes for
clinical use is not being carried out in
his laboratory.
The reason, Falkow explained, is
that the primary goal of his research
is "simply to study how bacteria cause
disease." Cloning disease-causing
genes is more a by-product rather
than the end result of his research.
Thus, development of Falkow's
clones for clinical use is currently
being carried out by private biotech
nology firms.
Already, the probes have been
licensed through the Stanford's Of
fice of Technology Licensing to 13
companies, including a number of
foreign concerns.
The companies are all vying to
develop kits that could be used
routinely by hospitals and clinical
labs. According to Falkow, the first of
such kits is just beginning to appear.
Money generated by licensing
Falkow's clones flows back to the
University, the medical school and
Falkow's department.
While Falkow does not personally
benefit from the licensure of the
clones, he says he is very pleased with
the arrangement with the Office of
Technology Licencing. Because his
laboratory is not actively engaged in
developing the clones for clinical ap
plications, he is glad that private firms
are carrying out this work.
"Grants are public monies," he
said. "One would like to think re
search would find its way back to
public use."

and sensitive. In addition, it can be

performed within a matter of hours
and thus holds a distinct advantage
over the traditional method of diag
nosis.
According to Falkow, the fact that
the old method takes a day or more is
becoming less and less desirable.
"There is a big tendency now to try
to diagnose infectious agents in the
clinical material, " he said.
There are two new ways that a
rapid diagnosis can be achieved. One
involves DNA-DNA hybridization,
and the other employs highly specific
monoclonal antibodies, Falkow ex
plained.
While both are accurate and
sensitive, the antibody approach may
suffer a drawback, he said. A mutant
bacteria, which carries a small change
in a gene, may be structurally differ
ent from wild-type bacteria and may
escape detection by antibodies.
Such a mutation would not affect
DNA-DNA hybridization, however,
and in this respect hybridization holds
an advantage over antibodies.
In Falkow's laboratory, a number
of disease-causing genes have been
isolated and cloned from pathogenic
bacteria. Such genes include those in
volved in gonorrhea, chlamydia (a
common venereal disease), menin
gitis, cholera, various forms of diar
rhea, and several other types of infec
tions.
According to Falkow, much atten
tion is currently being focused on
chlamydia as possibly the first disease
to be routinely diagnosed by DNA
DNA hybridization.

Chlamydia is a sexually transmitted
disease that is even more prevalent
than gonorrhea, according to Falkow.
In fact, it is the most common infec
tious disease among young, college
age adults, he said.
Consequences of the disease can be
serious. Pelvic inflammatory disease
and sterility can result from the infec
tion.
Currently, diagnosis of the disease
takes four or five days, due to the
long culture period of the bacteria.
However, in a Johns Hopkins study
done collaboratively with Falkow's
group, DNA-DNA hybridization was
able very rapidly to detect the organ
ism in more than 90 percent of the in
fected individuals. Moreover, the
diagnosis was made at a fraction of
the cost of the traditional method.
The rapidity, accuracy and low-cost
of DNA-DNA hybridization has
made it highly attractive for
widespread clinical use.
But, Falkow noted, before people
are willing to use the technique
routinely, a new method would prob
ably have to be devised for labeling
the DNA probes without radioactiv
ity.
A possible labeling scheme would
use enzymes to tag the DNA probes.
The enzyme would be able to induce
a color change or some other detec
table alteration in the sample.
Such schemes, though being tested,
are not yet as sensitive as radioactive
labeling.
While Falkow's laboratory has
produced many cloned genes that can

be used as probes for infectious ma
terial, development of the probes for
clinical use is not being carried out in
his laboratory.
The reason, Falkow explained, is
that the primary goal of his research
is "simply to study how bacteria cause
disease." Cloning disease-causing
genes is more a by-product rather
than the end result of his research.
Thus, development of Falkow's
clones for clinical use is currently
being carried out by private biotech
nology firms.
Already, the probes have been
licensed through the Stanford's Of
fice of Technology Licensing to 13
companies, including a number of
foreign concerns.
The companies are all vying to
develop kits that could be used
routinely by hospitals and clinical
labs. According to Falkow, the first of
such kits is just beginning to appear.
Money generated by licensing
Falkow's clones flows back to the
University, the medical school and
Falkow's department.
While Falkow does not personally
benefit from the licensure of the
clones, he says he is very pleased with
the arrangement with the Office of
Technology Licencing. Because his
laboratory is not actively engaged in
developing the clones for clinical ap
plications, he is glad that private firms
are carrying out this work.
"Grants are public monies," he
said. "One would like to think re
search would find its way back to
public use."

Clones of disease-causing genes made in his lab are being developed by
private firms as diagnostic tools.
Within the next five years, the use
of recombinant DNA technology may
radically change the way infectious
diseases are diagnosed, according to
Stanley Falkow, chairman of medical
microbiology at the medical school.
The traditional, time-honored
method for diagnosing diseases is a
laborious and time-consuming
process. Samples from patients must
be grown in laboratory cultures, and
then the microorganisms must be
analyzed by various tests.
The procedure takes at least a day
because growing the cultures could
take anywhere from overnight to
several days.
Recombinant DNA technology,
however, may soon make it possible
to make diagnoses within hours and
circumvent the need for growing
cultures.

The new technique relies on a
process known as DNA-DNA
hybridization. Essentially, it employs
cloned genes of microorganisms as
probes to detect and identify the
pathogens.
DNA is a double-stranded
molecule wound in a double-helix.
The two strands each contain a series
of bases, and genetic information is
encoded by the sequence of these
bases.
When DNA is heated, the double
helix melts and the two strands dis
sociate from each other.
DNA-DNA hybridization occurs
when the heated DNA is cooled. As
this happens, the single-stranded
DNA molecules find their partners
and "hybridize" to reform the
double-helices.
Hybridization is a highly specific
process. Single-stranded DNA from

one gene generally will not bind to
single-stranded DNA from another
gene.
The reason for such specificity is
that binding of the strands occurs be
tween the bases. The sequence of
these bases are unique for every gene.
If two DNA strands were from differ
ent genes, the sequences would not
match and the strands would not form
a double-helix.
To exploit hybridization for
diagnosing diseases, DNA clones are
needed of genes carried by microor
ganisms. In particular, clones of genes
that enable a microorganism to cause
diseases are needed.
These cloned genes must be
labeled in order to be used as probes.
That is, they must be made radioac
tive so that they can be detected.
Once a labeled probe is available,
detecting the presence of disease
causing bacteria is fairly straightfor
ward. One obtains a sample of
mucous, for example, from a patient
and extracts all the DNA from that
sample. The DNA is heated to melt
the double-helices, and a single
stranded, labeled DNA probe is
added to the mixture.
As the mixture cools, the radioac
tive probe would hybridize to bac
terial DNA, and the sample would
become radioactive. Any radioactive
probe that does not hybridize can be
washed out of the sample.
The hybridization procedure is a
fairly standard laboratory technique
and it is known to be very accurate
and sensitive. In addition, it can be

performed within a matter of hours
and thus holds a distinct advantage
over the traditional method of diag
nosis.
