## THE 						STANFORD DAILY Acting on apartheid 
### 
We voted in October'* referendum for the
trustees to divest from Motorola Corp. We see
protests against apartheid happening across the
country. Hut in concrete terms, very little has
happened. The trustees here are dragging their
feet on selective divestment, and protests on
other campuses need our support.
Those who expect University President Donald
Kennedy and the trustees to divest from corpora
tions with business in South Africa should prove
there is support for such a move by attending the
Stanford Out of South Africa (SOSA) rally at
White Plaza at noon today and the subsequent
sit-in.
It is time to stand up against the racial situation
in South Africa, to force the University to divest
ot its embarrassing stocks and to let the world
know we are not satisfied with the status quo in
South Africa and the current policy of con
structive engagement here in the United States.
Divestment here alone, of course, will not
solve the problem, but the noise we make will be
heard on other campuses, in Washington, D.C.,
and even in South Africa, and it will let the world
know that we expect substantive action to tear
down the wall of apartheid,
Hy eurly yesterday evening, SOSA had put
forth only a simple statement of principles. The

group pledges "explicit support for the South
African revolutionary struggle for liberation and
majority iulc," offers to work in solidarity with
other groups and individuals nationwide — par
ticularly those at other college campuses to
achieve total U.S. divestment from South
Africa," calls for "total Stanford divestment"
from companies with business in South Africa,
and plans "to develop a broad coalition that will
be able to take increasingly strong stands in order
to achieve" divestment through "the principles of
active non-violence."
As far as these principles go, they arc worthy of
support. Hy this afternoon, SOSA will have an
nounced a concrete set of demands; whether
those demands - and SOSA's further actions -
are as commendable remains to be seen.
SOSA has begun to do its part to fight apart
heid here. Now it is up to the students and other
concerned members of the Stanford community
to do their part. Will Stanford join in the fight to
stop apartheid? The answer lies with all of us.
If we support today's rally and sit-in, we will
send a message to Stanford's trustees that apart
heid is wrong, and that we will no longer tolerate
the University's support foi it.
It's a hackneyed phrase here, but in the case of
apartheid, we really can make a difference.
