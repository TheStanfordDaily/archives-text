# Stanford should intensify divestment protest
## 
### 
The arrests at I)('-Berkeley have only acted as a
catalyst loi increased enthusiasm and commitment. Ihe
students at Mlko (formerly Sproul) Hall, piotesiiug IJC in
vestments in South Afiica, have been joined by faculty,
workers and community members, Veteran activist Mario
Savin gave them his encouragement; Alice Walker read
ihem poetry; more than 600 longshoremen showed up to
demonstrate solidarity.
I he protest at Berkeley, and similar ones at other UC
schools, is advocating complete divestment from compan
ies that do business in South Africa. One survey indicates
that almost hall of the regents share thai position. Across
the country, students are engaging in direct action to let
theii administrators know that it is no longer acceptable to
participate passively in the apartheid system. There is a
feeling of excitement, of urgency, a sense that things must
change now.
Except at Stanford.
At Stanford, the anti-apartheid movement has been
largely on hold since February, when the trustees an
nounced their response to growing calls for action on
South African investment.
Before this, the movement hail been strong A referen
dum passed by HO percent, calling for immediate divest
menl ftom Motorola Corp., which had been selling equip
ment to the South African police. A sit-in was held in
Hoovei l ower while the trustees met upstairs, to etnpha
si/e the impoitance of making progress on the divestment
issue
Instead, the trustees waffled. They didn't divest from
Motorola; nor did they present a plan for even selective
divestment, let alone the blanket divestituie that most ac
tivists were calling for.
Stanford officials displayed "sympathy" with the posi
tions of apaitheid foes. "I can understand the point of

view thiil argues there should be blanket divestiture," said
William Mussy, vice president in charge of business mid
lintuu'e, "but thr higher goal in this Instance is due process
and objective consideration " To Massy, a "higher goal"
than the ending of apaiilieid is that we don't sell any stuck
hastily.

University President Donald Kennedy agreed thai
divestiture must only be used as a "last resort" so Stau
ford doesn't lose its influence over apaitheid linked com
panics. What sort of influence do we have? Can we make
multinational corporations support majority mle in South
Africa? Real democracy would threaten their interests by
ending the super'-exploitation ol black labor. Western
companies will at most seek reform in South Africa, not
teal change
There is a wai going on ughl now in South Africa. By
investing in the wai economy of the apartheid irgime, we
aie supporting its tight against black liberation. And by
accepting the profits trom the repressive system, we
become as guilty as any Afrikaner,
It should not have come as a surprise that Kennedy

would try to rationalize continued financial involvement
in South Africa. The man has weasled his way out of every
moral dilemma he bus been confronted with, from Hoover
to military research at SI AC. But his rhetorical evasions
should not have derailed the anti-apartheid groups'
demands.

At Stanford, the anti
apartheid movement has
been largely on hold since
February.

1 he ttustees do not want to divest from anything. Some
of them have theii own ties to South Africa, like John
Packard of Hewett* Packard, and William Timken of the
Timken Company, which has refused to sign the Sullivan
principles.
In order to get Stanford to make real progress on
divestiture, there must be continuous pressure. The
damage done to the school's credibility through failure to
take action against apartheid must outweigh the trustees'
own financial interests and institutional inertia.
liie only response from Stanford students to the
demonstrations occurring all over the country has been, so
far, a rather lame call for a boycott of Coke from the
Hlack Student Union. More than this is needed.
Opponents of apartheid should be taking definite steps

against the University for its failure to divest. A sit-in like
the one at Berkeley might be appropriate; it may be more
effective to pressure the University through a mailing to
alumni, urging them to withhold contributions to Stanford
until a responsible investment policy is adopted,
The most important role of leaders in the movement in
to expose the self serving rationalizations of Stanford offi
cials. They are not steps in the right direction; they are at*
tempts to block any real pi ogress, and we have seen this
tactic succeed too well.
The president of South Africa, Pieter Hotha, sees two
types of opposition to his regime. One tries to correct the
"real grievances" of blacks, through superficial reform of
apartheid. The other type is not looking for reform:
"Their goal," Hotha said, "is the destruction of our system
of government and civilized values."
By focusing on the alleged benefits of U.S. capital in
South Africa, Kennedy has put himself in the Botha*
approved camp. The end result of these reforms is Â«
"lutppy apartheid." where tensiuns arc contained enough
to prevent fundamental change. It is the duty of everyone
who wants to sec a free South Africa to put themselve*
firmly in the other camp the camp that wants to dest/of
Botha's government and his "civilized values" of racism
and oppression.
"I would not expect that blanket divestiture would be
on our agenda soon," Massy has said. Me was wrong. The
students of this university are going to put it on the
agenda. Leaders of protests all over the country have
issued a national call for actions for today. I suggest that
we use this day to tell Massy, Kennedy and the trustees
that the time has come for Stanford to sever all connec*
tions with corporations that support apartheid.
