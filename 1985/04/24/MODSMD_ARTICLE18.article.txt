## Support for Contras harms U.S. 
### 
Stephen Debenham's recent column on
Nicaragua is so shot through with misinformation
that it puts me in the quandary of the proverbial
mosquito in the nuilist colony: I don't know where
to start. So I'll limit myself to addressing a few of
his more egtegiously inaccurate and objectionable
statements.
First of all, Debenham delicately describes the
Contras as "less-than-pristine." He leaves the

VIEWPOINT

readei with the impression that they may miss a
shave or chew a plug of tobacco now and again, but
are basically a bunch of regular, fun-loving guys.
A recent issue of the New Yorker presents a dif
ferent, truer picture. It cites detailed, sworn ac
counts of Contra atrocities which two LI S. legal
groups lecently collected from more than 140
Nicaraguans. One of the testimonies describes the
way these "freedom fighters" treated a peasant
who was unlucky enough to fall into theii hands:
"They hung him on a wile fence. I hey opened up
his throat and took out his tongue. Another
bayonet had gone in through his stomach and come
out his back. Finally, they cut oil his testicles."
I'lie New Yorker goes on to say: "No one is
claiming that every Contra soldier has behaved in
this manner, but . .. recent reports have docu*
mentcd a pattern of activity." "I.css-than*
pristine"? I can think of some more appropriate
characterizations for this soil of behavior.
Ol coutse, such conduct is perfectly predictable,
given the tact that the leadership and core ol the
largest Contra group are composed of forntci Na
tional (iuardstnen, these are the guys who, dining
the late 19701, killed close to 30,000 Nicaiaguans,
most ol them innocent civilians. Once a thug, al
ways a thug. Do we really want to entrust the
protection ot IJ.S national security to these fel
lows?
Moreover. Debenham's claim that the Sandinis
tas have been guilty of similar atrocities is just
untrue, whether applied to their pre* or post
rcvolutionary behavior. No human rights group, to
the best of my knowledge, has ever suggested that
Siiiuhnisia conduct (imperfect as it sometimes is) is
even remotely on a pat with that of the National
(tuard and the Contras Such a comparison simply
docs not hold up. The current Nicaraguan govern
ment has one ol the best human lights records in
I atm America (no death penalty, torture, disap
pearances, etc.). The Somo/a regime had one of
the worst.
A little further on. Debenham sagely informs us
that we cannot "afford to wait for inchoate popular
opposition to the Sandinistas to become obvious."
1 be implication here seems to be that U.S.
polie\makers know the interests ol the Nicaiaguan

people better than they themselves do (after all,
more than f>o percent of them voted for the FSI.N
iu last November's elections).
When carried to its logical conclusion, this line ol
thinking leads to the sort of arrogant, con
temptuous attitude expressed in Henry Kissinger's
infamous remark about another elected govern
ment, that of Salvador Allende in Chile; "I don't
see why we should have to sit by and let a country
go Communist because of the irresponsibility of its
people." Needless to say, such attitudes, and the
foreign interventions they generate, are utterly in
compatible with the principles of national
sovereignty and self determination which sup
posedly lie at the heart of U.S. foieign policy.
lint enough of such mushy, fuzzy-headed
moralism. After all, the crux of Debenham's argu
ment is that the curieut Nicaraguan icgime poses a
major threat to I I.S national security, so that ethi
cal concerns rcgaiding oui policy toward that
country are simply a luxury we cannot afford. OK,
Steve, since your heart is so set on haul headed
Kealpolitik, let's talk some.

The current Nicaraguan
government has one of
the best human rights
records in Latin
America.

How plausible is Debenham's central thesis re
garding the Nicaraguan menace? To put it
charitably, not very. We must start by asking whut
exactly genuine U S security interests in Nicaragua
are. I can think of a couple of legitimate ones: (1)
no Soviet bases oi offensive weapons systems, and
(2) stability
On the first point. Nicaragua currently possesses
no such bases oi systems, and there is not a chance
in the world that it will acquire them. There are a
couple of reasons lot this I list of all, the
Nicaraguan government knows very well that the
Reagan administration is just looking lor the
slightest pretext to get rid ol it Oiven that this
awareness has led the Sandinistas to refrain even
from chasing the Contras hack to their bases in
Honduras and Costa Rica, it seems rather far
fetched to imagine that they're conspiring to
smuggle in Russian missiles ami submarines
Second, even if the Sandinistas succumbed to a
sudden suicidal impulse and changed their minds
on this matter, it's cuuallv clcai that the Soviets

would refuse the invitation, calculating that the
risks entailed far outweighed the prospective
benefit!. After all, the Soviets aren't eager to take
unnecessary chances of triggering nuclear war hy
meddling in what they recognize as the U.S. sphere
of influence. And military bases in Nicaragua
would provide them with no significant advantages
they do not already enjoy a* a result of their close
relationship with Cuba,
As for the second point, were it not for the U.S.-
sponsored Contra war, the Nicaruguan govern
ment, with its widespread popular legitimacy,
would be one of the most stable in Latin America.
And one can make a good case that, even with that
war, Sandinista Nicaragua is a good sight more sta
ble than most of its Central American neighbors.
Furthermore, one has to ask if even the achieve
ment of our policy's objective •— the overthrow of
the government of Nicaragua, an eventuality which
at the moment appears exceedingly remote —-
would actually advance our security interests. A
look at the outcome of past "successful" U.S. inter
ventions strongly suggests that the answer is no.
In fact, our toppling of established governments
m, foi instance, Iran, Guatemala and Chile has ac
tually proved counterproductive these countries
are currently much less stable, and our position
with respect to them much less secure, than before
we intervened. There is every indication that the
same would be true in Nicaragua.
I he basic problem with Dcbcnhum's argument is
that lie assumes our national security requires that
we control Nicaragua's Internal affairs. There arc
foui problems with this premise: (I) It's not true —
our legitimate security interests are much more cir
cumscribed; (2) We don't have the right to deter
mine Nicaragua's destiny for it; (3) We lack the
capacity to do so; and (4) In blindly insisting on
doing much more than is necessary and possible,
we manage to jeopardize the genuine national se
curity Interests which we have it in our power to
defend. My founding his argument on this faulty
premise, Debcnham thus winds up prescribing a
course o! action which, in addition to being im
moral, is profoundly destructive of the very na
tional security he professes to be so worried about.
One final comment. It never ceases to amaze me
how people can appoint themselves experts on
Nicaragua without ever having been to the place. 1
strongly urge Debcnham to visit the country. If he
did, he would quickly recognize the absurdity of
branding Nicaragua a totalitarian society, a Soviet
satellite, or a menace to U.S. security. Who knows,
he might even stop playing master strategist long
enough to develop some sensitivity and compassion
toward the people who stand to suffer the conse
quences of the policy he advocates.

way these "freedom fighters" treated a peasant

his throat and took out his tongue. Another

lint enough of such mushy, fuzzy-headed
moralism. After all, the crux of Debenham's argu
ment is that the curieut Nicaraguan icgime poses a
major threat to I I.S national security, so that ethi
cal concerns rcgaiding oui policy toward that
country are simply a luxury we cannot afford. OK,
Steve, since your heart is so set on haul headed
Kealpolitik, let's talk some.

The current Nicaraguan
government has one of
the best human rights
records in Latin
America.

How plausible is Debenham's central thesis re
garding the Nicaraguan menace? To put it
charitably, not very. We must start by asking whut
exactly genuine U S security interests in Nicaragua
are. I can think of a couple of legitimate ones: (1)
no Soviet bases oi offensive weapons systems, and
(2) stability
On the first point. Nicaragua currently possesses
no such bases oi systems, and there is not a chance
in the world that it will acquire them. There are a
couple of reasons lot this I list of all, the
Nicaraguan government knows very well that the
Reagan administration is just looking lor the
slightest pretext to get rid ol it Oiven that this
awareness has led the Sandinistas to refrain even
from chasing the Contras hack to their bases in
Honduras and Costa Rica, it seems rather far
fetched to imagine that they're conspiring to
smuggle in Russian missiles ami submarines
Second, even if the Sandinistas succumbed to a
sudden suicidal impulse and changed their minds
on this matter, it's cuuallv clcai that the Soviets

would refuse the invitation, calculating that the
risks entailed far outweighed the prospective
benefit!. After all, the Soviets aren't eager to take
unnecessary chances of triggering nuclear war hy
meddling in what they recognize as the U.S. sphere
of influence. And military bases in Nicaragua
would provide them with no significant advantages
they do not already enjoy a* a result of their close
relationship with Cuba,
As for the second point, were it not for the U.S.-
sponsored Contra war, the Nicaruguan govern
ment, with its widespread popular legitimacy,
would be one of the most stable in Latin America.
And one can make a good case that, even with that
war, Sandinista Nicaragua is a good sight more sta
ble than most of its Central American neighbors.
Furthermore, one has to ask if even the achieve
ment of our policy's objective •— the overthrow of
the government of Nicaragua, an eventuality which
at the moment appears exceedingly remote —-
would actually advance our security interests. A
look at the outcome of past "successful" U.S. inter
ventions strongly suggests that the answer is no.
In fact, our toppling of established governments
m, foi instance, Iran, Guatemala and Chile has ac
tually proved counterproductive these countries
are currently much less stable, and our position
with respect to them much less secure, than before
we intervened. There is every indication that the
same would be true in Nicaragua.
I he basic problem with Dcbcnhum's argument is
that lie assumes our national security requires that
we control Nicaragua's Internal affairs. There arc
foui problems with this premise: (I) It's not true —
our legitimate security interests are much more cir
cumscribed; (2) We don't have the right to deter
mine Nicaragua's destiny for it; (3) We lack the
capacity to do so; and (4) In blindly insisting on
doing much more than is necessary and possible,
we manage to jeopardize the genuine national se
curity Interests which we have it in our power to
defend. My founding his argument on this faulty
premise, Debcnham thus winds up prescribing a
course o! action which, in addition to being im
moral, is profoundly destructive of the very na
tional security he professes to be so worried about.
One final comment. It never ceases to amaze me
how people can appoint themselves experts on
Nicaragua without ever having been to the place. 1
strongly urge Debcnham to visit the country. If he
did, he would quickly recognize the absurdity of
branding Nicaragua a totalitarian society, a Soviet
satellite, or a menace to U.S. security. Who knows,
he might even stop playing master strategist long
enough to develop some sensitivity and compassion
toward the people who stand to suffer the conse
quences of the policy he advocates.

Stephen Debenham's recent column on
Nicaragua is so shot through with misinformation
that it puts me in the quandary of the proverbial
mosquito in the nuilist colony: I don't know where
to start. So I'll limit myself to addressing a few of
his more egtegiously inaccurate and objectionable
statements.
First of all, Debenham delicately describes the
Contras as "less-than-pristine." He leaves the
