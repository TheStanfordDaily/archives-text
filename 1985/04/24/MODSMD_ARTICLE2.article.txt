# Draw goes on
## But 0001 is gone

Freshman Vera Scekic described her trip to the
Old Union Clubhouse yesterday with an under
stated, "It was fun."
That's where Scekic and 800 other students
lined up for the first day of the 1985 Housing
Draw. Scekic, who reached into the tub and
picked the magical 0001, guaranteed herself and
fellow Twain resident Andrea Rios a spot in
Storey House next year.
"I didn't feel a thing," said Scekic after she
realized what she had just done. "I was more
shocked 10 minutes after I picked the number."
When Scekic turned around to tell her friend
the good news, Rios started jumping up and

Other anxious students flocked to the Club
house in Hawaiian garb, crazy hats and sun

destiny awaiting them in the thin white envelopes

The many uses of the verb "to draw" was the
theme of this year's activities. Once inside, stu

drew from a bathtub (as in "drawing a bath") in
which the numbers were placed.

"We are trying to make it lighthearted," said
Rodger Whitney, assistant dean of Student Af
fairs and director of the Housing Center. "We
want to lessen the severity of what a Draw num

Draw results will be released sometime in mid-
May, Whitney said. The Draw will continue
through Friday.
Prizes such as shampoo and lecture notes are
even being offered for certain draw numbers,
said Deborah Drew, assistant to Whitney.
"There are about 87 different definitions (for
the word draw)," she said. "We are hoping to re
write Webster's."

"We are very pleased so far," Whitney said.
"We didn't have any overwhelming crowds.
People seemed to be understanding the changes
and most people seemed to be pretty suppor
tive." â€¢
"Everyone seemed to be having a good time,"
he added.
Guaranteed and unguaranteed students are
drawing from different pools for the first time
this year. The guaranteed students will choose
from numbers between 0001 and 3,000, the un-

It's unlikely freshmen Suzanne Mercer and Chandra Harris will return to Florence Moore
Hall again next year after drawing in the 600s yesterday. The Draw continues at the Old
Union Clubhouse today.
