## Separated twins expected to lead normal lives 
### PATRICK LIN Editorial staff 
On Saturday, a team of 15 sur
geons, nurses and technicians worked
together for three hours to separate a
pair of Siamese twins at Stanford
Hospital.
The operation went without a
hitch; more smoothly, in fact, than
doctors had anticipated, and the twins
were successfully detached. Doctors
believe that the twins will be able to
lead normal lives.
Siamese twins are a very rare oc
currence. Estimates range from one
in 60,000 to one in 100,000 live
births. In contrast, fraternal or identi
cal twins occur much more often, ap
proximately one in 90 in the United
States.
Siamese twins occur as a deviation
from the normal process that creates
identical twins.
During embryonic development,
the fetus begins as a single cell and
divides repeatedly to form a ball of
cells. Identical twins arise at some
time early in development when the
mass of cells splits, for some unknown
reason, and develops as two separate
masses of cells.
Siamese twins are produced during
the splitting process, when the mass
of cells fails to separate completely.
Thus, when the babies are born, they
are connected by common tissues.
Siamese twins can be connected in
any of a number of ways, and the
severity of the condition can vary
widely. Most commonly, twins are
joined at the chest and abdomen, but
twins joined at the head and the
sacrum have also been described.
The extent of joining can vary
widelv. It may involve just skin, or it

may include bones, muscles and
various organs such as the liver and
heart.
The cause of Siamese twins is, like
the cause of many congenital defects,
largely unknown. However, exposure
to various agents during pregnancy
has been shown to induce conjoined
twins in laboratory animals.
Such agents include radiation, or
ganic chemicals such as acetone, in
secticides and selenium, a toxic ele
ment which has been found in in
creasing amounts in Silicon Valley
groundwater.
Siamese twins can be diagnosed
during pregnancy with ultrasound im
aging, but, according to Dr. Steven
Shochat, the surgeon who led the
operating team at Stanford, it is
sometimes hard to tell with
ultrasound if two twins are joined.
If a mother is diagnosed with
having Siamese twins, they are
delivered by Caesarean section be
cause they can pose a serious danger
to the mother. However, it is possible
to deliver the twins by natural
childbirth because they are often
delivered early, before the babies
have fully matured.
The separation of Siamese twins
pose special problems for surgeons
because "every conjoined twin is dif
ferent," said Shochat.
Approximately three-quarters of
all Siamese twins have a common car
diovascular system, and a large
proportion of these twins — those
with fused hearts — cannot be
severed. According to Shochat, the
babies who have one common heart
usually die very early of severe multi
ple problems.
Of the twins that can be separated

and saved, those with joined livers
are the most difficult to deal with, ac
cording to Shochat.
Thp twins treated at Stanford were
fortunate in having separate hearts
and vascular systems. However, they
were originally believed to have a
common liver, and this would have
posed a difficult surgical challenge to
the operating team.
The doctors found, contrary to
their initial diagnosis, that the babies
were not joined by a common liver,
and this made the operation much
simpler. The twins shared only part of
the sternum, some of their gastroin
testinal tract and some cutaneous
tissues.
According to Shochat, separation
of Siamese twins does not have to be
performed immediately after birth. In
fact, separation could be done at any
time during the twins' lives.
Thus, the separation of the twins at
Stanford was not undertaken until
three weeks after birth. By this time,
doctors knew that the babies were
healthy and stable and could
withstand the separation procedure.
The term "Siamese twins" arose
from a very famous pair of conjoined
twins, Chang and Eng Bunker, who
lived during the 19th century.
Chang and Eng were born to a
Chinese father and a half-Chinese,
half-Siamese mother. They gained
notoriety when they came to the
United States (at which time they
took the name of Bunker) and began
touring with P.T. Barnum.
After amassing a fortune traveling
with Barnum's entourage, they
settled down as wealthy plantation
owners. They married two Virginia
sisters and raised two large families of
10 and 12 children.
