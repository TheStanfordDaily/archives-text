# Lundblade HR does it for Stanford
## Card 9 nips UOP in 10

STOCKTON — For the third time in the
last four games, Stanford had to use the
longball to hold off an outmanned but pesky
opponent.
Last weekend, Toi Cook and Walt Harris
hit homers in the ninth to beat UCLA. Yes
terday at Billy Hebert Field, it was Rick
Lundblade's turn to provide the late-inning
heroics.
Lundblade broke a 4-4 tie with a leadoff
homer to right in the top of the 10th inning,
giving Stanford a 5-4 win over Pacific. The
homer, a line drive off Tiger reliever Darrell
Van Roy, was the senior first baseman's 15th
of the season.
"It was a fastball, low and away,"
Lundblade said. "It wasn't even a strike. I
couldn't believe I hit it that well."
The game started as if it were going to be
more like a blowout than a cliffhanger. After
Pete Stanicek was hit by a pitch, Ruben
Amaro walked, and Mark Davis was safe on
an error. The bases were loaded with no outs,
Lundblade was up and Tiger starter Mat
Snider was in deep trouble.
However, Snider got Lundblade to hit into
a run-scoring double-play. After Mike
Deßenon walked, Walt Harris drove Amaro
across with a single, but Snider escaped, trail

ing only 2-0.
The Cardinal looked ready to deliver the
knockout punch again in the second, but
Snider was able slip it. After Doug Robbins
doubled into the left-field corner, Stanicek
walked and Amaro was hit by a pitch to load
the bases for Davis with one out.
Once again. Snider was equal to the task,
getting Stanford's leading hitter to ground
into an inning-ending double-play. Snider
then settled down, allowing only one hit over
the next four innings.
"Stanford has a good reputation, so teams
may be a little nervous at the beginning of the
game," Stanicek said. "But if you let them off
the hook early, they think, 'These guys aren't
so good,' and their pitcher gets his confidence
and starts throwing strikes."
Even though it was only two runs, the
Cardinal lead looked pretty big, because the
Tigers brought a paltry .239 team batting
average into the game — compared to Stan
ford's .321.
But UOP did manage two runs in the third,
with some help from the Cardinal defense.
With runners on first and second and two
outs, Stanicek couldn't handle Hobie Schultz'
ground ball, allowing a run to score. The error
also gave Jim McCahill a chance to stroke a
game-tying single.
While Lee Plemel and Ugo Colella held the

Tigers in check, the Cardinal finally got to
Snider for a pair of unearned runs in the
seventh. Robbins reached base on an error,
and, with two outs, Davis was hit by a pitch.
Lundblade walked to load the bases, bringing
up Deßenon.
After an extra-base bid hooked just foul,
Deßenon bounced a two-run single up the
middle, giving the Cardinal a seemingly safe
4-2 lead.
But after two batters in the Tiger seventh,
the game was tied again. Marc Rede singled,
then third baseman Vince Brigman lined a
two-run homer to left off Colella.
UOP appeared ready to win it the bottom
of the ninth, but Rick Dietz kept Stanford
alive with a gutsy pitching performance. Bill
Wolsky started the inning with a double down
the right-field line. After Brigman grounded
out, Wolsky was on third with only one out,
and the Cardinal brought the infield in.
It wasn't necessary. With a 2-2 count, Dietz
fanned Bill Waggoner for the second out.
"I've got to have a strikeout there," he said.
"It was a slider, and he swung right over it."
The winning run was still only 90 feet away,
but Dietz got second baseman Perry Manley
to ground weakly to third, sending the game
into extra innings. "I just went after him with
fastballs," Dietz said. "I've been having trou
ble with left-handed hitters lately."
