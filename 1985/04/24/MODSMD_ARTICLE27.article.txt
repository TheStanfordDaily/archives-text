# Stanford rips Long Beach, 9-0
## Netters sweep back into form 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's tennis team lost 13 out of 18
matches this weekend against UCLA and USC, but
that didn't show in yesterday's match against Long
Beach State. The Cardinal took all nine matches
from the 49ers, for its fourth shutout of the year.
Long Beach is currently ranked 17th in the
country. Stanford is ranked No. 1 with a 5-3 Pacific
10 Conference record, but after consecutive losses
to No. 2 USC and No. 4 UCLA, the Cardinal ex
pects a move down in the next Intercollegiate Ten
nis Coaches Association poll.
The trip to Los Angeles was all but forgotten
yesterday. Everything seemed back to normal. Not
only were Stanford's singles in 6-0 form, but some
earlier doubles teams that haven't played together
for weeks were put back together by Coach Dick
Gould.
The No. 1 doubles team of Jim Grabb and John
Letts received most of this attention, as they have
not played as a team since the match against New
Mexico on March 8.
Grabb and Letts have nevertheless continued to
post high rankings in the coaches' poll and are cur
rently third in the nation behind USC's Jorge
Lozano and Todd Witsken and a doubles team

from Georgia.
Against Long Beach, Gould played Grabb and
Letts at No. 1, Dan Goldie and Eric Rosenfeld at
No. 2, and Scott Moody and Mark Jacobson at No.
3. Those teams represent three of four doubles
pairs Stanford is sending to the Pac-10 Individual
Championship this weekend at Ojai.
"These teams haven't played together for a
while, and this is a good chance for them jto get
some practice in," Gould said.
Pat McEnroe and Derrick Rostagno, Stanford's
regular No. 2 doubles team, will also be going to
Ojai.
"We didn't play (against Long Beach) because
Derrick and I have been playing together and regu
larly for a long time now," McEnroe said. "I think
we're just getting a rest."
McEnroe didn't get a rest from singles competi
tion, however, where in the No. 4 position he
defeated Craig Miller 6-2, 6-1. McEnroe has been
Stanford's most consistent singles player in the last
month and a half, according to Gould.
"I think Patrick has won something like 14 out of
his last 15 matches. He definitely has the best
record on the team in our recent matches," Gould
said.
Gould was especially pleased with the way his

top freshman recruit played against UCLA and
USC. McEnroe was more modest about being the
only Stanford player to win two singles matches all
weekend.
"I played all right, not great. I was able to come
out on top of a couple tough situations, though, and
that was good," McEnroe said. "Against USC, I
was down 5-2 in the third set and I came back to
win the match. That tied the singles at three-all,"
he said.
Stanford couldn't hold on to two of the next
three doubles matches against USC, however, and
suffered its third loss of the season.
Yesterday, McEnroe was "happy" again with his
playing, but his victory was followed with the news
of his housing Draw number — a number he is ad
mittedly not too proud of. "Fortunately I found out
(what my number is) after my match. I doubt 2,700
will get me in the Suites," he said.
At No. 1 singles, Goldie won a three-set match
against the No. 42-ranked player in the country,
Peter Smith. Smith said Goldie played well, but
only when he had to.
"It was 4-4 in the second set (Smith won the first
set 6-4) and he just started to hit winners," Smith

Patrick McEnroe's excellence on the tennis court — he beat the 49ers'
Craig Miller yesterday, 6-1, 6-2 — was not rewarded in the housing
Draw. He found out after his match that his Draw partners had picked
2,700.
said. Goldie did not let up in the third
set, breaking service in the second
game and taking the final set 6-1.
"That first break in the third set
took a lot out of my momentum. I
panicked in my next service game. 1
rushed my serve and all my shots,"
Smith said.
Smith was not pleased when he
walked off the court, either. He ques
tioned Goldie's match-point call on a
supposedly long baseline shot.
"I'm a little disappointed. He
cheated me on the last point. The
crowd thought [my shot] was good
but I guess he just wanted to get off
the court," Smith said.
Stanford's No. 2 player, Jim
Grabb, was probably more ready to
get off the court after his match than
Goldie was. Grabb defeated Scott
Booth, 6-3, 4-6, 7-6. The score in the
third set tie-breaker was 10-8.
"Jim played a good match, but he
has gotten into this habit of taking a
nap during the middle of the second
set. He can't do that," Gould said.
