# Ivan quits tennis team

### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Freshman Anna Ivan's "indefinite"
suspension from the Stanford
women's tennis team became a per
manent one Monday when Ivan offi
cially quit the team and was granted
an unconditional release from her
scholarship obligations.
Ivan's mother and legal adviser met
with Stanford Athletic Director Andy
Geiger briefly Monday afternoon, in
forming him of Ivan's intentions and
requesting that he release her schol
arship. Geiger obliged, and the
highly touted Ivan's tennis career at
Stanford came to a sudden end.
Women's Tennis Coach Frank
Brennan suspended Ivan last Satur
day morning, just hours before the
team played — and defeated — No.
1-ranked USC. Brennan said he
made his decision to suspend Ivan
"indefinitely" Friday afternoon, but
was unable to reach her until the next
morning.
Brennan would not give the reason
for the suspension Saturday, but of
fered more details Monday evening,
when Ivan was off the team officially.
Brennan said that he based his deci
sion on a number of "little things"
and not one or two major incidents.
"She had trouble adjusting to the
team atmosphere here," Brennan
said. "She's a great player and has a
lot of potential. But she just couldn't
work it out with the team, and the
team concept is very important here.
"I don't think she ever adjusted,"
he continued. "She came in in Octo
ber and she really just never adjusted.
She has a tremendous future, if she
finds where that future is."
Ivan, who many considered the top
recruit in the country last year, said
she hasn't decided where that future
will be, although she does plan to
finish out the school year at Stanford.
"I haven't decided what I'm going
to do in the next few years," Ivan
said. "The dust hasn't settled yet, and
I haven't had a chance to sit down
and look at all the options."
Ivan has three main options: She
can remain at Stanford for academic

purposes, although she would not be
on scholarship; she can transfer to an
other school, where she could play
tennis next season without sitting out
a season or losing a year of eligibility;
or she could turn professional.
"It's been a long-term goal of mine
to finish school first," said Ivan, who
noted that she has already been con
tacted by a few other schools. "As of
now, I plan to stay in college for a full
four years."
Ivan, who grew up in Palo Alto and
attended Palo Alto High School, said
quitting had been in the back of her
mind for some time, and when Bren
nan hit her with the suspension, she
did not hesitate.
"Things have not been going well
since January," she said. "It's not a
spur of the moment decision of mine
to quit. I'd been thinking about it for
a long time.
"What more for me was there to
do?" she continued. "I could have
waited for him to ask me back, but I
would have been treated the same
way. It was going to come down to
that (quitting). I'm surprised I didn't
quit in January."
Ivan's complaints centered almost
exclusively around Brennan. She said
she "wasn't pleased with the way he
treated me."
"Frank told me to change my per
sonality," she said. "He told me that
twice. I thought he wanted to.control
more of my life than I wanted him to,
as far as my free time and who I so
cialized with. I didn't think he should
get into my personal life that much."
Brennan, when contacted last
night, refused to comment further on
Ivan, saying, "We perceive the situa
tion differently. I don't expect her to
agree with us."
Geiger called the differences be
tween Ivan and Brennan "a misun
derstanding."
Senior team captain Linda Gates
said that the loss of Ivan would be a
rallying point for the team. "It's
probably to her advantage and to our
advantage," Gates said. "The team
was in constant question about

whether or not she would be ready to
play.
"But with her being out now, I
think the team is forced to pull to
gether more to raise the level of
play."
Ivan's problems began in January
when she refused to practice with the
team for more than two weeks. "I

took two weeks off because of things
that had built up," Ivan explained. "I
thought it was time to take some time
off and evaluate things. But after
that, nothing seemed to click to
gether."
Brennan said he had hoped
