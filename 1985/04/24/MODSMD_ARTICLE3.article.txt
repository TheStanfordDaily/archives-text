# Students set campus sit-in
## Apartheid rally in White Plaza 
### MARK LAWRENCE Staff writer 
As part of a nationwide day of
protest against apartheid, Stanford
Out of South Africa (SOSA) expects
300 to 500 students to participate in a
sit-in today outside University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's office to urge
Stanford to divest of all companies
that do business with South Africa.
The sit-in will follow a noon rally in
White Plaza and is scheduled to last
until 5 p.m. But representatives
conceded late last night that the
protest may last into the night.
"It could last longer, depending on
a number of factors including the
response we get from administration
and the Board of Trustees," said Bill
Cohn, a spokeman for the Coalition
Against Apartheid here.
Steve Phillips, chairman of the
BSU, said organizers are are not ad
hering to any strict plan.
"We will assess the situation at 5,"
said Phillips.
Following a meeting late last night,
SOSA revealed its specific demands

of the University:
• Total divestment of stock in any
company operating in South Africa,
begining with immediate divestment
of stock in Hitachi Corp. and
Motorola Corp.
• A public forum next week to discuss
strategy for total divestment.
• Disclosure of personal investment
portfolios of all board members and
the vice president for business and
finance.
Kennedy has stated emphatically in
the past that he does not support
"blanket," or total, divestment. Both
Kennedy and William Massy, vice
president for business and finance,
say that "selective divestment" on a
case-by-case basis, is the only fair ap
proach.
Alice Stauffer, a spokesperson for
SOSA and a member of the Stanford
Central American Action Network
and Students Against Reaganism,
said she anticipates that the Univer
sity "will respond in one way or an
other — they're pretty worried about
this." Stauffer said she expects the
protesters "to make the commit
ment" to continue the sit-in after 5
p.m. if the demands have not been
met.
"People are realizing that students
can make a difference. I think there is
a lot of sentiment" for the rally and
sit-in, Stauffer said.
Cohn acknowledged that protesters
might be arrested, saying it is "not
impossible."
But he stressed that the group "will
be adhering to a principle of non
violence" throughout the sit-in.
The noon rally will include
speeches by Phillips, Stauffer and
Mwesiga Baregu, an undergraduate
from Tanzania, as well as statements
of solidarity from several campus or
ganizations involved in SOSA.
SOSA was formed Monday night at
a meeting of about 80 "concerned in
dividuals" and representatives of
campus organizations, partly in
response to a statement calling for "a
national day of protests and strikes
against apartheid" issued jointly by
groups at Columbia University, UC-
Berkeley, UC-Santa Cruz, Cornell,
Rutgers and the University of Wis

consin.
Stauffer said that there was talk of
a protest at Stanford before the state
ment was issued, however.
Stanford joins a growing number of
universities and colleges holding anti
apartheid protests and sit-ins.
At Columbia, where an "average
of 100 to 150" student protesters
have been sitting in since April 4, it is
unclear whether the protest will end
tomorrow, as was reported earlier,
said Chris Dwyer of the Columbia
Daily Spectator.
Danny Fass, a spokesman for the
Coalition for a Free South Africa at
Columbia said the protest there is
"escalating to other things." He
added that any decision to end the sit
in was made independently of a court
order to end the barricade of Hamil
ton Hall because of the potential fire
hazard.
The protesters plan to leave the
blockade tomorrow at noon and
march to a Harlem church, where
they will participate in a voter
registration drive as part of a city
wide anti-apartheid rally, Fass said.
At UC schools, anti-apartheid
protesters occupied an administration
building in Los Angeles and contin
ued a Berkeley sit-in yesterday as stu
dents at other campuses geared up for
a strike today to protest UC invest

ments in South Africa, according to
the Associated Press.
"It's peaceful right now. 1 think the
plans are to allow them to stay as long
as it remains peaceful," UCLA
spokesman Stuart Wolpert said last
night of the occupied building. He es
timated that between 170 and 200
students were occupying the first
floor hallways of the administration
building, promising to stay the night.
In Berkeley, meanwhile, about 75
professors marched to the UC admin
istrative offices yesterday to present a
petition signed by about 110 faculty
members.
Today, Berkeley President David
Gardner will meet with students and
several labor organizations at a forum
in Berkeley's 7,000-seat Harmon
Gymnasium.
UC students in Irvine, San Diego
and Berkeley also scheduled all-day
class boycotts and teach-ins, spokes
men said.
At Cornell, protesters are in the
fourth day of a sit-in at that school's
main administration building, Day
Hall. According to Leslie Postal, a
reporter for the Cornell Daily Sun,
students are staying in the building
each day until it closes, at which time
they are arrested.
Last Thursday, the first day of the
Cornell protest, 144 students were

arrested. One hundred ninety were
arrested on Saturday, 211 on Monday
and 130 yesterday. Those arrested
yesterday include 13 faculty members
and one assistant dean.
Postal said she feels the protest will
go on until the university divests, but
she said that the number of protesters
"may dwindle" because students ar
rested three times face suspension, a
fate which most are not willing to
risk.
Yesterday, 250 faculty members
signed and submitted a petition ur
ging divestment by the university.
At Rutgers, where a sit-in has been
going on since April 12, 5,000 stu
dents rallied yesterday in protest of
that school's investments in South
Africa, according to Dave Pettit,
news editor for the Daily Targum.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson attended the
rally and met with University Presi
dent Edward Bloustein for 30
minutes.
Pettit said Bloustein, who was ar
rested himself for demonstrating
against apartheid in New York in
January, will stand by his decision to
partially divest, explaining that the
University cannot take a moral stand
on issues at the expense of educa
tional quality.
