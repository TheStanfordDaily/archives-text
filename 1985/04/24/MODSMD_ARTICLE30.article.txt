# Frosh standards to be lowered?

NEW YORK (AP) — College
officials say a plan for stricter aca
demic standards for freshmen, ap
proved by the NCAA two years
ago, likely will be modified be
cause it would prevent too many
blacks from getting scholarships.
The New York Times yesterday
said critics of the plan cited a study
which showed that nearly 80 per
cent of black male college athletes
entering school in 1977 and 1982
would fail to meet the new stand
ards. Among white male athletes,
40 percent would not meet the
standards, the study showed.
The Times said the plan's critics
included some presidents of black
universities and many coaches.
It said that while they are not
opposed to higher academic stand
ards for athletes, the proposal
should be changed so that blacks
would not suffer disproportionate
consequences.
"We have never been against
standards, but our position is that
there must be revisions," Joseph
Johnson, president of predom
inantly black Grambling State in
Louisiana, told The Times.
Johnson belongs to a seven
member committee established by
the NCAA to study the new stand
ards scheduled to take effect next
year. The committee will meet in
Chicago starting today. Proposed
changes would be forwarded to
the NCAA for consideration next
January, the last scheduled full
meeting before the rules take ef
fect.
The plan's supporters, including
many college presidents and the
American Council on Education,
said they would go along with
some changes.
"There is a substantial defect in
it because it fails to recognize aca
demic disparity," NCAA Council

president Robert Atwell told The
Times.
As for easing the standards, At
well said yesterday from his Wash
ington office, "We want to modify.
We don't want to emasculate."
He warned that a watefed-down
version "would be a travesty, a
denial of everything we're trying
to do to protect the high-risk stu
dent from the ravages of intercol
legiate sports."
The council represents 1,500
colleges and universities.
The standards would require a
grade-point average of at least 2.0,
of a possible 4.0, in 11 college
preparatory courses, scores of a
combined 700 on the Scholastic
Aptitude Test, or 15 on the Amer
ican College Testing exam.
Failure to meet those standards
would make an athlete ineligible
for competition in his freshman
year. The practical effect of the
rule, officials told The Times, is
that most colleges would not offer
scholarships to ineligible individ
uals.
Most opposition centers on the
test score requirement, with some
officials maintaining that the stan
dardized tests do not reflect the
cultural and educational back
ground of most blacks, especially
those who are poor.
Traditionally, blacks have
scored far lower on the tests than
whites, and some officials — par
ticularly the heads of black col
leges, the Times said — want to
drop the test score requirement or
use it as an alternative to the
grade-point average requirement.
The education council, for one,
wants to retain the test score re
quirement, but is willing to modify
the rule so that students who do
poorly on the test can retain
eligibility if their grade point
average exceeds 2.0 by a sufficient
amount. 1
