# Pac-10 umps coping well with abuse
## 
### JENNIFER KOCH Staff sportswriter 
They may be regarded eilhei enemies or
assets to u baseball team. They may be
blamed for a loss or criticized for ttn un
popular decision on a clone cull. And for more
than 100 years, they have been the subject of
relcntleHM abuse from fans, players and
coaches alike.
So why do umpires s»t«y with the job?
Jack Kunkel, one of the three umpires at
Stanford'* three-game series against UCLA
last weekend, sums up the unswer in four
words; "love of the gume."
Kunkel and his partners — Tony Hatch and
Kevin Oillmore — said they have become ac
customed to abuse from the crowd and are
able to ignore the comments because the
crowd doesn't concern them as part of the
game. Nevertheless, according to Patch, one
of the most frustrating aspects of his job is
hearing unnecessary comments directed at
him by fans who don't understand the game.
Oillmore, the youngest member of this
crew, also admitted to occasional frustration
with the fans, "We're supposed to start per
fect and get better," he said.
The umpires don't appear overly concerned
about criticism from the player* themselves.
"The players are very good, overall," said
Kunkel, who is not related to Stanford pitcher
Kevin Kunkel or major league umpire Hill
Kunkel. "They are building up frustration,
and who better to take it out on than us? We
know the players are competitive, and we ac
cept that."
Kunkel went on to explain that he believes
that a player is generally a reflection of his
coach. In that respect, he feels that it is esscn
tially "up to the coach" if one of his players is
removed from the game.
In regard to a coach's behavior, Patch said:

"Any abuse is an excuse which has a bearing
on the game." The three umpires agree that
they can accept a coach's criticism if he says
what he has to say in a short period of time.
(iillmore said that how a coach approaches
the situation determines if he will be taken
from the game. "If he tries to show you up,
shoves you, or uses abusive language, of
which there is usually a key word for each
coach, he will be taken out," he said.
The closer the play an umpire Is forced to
rule on, the more outrage he will face from
the team and the fans. Yet the umpires will
only reverse a call when an appeal is re
quested. "You have to run the play through
your own mind. If you say you'll never make a
mistake, that's crazy, You have to live with
your mistakes the same as ballplayers," Patch
said.
Before Saturday's Stanford UCI.A game,
as the umpires began to change into their
characteristic blue uniforms before the game,
a fan recognized them and stepped over to in
quire about "that call at home plate last
week."
"It was a tough series with a couple of
tough situations," Patch told the fan, referring
to the Cardinal's home series with Arizona.
"You just have to deal with it,"
Kunkel was in full agreement. "We go
home feeling we have done a good job," he
said. "1 have never not been able to sleep at
night after a game."
The ciew of umpires heads toward the field
for the start of another game. Patch pauses
and turns back. He smiles as he explains that
all these players will graduate soon and move
up to another league or stop playing, but
"umpires go on and on, You have to be mild
mannered and ignore the abuse, That's been
baseball for years, and if you stop liking it you
just have to hang it up."
