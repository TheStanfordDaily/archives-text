### 
In its most impressive outing of the
season, the Stanford men's lacrosse
team put the finishing touches Satur
day on an undefeated season by
trouncing Pacific 24-4 in Stockton.
The team's 11-0 record in Western
Collegiate Lacrosse Association play
is the best a Stanford team has done
since 1981-82, when the Cardinal
finished the season with a perfect
record and the California State
Championship.
Paced by John Patrick's six goals
and four assists and John Cox's eight
goals and one assist, Stanford's of
fense overpowered the UOP defense
in every sense of the word.
According to NCAA statistics
released this week, Patrick, who has
now pumped in 32 goals on the year,
is the sixth leading scorer in the na
tion.
With its win Saturday, the Cardinal
will head into this weekend's opening

round of playoff action as the top
ranked team in the Northern Confer
ence. Stanford will host UC-Santa
Barbara Saturday at 1 p.m.
If Stanford wins its opening game,
the team will travel to Whittier on
May 4 to take on a Southern Confer
ence opponent — either San Diego
State or Arizona — with the winner
to advance to the championship game
on May 5.
The league playoff format is
structured so that eight teams — four
from each conference — earn berths.
In the conference playoffs, the top
team plays the fourth seed and the
second and third seeds play each
other. The winners then advance to
face the other conference's top two
teams in the semifinals.
"We've got a good chance of win
ning it all if we play well,'' Stanford
Coach Jim Bedell said. "We've
definitely got the talent."
