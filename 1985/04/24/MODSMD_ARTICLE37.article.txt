# Seniors push CAPS to brink
## 
### TODD RAMMING Senior staff writer 
Deluged with more than 200 cases
per week, the Counseling and Psy
chological Services (CAPS) office
here is wait-listing numerous students
who are not in a crisis situation, ac
cording to Dr. Vincent D'Andrea,
director of CAPS.
"If somebody needs to be seen,
they will be seen," D'Andrea said.
During office hours, one of the 14-
member staff is on first-call and
screens all callers requesting immedi
ate counseling.
A second counselor is available 24
hours a day.
Callers deemed to be in a non-crisis
situation are offered three alterna
tives if an immediate appointment
cannot be scheduled, D'Andrea said.
Students may be placed on a waiting
list, offered brief counseling or given
alternative sources for help. Such
sources include resident assistants,
resident fellows or familiar faculty
members of advisers, he said.
All callers are usually seen, if they
desire, "within the week, or within
two weeks," said Dr. Douglas Daher,
staff psychologist. Waiting periods,
however, can be longer if a caller
places restrictions on which coun
selors he would like to see.
But when appointments are not im
mediately available, "people have
gotten upset and hung up,"
D'Andrea said.
Unable to hire more counselors to
aid in the current deluge, the staff has
responded by making available as
much time as possible per week.
Taking shorter lunch hours, avoiding

optional meetings and other electives,
and scheduling appointments
throughout the day, CAPS staff
members can offer about 245 hours
of counseling per week, D'Andrea
said. The current rate of more than
200 calls per week and backlists of
past callers awaiting appointments
cannot be met in the 245 hours
available, he said.
In order to aid students awaiting
counseling at CAPS, The Bridge, a
service sponsored by CAPS, offers
peer counseling, said David Sherman,
a resident of The Bridge.
Although he considers these situa
tions "always alarming, always trou
bling," D'Andrea said the current
overflow of cases is not unexpected.
Over the last 10 years, the peak per
iod has been from mid-winter quarter
to mid-spring quarter, D'Andrea
said.
"Most people come here because
they are having trouble with a rela
tionship," D'Andrea said. Peaks oc
cur most often after a break, he said,
after people have time "away from
the frenzy of study" when they can
think.
Currently, three psychiatrists, four
psychologists, three social workers,
two residents and two post-doctoral
students staff CAPS. Cutbacks in
funding have eliminated one-and
one-half positions from the service in
the past two years, D'Andrea said.
The deluge of cases is by no means
unique to Stanford. In comparison
with similar services at universities in
this country, Stanford has had a bet
ter track record in handling such a sit
uation, he said.
