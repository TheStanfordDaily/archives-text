# Senate votes to support rally
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate last night called for "all Stan
ford students to participate in the nationwide
protest against apartheid by taking part in a rally
and legal sit-in" to be held here today.
Another resolution giving senate support to "all
efforts by the students of the University of Califor
nia and by the Senate of the Associated Students of
the University of California to bring about divest
ment from companies operating in South Africa"
passed after lengthy debate over the resolution's
wording and intentions.
Graduate Senator Mark Landesmann, co-author
of the resolution supporting today's rally, said the
event would be "perfectly peaceful, perfectly legal
and non-violent."
"We're not telling students to break the law. . . .
There are no plans for illegal activites," Landes
mann said.
Graduate Senator Jon Adelstein, co-author of
the resolution, said that it would be "a real glorious

day for Stanford" when the rally takes place.
But Graduate Senator Jim McGrath opposed the
rally resolution, stating that he could not support
"a blank check" by endorsing an action that could
be perceived as illegal.
The second resolution — backing the movement
for divestment at Berkeley — passed by a 10-4 vote
after a see-saw battle that saw the resolution sent to
committee before being re-accepted for vote on the
floor.
The move to send the resolution back to commit
tee was led by McGrath, who objected that the
resolution had not gone before committee before
coming up for a vote. After lengthy debate at the
conclusion of the meeting, the resolution was voted
back on the floor, with Adelstein stating, "We're
not going to be able to iron out philosophical dif
ferences in committee."
"Don't let the rules prevent us from [doing] what
we want to do," said Council of Presidents member
David Porter, urging the senate to pass both resolu
tions.

The meeting was also marked by the quarterly
state of the senate address by Porter, who called
the performance of the ASSU during the past year
"generally good."
"The system that we have now can be improved
and is not ready to be trashed yet," Porter said. He
particularly praised the business sector of the
ASSU, noting, "We have to highlight this to the
student body."
Porter did acknowledge that the ASSU has a
"definite, definite image problem," saying that the
senate should "take a serious look" at student per
ception of the organization.
Porter said last week's election of the Hammer
and Coffin Slate to the office of Council of Presi
dents "does make a statement about some of the
things the student body is concerned with."
Tim Quirk, who attended the meeting with the
three other members of the H & C Slate, said he
"liked everything (Porter said) up until the last 40
seconds," when Porter said the present structure of
the ASSU should remain intact.
