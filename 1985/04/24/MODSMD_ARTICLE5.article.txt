## Warning on obscene calls 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Staff writer 
The director of Governor's Corner has issued a memo
to residents, resident felllows and resident assistants there
in response to a recent rash of obscene telephone calls.
"Over the last several months, it was reported to me
that women had been getting obscene phone calls," said
Jim Cadena, director of Governor's Corner and assistant
dean of Student Affairs. "There have been enough to
warrant some concern."
Cadena, whose memo is dated April 19, said he became
aware of the problem after residents of Potter House and
Florence Moore Hall began reporting calls winter quar
ter.
Cadena said his memo is intended to "discourage
people who might be doing it," as well as to inform res
idents.
The memo warns callers and prospective callers that

"anyone found making obscene or threatening phone calls
will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law as well as
charged with violation of the Fundamental Standard."
Violation of the Fundamental Standard could result in the
loss of University privileges, according to the memo.
The memo goes on to outline the steps students should
take if they receive obscene or threatening calls.
The Department of Public Safety has been consulted,
but apprehending the culprits is almost impossible,
Cadena said. But according to the memo, Cadena was told
that the police chief and his staff will give "as much assis
tance as possible."
"There isn't a lot [the police] can do with it unless
there's a persistence in the calling," Cadena said. "There
doesn't seem to be a real defined pattern,"
Several students report receiving obscene and harassing
phone calls after their names ap
peared in The Daily.
One senior said the calls began
during winter quarter after her name
appeared in a Daily letter to the
editor.
"I got three obscene phone calls by
some guy who whispers," the senior
said. "He called at 1 in the morning. I
hung up immediately and felt really
angry."
She said she had not received any
calls in the past six weeks.
Another student, a sophomore,
said she received five obscene phone
calls the Friday night after her name
appeared in a Daily article describing
student reaction to the announce
ment that a Playboy photographer
would visit Stanford.
Although she and her roommate
have received about 10 obscene calls
since the beginning of winter quarter,
she believes the first three calls were
"random" events.
She said that the next five calls,
from a person who called himself
"Dave," were directly linked to her
appearing in The Daily.
"They were a specific response to
the Playboy article," the sophomore
said. "The caller said, 'Why don't you
pose for Playboy?' "
The sophomore said the caller
"sounded like somebody who was up
late studying, but was very lucid."
The sophomore added that she and
her roommate received a "violent"
obscene call the next evening and that
they continued to get calls every
Friday and Saturday night until the
end of the quarter.
The calls included three incidences

of "heavy breathing" and obscenity,
she said.
Another student, a junior, also re
ported getting a call from "Dave"
during winter quarter.
"He started by saying 'hi,' and he
told me his name was David," she
said. "He was being really apologetic,
and then he started in with the
obscenities."
The junior said that she did not
think she was being singled out for a
specific reason.
"I assume that he was just picking
random numbers," she said. "He
didn't use our names."
Cadena recommended that stu
dents attempt to note any distinguish
ing characteristics in the caller's voice
and notify the residential staff if they
receive these types of calls.
"We can provide a place where
women can come and talk about
this," Cadena said. "Some people
might feel embarrassed and might not
want to come forward. This can be
quite traumatic to some people."
Cadena's letter recommends three
steps to be taken upon receipt of an
obscene phone call:
"1. Nofity your RA, RF and me
(Cadena); I want to meet with each
person who gets one of these calls.
"2. Write down exactly what was
said.
"3. Note any distinguishing charac
teristic of voice, dialect, speech
rhythm, vocal intensity or inflection;
anything that make the caller's way of
speaking unique."
Cadena said it is difficult to deter
mine whether the calls are malicious
or someone's idea of a joke.
"Whether it's a prank or not, it's
still insidious," Cadena said. "It is not
a joke."
