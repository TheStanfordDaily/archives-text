### MARY YUH Editorial staff 
The woman inadvertantly released
after being charged with abandoning
her baby near Stanford Hospital was
re-arrested yesterday afternoon when
she walked into the Stanford Police
Station.
Betty Ann Johnson entered the
station at approximately 1:40 p.m.
and asked officers to return her
clothes and other possessions that
were being held following her initial
arrest last Tuesday. Johnson. 37, was
promptly arrested on charges of
felony child abandonment and taken
to Elmwood Women's Jail, said Stan
ford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.

Johnson was first arrested last
Tuesday after her newborn baby girl
was found in the back of a pickup
truck in a Stanford Hospital parking
lot. She was transferred that day to
Santa Clara Valley Medical Center,
and two days later moved to
Elmwood. Johnson was released from
Elmwood Thursday in what Stanford
police later called a "mistake."
But according to a clerk at the jail,
no charges had been filed, and by law.
the woman had to be released.
Niemeyer. however, maintains that
charges had been filed ar.l the jail
had been notified.
"It's one of those things, where
something fell through the cracks,"
Niemever said.

Johnson's baby, only four hours old
when found, was born in the brush
behind the mausoleum, according to
police reports. She was taken to Stan
ford Hospital.
The baby was released Saturday to
a temporary foster home following a
Friday decision that classified her as a
court dependent.
A jurisdictional hearing on May 6
will determine whether the baby will
be permanently released to the
mother, placed in a foster home or
put up for adoption. Johnson's pres
ence at this hearing is required, ac
cording to Edwin Hill, the Santa
Clara County deputy probation offi
cer responsible for the case.
