# Admittees swamp hotline
## 
### SCOTT PARKER 
An experimental telephone
hotline, set up by the Office of Un
dergraduate Admissions to allow
prospective freshmen a chance to
speak directly with Stanford faculty
members, was flooded with phone
calls last night during the its final
evening of operation.
"We've had all four lines hop
ping all night," said John Bunnell,
director of freshman admissions. "I
think it's been helpful for all con
cerned," he said.
The faculty hotline was one
facet of Undergraduate Admis
sions' increasing efforts to provide
high school students who were ac
cepted to the Class of 1989 a
chance to learn more about Stan
tees must indicate by May 1
whether they wish to attend Stan
ford.
Prospective freshmen were
notified by mail of time slots during
which they could call the hotline —
collect — and speak directly with a
Stanford professor. Faculty mem
bers volunteered to man the phones
for three hours last night and last
Thursday night.
More than 30 prospective Stan
ford students called the office last
night, some talking for more than
an hour with various faculty mem
bers. Some callers reported having
difficulty getting through.
Last night's deluge provided a
striking contrast to Thursday's ses
sion, during which the response was
underwhelming. In that three-hour
period, faculty members fielded
only six calls, and several volun
teers did not speak to any

prospective students at all.
Faculty members who took calls
said their time was well spent.
"I found it interesting; it's inter
esting to see what people ask," said
James Young, a professor in civil
engineering.
English Prof. Ron Rebholz spoke

for an hour to an admittee who was
deciding between Stanford and
Brown University.
"I enjoyed the conversation with
the student," he said. "If he comes
here, it (the hotline) was definitely
worthwhile," he added.
Questions ranged from the ob
vious — class sizes, overseas oppor
tunities and the quality of teaching
in various departments — to the
more esoteric — "Is Palo Alto the
suburban, boring place it is reputed

to be?" one prospect asked.
The faculty hotline was part of
the Office of Undergraduate Ad
missions' drive to inform
prospective freshmen about Stan
ford. The instructional campaign,
according to Dean of Admissions
Jean Fetter, "is an attempt to allow

students to make the best, informed
decision" on whether to attend
Stanford.
Fetter also pointed to the Pro-
Fro program, which encourages
prospective freshmen to visit the
campus this month and stay in stu
dent residences. While the Pro Fro
program is actually three years old.
this is the first year that the pro
gram is mentioned in admissions
materials.

Keith Light, associate director of
admissions and coordinator of Pro-
Fro, said the program has succeeded
in drawing prospective students to
campus.
" I'II bet you we have twice as many
this year as last, or almost twice,"
Light said. He said approximately
300 prospects participated in the pro
gram last year.
Light said that the Pro-Fro pro
gram was not intended to be a
recruiting effort. "Our purpose isn't
to roll out the red carpet and try to
convince them to come heje, but to
accommodate those who want to
come and see Stanford as it is, from a
student perspective."
Organizers also emphasized that
the hotline was intended to be in
formational, rather than a recruiting
tool. "It's not the practice of Stanford
to urge them to enroll," said Fetter.
"What's important is to give them a
basis to make the best informed deci
sion."
"Some schools are more energetic
than others" in pursuing candidates,
Fetter explained. "Since Stanford is
not like that, our approach could be
perceived as a lack of interest in the
student. We want to avoid that ap
pearance," she said.
The 17,657 applicants to the Class
of '89 topped last year's figure by
more than 2,000. In the past, about
61 to 65 percent of the 2,400 offered
admission to Stanford have actually
enrolled, a "yield ratio" among the
top two or three of private univer
sities nationally. Most of those not
enrolling at Stanford choose other
private universities, with Harvard,
Yale, Princeton and MIT the
favorites.
