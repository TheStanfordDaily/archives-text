# Admittees swamp hotline
## 
### SCOTT PARKER 
An experimental telephone
hotline, set up by the Office of Un
dergraduate Admissions to allow
prospective freshmen a chance to
speak directly with Stanford faculty
members, was flooded with phone
calls last night during the its final
evening of operation.
"We've had all four lines hop
ping all night," said John Bunnell,
director of freshman admissions. "I
think it's been helpful for all con
cerned," he said.
The faculty hotline was one
facet of Undergraduate Admis
sions' increasing efforts to provide
high school students who were ac
cepted to the Class of 1989 a
chance to learn more about Stan
tees must indicate by May 1
whether they wish to attend Stan
ford.
Prospective freshmen were
notified by mail of time slots during
which they could call the hotline —
collect — and speak directly with a
Stanford professor. Faculty mem
bers volunteered to man the phones
for three hours last night and last
Thursday night.
More than 30 prospective Stan
ford students called the office last
night, some talking for more than
an hour with various faculty mem
bers. Some callers reported having
difficulty getting through.
Last night's deluge provided a
striking contrast to Thursday's ses
sion, during which the response was
underwhelming. In that three-hour
period, faculty members fielded
only six calls, and several volun
teers did not speak to any

prospective students at all.
Faculty members who took calls
said their time was well spent.
"I found it interesting; it's inter
esting to see what people ask," said
James Young, a professor in civil
engineering.
English Prof. Ron Rebholz spoke

for an hour to an admittee who was
deciding between Stanford and
Brown University.
"I enjoyed the conversation with
the student," he said. "If he comes
here, it (the hotline) was definitely
worthwhile," he added.
Questions ranged from the ob
vious — class sizes, overseas oppor
tunities and the quality of teaching
in various departments — to the
more esoteric — "Is Palo Alto the
suburban, boring place it is reputed

to be?" one prospect asked.
The faculty hotline was part of
the Office of Undergraduate Ad
missions' drive to inform
prospective freshmen about Stan
ford. The instructional campaign,
according to Dean of Admissions
Jean Fetter, "is an attempt to allow

students to make the best, informed
decision" on whether to attend
Stanford.
Fetter also pointed to the Pro-
Fro program, which encourages
prospective freshmen to visit the
campus this month and stay in stu
dent residences. While the Pro Fro
program is actually three years old.
this is the first year that the pro
gram is mentioned in admissions
materials.
