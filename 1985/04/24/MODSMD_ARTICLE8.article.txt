Soviets deny presence in Nicaragua
MOSCOW — The Soviet Union yesterday denied President Reagan's
claim that Soviet military personnel are in northern Nicaragua, calling it
a provocation that rivaled Nazi propaganda.
Commentaries in the official press said Reagan made the statement in
an effort to get Congress to approve aid for anti-Sandinista rebels. The
official Soviet news agency Tass said Reagan's claim was an attempt to
intimidate Congress.
"Even Goebbels' propaganda experts could envy such a provocative
invention," the Defense Ministry newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda said, re
ferring to Adolf Hitler's propaganda minister, Paul Goebbels. "The in
ventions of the stay of Soviet military experts in Nicaragua are a crude
provocation.".
The Communist Party newspaper Pravda said: "If one is to believe the
United States president, who made a statement about it on the radio Sat
urday, the Soviet Union is busy creating its bridgehead in the American
continent in order to establish 'a whole group of pro-Soviet dictator
ships' and threaten the southern border of the United States.
"In having recourse to such absurd inventions, they are trying to
camouflage the real causes of tensions in Central America," Pravda said.
Pravda said Washington was responsible for unrest in the region.
Reagan said the United States had confirmed the presence of Soviet
military personnel in the "battle zones" of northern Nicaragua.
U.S. officials who elaborated said the Soviets were setting up commu
nications systems that would give the Nicaraguan government advance
knowledge of rebel activity to better react to the rebel offensives.
Kohl blamed for Reagan mix-up
BONN, West Germany — A West German opposition leader blamed
Chancellor Helmut Kohl today for the uproar over President Reagan's
plans to tour a German military cemetery during his state visit here next
week.
"The chancellor has caused the chaos. . . and he is pushing off the
reponsibility for it on his guest," Hans-Jochen Vogel told journalists at a
press breakfast.
Vogel is the deputy leader of the Social Democratic faction in the
Bundestag.
Reagan has come under heavy criticism at home and abroad, mainly
from Jewish leaders, for his plans to visit a German military cemetery at
Bitburg during his May 1-6 state visit to West Germany. The critics have
focused on the presence of graves of Nazi SS officers in the burial
ground.
The president said last week he would also visit a former Nazi concen
tration camp at Bergen-Belsen, but Jewish leaders have continued to call
on him to cancel the Bitburg trip.
Reagan's visit here comes just before the 40th anniversary of the
Allied defeat of Nazi Germany on May 8, 1945.
Vogel said Reagan is "welcome" in Bonn, despite the plans of some
Social Democrats to demonstrate against his defense and foreign policies
on May 5 in Neustadt.
"Opposition to the policies of the Reagan adminsitration has nothing
to do with anti-Americanism," Vogel said.
The ruling Christian Democratic Union condemned Monday as "anti-
American" the Social Democrats' plans to participate in the May 5
demonstration.
In addition to the Social Democrats, the Greens, Communists and
members of the country's anti-nuclear movement plan to take part in the
demonstration.
First round of arms talks ends
GENEVA, Switzerland — The first round of superpower arms talks
ended yesterday, and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev accused the
United States of reneging on a pledge to discuss a ban on space-based
weapons.
Summing up the first six weeks of talks, chief U.S. negotiator Max
Kampelman told reporters "a great deal remains to be done" to bridge
the gap between the superpowers.
To date, U.S. and Soviet negotiators have met for 54 hours in 21 ses
sions. Most of those were meetings of working groups in three separate
areas — strategic nuclear missiles, medium-range rockets and space
weapons and defensive systems.
In Moscow, Gorbachev blasted the U.S. position at the talks, saying
"Washington does not seek agreement with the Soviet Union."
In remarks reproduced by the official news agency Tass, Gorbachev
told the Communist Party Central Committee that the negative U.S.
response to his arms control initiatives two weeks earlier "clearly show
the United States' reluctance to lead matters to reasonable results."
Gorbachev said the Reagan administration "refuses in general to dis
cuss the question of preventing the race from spreading to space simulta
neously with the discussion of the question of nuclear arms limitation
and reduction."
"It (the United States) thus violates the accord, reached in January,
on the interconnection of the three subjects," Gorbachev said.
The spokesman for the U.S. delegation in Geneva had no comment on
Gorbachev's remarks.
Speaking to reporters after the final two-hour negotiating session,
Kampelman told reporters: "The American delegation expected these
negotiations to be difficult, and they have been."
Big quake jolts Philippine island
WASHINGTON — An earthquake measuring 6.2 on the Richter
scale was recorded on the Philippine island of Luzon yesterday, the U.S
Geological Servey said.
Spokesman Don Finley said the earthquake was centered about 150
miles north of Manila near Mt. Santo Tomas, a 7,402-ft. volcano. The
quake was reportedly felt strongly in nearby Baquito and in Manila.
Finley said the quake was the strongest on Luzon, the northernmost of
the main Philippine islands, since an Aug. 17, 1983, tremor that mea
sured 6.5 on the Richter scale. That quake killed 16 people, injured at
least 47 and caused extensive damage.
Chinese unions seek Soviet ties
PEKING — China's main federation of trade unions announced yes
terday it would consider resuming ties with the Soviet trade union move
ment.
The official Xinhua News Agency quoted the federation's Vice Presi
dent Wang Jiachong as saying the action was in the interest of world
peace and followed last year's restoration of union ties with the Soviet
bloc countries of East Germany and Hungary.
China's unions broke relations with those in Eastern bloc countries in
1967, after the Chinese-Soviet ideological dispute that ruptured
diplomatic relations.
But Chinese and Soviet leaders have been negotiating a resumption of
ties. The main obstacles are Chinese opposition to Soviet troops in Af
ghanistan, the deployment of Soviet soldiers near the Chinese border
and Moscow's support of its Vietnamese allies occupying Cambodia.
Rebels killed by Mozambique army
MAPUTO, Mozambique — Government troops have shot and killed
26 rebels, and the insurgents have killed three party officials and two
other civilians since last week, official sources said yesterday.
A military spokesman, who spoke on condition he not be identified,
said 21 anti-government guerrillas were killed last week in clashes in the
Massinga district of Inhambane Province. One guerrilla was reported
captured.
The army was reported to have killed five other guerrillas last week
near a main road at Tavira, 38 miles north of Maputo.
A statement from the Marxist government of Samora Machel said the
rebels attacked a convoy of government officials last Friday near Tavira,
killing five people, including three officials of the governing party.
Mozambican officials have accused South Africa of failing to stop
guerrillas from crossing their common border.
