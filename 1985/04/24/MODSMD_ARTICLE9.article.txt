# House rejects Contra aid bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Democratic-controlled
House last night rejected 248-180 President
Reagan's proposal for $ 14 million in direct military
aid to Contra insurgents seeking to overthrow the
leftist government of Nicaragua. The same resolu
tion was approved 53-46 by the Republican-led
Senate only a few hours earlier.
Combined, the two votes set up a continuing
congressional debate over whether to allow Reagan
to provide non-lethal assistance to the rebels.
In both houses, Reagan won some additional
support with a last-minute pledge to reopen direct
negotiations between the United States and the
Sandinista government, a key issue in Democratic
opposition to Reagan's policy toward Central
America.
Reagan also promised not to use the money for
military aid until the end of the current fiscal year
on Sept. 30.

The House vote was the first of three on aid to
the Contras, and the two remaining alternatives
were expected to be much closer when votes are
taken today.
One choice sponsored by House Democrats
would require that the $14 million be spent
through the United Nations or the International
Red Cross for Nicaraguan refugees and to enforce
any peace negotiated by countries in the Central
American region.
The second alternative, proposed by House Re
publican leader Robert Michel of Illinois and sup
ported by the president, would give recognition to
the Contras by distributing non-lethal aid to them
through the United States Agency for International
Development.
In the Senate, 43 Republicans and 10 Democrats
voted for the Contra aid proposal; 37 Democrats
and nine Republicans voted against. Sen. John East

(R-N.C.) did not vote because he is in the hospital,
Reagan's letter was a surprise, and marked an
open, last-minute effort to sway wavering senators
and House members to his side in a highly emo
tional legislative battle reminiscent of the early
years of the Vietnam War era.
"1 think the president's letter was a carefully
crafted attempt to get bipartisan support," said
Dole.
As the debate closed, Vice President George
Bush — in his role as president of the Senate — was
on hand in the event he was needed to break a tie
vote.
In his letter to Dole, Reagan said, "I intend to
resume bilateral talks with the government of
Nicaragua and will instruct our representatives in
those talks to press for a cease-fire as well as
(Roman Catholic) church-mediated dialogue be
tween the contending Nicaraguan factions."
