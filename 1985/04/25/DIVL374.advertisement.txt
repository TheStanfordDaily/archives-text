RONALD WILSON REAGAN
INSANE ANGLO WARLORD
(The Double Anagram, 666)
NOW YOU WILL KNOW THAT YOUR SPELL IS FOREVER BROKEN
You kneel at the graves of Nazis;
You violate the hearts and souls of
The World Peoples.
What God are you to forgive the dead?
The "Great Communicator" opens his Arms:
They are black with the death of poverty
And Broken Promises. Promises to Americans. Promises to The World.
I challenge you, Ronald Wilson Reagan, as a President and as a Man!
A free-form debate. This school year at Stanford university.
Where is your honor? What is your justice?
Black, perhaps. Empty, it seems.
Liberty's Torch burns brightly in My Heart.
Renounce Your Lies, Ronald Wilson Reagan, Renounce Your Name.
Sincerely and Forever Yours,
Lawrence Morris Leight, O. of W.P.
Now at Stanford University, Student
PSI: My Jewish grandparents surv ved (barely) the Luftwaffe's bombs in London; they escaped the incinerators of Hitler. Their child emigrated to These
United States. He married a poor and beautiful Ukrainian-American from Yonkers, New York. I am their Loving Son.
PS2: While you were on your 1979 compaign swing thru Tucson I was the News Editor for my high school paper. After listening to your speech, I briefly
interviewed you as you walked to your limosine.(You were dressed like a B-grade cowboy, if that helps.) Ironically, you put your arm around me
and called me "son": The Press was in full attendance I'm sure you don t remember.
PS3: Strange to relate, I have probably been fortunate enough to see more of the world in my 21 years than you have in your 00.1 didn't get to fly around
in my own jet, though. I didn t get to meet the diplomates. Many of the people I found were hungry Many were old and weak. Too weak for Star
Wars.
Lastly: Just for your information, I was conceived in Rome. In the Hassler Hotel, the sth or 7th floor (/ certainly don t remember). During a conference of
Archbishops and The Pop They were staying in my parents hotel. The day was Sunday. I am my parents Son.
Ride No Fiery Black Stallions, Ronald Reagan, cowboy-of-death,
Perhaps their reins would burn your hands.
Confer with No More Popes, Ronald Wilson Reagan.
Your commands have taken the lifes of too many Soldiers.
Your Soul is Stained with their BLOOD.
YOU ARE A BEAST!
Yet I love you. Yet I bleed for you. I am Your Servant.
Love You Always,
Lawrence Leignt
An American, Yet I make this challenge alone.
