Pentagon cites errors
WASHINGTON — Virtually all of the na
tion's defense contractors bill the Pentagon for
unallowable overhead expenses, and significant
percentages of the totals eventually are paid, a
congressional investigator said yesterday.
Frank Conahan. director of the General Ac
counting Office's national security division, said
the $244 million in overhead expenses billed by
General Dynamics Corp. and now challenged by
the Pentagon is no aberration.
Citing a list of unallowable expenses for dona
tions, travel, entertainment, public relations and
the like, Conahan told the House Energy and
Commerce investigations subcommittee: "These
costs are charged by all defense contractors. It's
not unusual that these costs are charged."
And he said that while millions of dollars in
such expenses are questioned by Pentagon
auditors, large amounts eventually are approved
for payment by relatively low-ranking contract
officers.
This is largely due to a defense system that
places its highest priority on the actual acquisi
tion of weapons systems. Conahan said.
"I think the system rewards people primarily
for getting (weapons) systems fielded so the em
phasis is on that sort of achievement rather than

for efficiency in the procurement process," he
said.
Meanwhile, Rep. Fortney Stark (D-Calif.), a
member of the House Ways and Means Commit
tee, introduced legislation designed to make
major defense contractors pay "their fair share of
taxes." He said it could raise billions of dollars in
revenue without raising taxes.
"Current law is a corporate accountant's
dream come true." in that it permits contractors
to put off paying taxes until the completion of
contracts, Stark contended.
"It is simply unjustifiable that these three com
panies had $8.9 billion in profits in 1981-1983,
paid no tax on that profit and actually received
refunds from the Treasury of $620 million."
Heart patient dies
LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Jack Burcham, the
oldest person to receive an artificial heart, died
last night, just 10 days after the mechanical pump
was implanted in his chest.
Burcham. 62, of Le Roy, 111., whose kidneys
had been failing since his operation, died at 9:48
p.m. at Humana Hospital Audubon, said Bob
Irvine, spokesman for Humana Inc.
Burcham's 10 days of life with the Jarvik-7
were the shortest span of any of the five

recipients of the pump.
Irvine refused to give the cause of death or any
other details, saying no further information
would he released until 7 a.m. today.
'Satanic' logo dropped
CINCINNATI — The Procter & Gamble Co.,
which has fought nationwide rumors of a link be
tween its moon-and-stars trademark and
Satanism in recent years, announced yesterday it
is removing the logo from its products.
The Cincinnati-based package goods giant said
it will gradually eliminate the 103-year-old
trademark as packages are redesigned.
Stocks close mixed
Stocks were mixed in moderate trading yester
day as a late rally in the previous session failed to
gain momentum.
Oil, aerospace and telephone issues paced the
gainers, while several paper and airline stocks
retreated.
Ihe Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
slipped 0.22 to 1,27K.49, after climbing 12.15
points to ii seven-week high Tuesday. The Dow
Jones transportation and utility averages also
dropped a fraction.
