## A 						long day for protesters here 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Editorial staff 
As the strains of "El Condor Pasa" by Simon and Gar
funkle wafted through the Quad last night, groups of stu
dents, huddled in blankets, planned events in this, the
first night of protest for the University's divestment of
companies that do business in South Africa.
I here were groups planning consensus decision
making, groups discussing tomorrow's rallies, groups
talking about how they would greet University President
Donald Kennedy when he returns to his office today,
groups of students taking part in a teach-in on non
violence, and even some groups of students studying.
Yesterdays rally and sit-in were, if not anything else,
certainly well organized.
I he ralliers in White Plaza were treated to a procession

of short, quick speeches, talks that were long enough to
pique passing students' interest, hut not too long to lose
too many students.
As the ralliers marched from White Plaza to Kennedy's
office, they were guided by protest organizers wearing
green armbands. There, rally organizers spoke through a
bullhorn and admonished protesters to remember that the
rally was peaceful. They also psyched up the crowd for
camping in the Quad through the night.
The protesters were provided dinner by Stanford
co-ops, the French House, the Corner Pocket and the
Coffee House. They were served soup, pizza and cookies.
A member of Stanford Out of South Africa (SOSA)
made an announcement over the public address system in
Meyer Library last night at about 10 p.m. asking students
to support the sit-in.
