# Berkeley sit-in runs 15 days

BERKELEY — A crowd of more
than 7,000 filled Harmon Ciym yes
terday for an open hearing on the call
for divestment from South Africa.
Twelve of the 28 members of the
University of California Board of
Regents, the governing body for all
nine schools in the UC' system, atten
ded the forum in what protest or
ganizers here are calling a limited vic
tory.
In a related protest action, 60 per
cent of the student body boycotted
classes for the second time in a week,
according to a survey conducted by
the UC Divestment Coalition.
The four-hour meeting included
representatives of labor, faculty and
various student organizations who
support the call to divest. The hearing
was granted as a concession to
protesters who have been conducting
a 1 5-day sit-in to force the UC system
to withraw its assets from corpora
tions operating in South Africa.
Mentioning the testimony of two
speakers in particular, several of the
regents, including UC President
David Gardner, called the hearing
helpful and persuasive.
Gaye Seidman, a graduate student
who has spent five of the past eight
years in South Africa working with
educators in black schools, and John
Harrington, president of Working
Assets Money Fund, told the over
flow audience that investments in
South Africa are neither socially
nor economically acceptable.
Gardner, who was interrupted with
shouts and jeers each time he took
the microphone, told the audience,
"If I knew exactly what I was going to

do, I would not be here today."
Harrington, acknowledging that
"money is the bottom line in our soci
ety," presented information from
several studies rating South Africa
free portfolios as more profitable, as
well as calling companies active in
South Africa "high investment risks."
While student body President
elect Pedro Noguera called the
hearing "a major victory of this
movement," one member of the sit-in
coalition offered a more pessimistic
view.
"The last time UC held a hearing,
it was designed to co-opt the move
ment, to placate, to passify. . . . Our
goal was not a hearing. Our goal is
total divestment, now," said Andrea
Pritchett.
The regents are scheduled to vote
on the group's primary demand —
full divestment of the UC system's
$1.7 billion currently invested in cor
porations operating in South Africa
— at their June meeting in Santa
Cruz.

Protesters oppose the date and set
ting of that meeting, insisting instead
on a divestment vote at the May
meeting in Berkeley. The regents,
awaiting a treasurers report on the
feasibility of divestment, say that is
not enough time.
Several speakers at the hearing
sought to nullify that argument by
reclassifying the question as one of
morality rather than economics.
"It is not a financial question, so it
does not need ... a financial answer.
It is immoral and obscene to ask,
'Can we afford it?' " said Hazel Cor
coran, spokeswoman for the Associ
ated Graduate Student Employees.
The regents in attendance, most of
whom were sympathetic or un
decided, voiced appreciation for the
opportunity to hear student views.
Yori Wada, one of the few regents
who cast his 1977 vote in favor of
divestment, said he counts seven solid
pro-divestment votes, but that he was
unsure of the remaining 21.
