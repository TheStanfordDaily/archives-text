Two tubs full of Draw numbers now sit in the
Clubhouse in Old Union where one bin previ
ously did — the result of the main change in the
annual Undergraduate Housing Draw. Students
with unguaranteed housing for the upcoming aca
demic year must draw from a separate, less
desirable, pool of numbers than their guaranteed
counterparts.
Although offering unguaranteed students a
bleak outlook, the change in this year's Draw
makes the system more equitable. In previous
years, students with unguaranteed status have
often made the Draw's assignable pool and got
ten into the school's most desirable residences.
Starting this year, however, unguaranteed stu
dents who make the assignable pool will not have
much chance of getting top-choice housing.
Each year, the Draw establishes an assignable
pool of students that corresponds with the num
ber of undergraduate housing spaces available.
Several unguaranteed students invariably get into

that pool and become eligible tor assignment to
University housing. Under the new system, no
unguaranteed student who makes the pool will
have a lower Draw number than any guaranteed
student. This ensures equity: Every student is at a
disadvantage in the Draw for one undergraduate
year.
In the past, a student could pick a low number
in an unguaranteed year, make the assignable
pool and get into Storey House. Being un
guaranteed did not necessarily mean being at a
disadvantage. With returning residence priority,
that student could stay in Storey for two years.
Meanwhile, a few lucky souls — some of them
guaranteed — are free to spend those same two
years in Stern.
While the revised Draw won't necessarily
ameliorate the "four years in Burbank
syndrome," it goes a long way toward achieveing
the level of housing equity to which every under
graduate should be entitled.
