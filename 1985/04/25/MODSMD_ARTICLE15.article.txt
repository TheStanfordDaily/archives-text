## Reagan is honoring murderers 
### 
I am an ardent supporter of President Reagan, hut I
find his plans to visit the Kolmeshohe cemetery at Bit
burg. a German cemetery where Nazi soldiers are buried,
absolutely unsupportable. This cemetery contains the
graves of I.SS7 German soldiers who died in World War
11. including 47 SS officers. As he accepted a Congres
sional Gold Medal on Friday, Elie Wiesel, a Holocaust
survivor and chairman of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial
Council, beseeched, "May I, Mr. President, if it's possible
at all. implore you to do something else, to find a way, to
find another way, another site. That place, Mr. President,
is not your place. Your place is with the victims of the SS."

VIEWPOINT

Looking at Reagan's comments and attitude, 1 wonder it
he knows anything at all about the Nazis' systematic ex
termination of 6,()()(),()()() Jews and their murdering of
6,000,000 non-Jews.
Reagan insists there is nothing wrong with his plans to
visit the cemetery, saying that the men interred there were
"victims just as surely as the victims in the concentration
camps." The German soldiers were not victims as the
people in the concentration camps were. Millions of Ger
man soldiers were never marched into gas chambers. They
were never used as guinea pigs for an incredible variety of
"medical" experiments. Hundreds of thousands of Ger
man soldiers were never forced to stand at the sides of
freshly dug mass graves before being shot so that no man
power would be wasted carrying bodies to these graves.
One million children of German soldiers were not
murdered in concentration camps.
While in a concentration camp, Wiesel saw innocent
children "being thrown into flames — aliveV It is incon
ceivable to me that anyone who has even a vague idea of
the atrocities that occurred in the concentration camps
could see the German soldiers as victims as surely as the
innocent people in concentration camps were victims.
They most certainly were not\
The SS. Reagan says, were "the villains, as we know,
that conducted the persecutions and all." "... And all."
Is it possible that Reagan was euphemistically referring to
the terror, the torture and the death that the SS caused?
Yes. we all know that the SS, the Nazi elite guard
conducted the persecutions and "all," but they alone
certainly could not and did not murder 12 million people!
In his speech, Wiesel noted that essayist Abe Rosenthal,
"having visited Auschwitz, once wrote an extraordinary
reportage about the persecution'of the Jews, and he called
it. "Forgive them not. Father, for they knew what they
did.' " Rosenthal was certainly not referring solely to the
SS. These men were not villains? Of course not. As
Reagan says, they were innocent victims!
In an interview with approximately 100 editors and
broadcasters at the White House on Friday, Reagan flatly
refused to eliminate this visit from his schedule, saying, "I
think it (canceling the visit) would be very hurtful and all
it would do is leave me looking as if I'd caved in in the face
of some unfavorable attention." Hurtful to whom? Is it
the Germans lie's worried about hurting? What about the
millions of people who lived (and those who died) in the
hell of concentration camps? What about the people who,
to this day. have numbers tatooed on their arms, constant
reminders of their unimaginably painful ordeals? What

about the people who cannot bear to talk about or watch a
movie about WWII without falling apart because of their
mental and physical scars? What about the hurt that the
real victims feel when they hear that Reagan plans to visit
a German cemetery and therefore implicitly honor the
men who inflicted indescribable pain and torment upon
them? Leaving aside for a moment those that were in the
concentration camps, what about the American soldiers
who fought in WWII? Reagan recently visited Normandy
to honor the soldiers who fought there, but now plans to
honor the very men they fought to defeat. What about the
hurt that will be felt by the American soldiers who fought
and the families of those who died to defeat the Germans?
This visit, not its cancellation, will cause enormous hurt.
If Reagan declares that he will not, as previously
planned, visit the German cemetery, I do not believe that
it would look like he had, to use his own words, "just
caved in in the face of some unfavorable attention." He
will clearly illustrate that he is a big enough man to recog
nize his mistake, to admit that it was indeed a mistake and
to make amends for it. Planning to visit Belsen-Bergen as

thing at all about the Nazis'
systematic extermination.

well as the cemetery is an extremely feeble attempt to
quell the anger over his planned cemetery visit. It does not
cancel the fact that immediately after he visits this concen
tration camp, thereby honoring its victims, he plans to
visit a German cemetery, thereby honoring the soldiers
who maintained the operation of such "death camps."
1 have nothing against the reconciliation of opposing
forces after war. It is a simple fact that in war, men are
killed. But innocent men, women and children are not, as
was done by the Germans, systematically murdered. They
are not herded like cattle into concentration camps that
are designed to murder the greatest number of people
with the greatest possible efficiency. These actions go
beyond the limits of war. I, like Wiesel, "do not believe in
collective guilt nor in collective responsibility. Only the
killers were guilty. Their sons and daughters are not."
Reagan seeks reconciliation with the German people,
but what a major tragedy it would be if he looked closely
at his plans, carefully examined the reasons why they are
causing such vast quantities of criticism to be heaped upon
him, and came to the logical conclusion that his visit to the
cemetery is not the right method by which to achieve this
goal! It is imperative that another method be found. It is
not Reagan's place to honor even a minute fraction of the
murderers of 12 million innocent people. His place, as
Wiesel states, "is with the victims of the SS" — the real
victims!
