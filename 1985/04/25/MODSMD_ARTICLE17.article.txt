# Gradsex—fad for the '80s
## 
### 
Have you had sex with a graduate student lately? I
doubt it. Graduate students are just one — the Stanford
Museum, the Tanner Lecture Series and the ASSU guest
speakers are some others — of the cultural resources that
are sadly neglected by the typical undergraduate. As you
ponder the sound of one hand clapping or the intricacies
of the Schleswig-Holstein question, gradsex is probably
the farthest thing from your minds. This is really a pity.
Consider the following:
Grad students make better lovers. Yes, it's true,
graduate students are much better lovers than some
wrestlers. While sitting in a king-sized hot tub for hours
on end and eating 12 meals a day may be wonderful train
ing for stylized ritual warfare, it's lousy preparation for

sex. Many sumo wrestlers are incapable ot achieving any
position other than "The Butterfly Approaching the
Beached Whale" (Kama Sutra, pp. 143-6, Stanford Uni
versity Press, 1927), whereas most graduate students have
advanced to at least the fumbling novice stage.
Grad students are safe. Grads are well-versed in some
of the biological sciences and are unlikely to produce any
of the less pleasant post-coital after-effects that your par
ents have warned you about. You can be sure that we've
washed any pollen off of our you-know-whats before we
get them anywhere near your pestals. Nosiree, there won't
be any baby birds, or maybe it's worker bees, I forget,
after gradsex. You won't get any diseases from grads
either. Growing up in the '60s, during the heyday of sex
education in the public schools, you can be sure that we're
very aware of the dangers of dirty fingernails and the im
portance of wearing clean underwear every day.
Grad students are sex experts. Loads of doctoral dis
sertations are written about sex every year. You might not
think that the sex life of the Southeast Asian bullfrog is
strictly applicable to human beings, but what the heck, it's
pretty close. And anyway, it makes a fascinating conversa
tional topic for afterward.
And speaking of which, grad students are better at oral
sex. Really, after ordinary differential equations, it's our
favorite topic of conversation. I've listened to grads talk
about sex — actually the lack thereof — for hours on end.
Come to think of it, they sound just like the conversations
we used to have in high school. Which should lead you to
believe that after 10 years of oral sex, we must be really
good at it by now.
Grad students are experienced. After losing my vir
ginity in a tragic bowling accident during high school, I've
gone on to watch hundreds of sex acts, and that's just on
network television. Throw in HBO and the movies they
show at stag parties, and we're talking real experience
here. While some of the more hip undergraduates may
know about the more esoteric uses for ice cubes ("The

Other Side of Midnight"), how many of them would know
what to do with taco sauce ("Revenge of the Burrito Broth
ers") or whittle ball bats ("Liquid Sky")- These are just a
few of the tidbits that the average grad picks up while
making his or her way through life.
Grad students are esoteric. After you leave Stanford
and settle down into a suburban upper-middle-class,
white bread existence, you'll regret any wild oats you
didn't sow while you were here. It's unlikely that your life
mate will be amused by your little fling with the tennis
pro, so if you want to have any diversity in your sex life,
now's the time. Imagine how dull a sex life that consists
entirely of doctors, lawyers and insurance salesmen is
going to seem when you're 50. Just think, this may be
your last chance to make it with a poor person or a Demo
crat or even a Serbo-Croatian.
Grad students are available. Many grad students plan to
go into teaching when they leave Stanford and are always
willing to help out a younger person. Just buttonhole one
in White Plaza and tell him (or her) that you'd like to be
initiated into Life's Mysteries. Unless they're on the way
to a particularly fascinating class, I'm sure they'll be will
ing to help you out. Stanford has even arranged that most
grad students have singles, law students being the excep
tion for obvious reasons, to facilitate this process.

Still not convinced? Well, consider this. Dr. Ruth wits
once a grad student; so was Kinscy. Both Masters and
Johnson were once grads. I, for instance, still am. How of -
ten do you think life is going to present you with such an
obvious chance to get in on the ground floor?
Finally, consider the alternatives. Sure you could limit
yourselves to attractive young blonds with nice bodies. On
second thought, don't consider the alternatives. Consider
the Christian virtues (charity in particular) instead. I have
it on no less authority than Pope John Paul II that good
acts are a sure way to get yourself into heaven.
So next time you're sitting in Meyer having difficulty
concentrating on one of the big books, consider your al
ternatives and choose gradsex. You'll be glad you did.
And remember, once you've gone grad, you'll never go
back.
