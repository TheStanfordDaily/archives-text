Use students, not pros
I heartily agree with your
reviewer's assessment ot Ram's
I lead's production of "Sweeney
Todd" (The Daily. April 19). The
production was highly entertaining.
ver\ powerful and a success for all
involved.
However. "Sweeney"' also
represents a disturbing change in
Ram's Head policy that I feel should
be examined. Specifically, four of the
si\ male leads were acted by semi
professional "ringers" imported for
the production.
Ram's Head has traditionally been
an all-student organization, and
casting has been limited to members
ol the Stanford community — stu
dents. faculty and staff. In the past,
exceptions were made for students
who had graduated within the last
two years. Although I am not aware
ol am official rules to this effect, my
understanding is that this has been a
longstanding R.nn's Head policy.
Yet for "Sweeney." three of the
male leads have no official ties to
Stanford and are. in fact, semi
protessional opera stars. A fourth
used to be a student, but graduated
fixe xears ago. making his eligibility
.it least suspect under the old policy
Who is hurt by the new policy?
Certainly not the audience, as is
amplx demonstrated by the current
production. Rather, it is the students
themselves, who are being denied
the onportunitx to pla\ lead roles.

To me. Ram's Head should be a
showcase for student talent, and not
just another community theater
company where students are
relegated to bit roles behind profes
sionally trained singers.
This issue is intertwined with
another to which I would like to
address myself: show selection. Your
reviewer welcomed "Sweeney Todd"
as a refreshing change from
"traditional, upbeat, toe-tapping
musicals such as 'Anything Goes'
and Hello. Dolly.* " I would agree
to a certain extent, but I would like
to point out that light-hearted musi
cals are no less legitimate as repre
sentatives of American musical
theater. In fact. "Anything Goes"
and "Hello. Dolly" were themselves
refreshing changes after three years
of dark, heaxy "message" shows:
"Pippin." "West Side Story" and
"Cabaret." There is room for both
kinds of shows, and a balance should
be struck between them.
in choosing a show, one
should consider the level of talent
available. No one would seriously
suggest that the Stanford Music
Department should present a pro
duction of Wagner's "Ring": only a
small handful of singers in the world
can handle it. much less even the
best ol Stanford's students.
My point is merely this: It Ram's
Head can't find enough student
talent to successfully present a vo
cally demanding show like "Sweeney
Todd." max be thcx shouldn't be

doing shows of this level of difficulty.
There are dozens of other musicals
which arc less demanding, yet no less
deserving of the kind of top-caliber
productions that Ram's Head is
capable of giving.
I realize that many people will not
agree with my views; after all, it is
difficult to argue with success.
However, at the very least. 1 hope
that Ram's Head will consider these
issues and make a conscious decision
as to its role in the Stanford theater
community, rather than letting the
professionals take oxer through
sheer momentum.

In response to Bill livers' column
"In defense of drinkers rights" (The
Daily. April 22). it should be ob
vious that society must at times be
protected from the ignorance of
some of its members. For this rea
son. small children are prevented, bx
law. from voting and purchasing
firearms. The intent is not to punish
children by limiting their rights; it is
to protect the society as a whole. The
prudence of similar legal restrictions
on the consumption of alcohol bx
those under the age of 21 is all too
regularly demonstrated on our high
ways.
It would be wonderful if socictx

could always trust all its members to
use sound judgment, making such
legislation unnecessary, hut the
unfortunate truth is it cannot. As
people such as Evcrs constantly
demonstrate, we are surrounded hy
unthinking, irresponsible beings
whose activities must sometimes be
legally restrained for the good of
society.
