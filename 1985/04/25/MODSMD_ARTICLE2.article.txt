### MARK LAWRENCE Staff writer 
While Stanford and UC-Berkeley
students demonstrated against apart
heid yesterday, students at more than
120 other schools around the country
held rallies* sit-ins, marches and class
boycotts in response to the call lor a
national day of student protest.
The nationwide demonstration,
called the National Day of Strike and

the six schools — Columbia, UC-
Berkeley, UC-Santa Cruz, Cornell,
Rutgers and the University of
Wisconsin-Madison — leading the
apartheid protest movement.
Students at Madison occupied the

Robert Itzen, a reporter for the Daily

ing that the state of Wisconsin divest

Africa, as the University did seven
years ago.
The protest began as a rally of
about b()() to 800 students in the
middle of that school's campus, Itzen
said. Close to 1,200 students then
marched to the nearby state capital
building and took over its rotunda at
1:45 p.m., while about 150 occupied
the office of Gov. Anthony Earl, a
noted apartheid protester who was
not present at the time.
At about 5:30, the students were
given Earl's permission to protest in
the rotunda and to remain there in
definitely. The 150 then abandoned
his office, and no arrests were made.
Itzen was unsure about the future
of the protest. '"It's got a lot of mo
mentum right now, and nobody
knows how long it's going to last. It
went better than expected," he said.
I .ate last night, a spokesman for the
UCSC Nationwide Network Commit
tee, a Santa Cruz-based hotline pro
viding protest information, said that
between 200 and 300 people were
planning to spend the night in the
rotunda and that "more and more
I were | arrivinu even minute."
In addition to Karl's guarantee that
students could remain in the capital
building, he also announced that he
would Aoon replace two members of
the state investment board because of
the protest.
In California, students at each of
the nine UC campuses
protested the system's SI .7 billion in
vested in companies that do business
in South Africa.
At UC-Davis. 25 students were ar
rested for sitting in at the chancellor's
office, while 1.500 protestors rallied

outside Mrak Hall, the University's
main administration building, now
dubbed "Desmond Tutu Hall."
Davis students also attempted a
boycott of classes which was about 30
percent successful, according to a
spokesperson for the California
Aggie, the campus newspaper. Close
to 100 protesters remain on the steps
of Mrak Hall where they have
remained constantly since Monday
night.
At UCLA, about 100 protesters
remained in a "tent city" in front of
Murphy Hall, the school's adminis
tration building, according to Ron
Bell, a writer for the Daily Bruin. The
si I-in there began Tuesday when
about 1.000 students entered the

building and held a teach-in on apart
heid.
Bell said that the protesters have
not decided when the\ v\ i 11 leave.
The> continue to demand that the
University's trustees discuss divest
ment at a meeting next month and
that charges be dropped against the
students arrested at Berkeley last
week.
More than 2.0(H) UC-San Diego
students rallied for divestment.
About 100 planned last night to sleep
at the "Nelson Mandela'' Library there
and remain until noon today, when
Chancellor Richard Atkinson will
return from Washington. D.C.
Meanwhile at Harvard University.
45 students staged a sit-in at the

headquarters of the Harvard Corpor
ation. a building which includes the
offices ot the president, the treasurer
and five fellows, all of whom con
stitute the top governing board of the
university, according to Peter Howe,
senior editor ot the Harvard Crimson.
I he protesters, representing the
undergraduate school and four of the
10 graduate schools, entered the
building at 9 a.m. when a freshman
woman told a security officer guard
ing the door to the building that she
had a package to deliver to someone
inside. She was able to prop open the
door and allow the others to enter the
building.
I he police reported to the Crimson
that the guard "received injuries to

the knuckles and shins."
The protesters held a "learn-in" on
the issue of apartheid while they oc

business in South Africa. The
protesters left at 5 p.m. without any

disciplinary action.
The faculty at Oberlin College in
Ohio yesterday approved a resolution
calling on that school to divest of $25
million in stock in companies that

victoiA." About 200 students also

staged a one hour sit-in in an admin

began April 4, on the steps ot Hamil

derstand that racism does not just
happen in South Africa — it happens
here." according to Marion klevan ol
the Columbia Coalition for a Free

While Stanford and UC-Berkeley
students demonstrated against apart
heid yesterday, students at more than
120 other schools around the country
held rallies* sit-ins, marches and class
boycotts in response to the call lor a
national day of student protest.
The nationwide demonstration,
called the National Day of Strike and
Protest, was organized by groups at
the six schools — Columbia, UC-
Berkeley, UC-Santa Cruz, Cornell,
Rutgers and the University of
Wisconsin-Madison — leading the
apartheid protest movement.
Students at Madison occupied the
governor's office in the statehouse
for almost four hours, according to
Robert Itzen, a reporter for the Daily
Cardinal there. Students are demand
ing that the state of Wisconsin divest
of companies doing business in South
Africa, as the University did seven
years ago.
The protest began as a rally of
about b()() to 800 students in the
middle of that school's campus, Itzen
said. Close to 1,200 students then
marched to the nearby state capital
building and took over its rotunda at
1:45 p.m., while about 150 occupied
the office of Gov. Anthony Earl, a
noted apartheid protester who was
not present at the time.
At about 5:30, the students were
given Earl's permission to protest in
the rotunda and to remain there in
definitely. The 150 then abandoned
his office, and no arrests were made.
Itzen was unsure about the future
of the protest. '"It's got a lot of mo
mentum right now, and nobody
knows how long it's going to last. It
went better than expected," he said.
I .ate last night, a spokesman for the
UCSC Nationwide Network Commit
tee, a Santa Cruz-based hotline pro
viding protest information, said that
between 200 and 300 people were
planning to spend the night in the
rotunda and that "more and more
I were | arrivinu even minute."

students could remain in the capital
building, he also announced that he
would Aoon replace two members of
the state investment board because of
the protest.
