# Campus joins national apartheid protest
## More than 120 rallies nationwide 
### MARK LAWRENCE Staff writer 
While Stanford and UC-Berkeley
students demonstrated against apart
heid yesterday, students at more than
120 other schools around the country
held rallies* sit-ins, marches and class
boycotts in response to the call lor a
national day of student protest.
The nationwide demonstration,
called the National Day of Strike and
Protest, was organized by groups at
the six schools — Columbia, UC-
Berkeley, UC-Santa Cruz, Cornell,
Rutgers and the University of
Wisconsin-Madison — leading the
apartheid protest movement.
Students at Madison occupied the
governor's office in the statehouse
for almost four hours, according to
Robert Itzen, a reporter for the Daily
Cardinal there. Students are demand
ing that the state of Wisconsin divest
of companies doing business in South
Africa, as the University did seven
years ago.
The protest began as a rally of
about b()() to 800 students in the
middle of that school's campus, Itzen
said. Close to 1,200 students then
marched to the nearby state capital
building and took over its rotunda at
1:45 p.m., while about 150 occupied
the office of Gov. Anthony Earl, a
noted apartheid protester who was
not present at the time.
At about 5:30, the students were
given Earl's permission to protest in
the rotunda and to remain there in
definitely. The 150 then abandoned
his office, and no arrests were made.
Itzen was unsure about the future
of the protest. '"It's got a lot of mo
mentum right now, and nobody
knows how long it's going to last. It
went better than expected," he said.
I .ate last night, a spokesman for the
UCSC Nationwide Network Commit
tee, a Santa Cruz-based hotline pro
viding protest information, said that
between 200 and 300 people were
planning to spend the night in the
rotunda and that "more and more
I were | arrivinu even minute."
