## Spikers head into playoffs 
### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
Now that it's earned a ticket to
tonight's first round of the NCAA
West Regional at Northridge. the
Cardinal men's volleyball team must
prove it belongs on the same court
with the elite of the sport.
The men will have the opportunity
to demonstrate their worth this even
ing when they take on USC. the
country's No. 2 team, at S. It the men
somehow get past the 15-3 Trojans,
they will encounter the winner of the
UC-Santa Barbara-UCL.A match,
which precedes the Cardinal's game
in the same arena.
The survivor of Saturday's contest
between the winners of tonight's
games will go on to the NCAA Final
Four at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion next
weekend. The West Regional's win
ner will join No. 1 - r a n k e d P e p -
perdine — which was given an auto
matic bye to the Final Four after
finishing first in the California Inter
collegiate Volleyball Association —
and the champions from the Midwest
and East Regionals.
If you go by the record books,
Stanford would appear out of its
league. The Cardinal has not posted a
single regular-season victory against
any of the other three teams on hand
this weekend at Northridge, and that
was in six tries, three each at home
and on the road.
But sometimes, a coach has to he
optimistic. "I think we'll be the

hungriest of them all." Co-coaeh Dun
Shaw said. "Besides. anything can
happen at this stage."
It Stanford wants a miracle, it will
have to play as well as it did in late
January, when, at the UCSB
Micheloh Light Invitational, the
Cardinal pulled off successive upsets
of the Trojans in the semifinal and
the Bruins in the final to grab first
place. The team has yet to recapture
that flame.
Stanford. 10-X in league play. got
its imitation to the regionals through
the hack door. When Hawaii lost to
Santa Barbara Friday in five sets, the
Cardinal got the word to pack its bags
for a trip south.
The Gauchos' triumph prevented a
three-way tie for the league's fourth
spot, a tie that would have left the
Cardinal at home.
"We feel we deserve it." Shaw said.
"But we still feel like we've been
given a new life."
As for tonight's matchup with
USC, Shaw saw some reason for
hope. "I think we match up well with
them, and we did take them to five
sets a couple of weeks ago."
Win or lose. Shaw foresaw some
fine volleyball. "This is going to be a
great tournament, probably more ex
citing than the Final Four," he said.
That was an oblique cut at the Mid
western and Eastern champs, who
never really challenge the two CIV A
representatives.

In the single-elimination NCAA West Kegionals, Brett Monello and his
Stanford teammates will have to kill frequently, or get killed by No. 2
use.
