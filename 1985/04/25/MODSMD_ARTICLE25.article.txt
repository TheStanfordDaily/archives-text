also will make the trip to Ojai. as
eight netters are entered in four
different flights.
In the collegiate singles and
doubles brackets, each team is
awarded a point for each individ
ual victory, and the team with the
most points at the end of the
weekend is awarded the Hef
felfinger Trophy, which Stanford
won last year.

singles players and one doubles
team in the collegiate division.
