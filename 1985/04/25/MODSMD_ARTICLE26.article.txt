# Golfers get ready for Pac-10s
## Card warms up in Arizona 
### KEN STEVENS Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's golf team begins the
busiest, most challenging part of its schedule
today with the opening round of the Sun
Devil Invitational in Scottsdale, Ariz.
The Cardinal men will be on the links for
six of the next seven days. Following the con
clusion of the Sun Devil Invitational Satur
day, they will travel to Pullman, Wash., for
opening-round action Monday in the Pacific
10 Conference Championships.
The Cardinal will face many of the West
Coast's best teams at the Sun Devil, including
Arizona, San Jose State and USC. Victories
over any of these schools would guarantee the
Cardinal an advantage in the season series
with the school.
The Pac-10 Championships will be very
competitive, according to Stanford Coach
Tim Schaaf. The winner of the Pac-10 tourna
ment receives an automatic berth in next

month's nationals and is generally regarded as
one of the nation's top teams, Schaaf said.
Earlier this season, Schaaf set a victory in
this years Pac-10 Championships as one of
the goals for his team. In his attempt to realize
this goal, he has selected seniors Scott Erick
son, Tim Robinson and Doug Thompson,
junior Carl Wagner, sophomore Rich Marik
and freshman John Dickey to compete this
week.
Robinson, an All-American last year as a
junior, is in contention once again for national
honors. Schaaf has praised him for his tre
mendous consistency throughout the season,
including consecutive victories in the John
Burns Invitational in Hawaii and the
Sacramento State Invitational.
Thompson, who began the season on a
strong note, capturing second, fourth and
eighth place in his first three tournaments,
struggled through part of the mid-season. In
his most recent performance, however, he

fired a 216 in the Stanford U.S. Intercol
legiate, good for a tie for eighth place.
Erickson, like Robinson, has been a consis
tent performer for the Cardinal, and is in con
tention for Academic All-American honors.
Wagner, Marik and Dickey have all been
on the upswing lately. Marik captured second
place in the Stanford U.S. Intercollegiate and
came back last weekend to record a fifth
place finish in the Cougar Classic at Provo,
Utah.
The Cardinal men should run into some
stiff individual competition in both Arizona
and Washington. USC's Sam Randolph and
UCLA's Duffy Waldorf are among the finest
amateur golfers in the country.
Randolph was runner-up at the U.S.
Amateur Championships and recently
finished as the low amateur in the Masters.
Waldorf has won a handful of tournaments
this season, including the Stanford U.S. Inter
collegiate, where he shot a tournament
record 199 over three rounds.
