## Softballers look to repeat win 
### DAVE DUTCHER Senior sportswriter 
When you've lost more than four-fifths of your
games, it's difficult to get excited for another one.
especially it the season will be over in less than two
weeks.
Hut motivation probably won't be a problem for
the Stanford softball team or for St. Mary's, its op
ponent at 2 p.m. today in Moraga. And strangely
enough, the Cardinal's drive will come from a
player who will make the trip, but not play.
On March 12 at Roble Field. Stanford sopho
more catcher Margaret Pezzini suffered strained
ligaments in her left knee in a home-plate collision
with a St. Mary's player. The visitors went on to
sweep a double-header that day.and Pezzini hasn't
played since.
Cut to last Friday at the Reno. Nev.. Invitational.

The Cardinal won one of six games there, and that
victors came against — you guessed it — St.
Man's. Stanford, according to sophomore catcher
Laura Buchanan, "really just wanted to beat (St.
Mary's] for Margaret."
That's how you generate interest in a game that,
at first glance, doesn't appear exciting — St.
MaiVs. of the National Association ot Intercol
legiate Athletics, is 15-13. and the Cardinal is 1 1-
45. In short, there could he players on both sides
who have something to prove.
"I think once we get there, they'll be ready."
Stanford Coach Kathy Lincoln said of her team.
"Margaret should be traveling with us. and having
her there will stir up some feelings.
"I anticipate us being ready'when we take the
field."
The Cardinal minht find St. Mary's ready to play

as well. St. Mary s is coming off a surprising
second-place finish in the three-day Reno Invita
tional. In the single-elimination playoffs that fol
lowed round-robin play. St. Mary's defeated
Hayward State. 3-2. before eliminating top-seeded
Oregon. 1-0. in 17 innings.
The Cinderella story, however, ended. St. Mary's
lost to Portland State. 2-1. in the tournament final
Saturday.
"It they took second, they'll be ready." said Lin
coln. who was surprised to learn of St. Mary 's finish
because Stanford left Reno after being eliminated
by host Nevada-Reno. "They know we were up for
them. If they're fired up. they'll be tough."
The Cardinal will play at Cal State-Northridge
Saturday. Lincoln said Stanford's road games,
which make up 60 percent of its schedule, have
"reallv taken a toll on us."
