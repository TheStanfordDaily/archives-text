Vowing to end the University's in
vestments in companies that do busi
ness in South Africa. 250 students
continued a sit-in in front of Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy's of
fice late last night.
The sit-in, which followed yester
day's noon rally in White Plaza atten
ded by about 800 people, will con
tinue until the group's demands for
total divestment are met, protest or
ganizers said last night.
The protest is the largest and best
organized since the late-19705.
Demonstrators are joining thousands
of other college students at univer
sities across the United States who
are protesting university investments
in companies that do business in
South Africa.
"We have to rally, we have to make
some noise, we have to sit in, we have
to take a long-term view and make the
University agree to our demands,"
said Alice Stauffer, a member of Stu
dents Against Reaganism and one of
the protest's organizers.
The student vowed to sit in in
front of Kennedy's office until the
University's Board of Trustees agrees
to divest of companies, such as
Motorola and Hitachi, which the
protesters say support the racist sys
tem of apartheid in South Africa. The
protesters are also asking for a public
forum including faculty and students
that will discuss strategies for total
divestment, and are demanding that
the vice president for business and
finance and members of the Board of
Trustees disclose their personal in
vestments so students will know
whether there is a conflict of interest
in their decisions concerning divest
ment.
Kennedy, who was in Washington.
D C. yesterday for a meeting of the
Association of American Univer
sities. is expected to return to Stan
ford today.
Kennedy talked over the telephone
to Steve Phillips, a representative of
Stanford Out of South Africa
(SOSA). yesterday afternoon. Ac
cording to Phillips. Kennedy said all
calls for divestment should go

through the "'normal processes."
Phillips said Kennedy said a public
forum was "a possibility that can be
studied," but his response to SOSA's
demands for a personal financial dis
closure was "not positive."
Stanford's portfolio includes in
vestments in 97 firms that deal with
South Africa, according to University
Treasurer Rodney Adams. The Stan
ford Coalition Against Apartheid
claims that the school's holdings in
such firms amount to $215 million.
The mood at the noon rally and af
ternoon demonstration was primarily
festive, as speakers hailed the return
of student activism.
"A whole new generation of stu
dents is coming alive," Stauffer told
the noon rally. "Apartheid cannot be
reformed. It must be destroyed."
Jon Adelstein, another speaker,
renamed White Plaza "Stephen Biko
Plaza," in honor of the South African
leader who was killed in prison.
Protesters at UC-Berkeley have
renamed Sproul Hall there "Stephen
Biko Hall."
"We've sat patiently all year,"
Adelstein told the crowd. "Now let's
sit in at the president's office."
William Massy, vice president for
business and finance, carrying a bull
horn and speaking in Kennedv's ab
sence, told the crowd of 400 in front
of the president's office that there
would be no immediate action on the
demonstrators' demands.
He said apartheid is "abhorrent" to
"every right-thinking person on
earth," but said divestment may not
be the most effective way of encour
aging its end.
In response to the group's call for
the University's divestment of
Hitachi stock in the wake of claims
that the company is selling equipment
to the South African police or mili
tary, Massy said the issue should be
referred to the Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (C-IR).
Protesters responded that a
February decision in favor of condi
tional divestment of Motorola stock,
if it can be proved that the company is
continuinu to sell to the South

More than 250 students spend the night in the Quad, continuing the sit-in from yesterday afternoon. The
protesters studied, sang and learned about non-violent demonstration.
African military and police, makes a
decision in favor of Hitachi divest
ment much easier.
The sit-in seemed smaller and less
festive last night, as the crowd
dwindled to 250 from 400 during the
afternoon and protesters began to
face the prospect of sleeping in a cold
wind all night.
In October 1984, a referendum
sponsored by the ASSU Senate that
called on the University to divest its
holdings in Motorola passed with 81
percent approval.
In January, more than 50 students
held a sit-in at Massy's office, asking

that the University take a more as
sertive stance against apartheid.
In February, the Stanford Board of
Trustees agreed to the conditional
divestment of its 124,000 shares of
Motorola Corp., valued at $4.6 mil
lion.
Members of the Black Student
Union met with Kennedy April 17,
and Kennedy said the students had
made a "strong, persuasive appeal"
for more constructive involvement by
him in national efforts to oppose
apartheid.
"I think the legislative front is one
on which we ought to move," Ken
nedy said then. "We can have only
one foreign policy toward South
Africa, and we ought to influence
what it is."
Members of SOSA passed around

a petition supporting protesters at
UC-Berkeley and calling for total
Stanford divestment. According to
SOSA members, 1,300 students, fac
ulty and staff signed the petition,
which will be sent to California
Senators Alan Cranston and Pete
Wilson, the UC regents, Stanford's
Board of Trustees, Massy, Kennedy
and other Stanford officials.
About 70 faculty members, includ
ing Dean of Student Affairs Jim
Lyons, signed the petition yesterday,
according to members of SOSA.
The Stanford police said last night
they would not interfere with the sit
in if it remains peaceful.
"As long as they stay orderly and
peaceful, there will be no arrests,"
said Capt. Marvin Moore of the Stan
ford police.
