# Stroheim's 'Queen Kelly' restored to original form
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG Editorial staff 
By the time Erich von Stroheim
went to work on "Queen Kelly." his
career was already in a shambles. His
extravagance and lunatic attention to
naturalistic detail (he fitted a house
with full electric lighting for a single
long shot in "Greed") had alienated
him from Hollywood moguls such as
Irving Thalberg, who supervised the
cutting of "Greed" to approximately
one-quarter its intended length. And
his dictatorial hand with actors had
made him extremely unpopular; doz
ens of stories have accumulated
around his name, stories of gross in
sensitiv ity to actors and unreasonable
demands made of them. That he was
a genius seems undeniable, though
none of his movies, including the
amazing, chopped-up "Greed," is
very likable, and the relentless, ironic
vision they share of man as a creature
capable of and in fact delighting in

the most revolting excesses, coupled
with the excesses of the style levied
upon it. might well belong to a gifted
mudmun.
"Queen Kelly." shot in 1928. had a
particularly weird set of components.
It starred Gloria Swanson. and was
produced hy the young Joe Kennedy,
who was in love with her; he gave
Stroheim $800.000 and the freedom
to shoot (more or less) whatever he
wanted. But Swanson hated the ma
terial, and she grew distrustful and
then frightened of Stroheim.
Stroheim. like Griffith, spun his
movies off traditional melodrama:
hut whereas Griffith invested these
Victorian elements with a rich emo
tional spectrum, Stroheim trans
formed them by turning them per
verse and acrid. In "Queen Kelly."
Swanson plays a sweet Irish convent
lass who wins the love of a prince
(Walter Byron) and the fury of his
fiancee, the mad Queen Regina

(Seena Owen). (No one explains
satisfactorily what an Irish maiden is
doing in a mythical European
kingdom called Kronberg.) When
Regina finds them together, she
throws Kelly out ot the palace and
imprisons Prince Wolfram: Kelly tries
to drown herself but is rescued and
sails for Africa to care for a dying
aunt who runs a brothel. On her
deathbed, the aunt persuades the
meek, obedient Kelly to marry a
living nightmare named Jan (Tully
Marshall), a syphilitic, sex-crazed
monster — and. according to the
shooting script Stroheim prepared,
she goes on to take over the brothel
(living apart from Jan. who finally
gets killed) and is eventually
reconciled to her prince.
Nothing past the brothel wedding
scene was ever filmed, however, be

picture, had Kennedy fire Stroheim
and transfer the rights to her. She
shot a new tragic ending, with the
help of photographer Gregg Toland,
in which Kelly dies in the river, and
released the film without success in
Europe. And in an ironic twist that
could only happen in Hollywood, a
clip from the film showed up in the
1950 Billy Wilder picture "Sunset
Boulevard," in which Swanson
played an aging movie queen — and
Erich von Stroheim her devoted but
ler, once her husband and director.

'Queen Kelly' is a
fascinating curio
— evidence both
of Stroheim's
unique talents and
his madness.

The "African" reels turned up
more than 20 years ago, thanks to the
steady digging of Stroheim historian
Herman G. Weinberg, but the print
screened at the Castro Theatre in San
Francisco last month was the first to
include them — and, indeed, the first
"Queen Kelly" anyone had seen in
years. Much of the movie is just
dreadful, especially the footage that
must have kept Swanson going as
long as she did — the courtship of
Wolfram and Kelly, which seems to
take an eternity. The scenes that
prompted Swanson to call Stroheim
mad (as she did, loudly and

repeatedly) are the most audacious
and funniest part of the movie —
shots of that Veronal-addicted queen
in her bath, holding her pet cat to her
breasts (a concession to the actress,
Seena Owen, apparently, who balked
at being photographed entirely in the
nude), or on a royal bed decorated
with naked Cupids; the scene in
which Regina, drooling, chases Kelly
through the palace corridors, snap
ping a whip at her back, while guards
in full regalia stare on amused; and
best of all, the brothel scenes lost for
so long.
This is where the archivists have
done movie lovers a real service:
Without the African sequence, there
is precious little reason to sit through
the movie, but in his oddball Holly
wood Africa, Stroheim makes us
gasp. Tully Marshall plays Jan as a
crippled predator with one earring
and crooked diamond eyes, his mouth
literally trembling with lecherous
desire; when the old aunt joins his
hands to Kelly's over her deathbed,
he chews deliberately on his cigar.
(This is both the most chilling and the
most hilarious moment in the movie.)
Stroheim has lit Marshall to look like
a specter and directed him to stand
with his legs (and crutches) far apart
— a peculiar detail that somehow
makes him look more menacing —
and when the aunt points her finger at
Jan and nods to her niece, indicating
that indeed this is the man she has
picked out for the innocent orphan to
marry, you can hear the lock click
shut on Kelly's chamber in hell. The
one still we see of Swanson dressed in
high low style, as queen of that East
African hell, indicates that if Swanson
had only abandoned herself to the ex
cesses of the movie, her performance
might have been a revelation. But she
refused — and the rest of "Queen
Kelly" is one potential treasure no ar
chivist will ever uncover, since it was
never consigned to film. What
remains is a fascinating curio —

'Queen Kelly' is a
fascinating curio
— evidence both
of Stroheim's
unique talents and
his madness.

The "African" reels turned up
more than 20 years ago, thanks to the
steady digging of Stroheim historian
Herman G. Weinberg, but the print
screened at the Castro Theatre in San
Francisco last month was the first to
include them — and, indeed, the first
"Queen Kelly" anyone had seen in
years. Much of the movie is just
dreadful, especially the footage that
must have kept Swanson going as
long as she did — the courtship of
Wolfram and Kelly, which seems to
take an eternity. The scenes that
prompted Swanson to call Stroheim
mad (as she did, loudly and

repeatedly) are the most audacious
and funniest part of the movie —
shots of that Veronal-addicted queen
in her bath, holding her pet cat to her
breasts (a concession to the actress,
Seena Owen, apparently, who balked
at being photographed entirely in the
nude), or on a royal bed decorated
with naked Cupids; the scene in
which Regina, drooling, chases Kelly
through the palace corridors, snap
ping a whip at her back, while guards
in full regalia stare on amused; and
best of all, the brothel scenes lost for
so long.
This is where the archivists have
done movie lovers a real service:
Without the African sequence, there
is precious little reason to sit through
the movie, but in his oddball Holly
wood Africa, Stroheim makes us
gasp. Tully Marshall plays Jan as a
crippled predator with one earring
and crooked diamond eyes, his mouth
literally trembling with lecherous
desire; when the old aunt joins his
hands to Kelly's over her deathbed,
he chews deliberately on his cigar.
(This is both the most chilling and the
most hilarious moment in the movie.)
Stroheim has lit Marshall to look like
a specter and directed him to stand
with his legs (and crutches) far apart
— a peculiar detail that somehow
makes him look more menacing —
and when the aunt points her finger at
Jan and nods to her niece, indicating
that indeed this is the man she has
picked out for the innocent orphan to
marry, you can hear the lock click
shut on Kelly's chamber in hell. The
one still we see of Swanson dressed in
high low style, as queen of that East
African hell, indicates that if Swanson
had only abandoned herself to the ex
cesses of the movie, her performance
might have been a revelation. But she
refused — and the rest of "Queen
Kelly" is one potential treasure no ar
chivist will ever uncover, since it was
never consigned to film. What
remains is a fascinating curio —
evidence both of Stroheim's unique
talents and his madness.
By the time Erich von Stroheim
went to work on "Queen Kelly." his
career was already in a shambles. His
extravagance and lunatic attention to
naturalistic detail (he fitted a house
with full electric lighting for a single
long shot in "Greed") had alienated
him from Hollywood moguls such as
Irving Thalberg, who supervised the
cutting of "Greed" to approximately
one-quarter its intended length. And
his dictatorial hand with actors had
made him extremely unpopular; doz
ens of stories have accumulated
around his name, stories of gross in
sensitiv ity to actors and unreasonable
demands made of them. That he was
a genius seems undeniable, though
none of his movies, including the
amazing, chopped-up "Greed," is
very likable, and the relentless, ironic
vision they share of man as a creature
capable of and in fact delighting in

the most revolting excesses, coupled
with the excesses of the style levied
upon it. might well belong to a gifted
mudmun.
"Queen Kelly." shot in 1928. had a
particularly weird set of components.
It starred Gloria Swanson. and was
produced hy the young Joe Kennedy,
who was in love with her; he gave
Stroheim $800.000 and the freedom
to shoot (more or less) whatever he
wanted. But Swanson hated the ma
terial, and she grew distrustful and
then frightened of Stroheim.
Stroheim. like Griffith, spun his
movies off traditional melodrama:
hut whereas Griffith invested these
Victorian elements with a rich emo
tional spectrum, Stroheim trans
formed them by turning them per
verse and acrid. In "Queen Kelly."
Swanson plays a sweet Irish convent
lass who wins the love of a prince
(Walter Byron) and the fury of his
fiancee, the mad Queen Regina

(Seena Owen). (No one explains
satisfactorily what an Irish maiden is
doing in a mythical European
kingdom called Kronberg.) When
Regina finds them together, she
throws Kelly out ot the palace and
imprisons Prince Wolfram: Kelly tries
to drown herself but is rescued and
