# Stroheim's 'Queen Kelly' restored to original form
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG Editorial staff 
By the time Erich von Stroheim
went to work on "Queen Kelly." his
career was already in a shambles. His
extravagance and lunatic attention to
naturalistic detail (he fitted a house
with full electric lighting for a single
long shot in "Greed") had alienated
him from Hollywood moguls such as
Irving Thalberg, who supervised the
cutting of "Greed" to approximately
one-quarter its intended length. And
his dictatorial hand with actors had
made him extremely unpopular; doz
ens of stories have accumulated
around his name, stories of gross in
sensitiv ity to actors and unreasonable
demands made of them. That he was
a genius seems undeniable, though
none of his movies, including the
amazing, chopped-up "Greed," is
very likable, and the relentless, ironic
vision they share of man as a creature
capable of and in fact delighting in

the most revolting excesses, coupled
with the excesses of the style levied
upon it. might well belong to a gifted
mudmun.
"Queen Kelly." shot in 1928. had a
particularly weird set of components.
It starred Gloria Swanson. and was
produced hy the young Joe Kennedy,
who was in love with her; he gave
Stroheim $800.000 and the freedom
to shoot (more or less) whatever he
wanted. But Swanson hated the ma
terial, and she grew distrustful and
then frightened of Stroheim.
Stroheim. like Griffith, spun his
movies off traditional melodrama:
hut whereas Griffith invested these
Victorian elements with a rich emo
tional spectrum, Stroheim trans
formed them by turning them per
verse and acrid. In "Queen Kelly."
Swanson plays a sweet Irish convent
lass who wins the love of a prince
(Walter Byron) and the fury of his
fiancee, the mad Queen Regina

(Seena Owen). (No one explains
satisfactorily what an Irish maiden is
doing in a mythical European
kingdom called Kronberg.) When
Regina finds them together, she
throws Kelly out ot the palace and
imprisons Prince Wolfram: Kelly tries
to drown herself but is rescued and
sails for Africa to care for a dying
aunt who runs a brothel. On her
deathbed, the aunt persuades the
meek, obedient Kelly to marry a
living nightmare named Jan (Tully
Marshall), a syphilitic, sex-crazed
monster â€” and. according to the
shooting script Stroheim prepared,
she goes on to take over the brothel
(living apart from Jan. who finally
gets killed) and is eventually
reconciled to her prince.
Nothing past the brothel wedding
scene was ever filmed, however, be
