Lloyd Cole and the Commotions —
Rattlesnakes ★ ★ ★ ★
You need this album. 1 just
wanted to make my point clear
before I went any further with this
review, so that those of you who
like to skim the paper will not miss
the best album I have reviewed thus
far. Admittedly, my career spans
only three records at this point, but
"Rattlesnakes" has those qualities
which allow a record to endure
repeated listening (and such lavish
praise). The lyrics are clever, so
despite the thematic emphasis on
troubled relationships, one never
grows weary of hearing the next
episode of Lloyd Cole s romantic
trials. The music has a country
flavor, but could not be termed
country music; it is simple, yet en
gaging. Acoustic guitars and other
natural instruments are used to give
the music character. More impor
tant, this character is used to
complement the lyrics instead of to
hide them — a use which many

other artists have forgotten. The
simple melodies are thickened with
skillful string arrangements which
manage to remain unobtrusive
most of the time. Finally, this al
bum is consistent. One can find
fault with certain aspects of individ
ual songs, such as slightly overbear
ing strings, but the album as a
whole is uniformly engaging. Buy it
and enhance your enjoyment of
spring quarter.

Prince and the Revolution
— Around The World In A Day
★ ★ ★ ★
Wow. A new Prince album. The
kind of album that if you call any
record store and ask, "Is it in?"
they know what you're referring to.
No release since "Born In The
U.S.A." has been accompanied
with as much anticipation. As
with so many long-awaited new
releases, fans are bound to be
dismayed at first: Few dance tracks
are comparable to those in the past,
the musical style has adopted a
psychedelic, Hendrixesque side,
and the songs seem less together
than before. But don't worry! It's
OK! Come back! Prince's new di
rection may not be the stuff that
Top 40 is made of right now, but it
sure beats another conservative
sound-the-same, sell-the-same
follow-up. By releasing an uncon
ventional record in the midst of
nationwide Purple Overdose,
Prince just might restore critics'

confidence and force some ex
perimentation on the part of radio
playlists. The apparent lack of di
rection goes away eventually,
leaving behind a more thoughtful,
satisfying side of the music. The
lyrics are as always, though, for the
first time. Prince clearly puts salva
tion before temptation. (This can
be a relief when grownups are lis
tening. ) A sax, various percussion,
and strings by and large replace the
dominant synth and bass-funk
parts, though the usual electric
drums and screech guitar still
prevail. All in all, the alienated fans
and nervous record company exec
utives have it all wrong. Prince has
dug himself out of the hole that
mass popularity creates; the al
bum's experimentation, even if less
attractive at first, is nevertheless a
refreshing alternative to its
predecessors.

Stanley Jordan —
The Magic Touch ★ ★ ★ ★
When Stanley Jordan played the
Coffee House here last spring, the
place was fuller than ever before,
packed with people who came for
coffee and stayed for the music
coming from Stanley's 10 fingers
and guitar. Since then he has jus
tifiably taken the world of jazz by
storm. His new release on the Blue
Note label showcases his advanced
two-handed tapping techniques.
What Eddie Van Halen used as a

gimmick. Jordan uses as a whole
new way of playing. But he is not
just a master technician: he is also a
skilled soloist and a sensitive
musician (in contrast to Al
DiMeola, who produced "The
Magic Touch"). The album opens
with a beautiful rendition of
"Eleanor Rigby." with Stanley
solo, as is most of the album, al
though percussionists and bassists
appear here and there. The only
weak point of the record is Michael
Jackson's "The Lady in My Life."
played in the bland pop-jazz style
of Grover Washington or Earl
Klugh. which acts as poor filler.
However, Stanley follows this with
a brilliant cover of Jimi Hendrix's
"Angel" and wraps up the album
with a pair of fine originals and
Thad Jones' "A Child Is Born." It's
a must for jazz fans and highly rec
ommended for those who like good
instrumentals a la (but better than)
Windham Hill.

Prince just might restore critics'

confidence and force some ex
perimentation on the part of radio
playlists. The apparent lack of di
rection goes away eventually,
leaving behind a more thoughtful,
satisfying side of the music. The
lyrics are as always, though, for the
first time. Prince clearly puts salva
tion before temptation. (This can
be a relief when grownups are lis
tening. ) A sax, various percussion,
and strings by and large replace the
dominant synth and bass-funk
parts, though the usual electric
drums and screech guitar still
prevail. All in all, the alienated fans
and nervous record company exec
utives have it all wrong. Prince has
dug himself out of the hole that
mass popularity creates; the al
bum's experimentation, even if less
attractive at first, is nevertheless a
refreshing alternative to its
predecessors.

Stanley Jordan —
The Magic Touch ★ ★ ★ ★
When Stanley Jordan played the
Coffee House here last spring, the
place was fuller than ever before,
packed with people who came for
coffee and stayed for the music
coming from Stanley's 10 fingers
and guitar. Since then he has jus
tifiably taken the world of jazz by
storm. His new release on the Blue
Note label showcases his advanced
two-handed tapping techniques.
What Eddie Van Halen used as a

gimmick. Jordan uses as a whole
new way of playing. But he is not
just a master technician: he is also a
skilled soloist and a sensitive
musician (in contrast to Al
DiMeola, who produced "The
Magic Touch"). The album opens
with a beautiful rendition of
"Eleanor Rigby." with Stanley
solo, as is most of the album, al
though percussionists and bassists
appear here and there. The only
weak point of the record is Michael
Jackson's "The Lady in My Life."
played in the bland pop-jazz style
of Grover Washington or Earl
Klugh. which acts as poor filler.
However, Stanley follows this with
a brilliant cover of Jimi Hendrix's
"Angel" and wraps up the album
with a pair of fine originals and
Thad Jones' "A Child Is Born." It's
a must for jazz fans and highly rec
ommended for those who like good
instrumentals a la (but better than)
Windham Hill.
