'Breaking With Moscow"
B\ Arkady Shevchenko
Knopf, 378 pp., $18.95.
Security is a strange word. We all
want security, whether it he on a na
tional level or an individual level. The
primary purpose of security is to alle
viate fear. But as a country, we have
failed to erase the fear, as we con
tinue to translate security into
massive weapons of unthinkable
destruction. We are not alone in this
preparation for suicide: The Soviet
Union is busy doing the same thing.
Arkady Shevchenko wanted secur
ity in his own way, and he got it after
a long struggle. He is lucky; many
others like him have tried and will
continue to try to leave the Soviet
Union, and most will be unsuccessful.
Shevchenko"s story, unfortunately, is
almost too good to leave untold —
this is America, and he is now a so
called free man. Hut in telling his
story, becoming famous and prob
ably making quite a load of money,
he overlooks an important point: His
book enhances his own security at the
expense of the reader's. His book
makes the reader feel more insecure
about the Soviet system and its moti
vations. "Breaking With Moscow"
will, no doubt, convince some people
that President Reagan is correct in his
appraisal of the Soviet Union as "an
evil empire." Many Americans will
conclude after reading the book that
the money the United States pours
into the arms race is necessary, that
the Soviet Union described in Shev
chenko* s book is dangerous and must
be tamed. If this is the case, 1 would
argue, this man might have done
everyone a favor by keeping his story
to himself.
The author begins his book with an

intense scene on the Oueensboro
Bridge (in a traffic jam. of course), on
his way to one man\ secret meetings
with his American saviors. One has
no choice but to continue reading
page after page; the suspense leaves
one begging for more. I. in fact, had
to actually put the book down and
look at it in mv hands periodically,
j ust to make sure that Shevchenko
did get safely away. He does not,
however, as in all "well-told" stories,
let the reader know whether or not he
makes it until later on in the book. In
other words, keep reading.
Shevchenko then begins his autobi
ography. His childhood: spoiled (as
he puts it), comfortable and
seemingly without trauma: "1 became
patriotic, taking pride in my young
pioneer duties, convinced that every
thing good was born with the revolu
tion. Since kindergarten, my
schoolmates and I had been in
doctrinated to that effect every day."
I have thoughts of young George
Washington chopping down a cherry
tree (he could not tell a lie); Ben
jamin Franklin discovering electricity
with a kite and key; Thomas Jeffer
son at his desk quilling the Declara
tion of Independence by candlelight.
How serious were the effects of these
examples of American indoctrination
on me?"
Shevchenko is nonetheless content,
and seemingly a good Soviet citizen,
until his 10th year, when he-has
"doubts" about his country. He re
members his father scolding him for
"openingly criticizing the Russian
Army" at school; it seems that one of
his classmates was acting as an infor
mant. In any case, the author says he
tames his anti-Soviet instincts soon
enough, and he is later admitted to
the Moscow State Institute of Inter
nation Relations, a place of "strict

discipline and heavy indoctrination."
There he becomes a Soviet intellec
tual.
Upon finishing his studies at the in
stitute. he is hired by the Foreign
Ministry in Moscow, then given a job
in the United Nations. He sees the
dynamism of New York for the first
time, and the temptations of Western
life draw him in. He and his wife en
joy all of the extra luxuries of
America until he is called back to the
Soviet Union, where he is ap
proached by Andrei Gromyko. He
soon becomes one of the foreign min
ister's most trusted advisers. He does
not, however, forget the niceties of
the United States. It is while working
for Gromyko that Shevchenko

realizes he cannot be the idealistic
peacemaker he once dreamed of
being. He discovers the contradic
tions and inconsistencies of the Soviet
system: the style of power politics
that he learns to hate; the constant
watch on him by the KGB; too much
bureauracy that moves too slowly.
His doubt about Soviet intentions in
the world political are on the rise, and
it is at this time when he is sent back
to the United States as under secre
tary
In the United Nations, Shevchenko
constantly grapples with the fact that
most of his staff are really KGB men
working under phony titles. He also
questions his country's intentions
there. He decides to defect. Why?

The reason Shevchenko constantly
stresses is the oppressive nature of
the Soviet system: his own conscience
bothered him. Thus, he bargains with
some Americans, promising at first to
be a "reluctant" spy for the United
States for an unspecified period of
time in exchange for his eventual ref
uge. As the day for his move ap
proaches. however, he is suddenly
called back to Moscow for un
determined reasons. Frightened, he
hastily leaves his sleeping wife a note,
a note which tells her for the first time
what he has been planning and where
he is now going, and then he sneaks
off into American freedom.
But how can an educated Soviet
diplomat, fully aware of the danger
ous and übiquitous KGB. leave his
wife behind? He later learns of her
death — suicide, according to the
Soviets — and in his epilogue he
describes his shock and disbelief. 1
find his feelings suspicious. Shev
chenko cannot be called an honorable
man. surely having known that in
leaving his wife to the KGB. he was.
in essence, leaving her to die.
It also disturbs me that his book
only criticizes the Soviet system,
without offering any analysis or eval
uation of the American system. To
be sure, he more than once marvels at
the quantity and quality of American
consumer goods, "clothing, stereos,
medicines and appliances." Are these
the things tha,t attracted him. or was it
"democracy"? He argues the latter,
of course, but the way he is living his
new life here suggests that he knew
his chances for material prosperity in
the United States were high. If that is
the case, his book, while interesting
and informative, fails to do what he
says he set out to do. Its ideological
content is muddy.
If his goal is to "warn of the

dangers they (members of the Soviet
ruling elite) present to the world, his
hook does it very well. It is a well
written piece that no novelist could
match. It also contains many insight
ful profiles of high-ranking Soviet of
ficials. past and present. And it otters
us a rare view of the usually opaque
insides of the Soviet government. 1
would argue, though, that it is
impossible to tell this story without
instilling, as Shevchenko says,
"feelings of hostility in Americans
toward the Soviet people." for the
simple reason that the book only
solidifies America's fears about the
Soviet Union. It may not have been
Shevchenko's intent to frighten his
reader, but he does.
In his foreward. Shevchenko states:
"1 hope also, in however small a way,
to help the Soviet people eventually
find their way to liberty." These are
words which, in my opinion, are
either overly idealistic or else just
plain empty. His book only reminds
the Soviet Union that it is vulnerable
to ugly exposure: it will encourage
Soviet officials to tighten their secur
ity so as to prevent others from fol
lowing in Shevchenko's footsteps.
It is not //iv purpose in this review
to instill feelings of hostility in
Americans toward Arkady Shev
chenko. but his book leaves me with
too many doubts and unanswered
questions. Whatever the author's true
intent might be. 1 find it hard to
believe that he is doing anything but
capitalizing (pun intended) on his ad
venture. His story and the way he has
successfully sold it to the world have
made him a true capitalist; I can only
wonder about the prices he has paid
to acquire his newly found material
wealth in the United States.
