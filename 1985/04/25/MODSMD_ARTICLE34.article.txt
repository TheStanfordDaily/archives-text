## Vandals deface Israel banners 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
Banners and signs throughout
campus promoting Israel Week were
found defaced with Palestine Libera
tion Organization (PLO) slogans yes
terday.
Michael Bunzel, chairman of the
Israel Action Committee, the group
that made the banners and a sponsor
of Israel Week, said he could under
stand dissent but not vandalism.
One banner, which was attached to
a fence at the corner of Scrra Street
and El Camino Real, had "PLO"
spray painted on it. PLO flags sur
rounded the banner, but two men
were seen tearing them down yester
day afternoon, according to a witness
who asked not to be identified.
Bunzel did not specifically blame
any individuals or organization, but

did cite the Committee for Justice in
the Middle East (COJME) as the
"only group who oppose us."
"If there is one group who would
do it, it would he them," he said.
"Many of them are Palestinian," he
said.
John Rosenblum, a member of
COJME, said he has "absolutely no
idea" who defaced the banners.
"Just because we are an organiza
tion that deals with Palestinian rights
doesn't mean we have anything to do
with that," Rosenblum said. "It has
nothing to do with us," he said.
Michael Mavlan of the Palo Alto
Police Department said no report of
the incident has yet been filed.
A rally is planned for today at noon
in White Plaza commemorating the
37th anniversary of the founding of
Israel.

"They have turned a cultural
celebration into something that might
have political ramifications." Bunzel
said of the vandals.
Bunzel said his committee is
replacing the banners, but is not
taking down the flags. He acknowl
edged his opponents' right to protest
his committee's beliefs and said he
would not deny their right to speak
out at today's rally.
Bunzel, though he said he is "not
accusing" COJME, said he questions
the tactics of those who defaced the
banners.
"My committee has approached
the Palestinian groups to have discus
sions on the Palestinian question,"
Bunzel said. He added that COJME
continues to "evade our questions
just as the PLO has in the Middle
East."

recent vandalism. Late yesterday, a witness said two men removed the flag of the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization, which was to the left of the Independence Day banner.
