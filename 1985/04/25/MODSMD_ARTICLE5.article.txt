### DANNY PEARL Staff writer 
The Stanford chapter of the Pi Beta Phi sorority
was put on probation yesterday, pending investiga
tion of alleged hazing incidents at its bid acceptance
party last Wednesday.
i tie allegations mark the first time a Stanford
sorority lias been charged with hazing, according to
Row Director Diana Conklin. "The worst thing I
know of a sorority doing since 11>77l l >77 is disrupting
Meyei I ibrary by singing." she said.
The Intersorority Council (ISC) lias agreed to
conduct the investigation. I'ntil it is completed and
acted upon by the I'ni\ersity. Pi Phis will be barred
from any social activities and will be allowed to
hold business meetings only.
Pi Phi President Jennifer Matuschek. Rush
Chairmen Katie I azar and Jean Meyer and Pledge
Trainer Mary Dungan all declined to comment yes
terdav on the charges and the Universitv's decision.

At Wednesday's party, pledges were taken to an
off-campus bar. to the Mausoleum and finally to
the Boat house. Conklin said. "According to what is
being alleged, there was extraordinarily heavy
drinking by many Pi Phi pledges, and at this point
it's not clear whether it was forced, coerced, en
couraged or allowed.
"Apparently several people were quite seriously
drunk, to the point where they could barely stand."
Conklin said.
flic Pi Phis were informed of the probation deci
sion b\ Conklin and Norm Robinson, associate
dean of Student Affairs for Residential Hdueation.
at a special meeting yesterday afternoon. Robinson
handed Matuschek a letter explaining Ins decision.
"I take this extraordinary measure because it is
clear that, it the allegations are true. Pi Beta Phi
has demonstrated an alarming inability to govern
its own affairs responsibly and with due regard for
the safetx and well-being ol Stanford students."

Robinson saitl in the letter.
The letter also said the University "will not
tolerate I hazing |. nor will we continue to offer
recognition to am group which engages in it."
The California Kducation ( ode defines hazing as
any activity "which causes, or is likely to cause,
bodily danger, physical harm or personal degrada
tion or disgrace resulting in physical or mental
harm, to any student."
C'onklin noted that even unforced drinking can
constitute hazing, and that the activity need not he
associated with initiation functions.
C'onklin would not sa\ who initially informed her
of the alleged hazing incidents. She did sa\ that res
idents ol Rohlc Hall had prepared a small damage
bill for cleaning bathrooms after several l'i I'lm got
sick in the dorm.
"Normallv. if someone throws up. the\ clean
after themselves," said Mary Cath
erine Fish, a resident assistant at
Roble. "The Pi Phis came into the
house, threw up, and didn't clean it
\ up. We didn't feel it was right for the
maids to have to clean it up."
Robinson confirmed that he had

heard complaints from Roble resi
dents.
On Friday, Robinson asked Steve
Leonhart, Stanford's acting fraternal
affairs adviser, to conduct a prelimi
nary investigation into the hazing
charges to determine if University ac
tion was warranted.
Leonhart said he talked to several
Pi Phis about the charges. "The Pi
Phis' response has been superb,"
Leonhart said. "They are really trying

to turn this into a learning experi
ence, especially for their new
pledges."
Leonhart said he has heard reports
of possible misconduct by two other
sororities during bid parties and has
warned their pledge trainers. "From
what we've heard, the problems with
these sororities were not as serious.
There was not as much heavy drink
ing, and there was not as much pres
sure to drink," he said.
