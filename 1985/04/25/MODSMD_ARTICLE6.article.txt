I he first Stanford scientist to he of
fered financing by the Reagan admin
istration's "Stiii Wars" program yes
terday s;tid I 'diversity policy barring
classified research might prevent him
from accepting the funds.
Joseph (ioodman. professor ol
electrical engineering and leader of a
research team seeking to develop
high-speed computers, said "there
wasn't an inkling that a in ol this re
search would be restricted" when he
submitted his proposal earlier tins
year.
Hut after a New York limes
reporter contacted him lucsday and
suggested some of the research might
be classified, (ioodman had some

questions of his own.
"I'm concerned about the strings
tliat might be attached ... and
whether the contracts will be free and
unclassified." (ioodman said yester
day . "I had requested funding only
. . . for some very basic research."
Stanford has not allowed classified
research since 1970.
(ioodman's remarks came in the
wake of a Department of Defense
(DoD) announcement lucsday that
the Pentagon was funding a nine
memher consortium of research
facilities to develop specialized com
puters for use in space weapons. Ini
tially. the group, which includes Sum
lord. w as to be giv en a total of $9 mil
lion over three \ears to develop

"what are essentially far-out' ideas."
(ioodman said.
Star Wars. w liich is formally know 11
as the Strategic Defense Initiative, in
volves research to develop a space
based. non-nuclear defense system
that administration officials sav
would act as a shield against ,t nuclear
missile attack. Some leading scientists
have charged that the plan is not
technically feasible.
The development of high-speed
"supercomputers" lias been des
cribed as especially important it a
Star Wars system is to distinguish in
coming missiles from decoys.
(ioodman. w ho said he is " the only
person at Stanford" working on opti
cal computers, has joined researchers
