Brazilian president-elect buried
SAO JOAO DEL. REI, Brazil — President-elect Tancredo Neves was
buried last night in a solemn candle-lit ceremony in the town where he
began a 50-year political career that brought him to the brink of power.

Bells tolled as the flag-draped coffin of the popular leader, who died
Sunday, was carried to a small cemetary behind 211-year-old St. Francis
ol Assisi Church to be buried alongside the graves of his father and
mother.
"On this cold night. Brazil returns to the blessed earth of Sao Joao del
Rei the body of one of the greatest men in its history," Sarney said.
"Tancredo Neves leaves this nation a great legacy. He leaves the
legacy of his love for the people, his tolerance, his conciliation and his
greatness in public life," Sarney said.
'"But his battle for democratic ideals will continue, his dreams will be
our dreams, this is our pledge. Tancredo Neves, in the name of all Brazil,
good-bye forever. We will miss you."
Trumpets and the shots of a 21-gun salute rang through the night as
the flag was lifted from the coffin and it was lowered into its grave.
Neves died Sunday of an uncontrolled bacterial infection and compli
cations from seven operations. He was first hospitalized March 14, hours
before his Scheduled inauguration as Brazil's first civilian leader in 21

Israelis pull out of Bekaa Valley
GHAZE, Lebanon— Columns of Israeli soldiers yesterday pulled out
of positions in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, where they have confronted
Syrian troops lor nearly three years.
Lebanese troops moved into some areas the Israelis vacated as part of
a withdrawal from Lebanese soil, to be completed by June 1. Yester
day's pullout removed Israeli soldiers from about 300 square miles of
the country they have occupied since the invasion of June 6, 1982.
The Lebanese army command in Beirut reported its 1,000-man,
Syrian-trained Ist Brigade moved south through the Bekaa in a four
pronged advance behind the departing Israelis.
The command reported the Israeli pullout began at 7 a.m.
Syrian forces, who have controlled the northern Bekaa region since
1976, gave no indication they would advance into the abandoned Israeli
positions.
"The Syrians will certainly try to increase their pressure on Lebanon
after our withdrawal," said Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Moshe Levy, speak
ing in Marjayoun. "But Israel will remain vigilant to prevent them
breaking the status quo. We have adequate answers to any of their
moves."
The Israeli withdrawal raised fears of new fighting between Lebanon's
Moslems and Maronite Christians.
Fight continues over Bitburg visit
WASHINGTON — President Reagan was rebuffed in his appeal to
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to scrap a visit to a German mili
tary cemetery, according to a report yesterday.
The planned visit has drawn criticism, particularly from American
Jewish leaders and veterans groups
The New York Daily News reported that Reagan had talked to Kohl,
making a '"direct" appeal to cancel the Bitburg stop in a 20-minute tele
phone conversation last Friday. The News quoted an unidentified ad
ministration official as saying Kohl refused to budge.
The official, asked whether the presidential request had been explicit,
said. "Oh, ves ... it was direct. . . . We tried. . . . Kohl won't move."
The New York l imes said today a private message was sent to Kohl
from the White House urging Kohl to seek an alternative to the May 5
visit.
The Times, citing unidentified White House officials, said the
message, sent during the weekend, was signed either by National Secur
ity Advisor Robert McFarlane or one of McFarlane's aides. Reagan was
"irritated" about the letter, it said.
rhe Washington Post quoted Republican political strategists as saying
there is strong consensus among them that Reagan should abandon
plans to lav a wreath at Bitburg. Strategists said Nancy Reagan had
private!) expressed concern about the cemetery visit and indicated she
would like to end the controversy, the Post said.
White House Deputy Press Secretary Robert Sims said Tuesday night:
•' There's no change in the schedule and no planning for a change."
\sked whether a message had been sent from the White House to
kohl on the Bitburg issue. Sims said he had no information about any
such message.
I he choice of Bitburg drew especially sharp criticism because the
2.ooograves include 47 members of the elite SS corps, which staffed the
concentration camps where millions ol Jews and others were killed
during World War 11.
Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) said Reagan should
cancel the visit. Interviewed on the NBC-TV "Today" show. Dole said
he "made it clear that I think it's a mistake. 1 think they should find an
other place or not make the Bitburg visit."
Dole noted that several senators, led In Howard Metzenbaum (D-
Oh.). want to bring up to the floor a resolution formally expressing "our
concern" about the Bitburg visit.
"I don't think that's necessary." Dole s;iid. "but I would hope the
president could find some way to find an alternate site or to cancel the
\ isit."
Meanwhile, a poll indicated more than half of those surveyed opposed
the cemetery visit.
An ABC News-Washington Post poll released Tuesday said of 1.019
people from across the country, selected randomly and interviewed by
telephone Monday night. 51 percent disapproved of the president's plan.
According to the survey. 39 percent favored the \isit. and the
remainder had no opinion. The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 3.5
percentage points.
