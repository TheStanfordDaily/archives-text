# House kills rebel assistance
## 
### 
W ASHINGTON â€” The House last night killed
all U.S. assistance to the Contra rebels in
Nicaragua, dramatically rejecting both Republican
and Democratic compromises in handing President
Reagan a major foreign policy defeat.
Three separate votes on the House floor cul
minated in a congressional decision to halt the
president's three-year campaign to undermine the
leftist Sandinista government in Managua.
Reagan said he was "deeply disappointed" by
the House vote, adding. "This kind of action dama
ges national security and foreign policy goals."
Vowing not to give up. Reagan said. "I intend to
return to the Congress again and again to seek a
policy that supports peace and democracy in
Nicaragua. The United States will continue to work
for these goals."
A Democratic alternative providing aid for
Nicaraguan refugees and financial support for a
peacekeeping force during a future cease-fire was
passed once, then defeated in the final House vote.
Reagan had made significant concessions in his
original plan to give the Contras direct military as
sistance to be funnelled through the Central Intelli
gence Agency. The Senate on Tuesday had gone
along with a Republican proposal to give the Con
tras $14 million after Reagan pledged to use the
money for non-lethal assistance only and to
negotiate directly with the Sandinistas.
Nonetheless, he fell two votes short on the Re
publican House proposal and thus lost the toughest
congressional battle of his second term. That killed
any prospect of U.S. aid for the rightist rebels,
which was suspended by Congress last year, unless
the lawmakers change their mind in the future.
While the final vote on the Nicaraguan issue was

decided by a wide margin. 303-123. the critical
vote on a Republican alternative was decided by
only two votes. 215-213.
As the outcome became clear, there was cheer
ing among Democrats on the floor. And House
members who had battled the president's Central
American policies openly hugged one another.
In futile appeal. House Minority Leader Robert
Michel (R -111.) quoted House Speaker I homas
"Tip O'Neill (D-Mass.) as saying Democrats
should vote their conscience tree ot party loyalties.
The president had lobbied heavily tor the aid
package. Last Saturday. in his weekly radio address
to the nation. Reagan said the Democratic proposal
that would have eliminated aid to the Contras "is
not a compromise: it's a shameful surrender."
"The Soviet terrorist bloc nations know what is
at stake in Nicaragua." Reagan said. "That's why in
the seven months since Congress cut off aid to the
democratic resistance, they've been pouring in
weapons and personnel to their communist allies
hoping to wipe out the democratic forces while
they're most vulnerable."
The House Republican alternative reluctantly
supported by Reagan and drafted by Minority
leader Robert Michel (R-III.) would have allowed
the president to spend $14 million on non-lethal
assistance to the insurgents. The funds would have
been administered by the U.S. Agency for Interna
tional Development, not the Central Intelligence
Agency, which has been supporting the rebel army.
The House votes came on the second day of
debate on the divisive Nicaraguan issue. On Tues
day, the House rejected Reagan's original plan to
provide direct military aid to the Contras seeking to

overthrow the leftist Sandinista government.
There were four House votes in all. After Tues
day's 248-180 rejection of the Reagan plan, the
House voted yesterday 219-206 for the Demo
cratic alternative: 215-213 against the GOP com
promise that would have superceded the Demo
cratic plan: and then 303-123 against the Demo
cratic plan which was up for final consideration.
The Democratic alternative, which seeks to shift
the focus of U.S. policy away from the rightist Con
tras supported In Reagan since 1981. has been
sharply attacked In the president.
The plan specifically prohibits any military help
for the Contras and provides for eventual economic
sanctions, encourages negotiations among nations
in the Central American region and would give
speed) handling In Congress to a future Reagan
proposal for Contra assistance if the Sandinistas
refused to negotiate seriously toward an end to the!
civil war.
The mone) for the refugees would be adminis
tered In either the United Nations High Commis
sioner for Refugees or the International Red Cross.
The proposal would give no diplomatic or politi
cal recognition to the Contras, a key element in
Reagan's Central American policy.
In a letter to House GOP leader Michel.
Reagan said the proposal would encourage the
Contras "to leave Nicaragua and become refugees
in other countries."
Moreover, the president said, "it relieves pres
sure on the Sandinistas while at the same time, it
increases the burdens on the neighboring
democracies."
