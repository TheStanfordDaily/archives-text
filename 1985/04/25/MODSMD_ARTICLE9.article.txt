# Reagan seeks public support for budget

### 
WASHINGTON — President
Reagan implored Americans last
night to deluge Congress — "by
phone, wire or mailgram" — with
support for a Republican budget that
would trim Social Security increases
and kill popular programs.
'•Our future is too precious to per
mit this crucial effort to be picked
apart, piece by piece, by the special
interest groups," he said.
In a nationally broadcast address
from the Oval Office, Reagan quoted
John F. Kennedy's famous inaugural
appeal: "Ask not what your country
can do for you; ask what you can do
for your country."
"We stand at a crossroads," the
president said. "The hour is late. The
task is large. The stakes are momen
tous. I ask you to join us in making
your voices heard in the Senate this
week and later in the House."
The speech came as the Senate
postponed until tomorrow the begin
ning of debate on the budget package
that both Reagan and Senate Repub
lican laders have endorsed. It would
slash nearly $300 billion from ex
pected deficits over three years with
out raising taxes. The goal is to bring
the deficit below $ 100 billion by 1988
without raising taxes.
The Republican program would
eliminate, freeze or reduce dozens of
popular domestic programs, including
Amtrak, the Small Business Adminis
tration and farm subsidies.
Senate Minority Leader Robert
Byrd of West Virginia, delivering a

broadcast Democratic response,
claimed Reagan "has not offered a
solid financial plan for America's
future."
*"His program shortchanges the
future, by seriously undermining edu
cation and medical and scientific re
search and education . . . and the
president breaks his own promises to
our nation's elderly," Byrd said, re
ferring to Reagan's campaign state
ments opposing Social Security bene
fit cuts.

'The simple truth is, no matter how
hard you work ... it won't amount to
a hill of beans if government won't
curb its endless appetite to spend.'

Byrd said that Democrats "want to
address the deficit problem in a fair
way that inspires the faith of our
people and reassures their percep
tions about the fairness of their gov
ernment."
Reagan insisted that the solution to
America's economic problems is to
cut away at government spending. He
said:
"All the progress, all the good
we've accomplished so far and all our
dreams for the future could be
wrecked if we do net overcome our
one giant obstacle. The simple truth
is, no matter how hard you work, no
matter how strong this economy

grows, no matter how much more tax
money comes to Washington, it won't
amount to a hill of beans if govern
ment won't curb its endless appetite
to spend."
With Congress deeply divided over
how to cut massive deficits. Senate
Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-
Kan.) said in advance of Reagan's ad
dress: "I think he needs to scare us a
bit. We're all running around like we
have a big (budget) surplus — don't
cut this, don't cut that."

In his speech. Reagan told
Americans the nation faces "a serious
problem that demands your immedi
ate attention."
With the national debt approaching
$2 trillion. Reagan said the per capita
debt amounts to nearly $8,000 for
each American and is increasing
about $1,000 per person each year.
The interest on the debt amounts to
$155 billion now, he added.
"This is not just my problem: this is
not just Congress' problem; this is
our problem — and we must solve it
together as Americans," Reagan said.
Reagan said, "Please tell your
senators and representatives, by

phone, wire or mailgram. that our'
future hangs in the balance, that this
is no time for partisanship and that
our future is too precious to permit
this crucial effort to be picked apart,
piece by piece, by the special interest
groups. We've got to put the public
interest first."
Excerpts of Reagan's address — his
first broadcast speech from the Oval
Office in his second term — were
released in advance by the White
House.
Republicans are worried that many
of the cuts will give Democrats strong
political ammunition for next year's
elections. Plans are being drafted by
Republicans and Democrats alike to
salvage varrtws programs targeted for
extinction, deep spending cuts Or
freezes, and to protect Social Secur
ity.
GOP leaders indicated the package
lacks majority support in the
Republican-ruled Senate. "We don't
have a great surplus of votes." Dote
acknowledged.
The GOP plan, cutting $52 billion
in the next fiscal year from a deficit
expected to exceed $200 billion,
would eliminate programs such as the
Job Corps and subsidies for Amtrak
rail passenger service, and provide
Social Security increases of 2 percent
annually for the next three years —
which is less than the expected 4 per
cent increase in inflation.
Any increase in inflation above 4
percent would be matched by higher
Social Security benefits.
