Bishops knock tax plan
WASHINGTON — A Treasury Department
proposal to curb Americans' tax deductions for
charitable gifts is "an unwarranted assault" on
the nation's entire concept of giving, the leader of
U.S. Roman Catholic bishops is telling President
Reagan.
"I call upon you to reject these parts of the
Treasury tax proposals," Bishop James Malone
of Youngstown, Ohio, said in letter to Reagan.
The correspondence was released yesterday by
the National Conference of Catholic Bishops,
which Malone heads.
Malone noted that the Treasury plan, an
nounced last November but still not approved by
the White House, would allow taxpayers to claim
deductions only for charitable gifts above 2 per
cent of their adjusted gross income. A deduction
for gifts by non-itemizing taxpayers would be
dropped altogether.
Although Treasury officials estimate such
changes would increase charitable donors' tax
payments by $8.5 billion, Malone said, actual
donations would probably decline even more. He
cited one private estimate of a $ 13 billion drop in
annual contributions.
He said such a drop would severely cramp
charitable activities of the Catholic Church and
other organizations. And he added, "Mr. Presi
dent, 1 believe these Treasury proposals are in
consistent with the stated policy of your adminis

tration ... to encourage voluntary, private ac
tion."
On such policy grounds, he said he trusted
"that you will conclude, as I have, that (the
proposals) represent an unwarranted assault
upon our historical national commitment to en
courage charitable giving."
Plane passengers panic
ROMULUS, Mich. — Some of the 462 pas
sengers awaiting takeoff on a jetliner panicked
yesterday when they smelled smoke from a light
fixture and were told there was fire, and more
than three dozen people suffered minor injuries
evacuating the plane.
The Boeing 747 charter was ready for
departure from Detroit Metropolitan Airport for
Las Vegas when "a fluorescent light ballast be
hind a sidcwall panel failed (and) smoke from the
failure entered the passenger cabin," Walter
Johnson, executive vice president of National
Airlines, said.
The ballast is the part of a fluorescent light
fixture that regulates energy going to the light
producing gas.
"The passengers in the rear, when they heard
there was a fire, you could hear them panic," said
Dan Dell, 29, of Lansing, one of the jetliner's
passengers.

Why heart patient died
LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Jack Burcham, whose
10 days with an artificial heart were aggravated
by excessive bleeding and kidney failure, was
killed by a "jelly-like" blood clot that squeezed
part of the heart and interfered with its pumping,
doctors said yesterday.
The 62-year-old retired railroad engineer man
was the world's fifth and oldest recipient of the
permanent man-made heart. His life with the
device was the shortest. Three men with Jarvik-7
hearts are living.
Burcham's death came Wednesday night,
when doctors disconnected a respirator and the
heart's power system after realizing "there really
was nothing more we could do," implant surgeon
William DeVries said in a news conference.
Stocks make broad gain
A last-minute rally provided the stock market
with a decisive gain in moderate trading yester
day.
I hc Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose
6.29 to 1,284.78, with half the improvement
coming shortly before the closing bell.
Big Board volume swelled to 108.63 million
shares from 99.60 million in the previous session.
