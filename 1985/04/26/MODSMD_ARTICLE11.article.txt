State loses welfare cash
SACRAMENTO — California has lost $35
million in welfare money because of a federal or
der issued yesterday penalizing two dozen states
and Puerto Rico for errors in their hilling of child
welfare and Medicaid funds.
"We have a $5 billion AFDC payout, so $35
million will not create that mueh impact, espe
cially if the repayment can be spread out," said
Jack Germain, a spokesman for the Department
of Social Services. He was referring to the Aid to
Families With Dependent Children program, a
state-federal assistance effort for the poor.
"It is unlikely that the individual recipient will
ever feel any adverse impact from this," said
Germain, who added that California would
"probably" appeal the federal decision.
Condor plans change
SAN DIEGO — When they began snatching
California condor eggs from their nests three

years ago, researchers planned on releasing the
hatchlings into the wild in May 1985. Nature,
however, has not cooperated.
In the last year, the number of condors living in
the wild has dropped from 15 to nine, and plans
to set the 17 captive chicks free have been
replaced with plans to capture the remaining wild
birds in a last-ditch effort to save the condor from
extinction.
Caffeine findings told
ANAHEIM — A study of 10,064 people
treated for high blood pressure found chronic
users of caffeine were no more likely to die than
those who avoided coffee and tea, a researcher
said yesterday.
While doctors often advise such people to
reduce coffee consumption, "the level of caffeine
intake did not have an effect on mortality in this
group of hypertensive patients," said Jeanne
Martin, director of nutrition dietetics at the Uni
versity of Texas Health Science Center.

More lottery details
SACRAMENTO — The state Lottery Com
mission spelled out more details yesterday of
California's first "instant-winner" lottery, sched
uled for September.
But how many bids it gets on printing the 400
million instant-winner tickets will depend on
what the Legislature does, or docs not do about
disclosures required of lottery contractors.
The commission adopted "in concept" a 34-
page document, prepared by its staff, which tells
prospective ticket suppliers what they are bidding
on. Final adoption is scheduled for May 3, with
bids due by May 17 and the contract to be
awarded in June.
Today's weather

tomorrow, with patchy fog and highs in the mid
70s.
