## Practice makes perfect: job interviews and seniors 
### SANDRA BODOVITZ 
The door opens. The man in the
dark blue suit, coffee cup in hand,
reads the next name on his long list.
From the crowded waiting area, a
senior in a grey pin-striped suit
emerges. With a deep breath and a
quick glance at other seniors in other
suits, the ordeal begins. The dreaded
interview.
"It's scary but it gets easier. Now
it's only scary for the five minutes I'm
in the waiting room, then it's OK. and
sometimes it's even fun." said senior
Janet Lynch.
Christopher Shinkman, director of
the Career Planning and Placement
Center, agrees that it's possible to im
prove interviewing skills with experi
ence. "After four or five interviews,
students are more relaxed, poised and
generally more comfortable," he said.
But for those students who don't
want to wait until their fourth or fifth
interview to feel comfortable, the
CPPC offers interviewing workshops,
Shinkman said.
The interviewing workshops are
designed to familiarize students with
the types of questions they may be
asked and the kind of interview situa
tions they may be in. "Personnel
people are generally good inter
viewers but may not know the tech
nicalities of the job," Shinkman said.
The workshops also give students
an idea of what prospective
employers are looking for. "High on
an employer's list of desireable attri
butes are determination, motivation,
purpose, drive, how well you know
the organization and how badly you
want to work there," Shinkman said.
"You want to be able not to just say,
'1 possess these qualities,' but have
examples that demonstrate them.
Very specific examples are impor
tant."
Employers are generally pleased
with Stanford students, but
Shinkman stressed that this intitial
advantage "doesn't mean you can
walk in unprepared."
He explained, "Each interviewer is
going to see 13 people in a row, so
you're going head-to-head with 12
other Stanford students."
Competition for the precious 13 in
terview slots forced the CPPC to in
stitute a bid system for liberal arts
majors that provides each senior with
1,000 points to bid for interviews. The
system has been well-received by
employers and students alike.
"Employers like it because there are
few shoppers on their schedules,"
Shinkman said.
Senior Barry Lurie agreed. "If
you're going to bid 400 points, it
shows a commitment."
Some students also find it more
equitable. "It's certainly better than
the old system where people who

were willing to wait outside all night
got the best interviews," Lynch said.
"I personally have 960 points left;
I'm accepting offers."
Students, although pleased with the
hid system in general, expressed dis
satisfaction with the CPPC for not en
couraging more liberal arts employers
to interview here. "As a liberal arts
major, it's depressing when you see
droves of people coming in to inter
view engineers," Lynch said.
Senior Ed Swanson, who has never
interviewed through the CPPC, con
curred. "It seems that very little ef
fort is made to drum up public ser
vice opportunities. Owen House
could do it, but it should be more
coordinated."
Shinkman said the CPPC cannot
accommodate any more organiza
tions than it already does. "We have
500 organizations between October
and May, but we want to redistribute
that number. We are trying to get
more public service oraganizations,
but it's hard to do because they often
have no money to send recruiters."
The companies that do send

'You want to be
able not to just
say, "I possess
these qualities,"
but have examples
that demonstrate
them.'

recruiters have generally been
pleased with the CPPC, although one
complaint was voiced by several
employers: "It's a little bit noisy,"
said Proctor and Gamble's Jim Ret
tela.
Despite the strain of interviewing
13 people in one day, "We have a
good idea of what we're looking for,
and we can accomplish what we're
trying to do," Rettela said.
Steven Krieger, employment rep
resentative at PG&E, said that
through "extensive training of
recruiters" he felt it was possible to
use the half-hour interview slot effec
tively. "We try not to use canned
questions. We build on the informa
tion we get from the student," he
said. "We ask some technical ques
tions to assess a student's back
ground, and then we try to assess if
they'll do the job, what motivates
them, and if they'll fit in at PG&E,"
he said.
"Basically, the first interview is a
chance for us to assess if it's worth
our while to bring that person in for

an on-site interview," krieger said.
"Given the competitive situation,
we're looking for the best match in
each area. There may be a student
with a 4.0 who lacks interpersonal
skills and in some jobs here
employees need communication
skills," he added.
trie Wolfe, a recent graduate
who is now an interviewer for Crocker
Bank, expressed some doubts about
the effectiveness of the interviewing
process. "You come out with a very
superficial idea of the person. You
notice what they're wearing, if they're
excited,"' he said. "A lot of times it's
the skills of the interviewer that de
termine whether the interview goes
well or not."
Wolfe said Crocker concentrated
its recruiting effort at Stanford be
cause several Crocker employees
have Stanford ties and have been
happy with previously hired Stanford
students. "Stanford students appear
bright and personable in interviews
and are generally talented in some
area. " he said.
Because "no undergraduate will
have that much experience." Wolfe
said he concentrates more on "a
good mind and analytical abilities."
rather than on previous work experi
ence.
Wolfe emphasized the validity of
the "dress for success" adage. "Dress
is very important, given that you
don't have that long to find out about
a person. If you don't like their tie.it
may affect you in ways you don't even
know,"he said.
"It's important to look neat and
presentable,"' Krieger concurred. "It
it's a business interview, dress for a
business atmosphere.
"You're packaging yourself. . . .
You can be the same person and go
into it in jeans and sneakers or in a
three-piece suit and create two very
different images."
Although the CPPC is the place to
go for interviews, it also provides
other services. "Interviewing is an
important part of what we do, but I
sometimes worry that students think
that's all we do. People running
around in suits and ties are so obvious
. . . but career planning is also part of
our name. We have eight counselors
who spend the bulk of their time in
one-to-one counseling. 1 think with
our tuition, students have the right to
demand that one-to-one attention."
Many seniors do seem to be aware
of the other services the CPPC offers.
"I used the CPPC to send out my law
school recommendations and went
there to get literature on cover let
ters," Lurie said. Lynch said she used
the CPPC to "get my resume to
gether," and Swanson said he found a
resume-writing workshop to be help
ful.
