## THE
						STANFORD DAILY Sit-in must continue 
### 
The more than 1,000 students who partici
pated in divestment protests here this week have
spoken loudly and clearly. Their message has
been gaining momentum since October's
Motorola referendum. It is time for Stanford's
Board of Trustees to place human liberation
before profits. It is time for the University to
divest completely of its stock in companies that
do business with South Africa.
Thus far, neither the University administration
nor the board has responded to the students'
demands in a substantive manner. Therefore, the
divestment protest should continue.
The rallies and sit-in here this week have
driven home the feeling that, under current in
vestment policy, Stanford is a partner in the bru
tal oppression of more than 22 million South
Africans. As one student said yesterday, it is in
tolerable to finance a Stanford education with the
blood of South Africans.
By divesting of its stocks in companies that do
business in South Africa, Stanford can help bring
about greater justice and equality in that country.
At the same time, it would establish a moral code
to which the students could ascribe. Hundreds of
students have spent the last two days in front of
the President's Office to make that very point.
They have raised their voices, and for that they
command respect and support.
Indeed, student voices have been raised. But

have University President Donald Kennedy and
the trustees actually listened? What steps will
Kennedy and the board take to demonstrate their
willingness to act on the demands of the stu
dents? These are the questions on which atten
tion should be focused.
Kennedy indicated yesterday that anti
apartheid protest should be directed toward en
couraging legislative change in Washington, D.C.
Stanford must clean its own house before point
ing at the federal government.
Kennedy said he could offer only his own wil
lingness to listen to all parties concerned with
divestment. But such an offer from Kennedy
alone is not sufficient. Many board members live
in the Bay Area. A public forum that would
enable the students to voice their demands di
rectly with board members should be arranged
within a week.
A public forum with all concerned parties is the
first step in the negotiation process. But we must
remember that this is not a protest about a forum.
It is a protest about divestment. What emerges
from the forum is what matters.
If the students are satisfied that the board is
proceeding toward a responsible divestment
policy, the protest may be adjusted to reflect that
change. If the board shows no willingess to act
responsibly, students will be forced to intensify
their protest.
