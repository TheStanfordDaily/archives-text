# Deadhead discretion
## 
### 
Back by popular demand, the Grateful Dead
return to Frost Amphitheater this weekend for
two sold-out concerts. This event comes only
after an impressive effort by the Stanford Con
cert Network and persistent campus Deadheads,
following a University-forced hiatus last year.
And convincing the University to allow this
years concert was no mean feat. The Dead con
certs the previous two years caused unending
headaches for campus administrators, stemming
from blatant drug use and sales, ticket scalping,
gate crashing and littering.
But the Stanford community has one more —
presumably last — chance to make the Grateful

Dead concert an annual campus happening. It all
started here 20 years ago, and we join the Con
cert Network and producer Bill Graham Presents
in asking for a little common-sense discretion of
those planning to attend an afternoon concert
this weekend. It is not unreasonable that or
ganizers request a little cooperation in their ef
forts to avoid a run-in with police and administra
tors.
We don't mean to tell Deadheads not to scalp
tickets or not to take drugs. Such a request might
be like asking Eddie Murphy not to use profanity.
We only recommend being discreet about it.
Keep truckin'.
