## Speech reflects racist trends 
### 
As expected, Clarence Pendleton's
speech at Kresge Auditorum was a
veritable orgy of New Right rhetoric
and baiting. There is little need to go
into a sentence-by-sentence analysis
of his talk. With the exception of per
haps two or three moments, he im
provised off of a script consisting of
an amalgam of right-wing comedy,

VIEWPOINT

non-sequitur anecdotes and anti
black self-aggrandizement. Neverthe
less, here are some of the highlights:
Pendleton quickly boasted that he
is not and never was a "leader of
black people." Neither is he a civil
rights leader. Pendleton extended a
special invitation to the blacks in at
tendance to attack him personally.
He defined civil rights as "reverse
discrimination" and then promptly
labled both black and white support
ers of the civil rights movement
"America's new racists."
Pendleton did admit that the old
racism is still with us today, but
proclaimed that the solution to the
resulting inequality resides in the free
market and pulling on one's own
bootstraps. In terms of policy,
Pendleton advocated "equality of op
portunity" in the market over
"equality in (social) results." He
made it absolutely clear that this last
point was the ideological demarcation
between him, as a Reaganite, and
the new racists (traditional civil rights
advocates).
Not once was there any mention of
that old new racist, Martin Luther
King. Jr. No mention of the per
petuity of American class, racial and
gender inequality; of how past dis
crimination is camouflaged as it is
reproduced daily by U.S. capitalism
— and that this has been the
backbone of the Reagan "recovery."
It is no mistake that Pendleton is
Reagan's main man on the U.S. Civil
Rights Commission. It is no random
choice that the Stanford College
Republicans, growing more cunning
and bold b\ the day, worked so hard
to bring him here. It is not simply be
cause Pendleton is black. It is because
lie is both black and an outspoken
right-winger. Pendleton is both an
apologist lor. and a champion of.
Reaganite (far right) capitalism.
Pendleton's seemingly incompre
hensible analysis of the concessions
won by the civil rights movement of
the 1 V>f>Os from U.S. capitalism
shocked Stanford liberals and
progressives alike. It shocked people
because it was a rare and baldfaced
presentation of the class perspective
of the U.S. bourgeoisie on civil rights
and the United States today. It scared
liberals, scolded the liberal bour
geoisie (the Democratic Party leader
ship) and just plain insulted
oppressed nationalities — blacks,
chicanos Latinos. Asians, native

Americans — and women.
Pendleton did it in a way that no
"respectable" white male right
winger can yet dare to do on a
campus like Stanford's. Imagine
Pendleton wearing a white peaked
hood over his head as he spoke at
Kresge. He would easily have passed
for a Klansman. Without that hood,
what you have instead is the ideology
of white racism in blackface.
Look at the impact that Pendleton
had on his Stanford audience. Even
though Pendleton dismissed his own
blackness, his own open invitation to
personal attack was the equivalent of
a right-wing declaration of open
season on all blacks, other oppressed
nationalities and women who were in
the opposition.
Fie patiently baited individuals,
claiming to answer questions by
either changing the subject com
pletely or behaving like a juvenile
delinquent. Once he succeeded in
frustrating youthful intellectual
outrage, powerless (though honest)
emotionalism took its place.

It is no mistake
that Pendleton is
Reagan's main
man on the U.S.
Civil Rights Com
mission.

Pendleton then displayed his consi
derable talents as a rabble-rouser.
Without resorting to explicitly crude
or vulgar replies, Pendleton's con
tempt and arrogance successfully
agitated perhaps a dozen or more
white males in the audience. Follow
ing Pendleton's sophisticated lead,
these aspiring junior Klansmen actu
ally made it a point to heckle the stu
dents asking questions, especially
blacks.
This was not simply boyish humor.
The numerous mutterings in between
heckles made it clear just how deep
dark-minded junior Nazi thoughts
went with these Stanford Neander
thal. Pendleton, by saying loudly and
clearly what white right-wingers arc
still too timid to say in public, proved
what a spark of inspiration he can be.
We should all make note of this.
Moving beyond a critique of
Pendleton, progressive whites, op
pressed nationalities and women
must examine and understand the
source of our tactical powerlessness
in that situation.
Whenever the lie of "reverse dis

crimination" is mouthed, we must re
member that the concessions that
were won by the civil rights move
ment resulted in a basic extension of
democratic rights and social equality
for all Americans. We must remem
ber that open admissions policies and
non-military college financial aid
opened the doors of college not only
to blacks and other oppressed
nationalities, but to poor people and
women as well.
The "failures" of the social pro
grams of the (Democratic) "Great
Society" do not lie with the civil
rights movement. Republicans and/or
Democrats. It lies with the strategic
decline of U.S. imperialism and a
cancer-ridden domestic economic
system.
U.S. capitalism can no longer af
ford civil rights, let alone fundamen
tal social equality. As a result, that
same capitalism in decline needs to
get rich quick; and so it targets blacks
as the number one scapegoat of
today's rightward trend under
Reaganomics.
Pendleton is thus very effective as
the current chief advocate of
Reaganomics main thrust against
blacks. That is, of course, only until
the junior Nazis and Klansmen
among us get the hang of things.
So, what are the tasks before pro
gressive white, oppressed nationality
and women students? First, we need
to develop the depth of our organiza
tions and the breadth of progressive
and multi-national (cross-nationality)
political unity.
The absence of a more organized
black and Third World political per
spective on Pendleton and the
rightward trend left liberal and pro
gressive white students adrift in what
amounted to a puddle of reaction.
Very few of the vast majority of white
students opposed the behavior of the
junior fascists.
Clearly, black and other oppressed
nationalities must move forward in
formulating their distinct concrete so
cial agendas and in building up pro
gressive Third World political unity.
Progressive white students must learn
from this particular Third World
thrust and develop it further into
multinational political unity in the
face of the Right.
It is in times like these that groups
like the Klan. Nazis and even College
Republicans become more aggres
sive. When this happens, the Klan
and Nazis openly turn to the white
community for refuge and new
recruits.
The Right is not waiting around.
Pendleton is really only telling us all
to get ready. Liberals, progressives
and the Left in the United States have
got to unite. Thank you, Clarence, for
a good lesson, albeit unintended, I'm
sure.
