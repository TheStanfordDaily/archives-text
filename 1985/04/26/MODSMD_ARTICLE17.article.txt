# Playboy has rights, too
## 
### 
I did a bad thing this weekend. While a good friend was
out on the town with a close woman friend, I garnished
the front of his door with nude photographs. Upon his
return later that evening, both he and his friend were
quite surprised.
They weren't upset because they had seen something
they had never before observed (not even close); rather,
they were disturbed by the possible social consequences
that this kind of pornographic trash could bring upon the
impressionable members of our society. It was beyond
their comprehension that anyone could be sick enough to
mar his door with the utter filth and pollution that these
pictures possessed.
I thought it was funny.

Likewise, a physics professor, Dick Bond, who months
ago allowed a nude pin-up to remain on his chalkboard
for two class periods, was scolded by a member of his class
for being insensitive and sexist. The student demanded
that he take the picture down immediately. Nevertheless,
the rest of the class just laughed.
I, too, thought this was funny.
Last Tuesday, Prof. Philip Zimbardo surprised his Psy
chology 1 class with a slide containing a young couple en
gaging in a sexual act upon their stove. Dr. Z assured us
the stove was turned off. Not surprisingly, the majority of
the class laughed.
Ah. Now here's the rub.
Why is it that certain people can get so upset over
something that many others find so amusing?
Is there something inherently sinful in the baring of our
bodies?
I think not! And I'm sure most of you will agree with
my presumption. The human nude has been shown to be a
thing of beauty by some of world's most renowned artists.
Obviously, this is not the problem.
Instead, the plea of nearly 350 protesters that attended
last week's White Plaza rally was one of exploitation. It is
their view that the pictures of women that arc included in
these magazines are highly suggestive of sex, and that this
view can only lead to enhance man's long-standing
domination of women. How, they ask, can women ever
expect to gain equal opportunities if they are merely re
garded as sexual objects available to satisfy man's every
whim?
I don't think that this is the point.
True, I am not one who owns pornographic magazines.
The pictures that I used to complete my ghastly deed
belonged to a friend. But I have other reasons for not sub
scribing to these magazines— I simply choose not to. Still,

I will not deny being intrigued by pictures I have seen in
these magazines.
The simple fact of the matter is that pornography is
merely another type of exploitation that has become so
much a part of modern day America. A 12-year-old ten
nis star who eats and sleeps only to play tennis is being ex
ploited by his parents. Any average Joe who buys
cigarettes so that he can look like the stud in the ad
vertisements is being exploited by the cigarette company.
And likewise, a girl who spends her days 011 the beach clad
solely in a French-cut bikini is exploiting her body in the
same way that any magazine has ever done. Surely the
suit's main purpose is not to shave two inches off one's tan
line.
But even if these facts are true, this doesn't mean that
they're good. Maybe those of you who were protesting are
in fact against all these things also. If this is the case, how
come no one even mentioned the advertisement appear
ing in last week's Daily requesting applicants for a "Men
of Stanford" calendar?
And similarly, how come several of the letters that were
published in last week's Daily suggested that Stanford
women needn't pose because they soon will have respec
table jobs? Is this to suggest that those girls who are not
fortunate enough to be receiving a quality education are
those who instead should be posing? Are you suggesting
that Stanford women are merely too good to be included?
I'll be the first to agree that the arguments that I present
in this piece are really not pro-pornography, but are in
stead merely pro-choice. I do not at all promote pornog
raphy, but I similarly do not promote lots of things.

Last Tuesday, Prof. Philip
Zimbardo surprised his Psy
chology 1 class with a slide
containing a young couple
engaging in a sexual act
upon their stove. Dr. Z.
assured us the stove was
turned off.

The fact is, Playboy neither forces its models nor its
readers to participate in anything against their wishes. In
stead. it is simply a money-making magazine that is typical
of America's free enterprise system. Why isn't Playboy
entitled to the same rights that everyone else enjoys in this
country? If you really want to express your dissatisfaction
with the magazine, don't buy it. Isn't that what freedom is
really all about?

And similarly, how come several of the letters that were
published in last week's Daily suggested that Stanford
women needn't pose because they soon will have respec
table jobs? Is this to suggest that those girls who are not
fortunate enough to be receiving a quality education are
those who instead should be posing? Are you suggesting
that Stanford women are merely too good to be included?
I'll be the first to agree that the arguments that I present
in this piece are really not pro-pornography, but are in
stead merely pro-choice. I do not at all promote pornog
raphy, but I similarly do not promote lots of things.

Last Tuesday, Prof. Philip
Zimbardo surprised his Psy
chology 1 class with a slide
containing a young couple
engaging in a sexual act
upon their stove. Dr. Z.
assured us the stove was
turned off.

The fact is, Playboy neither forces its models nor its
readers to participate in anything against their wishes. In
stead. it is simply a money-making magazine that is typical
of America's free enterprise system. Why isn't Playboy
entitled to the same rights that everyone else enjoys in this
country? If you really want to express your dissatisfaction
with the magazine, don't buy it. Isn't that what freedom is
really all about?
