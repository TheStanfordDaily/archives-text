# Kennedy, Baez address protesters

### JEFF BIDDULPH Editorial staff 
Despite the urgings of some 1,000 protesters who
crowded outside his office in the second day of
demonstrations there, University President Donald Ken
nedy said yesterday afternoon that divestment is "not the
way to relieve the appalling situation that we perceive and
that South Africans confront."
Kennedy, who spoke to the polite but largely unper
suaded crowd for about 10 minutes and then entertained
questions, said he continues to favor pursuing legislative
reform of U.S. foreign policy as "the route that offers the
best hope of progress for this vexing problem."
Kennedy's speech followed a festive reception for
folksinger Joan Baez and former Attorney General Ram
sey Clark, who urged the crowd to continue its day-old
protest in hopes of ending the University's investments in
corporations that do business in South Africa.
The sit-in entered its second night last night with more
than 220 participants sleeping in the Quad. Students en
gaged in a wide range of group discussions on the past and
future of the protest, viewed films on apartheid and con
tinued the singing and planning that characterized the
previous night.
The only sign of discord — a late-night dispute among
several protesters over charges that Stanford Out of South
Africa (SOSA), the group coordinating the protest, con
troled the Kennedy question-and-answer session by
raising pre-planned questions — was settled when SOSA
member Steve Phillips called on protesters to air their
grievances in an hour-long discussion.
At the peak of yesterday's protest, Baez told the crowd,
"This ends the myth that you are the totally non-thinking,
self-centered generation." She was greeted with a stand
ing ovation and signs reading "We Care" and "U.S. Out
of South Africa."
Baez added, however, that time would show if the
protesters are "spring vacation revolutionaries or whether
you are serious about what you're doing."
The protesters are joining a nationwide demonstration

against university investments in companies that do busi
ness in South Africa. They have vowed to sit in in front of
Kennedy's office until the University's Board of Trustees
agrees to divest of companies, such as Motorola and
Hitachi, which do business in South Africa.
In addition, the demonstrators are seeking a public
forum, including faculty, administration and students, in
which to discuss strategies for total divestment. They are
also demanding that the vice president for business and
finance and members of the Board of Trustees disclose
their personal investments so students will know whether
there is a conflict of interest in their decisions concerning
divestment.
Stanford invests in 97 firms that do business with South
Africa, according to University Treasurer Rodney
Adams.
Kennedy, who had just returned from Washington,
D.C., where he attended a meeting of the Association of
American Universities, indicated that he would work with
student representatives to conduct a public forum on
divestment. He said, however, that he remains opposed to
divestment as a strategy for pressuring South Africa, and
he expressed reservations about students' demands that
University officials and trustees reveal their personal in
vestment portfolios.
Kennedy did, however, congratulate the demonstrators
on their "conviction and the decency with which you have
carried out that conviction." and said that he had just
returned from Washington where there is "a heightened
atmosphere of concern — and you have contributed sig
nificantly to that." He said student protest around the
country "is making a mark, and your voices are being
heard."
Some protesters indicated, however, that Kennedy's
remarks did not lessen their resolve to protest until their
demands are met.
"Kennedy answered our questions with non-answers,
and that is not acceptable," said Bill Cohn, a spokesman
