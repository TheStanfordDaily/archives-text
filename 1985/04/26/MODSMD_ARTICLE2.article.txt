# Kennedy, Baez address protesters
## 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Editorial staff 
Despite the urgings of some 1,000 protesters who
crowded outside his office in the second day of
demonstrations there, University President Donald Ken
nedy said yesterday afternoon that divestment is "not the
way to relieve the appalling situation that we perceive and
that South Africans confront."
Kennedy, who spoke to the polite but largely unper
suaded crowd for about 10 minutes and then entertained
questions, said he continues to favor pursuing legislative
reform of U.S. foreign policy as "the route that offers the
best hope of progress for this vexing problem."
Kennedy's speech followed a festive reception for
folksinger Joan Baez and former Attorney General Ram
sey Clark, who urged the crowd to continue its day-old
protest in hopes of ending the University's investments in
corporations that do business in South Africa.
The sit-in entered its second night last night with more
than 220 participants sleeping in the Quad. Students en
gaged in a wide range of group discussions on the past and
future of the protest, viewed films on apartheid and con
tinued the singing and planning that characterized the
previous night.
The only sign of discord — a late-night dispute among
several protesters over charges that Stanford Out of South
Africa (SOSA), the group coordinating the protest, con
troled the Kennedy question-and-answer session by
raising pre-planned questions — was settled when SOSA
member Steve Phillips called on protesters to air their
grievances in an hour-long discussion.
At the peak of yesterday's protest, Baez told the crowd,
"This ends the myth that you are the totally non-thinking,
self-centered generation." She was greeted with a stand
ing ovation and signs reading "We Care" and "U.S. Out
of South Africa."
Baez added, however, that time would show if the
protesters are "spring vacation revolutionaries or whether
you are serious about what you're doing."
The protesters are joining a nationwide demonstration

against university investments in companies that do busi
ness in South Africa. They have vowed to sit in in front of
Kennedy's office until the University's Board of Trustees
agrees to divest of companies, such as Motorola and
Hitachi, which do business in South Africa.
In addition, the demonstrators are seeking a public
forum, including faculty, administration and students, in
which to discuss strategies for total divestment. They are
also demanding that the vice president for business and
finance and members of the Board of Trustees disclose
their personal investments so students will know whether
there is a conflict of interest in their decisions concerning
divestment.
Stanford invests in 97 firms that do business with South
Africa, according to University Treasurer Rodney
Adams.
Kennedy, who had just returned from Washington,
D.C., where he attended a meeting of the Association of
American Universities, indicated that he would work with
student representatives to conduct a public forum on
divestment. He said, however, that he remains opposed to
divestment as a strategy for pressuring South Africa, and
he expressed reservations about students' demands that
University officials and trustees reveal their personal in
vestment portfolios.
Kennedy did, however, congratulate the demonstrators
on their "conviction and the decency with which you have
carried out that conviction." and said that he had just
returned from Washington where there is "a heightened
atmosphere of concern — and you have contributed sig
nificantly to that." He said student protest around the
country "is making a mark, and your voices are being
heard."
Some protesters indicated, however, that Kennedy's
remarks did not lessen their resolve to protest until their
demands are met.
"Kennedy answered our questions with non-answers,
and that is not acceptable," said Bill Cohn, a spokesman

tor SOSA. "We don't take kindly to
paternalistic attitudes, and that's
what he gave us."
Kennedy "must stand with the op
pressed or stand with the oppressors,
hut make up your mind," said Steve
Phillips, another member of SOSA.
I.et us all join and raise our
voice," Charles N'Cho, a member of
the Stanford African Students Asso
ciation, urged the crowd. "Let us use
our treedom to help bring about
power and freedom for those who are
struggling 111 the jail of apartheid."
Baez, long associated with the an
tiwar movement, urged students to
use Gandhian non-violence to pursue
their aims in South Africa.
"Non-violence has nothing to do
with passivity and everything to do
with strength," Baez said.
Baez, who was contacted yesterday
morning by members of SOSA. told
I he Daily she decided to come to the
rally because "they called and I was
free this afternoon."
Asked it the protest indicated a
return of student activism, Baez said
the demonstration "obviously is a
revival ol some kind. How long it will
last is another question, but I find it
very moving, very exciting."
Baez concluded her address with
an a capellu version of "Ain't Gonna
Let Nobody Turn Me Around," ac
companied by hand-clapping.
Clark attacked the Reagan admin
istration's policy of" non-constructive
engagement" in South Africa and
called it a "romance with racism."
Other speakers who urged the stu
dents to continue their protest in
cluded Rev. Byron Bland of the
United Campus Christian Ministry
and the Rev. Eugene Boyle of Stan
lord's Catholic Newman Center.
Kennedy has scheduled a meeting

for 4:30 p.m. today with Phillips and
four other members of SOSA's
liaison committee to discuss the
specifics of the public forum.
Kennedy suggested that some stu
dents might wish to become involved
in the legislative approach to the
problem of apartheid, and said he will
probably support the majority of
measures outlined in a pending bill
proposed by Sen. Edward Kennedy
(D-Mass.). The proposed legislation
would prohibit bank loans or credit
extensions to the government of
South Africa or anv organization

which it controls and bar new invest
ments or bank loans to South Africa
by any U.S. foreign affiliate or citi
zen. as well as take other measures.
SOSA representatives said 1,600
people, including 70 faculty mem
bers. have singed petitions expressing
support for divestment, solidarity
with fellow protesters at UC-
Berkeley and asking for the United
States to grant political asylum for
two South African students at Co
lumbia who have been charged with
high treason by their home govern
ment.

four other members of SOSA's
liaison committee to discuss the
specifics of the public forum.
Kennedy suggested that some stu
dents might wish to become involved
in the legislative approach to the
problem of apartheid, and said he will
probably support the majority of
measures outlined in a pending bill
proposed by Sen. Edward Kennedy
(D-Mass.). The proposed legislation
would prohibit bank loans or credit
extensions to the government of
South Africa or anv organization

which it controls and bar new invest
ments or bank loans to South Africa
by any U.S. foreign affiliate or citi
zen. as well as take other measures.
SOSA representatives said 1,600
people, including 70 faculty mem
bers. have singed petitions expressing
support for divestment, solidarity
with fellow protesters at UC-
Berkeley and asking for the United
States to grant political asylum for
two South African students at Co
lumbia who have been charged with
high treason by their home govern
ment.

University President Donald Kennedy addresses some 1,000 student
protesters in front of his office yesterday afternoon.
Despite the urgings of some 1,000 protesters who
crowded outside his office in the second day of
demonstrations there, University President Donald Ken
nedy said yesterday afternoon that divestment is "not the
way to relieve the appalling situation that we perceive and
that South Africans confront."
Kennedy, who spoke to the polite but largely unper
suaded crowd for about 10 minutes and then entertained
questions, said he continues to favor pursuing legislative
reform of U.S. foreign policy as "the route that offers the
best hope of progress for this vexing problem."
Kennedy's speech followed a festive reception for
folksinger Joan Baez and former Attorney General Ram
sey Clark, who urged the crowd to continue its day-old
protest in hopes of ending the University's investments in
corporations that do business in South Africa.
The sit-in entered its second night last night with more
than 220 participants sleeping in the Quad. Students en
gaged in a wide range of group discussions on the past and
future of the protest, viewed films on apartheid and con
tinued the singing and planning that characterized the
previous night.
The only sign of discord — a late-night dispute among
several protesters over charges that Stanford Out of South
Africa (SOSA), the group coordinating the protest, con
troled the Kennedy question-and-answer session by
raising pre-planned questions — was settled when SOSA
member Steve Phillips called on protesters to air their
grievances in an hour-long discussion.
At the peak of yesterday's protest, Baez told the crowd,
"This ends the myth that you are the totally non-thinking,
self-centered generation." She was greeted with a stand
ing ovation and signs reading "We Care" and "U.S. Out
of South Africa."
Baez added, however, that time would show if the
protesters are "spring vacation revolutionaries or whether
you are serious about what you're doing."
The protesters are joining a nationwide demonstration

against university investments in companies that do busi
ness in South Africa. They have vowed to sit in in front of
Kennedy's office until the University's Board of Trustees
agrees to divest of companies, such as Motorola and
Hitachi, which do business in South Africa.
In addition, the demonstrators are seeking a public
forum, including faculty, administration and students, in
which to discuss strategies for total divestment. They are
also demanding that the vice president for business and
finance and members of the Board of Trustees disclose
their personal investments so students will know whether
there is a conflict of interest in their decisions concerning
divestment.
Stanford invests in 97 firms that do business with South
Africa, according to University Treasurer Rodney
Adams.
Kennedy, who had just returned from Washington,
D.C., where he attended a meeting of the Association of
American Universities, indicated that he would work with
student representatives to conduct a public forum on
divestment. He said, however, that he remains opposed to
divestment as a strategy for pressuring South Africa, and
he expressed reservations about students' demands that
University officials and trustees reveal their personal in
vestment portfolios.
Kennedy did, however, congratulate the demonstrators
on their "conviction and the decency with which you have
carried out that conviction." and said that he had just
returned from Washington where there is "a heightened
atmosphere of concern — and you have contributed sig
nificantly to that." He said student protest around the
country "is making a mark, and your voices are being
heard."
Some protesters indicated, however, that Kennedy's
remarks did not lessen their resolve to protest until their
demands are met.
"Kennedy answered our questions with non-answers,
and that is not acceptable," said Bill Cohn, a spokesman

tor SOSA. "We don't take kindly to
paternalistic attitudes, and that's
what he gave us."
Kennedy "must stand with the op
pressed or stand with the oppressors,
hut make up your mind," said Steve
Phillips, another member of SOSA.
I.et us all join and raise our
voice," Charles N'Cho, a member of
the Stanford African Students Asso
ciation, urged the crowd. "Let us use
our treedom to help bring about
power and freedom for those who are
struggling 111 the jail of apartheid."
Baez, long associated with the an
tiwar movement, urged students to
use Gandhian non-violence to pursue
their aims in South Africa.
"Non-violence has nothing to do
with passivity and everything to do
with strength," Baez said.
Baez, who was contacted yesterday
morning by members of SOSA. told
I he Daily she decided to come to the
rally because "they called and I was
free this afternoon."
Asked it the protest indicated a
return of student activism, Baez said
the demonstration "obviously is a
revival ol some kind. How long it will
last is another question, but I find it
very moving, very exciting."
Baez concluded her address with
an a capellu version of "Ain't Gonna
Let Nobody Turn Me Around," ac
companied by hand-clapping.
Clark attacked the Reagan admin
istration's policy of" non-constructive
engagement" in South Africa and
called it a "romance with racism."

dents to continue their protest in

and the Rev. Eugene Boyle of Stan
