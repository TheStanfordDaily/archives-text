# Frosh computer hacker programs music and games
## 
### GREG CROSSFIELD 
At first glance, freshman Will Har
vey might seem like an average rich
kid. You know the type: IK years
old, drives a new BMW and listens to
music on a 1,500-watt stereo while
playing video games on his Apple
computer.
Hut, instead of being the benefi
ciary of mommy and daddy's wealth,
Harvey earned his toys the old fas
hioned way. That's right. He earned
them.
As the author of Electronic Arts'
Music Construction Set (MCS), Har
vey has earned well in excess of
$100,000 in royalties.

"1 am just a mediocre programmer
who does not know enough to know
when something is impossible, and so
I give it my best shot and it turns out
[to be] possible in the end," Harvey
said. "If I had known how much there
was to completing MCS, I would
never have done it."
How did Harvey make the transi
tion from sharp high school student to
wealthy programer? By playing
games — computer games, that is.
"My first exposure to computers
came as a result of playing video
games on a friend's computer during
junior high. My parents put in half,

and I earned the other half working
on my paper route to buy a Com
modore" personal computer.
Harvey's father is an engineer at
SRI, and his mother is a philosopy
teacher at Menlo College. Along with
providing a lot of support, his parents
handle his finances from their Foster
City home.
After playing a lot of games, Har
vey taught himself to program in
BASIC. "1 thought 1 could write
games that would be as good as what
was then on the market," he said. The
only problem was that most major
games were written in machine lang
uage.

This problem was solved during his
freshman year in high school. "I was
sitting in a computer class when our
teacher asked if anyone knew what
machine language was," he said. "I
raised my hand trying to act real
cocky. The teacher said, 'Fine, you
can give a talk on it tomorrow.' I went
home and read everything I could
find on it. I got to the point where I
could talk about machine language
and even do a little programming."
Harvey's first commercial product
was a game called Lancaster. He said
the publisher did a poor job market
ing it, and it wasn't all that interesting
anyway.

But from the ashes of Lancaster
rose MCS — and success.
"1 wanted Lancaster to have music
like the video games at the arcades.
So. I wrote a little music program that
allowed me to just plug in the notes 1
wanted to hear played. When
Electronic Arts, a major software
publisher, asked what I would do
next, I told them about my music pro
gram."
Nine months and a lot of program
ming later, MCS was introduced.
Harvey put in long hours working on
MCS. "During one week I did not get
any sleep for five days straight. 1 had
an important deadline to meet, so 1
ended up going without sleep, but 1
did take breaks of no more than an
hour," he said.
Besides being a computer hacker,
Harvey was involved in other activi
ties in high school. He was validic
torian as well as president of the stu
dent body. He played tennis, football,
basketball and ran a marathon. Har
vey also took nine Advanced Place
ment tests and entered college with
enough credit for more than the 45
units that Stanford allows.
Units don't seem too hard for Har
vey to come by. This quarter he is
taking classes that would yield 32
units, including Structured Liberal
Education, Physics 53, Math 45H,
Number Theory, Set Theory, Jazz
Theory, Partial Differential Equa
tions, and an Electricity and Mag
netism lab.
"Whether 1 am taking 10 units or
35 units, I do the same amount of
work," Harvey explained. "Fall quar
ter I thought it would be really diffi
cult. I took only 15 units and ended
up with a lot of free time. Winter
quarter I took 20 units with about the
same result. So, I decided take more
classes."
Along with this heavy class load,
Harvey still has time to program for
four hours a day, six days a week. He
gets up at 4 a.m. Monday through
Saturday to program at Electronic
Arts' San Mateo facility. He gets back
just in time for his 9 a.m. class. As
Harvey's roommate Jim Nicholson
put it simply, "I rarely see Will."
Why does a guy that has a healthy
income and lots of toys drive himself
so hard? "Programming is a hobby
for me. I am like an artist creating a
piece of art. 1 get a lot of satisfaction
from creating something that is
pretty," Harvey said.

who does not know enough to know
when something is impossible, and so
I give it my best shot and it turns out
[to be] possible in the end," Harvey
said. "If I had known how much there
was to completing MCS, I would
never have done it."
How did Harvey make the transi
tion from sharp high school student to
wealthy programer? By playing
games — computer games, that is.
"My first exposure to computers
came as a result of playing video
games on a friend's computer during
junior high. My parents put in half,

and I earned the other half working
on my paper route to buy a Com
modore" personal computer.
Harvey's father is an engineer at
SRI, and his mother is a philosopy
teacher at Menlo College. Along with
providing a lot of support, his parents
handle his finances from their Foster
City home.
After playing a lot of games, Har
vey taught himself to program in
BASIC. "1 thought 1 could write
games that would be as good as what
was then on the market," he said. The
only problem was that most major
games were written in machine lang
uage.

This problem was solved during his
freshman year in high school. "I was
sitting in a computer class when our
teacher asked if anyone knew what
machine language was," he said. "I
raised my hand trying to act real
cocky. The teacher said, 'Fine, you
can give a talk on it tomorrow.' I went
home and read everything I could
find on it. I got to the point where I
could talk about machine language
and even do a little programming."
Harvey's first commercial product
was a game called Lancaster. He said
the publisher did a poor job market
ing it, and it wasn't all that interesting
anyway.

But from the ashes of Lancaster
rose MCS — and success.
"1 wanted Lancaster to have music
like the video games at the arcades.
So. I wrote a little music program that
allowed me to just plug in the notes 1
wanted to hear played. When
Electronic Arts, a major software
publisher, asked what I would do
next, I told them about my music pro
gram."
Nine months and a lot of program
ming later, MCS was introduced.
Harvey put in long hours working on
MCS. "During one week I did not get
any sleep for five days straight. 1 had
an important deadline to meet, so 1
ended up going without sleep, but 1
did take breaks of no more than an
hour," he said.
Besides being a computer hacker,
Harvey was involved in other activi
ties in high school. He was validic
torian as well as president of the stu
dent body. He played tennis, football,
basketball and ran a marathon. Har
vey also took nine Advanced Place
ment tests and entered college with
enough credit for more than the 45
units that Stanford allows.
Units don't seem too hard for Har
vey to come by. This quarter he is
taking classes that would yield 32
units, including Structured Liberal
Education, Physics 53, Math 45H,
Number Theory, Set Theory, Jazz
Theory, Partial Differential Equa
tions, and an Electricity and Mag
netism lab.
"Whether 1 am taking 10 units or
35 units, I do the same amount of
work," Harvey explained. "Fall quar
ter I thought it would be really diffi
cult. I took only 15 units and ended
up with a lot of free time. Winter
quarter I took 20 units with about the
same result. So, I decided take more
classes."
Along with this heavy class load,
Harvey still has time to program for
four hours a day, six days a week. He
gets up at 4 a.m. Monday through
Saturday to program at Electronic
Arts' San Mateo facility. He gets back
just in time for his 9 a.m. class. As
Harvey's roommate Jim Nicholson
put it simply, "I rarely see Will."
Why does a guy that has a healthy
income and lots of toys drive himself
so hard? "Programming is a hobby
for me. I am like an artist creating a
piece of art. 1 get a lot of satisfaction
from creating something that is
pretty," Harvey said.

Will Harvey has earned more than $100,000 in royalties from a computer program that plays music,
Electronic Arts' Music Construction Set (MCS). "If I had known how much there was to completing MCS, 1
would never have done it," he says.
