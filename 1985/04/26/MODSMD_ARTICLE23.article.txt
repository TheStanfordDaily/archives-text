voluntarily, said Sgt. Alan Christopher. Murphy Hall
was occupied Tuesday afternoon by hundreds of students

today." Christopher said.

demonstrated in front of UCLA's main administration
building, formed a "human train" and marched around

administration building for the sixth day. Leslie Postal, a
