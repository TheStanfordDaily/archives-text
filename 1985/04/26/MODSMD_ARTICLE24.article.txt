Chants of "Apartheid means profit. Stanford won t stop
it" weren't heard 011 the Farm for the first time yesterday.
In Mav 1 *->77. then University President Richard I yman
was confronted with a wave of student protests criticizing
Stanford's investments in South .Africa. The protests cul
minated May 9 in a 16-hour sit-in on the first floor of Old
Union, where 294 demonstrators were arrested.
Earlier that week, about 450 demonstrators protested
outside I yman's office and. following demands at a rally
111 White Plaza organized by SCRIP (Stanford Committee
on Responsible Investment Policy), called for the Board
of 11ustees to reconsider investment policies in South
\frica. The demonstrators were met bv Robert
Rosenzweig. then vice president for public affairs, who
told the crowd that reconsideration of I niversity policy
was unlikely. Rosenzweig spoke on behalf of I.yman. who
v\as attending a meeting 111 St I ouis.
Rosenzweig was presented with petitions bearing al
most 3,000 student and faculty signatures calling for the
approval of shareholder resolutions by the trustees. I lie
petition also demanded to meet with the board's invest
ment committee.
In a letter put forth by SCRIP to the board. SCRIP
made four demands:
• that Stanford vote its 94.500 Ford Motor Co. shares in
favor of a resolution mandating withdrawal from South
Africa;
• that Stanford abolish the Committee on Investment Re
sponsibility (C-IR) and form a new committee;
• that Stanford prepare a report on the possible economic
effects on the University divestment;
• that the board meet with SCRIP before Dead Week

On May mure than 500 demonstrators lirst occupicd
the ground floor of Old union after .1 noon rally in White
Plaza. The rally and sit-in were also organized by SCRIP.
Poliee began arresting the demonstrators at 6:50 p.m..
nearly two hours alter the elosing ol the building, 011
charges of trespassing and failure to disperse. Stanford
Poliee Clnel Marvin Merrington. in an interview following
the sit-in. said the incident marked the lanicst single num
ber ot students arrested in the University's history
I he principal demand of the protest — the call for the
trustees to reverse previous abstentions and to vote the
I niversity s Ford Motor C o. shares 111 favor ol a share
holder resolution mandating withdrawal from South
Africa — was overwhelmingly defeated 111 a vote In l ord
stockholders May 12.
In response to the student concerns, the board voted
May 9 in favor of the recommendations of its Committee
on Investments to:
• publish letters sent to the companies explaining the
abstentions alone with the corporate reponses in Ihe
Daily:
• undertake a study 011 costs and benefits ol I .'diversity
divestment from corporations with South African invest
ments;
• have I yman and two other members of the trustee in
vestment committee meet with members of SCRIP: and
• discuss possible C-IR alterations. Eight years have
passed since the I diversity announced its policy of
selective divestment. Stanford's policy favors the Sullivan
Principles, which were adopted bv some U.S. corporations
in I 1 '"" as a guide to doing business in South Africa with
the intention of effecting change on apartheid.
