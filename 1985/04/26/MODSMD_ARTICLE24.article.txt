### GREG WEINGARTEN Editorial staff 
Chants of "Apartheid means profit. Stanford won t stop
it" weren't heard 011 the Farm for the first time yesterday.
In Mav 1 *->77. then University President Richard I yman
was confronted with a wave of student protests criticizing
Stanford's investments in South .Africa. The protests cul
minated May 9 in a 16-hour sit-in on the first floor of Old
Union, where 294 demonstrators were arrested.
Earlier that week, about 450 demonstrators protested
outside I yman's office and. following demands at a rally
111 White Plaza organized by SCRIP (Stanford Committee
on Responsible Investment Policy), called for the Board
of 11ustees to reconsider investment policies in South
\frica. The demonstrators were met bv Robert
Rosenzweig. then vice president for public affairs, who
told the crowd that reconsideration of I niversity policy
was unlikely. Rosenzweig spoke on behalf of I.yman. who
v\as attending a meeting 111 St I ouis.
Rosenzweig was presented with petitions bearing al
most 3,000 student and faculty signatures calling for the
approval of shareholder resolutions by the trustees. I lie
petition also demanded to meet with the board's invest
ment committee.
In a letter put forth by SCRIP to the board. SCRIP
made four demands:
• that Stanford vote its 94.500 Ford Motor Co. shares in
favor of a resolution mandating withdrawal from South
Africa;
• that Stanford abolish the Committee on Investment Re
sponsibility (C-IR) and form a new committee;
• that Stanford prepare a report on the possible economic
effects on the University divestment;
• that the board meet with SCRIP before Dead Week

On May mure than 500 demonstrators lirst occupicd
the ground floor of Old union after .1 noon rally in White
Plaza. The rally and sit-in were also organized by SCRIP.
Poliee began arresting the demonstrators at 6:50 p.m..
nearly two hours alter the elosing ol the building, 011
charges of trespassing and failure to disperse. Stanford
Poliee Clnel Marvin Merrington. in an interview following
the sit-in. said the incident marked the lanicst single num
ber ot students arrested in the University's history
I he principal demand of the protest — the call for the
trustees to reverse previous abstentions and to vote the
I niversity s Ford Motor C o. shares 111 favor ol a share
holder resolution mandating withdrawal from South
Africa — was overwhelmingly defeated 111 a vote In l ord
stockholders May 12.
In response to the student concerns, the board voted
May 9 in favor of the recommendations of its Committee
on Investments to:
• publish letters sent to the companies explaining the
abstentions alone with the corporate reponses in Ihe
Daily:
• undertake a study 011 costs and benefits ol I .'diversity
divestment from corporations with South African invest
ments;
• have I yman and two other members of the trustee in
vestment committee meet with members of SCRIP: and
• discuss possible C-IR alterations. Eight years have
passed since the I diversity announced its policy of
selective divestment. Stanford's policy favors the Sullivan
Principles, which were adopted bv some U.S. corporations
in I 1 '"" as a guide to doing business in South Africa with
the intention of effecting change on apartheid.

Police remove a protester from Old I nion during an anti-apartheid sit-in there on May 9, 1177.
Some faculty, students and administrators
who attended both the 1977 rally and yester
day's demonstrations organized by Students
Opposed to South Africa (SOSA) have drawn
comparisons between the two events.
History Prof. Clay Carson noted a difference
in students at Stanford today.
"Students involved in this one (protest) are
less likely to believe that the process of evaluat
ing the actions of individual companies is a
workable solution." Carson said. "There's a lot
more support of total divestment."
According to Carson, the mass arrests in
1977 "took steam" out of the demonstrators.
Woody Ichiyasu, one of the organizers of the
current demonstration and one of the students
arrested in the l l )77 sit-in. said that the goal of
the protesters is still for total divestment but
that the strategy and rationale are different
now than in '77.
"In '77, there was not a lot of education on
the principles of unity and rationale behind the
demands. Too many people got wrapped up in
how to defend yourself when you get arrested."
said Ichiyasu, now a senior at Stanford after
having stopped out for a number of years.
"In 1985, total divestment is on the top shelf
and we are gearing our tactics accordingly," Ic
hiyasu said.
He added that demonstrators today are less
impetuous and are basing protests on a
"rational-patience principle."
"This movement today is more dangerous.
That's why police now are a bit more stymied at
this point. We haven't done anything overt,"

Ichiyasu said.
He also said there is more support among
faculty members now than in 1977. Protesters
are "getting more organized" for divestment,
and some have given anonymous donations to
the current protest.
He also said the differences between Lyman
and current University President Donald Ken
nedy are not "all that big."
"Folks have referred to him (Kennedy) as
'Teflon Don." because he is a great PR man,
Ichiyasu said. "This is one of the things that's
going to start blistering the Teflon."
But after watching yesterdays rally, Carson
said Kennedy seems more responsive to the
demands of the students than did Lyman. Car
son described Kennedy's stance as "somewhat
hopeful."
Political Science Prof. David Abernethy, a
member of C-IR in the '70s, attributed current
student activism to the political situation under
the Reagan adminstration and the situation in
South Africa itself.
"Under Carter, the government was at least
willing to listen to statements. . . . Under
Reagan's 'constructive engagement' policy, it
makes it more difficult to expect our govern
ment will put effective pressure on South
Africa," Abernethy said.
Abernethy added that the Reagan adminis
tration has given "carrots rather than sticks"
and has shown itself to be clearly on the side of
South African oppressors. This, in turn, has
added impetus for the private sector to take ac
tion, he said.
Abernethy, however, said he favors more
stringent selective divestment over the current
University policy, but not the total divestment
approach called for by SOSA demonstrators.
