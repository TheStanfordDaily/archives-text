## Feminist author thinks all writing is political 
### LISA LYNCH 
Grace Paley, a Guggenheim fellow
and winner of the National Institute
of Arts and Letters Prize for short
story writing, will be reading from her
work tonight at 8 in Annenberg
Auditorium. The reading is co
sponsored by the Creative Writing
Program, the English Department
and the Feminist Studies Depart
ment.
Paley has published only three
volumes of short stories in 30 years,
but as the author of "The Little Dis
turbances of Man" (1959),
"Enormous Changes At The Last
Minute" (1974) and "Later That
Same Day" (1985), she has a well
deserved reputation among writers
and avid readers as the "writer's
writer." Her stories are about people
— comic people, serious people,
people who have an uncommon faith
in their lives, abilities and beliefs.
Paley says she feels that "writers
have a responsiblity to look at the
world straight and think about it. . . .
What they see is up to them — but all
writing is political."
Even when her first collection of
short stories went out of print in the
mid-19605, Paley maintained an un
derground reputation for the beauty
of her prose. The publication of fur
ther collections established her
reputation a$ one of the few contem
porary writers with an absolutely dis
tinctive voice.
As Paley herself put it,"I write
with an accent. I did have three lan
guages spoken around me when I was
a kid: English and Russian and Yid

dish. ... That's what's in my ear, so it
got through my Eustachian tubes or
whatever into my throat."
Paley is a writer who believes that
joy, as well as sorrow, is a part of life
and a part of fiction. Her writing reaf
firms the existence of bonds between
people.
Paley was one of the first writers to
write about the lives of divorced
women. Because of Paley's concern
with problems specific to women, she
has often been called a feminist
writer. She calls herself "a feminist
and a writer." For her, feminism does
not mean hostility toward men; she
gives her male characters a chance to
escape from stereotypes and to justify
their behavior.
Paley claims she writes short stories
instead of novels because "art is too
long and life is too short" and be
cause as a women she has been lim
ited by the interruptions of mother
hood. She explains, "There's a lot of
women going out there and writing
big, fat novels right now. But I hap
pened to have liked a lot being with
my kids."
Paley was born in New York City.
The daughter of "typical Russian im
migrant parents," she says she was al
ways an avid reader. She began to
write poetry at an early age, but did
not begin writing short stories until
her early 30s.
Grace Paley has lived most of her
life in the New York area. In the early
1960s she taught at Columbia and
Syracuse; she currently teaches at
Sarah Lawrence and the City Univer
sity of New York.


'I write with an
accent. I did have
three languages
spoken around me
when I was a kid:
English and Rus
sian and Yid
dish. . . . That's
what's in my ear,
so it got through
my Eustachian
tubes or whatever
into my throat.'
