## Spikers' dream season ends, USC ousts Card at regional 
### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
NORTHRIDGE — For a little over two sets last
night, the Stanford men's volleyball team, playing
in the first round of the West Regional against top
seeded USC, performed like it does in its dreams.
When the Cardinal men awoke, however, after
their 10-15, 15-9, 15-8, 15-6 nightmare, they were
in a cold sweat.
With its victory, USC advances to tomorrow's
final against defending national champion UCLA.
I he Bruins starched UC-Santa Barbara, 15-5, 15-
4, 15-12, in the first match last night.
The Cardinal, which finished 23-10 overall on the
year, its first winning season since 1977, must be
wondering just what happened. After splitting the
first two sets in routine fashion, Stanford appeared
ready to blow the match open, jumping out to an 8-
I lead in the third set.
The Cardinal did that largely behind an in
penetrable defensive front. Solo and combination
blocks by setter Craig Lauchner, middle blocker
Jon Root and outside hitter Stephen Blue had the
Cardinal Hying high.
Then it happened. When play resumed after

panic-stricken USC culled timeout. Stanford hit an
air pocket — or something — and lost altitude at a
dizzying pace.
USC reeled off the next 14 points to take the set,
a 2-1 lead, and all the Stanford momentum.
Even Trojan Coach Boh Yoder couldn't under
stand Stanford's complete disintegration. "I can't
explain that big of a swing of momentum," he said.
"Their mistakes just compounded — we weren't
earning all those points. There were a lot of un
forced errors."
Shaw offered a first-hand interpretation of the
collapse. "We got a little confused out there, and 1
think the coaching staff, Fred (Sturm) and I, have
to take some blame for that," he said.
"We might have given the guys a little too much
to think about in practice this week. We tried to in
troduce some new things we hadn't done all year.
Some of the players weren't really carrying out
their roles."
After blowing the 8-1 lead and losing the pivotal
third set, Stanford couldn't stave off the Trojan
onslaught. A fourth-set USC run of 10 points sent
the Cardinal packing.
"Things kind of snowballed on them," Yoder

said. "You could tell they were frustrated out
there. They were almost wondering what could go
wrong next."
But Yoder didn't think it was simply a case of a
Stanford fold, either. "1 though we came out flat,"
he said, "but at 8-1 in the third we got scared. That
provided the motivation we needed."
Thereafter, the Trojans marched all over the
Cardinal.
Afterward, Shaw could only reflect on what
might have been. "We got stuck at eight, and that
was it. 1 think if we could have won that game, and
in the process gotten some momentum, we would
have steamrolled them in four sets."
"Ifs," however, are big in sports, and few are big
ger than Shaw's. When all was said and done, it was
USC's team hitting percentage of .373 that over
whelmed Stanford's collective .252 effort.
Adam Johnson, USC's outside hitter, led both
teams with 23 kills (.486). Dave Yoder, brother of
the Trojan coach, added 15 (.303).
Stanford was paced by Root (20, .286) and
Braun (18, .429). After Root and Braun there was
a sharp drop for the Cardinal. Brent Monello's
eight kills and Scott Fortune's seven rounded out
the Stanford offense.
