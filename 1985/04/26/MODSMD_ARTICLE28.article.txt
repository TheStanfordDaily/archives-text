# Stanford nine at USC to meet cellar-dwellers
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
It's been said this year that there
are no pushovers in the Pacific 10
Southern Division baseball loop, and
that, on any given day, the lowliest
team might clobber a league leader.
Well, if USC, which hosts the
Cardinal baseball team this weekend
for a three-game series, isn't a push
over, the Trojans are darn close.
The Trojans are currently redefin
ing the meaning of slump. And that's
slump in capital letters. USC has
dumped 14 straight league games, in
cluding last weekend's sweep at the
hands of Arizona in Los Angeles. At
20-35 overall on the year and falling,
the Trojans haven't posted a Six-Pac
victory since March 15.

There's only one problem — that
March 15 win came against Stanford,
6-5, at Sunken Diamond.
Having been once-stung by the
Trojans, Cardinal Coach Mark
Marquess is wary of his opponent.
"They're a very young team with
some talent," Marquess said. "They
can play well one day, but not very
well the next. That's just the way they
are.
"That kind of inconsistency is in
dicative of a young team. But as the
year goes on, the young teams seem
to get a lot better."
Marquess fears the Trojans could
wake from their year-long slumber
and march all over the Cardinal. He
hopes Stanford, this week bumped to
No. 2 on the ESPN-Collegiate

Baseball national coaches' poll, won't
take USC lightly.
"We'll have to play well to get out
of there in good shape," Marquess
said.
And that's something the Cardinal
has not been doing lately. Although
it took two of three from UCLA
over the weekend and slipped by
Pacific on Tuesday, the team hasn't
played up to its national billing. The
three most recent Cardinal victories
were decided by last-inning homers.
And that is not the way Marquess
likes it. "We're not swinging the bat
as well as we were three weeks ago,"
Marquess said. "We'd rather beat
these teams like we know we can."

John Verducci and the Cardinal will try to pick off an upset bid by last-place USC this weekend and extend
their two-game lead in the Six-Pac.
After Saturday's 9-6 loss to UCLA, Card
inal left fielder Walt Harris was frustrated:
"We'd like to show these guys (the Bruins)
how we can really hit."
Harris and his teammates waited Sunday
until the ninth inning — as is their wont — to
convince UCLA of how Stanford can hit.
Harris' three-run homer helped overcome a
8-5 Bruin lead and gave the Cardinal a 9-8
triumph.
Could all this be part of a mid-season
slump? Stanford has, after all, played 40
games this year, winning 30.
Marquess said he doesn't think so. "Sure,
it's a long season with a lot of games, but our
kids are still playing hard," he said. "The in
tensity is still there."
One has to wonder if the intensity is still
there for USC, the league's last-place team

and one Stanford has trashed twice this year,
15-4 and 15-5.
By all indications, the Trojans are severely
out-gunned. They carry a team batting
average of .276 into the Stanford series. The
Cardinal has a .318 mark.
The pitching matchup for tonight's 7:30
start pits Stanford's Jeff Ballard (8-2, 3.63
ERA) against Brad Brink (4-7, 5.84). To
morrow evening at 7:30 it will be Rob
Wasenaar (6-2, 4.60) and Randy Johnson (4-
7, 5.16), and Sunday afternoon at 1, Jack
McDowell (7-3, 4.46) and Steve Bast (3-9,
6.93) will square off.
USC is paced by outfielder Jeff Wetherby,
who leads the team with his .375 average, his
six homers and his 38 RBIs. A 1 Villasenor
(.353) and Alby Silvera (.319) are other top
hitters.
Elsewhere in the Six-Pac, California is at
Arizona, and Arizona State is at UCLA.
Cal remains just two games behind Stan
ford with only nine games to go in the confer

ence season. Arizona is tied for third with
Arizona State, both five games off the pace.
Since ASU is on probation and both UCLA
and USC have been mathematically
eliminated from the race, the Bears and
Wildcats are the only two teams with a chance
to catch the Cardinal.
Stanford won the season series from
Arizona 4-2. The Cardinal took two of three
from Cal three weeks ago, and will face the
Bears again in three weeks in a series that
could decide the Six-Pac title.
The Six-Pac champion will be one of five
teams that get automatic berths to the two
West Regionals over Memorial Day weekend.
The winners of the Pac-10 Northern Division,
West Coast Athletic Conference, Western
Athletic Conference and Pacific Coast Ath
letic Association are the others.
The other three positions are awarded to
at-large teams, though the Six-Pac runner-up
is usually one of those.
