# Stanford nine at USC to meet cellar-dwellers
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
It's been said this year that there
are no pushovers in the Pacific 10
Southern Division baseball loop, and
that, on any given day, the lowliest
team might clobber a league leader.
Well, if USC, which hosts the
Cardinal baseball team this weekend
for a three-game series, isn't a push
over, the Trojans are darn close.
The Trojans are currently redefin
ing the meaning of slump. And that's
slump in capital letters. USC has
dumped 14 straight league games, in
cluding last weekend's sweep at the
hands of Arizona in Los Angeles. At
20-35 overall on the year and falling,
the Trojans haven't posted a Six-Pac
victory since March 15.

There's only one problem â€” that
March 15 win came against Stanford,
6-5, at Sunken Diamond.
Having been once-stung by the
Trojans, Cardinal Coach Mark
Marquess is wary of his opponent.
"They're a very young team with
some talent," Marquess said. "They
can play well one day, but not very
well the next. That's just the way they
are.
"That kind of inconsistency is in
dicative of a young team. But as the
year goes on, the young teams seem
to get a lot better."
Marquess fears the Trojans could
wake from their year-long slumber
and march all over the Cardinal. He
hopes Stanford, this week bumped to
No. 2 on the ESPN-Collegiate

Baseball national coaches' poll, won't
take USC lightly.
"We'll have to play well to get out
of there in good shape," Marquess
said.
And that's something the Cardinal
has not been doing lately. Although
it took two of three from UCLA
over the weekend and slipped by
Pacific on Tuesday, the team hasn't
played up to its national billing. The
three most recent Cardinal victories
were decided by last-inning homers.
And that is not the way Marquess
likes it. "We're not swinging the bat
as well as we were three weeks ago,"
Marquess said. "We'd rather beat
these teams like we know we can."

John Verducci and the Cardinal will try to pick off an upset bid by last-place USC this weekend and extend
their two-game lead in the Six-Pac.
