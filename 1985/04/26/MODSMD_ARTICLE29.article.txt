The Stanford women golfers wilJ test their
new No. 5 national ranking against many of
the West Coast s best teams this weekend in
what figures to be a hotly contested Western
Collegiate Athletic Association championship
in Phoenix, Ariz.
Ihe battle tor the championship begins
today with opening-round action at the
6,200-yard, par-72 Anasazi Golf Course.
The Cardinal women, who struggled
through an aggravating mid-season due to in
experience, injuries and a lack of continuity in
the lineup, have been all smiles recently,
thanks largely to a sizzling last two weeks.
Cardinal Coach Tim Baldwin believes that
the team's recent performances are the main
reason for their leap in the national rankings.
"It (the No. 5 ranking) is definitely the result
of our last six competitive rounds," he said.
"We have averaged approximately 300 our
last six rounds, which is outstanding."
The six rounds Baldwin referred to were at

the California Intercollegiate April 8 and 9
and the Lady Sun Devil April 15-17 at
Phoenix.
At the California Intercollegiate, the Card
inal women finished second, shooting an even
900 for the three rounds. More important,
they fired a team and course record 289 in the
first round.
The women's second-place finish, only
three shots behind No. 2 Tulsa, at the Lady
Sun Devil was a tremendous boost for the
team's confidence and gained the attention of
the other West Coast teams. "We proved to a
lot of people that we're a good team," sopho
more Kathleen McCarthy said following that
tournament.
At the WCAA championships, the Card
inal's lineup will consist of McCarthy, junior
Kathy Kostas and freshmen Kay Cornelius,
Trish McGonigle and Anna Oxenstierna.
McCarthy, an Ail-American last year as a
freshman, is currently ranked No. 7 in the na
tion. She finished second in both the Califor
nia Intercollegiate and the Lady Sun Devil.

Kostas, who missed much of the season due
to injury, has come back strongly and is
ranked No. 40 in the nation.
Oxenstierna, the No. 1 junior player in
Europe last year, has finished fourth .and
eighth in the past two tournaments.
Though the Cardinal women are ranked
No. 5, Baldwin said Arizona State and UCLA
would probably be the pre-tournament
favorites.
ASU, ranked No. 4 in the nation, has three
golfers who rank in the top 10 amateurs in the
world, according to Baldwin.
UCLA, currently ranked No. 12, has quite
a threesome of its own in Kay Cockerill,
Sophie LaPaire and Krystal Parker.
Despite the stiff competition ahead,
Baldwin is confident about the team's posi
tion. "Our momentum's going in the right di
rection," he said.
Adding to Baldwin's confidence is the fact
that the Cardinal has defeated UCLA in their
last two meetings and beat ASU just a week
ago in Phoenix.
