## 
### DEBORAH KEHLE Staff writer 
The "hottest places in hell" are reserved for
"those who in times of moral crisis do nothing."
said former Attorney General Ramsey Clark
during his speech to about 70 people at the Law
School yesterday afternoon.
Clark, who spoke earlier at the anti-apartheid
rally in the Quad, covered a variety of topics, in
cluding U.S. involvement in Nicaragua, world
hunger and current Attorney General Edwin
Vicesc.
Clark was appointed attorney general by Presi
dent Lyndon Johnson in 1967 "by mistake," ac
cording to Clark. "I had opposed the death
penalty. ... I had opposed wiretapping all my
life. . . . I opposed the Vietnam War," he said.
More recently, Clark defended Miles Lord, a
U.S. district court judge in Minnesota, who Clark
said "got upset because the Dalcon Shield (a
birth control device) had killed a bunch of
women . . . and because a very powerful corpo
ration. the Robinson Company (manufacturers
of the shield), spent millions and millions for
defense and not one penny for mercy."
Commenting on the appointment of Attorney
General Edwin Meese, Clark said: "We have
talented lawyers galore . . . from all of this wealth
and talent we choose a person who has
manifested clearly, in my judgment, no respect
for the Constitution or the Mill of Rights."
He said Meese was the "principal saboteur of
the Hill for National Legal Services." which he

called "the best chance we have for equal justice
under the law." Clark also mentioned that Meese
had led the fight to reinstitnte the tax deduction
for private schools, which Clark claims helps
promote racial segregation.
Turning to foreign policy. Clark criticized U.S.
involvement in Nicaragua. He pointed out that
the United States has a long history of involve
ment in Central America, going back to Thomas
Jefferson's comment that Cuba should be

"shaken from the Spanish tree."
Clark told the story of William Walker, "one
of these born-again types," who "set himself up
as the king of Nicaragua. ... His first two acts
were reinstating slavery and making English the
official language." Clark said that U.S. interven
tion in Nicaragua was "William Walker all over
again."
The speech was sponsored by the Stanford
Law Forum.
