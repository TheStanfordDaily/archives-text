# Card track at Walnut looking for top times
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Staff sportswriter 
Thirty-four athletes from the Stanford
men's and women's track teams will compete
in this weekend's prestigious Mount SAC
Relays at Walnut, cast of Los Angeles.
Considered "perhaps the top invitational in
the country" by Cardinal Asst. Coach Dave
Wollman, the SAC Relays attract the best
track athletes in the West.
Stanford enters the meet with the intention
of running "people in specific events in
quality competition to get best personal times
of the year," Wollman said. In the process,
Stanford hopes to qualify additional athletes
for both the Pacific 10 Conference cham
pionships May 24 and 25, and the NCAAs
May 31 and June 1.
Wollman also viewed the relays as "a
reward to the athletes for working so hard in
the dual meets. It's giving them a chance to
compete at an outstanding meet."
Perhaps the biggest surprise, or at least the

biggest improvement in a particular area, has
been evident in the Cardinal men's field
events. Previously thought of as questionable
at best, the throwers, leapers and vaulters of
the Cardinal men's team have consistently
made good for dual meet points.
A major portion of the field event success is
attributable to the emergence of freshmen
John Gash and David Picket in the pole vault.
Both Gash and Picket have cleared 16 feet,
something that no Stanford vaulter since 1 I H4
had done.
Another freshman who has figured
prominently is high jumper Brian Marshall,
who has recorded a leap of 7 feet, the best
Stanford jump in 12 years.
"We believe around here that there are
trends in great student athletes," said a
pleased Wollman, who coaches the field event
athletes. "Right now, the trend seems to be
with the athletes in the field events."
After the relays, the Cardinal will begin to
prepare for its dual meet against California
here next Saturday.
