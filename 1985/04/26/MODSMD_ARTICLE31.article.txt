Stanford's Margaret Pezzini went to
Moraga yesterday and came hack with some
late birthday presents — 14 runs and two
nonconference Softball victories over St.
Mary's.
Pezzini suffered knee ligament damage in a
collision with St. Mary's pitcher Kellie Hogue
in a home double-header loss to St. Mary's
March 12 and hasn't played since. Some of
Pezzini's Cardinal teammates used her injury
and her 20th birthday Monday for motivation
in a 3-0 Reno Invitational victory last Friday
over St. Mary's, which went on to a second
place finish.

Yesterday's 2-1 and 14-2 victories, which
raised Stanford's record to 13-45, were
"fun," Pezzini said, adding that her situation
provided inspiration but was not fueled by
animosity.
"I don't think it's all that," she said. "When
you play about 75 games a year, the games
are like practice and you need motivation. It's
kind of a joke now."
Stanford's Lisa Buchanan was playing bad
jokes on St. Mary's in the first game. Buc
hanan, 6-20, had five strikeouts and two of
the Cardinal's five hits to lead the way.
The Cardinal, behind winner Betsy Wat
son, 7-25, got a season-high 16 hits in the
second game.
