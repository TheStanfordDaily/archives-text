## 
### 
As the collegiate cycling season
winds down, the Stanford Criterium
and the Stanford Time Trial, which
will take place tomorrow and Sunday,
take on critical importance for the
Stanford cycling club.

close race for first place with UC-
Santa Barbara in the United States

race at 9:30, the Novice A race at

the Expert race at 1 p.m. On Sunday
there will be two races: a 100-
kilometer four-person team time trial
from Pescadero High School near
Highway 1 to Santa Cruz and back,
and an individual 30-kilometer time
trial.

nia, UC-Davis, Cal Poly-San Luis
