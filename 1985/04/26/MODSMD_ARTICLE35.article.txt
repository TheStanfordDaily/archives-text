## Launch-on-warning court battle goes on Stanford employee files a rebuttal 
### CLAY CALVERT 
A Stanford computer specialist has
filed a reply to the government's tes
timony in his battle to have
computer-launched nuclear attacks
declared unconstitutional.
Clifford Johnson, an employee of
the University's Information Tech
nology Services, said a response
issued by Justice Department lawyers
on behalf of Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger to Johnson's law -
suit appeal ignores the legal nature of
his claim.
The Justice Department's brief,
filed in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals earlier this month, stated
that the federal courts have no right
to decide the legality of launch-on
warning capability (LOWC).
"They were pretending it was a po
litical question when it was really a le
gal question," Johnson said, adding
that his reply includes "a government
Star Wars report that admits it's a le
gal question."

Johnson said he is now waiting for
the court to schedule an oral argu
ment on the "legal points" of his case,
noting that it will be at least two
months before such an argument
takes place.
"It's going to be quiet for a while,"
he said.
Johnson, who had previously been
handling the case himself, hired San
Francisco attorney Claudia Brisson to
represent him for the oral argument.
Brisson. a personal friend of Johnson,
had previously served as his adviser
earlier in the case.
"The court is not going to want to
talk to someone who is not an attor
ney," Johnson said.
Johnson initially filed suit against
the government in February 1984.
claiming that it is unconstitutional for
the president to delegate to a com
puter the decision to launch a nuclear
attack. The federal court at the time
ruled in the government's favor, al
though the presiding judge suggested
that Johnson undertake his present
appeal.
