The Sorrow and the Pity (1972)
Maison Francaise
Marcel Ophuls' four-and-a-half-hour
account of the German occupation of
France, as seen through the eyes of the
citizens of Clermont-Ferrand, is probably
the most trenchant and stirring documen
tary ever made. It is documentary as
Renoir might have approached it, and
indeed some of the true-life characters,
notably the Grave brothers, who fought
in the Resistance, and Pierre Mendes-
France, who escaped from prison, are
Renoiresque figures. The film is demo
cratic in the purest sense: Ophuls inter
views Anthony Eden, Britain's Secretary
of War, in 1940, as well as an officer in
the French division of the S.S. and a man
who claims he never saw any Germans in
Clermont-Ferrand. This is one of the rare
films that can be said to have made a con
tribution to art as well as to our under
standing of history.
Plays Thursday evening at 7.
The Big Chill (1983)
Memorial Auditorium
A glib, empty movie about the middle
aged crises of the children of the '60s,
written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan
(Barbara Benedek collaborated on the
screenplay), in which the jazzy montages
suggest rock videos and the musical selec
tions not only determine the editing but
also define the content of each scenc. A
group of college friends learns of the
suicide of one of their number and gat
hers to mourn him and re-examine their
own lives. In this movie about the tri
umph of friendship over the scariness of
the world outside, the women are warm
and maternal and a little dopey, and the
ultimate sacrifice to propagate the '60s
spirit occurs when one of them lets her
husband sleep with her best friend so that
she, too, can become a mother. Jeff
Goldblum and William Hurt give the best
performances; the cast also includes
Glenn Close, Kevin Kline, Mary Kay
Place, Tom Berenger, Jobeth Williams
and Meg Tilly.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 and 9:30.
Gunga Din (1939)
U.C.Theater, Berkeley
This comedy-adventure, set in colonial
India and suggested by Rudyard Kipling's
poem, is uproarious fun. Among the writ
ers who contributed to the screenplay
were Ben Hecht, Charles Mac Arthur,
William Faulkner, Fred Guiol and Joel
Sayre (though Faulkner is uncredited) —
it must be the most successful hand-me
down script before "Tootsie." The direc
tor, George Stevens, who replaced
Howard Hawks, was in fine form; after
"Alice Adams," this and "Swing Time"
are his best movies. The major cause for
celebration, though, is the teamwork of
Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and
Douglas Fairbanks. Jr. The cast also in
cludes Eduardo Ciannclli, Joan Fontaine,

Montagu Love, Cecil Kellaway, Abner
Biberman. Robert Coote and, in the title
role, Sam Jaffe, somewhere between his
days as the High Lama of Shangri-La and
his much later years as Dr. Zorba on the
"Ben Casey" TV show. Shot by Joseph
H. August.
Plays Monday with "The Rains
Came."
Joe Hill (1971)
U.C.Theater, Berkeley
The Swedish director Bo Widerberg
botched what should have been a great
movie. It looks absolutely smashing, and
his eye for detail is amazing; scene after
scene confirms what the legendary hero,
the labor organizer Joe Hill, thinks of
America — how big it is, how mag
nificent, how elusive — "so big you can
lose a brother in it." The film has a
mythical look about it; you can believe
that Paul Bunyans and Joe Hills bloom
full-grown out of it. But Widerberg cuts
Joe down before he has really become a
hero and then tells us, in a cynical finale,
that it was the International Workers of
the World that turned him into,a martyr
and a legend. (He tries to have it both
ways, showing us a land fertile enough to
create a mythic hero and then telling us it
ain't so.) Thomrny Berggren, whom
Widerberg also used in "Elvira
Madigan," gives a touching performance
in the title role.
Plays Wednesday with "Seeing Red."
A Place in the Sun (1951)
Cedar, San Francisco
George Stevens made this second film
version of Theodore Dreiser's "An
American Tragedy"; the first, by Josef
von Sternberg in 1931, was picketed by
Dreiser because he claimed it distorted
the vision of his novel, and chances are he
wouldn't have been too happy with this
one, either. (He died in 1945.) Dreiser
wrote a novel about a shrewd social clim
ber. an American urban variant on
Stendhal's Julien Sorel, who drowns the
pregnant mistress preventing his prog
ress. It's difficult to figure out the point of
view in the Michael Wilson-Harry Brown
screenplay, which is most peculiar. When
the hero (Montgomery Clift), in love with
a beautiful rich girl (Elizabeth Taylor),
takes his pregnant fiancee out for a row
on the lake, he intends to drown her but
changes his mind; then the boat capsizes
and she drowns without his help. In court,
he is judged guilty because he didn't try
to save her life. Puzzling or not, however,
it's a very powerful film, and if you saw it

when you were young enough you'll
probably remember the love scenes be
tween Clift and Taylor for the rest of your
life. These two give such touching perfor
mances that you can't buy the film's con
clusion at all; you walk, away believing
that their romance is the only morality.
Gift's portrayal of the troubled hero is
one of the signal pieces of acting in
movies of this era — it goes a long way

towards explaining why audiences went
wild over the Actors Studio generation of
Method performers. Shelley Winters,
whining and looking shockingly unat
tractive (considering what she looked like
in earlier pictures) plays the doomed girl,
Raymond Burr is the D.A., Anne Revere
is Gift's mother, and the stunning black
and-white photography is by William C.
Mellor.
Plays today and tomorrow with
"Suddenly, Last Summer."
Judgment at Nuremberg (1961)
Cedar, San Francisco
The movie that raised perhaps the
greatest unanswerable question of our
time — how do we begin to understand

and then to judge the executioners of the
Holocaust? — and then blithely answers
it. The director, Stanley Kramer, and the
screenwriter, Abby Mann, must have
slept very well after completing this
picture, knowing they had solved it for all
ol us, and in just over three hours, too.
Spencer Tracy plays the heroic judge.
Maximilan Schell the defense attorney,
Burt Lancaster is a Nazi, Judy Garland

and Montgomery Clift arc witnesses for
the prosecution, and then there are Mar
lene Dietrich, Richard Widmark, William
Shatner and others. In case you want to
laugh the whole thing off, Kramer inserts
some concentration camp footage to
sober you up.
Plays Sunday and Monday with "The
Young Lions."
Wild River (1960)
Cedar, San Francisco
A strange, messy, memorable film
about the Tennessee Valley Authority —
some of it is quite marvelous and some of
it is calamitous. Jo Van Fleet plays an
obstinate octogenarian who won't move
off her land, though the T.V.A. plans to

flood it; Montgomery Clift is the T.V.A.
man who falls in love with her
granddaughter (Lee Remick). Van
Fleet's performance might be better if she
didn't resort to a tremolo during her big
speeches, but it's really the screenwriter.
Paul Osborn, who does her in by giving
her a conscientious New York writer's
notion of Southern farmer's dialogue: "1
like things runnin' wild. . . . I'm agin bars
of any kind. ... I ain't a-goin' against na
ture, and I ain't a-crawlin' to the dang
guv-mint." As for Clift, he could never
pull off good liberal roles; he's a dead
spot in the center of the movie, and such
an asexual presence that you can't believe
he's slept with Lee Remick even when
the director, Elia Kazan, spells it out for
you. Lee Remick gives half of a fresh per
formance, though (until she becomes in
volved with Clift), and there are good
contributions by Albert Salmi as a local
tough and Jay C. Flippen as one of Van
Fleet's sons; James Westerfield, Frank
Overton, Barbara Loden and (briefly)
Bruce Dern are here as well. As he did in
"Baby Doll" five years earlier, Kazan
uses local non-actors in a number of bit
roles, and almost all of them are splendid.
The photographer, Ellsworth Fredericks,
is largely responsible for some of the
most lyrical moments, including an idyllic
shot of a ferry raft floating across the
river that makes it achingly clear what
these people are giving up. Based on
novels by Borden Deal and William
Bradford Hale.
Plays Tuesday through Thursday with
"Freud."
Winter Kills (1979)
York, San Francisco
William Richert, working out of a
Richard Condon novel, expands on the
two-gun conspiracy theory of JFK's
death; here, Kennedy is called Tim
Kegan, and the story unfolds about two
decades after his assassination, when his
kid brother (played by Jeff Bridges) re
investigates the facts of the event. The
movie introduces a nightclub owner
named Joe Diamond (!) who shot the al
leged assassin, and contains references to
the late prsident's affair with a film star
named Ella Mae Irving, but it's not really
in the Harold Robbins-Jacqueline
Susarin-Mario Puzo vein of gossip
column fiction: Not even on the most
basic narrative level are we intended to
take it seriously. It's full of Loony Tunes
characters impersonated by hammy ac
tors: John Huston as a randy, obscene
Big Daddy figure; Dorothy Malone as a
disconnected Southern belle with a

poodle; Sterling Hayden as a bizarre mil
lionaire who holds war games on the
fields of his estate; and Eli Wallach. An
thony Perkins, Richard Boone. Toshiro
Mifune (in the worst role of his distin
guished career; he plays a glorified
Japanese houseboy) and Belinda Bauer.
Dreadful as it is, the movie is often ter
rifically funny, and the delight of most of
the performers in it is undisguised.
Plays Tuesday with "Tangents."
Blade Runner (1982)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The Los Angeles of this film — set in
2019 —is a neon-dotted landscape with
electric fires flashing out of chimneys and
aircraft soaring overhead like hal
lucinatory bubbles; from below, you see
enormous advertising images projected
on floating screens and unceasing rain.
The director, Ridley Scott, the produc
tion designer. I.awrence G. Paull. and the
photographer, Jordan Croenenworth,
have created a future with enough visual
connections to the past and the present to
be particularly eerie, and Douglas
Turnbull's special effects are often as
tonishing. Yet it's a cold, repellent movie.
The story (from a wry sci-fi novel by
Philip K. Dick called "Do Androids
Dream of Electric Sheep") concerns a
bounty hunter assigned to "retire" a
deceptively human-seeming model of
robot and unable to do his job without
feeling guilt. But Ridley Scott is not the
right director for a movie that asks for
emotional fullness; his chief concern is
how to stage the violence in freshly
shocking, abstractly beautiful ways. With
Harrison Ford (who seems to be on auto
matic pilot), Rutger Hauer, Daryl Han
nah and others.
Plays Saturday through Monday with
"The Brother from Another Planet."
Cal (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
John Lynch plays Cal, a young Catholic
in modern-day Belfast who falls in love
with the widow (Helen Mirren) of a Prot
estant in whose murder he is implicated.
.Standing in the rain outside the library
where she works. Lynch is the picture of
shattered innocence, the emblem of lost
chances; we can see in his eyes that he's
doomed. He's a James Dean type,
leaking emotion, and he gets to be a pain,
especially when Cal enters his martyr
phase and starts burning himself with
cigarettes. The movie is worth seeing,
though, for director Pat O'Connor's un
hysterical portrayal of the daily indig
nities the people of Belfast suffer under
the yoke of a seemingly interminable civil
war, and even more for Donal McCann's
fine performance as Cal's father, who is
driven out of his home by Protestant ar
sonists. Bernard McLaverty wrote the
script.
Plays Thursday with "The Falcon and
the Snowman."

wild over the Actors Studio generation of
Method performers. Shelley Winters,
whining and looking shockingly unat
tractive (considering what she looked like
in earlier pictures) plays the doomed girl,
Raymond Burr is the D.A., Anne Revere
is Gift's mother, and the stunning black
and-white photography is by William C.
Mellor.
Plays today and tomorrow with
"Suddenly, Last Summer."
Judgment at Nuremberg (1961)
Cedar, San Francisco
The movie that raised perhaps the
greatest unanswerable question of our
time — how do we begin to understand

and then to judge the executioners of the
Holocaust? — and then blithely answers
it. The director, Stanley Kramer, and the
screenwriter, Abby Mann, must have
slept very well after completing this
picture, knowing they had solved it for all
ol us, and in just over three hours, too.
Spencer Tracy plays the heroic judge.
Maximilan Schell the defense attorney,
Burt Lancaster is a Nazi, Judy Garland

and Montgomery Clift arc witnesses for
the prosecution, and then there are Mar
lene Dietrich, Richard Widmark, William
Shatner and others. In case you want to
laugh the whole thing off, Kramer inserts
some concentration camp footage to
sober you up.
Plays Sunday and Monday with "The
Young Lions."
Wild River (1960)
Cedar, San Francisco
A strange, messy, memorable film
about the Tennessee Valley Authority —
some of it is quite marvelous and some of
it is calamitous. Jo Van Fleet plays an
obstinate octogenarian who won't move
off her land, though the T.V.A. plans to

flood it; Montgomery Clift is the T.V.A.
man who falls in love with her
granddaughter (Lee Remick). Van
Fleet's performance might be better if she
didn't resort to a tremolo during her big
speeches, but it's really the screenwriter.
Paul Osborn, who does her in by giving
her a conscientious New York writer's
notion of Southern farmer's dialogue: "1
like things runnin' wild. . . . I'm agin bars
of any kind. ... I ain't a-goin' against na
ture, and I ain't a-crawlin' to the dang
guv-mint." As for Clift, he could never
pull off good liberal roles; he's a dead
spot in the center of the movie, and such
an asexual presence that you can't believe
he's slept with Lee Remick even when
the director, Elia Kazan, spells it out for
you. Lee Remick gives half of a fresh per
formance, though (until she becomes in
volved with Clift), and there are good
contributions by Albert Salmi as a local
tough and Jay C. Flippen as one of Van
Fleet's sons; James Westerfield, Frank
Overton, Barbara Loden and (briefly)
Bruce Dern are here as well. As he did in
"Baby Doll" five years earlier, Kazan
uses local non-actors in a number of bit
roles, and almost all of them are splendid.
The photographer, Ellsworth Fredericks,
is largely responsible for some of the
most lyrical moments, including an idyllic
shot of a ferry raft floating across the
river that makes it achingly clear what
these people are giving up. Based on
novels by Borden Deal and William
Bradford Hale.
Plays Tuesday through Thursday with
"Freud."
Winter Kills (1979)
York, San Francisco
William Richert, working out of a
Richard Condon novel, expands on the
two-gun conspiracy theory of JFK's
death; here, Kennedy is called Tim
Kegan, and the story unfolds about two
decades after his assassination, when his
kid brother (played by Jeff Bridges) re
investigates the facts of the event. The
movie introduces a nightclub owner
named Joe Diamond (!) who shot the al
leged assassin, and contains references to
the late prsident's affair with a film star
named Ella Mae Irving, but it's not really
in the Harold Robbins-Jacqueline
Susarin-Mario Puzo vein of gossip
column fiction: Not even on the most
basic narrative level are we intended to
take it seriously. It's full of Loony Tunes
characters impersonated by hammy ac
tors: John Huston as a randy, obscene
Big Daddy figure; Dorothy Malone as a
disconnected Southern belle with a

poodle; Sterling Hayden as a bizarre mil
lionaire who holds war games on the
fields of his estate; and Eli Wallach. An
thony Perkins, Richard Boone. Toshiro
Mifune (in the worst role of his distin
guished career; he plays a glorified
Japanese houseboy) and Belinda Bauer.
Dreadful as it is, the movie is often ter
rifically funny, and the delight of most of
the performers in it is undisguised.
Plays Tuesday with "Tangents."
Blade Runner (1982)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The Los Angeles of this film — set in
2019 —is a neon-dotted landscape with
electric fires flashing out of chimneys and
aircraft soaring overhead like hal
lucinatory bubbles; from below, you see
enormous advertising images projected
on floating screens and unceasing rain.
The director, Ridley Scott, the produc
tion designer. I.awrence G. Paull. and the
photographer, Jordan Croenenworth,
have created a future with enough visual
connections to the past and the present to
be particularly eerie, and Douglas
Turnbull's special effects are often as
tonishing. Yet it's a cold, repellent movie.
The story (from a wry sci-fi novel by
Philip K. Dick called "Do Androids
Dream of Electric Sheep") concerns a
bounty hunter assigned to "retire" a
deceptively human-seeming model of
robot and unable to do his job without
feeling guilt. But Ridley Scott is not the
right director for a movie that asks for
emotional fullness; his chief concern is
how to stage the violence in freshly
shocking, abstractly beautiful ways. With
Harrison Ford (who seems to be on auto
matic pilot), Rutger Hauer, Daryl Han
nah and others.
Plays Saturday through Monday with
"The Brother from Another Planet."
Cal (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
John Lynch plays Cal, a young Catholic
in modern-day Belfast who falls in love
with the widow (Helen Mirren) of a Prot
estant in whose murder he is implicated.
.Standing in the rain outside the library
where she works. Lynch is the picture of
shattered innocence, the emblem of lost
chances; we can see in his eyes that he's
doomed. He's a James Dean type,
leaking emotion, and he gets to be a pain,
especially when Cal enters his martyr
phase and starts burning himself with
cigarettes. The movie is worth seeing,
though, for director Pat O'Connor's un
hysterical portrayal of the daily indig
nities the people of Belfast suffer under
the yoke of a seemingly interminable civil
war, and even more for Donal McCann's
fine performance as Cal's father, who is
driven out of his home by Protestant ar
sonists. Bernard McLaverty wrote the
script.
Plays Thursday with "The Falcon and
the Snowman."

The Sorrow and the Pity (1972)
Maison Francaise
Marcel Ophuls' four-and-a-half-hour
account of the German occupation of
France, as seen through the eyes of the
citizens of Clermont-Ferrand, is probably
the most trenchant and stirring documen
tary ever made. It is documentary as
Renoir might have approached it, and
indeed some of the true-life characters,
notably the Grave brothers, who fought
in the Resistance, and Pierre Mendes-
France, who escaped from prison, are
Renoiresque figures. The film is demo
cratic in the purest sense: Ophuls inter
views Anthony Eden, Britain's Secretary
of War, in 1940, as well as an officer in
the French division of the S.S. and a man
who claims he never saw any Germans in
Clermont-Ferrand. This is one of the rare
films that can be said to have made a con
tribution to art as well as to our under
standing of history.
Plays Thursday evening at 7.
The Big Chill (1983)
Memorial Auditorium
A glib, empty movie about the middle
aged crises of the children of the '60s,
written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan
(Barbara Benedek collaborated on the
screenplay), in which the jazzy montages
suggest rock videos and the musical selec
tions not only determine the editing but
also define the content of each scenc. A
group of college friends learns of the
suicide of one of their number and gat
hers to mourn him and re-examine their
own lives. In this movie about the tri
umph of friendship over the scariness of
the world outside, the women are warm
and maternal and a little dopey, and the
ultimate sacrifice to propagate the '60s
spirit occurs when one of them lets her
husband sleep with her best friend so that
she, too, can become a mother. Jeff
Goldblum and William Hurt give the best
performances; the cast also includes
Glenn Close, Kevin Kline, Mary Kay
Place, Tom Berenger, Jobeth Williams
and Meg Tilly.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 and 9:30.
Gunga Din (1939)
U.C.Theater, Berkeley
This comedy-adventure, set in colonial
India and suggested by Rudyard Kipling's
poem, is uproarious fun. Among the writ
ers who contributed to the screenplay
were Ben Hecht, Charles Mac Arthur,
William Faulkner, Fred Guiol and Joel
Sayre (though Faulkner is uncredited) —
it must be the most successful hand-me
down script before "Tootsie." The direc
tor, George Stevens, who replaced
Howard Hawks, was in fine form; after
"Alice Adams," this and "Swing Time"
are his best movies. The major cause for
celebration, though, is the teamwork of
Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and
Douglas Fairbanks. Jr. The cast also in
cludes Eduardo Ciannclli, Joan Fontaine,

Montagu Love, Cecil Kellaway, Abner
Biberman. Robert Coote and, in the title
role, Sam Jaffe, somewhere between his
days as the High Lama of Shangri-La and
his much later years as Dr. Zorba on the
"Ben Casey" TV show. Shot by Joseph
H. August.
Plays Monday with "The Rains
Came."
Joe Hill (1971)
U.C.Theater, Berkeley
The Swedish director Bo Widerberg
botched what should have been a great
movie. It looks absolutely smashing, and
his eye for detail is amazing; scene after
scene confirms what the legendary hero,
the labor organizer Joe Hill, thinks of
America — how big it is, how mag
nificent, how elusive — "so big you can
lose a brother in it." The film has a
mythical look about it; you can believe
that Paul Bunyans and Joe Hills bloom
full-grown out of it. But Widerberg cuts
Joe down before he has really become a
hero and then tells us, in a cynical finale,
that it was the International Workers of
the World that turned him into,a martyr
and a legend. (He tries to have it both
ways, showing us a land fertile enough to
create a mythic hero and then telling us it
ain't so.) Thomrny Berggren, whom
Widerberg also used in "Elvira
Madigan," gives a touching performance
in the title role.
Plays Wednesday with "Seeing Red."
A Place in the Sun (1951)
Cedar, San Francisco
George Stevens made this second film
version of Theodore Dreiser's "An
American Tragedy"; the first, by Josef
von Sternberg in 1931, was picketed by
Dreiser because he claimed it distorted
the vision of his novel, and chances are he
wouldn't have been too happy with this
one, either. (He died in 1945.) Dreiser
wrote a novel about a shrewd social clim
ber. an American urban variant on
Stendhal's Julien Sorel, who drowns the
pregnant mistress preventing his prog
ress. It's difficult to figure out the point of
view in the Michael Wilson-Harry Brown
screenplay, which is most peculiar. When
the hero (Montgomery Clift), in love with
a beautiful rich girl (Elizabeth Taylor),
takes his pregnant fiancee out for a row
on the lake, he intends to drown her but
changes his mind; then the boat capsizes
and she drowns without his help. In court,
he is judged guilty because he didn't try
to save her life. Puzzling or not, however,
it's a very powerful film, and if you saw it

when you were young enough you'll
probably remember the love scenes be
tween Clift and Taylor for the rest of your
life. These two give such touching perfor
mances that you can't buy the film's con
clusion at all; you walk, away believing
that their romance is the only morality.
Gift's portrayal of the troubled hero is
one of the signal pieces of acting in
movies of this era — it goes a long way

towards explaining why audiences went
wild over the Actors Studio generation of
Method performers. Shelley Winters,
whining and looking shockingly unat
tractive (considering what she looked like
in earlier pictures) plays the doomed girl,
Raymond Burr is the D.A., Anne Revere
is Gift's mother, and the stunning black
and-white photography is by William C.
Mellor.

matic pilot), Rutger Hauer, Daryl Han
nah and others.
Plays Saturday through Monday with
"The Brother from Another Planet."
Cal (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
John Lynch plays Cal, a young Catholic
in modern-day Belfast who falls in love
with the widow (Helen Mirren) of a Prot
estant in whose murder he is implicated.
.Standing in the rain outside the library
where she works. Lynch is the picture of
shattered innocence, the emblem of lost
chances; we can see in his eyes that he's
doomed. He's a James Dean type,
leaking emotion, and he gets to be a pain,
especially when Cal enters his martyr
phase and starts burning himself with
cigarettes. The movie is worth seeing,
though, for director Pat O'Connor's un
hysterical portrayal of the daily indig
nities the people of Belfast suffer under
the yoke of a seemingly interminable civil
war, and even more for Donal McCann's
fine performance as Cal's father, who is
driven out of his home by Protestant ar
sonists. Bernard McLaverty wrote the
script.
Plays Thursday with "The Falcon and
the Snowman."

The Sorrow and the Pity (1972)
Maison Francaise
Marcel Ophuls' four-and-a-half-hour
account of the German occupation of
France, as seen through the eyes of the
citizens of Clermont-Ferrand, is probably
the most trenchant and stirring documen
tary ever made. It is documentary as
Renoir might have approached it, and
indeed some of the true-life characters,
notably the Grave brothers, who fought
in the Resistance, and Pierre Mendes-
France, who escaped from prison, are
Renoiresque figures. The film is demo
cratic in the purest sense: Ophuls inter
views Anthony Eden, Britain's Secretary
of War, in 1940, as well as an officer in
the French division of the S.S. and a man
who claims he never saw any Germans in
Clermont-Ferrand. This is one of the rare
films that can be said to have made a con
tribution to art as well as to our under
standing of history.
Plays Thursday evening at 7.
The Big Chill (1983)
Memorial Auditorium
A glib, empty movie about the middle
aged crises of the children of the '60s,
written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan
(Barbara Benedek collaborated on the
screenplay), in which the jazzy montages
suggest rock videos and the musical selec
tions not only determine the editing but
also define the content of each scenc. A
group of college friends learns of the
suicide of one of their number and gat
hers to mourn him and re-examine their
own lives. In this movie about the tri
umph of friendship over the scariness of
the world outside, the women are warm
and maternal and a little dopey, and the
ultimate sacrifice to propagate the '60s
spirit occurs when one of them lets her
husband sleep with her best friend so that
she, too, can become a mother. Jeff
Goldblum and William Hurt give the best
performances; the cast also includes
Glenn Close, Kevin Kline, Mary Kay
Place, Tom Berenger, Jobeth Williams
and Meg Tilly.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 and 9:30.
Gunga Din (1939)
U.C.Theater, Berkeley
This comedy-adventure, set in colonial
India and suggested by Rudyard Kipling's
poem, is uproarious fun. Among the writ
ers who contributed to the screenplay
were Ben Hecht, Charles Mac Arthur,
William Faulkner, Fred Guiol and Joel
Sayre (though Faulkner is uncredited) —
it must be the most successful hand-me
down script before "Tootsie." The direc
tor, George Stevens, who replaced
Howard Hawks, was in fine form; after
"Alice Adams," this and "Swing Time"
are his best movies. The major cause for
celebration, though, is the teamwork of
Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and
Douglas Fairbanks. Jr. The cast also in
cludes Eduardo Ciannclli, Joan Fontaine,

Montagu Love, Cecil Kellaway, Abner
Biberman. Robert Coote and, in the title
role, Sam Jaffe, somewhere between his
days as the High Lama of Shangri-La and
his much later years as Dr. Zorba on the
"Ben Casey" TV show. Shot by Joseph
H. August.
Plays Monday with "The Rains
Came."
Joe Hill (1971)
U.C.Theater, Berkeley
The Swedish director Bo Widerberg
botched what should have been a great
movie. It looks absolutely smashing, and
his eye for detail is amazing; scene after
scene confirms what the legendary hero,
the labor organizer Joe Hill, thinks of
America — how big it is, how mag
nificent, how elusive — "so big you can
lose a brother in it." The film has a
mythical look about it; you can believe
that Paul Bunyans and Joe Hills bloom
full-grown out of it. But Widerberg cuts
Joe down before he has really become a
hero and then tells us, in a cynical finale,
that it was the International Workers of
the World that turned him into,a martyr
and a legend. (He tries to have it both
ways, showing us a land fertile enough to
create a mythic hero and then telling us it
ain't so.) Thomrny Berggren, whom
Widerberg also used in "Elvira
Madigan," gives a touching performance
in the title role.
Plays Wednesday with "Seeing Red."
A Place in the Sun (1951)
Cedar, San Francisco
George Stevens made this second film
version of Theodore Dreiser's "An
American Tragedy"; the first, by Josef
von Sternberg in 1931, was picketed by
Dreiser because he claimed it distorted
the vision of his novel, and chances are he
wouldn't have been too happy with this
one, either. (He died in 1945.) Dreiser
wrote a novel about a shrewd social clim
ber. an American urban variant on
Stendhal's Julien Sorel, who drowns the
pregnant mistress preventing his prog
ress. It's difficult to figure out the point of
view in the Michael Wilson-Harry Brown
screenplay, which is most peculiar. When
the hero (Montgomery Clift), in love with
a beautiful rich girl (Elizabeth Taylor),
takes his pregnant fiancee out for a row
on the lake, he intends to drown her but
changes his mind; then the boat capsizes
and she drowns without his help. In court,
he is judged guilty because he didn't try
to save her life. Puzzling or not, however,
it's a very powerful film, and if you saw it

when you were young enough you'll
probably remember the love scenes be
tween Clift and Taylor for the rest of your
life. These two give such touching perfor
mances that you can't buy the film's con
clusion at all; you walk, away believing
that their romance is the only morality.
Gift's portrayal of the troubled hero is
one of the signal pieces of acting in
movies of this era — it goes a long way

towards explaining why audiences went
wild over the Actors Studio generation of
Method performers. Shelley Winters,
whining and looking shockingly unat
tractive (considering what she looked like
in earlier pictures) plays the doomed girl,
Raymond Burr is the D.A., Anne Revere
is Gift's mother, and the stunning black
and-white photography is by William C.
Mellor.
Plays today and tomorrow with
"Suddenly, Last Summer."
Judgment at Nuremberg (1961)
Cedar, San Francisco
The movie that raised perhaps the
greatest unanswerable question of our
time — how do we begin to understand

and then to judge the executioners of the
Holocaust? — and then blithely answers
it. The director, Stanley Kramer, and the
screenwriter, Abby Mann, must have
slept very well after completing this
picture, knowing they had solved it for all
ol us, and in just over three hours, too.
Spencer Tracy plays the heroic judge.
Maximilan Schell the defense attorney,
Burt Lancaster is a Nazi, Judy Garland

and Montgomery Clift arc witnesses for
the prosecution, and then there are Mar
lene Dietrich, Richard Widmark, William
Shatner and others. In case you want to
laugh the whole thing off, Kramer inserts
some concentration camp footage to
sober you up.
Plays Sunday and Monday with "The
Young Lions."
Wild River (1960)
Cedar, San Francisco
A strange, messy, memorable film
about the Tennessee Valley Authority —
some of it is quite marvelous and some of
it is calamitous. Jo Van Fleet plays an
obstinate octogenarian who won't move
off her land, though the T.V.A. plans to

flood it; Montgomery Clift is the T.V.A.
man who falls in love with her
granddaughter (Lee Remick). Van
Fleet's performance might be better if she
didn't resort to a tremolo during her big
speeches, but it's really the screenwriter.
Paul Osborn, who does her in by giving
her a conscientious New York writer's
notion of Southern farmer's dialogue: "1
like things runnin' wild. . . . I'm agin bars
of any kind. ... I ain't a-goin' against na
ture, and I ain't a-crawlin' to the dang
guv-mint." As for Clift, he could never
pull off good liberal roles; he's a dead
spot in the center of the movie, and such
an asexual presence that you can't believe
he's slept with Lee Remick even when
the director, Elia Kazan, spells it out for
you. Lee Remick gives half of a fresh per
formance, though (until she becomes in
volved with Clift), and there are good
contributions by Albert Salmi as a local
tough and Jay C. Flippen as one of Van
Fleet's sons; James Westerfield, Frank
Overton, Barbara Loden and (briefly)
Bruce Dern are here as well. As he did in
"Baby Doll" five years earlier, Kazan
uses local non-actors in a number of bit
roles, and almost all of them are splendid.
The photographer, Ellsworth Fredericks,
is largely responsible for some of the
most lyrical moments, including an idyllic
shot of a ferry raft floating across the
river that makes it achingly clear what
these people are giving up. Based on
novels by Borden Deal and William
Bradford Hale.
Plays Tuesday through Thursday with
"Freud."
Winter Kills (1979)
York, San Francisco
William Richert, working out of a
Richard Condon novel, expands on the
two-gun conspiracy theory of JFK's
death; here, Kennedy is called Tim
Kegan, and the story unfolds about two
decades after his assassination, when his
kid brother (played by Jeff Bridges) re
investigates the facts of the event. The
movie introduces a nightclub owner
named Joe Diamond (!) who shot the al
leged assassin, and contains references to
the late prsident's affair with a film star
named Ella Mae Irving, but it's not really
in the Harold Robbins-Jacqueline
Susarin-Mario Puzo vein of gossip
column fiction: Not even on the most
basic narrative level are we intended to
take it seriously. It's full of Loony Tunes
characters impersonated by hammy ac
tors: John Huston as a randy, obscene
Big Daddy figure; Dorothy Malone as a
disconnected Southern belle with a

poodle; Sterling Hayden as a bizarre mil
lionaire who holds war games on the
fields of his estate; and Eli Wallach. An
thony Perkins, Richard Boone. Toshiro
Mifune (in the worst role of his distin
guished career; he plays a glorified
Japanese houseboy) and Belinda Bauer.
Dreadful as it is, the movie is often ter
rifically funny, and the delight of most of
the performers in it is undisguised.
Plays Tuesday with "Tangents."
Blade Runner (1982)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The Los Angeles of this film — set in
2019 —is a neon-dotted landscape with
electric fires flashing out of chimneys and
aircraft soaring overhead like hal
lucinatory bubbles; from below, you see
enormous advertising images projected
on floating screens and unceasing rain.
The director, Ridley Scott, the produc
tion designer. I.awrence G. Paull. and the
photographer, Jordan Croenenworth,
have created a future with enough visual
connections to the past and the present to
be particularly eerie, and Douglas
Turnbull's special effects are often as
tonishing. Yet it's a cold, repellent movie.
The story (from a wry sci-fi novel by
Philip K. Dick called "Do Androids
Dream of Electric Sheep") concerns a
bounty hunter assigned to "retire" a
deceptively human-seeming model of
robot and unable to do his job without
feeling guilt. But Ridley Scott is not the
right director for a movie that asks for
emotional fullness; his chief concern is
how to stage the violence in freshly
shocking, abstractly beautiful ways. With
Harrison Ford (who seems to be on auto
matic pilot), Rutger Hauer, Daryl Han
nah and others.
Plays Saturday through Monday with
"The Brother from Another Planet."
Cal (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
John Lynch plays Cal, a young Catholic
