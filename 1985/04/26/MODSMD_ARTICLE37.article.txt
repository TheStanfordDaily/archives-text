### Senior staff writer By BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
Despite publicity banners defaced
with Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion (PLO) slogans, a rally celebrat
ing the 37th anniversary of the found
ing of Israel went as scheduled yester
day afternoon, attracting approxi
mately 300 people.
Those attending the White Plaza
rally could go for a camel ride, buy
felafel for lunch, dance the hora and
pjck up information on Israel at
nearby booths. In addition, Amos Oz.
a prominent Israeli journalist and
writer, addressed the rally on the
luture of Israel.
Prior to Oz's speech, Michael Bun
zel, chairman of the Israel Action
Committee, denounced the party re
sponsible for defacing banners adver
tising Israel Week. As of yesterday,
no groups or persons had admitted
responsibility for defacing the ban
ners Wednesday.
"Unfortunately, some members of
the Stanford community mirror the
same attitudes as their Arab counter
parts," Bunzel said. Banners
throughout campus had PLO slogans
spray-painted on them, and PLO
flags were placed next to banners at
tached to a fence.
Oz, who has lived in Israel more
than 37 years, said the founding of Is

rael revealed much about the charac
ter of the Jewish people.
"Visionaries and dreamers dreamt
of creating no less than a heaven on
earth," Oz said. "And these aspira
tions are still pulsating through the
state of Israel today."
Author of "In the Land of Israel,"

Oz. also spoke on the "incredibly high
expectations of the outside world for
turning the other cheek."
"Even though we are often in
furiated by norms set for Israel by
outside forces, nonetheless, we also
cherish the same ideals for our
selves," he said.

O7 called for cooperation between
nations of the Middle East and
claimed that the need for peace
should be as great for Israel's neigh
bors as it is for Israel.
Though Israel is divided by diver
sity, "this is what a drama at work is
all about," Oz said.
