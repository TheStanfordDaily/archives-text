### SHIRISH DATE Senior stuff writer 
Several faculty members yesterday
urged the Faculty Senate committee
investigating Hoover-Stanford ties ti>
reeonimend radically altering the cur
rent relationship.
An open forum held by the Com
mittee on the Relation Between the
Hoover Institution and the Profes
soriate at Stanford drew about 20 fac
ulty members, a number of whom
were sharply critical of Hoover be
cause of a perceived "conservative
bent."
Political Science Prof. John Manley
said the Stanford-Hoover link en
hances Hoover's image but hurts
Stanford's reputation as a non
partisan institution. "To the extent
that Hoover is partisan and political
. . . Stanford is inevitably drawn into
partisan and political activities." he
said. "We cannot continue to ignore

the invaluable assistance and
legitimacy Hoover gets from its asso
ciation with a great university ."
Assoc. Dean of Education Hans
Weiler said Hoover's criteria for
choosing scholars are considerably
less demanding than those of the Uni
versity. but "once you [travel east] of
Fresno, it becomes \er\ clear that
whatever comes out of Hoover is con
sidered part of Stanford."
English Prof. Ronald Rebhol/ said
Hoover intentionally uses its affilia
tion with Stanford to further its politi
cal aims, most notably through a pro
grain designed to submit articles to
newspapers across the nation.
"The institution has used the media
to place what must he approaching,
since l l )77. 1.500 op-ed articles ex
pressing mainly conservative posi
tions. and it boasts of this fact." he
said. "No department or school of
this universitv would boast of the

number of new spaper editorial essays
its members had published, but no
department or school shares
Hoover's political mission."
Mam forum participants pointed
out that Hoover's procedure for
choosing research fellow s is markedly
different from the University's
process of choosing faculty. While
professors here are chosen through
search committees and department
approval, staff selection at Hoover is
almost entirely in the hands of the
director. the\ said.
"Most departmental chairmen
would be lynched" if the) chose fac
1111\ members the was W. Glenn
Campbell, director of the Hoover In
stitution. picks research fellows, said
Van Harvey, professor of religious
studies.
Rebholx echoed that sentiment,
likening the directorship of Hoover to
an absolute monarch\. "As Louis

XIV said, 'L'etat. e'est moi," Glenn
Campbell can say 'The Hoover Insti
tution. I am it." " Rebholz said.
Some participants cited dangers of
Hoover's autonomy apart from the
differing procedures for appoint
ments. Biology Prof. Craig Heller
said Hoover "unilaterally" ap
proached the Reagan administration
about bringing the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library to Stanford. He
said the ensuing conflict regarding a
proposed policy center here brought
national attention that was not in
Stanford's best interest.
"I'm not sure the outcome of this
whole mess is the one that we would
have wished . . . had we deliberated
beforehand, Do we want the presi
dential library at Stanford?" " Heller
said.
