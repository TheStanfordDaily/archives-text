# C-IR abstains on 2 Sullivan votes
## 
### BARBARA SCHULER Senior staff writer 
A Stanford committee voted April
11 to abstain on shareholder resolu
tions urging two companies to sign
the Sullivan Principles, a code of con
duct for U.S. companies that operate
in South Africa, the University News
Service reported yesterday.
After reviewing the South Africa
operations of the Timken Company
and Kimberly Clark, the Commission
on Investment Responsibility (C-IR)
voted 9-3 in favor of abstention. "We
were satisfied that they were comply
ing with the aims of the Sullivan Prin
ciples." according to Richard Brody,
professor of political science and C
IR chairman.
C-IR did vote 11-1 in favor of
sending letters to both Timken and
Kimberly Clark urging them to sign
the document.
In explaining the abstention, Brody
cited progress in housing for black
employees and Timken's "active lob
bying against influx control laws, one
on-one with the government of South
Africa." Influx control prohibits un
employed blacks from living in urban
areas, forcing them to return to the
bantustans. or "homelands."
The commission guidelines for
voting "yes" on a shareholder pro
posal require that the resolution
"make a specific allegation that the
company is causing social injury in
South Africa." according to C-IR
member Mark Landesmann.
Because a company's status as a
non-signatory poses "no explicit
threat of social injury." the commis
sion decided it could not support the
resolution. Landesmann said.
Charging that the qualification is
"absurd." Landesmann said. "Even it
you think the companies should sign
the Sullivan Principles, the guidelines
make it impossible for you to vote yes
on a shareholder resolution."
However, sending "a letter shows
those companies that we are very un
easy about (their) refusal to sign."
Landesmann said.
Currently, 19 of the 97 corpora
tions m the Stanford portfolio that
operate in South Africa have refused
to sign the Sullivan Principles.
Authored in 1977 by Rev. Leon Sul
livan. a Philadelphia pastor and mem
ber of the General Motors board of
directors, the document serves as one
of the primary means of assessing
corporate conduct in South Africa.
Many companies sav they choose
not to sign because the reporting

process necessary for compliance
with the principles — a cost sig
natories agree to hear — is too ex
pensive, Landesmann said.
Brody offered other explanations.
"Some may think their operations are
too small or that they don't want
somebody sticking his nose in their
business. . . . They'll answer ques
tions of stockholders but they don't
want to have to report to Arthur D.
Little," the firm charged with review
ing and rating companies on their
progress toward the goals of the Sul
livan Principles.

Those goals include workplace
desegregation and greater opportuni
ties for advancement by black
workers. Recently, however, the
principles have been revised to in
clude greater political advocacy by
the companies on behalf of their
black employees.
Those who call the principles in
adequate note that less than I percent
of the black South African labor force
works in I S. companies or their sub
sidiaries.
Others insist that reform in the
workplace is not enough. According
to a 1952 National Security Affairs
monograph. "Advances in opportuni
ties lor blacks in the business sector
do not fundamentally alter the reality
of political apartheid."
l.andesmann agreed with that view,
calling the Sullivan Principles "a cold
drop of water on a hot stone."
I he C-IR vote on Timken also
raised concerns over conflict of inter
est. l.andesmann noted that William
I imken. the chairman ol the company's
hoard, is a member ot the Stan
ford Board ot Trustees and sits on its
investment committee.
