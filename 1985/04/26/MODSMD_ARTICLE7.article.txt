Soviets accused of blocking talks
WASHINGTON — U.S. arms control director Kenneth Adelman,
challenging Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, said yesterday the United
States had discussed "Star Wars" extensively with Soviet negotiators at
the recently recessed nuclear weapons talks in Geneva.
Adelman, in an Associated Press interview, accused the Soviets of
blocking progress in the first round of negotiation*, which ended Tues
day in the Swiss city. "It was a very tough round," he said.
Gorbachev said Tuesday in Moscow that the U.S. negotiators had vio
lated the accord that set up the talks by not linking discussion of space
based weapons with medium-range and strategic nuclear missiles.
1 he Soviet leader also said the United States had shown in the first
round that it was not interested in an agreement.
Adelman disagreed. "The U.S. came in with greater flexibility and
dogged determination to move the arms control process along," he said.
" The Soviets came into the first round with greater rigidity and dogged
determination to have SDI (the Strategic Defense Initiative) block prog
ress."
Referring to Gorbachev, Adelman said, "We have a new man in the
Kremlin but no new ideas. In fact, the new man came up with all the
same propaganda positions as the old men had, time and again, before."
Asked if the U.S. negotiators had put the high-technology defensive
system also known as "Star Wars" on the table, Adelman replied: "We
are discussing SDI extensively in Geneva."
He said the research program was "fully permitted" by the 1972 U.S.-
Soviet Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty and that compliance with a ban on re
search could not be verified.
On the other hand, Adelman said deployment of an anti-missile
defense system was prohibited by the treaty, which limited defensive
measures in order to discourage nuclear attack. "So the first job is to
reinvigorate the ABM treaty and stop Soviet violations," he said.
Two weeks ago, in an interview. Secretary of State George Shultz said
the Soviets had not responded in Geneva to U.S. proposals for reducing
offensive nuclear arms. Other U.S. officials have also indicated there
was little progress in Geneva.
Lebanese strafe Palestinian camp
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Lebanese air force jets strafed a Palestinian
refugee camp outside Sidon yesterday after Palestinian guerrillas and
Moslem militiamen overran a Christian suburb, Sidon-based Lebanese
reporters said.
In dispatches to Beirut from south Lebanon's third-largest city, the
reporters said one Palestinian was killed and 17 people wounded when
the two Hawker Hunter jets fired pn the camp with 30mm cannon.
The planes, believed to be the only combat planes in the Lebanese air
force, fired on the Ein el-Hilweh camp on Sidon's eastern edge after
making two low passes, the reports said.
It was the first time the Lebanese warplanes had been seen in action in
more than a year. Lebanese military authorities in Beirut declined com
ment on the reported strafing.
Military sources in Tel Aviv said no Israeli warplanes were in the air at
the time.
In Beirut, Christian and Moslem militiamen fought in the middle of
the city and sent rockets and shells crashing into residential neighbor
hoods. Police said six people were killed in west Beirut and 15 wounded.
The new battles in Beirut and Sidon broke out less than 24 hours after
Lebanon's Moslem leaders announced agreement in Damascus on steps
to halt fighting in the battered cities.
At the Damascus meeting it was announced that President Hafez As
sad of Syria had persuaded Prime Minister Rashid Karami of Lebanon
to withdraw the resignation of his national unity government.
The resignation last week had threatened to end the year-old unity
government of Lebanon and confront Lebanese President Amin
Gemayel with a new political crisis. Karami had been strongly backed by
the Syrians who are trying to assert their political strength in Lebanon as
the Israeli occupation army withdraws from the south.
In Sidon yesterday morning, Palestinian guerrillas from the Ein el-
Hilweh refugee camp joined forces with Moslem militiamen and
stormed suburban Darb es-Sim, three miles southeast of Sidon. Pillars of
smoke were reported rising over the suburb.
Bitburg visit remains uncertain
WASHINGTON — The White House ducked questions about a still
planned presidential trip to a German military cemetery yesterday as
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl thanked President Reagan for
"the noble gesture of a friend."
"We are not answering Bitburg questions; there has been no change in
the president's plans," spokesman Larry Speakes said, using the name of
the graveyard that has embroiled the White House in controversy over
the scheduled May 5 visit. The cemetery contains the graves of some
2,000 German war dead, including 47 Nazi SS troops.
Kohl thanked Reagan for going ahead with the visit in a speech to the
West German parliament in Bonn.
Another White House official, who frequently speaks to reporters on
grounds that his name not be used, declined to go beyond Speakes' com
ments even under the cloak of anonymity. He said he thought Speakes
had put the situation correctly.
White House chief of staff Donald Regan said Wednesday that
Reagan would definitely go to Bitburg but that plans for the ceremony,
in which the president has been scheduled to lay a wreath, were still
being discussed with officials in Bonn.
Speakes would say only that there had been "no change in the presi
dent's plans" and that "all facets of trips are always under discussion."
Reagan leaves Tuesday for a 10-day European trip including an eco
nomic summit conference in Bonn.
An administration official said privately Wednesday that Reagan at
tempted to talk his way out of the cemetery visit during a telephone con
versation with Kohl last Friday, but the chancellor was adamant that Bit
burg remain on their joint schedule.
Witnesses held in abduction case
MEXICO CITY — Mexican authorities are holding three material
witnesses who reportedly saw two American citizens abducted in
Guadalajara last Jan. 30, U.S. ambassador John Gavin said yesterday.
U.S. officials said investigations so far would indicate there is little
hope that the missing Americans are still alive.
The names of the witnesses have not been released, but the embassy
said their depositions indicated the Americans may have been victims of
Mexican drug traffickers who mistook them for U. S. drug investigators.
The two missing Americans are John Walker of Minneapolis and Al
berto Radelat of Fort Worth. Tex., who were last seen on Jan. 30 in
Guadalajara. At the time of their disappearance, witnesses were quoted
as saying they saw the Americans going into a restaurant.
WWII veterans join in ceremony
TORGAU. East Germany — American and Soviet war veterans met
yesterday at the Elbe River despite an official U.S. boycott to issue an
appeal for peace and relive the da\ 40 years ago that they linked up.
slicing Nazi Germany in half.
The United States refused to send an official delegation to the cere
mony to protest the death of U.S. Army Maj. Arthur Nicholson, who
was shot by Soviet soldiers near a Soviet military base in East Germany
on March 24.
The shooting upset the American veterans but "this is a commemora
tion that furthers the cause of reconciliation," said John Gilman, an
army veteran from Milwaukee. Wis.
At a news conference, six Soviet veterans said the lack of official U.S.
participation had taken some of the luster off the gathering.
"I can only say it was regrettable that (Reagan) did not even send us a
message. If he had done so, this would have been a further contribution
to a better atmosphere between our nations." said Georgi Stetsenko,
speaking in Russian.
