## Contras assail House aid vote 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” Two Nicaraguan rebel
leaders yesterday assailed the House rejection of
new U.S. aid to the resistance fighters as a
"communist victory," while the Reagan adminis
tration vowed not to give up its struggle to get
money for the Contras.
"We will be back and back and back until
America does the right thing," Vice President
George Bush said in a television interview.
"We are not going to turn our backs on those
who are fighting for democracy in our own hemi
sphere to the favor of those who are trying to es
tablish a Marxist-Leninist dictatorship in Central
America," Bush said.
At the White House, spokesman Larry Speakes
said: "The point is, the president will not abandon
his goal of finding funding for the freedom fighters
in Central America." Speakes said the administra
tion was looking for ways to force new votes on the
issue.
Under parliamentary ground rules, the adminis
tration could revive the $14 million proposal by
next Tuesday.
House Majority Leader Jim Wright (D-Texas)
said the Contra aid issue would be back, "but not

between now and Tuesday," despite Speakes' as
sertion.
Wright said "there is a widespread feeling" in
Central America and on Capitol Hill that Reagan
"will not he satisfied until he has American troops
down there." The majority leader said that was not
necessarily his opinion.
The House on Wednesday night rejected a com
promise Republican proposal to provide the
rightist Contras seeking to overthrow Nicaragua's
leftist government with $14 million in non-lethal
assistance. The night before, it had voted down
Reagan's original request that the money be used
in direct military aid.
On Capitol Hill. Nicaraguan rebel leader Al
fonso Robelo told a news conference, "The debate
in the Congress has resulted in a communist vic
tory; but the civil war in Nicaragua continues."
With Robelo was Adolfo Calero. head of the
Nicaraguan Democratic Force, the largest of the
rebel groups fighting the Sandinista government.
A statement that the two leaders issued on behalf
of a coalition of opposition forces said four liberal
Democrats in particular have a responsibility to
seek Nicaraguan agreement to hold internal peace

talks because of their leadership role in rallying op
position to renewed aid for the rebels.
Robelo. reading the statement to reporters, men
tioned House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-
Mass.), Rep. Michael Barnes (D-Md.), and Sens.
John Kerry (D-Mass.) and Tom Harkin (D-Iowa).
"We call on them publicly to put pressure on the
Sandinstas to come to the negotiating table," the
statement said. "By defeating the president and
preventing him from applying pressure on the San
dinistas, they now have a responsibility to apply it."
The Sandinistas previously have rejected the
idea of talks with the rebels, saying they are a crea
tion of the CIA.
O'Neill, who has derided the Contras as
"maimers and butchers," said yesterday that mail
and calls to his office were running 1,000-to-l
against the president's policy.
Meanwhile, the State Department said it was
pleased with the Sandinista announcement on
Wednesday that 107 political prisoners were being
released But spokesman Bernard Kalb added, "it
is imperative that the Sandinista government take
steps to release all political prisoners and begin a
process of internal reconciliation."
