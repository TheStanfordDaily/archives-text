# Shultz links Nicaragua, Vietnam
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Secretary of
State George Shultz implored
America yesterday to shake free from
the shackles of self-doubt spawned by
Vietnam and recommit itself to fight
ing Communism — especially in
Nicaragua.
In an abrupt break with the Reagan
administration s prior assertions of
the vast differences between U.S. in
volvement in Vietnam and Central
America, Shultz sought to link the
two together.
"Can we afford to be naive again
about the consequences when we pull
back, about the special ruthlessness
of Communist rule?" he asked in a
speech commemorating the 10th an
niversary of the conquest of South
Vietnam on April 30, 1975.
Warning that "the litany of apology
for communists and condemnation
for America and our friends is begin
ning again," Shultz asked: "Do the
American people really accept the
notion that we, and our friends, are
the representatives of evil?"
While Shultz appeared to be saying
the United States should not be con
tent to lose in Nicaragua, as it did in
Vietnam, he offered no formula for
victory against the leftist Sandinista
government and never suggested that
U.S. combat troops be introduced
into the conflict.
Asked whether Shultz was advo
cating an increased U.S. role in

Central America, State Department
spokesman Bernard Kalb replied: "I
am not going to interpret the secre
tary's speech. It has to stand on its
own." Nor would he say whether it
had been approved in advance by the
White House.
The secretary implied, but did not
directly state, that the "suffering and
misery" inflicted upon Indochinese in
the past decade could be repeated in
Central America if the United States

abandons its cause there.
"Vietnam and Central America —
I want to tackle this analogy head-on.
Our goals in Central America are like
those we had in Vietnam: democracy,
economic progress and security
against aggression," he said.
"Broken promises. Communist
dictatorship. Refugees. Widened So
viet influence, this time near our very
borders. Here is your parallel be
tween Vietnam and Central

America,"he asserted.
Shultz said "brave Nicaraguans" —
the Contras fighting the government
— "deserve our support. They are
struggling to prevent the consolida
tion and expansion of communist
vower on our doorstep."
"Those who assure us that these
dire consequences are not in prospect
are some of those who assured us of
the same in Indochina before 1975,"
he said.
"How many times must we learn
the same lesson?" he asked.
Declaring that "the larger lesson of
the past decade is that when America
lost faith in herself, world stability
suffered and freedom lost ground,"
Shultz pledged: "This must never
happen again."
Speaking in the State Department
lobby, with hundreds of employees
listening, Shultz said the"cost of fail
ure was high" in Vietnam.
"The price was paid, in the first in
stance, by the more than 30 million
people we left behind to fall under
Communist rule. But America, and
the world, also paid a price."
America's retreat from global lead
ership "created a vacuum that was
exploited by our adversaries," Shultz
declared. "The Soviets . . . took ad
vantage of our inhibitions and
projected their power to unprece
dented lengths."
