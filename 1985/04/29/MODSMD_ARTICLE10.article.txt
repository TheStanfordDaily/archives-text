Shuttle includes animals
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — While the
seven-man human crew received final briefings,
24 doomed rats and two squirrel monkeys named
"3165" and "384-80" were loaded aboard the
space shuttle Challenger, ready for today's start
on a seven-day scientific mission.
Using ropes, pulleys and platforms, workmen
lowered the monkeys and the rats down Chal
lenger's middeck, through a tunnel and into the
Spacelab.
Animal rights groups have said they will picket
the Kennedy Space Center today.
"Challenger's liftoff means that every painful
experiment performed on animals on Earth will
now be performed in space," said Alex Pacheco,
chairman of People for Ethical Treatment of
Animals.
But Joseph Cremin, the Spacelab 3 mission
manager, said the animals are being treated
humanely.
"We do not cause the animals any undue
pain," he said. "I don't think from our activities
there are any reasons to think they aren't being
treated in the best possible fashion. . . . They are
there, basically, for the ride."
The animals' cages are being tested for future
missions in which animal experiments will be per
formed. On this flight, the animals will be studied
for symptoms of space sickness. The rats will be
killed after landing and autopsies performed.
Contractor bills probed
WASHINGTON — A team of auditors has
uncovered $109.7 million in "absolutely inex
cusable" claims against the Pentagon by seven
giant defense contractors, the House Armed
Services Committee said yesterday.
The questioned bills range from the costs of
free haircuts for senior company executives of
one company to $62,021 for a public relations
campaign by another firm to counteract negative

publicity caused by the crash of an airplane it had
built.
The auditors examined $3.6 billion in claims
for overhead expenses by the seven corporations
and concluded, according to Rep. Bill Nichols
(D-Ala.), "that up to $1 for every $33 submitted
to the government for overhead expenses is ques
tionable."
Union for controllers?
NEW YORK — The Air Line Pilots Associa
tion, which refused to honor picket lines after air
traffic controllers struck illegally in 1981, is
trying to organize controllers into an affiliated
union, according to a published report.
The plan to start a membership drive among
14,000 employees in the nation's rebuilt control
ler force will be submitted to the executive coun
cil of the pilots' union in mid-May, the New York
Times reported in today's editions.
Henry Duffy, the union president, said the
union plan wouldn't be considered "if we were
not convinced that we can organize the control
lers and did not believe the council would ap
prove."
If successful, the drive could create a strong
enough labor group to confront the Federal
Aviation Administration, which operates the
nationwide air traffic control system, the Times
said.
$50 million stolen
NEW YORK — Four armed men got away
with almost $50 million in a Wells Fargo truck
early today after overpowering four employees of
the company at the garage where the trucks are
stored, police said.
The four thieves, armed with handguns, stole
the truck from the company's garage in down
town Manhattan at 1:45 a.m., said police spokes
man Sgt. Ed LeSchack.
Wells Fargo, which transports monev for

clients, stores cash in the trucks over the
weekend until the banks open on Monday, he
said.
No one was injured during the robbery, Le-
Schack said, adding the incident was still under
investigation.
Reagan 'anguished'
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, pre
paring for the first European trip of his second
administration, is said by his top aide to be
deeply troubled by the controversy caused by his
planned visit to a German military cemetery.
"Anguish. I believe, is a good choice of words
to describe his mental condition," White House
Chief of Staff Donald Regan says, adding that the
president is standing firm about going the
graveyard near Bitburg, West Germany, Sunday
as part of his 10-day trip.
Reagan departs tomorrow evening.
"He is wounded by this internally,"' Regan
said. "In his heart, he will be hurt at what has
been said about him and his insensitivity when
he's a very sensitive person."
Appearing yesterday on CBS-TV's "Face the
Nation," Regan said Reagan is simply "carrying
out his word" to West German Chancellor Hel
mut Kohl to visit the cemetery as a way of
demonstrating reconciliation 40 years after the
end of World War 11.
The cemetery contains the graves of 2,000 sol
diers, including 49 members of the Nazi SS, the
elite corps blamed for the attempted extermina
tion of Jews and other minorities and massacres
of other European civilians and Allied soldiers.
The New York Times said in its editions yes
terday that some of the SS dead buried there
were from the 2nd Waffen SS Panzer Division,
which was held responsible for murdering 920
Soviet Jews in 1941 and the 1944 massacre of
642 civilians in Oradour-Sur-Glane, France.
