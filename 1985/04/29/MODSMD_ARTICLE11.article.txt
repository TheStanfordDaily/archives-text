Bitburg tension mounts
SAN FRANCISCO — The San Francisco
Jewish Community announced an I lth-hour at
tempt to pressure President Reagan to reverse
his decision to visit a West German cemetery
where Hitler's Nazi SS storm troopers are buried.
"It is an issue that will not die," said Rita
Semel, a spokeswoman for the Jewish Commu
nity Relations Council in San Francisco.
Jewish groups were heartened by the U.S. Sen
ate resolution Friday demanding Reagan cancel
his planned May 5 trip to the Bitburg cemetery,
where 47 SS troopers who fell in the Ardennes
Battle of the Bulge are buried. The SS. the Nazi
Schutzstaffel. ran Hitler's death camps.
Semel said thousands of people have signed
petitions circulated by local Jewish groups. She
hoped that a planned new letter-and-telegram
campaign targeted for the White House would
take off.
On Saturday, a steady stream of people visited
San Francisco's Holocaust Memorial near the
Palace of the Legion of Honor. Reporters said

many expressed outrage and impatience over the
Bitburg cemetery visit.
"I think it's just awful and hard to believe,"
said Margot Zellner, who laid bouquets of
flowers at the stark George Segal sculpture. Zel
lner said both her parents died in Auschwitz, one
of the most notorious of the Nazi death camps.
"I don't know what else to do but bring these
flowers," she said. "If I were president and Ger
many insisted (on the visit), I simply wouldn't
go."
News analysts have said Reagan feels a debt to
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is in
a tight political battle over the country's elections
May 12, because Kohl favors deployment of
Pershing 2 and cruise missiles in his country.
More addicted babies
LOS ANGELES — The number of infants
born addicted to drugs because their mothers
took cocaine, PCP. heroin or other narcotics
during pregnancy is increasing, officials say.
"These are really miserable babies," said Dr.

Annabel Teberg of the County-USC Medical
Center. "They are terribly uncomfortable. They
just can t seem to rest. I hey are wriggling all over
the place. They are unable to eat. They really arc
withdrawing from drugs."
Statistics on the number of drug-addicted
births in Los Angeles are difficult to compile be
cause hospitals do not always accurately diagnose
or report addicted babies, said Michael Durfee,
medical coordinator of the county's Child Abuse
Prevention program.
In 1984, a total of 240 drug-addicted babies
were reported to Durfee's office, which collects
voluntarily reported statistics from hospitals.
I his year. 40 cases were reported in January
and 39 m February, Durfee said. By year's end,
an estimated 460 addictcd baby cases will have
been reported, nearly twice last year's rate.
Today's weather
Highs will be in the upper 50s to mid 70s
today, with an early low overcast layer gradually
retreating to the coast by this afternoon.
