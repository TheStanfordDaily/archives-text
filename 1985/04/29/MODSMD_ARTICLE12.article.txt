# Does current activism resemble the past?

"Stanford students, do you care?"
shouted Sarah von der Lippe to a
crowd of 300 at the kick-oft rally for
the recent hunger conference here.
She asked students about hunger.
But maybe her question asked more.
Are students concerned with the
pressing social issues of the day?
Central America, apartheid or the
prospect of nuclear war? And if so, is
it a passive concern or a dynamic ac
tivism?
According to Alice Stauffer, a
spokeswoman at the noon divestment
and anti-apartheid rally held Wed
nesday at White Plaza, students do
care, and their activism is alive and
catching. "We've all been told, from
the Newsweek cover story to the gen
erally accepted 'me' theory, that stu
dents don't care anymore. But look
around you," she exclaimed, motion
ing toward a crowd of 800. "The stu
dent movement is far from dead!"
So far this quarter, Stanford stu
dents have mobilized to rally against
hunger, demonstrate against pornog

raphy, speak out against U.S. policy
in Central America and sit in for
divestment outside University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's office in the
Ouad.
I hey marched through Palo Alto in
a protest against violence toward
women and rallied in celebration of
the 37th anniversary of the founding
of Israel. Petitions have circulated for
divestment of University stock in an
anti-apartheid movement, for pledges
ot resistance against any escalation of
U.S. military involvement in
Nicaragua and for the blocking of any
of Playboy's attempts to find models
at Stanford.
Why the recent wave of activism?
A resurgence from the left in oppo
sition to the Reagan administration's
policies is a commonly cited explana
tion for the activist spirit moving
across campus.
"The more the wraps are off
Reagan," said Political Science Prof.
John Manley, "the higher the level of
public discourse. ... As we allow
Reagan to be Reagan, we can expect

an increasing number ot Americans
to be horrified at that prospect and to
express that."
Carolyn Del Gaudio, a Stanford
senior who worked as assistant direc
tor of the week-long hunger confer
ence, seconded Manley's view. "We
can only stay embedded in the
Reagan illusion for so long — some
thing's got to give," she said.
Along with a heightening watchdog
move on the part of the public toward
Reagan's policies, special interest
groups on campus are drawing an in
creasing number of student support
ers.
The number of students involved
with the Stanford Central American
Action Network (SCAAN) has in
creased this year by "at least 25 per
cent," according to Joanne Scott, a
member of the association's staff.
Student groups that have been de
veloping over time may now have a
basis of support from which they can
assert themselves politically.
"The black student population is
beginning to make its presence felt

. . . and women are also merging as a
specially activist and concerned
force," Manley pointed out.
Hedy McAdams. an active member
of Women at Stanford Law (WSL),
agrees. She was "greatly impressed
with the scale and quality of women"
who joined together to organize the
anti-pornography rally and to coor
dinate the circulation of petitions
against Playboy's endeavors at Stan
ford.
In addition to the merging of
stronger student groups, a combina
tion of camaraderie and rivalry
among university students across the
nation may account, in part, for a
broadening activism.
Stanford, of course, is not alone in
its recent anti-apartheid demonstra
tions. Student struggles are sweeping
the nation, from Boulder to Boston,
Santa Barbara to Amherst.
"We're inspired by our fellow stu
dents at Berkeley and Columbia and
elsewhere," Stauffer exclaimed in her
divestment speech. "Their taking a
stand has sparked us to action and
made us see that we are a nationwide
movement — not an isolated
campus."
According to Robert Price, a UC-
Berkeley professor of political sci
ence, students across the country are
more concerned with social issues
than the public might initially have
thought.
"People have miscalculated the na
ture of current university students in
general," he told the San Franciso
Chronicle. "Students may have been
more apolitical (recently), but they're
still ready for mobilization.
"Students do want to be part of
something larger than their own self
interest."
Along with a feeling of unity
among students, timing itself may be
a contributing factor to the recent up
surge in student activism. As Manley
pointed out, it is spring quarter, after
all.
Manley termed the new activism a
"spring phenomenon." Students
"tend to come out of sleepy winter
quarter" with a more activist orienta
tion, he said.
Activism correlates with the time
of year as well as the saliency of the
issues," he said, adding, "but that's
certainly not to downgrade it at all."
How substantial is this new ac
tivism? Is it part of a spring fever that
will wilt with the heat of summer, or

'Hell, we were anxious about the
future, but we didn't plow that anxiety
into getting the best grades and jobs
possible."

is it part of an emerging social con
science based on reflection and a
long-term ideology?
According to Manley, students in
his classes are more interested in
questions of principle than usual.
"Those forces that hope and rely
on student apathy are on a tough
spring," he said.
Enrollment in Manley's political
scicnce classes has gone up by about
one third. He sees the rise as an indi
cation of an increasing student con

cern over social and political issues.
On the other hand, History Prof.
Clay Carson feels that "the actual
proportion of students who are politi
cally active tends to stay the same
(over time)." What changes, he ex
plained. arc only the individual issues
which can mobilize students into ac

conference was about what she expected — low.
