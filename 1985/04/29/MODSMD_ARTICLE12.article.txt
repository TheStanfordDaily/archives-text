# Does current activism resemble the past?

### CLAIRE MOREL-SEYTOUX 
"Stanford students, do you care?"
shouted Sarah von der Lippe to a
crowd of 300 at the kick-oft rally for
the recent hunger conference here.
She asked students about hunger.
But maybe her question asked more.
Are students concerned with the
pressing social issues of the day?
Central America, apartheid or the
prospect of nuclear war? And if so, is
it a passive concern or a dynamic ac
tivism?
According to Alice Stauffer, a
spokeswoman at the noon divestment
and anti-apartheid rally held Wed
nesday at White Plaza, students do
care, and their activism is alive and
catching. "We've all been told, from
the Newsweek cover story to the gen
erally accepted 'me' theory, that stu
dents don't care anymore. But look
around you," she exclaimed, motion
ing toward a crowd of 800. "The stu
dent movement is far from dead!"
So far this quarter, Stanford stu
dents have mobilized to rally against
hunger, demonstrate against pornog

raphy, speak out against U.S. policy
in Central America and sit in for
divestment outside University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's office in the
Ouad.
I hey marched through Palo Alto in
a protest against violence toward
women and rallied in celebration of
the 37th anniversary of the founding
of Israel. Petitions have circulated for
divestment of University stock in an
anti-apartheid movement, for pledges
ot resistance against any escalation of
U.S. military involvement in
Nicaragua and for the blocking of any
of Playboy's attempts to find models
at Stanford.
Why the recent wave of activism?
A resurgence from the left in oppo
sition to the Reagan administration's
policies is a commonly cited explana
tion for the activist spirit moving
across campus.
"The more the wraps are off
Reagan," said Political Science Prof.
John Manley, "the higher the level of
public discourse. ... As we allow
Reagan to be Reagan, we can expect

an increasing number ot Americans
to be horrified at that prospect and to
express that."
Carolyn Del Gaudio, a Stanford
senior who worked as assistant direc
tor of the week-long hunger confer
ence, seconded Manley's view. "We
can only stay embedded in the
Reagan illusion for so long — some
thing's got to give," she said.
Along with a heightening watchdog
move on the part of the public toward
Reagan's policies, special interest
groups on campus are drawing an in
creasing number of student support
ers.
The number of students involved
with the Stanford Central American
Action Network (SCAAN) has in
creased this year by "at least 25 per
cent," according to Joanne Scott, a
member of the association's staff.
Student groups that have been de
veloping over time may now have a
basis of support from which they can
assert themselves politically.
"The black student population is
beginning to make its presence felt

. . . and women are also merging as a
specially activist and concerned
force," Manley pointed out.
Hedy McAdams. an active member
of Women at Stanford Law (WSL),
agrees. She was "greatly impressed
with the scale and quality of women"
who joined together to organize the
anti-pornography rally and to coor
dinate the circulation of petitions
against Playboy's endeavors at Stan
ford.
In addition to the merging of
stronger student groups, a combina
tion of camaraderie and rivalry
among university students across the
nation may account, in part, for a
broadening activism.
Stanford, of course, is not alone in
its recent anti-apartheid demonstra
tions. Student struggles are sweeping
the nation, from Boulder to Boston,
Santa Barbara to Amherst.
"We're inspired by our fellow stu
dents at Berkeley and Columbia and
elsewhere," Stauffer exclaimed in her
divestment speech. "Their taking a
stand has sparked us to action and
made us see that we are a nationwide
movement — not an isolated
campus."
According to Robert Price, a UC-
Berkeley professor of political sci
ence, students across the country are
more concerned with social issues
than the public might initially have
thought.
"People have miscalculated the na
ture of current university students in
general," he told the San Franciso
Chronicle. "Students may have been
more apolitical (recently), but they're
still ready for mobilization.
"Students do want to be part of
something larger than their own self
interest."
Along with a feeling of unity
among students, timing itself may be
a contributing factor to the recent up
surge in student activism. As Manley
pointed out, it is spring quarter, after
all.
Manley termed the new activism a
"spring phenomenon." Students
"tend to come out of sleepy winter
quarter" with a more activist orienta
tion, he said.
Activism correlates with the time
of year as well as the saliency of the
issues," he said, adding, "but that's
certainly not to downgrade it at all."
How substantial is this new ac
tivism? Is it part of a spring fever that
will wilt with the heat of summer, or

'Hell, we were anxious about the
future, but we didn't plow that anxiety
into getting the best grades and jobs
possible."

is it part of an emerging social con
science based on reflection and a
long-term ideology?
According to Manley, students in
his classes are more interested in
questions of principle than usual.
"Those forces that hope and rely
on student apathy are on a tough
spring," he said.
Enrollment in Manley's political
scicnce classes has gone up by about
one third. He sees the rise as an indi
cation of an increasing student con

cern over social and political issues.
On the other hand, History Prof.
Clay Carson feels that "the actual
proportion of students who are politi
cally active tends to stay the same
(over time)." What changes, he ex
plained. arc only the individual issues
which can mobilize students into ac
tion.

general support and the establish-

conference was about what she expected — low.

ment is taking the wrong side that you
will get that massive support," he
said.
"The majority of Stanford students
have no particular interest in
politics," Carson continued, and"the
majority of students do not have a
radical ideology, though they might
get upset about a particular issue."
How does the current activist mood
on campus compare with the temper
of the '60s?
From the perspective of a '60s ac
tivist, the current student activism
isn't particularly "alive" and
"exploding," but may well be, on the
contrary,"pretty tiny."
John Jacobs, a Knight journalism
fellow currently studying at Stanford
who attended Cal in the '60s, says
that activism of students today has
nowhere near the urgency of the '60s,
at which time there was a "universal
sense that politics was life.
"Every statement you made, to
friends or others, sent out political

messages, in a way totally lacking
today," Jacobs said. "You were con
stantly forced to reevaluate your life
and your immediate actions in the
context of to what degree you were
willing to sacrifice for politial ends."
Jacobs further suggested that, at
present, there is no single issue
presenting students with the need to
* make a fundamental critical analysis
of American society in a way the
Vietnam war and racism did in the
'60s.
In the absence of such a galvanizing
issue, it's "a lot harder to make an all
embracing critique on society."
Students today are far more goal
oriented and anxious in conventional
ways about the future than students
of the late '60s were, he said.
"Hell, we were anxious about the
future, but we didn't plow that anx
iety into getting the best grades and
jobs possible," Jacobs said.
The peer pressure of the late '60s
was also vastly different from that of
today, Jacobs explained.
In light of a piece of political
theater against the Contras in
Nicaragua which disrupted a history
class last week, Jacobs said, "I was

floored to see that students got really
angry that it had happened!
"In he '60s, there were probably
students who felt that way, but they
would be too scared to pipe up. The
peer pressure was in the opposite di
rection."
Jacobs further said that the issues
students confront today, such as the
prospect of nuclear war,, are more
abstract.
Students aren't going to "be riding
in the streets" if an issue "doesn't
really affect them directly."
Jacobs also pointed to a "whole
counter-culture of media" in the '60s
which he said is absent today.
There's no ongoing body of knowl
edge, "no ongoing left wing of any
significance to which an awakening
student coming of age can align him
self," he said.
"I would guess that a student radi
cal of the '80s would have to reinvent
the wheel all over again," he con
cluded.
How do the students of the '80s
feel about activism themselves?
Von der Lippe says activism is at a
low.
"There is an apathy among stu

dents on important social issues.
They're not apathetic about Big Way
Yacht Club," she said wryly.
The turnout for the Hunger Week
conference von der Lippe organized
was "about what I had expected —
which wasn't great," she said.
"That's a shame, as far as I'm con
cerned," she concluded.
In contrast, the organizer of the
Central America rally on April 18,
Paul Baer, felt optimistic about ac
tivism on campus.
Despite a crowd of about 180
people at the rally, Baer felt the
"turnout was decent — fairly good
considering we had organized it the
day before."
The political conscience of students
isn't as widespread as it was in the
'60s, but there have been
"consistently in the last couple of
years, a number of core activists (as
well as) another group of students
who, while not activists, are people
who will come out and participate,"
Baer argued.
Gary Roberts, a law student, thinks
there isn't enough to protest about.
"People protest for two reasons,"
he explained. "Either because they

can get something done or because
they're desperate. I don't see either
of those circumstances playing a large
role, now. People aren't desperate,
and foreign policy decision-making is
too remote to get uptight about."
The prospect of nuclear war is the
largest issue Americans face today,
Roberts continued, but it's an issue
too overwhelming and too long-term
for students to make much more than
an occasional sporadic gesture of con
cern towards.
Gigi Wang, a senior majoring in
mechanical engineering, feels both
ered by some of the activism.
"1 can't stand people who espouse
causes without considering the impli
cations of their actions," she said.
But Juan Orosco, a sophomore
majoring in electrical engineering,
feels excited about the activism on
campus. "It's amazing!" he said, re
ferring to the divestment and anti
apartheid movement on campus.
Peter Henry, a student instructor in
the Computer Science Department,
said he thinks that "an inordinate
number of Stanford students are con
cerned with the academic bottom line
rather than altruism and social re

sponsibility."
"Stanford students have a strong
sense of security, which makes it
harder tor them to relate comfortably
to the poor or underpriviledged, since
the average Stanford student is not
poor and certainly not under
priviledged. There are, of course, ex
ceptions to that generalization," he
concluded.
For those students who do involve
themselves in activism on campus,
what are their reasons?
One student, upon being asked
why he was marching to the sit-in
aimed at divestment, shrugged his
shoulders, grinned, and questioned,
"something to do?"
Another, tossing a sleeping bag
across his shoulders and racing out
doors toward the divestment camp
out answered, "It'd be fun to sleep
overnight in the Quad."
Others, however, involve them
selves because they feel their causes
are "morally unassailable," because
they want to reach beyond "the
empty lives of Itheir] parents," or be
cause their vision of success entails
"not the amount of money you make,
but the issues you fight for."
