## THE 						STANFORD DAILY The 						research question 
### 
As the first Stanford scientist to be offered
financing by the "Star Wars" program. Electrical
Engineering Prof. Joseph Goodman last week
wondered aloud whether any Pentagon contract
he signs would allow him to pursue "free and un
classified" research.
Goodman's question demands an immediate
response: from the Department of Defense,
which administers the Star Wars program, and
from the University's Committee on Research, a
Faculty Senate group that crafts the framework in
which Stanford scientists operate.
Classified research was banished from Stanford
in 1970, and for good reason. The coherent
evolution of science is directly linked to the abil
ity of researchers to communicate their ideas to
each other. When applied to a university context,
freedom of inquiry is an imperative.
The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), as Star
Wars is formally called, has been billed as a basic
research program aimed at developing a non
nuclear, space-based missile defense system.
SDI can and should be viewed from different
perspectives. To Goodman, Pentagon support
may help facilitate the probing of questions
deserving of serious scientific inquiry. To others,
Star Wars is more than a research program: It is

an all-out drive toward a national defense that is
technologically impossible and strategically de
stabilizing.
But for all intents and purposes, SDI is a plan
without a blueprint. Because it seeks to harnass
technology that is still, more often than not,
confined to the drawing board, there is reason to
worry whether SDI research might become more
restricted as it becomes more sensitive.
To avoid future misunderstanding, the Pent
agon needs to assure Goodman and other univer
sity scientists now that their SDI research will
remain unclassified in the years ahead — regard
less of how Star Wars evolves.
The Committee on Research, which will hold
its annual open forum tomorrow, should take the
lead in urging the Pentagon to clarify the dimen
sions of SDI-university research. To that effect,
the committee might draft a letter to the DoD re
questing clarification before Goodman receives
his SDI contract in the coming months.
By determining now what kind of a role, if any,
Stanford can play in Star Wars, researchers here
would be better-equipped to pursue — or forgo
— SDI contracts. The integrity of intellectual in
quiry here demands no less.
