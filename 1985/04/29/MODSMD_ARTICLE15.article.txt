# On the road with Opie
## 
### 
Opie was sitting on the grass in White Plaza and was
beginning to get tired. He was trying to read 200 pages of
a complex novel for his class the next day. He was reading
so fast that he was losing most of the meaning of the book.
"And what is the use of a book," thought Opie, "without
any meaning?"
And so he sat up on the grass and began to wonder what
responsibilities he could blow off, for it was such a sunny
day. He hadn't had long to think when a man passed
briskly by him. Opie thought he heard this man mum
bling, "I'm late, I'm late." And, thinking this a curious
thing on such a sunny day, he rose and followed the man.

The man was in such a rush that Opie nearly had to run
to keep pace with him, but Opie was still able to look
around. He saw that there were many men and women
rushing about in the same way, all of them staring intently
at nothing. "How odd!" thought Opie.
The man turned left by the History Corner of the Ouad,
and by the time Opie had rounded the corner the man had
disappeared. Opie walked several hundred feet and then
entered the building through a glass door. It was dark.
Ahead, Opie saw the man's head disappear down a flight
of stairs. "Oh my!" he thought. "What shall I do?" And,
of course, being the curious fellow that he was, Opie fol
lowed the man.
He began descending the stairs and was soon engulfed
by complete darkness. Nothing sounded. "1 must be en
tering the bowels of academics," Opie reasoned from his
surroundings. Before long he reached the bottom of the
stairs. "Oh dear," he thought, "what am I to do now?"
Well, you know, Opie was a curious boy, so what do you
think he did? He turned around to run back up the stairs.
But they were gone. Poor Opie.
As a consolation, a light appeared in the distance.
"Yippee!" cried Opie as he ran toward the light. As he
approached the light he saw that it was shaped like a
keyhole. "Therefore, there must be a doorknob," he
thought. He opened the door and went inside.
As I'm sure you've guessed by now, Opie stood in a
room full of doors of various sizes. There was also a table
in the room that wasn't there before Opie entered the
room.
"Hello," said a voice.
Opie looked around the entire room and failed to find
the owner of the voice. "Who's there?" he asked.
"A," it said.
Opie was puzzled. "A what?" he asked.

"An A, a letter A. A grade A, to be precise. You can't
see me because I'm behind this door."
"A grade A all by itself," Opie laughed. "You're not
much good by yourself, are you â€” without an exam or a
transcript?"
"Excuse me," said another voice from behind another
door.
"Who's that?" Opie cried.
" 'Tis I who thou hath now mentioned in vain," said the
voice. "Transcript."
"Why," Opie chuckled, "you're nothing more than a
piece of paper. Even when you finally do get grades, you
won't be more than a piece of paper."
"A rather important paper, wouldn't thou not say?"
"Silly thing," said Opie, "a piece of paper by itself isn't
important. It's. . .. Why, I came here to learn and to grow
and...."
"Hah!" came a third voice from behind a third door.
"Idealistic scum. Who are you to come here to pose as a
god in control of us?"
"Why, I'm no god. I'm a boy, but I am in control of my
own life and. ..."
"Hey, boy," said the third voice, "see that key on the
table there?"

'Yes, yes,' said Transcript.
'We've work to do. We must
establish ourselves.'

"Wow!" exclaimed Opie, for the key had not been
there when he first canie in the room. "1 see it."
"Pick it up, boy, and let us out from behind these doors.
We have been waiting for you to come and release us."
"Yes, yes," said Transcript. "We've work to do. We
must establish ourselves."
"Quickly," said A.
Opie, being the good boy that he was, took the key and
opened each of the doors. Out they came. From behind
the third door came one who identified itself as "Job."
They all thanked Opie in their own little way.
Now Opie was rather confused, having been drugged by
his newly found friends.
"Goodness," he giggled. "I was very wrong about you
all. A, you are the best letter by far. And Transcript, you
are not only a piece of paper at all, for you are as impor
tant as 1 am. You are all of me. Then you, Job, you are
even greater than 1 am. I shall live for you. You are all my
friends, but come, we have much to do."
And Opie found his way back to the stairs, which had
re-appeared, and hurried up them. He emerged outside
and quickly walked away. And though he looked straight
ahead, he saw nothing. For Opie Wilson 111 was late.
