## Escalating fears in Nicaragua 
### 
Last February I wrote to the State Department request
ing that our government take action to rescue Gustavo Se
queira, vice dean of the faculty of medical sciences at the
National University of Managua. Sequeira and three
other health workers were kidnapped by anti-Sandinista
guerrillas while they were visiting an island off the
Nicaragua!! coast.
On April 3. I received a letter from John McCarthy, an
assistant secretary of state, saying that a guerrilla group
had claimed responsibility for the abduction in a com
munique of Feb. 2. "We will continue to monitor this mat-

VIEWPOINT

ter closely,' McCarthy wrote, two months after the
kidnapping. "It is the clear policy of the United States to
neither advocate nor condone any attacks on civilians and
we look to all sides in the conflict to abide by applicable
international law."
Who could ever guess from McCarthy's letter that the
Contra guerrillas operating in Nicaragua were organized,
equipped and trained by the CIA, with $55 million in U.S.
funds, and are faithfully carrying out the policies of the
Reagan administration?
During the interval between Sequeira's kidnapping and
the State Department's response to my letter. President
Reagan increased pressure on Congress for continued
U.S. aid to the Contras, calling them "our brothers" and
"the moral equivalent of our Founding Fathers." Early
this month he warned that unless Congress provides $14
million to the Contras this year, "We face the risk that
100 million people from Panama to our open southern
border would come under the control of pro-Soviet
regimes and threaten the United States with violence."
Since Reagan was recently able to convince Congress
that the way to achieve arms reduction is to build more
MX missiles, he may get them to swallow this latest absur
dity as well. If so, we ought to know how our $14 million
will be spent. Such information is easy to come by, since
the Contras have built up a verifiable record over the past
four years.
In addition to destroying fuel supplies, burning crops
and raiding villages, the Contras have severely damaged
more than 30 health centers, a major hospital and several
schools. Eighteen health workers, not counting Sequeira
and his team, have been killed, and 18 others tortured or
raped. The New Yorker magazine of March 25 contained
excerpts from a recent report by the International Human
Rights Law Group, which was based on eyewitness tes
timony so thoroughly verified that it could stand up in a
court of law. The report contained 140 affidavits attesting
to atrocities.
Doroteo Valdivia described what had happened to a
15-year-old, retarded, epileptic boy during a Contra at
tack on a coffee cooperative: "We had left him in the
bomb shelter. When we returned, we saw that they had
cut his throat, then they cut open his stomach and left his
intestines hanging out on the ground like a string." Myrna

Cunningham, a doctor, described a beating and repeated
rape that she and a nurse endured for more than two
hours. Orlando Wayland, a teacher, was tied to an anthill
for several days running and repeatedly beaten. Other
cases cited in the New Yorker are even more horrifying.
Examples of individual brutality only highlight the
greater crime taking place in Nicaragua: the relentless
torture of a small, bankrupt country by a huge and power
ful neighbor bent on imposing its will. Reagan, who likens
former members of Anastasio Somoza's national guard to
Thomas Jefferson and George Washington, is determined
to stamp out any challenge to American control of the
Western hemisphere. Starting with his claim that a
country of 3,000,000 people poses a security threat to the
United States, he has made distortions and lies a basic
part of his effort to crush the Sandinista government.
Reagan originally justified U.S.-backed assaults on
Nicaragua by charging that the Sandinistas were supplying
Salvadoran rebels with arms. When such arms shipments
turned out to be virtually nonexistent, Reagan began ex
tolling the Contras as "freedom fighters" and calling
Nicaragua "a totalitarian jungle." Both claims are
patently false, according to responsible observers.

Reagan has made distor
tions and lies a basic part of
his effort to crush the Sandi
nista government.

Nicaragua under the Sandinistas is not a model
democracy, but the government recently held free elec
tions and human rights monitoring groups give Nicaragua
a relatively favorable rating.
Reagan has now launched a new effort to win Congres
sional approval for more aid to the Contras. He has pro
posed that the $14 million he is asking for them be spent
only on nonmilitary supplies for the next 60 days, during
which time the Nicaraguan government would be given a
chance to accept extensive and detailed changes
demanded by the Contras. The Sandinistas, not surpris
ingly, have condemned the proposal as forcing them to
"negotiate at the point of a gun."
If Congress accepts this scheme and votes for renewed
funding, the Sandinistas won't submit to American pres
sure but will continue the struggle to preserve their
sovereignty and independence. They have distributed
guns to a large part of the population and they will un
doubtedly seek even more military aid from Cuba and the
Soviet Union. The United States, in turn, will be forced to
provide increased aid to the Contras and, as in Vietnam,
will move inexorably into a combat role. If we are to avoid
yet another such tragedy, now is clearly the time to end
our involvement.

On April 3. I received a letter from John McCarthy, an
assistant secretary of state, saying that a guerrilla group
had claimed responsibility for the abduction in a com
munique of Feb. 2. "We will continue to monitor this mat-

VIEWPOINT

ter closely,' McCarthy wrote, two months after the
kidnapping. "It is the clear policy of the United States to
neither advocate nor condone any attacks on civilians and
we look to all sides in the conflict to abide by applicable
international law."
Who could ever guess from McCarthy's letter that the
Contra guerrillas operating in Nicaragua were organized,
equipped and trained by the CIA, with $55 million in U.S.
funds, and are faithfully carrying out the policies of the
Reagan administration?
During the interval between Sequeira's kidnapping and
the State Department's response to my letter. President
Reagan increased pressure on Congress for continued
U.S. aid to the Contras, calling them "our brothers" and
"the moral equivalent of our Founding Fathers." Early
this month he warned that unless Congress provides $14
million to the Contras this year, "We face the risk that
100 million people from Panama to our open southern
border would come under the control of pro-Soviet
regimes and threaten the United States with violence."
Since Reagan was recently able to convince Congress
that the way to achieve arms reduction is to build more
MX missiles, he may get them to swallow this latest absur
dity as well. If so, we ought to know how our $14 million
will be spent. Such information is easy to come by, since
the Contras have built up a verifiable record over the past
four years.
In addition to destroying fuel supplies, burning crops
and raiding villages, the Contras have severely damaged
more than 30 health centers, a major hospital and several
schools. Eighteen health workers, not counting Sequeira
and his team, have been killed, and 18 others tortured or
raped. The New Yorker magazine of March 25 contained
excerpts from a recent report by the International Human
Rights Law Group, which was based on eyewitness tes
timony so thoroughly verified that it could stand up in a
court of law. The report contained 140 affidavits attesting
to atrocities.
Doroteo Valdivia described what had happened to a
15-year-old, retarded, epileptic boy during a Contra at
tack on a coffee cooperative: "We had left him in the
bomb shelter. When we returned, we saw that they had
cut his throat, then they cut open his stomach and left his
intestines hanging out on the ground like a string." Myrna

Cunningham, a doctor, described a beating and repeated
rape that she and a nurse endured for more than two
hours. Orlando Wayland, a teacher, was tied to an anthill
for several days running and repeatedly beaten. Other
cases cited in the New Yorker are even more horrifying.
Examples of individual brutality only highlight the
greater crime taking place in Nicaragua: the relentless
torture of a small, bankrupt country by a huge and power
ful neighbor bent on imposing its will. Reagan, who likens
former members of Anastasio Somoza's national guard to
Thomas Jefferson and George Washington, is determined
to stamp out any challenge to American control of the
Western hemisphere. Starting with his claim that a
country of 3,000,000 people poses a security threat to the
United States, he has made distortions and lies a basic
part of his effort to crush the Sandinista government.
Reagan originally justified U.S.-backed assaults on
Nicaragua by charging that the Sandinistas were supplying
Salvadoran rebels with arms. When such arms shipments
turned out to be virtually nonexistent, Reagan began ex
tolling the Contras as "freedom fighters" and calling
Nicaragua "a totalitarian jungle." Both claims are
patently false, according to responsible observers.

Reagan has made distor
tions and lies a basic part of
his effort to crush the Sandi
nista government.

Nicaragua under the Sandinistas is not a model
democracy, but the government recently held free elec
tions and human rights monitoring groups give Nicaragua
a relatively favorable rating.
Reagan has now launched a new effort to win Congres
sional approval for more aid to the Contras. He has pro
posed that the $14 million he is asking for them be spent
only on nonmilitary supplies for the next 60 days, during
which time the Nicaraguan government would be given a
chance to accept extensive and detailed changes
demanded by the Contras. The Sandinistas, not surpris
ingly, have condemned the proposal as forcing them to
"negotiate at the point of a gun."
If Congress accepts this scheme and votes for renewed
funding, the Sandinistas won't submit to American pres
sure but will continue the struggle to preserve their
sovereignty and independence. They have distributed
guns to a large part of the population and they will un
doubtedly seek even more military aid from Cuba and the
Soviet Union. The United States, in turn, will be forced to
provide increased aid to the Contras and, as in Vietnam,
will move inexorably into a combat role. If we are to avoid
yet another such tragedy, now is clearly the time to end
our involvement.
