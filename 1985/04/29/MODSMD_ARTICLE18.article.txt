Real anti-semitism
Martin Kimel's letter (The Daily,
April 12) is an illustration of two
divergent paths followed by the
history of Jews among the gentiles.
One of them is based on myths
(shibboleths) and aims at separating
various nationalities. Another at
tempts to unite all people and tries
to adhere to hard facts.
Let me reverse the trend followed
by Kimel and remind him — and the
misled readers of The Daily — of
some basic facts. If Poland is singled
out as the country with "a long his
tory of anti-Semitism," why did most
of the world Jewry find refuge in this
very country when almost every
other European country was expell
ing the Jews? Why are 90 percent of
present Jewish communities
anywhere in the world of Polish
origin?
It is pointless to argue with other
allegations of Kimel — like his claim
that the church encouraged anti-
Semitism in Poland! If he wants to
see nuil anti-Semitism he should
study the history of Jews in Western
Europe.

Well, after being called a lunatic
merely for saying that I supported
Ronald Reagan. I suppose I should
not be surprised that a scholar like

Michael Schmitz should decide I am
a racist for supporting Clarence
Pendleton. Schmitz's viewpoint was
not a rational one and should, ac
cordingly. not have merited my or
any other student's attention. But
there were a few points worth
hearing (again) that were left out of
the column entitled "College
Republicans are blatantly racist."
and if Schmitz has evacuated all his
venom, he is welcome to take note.
To punish or reward human beings
because of their skin color or racial
affiliation is racist. Anyone who
favors laws which punish or reward
human beings because of their skin
color or racial affiliation is a sup
porter of racism. All the lawyers in
the world cannot change this funda
mental truth. Bearing this in mind,
any group which seeks special favors
because of its race is lying if it claims
to be anything but racist (not
"humanitarian." "socially just."
"fair," "equitable" or any other
euphemistic description currently
popular).
Pendleton has divorced himself
from "black leadership" for precisely
this reason. And he has produced
legal and historical documentation to
support his position (documentation
that was never questioned after his
speech). Having \sitnessed his
presentation and the raging salute to
passions that followed it. I can say
that no one verbally disagreed with
Pendleton's contention that prefer
ential treatment is racist. The issue

for the audience was whether or not
such treatment, given the current
state of blacks in the United States,
was socially just. It's a clever trick,
this hiding of one's desire for special
treatment under the cloak of social
justice, and it is a shame that so
many well-meaning people have
been deceived by it. But this idea
presupposes that racism is socially
just if it ends social injustice.
One final time. Special treatment
for racial groups is racism. Whether
this fact is evaded in Jesse Jackson's
demagogical outbursts or in Darieck
Scott's eloquent and polished prose,
it is no less true. If Pendleton stands
against the sophisticated, modern
racism, it is because he — to quote
another man of conscience, Martin
Luther — can do no otherwise.
Indeed, if he is not seen as a black
leader, it is probably because he is
too busy being a leader.

STOP panel
Your report of the Stanford Stu
dents Opposed to Pornography
(STOP) panel suggested that a num
ber of speakers — myself
presumably included — "hedged" on
the issue of pornography and its
"function" in society. In fact, much
as I deplore the sexual "philosophy"
of Playboy, your report gave the

impression that my opinions
coincided with those of STOP to a
greater extent than is the case.
My view differs in two respects.
First, to suggest that pornography is
the cause of male violence is
seriously to underestimate the struc
tural dominance of men in the eco
nomic and social order and women's
exclusion from the primary labor
market, and the emphasis on the one
particular phenomenon of "porn"
actually trivializes women's real
oppression.
Second, I do not support the pres
ent censorship campaigns being led
by Andrea Dworkin and Catharine
MacKinnon. Censorship has histori
cally been used against lesbians, gays
and sexual radicals (for example,
birth control advocates) and has
tended to promote a repressive norm
of sexuality, to say nothing of its
wider political dangers. It should be
a cause for concern that the demands
by some feminists for censorship arc
now supported by the New Right.
Your report tends therefore to
reinforce a mistaken view that all
who call themselves feminists place
anti-pornography campaigning at the
center of their philosophy and have a
wholly negative view of men and
male sexuality. In fact, feminism is a
diverse body of thought and includes
a wide range of views on the role of
men, the nature and causes of
women's inequality, etc.

(shibboleths) and aims at separating
various nationalities. Another at
tempts to unite all people and tries
to adhere to hard facts.
Let me reverse the trend followed
by Kimel and remind him — and the
misled readers of The Daily — of
some basic facts. If Poland is singled
out as the country with "a long his
tory of anti-Semitism," why did most
of the world Jewry find refuge in this
very country when almost every
other European country was expell
ing the Jews? Why are 90 percent of
present Jewish communities
anywhere in the world of Polish
origin?
It is pointless to argue with other
allegations of Kimel — like his claim
that the church encouraged anti-
Semitism in Poland! If he wants to
see nuil anti-Semitism he should
study the history of Jews in Western
Europe.

Defending Pendleton
Well, after being called a lunatic
merely for saying that I supported
Ronald Reagan. I suppose I should
not be surprised that a scholar like

Michael Schmitz should decide I am
a racist for supporting Clarence
Pendleton. Schmitz's viewpoint was
not a rational one and should, ac
cordingly. not have merited my or
any other student's attention. But
there were a few points worth
hearing (again) that were left out of
the column entitled "College
Republicans are blatantly racist."
and if Schmitz has evacuated all his
venom, he is welcome to take note.
To punish or reward human beings
because of their skin color or racial
affiliation is racist. Anyone who
favors laws which punish or reward
human beings because of their skin
color or racial affiliation is a sup
porter of racism. All the lawyers in
the world cannot change this funda
mental truth. Bearing this in mind,
any group which seeks special favors
because of its race is lying if it claims
to be anything but racist (not
"humanitarian." "socially just."
"fair," "equitable" or any other
euphemistic description currently
popular).
Pendleton has divorced himself
from "black leadership" for precisely
this reason. And he has produced
legal and historical documentation to
support his position (documentation
that was never questioned after his
speech). Having \sitnessed his
presentation and the raging salute to
passions that followed it. I can say
that no one verbally disagreed with
Pendleton's contention that prefer
ential treatment is racist. The issue

for the audience was whether or not
such treatment, given the current
state of blacks in the United States,
was socially just. It's a clever trick,
this hiding of one's desire for special
treatment under the cloak of social
justice, and it is a shame that so
many well-meaning people have
been deceived by it. But this idea
presupposes that racism is socially
just if it ends social injustice.
One final time. Special treatment
for racial groups is racism. Whether
this fact is evaded in Jesse Jackson's
demagogical outbursts or in Darieck
Scott's eloquent and polished prose,
it is no less true. If Pendleton stands
against the sophisticated, modern
racism, it is because he — to quote
another man of conscience, Martin
Luther — can do no otherwise.
Indeed, if he is not seen as a black
leader, it is probably because he is
too busy being a leader.

STOP panel
Your report of the Stanford Stu
dents Opposed to Pornography
(STOP) panel suggested that a num
ber of speakers — myself
presumably included — "hedged" on
the issue of pornography and its
"function" in society. In fact, much
as I deplore the sexual "philosophy"
of Playboy, your report gave the

impression that my opinions
coincided with those of STOP to a
greater extent than is the case.
My view differs in two respects.
First, to suggest that pornography is
the cause of male violence is
seriously to underestimate the struc
tural dominance of men in the eco
nomic and social order and women's
exclusion from the primary labor
market, and the emphasis on the one
particular phenomenon of "porn"
actually trivializes women's real
oppression.
Second, I do not support the pres
ent censorship campaigns being led
by Andrea Dworkin and Catharine
MacKinnon. Censorship has histori
cally been used against lesbians, gays
and sexual radicals (for example,
birth control advocates) and has
tended to promote a repressive norm
of sexuality, to say nothing of its
wider political dangers. It should be
a cause for concern that the demands
by some feminists for censorship arc
now supported by the New Right.
Your report tends therefore to
reinforce a mistaken view that all
who call themselves feminists place
anti-pornography campaigning at the
center of their philosophy and have a
wholly negative view of men and
male sexuality. In fact, feminism is a
diverse body of thought and includes
a wide range of views on the role of
men, the nature and causes of
women's inequality, etc.
