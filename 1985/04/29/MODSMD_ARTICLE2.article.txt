# Two Frost shows make one live Dead weekend
## 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
The Grateful Dead trucked into
Frost Amphitheatre for two sold-out
shows this weekend, and, despite a
number of arrests, concert promoters
said the concerts went smoothly.
Del Bandy, a spokesman for the
Stanford Police Department, said
that "quite a few arrests" were made
over the two days of the concerts, but
that the exact number would not be
known until today.
Charges for arrests made at the
concerts ranged from being under the
influence of alcohol or drugs to as
sault and battery, according to
Bandy. Numerous arrests were also
made for possession of various drugs.
Bandy said.
Those students who attended this
weekend's concerts, whether it was
their first time or their 50th seeing
the Grateful Dead, generally gave the
concerts favorable reviews.
Junior Steve Muller attended both
Saturday's and yesterday's show. Mul
ler, who has been to eight other

Grateful Dead concerts, said both
shows were "really good" but "really
different from a regular Dead show."
"Half of the crowd isn't usually
Stanford students, and it makes a big
difference," Muller said. "A lot of
people don't know what the experi
ence is supposed to be like" because
they are going for the first time, he
said.
Junior Polly Firestone, who also at
tended both of the weekend concerts,
said the difference in the audience at
the Stanford concerts seemed to be
"a question of how many times
[peopleJ had gone before and why
they were going."
Junior Tom Belin, who attended
his first Dead concert yesterday, also
noted a large number of Stanford stu
dents at the concert. "It seemed like
there were a lot of students, but the
people who got really into it weren't
from Stanford," he said.
Belin said yesterday's Dead con
cert was different from what he ex
pected. "It was more like dancing and
jamming music than bcach-out, lie

in-the-sun music," he said.
Scott Weitzenkamp, a freshman
from Hooper, Neb., also attended his
first Grateful Dead concert on Satur
day.
"I had never heard of the Dead
before, so .1 really didn't know that
much of the music," he said. "The
funnest thing was seeing all the
people and watching these old men
just jam away."
Weitzenkamp said "everybody was
just jamming and dancing and, of
course, there was the ever-present
aroma of freshly ferned marijuana."
Aaron Persky of the Concert Net
work estimated that 1,000 Stanford
students attended Saturday's show,
and that that number rose to 1,300
for yesterday's concert. Tickets for
the two Dead concerts were sold out
two weeks ago, with 9,500 tickets
sold for each concert.
"We're really happy about it;
things went really smoothly," Persky
said. "The University police seemed
to be pleased, and there were no
major security problems."
