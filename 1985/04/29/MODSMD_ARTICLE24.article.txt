# Students help put track meet wheels in motion

### LARRY NADLER DANNY PEARL 
It was the last leg of yesterday's 800-meter run at Stan
ford Stadium, and 16-year-old John Pinter had fallen
some 20 meters behind 33-year-old Ernie Cordoza, the
reigning national champion. But Pinter refused to fold. "1
held back around the last turn and waited for the final
stretch to make my move."
In a thundering finish, Pinter edged out his rival and
mentor. The two cruised to a stop and accepted excited
congratulations from each other and from their fellow
athletes. They wiped their faces with wet towels and
massaged their aching arms.
Yes, arms. The dramatic race was an arm-powered
wheelchair run.
Pinter and Cordoza are cerebral palsy athletes. They
have a disease which attacks the nervous system and can
severly damage motor abilities. But at yesterday's
regional cerebral palsy track and field meet, wheelchairs
and crutches became potent athletic implements. Fifty
Bay Area athletes joined in friendly but fierce competi
tion and a chance to join some 1,500 cerebral palsy ath
letes in the national finals in Michigan this summer.
The event was planned and run by 30 Stanford students
from the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity, which sponsored the
meet in conjunction with the United Cerebral Palsy Asso
ciation (UCPA).
Alpha Delt members say they encountered some
unique planning problems. "We had a really hard time
finding someone that could do wheelchair repairs,' said
event co-director David Ehrlich, who is a member of the
fraternity and the resident assistant of the house. "I must
have made 90 phone calls." He also said finding a doctor
who would agree to be liable for cerebral palsy athletes
was an unexpected difficulty.
Much of the planning time went into working with the
UCPA, arranging for technical services and coordinating
officiating efforts for the 11 field events and 10 track
events. The students raised funds through donations from
the fraternity's alumni association and from private dona
tions.
Jim Bouquin, director of Disabled Student Services at
Stanford, suggested the project to the fraternity last year.
Alpha Delt members Jeff Gelles, Joe Herzog, Leo
Lapuerta and Ehrlich picked up the idea.
Gelles said "Our interest was two-fold. We wanted to
be involved in handicapped services, and we also wanted
to experiment with directing the tremendous amount of
energy in the house into a project directed outside of the
house."
The impetus for the project arose when the University
turned down an Alpha Delt plan to make its house
wheelchair-accessible, because it was too expensive. Bou
quin, who said Stanford is "probably the most accessible
private secondary institution in the world," encouraged
the house to redirect its efforts toward athletics. "It is im
portant to have sporting events for athletes who are often
excluded from other sporting events."
Although a cerebral palsy track and field meet was put

on last year at Foothill College, yesterday's event was the
first Northern California track and field event officially
sanctioned by the UCPA as a qualifying meet for the na
tional finals.
Physical therapy is one reason that sports are important
for cerebral palsy victims. Harry Smith, an adaptive physi
cal education teacher who was on hand yesterday to cheer
on the athletes, said that cerebral palsy victims can im
prove their range of motion and their coordination
through sports.
Randy Blatz, a quadriplegic who was at the meet to
cheer for a similarly handicapped friend of 30 years, says
he has benefited from sports. "I can move more than 1
could two years ago. But it takes patience."
But cerebral palsy sports are important for a bigger rea
son: the challenge and sense of competition they provide.
"A spectator who hadn't seen an event of this sort would
be surprised at the level of competition involved," Bou
quin said.
Cerebral palsy sports are much more competitive than
the Special Olympics. This is partly because of a classifica
tion system where athletes with similar handicaps com
pete against each other and partly because of the opportu
nity to advance to higher levels of competition. "There
are people who spend 20 hours a week training for this,"
Ehrlich said.
"I enjoyed seeing people competing hard and really
getting into their events," said Dave Armstrong, who ar
ranged transportation for the athletes. "I would have
trouble running 800 meters, and to see these guys doing it
in wheelchairs showed me how little handicaps can
mean."
The range of handicaps at Sunday's meet was wide;
Bryan Dickerson, a quadriplegic 12-year-old, competed
as fiercely with his left foot as others who had the use of
their whole bodies. Fellow athletes as well as the all
volunteer staff cheered encouragement as he attempted
the bean-bag toss with his foot.
Alpha Delt member Brian Bauer, who served as an
event timer, said. "I was in track for four years in high
school and I never saw people look so happy just to cross
the finish line."
The athletes gave the student organizers high marks for
the festive atmosphere and smooth execution of the event.
"It seemed a lot better organized than last year," said Lisa
Krough, a Gunn High school senior. Hubert Driver, a
horse-riding teacher who placed second in the wheelchair
slalom, agreed. "They did an excellent job. Everything
was super."
Bouquin and Michael Ramsey-Perez, coordinator of
Student Organization Services, both praised the Alpha
Delts for successfully putting together the event.
Gelles hopes to see the fraternity putting on the
event each year, but also sees it becoming much more of a
campus-wide event next year. "We wanted to set up a
foundation and structure which could continue. This is a
trial run, and it will be much easier for anybody who wants
to pick it up next year."
