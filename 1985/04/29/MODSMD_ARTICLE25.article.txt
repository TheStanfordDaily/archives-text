## Card KOs USC, opens 4½-game lead 
### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
LOS ANGELES — Sometimes a ballclub needs help
from the unexpected sources if it's to win. Yesterday —
and throughout the weekend, for that matter — Stanford
was pleasantly surprised, and USC was shocked, by the
hitting exploits of slick-fielding shortstop John Verducci.
Sure, the mainstays of the lineup were on hand and in
top form, but their production comes when Coach Mark
Marquess fills out the lineup card. In yesterday's series
finale, tor example, Mark Davis was up to par, going 4-
for-6 and collecting five RBIs. Routine, you say.
And in night games Friday and Saturday, Rick
Lundblade was at his best. He smacked round-trippers in
each contest — giving him five in his last six games — and
knocked in six runs. Ho-hum. Another day at the office.
They all contributed mightily to a Cardinal Cakewalk
through Dedeaux Field that saw Stanford sweep the host
Trojans, outscoring USC 43-15 over the three games.
With the series sweep, Stanford upped its overall mark
to 34-10 and its league-leading Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion record to 19-5.
USC fell to 20-38 against all competition and 4-20 in
the Six-Pac.
Meanwhile, California, two games back of Stanford
before the weekend, dropped two to Arizona in Tucson,
9-6 on Friday and 5-2 yesterday. Saturday's contest was
rained out. The Bears now trail the Cardinal by 4'/2
games.
Stanford's magic number, the number of Stanford wins
or California losses needed to clinch the league champion
ship, now stands at three.
The real surprise was the output of Verducci, Stanford's
ninth hitter. In yesterday's 14-5 starching, Verducci
slapped three hits in five at-bats and drove in five runs.
Those RBIs gave him a team-leading eight for the
weekend.
Besides hitting with power — Verducci had two triples
— he was 7-for-12 on the weekend.
"I'm trying to shorten up my swing and swing a little
harder," Verducci said.
Marquess was delighted with his shortstop's success.
"That's what makes us good," Marquess said. "The pro

duction doesn't come from just a couple of guys."
Production came from up and down the Cardinal order
yesterday. Two runs in each of the first two innings
formed an early 4-0 Stanford lead. A two-run homer by
Davis, his 10th on the year, and a two-run single by Ver
ducci roughed up starter and loser Steve Bast. 3-10.
A four-run Trojan uprising in the fourth, powered by
Rodney Peete's two-run, opposite-field homer off starter
Jack McDowell, tied things up.
Verducci. on base after singling, scored the go-ahead
run in the fifth when Ruben Amaro grounded into a
double-play.
Four unearned runs in the top of the sixth built Stan
ford's lead to five, at 9-4. A pair of walks and an error
loaded the bases for the meat of the Stanford lineup.
Amaro drove in two when he singled off the third
baseman's glove. Davis followed with a single to right
center. Things turned into a circus when the ball eluded
the center fielder and rolled to the wall, allowing Amaro
to score all the way from first.
After USC managed a run in the bottom of the sixth,
Stanford lit more fireworks in the seventh. Verducci
tripled in Mike Deßenon, who had doubled, and Toi
Cook, who had walked. Pete Stanicek, 3-for-4 on the day,
singled in Verducci to make it 12-5.
Mark Machtolf, in for Amaro at third, doubled, moving
Stanicek to third. Davis rounded out the scoring when he
lashed a two-run single to center.
Despite some middle-inning trouble, Stanford's
McDowell lasted until the end for his eighth win of the
year.
"He did a good job," Marquess said of his freshman
pitcher's effort. "But we didn't give him support in the
field." The Cardinal committed two errors behind
McDowell, one leading to an unearned run.
In Friday night's series opener, things got started early
for the Cardinal, and ended just as quickly for the
Trojans. Stanford man-handled three USC pitchers in a
40-minute, 11-run first inning.

fornia by 4»/ 2 games.
lard finished Trojan starter Brad Brink. But the Cardinal
bats didn't stop after chasing Brink.
USC's reliever, Mike Seiber, came in and threw some
game-time batting practice.
A walk to Harris, doubles by Cook and Ramos, and a
triple by Verducci drove the beleaguered Sieber from the
mound. By then the score was 7-0 — and the Trojans
hadn't even batted.
The fun continued with Dedeaux's next offering, John
Johnson, who coughed up two more walks and Rick
Lundblade's three-run homer before mercifully getting
out of the inning. When the half-inning was over, the
Cardinal had sent 15 men to the plate and most of the
USC rooters home.
Just for good measure, the Cardinal rallied tor three in
the top of the third on run-scoring doubles by Lundblade
and Deßenon, and one each in the fourth and the fifth.
While Stanford's hitters wouldn't quit, USC's never got
out of the box. Starter Ballard limited the Trojans to one
hit and one run through the first five innings.
Ballard stayed in just long enough to get the win, his
ninth against two losses. Marquess, trying to rest his ace,
called on Ugo Colella to pitch the final four frames.
"I was locating my fastball really well," Ballard said.
"That's what I was getting most of my outs on."
Friday's scheduled events may have lacked riveting
excitement, but the impromptu ones surely caught the
fans' attention. An incident late in the game demonstrated
the frustration that USC, down 16-1 and about to lose its
15th league game in a row, must have felt.
Johnson's 1-2 pitch to Stanford's Ken Green was up
and in and sent the hitter to the dirt. Green, suspecting
head-hunting, gazed at Johnson and expressed his dis
pleasure.
With Green eyeing the pitcher, Trojan catcher John
Appleton tackled the felled batsman from behind. With
that both benches cleared, and a melee, baseball style,
ensued.
"1 know he (Johnson) was throwing at Ken Green,"
Marquess said. "He had no reason to throw at the guy.
"I don't want my players hurt because of their frustra
tion. Those things just shouldn't happen." Marquess sug

gested that USC dealt low blows amid the scuffle, noting
that some of his players have spike marks on their heads.
Saturday's middle game didn't feature a rhubarb, but
there was more of the same Cardinal explosiveness.
Stanicek started the game with a double off the right-field
wall. Stanford's second baseman stole third and scored on
Amaro's bouncer up the middle.
In the bottom of the first, USC's offensive pulse, non
existent in Game 1, perked up. Three singles, a triple and
a walk amounted to four runs and drove starter Rob Was
senaar to the bench.
Marquess paged freshman Lee Plemel, who came in
and quickly administered a sedative to the enlivened
Trojans. Plemel lasted all the way to the ninth, plenty long
for the Stanford bats to send USC to its grave.
Plemel, who raised his record to 4-0, "did a great job,"
Marquess said. "He gave us eight good innings and kept
us close."
While Plemel stymied USC, Stanford hitters found their
range. A single run in the fourth, coming on Lundblade's
17th homer of the year, and another in the fifth narrowed
the Trojan lead to 4-3.
In the top of the sixth, after USC made it 5-3, Trojan
starter and loser Randy Johnson, 4-8, lost the strike zone.
In the inning Stanford batted — or rather looked —
around. The first five Cardinal batsmen walked, forcing in
two runs. Verducci's subsequent two-run ground single
over second base and Stanicek's sacrifice fly posted Stan
ford to an 8-5 lead.
Five more runs in the eighth — all unearned — staked
Stanford to a seemingly insurmountable 13-5 advantage.
But things got exciting again — "too exciting" accord
ing to Marquess— when USC came alive just in time for
the bottom of the ninth.
Four walks and three singles off a tired Plemel and his
relievers, Rick Dietz and Kevin Kunkel, produced four
runs and left the bases full of Trojans with two outs. With
the score .at 13-9, Stanford, USC could tie it up with a
round-tripper.
And Kunkel had to be Marquess' man — no one was up
in Stanford's bullpen. The count on pinch-hitter Sean
Wetherby, who leads USC with seven homers, moved full.
The next pitch, a slider down and away, found the plate
for a called strike three. With the bat still on Wetherby's
shoulder, Stanford took Game 2, and, with a gasp,
escaped Dedeaux Field.

Jack McDowell, tied things up.
Verducci. on base after singling, scored the go-ahead
run in the fifth when Ruben Amaro grounded into a
double-play.
Four unearned runs in the top of the sixth built Stan
ford's lead to five, at 9-4. A pair of walks and an error
loaded the bases for the meat of the Stanford lineup.
Amaro drove in two when he singled off the third
baseman's glove. Davis followed with a single to right
center. Things turned into a circus when the ball eluded
the center fielder and rolled to the wall, allowing Amaro
to score all the way from first.
After USC managed a run in the bottom of the sixth,
Stanford lit more fireworks in the seventh. Verducci
tripled in Mike Deßenon, who had doubled, and Toi
Cook, who had walked. Pete Stanicek, 3-for-4 on the day,
singled in Verducci to make it 12-5.
Mark Machtolf, in for Amaro at third, doubled, moving
Stanicek to third. Davis rounded out the scoring when he
lashed a two-run single to center.
Despite some middle-inning trouble, Stanford's
McDowell lasted until the end for his eighth win of the
year.
"He did a good job," Marquess said of his freshman
pitcher's effort. "But we didn't give him support in the
field." The Cardinal committed two errors behind
McDowell, one leading to an unearned run.
In Friday night's series opener, things got started early
for the Cardinal, and ended just as quickly for the
Trojans. Stanford man-handled three USC pitchers in a
40-minute, 11-run first inning.

lard finished Trojan starter Brad Brink. But the Cardinal
bats didn't stop after chasing Brink.
USC's reliever, Mike Seiber, came in and threw some
game-time batting practice.
A walk to Harris, doubles by Cook and Ramos, and a
triple by Verducci drove the beleaguered Sieber from the
mound. By then the score was 7-0 — and the Trojans
hadn't even batted.
The fun continued with Dedeaux's next offering, John
Johnson, who coughed up two more walks and Rick
Lundblade's three-run homer before mercifully getting
out of the inning. When the half-inning was over, the
Cardinal had sent 15 men to the plate and most of the
USC rooters home.
Just for good measure, the Cardinal rallied tor three in
the top of the third on run-scoring doubles by Lundblade
and Deßenon, and one each in the fourth and the fifth.
While Stanford's hitters wouldn't quit, USC's never got
out of the box. Starter Ballard limited the Trojans to one
hit and one run through the first five innings.
Ballard stayed in just long enough to get the win, his
ninth against two losses. Marquess, trying to rest his ace,
called on Ugo Colella to pitch the final four frames.
"I was locating my fastball really well," Ballard said.
"That's what I was getting most of my outs on."
Friday's scheduled events may have lacked riveting
excitement, but the impromptu ones surely caught the
fans' attention. An incident late in the game demonstrated
the frustration that USC, down 16-1 and about to lose its
15th league game in a row, must have felt.
Johnson's 1-2 pitch to Stanford's Ken Green was up
and in and sent the hitter to the dirt. Green, suspecting
head-hunting, gazed at Johnson and expressed his dis
pleasure.
With Green eyeing the pitcher, Trojan catcher John
Appleton tackled the felled batsman from behind. With
that both benches cleared, and a melee, baseball style,
ensued.
"1 know he (Johnson) was throwing at Ken Green,"
Marquess said. "He had no reason to throw at the guy.
"I don't want my players hurt because of their frustra
tion. Those things just shouldn't happen." Marquess sug

gested that USC dealt low blows amid the scuffle, noting
that some of his players have spike marks on their heads.
Saturday's middle game didn't feature a rhubarb, but
there was more of the same Cardinal explosiveness.
Stanicek started the game with a double off the right-field
wall. Stanford's second baseman stole third and scored on
Amaro's bouncer up the middle.
In the bottom of the first, USC's offensive pulse, non
existent in Game 1, perked up. Three singles, a triple and
a walk amounted to four runs and drove starter Rob Was
senaar to the bench.
Marquess paged freshman Lee Plemel, who came in
and quickly administered a sedative to the enlivened
Trojans. Plemel lasted all the way to the ninth, plenty long
for the Stanford bats to send USC to its grave.
Plemel, who raised his record to 4-0, "did a great job,"
Marquess said. "He gave us eight good innings and kept
us close."
While Plemel stymied USC, Stanford hitters found their
range. A single run in the fourth, coming on Lundblade's
17th homer of the year, and another in the fifth narrowed
the Trojan lead to 4-3.
In the top of the sixth, after USC made it 5-3, Trojan
starter and loser Randy Johnson, 4-8, lost the strike zone.
In the inning Stanford batted — or rather looked —
around. The first five Cardinal batsmen walked, forcing in
two runs. Verducci's subsequent two-run ground single
over second base and Stanicek's sacrifice fly posted Stan
ford to an 8-5 lead.
Five more runs in the eighth — all unearned — staked
Stanford to a seemingly insurmountable 13-5 advantage.
But things got exciting again — "too exciting" accord
ing to Marquess— when USC came alive just in time for
the bottom of the ninth.
Four walks and three singles off a tired Plemel and his
relievers, Rick Dietz and Kevin Kunkel, produced four
runs and left the bases full of Trojans with two outs. With
the score .at 13-9, Stanford, USC could tie it up with a
round-tripper.
And Kunkel had to be Marquess' man — no one was up
in Stanford's bullpen. The count on pinch-hitter Sean
Wetherby, who leads USC with seven homers, moved full.
The next pitch, a slider down and away, found the plate
for a called strike three. With the bat still on Wetherby's
shoulder, Stanford took Game 2, and, with a gasp,
escaped Dedeaux Field.

USC Coach Rod Dedeaux and a team trainer were concerned with the pain Stanford inflicted on the Trojans
this weekend, both on the scoreboard and in a basebrawl in the eighth inning of Friday's game.
LOS ANGELES — Sometimes a ballclub needs help
from the unexpected sources if it's to win. Yesterday —
and throughout the weekend, for that matter — Stanford
was pleasantly surprised, and USC was shocked, by the
hitting exploits of slick-fielding shortstop John Verducci.
Sure, the mainstays of the lineup were on hand and in
top form, but their production comes when Coach Mark
Marquess fills out the lineup card. In yesterday's series
finale, tor example, Mark Davis was up to par, going 4-
for-6 and collecting five RBIs. Routine, you say.
And in night games Friday and Saturday, Rick
Lundblade was at his best. He smacked round-trippers in
each contest — giving him five in his last six games — and
knocked in six runs. Ho-hum. Another day at the office.
They all contributed mightily to a Cardinal Cakewalk
through Dedeaux Field that saw Stanford sweep the host
Trojans, outscoring USC 43-15 over the three games.
With the series sweep, Stanford upped its overall mark
to 34-10 and its league-leading Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion record to 19-5.
USC fell to 20-38 against all competition and 4-20 in
the Six-Pac.
Meanwhile, California, two games back of Stanford
before the weekend, dropped two to Arizona in Tucson,
9-6 on Friday and 5-2 yesterday. Saturday's contest was
rained out. The Bears now trail the Cardinal by 4'/2
games.
Stanford's magic number, the number of Stanford wins
or California losses needed to clinch the league champion
ship, now stands at three.
The real surprise was the output of Verducci, Stanford's
ninth hitter. In yesterday's 14-5 starching, Verducci
slapped three hits in five at-bats and drove in five runs.
Those RBIs gave him a team-leading eight for the
weekend.
Besides hitting with power — Verducci had two triples
— he was 7-for-12 on the weekend.
"I'm trying to shorten up my swing and swing a little
harder," Verducci said.
Marquess was delighted with his shortstop's success.
"That's what makes us good," Marquess said. "The pro

duction doesn't come from just a couple of guys."
Production came from up and down the Cardinal order
yesterday. Two runs in each of the first two innings
formed an early 4-0 Stanford lead. A two-run homer by
Davis, his 10th on the year, and a two-run single by Ver
ducci roughed up starter and loser Steve Bast. 3-10.
A four-run Trojan uprising in the fourth, powered by
Rodney Peete's two-run, opposite-field homer off starter
Jack McDowell, tied things up.
Verducci. on base after singling, scored the go-ahead

USC rooters home.
Just for good measure, the Cardinal rallied tor three in
the top of the third on run-scoring doubles by Lundblade
and Deßenon, and one each in the fourth and the fifth.
While Stanford's hitters wouldn't quit, USC's never got
out of the box. Starter Ballard limited the Trojans to one
hit and one run through the first five innings.
Ballard stayed in just long enough to get the win, his
ninth against two losses. Marquess, trying to rest his ace,
called on Ugo Colella to pitch the final four frames.
"I was locating my fastball really well," Ballard said.
"That's what I was getting most of my outs on."
Friday's scheduled events may have lacked riveting
excitement, but the impromptu ones surely caught the
fans' attention. An incident late in the game demonstrated
the frustration that USC, down 16-1 and about to lose its
15th league game in a row, must have felt.
Johnson's 1-2 pitch to Stanford's Ken Green was up
and in and sent the hitter to the dirt. Green, suspecting
head-hunting, gazed at Johnson and expressed his dis
pleasure.
With Green eyeing the pitcher, Trojan catcher John
Appleton tackled the felled batsman from behind. With
that both benches cleared, and a melee, baseball style,
ensued.
"1 know he (Johnson) was throwing at Ken Green,"
Marquess said. "He had no reason to throw at the guy.
"I don't want my players hurt because of their frustra
tion. Those things just shouldn't happen." Marquess sug

gested that USC dealt low blows amid the scuffle, noting
that some of his players have spike marks on their heads.
Saturday's middle game didn't feature a rhubarb, but
there was more of the same Cardinal explosiveness.
Stanicek started the game with a double off the right-field
wall. Stanford's second baseman stole third and scored on
Amaro's bouncer up the middle.
In the bottom of the first, USC's offensive pulse, non
existent in Game 1, perked up. Three singles, a triple and
a walk amounted to four runs and drove starter Rob Was
senaar to the bench.
Marquess paged freshman Lee Plemel, who came in
and quickly administered a sedative to the enlivened
Trojans. Plemel lasted all the way to the ninth, plenty long
for the Stanford bats to send USC to its grave.
Plemel, who raised his record to 4-0, "did a great job,"
Marquess said. "He gave us eight good innings and kept
us close."
While Plemel stymied USC, Stanford hitters found their
range. A single run in the fourth, coming on Lundblade's
17th homer of the year, and another in the fifth narrowed
the Trojan lead to 4-3.
In the top of the sixth, after USC made it 5-3, Trojan
starter and loser Randy Johnson, 4-8, lost the strike zone.
In the inning Stanford batted — or rather looked —
around. The first five Cardinal batsmen walked, forcing in
two runs. Verducci's subsequent two-run ground single
over second base and Stanicek's sacrifice fly posted Stan
ford to an 8-5 lead.
Five more runs in the eighth — all unearned — staked
Stanford to a seemingly insurmountable 13-5 advantage.
But things got exciting again — "too exciting" accord
ing to Marquess— when USC came alive just in time for
the bottom of the ninth.
Four walks and three singles off a tired Plemel and his
relievers, Rick Dietz and Kevin Kunkel, produced four
runs and left the bases full of Trojans with two outs. With
the score .at 13-9, Stanford, USC could tie it up with a
round-tripper.
And Kunkel had to be Marquess' man — no one was up
in Stanford's bullpen. The count on pinch-hitter Sean
Wetherby, who leads USC with seven homers, moved full.
The next pitch, a slider down and away, found the plate
for a called strike three. With the bat still on Wetherby's
shoulder, Stanford took Game 2, and, with a gasp,
escaped Dedeaux Field.

USC Coach Rod Dedeaux and a team trainer were concerned with the pain Stanford inflicted on the Trojans
this weekend, both on the scoreboard and in a basebrawl in the eighth inning of Friday's game.
