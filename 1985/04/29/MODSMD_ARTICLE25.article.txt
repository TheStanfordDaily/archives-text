## Card KOs USC, opens 4½-game lead 
### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
LOS ANGELES — Sometimes a ballclub needs help
from the unexpected sources if it's to win. Yesterday —
and throughout the weekend, for that matter — Stanford
was pleasantly surprised, and USC was shocked, by the
hitting exploits of slick-fielding shortstop John Verducci.
Sure, the mainstays of the lineup were on hand and in
top form, but their production comes when Coach Mark
Marquess fills out the lineup card. In yesterday's series
finale, tor example, Mark Davis was up to par, going 4-
for-6 and collecting five RBIs. Routine, you say.
And in night games Friday and Saturday, Rick
Lundblade was at his best. He smacked round-trippers in
each contest — giving him five in his last six games — and
knocked in six runs. Ho-hum. Another day at the office.
They all contributed mightily to a Cardinal Cakewalk
through Dedeaux Field that saw Stanford sweep the host
Trojans, outscoring USC 43-15 over the three games.
With the series sweep, Stanford upped its overall mark
to 34-10 and its league-leading Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion record to 19-5.
USC fell to 20-38 against all competition and 4-20 in
the Six-Pac.
Meanwhile, California, two games back of Stanford
before the weekend, dropped two to Arizona in Tucson,
9-6 on Friday and 5-2 yesterday. Saturday's contest was
rained out. The Bears now trail the Cardinal by 4'/2
games.
Stanford's magic number, the number of Stanford wins
or California losses needed to clinch the league champion
ship, now stands at three.
The real surprise was the output of Verducci, Stanford's
ninth hitter. In yesterday's 14-5 starching, Verducci
slapped three hits in five at-bats and drove in five runs.
Those RBIs gave him a team-leading eight for the
weekend.
Besides hitting with power — Verducci had two triples
— he was 7-for-12 on the weekend.
"I'm trying to shorten up my swing and swing a little
harder," Verducci said.
Marquess was delighted with his shortstop's success.
"That's what makes us good," Marquess said. "The pro

duction doesn't come from just a couple of guys."
Production came from up and down the Cardinal order
yesterday. Two runs in each of the first two innings
formed an early 4-0 Stanford lead. A two-run homer by
Davis, his 10th on the year, and a two-run single by Ver
ducci roughed up starter and loser Steve Bast. 3-10.
A four-run Trojan uprising in the fourth, powered by
Rodney Peete's two-run, opposite-field homer off starter
Jack McDowell, tied things up.
Verducci. on base after singling, scored the go-ahead
run in the fifth when Ruben Amaro grounded into a
double-play.
Four unearned runs in the top of the sixth built Stan
ford's lead to five, at 9-4. A pair of walks and an error
loaded the bases for the meat of the Stanford lineup.
Amaro drove in two when he singled off the third
baseman's glove. Davis followed with a single to right
center. Things turned into a circus when the ball eluded
the center fielder and rolled to the wall, allowing Amaro
to score all the way from first.
After USC managed a run in the bottom of the sixth,
Stanford lit more fireworks in the seventh. Verducci
tripled in Mike Deßenon, who had doubled, and Toi
Cook, who had walked. Pete Stanicek, 3-for-4 on the day,
singled in Verducci to make it 12-5.
Mark Machtolf, in for Amaro at third, doubled, moving
Stanicek to third. Davis rounded out the scoring when he
lashed a two-run single to center.
Despite some middle-inning trouble, Stanford's
McDowell lasted until the end for his eighth win of the
year.
"He did a good job," Marquess said of his freshman
pitcher's effort. "But we didn't give him support in the
field." The Cardinal committed two errors behind
McDowell, one leading to an unearned run.
In Friday night's series opener, things got started early
for the Cardinal, and ended just as quickly for the
Trojans. Stanford man-handled three USC pitchers in a
40-minute, 11-run first inning.

The Stanford baseball team blew away USC over the weekend, sweeping a three game series with the
Trojans. The victories left the Cardinal sitting pretty in the Six-Pac catbird seat, leading second-place Cali
fornia by 4»/ 2 games.
