# McCarthy fourth individually for women golfers
## Stanford third at WCAAs 
### KEN STEVENS Staff sportswriter 
Prior to this weekend's Western
Collegiate Athletic Association
championships in Phoenix, Ariz.,
Stanford Women's Golf Coach Tim
Baldwin labeled Arizona State and
UCLA as the two favorites to capture
the championship, despite his team's
new No. 5 national ranking.
Baldwin claimed that the talent
laden Sun Devils — Daniele Ammac
capane, Heather Farr and Tina
Tombs are among the top 10 women
amateurs in the world — and Bruins
Kay Cockcrill, Sophie LaPaire and
Krystal Parker are all strong All-
America candidates — would be dif
ficult for the Cardinal women to
overcome.
As everything turned out,
Baldwin's predictions could not have
been better. ASU, this year's host
school, made shambles of the 6,200-
yard Anasa/i Golf Course, shooting a
blazing 899 for the 54-hole tourna
ment to win the team title.
The Sun Devils finished I 1 shots
ahead of second-place UCLA (910).
Hie Cardinal women finished in third
place at 932, a distant 33 shots off of
ASU's pace.
Only a week ago, the Stanford
women defeated the same ASU and
UCLA teams in Phoenix on the same
golf course at the Lady Sun Devil
while firing a three-round 902.
USC took fourth place at the
WCAA championships with a 938
three-day total, followed by Arizona
(953). San Diego State (978) and
Long Beach State (1.001).
Despite the Cardinal's overwhelm
ing loss to both ASU and UCLA.
Baldwin is not overly concerned. He
said that the team was simply flat
during Friday's first round and Satur
day's second round but came on to
play well yesterday, shooting 303 for
the final round.
Cardinal sophomore Kathleen
McCarthy also remained optimistic,
indicating that the condition of the

course was not up to par because of
bad weather. "The course was
playing so much differently than last
week," McCarthy said. "The first two
days were really windy."
Baldwin is still confident about his
team's position heading into the
NCAA championships May 22-25 at
Cape Cod. Mass. He said that this
weekend's performance should not
frustrate the Cardinal women, but
rather give them added incentive to
do well at the Nationals.
McCarthy said that the team is
really looking forward to nationals.
"We're all really excited." she said.
The individual competition at the
WCAA championships was also
dominated by ASU and UCLA gol
fers. Parker fired an even-par 216 for
the tournament to capture the
WCAA individual title. She
finished two shots ahead of Ammac
capane (218), who captured second
place. Farr took third place with a
three-round total of 223.
McCarthy finished strongly with a
final-round 73 yesterday to capture
fourth place. McCarthy — a first
team All-American as a freshman last
season, when she won five tourna
ments. compiled the third lowest
scoring average in the nation, and
finished fifth in the NCAA cham
pionships— is vying to repeat as All-
American this season and is currently
ranked No. 7 in the nation.
Rounding out the leader board
were Cockerill and USCs Kim Saiki
at 229 and Tombs at 230.
Parker, Ammaccapane, Farr,
McCarthy and Cockerill were named
to this year's WCAA All-Conference
team following the tournament. The
All-Conference team is based on the
results of the WCAA championships,
with the top five finishers receiving
the honors. Cockerill was chosen over
Saiki due to her overall play this
season.
Other Stanford scores included
junior Kath\ Kostas at 236. freshman
Kay Cornelius at 237. freshman

Anna Oxenstierna at 239 and fresh
man Trish McGonigle at 240.
The Cardinal women will not play
as a team again until the NCAA
championships in three weeks. Next
Monday they will get a break from
serious competition when they play in

the Cardinal Club Celebrity Tourna
ment at the Stanford Golf Course.
Tht following weekend. McCarthy
will defend her championship in the
Blossom Festival at Los Gatos. a 54-
hole amateur tournament played at
the La Rinconada Golf Course.
