## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's golf team
started slowly in the first round of
the Sun Devil Invitational
Thursday and never caught fire,
finishing 11th out of a strong 15-
team field at the three-day tourna
ment in Scottsdale. Ariz.
The Cardinal men found them
selves in 10th place after the
opening round. IS shots back of
the leader at 354. They never
recovered from their first-day
woes, finishing at 1.132 for the
three rounds.
Fresno State captured the team
championship, narrowly defeating
UCLA, San Diego State and Brig
ham Young. The Bulldogs fired
1,106, one shot better than both
UCLA and SDSU. BYU finished
three shots off of the pace at
1.109. Arizona State, the host
team, finished back of the pack in
fifth place at 1,1 IS.
Despite his team's fifth place
finish. Stanford Coach Tim Schaaf
was not too disappointed. "It's a
really strong field," Schaaf said.
"All 15 teams are really strong, so
if you play poorly it really shows
up. (But) we didn't play that
poorly."
Finishing 11 th, Stanford was not
able to defeat the three teams that
it was aiming to knock off — San
Jose State, Arizona and USC.
Arizona finished in seventh
place at 1,124, USC in a tie for
eighth at 1,127 and San Jose in
10th at 1,128.
The victory for the Spartans
gives them the edge over the
Cardinal for the season series.
SJSU finished one-up in head-to
head competition against the
Cardinal men this season.
B\ edging Stanford this
weekend, both Arizona and USC
moved within a match of the Card
inal in the season series with one

tournament remaining in the regu
lar season.
In individual play at Scottsdale,
SDSU's Howie Johnson fired a 7-
under-par 209 to capture the
championship trophy. Kevin
Leach of UCLA finished in second
place at 214. while ASU's Rich
Diet/ and SDSU's Dennis Paulson
tied for third at 2 16.
The Cardinal's top golfer this
weekend was senior Tim Robin
son. who shot 224 for the three
rounds. Other Stanford scores in
cluded freshman John Dickey at
225, senior Scott Erickson at 226.
senior Doug Thompson at 225.
junior Carl Wagner at 235 and
sophomore Rich Marik at 239.
The Cardinal men will have to
put this tournament behind them
quickly as they open play today in
the Pacific 10 Conference cham
pionships in Pullman. Wash. They
will play 36 holes in today's
opening round and will conclude
the tournament playing IS holes
both tomorrow and Wednesday.
Schaaf said the Pac-lOs arc very
prestigious, with the winning team
receiving an automatic berth in the
nationals next month.
He did not, however, want to
downplay the importance of the
Sun Devil Invitational. "The Pac
10s are more important (than the
Sun Devil) in the sense that it's the
conference championship, but the
Sun Devil is also extremely impor
tant," Schaafsaid.
At the Pac-lOs. the Cardinal
will be looking once again to
defeat Arizona and USC to secure
the season series against both
schools.
The Cardinal men will held the
same team at the Pac-lOs that
played this weekend. Robinson
will be looking to challenge
several of the nation's top golfers
in an attempt to strengthen his
All-American credentials.
