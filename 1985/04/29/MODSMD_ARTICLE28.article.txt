wind-aided 9.90 run in the 100 meters, the third fastest
time ever recorded. Stoll of Stanford, taking quite a few
more strides, claimed his first place too. w inning the men's
3,000 steeplechase in a time of 8:56.2. Cardinal teammate

1 Ith and 1 2th. both setting personal bests for the season.

old mark b\ over 10 feet. Pickett added an additional six
feet to his previous best with his throw of 2 14 feet.

the hammer, came into the meet hoping to break his
season's top throw of 223-6. Things did not turn out as
planned, however, as Pickering threw for a disappointing
2 10 feet, good for 10th-place.
