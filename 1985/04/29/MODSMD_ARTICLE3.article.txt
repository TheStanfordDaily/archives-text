# Zschau raps apartheid
## Congressman speaks in Annenberg Auditorium 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
Republican Congressman Ed Zschau said yesterday
that "passive tolerance" of South Africa's apartheid sys
tem will not bring an end to the growing racial tensions in
that country.
Speaking to more than 100 constituents at a meeting in
Annenberg Auditorium, the 12th District congressman
said there is "a broad feeling across the board (in
Congress) that the United States has to take stronger ac
tions" in dealing with the South African government.
"We're all against apartheid. . . . The question is what
we should be doing," he said.
Zschau said that two types of approaches to dealing
with the problem will be debated this week in Congress.
One approach calls for first imposing economic sanc
tions on South Africa and then lifting such measures if the
government takes steps toward improving the rights of
blacks.
The other option entails establishing goals of equality of
rights to be met by the South African government and
then imposing sanctions if there is no indication that the
government is taking action to meet these goals.
"I haven't made up my mind exactly what way to go on
it," Zschau said, adding that any action must "promote
change that is beneficial to the blacks in South Africa."
He did not specify a timetable for when Congress would
reach a decision on how to deal with the South African sit
uation.
Before the meeting, Zschau was praised by members of
the Stanford Central America Action Network (SCAAN)
for his vote last week against President Reagan's proposal

for $14 million in aid to the Contras in Nicaragua.
Zschau received a standing ovation during the meeting
for his vote to halt funding, prompting him to remark that
"I can say that this might have been a more uncomfort
able meeting had 1 not voted that way."
Jim Helman, a member of SCAAN, said that Zschau's
"eloquent speech" Wednesday on the floor in Congress
was "largely responsible" for the defeat of Reagan's pro
posal.
Helman also announced the formation of the Central
America Legislative Information Center (CALIC), a Palo
Alto-based group co-sponsored by SCAAN and the Com
mittee Against United States Intervention in Central
America (CAUSICA). The new organization will
"disburse information about legislation concerning
Central America" in the western United States, he said.
Zschau said that his actions last week showed that "it's
not pressure that persuades me, but rather logic and
facts."
Zschau said that in his address to Congress he "didn't
use the arguments 'illegal' or 'morally wrong,' " calling
such avenues of persuasion "subjective." He said that
"regional negotiations" are the most effective way to
solve the problems of Central America, and called for a
continuation of the Contadora process.
Zschau also discussed his vote against funding for the
MX missile project, noting that he was not swayed by
local defense contractors.
"I said, 'Look, defense is not a jobs program,' " Zschau
said he told contractors. "We should be buying the
defense we need, no more, no less."
