# Cardinal Softball loses four on trip
## 
### DANE DUTCHER Senior sportswriter 
Fatigue, tough opposing pitch
ing and poor defense were the key
elements in the Stanford softball
team's 0-4 weekend in Southern
California.
The Cardinal, 13-49, lost a
double-header to Cal State-
Northridge Saturday, 1-0 and 7-0,
and lost yesterday to Chapman
College of Orange, 5-2 and 11-0.
Stanford's four games this
weekend made it 12 consecutive
on the road since April IS, and the
Cardinal players are definitely
tired, Stanford Coach Kathy Lin
coln said.
To call the pitching Stanford
faced in the opener against two
time defending Division II cham
pion Northridge "tough" probably
is an understatement. Winner
Kathy Slaten no-hit the Cardinal,
getting 19 of 21 outs by strikeouts.
Nevertheless, Stanford had a
chance to at least tie Northridge,
which scored in the first inning.
In the third, K.K. Bush and
Terri Silliman walked and ad

vanced on a passed ball, but Laura
Buchanan's strikeout ended the
threat for the Cardinal, which had
two hits in the second game.
First-game loser Betsy Watson,
who held Northridge to three hits
in the first game, relieved second
game starter Lisa Buchanan in the
fifth, but the damage had been
done by then. Northridge scored
two in the fourth and four in the
fifth after taking a 1-0 first-inning
lead.
Watson gave up Northridge's
final four runs, which all were un
earned. All told, the Cardinal's
five errors — three in the third —
accounted for five unearned runs.
Watson's performance was "pretty
good" Saturday, Lincoln said.
I he Cardinal trailed Chapman
in the first game when the home
team got four runs off Lisa Buc
hanan in the sixth and diminished
Stanford's two seventh-inning
runs.
Yesterday's nightcap was ended
after the top of the fifth because of
the 10-run rule. In four innings,
Stanford committed eiiiht errors.
