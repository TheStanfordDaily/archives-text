Yankees fell far behind the eventual
World Series champion Detroit
Tigers.
But last Oct. 25, Steinbrenner
ended that speculation when he an
nounced Berra would return in 1 1 )<S5.
"The Yankees will not be making
any changes for 1955. Yogi Berra's
contract will be honored," Steinbren
ner said.
"I just can't understand all these
teams changing managers the way
they do. The lack of stability is alarm
ing. ... It's startling to me how many
teams changed managers this year. . . .
It's getting so that you can't even
make news any more when you make
a change," Steinbrenner said.

Rumors of Berra's firing began cir
culating early last week, when the
Yankees lost games Tuesday night
and Wednesday night at home to
Boston.
Fhe speculation intensified prior to
Thursday night's game against Bos
ton. when it was rumored that Berra
would be fired if the club did not win.
The Yankees beat Boston 5-1
Thursday night.
Martin had been work in;', -is a scout
for the Yankees before he was named
manager yesterday.

managerial change orchestrated by
Steinbrenner in his 1 1 years as prin
cipal owner of the Yankees.
Steinbrenner called King in the
seventh inning of yesterday's game
and told him of his decision.
"I didn't know where he was call
ing from and I didn't ask him," said
King. "1 don't think these three
games had anything to do with it at
all. George even said he hoped Yogi
would go out with a winner."
The Yankees clubhouse was
gloom\ as Berra went around to each
player, say ing his goodbyes.
"He's the boss." Berra said of
Steinbrenner. "I had an inkling when
you hear it every day.
"This weekend? 1 don't think it had
anything to do with it. What can you
do when you lose three one-run
games? This is a good ballclub.
They'll get it together. They'll be all
right. Did I have a chance? He
(Steinbrenner) must have thought
so."
