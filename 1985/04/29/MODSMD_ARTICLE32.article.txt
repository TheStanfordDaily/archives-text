## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
It seems that the Stanford and USC
women's tennis teams just can't stay
away from each other.
As if their two team matches in the
past two weeks weren't enough.
Cardinal and Trojans netters met
again this weekend in the various
flights of the X6th annual Ojai Valley
Tennis Tournament.
And. as has been the case in the
last two Stanford-USC team matches,
the Cardinal got the better of the
Trojans at Ojai. But just barely.
Stanford repeated as winners of the
Heffelfinger Trophy, awarded to the
team that wins the most matches in
the intercollegiate singles and
doubles brackets. Stanford netters
won 14 total matches to USC's 13.
13nt in head-to-head competition,
the Trojans won all three matches
against the Cardinal, including the
singles championship.
USC's Cecelia Fernandez defeated
Linda Gates in the singles final yes
terday, 3-6, 6-2. 6-3. Fernandez, a
three-time AlI-American, was a
surprise finalist after beating another
Stanford netter, Leigh Anne

Eldredge, in Saturday's semifinals. 1-
6. 6-4. 6-2.
It was the second time in a week
that Fernandez heat Eldredge — who
won the intercollegiate singles title
last year — and the second straight
time that Fernandez did it after losing
the first set badly. Last week at Stan
ford. Eldredge took the first set from
Fernandez 6-0.
In the intercollegiate doubles com
petition. it was USC again that
knocked the Cardinal out. Mary Nor
wood and Dena Levy defeated Stan
ford's team of Stephanie Savides and
Kay l ittle, 7-5, 6-2. in the semifinals
Saturday.
While USC was battling it out with
Stanford in the intercollegiate flights,
it was Stanford versus Stanford in the
women's open singles tournament.

all tournament, beat teammate Alyce
Werdel in the final yesterday, 6-3, 6-
1.
In the women's open doubles com
petition. Stanford's Susan Ross and
