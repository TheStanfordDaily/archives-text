The home turf was not as kind as it
could have been to the Stanford cy
cling club this weekend.
The team, racing in the Stanford
Criterium around Wilbur and Stern
Halls Saturday, was edged out by
archrival UC-Santa Barbara 222-
161, despite very strong individual
performances by some Expert and
Novice riders.
Brad Chen won an exciting and
fast-paced race in the Expert division.
Chen broke away with two other
riders with five laps to go and
squeaked to a very close win in the
sprint on the last lap.
Doug Johnson won almost by acci
dent in the Novice B race. Afraid that
he rflight be taken down by a careless
Santa Barbara rider in the back of the
pack with two laps to go, Johnson
sprinted to the front. When nobody
challenged his lead, he kept on riding
hard to the finish, winning by 20
yards.
"Brad's win was one of the most
exciting I've seen in some time," said
Stanford Coach Tim Nicholson, "and
Doug had a great breakaway."
The women's team was hurt by the
absence of its best rider, Katrin
Tobin, but it still swept fourth
through seventh places.
Stanford is now 49 points behind
the Gauchos in the race for the lead
in the United States Cycling Federa
tion's Collegiate Western Division.
