# Novice crews sweep five

The Stanford freshman and
novice men's crew teams "ran up
the broom" Saturday in Redwood
Shores, sweeping all five races in a
three-way meet against Santa Clara
and Sacramento State.
According to Cardinal Frosh/-
Novice Coach Jim Farwell, it is
crew tradition to hoist a broom up a
flagpole when a team scores a clean
sweep over its opponents. "It's kind
of humiliating for the other teams,"
Farwell said. But the tradition was
only an expression for Stanford
Saturday — there is no flagpole at
Redwood Shores.
But neither the lack of a flagpole
nor the relative weakness of the

Santa Clara and Sacramento State
crews could detract from the sweet
ness of Stanford's victory. After its
competition with the likes of na
tional powerhouses California and
Washington, this weekend's easy
victory was a "confidence-builder"
for the Cardinal.
"I think the team was amazed
that there was that much difference
between the teams we've been
competing with and the rest of the
crews," Farwell said. "I'd been tel
ling them all along, but I don't
think they believed me until now."
Nearly all of the victories came
with ease. In the novice eight com
petition — one of only two races
that Sacramento State entered —

Stanford won by four-and-one-half
lengths, the same margin of victory
it enjoyed in both the freshman
eight and first novice four races.
In the second novice four race,
Stanford handed Santa Clara what
Farwell called "a horizon job —
they were just coming over the
horizon when we finished." The
only relatively close race was the
second novice eight, but even then
both Stanford boats finished ahead
of the Santa Clara entry.
The Cardinal freshmen and
novices will be in Sacramento Sat
urday for the small school cham
pionships, against such high-ranked
Division II schools as San Diego
State and Santa Clara.
