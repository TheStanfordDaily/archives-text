# Card laxmen drop first

The Stanford lacrosse team's perfect season came to an
end here Saturday with a 19-11 loss to rival UC-Santa
Barbara in the Northern California Championships.
The Gauchos, whom Stanford had defeated earlier this
year, now advance to the semifinals of the state cham
pionships against Whittier College.
"They were a little different team this time than they
were when we played them before," Cardinal Coach Jim
Bidell said. "They're playing together as a team now.
"We were a little bit flat," he continued. "They were
definitely higher emotionally."

Santa Barbara jumped on starting goalie Pete Manos
early, taking a 12-6 lead by halftime. Manos, whom Bidell
said "certainly wasn't at his best" as a result of a sprained
ankle suffered in a basketball game, was replaced by
Andy Kerr late in the first half.
Stanford began to come back at the start of the third
period, but the rally fizzled out. Kerr played a solid game
and contained the Gauchos for all but the final minutes of
the game, when the contest was obviously out of reach.
John Patrick, whom Bidell said played "an outstanding
game," led the Cardinal with five goals and two assists.
John Cox and Greg Simon each scored two goals, while
Lake Price and Vinnie Frost recorded one apiece.
