Eleven University of California
regents, including Gov. George
Deukmejian, former U.S. Attor
ney General William French
Smith and Hoover Institution
Director W. Glenn Campbell, own
stock in companies that do busi
ness in South Africa, the
Sacramento Bee reported yester
day.
Two sons of a 12th regent, Lt.
Gov. Leo McCarthy, also have
shares of a firm that has business
interests in the racially segregated
country, the newspaper added.
Ten of the 12 regents, including
Deukmejian and McCarthy, could
have a conflict of interest if they
participate in the decision because
they or their children own stock in
South African-related companies
that are also in the UC portfolio.
I.vnn Montgomery, a spokes-

woman for the state's Fair Political
Practices Commission, said a con
flict of interest would result if the
regents' action resulted in at least
a $1 million impact on a Fortune
500 company and a $250,000 im
pact on a company not among the
500 biggest firms.
UC President David Gardner
has asked the university's attorney
to advise the 28 regents at their
May 16-17 meeting whether
regents with South African-related
stock could violate the state's
conflict-of-interest laws if they
vote on the divestiture question.
Other regents with stock in
companies that do business in
South Africa are Gardner, state
schools chief Bill Honig, Edward
Carter, Stanley Sheinbaum,
Robert Noyce, Harold Williams,
Joseph Moore and William Mil
