# Prof, protests Soviet exchange

### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
A number of prominent scientists, including a
Nobel laureate professor in the the Chemistry De
partment here, have joined together to protest So
viet human rights violations after hearing that sci
entific exchanges with the Soviet Union will soon
resume.
In a letter published Friday in Science magazine,
Nobel laureate Paul Flory, together with two other
Nobel laureates, protested recent news that scientific
exchange agreements between the National
Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the Soviet
Academy of Sciences had been reached.
Christian Anfinsen, a professor of biology at
Johns Hopkins University, and Arno Penzias of the
Bell Telephone Laboratories co-authored the letter
with Flory. In the letter, they objected to scientific
exchange agreements prior to observable improve
ments in the Soviets' treatment of dissident scien
tists, such as fellow Nobel laureate Andrei Sak
ha rov.
Exchange agreements between the NAS and the
Soviet Academy of Sciences were partially
suspended in 1980 when Sakharov was exiled,
without trial, to Gorky.
"Sakharov is a representative symbol for scores

of others. His situation has worsened. Neither he
nor his wife can get the medical attention they re
quest. . . . Scientific seminars by jobless refusenik
scientists are in danger of elimination," the three
said.
"What, then has changed in the past five years to
explain the about-face from the moral stance of
1980? the authors asked. "If anything has
changed, it has changed for the worse."
The letter was prompted by a February report in
Science magazine that the president of the NAS
had announced the resumption of formal scientific
exchange agreements between the Soviet and U.S.
academies.
Morris Pripstein, a physicist at Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory and chairman of Scientists for
Sakharov, Orlov anil Scharansky (SOS), yesterday
supported the authors of the letter
"We're not trying to say at this stage that they
shouldn t have this agreement," Pripstein said.
"We're just trying to say that there hasn't been
much discussion and that nobody really knows the
nature of the agreement."
SOS is a group ot almost 9,000 scientists who
have signed a statement indicating they will not
cooperate in scientific exchanges with the Soviets
until the human rights of dissident scientists in the

Soviet Union are honored.
Pripstein said Frank Press, president of the NAS,
had guaranteed the new agreements would protect
the human rights of "our colleagues over there," hut
that "when pressed about it, there hasn't been any
indication that there is any such guarantee."
"We were hoping to have such guarantees," he
said.
The letter written by Flory, Anfinsen and Pen
zias pointed out that the signing of the draft agree
ment occurred on January 22, 1985, the fifth an
niversary of Sakharov's exile, and a date which the
letter's authors said was "particularly poor" in its
timing.
Because the date of the letter's publication was
not known, copies were sent to those members of
NAS expected at the organization's meeting last
week in Washington, D.C., according to Pripstein.
Pripstein said it was "through this mechanism
that we were hoping to reach other scientists."
Authors of the letter published on Friday also
called on other scientists to "be bold to speak out."
"Above all, we should insist that individual
cooperation depends on demonstrable evidence of
improvements in the human rights status of those
scientists who, like Sakharov, have been denied
access to official programs," the letter concluded.
