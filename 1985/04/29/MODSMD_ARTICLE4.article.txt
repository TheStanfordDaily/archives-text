"President Kennedy, where is
apartheid on Stanford's public
agenda?" shouted SOSA member
Donna Anderson at Friday's after
noon rally.
Total divestment, if not apartheid
itself, is now on the agenda of the
May 14 Board of Trustees meeting,
as University President Donald Ken
nedy acquiesced Friday to several
strategic demands of the recently
formed anti-apartheid organization,
Stanford Out of South Africa
(SOSA).
The liaison committee of SOSA
presented Kennedy with three
demands: 1) that total divestment of
University funds from companies
doing business in South Africa be put
on the agenda of the May 14 Board of
Trustees meeting; 2) that all trustees
be at a public forum some time be
tween May 6 and May 9; 3) that trus
tees who live in the Bay Area meet
with the liaison committee.
Kennedy agreed to the first two re
quests, although not all trustees are
pledged to be at the forum, according

to SOSA member Bill Cohn. Ken
nedy also promised to contact local
trustees over the weekend regarding
a meeting with the liaison committee,
but he did not promise that such a
meeting would take place, Cohn said
later.
If Kennedy does not satisfactorily
contact the trustees, SOSA will con
tact them and try to arrange a
meeting, Cohn said.
The liaison committee plans to
meet again with Kennedy today to
discuss that meeting and also to dis
cuss details for the forum, according
to Cohn.
"I think it was a very positive
meeting," Steve Phillips, SOSA
member and chairman of the Black
Student Union (BSU), told The Daily
regarding Friday's meeting with Ken
nedy. "It eliminates a lot of uncer
tainty about what's going to happen."
However, Kennedy's position on
total divestment "shows a fundamen
tal lack of understanding about the
nature of the oppression of the black
majority (in South Africa). If he
really understood it, he would listen
to representatives of the struggle

in South Africa," Phillips said.
Kennedy has frequently stated that
although he is opposed to apartheid,
he does not believe that total divest
ment is the way to eliminate the racist
system.
l- When energetic compassion
meets social indifference, it spills over
as frustration. And as a result, much
moral force is now being applied to a
remedy (divestment) that in my
judgment is clearly the wrong one,"
Kennedy told an audience of 500 at a
Rotary International meeting on
Friday.
According to SOSA member Joel
Bellenson, Kennedy said that al
though total divestment is on the
agenda, it is unlikely that the Board
of Trustees will vote on the issue at
the May 14 meeting.
"The likelihood that they will vote
is directly related to the pressure we
put on them," Bellenson told the
cheering protesters during the rally in
the Quad.
Alice Stauffer, another SOSA
member, said, "As of a week ago.
