"President Kennedy, where is
apartheid on Stanford's public
agenda?" shouted SOSA member
Donna Anderson at Friday's after
noon rally.
Total divestment, if not apartheid
itself, is now on the agenda of the
May 14 Board of Trustees meeting,
as University President Donald Ken
nedy acquiesced Friday to several
strategic demands of the recently
formed anti-apartheid organization,
Stanford Out of South Africa
(SOSA).
The liaison committee of SOSA
presented Kennedy with three
demands: 1) that total divestment of
University funds from companies
doing business in South Africa be put
on the agenda of the May 14 Board of
Trustees meeting; 2) that all trustees
be at a public forum some time be
tween May 6 and May 9; 3) that trus
tees who live in the Bay Area meet
with the liaison committee.
Kennedy agreed to the first two re
quests, although not all trustees are
pledged to be at the forum, according

to SOSA member Bill Cohn. Ken
nedy also promised to contact local
trustees over the weekend regarding
a meeting with the liaison committee,
but he did not promise that such a
meeting would take place, Cohn said
later.
If Kennedy does not satisfactorily
contact the trustees, SOSA will con
tact them and try to arrange a
meeting, Cohn said.
The liaison committee plans to
meet again with Kennedy today to
discuss that meeting and also to dis
cuss details for the forum, according
to Cohn.
"I think it was a very positive
meeting," Steve Phillips, SOSA
member and chairman of the Black
Student Union (BSU), told The Daily
regarding Friday's meeting with Ken
nedy. "It eliminates a lot of uncer
tainty about what's going to happen."
However, Kennedy's position on
total divestment "shows a fundamen
tal lack of understanding about the
nature of the oppression of the black
majority (in South Africa). If he
really understood it, he would listen
to representatives of the struggle

in South Africa," Phillips said.
Kennedy has frequently stated that
although he is opposed to apartheid,
he does not believe that total divest
ment is the way to eliminate the racist
system.
l- When energetic compassion
meets social indifference, it spills over
as frustration. And as a result, much
moral force is now being applied to a
remedy (divestment) that in my
judgment is clearly the wrong one,"
Kennedy told an audience of 500 at a
Rotary International meeting on
Friday.
According to SOSA member Joel
Bellenson, Kennedy said that al
though total divestment is on the
agenda, it is unlikely that the Board
of Trustees will vote on the issue at
the May 14 meeting.
"The likelihood that they will vote
is directly related to the pressure we
put on them," Bellenson told the
cheering protesters during the rally in
the Quad.
Alice Stauffer, another SOSA
member, said, "As of a week ago.
total divestment wasn't even an issue,
and now it's on the agenda (of the
Board of Trustees). . . . We decided
we want to continue this vigil (outside
Kennedy's office in the Inner CJuad).
We have to keep a constant reminder
to him. . . . We have to expand the
pressure."
SOSA plans a number of activities
both to expand the pressure and to
educate people about apartheid and
divestment.
SOSA's education committee is
planning a series of noon rallies and
teach-ins with speakers, has printed
and distributed a leaflet explaining

the nature of apartheid and why Stan
ford should divest, and is planning to
have speakers and discussions at
various dormitories, committee mem
ber Mario Huerta said yesterday.
Branner and Casa Zapata have
pledged to send people to sleep in at
the Quad and help maintain the vigil,
according to Huerta. Wednesdays are
targeted as big sleep-in nights, he
said.
Contacts are being made with
alumni, faculty and staff to pressure
the University to divest, Cohn said.
SOSA plans to involve alumni by ask
ing them to withhold contributions to
the University, particularly for the
Centennial celebration, until the Uni
versity divests, said SOSA member
Elizabeth Enslin.

An alternative fund for alumni
donations — similar to one at Har
vard — is being considered, Cohn
told The Daily. Contributions to the
fund would be invested in a socially
responsible manner and the money
would be held for University use until
it divests. "It's appealing to [the ad
ministration's] monetary sen
sibilities," Cohn said.
Faculty members are meeting to
consider the connection between fac
ulty pension and University invest
ments tied to South Africa, Enslin
said.
Forty-seven Freshman English in
structors and teaching assistants
signed a petition in support of the stu
dent demonstration, said Becky
Mark, a graduate student in English.

Members of United Stanford
Workers (USW) are writing letters
and solidarity statements in support
of the students and total divestment,
Cohn said.
At Friday's rally, numerous people,
including feminist author Grace Paley
and students from other campuses,
made statements supporting SOSA's
efforts.
"For many years you have been
silenced, the history books rewritten,
and it's been hoped that you will
never know what really happenned in
the past," Paley told the crowd of ap
proximately 800. "But you have
come forward and turned a great cor
ner in the history of this decade. I
think we're in this for good," she said
regarding the anti-apartheid move

ment.
David Brooks, a student at San
Jose State, said protest organizers
there had managed to contact Winnie
Mandela, known as the "First Lady"
of black South Africa. Mandela was
one of seven black leaders banned by
the South African government for ac
tivities connected with the 1976
Soweto riots.
"When we told her about the
demonstrations at colleges across the
nation, she said, 'Oh my God. That
must mean our freedom is coming
soon. When we've won, we will re
member those who supported us, and
wc have a long memory,' " Brooks
said.
"This (movement) is not a fad, this
is a very deeply felt, deeply rooted

feeling among all of us," SOSA mem
ber David Troutt said.
The vigil, begun Wednesday after
the initial rally in White Plaza, con
tinued over the weekend as students
sat in the Quad during the day and
slept there overnight. Approximately
100 people spent Friday night there.
Estimates of Saturday night's atten
dance varied from 35 to 80.
