### CLINT HIGHFILL Editorial staff 
About 350 people attended a rally
yesterday protesting lab animal ex
perimentation at Stanford and Syntex
laboratories, according to l.ise
Giraud, director of the Palo Alto
Humane Society.
After the two-hour rally in HI
Camino Park, the protesters, many of
whom led pets and carried signs and
small black coffins, marched to Stan
ford Medical Center's animal re
search facility. There, they spent
about 10 minutes holding a vigil and
listening to a funeral dirge played for
the animals inside the facility. Giraud
said.
The rally and march were held in
conjunction with World Week for
Laboratory Animals, an internation
ally observed week intended to "call
attention worldwide to the plight of
lab animals." Giraud said. The week
culminates Sunday. The rally was
sponsored by the Syntex Stanford
Coalition, a group fighting animal ex
perimentation in the laboratories of
Stanford and Syntex. a local genetics
firm.
The coalition eventually wants to
eliminate the use of animals in re
search and gain "representation on
Stanford and Syntex animal care
committees." according to material dis
tributed by the group. In addition, it
supports "animal protective legisla

tion" and seeks to increase "public
awareness and sensitivity to the suf
fering of laboratory animals."
According to Ellen Bring, attorney
for the Animal Legislation Defense
Fund, the rally was held to make
people aware that a national coalition
of universities and pharmaceutical
companies is "going to launch a
multi-million dollar campaign to dis
credit animal rights protests." She
said members of the consortium in
clude Stanford, the University of Cal
ifornia system and Cal Tech.
"Be prepared for the hvpe and lies
and deceits that are going to be
forthcoming" from the consortium,
she said.
During the rally, held across from
the Stanford Shopping Center, the
protesters heard five speakers, in
eluding a veterinarian from IJC-
Davis. an attorney from the Legal
Animal Defense Fund and Giraud.
The master of ceremonies for the
rally was Doll Stanley, a Redwood
City resident who fasted for three
days last week while inside an animal
restraining device. Stanley, who was
outside a UC-Berkeley administra
tion building at the time, was protest
ing Berkeley's treatment of labora
tory animals.
The day's events began with a
"funeral procession" from the Palo
Alto Veteran's Administration
Hospital to the shopping center.
