# Broken water main wets math building
## 
### MARILYN WANN Staff writer 
Classrooms in the basement of the
Mathematics Department should he
back in use today after a broken
water main spilled one to two feet of
water early Friday morning, forcing
12 to 15 classes to be canceled or re
scheduled, according to Barbara
Fairlie, a department administrator.
Work crews pumped water out of
the lower-level rooms and the sunken
courtyard of Building 380 all day
Friday after Facilities and Services
found the flooding at 6:30 a.m., an
hour after it had started. Rugs were
cleaned and seats dried so that rooms
could be ready by today, Fairlie said.
Martin Pearson, assistant director
of Utility Systems, said the break
probably was caused by disturbances
from nearby construction to an un
derground irrigation and fire pipe,
forcing several thousand gallons of
water to rise up through the ground
to seep into the building.
Pearson estimated that repairs to
the pipe, handled through his office,
would cost $500. Bruce Wiggins, as
sistant director of Operations and
Maintenance, could make no esti
mate for the cost of the workers and
contractors who cleaned and dried
the rooms, but said around 20 people
spent four hours on the job.
"It wasn't too bad." Fairlie said, al
though the losses in offices haven't
been assessed vet. The water reached

almost to the last row of seats in some
lecture halls with sloping floors, but it
left no permanent damage.
Room Scheduling quickly found
new locations for some of the 8 a.m.
and all but the largest 9 a.m. classes.
"It looked like Terman. All we
needed was the ducks," said Mathe
matics Prof. Mary Sunseri, whose 8
a.m. and 9 a.m. classes were canceled
because they were too large to fit in
any of the available space elsewhere
on campus.
She said she doesn't think the dis
ruption will set her too far behind in
the course material.
Tom Shoaf, one of her 8 a.m. stu
dents, recalled his first reaction to the
scene. "You could tell it was a sewer
from the smell. Then some people
said it was a water main."
He tried to get to his class by going
in the other side of the building and
walking down to the flooded lecture
hall, but gave up when he saw the
water a few inches up the front of the
stage.
"They had already cleaned up a
lot," said Shoaf. "I wasn't too inter
ested in sticking around there,
though."
Senior Daniel Rosen, who saw the
flooding at 8 a.m. when he went to
work on the fifth floor, said the
workers were up to their knees in
water outside as they started pumping
into drains.
