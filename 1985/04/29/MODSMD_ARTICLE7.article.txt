CIA said to aid rebels with SAMs
MANAGUA. Nicaragua — Defense Minister Humberto Ortega yes
terday claimed the Reagan administration is providing anti-Sandinista
rebels with surface-to-air missiles.
He said the Soviet-designed SAM-7 missiles, which are shoulder
fired, were acquired by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and given
to the rebels.
The Reagan administration will be responsible for "any situation that
might come out of the possession of this type of weapons in the hands of
irregular forces." said Ortega, brother of President Daniel Ortega.
The SAM-7s could be obtained by "irregular forces that fight in other
countries, such as El Salvador" and be used "for terrorist ends." he
added.
Leftist guerrillas are fighting the U.S.-backed government in El Sal
vador. and the Reagan administration has accused Nicaragua of supply
ing the Salvadoran guerrillas with weapons.
Nicaragua's army has Soviet-made surface-to-air missiles that
destroyed at least one rebel plane last year.
Last week, a Nicaraguan rebel leader, Indalecio Rodriguez, told The
Associated Press that his group, the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, has
SAM-7 missiles in its arsenal.
Rodriguez refused to say how many SAM-7s the rebels have, but he
said they had "enough" to counter the Soviet MI-24 helicopters the San
dinistas are believed to have received last November.
Summit to ease economic tensions
WASHINGTON — Leaders of the seven largest industrial
democracies meeting in Bonn, West Germany, later this week are
looking for ways to keep the world economy growing by soothing ten
sions over trade, monetary reform and domestic economic policies.
This annual economic summit comes during the third straight year of
an economic upturn for each of the participants — the United States,
Japan. West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada — but there
are concerns about spreading the recovery more evenly and expanding it
to developing countries.
The 148-nation International Monetary Fund reported April 17 that,
in general, the world economy performed better than expected in 1984,
with output growing, inflation declining and poor nations improving
their financial positions.
The report said the economic growth in industrial countries was nearly
5 percent in 1984, the best showing since 1976. It said expansion in the
industrial countries is expected to slow to an annual rate of 3 percent this
year and in 1986, although the pattern of growth likely will be more
balanced.
But the IMF report added that troublesome signals for the world eco
nomy include a current accounts imbalance among industrial nations in
which foreign investments in the United States have far outpaced U.S.
investment in other countries, there is persistent high unemployment in
Europe and slow progress in improving living standards in developing
countries.
The complexity of the issues assures that a mere two days of talks
among the leaders of the seven summit nations will produce no solu
tions. but it will be another step on the way toward agreement among the
heads of state that the economic problems facing each nation are a
shared problem of all the countries.
"These imbalances are interrelated, and they must be corrected if we
are to maintain the momentum of our economic success," Secretary of
State George Shultz said earlier this month. "We— and other countries
— share a responsibility to make some hard political decisions."
President Reagan, who leaves tomorrow for Bonn, had hoped to carry
with him the results of a test vote from the Senate endorsing a deficit
reduction plan he had worked out with Senate Republican leaders. The
summit is scheduled for Friday and Saturday.
Despite a nationally broadcast appeal for public support last week,
Reagan still had not rallied even a sufficient number of GOP votes in the
Republican-controlled chamber for the package by the end of the week.
Dachau survivors recall liberation
DACHAU, West Germany — Survivors of the Nazis' first concentra
tion camp came to Dachau from 38 countries yesterday to attend
services marking the 40th anniversary of the camp's liberation by Allied
soldiers.
Memorials were also held in Struthof, France, site of the only World
War 11 death camp on French soil, and in Greece. In Lyon. France, Jexvs

official charged with deporting French Jews to Nazi death camps.
At Dachau, 12 miles northwest of Munich, 2,000 people attended
Jewish, Roman Catholic and Protestant services. Some dressed in the
striped garb they wore as prisoners.
Approximately 30,000 people died between 1933 and 1945 at Dac
hau.
Max Fischer, state secretary of the Bavarian state government, told
the gathering that Dachau was "a symbol of the darkest chapter in Ger
man history, at which we Germans can only look back with consterna
tion and shame, with horror and deepest regret."
Dachau was one of the concentration camp sites considered for a visit
by President Reagan during his approaching state trip to West Germany.
But it was ruled out in favor of Bergen-Belsen, whose location offered
better security and communications facilities.
Speakers at the Dachau ceremonies made no reference to Reagan's
plan to visit a war cemetery in Bitburg, which contains the graves of SS
troopers, members of Adolf Hitler's elite guard.
In France. President Francois Mitterrand paid homage to the 12,000
people who died in Struthof. about 40 miles from Strasbourg. The camp
housed four crematoria and 17 barracks.
About 40.000 prisoners were held there from 1941 until France was
liberated in 1944. They included French Jews and non-Jews, Gypsies
and Germans.

The complexity of the issues assures that a mere two days of talks
among the leaders of the seven summit nations will produce no solu
tions. but it will be another step on the way toward agreement among the
heads of state that the economic problems facing each nation are a
shared problem of all the countries.
"These imbalances are interrelated, and they must be corrected if we
are to maintain the momentum of our economic success," Secretary of
State George Shultz said earlier this month. "We— and other countries
— share a responsibility to make some hard political decisions."
President Reagan, who leaves tomorrow for Bonn, had hoped to carry
with him the results of a test vote from the Senate endorsing a deficit
reduction plan he had worked out with Senate Republican leaders. The
summit is scheduled for Friday and Saturday.
Despite a nationally broadcast appeal for public support last week,
Reagan still had not rallied even a sufficient number of GOP votes in the
Republican-controlled chamber for the package by the end of the week.
Dachau survivors recall liberation
DACHAU, West Germany — Survivors of the Nazis' first concentra
tion camp came to Dachau from 38 countries yesterday to attend
services marking the 40th anniversary of the camp's liberation by Allied
soldiers.
Memorials were also held in Struthof, France, site of the only World
War 11 death camp on French soil, and in Greece. In Lyon. France, Jexvs

official charged with deporting French Jews to Nazi death camps.
At Dachau, 12 miles northwest of Munich, 2,000 people attended
Jewish, Roman Catholic and Protestant services. Some dressed in the
striped garb they wore as prisoners.
Approximately 30,000 people died between 1933 and 1945 at Dac
hau.
Max Fischer, state secretary of the Bavarian state government, told
the gathering that Dachau was "a symbol of the darkest chapter in Ger
man history, at which we Germans can only look back with consterna
tion and shame, with horror and deepest regret."
Dachau was one of the concentration camp sites considered for a visit
by President Reagan during his approaching state trip to West Germany.
But it was ruled out in favor of Bergen-Belsen, whose location offered
better security and communications facilities.
Speakers at the Dachau ceremonies made no reference to Reagan's
plan to visit a war cemetery in Bitburg, which contains the graves of SS
troopers, members of Adolf Hitler's elite guard.
In France. President Francois Mitterrand paid homage to the 12,000
people who died in Struthof. about 40 miles from Strasbourg. The camp

liberated in 1944. They included French Jews and non-Jews, Gypsies
and Germans.

people died and 247 were injured when flames swept through a private

injuries. Other police and judicial officials put the death count at 61, and
there was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy.

tals around the city, and those patients who escaped unharmed were
placed in other insititutions or were being cared for by relatives.

CIA said to aid rebels with SAMs
MANAGUA. Nicaragua — Defense Minister Humberto Ortega yes
terday claimed the Reagan administration is providing anti-Sandinista
rebels with surface-to-air missiles.
He said the Soviet-designed SAM-7 missiles, which are shoulder
fired, were acquired by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and given
to the rebels.
The Reagan administration will be responsible for "any situation that
might come out of the possession of this type of weapons in the hands of
irregular forces." said Ortega, brother of President Daniel Ortega.
The SAM-7s could be obtained by "irregular forces that fight in other
countries, such as El Salvador" and be used "for terrorist ends." he
added.
Leftist guerrillas are fighting the U.S.-backed government in El Sal
vador. and the Reagan administration has accused Nicaragua of supply
ing the Salvadoran guerrillas with weapons.
Nicaragua's army has Soviet-made surface-to-air missiles that
destroyed at least one rebel plane last year.
Last week, a Nicaraguan rebel leader, Indalecio Rodriguez, told The
Associated Press that his group, the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, has
SAM-7 missiles in its arsenal.
Rodriguez refused to say how many SAM-7s the rebels have, but he
said they had "enough" to counter the Soviet MI-24 helicopters the San
dinistas are believed to have received last November.
Summit to ease economic tensions
WASHINGTON — Leaders of the seven largest industrial
democracies meeting in Bonn, West Germany, later this week are
looking for ways to keep the world economy growing by soothing ten
sions over trade, monetary reform and domestic economic policies.
This annual economic summit comes during the third straight year of
an economic upturn for each of the participants — the United States,
Japan. West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada — but there
are concerns about spreading the recovery more evenly and expanding it
to developing countries.
The 148-nation International Monetary Fund reported April 17 that,
in general, the world economy performed better than expected in 1984,
with output growing, inflation declining and poor nations improving
their financial positions.
The report said the economic growth in industrial countries was nearly
5 percent in 1984, the best showing since 1976. It said expansion in the
industrial countries is expected to slow to an annual rate of 3 percent this
year and in 1986, although the pattern of growth likely will be more
balanced.
But the IMF report added that troublesome signals for the world eco
nomy include a current accounts imbalance among industrial nations in
which foreign investments in the United States have far outpaced U.S.
investment in other countries, there is persistent high unemployment in
Europe and slow progress in improving living standards in developing
countries.
The complexity of the issues assures that a mere two days of talks
among the leaders of the seven summit nations will produce no solu
tions. but it will be another step on the way toward agreement among the
