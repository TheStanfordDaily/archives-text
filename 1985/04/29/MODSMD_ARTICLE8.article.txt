### 
MOSCOW — President Daniel Ortega of
Nicaragua arrived yesterday in the Soviet Union,
the key stop on a nine-nation tour of Communist
nations during which he is expected to seek $200
million to supplement Soviet military aid.
The trip comes at a time of fierce debate in the
United States about U.S. policy toward Nicaragua.
The Soviet news agency Tass said this weekend
that the Reagan administration max be preparing
an economic blockade of Nicaragua after Congress
rejected its request for Sl 4 million in aid to the
Contras. foes of the leftist Sandinista government.
U.S. officials have said the Soviets provided
Nicaragua with millions of dollars worth of militar\
aid. Oil industry and diplomatic sources in Central
America have said the Soviets supply much of
Nicaragua's oil.
But reports indicate the Kremlin has provided
little hard cash to help Ortega solve Nicaragua's
economic problems, which include a 250 percent
annual inflation rate, shrinking production and
shortages of food and consumer goods.
A government source in Managua, the capital of
Nicaragua, has saicl Ortena planned to ask Moscow

for S2OO million in emergency cash to buy food and
other essentials. The source spoke on condition of
a no ny mity.
1 he Soviet news media reported only that Or
tega was welcomed by Geidar Aliev. a member of
the Politburo and first deputy premier.
Obserxing standard protocol., the Communist
Party newspaper Pravda published a photograph
and brief biography of Ortega.
The Cuban news agency Prensa Latina said Or
tega met President Fidel Castro of Cuba during a
Friday stopover in Havana. The agency said late
Saturday that Ortega and Castro condemned U.S.
policy in Central America, but the dispatch made
no mention of aid.
Ortega left Managua on Friday with 30 other
Nicaraguan officials. He was in Moscow for the fu
neral of President Konstantin Chernenkoon March
13. and met with new Communist Party leader
Mikhail Gorbachev.
Chernenko and Aliev met Ortega in June 1984.
when he came to Moscow seeking Soviet aid to
prop up the Nicaraguan economy. No details of any
aid agreements were revealed after that trip.

The Soviets have never said that they provide
military aid to Nicaragua, but periodically haxe an
nounced technical assistance. The Soviets granted
Managua 550 million in easy-term credits in 1981
to bux Soviet agricultural machinery and chemicals.
Nicaragua also is an observing member of the
Soviet-led economic organization COMECON,
and Ortega max seek economic aid from other
members on his trip.
The goxeminent source in Managua said Ortega
will be gone for 15 days. Tass said his trip included
stops in Cuba. Yugoslavia and all six Soviet allies in
Eastern Europe — East Germany. Bulgaria.
C/echosloxakia. Hungary. Romania and Poland.
Orteua's visit to Moscow was announced last
week after the U.S. House of Representatives
rejected Reagan's request for aid to the Contras.
Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.). the Senate majority
leader, said Saturday that Ortega's visit to Moscow
indicates Congress made "a major misjudgment."
"Now there is little doubt about President Or
tega's political leanings." Dole said, urging Reagan
to cut oil diplomatic relations with Nicaragua if.
Dole said. Ortega continued to shun Reagan peace
initiatives.
