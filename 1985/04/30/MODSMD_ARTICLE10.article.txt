# Reagan says visit is 'morally right'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President
Reagan, on the eve of departing for a
10-day European trip, declared
firmly yesterday he will visit a Ger
man cemetery where Nazi SS soldiers
are buried, saying it was "morally
right."
He also said the uproar over the
controversial stop will not ruin his
summit meeting with six other world
leaders.
Vice President George Bush,
meanwhile, called on the nation to
support Reagan in what he said "has
been a very difficult time for every
one and especially so for the presi
dent."
Reagan sets out tonight on an over
night flight to Bonn, West Germany,
for the annual summit of the seven
major industrialized democracies,
where he hopes to nail down a date
for the start of a new round of inter
national trade talks.
The journey also includes state
visits in West Germany, Spain and
Portugal and a speech in Strasbourg,
France, on the 40th anniversary of
Germany's surrender in World War
11.
Overshadowing the entire trip is
Reagan's planned appearance with
West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl next Sunday at the Kolmeshohe.
cemetery at Bitburg, near the Luxem
bourg border. Among the nearly
2,000 graves are those of 49 soldiers
from the Waffen SS, the elite Nazi
combat corps which ran Adolf Hit
ler's concentration camps.
Jewish leaders and American vet
eran groups have condemned
Reagan's planned appearance at the
cemetery. A resolution signed by 82
senators urged Reagan to reassess his

itinerary, and 257 members of the
House of Representatives wrote Kohl
urging him to withdraw the invitation
for Reagan to Bitburg.
During a ceremony in the Rose
Garden, Reagan confirmed that
former President Richard Nixon had
urged him privately not to abandon
the cemetery visit.
Asked if the controversy would
ruin the economic summit, Reagan
replied, "No."
Will he still go to Bitburg? "Yes,"
Reagan replied firmly. He made no
further comment as he walked back
to the Oval Office.
Later, however, in a television in
terview with foreign journalists,
Reagan said, "The final word has
been said as far as I am concerned. I
think it is morally right to do what I
am doing, and I am not going to
change my mind on that."
"All of those in that cemetery have
long since met the supreme judge of
right and wrong, and whatever
punishment or justice was needed has
been rendered by one who was above
us all," Reagan said.
"It isn't going there to honor
anyone," he said. "It is going there
simply to, in that surrounding, bring
to the people an awareness of the
great reconciliation that has taken
place."
Reagan also told the foreign jour
nalists, "Very frankly, I don't think
many of your American colleagues in
the press have been quite fair about
this. They have gotten ahold of some
thing and like a dog . . . they're going
to keep on chewing on it."
Meanwhile, the House postponed
action on a resolution urging Reagan
