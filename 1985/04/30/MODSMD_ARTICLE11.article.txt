# Court rules on controversy

### 
WASHINGTON — The Su
preme Court yesterday let stand a
ruling it was told could lead to
"the demise of the traditional
neighborhood school system" in
many American cities.
The justices, without comment
or a dissenting vote, cleared the
way for the forced integration of
Hispanic students in San Jose's
public schools.
The brief order left intact a
federal appeals court ruling that
the longstanding segregation of
Hispanic students from Anglo stu
dents in the San Jose Unified
School District was intentional
and therefore unconstitutional.
The justices were told that the
ethnic imbalance in San Jose's
schools stems from "a neutral and
even-handed neighborhood school
policy" — not from any intent to
maintain or add to segregation.
School district officials ack
nowleged there was great ethnic
imbalance in the schools, but said
the imbalance was due to residen
tial patterns and a policy of send
ing students to schools nearest
their homes.
U.S. District Judge Robert
Peckham ruled for the school dis
trict. He dismissed the lawsuit
after concluding that officials
"have never acted with
segregative intent."
A three-judge panel of the 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals up
held Peckham's ruling, but a larger
panel of that court voted 8-3
against the school board last year.

In their Supreme Court appeal,
lawyers for the school district said
the appeals court ruling "will ef
fectively preclude metropolitan
school districts like San Jose . . .
from implementing a neutral
neighborhood school policy and
deriving the benefits traditionally
attributable to it."
"If the Mth Circuit opinion is
permitted to stand, it will effec
tively result in the demise of the
traditional neighborhood school
system in the many metropolitan
districts faced with ethnic or racial
separation," the appeal said.
In other matters, the court:
• Agreed to decide, probably
sometime next year, whether the
Federal Reserve Board may regu
late limited-service banks,
proliferating as so-called "non
bank banks."
• Refused to let investors recoup
money lost when the Washington
Public Power Supply System
defaulted on $2.25 billion worth
of bonds, the largest default in
municipal bond history.
Bondholders still have other le
gal avenues open in their effort to
recoup their investments.
• Ruled unanimously in a Boston
case that public school officials
may be forced to pay the private
school costs of handicapped
children whose parents decide on
their own to transfer the children
from public schools.
