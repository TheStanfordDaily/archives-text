Shuttle has problem
CAPE CANAVERAL — Seven
astronauts and a mini-zoo of monkeys and rats
rocketed away from Earth yesterday on a scien
tific space expedition, hut they failed in their at
tempt to release one of two tiny satellites.
The launch, the second this month for the Na
tional Aeronautics and Space Administration,
was nearly perfect and the first of the satellites
ejected properly from a canister in the cargo bay.
But two tries failed to dislodge the second.
"No joy on the GLOMR deploy," said Com
mander Robert Overmyer. The initials stand for
global low orbiting message relay satellite; it had
been intended to be used by the Navy to relay
signals from remote sensors like those on ocean
weather buoys.
"You did all the right things," Mission Con
trol's Michael Mullane said.

It was not immediately known what caused the
failure, but there had been prelaunch worry that
the batteries — the $2 drug-store variety 9-volt
kind used in transistor radios— might not work
after prolonged time in space.
Robbers take $8 million
NEW YORK — Four masked, armed men
broke through the cinderblock wall of a Wells
Fargo depot yesterday, ambushed and disarmed
four guards and drove off with $8 million, pos
sibly the largest cash robbery in U.S. history,
authorities said.
An additional $12 million was left behind,
authorities said.
Although $11 million disappeared from the
Sentry Armored Car Courier Co. in New York in
1982, investigators say only a fraction of that
amount may have been taken by robbers.

Investigators "have some very encouraging
leads that came out of the crime scene search,"
said Kenneth Walton, deputy director of the
FBl's New York office.
"There is no indication it was an inside job,"
he said.
Market drops sharply
NEW YORK — The stock market took its big
gest drop in more than five months yesterday
selling attributed to concern over the interest
rate outlook.
I he Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell
15.46 to 1,259.72, for its largest loss since it
dropped 1K.22 points last Nov. 16.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
came to 88.86 million shares, against 86.57 mil
lion Friday.
