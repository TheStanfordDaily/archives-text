Cemetery talks resume
SAN FRANCISCO — Contract talks resumed
yesterday in an effort to settle a cemetery
workers' strike that is leaving 10 to 20 bodies a
day being stored at 19 graveyards on both sides
of San Francisco Bay.
Management and union spokesmen said both
want to resolve the cemetery owners' request
that workers pick up the costs of increases in
health insurance premiums beyond a certain
level.
"Management wants to put a cap on health
premiums as they now stand," said owners' rep
resentative Joan White.
"That's the major stumbling block," said Joan
Twomey of Cemetery Workers and Greens At
tendants Union Local 265.
Because of concern about the health issue, the
ISO-member union won't respond to a manage
ment request to return to work for two weeks and
submit the matter for binding arbitration if a new
contract can't be agreed upon. Twomev said.
Negotiations between management and

workers trom H) cemeteries in Colma and one in
Palo Alto are being held at the office of federal
mediator Reginald Bravo.
No talks have been scheduled for workers from
the eight cemeteries in Alameda and Contra
Costa, but union and management spokesmen
said if the Colma-Palo Alto workers settle, the
others probably would follow suit with a similar
contract.
The strike began on March IS after a stalemate
in negotiations for contracts that expired 17 days
earlier.
Funeral homes have estimated bodies are ac
cumulating at the rate of 10 to 20 a day.
Another strike in 1971 lasted four months and
left 1,800 bodies unburied and stored in sealed
caskets. After the strike settled, it took eight
months to handle the funeral backlog.
Quake hits Morgan Hill
MORGAN HILL — A minor earthquake
shook the area around Morgan Hill yesterday,
but there were no reports of injury or serious

damage, authorities said.
The earthquake measured 3 2 on the Richter
scale and was centered about 10 miles north of
Morgan Hill on the ( alaveras Fault, according to
the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) office in
Menlo Park.
An earthquake with a magnitude of 3.5 is ca
pable of causing slight damage. The Richter scale
is a measure of the energy released by an
earthquake as measured by ground movement
recorded on a seismograph. Every increase of
one full number means a 10-fold increase in
ground motion.
On April 24, 19K4, the community of Morgan
Hill was seriously damaged when an earthquake
measuring 6.2 on the Richter scale toppled
homes, wrecked businesses and cracked pave
ment. The USGS said the quake yesterday was
probably an aftershock of that earthquake.
Today's weather
Sunny today with highs in the 60s to low 80s.
Mostly fair tomorrow.
