## Tales from the depths of Lake Lagunita 
### 
Dear Hug Me:
Has anyone ever drowned in Lake
Lagunita? - Anonymous
Yes. At least three people have
drowned in Lake Lagunita.
The files of old news releases that 1
consulted mentioned two incidents;
neither victim was a student, and,
coincidentally, both worked for SRI.
One June night in 1 980, 26-year
old Rudy Gonzalez was drinking beer
at the lake with some friends before
quitting his job as projects coordina
tor for SRI. They decided to go for a
swim, and. 20 minutes later, his

friends couldn't find him.
Charles Burks died in March 1969
on a canoe outing. The 19-year-old
had been working for two weeks as a
mailer in SRl's publication depart
ment when his craft overturned in the
lake. The East Palo Alto youth had
just joined a "new life" program with
a pre-employment training project
and used his SRI affiliation to rent a
canoe.
The third story is from spring of
1943, and I found out about it be
cause my roommate's mother had a
friend here, then-freshman Adelaide
Simon, who went out boating and was
found drowned.
There may have been earlier inci
dents that 1 didn't find, but even this
number is surprising considering the
long period of the year when the lake
would be empty.
There were other hazards in the
lake's history on file. A live-foot

long, 16-year-old alligator named
Sam was once transported by
pranksters from its pen at Fremont
High School to Lake Lag, which
sparked a successful student search
and capture mission and much press
on the "Lag Mess monster."
Sam didn't do any comparative
taste tests on swimmers, and Univer
sity biologists assured that he could
feasibly live out his 100-year lite span
and grow to his 16-foot adult length
by snatching up birds, although he
would probably prefer rats.
Who picks the small picture or car
toon that appears in Once Around
The Quad each day? Is there a Daily

policy governing its selection or are
our minds being subtly manipulated
by some crazed editor? - Easily inter
ested in Stauffer 111
1 asked my utmost editor, Tim
Grieve, about your question, and he
answered all but the part about
whether he's crazed or not. He does
deny any effort to change your ideas
by applying silly subliminal messages
to your eyeballs, but I won't vouch
for any other methods he might find.
Choosing the picture is "a way to
pass the late hours," according to
Grieve, who thinks he was the one
who started the policy of varying this
graphic element daily and that he
may have copied the idea from the

Harvard Crimson.
The Crimson used a picture next to
its daily weather brief, supposedly
emblematic of the outdoor condi
tions, but Grieve said the Crimson
staff ended up using "turkeys a lot. I
don't know if that was self-analysis or
not."
The variety is new as of this
volume. In the past, the heading for
Once Around The Quad was a palm
tree that "looked suspiciously like the
Oasis logo, only with the tree bending
in the wind in the other direction,"
Grieve recalled. Before that, it was a
fuzzy drawing of the Quad.
Now, the space can hold anything
from a Grateful Dead logo, when

timely, to a picture of a staff photog
rapher or a xerox of a cassette cover
that somebody likes.
Even Grieve's father was pictured
on his birthday, an example of
reverse nepotism in miniature.
I don't think you should make this
into a big scandal, even though the
editorial board has never discussed
The Daily's responsibility to influ
ence the people who read about the
upcoming abalone dives and Czeck
oslovakian film series.
As Grieve said, "It's only a hot
topic when we realize we haven't
figured one out for the next day."
I was browsing through the phone
book the other day and saw something

I'd like you to explain. Why is there a
consulute of Madagascar in Palo
Alto? No, really, look in the hook un
der M. - Dave Brock
Well, it's sort of a cottage industry
consulate. Jean-Marie De La
Beaujardiere handles the details of
his honorary consul position from his
house, giving out visas, educating
businessmen wishing to trade with
Madagascar, welcoming tourists and
sending pertinent news home to his
island off the southeast coast of South
Africa.
He also helped make arrangements
during the Olympics for the Malagasy
delegation of four athletes, the mini
ster of sports and two assistants.
This averages out to about five
hours a week of volunteer work, ex
cept for the times when he spends the
whole day with visitors.
"I get to meet all kinds of people
that I would not meet otherwise," De
La Beaujardiere said, explaining why
he performs this service for his
country even though he is not a civil
servant.
This consulate is in Palo Alto be
cause De La Beaujardiere lives here
and the other four or five Malagasy
people in the Bay area don't want the
privilege of having curious reporters
calling them at home and asking them
why they list their numbers in the
phone book, I guess.
Who is responsible for all those people
painted on buildings in Palo Alto? -
B.M.
I don't know if he claims responsi
bility, but Greg Brown, local
4 muralist, painted nine munis as part
of the Palo Alto pedestrian series in
1976 on a CETA grant.
He chose four sites along Univer
sity Avenue and five in the nearby
blocks of sidestreets.
The subject ideas evolved out of

the buildings themselves, he said in a
telephone interview. The bright yel
low grabage man emptying a trash
can into a real trash bin on Hamilton
was an attempt to brighten a very
grey building.
The two burglars on the ledge of
Wideman's on University are not
really criminals. Brown says, but roof
hoppers, a pastime he learned about
in London and has always fantasized
about doing himself. The man on the
ledge is even a self-portrait.
The technique of his murals is to
use stark darks and lights to create
lifelike "fun encounters, open-ended
stories that people can make
whatever they want with," according
to the artist, who sizes his figures a
little larger than reality to create a
believable look. For example,
Brown's mural counterpart is stoop
ing and is still 10 inches taller than his
model.
Brown got the permission from
building owners for the first few
paintings, but after the first three
were finished, people started asking
him to decorate their shops.

Some of the other characters are a
"flying nun" who holds a toy airplane
and stands on a balcony above the
Swensen's on University. Another
man wears a trenchcoat and dark
glasses and a hat with a bird sitting on
it. A boy casts a fishing line into a
faux window on Hamilton, and a
spaceman stands next to a grocery
store on Lytton as if he were waiting
for a bus to swoop down for him. On
Waverly, an old lady waters her
flowers and is surprised by a sparrow
landing on the house. An old man
pushes his cat in a stroller.
Brown has received only a few
negative comments about the series.
One "shriveled matronly woman"
complained that there was already
too much "clutter" downtown.
Another viewer stated, "I don't
like art, but I like what you do."
Brown decided to take that as a com
pliment.
He is an artist of all mediums who
had no particular training, just "a
love affair with walls." He has done
everything from record covers to
airplane exteriors and is pleased by
the return to an "aesthetic sense"
that he sees in the people he works
for.
