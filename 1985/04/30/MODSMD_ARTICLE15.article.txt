F LORENCE. Italy — It would have been different if
her name had been Gerakline Jenkins, 19X4 Democratic
vice-presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro told Stanford
students and faculty at the Stanford Overseas Center here
April 22 as she discussed her campaign experiences.
Fcrraro said that one of the things that made her cam
paign "worth it" was the opportunity to carry on her Ital
ian name. "It was a first step for Italian Americans," she
said.
Indeed, the campaign also would have been different it
she was named Gerald Ferraro.
"The campaign was also a first step for women," she
said. "The candidacy of the first woman vice president
can't be measured. I was extremely fortunate to be able to
stand in the place of millions of American women."
Ferraro was here to visit her son John, who is studying
in the Middlebury College program here. "But this is not
all vacation," she said.
In Italy, she will meet with President Pertini and auth
orities of the Catholic Church at the Vatican. "Then I go
to Paris for a weekend of serious shopping."
She plans to visit England, where she will speak at the
Oxford Union and meet with Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher. After England, she will travel to Northern
Ireland.
"I'm an attorney, and I've been invited to be an impar
tial observer of the courts in Ireland, to view their policies
on civil and human rights." she said.
The former congresswoman from Queens took time out
to speak with Stanford students here because, she said, "I
have always had a soft spot in my heart for this age
group." She added jokingly, "Even if you weren't with me
in the election."
As a result of her fondness for college students, she was
quite candid in front of the almost 100 people in the group
as she recaptured the campaign. "Yes, the campaign is
over, and I have mixed feelings as 1 look back on it.
"It's hard to travel around the United States and wake
up and not know where you are — except on the issues,"
she said of her often hectic campaign travel schedule.
But she noted aspects of the campaign that were hectic
on a more personal level. For example, her transition
from being a third-term New York congresswoman to a
national public figure.
"I was convinced Fritz (Walter Mondale) wouldn't pick
a woman — especially me." she said. "I went from A to X
in a split second, and it was very tough."
She said that she had no idea what to expect from this
transition — especially in regard to dealing with the press.
"All of a sudden there were reporters watching me go to
church on Sunday. What's so new about me getting out of
my car? At first. I was so offended by that."
However, Ferraro said she did develop a good relation
ship with the national press. She recalled that the turning
point was her press conference concerning her finances.
"After that thev were funnv, tough, but objective. . . .

The women were even harder on me to show they weren't
soft," she said.
However, she said some of the local New York press,
specifically The New York Post, was not very objective.
"They went after my parents, my husband. They con
nected us to organized crime; they called me an il
legitimate child. Now you tell me. What is the basis for
that kind of garbage? It was all a lot of lies."
Ferraro said that the press in general was "tougher" on
her because she was a woman. "They were trying to test
me, to catch me on things like foreign policy."
She recalled that on "Meet the Press" she was asked if
she had enough courage to "push the button." According
to Ferraro, only two other members of Congress have
been asked that question, and they were priests who were
asked because of moral reasons.
"I was asked because I was a woman."
In response to a question about her views on U.S.-
Soviet foreign policy, Ferraro said, "I don't support 'Star
Wars' or deployment. I think it's a false hope, and it's also
terribly expensive."
However, Ferraro said she believes in a "balance and
realistic" approach to dealing with the Soviet Union. "I
believe in moving into Geneva for talks — in putting
everything on the table," she said.
"I support research. I feel you can move ahead with re
search, as long as it isn't deployment. But 1 feel research
has to be better defined," she said.
Ferrari said that now she has established herself as a po
litical figure who can knowingly talk about foreign and
domestic policy, she wants to remind the American public
that she is also a mother. For that reason, she said, she
recently appeared in a commerical for Pepsi-Cola.
"The commercial is about choices," she said aPer acting
it out for overseas students who had not yet seen it. In the
commercial, Ferraro tells her daughters, Donna and
Laura, that being a mother is a choice she'll never regret.
"During the campaign, I noticed that the women who
stayed at home were the most uptight about me," she
recalled. "They somehow thought I was putting down
their job. The commercial shows I feel this job is also im
portant and worthwhile."
Despite criticisms that she "sold herself out" to Pepsi.
Ferraro said she is not "the least bit sorry" for doing the
ad. It pushed across her message that "you can be
whatever you want to be. A woman can take first steps in
space, and teach her child to take first steps."
However, she admitted that the pay was quite good. "It
wasn't bad money for a day's work, a weeks work, a
month's work, five year's work
Ferraro said the bond between her daughters and her
self in the commercial is a genuine one. She said that the
election brought her family closer together. "And we're
tougher," she said.
Although the campaign was emotionally draining for
Ferraro and her family, she said that "it was the greatest
political opportunity" of her life, and she considers her
campaign to have been successful. "Reagan won it. but we

didn't lose it. We opened doors that will never be closed
again, and because of this we didn't lose."
According to Ferraro. the consideration of women and
other minorities for public office will become a trend.
"And since the talent pool is larger, the country will be
stronger and better."
In the aftermath of the campaign, Ferraro said that she
wants to move on with her own life. "I'm no longer a pres
idential candidate; that responsibility has ended."
But for Ferraro. the emotional effects of the campaign
linger. "I could not put on that dress that I wore to the
convention," a time that she describes as euphoric. "I had
it dry-cleaned and put in the closet.
"Then the Smithsonian called and asked to put it on
display — now that really does end the campaign." she
said.
But in another sense, she says her responsibility has not
ended at all. She is a spokeswoman for the Democratic
Party and has spent time since the election speaking to

groups of women, students and other Democrats. She said
that she continues to draw large, emotional crowds.
Ferraro has already seen some effects of her campaign
as a vice-presidential candidate. "Women are coming up
to me and telling me that they started medical school, got
jobs. It's wonderful watching people gain a new identity as
women."
She has also devoted time to writing a book about her
campaign experiences which will be on sale next
Christmas. "It's awful to write a book. You have to relive
the emotions of the campaign.
The toll that these emotions have taken on Ferraro may
affect her political future. "I'm feeling a little burnt," she
said. "I don't know about the future, I haven't even made
a commitment to run for New York senator in '86. I don't
know if I'll run for nation office again."
Without hesitation she added, "But I may change my
mind — and that won't be a female's changed mind, but a
politician's changed mind."
