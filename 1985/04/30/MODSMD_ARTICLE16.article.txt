## THE 						STANFORD DAILY McGrath should quit 
### 
The Hammer and Coffin Slate's easy victory in
the spring election shows clearly that students
here want a radical change in the ASSU. The
Council of Presidents candidates campaigned on
a platform that began: "Fuck the Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University."
Their language was coarse, but their ideas
caught on quickly. The slate members said they
planned to disband the senate and restructure the
student government "before every student or
ganization on campus is destroyed or dis
enfranchised." And they lamented the fact that
the current senate is "chock full of resume
packing tards."
Now they have their chance to clean up student
government at Stanford. They can re-evaluate
the role of the ASSU, re-define the senators'
functions and re-write the constitution. They can
garner support from the ne"iy elected senators,
seek aid from others within the ASSU, and ask
for the student body's continued backing as they
seek to implement the programs on which they
were elected.
Just one obstacle stands in their way â€” a force
that has made life difficult for hundreds in the
ASSU over the past seven years. That obstacle is

Graduate Senator Jim McGrath.
This senator seems to enjoy blocking legisla
tion, preventing student groups from achieving
their goals, and manipulating the entire senate
with his extensive knowledge of bylaws and intri
cate rules. Numerous senators have charged that
he blocks senate business for no apparent reason
other than to wield his power. As an example of
the animosity he has generated, a group of
senators attempted in October to pass an amend
ment that would have forbidden him to run for
re-election.
McGrath is back, though. He placed his name
on the ballot once again this spring, and won an
alternate graduate senator seat. Consequently, he
is the prime obstacle between the H & C slate
and its lofty goals, and he will doubtless cause the
slate members as many headaches as he caused so
many of their predecessors.
McGrath promised in his platform that if
elected, he would resign before his term of office
expired. Were he to keep his campaign promise,
were he to leave before the fall, it is obvious the
incoming members of the Council of Presidents
would stand a much better shot at achieving suc
cess during their term in the ASSU.
