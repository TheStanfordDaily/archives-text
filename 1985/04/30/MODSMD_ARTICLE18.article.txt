# Have we learned the real lesson of Vietnam?
## 
### 
Ten years ago today, the last American of
ficial left Saigon as North Vietnamese forces
invaded the capital. The collapse of South
Vietnam to communist forces following the
withdrawal of U.S. assistance and security
guarantees brought to an ignominious close
15 years of an undeclared war which shook
the foundation of our country and brought
continuing suffering to the people of Viet
nam.
The legacy of American involvement is one
of reluctance among our leaders to apply ma
terial and economic resources in support of
national interests around the world following
the belief that any U.S. involvement in the in
ternal affairs of another country will draw the
United States into a protracted bloody
struggle: "another Vietnam." In Nicaragua
today we find the Vietnam syndrome tele
scoped in congressional refusal not only to
send troops to support democratic forces, but
an unwillingness to support an indigenous op
position with U.S. aid.
Fifty-four thousand Americans died in
Vietnam. Nearly one trillion dollars were
spent. A decade of anti-war protests chal
lenged faith in American political and social
institutions, bringing down one president and
galvanizing a generation of young people.
Since Vietnam, foreign policy has been
paralyzed by a Congress more concerned with
legislating rather than sustaining it as is its
Constitutional mandate.
The War Powers Act forces the president to

account to Congress regarding military assis
tance and intervention. The Clark Act, passed
in 1976, prohibited aid to rebels fighting Marx
ist factions in Angola. The Boland amend
ment restricted the use of American aid to
democratic forces in Nicaragua.

Many Americans no longer support the use
of power to defend our national interests.
Gone is the time when President Kennedy
could pledge American readiness "to bear
any burden ... to assure . . . the success of
liberty." The consequence has been a growing
isolationism and retreat from international
commitments following the misperception
that America suffered in Vietnam a costly
defeat in a war which should never have been
waged and could never have been won.
American defeat in Vietnam, however, was
not inevitable. In fact, the truth is that
America won the war in Vietnam but lacked

the will to secure the peace.
When the bulk of American forces
withdrew from South Vietnam in 1973, Presi
dent Nixon's policy of Vietnamization had
proved largely successful: Th ARVN was an
effective fighting force with high morale.
America left behind a developed in
frastructure which continues to support
southern Vietnam.
The South Vietnamese government asked
not for continued American military pres
ence, but for material with which to defend it
self. And given the tools, it is likely that the
South Vietnamese government would have
been succesful.
However, in the two years following the
peace, aid to South Vietnam was more than
halved. The Vietnam War was lost not in the
jungle of Vietnam but in the morass of
Congress.
Had the Johnson administration and
Congress been willing to mobilize American
economic and popular resources in support of
the war effort, a peace could have been
achieved sooner. Faced with popular resistance
at home, the Johnson administration followed
a strategy not of victory but of avoiding
defeat. It wasn't until the Nixon administra
tion mined Haiphong harbor and began con
tinuous bombing of Hanoi that the North
Vietnamese realized we were committed to
victory.
The Vietnam War was not a civil war but a
communist insurgency directed by North

Vietnam and supplied by the Soviet
Union.The Viet Minh did not hold the hearts
and minds of the people but held their lives at
gunpoint.
America went to war in Vietnam to defend
democracy. It was a noble undertaking. While
Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos continue to
suffer under communism, the other countries
of the region have prospered with U.S. assis
tance. It is an oft-repeated lesson that
democracy in almost any form is better than
communism.
Often, however, America has been called
to support repressive authoritarian regimes
opposing communism and falters in its sup
port. America was much criticized for its sup
port of South Vietnamese President Thieu.
Thieu's rule was harsh. However, it is clear
that Vietnam was more prosperous and
enjoyed a greater chance for democratic
reform under Thieu than under communist
dictator Le Duan. Pro-western governments,
unlike their counterparts on the left, are more
responsive to western pressure and more
likely to pass on power to democratic succes
sors.
Even in the Philippines, American support
for the appallingly corrupt and inefficient
Marcos government is better than the alterna
tives. Should the U.S. withdraw support from
Marcos, communist forces would take over.
Soon thereafter, illiteracy would drop and
basic health care would improve. However,
there would certainlv follow an economic

stagnation and militarization.
Until recently, the legacy of Vietnam was
that America will bear few burdens to assure
the liberty of only a few group of friends.
President Reagan is attempting to restore
America's moral commitment to democratic
movements by pledging support for in
digenous democratic forces in Nicaragua.
Rebel resistance continues to grow in genuine
popular support, quickly calling into question
the legitimacy of the Sandinista regime.
Warnings of "No more Vietnams!" should
not weaken our resolve to assist the Contras
and other democratic movements around the
world. Nor should they threaten a protracted
campaign in support of such movements.
They should, however, remind us that we
must not fail again.
U.S. assistance to the Contras should be
forthright. America must regain its confi
dence in wielding its economic and material
power in support of freedom.
History is showing that America was on the
right side in Vietnam: 600.000 Vietnamese
who drowned in the South China Sea fleeing
the regime we opposed are a tragic testament.
This time we must persevere and preyaff,
thereby sending a signal to friend ana foe
alike that America will hear any burden in
defense of democracy. There must be no
more Vietnams.

ence, but for material with which to defend it
self. And given the tools, it is likely that the
South Vietnamese government would have
been succesful.
However, in the two years following the
peace, aid to South Vietnam was more than
halved. The Vietnam War was lost not in the
jungle of Vietnam but in the morass of
Congress.
Had the Johnson administration and
Congress been willing to mobilize American
economic and popular resources in support of
the war effort, a peace could have been
achieved sooner. Faced with popular resistance
at home, the Johnson administration followed
a strategy not of victory but of avoiding
defeat. It wasn't until the Nixon administra

tinuous bombing of Hanoi that the North
Vietnamese realized we were committed to
victory.
The Vietnam War was not a civil war but a
communist insurgency directed by North

Vietnam and supplied by the Soviet
Union.The Viet Minh did not hold the hearts

gunpoint.
America went to war in Vietnam to defend
democracy. It was a noble undertaking. While
Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos continue to
suffer under communism, the other countries
of the region have prospered with U.S. assis
tance. It is an oft-repeated lesson that
democracy in almost any form is better than
communism.
Often, however, America has been called
to support repressive authoritarian regimes
opposing communism and falters in its sup
port. America was much criticized for its sup
port of South Vietnamese President Thieu.
Thieu's rule was harsh. However, it is clear
that Vietnam was more prosperous and
enjoyed a greater chance for democratic
reform under Thieu than under communist
dictator Le Duan. Pro-western governments,
unlike their counterparts on the left, are more
responsive to western pressure and more
likely to pass on power to democratic succes
sors.
Even in the Philippines, American support
for the appallingly corrupt and inefficient
Marcos government is better than the alterna
tives. Should the U.S. withdraw support from
Marcos, communist forces would take over.
Soon thereafter, illiteracy would drop and
basic health care would improve. However,
there would certainlv follow an economic

stagnation and militarization.
Until recently, the legacy of Vietnam was
that America will bear few burdens to assure
the liberty of only a few group of friends.
President Reagan is attempting to restore
America's moral commitment to democratic
movements by pledging support for in
digenous democratic forces in Nicaragua.
Rebel resistance continues to grow in genuine
popular support, quickly calling into question
the legitimacy of the Sandinista regime.
Warnings of "No more Vietnams!" should
not weaken our resolve to assist the Contras
and other democratic movements around the
world. Nor should they threaten a protracted
campaign in support of such movements.
They should, however, remind us that we
must not fail again.
U.S. assistance to the Contras should be
forthright. America must regain its confi
dence in wielding its economic and material
power in support of freedom.
History is showing that America was on the
right side in Vietnam: 600.000 Vietnamese
who drowned in the South China Sea fleeing
the regime we opposed are a tragic testament.
This time we must persevere and preyaff,
thereby sending a signal to friend ana foe
alike that America will hear any burden in
defense of democracy. There must be no
more Vietnams.

Ten years ago today, the last American of
ficial left Saigon as North Vietnamese forces
invaded the capital. The collapse of South
Vietnam to communist forces following the
withdrawal of U.S. assistance and security
guarantees brought to an ignominious close
15 years of an undeclared war which shook
the foundation of our country and brought
continuing suffering to the people of Viet
nam.
The legacy of American involvement is one
of reluctance among our leaders to apply ma
terial and economic resources in support of
national interests around the world following
the belief that any U.S. involvement in the in
ternal affairs of another country will draw the
United States into a protracted bloody
struggle: "another Vietnam." In Nicaragua
today we find the Vietnam syndrome tele
scoped in congressional refusal not only to
send troops to support democratic forces, but
an unwillingness to support an indigenous op
position with U.S. aid.
Fifty-four thousand Americans died in
Vietnam. Nearly one trillion dollars were
spent. A decade of anti-war protests chal
lenged faith in American political and social
institutions, bringing down one president and
galvanizing a generation of young people.
Since Vietnam, foreign policy has been
paralyzed by a Congress more concerned with
legislating rather than sustaining it as is its
Constitutional mandate.
The War Powers Act forces the president to

account to Congress regarding military assis
tance and intervention. The Clark Act, passed
in 1976, prohibited aid to rebels fighting Marx
ist factions in Angola. The Boland amend
ment restricted the use of American aid to
democratic forces in Nicaragua.

Many Americans no longer support the use
of power to defend our national interests.
Gone is the time when President Kennedy
could pledge American readiness "to bear
any burden ... to assure . . . the success of
liberty." The consequence has been a growing
isolationism and retreat from international
commitments following the misperception
that America suffered in Vietnam a costly
defeat in a war which should never have been
waged and could never have been won.
American defeat in Vietnam, however, was
not inevitable. In fact, the truth is that
America won the war in Vietnam but lacked

the will to secure the peace.
When the bulk of American forces
withdrew from South Vietnam in 1973, Presi
dent Nixon's policy of Vietnamization had
proved largely successful: Th ARVN was an
effective fighting force with high morale.
America left behind a developed in
frastructure which continues to support
southern Vietnam.
The South Vietnamese government asked
not for continued American military pres
ence, but for material with which to defend it
self. And given the tools, it is likely that the
South Vietnamese government would have
been succesful.
However, in the two years following the
peace, aid to South Vietnam was more than
