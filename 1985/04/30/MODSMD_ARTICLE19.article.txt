## Stanford's South Africa options 
### 
South Africa is currently experiencing a sus
tained challenge to white minority rule mounted by
a broad-based coalition of African trade union, stu
dent, church and community groups. This internal
attack on the practices and principles of apartheid
deserves to he complemented by actions of individ
uals and institutions external to South Africa.
Stanford University is linked to South Africa
through holdings of shares of stock in corporations
which in turn control subsidiaries active within that
country. What can Stanford do, given these corpor
ate links, to support the anti-apartheid struggle?
One option, proposed by leaders of the sit-in
movement here and elsewhere, is for the University
to divest itself of all shares in companies active in
South Africa, on grounds that the corporations
both contribute to and profit from the maintenance

VIEWPOINT

of apartheid and that the University should not
share in profits made at the expense of a racially
disenfranchised and exploited majority population.
In this view, the corporations should pull out of
South Africa; if they refuse to do so, then Stanford
should pull out of the corporations.
The total divestiture option is appealing because
it is based on the moral injunction to avoid commit
ing or benefiting from harmful acts. But it is not
clear how this option can take us beyond the
avoidance of harm to the active support of a
desired future goal. If corporations should leave
South Africa because their presence is. on balance,
harmful to African interests, it does not follow that
delinking Stanford from companies that refuse to
leave will persuade them to do so.
Indeed, since divestiture is a one-time act that
terminates our future prospects of influence on cor
porate acti\ it>. its most likely effect is to render the
University's voice ineffective in any future debate
over what corporations should or should not do in
South Africa.
Moreover, even if Stanford's actions did have the
intended effect of causing large-scale corporate
withdrawal from South Africa, one important likely
consequence of such withdrawal would be a reduc
tion in the income available to the growing black
trade union movement from the union dues of
black workers formerly employed by American
corporations.
White South Africa depends to an enormous
degree on black labor power— on the farms, in the
mines and factories and in white homes themselves
selves. A coordinated, peaceful withdrawal of that
labor power in the form of a general strike holds. I
believe, greater potential for successful challenging
the system from belou than other scenarios that
have been advanced.
The presence of at least some American corpora
tions in South Africa can be useful in the event of a
general strike, both to provide worker income that
must be the basis of a strike fund and to generate

maximum international publicity for strike action
when it takes place.
Questioning the desirability of "total
divestiture" on these grounds need not, however,
lead one to support the past or current investment
policy of the Stanford trustees. In my view, that
policy option has been inadequate in three
respects:
1. The trustees have been unwilling to initiate or
co-sponsor proxy resolutions against companies
whose behavior is considered particularly offen
sive.
2. In considering whether a company's actions
constituted "substantial social injury," the trustees
have confined themselves to the company's record
as an employer of black labor — which in opera
tional terms has meant the company's willingness
to sign and actively implement the guidelines of the
Sullivan Code.
Until the Motorola case arose, the trustees have
been unwilling explicitly to consider a second crite
rion: namely, whether the goods and services a cor
poration sells are likely to be used by the purchaser
to repress the already disenfranchised majority of
the population. Nor have the trustees been willing
to consider whether a corporation is willing to take
a public stand against South Africa laws and regu
lations that most clearly violate the fundamental
human rights of the black majority.
For example, is the corporation on record as op
posing the influx control regulations which break
up the families of its black employees and their
neighbors? Is the company willing to violate such
regulations by building family housing for its
employees? The trustees, in short, have focused on
the company as employer, neglecting the ways in
which its products and its activities as corporate cit
izen may also produce social injury.
3. The method chosen to express University con
cern over companies with relatively poor records
has been quite limited: essentially to vote our
shares in favor of proxy resolutions asking a partic
ular company to charge its policies or leave South
Africa, with an explanatory letter sent to corporate
ma nagement.
Delegations of concerned students, staff, faculty,
alumni and trustees have not been sent to discuss
their concerns with management. Insufficient care
has been taken to identify and to avoid investing in
companies not currently in our portfolio with poor
employment, product and citizenship records. Too
little attention has been paid to banks in which
University funds may be held, to determine
whether these institutions have loaned funds di
rectly to the South African government. Such was
the case with Wells Fargo Bank in the early 19705.
The problem with the total divestiture option is
that its actual results are likely to be quite different
from its desired results; the avoidance of harm does
not necessarily lead to the promotion of good ends.

The problem with the University's current option
of selective criticism and even more selective
divestiture is that it reflects far too limited a view of
the ways in which corporations may gain from and
contribute to the apartheid system.
Is there a position between these two options
that is both feasible from the University adminis
tration's perspective and likely to support the ef
forts of Africans to undermine the
apartheidsystem? Consider the following recom
mendations:
1. The trustees should establish a policy govern
ing future purchases of company stock. They
should publicly commit themselves not to purchase
shares in South African-based companies which
have not signed the Sullivan Codes; or have signed
the codes but have a poor employment record; or
sell their products to the South African army or
police; or refuse to take public stands opposing in
flux control regulations.
2. The trustees should publicly commit them
selves not to place University funds in banks that
participate in syndicated loans to South African
government agencies.
3. The trustees should broaden their "substantial
social injury" criteria to include the nature and use
of company products, as well as a company's words
and actions with respect to influx control regula
tions that violate the integrity of their employees'
family lives.
4. The trustees should indicate their willingness
to initiate or co-sponsor proxy resolutions express
ing their concerns.
5. Selective divestiture should take place from
companies selling their products to the South
African army or police.
6. In cases where there is particular concern over
the employment, product and/or citizenship record
of a company. University resources should be
devoted to set up meetings between that company's
board of directors and a group of concerned Stan
ford students, staff and faculty members, alumni
and trustees. Such meetings could be held in cor
porate headquarters or on the Stanford campus.
7. Special efforts should be made to enroll
African undergraduates from South Africa at Stan
ford — for example, through the South African
Education Project, which already places South
Africans in educational institutions throughout the
United States.
Recommendations <>uch as these, based on the
principles of avoiding harm in particularly serious
cases and of taking positive action in others, may
provide some measure of external support for the
struggles currently being waged within South
Africa.
