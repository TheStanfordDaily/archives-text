# Flicks passes forged
## 
### PETER HAVEN Staff writer 
The manager of the ASSU Sunday
Flieks warned yesterday that recent
attempts by students to gain admis
sion to the shows with bogus passes
will create longer and slower lines in
the future as Flicks staff members at
tempt to crack down on the problem.
Randy Schwartz, a senior who
serves as manager of the weekly
event in Memorial Auditorium, said
people have been trying to sneak into
the Flicks with phony passes all quar
ter, but it was "ridiculous" at Sun
day's showing of "The Big Chill,"
when 10 to 15 people were caught.
"We caught some at the beginning
of the quarter, so we've been paying
special attention to it," Schwartz said.
According to Schwartz, the yellow
$8 student passes are being counter
feited in a variety of ways, and by
more than one person.
"From the looks of it, some of
them are being made on Macintoshes,
some by hand, some typed and some
photocopied," he said.
"It looks like someone tried to
make replicas and sell them to
people, and some people bought
them," Schwartz said. "Some of the
replicas are good, but most of them
aren't. There have been some very
weak replicas."
Schwartz said extra precaution —
resulting in more inconveniences for
Flicks-goers — may be necessary to
stem the rash of fake passes.
"They are making it so we will have
to slow the lines down a lot so that we
can check every pass seperately. And
we are going to have to do something
to the people who get caught," he
said.
" The Flicks is something students
do for students. They come to the
movie and it should be a mellow
thing. The people who are trying to
use the fake passes are just torpedo
ing the event for everyone."
Schwartz said he had "no idea"
how many people were successful in
getting into the Flicks on Sunday with
fake passes, but he conceded that
"probably as many people as we
caught got through."
Schwartz added that at the three
previous movies shown this quarter, a
total of 10 to 15 people were caught
attempting to use bogus passes.
Forging the passes is a felony for
gery charge in the penal code, accord

ing to Schwartz, hut he said, "We
don't intend to press charges . . . un
less it gets completely out of hand."
Schwartz said he plans to take the
names of the people who are caught
in the future and "make them public,
so that the people who go to the
Flicks will know who is forging passes
and causing longer lines."
"The problem is such that it needs
to he addressed," Schwartz said. "We
are really going to crack down for the
next movie.
