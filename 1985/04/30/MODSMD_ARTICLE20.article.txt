Hoover controversy
As far as the arguments go. The
Daily's story about the Faculty Sen
ate committee's public hearing on
Hoover-Stanford ties contained
nothing new. All of the points raised
have been repeated endlessly during
the last two years, and the same
rebuttals concerning academic
freedom, the outstanding stature of
the Hoover staff, and all the rest still
apply.
The story contains numerous
errors and misrepresentations. One
error in particular, however, should
be corrected for the record. It is not
true that "the Hoover Foundation
nominates the director of the institu
tion." The 1959 agreement between
the founder and the Stanford Board

of Trustees unci subsequent amend
ments agreed to by the appropriate
parties specify that candidates for the
position will be chosen by a 10-
person search committee consisting
of four nominees of the senior fel
lows of the Hoover Institution, three
nominees of the Board of Overseers
and three nominees of the president
of Stanford University. The presi
dent selects one candidate from
among the nominees of the 10-
perspn search committee, which is
then approved or disapproved by the
Board of Overseers, the Board of
Trustees of the Herbert Hoover
Foundation and the Board of Trus
tees of Stanford.
