## Seniors await NFL draft 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
Today will be a day of waiting for
the seniors on the Stanford football
team as the National Football League
conducts its annual collegiate draft.
Seven Cardinal players are ex
pected to be selected somewhere in
the 12 rounds, with a few others pos

sibly getting a telephone call from an
NFL team telling them they have
been chosen.
Garin Veris (6-6, 255) is expected
to be the first Cardinal to go today.
Veris, who has played defensive end,
defensive tackle and tight end in his
four years on the Farm, is projected
as a defensive end in the pro ranks.

Fred vonAppen, an assistant coach
with the San Francisco 49ers who
coached here under Bill Walsh in the
late "70s, said, "I think Garin will be
the first (Stanford senior) to come off
the hoard. He's got a bright future as
a defensive end. I think he'll go in the
first 27 picks."
The Super Bowl champion 49ers
will select 28th, meaning they do not
expect Veris to be around when their
turn comes around.
Sports Illustrated, projecting the
first round of the draft in this week's
issue, sees Veris being drafted 21st
overall by the Los Angeles Rams,
who need a pass rusher. The Sporting
News, however, predicts that no
Stanford players will go in the first
round.
Stanford Coach Jack Elway said
that guessing what happens in the
draft is essentially that — guessing.
"Those guys come around gathering a
lot of information, but they get awful
quiet around now," he said. "No one
really knows. You get surprised."
Speaking of Veris, who finished
last year with 57 tackles and five
sacks, Elway said, "I would think

he'll go late in the first or early in the
second. 1 think w ho ever gets him will
be real lucky. He's an outstanding pro
candidate."
Tom Briehl (6-4, 230) was not
listed as one of the Cardinal's top
honors candidates to begin his senior
season, but a year Elway described as
"consistant" —70 tackles— brought
him notice from the pro scouts.
"I like the looks of Tom Briehl,"
vonAppen said. "I think he'll go late
second to third round. I think he has a
good future as an outside linebacker.
Because of his size and speed, he's
got a good future. He's also at an area
that's not very deep this year."
Guard Matt Moran (6-4, 255),
tackle Jeff Deaton (6-3, 275) and
center Brent Martin (6-4, 260) are all
seen as middle-round selections. El
way ventured a guess of Moran going
in the third round, with Deaton and
Martin following a round or two later.
VonAppen sees all three going after
the third round.
Elway said of Moran, "I see him
going more like the third. I know
