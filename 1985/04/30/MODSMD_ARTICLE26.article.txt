Coming off a title-filled weekend at
the Pacific 10 Conference Individual
Championships in Ojai, the Stanford
men's tennis team plays its penul
timate home dual match today
against No. 5-ranked Pepperdine.
Stanford Coach Dick Gould calls
Pepperdine "a great team," and he is
more than a little concerned about
the competition. A loss would
jeopardize a good seed for the Card
inal in the upcoming NCAA champi
onship tournament.
"Pepperdine is simply outstanding.
They are easily as good as UCLA and
USC, and quite capable of winning
nationals," Gould said. "Pepperdine
has the ability to beat anyone on any
given day."
If Gould wants to avoid one of
those "given days," he will have to
see his players win matches against
Kelly Jones, ranked No. 39, and
Carlos DiLaura, a native Brazilian,
ranked 18th in the country.
"Pepperdine has some very, very
good players — Kelly Jones in partic
ular. They lost to USC 5-4 in a close
match, and again 5-4 to UCLA — an
other close one. When we played
them in the indoors (earlier this
season) everything broke right for us,

but they are certainly capable of
changing that this time," Gould said.
In Stanford's first season meeting
with Pepperdine, the Cardinal won
the match before doubles competi
tion started, and thus the teams'
doubles pairs have yet to compete
against one another,
Gould has a more recent reason to
be happy with his doubles teams,
however, which is a change from the
outlook following Stanford's 8-1 and
5-4 losses to UCLA and USC two
weeks ago.
Stanford entered three doubles
teams at the Pac-lOs over the
weekend, and the pair of Dan Goldie
and Eric Rosenfeld won the doubles
final match against UCLA's Ken Dil
ler and Brad Pearce.
Pat McEnroe and Derrick Ros
tagno reached the semifinals of the
tournament, losing to Diller and
Pearce, 6-3, 6-7, 7-6. Stanford's top
ranked doubles team of John Letts
and Jim Grabb reached the quarter
finals.
"What was important about this
weekend's doubles matches was our
success with our No. 2 and No. 3
teams," Gould said. "It's good if we
can win the second and third doubles
matches against UCLA's No. 2 and
No. 3 teams."

Eric Rosenfeld won the Pacific 10 Conference doubles championship
this weekend with partner Dan Goldie. The pair will likely need to turn
in another top-notch outing if the Cardinal is to defeat No. 5-ranked
Pepperdine this afternoon at the Stanford Tennis Stadium.
