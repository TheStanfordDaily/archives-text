# Card baseball signs 7 recruits

Faced with the loss of three
quarters of his 1985 infield —
John Verducci. Pete Stanicek and
Rick Lundblade — and pitching
ace Jeff Ballard. Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess combed high
schools from San Diego to New
York in search of new talent.
Some coaches recruit to fill
needs, while others go after the
best players available, regardless
of position. With an incoming class
of five infielders and two pitchers.
Marquess thinks he has found the
best of both worlds.
Yesterday, with a day off be
tween a series sweep of USC over
the weekend and today's 2:30

p.m. non-conference game at
Santa Clara, Marquess talked
about the Class of 1989.
"We needed infielders, but
these guys were some of the best
athletes anyway," he said.
Marquess is hoping that some of
his new charges will be able to
contribute right away. "It's tough,
but there are always some excep
tional freshmen like Jack
McDowell," he said. "Mark Davis
had a big freshman year, and so
did Ruben Amaro."
The newest members of the
1986 Cardinal are:
• Steve Chitren, a right-handed
pitcher from Las Vegas. Chitren is
14-2 over the past two seasons.
• Pitcher Brian Keyser, also a right
hander, from Chico. Keyser's fastball
and slider have propelled him to an 8-
0 record at Chico High School this
year.
• Frank Carey, a shortstop from
Granite Hills High School in San
Diego. Carey's greatest asset may be
his base stealing ability — he broke
the San Diego CIF record for steals
last year.
• Scott Delucchi, a power-hitting
third baseman from Serra High
School of San Mateo, the top-ranked
high school team in California.
Delucci leads all Bay Area high
schoolers in home runs.
• Ed Sprague, Jr., from St. Mary's
High School in Stockton. Sprague has
amazing versatility. He can play first
base, catch, and even pitch if neces
sary.
• Switch-hitting shortstop Glenn
Stevenson from Los Angeles.
• Ron Whitmeyer, a 6-foot-3, 190-
pound first baseman from New
York's East I slip High School.
