## Malle's 'Alamo Bay' unrealistic, sterile 
### 
Every second movie that has
opened in the past few months is a
teen comedy, and none of the
pictures that have received the most
attention from the press of late —
"Blood Simple," "The Breakfast
Club," "Desperately Seeking Susan"
— is about anything, so Louis Malle's
"Alamo Bay," set in coastal Texas
during the influx of Vietnamese be
tween 1979 and 1981, looked like it
might be an oasis in the Hollywood
desert. It's a terrible movie, though,
and the worst thing about it is that,
like "The Cotton Club,"it botches a
great subject that no one else is likely
to attempt for a long time. After the
fall of Saigon, the Vietnamese
flooded into this country, heading for
the Gulf Coast between Florida and
Texas, where many of them figured
on picking up the livelihood they had
practiced at home; fishing. By early
1980, some 320,000 refugees were
engaged in shrimping, crab fishing
and other like pursuits, and in what
Ross Milloy, in his article, "Vietnam
Fallout in a Texas Town," published
in The New York Times Magazine on
April 6, 1980, called "the last pitched
battles of the Vietnam War": an on
going struggle with the Texas fisher
men who believed the Asians were
"raping the waters" and usurping the
limited economic privileges that were
the birthright of Americans.
The issue was a complicated one.
The Coast Texans, many of them vet
erans, were not disposed to look
charitably on new neighbors who

represented a race they had been
trained to regard as the enemy, and
their uneasiness was exacerbated by
the refugees' lack of familiarity with
American customs — like the un
suitability ot firewood for gas stoves
or the inappropriateness of urinating
in the middle of the street. The Tex
ans felt, with some justification, that
the Vietnamese were fishing without
concern for the finite resources of the
Cult Coast waters, and the language
problem made it exasperatingly diffi
cult for wardens to communicate the
rules to these newcomers. But the
most serious conflict was economic
(or at least, the Texans viewed it in
that way). They felt the Asians were
taking the bread out of their mouths
by fishing in areas they themselves
had staked out years before, and that
they were receiving preferential
treatment from the U.S. government,
in addition, in the form of food
stamps. (This was, in fact, a miscon
ception.) Ironically, the refugees, in
their efforts to become successful
Americans, had brought a native in
dustriousness and frugality (bred un
der the treacherous economic condi
tions of their homeland) to bear on
the American free enterprise system,
and were quickly investing in their
own boats and moving ahead at a
greater pace than the Texans them
selves. The result was an adversarial
situation so thickly layered that vio
lence was inevitable.
Milloy's article, which inspired the
screenplay Alice Arlen wrote for
"Alamo Bay," makes it clear that
both camps were strapped in this con
flict, both acted consciously and un
consciously in ways that the other
could only interpret as wanton disre
gard for their rights and needs, and so
both were responsible for the vio
lence. (Milloy writes about the death
of a Texan named Billy Joe Aplin at
the hands of one Sau Van Nguyen,
who was put on trial for murder.
Nguyen's being set free provoked a
series of attacks, largely Ku Klux
Klan-initiated, on the Vietnamese
community in Texas.) Louis Malle,
the great humanist director who gave
us "The Fire Within" and "Phantom
India" and "Lacombe, Lucien,"
seems to have precisely the tempera
ment for a socially and emotionally
complex dramatic situation as this
one, in which individuals on both
sides obey their worst impulses be
cause of the personal and economic
pressures they feel or imagine. In this

month's Vanity Fair, James Atlas, in
terviewing Malle, compares "Alamo
Bay" to "Lacombe, Lucien," which
was also "about what happens to
people when they're caught in the
clutches of history . .. overwhelmed
by events beyond their control... the
K.K.K. vigilantes who terrorize the
Vietnamese . . . aren't just redneck
thugs; what makes them vicious is the
threat to their livelihood. For Malle,
morality isn't absolute; how we be
have depends on how life tests us."
Atlas certainly describes the picture I
wish 1 hud seen when 1 walked into
"Alamo Bay." But "Lacombe,
Lucien," an investigation of how an
imaginatively limited French peasant
boy becomes allied with the Nazis
during the Occupation, came as close
as any movie ever has to entering the
realm of philosphical thought (it was
like filming Hannah Arendt) — and it
was written by Malle and Patrick
Modiano. Alice Arlen, who co
scripted "Silkwood," is not capable of
that kind of intricate, balanced think
ing, apparently. In "Alamo Bay,"
there are only two kinds of people:
heroes (Vietnamese and American
liberals) and villains (rednecks).
The heroic contingent is led by the
young, ambitious Vietnamese fisher
man Dinh (Ho Nguyen, who has
sharp, shrewd eyes), the ailing Wally
(Donald Moffat, in one of his fairly
insufferable lovable-codger perfor
mances), who runs the only shrimp
plant in the town of Port Alamo that
will deal with refugees, and his out
spoken daughter Glory (Amy
Madigan); at the head of the rear
flank is a wise Chicano shrimper
named Luis (Martino LaSalle). Isn't
it a little late in the day for wise
Chicanos? Arlen must have acquired
her notions of liberalism in a high
school civics class where John Stein
beck figured prominently on the re
quired reading list. There is no reason
for Wally and Glory to act as decently
to the Vietnamese as they do, consid
ering that everyone else in town,
practically, appears to be a flag
waving bigot. Glory's iconoclastic
conduct, which includes taking Dinh
along for company when she drives to
nearby Corpus Christi to visit her
father in the hospital, is tacitly ex
plained in terms of her independence
and I-don't-give-a-damn-what
anyone-thinks attitude (and the care
lessly dropped information that she
spent some time in another town
before returning to Port Alamo; in

Corpus Christi, curiously enough, no
one feels the slightest hostility toward
the Vietnamese). But in a town where
xenophobia hangs in the air like the
smell of shrimp, she seems more alien
than the immigrants.
Amy Madigan, who wears her hair
blond here and is finally permitted,
after "Streets of Fire" and "Places in
the Heart," to have a little small
town glamor (she looks like Eva
Marie Saint in some shots), gives a
gutsy performance as Glory; she and
Ry Cooder's theme music are hands
down the best parts of the movie. But
it is only because Malle allows her the
opportunity to take her final scene
farther than the script implies— it's a
first-rate piece of acting, really —
that she isn't defeated by the good
!ibera 1 shackles Arlen has equipped

the role with. Not that Malle's direc
tion can fairly be said to be in conflict
with the screenplay: The final shot is
a freeze frame of Glory's face, with a
postscript superimposed on it that
tells us more than 15,000 Vietnamese
now work off the Gulf Coast — as if
Glory's courage were solely respon
sible for that happy development.
The white population of Port
Alamo, exclusive of Glory's family
and one earnest elementary school
teacher, is the most single-minded
collection of unsavory characters seen
in a movie for many a year. "Alamo

Bay" is like a reversion to those
dreadful, ominous portraits of small
Southern towns that "In the Heat of
the Night" put a blissful end to two
decades ago, only this time the target
of all the bigotry is no longer the
blacks, but the Asians — whom we
recognize to be inherently good, ac
cording to the current Hollywood
iconography, because they say grace
before meals. The Texans, on the
other hand, are represented by a
square-headed sheriff who makes no
effort to activate the arm of the law
when the refugees invoke it, teenage
punks who ride up and down the
streets abusing Asian girls, and grown
men who think nothing of engineer
ing obscene interruptions in the
services at the Vietnamese Catholic
Church.

The leader of the racists — they
tend to refer to the immigrants as
"Vietmanese" — is Shang Pierce (Ed
Harris), a vet who, between bouts of
beating up his equally mean-spirited
wife Honey (Cynthia Carle, whose
acting suggests she could have given
this role some depth if the script had
encouraged her), yells at the "gooks"
for cutting across his property to
reach their trailer next door and at
Wally for trying to "jew down" hard
working white men like himself.
Shang shows little interest in his kids,
and his resentment at Honey for the

way marriage has entrapped him (he
blames her for getting pregnant and
forcing him to marry her), carries on
a reasonably public affair with Glory
(whose attraction to him is the
movie's biggest puzzle), but when she
befriends Dinh. he resorts to sexual
taunts. Ed Harris plays Shang as a
cartoon, an ornery redneck who actu
ally sashays when he walks; what he
docs on screen is practically comedy,
but maybe there was no other way to
approach this part. The only pass the
movie makes at humanizing Shang is
to throw him a scene — a virtual
replay of sequences from "Country"
and"The River" — in which the
bank refuses to renew the loan that
allows him to keep his boat. (In this
context, the scene seems even
stupider and more fraudulent than it
did in those other pictures.) And once
he's lost the boat, his fury at Dinh,
who has just purchased a small one of
his own, knows no bounds; before
you know it, he's linked up with with
the K.K.K., toting a shotgun and
patrolling the Bay waters.
The shot of Shang and his cronies,
armed and posed like pirates on a
boat with a Vietnamese effigy hang
ing from the yardarm, is truly stun
ning; Louis Malle, after all, is a fine
director. But the movie is a series of
missed opportunities. It contains no
humor, although the encounter be
tween the Asian fishermen and the
local warden ought to be funny. And,
faced with a script as unnuanced as
Arlens, Malle loses his wit and the
irony that glistens in his best pictures
(like the 1981 "Atlantic City"). The
connection between the hometown
racism of men like Shang Pierce and
the values they lived (and survived)
by in the jungles of Vietnam is im
plicit in the repeated references to
"gooks," but the movie is so busy dis
tinguishing Dinh and his friends from
the Viet Cong that it doesn't, finally,
illustrate Milloy's original point: that
what happened in coast towns like
Seadrift, where Billy Joe Aplin died,
and the mythic Fort Alamo, was an
extension of the racial war that sup
posedly ended in 1975. If Malle had
shown the Vietnamese engaged in
guerilla warfare with their white
enemies, "Alamo Bay" might really
' have grappled with something,
despite Arlen's ridiculous script; it
might have been an incendiary movie.
As it is, it bears about as much rela
tion to reality as "Desperately
Seeking Susan."

effort to activate the arm of the law
when the refugees invoke it, teenage
punks who ride up and down the
streets abusing Asian girls, and grown
men who think nothing of engineer
ing obscene interruptions in the
services at the Vietnamese Catholic
Church.

The leader of the racists — they
tend to refer to the immigrants as
"Vietmanese" — is Shang Pierce (Ed
Harris), a vet who, between bouts of
beating up his equally mean-spirited
wife Honey (Cynthia Carle, whose
acting suggests she could have given
this role some depth if the script had
encouraged her), yells at the "gooks"
for cutting across his property to
reach their trailer next door and at
Wally for trying to "jew down" hard
working white men like himself.
Shang shows little interest in his kids,
and his resentment at Honey for the

way marriage has entrapped him (he
blames her for getting pregnant and
forcing him to marry her), carries on
a reasonably public affair with Glory
(whose attraction to him is the
movie's biggest puzzle), but when she
befriends Dinh. he resorts to sexual
taunts. Ed Harris plays Shang as a
cartoon, an ornery redneck who actu
ally sashays when he walks; what he
docs on screen is practically comedy,
but maybe there was no other way to
approach this part. The only pass the
movie makes at humanizing Shang is
to throw him a scene — a virtual
replay of sequences from "Country"
and"The River" — in which the
bank refuses to renew the loan that
allows him to keep his boat. (In this
context, the scene seems even
stupider and more fraudulent than it
did in those other pictures.) And once
he's lost the boat, his fury at Dinh,
who has just purchased a small one of
his own, knows no bounds; before
you know it, he's linked up with with
the K.K.K., toting a shotgun and
patrolling the Bay waters.
The shot of Shang and his cronies,
armed and posed like pirates on a
boat with a Vietnamese effigy hang
ing from the yardarm, is truly stun
ning; Louis Malle, after all, is a fine
director. But the movie is a series of
missed opportunities. It contains no
humor, although the encounter be
tween the Asian fishermen and the
local warden ought to be funny. And,
faced with a script as unnuanced as
Arlens, Malle loses his wit and the
irony that glistens in his best pictures
(like the 1981 "Atlantic City"). The
connection between the hometown
racism of men like Shang Pierce and
the values they lived (and survived)
by in the jungles of Vietnam is im
plicit in the repeated references to
"gooks," but the movie is so busy dis
tinguishing Dinh and his friends from
the Viet Cong that it doesn't, finally,
illustrate Milloy's original point: that
what happened in coast towns like
Seadrift, where Billy Joe Aplin died,
and the mythic Fort Alamo, was an
extension of the racial war that sup
posedly ended in 1975. If Malle had
shown the Vietnamese engaged in
guerilla warfare with their white
enemies, "Alamo Bay" might really
' have grappled with something,
despite Arlen's ridiculous script; it
might have been an incendiary movie.
As it is, it bears about as much rela
tion to reality as "Desperately
Seeking Susan."


Every second movie that has
opened in the past few months is a
teen comedy, and none of the
pictures that have received the most
attention from the press of late —
"Blood Simple," "The Breakfast
Club," "Desperately Seeking Susan"
— is about anything, so Louis Malle's
"Alamo Bay," set in coastal Texas
during the influx of Vietnamese be
tween 1979 and 1981, looked like it
might be an oasis in the Hollywood
desert. It's a terrible movie, though,
and the worst thing about it is that,
like "The Cotton Club,"it botches a
great subject that no one else is likely
to attempt for a long time. After the
fall of Saigon, the Vietnamese
flooded into this country, heading for
the Gulf Coast between Florida and
Texas, where many of them figured
on picking up the livelihood they had
practiced at home; fishing. By early
1980, some 320,000 refugees were
engaged in shrimping, crab fishing
and other like pursuits, and in what
Ross Milloy, in his article, "Vietnam
Fallout in a Texas Town," published
in The New York Times Magazine on
April 6, 1980, called "the last pitched
battles of the Vietnam War": an on
going struggle with the Texas fisher
men who believed the Asians were
"raping the waters" and usurping the
limited economic privileges that were
the birthright of Americans.
The issue was a complicated one.
The Coast Texans, many of them vet
erans, were not disposed to look
charitably on new neighbors who

represented a race they had been
trained to regard as the enemy, and
their uneasiness was exacerbated by
the refugees' lack of familiarity with
American customs — like the un
suitability ot firewood for gas stoves
or the inappropriateness of urinating
in the middle of the street. The Tex
ans felt, with some justification, that
the Vietnamese were fishing without
concern for the finite resources of the
Cult Coast waters, and the language
problem made it exasperatingly diffi
cult for wardens to communicate the
rules to these newcomers. But the
most serious conflict was economic
(or at least, the Texans viewed it in
that way). They felt the Asians were
taking the bread out of their mouths
by fishing in areas they themselves
had staked out years before, and that
they were receiving preferential
treatment from the U.S. government,
in addition, in the form of food
stamps. (This was, in fact, a miscon
ception.) Ironically, the refugees, in
their efforts to become successful
Americans, had brought a native in
dustriousness and frugality (bred un
der the treacherous economic condi
tions of their homeland) to bear on
the American free enterprise system,
and were quickly investing in their
own boats and moving ahead at a
greater pace than the Texans them
selves. The result was an adversarial
situation so thickly layered that vio
lence was inevitable.
Milloy's article, which inspired the
screenplay Alice Arlen wrote for
"Alamo Bay," makes it clear that
both camps were strapped in this con
flict, both acted consciously and un
consciously in ways that the other
could only interpret as wanton disre
gard for their rights and needs, and so
both were responsible for the vio
lence. (Milloy writes about the death
of a Texan named Billy Joe Aplin at
the hands of one Sau Van Nguyen,
who was put on trial for murder.
Nguyen's being set free provoked a
series of attacks, largely Ku Klux
Klan-initiated, on the Vietnamese
community in Texas.) Louis Malle,
the great humanist director who gave
us "The Fire Within" and "Phantom
India" and "Lacombe, Lucien,"
seems to have precisely the tempera
ment for a socially and emotionally
complex dramatic situation as this
one, in which individuals on both
sides obey their worst impulses be
cause of the personal and economic
pressures they feel or imagine. In this

month's Vanity Fair, James Atlas, in
terviewing Malle, compares "Alamo
Bay" to "Lacombe, Lucien," which
was also "about what happens to
people when they're caught in the
clutches of history . .. overwhelmed
by events beyond their control... the
K.K.K. vigilantes who terrorize the
Vietnamese . . . aren't just redneck
thugs; what makes them vicious is the
threat to their livelihood. For Malle,
morality isn't absolute; how we be
have depends on how life tests us."
Atlas certainly describes the picture I
wish 1 hud seen when 1 walked into
"Alamo Bay." But "Lacombe,
Lucien," an investigation of how an
imaginatively limited French peasant
boy becomes allied with the Nazis
during the Occupation, came as close
as any movie ever has to entering the
realm of philosphical thought (it was
like filming Hannah Arendt) — and it
was written by Malle and Patrick
Modiano. Alice Arlen, who co
scripted "Silkwood," is not capable of
that kind of intricate, balanced think
ing, apparently. In "Alamo Bay,"
there are only two kinds of people:
heroes (Vietnamese and American
liberals) and villains (rednecks).
The heroic contingent is led by the
young, ambitious Vietnamese fisher
man Dinh (Ho Nguyen, who has
sharp, shrewd eyes), the ailing Wally
(Donald Moffat, in one of his fairly
insufferable lovable-codger perfor
mances), who runs the only shrimp
plant in the town of Port Alamo that
will deal with refugees, and his out
spoken daughter Glory (Amy
Madigan); at the head of the rear
flank is a wise Chicano shrimper
named Luis (Martino LaSalle). Isn't
it a little late in the day for wise
Chicanos? Arlen must have acquired
her notions of liberalism in a high
school civics class where John Stein
beck figured prominently on the re
quired reading list. There is no reason
for Wally and Glory to act as decently
to the Vietnamese as they do, consid
ering that everyone else in town,
practically, appears to be a flag
waving bigot. Glory's iconoclastic
conduct, which includes taking Dinh
along for company when she drives to
nearby Corpus Christi to visit her
father in the hospital, is tacitly ex
plained in terms of her independence
and I-don't-give-a-damn-what
anyone-thinks attitude (and the care
lessly dropped information that she
spent some time in another town
before returning to Port Alamo; in

Corpus Christi, curiously enough, no
one feels the slightest hostility toward
the Vietnamese). But in a town where
xenophobia hangs in the air like the
smell of shrimp, she seems more alien
than the immigrants.
Amy Madigan, who wears her hair
blond here and is finally permitted,
after "Streets of Fire" and "Places in
the Heart," to have a little small
town glamor (she looks like Eva
Marie Saint in some shots), gives a
gutsy performance as Glory; she and
Ry Cooder's theme music are hands
down the best parts of the movie. But
it is only because Malle allows her the
opportunity to take her final scene
farther than the script implies— it's a
first-rate piece of acting, really —
that she isn't defeated by the good
!ibera 1 shackles Arlen has equipped

the role with. Not that Malle's direc
tion can fairly be said to be in conflict
with the screenplay: The final shot is
a freeze frame of Glory's face, with a
postscript superimposed on it that
tells us more than 15,000 Vietnamese
now work off the Gulf Coast — as if
Glory's courage were solely respon
sible for that happy development.
The white population of Port
Alamo, exclusive of Glory's family
and one earnest elementary school
teacher, is the most single-minded
collection of unsavory characters seen
in a movie for many a year. "Alamo

Bay" is like a reversion to those
dreadful, ominous portraits of small
Southern towns that "In the Heat of
the Night" put a blissful end to two
decades ago, only this time the target
of all the bigotry is no longer the
blacks, but the Asians — whom we
recognize to be inherently good, ac
cording to the current Hollywood
iconography, because they say grace
before meals. The Texans, on the
other hand, are represented by a
square-headed sheriff who makes no
effort to activate the arm of the law
when the refugees invoke it, teenage
punks who ride up and down the
streets abusing Asian girls, and grown
men who think nothing of engineer
ing obscene interruptions in the
services at the Vietnamese Catholic
Church.

that kind of intricate, balanced think
ing, apparently. In "Alamo Bay,"
there are only two kinds of people:
heroes (Vietnamese and American
liberals) and villains (rednecks).
The heroic contingent is led by the
young, ambitious Vietnamese fisher
man Dinh (Ho Nguyen, who has
sharp, shrewd eyes), the ailing Wally
(Donald Moffat, in one of his fairly
insufferable lovable-codger perfor
mances), who runs the only shrimp
plant in the town of Port Alamo that
will deal with refugees, and his out
spoken daughter Glory (Amy
Madigan); at the head of the rear
flank is a wise Chicano shrimper
named Luis (Martino LaSalle). Isn't
it a little late in the day for wise
Chicanos? Arlen must have acquired
her notions of liberalism in a high
school civics class where John Stein
beck figured prominently on the re
quired reading list. There is no reason
for Wally and Glory to act as decently
to the Vietnamese as they do, consid
ering that everyone else in town,
practically, appears to be a flag
waving bigot. Glory's iconoclastic
conduct, which includes taking Dinh
along for company when she drives to
nearby Corpus Christi to visit her
father in the hospital, is tacitly ex
plained in terms of her independence
and I-don't-give-a-damn-what
anyone-thinks attitude (and the care
lessly dropped information that she
spent some time in another town
before returning to Port Alamo; in

Corpus Christi, curiously enough, no
one feels the slightest hostility toward
the Vietnamese). But in a town where
xenophobia hangs in the air like the
smell of shrimp, she seems more alien
than the immigrants.
Amy Madigan, who wears her hair
blond here and is finally permitted,
after "Streets of Fire" and "Places in
the Heart," to have a little small
town glamor (she looks like Eva
Marie Saint in some shots), gives a
gutsy performance as Glory; she and
Ry Cooder's theme music are hands
down the best parts of the movie. But
it is only because Malle allows her the
opportunity to take her final scene
farther than the script implies— it's a
first-rate piece of acting, really —
that she isn't defeated by the good
!ibera 1 shackles Arlen has equipped

the role with. Not that Malle's direc
tion can fairly be said to be in conflict
with the screenplay: The final shot is
a freeze frame of Glory's face, with a
postscript superimposed on it that
tells us more than 15,000 Vietnamese
now work off the Gulf Coast — as if
Glory's courage were solely respon
sible for that happy development.
The white population of Port
Alamo, exclusive of Glory's family
and one earnest elementary school
teacher, is the most single-minded
collection of unsavory characters seen
in a movie for many a year. "Alamo

Bay" is like a reversion to those
dreadful, ominous portraits of small
Southern towns that "In the Heat of
the Night" put a blissful end to two
decades ago, only this time the target
of all the bigotry is no longer the
blacks, but the Asians — whom we
recognize to be inherently good, ac
cording to the current Hollywood
iconography, because they say grace
before meals. The Texans, on the
other hand, are represented by a
square-headed sheriff who makes no
effort to activate the arm of the law
when the refugees invoke it, teenage
punks who ride up and down the
streets abusing Asian girls, and grown
men who think nothing of engineer
ing obscene interruptions in the
services at the Vietnamese Catholic
Church.

The leader of the racists — they
tend to refer to the immigrants as
"Vietmanese" — is Shang Pierce (Ed
Harris), a vet who, between bouts of
beating up his equally mean-spirited
wife Honey (Cynthia Carle, whose
acting suggests she could have given
this role some depth if the script had
encouraged her), yells at the "gooks"
for cutting across his property to
reach their trailer next door and at
Wally for trying to "jew down" hard
working white men like himself.
Shang shows little interest in his kids,
and his resentment at Honey for the

way marriage has entrapped him (he
blames her for getting pregnant and
forcing him to marry her), carries on
a reasonably public affair with Glory
(whose attraction to him is the
movie's biggest puzzle), but when she
befriends Dinh. he resorts to sexual
taunts. Ed Harris plays Shang as a
cartoon, an ornery redneck who actu
ally sashays when he walks; what he
docs on screen is practically comedy,
but maybe there was no other way to
approach this part. The only pass the
movie makes at humanizing Shang is
to throw him a scene — a virtual
replay of sequences from "Country"
and"The River" — in which the
bank refuses to renew the loan that
allows him to keep his boat. (In this
context, the scene seems even
stupider and more fraudulent than it
did in those other pictures.) And once
he's lost the boat, his fury at Dinh,
who has just purchased a small one of
his own, knows no bounds; before
you know it, he's linked up with with
the K.K.K., toting a shotgun and
patrolling the Bay waters.
The shot of Shang and his cronies,
armed and posed like pirates on a
boat with a Vietnamese effigy hang
ing from the yardarm, is truly stun
ning; Louis Malle, after all, is a fine
director. But the movie is a series of
missed opportunities. It contains no
humor, although the encounter be
tween the Asian fishermen and the
local warden ought to be funny. And,
faced with a script as unnuanced as
Arlens, Malle loses his wit and the
irony that glistens in his best pictures
(like the 1981 "Atlantic City"). The
connection between the hometown
racism of men like Shang Pierce and
the values they lived (and survived)
by in the jungles of Vietnam is im
plicit in the repeated references to
"gooks," but the movie is so busy dis
tinguishing Dinh and his friends from
the Viet Cong that it doesn't, finally,
illustrate Milloy's original point: that
what happened in coast towns like
Seadrift, where Billy Joe Aplin died,
and the mythic Fort Alamo, was an
extension of the racial war that sup
posedly ended in 1975. If Malle had
shown the Vietnamese engaged in
guerilla warfare with their white
enemies, "Alamo Bay" might really
' have grappled with something,
despite Arlen's ridiculous script; it
might have been an incendiary movie.
As it is, it bears about as much rela
tion to reality as "Desperately
Seeking Susan."


Every second movie that has
opened in the past few months is a
teen comedy, and none of the
pictures that have received the most
attention from the press of late —
"Blood Simple," "The Breakfast
Club," "Desperately Seeking Susan"
— is about anything, so Louis Malle's
"Alamo Bay," set in coastal Texas
during the influx of Vietnamese be
tween 1979 and 1981, looked like it
might be an oasis in the Hollywood
desert. It's a terrible movie, though,
and the worst thing about it is that,
like "The Cotton Club,"it botches a
great subject that no one else is likely
to attempt for a long time. After the
fall of Saigon, the Vietnamese
flooded into this country, heading for
the Gulf Coast between Florida and
Texas, where many of them figured
on picking up the livelihood they had
practiced at home; fishing. By early
1980, some 320,000 refugees were
engaged in shrimping, crab fishing
and other like pursuits, and in what
Ross Milloy, in his article, "Vietnam
Fallout in a Texas Town," published
in The New York Times Magazine on
April 6, 1980, called "the last pitched
battles of the Vietnam War": an on
going struggle with the Texas fisher
men who believed the Asians were
"raping the waters" and usurping the
limited economic privileges that were
the birthright of Americans.
The issue was a complicated one.
The Coast Texans, many of them vet
erans, were not disposed to look
charitably on new neighbors who

represented a race they had been
trained to regard as the enemy, and
their uneasiness was exacerbated by
the refugees' lack of familiarity with
American customs — like the un
suitability ot firewood for gas stoves
or the inappropriateness of urinating
in the middle of the street. The Tex
ans felt, with some justification, that
the Vietnamese were fishing without
concern for the finite resources of the
Cult Coast waters, and the language
problem made it exasperatingly diffi
cult for wardens to communicate the
rules to these newcomers. But the
most serious conflict was economic
(or at least, the Texans viewed it in
that way). They felt the Asians were
taking the bread out of their mouths
by fishing in areas they themselves
had staked out years before, and that
they were receiving preferential
treatment from the U.S. government,
in addition, in the form of food
stamps. (This was, in fact, a miscon
ception.) Ironically, the refugees, in
their efforts to become successful
Americans, had brought a native in
dustriousness and frugality (bred un
der the treacherous economic condi
tions of their homeland) to bear on
the American free enterprise system,
and were quickly investing in their
own boats and moving ahead at a
greater pace than the Texans them
selves. The result was an adversarial
situation so thickly layered that vio
lence was inevitable.
Milloy's article, which inspired the
screenplay Alice Arlen wrote for
"Alamo Bay," makes it clear that
both camps were strapped in this con
flict, both acted consciously and un
consciously in ways that the other
could only interpret as wanton disre
gard for their rights and needs, and so
both were responsible for the vio
lence. (Milloy writes about the death
of a Texan named Billy Joe Aplin at
the hands of one Sau Van Nguyen,
who was put on trial for murder.
Nguyen's being set free provoked a
series of attacks, largely Ku Klux
Klan-initiated, on the Vietnamese
community in Texas.) Louis Malle,
the great humanist director who gave
us "The Fire Within" and "Phantom
India" and "Lacombe, Lucien,"
seems to have precisely the tempera
ment for a socially and emotionally
complex dramatic situation as this
one, in which individuals on both
sides obey their worst impulses be
cause of the personal and economic
pressures they feel or imagine. In this

month's Vanity Fair, James Atlas, in
terviewing Malle, compares "Alamo
Bay" to "Lacombe, Lucien," which
was also "about what happens to
people when they're caught in the
clutches of history . .. overwhelmed
by events beyond their control... the
K.K.K. vigilantes who terrorize the
Vietnamese . . . aren't just redneck
thugs; what makes them vicious is the
threat to their livelihood. For Malle,
morality isn't absolute; how we be
have depends on how life tests us."
Atlas certainly describes the picture I
wish 1 hud seen when 1 walked into
"Alamo Bay." But "Lacombe,
Lucien," an investigation of how an
imaginatively limited French peasant
boy becomes allied with the Nazis
during the Occupation, came as close
as any movie ever has to entering the
realm of philosphical thought (it was
like filming Hannah Arendt) — and it
was written by Malle and Patrick
Modiano. Alice Arlen, who co
scripted "Silkwood," is not capable of
that kind of intricate, balanced think
ing, apparently. In "Alamo Bay,"
there are only two kinds of people:
heroes (Vietnamese and American
liberals) and villains (rednecks).
The heroic contingent is led by the
young, ambitious Vietnamese fisher
man Dinh (Ho Nguyen, who has
sharp, shrewd eyes), the ailing Wally
(Donald Moffat, in one of his fairly
insufferable lovable-codger perfor

flank is a wise Chicano shrimper

it a little late in the day for wise
Chicanos? Arlen must have acquired
her notions of liberalism in a high

beck figured prominently on the re
quired reading list. There is no reason
for Wally and Glory to act as decently

ering that everyone else in town,
