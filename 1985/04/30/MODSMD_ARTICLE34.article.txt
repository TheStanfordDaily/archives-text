# The 						Grateful Dead take Frost by storm
## 
### MARK BABSKI ROBERT MACAULAY 
Balmy weather and the picturesque backdrop provided
by Frost Amphitheatre set the stage for a Grateful Dead
weekend at Stanford. The two afternoon shows, on Satur
day and Sunday, substantiated well the oft-quoted asser
tion: "There is nothing like a Grateful Dead concert."
Many would say that the Dead (as they are called by more
familiar listeners), with their devoted psychedelic follow
ing, and Stanford, hailed as the Pipeline to Yuppiedom,
are not compatible; this weekend, however, there was no
evidence of this incongruity. Stanford students joined
hands with all comers to soak up the rays and to celebrate
the musical talents of Jerry Garcia, Bobby Weir, Phil
Lesh, Brent Mydland, Mickey Hart and Billy
Kreutzmann.
I he first set of the weekend concert show proved to be
very solid. After the customary 15-minute wait, the Dead,
as usual, started off with a bang. It seems as if the band
members can up just by looking at each other. The
choice of the first song, Martha and the Vandellas' 1965
hit, "Dancin in the Streets," was a treat that you don't
hear too often from the Dead.

The next song, "Bertha." is a tradional Dead favorite
and is one of those songs that makes a Dead concert a
Dead concert. "Bertha" gets people swaying to Weir's
nice chords and Lesh's strong bass. This led up to the third
song, a Weir rocker, "Little Red Rooster," featuring both
Weir and Garcia on slide guitar. A little later. Lesh made
a very rare lead vocal appearance on a Dylan song entitled
"Just Like Uncle Tom's Thumb."
After a few more songs, such as the Garcia wailer "Cold
Rain and Snow," the band broke for intermission. Thirty
five people-watching minutes later, the Dead came back
on to continue the experience. "Ramble on Rose," "Eyes
of the World," "The Women are Smarter" and "Goin'
Down the Road" were some of the goodies in a jammin'
second half. The energy kept on going, peaking every so
often as Garcia and company dictated.
Near the end of the concert, the Dead went into over
drive during "Truckin"," their one top-10 hit. The vibra
tions were tangible. Everyone was synchronized and
moving to the music. From then on, the show never
slowed down. Weir was hot during the oldie "Round and
Round," and he never stopped rockin' during the next
song, "One More Saturday Night." If your haven't heard
that song in concert, then you have never heard it. Period.
Albums cannot record the intensity of a live "One More
Saturday Night," especially when Garcia, Lesh and Myd
land provide such fine backround vocals to support Weir's
screamings.
The Dead topped off the very solid Saturday perfor
mance with Garcia singing "Keep Your Day Job." The
Grateful Dead seem to be enjoying working in the after
noon sun; maybe they were hinting that we Stanford stu
dents perhaps don't have it too bad either. In any event,
we certainly could not complain about Saturday afternoon
with the Dead at Frost Amphitheatre.
As good as the Saturday show was (and there was no
disagreement in the audience over the quality of the con
cert), Sunday's show, in the warm haze of the afternoon
sun, seemed to be turned up one notch higher. The Dead
simply exploded out of the blocks with the old Spencer
Davis tune "Gimme Some Lovin'." In the next song, a
fresh and typically slightly raspy Garica made for a hard,
funky "Mississippi Uptown Half-Step Toodooloo." Weir
then had his time, and he spent it nicely, leading the group
thorugh "New Minglewood Blues." That gave Weir a
chance to twang some slide guitar with his hands about
three inches apart from each other.
After "The Bird Song," Mydland got his one lead vocal
song of the weekend. Not skipping a beat, the Dead then
smoked into intermission after playing "China Cat
Sunflower" and the traditional "I Know You, Rider."
The intermission gave the audience a chance to sit down
and enjoy the scenery. As Weir would soon sing, you
"couldn't think of a place more perfect." Frost Amphi
theatre seems especially suited to the type of free-flowing
natural energy that is present at a Grateful Dead concert.

The Dead gently led the audience into Sunday's second
set, which featured a very strong two-part "Playin' in the
Band (which sandwiched "C hina Doll" and a drumming
exhibition by Kreutzmann and Hart). The transitions be
tween the songs here were smooth. On "Wharf Rat,"

Garcia displayed strong, exuberant vocals as well as some
stinging leads on guitar. And as often occurs near the end
of a Dead show, the crowd began to wholeheartedly par
ticipate. Weir led the audience in singing "Ashes, Ashes,"
and then, without pausing, the Dead made the transition
straight into the '50s classic, "Not Fade Awav."
For an encore, the Dead came back and played "U.S.
Blues" before leaving the stage again. However, the fans
were just too lively to be left in that state, so the Dead
came back a second time and brought the crowd gently
and lovingly down with a nice Bob Dylan number. They
finished the concert smiling; Garcia waved to the crowd,
and the band headed home. After the dust had settled
from the second show, it definitely seemed as if there was
a message to be taken home. Maybe Bill Graham, so often
pitted as an adversary of Stanford, put it best when he
kicked off the festival on Saturday. He expressed his
happiness (and urged all present to share this happiness)
over the fact that so many different people, with so many
different interests, could come together to share an after
noon of sun and musical wizardry at the Farm.
There is definitely more to a Grateful Dead show than
good music and tie-died apparel. This becomes immedi
ately evident as the show commences and one is engulfed
by the experience and the energy. If one were to attempt
to consolidate a Dead show into a singular theme, it would
be that of people. People who, to be sure, share an inter
est in down-home, unadulterated rock 'n' roll. But per
haps better, people who enjoy taking part in a tradition
which all began right here some 20 years ago, during a
somewhat more politically and socially tumultuous era.
The times, it seems, have changed immensely. The Dead
and their loyal followers, however, continue to be a force
form the past to be reckoned with, as they follow their
Golden Road to Unlimited Devotion.

were just too lively to be left in that state, so the Dead
came back a second time and brought the crowd gently
and lovingly down with a nice Bob Dylan number. They
finished the concert smiling; Garcia waved to the crowd,
and the band headed home. After the dust had settled
from the second show, it definitely seemed as if there was
a message to be taken home. Maybe Bill Graham, so often
pitted as an adversary of Stanford, put it best when he
kicked off the festival on Saturday. He expressed his
happiness (and urged all present to share this happiness)
over the fact that so many different people, with so many
different interests, could come together to share an after
noon of sun and musical wizardry at the Farm.
There is definitely more to a Grateful Dead show than
good music and tie-died apparel. This becomes immedi
ately evident as the show commences and one is engulfed
by the experience and the energy. If one were to attempt
to consolidate a Dead show into a singular theme, it would
be that of people. People who, to be sure, share an inter
est in down-home, unadulterated rock 'n' roll. But per
haps better, people who enjoy taking part in a tradition
which all began right here some 20 years ago, during a
somewhat more politically and socially tumultuous era.
The times, it seems, have changed immensely. The Dead
and their loyal followers, however, continue to be a force
form the past to be reckoned with, as they follow their
Golden Road to Unlimited Devotion.

Balmy weather and the picturesque backdrop provided
by Frost Amphitheatre set the stage for a Grateful Dead
weekend at Stanford. The two afternoon shows, on Satur
day and Sunday, substantiated well the oft-quoted asser
tion: "There is nothing like a Grateful Dead concert."
Many would say that the Dead (as they are called by more
familiar listeners), with their devoted psychedelic follow
ing, and Stanford, hailed as the Pipeline to Yuppiedom,
are not compatible; this weekend, however, there was no
evidence of this incongruity. Stanford students joined
hands with all comers to soak up the rays and to celebrate
the musical talents of Jerry Garcia, Bobby Weir, Phil
Lesh, Brent Mydland, Mickey Hart and Billy
Kreutzmann.
I he first set of the weekend concert show proved to be
very solid. After the customary 15-minute wait, the Dead,
as usual, started off with a bang. It seems as if the band
members can up just by looking at each other. The
choice of the first song, Martha and the Vandellas' 1965
hit, "Dancin in the Streets," was a treat that you don't
hear too often from the Dead.

The next song, "Bertha." is a tradional Dead favorite
and is one of those songs that makes a Dead concert a
Dead concert. "Bertha" gets people swaying to Weir's
nice chords and Lesh's strong bass. This led up to the third
song, a Weir rocker, "Little Red Rooster," featuring both
Weir and Garcia on slide guitar. A little later. Lesh made
a very rare lead vocal appearance on a Dylan song entitled
"Just Like Uncle Tom's Thumb."
After a few more songs, such as the Garcia wailer "Cold
Rain and Snow," the band broke for intermission. Thirty
five people-watching minutes later, the Dead came back
on to continue the experience. "Ramble on Rose," "Eyes
of the World," "The Women are Smarter" and "Goin'
Down the Road" were some of the goodies in a jammin'
second half. The energy kept on going, peaking every so
often as Garcia and company dictated.
Near the end of the concert, the Dead went into over
drive during "Truckin"," their one top-10 hit. The vibra
tions were tangible. Everyone was synchronized and
moving to the music. From then on, the show never
slowed down. Weir was hot during the oldie "Round and
Round," and he never stopped rockin' during the next
song, "One More Saturday Night." If your haven't heard
that song in concert, then you have never heard it. Period.
Albums cannot record the intensity of a live "One More
Saturday Night," especially when Garcia, Lesh and Myd
land provide such fine backround vocals to support Weir's
screamings.
The Dead topped off the very solid Saturday perfor
mance with Garcia singing "Keep Your Day Job." The
Grateful Dead seem to be enjoying working in the after
noon sun; maybe they were hinting that we Stanford stu
dents perhaps don't have it too bad either. In any event,
we certainly could not complain about Saturday afternoon
with the Dead at Frost Amphitheatre.
As good as the Saturday show was (and there was no
disagreement in the audience over the quality of the con
cert), Sunday's show, in the warm haze of the afternoon
sun, seemed to be turned up one notch higher. The Dead
simply exploded out of the blocks with the old Spencer
Davis tune "Gimme Some Lovin'." In the next song, a
fresh and typically slightly raspy Garica made for a hard,
funky "Mississippi Uptown Half-Step Toodooloo." Weir
then had his time, and he spent it nicely, leading the group
thorugh "New Minglewood Blues." That gave Weir a
chance to twang some slide guitar with his hands about
three inches apart from each other.
After "The Bird Song," Mydland got his one lead vocal
song of the weekend. Not skipping a beat, the Dead then
smoked into intermission after playing "China Cat
Sunflower" and the traditional "I Know You, Rider."
The intermission gave the audience a chance to sit down
and enjoy the scenery. As Weir would soon sing, you
"couldn't think of a place more perfect." Frost Amphi
theatre seems especially suited to the type of free-flowing
natural energy that is present at a Grateful Dead concert.

The Dead gently led the audience into Sunday's second
set, which featured a very strong two-part "Playin' in the
Band (which sandwiched "C hina Doll" and a drumming
exhibition by Kreutzmann and Hart). The transitions be
tween the songs here were smooth. On "Wharf Rat,"

Garcia displayed strong, exuberant vocals as well as some
stinging leads on guitar. And as often occurs near the end
of a Dead show, the crowd began to wholeheartedly par
ticipate. Weir led the audience in singing "Ashes, Ashes,"
and then, without pausing, the Dead made the transition
straight into the '50s classic, "Not Fade Awav."
For an encore, the Dead came back and played "U.S.
Blues" before leaving the stage again. However, the fans
were just too lively to be left in that state, so the Dead
came back a second time and brought the crowd gently
and lovingly down with a nice Bob Dylan number. They
