# 'S.B.M.': a thoroughly entertaining, truthful play
## 
### KARY ANTHOLIS 
"5.8.M." is about the conversations among
seven black men who have formed a support
group. Conversation is often employed for ex
pository puropses, but rarely does it become
the dramatic focus of a play as it is in
"5.8.M." The play works because it turns into
assets the dramatic liabilities of its subject
matter. Rachel Bagby, the black woman
playwrght, has focused on an essentially un
dramatic subject from which she is alienated
by her sex, yet she has created a thoroughly
entertaining play which rings true â€” each of
Eiagby's characters emerges as a unique indi
vidual.
Bagby overcomes the dramatic problems in
a variety of ways. First, she uses as an asset
the undramatic nature of stream of conscious
ness conversation. Her characters do not
change during the one hour rap session. They
simply tell each other where they stand. For
example, Nathaniel is a middle class
womanizer of mixed racial background. At

the end of the play, he remains uncomfortable
with his genetic duality and continues to
pursue five women at the same time. But we
like him, as his friends like him, because we
see his humanity.
Although Nathaniel and his friends do not
develop in this play, our perceptions of them
do. They break out of their stereotypes and
become human beings. We dislike aspects of
each man, but, in the end, we celebrate his ef
forts to deal with his short-comings. By
writing likable characters, Bagby applauds the
efforts of men who seek to communicate with
one another. "5.8.M." reflects her empathy.
The conversations flow with wit and spunk.
Nathaniel, played by John Herbert Niles 111,
finishes a spiel on wanting to date only beauti
ful, stylish women. Akil, a sensitive pre-law
student, says with sincerity, "Nathaniel, that's
so empty." We join the actors in laughter. We
have been shown our own hypocrisy by some
one who recognizes his own guilt. We laugh at
our inadequacies, but we have also been

forced to remember them.
Baby's play has more than engaging wit to
entertain us. "5.8.M." is exciting aurally and
visually. The music b\ Jacob Schlicter ranges
from searing to funky. Halifu Osumare's
dance sequences, performed by the seven
men and by Rashida Bashir, range from in
tensely dramatic to infectious. Director James
Cadena brings it all together by getting solid
performances by most of his actors.
Jonathan Turk is excellent as Marcus, the
militant organizer. His voice has a measured
cadence which captures Marcus' cool-headed
"grub or be grubbed" attitude. Stephen Ran
dall also gives an outstanding performance.
Randall's good-natured presence makes
smooth-talking Leon a likeable character in
spite of his cocky maschismo.
"What," you may ask, "does 'S.B.M.'

Program Center. "5.8.M." will be performed
