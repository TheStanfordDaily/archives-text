# 'At the Feet of the Moon' marred by uninteresting sound
## Parachute Club has potential 
### ANDREW CROWELL 
It is a shame when potentially good
lyrics fail to have any real impact be
cause of poor vocals or because the
words are obscured in a sea of plain
and uninteresting music. Here lies the
primary downfall of the Parachute
Club's latest album, "At the Feet of
the Moon."
While the group has not yet experi
enced much success in the United
States, the Toronto-based septet has
achieved a significant amount of sup
port in Canada. With two Juno
Awards (the Canadian equivalent of
the Grammy), five Black Music
Awards, a " Most Promising Group of

the Year" acclamation and two gold
albums to its name, the Parachute
Club can hardly be called a group of
unknowns. The single "Rise Up"
from their debut LP was even selec
ted as "No. 1 Canadian Single" in
RPM Magazine's music poll.
So why hasn't the Club caught on
in the United States?
1 think the problem lies in its plain
and predictable music. The band
claims to be "'trying to synthesize and
integrate musical influences from
around the world." To be honest,
save four short and slightly innovative
sections, all I could hear was a
healthy dose of pop and techno-pop.
The saving grace of the album (if

you can call it that) is the creative
lyrical content. While not all the
songs are poetic wonders, a few of the
tracks were surprisingly thought
provoking. "Equal/Equality"
presents the problem of prejudice
and a plea for equality among all men
in a rather fresh manner. A few ex
cerpts from Gert Beadle's poetry add
some additional depth to the verse.
"Middle Child" effectively develops
the ever-popular "live in bal
ance/moderation" theme with an
added twist that questions the ex
tremist nature of peoples'
beliefs/values as well. The necessity
for change is immediately echoed in
"Act of Innocent." "There's a larger

vision / Bigger than me and
you / Let's think about tomor
row / Call it an act of faith / No fear
of rejection / It's a matter of atti
tude." A final call for unity is chanted
in "Walls and Laws." Unfortunately,
it is really more fun to read these
words than it is to hear them on
record; the value of the images is
really lost in the dull music.
Though I feel quite confident in
saying that "At the Feet of the
Moon" will not get much airplay in
the United States, if the Parachute
Club can come up with a new and dif
ferent sound to accompany its lyrics,
it could gather a much larger follow-
