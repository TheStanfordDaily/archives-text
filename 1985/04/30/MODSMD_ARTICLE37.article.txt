## Stanford grad student speaks on heated theology debate 
### WILLIAM PENNEY 
Citing "the economic and political oppresion which the
majority of Latin Americans are under," a Stanford
graduate student from Chile said yesterday that "Latin
America has become the catalyst" of a religious concept
that links theology with relief to the poor.
Francisco Tomic, a graduate student in education and
civil engineering, outlined the current debate over Libera
tion Theology â€” whether religion can work to alleviate
the problems of the poor and oppressed. Tomic then gave
his personal endorsement of the theology and answered
questions from the audience of about 40 people at the
Bechtel International Center.
According to Tomic, modern Liberation Theology has
roots in the 1965 Second Vatican Council and serves as a
re-evaluation of "how the commitment in life of Jesus'
word transforms itself when it is based on solidarity and
defense of the poor." Liberation Theology "is the trans
formation of an abstract notion of theology into some sort
of practice," he said.
Tomic qualified the theology's Marxist elements as
being a way to "put it into practice." According to Tomic,
ideology "is used (by Liberation Theologists) to uncover
the actual hesitation of the church or the state to involve
itself in a practical commitment to the defense of the
poor." He added that "this use of ideology would enor
mously surprise Marx," who thought that ideology "was

used as a main arm of bourgeois society to deny the con
flict between classes."
The theology's Marxist characteristics are those which
"refuse to accept the situation as it is," and"the concept
that man is a free-agent who controls his own destiny and
should not postpone it to another life," Tomic said.
Tomic was born in Chile and lived there during the
1973 military coup led by Maj. Gen. Augusto Pinochet,
who continues to rule the country. Tomic described the
coup as "the downfall of democracy and its substitution by
a very extremist right-wing military dictatorship." He
added that the coup "imposed questions and circum
stances with which people hadn't had to deal with before
in terms of a commitment of a Catholic to the poor, op
pressed and the repressed."
In describing the debate within the Catholic Church
over the relationship between theology and the affairs of
the oppressed. Tomic warned of "oversimplification." He
paraphrased the version of the debate he has seen in Time
magazine as "simplistic" and one in which "the pope is
being challenged by a radical theology and is somehow to
defend himself and the church as an institution in front of
a certain Marxist-Communist threat."
Yesterday's discussion was the third in the International
Perspectives on Peace and the Role of Religion series pre
sented every Monday this quarter by members of Stan
ford's international communitv.
