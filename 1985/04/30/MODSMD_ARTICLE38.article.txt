Blasts rock mining firms
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Two explos
ions shattered windows and blew out doors early today
at the office headquarters of two mining companies
that fired a total of 17,500 black gold miners over the
weekend.
Police said the explosions occurred moments apart
at the downtown ottices of Anglo American Corp. and
Anglovaal Ltd. No injuries were reported.
I here was no immediate claim of responsibility for

the explosions, and police said they had not deter
mined what caused them. The outlawed African Na
tional Congress guerrilla movement periodically
bombs offices and installations of the white minority
government, but it rarely attacks private businesses.
Yesterday evening, a few hours before the explos
ions. the black miners' union said Anglo American had
agreed to reinstate the 14,500 miners fired over the
weekend for holding an illegal strike at Vaal Reef, the
world's largest gold mine.
Also yesterday, police said six more blacks were
killed in rioting around the nation, and a government
minister said black radicals were encouraging unrest
among the 22 million blacks to make the country
"uncontrollable and ungovernable"' by the 5 million
whites.
Panel OKs apartheid bill
SACRAMENTO — An Assembly committee voted
yesterday to prohibit future state pension fund invest
ments in the 350 American firms that do business in
South Africa.
"U.S. investments maintain the apartheid system by
providing South Africa with much of the capital
needed to maintain the economy and make sure whites
enjoy a high standard of living." Assemblywoman
Maxine Waters (D-l.os Angeles) told the Public In
vestments, Finance and Bonded Indebtedness Com
mittee.
The committee voted 7-5 to sent her ABI 134 to the
Ways and Means Committee.
But, lacking the votes, she dropped her related bill,
which would have required the state pension funds to
sell off their current holdings in firms with South
African investments.
The successful bill would prohibit pension funds
from the $25 billion Public Employees Retirement
System and the $13 billion State Teachers Retirement
System from being invested in stocks or bonds of firms
doing business in South Africa.
An amendment added yesterday at the suggestion of
the committee chairman. Assemblyman Richard Rob
inson (D-Garden Grove) would also hold up the $80
million the state contributes to the University of Cali
fornia retirement system unless the UC regents begin
to sell off UCs $1.8 billion in South Africa invest
ments.
