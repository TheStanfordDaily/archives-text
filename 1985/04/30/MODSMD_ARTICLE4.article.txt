# 20 arrests at Dead show
## 
### DAVID S. GOLDSTEIN Staff writer 
While concert organizers say the two Grateful Dead
shows on campus this weekend went "almost disgustingly
well," Stanford police offer a slightly different review.
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said law-breaking at the
Frost Amphitheatre concerts was worse than expected.
There were 20 arrests over the two-day period â€” two for
fence-jumping and 18 on drug-related charges, Niemeyer
said.
"If we had plainclothes officers working, it would have
been more like 100 arrests," he said.
Nevertheless, Suzanne Becker, a Tresidder Union pro
gram coordinator who helped plan the concerts, said the
police "were great" and the shows were a success.
"It went almost disgustingly well," said Becker, who at
tended both concerts.
Nanci Howe, assistant director of Tresidder and a mem
ber of the Concert Advisory Board, said, "Things went
reasonably well." She noted that although arrests did oc
cur, no violence or vandalism was reported.
Howe praised the Stanford Concert Network, which she
supervises, for its organizing efforts, and said promoter

Bill Graham Presents ably handled non-police security.
Graham supplied about 100 security employees, she said.
A capacity crowd of 9,500 filled Frost Amphitheatre
both days. About 2,500 tickets were sold to Stanford stu
dents, Howe said.
When the Grateful Dead played Frost in 1983, police
made 14 drug-related arrests. Concert Network member
Aaron Persky calls that statistic "the tip of the iceberg" in
the University's August 1983 decision to impose an eight
month moratorium on campus concerts.
But Persky maintains the University's main rationale
for the ban can be traced to a chaotic "free market"
booking system. Most problems were solved earlier this
year when concert bookings were centralized under the
auspices of the Concert Network, Persky said. The Uni
versity officially lifted the moratorium a year ago.
Asked whether the Concert Network would reap a
profit from the concerts, Persky said revenue and expense
figures will be released in about two weeks.
Persky said he hopes Grateful Dead concerts become
an ann al campus event. Meanwhile, he said, the Concert
Network has slated a May 18 concert of Shadow Fax, Mi
chael Hedges and Will Ackerman, three jazz acts.
