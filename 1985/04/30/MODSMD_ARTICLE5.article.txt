In its ongoing bid to persuade
the University to sell its stock in cor
porations that do business in South
Africa, five campus anti-apartheid
activists will meet today with Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy and
tomorrow with "seven or eight"
members of the Stanford Board of
Trustees.
The meeting with Kennedy, slated
for 4 p.m. in his office, will concern
plans for a public forum on total
divestment, according to Steve Phil
lips, one of the organizers of Stanford
Out of South Africa (SOSA), an
umbrella alliance of various progres
sive groups.
Phillips said last night he expects
"thousands" to participate in the
forum, which, he said, might be held
in Maples Pavilion sometime next
week. A similar forum drew more
than 7,000 people to UC-Berkeley's
Harmon Gym last week.
The forum would include students,
faculty, staff and trustees discussing
"strategy for divestment," according
to a SOSA list of demands.
At tomorrow's meeting, the five
members of SOSA's liaison commit
tee will attempt to convince the trus
tees in attendance that divestment is
the most effective means of stopping
oppression in South Africa. They will
urge the trustees to vote for divest
ment at their May 14 meeting, Phil
lips said.
But William Massy, vice president
for business and finance, said the
divestment issue is scheduled as a
"report and discussion item" at the
May meeting, "not as action."
"It often takes more than one
meeting for an item this controver
sial," Massy said last night, indicating
it may be several months— if at all —
before a full trustee vote is taken on
the subject.
In a statement released yesterday,
SOSA officials pointed to the two
meetings as an example of the Uni
versity's "complying with there

quests of student negotiators," who
have requested such meetings in lists
of demands to the administration.
Massy said yesterday that although
the meetings may he the popular
thing to do, "I don't see us buckling
under."
Stanford's portfolio includes 91
corporations that do business in
South Africa, according to University
Treasurer Rodney Adams, who said
it would be difficult to put a dollar
figure on these investments. SOSA
maintains that these holdings amount
to $215 million.
In addition to Phillips, members of
the SOSA liaison committee who will
participate in the two meetings are
David Troutt, Joel Bellenson, Alice
Stauffer and Louis Edozien.
Phillips said SOSA officials can
celed a 1 p.m. meeting with Massy
today because "we didn't see the
utility of it." SOSA members had
planned to ask Massy again for a full
disclosure of his personal portfolio in
order to determine any potential con
flicts of interest that may affect his
decision-making. SOSA is demand
ing such disclosures from all the trus
tees as well.
Massy reiterated last night that Ije
would not open his portfolio to public
scrutiny because it would set a pre
cedent that would pressure trustees to
do the same. He said such a request is
"inappropriate" and "an invasion of
privacy."
Meanwhile, SOSA officials decided
to alter their method of protest from
"sit-in" to "vigil." Under the
revamped plan, Phillips said he ex
pects at least 20 people to remain
outside Kennedy's office in Building
10 of the Inner Quad at all times until
the May 14 meeting.
"We're scaling it down to a vigil
level so we can re-allocate our re
sources," Phillips said.
In other action, Todd Ramming, a
member of SOSA, presented a repre
sentative of the anti-apartheid protest
at Berkeley with a petition of
solidarity signed by 2,000 members
of the Stanford community, including
100 faculty members and Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons, accord
ing to Ramming.
