# Anesthetic blamed for student's death

### SHIRISH DATE Senior staff writer 
A freshman who died in his room
the last day of spring break ap
parently inhaled an anesthetic com
monly used in the Psychology De
partment laboratory at which he
worked.
An official from the Santa Clara
County coroner's office said yester
day that Michael Bandy died from
Halothane poisoning, according to
The Associated Press. His death is
now listed as a "probable accident."
Bandy, who was found dead in his
Larkin House room April 1. worked
in Psychology Prof. Karl Pribram's
laboratory, where he had access to
Halothane. Pribram is out of town
and could not be reached for com
ment yesterday.
Earlier this month. Stanford police
officials said they had no idea how
Bandy died, but ruled out foul play
and suicide.
But yesterday, Bruce Rosenstock.
the resident fellow at Larkin, said a
bottle containing Halothane was
found in Bandy's room, and the
coroner suspected an overdose at that
time. "The coroner seemed to suggest
he sniffed it directly out of the bot
tle." Rosenstock said.
Anesthesia Prof. John Bunker said
it was unlikely the medical examiner
could have found Halothane's pres
ence had he had not been looking for
it. James Trudell, associate professor
of anesthesia, said that "routine''
tests would not have detected
Halothane, forcing the use of more
"sophisticated" tests.
Like "all of the anesthetics.

Halothane is "subject to drug abuse,"
Bunker said. "It's possible he was
trying to get a high off of this [or
using it) as a means of suicide," he
said.
Rosenstock, an assistant classics
professor, said suicide was "most
unlikely." He said Bandy had bought
food for the next day, as well as books
and notepaper for the upcoming
quarter, indications that "rule out
suicide."
Trudell said Halothane creates a
"high" similar to "intoxication" from
alcohol. He said he thought it more
likely that Bandy died from a possible
side effect of Halothane — such as a
cardiac arrest or respiratory failure —
rather than the direct toxic effect of
the anesthetic.
Bunker also suggested that Bandy
may have died from cardiac arrhyth
mia. a condition where the heart's
electrical system is disrupted, as a
result of Halothane inhalation.
Rosenstock said lie had no idea if
Bandy used Halothane recreation
ally. "Neither I nor any of the stu
dents who were his friends knew he
had the drug in his possession," lie
said. "It wasn't something he shared
with [his friends] if he used it on a
regular basis."
Rosenstock said he thought it likely
Bandy's work at a veterinary clinic in
Tulare last summer and the psychol
ogy laboratory here gave him the
knowledge of the anesthetic's use.
"His experience . . . made him think
he knew what he was doing." he said.
"I wish I knew what might have
motivated him into risking his life."
