# Graduation plans go on

### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Staff writer 
The arrangements for Stanford's 94th Com
mencement are nearing completion, according to
Nan Bentley, assistant director of University
Events and Services.
In a major departure from past precedent, the
June 17 ceremony will be held in Stanford
Stadium, and various University departments
have been working feverishly to design a new
stage and decorations for the event.
Despite some trepidation, both Bentley and
Kathy Ko, one of four senior class presidents,
said the main advantage of the stadium site is its
size.
"People aren't really sold on the stadium vet,"
Ko said, "but pure logistics point directly to the
stadium."
"Everything (has been) very carefully designed
to make a lovely presentation." Bentley added.
"Graduation will be more dramatic than before,
and (now) everyone will be able to see it."
Ihe numerous logistical changes have occu
pied Bentley's time since the change was made.
"Everything has to be rethought." Bentley
said. "It has really changed everything."
I his is not the first time the stadium has hosted
graduation exercises. Bentley said. President
Hoover spoke to an overflow crowd at the 1935
Commencement.
Bentlv said the design of a completely new
stage to be constructed inside the stadium was a
major concern.
Asst. Art Professor Greg Lynch designed the
new stage as well as the flags that will decorate
the stadium and departmental graduation sites.
The 150-foot-long stage has a capacity of 500
and will seat faculty, trustees, deans, academic
officers and the graduation speakers. Stage con
struction will beuin four or five days before Com
mencement. Bentlv said.

Lynch, an expert in graphic design, said the
design was "not a mere attempt to decorate the
stadium, but to transfer it to a festival or celebra
tion."
"The design uses the stage to create a pavilion
area, the focus of the activity," Lynch said.
The light-toned stage will be made of scaffold
ing and cloth material and will maintain "a sub
stantial architectural feel" together with "the es
sence of California merged with institutional
tradition," Lynch said.
Lynch said the seating on the reusable stage
will be angled "to reinforce the visual lines" and
will complement the arrangement of the under
graduates. who will be seated on the track.
The design and placement of the banners is
considered an especially important part of creat

ing a "pleasing" atmosphere inside the stadium,
Bently said.
Lynch said hundreds of multi-colored banners
will he laid in a grid pattern in the stands behind
the stage, creating the idea of "flying colors and
ceremony."
"I envisioned the idea of the procession and
the ceremony, and the banner idea fit in well in
such a large scale," Lynch said.
The design of the banner is a thematic adapta
tion of the University flag, symbolic of the "new
growth" on a redwood tree. Lynch said.
"Visually, I modified it so it would stand out
on the larger scale." Lynch said. "The banners
will add a softer 'edge' to diffuse the intensity of
the stage area."

This year, Stanford graduates will celebrate Commencement in Stanford Stadium for the
first time in 50 years. Here the class of 1935 is shown during its Commencement ceremony.
Lynch added that the banners were
"a thread of continuity to unify the
various areas and activities" through
out that week.
" These same banners can be used
as a visual device through the entire
campus," Lynch said.
Lynch also incorporated the

procession into his design concept,
noting that the colors of the faculty
and student robes will "augment the
clear, pure color of the stage."
"The procession within the stadium
itself will (now) become much more
visible," I.ynch said.
Lynch said scale models of the
stage and the entire stadium are on
display at Tresiddcr.
Bentley said graduates will be able
to get unlimited tickets for the 9:30

a.m. ceremony between May 28 and
30 at the Tresiddcr Ticket Office.
"We want to make sure that par
ents get preferential seating," Bentley
said. Bentley estimated the crowd to
number about 35,000, chiefly be
cause of the notoriety of the com
mencement speaker, New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo.
Admission tickets for the general
public will be availible after June 10.
All tickets will be for unreserved
seating.
