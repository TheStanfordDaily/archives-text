Israeli forces withdraw from Tyre
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Israeli soldiers pulled out of Tyre yesterday,
and heavy fighting broke out when Moslem militiamen attacked Chris
tian forces corralled in a mountain enclave in south Lebanon.
In Beirut, Moslem and Christian gunmen skirmished in the center of
the city after night-long street battles. Rival Christian leaders convened
an emergency session in east Beirut in an effort to close ranks against
what they consider a Moslem threat to Lebanon's Christians.
The Israeli withdrawal from the ancient Phoenician port of Tyre, the
last major city Israel had occupied since 1982, completed the second
phase of the pullback that is to be completed in early June.
Thousands of jubilant citizens poured into the streets of Tyre, dancing
and singing, as the last Israeli convoy of tanks and trucks left the city.
They showered each other with rice and rose petals, hugging and kis
sing, in an explosion of joy at the end of 34 months of Israeli occupation.
Trucks and cars, young men and women clinging to the sides, clogged
the streets. People sang and shouted from balconies and rooftops.
The Israelis, too, were happy to leave after getting bogged down in the
army's longest single campaign since the Jewish state was founded in
1948. Israel lost 648 soldiers killed in Lebanon, many slain by Shiite
Moslem guerrillas and suicide car bombers.
At the border, the returning Israelis, throwing canisters of colored
smoke, drenched a welcoming crowd with champagne and stuck carna
tions in the barrels of their guns to celebrate the withdrawal.
But shortly after the Israelis pulled back, Moslem militiamen un
leashed an artillery barrage against the mainly Christian South Lebanon
Army, which is supported by Israel.
The South Lebanon Army, dug in around Kfar Falous about 10 miles
west of their Chouf Mountain stronghold in Jezzine, replied with ar
tillery fire, according to telephoned reports from the south.
France seeks new monetary system
PARIS — Days before a Western economic summit, President Fran
cois Mitterand has announced France will refuse to discuss new interna
tional trade agreements without parallel talks on a new world monetary
system.
Mitterand's statement reflected widespread concern over the beating
that European currencies have taken in recent months against the dollar,
which has been buoyed by high U.S. interest rates.
"It is not possible for us to accept negotiations on commercial affairs if
on the other hand there is a refusal to engage in conversations on cur
rency," Mitterrand said in a live TV interview Sunday.
President Reagan departs today for the West German capital Bonn,
where the summit will be held Friday and Saturday. Also participating
are the leaders of Canada, Japan, West Germany, Britain and Italy.
The seven nations, the world's largest industrial democracies, are cur
rently enjoying the third year of an economic upturn, but their concerns
about the future, and their strategies, vary.
Mitterand's statement was in line with general French economic strat
egy, a strategy generally opposed by Washington, but this was the first
time he had publicly and explicitly linked trade and monetary talks.
On the world economic front, France is pressing for a radical revision
in the way international currencies are valued against each other. The
French essentially want to create three monetary zones: the dollar, the
yen and the major West European currencies, with built-in mechanisms
to prevent wide fluctuations between those zones.
That would replace the system of floating exchange rates.
The United States, as it made clear at a recent meeting of the Organi
zation for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris, is only
willing to consider looking at some studies which would alter, but not
dramatically change, the current exchange system.
Instead, Washington has indicated it will press its partners at the Bonn
summit for a specific date early next year to expand and modify the cur
rent General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), a series of
guidelines for world trade.
The Americans want to roll back current protectionist measures,
postpone others now planned and bring trade in high technology under
the GATT guidelines.
The French, who see themselves as the champions of the developing
nations in these matters, say the developed world should first abandon
protectionist measures against Third World exports if it is serious about
dismantling barriers to free trade.
They also say that the current, volatile international monetary system
hurts the world's poorest nations the most, adding to their massive debt
burdens and preventing any attempts at long-range economic planning.
The complexity of the issues assures that a mere two days of talks
among the seven leaders will produce no solutions, but it will be another
step on the way toward agreement among the heads of state that the eco
nomic problems facing each separate country are a shared problem of all
the countries.
Shamir urges Bitburg cancellation
TEL AVIV, Israel — Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Sunday
urged President Reagan to cancel his planned visit to a West German
cemetery that contains the bodies of 49 SS troopers and thousands of
German soldiers.
It was the first time a senior Israeli government official has publicly
criticized Reagan's scheduled stop at the Bitburg cemetery during his
May 1-6 visit to West Germany.
Shamir's comments, made to a group of Jewish immigrants, were
given to reporters by his spokesman.
He quoted the foreign minister as saying Reagan "had gotten himself
embroiled in this complication due to unwise counsel" and he hoped the
president's "mistake and misunderstanding" could be rectified.
"We were hurt by this mistake, but by saying this and thinking this we
do not forget all that the United States has done and is doing for us,"
Shamir said.
Reagan scheduled the visit to the cemetery as a gesture of reconcilia
tion on the 40th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany. But the
presence of graves of troopers of the SS, the elite organization that was
responsibile for guarding Nazi death camps, has stirred impassioned
protests against the visit.
Fall of Saigon is commemorated
HO CHI MINH CITY. Vietnam — Ho Chi Minh City will celebrate
the 10th anniversary of the fall of the South Vietnamese capital with a
six-mile victory parade to the former presidential palace.
Some of Vietnam's top leaders, many of them "founding revolutionar
ies," were attending the ceremonies. They include Le Due Tho, who
shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Henry Kissinger, then President
Nixon's national security adviser, for formulating the 1973 accord that
ended direct U.S. military involvement in Vietnam.
Officials say delegations from a dozen nations are in Ho Chi Minh
City, but no major foreign government figures are present.
Also on hand are nearly 200 foreign journalists, many of them
Americans. Two U.S. television networks are broadcasting live from Ho
Chi Minh City.
The Vietnamese say they invited Jane Fonda, Cora Weiss, Dr. Ben
jamin Spock and several other American antiwar activists, but the only
prominent figure to arrive is David Dellinger. He made four trips to
Hanoi and was one of the "Chicago 7" tried for antiwar activities.
Dellinger said his invitation came at the last moment, which he said
might explain the absence of some of the others. He added: "The focus
of the antiwar movement is now Central America.'
Ten years ago to day, a North Vietnamese tank smashed through the
gate of the palace, where South Vietnam's unconditional surrender was
formalized.
At 7:32 a.m. Saigon time on that day.the last American helicopter
lifted off with the last of the 7,000 Americans and South Vietnamese
snatched from the panicked city.
North Vietnam and its southern arm. the Viet Cong, had reunited the
country under the red banner.
The decades-long battle, first against the French and then against the
United States and South Vietnam, left millions dead, maimed, homeless
and orphaned.
