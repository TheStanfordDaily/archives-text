MOSCOW — Soviet leader Mik
hail Gorbachev promised Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega assistance
on urgent economic problems yester
day. But the Kremlin did not publicly
say if it would give Ortega the emer
gency cash he reportedly wants.
Official Soviet reports on the
meeting also did not mention military
aid to Nicaragua, in keeping with the
Kremlin's usual secrecy on such ques
tions.
The reports focused instead on So
viet and Nicaraguan complaints about
U.S. policy in Latin America, accus
ing the Reagan administration of
turning the region "into a dangerous
seat of tension."
The United States accuses the San
dinistas of imposing a Marxist dic
tatorship on Nicaragua. A Reagan
administation request for $14 million
to aid rebels fighting the Sandinistas
was rejected by the House of Repre

sentatives last week.
A Nicaraguan source, who spoke
on condition he not be identified, has
said Ortega came to Moscow seeking
$200 million in emergency cash to
counter U.S. economic sanctions
imposed over the past four years and
pay to for food and other necessities.
Reports from the official Soviet
news agency Tass did not say whether
any Soviet loans or grants were
agreed to during Ortega's Kremlin
meeting with Gorbachev. The Soviet
Union rarely provides specifics on
such programs.
The Soviet news agency said
Nicaraguan and Soviet officials
signed an agreement to set up a trade
and economic cooperation panel that
"to improve the coordination of
bilateral cooperation in the economy
and broaden its field."
Tass did not provide any specifics
on the agreement.
