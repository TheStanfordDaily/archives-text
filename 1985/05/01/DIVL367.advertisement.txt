I NOTICE TO
THE STANFORD COMMUNITY
I FROM THE
I STUDENT CONDUCT
I LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
Effective ten days from the date of this publication,
three sections of the Honor Code "Interpretations and
Applications" will be amended to read as follows:
2.(b) "Proctoring"
Proctoring means being present in the examination room during a written
examination, with the following exceptions: 1) The prohibition against proctoring
should not be construed to prohibit an instructor or teaching assistant from remaining
in the examination room for the first few minutes to distribute and explain the
examination; or from visiting the examination room briefly to transmit additional
information; or from returning at the end of the examination to collect the examination
papers. 2) Nor does the prohibition against proctoring prohibit an instructor or
teaching assistant from visiting the examination room in response to specific prior
reports from students that cheating has been observed, in connection with that exam,
to investigate the basis for such reports. The instructor or teaching assistant may also
visit the examination room briefly and infrequently in order to answer students'
questions.
2.(d) "Procedures that create temptations to violate the Honor Code"
(current text with proposed addition highlighted)
. . . Examples of undesirable procedures include the following: failure to give clear
directions and instructions concerning course requirements AND THE LIMITS OF
ACCEPTABLE COLLABORATION IN COURSEWORK; treating required work
casually....
2.(e) "Penalty grading"
Under the Legislative and Judicial Charter, students are not to be penalized for
violations of the Honor Code without notice, hearing, and adjudication, as therein
provided. An instructor may not, therefore, lower a student's grade or impose any • .
other academic penalty on the grounds of dishonesty in the absence of such formal
proceedings.
Over the summer,. the brochure "Regulations Governing Student Conduct
and Procedures for Their Enforcement" will be revised to reflect these
changes. In the meantime, please note that sections 2.(b), 2.(d), and 2.(e), on pages
2-3 of the brochures, have been replaced by the above statements.
