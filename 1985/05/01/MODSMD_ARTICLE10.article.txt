# Reagan embarks on European trip
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President
Reagan, carrying a message of
"peace and reconciliation among
old adversaries," set out yesterday
for Europe and an economic sum
mit already overshadowed by his
planned trip to a German military
cemetery where Nazi SS troops
are buried.
In departure remarks at the
White House, en route to
Andrews Air Force Base and a
trans-Atlantic flight on Air Force
One, Reagan said: "We leave
tonight for a Europe rebuilt from
the disaster of war and morally
restored from the despair of
1945."
"We visit Europe, determined
to carry forward the spirit of peace
and reconciliation among old ad
versaries and the power of our
democratic ideals." the president
said.
"The friendship between the
American and German peoples —
a great blessing that has grown
rich and strong over our three cen
turies of shared national experi
ence — is dramatic proof of how
former enemies can be brought to
gether again." he added.
Trying to soften the heavy
criticism Reagan has encountered.
Secretary of State George Shultz
earlier yesterday had called
Reagan's visit to the Bitburg cem
etery a "great act of reconcilia

tion" with a World War II enemy
that now is a close ally.
"When you do something that's
really hard to do, it may very well
take on a deeper meaning than if
you make some statements about
reconciliation that, in a sense,
don't cost you anything," Shultz
told reporters in a briefing before
Reagan's departure for Bonn,
West Germany.
"Reconciliation does not mean
understanding of the things that
took place," Shultz insisted.
"Personally, I find it impossible to
understand how human beings
could do the things that we know
took place."
He added, "The importance of
the notion of reconciliation is
ironically brought forward in a
way by the reaction. It shows how
deep these wounds are and how
difficult it is. . . . We have to con
front that as well as confront the
horrors that we all are reacting
to."
After an overnight flight from
Washington, Reagan will spend all
day today resting at Schloss Gym
nich, a castle 25 miles outside
Bonn that will be his home for five
nights.
Concerned- about possible ter
rorist attacks by left-wing groups,
West German officials have
mobilized the largest security
force in Bonn's history.
