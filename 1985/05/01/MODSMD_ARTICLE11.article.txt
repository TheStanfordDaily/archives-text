House kills election
WASHINGTON —. A deeply divided House
squashed a Republican attempt yesterday to call
for a special election to settle the bitter dispute
over an Indiana seat.
The House voted 229-200 against a Republi
can motion to declare the Bth District seat vacant
so Indiana's governor can schedule a special elec
tion.
The Republicans, who garnered 19 votes from
Democratic defectors, threatened a "mass exo
dus" if the Democrats seat incumbent Frank Vlc-
Closkey on the basis of a four-vote recount vic
tory over Republican Richard Mclntyre.
"I very much regret the outcome turns upon
only four votes." said Majority Leader James
Wright (D-Texas.) "In the years I've been in
Congress I've never known anything to create
such a degree of emotionalism."
Wright declared: "We're not so hard up for an
extra seat in the House that we would want to
deprive somebody by theft."
But Rep. Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.) said the task
force that conducted the recount "repudiated the
laws of the state, wrote its own election laws,
conducted a count until it found enough votes for

its man to win" and then stopped counting.
Frenzel urged Democrats to "take the poison
out of the shallow well" by agreeing to a special
election. "Let representative government work
and let the people decide," he said.
Astronauts face spills
SPACE CENTER. Houston — Two waves of
foul-smelling rodent food and animal feces
flooded into Challenger's weightless laboratory
yesterday when an astronaut attempted to feed
some of the 24 rats and two monkeys carried in
cages aboard the science module.
"There was a flood of partially eaten crumbles
of pellets, of feces, bits of feces that were floating
free." reported astronaut Dr. Bill Thornton after
he attempted to feed one rat.
Thornton reported earlier a similar "cloud" of
smelly particles escaped from another cage.
The food and feces spill added to the problems
of Spacelab 3. Two experiments already are dis
abled. including one that added an odor problem
of its own — from spilled urine in the shuttle's
main cabin.
Still, the astronauts managed to crank up seven

scientific studies and an expert said "a lot of good
things are happening" on the mission.
The monkeys and rats, test subjects in the
Spacelab 3 module in Discovery's cargo bav. ap
peared to be enjoying the experience and all
seemed healthy, officials said. A television view
showed one monkey slowly spinning in weight
lessness while he looked out a window of his
cage.
The astronauts grew crystals, sampled the
Earth's atmosphere, tested a method of controll
ing space sickness with thought and took pictures
of dramatic natural lights flaring over the planet's
poles.
Market slumps again
The stock market recorded its third straight
loss yesterday, faced with fresh evidence of
slowing economic growth.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
dropped 1.66 to 1.258.06. bringing its decline
since last Thursday's close to 26.72 points.
\ olume on the New York Stock Exchange
stepped up to 111.81 million shares from 88.86
million Mondav.
