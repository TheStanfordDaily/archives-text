tions at UC-Berkeley. and about 200 marched on

protest ended.

regents withdraw $2.4 billion worth of invest
ments in 35 companies doing business in South

lion worth of investments in companies doing
business in South Africa, said chief investment
officer DeWitt Bowman.
Among the more than 100 companies targeted

Feinstein and the board of supervisors, as well as
San Francisco voters who last November ap
proved a proposition urging divestiture as quickly
as possible.
At the UC-Berkele\ campus, protesters from the
Association of Graduate Student Employees and

American Federation of State. County and

ment began, was the site of mass arrests April 16.
Protesters rattled windows of the president's
office and announced they were marching to

protesters.
