## New microscope uses laser to create image 
### PATRICK LIN Editorial staff 
One billionth of a meter. That is what researchers at
Stanford are hoping to see and measure with their new
device, the scanning optical microscope.
When completed, the powerful instrument will not only
provide highly magnified three-dimensional pictures of
object surfaces, but also give precise, quantitative infor
mation about the size of object features — down to 10
angstroms or a billionth of a meter.
Development of the microscope has been underway for
more than a year now. The project is being headed by
Gordon Kino, professor of electrical engineering.
Although many potential uses exist, the most immedi
ate application for the device will be in so-called "non
destructive testing." Specifically, the microscope will be
used to test how well integrated circuits are placed on
silicon chips.
The response from the semiconductor industry to the
device has been very enthusiastic. A number of Silicon
Valley firms, as well as Leitz of Germany, have already
expressed interest in marketing the instrument when it is
completed, Kino said.
He recently applied for a patent on the device through
the Office of Technology Licensing.
The scanning optical microscope operates by repeatedly
scanning a laser beam over an object and analyzing the
reflected light with digital electronics. The processed
electronic data is used to recreate an image of the object's
surface.

Thus, the scanning optical microscope does not
"magnify" objects in the traditional sense of the word.
Rather, it combines laser technology and sophisticated
electronics to produce images.
"What we've done is to alter the processing of light,"
Kino said.
The pictures that will be generated by the microscope
will resemble in some respects pictures obtained with
scanning electron microscopes that use electron beams to
make images of object surfaces.
However, a number of differences exist between the
two microscopes.
Unlike the scanning electron microscope, the scanning
optical microscope will not require a sample to be placed
in a vacuum. Samples can be used in air as they exist.
More important, the scanning optical microscope
utilizes a new concept for magnifying images, one
developed at Stanford by Applied Physics Prof. Calvin
Ouate.
The use of Ouate's idea gives the scanning optical mi
croscope powerful resolution in the vertical direction and
enables very accurate measurements to be made of the
heights of features on samples.
In contrast, the electron microscope has relatively poor
vertical resolution; however, it has superior lateral resolu
tion. The scanning optical microscope's lateral resolution
is two times better than that of the standard optical micro
scope, but not nearly as good as that of the electron mi

croscope.
Ouate used his ideas to build an acoustic microscope, a
device that employs sound waves to create magnified
images.
A unique feature of Quate's invention, aside from the
novel idea of using sound waves, is the use of coherent
sound waves to generate images. Coherent waves are
characterized by being synchronized — or "in phase" —
and by having a single wavelength.
Laser light, by definition, also consists of coherent
waves. Unlike ordinary light, comprised of many different
wavelengths all out of phase, laser light is composed of
one wavelength with all the waves are in phase.
Tim Corle, a graduate student working for Kino, ex
plained the fundamental importance of coherent waves to
the scanning optical microscope.
I he goal, Corle said, was to split a beam of coherent
light waves and to direct the two resulting beams to two
different spots on the sample. The beam that hits a de
pression in the sample will travel farther than the beam
that hits a bump.
When the two beams are reflected back, they will be
slightly out of phase. The amount by which they are out of
phase will be proportional to the difference in distance
that the two beams travel.
According to Corle, a difference of one degree in phase,
or l/360th of a wave, can be picked up by the electronic
photodetection scheme in the scanning optical micro
scope. This translates to a resolution of approximately 10
angstroms, or a billionth of a meter.

In addition to detecting phase differences in the
reflected beams of light. Kino's device also detects differ
ences in the intensity of the reflected light. The micro
scope thus extracts information about two fundamental
properties of light waves — phase and intensity.
In contrast, conventional light microscopes rely only on
differences in intensity to produce magnified images.
In order for Quate's ideas to be technically feasible in
the scanning optical microscope, it must rely on a small
piece of hardware known as a Bragg cell.
I his small crystal of tellurium dioxide is what graduate
student Philip Hobbs calls the "heart of the system."
The Bragg cell splits the incoming laser beam into dif
ferent beams and directs the resulting beams to different
spots. Simultaneously, the Bragg cell scans the laser
beams across the sample to generate a profile of the ob
ject.
By making many parallel profiles of the object, an
image ot the surface of the object could eventually be con
structed, similar to the way images are made on TV
screens, Hobbs said.
At the current stage of development, the microscope
can scan along one line and take only one profile. A com
plete image of an object's surface has not yet been
produced.
However, as Kino pointed out, "The whole purpose of
the microscope is not just pretty pictures. We want to get
quantitative data. .. . That's been the main thrust of our
research."
Indeed, Kino and his co-workers have made significant
progress in extracting precise measurements of feature
sizes with their device. According to Hobbs, they were
"recently rewarded with graphs which were extremely
close to a perfect system ... very close to the theoretical
limit of the microscope's resolving power.

or l/360th of a wave, can be picked up by the electronic
photodetection scheme in the scanning optical micro
scope. This translates to a resolution of approximately 10
angstroms, or a billionth of a meter.

In addition to detecting phase differences in the
reflected beams of light. Kino's device also detects differ
ences in the intensity of the reflected light. The micro
scope thus extracts information about two fundamental
properties of light waves — phase and intensity.
In contrast, conventional light microscopes rely only on
differences in intensity to produce magnified images.
In order for Quate's ideas to be technically feasible in
the scanning optical microscope, it must rely on a small
piece of hardware known as a Bragg cell.
I his small crystal of tellurium dioxide is what graduate
student Philip Hobbs calls the "heart of the system."
The Bragg cell splits the incoming laser beam into dif
ferent beams and directs the resulting beams to different
spots. Simultaneously, the Bragg cell scans the laser
beams across the sample to generate a profile of the ob
ject.
By making many parallel profiles of the object, an
image ot the surface of the object could eventually be con
structed, similar to the way images are made on TV
screens, Hobbs said.
At the current stage of development, the microscope
can scan along one line and take only one profile. A com
plete image of an object's surface has not yet been
produced.
However, as Kino pointed out, "The whole purpose of
the microscope is not just pretty pictures. We want to get
quantitative data. .. . That's been the main thrust of our
research."
Indeed, Kino and his co-workers have made significant
progress in extracting precise measurements of feature
sizes with their device. According to Hobbs, they were
"recently rewarded with graphs which were extremely
close to a perfect system ... very close to the theoretical
limit of the microscope's resolving power.
One billionth of a meter. That is what researchers at
Stanford are hoping to see and measure with their new
device, the scanning optical microscope.
When completed, the powerful instrument will not only
provide highly magnified three-dimensional pictures of
object surfaces, but also give precise, quantitative infor
mation about the size of object features — down to 10
angstroms or a billionth of a meter.
Development of the microscope has been underway for
more than a year now. The project is being headed by
Gordon Kino, professor of electrical engineering.
Although many potential uses exist, the most immedi
ate application for the device will be in so-called "non
destructive testing." Specifically, the microscope will be
used to test how well integrated circuits are placed on
silicon chips.
The response from the semiconductor industry to the
device has been very enthusiastic. A number of Silicon
Valley firms, as well as Leitz of Germany, have already
expressed interest in marketing the instrument when it is
completed, Kino said.
He recently applied for a patent on the device through
the Office of Technology Licensing.
The scanning optical microscope operates by repeatedly
scanning a laser beam over an object and analyzing the
reflected light with digital electronics. The processed
electronic data is used to recreate an image of the object's
surface.

Thus, the scanning optical microscope does not
"magnify" objects in the traditional sense of the word.
Rather, it combines laser technology and sophisticated
electronics to produce images.
"What we've done is to alter the processing of light,"
Kino said.
The pictures that will be generated by the microscope
will resemble in some respects pictures obtained with
scanning electron microscopes that use electron beams to
make images of object surfaces.
However, a number of differences exist between the
two microscopes.
Unlike the scanning electron microscope, the scanning
optical microscope will not require a sample to be placed
in a vacuum. Samples can be used in air as they exist.
More important, the scanning optical microscope
utilizes a new concept for magnifying images, one
developed at Stanford by Applied Physics Prof. Calvin
Ouate.
The use of Ouate's idea gives the scanning optical mi
croscope powerful resolution in the vertical direction and
enables very accurate measurements to be made of the
heights of features on samples.
In contrast, the electron microscope has relatively poor
vertical resolution; however, it has superior lateral resolu
tion. The scanning optical microscope's lateral resolution
is two times better than that of the standard optical micro
scope, but not nearly as good as that of the electron mi

Electrical Engineering Prof. Gordon Kino and graduate student Philip Hobbs are working on the scanning
optical microscope. This device uses laser beams to create highly magnified images of objects and can obtain a
resolution as accurate as one billionth of a meter.
croscope.
Ouate used his ideas to build an acoustic microscope, a
device that employs sound waves to create magnified
images.
A unique feature of Quate's invention, aside from the
novel idea of using sound waves, is the use of coherent
sound waves to generate images. Coherent waves are
characterized by being synchronized — or "in phase" —
and by having a single wavelength.
Laser light, by definition, also consists of coherent
waves. Unlike ordinary light, comprised of many different
wavelengths all out of phase, laser light is composed of
one wavelength with all the waves are in phase.
Tim Corle, a graduate student working for Kino, ex
plained the fundamental importance of coherent waves to
the scanning optical microscope.
I he goal, Corle said, was to split a beam of coherent
light waves and to direct the two resulting beams to two
different spots on the sample. The beam that hits a de
pression in the sample will travel farther than the beam
that hits a bump.
When the two beams are reflected back, they will be
slightly out of phase. The amount by which they are out of
phase will be proportional to the difference in distance
that the two beams travel.
According to Corle, a difference of one degree in phase,
or l/360th of a wave, can be picked up by the electronic
photodetection scheme in the scanning optical micro
scope. This translates to a resolution of approximately 10
angstroms, or a billionth of a meter.
