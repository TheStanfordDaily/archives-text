## New microscope uses laser to create image 
### PATRICK LIN Editorial staff 
One billionth of a meter. That is what researchers at
Stanford are hoping to see and measure with their new
device, the scanning optical microscope.
When completed, the powerful instrument will not only
provide highly magnified three-dimensional pictures of
object surfaces, but also give precise, quantitative infor
mation about the size of object features â€” down to 10
angstroms or a billionth of a meter.
Development of the microscope has been underway for
more than a year now. The project is being headed by
Gordon Kino, professor of electrical engineering.
Although many potential uses exist, the most immedi
ate application for the device will be in so-called "non
destructive testing." Specifically, the microscope will be
used to test how well integrated circuits are placed on
silicon chips.
The response from the semiconductor industry to the
device has been very enthusiastic. A number of Silicon
Valley firms, as well as Leitz of Germany, have already
expressed interest in marketing the instrument when it is
completed, Kino said.
He recently applied for a patent on the device through
the Office of Technology Licensing.
The scanning optical microscope operates by repeatedly
scanning a laser beam over an object and analyzing the
reflected light with digital electronics. The processed
electronic data is used to recreate an image of the object's
surface.

Thus, the scanning optical microscope does not
"magnify" objects in the traditional sense of the word.
Rather, it combines laser technology and sophisticated
electronics to produce images.
"What we've done is to alter the processing of light,"
Kino said.
The pictures that will be generated by the microscope
will resemble in some respects pictures obtained with
scanning electron microscopes that use electron beams to
make images of object surfaces.
However, a number of differences exist between the
two microscopes.
Unlike the scanning electron microscope, the scanning
optical microscope will not require a sample to be placed
in a vacuum. Samples can be used in air as they exist.
More important, the scanning optical microscope
utilizes a new concept for magnifying images, one
developed at Stanford by Applied Physics Prof. Calvin
Ouate.
The use of Ouate's idea gives the scanning optical mi
croscope powerful resolution in the vertical direction and
enables very accurate measurements to be made of the
heights of features on samples.
In contrast, the electron microscope has relatively poor
vertical resolution; however, it has superior lateral resolu
tion. The scanning optical microscope's lateral resolution
is two times better than that of the standard optical micro
scope, but not nearly as good as that of the electron mi

Electrical Engineering Prof. Gordon Kino and graduate student Philip Hobbs are working on the scanning
optical microscope. This device uses laser beams to create highly magnified images of objects and can obtain a
resolution as accurate as one billionth of a meter.
