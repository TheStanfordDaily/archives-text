It is generally known that the 1979
Nobel prize in physiology or medicine
was awarded to Godfrey Hounsfield
and Allan Cormack for their pioneer
ing work in the invention of the CAT
(computerized axial tomography)
scanner.
What is much less known, however,
is that this diagnostic tool relies in
good part on mathematical tech
niques developed much earlier by
Electrical Engineering Prof. Ronald
Bracewell.
In 1956, Bracewell, then director
of the Radio Astronomy Institute at
Stanford, succeeded in producing
images of the temperature distribu
tion of the sun using observations
from an earth-based radio telescope.
Bracewell exploited the fact that
the sun and the earth change their or
ientation with respect to each other as
they rotate. He realized that observa
tions made at various times during
the day — and thus at various
orientations — could be combined
and processed mathematically to
generate a three-dimensional image

of radiation arriving from the sun.
Modern devices such as the CAT
scanner produce cross-sectional
images of the human body by
employing the same ideas that
Bracewell developed for imaging ra
diation from the sun.
The CAT scanner works by taking
cross-sectional X-rays from a mul
titude of orientations, analogous to
the way Bracewell monitored solar
radiation from many different
orientations.
Moreoever, the CAT scanner
processes data from the various cross
sectional X-rays with exactly the
same mathematical functions
Bracewell employed in making
images of the sun.
These functions, discovered in
1807 by the French mathematician
Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier, are
called Fourier transforms.
In their simplest applications, these
functions are used to express complex
curves as a sum of simple waves.
Today, there are hardly any
branches of physical science and engi
neering that have not felt the impact

of Fourier's discovery. Fourier trans
forms are routinely used in various
kinds of chemical spectroscopy, in
processing signals from radio anten
nas, in underwater sonar transducers
and even in the construction of musi
cal sounds in the Moog synthesizer.
Lord Kelvin must have anticipated
as much when he predicted at the
turn of the century that these trans
forms "may be said to furnish an in
dispensable element in the treatment
of nearly every recondite question in
physics."
The vast majority of computer pro
grams currently in use compute the
Fourier transform using an algorithm
known as the Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT). The FFT algorithm, published
in 1965 by James Cooley and John
Tukey, is basically a mathematical
trick that enormously simplifies the
amount of time needed to evaluate a
Fourier transform.
However, Cooley and Tukey were
not the first discoverers of the FFT.
The German mathematician Carl
Friedrich Gauss had used essentially
the same algorithm in his calculations

in 1805, two years before the first an
nouncement of the Fourier trans
form.
Gauss work was published post
humously in 1866 and seems not to
have been generally appreciated until
its rediscovery in the last few years by
mathematical historians.
Bracewell has had a long and inti
mate association with Fourier trans
forms in the three decades of his ten
ure at Stanford. In recent years, he
has directed his efforts towards devel
oping a superfast algorithm that he
calls the Fast Hartley Transform.
The algorithm that Bracewell has
come up with uses transforms first
defined by Ralph Hartley of Bell
Laboratories in 1942. Their potential
went largely unnoticed until
Bracewell's work in 1983.
The computation of the Hartley
transform using Bracewell's al
gorithm is much faster than the com
putation of the corresponding Fourier
transform using the FFT algorithm
and can be substituted for it in all its

current uses.
The main advantage of the Fast
Hartley Transform is its use of real
numbers instead of the complex num
bers employed in the FFT. The in
creased speed is a result of the
reduced time involved in multiplica
tion: A complex multiplication takes
four times as long as a regular multi
plication.
The new algorithm could well

make the current ones obsolete and it
is expected that most computer pro
grams will switch to the Fast Hartley
Transform within five years.
A patent for the algorithm has
been filed by Bracewell, and rumor
has it that the Office of Technology
and Licensing, which handles the
patenting procedure at Stanford,
would be happier if the algorithm
were called the Fast Bracewell Trans
form.
Besides developing the Fast
Hartley Transform, Bracewell has
been personally involved in the con

struction of the many radio telescopes
and interferometers at Stanford.
He is also well known for his brain
teasers — in the Electrical Engineer
ing qualifying examination he once
asked the profound question "Why is
a manhole round?" — and he is fa
mous for his original methods in
teaching.
Bracewell is the author of many
books, with subjects ranging from the
Fourier transform to trees on the
Stanford campus. His latest book,
"The Hartley Transform," is to be
published by Oxford University Press
later this year.

Stanford, succeeded in producing
images of the temperature distribu
tion of the sun using observations
from an earth-based radio telescope.
Bracewell exploited the fact that
the sun and the earth change their or
ientation with respect to each other as
they rotate. He realized that observa
tions made at various times during
the day — and thus at various
orientations — could be combined
and processed mathematically to
generate a three-dimensional image

of radiation arriving from the sun.
Modern devices such as the CAT
scanner produce cross-sectional
images of the human body by
employing the same ideas that
Bracewell developed for imaging ra
diation from the sun.
The CAT scanner works by taking
cross-sectional X-rays from a mul
titude of orientations, analogous to
the way Bracewell monitored solar
radiation from many different
orientations.
Moreoever, the CAT scanner
processes data from the various cross
sectional X-rays with exactly the
same mathematical functions
Bracewell employed in making
images of the sun.
These functions, discovered in
1807 by the French mathematician
Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier, are
called Fourier transforms.
In their simplest applications, these
functions are used to express complex
curves as a sum of simple waves.
Today, there are hardly any
branches of physical science and engi
neering that have not felt the impact

of Fourier's discovery. Fourier trans
forms are routinely used in various
kinds of chemical spectroscopy, in
processing signals from radio anten
nas, in underwater sonar transducers
and even in the construction of musi
cal sounds in the Moog synthesizer.
Lord Kelvin must have anticipated
as much when he predicted at the
turn of the century that these trans
forms "may be said to furnish an in
dispensable element in the treatment
of nearly every recondite question in
physics."
The vast majority of computer pro
grams currently in use compute the
Fourier transform using an algorithm
known as the Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT). The FFT algorithm, published
in 1965 by James Cooley and John
Tukey, is basically a mathematical
trick that enormously simplifies the
amount of time needed to evaluate a
Fourier transform.
However, Cooley and Tukey were
not the first discoverers of the FFT.
The German mathematician Carl
Friedrich Gauss had used essentially
the same algorithm in his calculations

in 1805, two years before the first an
nouncement of the Fourier trans
form.
Gauss work was published post
humously in 1866 and seems not to
have been generally appreciated until
its rediscovery in the last few years by
mathematical historians.
Bracewell has had a long and inti
mate association with Fourier trans
forms in the three decades of his ten
ure at Stanford. In recent years, he
has directed his efforts towards devel
oping a superfast algorithm that he
calls the Fast Hartley Transform.
The algorithm that Bracewell has
come up with uses transforms first
defined by Ralph Hartley of Bell
Laboratories in 1942. Their potential
went largely unnoticed until
Bracewell's work in 1983.
The computation of the Hartley
transform using Bracewell's al
gorithm is much faster than the com
putation of the corresponding Fourier
transform using the FFT algorithm
and can be substituted for it in all its

Electical Engineering Prof. Ronald Bracewell has filed a patent for the
Fast Hartley Transform, a mathematical algorithm that experts expect
will be used by most computers within five years.
current uses.
The main advantage of the Fast
Hartley Transform is its use of real
numbers instead of the complex num
bers employed in the FFT. The in
creased speed is a result of the
reduced time involved in multiplica
tion: A complex multiplication takes
four times as long as a regular multi
plication.
The new algorithm could well

make the current ones obsolete and it
is expected that most computer pro
grams will switch to the Fast Hartley
Transform within five years.
A patent for the algorithm has
been filed by Bracewell, and rumor
has it that the Office of Technology
and Licensing, which handles the
patenting procedure at Stanford,
would be happier if the algorithm
were called the Fast Bracewell Trans
form.
Besides developing the Fast
Hartley Transform, Bracewell has
been personally involved in the con

struction of the many radio telescopes
and interferometers at Stanford.
He is also well known for his brain
teasers — in the Electrical Engineer
ing qualifying examination he once
asked the profound question "Why is
a manhole round?" — and he is fa
mous for his original methods in
teaching.
Bracewell is the author of many
books, with subjects ranging from the
Fourier transform to trees on the
Stanford campus. His latest book,
"The Hartley Transform," is to be
published by Oxford University Press
later this year.
