## THE 						STANFORD DAILY A 						coup for Zschau 
### 
Last week, the House of Representatives
handed President Reagan a major foreign policy
defeat in a dramatic rejection of all further aid to
the Nicaraguan Contras. The House threw out
both the Republican and Democratic com
promises offering different levels of "non-lethal"
aid for humanitarian reasons.
We applaud the House, and particularly our
congressman, Ed Zschau, for rising above the
desperate moves characterizing the administra
tion's proposed aid and for standing firmly
against Reagan's call for a complete restructuring
of the Sandinista government through military
means.
Zschau addressed the House on the subject for
nearly five minutes, became a co-sponsor of the
principal Democratic alternative to the presi
dent's plan and presented Reagan with a copy of
that alternative last week in the Oval Office. We
praise Zschau especially because he turned
against Reagan, crossed party lines and isolated
himself from the rest of the liberal-to-moderate
Republicans.
Zschau was one of only 40 Republicans in the
House — and the only one from California — to
vote against the president's plan. He had the
courage and the conscience to decide, as he puts
it, "If something isn't working, try something
else."
Zschau's action on the Contra issue is particu
larly refreshing in light of the volumes of contra

dictory and paradoxical rhetoric that has been
generated by the administration in support of
Contra aid.
There is a large group in Congress that calls for
increased action against the Sandinista regime
because they say the current situation in Latin
America is not like that in Vietnam. They cite the
proximity to the United States and the fact that
the Contras are not asking for a U.S. military
presence. They only want aid for the indigenous
struggle of the "freedom fighters."
The administration, on the other hand, is call
ing for increased Contra aid because the situation
is like that in Vietnam. At the end of the week, in
the aftermath of the House vote, Secretary of
State George Shultz asked if we can "afford to be
naive again about the consequences when we pull
back, about the ruthlessness of Communist rule."
Shultz appeared to be saying that the United
States should not be content about losing in
Nicaragua as it did in Vietnam. He did not,
however, call for the introduction of U.S. troops,
nor did he present another plan.
This seemed like a desperate move on the part
of an administration ready to say anything to get
aid for the Contras. The fact that the House was
not duped by the last-ditch efforts of the Reagan
team shows not only the value of our system of
checks and balances, but also the strong opposi
tion in Congress and in this country to increased
aid for the Contras.
