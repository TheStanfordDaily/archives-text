Playboy's parody
In portraying the participation of
Stanford women in Playboy's up
coming "Girls of the Pac-10" issue
as the exercise of "the right of con
senting adults to do what they please
in private" (The Daily, April 9),
David Kenny has misunderstood
Playboy's intentions in publishing the
issue; in portraying the current
protest of that participation as "an
unwarranted intrusion" into that
"right," Kenny has misunderstood
the intentions of the protesters.
Playboy's "Pac-10" issue parodies
men's collegiate athletic competition.
Its appeal as a gimmick lies in the
analogy between an athletic event, in
which teams representing their
respective schools compete on the
basis of their athletic skill and train
ing, and Playboy's Pac-10 event, in
which individual women representing
their respective schools compete on
the basis of their bodies. Members of
a sports team are selected from
among a school's athletes; in compe
tition they are presented as the best
that the school has to offer in that
sport. Playboy selects its models
from among the women who inter
view with it; they are presented in
competition as the best that their
school has to offer.
The members of the Stanford
community who protested
Playboy's "visit" are' saying that they
do not want representation in a
pornographic magazine. Should a
Stanford woman pose as "a Stanford
co-ed," she will be identified with us
and we with her. Her decision is not
purely "private." As Stanford may
oppose the use of its name to sell
products, we oppose the use of its
name to sell women's bodies. We are
fighting Playboy not out of
"aesthetic distaste," as Kenny
claims, but because we believe that
the production and consumption of
pornography injures women. It treats
and perpetuates the treatment of
women as objects.

Trouble at Tresidder
Ironically, the Tresidder logo
reads "The People Place." Words,
however, do not make reality; ac
tions do. The actions of Tresidder
management have made Tresidder
into one of the most notoriously
anti-people places to work at on
campus.
Tresidder's treatment of
employees raises larger issues: Who
runs Tresidder, for whose benefit,
and do students really want
employees treated this way in their
student union?
What kind of treatment are we
talking about? These are the words
of a former secretary: "Tresidder
uses up and then throws away its
employees. Their supervisory
practices limit and maim people,
diminish their productiveness and
rob them of any joy in their work."
She was one of a long, long list of
people who have been fired, forced
to resign or have left in disgust.
While some of these cases have "two
sides," out of this long list a clear
pattern has emerged: Tresidder
Union often shows a callous disre
gard for the welfare of its own
employees.
The attitude of Tresidder manage
ment is summarized by the way it
treated a Chicano custodian. Be
cause he had been a custodian for so
many years, his seniority under the
USW contract protected him from
being laid off as a custodian. Tresid
der, however, promoted him to a
maintenance person and then laid
him off. Since he had no seniority as
a maintenance person, the current
director could get away with it."It
was unfortunate," she said, as the
worker was left with no job.
Management's attitude was the
same years later when Keith Ar
chuleta joined the long list of people
ousted. Archuleta was hired as program
coordinator and was the only black
employee ever to sit on the director's
staff. Students loved him, co-workers
respected him, and by all accounts he
did a good job. Tresidder manage-

ment, however, chose to disregard
Keith's performance, minority af
firmative action, student and staff
feelings and the University's own
"Guide Memo." They replaced him.
While Archuleta was fighting for his
job, an unusual thing began to hap
pen. For the first time, people
representing student, vendor and
employee groups at Tresidder stood
up and voiced their complaints,
individually and in groups, through
University channels. It was an
amazing show of unity and courage
from people often afraid of retalia
tion by Tresidder management. The
complaints had one underlying
message: People were sick and tired
of seeing good people, like Archuleta,
pushed out, and they were sick and
tired of how Tresidder treated those
who were left.
We are writing this because we
don't believe that students want their
student union run this way. The
Tresidder issue raises a larger issue:
that of student and community con
trol over facilities supposedly there
to serve student and community needs
Community control is also an issue
with the Coffee House and divest
ment. Just as with the Coffee House
and divestment, the community has
real power if it chooses to use it. In
the same way that Tresidder man
agement controls employees, so does
the community control Tresidder
management. It is the community
which can choose to use Tresidder or
choose to boycott it.
For those left at Tresidder, the
best defense is a well-informed com
munity, aware of its power and ready
to use it if Tresidder doesn't begin to
treat its employees in a humane, just
and non-racist manner.
