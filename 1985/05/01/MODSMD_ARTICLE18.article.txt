## What's hot, what's not – No. 2 
### 
During winter quarter I presented the first installment
of what I hope will be a continuing public service: letting
people know what's hot and what's not. The winds of fash
ion, like the ravages of time, wait for no one. Thus, given
a new quarter, a new season and several weeks, I felt it
was time for an update. Hence, without further delay, I
present the current entries.
What's hot?
1. Flashy Plaids and Pollack Prints: Somewhat akin to
"It Came from Outer Space," these fabrics suddenly ap-

VIEWPOINT

peared on the racks at better department stores last sum
mer. Now, like an infectious disease, their spread
seemingly unstoppable, they have completely dominated
the bodies of spring quarter. Let me clarify my terminol
ogy: Flashy plaids refers to those shockingly noticeable
print fabrics characterized by criss-crossing stripes form
ing boxes of different sizes. Typical colors are pink, light
green, tangerine, anemic yellow, etc. Pollack prints, for
those of you who have never seen a Jackson Pollack paint
ing or failed to draw the analogy, look as if they were de
signed by someone splashing paint on a solid-colored
background. The typical colors here are bolder, with your
basic blacks, reds and greens dominating. Also worth a
mention, though they fall between the categories cited
here, are those loud fabrics which frequently interfere
with Ouadside conversation: Tiger-stripe patterns and
spotted prints are typical examples. Needless to say,
baggy, long shorts of said design qualify for extra hotness
points. We know who buys these clothes; I want to know
who makes them.
2. Rock Concerts: The Prince and the U2 concerts at
the close of last quarter apparently were well-attended by
the Stanford population. The rave reviews in The Daily
and constant buzz of pre-class conversation revolving
around the topic attest to this. The fact that a Stanford
freshman was elevated to folk hero after being called on
stage by Bono, the one-named, leather-panted vocalist of
U2, is further proof (as if any were necessary). Judging by
the coverage and student interest, these concerts had the
most impact of any event external to campus since the
1984 earthquake.
3. Going Someplace to Get a Tan over Break: In des
cending order of hotness (independent of climate) are
Hawaii, the Caribbean, Los Cabos, elsewhere in Mexico
and, in last place. Southern California. Of course, there
are always tanning clinics and dormitory roofs for those
stuck in the Bay Area, but who can count on the weather?
4. Covert Yuppieism: Let's face it, we're all upper
middle class or better, or aspiring to get there, or we
wouldn't have chosen to come to Stanford. So, why not
,dress the part? The heat of the oncoming summer not
withstanding, an occasional day as a neatly groomed
future Yuppie never hurt anyone. There is a fine line,
however, that should not be crossed. Dressy sport clothes
with a nice belt and matching jewelry are fine, but suits
are really overdoing it. The executive of tomorrow need
not wear a tie today; I don't care if she is on her way back
from a big interview. Get that tie off as soon as you're out
that door! Then, head right home and change before
anyone sees you.

What's not?
1. Apartheid: The racist government of South Africa
has engaged in this heinous practice since the day of its
founding; anyone with a brain is right to deplore it.
However, we must look beyond moral issues to under
stand the current popularity of this particular cause. Some
more cynical observers — the U.S. Department of State,
for example — have referred to the movement as being
popular because it is the latest way to get arrested with a
celebrity. Others have implied that it is mere publicity
pandering. However, 1 think both views underestimate
the current grassroots disdain for the overt racism of
South Africa. Columbia and UC-Berkeley, those bellwethers
of student activism, have sounded off already; Stanford
followed before. Don Kennedy and his trustee honchos
would be well-advised to make some conciliatory noises
on the issue. A little bit of insubstantial rhetoric, the
proverbial bone to the dog, might retard even further the
inkling urge toward activism here.
2. Exams and Term Papers: Really, this is just a varia
tion of the ages-old complaint about the quarter system.
The University has managed to mollify most of the people
most of the time. This was done by allowing most of us,
completers notwithstanding, to go home for Christmas
with fall quarter behind us (the sole ironic exception to
this is the law school, which operates on the semester sys
tem). The price we pay is a surfeit of quizzes, short papers,
midterms, term papers and finals. Given four or five
classes with 10 weeks to have all of the above, there is
little opportunity to spread them out. And on top of that,
you have all those credit hours to attend to every week.
3. Student Government: It occurred to me the other
night that absolute power corrupts absolutely. In thinking
about student government at Stanford, however, one is
still left with the question: What the hell is the problem
here? Almost no power and a dissertation to do corrodes
the mind absolutely? No real basis for opinions on sub
stantive issues and obtuse University regulations make
mountains out of molehills. What a great idea to take
away the right to refunds! Next thing you know, they'll be
voting themselves a salary. Who do they think they are?
The Bursar's Office? The trustees? Congress?
4. Playboy's Girls of the Pac-10: Not hot in the least, at
the moment. There is not a person (or at least very few of
them) on campus who will express anything but outrage at
the arrival of Playboy photographers at Stanford. Of
course, there is probably some covert sympathy: A
resilient hope that someday a Stanford class will start with
the lifting of a blackboard to reveal the naked body of a
young woman actually in the room. However, that senti
ment is being held silently at the moment; today belongs
to those who oppose the exploitation of women. It is
equally clear, however, that by the week of the publica
tion of the issue in question, things may change. I'm sure
that student interest will then be such that this may very
well be on the other side of the Hot/Not Hot barrier.
There you have it, people. Eight things to think about
until next time. To paraphrase my favorite newscaster, if
you don t like what's hot, go out and heat something up of
your own. Just remember, I'll be watching you; you're my
inspiration.
