# Divestment proponents are charlatans

Talk of the use of economic artillery has become
chic of late. One no longer condemns oneself to op
probrium when one mentions interventionism — as
long as it is of the economic type. Its oppugners
seem to have abandoned their vigil at the front

lines and retreated to vituperative tirades against
military intervention. Mention a Green Beret with
an M-16 and one risks having to endure an ava
lanche of condemning ribaldry. But mention wield
ing an economic weapon of some sort or another
and one receives commensurate adulation.
I have been under the erroneous impression that
intervention by the United States, whatever form it
might assume, was considered imperialistic and
correspondingly ignominious. Recent events have
been enlightening. Apparently, only intervention
of the military sort is maleficent. But is economic
intervention beneficent or even efficacious?
It must be. All the self-proclaimed pundits and
moralizers who have for years berated America's
nefarious military interventionism are rabidly
frothing over the prospect of destabilizing the
South African government and sending that
country toward a sanguinary revolution. They seem
oblivious to the fact that the sort of destabilization
they are so anxious to hasten is doubtful. But these
fellows continually display their proclivity toward

the willing suspension of disbelief. They are not
pundits but charlatans.
That they should grossly over-estimate the ef
ficacy of unilateral American sanctions is not star
tling. On the contrary, their naivete and credulity
are predictable. But what is surprising is the quick
ness with which they alter their unimpcrialistic skin
and reveal their true colors: fluorescent Yankee
red, white and blue. The shoddily self-constructed
moral high ground inhabited by these haughty dun
derheads seems to have suffered a landslide, albeit
one they will no doubt quickly clean up.

Despite these patriotic chameleons' hopes, we
must be realistic for a moment. A U.S. firm's aban
donment of a factory or refinery does not mean
that it will lay idle and rust regardless of how much
of an edge one believes American management to
have over the rest of the world. And the un
availability of a particular product does not mean
that it or something similar will not be purchased
elsewhere. Abandoned profitable ventures attract
profit-seekers of which there is no dearth in this
world.
These fellows also mistakenly expect America to

lead a collective international divorce from South
Africa. Perhaps we can afford to he selectively
moralistic in trade relationships. That luxury is
heyond others means. They do business or go
bankrupt.
Voicing outrage through public protest is an ef
fective means for being heard around the world.
The potential in.pact of a vociferous minority on
public opinion and legislation is no secret. But the
specific demands of recent protests arc more than a
bit ridiculous.
The cause is a noble one, to be sure, for all find

the South African sysiem repulsive, abhorrent, un
just. And all are struck by the feeling that we ought
do "something." Some place conditions on their
willingness to "do something." however, those con
ditions being that the object of the "something," if
achieved, would first have some effect, and second
have the sought-after effect. Others are content to
do something for something's sake.
