## Pledges go ‘on line' in the black Greek system 
### MARILYN WANN Staff writer 
The ROTC hasn't started a strange new recruitment
drive with guys marching around in pseudo uniforms car
rying burlap bags, and FTD isn't making campus
deliveries of little potted ivys.
The people you see who look as if they would fit in
either of these situations are likely to be pledges in one of
the five black fraternities or sororities — groups that
practice a decades-old tradition called being "on line."
This tradition is as old as the black Greek movement
that began in the 1910s with the purpose of providing
mutual support and a foundation for greater achievement,
but it is new and unfamiliar to the Stanford community.
"It looks sort of militaristic, but I guess it's just a frat
thing," said one confused onlooker.
The members of these three- to four-year-old campus
organizations don't seem to worry about this impression,
though.
"The rest of the campus can't really understand what's
going on," Kappa Alpha Psi President Anre Williams ad
mitted. "People who don't ask questions may have a dis
torted view of the fraternity, but I would suggest they ask
questions of the members."
Pledges aren't supposed to explain why they are
wearing uniforms or carrying plants because they are un
der a code of silence that extends to all discussions except
ones that deal with classwork or that are between pledges
and fraternity members.
The uniform details of being on line change with each
organization. The Kappa pledges wear crimson and
cream, the fraternity's colors, on certain days, and scrolls
hang around their necks to symbolize the importance of
written history.
Omega Psi Phi pledges, who choose their uniforms each
year, are wearing green pants, black sweatshirts and shoes
and carrying burlap bags.
"One thing that's stressed in our organization is unity.
The concept of being on line is being as one," said
Omega's Dean of Pledges, Leonard Ralph. He remem
bered being on line himself two years ago, saying, "It was
really weird looking like somebody else, awkward at

He recalled being embarrassed when his line would
walk through Green Library to do its mandatory study
hours together, and people, especially his friends, gave
strange looks.
Freshman Lisa Benton, who is pledging Alpha Kappa
Alpha, talked about having the same feelings now when
she wears her uniform of a white skirt, green-striped shirt
and carries the regulation Ivy plant.
"Some of the stuff they have us do is pretty demand
ing," Benton said. "It's really hard on my friends. They
don't understand why I don't have time to socialize with

them or talk to them when I walk by, but we're supposed
to be very serious and not talk to people. They think I'm
being rude."
Ralph admitted that the process is harsh, saying, "1
think it's against the hazing policy even. The University
hasn't confronted us with it yet."
The uniforms and rules for behavior are necessary, ac
cording to the current members, because they link the
new members to the ideals of the group that they will be
able to rely on for the rest of their lives in any part of the
country.

"It's the bond that keeps the frat together," said sopho
more Rick Ricketts, a Kappa Alpha Psi member, rejardmj
the pledge process that includes memorizing about 15
pages of fraternity or sorority history, doing community
service work and spending most of one's free time with
other pledges.
"We tell them it's harder being in the frat than it is to
pledge because it's a limited time on line, but being in the
frat is a commitment until you die," explained Ralph.
Most black fraternity and sorority members said they
feel their groups were closer than white Greek chapters
because of the rigorous pledge period, which can continue
for more than a month or until the pledges are ready to be
accepted into the group.
There is even enough unity between the different black
fraternities and sororities that Williams spoke of his hopes
for a coalition between the small groups. All five together
would list only about 60 members.
Steve Phillips, chairman of the Black Student Union,
credited these small organizations with playing an impor
tant role in terms of social life and easing feelings of
alienation in a large university for black students.
These are the results the black Greek system hopes to
get with its demands on pledges. "The purpose isn't to
make fun of them at all, like a costume or whatever," said
Williams. "It's more like a uniform, a serious thing."
Williams' fraternity brother Marvin Evans said,
"Pledging just basically changes the way you are."
Kappa member Phil Cannon believes that "you grow up
all over again, learn a new set of rules and go through
feeling awkward and not knowing what to say."
Omega member Ralph concurred, saying, "There are a
lot of times when you do not understand. It's a growing
experience, like going through life in a couple of weeks.
The frat brothers are trying to take you from infancy to
adulthood."
As the number of students willing to spend time on line
increases, the black Greek system at Stanford should
become better understood, according to the members of
these groups.
Ralph explained, "The way people view us doesn't
really deter us, because we have basic guidelines from
when we were founded in 1911."

Black fraternities and sororities have been at Stanford for only a few years, and their pledge process, involv
ing a period of silence, uniforms and the carrying of symbolic ivy plants, is still unfamiliar to most students.
The ROTC hasn't started a strange new recruitment
drive with guys marching around in pseudo uniforms car
rying burlap bags, and FTD isn't making campus
deliveries of little potted ivys.
The people you see who look as if they would fit in
either of these situations are likely to be pledges in one of
the five black fraternities or sororities — groups that
practice a decades-old tradition called being "on line."
This tradition is as old as the black Greek movement
that began in the 1910s with the purpose of providing
mutual support and a foundation for greater achievement,
but it is new and unfamiliar to the Stanford community.
"It looks sort of militaristic, but I guess it's just a frat
thing," said one confused onlooker.
The members of these three- to four-year-old campus
organizations don't seem to worry about this impression,
though.
"The rest of the campus can't really understand what's
going on," Kappa Alpha Psi President Anre Williams ad
mitted. "People who don't ask questions may have a dis
torted view of the fraternity, but I would suggest they ask
questions of the members."
Pledges aren't supposed to explain why they are
wearing uniforms or carrying plants because they are un
der a code of silence that extends to all discussions except
ones that deal with classwork or that are between pledges
and fraternity members.
The uniform details of being on line change with each
organization. The Kappa pledges wear crimson and
cream, the fraternity's colors, on certain days, and scrolls
hang around their necks to symbolize the importance of
written history.
Omega Psi Phi pledges, who choose their uniforms each
year, are wearing green pants, black sweatshirts and shoes
and carrying burlap bags.
"One thing that's stressed in our organization is unity.
The concept of being on line is being as one," said
Omega's Dean of Pledges, Leonard Ralph. He remem
bered being on line himself two years ago, saying, "It was
really weird looking like somebody else, awkward at

He recalled being embarrassed when his line would
walk through Green Library to do its mandatory study
hours together, and people, especially his friends, gave
strange looks.
Freshman Lisa Benton, who is pledging Alpha Kappa
Alpha, talked about having the same feelings now when
she wears her uniform of a white skirt, green-striped shirt
and carries the regulation Ivy plant.
"Some of the stuff they have us do is pretty demand
ing," Benton said. "It's really hard on my friends. They
don't understand why I don't have time to socialize with

them or talk to them when I walk by, but we're supposed
to be very serious and not talk to people. They think I'm
being rude."
Ralph admitted that the process is harsh, saying, "1
think it's against the hazing policy even. The University
hasn't confronted us with it yet."
The uniforms and rules for behavior are necessary, ac
cording to the current members, because they link the
new members to the ideals of the group that they will be
able to rely on for the rest of their lives in any part of the
country.

"It's the bond that keeps the frat together," said sopho
more Rick Ricketts, a Kappa Alpha Psi member, rejardmj
the pledge process that includes memorizing about 15
pages of fraternity or sorority history, doing community
service work and spending most of one's free time with
other pledges.
"We tell them it's harder being in the frat than it is to
pledge because it's a limited time on line, but being in the
frat is a commitment until you die," explained Ralph.
Most black fraternity and sorority members said they
feel their groups were closer than white Greek chapters
because of the rigorous pledge period, which can continue
for more than a month or until the pledges are ready to be
accepted into the group.
There is even enough unity between the different black
fraternities and sororities that Williams spoke of his hopes
for a coalition between the small groups. All five together
would list only about 60 members.
Steve Phillips, chairman of the Black Student Union,
credited these small organizations with playing an impor
tant role in terms of social life and easing feelings of
alienation in a large university for black students.
These are the results the black Greek system hopes to
get with its demands on pledges. "The purpose isn't to
make fun of them at all, like a costume or whatever," said
Williams. "It's more like a uniform, a serious thing."
Williams' fraternity brother Marvin Evans said,
"Pledging just basically changes the way you are."
Kappa member Phil Cannon believes that "you grow up
all over again, learn a new set of rules and go through
feeling awkward and not knowing what to say."
Omega member Ralph concurred, saying, "There are a
lot of times when you do not understand. It's a growing
experience, like going through life in a couple of weeks.
The frat brothers are trying to take you from infancy to
adulthood."
As the number of students willing to spend time on line
increases, the black Greek system at Stanford should
become better understood, according to the members of
these groups.
Ralph explained, "The way people view us doesn't
really deter us, because we have basic guidelines from
when we were founded in 1911."
