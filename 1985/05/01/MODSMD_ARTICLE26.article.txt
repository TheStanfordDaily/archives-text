## NFL drafts 6 from Farm 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
Garin Veris surprised no one in being the
first of six Stanford players chosen through
the first 10 rounds of yesterday's National
Football League draft, but some observers
were not expecting the defensive end to last
until the second round, where the New En
gland Patriots selected him with the 48th
overall pick in the draft.
Veris wasn't surprised that he was drafted
in the second round. "I figured I'd go between
one and three. I was just happy to be picked
by the Patriots."
Wide receiver Emile Harry was the next
Stanford player selected, going to the Atlanta
Falcons in the fourth round. Outside
linebacker Tom Briehl was also chosen in the
fourth round, by the Houston Oilers.
Also drafted from Stanford were three of
fensive linemen who played next to each
other here. lackle Jeff Deaton went in the
sixth round to the New York Jets, guard Matt
Moran also in the sixth, to the Dallas Cow
boys, and center Brent Martin in the 10th, to
join Harry in Atlanta.
Veris said he didn't know much about the
Patriots, but had talked to Coach Raymond
Berry. He said he plans to fly to .Boston to
find out about the organization and to meet
with the media.
Veris also isn't too familiar with the area
where the Patriots play. "The only things I
know about Boston," he said, "are the Boston
Celtics and the New England Patriots."
"We were kind of surprised he was still on
the board," said Jim Greenidge, the Patriots'
director of publicity. "He was very high on
our list. We saw him-as a first-round type.
"We need a pass rusher, and we think he
fits the bill real well. We had him going in the
first round, so we were delighted when he was
still available."

San Francisco 49ers, had said before the draft
that he saw Veris going in the first 27 picks,
before the were to have picked.
San Francisco didn't use that 2Kth pick,
though. It traded it, along with choices in
the second and third rounds, to the Patriots
for New England's first pick.
The 49ers used that choice, the 16th over
all, to choose Mississippi Valley State wide
receiver Jerry Rice, the third receiver taken.
Dick James, the Stanford recruiting coord
inator and the only remaining member of the
staff that recruited Veris, said, "I think it's a
thrilling opportunity for him.
"First, he has to make the team and then
establish himself on a team that's coming on.
He's their first defensive pick — there's no
doubt in my mind he'll make it."
Harry was also selected by a team trying to
fill a specific need. "Harry was the top guy we
had at wide receiver when the fourth round
came," said Bob Dickingson, the Falcons' as
sistant director of public relations.
"We're in the market for a wide receiver
who can get deep and open things up for our
other receivers. If he can do that, he'll have a
place with us. If not, we may have to look
elsewhere."

Briehl said that Houston had expressed a
strong interest in him before the draft, so
being picked by the Oilers was not unex
pected. He did have his doubts, though, when
Houston lost the second- and third-round se
lections they would have received from the
Bernie Kosar trade with Minnesota. That deal
fell through when Kosar opted to be drafted
by Cleveland in a supplemental draft.
"I had talked to their general manager
when he visited me about a week ago, so I
knew there was a lot ol interest," Briehl said,
"but when they lost those picks, I wasn't so
sure.
"1 just knew they needed help on defense,
especially at linebacker. From all their picks,
it's obvious they're going after defense.
They've built the offense the last few years —
now they're trying to build the defense."
Briehl, who will be in Houston Sunday for a
minicamp, said that the Los Angeles Raiders
had also shown interest in him. "I would have
loved to have played for the Raiders," he
said, "but I'm looking forward to playing for
Houston."
Linemates Moran and Deaton went within
seven picks of each other in the sixth round,
and both were happy with the teams that
chose them.
"I've been in New York for about 12 hours
total," Deaton said, "so I don't have much
feeling about it, but I'm happy as hell to be
going there."
I he Jets plan to move Deaton, who, al
though a relatively short 6-foot-3, weighs in
at 275 pounds, from tackle to guard. "I've
never played guard before," he said. "They're
looking for tall tackles — the technique these
days requires guys with hands that drag on the
ground. The Jets said it's good that I can play
both."
Some observers saw Moran going as high as
the third round, but he was happy with the

fourth round of yesterday's NFL draft, "but I'm looking forward to playing for Hous
