# Lundblade slams two HRs in 11-8 win
## Stanford outslugs Santa Clara 
### JENNIFER KOCH Staff sportswriter 
SANTA CLARA — Three home
runs, 14 hits, and three hours and 28
minutes was all it took for Stanford to
defeat Santa Clara 11-8 yesterday.
Rescheduled after an April 16 con
test was rained out, yesterday's game
at Buck Shaw Stadium marked the
sixth straight win for the Cardinal,
tying its longest winning streak of the
season.
The Broncos managed five hits off
starting Stanford pitcher Rob Was
senaar in the bottom of the first in
ning, and came away with a 3-0 lead.
Stanford mirrored this perfor
mance in the top of the second inning
with five hits of its own. One of these
hits came in the form of a grand slam,
as shortstop John Verducci proved
himself deserving of his Pacific 10
Conference Player of the Week
honors.
Verducci's strong hitting perfor
mance generated five RBIs yester
day. Against USC last weekend, he
7 - 112 or -1 2 with eight RBIs,
enough to cause recognition for his
hitting ability as well as his defensive
skills.
"I'm slowly beginning to knock
that rap, although I have a long way
to go before I reach my potential,"
Verducci said.
Coach Mark Marquess agreed: "I
hope this will show that he is capable
of hitting, although he's been a clutch
hitter all year and has done a great
job for us."
The Cardinal came out of the
second inning with a 6-3 lead, and in
creased that lead to 7-3 by the end of
the third.
With catcher John Ramos on first.
Mike Deßenon grounded straight to
second base, but an error by Santa
Clara shortstop Steve Berriatua left

both men safe. Verducci's ground ball
to left field drove Ramos in, and
Ruben Amaro's picture-perfect bunt
along the third-base line loaded the
bases.
With just one out and Walt Harris
up to bat, the situation looked ideal
for the Cardinal. But Harris
grounded sharply to second base, the
umpire ruled interference on Amaro
as he slid into second, and the inning
ended with an automatic double-play
ruling.
The Broncos put together a rally in
the third with a two-run homer by
catcher Mike MacFarlane, but their
hopes were quickly dashed by the hit
ting performance of Rick Lundblade
which was to follow.
Lundblade powered a solo homer
off David Blakely in the fourth inning
and a two-run shot off Scott Chiam
paraino in the sixth for his 18th and
19th home runs of the season.
Lundblade now has 36 career
home runs, just one away from the
Stanford record shared by Eric
Hardgrave and Tom Guardino.
Marquess said that Lundblade hits
for a higher average than either
Hardgrave or Guardino, but that he is
otherwise "very much like
1 la rdgrave."
"I'd like to get the record,"
Lundblade said, "but it's not the most
important thing. I'm more concerned
about winning."
As Santa Clara took the field after
the top of the seventh inning, a
Beatles' song blared over the
loudspeaker. The lyrics of "You've
Got To Hide Your Love Away"
ironically portrayed the Broncos' sit
uation at that point: "How can 1 even
trv, 1 can never win. . .

Rick Dietz worked his way out of a two-on, no-out jam in the bottom of
the ninth yesterday, getting a sacrifice ground out, a pop-up and a
strikeout, to earn his seventh save.
Santa Clara started another rally in the ninth,
but it was quickly suppressed by the Cardinal.
Rick Dietz shut the door on the Broncos to pick
up his seventh save and give the win to Was
senaar, now 7-2.
Dietz gave up two quick runs on an error by
Mark Machtolf and three singles. After a
sacrifice, runners stood on second and third,
there was one out and the top of the Broncos'
order was coming to bat. But Dietz got a pop
up and a strikeout, and the Cardinal had an 11-
8 win.
There were changes in Stanford's starting
lineup for yesterday's game, with Amaro taking
over for Pete Stanicek at second base, and
Mark Machtolf and Ken Green splitting the
duties at third base.
The original lineup should return to face
Arizona State this weekend for a three-game
series in Tempe.
