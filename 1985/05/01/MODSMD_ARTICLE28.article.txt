### KEN STEVENS Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's golf team
fired the low score in yesterday's
third round at the Pacific 10 Con
ference championships in Walla
Walla, Wash., but a stubborn
Oregon team equaled the Card
inal's output to remain 16 shots
ahead of Stanford going into
today's final round.
Oregon's three-round total of
1,086 is six shots better than
second-place UCLA's 1,092.
Arizona State finished the third
round in third place at 1,100.
Stanford is just two shots back of
the Sun Devils at 1,102.
USC is in fifth place at 1,111,
followed by Arizona (1,115),
Oregon State (1,1 18), Washington
(1,119), California (1,142) and
host Washington State (1,160).
Oregon, which did not seem to
have the talent to match UCLA,
ASU or Stanford at the outset of
the tournament, continued to play
well yesterday, shooting 364 for
the day.
Though Oregon was not one of
the pre-tournament favorites,
Cardinal Coach Tim Schaaf said
that the Ducks' performance has
not been a surprise to the other
Pac-10 teams. "The five top
schools (in the conference) all
knew that Oregon would be
tough," he said.
Schaaf indicated that Oregon's
game is well-suited to the type of
course at the Walla Walla Country
Club. "Oregon has played well
this spring," he said. "They've had
some good tournaments, particu
larly on this kind of course."
The Oregon men will have some

added pressure on their shoulders
in today's final round, according to
Schaaf, because a victory at the
Pac-lOs would gain them an auto
matic berth in the nationals.
Should the Ducks fail to win
today, their season will be over.
"Not only do they have an op
portunity to win a major tourna
ment. but if they win, they will go
to nationals," Schaaf said. "It will
be interesting to see how they hold
up."
Schaaf believes that the Card
inal men are in good shape
heading into the final round. "I
think we're in a position to chal
lenge," he said. "Obviously we're
going to have to play a great
round."
If the Cardinal men can post a
good score before Oregon. UCLA
and ASU are through with their
rounds, they may be able to put
some pressure on the three lead
schools, Schaaf said. "We'll have
to play at the level that we played
at our own tournament," he said.
In individual play at Walla
Walla, UCLA standout Duffy
Waldorf has taken over the lead
after three rounds. Waldorf fired a
71 yesterday for a 212 three-day
total. Oregon's George Daves is
two shots back at 214. Arizona's
Willie Kane, USC's Sam Ran
dolph and ASU's Rich Diet/, are in
a tie for third at 216.
Stanford's Doug Thompson
fired a 70 yesterday to forge his
way into a six-way tie for sixth
place at 217. Scott Erickson and
Carl Wagner, both of Stanford,
are two shots behind Thompson,
at 219, after three rounds.
