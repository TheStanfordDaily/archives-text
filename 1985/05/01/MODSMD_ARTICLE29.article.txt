## Netters whip No. 5 Waves 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
Stanford Men's Tennis Coach Dick Gould
got his wish that his team would continue to
play as well yesterday as it did in Ojai, where
it won three conference titles this weekend.
The fourth-ranked Cardinal defeated No. 5
Pepperdine here yesterday, 6-3.
This week Stanford saw its ranking drop
from No. 1 for the first time since it rose to
that position in early February. The fall to No.
4 came as a result of the Cardinal's losses to
now No. 1-ranked UCLA and No. 2-ranked
USC April 19 and 20 in Los Angeles.
If NCAA championship seedings follow
the rankings, Stanford, as the No. 4 seed, will
most likely play Pepperdine in the quarter
finals. The NCAAs begin May 18.
"Assuming we both win our first-round
matches, we can expect to see Pepperdine in
the second-round- quarterfinals on a neutral
court," Gould said. "They are as good as any
of the teams that will be at the NCAAs."
Stanford seemed capable of handling the
Waves in yesterday's match. The Cardinal
won four of the six singles matches to move
within one win of the team victory before the
doubles competition even began.
Dan Goldie, 28-4 overall, won his No. 1
singles match against Carlos DiLaura, 6-0, 7-
5. Stanford also won the No. 2 singles match,
with Jim Grabb going three sets against No.
39-ranked Kelly Jones.
Grabb and Jones play similar serve-and
volley game styles, but Grabb outmatched his
opponent with consistent down-the-line pass
ing shots that kept his opponent reaching for
the ball.
"Kelly can beat anybody on a given day,
but Grabb just got the best of him this time,"
Pepperdine Asst. Coach Richard Gallien said.
Stanford's own version of a hot-and-cold
player is Derrick Rostagno, who won a total
of three games in his No. 3 match against
Dani Leal. Rostagno "missed all the crucial
shots and a lot more" and said his match "was
-not worth writing about."
Stanford's other singles loss came at No. 5,
where John Letts became visibly frustrated
and lost the third set, 6-0, and the match to
Pepperdine's Martin Laurendeau.
Patrick McEnroe, who has recently moved
up from No. 6 to No. 4 singles, defeated Ed
Nagel, 7-5, 6-2. McEnroe won the match on a
down-the-line backhand approach shot —
one of his common but very effective shots.
Both teams had team meetings between the

singles and doubles matches. Gould went so
far as to put on his tape of "All Right Now"
for inspiration. Going into doubles competi
tion down 4-2, Pepperdine knew it was fight
ing off a loss, though.
"We told the guys (in the team meeting)
that we still have a fighting chance and not to
worry how everyone else is doing but to just
concentrate on your own playing," Gallien
said. "Doubles is all motivation and drive. It
will take something spectacular to win, but as
long as we're alive, we have a chance to win,"

he said.
Stanford soon ended the suspense. Goldie
and Eric Rosenfeld, the Pacific 10 Confer
ence doubles champions and No. 3 doubles
team, defeated Robbie Weiss and Leal, 6-4,
6-4, for Stanford's fifth match victory and the
match win.
Stanford has two remaining home matches,
both against California. The first is this
Friday, followed on May 11 by the Mixed
Team Match, which will be played indoors at
Maples Pavilion.
