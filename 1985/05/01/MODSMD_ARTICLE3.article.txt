# SOSA to try for Tutu
## Bay Area trustees to meet with committee today 
### MARY YUH Editorial staff 
Bishop Desmond Tutu, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and
black South African leader, may speak here during his
stay in the Bay Area, according to Stanford Out of South
Africa.
Steve Phillips, an organizer of SOSA, announced the
possibility yesterday during an afternoon rally in the
Quad. The principal work for Tutu's possible Stanford ap
pearance is being done by the Office of the President
here, according to Louis Edozien of the Coalition Against
Apartheid.
"Everything is strictly exploratory at this point,"
Edozien said. "I'd rather not speculate Y>n the possibility
(that Tutu will speak at Stanford)."'
Tutu is expected to be in San Francisco on May 13, ac
cording to Phillips. Anti-apartheid protest organizers say
they hope he will speak at Stanford that day, and the Pres
ident's Office has begun inquiries about the prospect,
Phillips said.
The announcement of Tutu's possible appearance fol
lowed a meeting yesterday between SOSA's liaison com
mittee and University President Donald Kennedy.
Participants in the meeting arranged the initial details
of the upcoming forum on divestment of University funds
from companies doing business in South Africa, Phillips
said.
The forum, planned for either next Tuesday or Wed
nesday, will include several members of Stanford's Board
of Trustees and SOSA representatives. SOSA will have
45 minutes to present its case for divestment, and the Uni
versity will have 25 minutes to present its case against
divestment.

According to Phillips, "Kennedy said they only needed
25 minutes.'"
SOSA plans to bring "a socially conscious investment
banker who can talk to the members of the Board of Trus
tees in their own language but is on our side," Phillips
said. The case for divestment will be made "from a finan
cially prudent standpoint," he said.
"We want to make our case to the University. That's
the fundamental thrust of the forum," Phillips said.
The forum, to be held in either the Quad or Frost Am
phitheatre, will close with a question-and-answer session,
Phillips said.
According to SOSA member Joel Bellenson, the Uni
versity will provide financial support for publicity and
other expenses related to the forum.
It is not yet known how many trustees will attend the
forum. Most of them could not be reached for comment.
However, Trustee John Packard said, "1 think we want
to have a good session to hear everybody out and see what
can be done."
Several members of the Board of Trustees will meet
today with the liaison committee of SOSA, Phillips said.
The trustees and SOSA will discuss whether the board will
vote on the divestment issue, he said.
The Ouad was re-dedicated at yesterday's rally as
"Nelson Mandela Free University Ouad" in honor of the
black South African leader who has been imprisoned for
more than 20 years for his anti-apartheid activism.
In addition, United Stanford Workers Chief Steward
Linda Crouse made a statement in support of the
protesters and divestment.
Graduate students in the History Department have
pledged to spend Friday nights at the Ouad and those in
the English Department will spend Thursday nights there.
