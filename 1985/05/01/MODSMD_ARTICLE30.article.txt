# Frisbee team loses
## 
### 
The streak has ended. After two perfect
seasons, the Stanford ultimate Frisbee team
has finally dropped a game, a 16-14 decision
to Oregon, in the finals of the Western
Regionals this weekend in Santa Barbara.
Despite the defeat, the Cardinal will ad
vance to the national championships to be
held at Stanford May 25-27, where it will
fight to defend its title against 1 1 other
teams from around the nation.
The "road to Palo Alto" was long and
hard for the team, as it had to win the sec
tionals and then place in the top three in the
regionals to make the national champion
ships. But Stanford, led by captains Peter
Hecht and Tom Watson, was up for the chal
lenge.
On the first day of competition, Stanford
defeated three top teams by large margins to
advance to the semifinals of the tournament.
On Sunday, the competition continued, and
Stanford beat both Humboldt State and
Chabot College to advance to the finals
against the tough Oregon team.
The game started out quickly, with Stan
ford jumping to a quick lead on an early
turnover by the Ducks, whose mascot, in a
Daffy Duck costume, led cheers while a

player accompanied him on the trombone
and kazoo.
The teams traded points until Oregon
took a 14-12 lead. But Stanford was not to
give up so easily. As Wes Monroe, one ol the
heroes of the Cardinal effort, said: "We had
fought this hard, for this long, that we just
couldn't allow the streak to end."
The Ducks were not to be beaten,
however. They pulled out the game after the
Cardinal had fought to a tie at 14. As Hecht
said: "The souls were willing but the bodies
were weak."
Sandy Koontz, one of the Stanford quar
terbacks, played an outstanding game, con
tinually throwing long bombs past the
Oregon defense. Also important in the effort
were Peter Lyons, Bob Bhistikul and John
Normal, whose outstanding play earned him
honors as the brightest rookie on the Stan
ford squad.
The Cardinal will play this weekend in the
state championships at Santa Cruz. The
weekend after that, Stanford will play in the
New Mexico Invitational in Albuquerque
and then take a break before seeking to
defend its championship at home.
