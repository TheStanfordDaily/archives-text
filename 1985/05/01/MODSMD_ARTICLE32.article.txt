## Church leader seeks peace in Nicaragua 
### ANDREW PATZMAN 
Emphasizing his commitment to
"peace and non-violence," a
Nicaraguan clergyman yesterday dis
cussed tensions between the
Nicaraguan government and that
country's Miskito Indian minority.
Rev. Norman Bent, president of
the Nicaraguan Synod of the
Moravian Church and a native of the
Miskito homeland area on the Atlan
tic coast, addressed an audience of
about 40 at El Centro Chicano in a
speech entitled "The Miskito
Struggle for Peace on the Border of
War."
The Atlantic coastal region where
the Miskito live, Bent explained, has
long been isolated from the more
populous and urban areas along the
Pacific coast. "My country is cul
turally, linguistically and religiously
divided," he said.
Whereas the western half of the
country is predominantly Spanish

speaking and Catholic, the Miskito
and other tribes of the east coast
speak their own languages and are
overwhelmingly Protestant. More
than 60 percent of the Miskitos
belong to the Moravian Church, a
Protestant denomination brought to
Nicaragua by German missionaries in
1847.
Bent expressed alarm at U.S. ef
forts to undermine the Nicaraguan
government. Nicaragua, he said, is
"dedicated to the principles of non
alignment and self-determination"
Although Bent said he "strongly
supports" the Sandinista government,
he sharply criticized its "dealing with
the people of the east coast." Before
the revolution, he said, the Sandinis
tas "did not try to get the east coast
involved in their struggle against
Somoza." This, he said, "contributed
to [the Miskito's] isolation."
When they attempted to

"integrate" the Indians into the gen
eral population after the revolution,
the Sandinistas, according to Bent,
were hampered by "their lack of
knowledge (of the Indians), their in
sensitivity and their revolutionary
spirit."
More than 25,000 Miskitos have
fled to Honduras and Guatemala as
refugees, Bent said. "We were vic
tims of our own mistakes," he added.
"Trying to integrate them, we drove
the Indians to become our enemies.
We also drove them into the hands of
our enemy — the CIA."
Amid these tensions, Bent
recounted, "the Moravian Church
declared itself an agent of reconcilia
tion between our government and our
people."
He expressed hope that "one day"
these mediation efforts will result in
the east coast being "declared an
'autonomous region' " within the na
tion of Nicaragua.
