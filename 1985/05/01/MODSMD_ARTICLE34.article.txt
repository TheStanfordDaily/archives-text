Anatomy renovation money approved
A $ 1 million renovation project to improve
facilities used for teaching gross human
anatomy to medical students has been ap
proved by the Stanford Board of Trustees.
I he project will provide seminar room
space, improved cadaver storage, dissecting
rooms, laboratories and other program and

code improvements, according to David Men
delow, associate dean for administration of
Stanford Medical School.
Gross human anatomy, which teaches
medical students basic human structure, is
fundamental for physicians in every branch of
medicine. The subject is taught in the
anatomy building situated between Campus
Drive and the Stanford Museum.
I.ane Library called "inadequate"
Stanford School of Medicine's Lane Li
brary, a central place in the training of
physicians and one of the nation's major
repositories of medical information, is
"alarmingly inadequate," says a report of the
library committee.
The library will have to be replaced in the
near future to maintian excellence and fulfill
its mission, the committee said.
"The lack of space interferes seriously with
our ability to provide up-to-date services to
students, faculty, medical staff, the University

and our affiliated institutions," agreed
David Korn, medical school dean. "Providing
sufficient growth space for the library is criti
cal to our long range agenda."
The paucity of space, insufficient number of
librarians, and lack of room for future collec
tion expansion were also noted by the Liaison
Committee on Medical Education (LCME),
an accreditation team that reviewed the medi
cal school last year. The school received full
accreditation, but it has been required to
present to the LCME a plan for solving the
problems of overcrowding in the library and
to develop an approach for the application of
automation technology.
