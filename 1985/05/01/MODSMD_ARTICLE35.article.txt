## Black professionals unite Tresidder meeting emphasizes Bay Area contacts 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
More than 700 black professionals and scientists from
the Bay Area met last night at Tresidder Union, exchang
ing job information and establishing occupational ties.
The meeting was sponsored by Bay Net, a
"networking" organization established one year ago to
consolidate the expertise of local black professionals, ac
cording to Darryl Bozeman, one of the group's founders.
The organization requires no membership and is open
to "anyone who considers [himself] to be a professional,"
Bozeman said, adding that as far as he knows, Bay Net is
the only organization of its type in the country.
James Patterson, University coordinator of engineering
and science advising and a Bay Net site coordinator,
called the organization "a networking group for black
professionals and scientists who work in the Silicon Val

ley." He added that the group allows blacks "who or
dinarily would not come together" to meet and share in
formation and experiences.
"Stanford has a strong commitment to the development
of human resources," said University Provost James
Rosse in his welcoming address to the group.
Rosse said he was pleased to see "so many members of
the Stanford community involved in the program," adding
that he hoped none would leave the University and seek
employment elsewhere.
Tony Watkins, a 1974 Stanford graduate who teaches
at a private high school in Oakland, was one of the first
time participants in the Bay Net meeting.
"My basic reason for being here is to find a job, perhaps
in the electronics industry, and to find people with whom I
can make contacts," Watkins said.
