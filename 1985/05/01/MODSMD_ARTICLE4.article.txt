# Laureates fear cuts in funding
## 
### DANNY PEARL Staff writer 
Stanford researchers are warning that proposed
cuts in government funding programs could
jeopardize several Stanford research programs and
endanger American research leadership in a variety
of fields.
In a letter sent Monday to House and Senate ap
propriations committees, nine Stanford professors
criticized cuts in funding for advanced research
equipment as "disproportionate and selective,"
and urged Congress to maintain full support for
biomedical technology.
Among the signers are Nobel laureates Robert
Hofstadter, physics; Linus Pauling, chemistry and
peace; and Henry Taube, chemistry.
The 1985 federal budget provides $35.2 million
for medical instrumentation grants administered by
the National Institutes of Health, funds which Stan
ford and other research institutes use to modernize
and maintain equipment like computer systems, X
ray equipment, microscopes and nuclear magnetic
resonance machines. The Reagan administration
has proposed a reduction of the NlH's instrumen
tation budget to $26.8 million for fiscal 1986.
According to the letter, "The use of sophisti
cated technology has become an indispensable part

of modern research, and large reductions in the
budgets of those programs that provide instrumen
tation centers will have a profound adverse effect
on a wide spectrum of research activities."
Pharmacology Prof. Oleg Jardetzky, director of
the Stanford Magnetic Resonance Laboratory, said
Stanford has received $3 million to $5 million in
NIH grants, not counting computer facilities. He
said the proposed budget cuts would be a "real dis
aster" for Stanford and for the whole country.
"We have had plans for a nuclear magnetic
resonance center, for example," Jardetzky said. "A
substantial amount of funding would come from
federal instrumentation programs. If the federal
funds were cut substantially, we would have no
hope of getting funding."
Stanford's magnetic resonance facilities allow re
searchers around the country to gain high
resolution images of body tissues and organs and
to perform metabolic studies on cell processes
which are still functioning, according to Stanford
Medical Center spokesman Spyros Andreopoulos.
Andreopoulos said the SIJMEX-AIM medical
computing system and Stanford Synchrotron Radi
ation Laboratory (SSRL) are two other Stanford
facilities that serve researchers throughout the
country and that rely on federal instrumentation
programs for funding.

Federal instrumentation grants also help main
tain Stanford's animal research facility, according
to Jardetzky.
SSRL Director Arthur Bienenstock said X-ray
and ultraviolet radiation techniques provided by his
laboratory assist nationwide research into the
atomic arrangement of biological materials and re
search in methods of using radiation to diagnose ar
terial scleroris, among other things.
"Our facility is clearly the best in the world,"
Bienenstock said. But he pointed out that a joint
French-German venture has invested between
$150 million and $200 million so far to build a
facility which would surpass Stanford's.
Bienenstock said the Europeans would probably
succeed if Congress cuts NIH funding.
Jardetzky, who has twice testified before
Congress on the instrumentation funding issue, said
instrumentation programs are vulnerable targets
for deep budget cuts because the grants involved
are extremely large â€” typically $500,000 to $1
million apiece.
Jardetzky will join researchers from Harvard and
MIT in informal talks with members of Congress in
Washington, D.C., tomorrow. He speculated that
the instrumentation issue would not come to a vote
in Congress before June.
