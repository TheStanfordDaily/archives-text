# Did U.S. plan to poison WWII foes?
## Bernstein reveals radiation scheme 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
Senior American weapons scien
tists in 1943 considered poisoning
half a million of the enemy with
radiation-contaminated food, accord
ing to History Prof. Barton Bernstein.
The proposal. never fully
developed, was discussed in a
recently declassified letter from J.
Robert Oppenheiiner, director of the
Los Alamos atomic bomb laboratory,
to Nobel laureate Enrico Fermi, ac
cording to an article by Bernstein in
the May-June issue of MlT's Tech
nology Review.
Oppenheimer advised in the letter,
written on May 23, 1943. to abandon
the plan until "we can poison food
sufficient enough to kill half a million
men."
"Amid the horror of World War 11.
including German concentration
camps and the mass killing of Jews,
many U.S. scientists, like the rank
and-file civilians, were willing to
devise new ways to kill the enemy by
the thousands and even hundreds of
thousands." Bernstein reports in his
article.
The letter shows "what it meant for
America to be in World War II."
Bernstein said. He referred to the
"moral decline of notable scientists."
The letter also stands as "a dra
matic reminder" of the "various ways
of pursuing mass killings." he said

yesterday.
The war saw "a profound trans
formation of values," Bernstein said
in his article. "It legitimizes mass kil
lings of civilians as an acceptable
form of war."
To consider killing 500,000 people
is to redefine morality. Bernstein
said.
"Most of these scientists have for
gotten, or never knew, that in 1941 a
scientific advisory committee to the
National Academy of Sciences sug
gested that the U.S. develop the
radiological products of fission as
weapons." Bernstein said. The com
mittee was headed by Nobel laureate
Arthur Holly Compton and gave
these weapons "a higher priority than
the atomic bomb," but the increasing
"feasibility of the atomic bomb soon
overshadowed this effort," he said.
Bernstein said that two years after
Oppenheimer's letter to Fermi, "the
vast majority of Americans enthusi
astically welcomed the atomic bom
bings of Japan."
"Yet both during and after the war,
the U.S. public seemed to retain a
repugnance for gas warfare, accord
ing to the surveys at the time." he
continued.
Oppenheimer wrote in his letter
that he had discussed the proposal
with physicist Edward Teller, who
was working on the Manhattan Proj
ect that led to the atomic bomb, ac

cording to the April 19 issue of The
New York Times. Teller is currently a
senior research fellow at the Hoover
Institution.
Teller said he did not specifically
remember discussing radioactive
poisons with Oppenheimer. but said
the discussion of radioactive contami
nation against the enemy was a possi

hility, The Times reported.
"According to Teller, the idea
would have been to seed the target is
land with radioactive poison in such a
way that American forces could avoid
a costly beachhead landing and at the
same time eliminate the need to
maintain an occupation garrison," The
Times reported.
In his article. Bernstein said that
physicist Frank Oppenheimer,
Robert's younger brother, described
the letter as "bloodthirsty." Frank
Oppenheimer, however, was not
shocked at its contents.
"In those days, we talked about
everything, any way of killing,"
Bernstein said. Frank Oppenheimer
died Feb. 3.
Bernstein said Oppenheimer's let
ter led him to think about the moral
boundaries in World War 11.
His research has helped him "to
understand the role of ethics" during
wartime. Bernstein is researching
why certain warfare tactics are chosen
and not others and whether morality
plays a role in these decisions. He is
also working on an essay on poison
gas warfare.
"I hadn't planned on doing either."
he said.
"I am going to pursue the research
by going back to Washington and in
terviewing alumni." he said. "I have
also requested some more declas
sification."
