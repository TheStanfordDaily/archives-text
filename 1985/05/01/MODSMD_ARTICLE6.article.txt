Potential conflicts of interest
among faculty members drew
comments and suggestions from a
few students and faculty members
at an open meeting of the Com
mittee on Research at the Bechtel
International Center yesterday.
The committee also heard com
ments regarding University policy
on secrecy in research, including a
prepared statement by Electrical
Engineering Prof. Joseph Good
man, who has received consider
able attention during the past
week following reports that a re
search proposal he submitted
could involve classified work.
The proposal, for research on
optical computers, would draw on
funds allocated for work on Presi
dent Reagan's Strategic Defense
Initiative, also known as "Star
Wars."
Goodman told the committee
he intends to abide by the Univer
sity's policy on open research and
said that a spokesman at the Pent
agon assured him yesterday the
project would not involve unusual
restrictions.
Participants at the meeting ad
dressed issues including whether
limits should be placed on the na
ture of faculty members' roles in
outside companies, whether dis

closure by faculty members of fin
ancial interests in companies spon
soring or contributing to their re
search should be explicitly re
quired and whether routine dis
closure of outside consulting activ
ities should be required of faculty
members.
In addition, Matt Nicodemus, a
senior who co-taught a SWOPSI
course last year on military fund
ing for research at Stanford, read a
statement criticizing research con
ducted with Defense Department
funding. "Most researchers make
little effort to investigate the mili
tary's plans for their research
products even with a wealth of
available public information, in
stead prefering to downplay or
deny any military usefulness of
their works and focus their atten
tions on the beneficial applications
of 'basic research,' " he said.
Nicodemus urged members of
the committee to "ask themselves
how we can best provide resources
to the University community
which will facilitate its members
making well-informed and care
fully considered funding decisions."
Another topic discussed was
whether Stanford's policies ade
quately protect the academic

needs and interests of graduate stu
dents.
Les Earnest, senior research asso
ciate in computer science, voiced con
cern that "a clearer guidance is
needed, and perhaps a request for dis
closure" of financial interests and
consulting activities should be made
of faculty members.
"I think what constitutes conflict of
interest is a rather subjective thing."
said Earnest, who suggested the Uni
versity eliminate ambiguities in its
policy.
Under current University policy,
faculty members are required to dis
close personal holdings and consult
ing activities when they perceive that
issues of conflict may arise. Require
ments at Stanford Medical School are

stricter, with faculty members disclos
ing consulting activities and
managerial positions in companies on
a regular basis.
Earnest said that frequently in the
past, Stanford faculty members have
become involved in research that re
quires subcontracting with companies
with which the faculty member is
financially involved.
But ex-officio commitee member
Earl Cilley, director of the Sponsored
Projects Office, said those who sub
contract are asked to take the
process before an impartial body
which can establish the terms of the
contract. "We are not in a position to
police anyone who would deliberately
try to conceal the fact that they are
doing business with themselves," he
said.
Cilley said he believed Stanford
does have a "well-stated policy" re
garding disclosure of financial inter

ests which relies on the integrity of
the faculty. He added that the bu
reaucracy and additional paperwork
that new disclosure rules would
create would cost Stanford money
without benefiting the University.
Earnest and ASSU Senate Chair
Eric Berg addressed the problem of
faculty conflict of interest issues af
fecting graduate students, such as a
case in which a student works off
campus in a company owned or
managed by the student's faculty ad
viser.
In addition. Berg said a faculty
member's financial interest in a com
pany could affect the type of research
in which graduate students are in
volved. "A faculty member brought
in from a company might get a stu
dent involved in research on a project
that is commercially viable rather
than because it involves pushing back
the frontiers of science," he said.
