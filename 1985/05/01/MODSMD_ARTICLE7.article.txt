Christians stall Moslem offensive
SALHIYE, Lebanon — Christian militias laid down a barrage of ar
tillery and tank fire yesterday to stall a Moslem offensive aimed at their
encircled mountain stronghold in south Lebanon.
From positions in the hills around Kfar Fakrns, the embattled Chris
tians also deployed Israeli-supplied Sherman tanks in an effort to hold
off Popular Liberation Army troops.
At least three Moslem militiamen were killed and 19 wounded in
heavy fighting, hospitals in Sidon reported. There was no word on Chris
tian casualties.
Beirut state radio reported earlier in the day that the Popular Libera
tion Army of leftist and Moslem militias had stormed Kfar Falous. But
reporters found Moslem fighters pinned down three miles west of the
Christian strongpoint at Salhiye. on Sidon's outskirts.
The mainly Christian South Lebanon Army counterattacked with
their U.S.-made Sherman tanks, deployed for the first time since the six
day-old Moslem offensive drove the Christians into their last stronghold
in the south.
The 1.000-strong South Lebanon Army, led by former Lebanese
Army Brig. Gen. Antoine Lahd. joined forces with hundreds of Chris
tian Lebanese Forces fighters for the counterattack. Israel supports the
South Lebanon Army.
On the other side, tough Druse fighters, backed by Syrian-supplied T
-54 tanks, were seen moving up the hills around Salhiye to reinforce the
stalled Moslem forces.
In Beirut, sectarian fighting along the line separating the capital's
Christian and Moslem sectors broke out after a morning lull.
Police said at least five people were wounded in the pre-dawn fighting.
There was no immediate word of casualties in the new violence.
Fighters of the Shiite Moslem Amal militia also joined the fighting for
the first time since the Moslem push in south Lebanon was launched
Thursday. Police said at least 73 fighters have been killed and 200
wounded.
South African miners reinstated
JOHANNESBURG. South Africa — The world's largest gold mine
agreed Monday to reinstate 14,500 black miners fired over the weekend
.for holding an illegal strike, the miners* union said.
Police said six more blacks were killed in rioting around the nation,
and a government minister said black radicals were encouraging unrest
among the 22 million blacks to make the country "uncontrollable and
ungovernable" by the minority of 5 million whites.
Agreement to rehire the miners came during a seven-hour meeting at
Vaal Reefs Gold Mine with a delegation from the mine owner. Anglo
American Corp., said Manoko Nchwe. spokesman for the National
Union of Mineworkers. a three-year-old black union.
The union and Anglo American "reached agreement on the re
employment of all the dismissed workers at Vaal Reefs," Nchwe said.
"The procedure of re-employment will be discussed in further meetings
between the union and Anglo American."
Anglo American said late Monday that the meeting resulted in an
agreement by the mine to "give preferential consideration to employing
previous employees of the mine." Anglo's statement did not mention a
blanket offer to rehire all the dismissed miners, as the union maintained.
The company had said earlier it would look favorably on applications
for reinstatement by fired employees at the mine, 95 miles west of
Johannesburg. It was the largest mass dismissal in memory by the South
African gold mining industry.
The union, which claims about 100,000 members among the country's
500.000 black miners, met yesterday with Anglovaal Ltd., the owner of
Hartebeestfontein mine, where 3.000 black miners were dismissed for
taking part in an illegal strike last week. The company has said it would
consider rehiring the men.
National police headquarters in Pretoria said four blacks were killed
in rioting Sunday and early Monday, in addition to two killed earlier in
the weekend. One victim, a policeman, was attacked by a mob, strangled
and set afire.
Most of the townships in which rioting was reported were in eastern
Cape Province, where agitation against the white government's apart
heid system of race segregation has continued for weeks.
Louis le Grange, minister of law and order, charged the African Na
tional Congress, the outlawed guerrilla movement, had instructed the
the nation's 22 million blacks in February to make the country
"uncontrollable and ungovernable" by the 5 million whites.
Le Grange said the ANC urged blacks to make and steal weapons, and
to attack blacks regarded as collaborators with the government.
Helen Suzman. member of Parliament for the opposition Progressive
Federal Party, said le Grange accepted all police activities without ques
tion, even unjustified force.
"The instructions on riot control appear to have been replaced by
what is tantamount to a license to kill," she said. "No wonder that in the
eyes of blacks, the police are not performing their proper function of
protecting the public, but are the oppressors."
Royal couple, John Paul II meet
VATICAN CITY — Prince Charles and Princess Diana of Britain had
a private audience Monday with Pope John Paul 11. but a Vatican source
said Buckingham Palace overruled their planned attendance at a papal
Mass.
The pontiff and the royal couple smiled for photographers and ap
peared pleased at the end of the 35-minute audience, held in John Paul's
library. No details were given of the conversation, which was conducted
in English.
Charles gave the pope a copy of "Bedes Ecclesiastical History of the
English People." written by the English historian and theologian known
as the Venerable Bede in 731. eight centuries before King Henry VIII
broke with Rome and established the Church of England.
John Paul gave the prince and princess a copy of an original mosaic in
the Basilica of St. Mary Major in Rome of the Madonna Salus Romani
Popoli. protectress of Rome.
The office of the Most Rev. Robert Runcie. archbishop of Canterbury
and spiritual head of the Church of England, wrote the Vatican saying
the royal couple would like to attend a papal Mass, said the Vatican
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Vatican replied that it would make the arrangements, the source
said, but Buckingham Palace said later that an audience with the pope
would suffice.
