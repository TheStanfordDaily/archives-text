# Reagan to impose embargo on Nicaragua
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” President Reagan, retaliat
ing against Nicaragua's "aggressive activities in
Central America," has decided to impose a total
trade embargo against that country and to abrogate
a U.S.-Nicaraguan friendship treaty , it was learned
yesterday.
According to a draft White House announce
ment, a copy of which was obtained by The Associ
ated Press, Reagan also planned to order a suspen
sion of service to the United States by Nicaragua's
airline, Aeronica, and by the country's national flag
vessels.
The statement, which was to be formally released
late yesterday, said the activities of Nicaragua,
"supported by the Soviet Union and its allies, are
incompatible with normal commercial relations."
Nicaragua's trade with the United States has
declined sharply since 1981, reflecting the
deterioration in relations between the two
countries. Nicaragua imported about $110 million
in U.S. goods last year while exporting about half
that much to the United States, mostly bananas,
coffee and other agricultural products, according to
official figures.
The decision came less than a week after the
House killed administration efforts to resume U.S.

aid to the Contra insurgents seeking to overthrow
the leftist Sandinista government.
The draft statement said the administration
believes there is far greater support for economic
measures against Nicaragua in the Congress than
there is for military involvement.
"Direct pressure represents the only effective
means of moderating Nicaraguan behavior." the
statement said.
It said the measures should be seen as
"unmistakable evidence that we take seriously the
obligation to protect our security interests and
those of our allies."
The officials who made the document available
to the AP said the draft statement was subject to
change but that the commitment to impose the em
bargo appeared to be firm.
The statement said that, in addition to
Nicaragua's alleged attempts to export its revolu
tion elsewhere in Central America, the administra
tion has learned that Nicaragua has established mil
itary ties with Iran.
According to newly declassified intelligence in
formation, Iranian arms and ammunition are at a
North Korean port awaiting shipment to

Nicaragua. Previously, the only known Iranian-
Nicaraguan link was the visit of a high-level Iranian
official to Nicaragua earlier this year.
U.S. officials consider the Iranian connection to
be ominous because of that country's suspected
role in terrorist activities in Lebanon and else
where.
In addition to the trade embargo, Reagan also
planned to suspend a U.S.-Nicaraguan Treaty of
Friendship, Commerce and Navigation. U.S.
diplomatic ties with Nicaragua, however, will
remain intact as an expression of U.S. willingness
to resume a dialogue with Nicaragua should pres
ent conditions change.
According to a secret memorandum from the
State Department to White House national security
adviser Robert McFarlane. also made available to
the AP, the administration is studying additional
sanctions against Nicaragua.
These include a default declaration on
Nicaragua's official debt; a freeze on Nicaragua's
assets in the United States; restrictions on travel by
U.S. citizens to Nicaragua; the closing of a
Nicaraguan trade office; and a "broader ban on
all transactions, according to the document.
