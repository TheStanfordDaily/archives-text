# Spending cuts pass first test
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The
Republican-controlled Senate, on a
50-49 vote that closely followed party
lines, gave symbolic, first-step ap
proval last night to 552 billion in
spending cuts for 1986, including cur
tailment of Social Security cost of
living increases.
But in a sign of struggles still to
come, several Republicans who voted
for the plan were expected to join
Democrats in later efforts to restore
the Social Security increases, reverse
deep cuts in domestic programs and
freeze Pentagon spending authority
at this year's level.
The vote was a victory for Presi
dent Reagan just before his sched
uled departure for an economic sum
mit meeting in Europe, and Senate
Majority Leader Robert Dole of
Kansas said it demonstrated that "for
one brief moment, at least, we agreed
we wanted to cut the deficit by S3OO
billion" over three years.
Reagan, in a statement issued bv
the White House, said the vote
"demonstrated foresight and respon
sible leadership." but warned that
supporters of the package "will have
to stand fast against a long list of
amendments."
Predictably, Democratic critics
took a dim view of the package,
detailing what they said would be a
disastrous result for farmers, Social
Security recipients and' others. The
three-year curtailment of Social Se

curity benefits will "drive another
half a million people into poverty" by
1988, said Sen. Donald Riegle (D-
Mich.)
All 47 Democrats voted against the
blueprint, joined by Republicans
Robert Kasten of Wisconsin and
Charles Mathias of Maryland. The 50
"yes" votes were all provided by
Republicans. The only senator not
voting. Republican John East of
North Carolina, is hospitalized.
Dole said he was uncertain about
the outcome until the votes were cast.
He arranged to have Vice President
George Bush presiding in case his
vote were needed to break a tie.
The only practical effect of the roll
call was to place the controversial
budget before the Senate as a pack
age — open for Republican and
Democratic attempts to dismantle it.
Several Republicans played down
the importance of their vote, describ
ing it as purely procedural. Sen. Mark
Andrews of North Dakota
denounced the budget as a "turkey"
and pledged to seek restoration of
funds for agriculture, housing, health
and other programs.
Republicans Alphonse D" Amato of
New York and Paula Hawkins of
Florida said they voted for the plan
after being assured their amendment
to restore Social Security increases
would be voted on first today. "I
think we can pass that amendment."
said D'Amato.
