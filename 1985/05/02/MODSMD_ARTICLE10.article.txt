Dotson freed again
CHICAGO — Gary Dotson walked out of
prison for the second time in a month yesterday
after his mother posted $10,000 cash bond while
he fights to overturn a conviction for a rape his
accuser now says never happened.
"You can't beat freedom," Dotson told a
crowd that applauded him when he emerged
from prison.
"I'm just running through a revolving door, it
seems," he continued. "I'm beginning to feel like
a pinball."
But his mother, Barbara Dotson, said that al
though further legal battles lie ahead, she feels
that this time her son is out of prison for good.
"I don't know why, I just feel it," she said, mo
ments before posting the bond and boarding an
airplane with attorney Warren Lupel for a brief
flight to the Dixon Correctional Center in north
ern Illinois.
Dotson, 28, who has served six years on rape
and aggravated kidnapping charges, was trans
ferred to the Dixon facility after an April 11

court neanng in which Circuit Judge Richard
Samuels refused to vacate Dotson's conviction
and 25- to 50-year sentence.
Dotson was convicted in 1979. But Cathleen
Crowell Webb now says that she lied about being
raped and wants to see Dotson freed.
Heart care unneeded?
BOSTON — About a third of all suspected
heart attack victims face virtually no risk of dan
gerous complications, and keeping them out of
intensive care units could cut the nation's health
bill by more than $600 million a year, a study
says.
The report says that by interpreting ordinary
electrocardiograms, doctors can accurately
predict which people with chest pain can be
safely treated in less sophisticated and less costly
hospital wards.
Currently, all victims of suspected heart at
tacks — 1.5 million of them a year — are
routinely put into intensive or coronary care
units. They stay there at least until doctors can

figure out whether they've actually had heart at-*
tacks. 1
A new study, conducted at Yale University
School of Medicine, concludes that perhaps 36
percent of the heart patients don't need this high
level of care.
The doctors calculated that hospitals could cut
expenses by $1,140 for each patient they keep
out of intensive care, and the nationwide saving
would be $616 million annually.
Stocks take a fall
NEW YORK — A late selloff concentrated in
blue chips sent the stock market to its fourth
straight loss yesterday, and left the Dow Jones in
dustrial average at its lowest level since mid-
January.
Dow Jones's average of 30 big-name stocks fell
16.01 to 1242.05, its lowest close since it stood at
1227.36 on Jan. 18. In the past four sessions the
average has dropped 42.73 points.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
came to 101.55 million shares, against 111.81
million Tuesday.
