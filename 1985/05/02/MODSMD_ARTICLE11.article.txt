Eight arrested at sit-in
BERKELEY — Eight people, mostly city
council members, were arrested yesterday in
anti-apartheid protests at UC-Berkeley, a school
spokeswoman said.
The arrests resulted from on-going sit-ins that
began more than three weeks ago to protest UC's
$2.4 billion investment in companies that do
business in South Africa.
A spokesman for a student protest committee
said they expected hundreds of people to show
up at sunrise today to encircle University Hall.
After speeches to about 30 people outside the
hall yesterday, the protesters sat down at the
building's entrance and were arrested, UC
spokeswoman Lilia Villanueva said.
Those arrested included Berkeley City Council
members John Denton, Ann Chandler, Don
Jelinek and Wesley Hester, Sr.; El Cerrito City
Council members Jean Siri and Charles Lewis;
Emeryville City Councilman Stuart Flashman; and
John Brauer, chairman of the Berkeley Rent
Control Board.
They were cited for blocking access to a public
entrance and released, Villanueva said.
Alleged Nazi charged
LOS ANGELES — An ailing immigrant
accused of being a Nazi war criminal was ordered
extradited to his native Yugoslavia yesterday on
up to 7,000 murder charges, despite defense con
tentions that an amended Yugoslav indictment
was mistranslated.
Andrija Artukovic, 85, onetime interior mini
ster for the Nazi puppet state of Croatia,
originally had been ordered extradited for just
one murder. But U.S. Magistrate Volnev Brown

amended his order yesterday to include 6,000 to
7,000 murders after Yugoslavian officials sub
mitted additional documents.
Brown rejected bail, saying attorneys had not
shown Artukovic's life was in danger in custody,
but said he may stay in the United States pending
appeal. He ordered the federal prison hospital in
Springfield, Mo., to allow Artukovic's wife Anna
and son Rad to visit him up to eight times a
month.
"I'm disappointed (by the extradition ruling),
but we'll keep slugging away," said Rad Ar
tukovic.
Artukovic's attorney, Gary Fleischman, said
he expects it will take one and a half to three
years to complete all Artukovic's appeals.
Ultimately, it will be up to the secretary of
state to decide on final extradition if the appeals
are denied.
Artukovic, of Seal Beach, has battled extradi
tion for nearly 40 years. The Yugoslavian gov
ernment has said he was responsible for the
deaths of some 700,000 Jews, Gypsies and Serbs.
Artukovic maintains he is innocent.
Plant ruling in question
WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court
agreed yesterday to reconsider a ruling last
December upholding the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission's operating license for the Diablo
Canyon nuclear plant in California.
Opponents of the $5.4 billion plant on the
Pacific Coast near San Luis Obispo petitioned
the court for a new hearing in February, claiming
they had new evidence that the commission il
legally discussed aspects of the licensing at three
closed-door meetings last summer.

The full 11-member court said yesterday that
the plant will be allowed to continue operating
while the case is being reconsidered.
The plant is located less that three miles from
an earthquake fault off the California coast.
After the fault was discovered in 1975, the NRC
ordered the plant redesigned to withstand a much
greater quake force.
Rabbi protests quelled
SAN FRANCISCO — In protest of Soviet
refusal to allow free emigration of Jews, 27 rab
bis and one Baptist pastor were arrested yester
day after chaining themselves to the gates of the
Soviet Consulate.
All were transported in police vans to the
police department's Northern Station, booked
for obstructing the sidewalk and released. The
citation is an infraction, equivalent to getting a
ticket for running a stop sign. All were freed
without bail.
The rabbis, members of the Rabbinical Assem
bly, the largest organization of Conservative rab
bis, were protesting the Soviet Union's continued
oppression of Jews and its failure to permit them
to emigrate.
Today's weather
Today will see cooling and a morning low over
cast layer, clearing only partly by this afternoon.
Highs will be in the 50s to upper 60s. Westerly
winds are expected at 10 to 20 mph. Tonight's
lows will be in the upper 40s and lower 50s, with
tomorrow's highs in the upper 50s and 60s
