## Academics and culture while on the high seas 
### SHERNAZ DAVER 
112 Imagine taking finals as you sail
across the international dateline, or
exchanging information with a
barefoot doctor in China, or riding a
camel by the Sphinx.
These are just some of the experi
ences you can have in the Semester
at-Sea program.
Semester-at-Sea, sponsored by the

University of Pittsburgh and ad
minstered by the Institute for Ship
board Education, provides students
with a unique opportunity to interact
with people from different cultures
and to study around the world. The
program, offered in the fall and
spring, travels to 10 world ports and
includes stops in India, Japan, Spain
and Egypt.

For the 500 students who go each
semester, campus is a 564-foot-long
by 76-foot-wide air-conditioned
ocean liner, the S.S. Universe. 'I he
ship is equipped with classrooms, lab
oratories and a closed circuit TV sys
tem for classes. It also has student
lounges, ball courts and a swimming
pool. Students live in single, double
or triple cabins and frequently use the
library, student union and theater.
The ship, equipped with a 135-
member crew, offers medical and stu
dent personnel services.
Semester-at-Sea enables students
to integrate classroom academics with
aspects of different cultures. Junior
Larry Weber, who attended the pro
gram last fall, calls it "culture in
filtrated by the academics." Tim
Hartman, another junior who partici
pated that fall, said he took a philoso
phy class that discussed acupuncture
techniques the class saw in practice at
a Taiwanese clinic.
Students generally take 12 semes
ter hours and spend half the time at
sea, half in various countries. Classes
have from 20 to 30 students and are
offered in areas such as anthropology,
economics and political science.
Small classes that teach Mandarin or
how to play the sitar, an Indian
string instrument similar to a guitar,
add to students' knowledge of
countries they visit.
Weber, an English major, and
Hartman, a self-designed major in
history and philosophy of science,
were more satisfied with the pro
gram's academics.
But to some, Semester-at-Sea can
also be a "Semester-at-Ease": a plea
sure cruise with low academic stand
ards.

Jeanette Heinz, a junior who par
ticipated in the spring '83 program,
said some of the teachers were "not
up to par." An international relations
and communication major, she added
it is easy to "blow off classes and sit
hy the pool, but if you read the books
and take advantage of what is in front
of you, you can learn an awful lot."
The faculty, numbering between 40
and 50, are chosen by the University
of Pittsburgh and are often consid
ered experts in particular areas. Many
of the professors are on sabbatical or
on personal leave from other univer
sities.
Interport lecturers, generally
natives of countries on the ship's
itinerary, join the ship at an earlier
port to give students an introduction

to the countries. A Japanese interport
lecturer may inform students of gift
giving customs there; an Indian lec
turer may warn them to not drink tap
water in that country.
There is the potential for staff
members and students to interact
closely with each other. According to
past program participants, most of
the faculty spend time outside class
with students, and it is not unusual to
discuss Kabuki theater over beers
with a professor.
Semester-at-Sea provides opportu
nities for creativity and fun. When the
ship crosses the equator, all aboard
join in the traditional Neptune Day
celebration, a ritual in which students
and staff members are smeared with
seaweed and stale vegetables.

Some of the students work on the
ship's newspaper. The Helm; others
publish funny magazines about their
shipboard experiences. Heinz, who
ran an aerobics class, said the pro
gram is "just what each one makes of
it."
Students sometimes form strong
friendships both on board and in the
many countries they visit. Hartman,
Heinz and Weber still keep in
contact with their shipboard friends.
Hartman said he regularly cor
responds with a Ceylonese woman
and a Taiwanese family — people he
met for a few hours during his visits to
their countries.
Why Semester-at-Sea?


Stanford junior Larry Weber, a participant in the Semester-at-Sea pro
gram last fall, visits with an Orthodox Jew outside the Old City ir
Jerusalem.


Junior Jeanette Heinz, another Stanford participant in Semester-at-Sea, meets a native family during her
1983 stay in India.
Weber said he turned down
Stanford-in-Italy for Semester-at-Sea
because "Europe is more accessible
than the pyramids of Egypt and the
Orient." He, as well as Hartman and
Heinz, said they wanted a taste of the
different cultures and people in the
world.
Poverty was one of the things stu
dents said they had to face in Third
World countries such as Sri Lanka
and India. Heinz said that although
she had heard about starving people

in India, seeing them was a completely
different experience that no book
could provide.
Weber said he wished his program
had stopped in India — the ship
bypassed the country because Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi had just been
assassinated. He said a look at India's
poverty would have done the students
on board "a lot of good."
Weber added that Semester-at-Sea
takes some students to places very
foreign to their experiences. In Sri
Lanka, for instance, the largest road
"is a back road." Heinz concurred,
saying, "We have a slanted vision that
everyone has two cars. It is not like

that in the majority of our world."
Hartman said he admired the
Ceylonese people, saying that though
they are poor, "they have a positive
frame of mind to look on the bright
side."
Cost may be the biggest problem
with Semester-at-Sea. The program
costs between $8,845 and $9,575.
Although the program does award
scholarships and financial aid, stu
dents have to pay a large part of the
cost. However, "if you want it badly,
you can do it," said Hartman, who
said he worked all summer to pay for
his trip.
