When Residential Education put Pi Beta Phi
on probation last week for violating University
alcohol policy and anti-hazing codes, some
people were surprised — especially members of
the sorority.
As usually happens when the University puts
campus groups on probation, Norm Robinson,
associate dean of Student Affairs for Residential
Education, opted to punish Pi Beta Phi before
meeting with most of the sorority's members, let
alone giving them a chance to defend themselves.
The Pi Phi case is indicative of a larger problem
here: the lack of due process for student groups.
Instead of a guilty-until-innocent approach to
questions of student conduct, Stanford should
adopt guidelines that enable student groups to
meet directly with Res Ed before the University
takes disciplinary action. Individuals have this
right, but for some reason i. does not extend to
student groups.
In the case of the Pi Phis, an investigation is
now being conducted by the Intersororitv Coun

cil (ISC). When it finishes the probe, the ISC will
make a recommendation either to take the group
off probation or to take more serious measures.
Meanwhile, the probation prevents the group
from meeting on campus for anything but official
business.
Non-Greek student groups have also been sub
jected to the short end of the punishment paddle.
Last fall's suspension of the the Stanford Progres
sive Alliance (SPA) by the University spawned
confusion for SPA members as well as for those
leveling charges against the group.
But help may be on the way. A resolution
aimed at establishing a due process system,
authored by Senator Jeff Soukup, was approved
by the ASSU Senate last quarter. The resolution
asks the Student Conduct Legislative Council
(SCLC) to establish specific guidelines on how
student groups are treated. It also calls for a defi
nition of probation and when it can be used, and
asks the SCLC to establish an investigative body
to deal with student groups.
