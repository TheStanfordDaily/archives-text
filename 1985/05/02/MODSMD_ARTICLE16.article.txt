# Small doses of Reagan insults accepted by the public
## 
### 
My initial reaction to the controversy surrounding Pres
ident Reagan's decision to visit the Bitburg cemetery in
May is actually more disturbing to me than the decision it
self. I didn't respond to this latest of Reagan's forays into
the realm of fatuous insensitivity with clenched teeth and
a quickened pulse as 1 have in the past. Instead, I sighed,
shook my head in exasperated disapproval and skipped
ahead to the movie reviews. The issue struck me not as
unimportant or trivial in itself, but as banal and almost to
be expected given the president's record on such matters.
It's not as if the Reagan administration has been reluc
tant until now to engage in the time-honored conservative
practice of baiting minorities. Reagan's unprecedented
and utterly incomprehensible first-term decision to grant
tax-exempt status to private schools which blatantly dis
criminate against blacks stands out in my mind as a perfect
example, but there have been numerous other incidents as
well. The'president hobnobbed with fundamentalist
Christian ministers who cast aspersions on the legitimacy
of the Jewish faith during his 1980 campaign, creating a
mini-uproar that has since been forgotten. The adminis
tration has been (forgive my blasphemy) quite liberal in
heaping its scorn upon minority groups. Witness recent
Reagan appointee Eileen Gardner, who was slated to
become special assistant to Education Secretary William
Bennett but was pressured to resign after it was revealed
that she thought handicapped people are deserving of their
misfortune, writing (among other equally intelligent
"a person's external circumstances .. . fit his level
cie limits of both patience
and memory.

Clearly, Reagan's now infamous Bitburg decision is
outrageous, but it is simply one more in a whole catalogue
of such outrages. The question is not whom the president
has offended, but whom he has not offended. And the
puzzle is not why this particular bit of outrageousness has
stirred such a sustained and politically damaging outcry
(rating Time and Newsweek covers, no less), but why pre
vious outrageousness has not been equally villified. One

solution to that puzzle lies in the peculiar effect Ronald
Reagan has had on national sensitivity in general, the con
sequences of which are manifested in my own lack of reac
tion to the Bitburg fiasco, and I suspect, in a correspond
ing lack of initial reaction in others as well.
The Reagan White House has been praised by friend
and foe alike for its remarkably effective ability to create
and sell an image of the president to the American people.
A powerful element of Reagan's appeal stems from his
adept manipulation of his image. The president-devotes a
good deal of time to looking presidential; he spent much
of the 1984 campaign running around in Europe and else

where, attending colorful ceremonies and saying nice,
empty presidential things. Indeed, the emphasis this ad
ministration puts on such matters is reflected in its recent
decision to make a consolation visit to a concentration
camp. Newsweek reported that one Reagan aide was all
but ecstatic over the photo opportunities offered by
Bergen-Belsen because it "offers a much more visual ex
ample of what happened than Dachau does."
Given the administration's singular attention to the
nuances of political imagery, there is something odd about
its utter inability to shake a deep-seated perception
among many that it couldn't care less about anyone who
isn't a true-blue American WASP. Surely an organization
so conscious of symbolism would be capable of grasping
the importance of certain symbols to minority groups.
And yet the administration's consistent disregard —
indeed, disdain — for these symbols would seem to belie
its reputed expertise in the art of cultivating the proper
image.
It strikes me that Reagan's recurring "blunders" of in
sensitivity to minorities would not be tolerated by the
image-makers on his staff if these blunders were not
tolerated by the American people. It strikes me that per
haps Reagan and crew have correctly surmised that a
good portion of the American people don't mind a little
insensitivity and intolerance toward minorities from time
to time, so long as it comes in small doses. Thus the ad
ministration has been less than vigilant in ensuring that
the president is seen as a man of all the people. Reagan
has sometimes been accused of making Americans com
fortably with their prejudices, but the
reciprocal. The American people have made the Reagan

administration comfortable with its selective insensitivity.
By and large, the president's successive "blunders" have
been met with raucous protest from the offended arid
deafening silence from the not-offended. No slight or slur
has been deemed serious enough for a reappraisal of af
fable old Ron; his approval ratings have remained high-. »
Hence my surprise at the wrath visited upon Reagan for
the Bitburg decision, and hence my distress at my own rc :
action to it. For I realize that the national tolerance for
Reagan's record of insults has dulled my own sensitivity to
such matters. Yesterday's furor has degenerated to
today's frustrated shake of the head. I have come to ex
pect reckless insensitivity from the White House, and that
expectation is disturbing.
That the president and his surrogates could have left "so
long a trail of callousness without being challenged until
now is shameful. It is shameful for Reagan, and for this
nation as a whole. It remains to be seen whether this isslie
will have a lasting effect on Reagan's image, or whether jt
will be one more outrage that fades from memory. But fijr
now, it is fitting that this particular issue has marked'<l
turning point in the perception of Reagan's
president of the United States has demonstrated an awfal
lack of regard for the victims of the Holocaust. Comparim»
any modern-day nation to Nazi Germany is always a dan
gerous enterprise; spurious parallels are all too easjlv

My initial reaction to the controversy surrounding Pres
ident Reagan's decision to visit the Bitburg cemetery in
May is actually more disturbing to me than the decision it
self. I didn't respond to this latest of Reagan's forays into
the realm of fatuous insensitivity with clenched teeth and
a quickened pulse as 1 have in the past. Instead, I sighed,
shook my head in exasperated disapproval and skipped
ahead to the movie reviews. The issue struck me not as
unimportant or trivial in itself, but as banal and almost to
be expected given the president's record on such matters.
It's not as if the Reagan administration has been reluc
tant until now to engage in the time-honored conservative
practice of baiting minorities. Reagan's unprecedented
and utterly incomprehensible first-term decision to grant
tax-exempt status to private schools which blatantly dis
criminate against blacks stands out in my mind as a perfect
example, but there have been numerous other incidents as
well. The'president hobnobbed with fundamentalist
Christian ministers who cast aspersions on the legitimacy
of the Jewish faith during his 1980 campaign, creating a
mini-uproar that has since been forgotten. The adminis
tration has been (forgive my blasphemy) quite liberal in
heaping its scorn upon minority groups. Witness recent
Reagan appointee Eileen Gardner, who was slated to
become special assistant to Education Secretary William
Bennett but was pressured to resign after it was revealed
that she thought handicapped people are deserving of their
misfortune, writing (among other equally intelligent
"a person's external circumstances .. . fit his level
cie limits of both patience
and memory.

Clearly, Reagan's now infamous Bitburg decision is
outrageous, but it is simply one more in a whole catalogue
of such outrages. The question is not whom the president
has offended, but whom he has not offended. And the
puzzle is not why this particular bit of outrageousness has
stirred such a sustained and politically damaging outcry
(rating Time and Newsweek covers, no less), but why pre
vious outrageousness has not been equally villified. One

solution to that puzzle lies in the peculiar effect Ronald
Reagan has had on national sensitivity in general, the con
sequences of which are manifested in my own lack of reac
tion to the Bitburg fiasco, and I suspect, in a correspond
ing lack of initial reaction in others as well.
The Reagan White House has been praised by friend
and foe alike for its remarkably effective ability to create
and sell an image of the president to the American people.
A powerful element of Reagan's appeal stems from his
adept manipulation of his image. The president-devotes a
good deal of time to looking presidential; he spent much
of the 1984 campaign running around in Europe and else

where, attending colorful ceremonies and saying nice,
empty presidential things. Indeed, the emphasis this ad
ministration puts on such matters is reflected in its recent
decision to make a consolation visit to a concentration
camp. Newsweek reported that one Reagan aide was all
but ecstatic over the photo opportunities offered by
Bergen-Belsen because it "offers a much more visual ex
ample of what happened than Dachau does."
Given the administration's singular attention to the
nuances of political imagery, there is something odd about
its utter inability to shake a deep-seated perception
among many that it couldn't care less about anyone who
isn't a true-blue American WASP. Surely an organization
so conscious of symbolism would be capable of grasping
the importance of certain symbols to minority groups.
And yet the administration's consistent disregard —
