Never made
A rumor gained circulation last
Thursday to the effect that Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy said
to me, "Give them two weeks and
they'll calm down." This was reputed
to have been his comment about the
SOSA sit-in.
A Daily reporter, to his credit,
called me that evening to ask, "Was
the rumor true?" The reporter, like
so many others, recognized that such
a comment would be out of charac
ter for Don Kennedy and thought it
wise to check its accuracy. He was
right. Don Kennedy said no such
thing, to me or to anyone else. And
to The Daily's credit it wasn't re
ported.
The issues raised by SOSA do not
invite, nor have they received. Hip
comments. To the contrary, they
merit the full and serious attention of
the Stanford community. It is to the
credit of our university that that is
happening.

Not honoring SS
I am quite disgusted at the view
point written by Donna Reganbaum
in last Thursday's Daily. This article
expressed her disgust at President
Reagan's proposed visit to Kol
moshoe, an East German cemetary
in which Nazis are buried, claiming
that Reagan's place is with the vic
tims of World War 11. and not the
perpetrators; that his visit implicitly
honors those who killed six million
Jews.
This article fails to realize,
however, that the true victims of war
are all that are concerned. Anyone
who dies fighting in war dies tragi
cally. Sorrow must be felt not only
for those who are tortured, but for
those who could be so numbed, so
divorced from life, so as to be capa
ble of performing the torture. To
single out one group is to ignore the
true horror of war.
There are some further points to
consider. The 40th anniversary of
the battle of Okinawa was recently
"celebrated." At this event, survivors

from both sides could be seen
embracing each other. There was no
question of moral correctness, no
question of victor and victim, in
volved. Yet, if something similar was
to even be considered that involved
ex-German soldiers, let alone Nazis,
it would not be tolerated. Why?
Surely this is not because the
Japanese treated Allied prisoners
more humanely? Furthermore, there
is the question of the Holocaust.
Clearly, it is the high point of
genocide, but it is not the only in
stance. Why is there a never-ending
influx of Holocaust movies, while
nothing is ever said about the
Turkish massacre of the Armenians,
a massacre in which nearly 2 million
were killed? Could it be that
America is not full of influential
Armenians?
The Holocaust is a high point of
evil, yet this does not diminish the
tragedy of all who died during the
war. Reagan's visit to Kolmoshoe
must not be construed as some im
plicit honoring of the SS, nor as an
affont to those who died at the hands

of the Nazis. Rather, it must be seen
for what it really is, viz., a statement
that all who die in war are the true
victims, regardless of side, and that
only by realizing this can full recon
ciliation of opposing forces can oc
cur.

Workshop explained
In his letter to University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy (The Daily,
April 3), which was published in The
Daily on Wednesday, April 3, Biol
ogy Prof. Robert Schimke mentions
the Hoover Institution. I realize that
Kennedy replied to the questions
raised in Schimke's letter at the
April 4 meeting of the Faculty Sen
ate, but his remarks were not re
ported in The Daily story about that
meeting. The purpose of this letter,
therefore, is to set the public record
straight as far as The Daily is con
cerned.
The meeting at the law school

was part of a three-way workshop
organized by Prof. James March and
co-sponsored by the Department of
state, the chief of Naval Opera
tions, and Stanford. The subject of
the workshop was politico-military
decisionmaking. The participants
included distinguished scholars and
high-ranking government officials
(including a number of military
personnel at the policy-making
level), as well as students. Stanford
faculty who presented papers were
March, Prof. Kenneth Arrow and
Prof. Alexander George. The
workshop was not publicized, but all
interested members of the Stanford
academic community who asked to
attend were included.
The Hoover Institution was not a
sponsor of the workshop; because
March is a distinguished senior fel
low at the institution and member of
the Stanford faculty, we provided
logistical support. The scheduling
conflict about the meeting room
resulted from a clerical error by a
temporary employee in the law
school who was acting in response to

a request from March's staff. Securr
ity for the event was provided by ;
Stanford's Department of Public â€¢
Safety; it was augmented by two ,
State Department personnel on
special assignment to provide extra
protection for a participant who hacl
been the recipient of threats on his'
life.
