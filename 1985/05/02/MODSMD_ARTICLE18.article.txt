## Ask what the military is trying to get 
### 
Those who agreed with the editorial, "The re
search question" (The Daily. April 29) — and
there are many who do — often believe that the
central question regarding military funding for uni
versity research is. "Will a funding program aug
ment or restrict researchers' abilities to pursue
•free' scholarly inquiry?" A significant number of

these people benefit directly or indirectly from De
partment of Defense contracts to schools, and they
argue for further such funding from positions ot
"integrity" similar to the one professed by Daily
editorial writers.
What is "integrity"? And what other questions
about military funding might be central?
Perhaps we might ask — and this especially
means .isk ourselves what will the I ! .S. military
do with knowledge gained through the more than
SI billion per year in mm-classified research it's
currently sponsoring? (Stanford got about $30 mil
lion from the DoD in l l )N4. the fifth highest for any
school.)
And what are the armed forces and other institu
tions of violence doing now with the "basic" re
search results of 10-20 years ago? MIRVs were
invented at Ml I Napalm was first produced at Har
vard. Stanford's Applied Flectronics Laboratory
pioneered many electronic warfare ideas which
were rather rapidly integrated into the U.S. pro
gram ot bombing North Vietnam. A professor here
is helping design improved guidance systems for
cruise missiles (more non-classified work). How
many Hastern-bloc university faculty, staff and stu
dents have contributed to the enormous arsenals ot
their nations?

The Daily tells us that military programs like the
Strategic Defense Initiative can and should be
viewed from different perspectives, including those
of the researcher and the DoD. Agreed. Would it
were that the majority of researchers funded by the
DoD did this. Most researchers make little or no
effort to investigate the military's plans for their re
search products, even with a wealth of available
public information, instead preferring to downplay
or deny any military usefulness of their work and
focus our attentions on numerous "beneficial" ap
plications of this "basic research" (see most any
issue of Campus Report).

And do we really want what we'll be getting? More
deadly weapons? Improved pacification programs
for Third World rural populations? Increased
efficiency in procuring underwear and toothpaste?

Perhaps we want to ask the question. "If I get the
•free inquiry I desire and my DoD funding agency
(or the National Aeronautics and Space Adminis
tration. Department of Energy and National In
stitutes of Health, which all do research for military
purposes) gets what it's hoping for. what will we all
really be getting? And do we really want what we'll
be getting? More deadly weapons? Improved
pacification programs for Third World rural
populations? Increased efficiency in procuring un
derwear and toothpaste for enlisted personnel?"
I would support and applaud members of the
Faculty Senate's Committee on Research who ask

themselves, "How can we best provide resources to
the University community which will facilitate its
members making well-informed and carefully con
sidered funding decisions?"
A group is now compiling a "Sourcebook for
People Facing Life Decisions Related to Military
Funding." We hope to publish and distribute this to
all Stanford community members by this fall. Sup
porting such an effort, whether by recommending
University financial assistance or Faculty Senate
resolutions, is one thing the Committee on Re
search can consider. Will we ask them to do this?
I agree in full with The Daily editorial's conclu-

sion: If we determine what role we can play in
military programs, we will be better equipped to
pursue — or forego — military support. Do we
have the courage to ask what the military hopes to
get from us? To ask what role our military and
other militaries are playing in the world? To ask
ourselves and each other what we really want and
what we need to do, to risk, to get it?
There are many who do ask these questions, so I
feel that yes, we do, or can, have that courage.
