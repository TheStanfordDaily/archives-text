Following a closed meeting yesterday with 13 members
of the Board of Trustees and University President Donald
Kennedy, representatives of Stanford Out of South Africa
(SOSA) called trustees "open-minded" about divestment
of University funds from companies that do business in
South Africa.
The meeting marked the first time in recent years that a
group of trustees met with students outside a formal board
meeting to discuss a particular issue.
"They (the trustees) seemed to be really open-minded
and to have really honest questions," said Steve Phillips,
an organi/er of SOSA.
Board President William Kimball characterized
the meeting as" a dialogue, very useful, very informative,
very interesting, good questions, good answers. I'm very
much impressed by the knowledge and concern of these
students."
Phillips said the trustees "probably feel it (divestment)
is not the best way, but most of them don't know that for
sure. . . . They seem willing to be convinced that it is."
However, Kimball said, "I don't think it's fair to say
that there is serious consideration (of divestment). We
haven't even considered it as a full board."
Although he has opposed divestment in the past, Kim
ball said he is "open-minded regarding the issue."
However, his open-mindedness is not an indication that

he is changing his position, he added.
"I want to see very clearly how divestment will help the
black people in South Africa," Kimball said. "We need
more information on the chain, that divestment can cause
A and Band so forth."
Trustee Melvin Lane said, "We raised a lot of questions
that they (SOSA members) are going to try to answer."
Trustee Edward Ginzton said, "I am worried about
more than simply divestment. I'm worried about what will
happen after divestment."
Phillips said, "We're going to try to get together a
packet before the forum to answer all those questions,"
Most of the trustees left immediately after the meeting
and refused to comment or answer questions, saying only
that they were looking forward to the forum on divest
ment planned for Tuesday at either Frost Amphitheatre
or the Quad.
Walter Geys, a student member of the board's Commit
tee on Investment, said, "At this stage, it (the meeting)
was a discussion. This is an introduction to the forum."
The meeting gave "a clear indication that the Board of
Trustees is not a monolith," said SOS A member David
Troutt. "I think inroads are apparent," he said.
Troutt emphasized that "bringing about incremental
degrees of awareness" on the part of trustees is more
likely than influencing quick changes of opinion regarding
divestment.
"Things will change. I'm sure of that," Geys said.

"I here will he .1 lot of procedural
chanties on how investments are
made It may not he divestment, but
there will he a lot ot positive acts "
It will take "a lot ot pressure,
physical presence, voice . . . well
loundcd arguments. rational, con
crete arguments to bring ahout such
changes. ( ie\s said.
• \\ e' re in .1 position to make an ex
cellent case tor divestment, and our
argument won't tall on deal ears."
1 routt said.
Although presented at the meeting,
SOSA s demand tor disclosure ol
personal investment portfolios of
trustees was not discussed.
I \plaining that being a trustee is
"not a public job. its a volunteer
job." Kimball stated that he would
not ask the trustees to make such dis
closures.
Kimball said that because "the
chain (ol influence) is so tenuous."
there is no real conflict of interest in
volved in owning stock in a corpora
tion and voting on divestment from
