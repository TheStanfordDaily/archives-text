## Thompson fires 6th-lowest at Pac-10s Golfers end up in 4th 
### KEN STEVENS Staff sportswriter 
Co-favorite UCLA saved its best
golf for the last day, as the men from
Westwood charged past third-round
leader Oregon to capture the pres
tigious Pacific 10 Conference cham
pionship yesterday at the Walla Walla
(Wash.) Country Club.
The Cardinal men, who fired the
low score of 364 in Tuesday's third
round, equaled that output yesterday
but never seriously challenged the
Bruins, finishing 16 shots back in
fourth place at 1,466.

UCLA, which trailed Oregon by
six shots heading into the final round,
played its best golf of the tournament
yesterday, shooting 355 for the day.
The Bruins finished the tournament
at 1.448, six shots better than second
place Oregon.
The Bruins were paced once again
by Ail-American Duffy Waldorf, who
captured the individual championship
by three shots. Waldorf — who seems
to collect tournament championships
at the same rate that furniture collects
dust — fired a 67 yesterday to go with
earlier rounds of 71, 70 and 71.

Oregon, the Cinderella team of the
tournament for the first three rounds,
was unable to pull off the upset,
though its second-place finish was an
achievement in itself. The Ducks' 368
was the eighth-worst score yesterday
and was their worst round of the
tournament. Had the Oregon men
been able to capture the champion
ship, they would have received an
automatic berth in the NCAA cham
pionships.
Arizona State fired yesterday's low
round (355) to finish in third place at
1455, one shot behind Oregon. The
Sun Devils accounted for the tourna
ment's two lowest rounds (Monday's
opening-round 352 and yesterday's
355) but were unable to overcome a
second-round 377 and a third-round
371.
Stanford's fourth-place finish was a
decline from last year's Pac-10 cham
pionships, when the Cardinal
captured second place. Stanford
Coach Tim Schaaf did not seem too
disappointed, however. "We played
steadily but never had a hot round,"
he said. "We are still confident of an
NCAA bid."
Barring a change in the NCAA's
policy, the Cardinal men should
receive a berth to the NCAA cham
pionships May 22-25 in Greenlands,
Fla. In past seasons, six teams have
been taken from District 8. Following
the Pac-10s — the last regular season
tournament — the Cardinal is solidly
in fourth place.
Oregon's George Daves followed
Waldorf in the individual competi
tion, capturing second place with a
282 total. USC's Sam Randolph
finished in third place at 283.
Stanford's Doug Thompson fired a
72 yesterday to finish in sixth place at
289. Thompson's teammate Scott
Erickson also shot a 72 in the final
round. Erickson finished in a tie for
ninth place for the tournament at
291. Other Stanford scores included
Tim Robinson at 293, Carl Wagner
and John Dickey at 294 and Rich
Marik at 308.
Following the tournament, the Pac
-10 All-Conference team was chosen
by the school's coaches. Robinson,
the Cardinal's most consistent golfer
this season, was selected on the first
team.
