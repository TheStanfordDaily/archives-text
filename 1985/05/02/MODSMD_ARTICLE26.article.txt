# Netters to host SDSU

### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
The Stanford women's tennis team
returns to action today after a 12-day
break from team matches. It returns
healthier, but minus freshman Anna
Ivan, who quit the team last week.
Stanford's match with San Diego
State, scheduled to start at 1 p.m.,
will be its second-to-last tune-up
before the NCAA championships,
which begin May 16 in Oklahoma
City. The Cardinal hosts UCLA
Sunday at noon in its final regular
season match.
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan
said the team is in "pretty good;
shape," especially after the up-and
down course of events last week. The.
Cardinal, which earlier this week
assumed the No. 1 ranking, defeated
then-No. 1 USC last Saturday, but
after the match Brennan announced
Ivan was suspended "indefinitely!''!
Two days later, Ivan quit.
As far as San Diego State goes,-
Stanford undoubtedly enters the
match a heavy favorite. Still, Brennan
isn't taking the Aztecs— a team wrth
which the Cardinal traditionally has
close matches — too lightly.
"The new rankings came out a tip
they are ranked sixth," Brennan said
of the Aztecs, who Stanford defeated
7-2 at San Diego two months ago.
"So they're certainly nothing to
sneeze at. We're obviously thinking
about the NCAAs, but we still have
two big matches left."
With Ivan out of the lineup perrr(a;
nently, junior Alyce Werdel will
move into the singles lineup at N0.;6
and push Kay Tittle,
Savides and Leigh Anne Eldredge ttfl
up a notch. Werdel will also pliry
doubles with Patty Fendick at No. 2"-
With the NCAAs two weeks away,
Brennan said he has been concentrat
ing on doubles and conditioning. "We
have a new doubles team (Fendiok
and Werdel) and want to give them
some practice," he said. "We also
want to stay in condition because it
will probably be hot in Oklahoma
City, and it's a grueling tournament."

departed freshman standout Anna Ivan. Werdel will play No. 6 singles
and team with Patty Fendick at No. 2 doubles.
