The Stanford Fleet Street Singers
— Songs of the Stanford Red not
rated
Beneath the seemingly peaceful
Stanford scene that so many tourists
and parents see every year lurks a
growing trend toward chaos. Sit-ins,
rallies, ASSU revolutions and, of
course, the Great Fleet
Street/Mendicants Gang Wars. So
we're not gonna be caught in the
middle of it. Our Fleet Street con
nection got us an album before our
Mendicants connection. Enough

said. The Fleets' new album is the
perfect addition to an\ graduating
senior's record collection — side
one's traditional Stanford melodies
are the only way to learn songs (like
the Alma Mater — what Alma
Mater?!) that you'll spend the rest
of your life singing at your
relatives'. You get the "Fight
Song," the famous "Come Join The
Band/The Dirty Golden Bear
Monstermix," and"The Cardinal Is
Waving" — songs of great historical
importance to those of the Stanford

tradition. And in case that doesn't
float your boat, side two is chock
full of more interesting, more in
spired. more diverse singalongs like
"Istanbul (Was Constantinople)."
the "Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood
Theme." and others. The sonics are
excellent, the arrangements are ex
cellent. Buy one for your alumni
grandparents and catch the Singers
tomorrow in the Branner Dining
Hall.

Anthony Braxton — Seven
Standards ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆
Anthony Braxton — like many
modern greats these days — has put
together this album of standards.
Braxton, like David Murray, who
recently released a similar record,
has a strong feeling for where he
stands in the jazz tradition. Whereas
Wynton Marsalis rejects much
recent jazz and is to a large degree a
musical reactionary, Braxton con
siders his music to be an extension
and an outgrowth of the music's

long history. The music, for Brax
ton, is self-defining in three ways. It
defines itself, the musician's self and
(this one many people don't under
stand, including Wynton) the
musician's culture. Braxton's
playing is in great form, moving
from straight bop to complex
abstraction to beautiful ballad
soloing on "Spring Is Here." Dizzy
Gillespie's "You Go To My Head"
is the high point of the record, with
Braxton smoking and Hank Jones'
piano work impeccable as usual.

Jones is especially potent on Clif
ford Jordan's "Toy." Rufus Reed
plays masterfully as always and
turns in several fine solos, especially
on the great Clifford Brown tune,
"Joy Spring." Drummer Victor
Lewis is unspectacular but very
solid throughout. This is a brilliant
album, and Wynton M. could learn
a lot from it, and especially from
Anthony Braxton, a true master of
creative music.

Various artists — Covers ☆ ☆ ☆
Hardcore punk has its place. So
does novelty music. In fact,
hardcore's best moments so far have
been spent destroying other bands'
material in the name of anarchy:
notable examples are the Lords of
the New Church's "Like a Virgin"
and the Circle Jerks' "Jerks on 45."
So if you buy one punk album (or
less) a year, make sure it's an
amusing one. This could be this

year's pick. Twenty songs from
other bands, shattered in the usual
punk tradition, only 10 or so of
which are worth listening to. But
most of them are fun enough the
first time, and a few ("100 Bottles
of Beer"and "It's a Small World"
especially) make the whole record
worthwhile. Granted, it's trash. Not
just unartistic trash — unmusical
trash. But that was punk's original
point anyway, so nobody's com

plaining. "Covers" demonstrates
several important points: If a
hardcore song is sufficiently funny,
it's good. If it's a remake of a song
you haven't heard before, or an un
funny original tune, it's not so good.
Punk's main strength is its ability of
self-parody: Its nothing-is-sacred
philosophy rarely expresses itself as
well as on remakes like these.
