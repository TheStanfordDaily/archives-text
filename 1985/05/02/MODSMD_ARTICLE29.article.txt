## An interview with author of 'Superior Women' 
### 
When Alice Adams, the San Fran
cisco novelist and short story writer,
first started writing, she used to write
in a prone position, lying on her
unmade bed.
She considers this completely
crazy, on reflection.
A lot has changed in Adams' life
since she sold her first story to the
now-defunct Charm magazine
when she was 32 years old. Adams
was so excited by the sale, she says,
that she promptly divorced her hus
band and fell in love twice in that first
year. "I loved 32," she says.
It seems typical of many young
writers' experience that a long time
passes between that first sale an a
next one. This was also true for
Adams, but in the interim, Adams
refined her method of writing. She
now works in a study, sitting upright
at a desk.
Adams has a simple answer as to
why she persevered for so long as an
unknown writer, living on the
proceeds of part-time work and
raising her son as a single parent.
"I'm obviously some sort of obses
sional maniac," she claims. But she
hardly resembles one, at least while
she discussed her life and work in a
recent interview with The Daily.
Where others might speak of their
dedication or discipline in enduring
long years without recognition or
money, it's characteristic of Adams to
dismiss her motives with a self
deprecating remark. Sitting in a
windowed alcove in her apartment
near the Presidio, a tranquil neigh

borhood of large houses and stunning
Bay views, Adams is an attractive
woman of 58 who is remarkably
modest about her achievements.
A frequent contributor to The
New Yorker, Adams has published
five novels and two collections of
short stories. A third story collection,
•'Return Trips," is due out in the fall.
Adams' unassuming nature is espe
cially surprising because her latest novel,
"Superior Women," recently accom
plished the rare feat of receiving wide
critical acclaim and becoming a best
seller.
"She's one of the most eminent
writers working today," says English
Prof. John L'Heureux, director of the
Creative Writing Program here.
"What she does is take the most
mundane situation and transform it
into something remarkable. It is a
major accomplishment."
Like the rest of us, Adams' charac
ters regularly fall in love with the
wrong people, trust those they
shouldn't and unexpectedly lose
their jobs. She brings us close in focus
to them so we can see their reasoning,
take part in their impulsiveness, make
their same mistakes. It is partly this
"deftness in character rendering," as
L'Heureux puts it, that makes her
work extraordinary. We care about
those she writes about and, in the of
ten chaotic and banal details of their
lives, we can usually discern real spir
itual growth.
"Superior Women," for example,
is an addictively readable novel that
follows the fortunes of four Radcliffe

women from their freshman year during
World War II to the present day.
(The Virginia-born Adams is a

Radcliffe graduate.) The book is a
wonderful and deceptive work that
mingles a scathing social commentary

with scenes of sex, scandal and politi
cal intrigue. Paperback rights to the
book were recently sold for a six
figure sum.
When popular success finally
arrived, it seemed remote, almost
unimportant, Adams says, as though
it were happening to someone else. "1
feel as though I were someone I've
written about," she says. While her
new-found success means that she has
an "awful lot" more money than she
ever did before, it also means that
more demands are made on her time,
which she must now guard jealously
in order to be able to work. And this
work is never easy: She says she has
trouble writing "only every day."
Adams's literary roots are diverse.
"I am a Southern writer, but not only
a Southern writer. I'm definitely
looking around for new directions,"
she says.
Because of its length and scope,
"Superior Women" was cumbersome
and difficult to write, Adams says,
and it is not a form she plans on using
again. So her new novel will be, in
contrast, "short and funny." Adams
says she finds writing humor surpris
ingly difficult. She wonders whether
the effort will be successful.
A recent short story, "A Public
Pool," also marks a profound change
in direction for the writer. The story
takes the form of an interior
monologue of a young woman named
Maxine, self-conscious and over
weight, whose life centers around
her neighborhood public pool.
Presumably because it represented

such a radical departure from the
sexy, more sophisticated characters
and style of her other work, the piece
was turned down everywhere, ac
cording to Adams, before finding its
way into print in Mother Jones, the
San Francisco-based magazine.
Indeed, Adams says that the maga
zine had been advised to refrain from
publishing the work altogether, "for
fear of damaging my image."
She laughs incredulously as she
talks about this, adding that she was
even told that publishing such a piece
before publishing "Superior Women"
might irrevocably damage the recep
tion of the book.
Adams obviously delights in such
stories — her own life seems to take
place comfortably removed from the
squabbles of the publishing world.
She shares her large tranquil apart
ment with Robert McNie. an in terror
designer who has been her com
panion for 21 years, and three cats.
Books are stacked up on the coffee
table and paintings by her son line the
walls.
Adams calls her old writing habits
"true insanity," recalling all those
days spent in the unmade bed. She
prefers her new arrangement, in
which a cat named Ferg sits on. her
typewriter as she works. "We col
laborate on writing," she says. An
astute critic, apparently, this large
and lazy brown cat always "lets me
know when she thinks I'm messing
up."

dedication or discipline in enduring
long years without recognition or
money, it's characteristic of Adams to
dismiss her motives with a self
deprecating remark. Sitting in a
windowed alcove in her apartment
near the Presidio, a tranquil neigh

borhood of large houses and stunning
Bay views, Adams is an attractive
woman of 58 who is remarkably
modest about her achievements.
A frequent contributor to The
New Yorker, Adams has published
five novels and two collections of
short stories. A third story collection,
•'Return Trips," is due out in the fall.
Adams' unassuming nature is espe
cially surprising because her latest novel,
"Superior Women," recently accom
plished the rare feat of receiving wide
critical acclaim and becoming a best
seller.
"She's one of the most eminent
writers working today," says English
Prof. John L'Heureux, director of the
Creative Writing Program here.
"What she does is take the most
mundane situation and transform it
into something remarkable. It is a
major accomplishment."
Like the rest of us, Adams' charac
ters regularly fall in love with the
wrong people, trust those they
shouldn't and unexpectedly lose
their jobs. She brings us close in focus
to them so we can see their reasoning,
take part in their impulsiveness, make
their same mistakes. It is partly this
"deftness in character rendering," as
L'Heureux puts it, that makes her
work extraordinary. We care about
those she writes about and, in the of
ten chaotic and banal details of their
lives, we can usually discern real spir
itual growth.
"Superior Women," for example,
is an addictively readable novel that
follows the fortunes of four Radcliffe

women from their freshman year during
World War II to the present day.
(The Virginia-born Adams is a

Radcliffe graduate.) The book is a
wonderful and deceptive work that
mingles a scathing social commentary

with scenes of sex, scandal and politi
cal intrigue. Paperback rights to the
book were recently sold for a six
figure sum.
When popular success finally
arrived, it seemed remote, almost
unimportant, Adams says, as though
it were happening to someone else. "1
feel as though I were someone I've
written about," she says. While her
new-found success means that she has
an "awful lot" more money than she
ever did before, it also means that
more demands are made on her time,
which she must now guard jealously
in order to be able to work. And this
work is never easy: She says she has
trouble writing "only every day."
Adams's literary roots are diverse.
"I am a Southern writer, but not only
a Southern writer. I'm definitely
looking around for new directions,"
she says.
Because of its length and scope,
"Superior Women" was cumbersome
and difficult to write, Adams says,
and it is not a form she plans on using
again. So her new novel will be, in
contrast, "short and funny." Adams
says she finds writing humor surpris
ingly difficult. She wonders whether
the effort will be successful.
A recent short story, "A Public
Pool," also marks a profound change
in direction for the writer. The story
takes the form of an interior
monologue of a young woman named
Maxine, self-conscious and over
weight, whose life centers around
her neighborhood public pool.
Presumably because it represented

such a radical departure from the
sexy, more sophisticated characters
and style of her other work, the piece
was turned down everywhere, ac
cording to Adams, before finding its
way into print in Mother Jones, the
San Francisco-based magazine.
Indeed, Adams says that the maga
zine had been advised to refrain from
publishing the work altogether, "for
fear of damaging my image."
She laughs incredulously as she
talks about this, adding that she was
even told that publishing such a piece
before publishing "Superior Women"
might irrevocably damage the recep
tion of the book.
Adams obviously delights in such
stories — her own life seems to take
place comfortably removed from the
squabbles of the publishing world.
She shares her large tranquil apart
ment with Robert McNie. an in terror
designer who has been her com
panion for 21 years, and three cats.
Books are stacked up on the coffee
table and paintings by her son line the
walls.
Adams calls her old writing habits
"true insanity," recalling all those
days spent in the unmade bed. She
prefers her new arrangement, in
which a cat named Ferg sits on. her
typewriter as she works. "We col
laborate on writing," she says. An
astute critic, apparently, this large
and lazy brown cat always "lets me
know when she thinks I'm messing
up."

When Alice Adams, the San Fran
cisco novelist and short story writer,
first started writing, she used to write
in a prone position, lying on her
unmade bed.
She considers this completely
crazy, on reflection.
A lot has changed in Adams' life
since she sold her first story to the
now-defunct Charm magazine
when she was 32 years old. Adams
was so excited by the sale, she says,
that she promptly divorced her hus
band and fell in love twice in that first
year. "I loved 32," she says.
It seems typical of many young
writers' experience that a long time
passes between that first sale an a
next one. This was also true for
Adams, but in the interim, Adams
refined her method of writing. She
now works in a study, sitting upright
at a desk.
Adams has a simple answer as to
why she persevered for so long as an
unknown writer, living on the
proceeds of part-time work and
raising her son as a single parent.
"I'm obviously some sort of obses
sional maniac," she claims. But she
hardly resembles one, at least while
she discussed her life and work in a
recent interview with The Daily.
Where others might speak of their
dedication or discipline in enduring
long years without recognition or
money, it's characteristic of Adams to
dismiss her motives with a self
deprecating remark. Sitting in a
windowed alcove in her apartment
near the Presidio, a tranquil neigh

borhood of large houses and stunning
Bay views, Adams is an attractive
