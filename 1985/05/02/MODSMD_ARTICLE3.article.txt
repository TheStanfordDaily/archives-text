# Activists visit sit-in
## Call for Latin, North American unity 
### FELECIA PAIK 
Three Central American student
activists told more than 90 people in
the Quad yesterday that Central
American students want to work with
U.S. students to create better social
conditions in the world.
Three members of the Central
American Student Tour (CAST) gave
what they called a "salute of brother
hood and solidarity" to Stanford stu
dents from the students of their
respective countries. The panel dis
cussion was initially scheduled to take
place at Tresidder Union, but was

moved to the Quad in conjunction
with the ongoing anti-apartheid sit
in.
CASTs visit to Stanford is one of
the last stops on a nationwide tour.
The speakers said the tour was organ
ized to promote understanding of the
conditions in Central America and to
discuss the role of student activists in
political movements for social
change.
