Three Central American student
activists told more than 90 people in
the Quad yesterday that Central
American students want to work with
U.S. students to create better social
conditions in the world.
Three members of the Central
American Student Tour (CAST) gave
what they called a "salute of brother
hood and solidarity" to Stanford stu
dents from the students of their
respective countries. The panel dis
cussion was initially scheduled to take
place at Tresidder Union, but was

moved to the Quad in conjunction
with the ongoing anti-apartheid sit
in.
CASTs visit to Stanford is one of
the last stops on a nationwide tour.
The speakers said the tour was organ
ized to promote understanding of the
conditions in Central America and to
discuss the role of student activists in
political movements for social
change.

although (maternal,in students do not
possess the same scientific and tech
nological abilities as North
Americans to educate themselves,
"thev are still a** conscious and critical
of their world as \merican students
and want to light for a better world.
Alba said. "It is clear that there is a
distinct difference between Reagan s
interventionist policies and the
policies of individual Americans
themselves."
According to Alba. ( niatemala — a
country of more than hOO.OOO. mans
of them living in extreme poverty and
miserv — has the most human rights

violations in Central America. But

the future."

his work, he must be aware of the so
cial processes of his government."
Sarmiento said.

students have a feeling of solidarity
with the people ol South Africa. He
also thanked North American stu
dents lor their solidarity and for help
ing to prevent the U.S. government
