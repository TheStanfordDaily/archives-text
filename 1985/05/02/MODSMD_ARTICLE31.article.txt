(liven the huge amount of informa
tion to be passed on in this space,
"Briefly"' is a far-from-accurate
word. But it's all we've not.

"II you can't beat 'em. join em."
Danny Pearl seems to have said. So
he has joined us at The Daily, but
he s still holding out in an effort to
beat lis. I hat doesn't make any sense,
but it's not supposed to. What does
make sense (albeit not much) is that
k/Sl . Pearl's old hangout, has chal
lenged I he Daily to a game of
softball (or "softbraw I." as Pearl calls
it). I he slaughter takes place tomor
row at 2:30 p.m. on Roble Field. The
Daily will provide liquid refresh
ments. k/SU will supply the bats.
And Danny Pearl still wants to be a
machine.
But the fun doesn't end there. All
interested staffers are invited to join
the hardcore baseball crew in a trip to
the Oakland A's-Boston Red So\
game tomorrow night. We'll leave
some time after the k/SU softball
debacle. Talk to Mike Hale for more

information.
finally.the infamous Daily Terror
IM softball team will stumble through
another game. trying hard to defend
its .500 record. Saturday at I p.m. on
the IM fields behind Maples Paxilion.
All staffers are in\ ited.
I ixid
There is a chance we will lui\e an
afternoon barbecue, sandwiched (pun
intended) between the softball and
baseball games tomorrow. Watch to
