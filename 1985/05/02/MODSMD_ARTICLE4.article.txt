# Profs. argue divestment issues

While some scholars here agree
that divestment from companies with
business in South Africa by Stanford
alone will not directly affect corpor
ate or South African government
policy, they differ over what action —
if any — Stanford should take.
Although some divestment sup
porters argue that divestment would
help bring about a revolution that
would transfer power to the black
majority, that reasoning "is not borne
out by the realities of the South
African capital market," according to
Lewis Gann. a senior research fellow
at the Hoover Institution.
"American investments number no
more than one-fifth of South Africa's
total investments (from foreign com
panies)," Gann said. "Whatever we
do or don't do is necessarily limited."
British companies hold more than
half of the foreign investments in
South Africa, according to Gann.
"We cannot prevent foreign firms
from operating in South Africa."
"(The University) can divest as a
moral gesture but ought to be aware
that the practical effect will be mini
mal," Gann said.
Stephen King, assistant professor
of economics, noted that "divestment
is very important symbolically" but
agreed "it's very unimportant from a
practical point of view."
"It's not going to change firms too
much," King added.
Political Science Prof. John Manley

agreed that Stanford divestment
alone "wouldn't yield a great deal,"
but that, combined with divestment
by liie University of California and
other universities, the action could
have a significant result.
"It could trigger a snowballing ef
fect that would have profound conse
quences," he said.
Gann is skeptical of the idea that
the presence of foreign companies in
South Africa produces a positive ef-

tect. "The idea of virtuous . . . U.S.
corporations teaching racist compan
ies how to manage properly is quite
unrealistic," he said.
Manley insists that their presence
"helps the system continue its in
tolerable ways."
"Prudent disengagement argu
ments are not relevant," he said.

"The whole issue of divestment really
turns on whether or not a pragmatic
case can be made for hanging in there
to put pressure on a system that is in
tolerable .... From my point of view,
Stanford should divest now."
Furthermore, the University
response to heightened calls for
divestment has been "totally inade
quate," according to Manley.
"It's the position that they always
come from — that this is a matter of
prudent investment. They are weigh
ing pros and cons on an issue that
many people consider transcends
that. . . . It's time to act. In fact, it's
long overdue."
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said, "I don't think that (total
divestment) is an effective strategy to
bring about change in South Africa."
But, he said, "I think this would be
a better university if we were not
doing business there."
At the same time, Lyons is not con
vinced that the University, by
remaining a shareholder, can affect
the behavior of companies and in turn
influence the South African govern
ment. "I'm not really persuaded by
either side of the argument," Lyons
said.
"There are many better ways to
make a difference through the federal
government," he said. "We can so
quickly embargo Nicaragua. ... I'd like
to see some of the tools of our foreign
policy brought to bear (in South
Africa)."
"One could agree with the ends

without having to conclude that
divestment is the answer." Lyons
said. "One can look more ag
gressively for other means."
Lyons said he signed a petition call
ing for divestment because he sup
ports a clause urging that charges
against those arrested in the Berkeley
protest be dropped. While demon
strators have an "inherent right" to
be arrested, the response at Berkeley
represented an "unfortunate falling

apart of the judicial system," accord
ing to Lyons.
"(The protest) represents a state
ment of a sense of urgency that things
are wrong over there and no one is
doing anything - sufficiently wrong
that we should purge ourselves of any
connection. That is a powerful
message," he said.
