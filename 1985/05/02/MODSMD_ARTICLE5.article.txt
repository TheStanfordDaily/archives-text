### MICHAEL GOFF Editorial staff 
Tomorrow's final round of the 33rd annual Marion
Rice kirkwood Moot Court Competition at Kresge
Auditorium may turn out to he something more than a
mock debate of a lesbian rights case.
Lesbian and gay leaders from the New College of Cali
fornia School of Law in San Francisco are gearing up to
protest the participation of U.S. Supreme Court Justice
Byron White as a judge of the competition.
The Committee Against Supreme Court Homophobia,
which is based at the college, announced the protest in a
press release dated April 25. The release maintains that
White "has proven himself a vociferous opponent of les
bian gay rights in his 23 years on the High Court."
According to committee spokesperson Mary Perdue.
"Justice White in particular and the Supreme Court in
general have refused to apply fundamental constitutional
protections to lesbians and gay men. Their homophobic
attitiudes have made a travesty of the Constitution."
Carl Goodman of the committee said. "We are unwill
ing to ignore the hypocrisy of Justice White's association
with the moot court. Our action will point out that Justice
White, when in the courtroom instead of the classroom,
exercises his power to oppress lesbians and gay men."
When informed of the details of the committee's posi
tion. law student Larry Stein, co-president of the moot
court board, said he wanted to know why the committee
had singled out White.
"I have not seen any particular statement by Byron
White that would make him any more vociferous than the
rest of the Court. Other than that. I would agree with the

statement that the Supreme Court has strongly shied away
from deciding this issue." Stein said.
According to Stein, the only way that the protesters
could ruin the competition would be to go into the
auditorium and then, while the government's case is being
presented, "start booing and hissing."
Stein said he would like to emphasize that the partici
pants arc judged on. "how well they speak and how well
they answer the questions of the judges, and not the merit
of the substantive issues."
According to Mark Dupont. a member of the Gay and
Lesbian Alliance at Stanford (GLAS) and the Gay and
Lesbian Law Students Association. GLAS will not be in
volved in the protest, although individual members may
he taking part.
"Because of the impending Gay and Lesbian Aware
ness Week, resources are being directed toward the
week." Dupont said.
Dupont said "there is great concern in the lesbian and
ga\ community about the Court's relative inaction on gav
and lesbian rights and issues," and that the protest is being
directed at White because, "he exemplifies the Court's
real ambivalence to apply rights granted to heterosexual
people to ga\ and lesbian people."
The Kirkwood competition involves arguments b\
second- and third-year law students to panels of judges
sitting .is the Supreme Court of the .United States. The fic
titious case chosen for this year involves two openly les
bian women living in a national recreational area in the
fictitous state of \anthus. In these tvpes of national
