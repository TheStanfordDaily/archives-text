Polish protesters battle police
WARSAW, Poland — Thousands of rock-throwing demonstrators
battled riot police in Gdansk yesterday, and an estimated 15,000
Solidarity supporters staged a two-hour peaceful May Day march in
Warsaw to protest food price hikes and political arrests.
About 500 Solidarity activists chanting "Solidarity" and "Lech
Walesa" forced their way into the official government May Day parade
in Gdansk. They interrupted the parade for 10 minutes by sitting down
in the road before being routed by baton-wielding police units.
About a mile from the parade route, an estimated 2,000 to 3,000
mostly young demonstrators gathered near the former Solidarity
headquarters and hurled stones ripped from the streets at a column of
helmeted riot police, Western reporters said.
The police initially showed restraint but then charged with batons and
shields and used water cannon and tear gas to disperse the crowd.
Several demonstrators and police were injured.
One member of the riot police was beaten to the ground by demon
strators and taken away in an ambulance. A protester who apparently
threw a rock at a police vehicle was rammed by a police car and then
beaten by riot squads. The protester was taken away by ambulance.
Scores of demonstrators were arrested in the clash, which lasted over
an hour and left the street littered with stones and debris.
Solidarity leader Walesa attempted to join the government parade in
Gdansk but returned home when his way was blocked by hundreds of
riot police. "We have no intention of getting into fights," he said. "It's a
shame that someone divides us so brutally."
In Warsaw, an estimated 15,000 people chanting Solidarity slogans
and carrying Solidarity banners marched past cordons of riot police in a
two-hour demonstration before dispersing.
South African protesters arrested
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Police arrested 14 blacks who
gathered outside the U.S. consulate yesterday to protest foreign invest
ment, witnesses said.
Elsewhere, authorities reported two new deaths in racial violence that
has plagued this white-ruled nation since late August, and there were
scattered reports of unrest in the country's segregated black townships.
Peter Jensen, the American in charge of security at the consulate, said
the demonstrators assembled on a busy sidewalk outside the office
building whose 11th floor houses the consulate.
"Most of them were carrying placards. I didn't see much against the
United States individually, but mostly against investments in South
Africa," he said.
"The police came about 15 minutes afterward. The demonstrators
were not chanting. It was all quite silent. Those carrying placards were
taken into police custody."
He described the incident as "extremely peaceful."
Asked whether the consulate had called police, Jensen said: "When I
heard there was going to be a demonstration, I naturally liased with
police. My first concern is the safety of our personnel."
Police spokesman Col. Fred Bull said he believed all those arrested
were black. Witnesses said the protesters were from the partially inte
grated University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.
Outdoor protests have been illegal in South Africa since 1976.
Controversy clouds Reagan visit
BONN, West Germany — President Reagan was welcomed here with
red-carpet pageantry and a 21-gun salute yesterday. But his 10-day trip
to West Germany, Spain, France and Portugal remained clouded by the
controversy over his plan to participate in a wreath-laying ceremony
Sunday at the German military cemetery at Bitburg, where 49 Nazi SS
troops are buried.
On the flight to Bonn aboard Air Force One, the presidential jet,
Speakes voiced unhappiness with the 390-26 vote Tuesday in which the
House urged Reagan to reconsider the Bitburg visit.
"We did not want it, but the House passed it, and there it is," Speakes
said. "The president has made a commitment" to West German Chan
cellor Helmut Kohl, the spokesman said, and"the president is going to
stick by his commitment."
There were no meetings on the president's schedule yesterday, and
the Reagans planned to dine privately at their residence.
Hans-Joachim Franke, chief of German security for Reagan's visit and
the two-day summit, said the president's compound was guarded by 150
fatigue-clad troops, most of them armed with machine guns and leading
attack dogs.
Reagan will hold separate talks today with Kohl, French President
Francois Mitterrand, Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher before attending a dinner
with summit leaders.
Also attending the summit tomorrow and Saturday are Italian Premier
Bettino Craxi and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
Ethiopians forced to leave camp
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — Ethiopian authorities forced 56,000
famine victims to leave an emergency feeding center in a three-day oper
ation this week, international relief agency officials said yesterday.
No official explanation was given for the forced evacuation, which
began Sunday and ended Tuesday, leaving only 2,000 people at the Ib
net camp. The government previously has moved famine victims to non
drought areas in the south and southeast as part of a plan to resettle 1.5
million people.
The military-run government of Mengistu Haile Mariam has main
tained the resettlement project is voluntary and said similar programs
failed in the past partly because force was employed to shift populations.
The evacuation of Ibnet, in the Gondar region about 250 miles north
west of Addis Ababa, apparently was carried out by local militia, accord
ing to the relief officials. They refused to let their names be used due to
the sensitive nature of the issue.
Ethiopian officials, declining immediate comment, said a government
statement would be issued today.
In Washington, Asst. Secretary of State Chester Crocker said at a
hearing on Capitol Hill that the evacuation was an "appalling disaster"
for which "there was no excuse."
"We're appalled at the brutal and hasty manner in which the evacua
tion" was handled, he said.
According to the relief sources, famine victims were each given 33
pounds of dry rations, equivalent to what is doled out in a month, and
told they should make their way to feeding centers in their native regions
of Tig re and Wollo.
Battle in south, fighting in Beirut
BEIRUT, Lebanon — A fierce artillery battle raged in the south yes
terday between Christian defenders of Kfar Falous and Moslem
militiamen stalled in the approaches to the mountain redoubt. Sectarian
fighting was reported in Beirut.
Christian militiamen entrenchcd in Kfar Falous poured cannon fire
from Israeli-supplied Sherman tanks into Moslem-held villages east of
Sidon to block any new advance on their stronghold in the Chouf Moun
tains.
Moslem fighters in Ein cl-Mir, less than a mile west of Kfar Falous,
replied with salvoes of Soviet-made Grad rockets from multi-barreled
launchers, and cannon fire from T-54 tanks.
The defenders have blunted a week-old Moslem push that has driven
an estimated 50,000 Christians from south Lebanon's coastal areas into
their mountain stronghold around Jezzine, which is six miles west of
Kfar Falous.
Many of those Christians fled the villages that the Kfar Falous gunners
were firing on yesterday. Moslem forces seized and looted a string of
Christian villages in their advance east from Sidon.
Reporters in Sidon, the ancient port 10 miles west of Kfar Falous, said
in telephoned dispatches that columns of black smoke billowed above
the mountain outpost. No advances were reported by either side.
Moslem fighters who reached the town's outskirts Tuesday were
halted by a counterattack from Christians of the Lebanese Forces and
the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army.
