# Officials cite 'cumulative' wrongs
## Adminstration explains embargo 
### 
WASHINGTON — The State Department said
yesterday that the economic sanctions imposed
against Nicaragua were the result of the
"cumulative effect" of recent Nicaraguan steps to
bolster its military ties to the Soviet bloc and to ex
port its revolution.
The main element of the sanctions was a total
trade embargo against Nicaragua, but officials sug
gested privately that the measure may not have
much impact.
U.S. corporations with foreign-based sub
sidiaries will not be affected by the embargo. In ad
dition, there was no indication that foreign
countries that do business with Nicaragua were
prepared to follow the U.S. lead and apply sanc
tions of their own.
The decision to halt all trade with Nicaragua was
announced in Bonn, West Germany, shortly after
President Reagan arrived for a summit meeting
with Western allies.
An official U.S. statement said the measures
should be seen as "unmistakable evidence that we
take seriously the obligation to protect our security
interests and those of our friends."
At a State Department briefing, Langhorne Mot
ley, assistant secretary of state for inter-American
affairs, said the administration acted because of
what he described as a disturbing pattern of
Nicaraguan behavior.
He cited new Nicaraguan ties with the Soviet
Union, reflected in the recent visit to Moscow of

President Daniel Ortega, the apprehension of
seven Nicaraguan agents in Honduras, the ship
ment of additional Soviet helicopters to Nicaragua
and the delivery of East German military trucks
and motorcycles.
As for the impact, Jack Pandol, a partner in a
California firm that imports bananas from
Nicaragua, said he believes Nicaragua will have
little difficulty selling to European markets.
"Those bananas are not going to fall into a pit,"
Pandol said in a telephone interview from Delano.
He said his firm did a $15 million to $20 mil
lion annual business with Nicaragua, which
represents more than a fourth of total U.S. trade
with that country.
Nicaraguan exports to the United States totaled
$57 million last year, while U.S. exports amounted
to $111.5 million. In addition to the trade ban,
Reagan abrogated a 27-year old U.S.-Nicaraguan
Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation
and suspended service in the U.S. of Nicaragua's
airline, AeroNica, and the country's national flag
vessels.
Motley said additional sanctions are being con
templated against Nicaragua, including a ban on
most travel by U.S. citizens to Nicaragua and a
freeze on Nicaraguan assets in the United States.
According to official figures, Nicaragua had $132
million on deposit in U.S. banks at the end of 1984
but that figure has declined somewhat since then.
In Managua, Bayardo Arce, one of the nine

members of the ruling Sandinista directorate, said
Reagan administration officials "want us to yield to
hunger and put us on our knees ... but they
never succeed in it."
The United States currently has trade embargoes
against Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam and Cam
bodia. There are limited export restrictions, apply
ing to specific products, for Libya, Iran, Iraq, Syria,
South Yemen and South Africa.
One senior State Department official said a clear
message of the embargo is, that the United States
"won't be paying for their revolution." Besides
trade, the administration barred Nicaraguan
aircraft and ships.
But Sen. Mark Hatfield (R-Ore.), the chairman
of the Senate Appropriations Committee, was
among several lawmakers who worry that the em
bargo will drive the Sandinistas closer to Moscow.
"We are slamming the door on the possibility Of
peace . . . We're driving them into the permanent
embrace of the Russian bear."
However, Motley said the Sandinista ties to Mos
cow already are cemented. "If there was any jump
ing to do, it was done about five to six years ago"
There will be some cost to the United States. A
Commerce Department official, who insisted on
anonymity, noted that Nicaragua was one of;tfce
few countries with which the United States had'a
trade surplus last year, although it was small at $52
million. Trade had been sharply declining anyway,
he said. •
