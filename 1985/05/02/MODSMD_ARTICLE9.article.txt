# Senate OKs Social Security hikes

### 
WASHINGTON — The Senate
voted 65-34 yesterday to restore full
Social Security cost of living increases
to the 1986 budget, brushing aside
warnings that the move was a
"wrecker" that would begin unravel
ing a multi-billion-dollar package of
spending cuts endorsed by President
Reagan.
"I think equity dictates we find an
other way to cut deficits," said Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato (R-N.Y.), making
the case for a provision so popular
that Republicans and Democrats
argued over which party deserved
credit for it.
"If we had truth in labeling in the
Senate, it would bear a Democratic
label," said party whip Alan Cranston

of California, who added that Reagan
has "broken his promise not to touch
Social Security."
The vote stripped a GOP package
of spending cuts of its single largest
domestic savings — $3 billion in 1986
and $22.7 billion over three years
from curtailing annual Social Security
cost of living increases.
In addition, other senators were
ready with amendments to restore
full benefit increases to other pension
programs for civil service and military
retirees, provisions that would cost an
estimated $10 billion over three
years.
Senate Majority Leader Robert
Dole made it clear he would attempt
to restore some pension savings to the
budget before a final vote.

"A week from now we'll put it back
together like Humpty Dumpty," said
the Kansas Republican. Other GOP
senators noted that several
Democrats have indicated they would
support a one-year freeze in benefit
payments.
But even as the Senate gave in to
irresistible political pressure on Social
Security, sources said Dole and Of
fice of Management and Budget
Director David Stockman had agreed
tentatively to restore funding for a
variety of health and health research
programs to head off further amend
ments.
The Social Security vote marked
the beginning of a series of efforts to
restore funds to the GOP blueprint,
