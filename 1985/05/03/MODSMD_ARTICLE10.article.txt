# Committee seeks sanctions
## Legislation to prohibit U.S. loans in South Africa 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Democrat-controlled
House Foreign Affairs Committee voted 29-6 yester
day to impose new economic sanctioas against South
Africa and its system of racial apartheid.
The legislation — opposed by the Reagan adminis
tration — would prohibit new U.S. investment and
loans in South Africa.
It would also suspend the sale of American com
puters to South Africa and shut off imports to the
United States of an estimated $600 million in South
African gold coins called Krugerrands.
All six "no" votes came from Republicans who
argued that rather than encourage improved race rela
tions in South Africa, the sanctions would worsen con
ditions for the black majority there.
A watered-down Republican version condemning
apartheid and setting up a comission to investigate
conditions in South Africa was rejected 19-4.

The Democratic measure now goes to the House
floor where speedy consideration is likely, possibly
before the end of May.
Similar legislation is pending in the Republican
controlled Senate, which is likely to debate the issue by
mid-summer.
The United States has previously cut off military
sales to South Africa, and the country is ineligible for
loans from the Export-Import Bank.
But the recent violence and increasing racial ten
sions in South Africa have made it more likely that
Congress will enact tougher measures this year.
Rep. Stephen Solarz (D-N.Y.) said the sanctioas are
needed because the Reagan administration's policy of
quiet diplomatic pressure has failed to get the South
African government to share political and economic
power with blacks.
