### 
More than 250 people were arrested in anti-apartheid
protests on California and lowa campuses yesterday while
six Boston labor union officials surrendered to police after
occupying an office where South African gold coins are
sold.
In the nation's capital, Georgetown University students
presented trustees a bedsheet banner urging "Divest
Now," and 27 Massachusetts students were freed yester
day from police lock-ups after a sit-in — all part of con
tinuing efforts to end college investment in companies
doing business in South Africa.
"Each day that investment continues is a black spot on
the university," said Matthew Shakespeare, 19, one of the
arrested students at the University of Massachusetts.
Twenty-seven students who were arrested after refusing
to leave the office of campus Treasurer Robert Brand
were released yesterday after pleading innocent to
trespassing charges. Six other students face arraignment
next week.

At Harvard, about 200 students barricaded the door of
a room where a South African diplomat was speaking yes
terday until a phalanx of campus police led him through
the chanting crowd.
Police arrested 112 demonstrators in Berkeley. All
were cited for blocking public access and then released.
"I think that the reverberations of.these demonstra//f/w
are being heard around the world," black activist Aftgdd
Davis, who teaches at San Francisco State, told 350
people at a sunrise rally yesterday at the UC-Berkeley
campus. "South Africa is going to be free — divestment or
not."
Davis was among those arrested.
Meanwhile, San Francisco Municipal Court Judge
David Garcia presided over the arraignment of 159 anti
apartheid protesters, who had been arrested April 16, in
Berkeley-Albany Municipal Court. Three of the four local
judges asked not to be assigned to the case because of
their personal opposition to apartheid.
