Herpes vaccine tested
WASHINGTON — Government researchers
say an experimental vaccine tested in animals not
only wards off herpes infections, but also
prevents the viruses from taking up residence in
nerve cells for later attacks.
National Institutes of Health scientists say the
prototype vaccine, still years away from human
testing if further research proves promising, also
appears to offer simultaneous protection against
different types of herpes viruses that cause
human disease.
The vaccine, described in a report to be pub
lished today in the journal Science, is one of
several being developed by researchers
worldwide who are taking different approaches
to finding a preventive for herpes.
A number of these prototype vaccines use live
herpes virus or parts of the viral protein coat to
stimulate production of protective antibodies in
animals.
But the NIH vaccine, which combines parts of

a herpes virus with one used in the smallpox
vaccine, is the first to indicate prevention of
latent infectioas that can spur later attacks — one
of the biggest problems associated with herpes
infections, the researchers said.
The researchers, including Drs. Bernard Moss,
Kenneth Cremer and Abner Notkins, said the
vaccine developed from herpes simplex virus
type 1, which causes cold sores, also offered
protection against type 2, the most frequent
cause of sexually-transmitted genital herpes.
Contractor to diversify
POMONA — General Dynamics, stung
by investigations of alleged overcharges and
bribery, said yesterday it is considering a major
acquisition outside the military industry to
reduce its reliance on the Defense Department.
David Lewis, chairman of St. Louis-based
General Dynamics, the nation's No. 1 defense
contractor, declined to indicate what companies
or fields it is considering moving into, except to

rule out mass-merchandising firms.
In addition. Lewis told the company's annual
meeting that it was "unwarranted and completely
unfair' for the inspector-general of the Defense
Department to say last week that he believed
Lewis and another General Dynamics executive
should be forbidden from doing further business
with the government.
Market decline ends
NEW YORK — The stock market turned in a
mixed showing yesterday, halting its sharp
decline of the past four sessions but failing to
mount any sustained rally.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
which had fallen 42.73 points in the past four
trading days to a three-month low, edged up .22
to 1,242.27.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
stepped up to 107.74 million shares from 101.55
million Wednesday.
