Gay rights bill deferred
SACRAMENTO — The author of a bill to ban
job discrimination against homosexuals said yes
terday he won't try to move it until 1986.
Assemblyman Art Agnos (D-San Francisco)
said he doesn't have enough votes for passage in
the Assembly Labor and Employment Commit
tee.
Next week is the deadline for bills to clear their
first committee to be eligible for final passage this
year. Bills that don't make the deadline cannot
be considered until next year.
Agnos' ABI would make it illegal to dis
criminate in job hiring or promotion on the basis
of sexual orientation. It would allow someone
who alleges such discrimination to file a com
plaint with the state Fair Employment and
Housing Commission, which currently enforces
laws against discrimination based on race, sex or
religion.

An identical bill was passed by the Legislature
last year, but vetoed by Republican Gov. George
Deukmejian.
Second sniper arrested
SACRAMENTO — Police made a second ar
rest yesterday in their hunt for a shotgun-firing
sniper who blasted two rounds into a crowded

Authorities said Eric Paul Bright, 33, of
Sacramento, was arrested at his home near
Fremont Park, scene of the Wednesday noontime
shooting. Police spokesman Bob Burns said in
vestigators seized a 12-gauge shotgun and empty
shells in Bright's residence.
Bright was held in Sacramento County jail for
investigation of six counts of attempted murder
and one count of use of a firearm. Burns said.
Burns said Bright was taken into custody based

on information developed during an investigation
of the crime by two police department detectives.
He did not elaborate.
Ihe day before, more than 11 hours after the
shooting, a police SWAT team acting on a tip ar
rested Ronald Mitchell, 28, of Sacramento. But
Mitchell was released after investigators deter
mined he was at his construction job and not near
the park, about a half mile south of the state
Capitol.
Police said an assailant fired into the park, then
apparently fled through a nearby alley. A room
to-room search of adjacent homes following the
shooting failed to disclose any clues. Burns said.
