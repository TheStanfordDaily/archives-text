## Athletes test physical endurance in triathlon 
### PAM EVANS 
Spring fever has sprung again at
Stanford. Budding trees and blossoms
decorate our roadways and arouse
the senses of every nature-loving
Californian.
Hut something else lingers in the
warm breeze — not pollen or
ragweed, but another strain, gripping
large-muscle groups, defying
rationale and sending both body and
mind to pound, pedal and plunge to
the ultimate edge of endurance.
Triathlon fever is here. By extend
ing one's cardiovascular boundries, it
can transform the mild-mannered
sports enthusiast into the epitome of
total body fitness — the triathlete.
I ri-tever has reached epidemic
proportions in the Bay Area. The
only remedy is action. Action will be
taken Sunday as an estimated 1,500
infected athletes will compete in the
fourth annual Rapp's Traithlon,
where they will run-bike-swim their
way to health and raise money for
charity.
I he punishing event, sponsored by
Rapp's Shoes and the Palo Alto
Weekly, will benefit Stanford
Children's Hospital, Stanford's men's
and women's swimming teams and
the Rinconada master's swim team in
Palo Alto.
No one over age 15 is immune, but
men — comprising two-thirds of the
competitors — still seem more suscep
tible to the fever than women do. Stu
dents, families, business people and
friends will call their hamstrings into
action Sunday at 8 a.m. to com
mence a 3.7-mile run. With a blast of
the starting gun, hundreds of individ
uals and three-person relay teams will
begin at Sand Hill Road and Inter
state 280.
They will spread out over Portola
Road to the Portola Valley Town
Hall, where their bicycles await. For
7.6 miles, they will wind and weave
downhill along Portola and Alpine
Roads to Lake Lagunita. Here, their
steamy, sweaty bodies will splash into
the water for a 3/4-mile swim to the
finish.

•it's really neat," said Roxy Rapp,
owner of Rapp's Shoes. "It's sort of a
family thing, and the course is so
short it's really good for the average,
weekend athlete."
"It'll be fun! I just want to get
through it and see how I do," said
Suzy Alden, a 21-year-old senior in
mechanical engineering at Stanford.
"Swimming is my weakest event, but
I ran a marathon a few weeks ago in
Oregon." Rapp's will be Alden's first
triathlon.
Today's triathlons are what mara
thons were in the 19705. Still a mere
babe in the fitness woods, triathlon
distances have not yet been standard
ized, and the term "tri-fever" cannot
be found in any medical dictionary.
What is the root of this triple
aerobic phenomenon that makes a
marathon look like a Sunday stroll?

The strain originated in Hawaii in
1977, when U.S. Navy Commander
John Collins brainstormed the idea of
combining three traditional Hawaiin
endurance events: the 2.4-mile
Waikiki Rough Water Swim, the 1 12-
mile Around-Oahu Bike Race and
the 26.2-mile Honolulu Marathon.
Only 15 people, all male, took the
challenge in February 1978, but an
article in Sports Illustrated set the
waves in motion.
The event was first broadcast in
1980 by ABC's "Wide World of
Sports."
"When I saw it, I thought, 'Those
guys are crazy! Who would ever do
something like that?' " recalled
Dante Dettamanti, Stanford's water
polo coach. Two years later he
finished fifth in his 35-39 age group
in both the Hawaii Ironman — now

officially the Bud Light Ironman Tri
athlon World Championship, held
each October — and Rapp's Triath
lon '82.
What gave Dettamanti, and so
many others like him, the impetus to
train?
"I was an ex-swimmer and a mara
thoner and figured, if those guys could
do it, I could do it,"he explained.
The catalyst that launched the
sport to the public was ABC's
coverage two years later, capturing an
exhausted Julie Moss crawling to the
finish line. From there, tri-fever
spread rapidly aross the nation.
This year, no fewer than 600,000
people will compete in more than
2,000 scheduled events, with
categories ranging from the ultra
triathlon to the mini, or sprint, ver
sion.

The biggest growth, according to
Sally Edwards, author of "Triathlon:
A Triple Fitness Sport." is in the
shorter "tri-for-fun" contests, such as
Rapp's. She especially sees more
women getting involved.
Bob Bird, development director of
Triathlon Federation/USA, agrees.
"The goal of the ultra-triathlon is
to survive," he said. "In the shorter,
sprint events, the length and en
durance factor doesn't eliminate a lot
of people, so you have a much bigger
pack at the finish."
So who are these otherwise sane in
dividuals who get up at the crack of
dawn to train and compete?
Tri-fever seems to attack specific
groups of people. According to Bird,
studies indicate that the average tri
athlete is 35 years old, with an annual
income of $45,000.
"Most triathletes are well ed
ucated," said Bird. "Seventy-five
percent are college educated, 30 per
cent of those have graduate degrees
and 60 to 70 percent work as profes
sionals or in upper management."
There are three reasons why
"yuppies" may be attracted to triath
lons.
"First of all," said Bird, "these
people are already successful in their
jobs. They've already got the dis
cipline and motivation required to
train."
Second, these people can afford it.
"You need to spend roughly $600
for an adequate bike, and the mainte
nance costs can be high," he said.
"Race registration fees range from
$20 to $50, and then there are the
travel and accommodation expenses
involved when competing out of
town."
Perhaps the biggest factor is that
for the longer "iron man" or "ultra"
events, the training required is time
consuming. Not everyone can work
out two to four hours every morning
and wander into the office at 10
a.m.
Dettamanti has a different view.
"I think that younger people are

still actively involved in one sport,
whereas you go into a triathlon after
you retire from peak competition. It's
new and different, and marathons
become old hat. Something like
Rapp's is more of a challenge." he
said.
George Haines, Stanford's
women's swim team coach, shares
that view, pointing out that the top
triathletes are ex-swimmers.
"The training and discipline they
get in swimming has led to this." said
Haines. He feels that when they get
through with individual competition,
it's a natural transition.
"1 think that their swimming back
grounds helped them to become good
runners . . . and biking would not be
that hard to do." he added.
"Swimmers come from way back to
win it. I've gone to Rapp's each year
and have seen a lot of ex-swimmers in
their 30s and 40s out there."
Whatever the reason, anyone en
tering a triathlon must train.
For long races like the Hawaii
lronman, Edwards advises athletes to
build up a training base and
gradually work up to 12 training ses
sions a week. This includes three days
of single sports, three double-sport
workouts — run-bike, bike-swim,
then run-bike, for example — and
one triple-sport day. Daily distances
increase to 1,500 to 3,000 yards of
swimming, 10 to 75 miles of cycling
and five to 15 miles of running.
"You have to train an awful lot to
do well in those things," said Detta
manti, "but for Rapp's, you don't
have to train as much as it's only a
sprint."
Some train more than others.
"1 want to be proud of how 1 do,"
said Pam Stevenson, a 23-year-old
graduate student in mechanical engi
neering at Stanford and three-time
triathlete. She bikes 25 to 30 miles on
weekends, swims orte mile three
times a week, and runs the "Dish" —
a hilly five-mile run around the
satellite dish overlooking Lake
