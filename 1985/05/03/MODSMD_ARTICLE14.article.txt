## Athletes test physical endurance in triathlon 
### PAM EVANS 
Spring fever has sprung again at
Stanford. Budding trees and blossoms
decorate our roadways and arouse
the senses of every nature-loving
Californian.
Hut something else lingers in the
warm breeze — not pollen or
ragweed, but another strain, gripping
large-muscle groups, defying
rationale and sending both body and
mind to pound, pedal and plunge to
the ultimate edge of endurance.
Triathlon fever is here. By extend
ing one's cardiovascular boundries, it
can transform the mild-mannered
sports enthusiast into the epitome of
total body fitness — the triathlete.
I ri-tever has reached epidemic
proportions in the Bay Area. The
only remedy is action. Action will be
taken Sunday as an estimated 1,500
infected athletes will compete in the
fourth annual Rapp's Traithlon,
where they will run-bike-swim their
way to health and raise money for
charity.
I he punishing event, sponsored by
Rapp's Shoes and the Palo Alto
Weekly, will benefit Stanford
Children's Hospital, Stanford's men's
and women's swimming teams and
the Rinconada master's swim team in
Palo Alto.
No one over age 15 is immune, but
men — comprising two-thirds of the
competitors — still seem more suscep
tible to the fever than women do. Stu
dents, families, business people and
friends will call their hamstrings into
action Sunday at 8 a.m. to com
mence a 3.7-mile run. With a blast of
the starting gun, hundreds of individ
uals and three-person relay teams will
begin at Sand Hill Road and Inter
state 280.
They will spread out over Portola
Road to the Portola Valley Town
Hall, where their bicycles await. For
7.6 miles, they will wind and weave
downhill along Portola and Alpine
Roads to Lake Lagunita. Here, their
steamy, sweaty bodies will splash into
the water for a 3/4-mile swim to the
finish.

•it's really neat," said Roxy Rapp,
owner of Rapp's Shoes. "It's sort of a
family thing, and the course is so
short it's really good for the average,
weekend athlete."
"It'll be fun! I just want to get
through it and see how I do," said
Suzy Alden, a 21-year-old senior in
mechanical engineering at Stanford.
"Swimming is my weakest event, but
I ran a marathon a few weeks ago in
Oregon." Rapp's will be Alden's first
triathlon.
Today's triathlons are what mara
thons were in the 19705. Still a mere
babe in the fitness woods, triathlon
distances have not yet been standard
ized, and the term "tri-fever" cannot
be found in any medical dictionary.
What is the root of this triple
aerobic phenomenon that makes a
marathon look like a Sunday stroll?

The strain originated in Hawaii in
1977, when U.S. Navy Commander
John Collins brainstormed the idea of
combining three traditional Hawaiin
endurance events: the 2.4-mile
Waikiki Rough Water Swim, the 1 12-
mile Around-Oahu Bike Race and
the 26.2-mile Honolulu Marathon.
Only 15 people, all male, took the
challenge in February 1978, but an
article in Sports Illustrated set the
waves in motion.
The event was first broadcast in
1980 by ABC's "Wide World of
Sports."
"When I saw it, I thought, 'Those
guys are crazy! Who would ever do
something like that?' " recalled
Dante Dettamanti, Stanford's water
polo coach. Two years later he
finished fifth in his 35-39 age group
in both the Hawaii Ironman — now

officially the Bud Light Ironman Tri
athlon World Championship, held
each October — and Rapp's Triath
lon '82.
What gave Dettamanti, and so
many others like him, the impetus to
train?
"I was an ex-swimmer and a mara
thoner and figured, if those guys could
do it, I could do it,"he explained.
The catalyst that launched the
sport to the public was ABC's
coverage two years later, capturing an
exhausted Julie Moss crawling to the
finish line. From there, tri-fever
spread rapidly aross the nation.
This year, no fewer than 600,000
people will compete in more than
2,000 scheduled events, with
categories ranging from the ultra
triathlon to the mini, or sprint, ver
sion.

The biggest growth, according to
Sally Edwards, author of "Triathlon:
A Triple Fitness Sport." is in the
shorter "tri-for-fun" contests, such as
Rapp's. She especially sees more
women getting involved.
Bob Bird, development director of
Triathlon Federation/USA, agrees.
"The goal of the ultra-triathlon is
to survive," he said. "In the shorter,
sprint events, the length and en
durance factor doesn't eliminate a lot
of people, so you have a much bigger
pack at the finish."
So who are these otherwise sane in
dividuals who get up at the crack of
dawn to train and compete?
Tri-fever seems to attack specific
groups of people. According to Bird,
studies indicate that the average tri
athlete is 35 years old, with an annual
income of $45,000.
"Most triathletes are well ed
ucated," said Bird. "Seventy-five
percent are college educated, 30 per
cent of those have graduate degrees
and 60 to 70 percent work as profes
sionals or in upper management."
There are three reasons why
"yuppies" may be attracted to triath
lons.
"First of all," said Bird, "these
people are already successful in their
jobs. They've already got the dis
cipline and motivation required to
train."
Second, these people can afford it.
"You need to spend roughly $600
for an adequate bike, and the mainte
nance costs can be high," he said.
"Race registration fees range from
$20 to $50, and then there are the
travel and accommodation expenses
involved when competing out of
town."
Perhaps the biggest factor is that
for the longer "iron man" or "ultra"
events, the training required is time
consuming. Not everyone can work
out two to four hours every morning
and wander into the office at 10
a.m.
Dettamanti has a different view.
"I think that younger people are

still actively involved in one sport,
whereas you go into a triathlon after
you retire from peak competition. It's
new and different, and marathons
become old hat. Something like
Rapp's is more of a challenge." he
said.
George Haines, Stanford's
women's swim team coach, shares
that view, pointing out that the top
triathletes are ex-swimmers.
"The training and discipline they
get in swimming has led to this." said
Haines. He feels that when they get
through with individual competition,
it's a natural transition.
"1 think that their swimming back
grounds helped them to become good
runners . . . and biking would not be
that hard to do." he added.
"Swimmers come from way back to
win it. I've gone to Rapp's each year
and have seen a lot of ex-swimmers in
their 30s and 40s out there."
Whatever the reason, anyone en
tering a triathlon must train.
For long races like the Hawaii
lronman, Edwards advises athletes to
build up a training base and
gradually work up to 12 training ses
sions a week. This includes three days
of single sports, three double-sport
workouts — run-bike, bike-swim,
then run-bike, for example — and
one triple-sport day. Daily distances
increase to 1,500 to 3,000 yards of
swimming, 10 to 75 miles of cycling
and five to 15 miles of running.
"You have to train an awful lot to
do well in those things," said Detta
manti, "but for Rapp's, you don't
have to train as much as it's only a
sprint."
Some train more than others.
"1 want to be proud of how 1 do,"
said Pam Stevenson, a 23-year-old
graduate student in mechanical engi
neering at Stanford and three-time
triathlete. She bikes 25 to 30 miles on
weekends, swims orte mile three
times a week, and runs the "Dish" —
a hilly five-mile run around the
satellite dish overlooking Lake

Lagunita — as often as her
homework schedule will allow.
On the other hand, Ken Windus, a
19-year old Stanford freshman who
recently competed in the middle
distance United States Triathlon Se
ries (USTS) in Seattle, doesn't train
much at all.
"1 was on the swim and cross
country teams in high school, and I've
done some bicycle touring," said
Windus. Other than swimming a half
an hour every day, Windus said he
just happens to be in shape for the
event.
"That's how it works for me," he
said.
For most tri-fever victims, training
is a necessary part of treatment. The
risk of injury increases if the body is
not taught how to perform properly
under stress.
"There are people who have en
tered in the past three years that have
been so poor (in physical fitness) that
they literally walked most of the
way," said Cindy Baxter, Rapp's race
director and two-time Rapp's Triath
lon record holder.
"We put a time limit on each event
this year, and we will disqualify those
who pass the specified times because
I don't think they're safe," said Bax
ter, who designed the course.
The criteria for the mandatory cut
off time is based on the performance
of Rapp's oldest veteran, 74-year-old
Willard Johnston. His personal best is
one hour, 34 minutes and 26.3
seconds, set in 1983. The average
completion time is around one hour,
five minutes.

"Johnston is in superb condition,"
said Baxter. "And he trains. He's an
open-water swimmer, and he runs
and bikes constantly." Considering
his age relative to the average com
petitor, Baxter feels that "if you can't
beat this man, you'd better not en
ter."
"The safety of the athletes has got
to come first," Baxter said. 'Then it's
putting on a good quality race. Each
year we do a better and better job."
Although the run is said to be the
hardest part of the race, the swim is
potentially the most dangerous, even
though members of Stanford's men's
and women's swim teams will be on
hand as lifeguards.
"You have to learn open-water
swimming techniques because you're
with a pack of people, some of whom
are kicking you in the face," ex
plained Dettamanti, who conducted a
swim clinic in 1982 offering sink-or
swim prescriptions. "You must keep
your head up, go in a straight line,
and look for the buoys. There are no
walls or lines to follow in a lake," he
added.
After an arduous running and
biking session, the athlete's muscles
are hot and hurting from lactic acid
build-up, a result of anaerobic exer
tion. Sudden submersion in cold
water could lead to tight muscles and
cramps. Also, the weakening,
fatigued swimmer may push too hard
too soon, in anticipation of the finish
line's curative relief.
Rapp's officials have taken several
safety precautions. Three ambulances
will be stationed on the course: one at
the run-bike transition point, one on
the cyclists' route, and one at the
lake. Race officials and officers from
the Stanford police, Menlo Park
police and Woodside Patrol will be on

duty throughout the race to control
traffic and overzealous crowds.
"Spectators literally summon an in
ner fear with the athletes," said Bax
ter. "Their heads seem to be in the
clouds. They wander right into the
spaces where the athletes are run
ning. .. . They're all over, even in the
transition chutes where the swimmers
enter and leave the water."
The events in Rapp's Triathlon '85
are in reverse order from the Hawaii
Ironman. The size of the beach and
swimming area dictates how the race
is set up.
Referring to the swim event, Det
tamanti said, "As it is a W-shaped
course, when the lake is full of
people, it looks like hordes of ants
following each other - an unusual
sight."
Many competitors prefer the swim
to be last. "1 think it will be to my ad
vantage because a lot of people will
be tired and I'll be able to catch up
and pull ahead," said Windus, who
feels that the run will be his most dif
ficult portion.
"It's a race for runners," said
Stevenson. "Anyone who's a good
runner will come out well in it. 1
prefer the run-bike-swim order," she
added, "because it's much easier to
run a distance and get on a bike than
having to get off a bike and run.
That's the hardest thing to do, 'cause
your quads are so tight. The swim
transition isn't that hard to do."
Through clouded goggles, the dis
tant finish line might seem like an
oasis. What bait drives these intrepid
souls to explore new cardiovascular
frontiers?
"It's yourself you're out there for,"
said Stevenson. "And you meet great
people. Everyone feels a common
bond which is half the reason, and

you feel a real sense of accomplish
ment."
Windus has more tangible rewards
in mind, however. "I hear they give
out medals and ribbons," he said. "1
wouldn't mind placing. I'm at the top
of my age group (15-19), so that may
help."
So far, there is no cure for the af
flicted, but prizes might have a
placebo effect on some. In all 12 age
divisions, individuals and relays, first
place winners will receive a trophy, a
pair of athletic shoes, a traveling bag
and goggles. Second- through sixth
place winners receive ribbons, and all
participants will be awarded with a
commemorative T-shirt.
For others, relief may only come by
a shot at the Olympic gold medal.
Tri-Athlete magazine theorizes
that there's a good possibility triath
letics will become an Olympic sport in
1992 for two key reasons: Profes
sionals will create greater spectator
interest, and the triathlon will be in
troduced as an intercollegiate sport.
"The triathlon is unique," said
Dettamanti. "1 can see it replacing
the pentathalon. ... It would be
much more popular."
As far as triathlon teams being
formed on campus, Dettamanti sees
them forming on an intramural club
level only.
"It's very difficult to add new var
sity sports," he said, "because it's so
expensive." Since it is not yet a
popular spectator sport, triathlons
would not be financially self
sufficient.
So there's hope for the ex-high
school swimming flash who couldn't
make the university team, the non
scholarship runner and the school cy
cling club jock. Anyone in good
health is susceptible to tri-fever.
