## THE 						STANFORD DAILY Vandalism is pointless 
### 
Last week, a rally commemorating the 37th an
niversary of the founding of Israel was marred by
an act of vandalism. Banners advertising the rally
and other Israel Week events had been defaced
with Palestinian Liberation Organization slogans.
Michael Bunzel, chairman of the Israel Action
Committee, used the rally as an opportunity to
denounce publicly those responsible for spray
painting PLO slogans on the Israeli banners. But
some students angered by the vandalism were not
satisfied by merely denouncing the criminals.
They retaliated by tearing down PLO flags that
had been placed next to the defaced Israel Week
banners.
A Daily photographer took pictures of the Is
raeli sympathizers tearing down the PLO flags.
Soon afterward, some of these students called
The Daily offices, saying the pro-Israeli students
would be subjected to reprisals if the
photographs were published.

It is a sad state of affairs when Stanford com
munity residents resort to vandalism and violence
to propagate their political beliefs. The PLO
sympathizers certainly had a right to place their
signs next to pro-Israeli banners, but they had no
right to deface those banners. At the same time,
the Israeli sympathizers should have found a
more constructive outlet for their frustration than
simply ripping down the PLO flags.
It is even sadder to consider that Stanford stu
dents would fear for their personal safety because
they had torn down the PLO flags. Apparently,
the fear, confusion and violence of the Middle
East has penetrated even the Stanford commu
nity.
There are no quick solutions to the centuries
old antagonisms that plague the Middle East
today. But the Stanford representatives of the
various Middle Eastern factions need not mind
lessly duplicate the violence and hostility that
currently characterize that chaotic region.
