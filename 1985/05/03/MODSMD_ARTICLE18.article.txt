## The 						costs of the Nicaraguan war 
### 
I spent this past Christmas break in Nicaragua,
where another Stanford student and I, acting as
representatives of a local committee, laid the basis
for a medical aid project. In the course of arranging
this project, we visited seven hospitals and clinics
throughout the country in order to get a sense of
how serious the material needs in health care were.
The situation was roughly the same at each of the
health centers we toured; it can be summed up, in a
word, as catastrophic.

VIEWPOINT

Penicillin and other antibiotics were in exceed
ingly short supply, as were practically all medica
tions. As for medical equipment, the health centers
had very little, and much of what they did have was
appallingly old. This old equipment was extremely
unreliable, and replacement parts to repair it when
it broke down were generally unavailable.
There was a particularly severe shortage of
equipment needed for doing diagnostic work, with
the result that only the most primitive tests could
be performed, and that even they must often be
carried out in an imperfect manner. In addition,
there was an acute scarcity of many minor items we
take for granted in the United States, such as surgi
cal gloves, plastic tubes and syringes; routinely dis
carded in American hospitals, these articles are
often recycled repeatedly in Nicaraguan ones. To
cite just a few -further examples of equipment
shortages, respirators, centrifuges and functional
ambulances were all in exceedingly short supply.
At this point your reaction might be, "So what?"
After all, the conditions described here are no
worse than those prevailing in many Third World
countries. Why should the plight of Nicaragua's
health care system be of particular concern to us?
There are two answers to this question. First,
unlike most Third World regimes, the government
of Nicaragua has the will to improve its people's
health. Its record makes this clear. In its brief five
and-a-half years of existence, the government has
already registered impressive gains in national
health, dramatically bettering the miserable situa
tion it inherited from the Somoza dictatorship.
Where medical treatment had previously been
monopolized by a wealthy, urban elite, basic health
care has now been extended to the most remote
rural areas and, because it has been made almost

entirely free, is now accessible to even the poorest
Nicaraguans. Moreover, a number of nationwide
vaccination and health education campaigns,
carried out with massive popular participation,
have produced remarkable results.
The statistics tell the story. As of mid-1984,
malaria cases had decreased 50 percent since 1978,
no polio cases had been reported for two years, no
measles cases had been reported for half a year,
and diarrhea had fallen from the first to the fourth
most common cause of hospital mortality. Infant
mortality had decreased from 121 per 1,000 live
births in 1978 to 80.2 in 1983, and life expectancy
had risen from 52 to 59 years over the same period.
Thousands of people, especially children, who
would have died in prerevolutionary Nicaragua
from completely preventable diseases are alive
today, simply because the new government has

ernment to divert pre
cious resources from the
health care sector to
defense.

chosen to make popular health care a priority.
Nicaragua has been recognized for its achievements
in this area by the World Health Organization and
the Pan American Health Organization.
Thus one reason that we should care about the
severe difficulties Nicaragua's health care system is
currently experiencing is that it has shown such ex
ceptional promise. The other reason is that our own
government's policy toward Nicaragua is the major
cause of these difficulties. The Somoza dynasty's
legacy of neglect certainly hurts; so too does the se
vere shortage of foreign exchange (itself largely

due to a systematic U.S. campaign to squeeze
Nicaragua's economy). But by far the most damag
ing factor is the three-year-old U.S.-sponsored
Contra war.
This war adversely affects the functioning of the
Nicaraguan health care system in four distinct
ways:
• It exacerbates the shortage of foreign exchange.
(The Contras have directed devastating sabotage
against Nicaragua's export crops, especially coffee;
and the ClA's mining of the country's harbors
caused a further sharp reduction in foreign trade.)
This shortage in turn translates into a shortage of
medicine and medical equipment.
• It forces the government to divert precious eco
nomic and human resources from the health care
sector to defense.
• Within the health care sector, the war compels
the government to shift medical supplies and per
sonnel from meeting everyday health needs to
treating war casualties, who are given top priority.
• Most directly, the Contras have singled out
health care facilities and personnel as special tar
gets of their attacks. Contra raids have taken a
heavy toll on Nicaragua's health infrastructure, re
sulting in the destruction or closure of 50 medical
centers and the deaths of 22 health workers, in
cluding two West European physicians, as well as
of at least 50 more health volunteers, health
educators and medical students. Many other medi
cal personnel have been wounded, kidnaped, or
tortured by the Contras.
Thus the Reagan administration's bellicose
policy toward Nicaragua means that that country's
current health care problems do indeed have a spe
cial relevance for us. As U.S. citizens, it is up to us
to demonstrate to the people of Nicaragua that we
can be a source, not only of the death and destruc
tion our tax dollars have been buying there, but
also of the life and hope that our donations of badly
needed medical supplies can bestow. And, even
more important, we have an obligation to end the
cruel, senseless war which is causing the
Nicaragua people so much suffering and prevent
ing them from getting on with the task of develop
ing their society and realizing its full potential, in
health care as in all other areas of national life.

no polio cases had been reported for two years, no
measles cases had been reported for half a year,
and diarrhea had fallen from the first to the fourth

mortality had decreased from 121 per 1,000 live
births in 1978 to 80.2 in 1983, and life expectancy
had risen from 52 to 59 years over the same period.

Nicaragua has been recognized for its achievements
in this area by the World Health Organization and
the Pan American Health Organization.
Thus one reason that we should care about the
severe difficulties Nicaragua's health care system is
currently experiencing is that it has shown such ex
ceptional promise. The other reason is that our own
government's policy toward Nicaragua is the major
cause of these difficulties. The Somoza dynasty's
legacy of neglect certainly hurts; so too does the se
vere shortage of foreign exchange (itself largely

due to a systematic U.S. campaign to squeeze
Nicaragua's economy). But by far the most damag
ing factor is the three-year-old U.S.-sponsored
Contra war.
This war adversely affects the functioning of the
Nicaraguan health care system in four distinct
ways:
• It exacerbates the shortage of foreign exchange.
(The Contras have directed devastating sabotage
against Nicaragua's export crops, especially coffee;
and the ClA's mining of the country's harbors
caused a further sharp reduction in foreign trade.)
This shortage in turn translates into a shortage of
medicine and medical equipment.
• It forces the government to divert precious eco
nomic and human resources from the health care
sector to defense.
• Within the health care sector, the war compels
the government to shift medical supplies and per
sonnel from meeting everyday health needs to
treating war casualties, who are given top priority.
• Most directly, the Contras have singled out
health care facilities and personnel as special tar
gets of their attacks. Contra raids have taken a
heavy toll on Nicaragua's health infrastructure, re
sulting in the destruction or closure of 50 medical
centers and the deaths of 22 health workers, in
cluding two West European physicians, as well as
of at least 50 more health volunteers, health
educators and medical students. Many other medi
cal personnel have been wounded, kidnaped, or
tortured by the Contras.
Thus the Reagan administration's bellicose
policy toward Nicaragua means that that country's
current health care problems do indeed have a spe
cial relevance for us. As U.S. citizens, it is up to us
to demonstrate to the people of Nicaragua that we
can be a source, not only of the death and destruc
tion our tax dollars have been buying there, but
also of the life and hope that our donations of badly
needed medical supplies can bestow. And, even
more important, we have an obligation to end the
cruel, senseless war which is causing the
Nicaragua people so much suffering and prevent
ing them from getting on with the task of develop
ing their society and realizing its full potential, in
health care as in all other areas of national life.

I spent this past Christmas break in Nicaragua,
where another Stanford student and I, acting as
representatives of a local committee, laid the basis
for a medical aid project. In the course of arranging
this project, we visited seven hospitals and clinics
throughout the country in order to get a sense of
how serious the material needs in health care were.
The situation was roughly the same at each of the
health centers we toured; it can be summed up, in a
word, as catastrophic.

VIEWPOINT

Penicillin and other antibiotics were in exceed
ingly short supply, as were practically all medica
tions. As for medical equipment, the health centers
had very little, and much of what they did have was
appallingly old. This old equipment was extremely
unreliable, and replacement parts to repair it when
it broke down were generally unavailable.
There was a particularly severe shortage of
equipment needed for doing diagnostic work, with
the result that only the most primitive tests could
be performed, and that even they must often be
carried out in an imperfect manner. In addition,
there was an acute scarcity of many minor items we
take for granted in the United States, such as surgi
cal gloves, plastic tubes and syringes; routinely dis
carded in American hospitals, these articles are
often recycled repeatedly in Nicaraguan ones. To
cite just a few -further examples of equipment
shortages, respirators, centrifuges and functional
ambulances were all in exceedingly short supply.
At this point your reaction might be, "So what?"
After all, the conditions described here are no
worse than those prevailing in many Third World
countries. Why should the plight of Nicaragua's
health care system be of particular concern to us?
There are two answers to this question. First,
unlike most Third World regimes, the government
of Nicaragua has the will to improve its people's
health. Its record makes this clear. In its brief five
and-a-half years of existence, the government has
already registered impressive gains in national
health, dramatically bettering the miserable situa
tion it inherited from the Somoza dictatorship.
Where medical treatment had previously been
monopolized by a wealthy, urban elite, basic health
care has now been extended to the most remote
rural areas and, because it has been made almost

entirely free, is now accessible to even the poorest
Nicaraguans. Moreover, a number of nationwide
vaccination and health education campaigns,
carried out with massive popular participation,
have produced remarkable results.
The statistics tell the story. As of mid-1984,
malaria cases had decreased 50 percent since 1978,
no polio cases had been reported for two years, no
measles cases had been reported for half a year,
and diarrhea had fallen from the first to the fourth
