# The 						invasion of the caterpillars

### 
It's spring! The sun is out, the grass is just start
ing to turn brown, people are falling in love and
walking around with idiotic grins on their faces.
The Earth is flowering and being fruitful and bring
ing forth life and so on. The air is fresh, the birds
are singing. It's a great time to be alive. Isn't it just
wonderful? Don't you love spring?

Well, 1 don't want to alarm anwyone. but it's not
that wonderful. You may not have noticed it yet,
but there are bugs around here. Lots of them.
That's most of the life the Earth is bringing forth.
Bugs.
Go outside and look around you. The air is full of
gnats and caterpillars. The ground is full of beetles
and caterpillars. The walls are crawling with spiders
and caterpillars. My carpet is full of God only
knows what crawly things. I don't even want to
think about it.
There are bugs all over the place. Ticks and
moths and cockroaches — huge cockroaches; I
mean really big ones — and big. ugly spiders with
hairy legs and green and yellow splotches all over
them, and those little flics that cluster around in the
shade of a building and fly into your face when
you're not looking.
They're on your food, they're in your desk,
they're in your shoes in the morning when you get
dressed. They're everywhere.
Who sent them? Where are they from? What do
the> want? Are they really as stupid as they seem?
What do they say about you when you're not
around? Can they be trusted? Why do they all have
such long Latin names if they're just bugs?
1 believe the answer to all of these questions
must be "no." No. no. a thousand times no. Em
phatically. no. Even when the answer "no" makes
no sense as a response. I believe that the answer to
ans question about bugs should be "no." Because I

don't like bugs. They're ugly and useless and they
like to crawl around and bite people and scare
them. They have no redeeming value at all.
Sure, we've been told that bugs are useful, inte
gral parts of the ecology. Part of the balance of na
ture. Of course they are: They . . . well, they do all
kinds of things . . . like. . . .
Well, they cross-pollinate plants, right?
Wrong. 1 don't belive that for a minute. All I
have is the word of a bunch of botantists for that. I
don't belive it. It's ridiculous. I think all those bugs
are just pretending to be useful so we won't get rid
of them. They've seen what we did to the ASSU
Senate. They're just afraid we'll realize we don't
need them.

You can talk to a squirrel or a bird or even a
graduate student in economics, and it'll prick up its
ears and cock its head and blink at you as if it
understood. Not a bug. You can't even pretend it's
paying attention.

And even if bugs really do cross-pollinate,
they're certainly not necessary'. As far as I'm con
cerned. if there's enough pollen in the air that I
have trouble breathing and seeing, then plants are
doing fine by themselves. More pollen distribution
they don't need.
What else do bugs do that's ecologically useful?
They eat things, a lot of them eat dead things. I
suppose that's useful; but again, bugs aren't really
necessary. We don't need bugs to eat dead things.
Anything can eat dead things. If it comes right
down to it. people can eat dead things. We could
ship all the dead stuff we don't want off to Ethiopia
— kind of like we do now. only there would be
more of it if the bugs didn't eat any first.
Bugs also eat things that are alive. W'e don't need
much of that, either. Lots of things eat things that
are alive. The only area where bugs excel, the only
things we really need them for, is to eat other bugs.

Nothing else eats bugs as well as other bugs. Of
course, that's a stupid reason to have bugs around,
just so they can eat each other. We might as well
not have them at all.
So much for the ecological value of bugs. What
about their social value? What role do bugs play in
the lives of people? What joy do they bring us?
The answer, of course, is no. They don't play any
role. They don't make good pets or companions.
They can't learn tricks: A bug won't shake hands
with your friends or fetch your Frisbee or even
chase cars. No one will come up to you and start a
conversation with you about your lovely pet bug. A
bug won't purr at you, or show affection, or curl up
in your lap and fall asleep. You can't talk to a bug.

You can talk to a squirrel or a bird or even a
graduate student in economics and it'll prick up its
ears and cock its head and blink at you as if it un
derstood. Not a bug. You can't even pretend it's
paying attention. Bugs are completely useless.
We don't need bugs. And we certainly don't
want them. I think all right-thinking people will
agree with that. Obviously the thing to do is to get
rid of them.
So what are we waiting for? Why are there still
bugs, if nobody wants them and nobody needs
them? The only way it makes sense is if somebody
is helping the bugs. There are traitors among us.
Traitors who are no better than the bugs they are
helping. Are we going to stand still for this? What
are we going to do about such treachery?
As with all the questions, the answer is no.
