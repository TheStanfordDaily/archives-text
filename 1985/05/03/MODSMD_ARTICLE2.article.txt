### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Staff writer 
Elizabeth Traugott, professor of
English and linguistics and head of
Stanford's Department of Linguistics,
will become University vice provost
and dean of graduate studies, effec
tive Sept. 1, Provost James Rosse an
nounced at yesterday's Faculty Sen
ate meeting.
Traugott will become the Univer
sity's highest-ranking woman admin
istrator.
She will succeed Gerald Lieber
man, who will return to full-time
teaching and research in the Opera
tions Research and Statistics Depart
ments.
Rosse told The Daily that Traugott
accepted the position on Wednesday
after a special search committee rec
ommended her appointment last
week.
Rosse said Traugott was "the con
sensus choice" of the committee,
which consists of faculty members
and two students.
Educated at Oxford University,
where she received a bachelor's
degree in 1960, and UC-Berkeley
(Ph.D., 1964), Traugott taught at
Cal; the University of York; and Uni-
Sialaam, Tan-,
zania. before coming to Stanford as a
part-time lecturer in linguistics and
English in 1968.
Traugott was named an associate
professor of linguistics and English in
1970 and promoted to full professor
three years later. She was also a Uni
versity fellow from 1978-80 and
received a Guggenheim Fellowship in
1983 to study semantic change.
Her new duties will include faculty
affairs, appointment processes and
affirmative action, Rosse said.
Prior to her appointment, Traugott
was involved in recommending im
plementation of University affirma
tive action policies.
In 1980, she was one of three
women named by then-Provost
Donald Kennedy to chair task forces
designed to recommend women for
consideration as direct, tenured ap
pointees.
Traugott said she is still concerned
about this issue.
"There has been little talk in the
past about how women and
minorities can get into positions of
authority," Traugott said. "In affirm
ative action, it is very important that
we think of a 'total' career and a
total' set of opportunities."
Rosse and Traugott agreed that
graduate programs will be her prin
cipal concern.
"I think that the job is primarily
concerned with the ways to support
graduate students and resources."
Traugott said.
