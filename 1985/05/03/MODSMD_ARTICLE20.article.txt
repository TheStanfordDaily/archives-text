Bathroom sex
The gay rights drum beats loudly
these days. Just two weeks ago, Gay
and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford
(GLAS) spokesman David Cuff
rendered the GLAS position on gay
sexual activity that has occurred in
Stanford restrooms. I'm curious. Was
anyone at all bothered by his
remarks? Or are we too afraid of
being labeled "homophobic" to
express any public concern?
Perhaps Cuff s charge that
homosexuals performing sex in
public bathrooms should "never" be
arrested would carry more eloquence
if indeed the activity were "merely a
public nuisance." Why sexual ex
pression of this sort is legally and
morally confined to one's private
residence, and not to be tolerated in
public, is left unsaid.
Who can measure the harm to
children who stumble upon such
conduct and leave with the impres
sion that it must be OK? Why is it
true that the thought of "tea room"
sex severely offends most American
adults? Sexuality of any type is a
powerful event and not to be treated
with casual indifference or careless
disregard of the law.
History has taught humankind
(with the probable exception of this
generation) that sexuality must be
controlled — in the sense that parti
cipants must ensure certain condi
tions of privacy. What occurs in
public places serves as a role model
of appropriate behavior to future
generations.
Arrests by police are perfectly
legitimate when homosexuals flatly
disregard cultural mores, as they
have done here on campus.
Bystanders, unaware that the facility
they chose belonged to the "tea
room" chain, have complained to the
police that they were "bothered" by
gays. I wonder if they in fact meant
"molested."
In recorded scientific literature,
approximately one-third of all child
molestation has happened at the
hands of homosexuals (though in this
country gays and lesbians combined
comprise roughly 4 percent of the
populace. San Francisco being a
notable exception). Medical re
searchers have now discovered that
certain sexually transmitted viruses
can survive on toilet seats for up to
hours after the semen has been
deposited. An contrare, Mr. Cuff, a
prudent culture has ample reason to
keep gays from indulging sexually in

our restrooms.
Curiously, this past fall a neighbor
of mine who has on occasion relieved
himself at one of the alleged "tea
rooms," noticed a large penis-sized
hole hewn from the metal wall sepa
rating two stalls at waist-height.
While David Cuff may be ignorant of
the activity involved in "tea room"
flings, the police, I suspect, are much
less so. Anonymous blowjobs should
have no part or parcel in the use of
public facilities. It is criminal and
simply wrong. (Incidentally, the
same hole has since been welded
shut with a rectangular bit of sheet
metal.)
Thus we face Cuffs most serious
charge. He claims that "GLAS does
not take a stand on the propriety of
'tea room' activity. ... It never has
been and never shall be the GLAS
Steering Committee's business to
pass moral judgment." What sort of
people compose this committee? Are
they not obligated as human beings
to protest wrongdoing?
I would suggest a more purposeful
aim on the part of GLAS. The ap
parent animosity toward Stanford
police and refusal to condemn gay
sex in public restrooms fits well with
the notion that gays and lesbians in
our country want more than the civil
rights heterosexuals share.
They desire a specifically
protected status under the law. Sure,
they demand the right to do in
private whatever their hetereosexual
counterparts may do. But they also
claim "freedom" to carry their
"bedroom" in their jeans, wherever
they go. If homosexuals happen to
be in a restroom, then the restroom
is their bedroom. If gays visit a park
such as San Francisco's Buena Vista,
then the park is their bedroom, as
amply witnessed by CBS-TV crews
in the recent documentary, "Gay
Power, Gay Politics." Neighbors
bordering the park claim their
children have been frightened away
by gays having sex along the paths
and in the bushes.
Is this how our culture ought to
redfine the rules of sexuality? Should
we adopt the GLAS attitude, i.e.,
gay sex in public restrooms is a
"mere public nuisance"? Can we
refrain from passing any moral judg
ment in the hope that all the fuss will
simply disappear? If you answer yes,
I suggest you think twice before you
next visit the local restroom. It may
be "tea time."
