# Forum discusses Tresidder bids
## 
### BRIDGET HYLAK 
"Students won't use the Coftee
House if you take it away from them
— they'll join together and organize
to get it back." one student asserted
yesterday.
The scene was a two-part public
forum designed to aid the Tresidder
Union Food Committee in its evalua
tion of the various food service com
panies that are bidding to run the
Tresidder food services for the next
five years.
According to Nancy Howe, assis
tant director of Tresidder, the current
contracts on Tresidder tood
services expire August 31. Bids for
the next five-year period were due
yesterday afternoon, and a final deci
sion on who gets the bids will be an
nounced by July 1, she said. Howe es
timated that 17 companies would
submit bids.
Todd Kerr, the Council of Presi
dents member in charge of the Coffee
House, said the Coffee House is
"decent financially. This year's bid is
as outstanding as the last one, and I m
confident that students' interests will
be protected."
Said Howe, "The bid system is a
way of finding out what new food
services can be made available to stu
dents at Tresidder."
Tresidder food services currently
include the Coffee House, Main
Course, Corner Pocket, Baker Street,
Patio Grill, Encina Station and Cater
ing. Though all contracts are up for
renewal, the contract of the student

owned-and-operated Coffee House,
currently held by the ASSU, aroused
the most debate.
Andrea Austin, chairperson of the
committee responsible for evaluating
the bids, stressed that the committee
recognizes the importance of student
involvement in the Coffee House.
"We're sensitive to the Coffee
House's unique situation." Austin
said, "and one of our goals is to main
tain its distinct atmosphere. We'll
take all factors into careful considera
tion before submitting our final re
commendation.'
Howe added, however, that stu
dent input in the Coffee House will
not give students an advantage. All
potential contractors will be
evaluated equally on the basis of the
bids they submit.
"A bid involves more than just a
proposal for a monthly sum to he paid
to the University," Howe explained.
"Potential contractors must submit a
complete description of intended
prices, management and what foods
they intend to serve," she said. She
added that the committee's final re
commendation must be approved by
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons.
Nonetheless, several students were
concerned about the bid evaluation
process. Daniel Rosen, a student
manager of the Coffee House, said.
"There's a feeling that Tresidder
doesn't like students running it. We
make all our own decisions, and we
want to make Tresidder aware how
much we want to keep it."
Efforts to "make Tresidder aware"
have included a jav-a-thon, a 24-hour
coffee-drinking marathon to gather
signatures for a petition supporting
student management of the Coffee
House.
"We're serious about this." Rosen
said. "Even though we have a good
feeling about it because we know
we'll make a good bid, we're all set to
boycott in the fall if we don't get it."
Several other audience members
spoke up in favor of keeping the Cof
fee House in the hands of the stu
dents. Maria Doelger said that giving
the Coffee House's contract to
anyone but the students would
"corrupt what the Coffee House is.

The Coffee House serves almost as
the student union which Stanford
lacks. If you take it from students'
hands, you take away their student
union."
She also said that student manage
ment, iis is the case with the Corner
Pocket, is not enough. "I'm afraid
this committee will ignore what is im
portant to us, and that is student
ownership."
