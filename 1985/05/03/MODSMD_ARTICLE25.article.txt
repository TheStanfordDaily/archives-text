## Card looks to clinch pennant at ASU 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
With two wins in this weekend's
three-game series at Arizona State,
Stanford can clinch its second Pacific
10 Southern Division title in the last
three years.
The Cardinal, ranked first in the
nation by Baseball America and
second in the ESPN-Collegiate
Baseball poll, has a 19-5 Six-Pac
record. Arizona and California trail
Stanford by five games at 14-10.
After a 1-5 start, including a three
game sweep at the hands of Stanford,
ASU has bounced back to a 12-12
conference mark. The Sun Devils are
28-32 overall.
According to ASU Coach Jim
Brock, the Sun Devils are not driven
by the prospect of being a spoiler.
"We're taking it one game at a time,
trying to get a workman-like atti
tude," he said. "We'll be there."
To say that Brock and his team
have had a traumatic season would be
more than a mild understatement. In
December, the Sun Devils were
forced to forfeit their 1984 Six-Pac
championship due to violations in
their work-study program. They were
also declared ineligible for the 1985
title, and four players were suspended
for 16 games.
Then, five weeks ago, another
scandal rocked the ASU baseball
program. It was revealed that a psy
chiatrist hired by the university as a
consultant was prescibing Nardil, an
antidepressant, to help rid players of
the tension that brings on slumps.
Unfortunately, when taken with
beer, cheese or wine, Nardil can
cause uncontrollably high blood pres
sure and even death. Because of its
potentially dangerous nature, Nardil
is usually only prescribed in cases of
extreme depression, not when some
one goes 0-for-4.

Brock said he believes that the ad
versity has had an effect on his team,
which is having a poor year by ASU
standards. "It certainly hasn't
helped," he said. "(But) I've been
proud of the way they've gone out
and played every day. We've still
played close to our potential, except
for our pitching."
Ah yes, the pitching. There are
many ways to describe the perfor

munce of the Sun Devil pitching staff,
but the statistics tell the story better
than adjectives.
Charles Scott has been ASU's stin
giest pitcher this year— with an ERA
of 5.22. The staff ERA is 6.59. Op
posing hitters are batting .318. In
March against Stanford, ASU scored
24 runs, had 42 hits and hit nine
home runs — and lost all three
games.

After the conference-opening se
ries, Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
issued a warning to future Sun Devil
opponents. "With their offense, if
they get their pitching together,
they're gonna he tough," he said.

Crossing home plate is a familiar pastime for Rick Lundblade, who
leads the Six-Pac in home runs with 19. Lundblade has a shot at the
league's Triple Crown — he is currently leading the loop with a .394
average and is second with 64 RBIs.

Cardinal shortstop John Verducci was named Six-Pac Player of the Week for a series at USC that saw him go
7-for-12 with eight RBIs.
M) 6 as a team and has blasted 90
homers.
Outfielders Barry Bonds and Todd
Brown seem headed for their second
straight selections to the All Six-Pac
team. Bonds is hitting .352 and leads
the team with IS homers. Brown has
a .358 average and has smacked 15

round-trippers.
The other big men in the Sun Devil
attack are first baseman Louie
Medina (.378), third baseman
George Lopez (.359). second
baseman Rick Morris (.344. 12 HRs)
and outfielder Mike Devereaux
(.302, 16 HRs, 50 RBIs).
Brock is confident his team will
score this weekend, but he isn't sure
how to stop the explosive Cardinal
offense. "It's probably going to be

difficult," he said.
One of Brock's biggest concerns
will be how to stop Rick Lundblade.
With his recent hot streak, the senior
first baseman has a solid chance of
winning the Six-Pac Triple Crown.
His .394 batting average leads the
league, with teammate Mark Davis
second at .380. He also tops the Six-
Pac with 19 homers and trails only
Arizona's Todd Trafton in RBIs —
66 to 64.

I lie men responsible for stopping
Lundblade and the rest of the Card
inal hitters will be Kurt Dempster (3
wins, 7 losses, 7.45 ERA) today and

With two wins in this weekend's
three-game series at Arizona State,
Stanford can clinch its second Pacific
10 Southern Division title in the last
three years.
The Cardinal, ranked first in the
nation by Baseball America and
second in the ESPN-Collegiate
Baseball poll, has a 19-5 Six-Pac
record. Arizona and California trail
Stanford by five games at 14-10.
After a 1-5 start, including a three
game sweep at the hands of Stanford,
ASU has bounced back to a 12-12
conference mark. The Sun Devils are
28-32 overall.
According to ASU Coach Jim
Brock, the Sun Devils are not driven
by the prospect of being a spoiler.
"We're taking it one game at a time,
trying to get a workman-like atti
tude," he said. "We'll be there."
To say that Brock and his team
have had a traumatic season would be
more than a mild understatement. In
December, the Sun Devils were
forced to forfeit their 1984 Six-Pac
championship due to violations in
their work-study program. They were
also declared ineligible for the 1985
title, and four players were suspended
for 16 games.
Then, five weeks ago, another
scandal rocked the ASU baseball
program. It was revealed that a psy
chiatrist hired by the university as a
consultant was prescibing Nardil, an
antidepressant, to help rid players of
the tension that brings on slumps.
Unfortunately, when taken with
beer, cheese or wine, Nardil can
cause uncontrollably high blood pres
sure and even death. Because of its
potentially dangerous nature, Nardil
is usually only prescribed in cases of
extreme depression, not when some
one goes 0-for-4.

Brock said he believes that the ad
versity has had an effect on his team,
which is having a poor year by ASU
standards. "It certainly hasn't
helped," he said. "(But) I've been
proud of the way they've gone out
and played every day. We've still
played close to our potential, except
for our pitching."
Ah yes, the pitching. There are
many ways to describe the perfor

munce of the Sun Devil pitching staff,
but the statistics tell the story better
than adjectives.
Charles Scott has been ASU's stin
giest pitcher this year— with an ERA
of 5.22. The staff ERA is 6.59. Op
posing hitters are batting .318. In
March against Stanford, ASU scored
24 runs, had 42 hits and hit nine
home runs — and lost all three
games.

After the conference-opening se
ries, Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
issued a warning to future Sun Devil
opponents. "With their offense, if
they get their pitching together,
they're gonna he tough," he said.
They haven't gotten their pitching
together, but their offense is as potent
as it was in March. ASU is hitting

Crossing home plate is a familiar pastime for Rick Lundblade, who
leads the Six-Pac in home runs with 19. Lundblade has a shot at the
league's Triple Crown — he is currently leading the loop with a .394
average and is second with 64 RBIs.

Cardinal shortstop John Verducci was named Six-Pac Player of the Week for a series at USC that saw him go
7-for-12 with eight RBIs.
M) 6 as a team and has blasted 90
homers.
Outfielders Barry Bonds and Todd
Brown seem headed for their second
straight selections to the All Six-Pac
team. Bonds is hitting .352 and leads
the team with IS homers. Brown has
a .358 average and has smacked 15

round-trippers.
The other big men in the Sun Devil
attack are first baseman Louie
Medina (.378), third baseman
George Lopez (.359). second
baseman Rick Morris (.344. 12 HRs)
and outfielder Mike Devereaux
(.302, 16 HRs, 50 RBIs).
Brock is confident his team will
score this weekend, but he isn't sure
how to stop the explosive Cardinal
offense. "It's probably going to be

difficult," he said.
One of Brock's biggest concerns
will be how to stop Rick Lundblade.
With his recent hot streak, the senior
first baseman has a solid chance of
winning the Six-Pac Triple Crown.
His .394 batting average leads the
league, with teammate Mark Davis
second at .380. He also tops the Six-
Pac with 19 homers and trails only
Arizona's Todd Trafton in RBIs —
66 to 64.
