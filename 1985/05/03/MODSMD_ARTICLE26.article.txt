# Women netters host UCLA next
## Stanford cruises by Aztecs 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
The San Diego State women's tennis team better
have enjoyed the weather here yesterday because it
certainly didn't have much else to enjoy.
Stanford, playing for the first time since regain
ing the No. I ranking, showed why nobody else
does it better and made San Diego State an 8-1 ex
ample. The Aztecs, by the way, are ranked fifth.
The Cardinal, which improved to 24-1 overall
and 12-1 in the WCAA, swept all six singles
matches, all in straight sets. It won in straight sets at
No. I doubles, and then won by default at No. 2
before the Aztecs, 24-7 overall and 7-5 in the
WCAA, ruined the shutout by taking No. 3
doubles.
To say the least. Cardinal Coach Frank Brennan
was — to use his favorite word yesterday —
"pleased." But Brennan's smile that seemingly
stretched to San Diego wasn't all for the 8-1 vic
tory.
Brennan announced his three recruits for next
year. And if they pan out, next year is not some
thing teams like San Diego State will be waiting for.
Heading the list of players is Marianne Werdel,
whose sister Alyce played — and won — No. 6

singles and No. 2 doubles yesterday. Brennan
called Werdel, who is one of the top-ranked
juniors, the No. 1 recruit in the country.
As if Werdel isn't enough to continue Stanford's
dynasty in women's tennis, Brennan also landed
what he considers the No. 3 recruit — Eleni
Rossides. Besides Werdel and R&ssides, who will
both be on scholarship, Sonja Kazazian will play on
the team as a walk-on. Brennan said Kazazian "is
probably one of the top 15 recruits."
But the way the Cardinal played yesterday, even
a recruiting class as good as next year's might not
make it noticeably better.
Stanford didn't lose a set in singles, and only
Linda Gates at No. 1 singles had to go to a tie
breaker. All told, Stanford won the six singles
matches by a combined 12-0 margin in sets and a
73-29 margin in games.
"1 was pleased with the singles," Brennan said.
"Of course, we had a little break with the lineup
from them."
Brennan was referring to the absense of San
Diego State's Linda Howell, ranked 10th nation
ally in singles. Howell, who plays No. 1 singles and
doubles for the Aztecs, had a sore shoulder and was
unable to play in either. Judging by the singles

scores, however, you get the feeling she wouldn't
have made much difference.
In the doubles, Gates and Leigh Anne Eldredge
breezed at No. 1, winning 7-6, 6-0. At No. 2, Wer
del and Patty Fendick lost the first set 7-5, won the
second 6-2, and then won the match by default
when San Diego State's Ann Moeller pulled a
muscle in her back.
The only loss of the day for Stanford was at No. 3
doubles, where Cindy MacGregor and Bleicher —
who played No. 1 and No. 2 singles, respectively —
beat Stephanie Savides and Kay Tittle, 7-6, 6-4.
"We could have won third doubles," Brennan
said. "But they're traditionally a slow-starting
team, and today they never really got going."
Next on the agenda for the Cardinal is ninth
ranked UCLA, which plays here Sunday at noon
and which fell to Stanford 8-1 in Los Angeles in
March. Sunday's match will be Stanford's final
tune-up before the NCAAs in Oklahoma City,
which begin in 13 days.
Brennan said he thinks his team, which will un
doubtedly be seeded first at nationals, has settled
down after last week, when it beat USC Saturday,
then saw freshman Anna Ivan quit the team two
days later.
