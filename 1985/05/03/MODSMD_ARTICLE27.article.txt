# Old faces return for game
## 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
Until the United States Football League came on the
scene, colleges had a monopoly on football in the
spring. The NCAA lets college teams practice for
about a month in April and May, and most teams
end that time with a scrimmage to let the players
get a feel for game conditions and help the fans re
member that September is coming and season
ticket orders are still being accepted.
In some places, these spring games are the high
light of the period between New Year's Day and
Labor Day weekend. The media descends, the in
evitable quarterback battle Ls debated, and even
ESPN has carried these games on national cable
television.
Last year, the Stanford Athletic Department
decided to try a variation on the idea. Instead of
having the Cardinal bash heads with the White, it
was decided to bring back some of the names from
past teams to take on the current varsity.
Thus was a tradition-in-the-making born. It was
not an entirely original idea — Texas A&M, for ex

ample, has its varsity play the "Former Students"
(" Alumni" apparently implies graduation) — but it
met with a good respoase from the community and
an even better respoase from the old players.
"This game really took off in terms of enthusi
asm and commitment," said Chuck Evans, a
linebacker here from 1976-79 who is the organizer
for the alumni. "We had a great response.
" A number of the guys get caught up in the emo
tion, especially when they get a chance to see their
old buddies. They renew acquaintances, make new
friends, and some of them get a chance to show
people they can still play. It's a lot of fun."
This year's game is slated for Sunday at 1 p.m. in
Stanford Stadium.
The list of names seems endless. Several current
professional players will be on hand, including John
Elway — son of current Coach Jack Elway — Dar
rin Nelson, Tony Hill, James Lofton and Milt
McColl. The pros' contracts preclude them from
playing, but Lofton did sneak in for a few plays last
year.
Guy Benjamin, who was with the San Francisco

49ers until last year, will share the quarterback
duties with 1972 Rose Bowl QB Don Bunce, now
the varsity team physician.
Other alums include John Macauley, Blaine Nye,
Scott La id I aw. George Buehler, Gordie Ceresino,
Kevin Bates, Mike Dotterer and John Paye Sr.,
father of the current varsity quarterback, John
Paye Jr.
More recent grads and grads-to-be are Pat
Mitchel, Mike Wyman, Shaun Avant, Eric Price
und Dwain Hamilton from hist fall's team, and
John Bergeren, Jim Clymer, Don Stubblefield,
Steve Aimonetti and Ken Orvick from the 1983
squad.
Leading the current varsity will be Paye, fullback
Brad Muster, linebacker Matt Soderlund, tackle
John Barns, halfback Thomas Henley and safety
Mark Hashimoto.
Tickets are $ 1 for students and $3 for adults. All
are general admission. They will be on sale today at
the athletic department and on game day at Gate 2
of the stadium.

Current Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway (above) returned to
the Farm for last year's alumni game, but was relegated to signing
autographs instead of playing against his dad's team. The varsity took
advantage of his absence to post a 20-0 shutout. The members of this
year's defensive front (right) are taking nothing for granted this time,
though, hitting the bags in preparation for ex-Stanford linemen like
Blaine Nye and Steve Aimonetti.
