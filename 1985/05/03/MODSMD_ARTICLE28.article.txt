# Stanford men's tennis, track to host Cal
## Netters close season today 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
Today is the last regular-season
contest for the Stanford men's tennis
team as the fourth-ranked Cardinal
hosts No. 13 California at 1:30 p.m.
on the Varsity Courts in a Pacific 10
Conference match.
At this point, Stanford is assured a
high seed in the NCAA champion
ships May 18-22 in Athens, Ga. The
Cardinal is currently 22-3 overall, 6-3
in the Pac-10.
The Cal match isn't being over
looked by the Stanford players or
Coach Dick Gould, however. The
Cardinal doesn't plan to go into the

national championships coming off a
loss.
At No. 13, Cal cannot be ignored,
and Stanford will have to prove it can
beat its cross-Bay rival if it hopes to
beat teams like UCLA and USC at
the NCAAs.
Stanford's No. 1 player, Dan
Goldie, said that even though Stan
ford is going to Athens regardless of
today's outcome, "Every one
counts." His own match at the top
singles position might matter to him
more than usual, however.
Goldie lost to Cal's No. 1 player,
Steve DeVries, when the two teams
last met in Pac-10 competition, on

March 27. Goldie won the first set of
that match, 7-6, before rain delayed
the competition a full week.
When play resumed, Goldie lost
the next two sets, 6-3, 6-0, and
dropped his second match of the
season.
"1 just didn't play well in the third
set," Goldie said. DeVries doesn't
have a main weapon, according to
Goldie, but is "an all-court player â€”
pretty much what I am."
DeVries is currently ranked 20th in
the national Head Intercollegiate
Tennis Standings. Goldie is No. 1,
despite losing four matches this
season in the space of one week.
From March 30 to April 6, Goldie
lost his No. 1 singles matches to
Arizona's Benji Papal, DeVries,
USC's Todd Witsken, and UCLA's
Michael Kures.
The streak has ended apparently in
time for NCAAs. And Goldie, even
though he "wasn't too concerned
about" the possible loss of the top na
tional ranking after the series of
losses, can't complain about going
into the NCAA individuals with a No.
1 seeding.
Stanford's overall team record
against the Bears is good, but there is
a history of slow Cardinal starts.
Gould was pleased with his team's
start in the last Cal match, but the
rain delay dampened the early lead
and the Cardinal won by a final score
of 6-3.
Gould said Cal, although not a
great threat, "is not at all a bad
team." DeVries carries most of the
Bears' weight as the team's sole
ranked singles player. He is also
ranked 24th in doubles with partner
Chris Schoop.
Stanford gets another chance to
play the Bears on May 11 in a mixed
team match. It will be the Cardinal's
second indoor match of the season
and will pit a combined Stanford
men's and women's team against a
mixed Cal team in Maples Pavilion.
