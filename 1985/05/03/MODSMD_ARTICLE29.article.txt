# Track's Big Meet tomorrow
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Staff sportswriter 
Coming off some fine individual
performances at the Mt. SAC Relays,
the Stanford men's and women's
track teams will swing back into dual
meet competition tomorrow, going
head to head against California on
the Stanford Stadium track.
A couple of streaks will be on the
line this weekend. The Stanford
women will try to make it three
straight over their Cal counterparts
while the Cardinal men will hope to
put their feet down and end a 14-year
losing string.
The task will not be easy, however.
The Cal men's team, considered by
Stanford Coach Brooks Johnson to
be "one of the best dual-meet teams
in the country," enters the meet with
an impressive 11 -1 record, riding the
wake of an 89-74 victory over a highly
touted Oregon team in Eugene.
The Bears' lone loss came at the
hands of UCLA, which still owns an
undefeated record for the season.
Johnson expects the Cardinal men
to do well in both the pole vault and
the hammer, but added, "The prob
lems in the sprints ultimately kill us."
The most intense competition be
tween the two men's teams will most
like be seen in the middle-distance
and distance events, strong points for
both squads.
The Cardinal women, 5-3 in dual
meet competition, should have an
easier time against the 1-3 Bears,
though Johnson remains wary.
"They seem to have a void in their
high-jump lineup, but they still have
quite a few good athletes. They won't
shake up or scare anyone in the na
tionals â€” it comes down to quality
against quantity," Johnson said.
When the Cardinal meets Cal, in
any sort of sporting competition, the
word "rivalry" usually pops up.
Johnson, however, views this meet as
"any other meet."
"Cal's just another team," Johnson

said. "They wear blue and yellow,
and we wear cardinal and white, so
what the hell difference does it
make.
"If they wore purple and gold, we
would still try to do the best as we
can. ... If it were basketball or foot
ball, then maybe we would get in the
rivalry bullshit," Johnson added.
Entering this weekend's meet,
several Cardinal athletes will be
trying to add to personal bests set last
weekend.
For the Stanford women's team.

400-meter hurdler Pam Board posted
a season's best last weekend with her
time of 60.5 1 seconds, just a second
and-a-half oft" the NCAA qualifying
time.
Shotputter Pam Dukes, already
qualified for the NC A As, put her best
throw of the season, 50 feet, 9'/5
inches.
For the men. freshmen javelin
throwers Fred Mondragon and Dave
Pickett recorded throws of 228-7 and
214-3, each a personal best for the
season.
