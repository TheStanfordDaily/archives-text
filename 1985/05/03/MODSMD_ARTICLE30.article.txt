## 
### DAVE DUTCHER Senior sportswriter 
I he Stanford softball team s season
will come full circle, after more than
three months and 50 games, follow
ing its final games tomorrow and Sun
day .
Ihe Cardinal, I 3-4 will play in a
triangular at I resno against Fresno
State and UC -Santa Barbara. Stan
ford will face each team once each
day.
It was in Stanford's first action of
the season that it faced Santa Bar
bara. in that team's tournament the
first three days of February. The
Cardinal lost twice to the Gauehos in
that double-round-robin tourney.
"They were all right," Stanford
Coach Kathy Lincoln said of Santa
Barbara. "They're beatable."
However, Lincoln said Fresno
State is a "strong team. The Bull
dogs currently are leading the North
ern Pacific Athletic Conference and
are ranked in the country's top 10.
Looking back on this season, Lin-

coln said, "It has been a long season,
and we're tired. We did overextend
ourselvesâ€” we played a lot of games.
We'll definitely cut out season back
next year."
"I don't want the kids to even think
about softball for about a month,"
Lincoln continued. "Then we're
going to get ready for next year."
Stanford loses only one senior.
Cathy Taft, but because no players
have been awarded scholarships, they
have less of an obligation to play next
season.
Lincoln said she's looking forward
to a lot of familiar faces next year "as
long as they don't get discouraged
about this year and realize things are
going to get better and stick with it."
The lack of scholarships, not
surprisingly, has hurt Stanford's
chances in the high school softball tal
ent pool. Lincoln said five prospects
who indicated interest in softball
were not offered admission.
