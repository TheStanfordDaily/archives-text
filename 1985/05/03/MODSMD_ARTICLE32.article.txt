LOS ANGELES <AP) â€” Pacific
10 Conference basketball coaches
want their players to meet with an
EBI agent or "other qualified per
son" before the start of practice next
fall to discuss the implications of
drugs and gambling and the links be
tween the two. it was reported
yesterday.
The coaches have asked the confer
ence administrative committee to
make it mandatory for each team to
schedule such a meeting, according to
Pac-10 Commissioner Tom Hansen.
The conference office is compiling
a list of qualified individuals, includ
ing FBI agents, the Los Angeles
Herald Examiner reported. Such a
move comes in the wake of the drug

and point shaving scandal at I ulane.
Although professional sports
leagues and several individual col
leges such as Stanford have brought
in law enforcement officials to ad
dress theii players, the Pac-10 is
believed to be the first college confer
ence to do so.
"The Pac -10 basketball coaches
are concerned about heading off po
tential problems." Arizona Coach
Lute Olson, the chairman of the
league's basketball coaches, said.
"The print and electronic media need
to cease promotion of the college bas
ketball betting lines.
"We need to counsel athletes on
the evils of drugs and gambling as
soon as they arrive on campus.
