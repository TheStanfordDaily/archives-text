# Diversions
## Neighboring areas offer array of biking excursions 
### 
Spring has sprung, and many of us have an urgent desire
to be out in the sun, enjoying all the fringe benefits of our
prime location. Unfortunately, we don't always have the
time to take a whole day off and go to the beach, the wine
country or the mountains. Lucky for us, there are many
picturesque and fun spots so close to campus that a few
hours provides enough time for a short but unhurried
getaway.
If you have a bike, youre all set to discover Stanford's
surrounding area with ease, and either of the following
itineraries guarantees you a delightful afternoon of biking
and picnicking. Furthermore, the itineraries are flexible:
You can adapt either or both to your available time and
your current physical shape. The first overall plan is to
bicycle to Woodside, put together a picnic at Robert's
Market, and tote it to the picnic spot of your choice,
where you can spend as much or as little time as you like
before heading back to campus. The second itinerary is an
easy trip to the nearby Baylands Natural Preserve, an
ideal location to observe a variety of wildlife.
Biking to Woodside
The ride to Woodside is not so difficult that you won't
have time to look at the scenery, yet there are enough ups
and downs to ensure you are getting the benefits of
aerobic exercise. Between the sleepy horses and the roll
ing green hills, the countryside is distinctly reminiscent of
Vermont and Connecticut, two states that attract bikers
by the droves in summer. As we peered down various
driveways, attempting to glimpse the elegant estates hid
den behind towering trees and bushes, we noticed that
Woodside residents appear to share a penchant for ornate
gateposts and decorative stone figurines.
At a moderate pace, it takes about 45 minutes to reach
Woodside. Simply head toward Sand Hill Road and cross
Interstate 280 to get to Whiskey Hill Road. Follow Whis
key Hill to the right until it dead-ends at Woodside Road,
a quick one-and-a-half miles later. The village appears
unexpectedly as you round one of the road's gentle
curves, and seems not to interrupt the preceding
landscape at all. As the word "village" suggests,
Woodside is small and has that feeling of a close commu:
nity. You expect everyone to be friendly and familiar, and
they are. There seems to be one of everything here — and
only one. Robert's Market thus holds the distinguished
position of being the supermarket, complete with
delicatessen. Inside, you'll find everything you need to
create a scrumptious picnic for yourself; outside you'll
find a welcome water fountain — it's around the corner of
the building to the right of the entrance.
You will probably want to wander around inside
Robert's for a little while just to get a sense of your many
choices. The store has a relaxed atmosphere and is pleas
ant to explore. As you enter, you'll see a small but com
plete produce section, where you might want to get some

fresh fruit to go with your lunch. Continuing into the
store, there is a mouth-watering display of roasting chick
ens, which can make a tasty, if somewhat messy, picnic
item. For a meal that requires less effort on your part, the
deli will prepare a variety of sandwiches. In addition to
the usual deli selection of meats and cheeses, you can
choose from several flavorful pates. We especially liked
the country pate (an Americanized pate de compagne),
but suggest that you skip having mayonnaise on your pate
sandwich; the French would never do it, and for good rea
son. The pate includes all the textures and spices sufficient
to complete a sandwich all by itself. All sandwiches are
less than $3, and come on your choice of bread.
Robert's also has many salads and prepared entrees
which can round out or beef up your meal. Marinated ar
tichoke hearts, tomatoes, mushrooms and avocado come
separately or in a medley, and you will also see picnic
favorites such as carrot-raisin and potato salad. If you
should happen to want something hot, try some
homemade chili, a burrito, or one of their attractive pasta
creations.
Having selected your main course, you will now be
faced with the decision of what to have for dessert.
Robert's has all bases covered in this respect. At the deli,
you will find carrot cake, baklava and a Mexican sweet
called a bunelo (essentially a sweetened fried flour tortilla
with cinnamon), as well as other freshly baked treats. Al

ternatively, you may wish to pick up some cookies or ice
cream — or both — from the aisles stocked with the usual
favorites.
Once you have packed your goodies into the backpack
Stanford students are seldom without (we were able to put
together a very nice picnic for two for less than $9), you
will be ready to choose a setting for your meal. Sur
rounded as Woodside is by beautiful countryside, it offers
easy access to many appealing spots. Be careful, however,
that you don't camp out in someone's backyard, as much
of the area is private property. An ideal spot for picnick
ing, sunbathing and playing soccer, Frisbee or football is
Willie McCovey field, just a few minutes from Robert's.
When you exit Robert's, just take a left on Highway 84
and ride until you see the town hall on your left.
Woodside's town hall again imitates New England-style
architecture, resembling the cross between a church and a
local schoolhouse seen so often in the Eastern meeting
halls. The park itself is behind the town hall. There is a
softball field divided by a row of picnic tables from a soc
cer field and a grassy lawn perfect for playing Frisbee. Be
tween the fields and the road lie the local high school
buildings, and on the other side lie tree-covered hills.
The best news of all is that the trip back to campus takes
about half the time — and half the effort — of the trip to
Woodside. It is almost all downhill, so the overstuffed pic
nicker or over-tired Frisbee-player shouldn't worry about

making it back in one piece. So, next time you feel the
urge to enjoy a bit of the outdoor life, you might consider
this excursion as one good way to spend an afternoon in
the area. You don't have to get in your car to get off
campus!
Biking to Baylands Natural Preserve
Unknown to many students, Baylands Natural Preserve
is only minutes from campus. At the preserve, you can ob
serve colorful ducks and pheasant, as well as graceful
cranes and darting sandpipers. In addition to the
marshlands, there are meadows also inhabited by a variety
of wildlife. Well-used trails for walking and bicycling wind
their way through the meadowlands, finally ending up at a
park complete with a small sailing lake and a boat dock
surrounded by benches and a grassy area.
The baylands can be reached in 20 to 30 minutes by
taking Embarcadero Road to St. Francis Way. At St.
Francis Way, signs direct you to a pedestrian bridge which
facilitates crossing Highway 101. From there, you just
make a right on East Bayshore Road and follow it several
hundred feet. Cross the road to get on the baylands
bicycle path, which runs parallel to the marshlands. High

way 101 will be on your right for the first mile or so. Then,
a sign gives you the choice of entering the meadowlands
and leaving pavement behind, or proceeding to San An
tonio Road. Turning left, you'll follow a path lined on
both sides by tall bushes of bright yellow It is
really very beautiful, and soon opens up again so that
before you lie the salt pools.
Depending on the time of day, you may pass groups of
joggers or people taking a leisurely stroll. Especially
during the workweek, the trails are well-trodden by those
working close by who run during their lunch hours.
The natural preserve suddenly ends, and one is con
fronted by well-groomed lawns and a man-made sailing
lake. A map of the area indicates that a restaurant and
convention center are in the planning stages. A golf
course is just a little further down the path. Finally, you'll
come to the park entrance through which cars drive. This
is reached by taking the Stierlin Road exit off Highway
101. The parking lot is located next to the lake and golf
course. Also at the entrance to the park is an information
center, complete with a park attendant who can provide
you with a map of the preserve. You'll also find a water
fountain here.
Bicycling to the Buylands Natural Preserve and the
sailing lake is extremely enjoyable, though hardly
rigorous. The only hill to speak of is the slight incline at
the beginning of the pedestrian bridge on the return trip.
Consequently, if you are an avid bicyclist, you may find
the ride too tame. But if you simply enjoy pleasant sur
roundings and being outdoors, the ride Ls a good one, and
the grassy lawns surrounding the lake are ideal for a picnic
or an afternoon spend studying in the sun.
On your return, you are likely to be thirsty, if not
hungry. Town and Country Village offers a variety of
places to go for a quick thirst-quencher or a bite to eat. In

fact, Hobee's Haven, described below, serves breakfast,
lunch and dinner. Its bill of fare is mainly composed of
healthy dishes, and includes a salad bar complete with the
usual lettuce and vegetables, as well as pastas, homemade
bread crumbs, fresh fruits and soups.

taurants have previously occupied the same space, but
they all went out of business. Hobee's, however, gives
every indication of being as successful as its namesake fur
ther down El Camino toward Mountain View.
Hobee's architecture and decor skillfully blend the res
taurant's indoor and outdoor areas, making the transition
from a naturalistic bike ride to breakfast smooth and
pleasant. In fact, it's hard to define at what point you en
ter Hobee's. Seated patrons gaze out from a semi
enclosed porch at those waiting their turn outside the
entrance. Complimentary coffee and slices of fresh fruit
are provided on a table outside, turning the area into an
informal coffee house. This thoughtfulness makes waiting
almost pleasant.

Such was the scene that greeted our hungry eyes when
we arrived shortly before 10 a.m. We had chosen to hike
early to avoid the growing heat. Despite the hungry
crowd milling about outside, our wait was only 15
minutes, so we procured some water and returned outside
to claim one of the nearby benches.
Hobee's Haven is ideally situated not only because it is
across the street from campus, but also, as it is within
Town and Country Village, because customers can stroll
around the various shops while waiting for a table. Cloth
ing boutiques cater to a variety of fashions, including new
wave and preppy. A newly opened English tea and scone
shop sells a variety of foreign and American chocolates.

jams, teas and mixes for preparing scones, shortbread and
Indian fry-bread.
Once we were seated, someone immediately came to
our table offering us a choice of coffee or cinnamon
orange tea. We chose the tea, which had a richly sweet
smell and tasted delicious. The tea is also served cold over
ice, and refills on either are complimentary. The waitress
appeared next, and since we had not eaten at Hobee's
previously, we asked for a few more minutes. On one side
of the menu are the breakfast items, which are served all
day, and the other side is the lunch menu. Omelettes are
listed on both sides of the menu, and appear to be a par
ticular favorite.
We opted for scrambled eggs, however. There is a vari

ety of ingredients you can choose to have added to your
eggs, and I selected scrambled eggs Florentine ($3.75),
which are eggs with fresh spinach, mushrooms and cheese.
Served with the eggs are your choice of hash browns, cot
fee cake or toast. 1 chose the coffee cake, for which
Hobee's is famous. My friend and I also split an order of
hash browns served with cheese, tomato, onions and
sprouts ($2.95). She ordered three whole-wheat pancakes
($2.95). Once our order was placed, we relaxed in the
warmth of the sun shining through the skylight onto our
table, and sipped our tea.
The waitress returned in record time with our break
fasts, which were delicious. Everything looked extremely
appetizing, and garnishes added a special, colorful touch
to plates. Hobee's is obviously attentive to detail, for
everything is tastefully served, from the water with its slice
of lemon to fresh-squeezed orange juice with its can
taloupe garnishes.
The food was both cooked to perfection and still piping
hot. Our waitress, kept busy by her continuously tilled
section, was always smiling and attentive, as if she wasn t
aware that many waitresses in her position would by
harried by such demanding responsibilities.
We immediately dug in, sampling things from all three
plates. The coffee cake had a delicious cinnamon topping
and a hole in the middle for the melting butter. The
pancakes were served with butter and a miniature pitcher
of maple syrup. Though Hobee's was crowded, and the
crowd did not appear to be getting any lighter, we were
not rushed through our meal. We savored every bite and
left the restaurant feeling very satisfied after an exhilarat
ing ride and fantastic breakfast.
Walking outside again, we noticed that the specials'
chalkboard, which upon our entrance listed "Almost Lor
raine Scrambleds" as the day's special, had changed to
"Dead Head Scrambleds" in honor of the Grateful Dead
concertgoers who stopped by Hobee's first for a healthy
bite to eat.
