# Diversions
## Neighboring areas offer array of biking excursions 
### 
Spring has sprung, and many of us have an urgent desire
to be out in the sun, enjoying all the fringe benefits of our
prime location. Unfortunately, we don't always have the
time to take a whole day off and go to the beach, the wine
country or the mountains. Lucky for us, there are many
picturesque and fun spots so close to campus that a few
hours provides enough time for a short but unhurried
getaway.
If you have a bike, youre all set to discover Stanford's
surrounding area with ease, and either of the following
itineraries guarantees you a delightful afternoon of biking
and picnicking. Furthermore, the itineraries are flexible:
You can adapt either or both to your available time and
your current physical shape. The first overall plan is to
bicycle to Woodside, put together a picnic at Robert's
Market, and tote it to the picnic spot of your choice,
where you can spend as much or as little time as you like
before heading back to campus. The second itinerary is an
easy trip to the nearby Baylands Natural Preserve, an
ideal location to observe a variety of wildlife.
Biking to Woodside
The ride to Woodside is not so difficult that you won't
have time to look at the scenery, yet there are enough ups
and downs to ensure you are getting the benefits of
aerobic exercise. Between the sleepy horses and the roll
ing green hills, the countryside is distinctly reminiscent of
Vermont and Connecticut, two states that attract bikers
by the droves in summer. As we peered down various
driveways, attempting to glimpse the elegant estates hid
den behind towering trees and bushes, we noticed that
Woodside residents appear to share a penchant for ornate
gateposts and decorative stone figurines.
At a moderate pace, it takes about 45 minutes to reach
Woodside. Simply head toward Sand Hill Road and cross
Interstate 280 to get to Whiskey Hill Road. Follow Whis
key Hill to the right until it dead-ends at Woodside Road,
a quick one-and-a-half miles later. The village appears
unexpectedly as you round one of the road's gentle
curves, and seems not to interrupt the preceding
landscape at all. As the word "village" suggests,
Woodside is small and has that feeling of a close commu:
nity. You expect everyone to be friendly and familiar, and
they are. There seems to be one of everything here — and
only one. Robert's Market thus holds the distinguished
position of being the supermarket, complete with
delicatessen. Inside, you'll find everything you need to
create a scrumptious picnic for yourself; outside you'll
find a welcome water fountain — it's around the corner of
the building to the right of the entrance.
You will probably want to wander around inside
Robert's for a little while just to get a sense of your many
choices. The store has a relaxed atmosphere and is pleas
ant to explore. As you enter, you'll see a small but com
plete produce section, where you might want to get some

fresh fruit to go with your lunch. Continuing into the
store, there is a mouth-watering display of roasting chick
ens, which can make a tasty, if somewhat messy, picnic
item. For a meal that requires less effort on your part, the
deli will prepare a variety of sandwiches. In addition to
the usual deli selection of meats and cheeses, you can
choose from several flavorful pates. We especially liked
the country pate (an Americanized pate de compagne),
but suggest that you skip having mayonnaise on your pate
sandwich; the French would never do it, and for good rea
son. The pate includes all the textures and spices sufficient
to complete a sandwich all by itself. All sandwiches are
less than $3, and come on your choice of bread.
Robert's also has many salads and prepared entrees
which can round out or beef up your meal. Marinated ar
tichoke hearts, tomatoes, mushrooms and avocado come
separately or in a medley, and you will also see picnic
favorites such as carrot-raisin and potato salad. If you
should happen to want something hot, try some
homemade chili, a burrito, or one of their attractive pasta
creations.
Having selected your main course, you will now be
faced with the decision of what to have for dessert.
Robert's has all bases covered in this respect. At the deli,
you will find carrot cake, baklava and a Mexican sweet
called a bunelo (essentially a sweetened fried flour tortilla
with cinnamon), as well as other freshly baked treats. Al

ternatively, you may wish to pick up some cookies or ice
cream — or both — from the aisles stocked with the usual
favorites.
Once you have packed your goodies into the backpack
Stanford students are seldom without (we were able to put
together a very nice picnic for two for less than $9), you
will be ready to choose a setting for your meal. Sur
rounded as Woodside is by beautiful countryside, it offers
easy access to many appealing spots. Be careful, however,
that you don't camp out in someone's backyard, as much
of the area is private property. An ideal spot for picnick
ing, sunbathing and playing soccer, Frisbee or football is
Willie McCovey field, just a few minutes from Robert's.
When you exit Robert's, just take a left on Highway 84
and ride until you see the town hall on your left.
Woodside's town hall again imitates New England-style
architecture, resembling the cross between a church and a
local schoolhouse seen so often in the Eastern meeting
halls. The park itself is behind the town hall. There is a
softball field divided by a row of picnic tables from a soc
cer field and a grassy lawn perfect for playing Frisbee. Be
tween the fields and the road lie the local high school
buildings, and on the other side lie tree-covered hills.
The best news of all is that the trip back to campus takes
about half the time — and half the effort — of the trip to
Woodside. It is almost all downhill, so the overstuffed pic
nicker or over-tired Frisbee-player shouldn't worry about

making it back in one piece. So, next time you feel the
urge to enjoy a bit of the outdoor life, you might consider
this excursion as one good way to spend an afternoon in
the area. You don't have to get in your car to get off
campus!
Biking to Baylands Natural Preserve
Unknown to many students, Baylands Natural Preserve
is only minutes from campus. At the preserve, you can ob
serve colorful ducks and pheasant, as well as graceful
cranes and darting sandpipers. In addition to the
marshlands, there are meadows also inhabited by a variety
of wildlife. Well-used trails for walking and bicycling wind
their way through the meadowlands, finally ending up at a
park complete with a small sailing lake and a boat dock
surrounded by benches and a grassy area.
The baylands can be reached in 20 to 30 minutes by
taking Embarcadero Road to St. Francis Way. At St.
Francis Way, signs direct you to a pedestrian bridge which
facilitates crossing Highway 101. From there, you just
make a right on East Bayshore Road and follow it several
hundred feet. Cross the road to get on the baylands
bicycle path, which runs parallel to the marshlands. High

Baylands Natural Preserve offers an escape from the bustle of student life. It is located within a 30-minute bike ride of campus.
