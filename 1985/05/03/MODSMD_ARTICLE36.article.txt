Some restaurants pretend to be
something that they are not, and fail
miserably in their misguided attempts.
Class Reunion is not one such es
tablishment: When you walk in the
door, you can instantly understand
how easy it would be to hold a real
class reunion in the restaurant's
confines.
Class Reunion is a new addition to
the abundant list of area eateries, but
one that should not slide past without
consideration. It makes no attempt to
play a role for which it is not suited;
rather, it is a good place to go for an
informal or impromtu lunch, dinner
or brunch.
The decor resembles that of a ferry
boat, with the impression made by
the wrought iron filigree and white
washed wood paneling reinforced by
the many old photographs of ferries
and sternwheelers scattered about the
walls. This is not a place to come for a
romantic evening out, for the booths
are well lit by stained glass lamps hang
ing over each table, the tables are
wide across, and the booths are large
enough to accommodate four friends
easily. It is, however, a good place to
come for comfortable dining at

reasonable prices.
With music by the Stray Cats and
the Beatles wafting softly through the
air, Class Reunion seems to be striv
ing for a younger crowd of patrons:
Most of the diners there at 8 p.m. on
a Saturday evening confirm this the
ory. There is a dance floor, complete
with elaborate disc jockey facilities,
which opens up for activity Wednes
day through Saturday nights from 9
p.m.- 1 a.m. Nevertheless, the wide
range of items on the menu makes
Class Reunion worth visits by parents
and grandparents as well as the
younger crowd.
The menu begins with appetizers,
ranging in price from onion rings
($1.75) to chicken fingers ($4.95)
and including deep-fried zucchini and
artichoke hearts, potato skins and
the nearly required nachos. The di
versity of the menu would do Dean
Jean proud, for it ranges from
seafood to salads to hamburgers.
The service is quick, and the
waitresses are pleasant. Soon after we
were seated, our cocktails arrived,
followed soon by a basket of french
bread. The dinner did not take very
long to arrive, and was piping hot
when it did.
There are five beef entrees,
including prime rib, and they
vary in price from the sirloin steak
($9.95) to the filet mignon ($12.95).

My companion had the New York
steak selection ($11.95), and was
very pleased with his choice. It came
cooked to order and was of a good
medium size.
All entree selections come with
fresh vegetables, choice of potato or
rice, and choice of soup or salad. The
soup of the day was a delicious clam
chowder in a good-sized bowl, but the
salad was little more than a pile of
lettuce with a minimum of adorn
ments.
There are also four chicken dishes
on the menu, — chicken Jerusalem
($10.50), Saltimbocca ($9.50),
Teriyaki ($9.50), and Dijon ($8.95).
I had the fourth and appreciated it
immensely. The mustard sauce was
indeed piquant, and tingled the taste
buds without overpowering them.
The meal was quite filling; I found
myself satisfied by dinner throughout
the remainder of the evening. My
dinner companion also was quite
satiated by his main course, so we re
luctantly passed over the dessert
menu.
Class Reunion rounds out its
entree list with three seafood choices
and a selection of five pasta dishes.
The seafood, Pacific red snapper
($8.50), Teriyaki Mahi Mahi ($8.25),
and the trout almondine ($6.95) all
come with the same choice of addi
tions as the beef and chicken choices.

The pastas, which are priced between
$6.95 and $8.95, come with salad,
bread and butter, and vegetables.
The menu takes a turn for the more
casual with the grouping of Reunion
burgers. The namesake is the tradi
tional one-third pound patty ($3.75),
and there are six variations offered
from this base. These include the
Tex-Mex, a burger smothered with
salsa ($4.75) and the St. Tropez, cov
ered with blue cheese and mush
rooms and served on rye ($4.95). All
selections are served with fries and
garnish.
Seven sandwich selections are in
cluded, topped by the Midnight Spe
cial of roast beef, turkey, ham, Mon
terey Jack and the "left side of the
garden" on a french roll ($5.75).
Also offered are the Philly steak
sandwich ($5.45) and hot chicken
salad on a croissant ($4.65). Two
soups, French onion au gratin ($2.50)
and the soup of the day, combine with
three special salad options to finish
off the main courses. The salads are
seafood Louie ($8.95), Cobb salad
($6.95), and the Reunion salad in
cluding diced chicken ($7.95)
For those with more ambitious ap
petites than ours, the menu lists five
dessert options, ranging in price from
gelato ($1.50) to Tommy's Special
Chocolate Lover's Delight ($2.95).
Class Reunion is also open for

lunch, from 11:15 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The menu is different than the dinner
list, but includes all of the burgers and
sandwiches on the dinner list. In addi
tion, there is an expanded list of both
sandwiches and salads for lunch, with
the prices comparable to dinner. The
list of lunch entrees is also to be
found on the brunch menu, in addi

tion to the traditional omelette and
eggs benedict selections, and the New
York steak and eggs option. Brunch
is served from ll a.m.-3 p.m. on
both Saturday and Sunday.
