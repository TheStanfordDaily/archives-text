Sunrise (1927)
Pacific Film Archive. Berkeley
This glorious late silent is often used as
an example of the influence of the Ger
man Expressionists on American movies
in the 1920s and '30s. The director was
F.W. Murnau, and the story he trans
formed was a sentimental romance about
the country boy (George O'Brien) who
goes to the big city and forgets his faith ul
wife (Janet Gaynor). No director ever did
so much for Gaynor, who is hardly
cloying at all and in fact achieves some
moving effects. (She took the first
Academy Award for her work in this
movie as well as "Seventh Heaven" and
"Street Angel.") Murnau and "Sunrise'
were almost definitely the source of the
explosive German director Kammerling
and his pastoral movie in the Kaufman
and Hart spoof "Once in a Lifetime."
Plays Thursday with "Journey into the
Night."
On the Waterfront (1954)
Kresge Auditorium
Terry Malloy, has-been fighter turned
dock worker, represented the smashed
dreams of a generation when this film was
released in the mid-50s, and there is still
much in this portrait of a decent, inex
pressive guy trying to deal with the web
of corruption he is caught in to move
audiences. Crude as parts of Budd Schul
berg's script (out of his novel) are, and
despite Karl Maiden's characteristic mug
ging in the role of the priest, the movie
still packs a hell of a punch. As Terry,
Marlon Brando gives his most amazing
early performance; one can just imagine
how the audiences of the time responded
to those magnetic Neanderthal looks and
the impassioned earnestness of his acting.
Eva Marie Saint is excellent and Rod
Steiger is also memorable, but Brando
blows everyone else off the screen. Di

rected by Elia Kazan, whom every young
actor in America was dying to work with
(having discovered Brando — for "A
Streetcar Named Desire" — he went on
to find James Dean), shot by Boris Kauf
man, and with a classic Leonard
Bernstein score.
Plays tonight at 9.
Effi Briest (1977)
Haus Mitteleuropa
Rainer Werner Fassbinder's most
respectable movie (except perhaps for his
lengthy television adaptation of "Berlin
Alexanderplatz") was this rendering of
the Theodor Fontane novel, starring
Hanna Schygulla. Practically a definition
of the art house film, this carefully
detailed period piece moves so slowly
that you feel as if you're stuck in an air
less compartment on a broken-down
train somewhere in the German
countryside: The landscape is beautiful,
but you aren't going anywhere, and after
a while you can't breathe. The film is well
made, though; it marked one of Fass
binder's first departures from the rickety
formal experimentation that first won
him the attention of European critics.
Plays Thursday at 7:30.
Another Country (1984)
Cubberley Auditorium
Marek Kanievska's film version of the
Julian Mitchell play about how Guy
Burgess (here named Guy Bennett and
played by Rupert Everett) came to be a
famous Soviet agent. It's an intelligent
piece of dramatic writing, plausibly built
on a well-made-play structure, with rea
sonably rounded characters for the most
part; Mitchell has translated the work to
the screen gracefully, and Kanievska has
directed a skilled cast (particularly
Everett) in a clear, steady, unhysterical

fashion. But it's an awfully senate movie
— fairly absorbing but unmoving, and be
wilderingly coy in its depiction of the
sexual practices of the Eton boys among
whom it is set. Perhaps if it weren't all of
a piece — if the dialogue had some un
resolved tension instead ofjust polish and
an acceptable level of wit — Kanievska's
restraint would seem a greater virtue. As
it is, he appears to hold in check what is
already self-controlled, placing the movie
in a double bind.
Plays Tuesday evening at 8.
Phantom India (1972)
U.C.Theater. Berkeley: York. San Fran
cisco
Louis Malle begins his seven-part doc
umentary by explaining that though he
lived in India for months, training his
camera on everything he could discover,
he never felt he'd even started to unravel
the country's great mystery. We are the
beneficiaries of his quest, however, and
his refusal to interpret — to seize the
traditional omniscient point of view of
the documentarian — makes this one of
the most moral non-fiction films ever
made; it's comparable in this way to
James Agee's great literary document of
the Depression, "Let Us Now Praise Fa
mous Men." And it's altogether ex
traordinary.
Parts 1-3 play Wednesday at the York;
Parts 4 and 5 play Monday at the
U.C.Theater.
College (1927)
U.C.Theater, Berkeley
Buster Keaton's last independent
feature was this heavy-handed comedy,
credited to James W. Home. Owing a
transparent debt to Harold Lloyd's "The
Freshman," released two years earlier, it
cast Keaton as a scholar who essays

sports in an attempt to endear himself to
the most popular girl in his freshman class
(Ann Cornwall). Keaton's genius for
physical comedy is so celerated that one
watches his exhibitions of athletic incom
petence with difficulty: the inevitable
scene in which he displays his facility in
the course of rescuing his sweetheart
from the cluthes of a bully (Harold
Goodwin) comes wittily but too late to
redeem the picture. The cast includes
Florence Turner as Keaton's mother,
and. sorely underused. Snitz Edwards as
the dean.
Flays Sunday with "The Freshman
and " A Chump at Oxford."
The Freshman (1925)
U.C.Theater. Berkeley
Harold Lloyd, whom Richard Schickel
has dubbed "comedian to the Age of
Prosperity." plays Harold "Speedy"
Lamb, the hayseed who becomes a foot
ball player in the big game. This is the
first and best of the college sports
comedies; it is utterly charming and
deeply satisfying as well, because there is
a strong emotional subtext, though Lloyd
and the director (Sam Taylor and Fred
Newmeyer) and the writers (Taylor. John
Grey, Ted Wilde and Tim Whelan) touch
very lightly on it — the anguish of the boy
who wants desperately to belong. Lloyd
always played the four-square hero
whose perseverance and ingenuity led
him unfailingly to his goal, and since his
off-screen life paralleled that of his char
acters — he made a killing in Hollywood
and lived in luxury until the age of 77 —
his belief in the Horatio Alger myth can
hardly be disputed. "The Freshman"
contains some of his funniest bits, like a
scene in which the girl he loves, played by
Jobyna Ralston (his frequent co-star)
sews a button on his shirt while he con
tentedly snips buttons off his cardigan.
(Scenes like this one are reminiscent of
Chaplin — but without the sentimen
tality.) For collectors of movie and sports
trivia: Taylor and Newmeyer shot the
climactic football seqauence between the
First and second quarters of the East-
West Game in the winter of 1924-25.
Plays Sunday with "College" and "A
Chump at Oxford."

less compartment on a broken-down
train somewhere in the German
countryside: The landscape is beautiful,
but you aren't going anywhere, and after
a while you can't breathe. The film is well
made, though; it marked one of Fass
binder's first departures from the rickety
formal experimentation that first won
him the attention of European critics.
Plays Thursday at 7:30.
Another Country (1984)
Cubberley Auditorium
Marek Kanievska's film version of the
Julian Mitchell play about how Guy
Burgess (here named Guy Bennett and
played by Rupert Everett) came to be a
famous Soviet agent. It's an intelligent
piece of dramatic writing, plausibly built
on a well-made-play structure, with rea
sonably rounded characters for the most
part; Mitchell has translated the work to
the screen gracefully, and Kanievska has
directed a skilled cast (particularly
Everett) in a clear, steady, unhysterical

fashion. But it's an awfully senate movie
— fairly absorbing but unmoving, and be
wilderingly coy in its depiction of the
sexual practices of the Eton boys among
whom it is set. Perhaps if it weren't all of
a piece — if the dialogue had some un
resolved tension instead ofjust polish and
an acceptable level of wit — Kanievska's
restraint would seem a greater virtue. As
it is, he appears to hold in check what is
already self-controlled, placing the movie
in a double bind.
Plays Tuesday evening at 8.
Phantom India (1972)
U.C.Theater. Berkeley: York. San Fran
cisco
Louis Malle begins his seven-part doc
umentary by explaining that though he
lived in India for months, training his
camera on everything he could discover,
he never felt he'd even started to unravel
the country's great mystery. We are the
beneficiaries of his quest, however, and
his refusal to interpret — to seize the
traditional omniscient point of view of
the documentarian — makes this one of
the most moral non-fiction films ever
made; it's comparable in this way to
James Agee's great literary document of
the Depression, "Let Us Now Praise Fa
mous Men." And it's altogether ex
traordinary.
Parts 1-3 play Wednesday at the York;
Parts 4 and 5 play Monday at the
U.C.Theater.
College (1927)
U.C.Theater, Berkeley
Buster Keaton's last independent
feature was this heavy-handed comedy,
credited to James W. Home. Owing a
transparent debt to Harold Lloyd's "The
Freshman," released two years earlier, it
cast Keaton as a scholar who essays

sports in an attempt to endear himself to
the most popular girl in his freshman class
(Ann Cornwall). Keaton's genius for
physical comedy is so celerated that one
watches his exhibitions of athletic incom
petence with difficulty: the inevitable
scene in which he displays his facility in
the course of rescuing his sweetheart
from the cluthes of a bully (Harold
Goodwin) comes wittily but too late to
redeem the picture. The cast includes
Florence Turner as Keaton's mother,
and. sorely underused. Snitz Edwards as
the dean.
Flays Sunday with "The Freshman
and " A Chump at Oxford."
The Freshman (1925)
U.C.Theater. Berkeley
Harold Lloyd, whom Richard Schickel
has dubbed "comedian to the Age of
Prosperity." plays Harold "Speedy"
Lamb, the hayseed who becomes a foot
ball player in the big game. This is the
first and best of the college sports
comedies; it is utterly charming and
deeply satisfying as well, because there is
a strong emotional subtext, though Lloyd
and the director (Sam Taylor and Fred
Newmeyer) and the writers (Taylor. John
Grey, Ted Wilde and Tim Whelan) touch
very lightly on it — the anguish of the boy
who wants desperately to belong. Lloyd
always played the four-square hero
whose perseverance and ingenuity led
him unfailingly to his goal, and since his
off-screen life paralleled that of his char
acters — he made a killing in Hollywood
and lived in luxury until the age of 77 —
his belief in the Horatio Alger myth can
hardly be disputed. "The Freshman"
contains some of his funniest bits, like a
scene in which the girl he loves, played by
Jobyna Ralston (his frequent co-star)
sews a button on his shirt while he con
tentedly snips buttons off his cardigan.
(Scenes like this one are reminiscent of
Chaplin — but without the sentimen
tality.) For collectors of movie and sports
trivia: Taylor and Newmeyer shot the
climactic football seqauence between the
First and second quarters of the East-
West Game in the winter of 1924-25.
Plays Sunday with "College" and "A
Chump at Oxford."

Sunrise (1927)
Pacific Film Archive. Berkeley
This glorious late silent is often used as
an example of the influence of the Ger
man Expressionists on American movies
in the 1920s and '30s. The director was
F.W. Murnau, and the story he trans
formed was a sentimental romance about
the country boy (George O'Brien) who
goes to the big city and forgets his faith ul
wife (Janet Gaynor). No director ever did
so much for Gaynor, who is hardly
cloying at all and in fact achieves some
moving effects. (She took the first
Academy Award for her work in this
movie as well as "Seventh Heaven" and
"Street Angel.") Murnau and "Sunrise'
were almost definitely the source of the
explosive German director Kammerling
and his pastoral movie in the Kaufman
and Hart spoof "Once in a Lifetime."
Plays Thursday with "Journey into the
Night."
On the Waterfront (1954)
Kresge Auditorium
Terry Malloy, has-been fighter turned
dock worker, represented the smashed
dreams of a generation when this film was
released in the mid-50s, and there is still
much in this portrait of a decent, inex
pressive guy trying to deal with the web
of corruption he is caught in to move
audiences. Crude as parts of Budd Schul
berg's script (out of his novel) are, and
despite Karl Maiden's characteristic mug
ging in the role of the priest, the movie
still packs a hell of a punch. As Terry,
Marlon Brando gives his most amazing
early performance; one can just imagine
how the audiences of the time responded
to those magnetic Neanderthal looks and
the impassioned earnestness of his acting.
Eva Marie Saint is excellent and Rod
Steiger is also memorable, but Brando
blows everyone else off the screen. Di

rected by Elia Kazan, whom every young
actor in America was dying to work with
(having discovered Brando — for "A
Streetcar Named Desire" — he went on
to find James Dean), shot by Boris Kauf
man, and with a classic Leonard
Bernstein score.
Plays tonight at 9.
Effi Briest (1977)
Haus Mitteleuropa
Rainer Werner Fassbinder's most
respectable movie (except perhaps for his
lengthy television adaptation of "Berlin
Alexanderplatz") was this rendering of
the Theodor Fontane novel, starring
Hanna Schygulla. Practically a definition
of the art house film, this carefully
detailed period piece moves so slowly
that you feel as if you're stuck in an air
less compartment on a broken-down
train somewhere in the German
countryside: The landscape is beautiful,
but you aren't going anywhere, and after
a while you can't breathe. The film is well
