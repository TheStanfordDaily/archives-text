## Equipment poses fatal risks 
### TODD RAMMING Senior staff writer 
Many campus laboratories received a letter this
week warning of newly discovered and potentially
fatal hazards in the operation of vacuum chamber
equipment. The equipment described is in
widespread use at Stanford.
In a recently released statement, Granville-
Phillips, a Colorado-based manufacturing firm,
cautioned of possible electric shock from the
Bayard-Alpert lon Gauge Controller that it
produces.
In response, Brian O'Neill, a health and safety
specialist here, sent out letters alerting Stanford
groups of possible dangers from using the ion
gauge.
According to Tim Feaver, technical services
director of Granville-Phillips, the gauge is used to
measure extremely low pressures found in experi
mental situations, where researchers often make
use of pressure less than one-millionth of standard
earth conditions.

Traditional methods of measuring atmospheric
pressure cannot detect such slight pressures.
Through an indirect process which involves ioniz
ing the surrounding particles, the Bayard-Alpert
gauge is able to detect the slightest of pressures.
Under certain conditions, plasma discharge may
occur around the gauge, causing a dangerous, and
possibly fatal, current to be transmitted to sur
rounding metal objects.
During use, gas particles get trapped along the
edges of the gauge. Cleaning of the apparatus is ne
cessary. "Voltages of up to 900 Volts are used
during de-gassing (the cleaning procedure),"
Feaver said.
"As gas evolves from the edges (of the gauge ap
paratus), high voltages and high pressures make
conditions good for plasma discharge," he said.
Even under normal operating conditions,
however, the gauge could generate a shock capable
of causing fibrillation of the heart, he said.
The hazards associated with the ion gauge are
"not strictly limited to Granville-Phillips," Feaver

said. The danger is "something inherent in the
design (of the gauge)."
Although no other designs are currently
available for measuring such slight pressures, the
Bayard-Alpert model operates safely with proper
grounding. Feaver said.
Grounding systems may be inadequate, however,
if wires have accidentally been cut or plastic com
ponents have been used to replace metal parts,
Feaver said. The initial researcher on the ion gauge
became aware of the inherent dangers in the design
when he was doing routine work on a particular
model, according to Feaver.
Lance Goddard, an engineer at Hansen Labora
tories here, estimates that 20 ion gauges are in use
at Hansen alone.
Although all electrical systems at Hansen are in
stalled in compliance with existing codes, the
hazards associated with the ion gauge are
"something that is entirely new," said Bob Strena,
an administrator and member of the safety commit
tee at Hansen.
