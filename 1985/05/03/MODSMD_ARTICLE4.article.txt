# Teaching skill given priority
## Fac Sen alters rules on requirements 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
Professors will have to prove they
are worthy of teaching courses that
fulfill distribution requirements
before their courses can fulfill those
requirements, the Faculty Senate
decided yesterday.
The senate, after prolonged
debate, decided to include teaching
effectiveness among the other criteria
that the Committee on Undergradu
ate Studies (C-US) now uses.
Biology Prof. Jonathan Roughgar
den, chairman of the C-US, proposed
the addition of a sixth criterion,
teaching effectiveness, to the five
already instituted by the committee:
units, level, scope, sequencing and
distribution area definition.
The new criterion on teaching ef
fectiveness will urge department
chairs and deans to "exercise their re
sponsibilities," ensuring that courses
nominated for distribution require
ment certification within their depart
ment "are well taught." It will also
relay to the Subcommittee on Distri
bution Requirements (S-DR) any rel

evant information concerning the
teaching effectiveness of those
courses nominated, according to a
memo submitted to the senate by the
Steering Committee. Also, C-US
should refrain from recommending
any course to the senate for approval
unless the committee provides sub
stantial evidence supporting the
course's superior execution.
Roughgarden said the new crite
rion was necessary because the "S
-DR had come to overstep its
bounds." It should be evaluating
courses and their execution instead of
teachers, he said.
Roughgarden stated in a letter circ
ulated to the senate that the C-US,
"and not the administration, has ul
timate responsibility for recommend
ing certification."
Philosophy Prof. John Perry
opposed the recommendation, stating
in a letter to the senate that evaluat
ing a teacher s performance is "quite
inappropriate."
"C-US has been turning down
courses because they were not well
taught, even though they satisfy the
other criteria." Perry stated. "The
current motion is designed to set at
rest any qualms that in so doing C-US
has the senate's blessing."
Perry questioned whether the C
US wants to deprive a student the op
portunity of fulfilling a distribution
requirement, and "turn down a
course that is fine in content but not
well taught."
Perry stated that "we have, among
our colleagues, many who are in
various ways and for various causes,
not effective or good teachers, by the
criteria current at Stanford. . . . If one
of our colleagues of the above men
tioned category wishes to teach a
course that can be the first course
taken in a DR (distribution) require

ment area, and a given student, tor
whatever reason, wishes to take this
course, do we have any business in
saying that, in so doing, that student
has not satisfied the relevant distribu
tion requirement?"
Roughgarden said a student can
file a petition for fulfillment of a dis
tribution requirement if that course is
not among those that satisfy the dis
tribution areas.
Perry discussed one particular
course in the Philosophy Department
that was not granted certification by
C-US because it was not deemed to
be taught effectively. Course evalua
tions were "below average," Perry
said, but some found the course both
"interesting and challenging."
"Do we really want to say don't
bother' if the teacher evaluations
don't come out high enough?" he
asked. Interesting teachers should be
able to teach an undergraduate
course to a few interested and en
lightened students, he said.
