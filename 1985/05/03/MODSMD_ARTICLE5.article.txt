# Divestment: Trustees have final word

"What's the C-IR?" asked one student the
first night of Stanford's anti-apartheid sit-in.
She had her sleeping bag slung over her
shoulder and was ready to camp outside of Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy's office with
other pro-divestment demonstrators.
As students talked into the wee hours of the
morning about the divestment issue, names like
Massy and Adams, and terms like C-IR and
SCIR, floated through the air. They've become
part of common parlance around "Nelson Man
dela Free University" quad, and yet many stu
dents, some demonstrators among them, are
still uncertain about which committee does what
and just who is responsible for which aspects of
Stanford's investment policy.
Playing the lead role in the University's in
vestment decisions is the Board of Trustees,
which has the ultimate power to support or
reverse recommendations by any of the other
bodies. The trustees' Special Committee on In
vestment Responsibility (SCIR) and the board's
regular Committee on Investments, as well as
the presidential Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility (C-IR). all exercise review and re
commendation powers.
In addition, Rodney Adams, treasurer, and
William Massy, vice president for business and
finance, have input through recommendations
of their offices to these committees.
C-IR. an academic commission composed of
the treasurer, three faculty members, three
alumni, three students and two staff members,
has been the most active on the issue of divest
ment. However, some divestment backers argue
that while the group engages in information gath

ering and research, it does not have enough
real power.
As a trustee committee, the SCIR's recom
mendations hold more sway with the board than
do C-IR recommendations, according to Walter
Geys, a student member of the trustees' Com
mittee on Investments. All C-IR recommen
dations must pass through the SCIR before
reaching the full board. Student protesters com
plain that they have been kept two steps
removed from where decisions are actually
being made.
"The C-IR is a cheap excuse for not having
students on the SCIR. They put students on the
C-IR so they don't have to deal with us on the
trustee committee," said Geys, voicing what he
calls "a general concern."
Such sentiments led Stanford Out of South
Africa (SOSA) members to include among their
seven demands student representation on the
SCIR and to ask Kennedy to put divestment on
the agenda of the Committee on Investments'
May 14 meeting, where Geys can gauge trustee
response.
C-IR student member Mark Landesmann
guesses that the demand for SCIR representa
tion "is by far the most likely to be imple
mented. .. . There's no reason why one of the
committees which has the most relevance to stu
dent issues and students' concerns should not
have student input," he said.
The SClR,created in 1977, following the last
wave of pro-divestment demonstrations, cur
rently consists of six trustees, five with voting
power and one ex-officio representative from
the Committee on Investments.
But the function of the trustees' committee is
not so different from that of the C-IR, said Otis

Pease, chair of the SCI R. "If students say the C
IR is only an advisory committee, I'd say, 'So
are we.' Our committee only makes recommen
dations to the full board. And the board has
overturned us in the past," Pease said.
Rob Schechter, a student C-IR member since
1983, concurred with Pease's response. He said
he cannot remember the SCI R ever reversing a
recommendation by the C-IR during his tenure
with the commission. Reversals have occurred
when issues have gone before the full board of
32 trustees, he said.
Schechter sees the function of a student rep
resentative on the SCIR as that of a monitor,
someone to keep a finger on the board's pulse.
He used the issue of total divestment as an ex
ample. "If the vote came down 5-0 (against
divestment), a student's vote would not matter
anyway. But a student member would be able to
prevent any sloppy consideration ... or too su
perficial a review of the issue," he said.
Pease said he is unsure how the trustees will
vote on the demand for representation. "Out of
a knowledge of how the trustees think and
work," he said their response would depend
upon the administration's reaction.
"A lot of times it's crucial to know what the
administration thinks about an issue. If the ad
ministration is lukewarm or cool, then there's
no chance. If the administration is enthusiastic,
then the chance is much greater," Pease said,
adding that the trustees would probably not ap
point a student without also naming a faculty
member to the committee.
Currently, four of the 12 trustee committees
have student or faculty members. These non
trustee committee members may not attend
meetings of the full board, where committee

recommendations are made and voted on.
While many members of the C-IR and the
Board of Trustees will admit that the C-IR
could be more effective, they usually cite as
constraints limited staff and resources and the
difficulty of procuring information. Pro
divestment demonstrators have said they
believe the difficulties stem from institutional
features of the commission.
Complaints that the C-IR is merely "a buffer
between students and the trustees" or an
"administration puppet" that has never re
examined the University's fundamental as
sumptions about divestment have emerged in
discussions by protesters.
C-IR member Landesmann echoes these
complaints. Among other criticisms, he believes
that the treasurer's ex-officio membership on
the C-IR diminishes the commission's effective
ness.
"The link with the treasurer's office is a link
with the administration, and it affects the dis
semination of information within the C-IR. . . .
Also, in terms of setting the (C-IR) agenda at
the beginning of the year, the treasurer gives a
very subtle and yet very strong message about
what the University expects from the commit
tee," Landesmann said.
C-IR Chair Richard Brody, professor of poli
tical science, said Landesmann's assertions are
"plain wrong. . . . That Rod (Adams), who has
a certain degree of expertise on the issue and is
familiar with the financial picture, sits on the
commission is no more peculiar than that Mark
(Landesmann), who is an activist, sits on the
commission," he said. He pointed out
that Adams has one vote, "just like
everyone else."
Landesmann also commented on
the "stronger and stronger grip" the
Board of Trustees exercises over the
C-IR. In order to give divestment "a
real academic and scientific look, the
C-IR needs to be removed from the
pressures emanating from |the Board
of Trustees], which itself has very
close ties to the business commu
nity," he said.
Of 32 trustees, 17 are high-level
corporate executives, and of these, six
work for companies with operations
in South Africa. These ties have
brought cries of conflict of interest
from SOSA, which has included
among its demands the disclosure of
personal investment portfolios of all

board members and Massy.
In a meeting with protesters
outside his office last week, Kennedy
called this demand an "invasion of
privacy," a view to which Massy also
adheres.
Trustee Pease, a history professor
at the University of Washington, a
public institution, said he thinks
"disclosure in the long run would be a
good thing," although he acknowl
edged that "trustees are very
scrupulous in abstaining from any
decisions that come close to their own
holdings." Such abstention is re
quired by law, he added.
He said that his job at a public uni
versity made him less inclined to have
the "hang-ups" about disclosure that
many board members working in the
private sector have. "There'd be a
hell of a fight, and some trustees might
resign rather than do that," he said.
Six attorneys, two businessmen and
seven people who work in education,
health care or the public sector sit

with the 17 executives on the hoard.
Another issue of some concern to
the trustees was the C-IR's unprece
dented recent decision to send letters
to the 19 non-signatories of the Sul
livan Principles — the six-item pledge
to improve workplace conditions —
in Stanford's portfolio.
While Brody explained that "these
are going out as information
(request) letters with no statement of
advocacy," Pease said some trustees
are not happy with "letters that imply
that they're 'bad boys' because they
haven't signed the Sullivan Prin
ciples."
C-IR member Schechter explained
that care was taken with the wording
of the letters to make it plain that
they were "representing the C-IR" as
well as to ensure that the commission
receives the information it needs to
evaluate the companies' activities in
South Africa.
Typically, the C-IR relies on the in
formation published by the Invest

ment Responsibility Research Cen
ter, a non-profit center in Washing
ton, D.C.. formed by Stanford and
about 10 other universities. The deci
sion to solicit information on its own
from the Sullivan non-signatories is a
"new step for the C-IR and for the
University in beginning to rigorously
evaluate the portfolio," Schechter
said.
Pease, however, expressed skep
ticism about how productive the new
approach will be. "You can write let
ters to corporations requesting infor
mation, and they'll write back politely
and just stonewall you," he said.
In an attempt to address some of
the constraints under which the C-IR
must work, the University decided in
April to hire a staff person for the
commission. About one-third of the
staffer's time will be devoted to the
C-IR. and the rest will be spent
working for the treasurer on invest
ment matters.

"The C-IR is a cheap excuse for not having
students on the SCIR. They put students on the
C-IR so they don't have to deal with us on the
trustee committee," said Geys, voicing what he
calls "a general concern."
Such sentiments led Stanford Out of South
Africa (SOSA) members to include among their
seven demands student representation on the
SCIR and to ask Kennedy to put divestment on
the agenda of the Committee on Investments'
May 14 meeting, where Geys can gauge trustee
response.
C-IR student member Mark Landesmann
guesses that the demand for SCIR representa
tion "is by far the most likely to be imple
mented. .. . There's no reason why one of the
committees which has the most relevance to stu
dent issues and students' concerns should not
have student input," he said.
The SClR,created in 1977, following the last
wave of pro-divestment demonstrations, cur
rently consists of six trustees, five with voting
power and one ex-officio representative from
the Committee on Investments.
But the function of the trustees' committee is
not so different from that of the C-IR, said Otis

Pease, chair of the SCI R. "If students say the C
IR is only an advisory committee, I'd say, 'So
are we.' Our committee only makes recommen
dations to the full board. And the board has
overturned us in the past," Pease said.
Rob Schechter, a student C-IR member since
1983, concurred with Pease's response. He said
he cannot remember the SCI R ever reversing a
recommendation by the C-IR during his tenure
with the commission. Reversals have occurred
when issues have gone before the full board of
32 trustees, he said.
Schechter sees the function of a student rep
resentative on the SCIR as that of a monitor,
someone to keep a finger on the board's pulse.
He used the issue of total divestment as an ex
ample. "If the vote came down 5-0 (against
divestment), a student's vote would not matter
anyway. But a student member would be able to
prevent any sloppy consideration ... or too su
perficial a review of the issue," he said.
Pease said he is unsure how the trustees will
vote on the demand for representation. "Out of
a knowledge of how the trustees think and
work," he said their response would depend
upon the administration's reaction.
"A lot of times it's crucial to know what the
administration thinks about an issue. If the ad
ministration is lukewarm or cool, then there's
no chance. If the administration is enthusiastic,
then the chance is much greater," Pease said,
adding that the trustees would probably not ap
point a student without also naming a faculty
member to the committee.
Currently, four of the 12 trustee committees
have student or faculty members. These non
trustee committee members may not attend
meetings of the full board, where committee

recommendations are made and voted on.
While many members of the C-IR and the
Board of Trustees will admit that the C-IR
could be more effective, they usually cite as
constraints limited staff and resources and the
difficulty of procuring information. Pro
divestment demonstrators have said they
believe the difficulties stem from institutional
features of the commission.
Complaints that the C-IR is merely "a buffer
between students and the trustees" or an
"administration puppet" that has never re
examined the University's fundamental as
sumptions about divestment have emerged in
discussions by protesters.
C-IR member Landesmann echoes these
complaints. Among other criticisms, he believes
that the treasurer's ex-officio membership on
the C-IR diminishes the commission's effective
ness.
"The link with the treasurer's office is a link
with the administration, and it affects the dis
semination of information within the C-IR. . . .
Also, in terms of setting the (C-IR) agenda at
the beginning of the year, the treasurer gives a
very subtle and yet very strong message about
what the University expects from the commit
tee," Landesmann said.
C-IR Chair Richard Brody, professor of poli
tical science, said Landesmann's assertions are
"plain wrong. . . . That Rod (Adams), who has
a certain degree of expertise on the issue and is
familiar with the financial picture, sits on the
commission is no more peculiar than that Mark
(Landesmann), who is an activist, sits on the
commission," he said. He pointed out
that Adams has one vote, "just like
everyone else."
Landesmann also commented on
the "stronger and stronger grip" the
Board of Trustees exercises over the
C-IR. In order to give divestment "a
real academic and scientific look, the
C-IR needs to be removed from the
pressures emanating from |the Board
of Trustees], which itself has very
close ties to the business commu
nity," he said.
Of 32 trustees, 17 are high-level
corporate executives, and of these, six
work for companies with operations
in South Africa. These ties have
brought cries of conflict of interest
from SOSA, which has included
among its demands the disclosure of
personal investment portfolios of all

board members and Massy.
In a meeting with protesters
outside his office last week, Kennedy
called this demand an "invasion of
privacy," a view to which Massy also
adheres.
Trustee Pease, a history professor
at the University of Washington, a
public institution, said he thinks
"disclosure in the long run would be a
good thing," although he acknowl
edged that "trustees are very
scrupulous in abstaining from any
decisions that come close to their own
holdings." Such abstention is re
quired by law, he added.
He said that his job at a public uni
versity made him less inclined to have
the "hang-ups" about disclosure that
many board members working in the
private sector have. "There'd be a
hell of a fight, and some trustees might
resign rather than do that," he said.
Six attorneys, two businessmen and
seven people who work in education,
health care or the public sector sit

with the 17 executives on the hoard.
Another issue of some concern to
the trustees was the C-IR's unprece
dented recent decision to send letters
to the 19 non-signatories of the Sul
livan Principles — the six-item pledge
to improve workplace conditions —
in Stanford's portfolio.
While Brody explained that "these
are going out as information
(request) letters with no statement of
advocacy," Pease said some trustees
are not happy with "letters that imply
that they're 'bad boys' because they
haven't signed the Sullivan Prin
ciples."
C-IR member Schechter explained
that care was taken with the wording
of the letters to make it plain that
they were "representing the C-IR" as
well as to ensure that the commission
receives the information it needs to
evaluate the companies' activities in
South Africa.
Typically, the C-IR relies on the in
formation published by the Invest

ment Responsibility Research Cen
ter, a non-profit center in Washing
ton, D.C.. formed by Stanford and
about 10 other universities. The deci
sion to solicit information on its own
from the Sullivan non-signatories is a
"new step for the C-IR and for the
University in beginning to rigorously
evaluate the portfolio," Schechter
said.
Pease, however, expressed skep
ticism about how productive the new
approach will be. "You can write let
ters to corporations requesting infor
mation, and they'll write back politely
and just stonewall you," he said.
In an attempt to address some of
the constraints under which the C-IR
must work, the University decided in
April to hire a staff person for the
commission. About one-third of the
staffer's time will be devoted to the
C-IR. and the rest will be spent
working for the treasurer on invest
ment matters.
Senior staff writer
"What's the C-IR?" asked one student the
first night of Stanford's anti-apartheid sit-in.
She had her sleeping bag slung over her
shoulder and was ready to camp outside of Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy's office with
other pro-divestment demonstrators.
As students talked into the wee hours of the
morning about the divestment issue, names like
Massy and Adams, and terms like C-IR and
SCIR, floated through the air. They've become
part of common parlance around "Nelson Man
dela Free University" quad, and yet many stu
dents, some demonstrators among them, are
still uncertain about which committee does what
and just who is responsible for which aspects of
Stanford's investment policy.
Playing the lead role in the University's in
vestment decisions is the Board of Trustees,
which has the ultimate power to support or
reverse recommendations by any of the other
bodies. The trustees' Special Committee on In
vestment Responsibility (SCIR) and the board's
regular Committee on Investments, as well as
the presidential Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility (C-IR). all exercise review and re
commendation powers.
In addition, Rodney Adams, treasurer, and
William Massy, vice president for business and
finance, have input through recommendations
of their offices to these committees.
C-IR. an academic commission composed of
the treasurer, three faculty members, three
alumni, three students and two staff members,
has been the most active on the issue of divest
ment. However, some divestment backers argue
that while the group engages in information gath

ering and research, it does not have enough
real power.
As a trustee committee, the SCIR's recom
mendations hold more sway with the board than
do C-IR recommendations, according to Walter
Geys, a student member of the trustees' Com
mittee on Investments. All C-IR recommen
dations must pass through the SCIR before
reaching the full board. Student protesters com
plain that they have been kept two steps
removed from where decisions are actually
being made.
"The C-IR is a cheap excuse for not having
students on the SCIR. They put students on the
C-IR so they don't have to deal with us on the

anyway. But a student member would be able to
prevent any sloppy consideration ... or too su
perficial a review of the issue," he said.
Pease said he is unsure how the trustees will
vote on the demand for representation. "Out of
a knowledge of how the trustees think and
work," he said their response would depend
upon the administration's reaction.
"A lot of times it's crucial to know what the
administration thinks about an issue. If the ad
ministration is lukewarm or cool, then there's
no chance. If the administration is enthusiastic,
then the chance is much greater," Pease said,
adding that the trustees would probably not ap
point a student without also naming a faculty
member to the committee.
Currently, four of the 12 trustee committees
have student or faculty members. These non
trustee committee members may not attend
meetings of the full board, where committee

recommendations are made and voted on.
While many members of the C-IR and the
Board of Trustees will admit that the C-IR
could be more effective, they usually cite as
constraints limited staff and resources and the
difficulty of procuring information. Pro
divestment demonstrators have said they
believe the difficulties stem from institutional
features of the commission.
Complaints that the C-IR is merely "a buffer
between students and the trustees" or an
"administration puppet" that has never re
examined the University's fundamental as
sumptions about divestment have emerged in
discussions by protesters.
C-IR member Landesmann echoes these
complaints. Among other criticisms, he believes
that the treasurer's ex-officio membership on
the C-IR diminishes the commission's effective
ness.
"The link with the treasurer's office is a link
with the administration, and it affects the dis
semination of information within the C-IR. . . .
Also, in terms of setting the (C-IR) agenda at
the beginning of the year, the treasurer gives a
very subtle and yet very strong message about
what the University expects from the commit
tee," Landesmann said.
C-IR Chair Richard Brody, professor of poli
tical science, said Landesmann's assertions are
"plain wrong. . . . That Rod (Adams), who has
a certain degree of expertise on the issue and is
familiar with the financial picture, sits on the
commission is no more peculiar than that Mark
(Landesmann), who is an activist, sits on the
commission," he said. He pointed out
that Adams has one vote, "just like
everyone else."
Landesmann also commented on
the "stronger and stronger grip" the
Board of Trustees exercises over the
C-IR. In order to give divestment "a
real academic and scientific look, the
C-IR needs to be removed from the
pressures emanating from |the Board
of Trustees], which itself has very
close ties to the business commu
nity," he said.
Of 32 trustees, 17 are high-level
corporate executives, and of these, six
work for companies with operations
in South Africa. These ties have
brought cries of conflict of interest
from SOSA, which has included
among its demands the disclosure of
personal investment portfolios of all

board members and Massy.
In a meeting with protesters
outside his office last week, Kennedy
called this demand an "invasion of
privacy," a view to which Massy also
adheres.
Trustee Pease, a history professor
at the University of Washington, a
public institution, said he thinks
"disclosure in the long run would be a
good thing," although he acknowl
edged that "trustees are very
scrupulous in abstaining from any
decisions that come close to their own
holdings." Such abstention is re
quired by law, he added.
He said that his job at a public uni
versity made him less inclined to have
the "hang-ups" about disclosure that
many board members working in the
private sector have. "There'd be a
hell of a fight, and some trustees might
resign rather than do that," he said.
Six attorneys, two businessmen and
seven people who work in education,
health care or the public sector sit

with the 17 executives on the hoard.
Another issue of some concern to
the trustees was the C-IR's unprece
dented recent decision to send letters
to the 19 non-signatories of the Sul
livan Principles — the six-item pledge
to improve workplace conditions —
in Stanford's portfolio.
While Brody explained that "these
are going out as information
(request) letters with no statement of
advocacy," Pease said some trustees
are not happy with "letters that imply
that they're 'bad boys' because they
haven't signed the Sullivan Prin
ciples."
C-IR member Schechter explained
that care was taken with the wording
of the letters to make it plain that
they were "representing the C-IR" as
well as to ensure that the commission
receives the information it needs to
evaluate the companies' activities in
South Africa.
Typically, the C-IR relies on the in
formation published by the Invest

ment Responsibility Research Cen
ter, a non-profit center in Washing
ton, D.C.. formed by Stanford and
about 10 other universities. The deci
sion to solicit information on its own
from the Sullivan non-signatories is a
"new step for the C-IR and for the
University in beginning to rigorously
evaluate the portfolio," Schechter
said.
Pease, however, expressed skep
ticism about how productive the new
approach will be. "You can write let
ters to corporations requesting infor
mation, and they'll write back politely
and just stonewall you," he said.
In an attempt to address some of
the constraints under which the C-IR
must work, the University decided in
April to hire a staff person for the
commission. About one-third of the
staffer's time will be devoted to the
C-IR. and the rest will be spent
working for the treasurer on invest
ment matters.
