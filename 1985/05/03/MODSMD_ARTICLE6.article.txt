# Arms expert rips Star Wars
## 
### ALLISON HARTWELL Staff writer 
Calling President Reagan's proposed
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI)
"adventuresome and radical," the chairman
of the Arms Control Association told an au
dience of 75 in Kresge Auditorium last night
that the SDI is stalling nuclear non
proliferation efforts.
Ambassador Gerard Smith, chief
negotiator of the SALT I Treaty, said the
SDI. commonly known as "Star Wars."'
"rocks" the United States' allies and lessens
their cooperation in non-proliferation ef
forts.
According to Smith, a comprehensive test
ban treaty would be the "most effective
measure" to end the "pestilence of nuclear
spread." Reagan considers such a treaty not
in the U.S interest, although achieving a
comprehensive test ban treaty has been a
goal of all administrations since President
Eisenhower's. Smith said.
A treaty of this type would have a
"healthy effect on Soviet-American rela
tions." he said.
A comprehensive test ban would be non
discriminatory. severely limiting nuclear
tests for all signatories, whereas the current
regime under the non-proliferation treaty
(NPT) is not. he said.

In the NPT. which went into effect in
1970, the nuclear powers pledged not to
spread nuclear weapons to non-nuclear
powers, who in turn pledged not to try to ac
quire them. Non-nuclear powers also agreed
to inspections by the International Atomic
Energy Agency (lAEA), a condition not re
quired of the nuclear powers.
The lAEA is the "sole global mecha
nism' of nuclear control and "is essential to
our security." Smith said. The Reagan ad
ministration has made sharp cuts in the
lAEA's budget.
"The greater risks of triggering a nuclear
war lie in other countries than the U.S. and
the Soviet Union." he said.
Article 6 of the treaty included a promise
of nuclear powers to work toward reducing
weapons through arms control, a provision
the United States "has dismally failed in car
rying out." Smith said.
In an earlier interview with The Daily.
Smith said the possibility of success at the
current Geneva arms talks is small.
"Nothing will come of them unless we
change our position and offer some conces
sions on SDL" he said.
But Smith said that "the administration is
not interested in negotiations on any weap
ons in space."
"President Reagan clearly doesn't know

anything about nuclear weapons," he said.
He labeled Star Wars the critical "wild
card" that must be defined before progress
can be made.
"The Russians came back (to the bargain
ing table) not with the purpose to negotiate
but to block." he said.
The consequences of pursuing a program
emphasizing "defense instead of deter
rence" such as Star Wars would mean taking
;> serious look at civil defense, the "nasty
companion to SDI," he said.
Smith called for "very robust research of
SDI" to provide insurance against a Soviet
"breakout" of current treaty guidelines.
During the SALT I negotiations, he con
sidered himself a "guided missile" who pre
sented the "government's position as per
suasively as possible." Smith is now working
on a "national campaign to save the anti
ballistic treaty" against the threat of SDI.
When asked about the future of arms
negotiations. Smith said students of today
have "a much greater opportunity than ever
before" to achieve some sort of arms control
because of current education programs.
Smith praised the Stanford Center for In
ternational Security and Arms Control as
"the best of the academic centers in the
country."
