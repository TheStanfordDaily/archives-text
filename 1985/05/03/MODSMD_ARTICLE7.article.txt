Polish dissidents jailed after march
WARSAW, Poland — Solidarity leader Lech Walesa told the govern
ment yesterday to expect violence if it continues to "govern only with
clubs." He spoke a day after May Day street battles between demonstra
tors and riot police.
Shortly before Walesa made his statement, two of his leading
comrades, Jacek Kuron and Seweryn Jaworski, were ordered to prison
for three months for taking part in an illegal but peaceful May Day
march. Kuron is Poland's leading dissident intellectual, and Jaworski is a
Warsaw leader of the outlawed union.
They were among scores of Solidarity supporters detained by police
during anti-government protests Wednesday in at least five Polish cities,
according to dissident sources.
The worst clashes occurred in Gdansk, the Baltic port where Walesa
lives. Thousands of rock-throwing demonstrators clashed with police
near the former Solidarity headquarters, and injuries were reported
among both police and demonstrators.
The Solidarity founder, who won the 1983 Nobel Peace prize, said in a
statement that Polish workers "proved their faithfulness to Solidarity"
and determination "to defend their due rights" by demonstrating on
May Day despite the massive police deployment.
He said "violence breeds violence," and the fierceness of the Gdansk
street clashes was a warning to the communist authorities that "the sit
uation in our country may become dangerous" unless workers' rights are
respected.
Witness says soldier killed Aquino
MANILA, Philippines — A woman who was on the same jetliner that
brought Benigno Aquino home from exile testified yesterday that she
saw a soldier kill the opposition leader and that a colonel warned her not
to talk.
Rebecca Quijano, the first civilian to claim to have seen the killing,
said in court:"The Metrocom (Manila military command) man was
holding a gun behind Senator Aquino, pointing it to his head. Simultane
ously there was a shot."
The armed forces chief of staff, Gen. Fabian Ver, 25 other soldiers
and a civilian are charged with the murder of Aquino, who was shot as
he stepped off the plane Aug. 21, 1983, after three years of voluntary
exile in the United States.
They also are charged with killing Rolando Galman, who was shot im
mediately after Aquino and branded by the military as a communist
agent who assassinated the popular opposition leader, President Fer
dinand Marcos' chief political foe.
News media dubbed Quijano, 32, "the crying lady" after news film
showed her weeping uncontrollably as she came off the China Airlines
J et
The 400 people packing the tiny courtroom applauded after Quijano's
90-minute testimony.
A power blackout darkened the room as she testified. She grabbed the
prosecutor's arm and whimpered, "Please don't leave me here."
Quijano was not asked to identify the soldier who pulled the trigger,
but the prosecution says he could be Metrocom Constable Rogelio
Moreno, who followed Aquino down the airplane stairway and had pow
der burns on his hands after the killing.
Quijano said that she saw the killing from the plane window.'T was
shocked. I cried out. I got rattled," she said.
As she spoke with a group of journalists outside the plane a few
minutes later, Col. Vicente Tigas of the presidential security command
grabbed her shoulder and pulled her away, she said.
"He whispered to me, 'Keep quiet or you may be harmed,' " she said.
Quijano said Tigas frightened her. "He hurt me on my shoulder. He
held me very tightly," she said.
She said the colonel turned to a companion and said, "Friend, it's
finished."
Quijano said she screamet|when she one of the defen
dants, on television with other military men announcing their version of
the killing.
Defense attorneys surprised the court by waiving cross-examination.
Ramon Academia, attorney for Tigas, said the evidence showed no
blood was found on the stairway where Quijano claimed Aquino was
shot, and "she is falsifying the truth."
Nazi resisters' kin to join relative
BONN, West Germany — President Reagan and Chancellor Helmut
Kohl tried yesterday to blunt criticism of their plans to lay a wreath at a
German military cemetery by inviting relatives of Nazi resisters to join
the ceremony.
The three-week-old uproar over Reagan's planned journey to the Bit
burg gravesites on Sunday raged on as the leaders of seven nations dined
at Schloss Falkenlust, a castle built in 1733, on the eve of a two-day eco
nomic summit meeting.
The leaders remained divided on sensitive issues, such as the starting
date for new international trade talks; what, if any, action to take to curb
fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar; and European participation
in Reagan's "Star Wars" missile defense research program.
The decision to bring relatives of Nazi resisters to Bitburg was an
nounced by Peter Boenisch, spokesman for the Bonn government, after
a 50-minute meeting between Reagan and Kohl, the West German
chancellor.
West German leaders hailed Reagan's courage in resisting pressure
from the United States to cancel the visit.
A West German official, speaking on condition of not being identi
fied, said the idea was "to make Bitburg more popular." The decision
"was an attempt to get rid of the disharmony" over the trip.
The official said the idea of adding the relatives was conceived by the
West Germans and agreed to by U.S. officials earlier this week. But the
official would not identify others in the delegation, because not all the
invitations had been sent yet.
Earlier, the U.S. side had tried other steps to defuse the controversy.
Reagan switched course and agreed to visit the Bergen-Belsen concen
tration camp site, also on Sunday. Some 50,000 people died at the hands
of the SS there.
And late last week, U.S. officials tried unsuccessfully to persuade Nazi
hunter Simon Wiesenthal and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel to join
Reagan and Koh! at Bitburg.
A flap also emerged over what Reagan told Kohl about criticism of
the Bitburg visit in the United States, where majorities in both houses of
Congress have joined Jewish, veterans and other groups in seeking can
cellation of the ceremony.
Boenisch said Reagan "stressed that the United States had not consid
ered the Germans to have collective guilt (for the Holocaust) since the
Nuremberg war crimes trials. He (Reagan) regretted that this theme has
again surfaced" in public debate.
Poland detains two U.S. diplomats
WARSAW, Poland — Police briefly detained two American
diplomats, and the government said yesterday they had joined an illegal
May Day march. The U.S. Embassy said they had merely been observing
and that officers manhandled them.
The official news agency PAP said the Americans were among 15
people detained in an "aggressively behaving, leading group of the ille
gal parade" Wednesday in the southern city of Krakow.
PAP said charge d'affaires John Davis in Warsaw was summoned to
the Foreign Ministry on Thursday to receive a formal note of protest
over the incident, the second involving American diplomats in Poland
within three months.
The Americans were identified as William Harwood, first secretary of
the U.S. Embassy in Warsaw, and David Hopper, consul at the Krakow
consulate.
An embassy statement called the charges "completely erroneous" and
said the United States protested the "physical mistreatment and deten
tion of these two accredited diplomats."
It said that when the two Americans showed their diplomatic identity
cards to police and one of them was "pushed, struck, kicked and forced"
into an unmarked vehicle in which both were taken to a police station.
PAP's report said: "The Foreign Ministry in its note stated that the ac
tivities of these two employees of the American mission in Poland are in
clear violation of their diplomatic status and basic international norms
and customs."
