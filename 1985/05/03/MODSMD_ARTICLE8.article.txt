# Senate slashes defense buildup
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — A rebellious
Senate voted yesterday to pare the
administration's defense buildup by
$17.7 billion over three years and
provide full cost of living benefits to
federal retirees as it methodically
shredded a multi-billion-dollar deficit
reduction package endorsed by Presi
dent Reagan.
"For once, grassroots America has
won out over the military industrial
complex," said Sen. Charles Grassley
(R-Iowa), as he and Sen. Mark Hat
field of Oregon won approval for
their plan to hold the 1986 rise in
Pentagon spending constant with in
flation.
The Pentagon buildup has "created
a new set of welfare queens —
defense contractors," said Sen.
Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio).
Even with the change, defense spend
ing would rise by about $20 billion
next year.

The 80-18 vote restoring full re
tirement benefits for civil service and
military workers as well as veterans
was expected, coming one day after
the Senate voted to scrap a proposed
curtailment of Social Security
benefits.
It left the original Republican
budget in tatters, with further efforts
likely to restore proposed cuts in
Medicare and Medicaid and
numerous other federal programs.
Even so. Senate Majority Leader
Robert Dole vowed to "revisit"
several of the programs already voted
on, and said that rather than spelling
the end of efforts to reduce federal
deficits, "I think it's just the begin
ning."
But at the same time, he served
notice on the president, attending an
economic summit meeting in West
Germany, that "we made our best ef
fort and now we have to try some

thing different" than the original ap
proach that provided a 3 percent
after-inflation increase for defense,
and cut deeply into many domestic
programs.
In voting for what Hatfield termed
a "historic" change in defense, the
Senate spurned a trans-Atlantic lob
bying campaign by the traveling pres
ident. And Dole apparently consid
ered seeking to reverse the vote, only
to drop the idea because he noted it
was "five minutes after midnight in
Bonn, too late for calls to come
over."
Grassley and other advocates of
the provision said it would have no
impact on national security, but was
aimed at rooting out waste and inef
ficiency at the Pentagon.
But Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-
Ariz.) charged it has "become sort of
a fetish with my colleagues in
Congress that the only place we can

reduce deficits is in the defense"
budget.
"Too many Americans in a posi
tion of leadership want to return to a
policy of weakness . . . isolationism,"
said Goldwater, chairman of the Sen
ate Armed Services Committee.
The defense amendment was ulti
mately accepted without a recorded
vote. But that was a mere formality,
following a tense 51-48 roll call on
which senators refused to table, and
thus kill, the proposal.
The Republican budget plan
originally was crafted to reduce
federal deficits by $295 billion over
three years, largely by making deep
cuts in numerous domestic programs
and eliminating others entirely. But
the Senate voted 65-34 on Wednes
day to strip out one key provision, a
curtailment of Social Security cost of
living benefits that would have saved
$22.7 billion over three years.
