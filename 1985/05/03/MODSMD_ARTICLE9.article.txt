# Soviets assail embargo
## 
### 
Nicaragua said the U.S. trade em
bargo is an act of war and that it will
protest to the World Court, and the
Soviet Union said yesterday that
President Reagan has a "pathological
hatred" for the Sandinista govern
ment.
British, Canadian and Australian
officials said they did not support the
embargo, while Venezuela — part of
a four-nation group seeking a
regional peace treaty for Central
America — said the peace efforts
could be harmed both by the em
bargo and the current tour of Com
munist nations by Nicaraguan Presi
dent Daniel Ortega.
"We lament that on both sides, ac
tions or decisions are being taken
which affect the (peace) process,"
Foreign Minister Simon Alberto
Consalvi told reporters.
Nicaragua has appealed to the So
viet Union for economic aid, and
Vice President Sergio Ramirez said
he will seek help from all quarters in
an effort to ease the embargo's effect.
In the Nicaraguan capital,
Managua, officials and businessmen
said the economic blockade might
ruin the national airline, damage
agriculture and cripple transportation
and communication.
Ortega said Reagan's action would
"most likely be accompanied by mili
tary action." He did not elaborate,
but Nicaragua often has predicted a
U.S. invasion, which American offi
cials say is not being considered.
He spoke in Belgrade, Yugoslavia,
during his tour of the Soviet Union
and eight other Communist nations in
search of economic aid.
