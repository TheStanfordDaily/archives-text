PREMIER
PRE-MEDICAL
EVENT
A panel of physicians who practice medicine in a variety of ways
will reflect about the changing nature of the practice of medicine.
These changes will influence your own career which — Surprise
— will be near the year 2000. For example:
• How will the increased bureaucracy of medical practice weigh
against the satisfactions of one-to-one interactions?
• Will the practice of medicine be limited to organizations (e.g.
H.M.O.'s) or will there still be opportunities for individuals?
• Will the new technologies and the fruits of the new biology alter
the traditional role of the physician?
