# Senate returns for more budget votes
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Senate
leaders are predicting they can still
hammer out a $50-billion deficit
reduction plan in coming days
despite a series of early votes res
toring billions of dollars to popular
programs.
The GOP-run chamber was ex
pected to continue dismantling the
Reagan administration-backed
plan this week, with votes ex
pected to restore rural housing
programs, small business loans
and subsidies for Amtrak rail ser
vice.
But at some point, once all the
politically easy votes have been
cast, Republican leaders say the
Senate will have to go back over
what it's done and start making
some unpopular domestic spend
ing cuts in earnest.
"Sooner or later, we've got to
put a deficit reduction package to
gether. If it isn't ours, it's got to be
somebody's," said Sen. Pete
Domenici (R-N.M.), chairman of
the Senate Budget Committee.
The Senate leadership expects
to call votes on overall plans once
separate votes on specific pro
grams have run their course.
In addition to the plan Majority
Leader Robert Dole is attempting
to assemble, there are three rival
Democratic alternatives, all of

which seek to reduce the $200 bil
lon deficit roughly in half by 1988
— the same goal advanced by the
administration.
Thus, some items already
rejected, like limits on cost-of
living increases for Social Security
benefits are almost surely to re
appear in a different form.
Republican leaders were unable
to hold together key elements of
the budget compromise they
painstakingly negotiated with the
president because of united Dem
ocratic opposition and Republican
defections, largely from members
up for re-election next year.
For the first time in decades, the
Senate rejected a president's
defense spending request on the
floor. Senators turned down Presi
dent Reagan's proposal for a 3
percent increase above inflation in
military spending and voted in
stead to limit the hike to inflation.
And now that the Senate has
pared back the military budget, it
will be forced into taking another
look at domestic programs — or
consider a tax increase, a course
that Republican leaders are not
ready to consider just yet.
"I believe we've gone about as
far as we can go in defense spend
ing restraint," said Dole.
