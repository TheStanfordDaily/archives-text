Shuttle finishes mission
SPACE CENTER, Houston — Challenger's
astronauts made final runs on their science ex
periments yesterday and prepared to fire the
space shuttle out of orbit for a long fall toward a
high-speed landing in California.
Challenger was scheduled to land on a dry
lakebed runway at Edwards Air Force Base in
California's Mojave Desert at 9:06 this morning.
It was to have crossed the California coast near
Long Beach three minutes before landing, travel
ing three times faster than sound.
Science mission director Joe Cremin said
prime objectives had been achieved on most of
the 15 experiments aboard Spacelab 3. He said
the seven-man crew — which includes two doc
tors and three scientists — gathered enough sci
ence data to fill 50,000 volumes and collected
more than 3 million frames of video data.
In addition to growing crystals, the astronauts
also took pictures of auroras around both poles,
conducted a series of medical experiments,
studied the effects of weightlessness on levitated
droplets of fluid, collected cosmic ray particles.

and analyzed fluid motion in a device that sim
ulated the surfaces of the sun and of Jupiter.
Fast AIDS cure sought
EL. PASO, Texas — AIDS victims are crossing
the border or turning to the black market to buy
an unproven, experimental drug made in Mexico,
health officials say.
"Gay men are rushing across the border in
droves to get it," said Dr. Donald Abrams, assis
tant director of the AIDS clinic at San Francisco
General Hospital.
"It's very upsetting to see all my patients run
ning to Mexico and being taken advantage of
before it's been proved that this drug has any ef
fect," Abrams said.
The drug, Isoprinocine, is legally available in
more than 70 countries but has not yet been ap
proved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administra
tion.
Pharmacies in Juarez, Mexico, sell a 2()-tablet
box of Isoprinocine without a prescription for
about $2.50.

The drug reportedly sells on El Paso streets for
$2 per capsule and for $25 a capsule in San Fran
cisco, which has a large homosexual population.
Chuck Frutchey, information officer for the
San Francisco AIDS Foundation, said many
AIDS victims are desperate and can't afford to
wait for the FDA to approve Isoprinocine for use
in the United States.
Crime statistics told
WASHINGTON — Americans generally have
one chance in 133 of being murdered "in an
entire lifetime," and black men have a one-in-21
lifetime chance of being slain, the government
said yesterday in its first violent crime risk study.
The study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics
also concluded that some 6 million Americans, or
roughly 3 percent of the population over age 12,
will likely fall victim each year to robberies, rapes
or other assaults.
The report said that generally, blacks are more
likely than whites to be crime victims.
