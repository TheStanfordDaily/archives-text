Lawyer threatens judges
SAN FRANCISCO— Security is tight around

threatened by an attorney unhappy with adverse
rulings, it was reported yesterday.
Extra precautions, said the San Francisco Ex
aminer. were taken after the judges were warned

by the attorney's psychiatrist. Police were
reportedly looking for the lawyer.
One of the judges took it so seriously he's
started taking pistol practice on a police range,
the paper said.
The security was reported to involve San Fran
cisco sheriff s deputies.
Two unidentified judges were reported to have
said the threats were made over several weeks,
and one other judge said a threat against him had
to do with the attorney's personal eviction case.
The lawyer was not identified.
The story said the lawyer had been renting an
apartment but was evicted for violating the lease,
practicing law from the apartment. A jury was re
ported to have ruled against the lawyer, accord
ing to the judge. The jurist was told he was a tar
get of the attorney's threats.
Penalty to be debated
SACRAMENTO — Conservative lawmakers
of both parties will attempt this week to
"restore"' California's death penalty, which has
been law since 1977 but has yet to be used.

A series of hills to shorten the lengthy judicial
appeals process that has kept 177 people sitting
on San Ouentin s death row will be heard today
in the Assembly Public Safety Committee.
The state Supreme Court in 1972 threw out
the state's death penalty law, saying it caused
cruel and inhuman punishment. The Legislature
in 1977 passed a law by then-Sen. George Deuk
mejian reinstating the death penalty for a narrow
class of murders committed during felonies.
A 1978 initiative repealed that law and
replaced it with an expanded list of murders,
most linked with another felony, that can result
in the death penalty. The state Supreme Court
has upheld most of the initiative.
