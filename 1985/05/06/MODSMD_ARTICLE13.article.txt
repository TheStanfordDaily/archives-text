## Gay community aims for awareness, identity 
### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff 
When analysts make estimates of the number of
homosexuals in a given population, they usually start by
using Alfred Kinsey's 1948 figure of 10 percent. With that
estimate, there are at least 1,200 gays and lesbians among
the student population of Stanford.
Leaders ot the gay community consider it a measure of
their success that a much higher percentage of those stu
dents are willing to "come out of the closet" and affirm
their identities as homosexuals now than in Kinsey's day.
At Stanford, gay leaders attribute their success in bringing
people out to changes in the fabric of society as a
whole, but also to the active lead that Stanford's gay stu
dent institutions have taken in protecting and advocating
gay students' rights.
Since 1970, what is now known as the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance at Stanlord has been the leading active institu
tion in that regard. This year's Gay And Lesbian Aware
ness (GALA) Week is a celebration of the 15th
anniversary of the organized status of gay men and les
bians at Stanford, and GLAS has scheduled an intensified
program ot campus-wide events designed, as GLAS ar
chivist Gerard Koskovich put it, to "bring the issues of im
portance to our community before the general public and
to demonstrate the way in which we are a part of the
entire Stanford community."
If GLAS seems obsessed with emphasizing how it is
part ot the general community, it is equally preoccupied
with highlighting the independence of its identity. Gay
leaders here differ as to what extent this paradoxical be
havior is a function of the problems gays face, specifically
regarding their being at Stanford.
Koskovich said the less oppressive situation for gays at
Stanford — relative to other communities — does not
necessarily add up to wholesale acceptance of gay people
here. "We do not tend to face a tremendous amount of
blatant, open, anti-gay sentiment or activity," he said.
"Most people at Stanford have been inculcated with the
liberal bourgeois ideology that it wouldn't be nice to let
anyone know about their homophobic sentiments."
The sum of all people at Stanford repressing their
homophobic stance is what Koskovich termed the "liberal
tolerance effect." He said this tolerant attitude keeps the

vast majority of students — and administrators — in the
dark about the realities of gay life.
Koskovich said that when he and a group of gay stu
dents recently met with Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington to discuss violence against and harassment of
gays, Herrington "assured us, in no uncertain terms, that
there was no violence against or harassment of gay people
at Stanford, since, 'after all, this is not San Francisco.'
Needless to say, those of us who were sitting at the table
who have experienced violence and harassment at Stan
ford found it astonishing that the chief of police would
assure us that it had never occurred," Koskovich said.
"It demonstrates that kind of liberal bourgeois thinking
that says, 4 We don't have to engage ourselves in the reality
of the oppression of gay people. We just have to convince
ourselves that they aren't oppressed and then the problem
will be solved.' Well, the problem isn't solved," he said.
Koskovich said he has been harassed, taunted and
chased here "on the average" of about twice a month "for
as long as I can remember." The most recent incident oc
curred about a month ago, soon after Koskovich had ap
peared as a representative of the gay community at a se
ries of fraternity forums.
"It was a Saturday afternoon, when it was pretty quiet. I
was at the post office. There were three other people
there, all young, upper-middle-class-looking white males.
They were the only other people anywhere in sight. They
obviously recognized who I was on the basis of my ap
pearance at one of these entities (forums). They
proceeded to shout that I was a 'disgusting faggot' and to
chase me," Koskovich said.
Roland van Gaalen, a member of the GLAS Steering
Committee, agreed with Koskovich's assessment of the
"liberal tolerance effect." But he did not completely agree
with Koskovich's relatively negative evaluation of life at
Stanford for gays.
"People are willing to put up with us, but that doesn't
mean that they don't find homosexuality disgusting," van
Gaalen said. "Tolerance isn't exactly what we need. I
mean, who wants to be tolerated?"
But van Gaalen added, "For gay people, this is really a
wonderful place."
Being socially unacceptable gives gays a stronger sense
of personal identity than non-gay people might have and
that sense of identity can only work for the general good

of the gay population, according to van Gaalen.
"When I was younger, I used to think my gayness was a
disadvantage," van Gaalen said. "I often wondered, 'Why
has this happened to me?' I no longer have that feeling. I
enjoy politics and I like controversy."
Koskovich associated this sense of positive self
identification that comes with accepting one's gayness as
the source of multiple positive effects. For one thing, it
helps the gay individual end the ritual of "internalized
oppression" he has been raised to inflict on himself, Kos
kovich said.
"We're all raised in a society that tells us that gay
people don't exist, gay people are disgusting and inferior.
Because we're all raised in that society — virtually all of
us have straight parents and families — we have inter
nalized these values as well," Koskovich said.
Thus, the first and foremost goal of GLAS has been to
convince gays that their identities matter, that they are not
non-entities, according to Koskovich.
If a gay hides his identity from himself and from society,
"you are still gay either way, but when you're pretending
(not to be), you're miserable, and you're oppressing and
blaming yourself. When you're open, you're happy be

cause you've accepted who you are, and if you encounter
problems with it, it is the fault of bigoted people outside
yourself. You can say, 'That's their problem, let them deal
with it,' or 'I will help them deal with it,' rather than
saying, 'I am blaming myself,' " Koskovich said.
In keeping with this goal, an important function of the
alliance is bringing gays together once a week at the Old
Firehouse for what it terms "informal socials." Anywhere
from 50 to 70 men throng to the second floor lounge of
the Firehouse every Wednesday evening to talk to friends
with whom many of them could not talk during the normal
course of the week for fear of blasting their pretended
straight identities. They stand around, they drink, they
talk, and as the night wears on, couples leave, arm in arm.
Stanford students are not the only men to come to these
socials, however. Students from other universities, high
school students, working men from Silicon Valley and the
occassional older man will drift in, looking for com
panionship. But for some of these men, the atmosphere of
these social gatherings is less than welcoming.
