## Gay community aims for awareness, identity 
### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff 
When analysts make estimates of the number of
homosexuals in a given population, they usually start by
using Alfred Kinsey's 1948 figure of 10 percent. With that
estimate, there are at least 1,200 gays and lesbians among
the student population of Stanford.
Leaders ot the gay community consider it a measure of
their success that a much higher percentage of those stu
dents are willing to "come out of the closet" and affirm
their identities as homosexuals now than in Kinsey's day.
At Stanford, gay leaders attribute their success in bringing
people out to changes in the fabric of society as a
whole, but also to the active lead that Stanford's gay stu
dent institutions have taken in protecting and advocating
gay students' rights.
Since 1970, what is now known as the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance at Stanlord has been the leading active institu
tion in that regard. This year's Gay And Lesbian Aware
ness (GALA) Week is a celebration of the 15th
anniversary of the organized status of gay men and les
bians at Stanford, and GLAS has scheduled an intensified
program ot campus-wide events designed, as GLAS ar
chivist Gerard Koskovich put it, to "bring the issues of im
portance to our community before the general public and
to demonstrate the way in which we are a part of the
entire Stanford community."
If GLAS seems obsessed with emphasizing how it is
part ot the general community, it is equally preoccupied
with highlighting the independence of its identity. Gay
leaders here differ as to what extent this paradoxical be
havior is a function of the problems gays face, specifically
regarding their being at Stanford.
Koskovich said the less oppressive situation for gays at
Stanford — relative to other communities — does not
necessarily add up to wholesale acceptance of gay people
here. "We do not tend to face a tremendous amount of
blatant, open, anti-gay sentiment or activity," he said.
"Most people at Stanford have been inculcated with the
liberal bourgeois ideology that it wouldn't be nice to let
anyone know about their homophobic sentiments."
The sum of all people at Stanford repressing their
homophobic stance is what Koskovich termed the "liberal
tolerance effect." He said this tolerant attitude keeps the

vast majority of students — and administrators — in the
dark about the realities of gay life.
Koskovich said that when he and a group of gay stu
dents recently met with Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington to discuss violence against and harassment of
gays, Herrington "assured us, in no uncertain terms, that
there was no violence against or harassment of gay people
at Stanford, since, 'after all, this is not San Francisco.'
Needless to say, those of us who were sitting at the table
who have experienced violence and harassment at Stan
ford found it astonishing that the chief of police would
assure us that it had never occurred," Koskovich said.
"It demonstrates that kind of liberal bourgeois thinking
that says, 4 We don't have to engage ourselves in the reality
of the oppression of gay people. We just have to convince
ourselves that they aren't oppressed and then the problem
will be solved.' Well, the problem isn't solved," he said.
Koskovich said he has been harassed, taunted and
chased here "on the average" of about twice a month "for
as long as I can remember." The most recent incident oc
curred about a month ago, soon after Koskovich had ap
peared as a representative of the gay community at a se
ries of fraternity forums.
"It was a Saturday afternoon, when it was pretty quiet. I
was at the post office. There were three other people
there, all young, upper-middle-class-looking white males.
They were the only other people anywhere in sight. They
obviously recognized who I was on the basis of my ap
pearance at one of these entities (forums). They
proceeded to shout that I was a 'disgusting faggot' and to
chase me," Koskovich said.
Roland van Gaalen, a member of the GLAS Steering
Committee, agreed with Koskovich's assessment of the
"liberal tolerance effect." But he did not completely agree
with Koskovich's relatively negative evaluation of life at
Stanford for gays.
"People are willing to put up with us, but that doesn't
mean that they don't find homosexuality disgusting," van
Gaalen said. "Tolerance isn't exactly what we need. I
mean, who wants to be tolerated?"
But van Gaalen added, "For gay people, this is really a
wonderful place."
Being socially unacceptable gives gays a stronger sense
of personal identity than non-gay people might have and
that sense of identity can only work for the general good

of the gay population, according to van Gaalen.
"When I was younger, I used to think my gayness was a
disadvantage," van Gaalen said. "I often wondered, 'Why
has this happened to me?' I no longer have that feeling. I
enjoy politics and I like controversy."
Koskovich associated this sense of positive self
identification that comes with accepting one's gayness as
the source of multiple positive effects. For one thing, it
helps the gay individual end the ritual of "internalized
oppression" he has been raised to inflict on himself, Kos
kovich said.
"We're all raised in a society that tells us that gay
people don't exist, gay people are disgusting and inferior.
Because we're all raised in that society — virtually all of
us have straight parents and families — we have inter
nalized these values as well," Koskovich said.
Thus, the first and foremost goal of GLAS has been to
convince gays that their identities matter, that they are not
non-entities, according to Koskovich.
If a gay hides his identity from himself and from society,
"you are still gay either way, but when you're pretending
(not to be), you're miserable, and you're oppressing and
blaming yourself. When you're open, you're happy be

cause you've accepted who you are, and if you encounter
problems with it, it is the fault of bigoted people outside
yourself. You can say, 'That's their problem, let them deal
with it,' or 'I will help them deal with it,' rather than
saying, 'I am blaming myself,' " Koskovich said.
In keeping with this goal, an important function of the
alliance is bringing gays together once a week at the Old
Firehouse for what it terms "informal socials." Anywhere
from 50 to 70 men throng to the second floor lounge of
the Firehouse every Wednesday evening to talk to friends
with whom many of them could not talk during the normal
course of the week for fear of blasting their pretended
straight identities. They stand around, they drink, they
talk, and as the night wears on, couples leave, arm in arm.
Stanford students are not the only men to come to these
socials, however. Students from other universities, high
school students, working men from Silicon Valley and the
occassional older man will drift in, looking for com
panionship. But for some of these men, the atmosphere of
these social gatherings is less than welcoming.
A man in his late 50s sat on one of the lounge couches

during one of the socials, looking around at what he per
ceived to be a clique-like atmosphere of well-established
gay college chums. "This isn't a sharing place," he
remarked, sipping from a cup of carrot juice and vodka
and staring endlessly at the chatting young men scattered
about the lounge. "This is a closed circle."
Apart from its purely social functions, GLAS serves as
the hub of gay political activism on campus. Gay leaders
see nothing problematic in the marriage of politics and
sexuality; indeed, they think that the two are inexorably
intertwined.
"If student organizations like GLAS are unwilling to
stand up for gay rights, then who will do it?" van Gaalen
asked. "We are in a kind of privileged position because we
are here at Stanford and we are a very well-established or
ganization. It's our duty to be politically active."
Koskovich added that it is only through being activist
that gays can hope to eliminate the societal notion that
gays are non-existent "The more that gay people come
out and are willing to be openly gay people in every cir
cumstance, the more that sincere, well-meaning, but uni
nformed non-gay people will come to understand what
our lives are about," he said.
"Non-gay people now must deal much more with the
subject of gayness by dealing directly with the people af
fected. They don't go off and read a book by some
homophobic psychiatrist about 'those people.' Instead of
being 'those people,' we're their next-door neighbors,
we're their classmates, we're their TAs, we're their pro

fessors. We are not a mysterious group of people lurking
somewhere in the shadows. The change in our own con
sciousness has had a profound impact on the understand
ing that non-gay people have of us," Koskovich said.
GLAS has actively tried to change the consciousness of
the general student population through publications,
forums, speakers and other activities, as well as through
the annual GALA Week activities.
In changing the administration's consciousness, GL.AS,
since the beginning of the decade, has focused on one
policy in particular: the administration's refusal to adopt a
non-discrimination policy on the basis of sexual orienta
tion.
Koskovich said the attitude of the administration is that
since there is no oppression of homosexuals at Stanford, a
policy of non-discrimination would be superfluous. "The
University is fooling itself if it honestly believes that there
is no problem with discrimination at Stanford. Since it is
possible for gay people to appear not to be gay. not having
a non-discrimination policy condemns those of us who are
not strong to pretend that we are not who we are out of
fear of being mistreated if we are open," Koskovich said.
The last major push for a non-discrimation policy oc
curred in 1980, when Stuart Reges, then an undergradu
ate majoring in engineering and now an assistant chair
man in computer science, proposed a "systematic revision
of all the various non-discrimination clauses contained in
University policy," Koskovich said. The University
refused to go through with the revision.
Although Stanford Law School adopted a non
discrimination policy in 1982, and, according to Kos
kovich, United Stanford Workers has had a similar policy
in effect since 1972, he feels it is time for GL.AS to initiate
another concerted effort to make the University change

its mind about non-discrimination policies. "We need to
convince Stanford's administration of the reality of
oppression in the lives of gay people, because they don't
want to believe it," Koskovich said.
GLAS has also involved itself in political issues, such as
AIDS and the recent "tea room" conroversy, that "could
conceivably hurt our image, van Gaalen said. Hovever,
"It would be grossly immoral if we ignored those pressing
issues, he said, adding, "By addressing these issues, we
show that we are a responsible organization and that we
care."
The alliance has responded to the AIDS controversy,
for example, by holding educational forums on the subject
and inviting speakers to campus to talk about the disease.
All this activity is focused on combating the attitude ex
emplified in a Southern Journal of Medicine editorial,
quoted by Rolling Stone writer David Black, implying
that AIDS was "a fulfillment of Saint Paul's pronounce
ment: "the due penalty of their error' " of men who
abandoned the natural function of the woman and
burned in their desire towards one another.' "
Regarding AIDS, Koskovich said, "I don't think you
blame people for a disease. One does not respond to
disease with bigotry. One responds to disease by seeking
after a cure, by seeking after healing."
(jLAS responded to the recent "tea room" sex scandals
by approaching the police and telling them it would be
counterproductive to expose to shame people who had no
other way of fulfilling their sexual needs short of destroy
ing their heterosexual facades and ruining their lives. The
alliance responded similarly in 1980 when bathroom raids
occurred.
Koskovich said that exposing these people to public
calumny only exacerbates the effects of the daily oppres
sion thev face, and it is in that vein that GLAS feels com

pelled to protect and inform bathroom sex shoppers about
the possible consequences of their actions.
The alliance's lesbian contingent is seemingly quieter
and less involved in gay activism than the men. Van
Gaalen said the two contingents of GLAS "get along
fine" despite the separation of their socials, and that the
apparent dormancy of the lesbian group arises from the
fact that there are fewer of them — between 30 and 50
come to the women's social each week, according to Kos
kovich — and that they divide their time between GLAS
and feminist activities not necessarily connected with les
bian issues.
"The lesbians at Stanford have a lot of political energy
that gets dissipated into feminist issues," Susannah
MacKaye, a member of the lesbian contingent, said. "The
appearance might be that we are quiet and less involved,
but that's not really the case."
Whatever the issues involved and the political and so
cial decisions that have to be made, gay leaders seem
confident that their struggles are not fruitless ones.
"There is still discrimination in the world, and that can be
a disadvantage," van Gaalen said. "But I'm very optimis
tic."
Koskovich concurred. "At Stanford I've always en
countered a sincere and genuine interest in hearing about
gay issues. Non-gay people are uncomfortable at first be
cause they don't know how to act or interact with gay
people.
"But as soon as you let them know that you're com
fortable with who you are, that you are very open to them
asking you about your life, they start doing so, and they
learn. And it's possible on that basis to become good
friends with non-gay people because you're communicat
ing and understanding ope another."
When analysts make estimates of the number of
homosexuals in a given population, they usually start by
using Alfred Kinsey's 1948 figure of 10 percent. With that
estimate, there are at least 1,200 gays and lesbians among
the student population of Stanford.

kovich said.
"We're all raised in a society that tells us that gay
people don't exist, gay people are disgusting and inferior.
Because we're all raised in that society — virtually all of
us have straight parents and families — we have inter
nalized these values as well," Koskovich said.
Thus, the first and foremost goal of GLAS has been to
convince gays that their identities matter, that they are not
non-entities, according to Koskovich.
If a gay hides his identity from himself and from society,
"you are still gay either way, but when you're pretending
(not to be), you're miserable, and you're oppressing and
blaming yourself. When you're open, you're happy be

cause you've accepted who you are, and if you encounter
problems with it, it is the fault of bigoted people outside
yourself. You can say, 'That's their problem, let them deal
with it,' or 'I will help them deal with it,' rather than
saying, 'I am blaming myself,' " Koskovich said.
In keeping with this goal, an important function of the
alliance is bringing gays together once a week at the Old
Firehouse for what it terms "informal socials." Anywhere
from 50 to 70 men throng to the second floor lounge of
the Firehouse every Wednesday evening to talk to friends
with whom many of them could not talk during the normal
course of the week for fear of blasting their pretended
straight identities. They stand around, they drink, they
talk, and as the night wears on, couples leave, arm in arm.
Stanford students are not the only men to come to these
socials, however. Students from other universities, high
school students, working men from Silicon Valley and the
occassional older man will drift in, looking for com
panionship. But for some of these men, the atmosphere of
these social gatherings is less than welcoming.
A man in his late 50s sat on one of the lounge couches

during one of the socials, looking around at what he per
ceived to be a clique-like atmosphere of well-established
gay college chums. "This isn't a sharing place," he
remarked, sipping from a cup of carrot juice and vodka
and staring endlessly at the chatting young men scattered
about the lounge. "This is a closed circle."
Apart from its purely social functions, GLAS serves as
the hub of gay political activism on campus. Gay leaders
see nothing problematic in the marriage of politics and
sexuality; indeed, they think that the two are inexorably
intertwined.
"If student organizations like GLAS are unwilling to
stand up for gay rights, then who will do it?" van Gaalen
asked. "We are in a kind of privileged position because we
are here at Stanford and we are a very well-established or
ganization. It's our duty to be politically active."
Koskovich added that it is only through being activist
that gays can hope to eliminate the societal notion that
gays are non-existent "The more that gay people come
out and are willing to be openly gay people in every cir
cumstance, the more that sincere, well-meaning, but uni
nformed non-gay people will come to understand what
our lives are about," he said.
"Non-gay people now must deal much more with the
subject of gayness by dealing directly with the people af
fected. They don't go off and read a book by some
homophobic psychiatrist about 'those people.' Instead of
being 'those people,' we're their next-door neighbors,
we're their classmates, we're their TAs, we're their pro

fessors. We are not a mysterious group of people lurking
somewhere in the shadows. The change in our own con
sciousness has had a profound impact on the understand
ing that non-gay people have of us," Koskovich said.
GLAS has actively tried to change the consciousness of
the general student population through publications,
forums, speakers and other activities, as well as through
the annual GALA Week activities.
In changing the administration's consciousness, GL.AS,
since the beginning of the decade, has focused on one
policy in particular: the administration's refusal to adopt a
non-discrimination policy on the basis of sexual orienta
tion.
Koskovich said the attitude of the administration is that
since there is no oppression of homosexuals at Stanford, a
policy of non-discrimination would be superfluous. "The
University is fooling itself if it honestly believes that there
is no problem with discrimination at Stanford. Since it is
possible for gay people to appear not to be gay. not having
a non-discrimination policy condemns those of us who are
not strong to pretend that we are not who we are out of
fear of being mistreated if we are open," Koskovich said.
The last major push for a non-discrimation policy oc
curred in 1980, when Stuart Reges, then an undergradu
ate majoring in engineering and now an assistant chair
man in computer science, proposed a "systematic revision
of all the various non-discrimination clauses contained in
University policy," Koskovich said. The University
refused to go through with the revision.
Although Stanford Law School adopted a non
discrimination policy in 1982, and, according to Kos
kovich, United Stanford Workers has had a similar policy
in effect since 1972, he feels it is time for GL.AS to initiate
another concerted effort to make the University change

its mind about non-discrimination policies. "We need to
convince Stanford's administration of the reality of
oppression in the lives of gay people, because they don't
want to believe it," Koskovich said.
GLAS has also involved itself in political issues, such as
AIDS and the recent "tea room" conroversy, that "could
conceivably hurt our image, van Gaalen said. Hovever,
"It would be grossly immoral if we ignored those pressing
issues, he said, adding, "By addressing these issues, we
show that we are a responsible organization and that we
care."
The alliance has responded to the AIDS controversy,
for example, by holding educational forums on the subject
and inviting speakers to campus to talk about the disease.
All this activity is focused on combating the attitude ex
emplified in a Southern Journal of Medicine editorial,
quoted by Rolling Stone writer David Black, implying
that AIDS was "a fulfillment of Saint Paul's pronounce
ment: "the due penalty of their error' " of men who
abandoned the natural function of the woman and
burned in their desire towards one another.' "
Regarding AIDS, Koskovich said, "I don't think you
blame people for a disease. One does not respond to
disease with bigotry. One responds to disease by seeking
after a cure, by seeking after healing."
(jLAS responded to the recent "tea room" sex scandals
by approaching the police and telling them it would be
counterproductive to expose to shame people who had no
other way of fulfilling their sexual needs short of destroy
ing their heterosexual facades and ruining their lives. The
alliance responded similarly in 1980 when bathroom raids
occurred.
Koskovich said that exposing these people to public
calumny only exacerbates the effects of the daily oppres
sion thev face, and it is in that vein that GLAS feels com

pelled to protect and inform bathroom sex shoppers about
the possible consequences of their actions.
The alliance's lesbian contingent is seemingly quieter
and less involved in gay activism than the men. Van
Gaalen said the two contingents of GLAS "get along
fine" despite the separation of their socials, and that the
apparent dormancy of the lesbian group arises from the
fact that there are fewer of them — between 30 and 50
come to the women's social each week, according to Kos
kovich — and that they divide their time between GLAS
and feminist activities not necessarily connected with les
bian issues.
"The lesbians at Stanford have a lot of political energy
that gets dissipated into feminist issues," Susannah
MacKaye, a member of the lesbian contingent, said. "The
appearance might be that we are quiet and less involved,
but that's not really the case."
Whatever the issues involved and the political and so
cial decisions that have to be made, gay leaders seem
confident that their struggles are not fruitless ones.
"There is still discrimination in the world, and that can be
a disadvantage," van Gaalen said. "But I'm very optimis
tic."
Koskovich concurred. "At Stanford I've always en
countered a sincere and genuine interest in hearing about
gay issues. Non-gay people are uncomfortable at first be
cause they don't know how to act or interact with gay
people.
"But as soon as you let them know that you're com
fortable with who you are, that you are very open to them
asking you about your life, they start doing so, and they
learn. And it's possible on that basis to become good
friends with non-gay people because you're communicat
ing and understanding ope another."
When analysts make estimates of the number of
homosexuals in a given population, they usually start by
using Alfred Kinsey's 1948 figure of 10 percent. With that
estimate, there are at least 1,200 gays and lesbians among
the student population of Stanford.
Leaders ot the gay community consider it a measure of
their success that a much higher percentage of those stu
dents are willing to "come out of the closet" and affirm
their identities as homosexuals now than in Kinsey's day.
At Stanford, gay leaders attribute their success in bringing
people out to changes in the fabric of society as a
whole, but also to the active lead that Stanford's gay stu
dent institutions have taken in protecting and advocating
gay students' rights.
Since 1970, what is now known as the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance at Stanlord has been the leading active institu
tion in that regard. This year's Gay And Lesbian Aware
ness (GALA) Week is a celebration of the 15th
anniversary of the organized status of gay men and les
bians at Stanford, and GLAS has scheduled an intensified
program ot campus-wide events designed, as GLAS ar
chivist Gerard Koskovich put it, to "bring the issues of im
portance to our community before the general public and
to demonstrate the way in which we are a part of the
entire Stanford community."
If GLAS seems obsessed with emphasizing how it is
part ot the general community, it is equally preoccupied
with highlighting the independence of its identity. Gay
leaders here differ as to what extent this paradoxical be
havior is a function of the problems gays face, specifically
regarding their being at Stanford.
Koskovich said the less oppressive situation for gays at
Stanford — relative to other communities — does not
necessarily add up to wholesale acceptance of gay people
here. "We do not tend to face a tremendous amount of
blatant, open, anti-gay sentiment or activity," he said.
"Most people at Stanford have been inculcated with the
liberal bourgeois ideology that it wouldn't be nice to let
anyone know about their homophobic sentiments."
The sum of all people at Stanford repressing their
homophobic stance is what Koskovich termed the "liberal
tolerance effect." He said this tolerant attitude keeps the

vast majority of students — and administrators — in the
dark about the realities of gay life.
Koskovich said that when he and a group of gay stu
dents recently met with Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington to discuss violence against and harassment of
gays, Herrington "assured us, in no uncertain terms, that
there was no violence against or harassment of gay people
at Stanford, since, 'after all, this is not San Francisco.'
Needless to say, those of us who were sitting at the table
who have experienced violence and harassment at Stan
ford found it astonishing that the chief of police would
assure us that it had never occurred," Koskovich said.
"It demonstrates that kind of liberal bourgeois thinking
that says, 4 We don't have to engage ourselves in the reality
of the oppression of gay people. We just have to convince
ourselves that they aren't oppressed and then the problem
will be solved.' Well, the problem isn't solved," he said.
Koskovich said he has been harassed, taunted and
chased here "on the average" of about twice a month "for
as long as I can remember." The most recent incident oc
curred about a month ago, soon after Koskovich had ap
peared as a representative of the gay community at a se
ries of fraternity forums.
"It was a Saturday afternoon, when it was pretty quiet. I
was at the post office. There were three other people
there, all young, upper-middle-class-looking white males.
They were the only other people anywhere in sight. They
obviously recognized who I was on the basis of my ap
pearance at one of these entities (forums). They
proceeded to shout that I was a 'disgusting faggot' and to
chase me," Koskovich said.
Roland van Gaalen, a member of the GLAS Steering
Committee, agreed with Koskovich's assessment of the
"liberal tolerance effect." But he did not completely agree
with Koskovich's relatively negative evaluation of life at
Stanford for gays.
"People are willing to put up with us, but that doesn't
mean that they don't find homosexuality disgusting," van
Gaalen said. "Tolerance isn't exactly what we need. I
mean, who wants to be tolerated?"
But van Gaalen added, "For gay people, this is really a
wonderful place."
Being socially unacceptable gives gays a stronger sense
of personal identity than non-gay people might have and
that sense of identity can only work for the general good

of the gay population, according to van Gaalen.
"When I was younger, I used to think my gayness was a
disadvantage," van Gaalen said. "I often wondered, 'Why
has this happened to me?' I no longer have that feeling. I
enjoy politics and I like controversy."
Koskovich associated this sense of positive self
identification that comes with accepting one's gayness as
the source of multiple positive effects. For one thing, it
helps the gay individual end the ritual of "internalized
oppression" he has been raised to inflict on himself, Kos
kovich said.
"We're all raised in a society that tells us that gay
people don't exist, gay people are disgusting and inferior.
Because we're all raised in that society — virtually all of
us have straight parents and families — we have inter
nalized these values as well," Koskovich said.
Thus, the first and foremost goal of GLAS has been to
convince gays that their identities matter, that they are not
non-entities, according to Koskovich.
If a gay hides his identity from himself and from society,
"you are still gay either way, but when you're pretending
(not to be), you're miserable, and you're oppressing and
blaming yourself. When you're open, you're happy be

cause you've accepted who you are, and if you encounter
problems with it, it is the fault of bigoted people outside
yourself. You can say, 'That's their problem, let them deal

saying, 'I am blaming myself,' " Koskovich said.

discrimination policy in 1982, and, according to Kos
kovich, United Stanford Workers has had a similar policy
in effect since 1972, he feels it is time for GL.AS to initiate
another concerted effort to make the University change

its mind about non-discrimination policies. "We need to
convince Stanford's administration of the reality of
oppression in the lives of gay people, because they don't
want to believe it," Koskovich said.
GLAS has also involved itself in political issues, such as
AIDS and the recent "tea room" conroversy, that "could
conceivably hurt our image, van Gaalen said. Hovever,
"It would be grossly immoral if we ignored those pressing
issues, he said, adding, "By addressing these issues, we
show that we are a responsible organization and that we
care."
The alliance has responded to the AIDS controversy,
for example, by holding educational forums on the subject
and inviting speakers to campus to talk about the disease.
All this activity is focused on combating the attitude ex
emplified in a Southern Journal of Medicine editorial,
quoted by Rolling Stone writer David Black, implying
that AIDS was "a fulfillment of Saint Paul's pronounce
ment: "the due penalty of their error' " of men who
abandoned the natural function of the woman and
burned in their desire towards one another.' "
Regarding AIDS, Koskovich said, "I don't think you
blame people for a disease. One does not respond to
disease with bigotry. One responds to disease by seeking
after a cure, by seeking after healing."
(jLAS responded to the recent "tea room" sex scandals
by approaching the police and telling them it would be
counterproductive to expose to shame people who had no
other way of fulfilling their sexual needs short of destroy
ing their heterosexual facades and ruining their lives. The
alliance responded similarly in 1980 when bathroom raids
occurred.
Koskovich said that exposing these people to public
calumny only exacerbates the effects of the daily oppres
sion thev face, and it is in that vein that GLAS feels com

pelled to protect and inform bathroom sex shoppers about
the possible consequences of their actions.
The alliance's lesbian contingent is seemingly quieter
and less involved in gay activism than the men. Van
Gaalen said the two contingents of GLAS "get along
fine" despite the separation of their socials, and that the
apparent dormancy of the lesbian group arises from the
fact that there are fewer of them — between 30 and 50
come to the women's social each week, according to Kos
kovich — and that they divide their time between GLAS
and feminist activities not necessarily connected with les
bian issues.
"The lesbians at Stanford have a lot of political energy
that gets dissipated into feminist issues," Susannah
MacKaye, a member of the lesbian contingent, said. "The
appearance might be that we are quiet and less involved,
but that's not really the case."
Whatever the issues involved and the political and so
cial decisions that have to be made, gay leaders seem
confident that their struggles are not fruitless ones.
"There is still discrimination in the world, and that can be
a disadvantage," van Gaalen said. "But I'm very optimis
tic."
Koskovich concurred. "At Stanford I've always en
countered a sincere and genuine interest in hearing about
gay issues. Non-gay people are uncomfortable at first be
cause they don't know how to act or interact with gay
people.
"But as soon as you let them know that you're com
fortable with who you are, that you are very open to them
asking you about your life, they start doing so, and they
learn. And it's possible on that basis to become good
friends with non-gay people because you're communicat
ing and understanding ope another."
When analysts make estimates of the number of
homosexuals in a given population, they usually start by
using Alfred Kinsey's 1948 figure of 10 percent. With that
estimate, there are at least 1,200 gays and lesbians among
the student population of Stanford.
Leaders ot the gay community consider it a measure of
their success that a much higher percentage of those stu
dents are willing to "come out of the closet" and affirm
their identities as homosexuals now than in Kinsey's day.
At Stanford, gay leaders attribute their success in bringing
people out to changes in the fabric of society as a
whole, but also to the active lead that Stanford's gay stu
dent institutions have taken in protecting and advocating
gay students' rights.
Since 1970, what is now known as the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance at Stanlord has been the leading active institu
tion in that regard. This year's Gay And Lesbian Aware
ness (GALA) Week is a celebration of the 15th
anniversary of the organized status of gay men and les
bians at Stanford, and GLAS has scheduled an intensified
program ot campus-wide events designed, as GLAS ar
chivist Gerard Koskovich put it, to "bring the issues of im
portance to our community before the general public and
to demonstrate the way in which we are a part of the
entire Stanford community."
If GLAS seems obsessed with emphasizing how it is
part ot the general community, it is equally preoccupied
with highlighting the independence of its identity. Gay
leaders here differ as to what extent this paradoxical be
havior is a function of the problems gays face, specifically
regarding their being at Stanford.
Koskovich said the less oppressive situation for gays at
Stanford — relative to other communities — does not
necessarily add up to wholesale acceptance of gay people
here. "We do not tend to face a tremendous amount of
blatant, open, anti-gay sentiment or activity," he said.
"Most people at Stanford have been inculcated with the
liberal bourgeois ideology that it wouldn't be nice to let
anyone know about their homophobic sentiments."
The sum of all people at Stanford repressing their
homophobic stance is what Koskovich termed the "liberal
tolerance effect." He said this tolerant attitude keeps the

vast majority of students — and administrators — in the
dark about the realities of gay life.
Koskovich said that when he and a group of gay stu
dents recently met with Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington to discuss violence against and harassment of
gays, Herrington "assured us, in no uncertain terms, that
there was no violence against or harassment of gay people
at Stanford, since, 'after all, this is not San Francisco.'
Needless to say, those of us who were sitting at the table
who have experienced violence and harassment at Stan
ford found it astonishing that the chief of police would
assure us that it had never occurred," Koskovich said.
"It demonstrates that kind of liberal bourgeois thinking
that says, 4 We don't have to engage ourselves in the reality
of the oppression of gay people. We just have to convince
ourselves that they aren't oppressed and then the problem
will be solved.' Well, the problem isn't solved," he said.
Koskovich said he has been harassed, taunted and
chased here "on the average" of about twice a month "for
as long as I can remember." The most recent incident oc
curred about a month ago, soon after Koskovich had ap
peared as a representative of the gay community at a se
ries of fraternity forums.
"It was a Saturday afternoon, when it was pretty quiet. I
was at the post office. There were three other people
there, all young, upper-middle-class-looking white males.
They were the only other people anywhere in sight. They
obviously recognized who I was on the basis of my ap
pearance at one of these entities (forums). They
proceeded to shout that I was a 'disgusting faggot' and to
chase me," Koskovich said.
Roland van Gaalen, a member of the GLAS Steering
Committee, agreed with Koskovich's assessment of the
"liberal tolerance effect." But he did not completely agree
with Koskovich's relatively negative evaluation of life at
Stanford for gays.
"People are willing to put up with us, but that doesn't
mean that they don't find homosexuality disgusting," van
Gaalen said. "Tolerance isn't exactly what we need. I
mean, who wants to be tolerated?"
But van Gaalen added, "For gay people, this is really a
wonderful place."
Being socially unacceptable gives gays a stronger sense
of personal identity than non-gay people might have and
that sense of identity can only work for the general good

of the gay population, according to van Gaalen.
"When I was younger, I used to think my gayness was a
disadvantage," van Gaalen said. "I often wondered, 'Why
has this happened to me?' I no longer have that feeling. I
enjoy politics and I like controversy."
Koskovich associated this sense of positive self
identification that comes with accepting one's gayness as
the source of multiple positive effects. For one thing, it
helps the gay individual end the ritual of "internalized
oppression" he has been raised to inflict on himself, Kos
kovich said.
"We're all raised in a society that tells us that gay
people don't exist, gay people are disgusting and inferior.
Because we're all raised in that society — virtually all of
us have straight parents and families — we have inter
nalized these values as well," Koskovich said.
Thus, the first and foremost goal of GLAS has been to
convince gays that their identities matter, that they are not
non-entities, according to Koskovich.
If a gay hides his identity from himself and from society,
"you are still gay either way, but when you're pretending
(not to be), you're miserable, and you're oppressing and
blaming yourself. When you're open, you're happy be

cause you've accepted who you are, and if you encounter
problems with it, it is the fault of bigoted people outside
yourself. You can say, 'That's their problem, let them deal
with it,' or 'I will help them deal with it,' rather than
saying, 'I am blaming myself,' " Koskovich said.
In keeping with this goal, an important function of the
alliance is bringing gays together once a week at the Old
Firehouse for what it terms "informal socials." Anywhere
from 50 to 70 men throng to the second floor lounge of
the Firehouse every Wednesday evening to talk to friends
with whom many of them could not talk during the normal
course of the week for fear of blasting their pretended
straight identities. They stand around, they drink, they
talk, and as the night wears on, couples leave, arm in arm.
Stanford students are not the only men to come to these
socials, however. Students from other universities, high
school students, working men from Silicon Valley and the
occassional older man will drift in, looking for com
panionship. But for some of these men, the atmosphere of
these social gatherings is less than welcoming.
A man in his late 50s sat on one of the lounge couches

during one of the socials, looking around at what he per
ceived to be a clique-like atmosphere of well-established
gay college chums. "This isn't a sharing place," he
remarked, sipping from a cup of carrot juice and vodka
and staring endlessly at the chatting young men scattered
about the lounge. "This is a closed circle."
Apart from its purely social functions, GLAS serves as
the hub of gay political activism on campus. Gay leaders
see nothing problematic in the marriage of politics and
sexuality; indeed, they think that the two are inexorably
intertwined.
"If student organizations like GLAS are unwilling to
stand up for gay rights, then who will do it?" van Gaalen
asked. "We are in a kind of privileged position because we
are here at Stanford and we are a very well-established or
ganization. It's our duty to be politically active."
Koskovich added that it is only through being activist
that gays can hope to eliminate the societal notion that
gays are non-existent "The more that gay people come
out and are willing to be openly gay people in every cir
cumstance, the more that sincere, well-meaning, but uni
nformed non-gay people will come to understand what
our lives are about," he said.
"Non-gay people now must deal much more with the
subject of gayness by dealing directly with the people af
fected. They don't go off and read a book by some
homophobic psychiatrist about 'those people.' Instead of
being 'those people,' we're their next-door neighbors,
we're their classmates, we're their TAs, we're their pro

fessors. We are not a mysterious group of people lurking
somewhere in the shadows. The change in our own con
sciousness has had a profound impact on the understand
ing that non-gay people have of us," Koskovich said.
GLAS has actively tried to change the consciousness of
the general student population through publications,
forums, speakers and other activities, as well as through
the annual GALA Week activities.
In changing the administration's consciousness, GL.AS,
since the beginning of the decade, has focused on one
policy in particular: the administration's refusal to adopt a
non-discrimination policy on the basis of sexual orienta
tion.
Koskovich said the attitude of the administration is that
since there is no oppression of homosexuals at Stanford, a
policy of non-discrimination would be superfluous. "The
University is fooling itself if it honestly believes that there
is no problem with discrimination at Stanford. Since it is
possible for gay people to appear not to be gay. not having
a non-discrimination policy condemns those of us who are
not strong to pretend that we are not who we are out of
fear of being mistreated if we are open," Koskovich said.
The last major push for a non-discrimation policy oc
curred in 1980, when Stuart Reges, then an undergradu
ate majoring in engineering and now an assistant chair
man in computer science, proposed a "systematic revision
of all the various non-discrimination clauses contained in
University policy," Koskovich said. The University
refused to go through with the revision.
Although Stanford Law School adopted a non
discrimination policy in 1982, and, according to Kos
kovich, United Stanford Workers has had a similar policy
in effect since 1972, he feels it is time for GL.AS to initiate
another concerted effort to make the University change

its mind about non-discrimination policies. "We need to
convince Stanford's administration of the reality of
oppression in the lives of gay people, because they don't
want to believe it," Koskovich said.
