# International Festival promotes sharing
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
The smell of Taiwanese shish
kabobs, Vietnamese spring rolls and
other delicacies from around the
world filled the air while the sound of
music from instrumental and dancing
groups of 10 countries rose above the
talk and laughter of an international
crowd of about 600.
Algerians mingled with Turks;
Malaysians ate lunch with South
Africans; Americans joked with a
Nicaraguan; Englishmen shared the
sunshine with Indians.
No, it was not the United Nations
or an international economics confer
ence. It was Stanford's sixth annual
International Festival, organized by
the Bechtel International Center.
Saturday afternoon, Stanford stu
dents from every corner of the world
gathered in the sunny backyard of the
center "to share their cultures with
the rest of us," according to Susan
Whittlesey, program coordinator for
the center and director of the festival.
About 250 students from 30 na
tions set up booths to sell their na
tional foods, display artwork and
native dress and provide information
about their countries. Musical and

dance groups representing 10
countries entertained the crowd with
a full five hours of performances
while spectators gorged themselves
on exotic edibles and crafts.
Various organizations with interna
tional scopes, including the Stanford
International Development Organi
zation, Amigos de las Americas and
the Stanford East African Relief Or
ganization, promoted their programs
at 13 other tables.
For much of the crowd, however,
the main attraction of the day was the
food, and the most difficult decision
was which of the delicacies to sample:
whether to try Malaysian curry
a British ploughman's lunch,
r pastries, Algerian chicken pie
or — for the less adventuresome —
American apple pie.
"We came to eat our way around
the world," explained Jim Kauffman,
a Stanford graduate and resident of
Portola Valley who attended the fes
tival with his wife and six-year-old
son.
"We come every year and we just
love it," added his wife Priscilla.
"We've traveled a lot, and we came
here to refresh our memories and
tummies. It's just a lot of fun."

A law student attending the festival
explained his presence simply by
saying "food."
By 2 p.m., the unexpectedly large
gathering had bought out many of the
gourmet tables, and people sat on the
lawn to digest the foods they had
consumed and to watch the interna
tional array of music and dancing
which began at 11 a.m. Groups of
students representing Turkey, Bul
garia, Hungary, Indonesia, Korea and
Scotland danced in traditional
costumes. A Chinese chorus, a
Spanish classical guitarist, an Ameri
can banjo player and children learn
ing to play the violin by the Japanese
Suzuki Method also performed.
The festival — "bigger than ever
before," according to Whittlesey —
was the product of a great deal of
work and planning.
Cemal Dincer, a graduate student
who served food at the Turkish table,
said he and some of the 25 Turkish
students at Stanford had been plan
nine their booth for two months.
Because the Turkish students have
taken part in the festival for the past
three years, "This year went rather
straightforwardly. We now know
Stanford's tastes," he said.

"We want to show Turkish food
and culture — that is our main ob
jective," Dincer added.
Representatives of other countries
echoed the desire to present their
foods to Americans and promote
their nations.
Inger Sandell-Tucker, the wife of a
graduate student here, said as she
served Finnish Karelian pastries,
"We want to introduce this dish you
can't get anywhere else and advertise
our country."
Hsih-Hao Huang, a graduate stu
dent from Taiwan, said, "We want to
introduce our general culture," as he
waited on customers who wanted
their names written in elaborate
Chinese calligraphy.
Not surprisingly, one of the few
tables where business was "not too
good" was that representing the
United States, where two students
sold apple pie and bacon, lettuce and
tomato sandwiches. Phil Stewart, a
graduate student manning the booth,
said, "At least there are a lot of inter
national people here. If it were only
American people coming to an inter
national festival, we might be doing

worse.
One apple pie customer said she
bought it for a Swedish friend to show
him "an ail-American favorite."
At the South African table, the
wife of a graduate student said she

wanted to show that her country is
"part of the international commu
nity." She added, "We would like to
introduce people to the real South
Africa — not what they hear in the
press."
Because of the current campus
protest against South Africa's policy
of apartheid and Stanford's invest
ments in companies doing business in
that country, the South Africans al

most did not come to the festival, ac
cording to Whittlesey.
When the protest began on April
24, the South Africans canceled their
plans to take part in the festival, she
said. "But we talked about it, and
somehow they felt they wanted to be
here," Whittlesey added.
Javier Morales, a Nicaraguan and a
graduate student at the Food Re
search Institute, sold a stew of rice,

seafood, pork and vegetables, with
the assistance of a Mexican friend.
"The idea is to have all countries
cooperate for good things: under
standing, peace, food," said Morales
putting special emphasis on the word
"food."
He said, however, that he thinks
food is not just for satisfying one's ap
petite. Morales reminisced about his

days as an agricultural worker in
Panama and remembered one of his
leaders there who used to say
repeatedly, "Food means peace," as
he tried to promote food production.
Summing up the International
Center's purpose in holding the fes
tival, Whittlesey noted the efforts of
two Greek students who decided
Friday at 3 p.m. to have a table and
worked that night to plan their effort.

"I'm really thrilled that the Greeks
got together," she said. "That's what
it's all about — everyone enjoying
each other's cultures, being together
and not having any conflict."
Lee Zeigler, the director of the
center, said the center received no
money from the festival.
"It's purely a question of love," he
said.

cooperate for good things: under
standing, peace, food," said Morales
putting special emphasis on the word
"food."
He said, however, that he thinks
food is not just for satisfying one's ap
petite. Morales reminisced about his

days as an agricultural worker in
Panama and remembered one of his
leaders there who used to say
repeatedly, "Food means peace," as
he tried to promote food production.
Summing up the International
Center's purpose in holding the fes
tival, Whittlesey noted the efforts of
two Greek students who decided
Friday at 3 p.m. to have a table and
worked that night to plan their effort.

"I'm really thrilled that the Greeks
got together," she said. "That's what
it's all about — everyone enjoying
each other's cultures, being together
and not having any conflict."
Lee Zeigler, the director of the
center, said the center received no
money from the festival.
"It's purely a question of love," he
said.
The smell of Taiwanese shish
kabobs, Vietnamese spring rolls and
other delicacies from around the
world filled the air while the sound of
music from instrumental and dancing
groups of 10 countries rose above the
talk and laughter of an international
crowd of about 600.
Algerians mingled with Turks;
Malaysians ate lunch with South
Africans; Americans joked with a
Nicaraguan; Englishmen shared the
sunshine with Indians.
No, it was not the United Nations
or an international economics confer
ence. It was Stanford's sixth annual
International Festival, organized by
the Bechtel International Center.
Saturday afternoon, Stanford stu
dents from every corner of the world
gathered in the sunny backyard of the
center "to share their cultures with
the rest of us," according to Susan
Whittlesey, program coordinator for
the center and director of the festival.
About 250 students from 30 na
tions set up booths to sell their na
tional foods, display artwork and
native dress and provide information
about their countries. Musical and

dance groups representing 10
countries entertained the crowd with
a full five hours of performances
while spectators gorged themselves
on exotic edibles and crafts.
Various organizations with interna
tional scopes, including the Stanford
International Development Organi
zation, Amigos de las Americas and
the Stanford East African Relief Or
ganization, promoted their programs
at 13 other tables.
For much of the crowd, however,
the main attraction of the day was the
food, and the most difficult decision
was which of the delicacies to sample:
whether to try Malaysian curry
a British ploughman's lunch,
r pastries, Algerian chicken pie
or — for the less adventuresome —
American apple pie.
"We came to eat our way around
the world," explained Jim Kauffman,
a Stanford graduate and resident of
Portola Valley who attended the fes
tival with his wife and six-year-old
son.
"We come every year and we just
love it," added his wife Priscilla.
"We've traveled a lot, and we came
here to refresh our memories and
tummies. It's just a lot of fun."

A law student attending the festival
explained his presence simply by
saying "food."
By 2 p.m., the unexpectedly large
gathering had bought out many of the
gourmet tables, and people sat on the
lawn to digest the foods they had
consumed and to watch the interna
tional array of music and dancing
which began at 11 a.m. Groups of
students representing Turkey, Bul
garia, Hungary, Indonesia, Korea and
Scotland danced in traditional
costumes. A Chinese chorus, a
Spanish classical guitarist, an Ameri
can banjo player and children learn
ing to play the violin by the Japanese
Suzuki Method also performed.
The festival — "bigger than ever
before," according to Whittlesey —
was the product of a great deal of
work and planning.
Cemal Dincer, a graduate student
who served food at the Turkish table,
said he and some of the 25 Turkish
students at Stanford had been plan
nine their booth for two months.
Because the Turkish students have
taken part in the festival for the past
three years, "This year went rather
straightforwardly. We now know
Stanford's tastes," he said.

"We want to show Turkish food
and culture — that is our main ob
jective," Dincer added.
Representatives of other countries
echoed the desire to present their
foods to Americans and promote
their nations.
Inger Sandell-Tucker, the wife of a
graduate student here, said as she
served Finnish Karelian pastries,
"We want to introduce this dish you
can't get anywhere else and advertise
our country."
Hsih-Hao Huang, a graduate stu
dent from Taiwan, said, "We want to
introduce our general culture," as he
waited on customers who wanted
their names written in elaborate
Chinese calligraphy.
Not surprisingly, one of the few
tables where business was "not too
good" was that representing the
United States, where two students
sold apple pie and bacon, lettuce and
tomato sandwiches. Phil Stewart, a
graduate student manning the booth,
said, "At least there are a lot of inter
national people here. If it were only
American people coming to an inter
national festival, we might be doing

worse.
One apple pie customer said she
bought it for a Swedish friend to show
him "an ail-American favorite."
At the South African table, the
wife of a graduate student said she

wanted to show that her country is
"part of the international commu
nity." She added, "We would like to
introduce people to the real South
Africa — not what they hear in the
press."
Because of the current campus
protest against South Africa's policy
of apartheid and Stanford's invest
ments in companies doing business in
that country, the South Africans al

most did not come to the festival, ac
cording to Whittlesey.
When the protest began on April
24, the South Africans canceled their
plans to take part in the festival, she
said. "But we talked about it, and
somehow they felt they wanted to be
here," Whittlesey added.
Javier Morales, a Nicaraguan and a
graduate student at the Food Re
search Institute, sold a stew of rice,

seafood, pork and vegetables, with
the assistance of a Mexican friend.
"The idea is to have all countries
cooperate for good things: under
standing, peace, food," said Morales
putting special emphasis on the word
"food."
