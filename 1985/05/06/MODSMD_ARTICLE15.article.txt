## THE 						STANFORD DAILY Celebrating with GLAS 
### 
In the alphabet soup of student organizations,
letters appear and disappear with some
regularity. Acronym-titled groups that were ac
tive yesterday are gone today, their causes taken
up by others or forgotten altogether. But one
Stanford group is still going strong after 15 years.
This year, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance at
Stanford celebrates the 15th anniversary of the
continuous organized status of gay men and les
bians at Stanford. GLAS began in 1970 as the
Gay Students' Union, which changed its name in
1972 to the Gay People's Union at Stanford
when the group applied for and received Univer
sity recognition. In celebrating the GPU's 10th
anniversary, the group changed its name again,
this time to the Gay and Lesbian Alliance at
Stanford.
The names may have changed, but the long
term goals have remained the same: to promote
awareness and acceptance of homosexuality, and
to make Stanford a more open place for gay men
and lesbians.
One of GLAS's biggest projects is the annual
Gay and Lesbian Awareness (GALA) Week, the
1985 version of which began yesterday. Today is
the annual Gay and Lesbian Blue Jeans Day,

when "the friends and members of the Gay and
Lesbian Alliance will be wearing blue jeans all
day to show their support for the goals of GALA
Week." It's a sly idea that works marvelously,
challenging all of us to think, if even for a brief
moment while dressing, about gay men and les
bians, and about our feelings toward them.
Since the organization of the Gay People's
Union 15 years ago, life has improved for gay
men and lesbians at Stanford, a relatively
liberated community for most people. As one
GLAS member said, "For gay people, this is
really a wonderful place." But we still have a long
way to go: GLAS representatives are chased
across campus by insult-shouting Neanderthals,
anonymous "artists" scribble anti-gay messages
on bathroom walls, and George Segal's "Gay
Liberation" sculpture here is repeatedly van
dalized.
The struggles ahead of us, however, should not
be as difficult as the struggles behind us. And
with GLAS at the forefront, we can be sure that
this struggle for total equality will go on until it is
finally won. For that, GLAS deserves our respect
and our congratulations. Here's to another 15
years.
