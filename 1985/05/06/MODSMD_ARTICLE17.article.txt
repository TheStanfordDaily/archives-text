How did South Africa come to have its apartheid
(segregation) system?
The system was designed basically to protect
white, Afrikaner (Dutch-speaking) labor from
competition from black labor. It has also served to
protect Afrikaner business from potential rivals
and to subsidize disciplinary measures imposed on
black labor — measures that would not have been
accepted voluntarily by black labor or that would
have been too costly for private-sector implemen
tation.
The key events in South African history are the
Rand mining district strike of 1922 and the subse
quent national parliamentary election of 1924.
In 1922, white miners went on strike to protest
the opening up of large numbers of mining jobs to
non-white workers. The miners' strike, together
with other labor disputes, escalated into open
armed rebellion that included white-worker armed
commando raids on black workers.
White labor militant W.H. Andrews, who was
soon to become secretary of the South African
Communist Party, played a leading role in the
rebellion. The militant unionists, including the
Communist Party, were quite willing to justify the
slogan, "Workers of the World, Fight and Unite for
a White South Africa" — the slogan around which
the strike was organized. Of the four strike leaders
executed by the government, three went to the gal
lows singing "The Red Flag" (the radical anthem of
the British labor movement).
Although the strike was crushed, it provided the
impetus for an alliance of the Afrikaner
Nationalists and the South African Labour Party
that took over the government in 1924 and
launched what has become the apartheid system.
That 1924 political alliance is the direct ancestor of
today's ruling Nationalist party.
The 1922 Rand Rebellion and 1924 election were
the culmination of labor organizing, going back to
the 1890s, that had sought to erect a "color bar" to
exclude blacks from skilled jobs.
Stanford historian George Frederickson writes:
"The impulse behind this policy was strikingly
similar to that which inspired the racially exclusion
ary policies of American craft unions.
"In neither case could the desire for discrimina
tion be ascribed to a conviction that blacks were

inherently inferior; it was in fact in recognition of
their ability to compete successfully that inspired a
desire to establish artificial limits on their opportu
nities as a way of guaranteeing the security of white
jobs."
Even before the enactment in 1926 of an explicit
color bar, the preceeding government had estab
lished a policy to enforce equal pay for equal work
in private industry. This policy was correctly under
stood hy its advocates as blocking black gains by
barring less skilled black labor from undercutting
"civilized" white labor.

The entire apartheid system has been one of
white privilege, especially Afrikaner privilege. That
privilege fundamentally takes the form of subsidies
and protections from competition. Early fore
shadowings of apartheid can be seen in the
indentured-servitude status of late 19th-century
black mine workers — blacks who had been
deliberately forced into work by high taxes and
were held in bondage by desertion laws.
Today's internal passport laws in South Africa
were originally enacted to help track down black
"deserters" from the mines. Land reservation laws
were meant to prevent the more prosperous
African peasants from buying land in "European"
areas, to legitimize white land thefts from blacks,
and to add police controls over black urban labor.
Job reservation laws allocated jobs by race and
protected the white labor establishment.
Even the post-World War II creation of a "hot
house" Afrikaner business elite, subsidized and
protected by the government, is simply another
chapter in the history of white privilege. This
Afrikaner business elite has fattened itself through
friendly Afrikaner control of the government. It is
no accident that South Africa's economy has a huge

public sector and extensive government interven
tion.
The entire history of apartheid has been one of
massive state-socialism, supported by racist ideol
ogy. For further background on current events in
South Africa, I recommend: W.H. Hutt, "The Eco
nomics of the Colour Bar," and Ralph Horowitz,
"The Political Economy of South Africa."
Apartheid was installed politically, and it will
have to be destroyed politically. Current black un
rest is the functional equivalent of the 1922 Rand
Rebellion — except that the blacks are justified in
their rebellion.
In the meantime, foreign capital investment has
the effect of raising the income and standard of
living of the blacks.
Foreign investment does this directly through job
creation and hiring and indirectly through causing
higher wage rates and employment in secondary
businesses (often managed by blacks) in the geo
graphical areas in which foreign investment is con
centrated.
In contrast, disinvestment will cause serious
hardship to black people. As South African apart
heid foe Alan Paton wrote in the April 3 New York
Times, disinvestment proponents "ought to be told
that they are going to bring hunger and suffering to
many black people."
The mayp; pillars of apartheid in South Africa are
the government and the white labor unions; eco
nomic sanctions will only encourage the leaders of
these institutions to circle the wagons in defense of
apartheid. 1
In comparison with the South African govern
ment and white labor, foreign corporations are a
progressive force.
Most important, if blacks are to continue to keep
up the kind of pressure that will make the apartheid
system unviable, the blacks need an economic base
of support, and many blacks' livelihoods depend on
foreign investment.
Apartheid can be brought down by popular black
pressure from below — but only if the blacks have
enough food in their bellies to sustain the struggle.

How did South Africa come to have its apartheid
(segregation) system?
The system was designed basically to protect
white, Afrikaner (Dutch-speaking) labor from
competition from black labor. It has also served to
protect Afrikaner business from potential rivals
and to subsidize disciplinary measures imposed on
black labor — measures that would not have been
accepted voluntarily by black labor or that would
have been too costly for private-sector implemen
tation.
The key events in South African history are the
Rand mining district strike of 1922 and the subse
quent national parliamentary election of 1924.
In 1922, white miners went on strike to protest
the opening up of large numbers of mining jobs to
non-white workers. The miners' strike, together
with other labor disputes, escalated into open
armed rebellion that included white-worker armed
commando raids on black workers.
White labor militant W.H. Andrews, who was
soon to become secretary of the South African
Communist Party, played a leading role in the
rebellion. The militant unionists, including the
Communist Party, were quite willing to justify the
slogan, "Workers of the World, Fight and Unite for
a White South Africa" — the slogan around which
the strike was organized. Of the four strike leaders
executed by the government, three went to the gal
lows singing "The Red Flag" (the radical anthem of
the British labor movement).
Although the strike was crushed, it provided the
impetus for an alliance of the Afrikaner
Nationalists and the South African Labour Party
that took over the government in 1924 and
launched what has become the apartheid system.
That 1924 political alliance is the direct ancestor of
today's ruling Nationalist party.
The 1922 Rand Rebellion and 1924 election were
the culmination of labor organizing, going back to
the 1890s, that had sought to erect a "color bar" to
exclude blacks from skilled jobs.
Stanford historian George Frederickson writes:
"The impulse behind this policy was strikingly
similar to that which inspired the racially exclusion
ary policies of American craft unions.
"In neither case could the desire for discrimina
tion be ascribed to a conviction that blacks were

inherently inferior; it was in fact in recognition of
their ability to compete successfully that inspired a
desire to establish artificial limits on their opportu
nities as a way of guaranteeing the security of white
jobs."
Even before the enactment in 1926 of an explicit
color bar, the preceeding government had estab
lished a policy to enforce equal pay for equal work
in private industry. This policy was correctly under
stood hy its advocates as blocking black gains by
barring less skilled black labor from undercutting
"civilized" white labor.

The entire apartheid system has been one of
white privilege, especially Afrikaner privilege. That
privilege fundamentally takes the form of subsidies
and protections from competition. Early fore
shadowings of apartheid can be seen in the
indentured-servitude status of late 19th-century
black mine workers — blacks who had been
deliberately forced into work by high taxes and
were held in bondage by desertion laws.
Today's internal passport laws in South Africa
were originally enacted to help track down black
"deserters" from the mines. Land reservation laws
were meant to prevent the more prosperous
African peasants from buying land in "European"
areas, to legitimize white land thefts from blacks,
and to add police controls over black urban labor.
Job reservation laws allocated jobs by race and
protected the white labor establishment.
Even the post-World War II creation of a "hot
house" Afrikaner business elite, subsidized and
protected by the government, is simply another
chapter in the history of white privilege. This
Afrikaner business elite has fattened itself through
friendly Afrikaner control of the government. It is
no accident that South Africa's economy has a huge

public sector and extensive government interven
tion.
The entire history of apartheid has been one of
massive state-socialism, supported by racist ideol
ogy. For further background on current events in
South Africa, I recommend: W.H. Hutt, "The Eco
nomics of the Colour Bar," and Ralph Horowitz,
