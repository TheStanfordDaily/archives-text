## Total divestment: the only answer 
### 
In his viewpoint (The Daily, April 30), Prof.
David Abernethy offers an argument concerning
Stanford divestment from South Africa. His posi
tion lies between that held by the University ad
ministration and that held by the campus
organization Stanford' Out of South Africa
(SOSA). It is my opinion that his argument has
fundamental flaws which I would like to point out.
Abernethy's proposals at the end of his view
point, which point to a type of selective divestment
on the part of the University, promise no significant
changes. The trustees already have established a
policy governing purchases of stock which states
that Stanford should not invest in corporations
which sell arms to the South African police or
army. In spite of this fact, the University recently

VIEWPOINT

admitted that Hitachi, * company in which Stan
ford has major holdings, has been selling munitions
materials to the South African law enforcement
agencies.
Abernethy also points out that "the trustees
should indicate their willingness to initiate and co
sponsor proxy resolutions expressing their con
cerns." Since the 1977 anti-apartheid movement,
the trustees have had the opportunity to indicate
their concern over this issue and to use their influ
ence as shareholders to effect change within the
current system. In spite of this fact. University
President Donald Kennedy admitted at the rally on
April 24 that no such stockholder resolutions had
been sponsored by members of the Board of Trus
tees and that the members were open to criticism
for that reason.
In addition, Abernethy calls for stockholder
resolutions which express concern over the issue.
However, the United Nations has been expressing
its concern for many years; in spite of this fact, vio
lence against South African blacks has only esc
alated. and the white regime has continued to
increase its military involvement in countries bor
dering South Africa.
Two weeks ago, members of the Black Student
Union expressed concern to Kennedy over Stan
ford's involvement in South Africa, and his
response at that time was simply that the University
investment policy was firmly established and not
subject to change. It was only when SOSA called
for total divestment and staged a campus-wide

protest that the University began to listen. As a
result, the issue has now been placed on the agenda
of the May 14-15 meeting of the Board of Trustees.
Clearly, expressions of concern are not effective in
bringing about fundamental change.
Abernethy claims that, "One important conse
quence (of divestment) would be a reduction in the
income available to the growing black trade union
movement." It is important to point out that there
is no question that blacks will not be hurt by U.S.
divestment. It is a fact that there are fewer than

The debilitating eco
nomic effects of divest
ment on the black
population would be
small enough to be
negligible, while the pos
itive social, political and
economic gains for the
black majority would be
overwhelming.

100.000 blacks employed by U.S. companies in
South Africa and that this represents less than 1
percent of the total black work force in South
Africa. The debilitating economic effects of divest
ment on the black population would be small
enough to be negligible, while the positive social,
political and economic gains for the black majority
would be overwhelming.
Furthermore. Abernethy argues that the pres
ence of U.S. corporations in South Africa "can be
useful in the event of a general strike. ..." I find
this attitude to be extremely paternalistic. Are
South African blacks not capable of striking on
their own? Do they not at least deserve to be given
the power of self-determination once and for all?

This is, in fact, one of the main reasons why
SOSA is standing so firmly behind the principle of
total divestment of Stanford and U.S. interests in
South Africa. Black South Africans have been
denied their most fundamental rights since the
Dutch founded the Capetown province in 1652. At
last, the blacks are in a position where they are
gaining the power to effect social change. Black
majority rule seems to be a prospect which is be
coming more likely every day. The United States
and our Western allies have no right to tell the
blacks how to run their struggle for revolutionary
change.
This does not mean, as some might argue, that I
am in favor of a Marxist totalitarian regime becom
ing established in South Africa. Nor, for that mat
ter, am I in favor of a capitalist democracy. I simply
stand behind the right of the black majority in
South Africa to control its own destiny.
The United States has a moral obligation to
withdraw its investments from the South African
economy, and in this way show its support for the
South African blacks who arc working for change
in their country. Groups such as the African Na
tional Congress have been struggling for decades to
defeat the whites in South Africa, but with the fin
ancial support offered by the International Mone
tary Fund and foreign investors to the white South
African regime, their struggle has been much more
difficult than it would have been without that sup
port.
As former South African Prime Minister J.B.
Vorster said, "Each trade agreement, each bank
loan, each new investment is another brick in the
wall of our continued existence."
A final point is that the movement toward total
divestment is in the best interest of the United
States and of the international community as a
whole. Revolution followed by black majority rule
in South Africa is imminent, and if we wish to end
up on the side of the majority — the side of those
who soon will be in control of the natural resources
essential to the world economy — we need to be on
the side of the black majority. That majority is now
calling for total divestment of U.S. interests from
South Africa. As Winnie Mandela, a leader in the
revolutionary struggle, recently said, "We will re
member those who were on our side, and we have a
very long memory."

South Africa and that this represents less than 1
percent of the total black work force in South
Africa. The debilitating economic effects of divest
ment on the black population would be small
enough to be negligible, while the positive social,
political and economic gains for the black majority
would be overwhelming.
Furthermore. Abernethy argues that the pres
ence of U.S. corporations in South Africa "can be
useful in the event of a general strike. ..." I find
this attitude to be extremely paternalistic. Are
South African blacks not capable of striking on
their own? Do they not at least deserve to be given
the power of self-determination once and for all?

This is, in fact, one of the main reasons why
SOSA is standing so firmly behind the principle of
total divestment of Stanford and U.S. interests in
South Africa. Black South Africans have been
denied their most fundamental rights since the
Dutch founded the Capetown province in 1652. At
last, the blacks are in a position where they are
gaining the power to effect social change. Black
majority rule seems to be a prospect which is be
coming more likely every day. The United States
and our Western allies have no right to tell the
blacks how to run their struggle for revolutionary
change.
This does not mean, as some might argue, that I
am in favor of a Marxist totalitarian regime becom
ing established in South Africa. Nor, for that mat
ter, am I in favor of a capitalist democracy. I simply
stand behind the right of the black majority in
South Africa to control its own destiny.
The United States has a moral obligation to
withdraw its investments from the South African
economy, and in this way show its support for the
South African blacks who arc working for change
in their country. Groups such as the African Na
tional Congress have been struggling for decades to
defeat the whites in South Africa, but with the fin
ancial support offered by the International Mone
tary Fund and foreign investors to the white South
African regime, their struggle has been much more
difficult than it would have been without that sup
port.
As former South African Prime Minister J.B.
Vorster said, "Each trade agreement, each bank
loan, each new investment is another brick in the
wall of our continued existence."
A final point is that the movement toward total
divestment is in the best interest of the United
States and of the international community as a
whole. Revolution followed by black majority rule
in South Africa is imminent, and if we wish to end
up on the side of the majority — the side of those
who soon will be in control of the natural resources
essential to the world economy — we need to be on
the side of the black majority. That majority is now
calling for total divestment of U.S. interests from
South Africa. As Winnie Mandela, a leader in the
revolutionary struggle, recently said, "We will re
member those who were on our side, and we have a
very long memory."

In his viewpoint (The Daily, April 30), Prof.
David Abernethy offers an argument concerning
Stanford divestment from South Africa. His posi
tion lies between that held by the University ad
ministration and that held by the campus
organization Stanford' Out of South Africa
(SOSA). It is my opinion that his argument has
fundamental flaws which I would like to point out.
Abernethy's proposals at the end of his view
point, which point to a type of selective divestment
on the part of the University, promise no significant
changes. The trustees already have established a
policy governing purchases of stock which states
that Stanford should not invest in corporations
which sell arms to the South African police or
army. In spite of this fact, the University recently

admitted that Hitachi, * company in which Stan
ford has major holdings, has been selling munitions
materials to the South African law enforcement
agencies.
Abernethy also points out that "the trustees
should indicate their willingness to initiate and co
sponsor proxy resolutions expressing their con
cerns." Since the 1977 anti-apartheid movement,
the trustees have had the opportunity to indicate
their concern over this issue and to use their influ
ence as shareholders to effect change within the
current system. In spite of this fact. University
President Donald Kennedy admitted at the rally on
April 24 that no such stockholder resolutions had
been sponsored by members of the Board of Trus
tees and that the members were open to criticism
for that reason.
In addition, Abernethy calls for stockholder
resolutions which express concern over the issue.
However, the United Nations has been expressing
its concern for many years; in spite of this fact, vio
lence against South African blacks has only esc
alated. and the white regime has continued to
increase its military involvement in countries bor
dering South Africa.
Two weeks ago, members of the Black Student
Union expressed concern to Kennedy over Stan
ford's involvement in South Africa, and his
response at that time was simply that the University
investment policy was firmly established and not
subject to change. It was only when SOSA called
for total divestment and staged a campus-wide

protest that the University began to listen. As a
result, the issue has now been placed on the agenda
of the May 14-15 meeting of the Board of Trustees.
Clearly, expressions of concern are not effective in
bringing about fundamental change.
Abernethy claims that, "One important conse
quence (of divestment) would be a reduction in the
income available to the growing black trade union
movement." It is important to point out that there
is no question that blacks will not be hurt by U.S.
divestment. It is a fact that there are fewer than
