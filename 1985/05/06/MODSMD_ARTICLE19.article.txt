Hoover response
Thank you for publishing on April
29 my letter regarding the appoint
ment procedures for the director of
the Hoover Institution in accordance
with the 1959 agreement between
the founder and the Stanford Board
of Trustees and subsequent amend
ments. Omitted was the last para
graph: "Prof. Dornbusch and his
colleagues on the Faculty Senate
committee are aware of this proce
dure. Others, however, are not, as
the story indicates."

Oxymoronic piece
Must Jason Matherly sempiter
nally (always) esconce (hide) his
oxymoronic (inconsistent) and
paralogistic (illogical) arguments
behind Buckleyesque longliloquence
(bullshit!)? Matherly's column (The
Daily, May 1) fools no one.
Calling for total divestment is not
engaging in the use of "economic
artillery," nor is it an indication of
hypocrisy. Divestment proponents
advocate the "righting" of im
perialistic wrongs that have cul
minated in the U.S.-supported
apartheid regime in South Africa.
Progressives supporting divestment
call for the withdrawal of the
"economic artillery" so that the guns
of the South African police state now
firing upon the black majority will be
silenced. Forever.
One should not underestimate the
effectiveness of total U.S. divestment
as an important element in the black
South Africans' struggle for libera
tion. Nor should one underestimate
Stanford's crucial leadership role in
the struggle for divestment at home.
Matherly tritely informs us that "we
ought to do 'something.' " We are,
Jason. And divestment, or
"something" like that, is effective.

Event praised
Thanks for a well-written article
on the Alpha Delta Phi/United
Cerebral Palsy Association track and
field meet (The Daily, April 29).
The event was a superb example of
how students can enhance their

educations by bringing the larger
community to Stanford. I'll bet that
the Alpha Delts will remember this
experience long after they've forgot
ten how to solve partial differential
equations.
You quoted me as saying that
Stanford is "probably the most ac
cessible secondary (sic) institution in
the world." Well, we're not there
yet. But as long as we continue to
recognize and support the capabili
ties of all individuals, we have the
potential to become a truly accessi
ble community. No lesson could be
more important.

Gay protest
Friday's protest by gay and lesbian
students from New College of the
Law was inappropriate.
While it is true that the U.S. Su
preme Court has been reluctant to
hear gay rights cases and has refused
often to grant equal rights to gay and
lesbian people, and while these
surely are reasons for protest,
Friday's Moot Court finals at Stan
ford were not the time or the place
for a protest.
Rather than being confronted with
a demonstration against Supreme
Court decisions. Justice White
should be praised for agreeing to
come to Stanford to hear an hour of
argument on a fundamental and
critical gay rights issue. And the
Moot Court Board at the law school
should be applauded for choosing
this important issue for the Moot
Court competition and for inviting
Justice White to hear the case.
Our law school in recent years has
become increasingly aware of and
supportive of gay and lesbian stu
dents and has begun to incorporate
gay and lesbian legal issues into its
curriculum and paracurriculum.
What was called for Friday was a
demonstration of approval for the
law school's efforts, rather than a
protest of the Supreme Court wit
nessed solely by one of its justices —
the one who, by his presence here
Friday, is taking a step in the right
direction.
