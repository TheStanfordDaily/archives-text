TEMPE, Ariz. — The Card
baseball team took the first step on
tne path to the College World Se
ries yesterday with a 15-10 win
over Arizona State. The victory
clinched the 1985 Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division title for
Stanford and assured it a berth in
the NCAA Regional playoffs.
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
was proud of his team, which led
the Six-Pac from wire to wire.
"This team has a lot of heart," he
said. "They've battled all year
long."
They certainly had to battle yes
terday. The Sun Devils tagged Rob
Wassenaar and Lee Plemel for 10
runs and 13 hits, including five
home runs.

Barry Bonds led the ASU attack
with four hits, a homer and three
RBIs. For the weekend. Bonds was
9-for-15 with five homers and 14
RBIs.
"I don't think they threw badly,"
Bonds said. "Sometimes you hit
well, sometimes you don't."
Mark Davis got Stanford off to a
2-0 lead in the first with his 12th
homer of the year — a 475-foot
shot to left field off ASU starter
Jeff Roberts.
Bonds' RBI single cut the lead in
half, but Stanford went ahead 3-1
in the second on John Verducci's
sacrifice fly. Then, in the third, the
Cardinal broke the game open.
After Ruben Amaro reached on
an error and Davis walked, Rick
Lundblade ripped a line drive over
the fence in left-center for his 2()th

roundtripper of the season.
Later in the inning, John Ramos
drove Jeff Ballard across with a
single off ASU reliever Charles
Scott, making the score 7-1.
In the fourth, Walt Harris came
up with the bases loaded and two
out. Scott had struck out Harris in
the previous inning, but the Card
inal leftfielder was ready this time,
lining a two-run single to right
center.
"I got on myself to settle down,"
Harris said. "1 just waited for a
pitch I could hit."
A two-run homer by Rick Morris
brought the Sun Devils to within
five, but Stanford extended its lead
to 12-4 in the seventh. An RBI
single by Harris chased Scott, and
