TEMPE, Ariz. — The Card
baseball team took the first step on
tne path to the College World Se
ries yesterday with a 15-10 win
over Arizona State. The victory
clinched the 1985 Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division title for
Stanford and assured it a berth in
the NCAA Regional playoffs.
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
was proud of his team, which led
the Six-Pac from wire to wire.
"This team has a lot of heart," he
said. "They've battled all year
long."
They certainly had to battle yes
terday. The Sun Devils tagged Rob
Wassenaar and Lee Plemel for 10
runs and 13 hits, including five
home runs.

Barry Bonds led the ASU attack
with four hits, a homer and three
RBIs. For the weekend. Bonds was
9-for-15 with five homers and 14
RBIs.
"I don't think they threw badly,"
Bonds said. "Sometimes you hit
well, sometimes you don't."
Mark Davis got Stanford off to a
2-0 lead in the first with his 12th
homer of the year — a 475-foot
shot to left field off ASU starter
Jeff Roberts.
Bonds' RBI single cut the lead in
half, but Stanford went ahead 3-1
in the second on John Verducci's
sacrifice fly. Then, in the third, the
Cardinal broke the game open.
After Ruben Amaro reached on
an error and Davis walked, Rick
Lundblade ripped a line drive over
the fence in left-center for his 2()th

roundtripper of the season.
Later in the inning, John Ramos
drove Jeff Ballard across with a
single off ASU reliever Charles
Scott, making the score 7-1.
In the fourth, Walt Harris came
up with the bases loaded and two
out. Scott had struck out Harris in
the previous inning, but the Card
inal leftfielder was ready this time,
lining a two-run single to right
center.
"I got on myself to settle down,"
Harris said. "1 just waited for a
pitch I could hit."
A two-run homer by Rick Morris
brought the Sun Devils to within
five, but Stanford extended its lead
to 12-4 in the seventh. An RBI
single by Harris chased Scott, and

Pete Stanicek and his Stanford teammates slid into the NCAA Regional playoffs yesterday with a 15-10
victory over Arizona State in Tempe.
reliever Randy Rector was unable to
hold the Cardinal, surrendering con
secutive RBI doubles to Toi Cook
and Ramos.
The game seemed well in hand, but
ASU wasn't through yet. After Bonds
reached Wassenaar for a two-run
homer, Louie Medina followed with a
longball of his own. Todd Brown
popped out, but Morris slammed his
second homer of the day, cutting
Stanford's lead to 12-8 and driving
Wassenaar out in favor of Lee
Plemel.

George Lopez jumped all over
Plemel's first delivery, sending it over
the left-field fence for the Sun Devils'
fourth homer of the inning.
"That's A-State for you — they
keep pounding," Stanicek said.
"They can really hit."
With the middle of the Sun Devils'
order due for another turn in the
ninth, the Cardinal needed some as
surance. "We knew if we got some
runs, it would take the air out of their
sails," Cook said. They did, and it
did.
On the first pitch of the inning,
Lundblade took a Mike Thorpe pitch

the other way, slicing an opposite
field homer to right. It was the 38th
blast of Lundblade's career, making
him Stanford's all-time home run
king.
Ramos drove in another run with a
triple and was singled in by Verducci,
giving Plemel a nice six-run cushion.
"That was big," Marquess said of
the three-run inning. "It really broke
their backs."
"We needed the runs to show them
we weren't done — that no matter
what they did, they couldn't catch
us," Harris said.
Davis was never worried. "We
knew Lundy was going to hit a home
run,"he said.
Because both California and
Arizona lost yesterday, Stanford
didn't have to win to take the title.
But it was important for the Cardinal
to wrap it up as a winner.
"We didn't want to back into it,"
Ramos said.
"We wanted to rely on ourselves,"
Harris said. "That's real important
going into the playoffs later."
Spoiling Stanford's victory party
would have been a bright spot in a
dark season for ASU. "With the year
we've had, it would have been good,"
Bonds said. "But everybody gave it
their best, and that's all you can ask."
Lundblade summed up the team's
attitude about clinching the pennant.
"More relieved than excited," he
said. "It'll sink in at about 37,000 feet
tonight."
Stanford would have been happy
for it to sink in while still on the
ground on Saturday, but Bonds was
determined to make the Cardinal
wait at least another day.
The Sun Devils' center fielder
wiped out a 1-0 Cardinal lead in the
third with a three-run homer to right
off Cardinal starter Jack McDowell.
Stanford rallied for three runs in
the next inning to take a 4-3 lead, but
ASU went back ahead with three of
its own in the sixth.
After Medina gave the Sun Devils
an 8-5 lead with a wind-blown homer
to center in the seventh, the Cardinal

stormed back to tie the game in the
eighth.
RBI singles by Stanicek and
Amaro brought Scott on for Royal
Clayton. Davis drove in a run with a
fielder's choice, but Scott got
Lundblade on a pop-up to end the in
ning.
With two outs and nobody on, it
looked like McDowell would have an
easy eighth. But he gave up a single to
Don Wakamatsu and a walk to Bob
Dombrowski, bringing Rick Dietz in
from the Cardinal bullpen.
After walking the dangerous Mike
Devereaux to load the bases, Dietz
also walked the not-so-dangerous
Keith Bennett to force in the go
ahead run.
Dietz finally found the strike zone
with the next hitter, but unfortunately
that hitter was Bonds. On an 0-1
pitch. Bonds lined a grand slam well
Tover the fence in left-center. The
score was 13-8, and the celebration
was postponed for a day.
"He hit all kinds of pitches,"
Marquess said of Bonds. "He's a
great player, and he was hot."
On Friday, Stanford was hot,
scoring in double figures for the fifth
consecutive time. The Cardinal
pounded four ASU pitchers for 13
hits en route to a 15-8 win.
The beneficiary of Stanford's of
fensive production was Ballard. He
gave up 15 hits, including two home
runs to Bonds, but he struck out
seven and walked none. For the
eighth time this year, he went the dis
tance, picking up his 10th win against
two losses.
Davis and Bonds exchanged two
run homers in the early innings, but
they weren't what one could call
similar. Davis' shot was a high fly ball
to right that got some help from a
strong wind. Bonds' blast needed no
assistance, as it rocketed over the
scoreboard in left-center.
Bonds' second homer of the night
put ASU ahead 3-2 in the third, but
his wind-blown drive to right bore no
resemblance to his earlier homer. "It
was a good pitch — a slider down and

in," Ballard said. "But he just flicked
at it and got the barrel on it."
The top of the fourth was a
microcosm of 1985 for both ASU and
Stanford. The Sun Devils made a
mistake defensively, their pitchers
couldn't recover, and the Cardinal
capitalized.
With one out and runners at the
corners, Amaro hit what looked to be
an inning-ending double-play ball to
short — until Bennett let it get by him
for an error.
After Davis walked, Stanicek
scored on a wild pitch. Then
Lundblade drove in two runs with a
single to center. Harris' single
knocked in the fifth run of the inning,

making the score 7-3. ASU never got
closer than three the rest of the way.
With the score 9-5, the Cardinal
put the game away with five runs in
the eighth. After Harris and Cook
stroked RBI singles, Ramos drove
them both home with his eighth
roundtripper of the year.
Ballard did give up seven earned
runs and 15 hits, hut four of the runs
and nine of the hits came in the last
three innings, when the issue had
been decided.
"That was the first complete game
against A-State in my life," Ballard
said. "I got the big outs and didn't
give them the big inning. It's disap
pointing to give up eight runs, but I'm
happy we won."

Starter Rob Wassenaar didn't pitch badly yesterday, but the wind and the deadly ASU bats combined to
produce 11 hits and eight runs in the 7 Va innings he was on the mound. Wassenaar ended up being credited
with his eighth win of the season.
