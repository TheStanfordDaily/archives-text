# Open letter to the Stanford community:

### 
Friends:
In a meeting on Thursday, April 25, with representa
tives of the students gathered outside Building 10,1 prom
ised to give an account of my views about divestment as a
means of relieving the conditions of oppression and injus
tice that prevail for blacks in South Africa.
Let me begin by stating some objectives I believe almost
all of us share. South Africa today represents an especially
repugnant form of institutionalized racial injustice — spe
cial because of the degree to which a small minority en
gages in restraints upon human freedom and violations of
basic human rights.
Our ultimate objective for the people of South Africa
ought to be the firm establishment of democratic majority
rule; and in the near term, we should seekevery opportun
ity to ameliorate oppression by the South African govern
ment and to relieve the restrictions now placed on the
rights of black South Africans.
That analysis and those goals have been with us for some
time, but conditions in South Africa are improving margi
nally if at all. Indeed, after signs that many observers found
encouraging a year or two ago, the Pretoria government
has appeared to congeal in its implacability.
In the meantime, the U.S. policy of constructive engage
ment has seemed barren of constructive influence. The re
sult has been a national wave of protest here in the United
States—initially against an apparently ineffectual govern
ment policy, but eventually against private policies of in
vestment and trade as well.
When sincere and energetic compassion of the kind dis
played here at Stanford is dammed up by government in
difference, that concern inevitably seeks other channels. It
is therefore not surprising that an intense focus upon di
vestment as a strategy for ending apartheid has arisen here
and elsewhere.
Proper strategy
We are nevertheless obliged to ask whether that is the
proper strategy. I am troubled that rational discourse ab
out that question seems to have become a victim of moral
urgency.
For many people with whom I have talked over the past
few days, the matter seems closed: as in the San Francisco
Chronicle headlines, "foe of apartheid" has become synony
mous with "advocate of divestment." Our tradition here is
for a thoughtful examination of all possible views, and I
think we will fail to live up to that tradition if one view of a
complex subject can be dismissed out of hand as morally
inferior — as in the simple portrayal of our choice as one
between "money and morality."
There certainly is a moral issue here: it is the practice of
apartheid and the goal of ending that practice. Full or par
tial divestment are policies that may or may not lead us to
ward that goal. To transfer moral standing from the goal to
the process is, it seems to me, wrong.
By avoiding that, I hope we can also avoid stigmatizing
one another, and so retain the respect and decency that so
characterize this community —even when it is in disagree
ment about matters as complex and as deeply disturbing as
this one.
Now let me turn to the policy of total divestment. Surely
the central moral question having to do with divestment is
its efficacy as a policy. The most legitimate aim of divest
ment would be to help accomplish the goal of improving
conditions for blacks in South Africa.
Only if it can help to secure such progress, and only if it is
fairly certain not to bring about the reverse effect, is divest
ment a moral act with substance. To divest without having
any such positive effect may "make a statement," but in the
absence of any improvement that statement is an empty
one.
We might end by feeling better; but will we have made a
difference? Will we have foregone the very slim chance we
have as a minor stockholder to affect the policies and ac
tions of the business community? Are we ready to ex
change a policy of selective divestment that might make a
slight difference for one of total divestment that is likely to
make even less?
Tests of effectiveness
To judge divestment as effective, I think we would need
to be convinced of two things. First, it would have to be
shown that its ultimate objective — the withdrawal of U.S.
and of other foreign investment from South Africa —
would improve the conditions for black South Africans.
And second, we would need to be satisfied that institu
tional divestment here in the United States would actually
make that withdrawal more probable.
As to the first question, opinion is divided even among
those deeply committed to the ending of apartheid in
South Africa. Some believe that corporations owned by the
United States are among the more progressive employers
in that country, that those corporations have set useful ex
amples for worker training and educational assistance (as
in IBM's recent commitment to spend $10 million on prog
rams in black elementary schools), and that their pressure
on the government, individually and through organiza
tions like the American Chamber of Commerce in South
Africa, provides a positive influence.
Opponents of U.S. investment point to it as a precedent
for other foreign investment, and cite the lack of progress
on wages of black workers and on the freedom of worker
movement as evidence that constructive action is unlikely.
They argue that since U.S. firms employ approximately
120,000 black workers, which is a very small percentage of

the total black work force in South Africa, their influence
upon employment practices and the general lot of blacks is
limited anyhow, and that by their presence they provide
technological and political support to the Pretoria govern
ment.
A similar difference of opinion exists with respect to the
withdrawal of all foreign interests: would it lead to a des
tabilization of the present government and a relaxation of
oppression, or merely the replacement of those interests by
South African ones, or perhaps even to massive hardship
and unemployment of blacks, accompanied by little or no
political improvement?
I believe that such wide differences of opinion exist be
cause it is inherently very difficult to predict the behavior of
large economic and political systems under stress.
Outcome uncertain
Even those most intimate with South Africa cannot agree
as to the most likely outcome; and how, then, can we attach
great certainty to our own views? One thing does seem like
ly to me, and that is that the withdrawal of American firms
from South Africa would likely result in their short-term
replacement by interests representing the other major
partner economies.
The European Economic Community, for example,
presently has about four times the level of economic activ
ity in South Africa as has the United States. An economic
niche vacated by us would be easily filled from that source;
and in general, concern for investment responsibility
issues has been notably lower in Europe than it has in the
United States.
I am thus left with grave doubt about whether the with
drawal of U.S. investment from South Africa would lead to
the secondary withdrawal of all other foreign investment
from that country; and I am in equal doubt as to whether
the second event, if it occurred, would be beneficial.
Nevertheless, there remains a prior question: whatever
one thinks of the desirability of withdrawing U.S. invest
ment from South Africa, would institutional divestment by
nonprofit organizations in the United States — like Stan
ford, or the University of California, or the Massachusetts
Employees Pension Fund — be likely to bring about that
result? I am quite firmly convinced that it would not.
Divested securities will be purchased by larger numbers
of holders, many of them individual, who have less influ
ence to exert and (on the average) less interest in exerting it.
There may be some transient adverse publicity following
the active divestment by a major institutional holder; but
past experience shows that those effects disappear quickly,
leaving a corporate management less inclined to positive
action. W
Thus I believe that divestment is extremely unlikely to
have beneficial effects upon the circumstances we all de
plore.
I am not alone in reaching this conclusion. The most
careful U.S. study of this question known to me — by the
1981 Study Commission on U.S. Policy Toward South
Africa, chaired by President Franklin Thomas of the Ford
Foundation — did not recommend withdrawal of U.S in
vestment. Other universities have been re-examining the
question in more recent times, and the great majority of
them have concluded that they should retain policies much
like the ones now in place at Stanford.
In that connection, I should emphasize that the argu
ments against a broadly applied strategy of divestment do
not apply to the policy of selective divestment employed as a
last resort — the present policy of the Stanford Board of
Trustees.
I believe that responsible urgings and proxy votes by in
stitutional investors sometimes do influence corporate be
havior; and because I believe that, I think we need a way to
signal that sincere efforts to change a practice that pro
duces substantial social injury have failed. Thus I said to the
Board, at the time of its February meeting on the Motorola
recommendation:
"However ineffectual divestiture may be in itself, it re
tains some value as a reinforcing action—a final statement
that, all other importunings having been unavailing, the
investor has withdrawn for lack of any other alternative.
"Such a statement, incidentally, retains its force only if
divestiture is truly a course of last resort; it will quickly lose
that force if it becomes a broadly applied 'formula' re
sponse. Powerful statements of principle, in any context,
preserve their power only through careful husbandry."
As an institution committed to rational inquiry, and as an
investor concerned with social responsibility, Stanford
should continue to examine allegations of substantial so
cial injury on a case-by-case basis, not only on South Africa
but on other issues. The Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility, an advisory group of students, faculty, staff
and alumni, provides a well established mechanism for that
purpose, and its resources have recently been modestly ex
panded. By staying involved, raising questions and sug
gesting change, we may over time have modestly greater
influence over the future course of events than by simply
severing our ties automatically, across the board or by for
mula.
Impact on Stanford
A final word is necessary on the subject of divestment.
We are also required to consider the effects of such a policy
on Stanford, because the Trustees are legally responsible
for preserving the institutional assets they hold in public
trust. The law holds in general that there is both a duty of
loyalty to the stated purposes of the trust and a duty of pru
dence in investment.
Similar duties apply to Regents, or other governing offi
cials of public universities, although the specific legal situa
tion may be somewhat different. This question was public
ly considered at the time the Regents were first asked to
consider divestment, and will no doubt arise again.
The legal questions are very serious ones, which would
have to be considered carefully by our Trustees if they be
came convinced that total divestment was the right course
to pursue in the interest of black South Africans. (A deci
sion to divest by the Regents would not necessarily mean
that the same course was legally open to Stanford's Trus
tees, since the legal requirements placed upon public offi
cials and upon Trustees may not be identical.)

Finally, I would like to turn to other ways in which we at
Stanford can contribute usefully to the ending of apar
theid. At my meeting with the officers of the Black Student
Union on April 18,1 was asked to demonstrate some lead
ership with respect to alternatives. It was put to me that
since I did not favor blanket divestment as a policy to pur
sue the goal of ending apartheid, I should suggest other
means toward the same ends. That was, and is, an entirely
reasonable request.
I continue to believe that the legislative arena is the best
one in which to pursue our goals. A number of bills have
already been introduced in Congress, and more will no
doubt follow. Senate Bill S-635, introduced by Senators
Ted Kennedy and Lowell Weicker, contains a number of
provisions that I think will take us in the right direction.
It provides for a series of trade sanctions against the gov
ernment of South Africa that are designed not to throw
non-whites out of work.
At the same time, it offers significant improvement in
centives: the sanctions may be waved if there is demonstr
able progress in such areas as the ending of removals, pro
visions for the fre&movement of labor, elimination of poli
cies that make distinctions between the South African
nationality of blacks and whites, and several others.
It is not a perfect bill, but I think it can be improved by
amendment, and I support its main provisions. Senator
Kennedy has asked me for comments, and I will be provid
ing them. Among the features I intend to work for is an
extension of the embargo on materials or technologies
used in support of apartheid so that it will cover adequately
foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies.
We will also undertake, in Stanford's Office of Govern
ment Relations, legislative analyses of this and other signi
ficant pending bills. These analyses can be made available
to students and faculty members who want to use them,
and I am prepared to consider other ways in which we can
help to develop or support legislative approaches to the
ending of apartheid.
Consortium effort
Stanford has recently joined a consortium of 16 colleges
and universities formed last fall at the initiative of Wes
leyan University . This group earlier wrote to the American
Chamber of Commerce in South Africa, arguing for more
effective actions against apartheid by American firms
doing business in that country.
The chamber responded to these urgings, which we en
dorse. On March 7, AMCHAM submitted a series of re
commendations to the South African government,
through the Minister of Constitutional Development and
Planning.
These proposals called for an end to influx controls, for
free-hold property rights for all blacks, for an end to re
movals, and for citizenship and extension of the franchise
— among other things.
It represented the first time the chamber had put public
pressure on the Pretoria regime on behalf of ending apar
theid. This development, however modest, is encourag
ing. It suggests that consortia can be effective in increasing
the pressure for change, and it may lead to consideration of
more specific timetables, reinforced by effective sanctions.
It isin this latterarea, I think, that our best eventual hope
lies. Economic incentives, both positive and negative, are
among the most promising means by which the United
States can hope to change the situation in South Africa.
The best way to develop such incentives is through leg
islative action; separate foreign policies for Stanford, the
University of California, and the pensioners of the Com
monwealth of Massachusetts will not get us very far.
Consortia of companies and investing institutions,
acting together, might not only encourage legislation, but
also muster enough economic force to encourage positive
change themselves.
Bishop Tutu has said that unless the system is being dis
mantled within two years, he will urge foreign companies
to leave. I believe that timetable is fair and reasonable, and
that it can be made a rallying point for those who wish to use
economic influence constructively rather than discard it.

Only if it can help to secure such progress, and only if it is
fairly certain not to bring about the reverse effect, is divest
ment a moral act with substance. To divest without having
any such positive effect may "make a statement," but in the
absence of any improvement that statement is an empty
one.
We might end by feeling better; but will we have made a
difference? Will we have foregone the very slim chance we
have as a minor stockholder to affect the policies and ac
tions of the business community? Are we ready to ex
change a policy of selective divestment that might make a
slight difference for one of total divestment that is likely to
make even less?
Tests of effectiveness
To judge divestment as effective, I think we would need
to be convinced of two things. First, it would have to be
shown that its ultimate objective — the withdrawal of U.S.
and of other foreign investment from South Africa —
would improve the conditions for black South Africans.
And second, we would need to be satisfied that institu
tional divestment here in the United States would actually
make that withdrawal more probable.
As to the first question, opinion is divided even among
those deeply committed to the ending of apartheid in
South Africa. Some believe that corporations owned by the
United States are among the more progressive employers
in that country, that those corporations have set useful ex
amples for worker training and educational assistance (as
in IBM's recent commitment to spend $10 million on prog
rams in black elementary schools), and that their pressure
on the government, individually and through organiza
tions like the American Chamber of Commerce in South
Africa, provides a positive influence.
Opponents of U.S. investment point to it as a precedent
for other foreign investment, and cite the lack of progress
on wages of black workers and on the freedom of worker
movement as evidence that constructive action is unlikely.
They argue that since U.S. firms employ approximately
120,000 black workers, which is a very small percentage of

the total black work force in South Africa, their influence
upon employment practices and the general lot of blacks is
limited anyhow, and that by their presence they provide
technological and political support to the Pretoria govern
ment.
A similar difference of opinion exists with respect to the
withdrawal of all foreign interests: would it lead to a des
tabilization of the present government and a relaxation of
oppression, or merely the replacement of those interests by
South African ones, or perhaps even to massive hardship
and unemployment of blacks, accompanied by little or no
political improvement?
I believe that such wide differences of opinion exist be
cause it is inherently very difficult to predict the behavior of
large economic and political systems under stress.
Outcome uncertain
Even those most intimate with South Africa cannot agree
as to the most likely outcome; and how, then, can we attach
great certainty to our own views? One thing does seem like
ly to me, and that is that the withdrawal of American firms
from South Africa would likely result in their short-term
replacement by interests representing the other major
partner economies.
The European Economic Community, for example,
presently has about four times the level of economic activ
ity in South Africa as has the United States. An economic
niche vacated by us would be easily filled from that source;
and in general, concern for investment responsibility
issues has been notably lower in Europe than it has in the
United States.
I am thus left with grave doubt about whether the with
drawal of U.S. investment from South Africa would lead to
the secondary withdrawal of all other foreign investment
from that country; and I am in equal doubt as to whether
the second event, if it occurred, would be beneficial.
Nevertheless, there remains a prior question: whatever
one thinks of the desirability of withdrawing U.S. invest
ment from South Africa, would institutional divestment by
nonprofit organizations in the United States — like Stan
ford, or the University of California, or the Massachusetts
Employees Pension Fund — be likely to bring about that
result? I am quite firmly convinced that it would not.
Divested securities will be purchased by larger numbers
of holders, many of them individual, who have less influ
ence to exert and (on the average) less interest in exerting it.
There may be some transient adverse publicity following
the active divestment by a major institutional holder; but
past experience shows that those effects disappear quickly,
leaving a corporate management less inclined to positive
action. W
Thus I believe that divestment is extremely unlikely to
have beneficial effects upon the circumstances we all de
plore.
I am not alone in reaching this conclusion. The most
careful U.S. study of this question known to me — by the
1981 Study Commission on U.S. Policy Toward South
Africa, chaired by President Franklin Thomas of the Ford
Foundation — did not recommend withdrawal of U.S in
vestment. Other universities have been re-examining the
question in more recent times, and the great majority of
them have concluded that they should retain policies much
like the ones now in place at Stanford.
In that connection, I should emphasize that the argu
ments against a broadly applied strategy of divestment do
not apply to the policy of selective divestment employed as a
last resort — the present policy of the Stanford Board of
Trustees.
I believe that responsible urgings and proxy votes by in
stitutional investors sometimes do influence corporate be
havior; and because I believe that, I think we need a way to
signal that sincere efforts to change a practice that pro
duces substantial social injury have failed. Thus I said to the
Board, at the time of its February meeting on the Motorola
recommendation:
"However ineffectual divestiture may be in itself, it re
tains some value as a reinforcing action—a final statement
that, all other importunings having been unavailing, the
investor has withdrawn for lack of any other alternative.
"Such a statement, incidentally, retains its force only if
divestiture is truly a course of last resort; it will quickly lose
that force if it becomes a broadly applied 'formula' re
sponse. Powerful statements of principle, in any context,
preserve their power only through careful husbandry."
As an institution committed to rational inquiry, and as an
investor concerned with social responsibility, Stanford
should continue to examine allegations of substantial so
cial injury on a case-by-case basis, not only on South Africa
but on other issues. The Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility, an advisory group of students, faculty, staff
and alumni, provides a well established mechanism for that
purpose, and its resources have recently been modestly ex
panded. By staying involved, raising questions and sug
gesting change, we may over time have modestly greater
influence over the future course of events than by simply
severing our ties automatically, across the board or by for
mula.
Impact on Stanford
A final word is necessary on the subject of divestment.
We are also required to consider the effects of such a policy
on Stanford, because the Trustees are legally responsible
for preserving the institutional assets they hold in public
trust. The law holds in general that there is both a duty of
loyalty to the stated purposes of the trust and a duty of pru
dence in investment.
Similar duties apply to Regents, or other governing offi
cials of public universities, although the specific legal situa
tion may be somewhat different. This question was public
ly considered at the time the Regents were first asked to
consider divestment, and will no doubt arise again.
The legal questions are very serious ones, which would
have to be considered carefully by our Trustees if they be
came convinced that total divestment was the right course
to pursue in the interest of black South Africans. (A deci
sion to divest by the Regents would not necessarily mean
that the same course was legally open to Stanford's Trus
tees, since the legal requirements placed upon public offi
cials and upon Trustees may not be identical.)

Finally, I would like to turn to other ways in which we at
Stanford can contribute usefully to the ending of apar
theid. At my meeting with the officers of the Black Student
Union on April 18,1 was asked to demonstrate some lead
ership with respect to alternatives. It was put to me that
since I did not favor blanket divestment as a policy to pur
sue the goal of ending apartheid, I should suggest other
means toward the same ends. That was, and is, an entirely
reasonable request.
I continue to believe that the legislative arena is the best
one in which to pursue our goals. A number of bills have
already been introduced in Congress, and more will no
doubt follow. Senate Bill S-635, introduced by Senators
Ted Kennedy and Lowell Weicker, contains a number of
provisions that I think will take us in the right direction.
It provides for a series of trade sanctions against the gov
ernment of South Africa that are designed not to throw
non-whites out of work.
At the same time, it offers significant improvement in
centives: the sanctions may be waved if there is demonstr
able progress in such areas as the ending of removals, pro
visions for the fre&movement of labor, elimination of poli
cies that make distinctions between the South African
nationality of blacks and whites, and several others.
It is not a perfect bill, but I think it can be improved by
amendment, and I support its main provisions. Senator
Kennedy has asked me for comments, and I will be provid
ing them. Among the features I intend to work for is an
extension of the embargo on materials or technologies
used in support of apartheid so that it will cover adequately
foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies.
We will also undertake, in Stanford's Office of Govern
ment Relations, legislative analyses of this and other signi
ficant pending bills. These analyses can be made available
to students and faculty members who want to use them,
and I am prepared to consider other ways in which we can
help to develop or support legislative approaches to the
ending of apartheid.
Consortium effort
Stanford has recently joined a consortium of 16 colleges
and universities formed last fall at the initiative of Wes
leyan University . This group earlier wrote to the American
Chamber of Commerce in South Africa, arguing for more
effective actions against apartheid by American firms
doing business in that country.
The chamber responded to these urgings, which we en
dorse. On March 7, AMCHAM submitted a series of re
commendations to the South African government,
through the Minister of Constitutional Development and
Planning.
These proposals called for an end to influx controls, for
free-hold property rights for all blacks, for an end to re
movals, and for citizenship and extension of the franchise
— among other things.
It represented the first time the chamber had put public
pressure on the Pretoria regime on behalf of ending apar
theid. This development, however modest, is encourag
ing. It suggests that consortia can be effective in increasing
the pressure for change, and it may lead to consideration of
more specific timetables, reinforced by effective sanctions.
It isin this latterarea, I think, that our best eventual hope
lies. Economic incentives, both positive and negative, are
among the most promising means by which the United
States can hope to change the situation in South Africa.
The best way to develop such incentives is through leg
islative action; separate foreign policies for Stanford, the
University of California, and the pensioners of the Com
monwealth of Massachusetts will not get us very far.
Consortia of companies and investing institutions,
acting together, might not only encourage legislation, but
also muster enough economic force to encourage positive
change themselves.
Bishop Tutu has said that unless the system is being dis
mantled within two years, he will urge foreign companies
to leave. I believe that timetable is fair and reasonable, and
that it can be made a rallying point for those who wish to use
economic influence constructively rather than discard it.

Public Forum to
Discuss Divestment
Date: Tuesday, May 7, 1985
Time: 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.
Place: The Quad
Everyone is invited and encouraged to attend this forum.

Friends:
In a meeting on Thursday, April 25, with representa
tives of the students gathered outside Building 10,1 prom
ised to give an account of my views about divestment as a
means of relieving the conditions of oppression and injus
tice that prevail for blacks in South Africa.
Let me begin by stating some objectives I believe almost
all of us share. South Africa today represents an especially
repugnant form of institutionalized racial injustice — spe
cial because of the degree to which a small minority en
gages in restraints upon human freedom and violations of
basic human rights.
Our ultimate objective for the people of South Africa
ought to be the firm establishment of democratic majority
rule; and in the near term, we should seekevery opportun
ity to ameliorate oppression by the South African govern
ment and to relieve the restrictions now placed on the
rights of black South Africans.
That analysis and those goals have been with us for some
time, but conditions in South Africa are improving margi
nally if at all. Indeed, after signs that many observers found
encouraging a year or two ago, the Pretoria government
has appeared to congeal in its implacability.
In the meantime, the U.S. policy of constructive engage
ment has seemed barren of constructive influence. The re
sult has been a national wave of protest here in the United
States—initially against an apparently ineffectual govern
ment policy, but eventually against private policies of in
vestment and trade as well.
When sincere and energetic compassion of the kind dis
played here at Stanford is dammed up by government in
difference, that concern inevitably seeks other channels. It
is therefore not surprising that an intense focus upon di
vestment as a strategy for ending apartheid has arisen here
and elsewhere.
Proper strategy
We are nevertheless obliged to ask whether that is the
proper strategy. I am troubled that rational discourse ab
out that question seems to have become a victim of moral
urgency.
For many people with whom I have talked over the past
few days, the matter seems closed: as in the San Francisco
Chronicle headlines, "foe of apartheid" has become synony
mous with "advocate of divestment." Our tradition here is
for a thoughtful examination of all possible views, and I
think we will fail to live up to that tradition if one view of a
complex subject can be dismissed out of hand as morally
inferior — as in the simple portrayal of our choice as one
between "money and morality."
There certainly is a moral issue here: it is the practice of
apartheid and the goal of ending that practice. Full or par
tial divestment are policies that may or may not lead us to
ward that goal. To transfer moral standing from the goal to
the process is, it seems to me, wrong.
By avoiding that, I hope we can also avoid stigmatizing
one another, and so retain the respect and decency that so
characterize this community —even when it is in disagree
ment about matters as complex and as deeply disturbing as
this one.
Now let me turn to the policy of total divestment. Surely
the central moral question having to do with divestment is
its efficacy as a policy. The most legitimate aim of divest
ment would be to help accomplish the goal of improving
conditions for blacks in South Africa.
Only if it can help to secure such progress, and only if it is
fairly certain not to bring about the reverse effect, is divest
ment a moral act with substance. To divest without having
any such positive effect may "make a statement," but in the
absence of any improvement that statement is an empty

have as a minor stockholder to affect the policies and ac

make even less?

and in general, concern for investment responsibility
issues has been notably lower in Europe than it has in the
United States.
I am thus left with grave doubt about whether the with
drawal of U.S. investment from South Africa would lead to
the secondary withdrawal of all other foreign investment
from that country; and I am in equal doubt as to whether
the second event, if it occurred, would be beneficial.
Nevertheless, there remains a prior question: whatever
one thinks of the desirability of withdrawing U.S. invest
ment from South Africa, would institutional divestment by
nonprofit organizations in the United States — like Stan
ford, or the University of California, or the Massachusetts
Employees Pension Fund — be likely to bring about that
result? I am quite firmly convinced that it would not.
Divested securities will be purchased by larger numbers
of holders, many of them individual, who have less influ
ence to exert and (on the average) less interest in exerting it.
There may be some transient adverse publicity following
the active divestment by a major institutional holder; but
past experience shows that those effects disappear quickly,
leaving a corporate management less inclined to positive
action. W
Thus I believe that divestment is extremely unlikely to
have beneficial effects upon the circumstances we all de
plore.
I am not alone in reaching this conclusion. The most
careful U.S. study of this question known to me — by the
1981 Study Commission on U.S. Policy Toward South
Africa, chaired by President Franklin Thomas of the Ford
Foundation — did not recommend withdrawal of U.S in
vestment. Other universities have been re-examining the
question in more recent times, and the great majority of
them have concluded that they should retain policies much
like the ones now in place at Stanford.
In that connection, I should emphasize that the argu
ments against a broadly applied strategy of divestment do
not apply to the policy of selective divestment employed as a
last resort — the present policy of the Stanford Board of
Trustees.
I believe that responsible urgings and proxy votes by in
stitutional investors sometimes do influence corporate be
havior; and because I believe that, I think we need a way to
signal that sincere efforts to change a practice that pro
duces substantial social injury have failed. Thus I said to the
Board, at the time of its February meeting on the Motorola
recommendation:
"However ineffectual divestiture may be in itself, it re
tains some value as a reinforcing action—a final statement
that, all other importunings having been unavailing, the
investor has withdrawn for lack of any other alternative.
"Such a statement, incidentally, retains its force only if
divestiture is truly a course of last resort; it will quickly lose
that force if it becomes a broadly applied 'formula' re
sponse. Powerful statements of principle, in any context,
preserve their power only through careful husbandry."
As an institution committed to rational inquiry, and as an
investor concerned with social responsibility, Stanford
should continue to examine allegations of substantial so
cial injury on a case-by-case basis, not only on South Africa
but on other issues. The Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility, an advisory group of students, faculty, staff
and alumni, provides a well established mechanism for that
purpose, and its resources have recently been modestly ex
panded. By staying involved, raising questions and sug
gesting change, we may over time have modestly greater
influence over the future course of events than by simply
severing our ties automatically, across the board or by for
mula.
Impact on Stanford
A final word is necessary on the subject of divestment.
We are also required to consider the effects of such a policy
on Stanford, because the Trustees are legally responsible
for preserving the institutional assets they hold in public
trust. The law holds in general that there is both a duty of
loyalty to the stated purposes of the trust and a duty of pru
dence in investment.
Similar duties apply to Regents, or other governing offi
cials of public universities, although the specific legal situa
tion may be somewhat different. This question was public
ly considered at the time the Regents were first asked to
consider divestment, and will no doubt arise again.
The legal questions are very serious ones, which would
have to be considered carefully by our Trustees if they be
came convinced that total divestment was the right course
to pursue in the interest of black South Africans. (A deci
sion to divest by the Regents would not necessarily mean
that the same course was legally open to Stanford's Trus
tees, since the legal requirements placed upon public offi
cials and upon Trustees may not be identical.)

Finally, I would like to turn to other ways in which we at
Stanford can contribute usefully to the ending of apar
theid. At my meeting with the officers of the Black Student
Union on April 18,1 was asked to demonstrate some lead
ership with respect to alternatives. It was put to me that
since I did not favor blanket divestment as a policy to pur
sue the goal of ending apartheid, I should suggest other
means toward the same ends. That was, and is, an entirely
reasonable request.
I continue to believe that the legislative arena is the best
one in which to pursue our goals. A number of bills have
already been introduced in Congress, and more will no
doubt follow. Senate Bill S-635, introduced by Senators
Ted Kennedy and Lowell Weicker, contains a number of
provisions that I think will take us in the right direction.
It provides for a series of trade sanctions against the gov
ernment of South Africa that are designed not to throw
non-whites out of work.
At the same time, it offers significant improvement in
centives: the sanctions may be waved if there is demonstr
able progress in such areas as the ending of removals, pro
visions for the fre&movement of labor, elimination of poli
cies that make distinctions between the South African
nationality of blacks and whites, and several others.
It is not a perfect bill, but I think it can be improved by
amendment, and I support its main provisions. Senator
Kennedy has asked me for comments, and I will be provid
ing them. Among the features I intend to work for is an
extension of the embargo on materials or technologies
used in support of apartheid so that it will cover adequately
foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies.
We will also undertake, in Stanford's Office of Govern
ment Relations, legislative analyses of this and other signi
ficant pending bills. These analyses can be made available
to students and faculty members who want to use them,
and I am prepared to consider other ways in which we can
help to develop or support legislative approaches to the
ending of apartheid.
Consortium effort
Stanford has recently joined a consortium of 16 colleges
and universities formed last fall at the initiative of Wes
leyan University . This group earlier wrote to the American
Chamber of Commerce in South Africa, arguing for more
effective actions against apartheid by American firms
doing business in that country.
The chamber responded to these urgings, which we en
dorse. On March 7, AMCHAM submitted a series of re
commendations to the South African government,
through the Minister of Constitutional Development and
Planning.
These proposals called for an end to influx controls, for
free-hold property rights for all blacks, for an end to re
movals, and for citizenship and extension of the franchise
— among other things.
It represented the first time the chamber had put public
pressure on the Pretoria regime on behalf of ending apar
theid. This development, however modest, is encourag
ing. It suggests that consortia can be effective in increasing
the pressure for change, and it may lead to consideration of
more specific timetables, reinforced by effective sanctions.
It isin this latterarea, I think, that our best eventual hope
lies. Economic incentives, both positive and negative, are
among the most promising means by which the United
States can hope to change the situation in South Africa.
The best way to develop such incentives is through leg
islative action; separate foreign policies for Stanford, the
University of California, and the pensioners of the Com
monwealth of Massachusetts will not get us very far.
Consortia of companies and investing institutions,
acting together, might not only encourage legislation, but
also muster enough economic force to encourage positive
change themselves.
Bishop Tutu has said that unless the system is being dis
mantled within two years, he will urge foreign companies
to leave. I believe that timetable is fair and reasonable, and
that it can be made a rallying point for those who wish to use
economic influence constructively rather than discard it.

Public Forum to
Discuss Divestment
Date: Tuesday, May 7, 1985
Time: 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.
Place: The Quad
Everyone is invited and encouraged to attend this forum.

Friends:
In a meeting on Thursday, April 25, with representa
tives of the students gathered outside Building 10,1 prom
ised to give an account of my views about divestment as a
means of relieving the conditions of oppression and injus
tice that prevail for blacks in South Africa.
Let me begin by stating some objectives I believe almost
all of us share. South Africa today represents an especially
repugnant form of institutionalized racial injustice — spe
cial because of the degree to which a small minority en
gages in restraints upon human freedom and violations of
basic human rights.
Our ultimate objective for the people of South Africa
ought to be the firm establishment of democratic majority
rule; and in the near term, we should seekevery opportun
ity to ameliorate oppression by the South African govern
ment and to relieve the restrictions now placed on the
rights of black South Africans.
That analysis and those goals have been with us for some
time, but conditions in South Africa are improving margi
nally if at all. Indeed, after signs that many observers found
encouraging a year or two ago, the Pretoria government
has appeared to congeal in its implacability.
In the meantime, the U.S. policy of constructive engage
ment has seemed barren of constructive influence. The re
sult has been a national wave of protest here in the United
States—initially against an apparently ineffectual govern
ment policy, but eventually against private policies of in
vestment and trade as well.
When sincere and energetic compassion of the kind dis
played here at Stanford is dammed up by government in
difference, that concern inevitably seeks other channels. It
is therefore not surprising that an intense focus upon di
vestment as a strategy for ending apartheid has arisen here
and elsewhere.
Proper strategy
We are nevertheless obliged to ask whether that is the
proper strategy. I am troubled that rational discourse ab
out that question seems to have become a victim of moral
urgency.
For many people with whom I have talked over the past
few days, the matter seems closed: as in the San Francisco
Chronicle headlines, "foe of apartheid" has become synony
mous with "advocate of divestment." Our tradition here is
for a thoughtful examination of all possible views, and I
think we will fail to live up to that tradition if one view of a
complex subject can be dismissed out of hand as morally
inferior — as in the simple portrayal of our choice as one
between "money and morality."
There certainly is a moral issue here: it is the practice of
apartheid and the goal of ending that practice. Full or par
tial divestment are policies that may or may not lead us to
ward that goal. To transfer moral standing from the goal to
the process is, it seems to me, wrong.
By avoiding that, I hope we can also avoid stigmatizing
one another, and so retain the respect and decency that so
characterize this community —even when it is in disagree
ment about matters as complex and as deeply disturbing as
this one.
Now let me turn to the policy of total divestment. Surely
the central moral question having to do with divestment is
its efficacy as a policy. The most legitimate aim of divest
ment would be to help accomplish the goal of improving
conditions for blacks in South Africa.
Only if it can help to secure such progress, and only if it is
fairly certain not to bring about the reverse effect, is divest
ment a moral act with substance. To divest without having
any such positive effect may "make a statement," but in the
absence of any improvement that statement is an empty
one.
We might end by feeling better; but will we have made a
difference? Will we have foregone the very slim chance we
have as a minor stockholder to affect the policies and ac
tions of the business community? Are we ready to ex
change a policy of selective divestment that might make a
slight difference for one of total divestment that is likely to
make even less?
Tests of effectiveness
To judge divestment as effective, I think we would need
to be convinced of two things. First, it would have to be
shown that its ultimate objective — the withdrawal of U.S.
and of other foreign investment from South Africa —
would improve the conditions for black South Africans.
And second, we would need to be satisfied that institu
tional divestment here in the United States would actually
make that withdrawal more probable.
As to the first question, opinion is divided even among
those deeply committed to the ending of apartheid in
South Africa. Some believe that corporations owned by the
United States are among the more progressive employers
in that country, that those corporations have set useful ex
amples for worker training and educational assistance (as
in IBM's recent commitment to spend $10 million on prog
rams in black elementary schools), and that their pressure
on the government, individually and through organiza
tions like the American Chamber of Commerce in South
Africa, provides a positive influence.
Opponents of U.S. investment point to it as a precedent
for other foreign investment, and cite the lack of progress
on wages of black workers and on the freedom of worker
movement as evidence that constructive action is unlikely.
They argue that since U.S. firms employ approximately
120,000 black workers, which is a very small percentage of

the total black work force in South Africa, their influence
upon employment practices and the general lot of blacks is
limited anyhow, and that by their presence they provide
technological and political support to the Pretoria govern
ment.
A similar difference of opinion exists with respect to the
withdrawal of all foreign interests: would it lead to a des
tabilization of the present government and a relaxation of
oppression, or merely the replacement of those interests by
South African ones, or perhaps even to massive hardship
and unemployment of blacks, accompanied by little or no
political improvement?
I believe that such wide differences of opinion exist be
cause it is inherently very difficult to predict the behavior of
large economic and political systems under stress.
Outcome uncertain
Even those most intimate with South Africa cannot agree
as to the most likely outcome; and how, then, can we attach
great certainty to our own views? One thing does seem like
ly to me, and that is that the withdrawal of American firms
from South Africa would likely result in their short-term
replacement by interests representing the other major
partner economies.
The European Economic Community, for example,
presently has about four times the level of economic activ
ity in South Africa as has the United States. An economic
niche vacated by us would be easily filled from that source;
and in general, concern for investment responsibility
issues has been notably lower in Europe than it has in the
United States.
I am thus left with grave doubt about whether the with
drawal of U.S. investment from South Africa would lead to
the secondary withdrawal of all other foreign investment
from that country; and I am in equal doubt as to whether
the second event, if it occurred, would be beneficial.

and alumni, provides a well established mechanism for that
purpose, and its resources have recently been modestly ex
panded. By staying involved, raising questions and sug
gesting change, we may over time have modestly greater
influence over the future course of events than by simply
severing our ties automatically, across the board or by for
mula.
Impact on Stanford
A final word is necessary on the subject of divestment.
We are also required to consider the effects of such a policy
on Stanford, because the Trustees are legally responsible
for preserving the institutional assets they hold in public
trust. The law holds in general that there is both a duty of
loyalty to the stated purposes of the trust and a duty of pru
dence in investment.
Similar duties apply to Regents, or other governing offi
cials of public universities, although the specific legal situa
tion may be somewhat different. This question was public
ly considered at the time the Regents were first asked to
consider divestment, and will no doubt arise again.
The legal questions are very serious ones, which would
have to be considered carefully by our Trustees if they be
came convinced that total divestment was the right course
to pursue in the interest of black South Africans. (A deci
sion to divest by the Regents would not necessarily mean
that the same course was legally open to Stanford's Trus
tees, since the legal requirements placed upon public offi
cials and upon Trustees may not be identical.)

Finally, I would like to turn to other ways in which we at
Stanford can contribute usefully to the ending of apar
theid. At my meeting with the officers of the Black Student
Union on April 18,1 was asked to demonstrate some lead
ership with respect to alternatives. It was put to me that
since I did not favor blanket divestment as a policy to pur
sue the goal of ending apartheid, I should suggest other
means toward the same ends. That was, and is, an entirely
reasonable request.
I continue to believe that the legislative arena is the best
one in which to pursue our goals. A number of bills have
already been introduced in Congress, and more will no
doubt follow. Senate Bill S-635, introduced by Senators
Ted Kennedy and Lowell Weicker, contains a number of
provisions that I think will take us in the right direction.
It provides for a series of trade sanctions against the gov
ernment of South Africa that are designed not to throw
non-whites out of work.
At the same time, it offers significant improvement in
centives: the sanctions may be waved if there is demonstr
able progress in such areas as the ending of removals, pro
visions for the fre&movement of labor, elimination of poli
cies that make distinctions between the South African
nationality of blacks and whites, and several others.
It is not a perfect bill, but I think it can be improved by
amendment, and I support its main provisions. Senator
Kennedy has asked me for comments, and I will be provid
ing them. Among the features I intend to work for is an
extension of the embargo on materials or technologies
used in support of apartheid so that it will cover adequately
foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies.
We will also undertake, in Stanford's Office of Govern
ment Relations, legislative analyses of this and other signi
ficant pending bills. These analyses can be made available
to students and faculty members who want to use them,
and I am prepared to consider other ways in which we can
help to develop or support legislative approaches to the
ending of apartheid.
Consortium effort
Stanford has recently joined a consortium of 16 colleges
and universities formed last fall at the initiative of Wes
leyan University . This group earlier wrote to the American
Chamber of Commerce in South Africa, arguing for more
effective actions against apartheid by American firms
doing business in that country.
The chamber responded to these urgings, which we en
dorse. On March 7, AMCHAM submitted a series of re
commendations to the South African government,
through the Minister of Constitutional Development and
Planning.
These proposals called for an end to influx controls, for
free-hold property rights for all blacks, for an end to re
movals, and for citizenship and extension of the franchise
— among other things.
It represented the first time the chamber had put public
pressure on the Pretoria regime on behalf of ending apar
theid. This development, however modest, is encourag
ing. It suggests that consortia can be effective in increasing
the pressure for change, and it may lead to consideration of
more specific timetables, reinforced by effective sanctions.
It isin this latterarea, I think, that our best eventual hope
lies. Economic incentives, both positive and negative, are
among the most promising means by which the United
States can hope to change the situation in South Africa.
The best way to develop such incentives is through leg
islative action; separate foreign policies for Stanford, the
University of California, and the pensioners of the Com
monwealth of Massachusetts will not get us very far.
Consortia of companies and investing institutions,
acting together, might not only encourage legislation, but
also muster enough economic force to encourage positive
change themselves.
Bishop Tutu has said that unless the system is being dis
mantled within two years, he will urge foreign companies
to leave. I believe that timetable is fair and reasonable, and
that it can be made a rallying point for those who wish to use
economic influence constructively rather than discard it.
