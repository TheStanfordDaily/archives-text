## Netters stomp UCLA, 9-0

If the Stanford women's tennis team's
storybook season ended now, everyone would
live happily ever after.
With the NCAA team and individual cham
pionships 10 days away, the season still might
end on a happy note, but things can't get a
whole lot better for Coach Frank Brennan
and his team.
The No. 1-ranked Cardinal closed out its
regular season yesterday with a 9-0 victory
over the UCLA Bruins, who are ranked ninth
nationally. The Cardinal finished 25-1 overall
and 13-1 in the Western Collegiate Athletic
Association.
Senior team captain Linda Gates also
played the last home matches of her storied
Stanford career. Gates was at the top of her
game, winning 6-3, 6-3 at No. 1 singles and 6-
1, 7-5 with Leigh Anne Eldredge at No. 1
doubles.
"It was a great match," Brennan said.
"Everybody played very well. It was a perfect
ending to a perfect season."
Well, not quite perfect. Stanford did lose
one match in 1985 — to USC 5-4 two months
ago — but the way the Cardinal has been
playing lately, that loss can go in the record
books with an asterisk next to it. And next to
the asterisk can go the word "fluke."
"I do think that we weren't ready that day,"
Brennan said of his team's only loss in its last
52 matches. "They had two of their top
players out and it was an amazing perfor
mance for them to beat us."
Stanford, however, has returned the favor
against the Trojans twice since, and it has at
least one victory over every other team
ranked in the top 10 except seventh-ranked
Trinitv and lOth-ranked Northwestern.

Brennan said he is satisfied with the
season's outcome, and as far as he's con
cerned, anything from here on in is a bonus.
"That's a great, great season we had," he said.
"And I don't want anything that happens at
the nationals to take anything away from it."
Except for Saturday's exhibition mixed
match against California at Maples Pavilion,
the Cardinal is off until May 16, when it will
open the team competition of the NCAAs in
Oklahoma City. The team final is scheduled
for May 19 with the individual singles and
doubles tournaments beginning May 21.
Brennan said he expects Stanford's top five
singles players — Gates, Patty Fendick.
Eldredge. Stephanie Savides and Kay Tittle
— to qualify for the singles. However, he
noted that only one Cardinal doubles team is
a shoo-in.
Stanford's No. 1 team of Gates and
Eldredge may be the nation's best, but its No.
2 team of Fendick and Werdel hasn't been to
gether long enough to qualify for the nation
als. The Cardinal's No. 3 team of Savides and
Tittle is on the borderline, and its fate will be
decided later this week when the NCAA
draws up the bracket.
If the NCAA bases its decisions on yester
day's match alone, all six Cardinal netters
would be locks at both singles and doubles. So
perfect was Stanford's whitewashing of the
Bruins that Tittle having to go to three sets at
No. 5 singles wasn't an imperfection, but a
beauty mark.
Other than Tittle, the Cardinal won every
match in straight sets, giving it a 18-1 margin
in sets and a 1 14-42 margin in games. Prob
ably the most impressive effort of the after
noon was that of the recently formed No. 2
doubles team of Werdel and Fendick. who

routed UCLA's Allison Cooper and Jessica
Algazi 6-0, 6-0.
Also impressive was Stanford's No. 3
doubles team of Savides and Cari Hagey, who
replaced Tittle when her chronic knee prob
lem acted up in singles. Hagey has been both
ered by a sore shoulder and hadn't played in a
team match since early in the season.
"Cari's our No. 7 player right now; she's
our first replacement in singles and doubles,"
Brennan said. "And to see her play so well
and be so match-tough really meant a lot to
the team."
And then there was Gates, who finished her
home career in style with straight-set singles
and doubles victories.
"She's always been like a baby to me,"
Brennan said of Gates, who was given a bou
quet of roses after her doubles match. "And
now she's the senior and the team leader. This
has probably been the toughest year we've
had as a team. She was really tested as a
player and as a leader, and she came through
as a champion.
"She has the potential to go into the record
books as one of the greatest women's col
legiate tennis players of all time. She is easily
one of the top two or three players I've
coached."
Gates, with one more NCAA tournament
left, has already played on two NCAA cham
pionship teams. A three-time Ail-American,
she also has won the NCAA doubles title, and
has been doubles and singles runner-up once.
That leaves the singles title as her only real
piece of unfinished business.
"It would be nice to have that title," said
Gates, who plans to turn pro after graduation
in June. "But. you have to put everything in
perspective. When it comes right down to it.
it's not the end of the world if I lose."
