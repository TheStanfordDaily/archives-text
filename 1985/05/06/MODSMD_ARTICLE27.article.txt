# Card's present whips Stanford's past, 29-0
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN Editorial staff 
If you're a football fan and you
spent yesterday afternoon watching
some overpaid, under-enthusiastic
players going through the motions in
a United States Football League
game, you should be ashamed. The
only real place for a Bay Area foot
ball fan yesterday was a bleacher seat
in sunny Stanford Stadium, with a

cold drink and a good view of the
second annual Stanford Varsity-
Alumni football game.
The final score was Varsity 29,
Alumni 0, but close competition
wasn't what the estimated 6,500
people came for. What mattered was
that the legends of Stanford's past
and the hopes of Stanford's future got
together, laughed, shook hands and
got in some good solid hitting out on

the field.
You could look at the visiting
sideline and see alumnus Darrin Nel
son laughing and wrestling with
nearly everyone he met and carrying
his young child from one end of the
field to the other. You could look on
the field and see Alumni Offensive
Coordinator John Elway — like Nel
son, unable to play because of pro
contract stipulations — in sunglasses
and khaki shorts, holding up plays on
a yellow pad and explaining them to
his team.
Or, you could check out the Card
inal varsity and watch both the
familiar names like John Paye and
Thomas Henley and the relative un
knowns like Tom Boushka and Chris
Chapman give you hope for the fall.
Anyway you looked at it, it was a
football fan s dream.
"It's a real nice affair," Stanford
Coach Jack Elway — that's Jack, not
John — said while standing at mid
field after the game. He lit a cigarette
and glanced at all the players and
spectators still milling around the
field, unwilling to leave just yet. "It's
the combination of past and present,
it's game experience . . . and it's a
good time."
It was such a good time that the
two teams kept playing even after the
game had ended. In order to give the
second varsity team some work, the
alumni agreed to run a few more se
ries alter the clock had run down to
:()(). The second varsity ran four
downs, 1971 alum Jackie Brown
threw an interception in the end zone
to Rick Theder, and second-string
varsity OB Fred Buckley closed out
play with an 80-yard TD pass to
Chapman.
That "fifth quarter" followed in the
pattern of the previous four — all the
offensive action came when the var
sity had the ball. The alumni's leading
rusher was Mike Dotterer with five
yards on three carries, and Guy Ben
jamin paced the alum quarterbacks
with 81 yards on 6-for-13 passing.

Someone asked Jack Elway about
the alumni's offensive ineptitude
after the game and he chuckled.
"Yeah," he said, "the guy in the
background (John Elway) was the
only one who kept them from doing a
good job on offense."
That wasn't exactly true — 1972
Rose Bowl quarterback and current
team doctor Don Bunce did his share.
In the second quarter, Bunce threw a
flare pass to Jack Alustiza in his own
end zone that turned into a safety,
and he lofted a duck while on the run
in the fourth quarter that was inter
cepted by defensive back Pat
Boushka and returned 2 1 yards for a
touchdown.
Varsity quarterback Paye had no
such problems. Paye hit on 14 of 21
passes for 180 yards and one TD, even
though he had to contend with a par
ticularly difficult defensive back in

the third quarter — John Paye Sr.,
who played for the Cardinal in 1961-
62.
Henley's performance was the best
among the running backs, a position
which Jack Elway called "the
strength of the football team right
now." Henley rushed four times for
73 yards, including a 21-yard romp
around end in the third period and a
43-yarder in the fourth which set up
Kevin Scott's 1-yard TD plunge.
Henley, who is listed at 5-11, 185
pounds, gained his yardage by shift
ing and spinning into the clear — 6-3,
215-pound Brad Muster got his 54
receiving yards and 15 rushing yards
by running over people.
In the second period, Muster took
a pass from Paye and galloped down
the right sideline, shrugging off three
tackles on the way to a huge gainer
that set up the Cardinal's first score, a

7-yard pass from Paye to Eric Snel
son. It was the kind of one-man effort
that earned Muster second-team All-
Pacific 10 Conference honors last
year and has brought him rave
reviews from the coaching staff all
spring.
"I don't know how good he can
he," Elway said. "I'd hate to say any
thing just because I don't want to put
any limits on him."
Scott, who will split time with Hen
ley at tailback next year, also had an
impressive day. He rushed six times
for 31 yards and a TD in addition to
catching three passes for 51 yards.
After a month of watching his team
develop, Elway is guardedly optimis
tic about the 1985-86 season. "I'm
really satisfied with the spring we've
had," he said, "with the proviso that
we've got a long way to go."

Former 49er quarterback Guy Benjamin completed only six of his 13
passes yesterday, thanks in part to drops by his receivers and blocking
letdowns.
