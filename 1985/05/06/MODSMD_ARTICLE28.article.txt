# Men netters breeze by Bears

### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's tennis team capped off a
succest'ul 25-3 season here Friday with an 8-1
thrashing of 13th-ranked California. The Cardinal
now has only the mixed team match with Cal left
before going to Athens, Ga., for the NCAA cham
pionships on May 18.
Other than a little "carelessness" and "letting
up" in some matches, Stanford Coach Dick Gould
said he was pleased with the near-sweep of the
Bears. Stanford won the match in a quick hour
and-a-half, with five consecutive straight-set
singles victories.
Dan Goldie defeated Cal's top player, Steve
DeVries, 7-5, 7-5. DeVries, ranked No. 20, upset
Goldie in straight sets the last time the two met.
Although Goldie won this time around, he ad
mitted the match wasn't an exhibition of excellent
tennis by his standards. "I don't think either of us
was playing very well," Goldie said.
Doubles competition was delayed until the No. 4
singles match between Pat McEnroe and Brian
Flowers was finished. McEnroe won the match, 6-
0, 6-7, 6-4, to round out the Cardinal's singles
sweep.
"In the first set 1 was really tense and I just
wasn't playing freely at all," Flowers said after the
match. "I got some confidence back after winning
the tiebreaker in the second set, but I think 1 got

too loose. I couldn't keep it together in the third."
McEnroe was more succinct in describing his
play in the second set.
"What happened? It was a horrible display of
tennis," he said.
Horrible or not, McEnroe's win raised his season
record to 24-10. As a freshman, he has moved up
two notches in the lineup since the beginning of the
season and has played nearly as many matches this
season as juniors John Letts, Jim Grabb, Goldie,
and Eric Rosenfeld.
Rosenfeld defeated Cat's Gerald Yung, 6-1, 7-5,
but injured his knee during the match by coming
down hard on his right leg after hitting an over
head. The injury gave Coach Dick Gould added
reason — along with the fact that Stanford had
already won the match — to take Goldie and
Rosenfeld out of the doubles competition.
Jeremy Semple and Paul Robinson, this season's
senior team members, replaced Goldie and Rosen
feld in the No. 3 doubles match to play a final
match for the Cardinal.
Never mind that they lost the match. They
walked away from the court with smiles.
"Playing here has been a great experience. I al
ways knew I could transfer from Stanford, but you
just can't do something like that. Just being around
these guys who are so good has been great for my
own playing," Robinson said.
Robinson was a top recruit in 1981 and was a

starter his freshman year. Semple also started his
freshman year in doubles. Gould had other success
ful recruiting years after that, however, and Robin
son and have sincc slipped from the top six.
"It choice I made. I could have played for
some like San Diego State or USD. but
being on a team that has five players ranked in the
top 30 is much more worthwhile," Robinson said.
Robinson now plans to take a year off, apply to
medical school, and continue playing tennis in a
Hawaiian circuit.
Cal came into this final Pacific 10 Conference
match with a little more on the line than Stanford
— the Bears are making a bid for one of the three
at-large spots in the NCAA tournament.
"If we had won today we would have definitely
gone (to the NCAAs)," Dave Richmond said. "But
as it stands, we don't know if we'll make it or not."
Players said they were told to "be intense" and
play hard.
"Our coach told us not to hold back anything.
We've obviously got nothing to lose, so why not
just go for it," freshman Ted Scherman said.
The strategy seemed to work for the Bears in the
doubles matches. Stanford lost the first set in all
three matches.
"We let up a little in the doubles matches. We
came in flat," Gould said. "It's harder when we've
already won the match, and I guess you could just
call it carelessness."
