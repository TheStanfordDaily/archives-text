# Stanford track splits with Cal
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Staff sportswriter 
A couple of streaks were extended
for at least another year last weekend
— the Stanford women's track team
made it three straight victories over
California with its 78-67 victory here,
while the Cardinal men's team, which
has not beaten Cal in dual-meet com
petition since 1971, showed well but
still ended up short, losing 90-72 to
the talent-laden Bears.
Heading the pack for the Stanford
women was senior standout Regina
Jacobs, who finished first in both the
800 and 1,500 meters and ran the
third leg of the victorious 4x440-mile
relay team.
"Regina is as gifted a person as we
have had here," said Cardinal Head
Coach Brooks Johnson. "She has al
ways helped in our meets. There's
still certain maturity that needs to
take place so that she believes in her
self."
Though Jacobs was pleased with
her efforts, most notably the 1,500
meters, she was more enthusiatic
about the overall performance of the
Cardinal women.
"Everyone really pulled together,"
she said. "Everyone was cheering
each other on; we were working to
gether in the relays. . . . [Cal's] our
• rival — we had to."
The meet was still very much up for
grabs going into the penultimate
event — the discus. Karen Nickerson,
who according to Stanford Asst.
Coach Dave Wollman had trained

very hard throughout the week, still
had enough strength to reel off a fling
of 176 feet to clinch the Cardinal vic
tory.
The Cardinal women also got out
standing performances in the javelin
and high jump events. Stanford's
one-two javelin combo of Denise
Gazambide and Elizabeth Archer
both bettered their closest Cal op
ponents by more than 15 feet, co
lectively totaling eight points for their
first- and second-place finishes.
Freshman high jumper Lisa
Bernhagen not only captured first
place, but also broke the school
record with her jump of six feet.
Cardinal men's high jumper Brian
Marshall paralleled Bernhagen's feat
with a leap of seven feet and three
inches, good enough to put him in the
University record books and qualify
for the NCAAs.
Marshall's jump did not really
surprise Wollman, who said that Mar
shall had additional leaping strength
for the meet because he had been res
ting up for the past week.
"Brian lost all his base training
with his Achilles tendon injury,"
Wollman said. "Until this time, I've
been working him real hard in
practice, so he didn't have as much
spring. Now he's in a rhythm."
Stanford's Henry Green had
enough spring to nail down a first
place showing in the long jump.
Green's jump of 24 feet was a per
sonal best for the season.

Seniors Brian Masterson and
Shaun Pickering continued their mas
tery in the hammer competition,
going one-two for the Cardinal, and
javelin thrower Fred Mondragon
posted his third personal best in three
weeks with his first-place throw of
236 feet.
Despite the meet loss, Johnson was
pleased with the overall effort, and in

his usual fashion, put things in per
spective.
"We competed very well and
finished as well as can be expected,"
Johnson said. "These kids have to
carry around books, read them and
then get tested on them. Then, they
focus two to three hours a day on this.
It's really a compliment to be around
these multi-faceted kids."

Junior Phil Cannon won the triple jump for Stanford Saturday with a

his 1984 season best of 50 feet.
