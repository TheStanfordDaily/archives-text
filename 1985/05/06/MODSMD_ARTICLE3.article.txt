# Police: Secretary embezzled cash
## 
### SCOTT PARKER 
A Psychology Department secre
tary charged with embezzlement and
forgery will enter her plea at a pre
trial hearing today in Santa Clara
County's North County Courthouse.
Laurie Ann Landis, 32, of El
Granada, was arrested last Tuesday
by Stanford police after an internal
audit revealed irregularities totaling
nearly $6,000 in petty cash transac
tions over the past year, said Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
"We think we have a real solid
case," he said.
Landis, an ex-convict currently
being held at Elmwood Women's
Facility, is expected to plead not

guilty to the charges, according to
Lorraine O'Keefe, supervising dep
uty district attorney.
Landis was arrested at St. Cath
erine's Hospital in Half Moon Bay by
Sgt. Philip Love and Detective John
McMullen, in cooperation with San
Mateo County probation officers. At
the hospital, she had voluntarily en
tered a drug rehabilitation program,
Niemeyer said.
Landis did not admit or deny the
charges during police questioning, ac
cording to Niemeyer. "She indicated
that it was in her best interests not to
answer" specific questions about the
case, he said.
The audit, conducted by the Inter

nal Audit Office, began after Landis
allegedly intercepted a royalty check
intended for Psychology Prof. Rich
ard Thompson, forged his signature
and cashed it. Landis was
Thompson's secretary.
According to Niemeyer, the inves
tigation turned up numerous phony
receipts submitted in the names of
several researchers over a 14-month
period.
None of the money has been
recovered. "It's just gone," Niemeyer
said.
When Landis left her job to enter
the drug treatment program in
March, the police investigation
began, Niemeyer said. When their

regularities surfaced, police obtained
the warrant with $50,000 bail, which
led to Landis' arrest.
Landis has previously been con
victed of "a whole lot of different
crimes â€” theft, forgery and other
drug-related crimes," Niemeyer said.
He also expressed little hope of
recovering the money, explaining that
"Landis was apparently a very bad
drug addict."
Landis had worked for the Psychol
ogy Department since 1982, and had
been Thompson's secretary since
early in 1984. Thompson said he did
not know until recently of Landis'
