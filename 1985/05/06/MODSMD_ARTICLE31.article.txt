# USC stops Cal 9

### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” Rodney
Peete and Alby Silvera each clubbed
two-run home runs yesterday to
power USC to an 11-5 victory over
California in a Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division baseball game.
The loss eliminated Cal from the
Six-Pac title chase. Even if the Bears
had won, however, Stanford's victory
over Arizona State yesterday would
have ended their chances.
Peete, who went 3-for-4 in the
game, hit his two-run shot in the third
inning to lift the Trojans to a 5-0
lead, while Silvera, 3-for-5 in the
contest, added his round-tripper with

a man on in the eighth to cap a five
run outburst.
Catcher Damon Oppenheimer
went 4-for-4 with a double and two
RBIs for the Trojans, while junior
left-hander Randy Johnson, 6-8,
pitched a complete game, striking out
eight and walking five, to earn the
victory.
With the victory, USC improved its
conference mark to 5-21, 22-40 over
all. California fell to 15-11 in Six-Pac
play, 39-20 in all.
Will Shock, 6-3, lasted just three
innings, allowing five runs and seven
hits, to suffer the defeat for Cal.
