The Stanford women golfers will get a break from
serious competitive action prior to the NCAA tourna
ment when they join several celebrities and amateur gol
fers today in the fifth annual Cardinal Club Celebrity-
Amateur Tournament at the Stanford Golf Course.
The tournament will begin at noon, with 222 golfers
scheduled to take part, according to Cardinal Coach Tim
Baldwin.
Baldwin said that the tournament — which was sold out
a month ago — is traditionally very successful in raising
money for the University's women's athletic program.
"It's the most successful one-day fund-raiser in the Bay
Area," Baldwin said, noting that the Cardinal Club ex
pects to raise $40,000 this year. "The cause is terrific."
Baldwin said the Stanford women's teams have
responded to the money raised at the tournament by im
proved national showings. As in the past, members of the
various women's teams will be working at the tournament
in several capacities.

Jim Plunkett — the former Stanford Heisman Trophy
winner and current Los Angeles Raider quarterback
has and continues to be the "main thrust" of the tourna
ment, according to Baldwin. Plunkett, a board member of
the Cardinal Club, has been instrumental in attracting
people from all parts of the West Coast to play in the
tournament and does much of the detail work.
The master-of-ceremonies duties will be shared this
year by former Oakland Raider Coach John Madden and
local radio personality Bob Murphy.
Among the other celebrities from the sports world that
will be on hand are former Raiders' center Dave Dalby,
Stanford Men's Basketball Coach Tom Davis, Raiders'
Coach Tom Flores, former Cardinal and current Chicago
Bears receiver Ken Margerum and ex-Giants slugger,
Willie McCovey. *3
Following the tournament, the members of the Cardinal
women's golf team will put on an exhibition next to the
18th green. Each Cardinal will display a different shot to
the audience.
