The Stanford men's and women's varsity, junior var
sity, novice and freshman crew teams raced this
weekend in their final tune-ups for the Pacific Coast
Rowing Championships in Sacramento. Strong perfor
mances by the Cardinal indicate that a peak could be in
store for the upcoming championships.
The men's varsity and junior varsity eights each
stroked its fastest race of the year in victories over San
Diego State at Redwood Shores yesterday. The fresh
man and novice eights raced both Saturday and yester
day, the frosh going 2-0 while the novice dropped a
pair of close ones to San Diego State.
Yesterday's dual meet provided an inspirational
stepping stone for the men's varsity. They beat the Az
tecs by a strong three-quarters of a length in posting a
5:54.7 time. Coach Ken Dreyfuss attributed the new
season best to some tactical personnel changes, most
notably the installments of Andy Rebele in the stroke
seat and Lindon Blue in the seventh seat.

Dreyfuss added that all of the men's teams have
been concentrating on higher stroke rates and general
efficiency. Hoping this rate of improvement will con
tinue, he said that the varsity is at "about the half-way
step" in preparation for the championships.
On Saturday, the novice and frosh teams raced in
Sacramento, where the frosh eight won going away by
three lengths in 6:22 over UC-Davis, UC-Santa Bar

were again victorious, while the novice came closer
against San Diego State.

novice eight competition were upset by the Beavers.
