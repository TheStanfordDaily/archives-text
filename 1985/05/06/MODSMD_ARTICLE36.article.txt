## H & C tempers plans New COP will not totally disband senate 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
A month ago, the Hammer and
Coffin slate's campaign statement
was explicit. "Fuck the Associated
Students of Stanford University,"
said the slate's campaign statement
during its successful bid for election
to the ASSU Council of Presidents
(COP).
H & C's message, filled with
frustration over what it perceived as
the ASSU's inability during the past
year to adequately serve student
needs, hit home with the student
body, as the slate outdistanced its
nearest competitor by a two-to-one
margin in the April election.
Since the slate's victory, specula
tion has centered on whether the new
members of the executive branch of
the ASSU — Mike Collins, Andy
Frisch, Leslie Leland and Tim Quirk
— will be able tp make good on their
campaign promises, including one to
disband the senate.
While the new COP no longer says
it intends to completely abolish the
senate, changes in the structure of the
legislative branch of the student gov
ernment are in store.
"We ran saying we'll disband the
senate because it was obsolete and
non-productive. If we can fundamen
tally change the senate into an effi
cient organization, then there's no
need to disband it. If things just keep
getting worse, then disbanding might
be the solution," said Frisch.
"We're not going to disband it (the

senate) per se, but we would like to
institute fundamental changes. We've
been talking to the new senators
about how they'd like to change the
senate," said Frisch. "The senate as it
is now is obsolete."
Leland said she and the other
members of H & C are working
closely with members of the new sen
ate, the outgoing COP members,
Senate Chair Eric Berg and Graduate
Senator Jim McGrath to get different
perspectives of the problems facing
the new government. .
According to Frisch, "a lot of them
(members of the new senate) support
a lot of what we're saying."
Quirk said the new COP is pleased
with several proposals for changes of
the ASSU bylaws and structure of the
senate now being designed by several
members of the present senate who
will also serve next year, including
Jeff Soukup, Carey White and B.G.
Porter.
Leland said the new COP supports
a move to reduce the number of
senators to 16, with eight under
graduate and eight graduate students.
Such a constitutional change would
require a vote of the student body,
Leland said, adding that it could be
placed on the 1986 spring ballot.
Frisch, however, said he is not
worried that the current size of the
senate will hinder the ASSU's opera
tions. "The size (of the senate) isn't
important. It's what they do that
counts," he said.
The current structure of the senate

"presents us with a stacked deck
which does two things. It's too large
and unwieldy a body to make effec
tive decisions, and the presence of an
alternate for every elected senator ef
fectively does away with the pretense
of accountabiltiy," Collins said.
Another proposal calls for stream
lining the funding process for student
organizations, Quirk said. "Basically
it's exactly what we wanted. It puts
the power where it should be — with
the students," he said.
The proposal tentatively calls for
the abolition of the appropriations
committee and the restructuring of
the program board to include several
students outside of the senate, two
members of the senate and a member
of the COP, Quirk said.
This new body would make budget
recommendations to the senate,
which would then vote to either ac
cept or reject each budget, Quirk
said, adding that the senate would no
longer have the power to make
changes in the budgets on the floor.
During two upcoming meetings of
the senators-elect, including one
Wednesday, the new COP and senate
will hammer out the wording of the
senators' proposal, Quirk said. He
added that he would like to have the
proposals ready for the first official
meeting of the new senate on May 29.
According to White, changes in the
funding system fall under the ASSU's
bylaws and the new senate could vote
on a change as early as the first
meeting this spring.

McGrath said he agrees with
H & C that there are problems with
the present system of funding student
organizations and is working on an
other proposal to restructure the
funding process.
McGrath said the appropriations
committee currently spends too much
time "trying to put together decent
budgets" for groups whose figures
don't add up or don't know what it is
they really want from ASSU funding.
He said the problem could be allevi
ated "at a lower level" by having two
directors meet with groups to get
their budgets in order before they
reach the appropriations committee.
Leland, however, said McGrath's

proposal is "a complete 180 degrees
away from the things we'd like to
see," adding that it attempts "to get
more power on the senate floor."
Another change the members of
the new COP would like to see is a
redefinition of the powers of the
ASSU's executive branch.
The present ASSU constitution
defines the role of the COP as "an
administrative role. They shall over
see and coordinate the day to day
operations and activities of the Asso
ciation. They are also responsible for
facilitating and coordinating indepen
dent student efforts. They shall be the
chief representatives of the Associa

tion, both inside the University com
munity and outside."
"At the moment we do absolutely
nothing," Quirk said.
Leland said the COP should serve
as "a check on the senate." Frisch
said that the senate should "set things
up and we'll try to operate them,"
adding that "in a good government
you need checks and balances."
McGrath said he believes "the
COP do not actually intend to pro
gram much legislation."
Soukup, however, is impressed by
the new COP. "Actually, we've had a
lot of good meetings with them
already," he said.
