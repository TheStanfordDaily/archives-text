# Two injured in moped crash
## 
### 
I wo Stanford students riding a
moped through a parking lot behind
Foyon Hall collided with a car at
about 11:40 p.m. last night. Fire and
Police Department officials on the
scene said neither student was injured
seriously.
Sophomores Robert Fairlie, 20,
and Cristina Trujillo, 19, were
knocked off the moped when they hit
the right side of a white Ford Mus
tang, near the front of the car. Both
remained conscious and said it was
not necessary to call an ambulance.
Robert Moran, the driver of the
car, said he asked the two students to
lie down and wait for help while a
woman nearby called for an am

bulance.
Moran, 22, a former Stanford foot
ball player who graduated last quar
ter, said the accident was not his fault.
"They hit me," he said.
Also in the car was freshman John
Cotten, 19, a current member of the
Stanford's football team.
Moran and Cotten said they did not
see the moped before the accident.
Moran said he had not been driving
unusally fast, and pointed to a
drainage ditch that he said caused
him to slow down just before his car
and the moped collided.
He repeatedly asked a police offi
cer if he could get the names and
numbers of the two injured students

so that he could contact them, and if
he could find out where the am
bulance was taking the students so
that he could visit them. "I just hope
they're all right," he said.
Mick McDonald, Palo Alto Fire
Department engine captain, said
Fairlie and Trujillo probably sus
tained only minor wounds, "just
bumps and bruises." He said an am
bulance on the scene was taking them
to the Stanford Hospital emergency
room "to get checked out."
According to Officer Hilary Karp
of Stanford police, it appeared that
there was "no specific fault involved"
in the accident. "They didn't see each
other."
