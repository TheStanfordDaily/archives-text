# Prof, denies sex-drug endorsement
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Staff writer 
A Stanford Medical School professor is in the
process of attempting to counteract what he calls
inaccurate reporting on his research on sexual
stimulants.
Dr. Julian Davidson, professor of physiology,
said a "completely fictitious interview" with him
and his study subjects has been published and used
in an advertising campaign for yohimbine, a drug
which allegedly increases sexual activity in men.
"They hint very strongly that I have endorsed it
or Stanford has endorsed it." Davidson said. "It's
really getting very sickening."
Davidson, an expert on the biology of human
sexual behavior, said he has been studying the role
of hormones in sexual behavior, using both animals
and human subjects. "The work in my lab is all
about understanding the biology of sexual behavior
in rats and humans." Davidson said.
Davidson's research focused on discovering an
antidote for certain prescription drugs whose side
effects hinder sexual performance. Ik* said the drug
yohimbine was found to reverse these side effects
in patients taking clonidine, an anti-hypertensive
drug.
"We later discovered that the drug is not only a
good antidote, but a good stimulant by itself,"
Davidson said.
Davidson later published a report of his findings
in the August 24. 1984 issue of Science magazine

outlining the effects of yohimbine on male rats. The
study concluded that the drug strongly increased
the male rats' sexual drive.
Davidson said that although yohimbine has been
touted previously as an "aphrodisiac" in cultures
throughout the world, this presumption has not
been accepted by medical authorities because of
the lack of conclusive research.
Yohimbine, originally obtained from the bark of
the tropical tree Corynanthe yohinibe, is now a
synthetically produced prescription drug. It is
available in prescription form as an analgesic and
for depression, but not for sexual disfunction,
Davidson said.
A four-page advertisement in Male Sexuality
Report reportedly quoted Davidson and fictitious
patients as saying yohimbine stimulated and en
hanced sexual desire in men. The advertisement,
printed under the guise of "Official Publication of
Stamford Center for Male Research" mimicked the
University name but has no identifiable origin.
"I never said anything they've quoted me as
saying." Davidson said, "and the patients they
quote do not exist."
A similar erroneous report in The Star, a super
market tabloid, has been retracted at the Univer
sity's request, said Susan deJongh-kearl, Univer
sity associate staff counsel.
DeJongh-Kearl told the Medical Center News
Bureau that advertisers promoting yohimbine as a
drug for human use have used Stanford and David

son's name and work in an "improper and unaut
horized manner."
"The University is concerned that consumers will
be contused by this literature and incorrectly
believe that Stanford University has developed or
endorses the use of these drugs," deJongh-Kearl
said. "The University is taking appropriate steps to
halt this commercial use of its name."
Davidson said the mail-order yohimbine is being
marketed by "obviously sleazy operations with no
medical credentials."
"There is no connection between these mail
order drugs and Davidson's research," deJongh-
Kearl said.
Davidson said the fictitious reports have created
much interest. "The fact that the word
'aphrodisiac' was mentioned with Stanford Univer
sity has created a great deal of excitement." David
son said. "A lot of guys around the world have
been writing asking for help."
According to Davidson, the cost of raw
yohimbine bark jumped from $5 to $9 a pound
within a short time of the advertisement's publica
tion. 1
Although he is now conducting a similar study of
the drug's effect on humans, Davidson said it is
wrong to conclude that yohimbine will have similar
effects on males. "We're doing a study, but we're
being very quiet about it because we don't have any
results yet. Davidson said.
