# Gays picket White
## Supreme Court justice is target of protest 
### CLAIRE MOREL-SEYTOUX 
Waving signs saying "No Bill of
Rights for Gays/Lesbians" and "You
can't white out gay rights," gay and
lesbian rights activists picketed
Friday afternoon against the partici
pation of U.S. Supreme Court Justice
Byron White as a judge in the finals
of Stanford Law School's moot court
competition at Kresge Auditorium.
The protest, organized by the
Committee against Supreme Court
Homophobia, attracted a crowd of
about 40 people, most of whom were
students from the New College of
California School of Law in San Fran
cisco, where the committee is based.
The protesters said that the Su
preme Court, and White in particular,
has consistently refused to apply fun
damental constitutional rights to gays
and lesbians because of homophobia.
According to Mary Perdue, the com
mittee spokeswoman, "Justice White
has never voted to uphold the Consti
tutional rights of lesbian and gay
people."
The hypothetical case argued in the
33rd annual competition involved
two main issues. The first was
whether a statute proscribing
homosexual sodomy unconstitution
ally abridges an individual's right to
privacy. The second was whether an
yidividual Can sue the government for
/./he violation of that right to privacy.
Because of White's record on
gay and lesbian rights, Perdue said
she felt that it would be
"hypocritical" for White to preside at
the competition. "White can't be ob
jective," she said.
The protesters moved inside
Kresge just before the moot court
proceedings began. Sitting in the
front row, they sealed their mouths
with black tape to symbolize the
silencing of gay and lesbian rights and
raised their hands in protest each
time they heard what they considered
a homophobic statement.
Two such statements were
"homosexuality is harmful to society"

and "homosexual activity directly
harms the family." Both statements
were made by law student Matthew
Greenberg as part of his case against
a homosexual's right of privacy.
When asked if the presence of the
protesters had disturbed him, Green
berg said, "I support the reasons for

the protest . . . (but) the protest is in
appropriate here." Greenberg em
phasized that he did not advocate the
position he was arguing.
He further explained that it might
be fortunate White was presiding as a
judge because it was an opportunity
for White to become educated on is
sues of gay and lesbian rights: It could
be "a good practice for White" and
could provide a way for him "to hear
the issues and see what he thinks."
Catherine Glaze, a member of the
moot court board, said that the par
ticipants were judged on "which
side argued its case best" and "not on
the merits of the arguments."
The protesters felt pleased with the
results of the competition because
White, along with two other judges,

selected law students Carole Cooke
and Kirby Heller as this year's best
team. Cooke and Heller had argued
in favor of a homosexual's right of
privacy. Cooke was also named the
competition's best oralist, and Green
berg and Susan Bernhardt were
recognized for writing the best brief.

Mark Dupont, a member of the
Gay and Lesbian Law Students Asso
ciation, was pleased with both the
protest and the competition. The
protesters, he said, did an
"outstanding job of talking to indi
viduals." He agreed with Greenberg's
sentiment that the competition was
an educational experience for all in
volved.
Dupont, who is also a member of
the Gay and Lesbian Alliance at
Stanford, said that individuals from
GLAS supported the protest, but that
the organization as a whole had not
involved itself with the protest.

member, explained GLAS' lack of

participation, saying members were
"basically too busy" this week to
volunteer their time.
However, GLAS member Gerard
Koskovich criticized the protest,
saying that although he supported the
premise, the tactics of the protest
were not constructive.

"On the one hand, the Supreme
Court has been grotesquely cowardly
on issues concerning civil rights for
gay men and lesbians," Koskovich
said. "On the other hand, I haven't
seen anything to show Justice White
is uniquely responsible. 1 personally
feel that a picket line is a somewhat
simple-minded response and that an
educational protest of some sort — a
teach-in, an alternative moot court —
would be a more appropriate
response."
