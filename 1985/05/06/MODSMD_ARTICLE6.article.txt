Soviet Ambassador Analoly Dobrynin tours campus yesterday
morning.
While passing through the Quad,
Dobrynin expressed interest in the
sit-in for divestment, and most
notably the organization of the
protest. Johnson, who is also a mem
ber of Stanford Out of South Africa

(SOSA), the organizer of the sit-in,
said Dobrynin "was curious about"
Stanford's holdings and commented
that the current protest movement
was more practical than those of the
19605. According to Johnson, the
ambassador was especially interested
to hear that SOSA decisions are
made by consensus.
Johnson said the ambassador com

mented on very little during the tour
and "mainly asked questions."
Katarena Dobrynin, 15, echoed
her grandfather's sentiments at the
end of the tour. She told The Daily
she was "very impressed" with what
she had seen of the campus.
The group finished a campus tour
at 10:30 a.m., spent some time at the

Stanford Museum, and then
brunched at the home of Robert
Freelen, vice president for public af
fairs. Freelen said the group also in
cluded Robert Simon, assistant dean
of the business school, Michael Yan
ney, a personal friend of the
Dobrynins from Omaha, Neb., and
their families. Yanney's daughter,
Lisa, is a freshman in Lagunita.
