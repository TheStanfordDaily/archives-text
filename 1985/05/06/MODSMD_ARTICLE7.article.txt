Thatcher raps Japan's trade policy
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said yesterday she had
warned Japan's prime minister at the Bonn economic summit that Japan
must act quickly to reform its trade policy, which she said can be so un
fair it "sticks in my gullet."
But she said she fears the Japanese won't do enough to avoid
retaliatory sanctions.
Thatcher spoke in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview one
day after the end of the summit meeting, held in the West German capi
tal by leaders of seven major industrial nations — the United States,
Canada, West Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Japan.
London newspapers, whose correspondents were briefed after the
summit ended, reported on yesterday that Thatcher had been exception
ally blunt with Japan's prime minister, Yasuhiro Nakasone, during their
45-minute meeting.
The papers described her as particularly angry over the loss of a con
tract with Turkey to build a second bridge over the Bosporus.
The Mail said the $540 million contract was "hijacked" by the
Japanese, who offered four times as much in special credits as the British
government did in backing a British-led construction consortium.
"I wanted it desperately," Thatcher said of the contract in the inter
view, recorded yesterday at her country retreat, Chequers.
"It really is very irritating — very irritating — and deeply disappoint
ing and a bitter blow when we keep our markets open to the Japanese, as
a result of which they make very good profits which enables then" to give
credit larger than any we can give on projects in third countries.
"That's what sticks in my gullet," she said, her voice rising with em
phasis. "That's what I complain about."
Thatcher said that in her talk with Nakasone, she urged prompt action
to clear away bureaucratic barriers that foreign firms must overcome
before they can sell in Japanese markets.
"Mr. Nakasone really is doing his best to open up Japanese markets,"
she said. "I'm just worried that even though I know he has the will to
open them up, that's not going to be enough for our purposes."
French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said in Paris yesterday that
despite differences bared at the summit, Europeans need to be "strong,
united and coordinated" in the face of the United States and Japan.
Six killed in Green Line battle
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Christian and Moslem militias dueled with
tanks, mortars and grenades along Beirut's dividing line yesterday,
giving residential districts the worst shelling since the sectarian warfare
began again eight days ago.
Police said six people were killed and 30 wounded in fighting over
night and during the day along the Green Line, the three-mile-long
demarcation between the capital's Christian and Moslem sectors.
A French Defense Ministry statement issued in Paris said an aide to
French Defense Minister Charles Hernu suffered slight wounds when "a
few shells" fell on the former French ambassador's residence.
The new casualties raised the overall toll in Beirut fighting to 29 killed
and 183 wounded since April 28.
Moves were reported to reconvene the nine-member coalition
Cabinet, which last week split over sectarian differences as President
Amin Gemayel, a Maronite Christian, sought ways to end the
bloodshed.
But with the year-old government paralyzed, there was no immediate
sign of a halt in the fighting, the latest spasm in Lebanon's 10-year-old
civil war.
Shiite Moslem fighters and their Druse allies fired barrages from jeep
mounted mortars and multi-barreled rocket launchers into Christian
areas east of the Green Line.
Christian militiamen and Christian units of the Lebanese army
responded with tank and rocket-propelled grenade fire.
All six crossings between predominantly Christian east Beirut and
Moslem west Beirut were closed.
Soviets: 'Star Wars' threatens peace
MOSCOW — Soviet Defense Minister Sergei Sokolov said yesterday
that U.S. "Star Wars" research poses a greater hazard to peace than the
atomic bomb, and vowed to see that the Soviet Union is defended
against such a threat.
The 73-year-old career soldier accused the United States of seeking
military superiority over the Soviet Union since the end of World War
11.
In an interview published yesterday, Sokolov called "outright
demagoguery" Pentagon assurances that the Strategic Defense Initia
tive, commonly called "Star Wars," would make nuclear weapons ob
solete.
Sokolov denied that the Soviets are researching their own space-based
anti-missile system. He said Soviet military scientific research is
restricted to "perfection of space early warning, reconnaissance, com
munication and navigation systems."
The interview with the official news agency Tass was published in a
question-and-answer format on the front page of Sunday editions of Red
Star, the Defense Ministry newspaper. »
The defense minister's comments reiterated longstanding Kremlin
military policy, including the claim that the nuclear arsenals of the super
powers are now roughly equal, and that U.S. efforts to develop the Stra
tegic Defense Initiative threaten to upset this balance.
The interview was Sokolov's first major statement on Soviet military
policy since he became defense minister on Dec. 22, 1984, two days
after the death of his predecessor, Marshal Dmitri Ustinov.
U.N. official visits Ethiopian camp
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — Kurt Jansson, a U.N. assistant
secretary-general, flew to the northern Gondar region yesterday to de
termine if thousands of famine victims were forcibly evicted from Ethi
opia's largest refugee center.
Jansson was expected to return to the Ethiopian capital of Addis
Ababa today after talking to some of the 56,000 refugees who left the
Ibnet camp. He was to discuss his findings with President Mcngusti Haile
Mariam.
Ethiopian officials have strongly denied news reports quoting interna
tional relief workers as saying the famine victims were forcibly removed
by troops and their makeshift huts burned down.
I he Marxist regime maintains the refugees left voluntarily to plant
crops in their native villages because rain has alleviated drought condi
tions in those areas. On Saturday, a government statement accused the
Reagan administration of going "berserk once again" in an anti-
Ethiopian campaign.
Photographs taken during the April 28-30 evacuation and made
available to The Associated Press yesterday showed scorched plots of
earth where the shelters reportedly had stood.
Belgian air force pilots assisting the international relief effort reported
seeing thousands of marchers on Saturday who were believed to have
left Ibnet and were heading toward Axum, site of another large emer
gency feeding center.
Relief workers said they feared many of the elderly, sick and starving
who were forced out of Ibnet would die.
An estimated 10,000 men, women and children have hidden in the
hills surrounding the Ibnet camp and did not join the exodus ordered by
the regional chairman, Melaku Tcfari, relief sources said.
Farrakhan visits Libya
TRIPOLI, l.ibya — U.S. Black Muslim leader Louis Farrakhan. who
sa\s he has received a business loan from Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Khadafy. has arrived in Tripoli, the official Libyan news agency JANA
reported yesterday.
"Our visit is a reaffirmation of friendship and of the joint struggle to
liberate the oppressed all over the world." Farrakhan was quoted as tel
ling JANA when he arrived at the airport Saturday.
The report did not say if Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam sect,
would meet with Khadafy.

The 73-year-old career soldier accused the United States of seeking
military superiority over the Soviet Union since the end of World War
11.
In an interview published yesterday, Sokolov called "outright
demagoguery" Pentagon assurances that the Strategic Defense Initia
tive, commonly called "Star Wars," would make nuclear weapons ob
solete.
Sokolov denied that the Soviets are researching their own space-based
anti-missile system. He said Soviet military scientific research is
restricted to "perfection of space early warning, reconnaissance, com
munication and navigation systems."
The interview with the official news agency Tass was published in a
question-and-answer format on the front page of Sunday editions of Red
Star, the Defense Ministry newspaper. »
The defense minister's comments reiterated longstanding Kremlin
military policy, including the claim that the nuclear arsenals of the super
powers are now roughly equal, and that U.S. efforts to develop the Stra
tegic Defense Initiative threaten to upset this balance.
The interview was Sokolov's first major statement on Soviet military
policy since he became defense minister on Dec. 22, 1984, two days
after the death of his predecessor, Marshal Dmitri Ustinov.
U.N. official visits Ethiopian camp
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — Kurt Jansson, a U.N. assistant
secretary-general, flew to the northern Gondar region yesterday to de
termine if thousands of famine victims were forcibly evicted from Ethi
opia's largest refugee center.
Jansson was expected to return to the Ethiopian capital of Addis
Ababa today after talking to some of the 56,000 refugees who left the
Ibnet camp. He was to discuss his findings with President Mcngusti Haile
Mariam.
Ethiopian officials have strongly denied news reports quoting interna
tional relief workers as saying the famine victims were forcibly removed
by troops and their makeshift huts burned down.
I he Marxist regime maintains the refugees left voluntarily to plant
crops in their native villages because rain has alleviated drought condi
tions in those areas. On Saturday, a government statement accused the
Reagan administration of going "berserk once again" in an anti-
Ethiopian campaign.
Photographs taken during the April 28-30 evacuation and made
available to The Associated Press yesterday showed scorched plots of
earth where the shelters reportedly had stood.
Belgian air force pilots assisting the international relief effort reported
seeing thousands of marchers on Saturday who were believed to have
left Ibnet and were heading toward Axum, site of another large emer
gency feeding center.
Relief workers said they feared many of the elderly, sick and starving
who were forced out of Ibnet would die.
An estimated 10,000 men, women and children have hidden in the
hills surrounding the Ibnet camp and did not join the exodus ordered by
the regional chairman, Melaku Tcfari, relief sources said.
Farrakhan visits Libya
TRIPOLI, l.ibya — U.S. Black Muslim leader Louis Farrakhan. who
sa\s he has received a business loan from Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Khadafy. has arrived in Tripoli, the official Libyan news agency JANA
reported yesterday.
"Our visit is a reaffirmation of friendship and of the joint struggle to
liberate the oppressed all over the world." Farrakhan was quoted as tel
ling JANA when he arrived at the airport Saturday.
The report did not say if Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam sect,
would meet with Khadafy.
Thatcher raps Japan's trade policy
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said yesterday she had
warned Japan's prime minister at the Bonn economic summit that Japan
must act quickly to reform its trade policy, which she said can be so un
fair it "sticks in my gullet."
But she said she fears the Japanese won't do enough to avoid
retaliatory sanctions.
Thatcher spoke in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview one
day after the end of the summit meeting, held in the West German capi
tal by leaders of seven major industrial nations — the United States,
Canada, West Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Japan.
London newspapers, whose correspondents were briefed after the
summit ended, reported on yesterday that Thatcher had been exception
ally blunt with Japan's prime minister, Yasuhiro Nakasone, during their
45-minute meeting.
The papers described her as particularly angry over the loss of a con
tract with Turkey to build a second bridge over the Bosporus.
The Mail said the $540 million contract was "hijacked" by the
Japanese, who offered four times as much in special credits as the British
government did in backing a British-led construction consortium.
"I wanted it desperately," Thatcher said of the contract in the inter
view, recorded yesterday at her country retreat, Chequers.
"It really is very irritating — very irritating — and deeply disappoint
ing and a bitter blow when we keep our markets open to the Japanese, as
a result of which they make very good profits which enables then" to give
credit larger than any we can give on projects in third countries.
"That's what sticks in my gullet," she said, her voice rising with em
phasis. "That's what I complain about."
Thatcher said that in her talk with Nakasone, she urged prompt action
to clear away bureaucratic barriers that foreign firms must overcome
before they can sell in Japanese markets.
"Mr. Nakasone really is doing his best to open up Japanese markets,"
she said. "I'm just worried that even though I know he has the will to
open them up, that's not going to be enough for our purposes."
French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said in Paris yesterday that
despite differences bared at the summit, Europeans need to be "strong,
united and coordinated" in the face of the United States and Japan.
Six killed in Green Line battle
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Christian and Moslem militias dueled with
tanks, mortars and grenades along Beirut's dividing line yesterday,
giving residential districts the worst shelling since the sectarian warfare
began again eight days ago.
Police said six people were killed and 30 wounded in fighting over
night and during the day along the Green Line, the three-mile-long
demarcation between the capital's Christian and Moslem sectors.
A French Defense Ministry statement issued in Paris said an aide to
French Defense Minister Charles Hernu suffered slight wounds when "a
few shells" fell on the former French ambassador's residence.
The new casualties raised the overall toll in Beirut fighting to 29 killed
and 183 wounded since April 28.
Moves were reported to reconvene the nine-member coalition
Cabinet, which last week split over sectarian differences as President
Amin Gemayel, a Maronite Christian, sought ways to end the
bloodshed.
But with the year-old government paralyzed, there was no immediate
sign of a halt in the fighting, the latest spasm in Lebanon's 10-year-old
civil war.
Shiite Moslem fighters and their Druse allies fired barrages from jeep
mounted mortars and multi-barreled rocket launchers into Christian
areas east of the Green Line.
Christian militiamen and Christian units of the Lebanese army
responded with tank and rocket-propelled grenade fire.
All six crossings between predominantly Christian east Beirut and
Moslem west Beirut were closed.
Soviets: 'Star Wars' threatens peace
MOSCOW — Soviet Defense Minister Sergei Sokolov said yesterday
that U.S. "Star Wars" research poses a greater hazard to peace than the
atomic bomb, and vowed to see that the Soviet Union is defended
against such a threat.

military superiority over the Soviet Union since the end of World War
