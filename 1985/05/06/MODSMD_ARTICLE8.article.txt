## Reagan visits Bitburg cemetery 
### 
BITBURG, West Germany — President
Reagan, making a determined gesture of reconcili
ation against a backdrop of protest, led an austere
wreath-laying ceremony yesterday at the small mil
itary cemetery here that holds gravestones of Ger
man war dead and SS troopers.
To mute the storm of protest arising from his
homage at the graves of Nazis, Reagan spent an
earlier hour at a concentration camp where 50,000
Jews and gentiles were put to death by Adolf Hit
ler's 12-year dictatorship.
"The horror cannot outlast the hope," the presi
dent said there — his message to those who accused
him of ignoring the Nazi horrors.
Reagan, in one of the most controversial acts of
his presidency, spent only eight minutes in silence
at the Kolmeshohe Cemetery in Bitburg with West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on a dank, gray
day.
Neither spoke. Soldiers carried two wreaths of
brightly colored flowers to the base of a slate tower.
Close by two SS gravestones, the two leaders stood,
tight-lipped, their hands on the flowers before
them.
A bugler played "I Had a Comrade," the Ger

man equivalent of "Taps." Then Reagan and Kohl
walked over to shake hands with spectators, includ
ing German Army Col. Berthold von Stauffenberg,
whose father, Claus, was executed for trying to as
sassinate Hitler. The two leaders got in their
limousines — two minutes ahead of schedule.
Reagan looked tired following two days of
meetings with the leaders of seven industrial
democracies at an economic summit meeting at
Bonn that ended Saturday.
In the town of Bitburg, supporters waving little
American flags lined the streets, but they were
overshadowed by jeering demonstrators from the
United States, France, West Germany and 14 other
countries.
Many of the protesters were students wearing the
yellow, six-pointed Star of David that their
forebears were forced to wear during Hitler's
repression.
Before Reagan arrived, police armed with riot
gear scuffled for five minutes with 200 demonstra
tors, who chanted, "Never again." There were no
arrests.
Back at Bergen-Belsen, 220 miles to the north,
after Reaonn 50 demonstmtorc. mnstlv Ameri

can Jews belonging to the New York City-based In
ternational Network of Children of Holocaust Sur
vivors, were allowed in.
Following the wreath-laying at Bitburg, Reagan
drove to the nearby U.S. air base. Standing before
U.S. and German soldiers, he addressed the con
cerns he had aroused.
"Some old wounds have been reopened, and this
I regret very much, because this should be a time of
healing," he said, but he added that God — not he
— had judged the deeds of the men buried there.
One of the SS troopers was a boy of 15, a con
script, Reagan said, and "There were thousands of
such soldiers to whom Nazism meant no more than
a brutal end to a short life. We do not believe in
collective guilt."
Reagan said the cemetery contained the graves
of 48 SS men. Most news accounts and a physical
count by an Associated Press reporter previously
had put the number at 49.
Peter Sommer, an aide to Reagan's National Se
curity Council, said the Berlin Documents Center,
a records agency established after World War 11,
put the number of SS graves at 48.
