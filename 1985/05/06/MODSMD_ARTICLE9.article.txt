BITBURG, West Germany â€”
President Reagan's visit to the mili
tary cemetery inspired jeers, chants
and whistles of opposition here and
around the world yesterday. But
cheers were heard too, as many Ger
mans thanked Reagan for defying a
storm of criticism to honor their war
dead.
A handful of protesters shouted
"Please don't go" as Reagan's
motorcade carried him through the
narrow streets of this small farming
community to the graveyard in the
nearby hills.
Several thousand people lined the
streets to see the president's
limousine motorcade speed by.
Protesters' chants were matched at
times by cheers from supporters.
Posters and banners were held aloft
amid the throngs.
"They killed my family," read one.
"Why, Mr. President?" queried an
other.
Along the way to the nearby U.S.
Air Force base, the president also
viewed signs of support: "Hail to the
Chief," "Welcome President R.
Reagan," and "Thanks for liberty."
About 20 minutes before
passed through the center of Bitburg,*r
25 German police equipped with riot
gear charged into a group of about
200 Jewish students and their sup
porters. The scuffle broke up after
about five minutes, and no arrests

were reported.
Demonstrators also greeted
Reagan and Kohl earlier, when they
went to the Bergen-Belsen concen
tration camp about 220 miles to the
north.
Objecting to the Bitburg stop, they
shouted: "Mr. Reagan, don't go
there. You don't belong there. We
don't want you there."
After the two leaders left the death
camp, about 50 people, most of them
American Jews who are the children
of Holocaust survivors, were allowed
onto the grounds to conduct their
own memorial service.
"Bergen-Belsen has today been ex
ploited for the political interests of
these two men, and the sanctity of
this place has been violated," said
Menachem Rosensaft. "Never until
today has anyone dared to use these
graves as part of an attempt to
rehabilitate the SS."
In the United States, about 700
people gathered at Arlington Na
tional Cemetery near Washington,
about 400 gathered in Philidelphia
and a dozen people held a candlelight
vigil in downtown Cincinnati to
protest Reagan's Bitburg visit. In
Chicago, about 7,000 people
marched.
In Israel, about 100 protesters
gathered outside the U.S. Embassy in
Tel Aviv.
