The Courtesy
"Alan Shapiro's The Courtesy is a collection of poems
balancing a wrv and altogether individual sensibility with
and against an unobtrusive technical control; a young poet
whose work, as it was said of Tonio Kroger's, is full of
humor and acquaintance with pain. My own favorite of
these pieces is "Simon, the Barber," a small masterpiece of
depiction comparable with Chaucer's Pardoner and
Kafka's Doorkeeper— 'I was your only customer' —in The
Trial." —Howard Netnerov
