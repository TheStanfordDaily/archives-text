Challenger lands safely
EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE — Laden
with scientific treasures from a week of orbital
research, Challenger brought seven astronauts
and 26 animals down safely in the California des
ert yesterday — triggering sonic booms that set
off burglar alarms as it descended.
The stubby-winged space shuttle touched
down on the centerline of a dry lake bed runway
at 9:11 a.m., completing a flight of 2.9 million
miles and 109 orbits.
"Challenger, welcome home," called out Mis
sion Control as commander Bob Overmyer
brought the shuttle to a stop. "Nice job. Bob."
The ship's return touched off twin sonic booms
over Los Angeles as it flew over the city and

headed eastward to the desert. The booms rattled
windows, setting off burglar alarms throughout
the area.
Tucked into the Spacelab 3 module in Chal
lenger's cargo bay is enough research data to fill
50,000 volumes of 200 pages each, said Spacelab
mission manager Joseph Cremin. There also are
miles of film and more than 3 million frames of
video data, some of which will be studied by sci
entists frame by frame, he said.
Two small squirrel monkeys and 24 rats, riding
in special cages in Spacelab 3, were to be
removed quickly and flown to Cape Canaveral,
where they will be examined and tested. The rats
will be sacrificed and dissected. Medical re
searchers hope to learn from them more about
the effects of weightlessness.

Though the landing went smoothly, there was
one false alarm two hours before the descent
began, when the astronauts received a warning
that the 60-foot-long, clamshel|-Jikc cargo
doors had failed to close properly.
Schroeder hospitalized
LOUISVILLE, Ky. — William Schroeder, the
first and only artificial heart recipient to be
released from a hospital, was returned to the
facility yesterday after suffering a brain hemor
rhage, officials said.
Schroeder, who had been described as listless
and too weak to leave his bed before being ad
mitted, was listed in critical, but stable, condition,
Robert Irvine, Humana Hospital Audubon,
Humana Inc. spokesman, said.
The origin of the hemorrhage was unknown,
he said.
Asked if the situation was life threatening,
Irvine said: "At this point, they are trying to de
termine just what the situation is. It is critical, but
stable."
Schroeder, who was well enough to go fishing
14 days after being released from the hospital,
was returned there at 4 p.m. EDT for a CAT
scan, a test that takes pictures of the brain, said
Donna Hazle, public relations, director for the
hospital.
Irvine said that the scan indicated Schroeder
had suffered from bleeding in his brain, and that
doctors believed the bleeding had stopped.
Stocks climb slightly
The stock market emerged from a sluggish ses
sion clinging to a small gain yesterday.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
4.97 on Friday, rose another .55 to 1,247.79.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
slowed to 85.65 million shares from 94.87 mil
lion Friday
