Alzheimer's cure near
SAN FRANCISCO — A breakthrough in ge
netic research to discover the cause of
Alzheimer's disease, a disorder afflicting more
than 3 million older Americans, may be made
within "six months . . . depending on luck and
funding," a scientist said yesterday at a national
conference.
"We're all holding our breath." said Peter
Davies. a researcher at the Albert Einstein Col
lege of Medicine in New York. "I think it's com
ing. This thing's going to be wide open in 10
years. It's going to be cracked."
Alzheimer's disease is a brain disorder that
causes memory loss or serious mental deteriora
tion. It affects about seven percent of the popula
tion over 65 years old. claims 120.000 lives a
year in the United States, and resulted in $34 bil
lion in nursing home costs in 19K4. according to
Jerome Stone, president of the National
Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders As
sociation.
"It has become known as the disease that robs
the mind of the victim and steals the heart of the

family," said Stone.
Hundreds of researchers in a half-dozen labo
ratories in the United States are studying possible
genetic causes of the disease under federally
funded programs. Congress has alloted $43 mil
lion for overall research in 1986, but only $10
million for basic research in laboratories. Davies
called the basic research grants "pathetic."
Davies expects a breakthrough within "six
months to four years" in finding the key to the
disease.
Most of laboratory work is focusing on the
genes carried by "chromosome 21." Humans
have 23 pairs of chromosomes, and the pair des
ignated No. 21 has been linked to victims of
Down's syndrome, who have an extra
chromosome 21.
"There are two links between Alzheimer's and
Down's syndrome," Davies said. "If you have
Down's and live past 40, you develop the identi
cal pathology of Alzheimer's. The second link is
if you can identify families with Alzheimer's,
they're three times more likely than normal to
give birth to Down's syndrome children."

Slaying investigated
SAN DIEGO — The Border Crimes Task
Force comprised of San Diego police officers and
U.S. Border Patrol agents is staying out of the
canyons where an agent was shot while the case is
being investigated, authorities said yesterday.
The task force's assignment is to watch for and
arrest bandits who prey on undocumented aliens
illegally crossing into the United States.
The emphasis on other duties is normal follow
ing any law enforcement shooting, said Gene
Smithburg. assistant chief Border Patrol agent in
the San Diego area.
Border Patrol agent Fred Stevens, 39, was in
good condition yesterday at UC-San Diego
Medical Center, where he was being treated for
gunshot wounds in the groin, left wrist and hip, a
hospital spokeswoman said. Stevens' bullet-proof
vest blocked two other shots.
Today's weather
Mostly cloudy today with highs near 70. West
winds to 25 mph. Low clouds and fog tonight and
tomorrow with clearing during the day.
