## Moon, man, woman and midnight at Stanford 
### 
Dear Bug Me,
Where did that stupid tradition of
kissing in the Quad at midnight come
from, and what percentage of senior
females are "Stanford women?" -
Madeline Marsh
I talked to Peter Allen, who started
his studies here in 1934 and was later
the editor of the alumni review, and
he couldn't remember a time when
that "stupid tradition" didn't exist.
It was just one of many social tradi
tions, I guess, most of which have
faded away. My favorite was the so
called family tradition of saying a
hearty hello to everyone you pass in
the Quad.

One could speculate that with the
sexual revolution — whenever that
was, it isn't predicted in Marx — a
friendly salutation took on new impli
cations, hut it seems that "women"
predated even this cordiality.
Whatever its history, four out of 10
senior females surveyed admit to
being traditional Stanford women, al
though it's not necessarily something
they put on their resumes.
These results are brought to you
from the rigorously scientific Bug Me
survey service. In other words, I
talked to the first 10 "F4" listings in
the student directory who answered
the phone, and, through prolonged
mental calculations, brought you that
statistic.
The reactions of the women to the
tradition in general were mild.
One "woman" said it was roman
tic, while another said that it was kind
of'fun, but that she hadn't really
thought about it since.
The reactions from other senior
females were a little bit stronger.
"I think it's awfully bad. I don't
define myself by whether I've been
kissed by a man," one respondent
said. Others said they just hadn't got
ten around to going down to the
Quad on a full moon like last Satur
day's. Another said she felt the whole
tradition was "pretty bogus. It's
something to talk about more than
ajHything olse.'-' '
, At least it's something to Wrftd'
about.
I hope that you can clear up a question
about the kiss-in-the-Quad tradition.

Everyone knows that to become a
Stanford woman, a female must be
kissed by a senior guy in the Quad, at
midnight, under a full moon. What
does it take to become a Stanford
man? I've heard three different stories.
One says that getting a fat envelope
from Dean Fred (or now Dean Jean)
automatically makes a male a Stan
ford man. I've also been told some
thing about the 50-yard line and a new
moon. The third version is a little
more in keeping with modern thought
hid 'ctyttdlfly of'the 'styes' and states
that a guy becomes a Stanford man by
being kissed by a senior woman.
There is some evidence for the last
story; the 1980 "Approaching Stan

ford" includes a quote in the margin
describing a frosh male being kissed
and turning into a Stanford man. Just
to be complete, a friend asserts that all
this kissing only "works" on the first
full moon of fall quarter. Please tell
me he's wrong - I'm a fifth-year
senior, and I'd hate to think / missed
my chance. - Need To Know Soon
You know, the wonderful thing
about traditions is that they don't fol
low their own rules. If enough people
started thinking that they couldn't
reach Stanford adulthood' Withou- 1 "
kissing toads, the lake would he busy
with would-be princes and princesses
and the tradition would move out of
the Quad.

Frankly, I think the tradition the
way it is now is fine, never having
aspired to being a Stanford man, but I
can see your problem.
Maybe if you used your position as
a senior to add to the number of Stan
ford women, the effect would be
mutual. There are still a couple full
moons left in the year.
I think whatever version of the
tradition will make you feel most like
a Stanford man should do. If you
believe in your transformation, I
"'tton't see why others wouldn't. T'm
not sure about the proper etiquette
for declaring your Stanford manhood
on a resume. See the answer to the
question above.

/ have noticed that the liberal arts
departments are on the left side of the
campus and the science and engineer
ing departments are on the right. A
friend of mine told me this was
planned due to the traditional political
leanings of these groups. Does my
friend's statement hold water, or is he
all wet? - Aqua Ambidextrous
My roommate, who is taking Philip
Zimbardo's psych class along with
about half of the students in the area,
was my best source tjf ojticjaj infor
mation onceagain.
She said to tell you that her favorite
science has determined that the left
side of the human brain is more scien
tific, and the right side is more crea

tive. This translates to right-handed
people developing techie leanings
and lefties going into the liberal arts,
it \ou believe the old trivial datum
that the body's nerves get all crossed
up on their way to the brain and it
you then want to speculate about it all
over the place.
I could get no official statement on
whether the hand one writes with
determines political views, or even
whether it affects which way you veer
when you walk, which might explain
the placement of certain buildings to
maximize the different veering ten
dencies of these two groups.
There should be studies done.
But 1 did analyze your h* pothesis a
little bit to see how well it matched
with a campus map. and I found some
interesting conclusions.
I found it an interesting contrast,
and something of a refreshing change,
that the Hoover Institution and its
obelisk should be on the left and The
Daily should be on the right.
Also, lawyers are only slightly to
the left of center when you bisect the
campus on a line continuing from
Palm Drive, while doctors are prob
ably fascists judging from their posi
tion in the building the farthest to the
right of any on the campus.
If I might expand your generaliza
tion a little (it really couldn't hurt), it
can be shown that students sleeping
in Meyer, working for the ASSU in
Tresidder, or just being proto-
Yuppies at the Graduate School of
Business, are all similarly left
leaning, while alumni are headquar
tered a little right of center.
An analysis of departments does
support your theory in a majority of
cases, except for the confusing En
glish Department, which has listings
on both sides of the dividing line.
University President Donald Ken
nedy's office is on the left, and his
house is on the right. 1 make no con
clusions.
All year long, I've been holding the
map upside down — it makes more
sense that way when you're starting
out from Flo Mo. This gives me a
unique. Dish-based view of the world
and also literally overturns any hopes
about a correlation between campus
position and political positions.
So much for order in the universe.
Why are parking spaces marked for
40 minutes when classes are 50
minutes long? - Jason Cole
This is a cause-and-effect relation

classes were an hour long, people
would probably be able to park for 50

Like a great many traditions, it's hard to figure out exactly when kissing
in the Quad under a full moon at midnight started. But the tradition

endures, and now the question at Stanford is whether man is created by
woman, or woman created by man.
minutes, for example.
"The parking committee did it that
way so students don't park in them to
go to class," he said.
The purpose of a time limit for this
parking committee is to get more
turnover of cars in the few spaces
available so that each person will
have a greater chance of finding a
spot.
He said that the committee doesn't
want to keep students from parking if
they are doing errands or making
short stops.
There are plans to put meters on
the spaces near Tresidder some time
this year to help turnover, also.
Where do the white envelopes next
to vending machines go and do they
ever get sent back to the person re
questing a refund? (I have sent in
about three in the last two years and
never got a refund back.) - Don
Gardner
Like many of the great mysteries of
the world — where dust comes from,
where all the lost ball point pens
migrate to, and why hot dogs come in
packages of 10 when buns come in
eights — this question keeps me up
nights.
Now, I like to sleep every once in a
while, so the first thing I did was to

picture where I would be if l were a
little white envelope with money for
some guy named Don.
After mailing myself to Hawaii for
a nice long weekend. I had an identity
crisis and turned back into a
deadline-ridden writer, though, and
started making calls to Escondido
Village's housing management office,
which handles all the refunds for the
vending machine contract with Can
teen Corporation of San Jose.
I talked to the secretary in that of
fice who didn't want her name
printed because of all the extra mail
she anticipated if her identity was
made known to angry Fanta drinkers
across campus.
She was sympathetic to your case,
though, and suggested that the en
velopes could have gotten lost in the
interdepartmental or postal mail
either going or coming. It should have
taken about three weeks if nothing
went wrong.
"A lot of people complain but
never do anything about it," she said
defensively. She contends that if a
refund request gets to her office, it is
usually handled properly.
"I send quite a bit of money out,"
she explained. There is usually no
questioning of authenticity in order to
detect abuse of the white envelope
system, but she said she would prob
ably notice names if they started ap
pearing often.
In other words, it would probably
be more profitable to supplement

your tuition in other ways.
If you sincerely want to use the
vending machines on campus,
though, and don't want your money
back at some time in the future as
much as you want you junk food fix
immediately, then I'd suggest a psy
chological approach.
Vending machines have definite
characteristics, although I wouldn't
attribute whole personalities to them.
Some otherwise friendly, well
rounded Coke machines just will not
tolerate dimes, making it twice as
hard to buy a drink from them be
cause the thirsty individual then must
scrounge two nickels for every dime
the machine drops in the change
return slot.
Machines of the food variety are
even more complex. The al
phabetized array of buttons has 26
different ways of responding to a
simple Snickers request. You have to
find just the right jabbing technique
to hit a caloric jackpot.
Some buttons are just obviously
the coarse, thumb-prod variety, while
others may cry out for a gentle tap
with the traditional index finger.
There's probably something in the
Kama Sutra about the nine different
ways to punch or poke a vending ma
chine, but I'll leave that research to
you since you may want to develop
your own personal style, a sure fire
method to achieve Almond Joy.
