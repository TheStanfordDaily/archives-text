## Moon, man, woman and midnight at Stanford 
### 
Dear Bug Me,
Where did that stupid tradition of
kissing in the Quad at midnight come
from, and what percentage of senior
females are "Stanford women?" -
Madeline Marsh
I talked to Peter Allen, who started
his studies here in 1934 and was later
the editor of the alumni review, and
he couldn't remember a time when
that "stupid tradition" didn't exist.
It was just one of many social tradi
tions, I guess, most of which have
faded away. My favorite was the so
called family tradition of saying a
hearty hello to everyone you pass in
the Quad.

One could speculate that with the
sexual revolution — whenever that
was, it isn't predicted in Marx — a
friendly salutation took on new impli
cations, hut it seems that "women"
predated even this cordiality.
Whatever its history, four out of 10
senior females surveyed admit to
being traditional Stanford women, al
though it's not necessarily something
they put on their resumes.
These results are brought to you
from the rigorously scientific Bug Me
survey service. In other words, I
talked to the first 10 "F4" listings in
the student directory who answered
the phone, and, through prolonged
mental calculations, brought you that
statistic.
The reactions of the women to the
tradition in general were mild.
One "woman" said it was roman
tic, while another said that it was kind
of'fun, but that she hadn't really
thought about it since.
The reactions from other senior
females were a little bit stronger.
"I think it's awfully bad. I don't
define myself by whether I've been
kissed by a man," one respondent
said. Others said they just hadn't got
ten around to going down to the
Quad on a full moon like last Satur
day's. Another said she felt the whole
tradition was "pretty bogus. It's
something to talk about more than
ajHything olse.'-' '
, At least it's something to Wrftd'
about.
I hope that you can clear up a question
about the kiss-in-the-Quad tradition.

Everyone knows that to become a
Stanford woman, a female must be
kissed by a senior guy in the Quad, at
midnight, under a full moon. What
does it take to become a Stanford
man? I've heard three different stories.
One says that getting a fat envelope
from Dean Fred (or now Dean Jean)
automatically makes a male a Stan
ford man. I've also been told some
thing about the 50-yard line and a new
moon. The third version is a little
more in keeping with modern thought
hid 'ctyttdlfly of'the 'styes' and states
that a guy becomes a Stanford man by
being kissed by a senior woman.
There is some evidence for the last
story; the 1980 "Approaching Stan

ford" includes a quote in the margin
describing a frosh male being kissed
and turning into a Stanford man. Just
to be complete, a friend asserts that all
this kissing only "works" on the first
full moon of fall quarter. Please tell
me he's wrong - I'm a fifth-year
senior, and I'd hate to think / missed
my chance. - Need To Know Soon
You know, the wonderful thing
about traditions is that they don't fol
low their own rules. If enough people
started thinking that they couldn't
reach Stanford adulthood' Withou- 1 "
kissing toads, the lake would he busy
with would-be princes and princesses
and the tradition would move out of
the Quad.

Frankly, I think the tradition the
way it is now is fine, never having
aspired to being a Stanford man, but I
can see your problem.
Maybe if you used your position as
a senior to add to the number of Stan
ford women, the effect would be
mutual. There are still a couple full
moons left in the year.
I think whatever version of the
tradition will make you feel most like
a Stanford man should do. If you
believe in your transformation, I
"'tton't see why others wouldn't. T'm
not sure about the proper etiquette
for declaring your Stanford manhood
on a resume. See the answer to the
question above.

/ have noticed that the liberal arts
departments are on the left side of the
campus and the science and engineer
ing departments are on the right. A
friend of mine told me this was
planned due to the traditional political
leanings of these groups. Does my
friend's statement hold water, or is he
all wet? - Aqua Ambidextrous
My roommate, who is taking Philip
Zimbardo's psych class along with
about half of the students in the area,
was my best source tjf ojticjaj infor
mation onceagain.
She said to tell you that her favorite
science has determined that the left
side of the human brain is more scien
tific, and the right side is more crea

tive. This translates to right-handed
people developing techie leanings
and lefties going into the liberal arts,
it \ou believe the old trivial datum
that the body's nerves get all crossed
up on their way to the brain and it
you then want to speculate about it all
over the place.
I could get no official statement on
whether the hand one writes with
determines political views, or even
whether it affects which way you veer
when you walk, which might explain
the placement of certain buildings to
maximize the different veering ten
dencies of these two groups.
There should be studies done.
But 1 did analyze your h* pothesis a
little bit to see how well it matched
with a campus map. and I found some
interesting conclusions.
I found it an interesting contrast,
and something of a refreshing change,
that the Hoover Institution and its
obelisk should be on the left and The
Daily should be on the right.
Also, lawyers are only slightly to
the left of center when you bisect the
campus on a line continuing from
Palm Drive, while doctors are prob
ably fascists judging from their posi
tion in the building the farthest to the
right of any on the campus.
If I might expand your generaliza
tion a little (it really couldn't hurt), it
can be shown that students sleeping
in Meyer, working for the ASSU in
Tresidder, or just being proto-
Yuppies at the Graduate School of
Business, are all similarly left
leaning, while alumni are headquar
tered a little right of center.
An analysis of departments does
support your theory in a majority of
cases, except for the confusing En
glish Department, which has listings
on both sides of the dividing line.
University President Donald Ken
nedy's office is on the left, and his
house is on the right. 1 make no con
clusions.
All year long, I've been holding the
map upside down — it makes more
sense that way when you're starting
out from Flo Mo. This gives me a
unique. Dish-based view of the world
and also literally overturns any hopes
about a correlation between campus
position and political positions.
So much for order in the universe.
Why are parking spaces marked for
40 minutes when classes are 50
minutes long? - Jason Cole
This is a cause-and-effect relation
ship, according to.Captain Bill Wul
lschleger of the Stanford police. If
classes were an hour long, people
would probably be able to park for 50

Like a great many traditions, it's hard to figure out exactly when kissing
in the Quad under a full moon at midnight started. But the tradition


Russell Jong/ Daily
endures, and now the question at Stanford is whether man is created by
woman, or woman created by man.
