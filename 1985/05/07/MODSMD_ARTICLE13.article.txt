## THE 						STANFORD DAILY On the way to the forum 
### 
Tonight at 5:30, the long-awaited open forum
on divestment with trustees, students, faculty and
other members of the community will begin in
the Inner Quad. Much planning, effort and emo
tion has gone into the event's preparation, and
the end result should be interesting, educational
and even exciting.
Stanford Out of South Africa (SOSA) first
called for the forum when it began a sit-in for
total divestment in front of the President's Office
April 24. The forum is an important step because
it brings both sides face to face in front of the
community. Until today, neither side has had to
directly defend its position against articulate,
considered arguments of the other.
Thirteen Bay Area trustees met with the SOSA
liaison committee last week to plan the forum,
and about a dozen trustees are expected to attend
tonight. In addition, the foru.n will be videotaped
for those trustees unable to attend.
Because the Trustee Committee on Invest
ments will discuss the issue of divestment at its
next meeting — as will the full board on May 14
— it is important that students make their views
known now. Only when that happens will the

trustees realize that they must deal conscien
tiously with the University's investment policy
and that they must emerge with a clear position
on the South African question.
SOSA had hoped to hold the forum in Maples
Pavilion, hut logistical details made it impos
sible. In the end, the decision was made to hold it
in the Inner Quad for reasons of size and con
venience. Everyone knows where the Quad is.
There is plenty of space. The forum is scheduled
for a logical time, and University Food Service
will even open early to serve bag dinners.
But more important than the logistical impetus
to attend are the important intellectual reasons.
No matter how much one knows about the issue,
and no matter how sure one is about a certain po
sition, it is important to hear the specific argu
ments used by both sides.
Everyone should take the opportunity to see
the two sides face to face in the Quad tonight.
Emotions will be running high, but the arguments
will probably be the best prepared and
most articulate renditions heard thus far in this
ongoing discussion.
