# Individuals, decide for yourselves

The American Heritage Dictionary defines soci
ety as "the totality of human relationships." In
other words, it is a large group of individuals with
diverse and often conflicting practices and opinions
who interact with one another. Although this defi
nition seems self-evident, 1 am surprised how so
many of us tend to lose sight of it. We have a ten
dency to use "society" as if it were some nebulous,
homogeneous mass.
For example, two weeks ago The Daily printed a
letter in rebuttal to Bill Evers' column, "In defense
of drinkers' rights." The letter states, "it
should be obvious that society must at times be
protected from the ignorance of some of its mem
bers to protect the society as a whole. ... It would
be wonderful if society could always trust all its
members to use sound judgment, making such
legislation unnecessary, but the unfortunate truth is
it cannot. As people such as Evers constantly dem
onstrate, we are surrounded by unthinking, ir
responsible beings whose activities must sometimes
be legally restrained for the good of society.' I ''
Despite its good intentions, this letter assumes
that there is such a thing as a correct opinion
among "the totality of human relationships." It
supposes that people who disagree with main
stream opinion (and consequently their laws) are
automatically "irresponsible" deviants who must
be controlled in order to protect "society." It for
gets that we are living in the United States, where
opinions that conflict with the majority are
(ideally) protected by the Bill of Rights precisely so
that the majority cannot force others into conform
ity. It furthermore perpetrates the fallacy that a
collective "societal" opinion exists, as if the
majority of members of our society are like
programmed automatons.
Unfortunately, because so many of us accept this
fallacy without question, we often tend to separate
our personal convictions from the non-existent
"societal" judgment. Consequently, we downgrade
these opinions as if they were a superfluous aberra
tion of the mainstream. An example of this action
happened at about the same time I read the Evers

rebuttal letter. I saw Grace Paley speak in Robin
son Lounge, and she asked the students about their
views concerning U.S. intervention in Central
America. Two male students each responded,
"Well, personally I'm against American interven
tion, but if the United States does get involved,
they should go in all the way." Paley reacted by
saying, "How do you differentiate yourself from
the rest of society? How can you differentiate your
opinion from the rest of the society that you live in?
Society is people."

The importance of Paley's point cannot be over
estimated. Because we are inseparable from the so
ciety we create, our diyerging opinions are also
inseparable. In the United States, where basic
protections of individual liberty are stated in the
Bill of Rights, the expression of personal beliefs is
necessary precisely to ensure these basic freedoms.
For example, according to a noted draft resister,
Paul Jacob, the major reason that the United States
government has not reinstituted the draft for the
purpose of intervening in Nicaragua and other
"American interests" is that American men like
himself have refused to sign their lives away for
something they don't believe in. In spite of the
claims that fighting in certain wars would be
"good" for American democracy, the fact that
these people express their disapproval toward
legalized slavery shows their understanding that in
dividuals like themselves are what can make Amer
ican democracy ultimately successful.

However, many people in this country insist that
they know what is "best" for people in our society;
therefore, they enact (or try to enact) certain laws
that coerce people into doing what is best rather
than allowing each individual to voluntarily agree
or disagree with their views.
Yesterday, I read an article about why the in
stituting of the Social Security Act was "good and
necessary" for the United States, despite the fact
that it forces nearly every working American to
participate in the program. The day before I read
an article that argued that Congress should pass a
law forbidding children under 17 from attending
rock concerts because it is bad for young people to
be submitted to the explicit lyrics of Prince's
"Darling Nikki."
Last year, 1 learned that in California it is against
the law to sleep in your kitchen at night in order to
protect you from the perils of your gas range and
falling plates. Also, in Nebraska it is against the law
for women to dress in front of a picture of a man in
order to protect them from getting lustful ideas.
With some of these laws you may personally
agree, and others you might find laughable.
However, none of these American laws allow the
individual to determine what he or she believes is
right for himself or herself. Parents who don't want
their chttdren to go to Prince concerts generally
have the means to prevent them from going with
out a law forcing others to comply. People who
want to plan for their retirement do not need a gov
ernment to remove money from their paycheck for
them, no matter how "good" it appears superfi
cially. Once we Americans realize that each of us
is integral to the society we live in, we can begin
to individually determine what is best, good, bad or
wrong for ourselves. And once we are no longer
shackled by the legislation of other people's
seemingly altruistic consciences, we will finally
responsibly act on our own consciences whether
that means sleeping in the kitchen or not.

The American Heritage Dictionary defines soci
ety as "the totality of human relationships." In
other words, it is a large group of individuals with
diverse and often conflicting practices and opinions
who interact with one another. Although this defi
nition seems self-evident, 1 am surprised how so
many of us tend to lose sight of it. We have a ten
dency to use "society" as if it were some nebulous,
homogeneous mass.
For example, two weeks ago The Daily printed a
letter in rebuttal to Bill Evers' column, "In defense
of drinkers' rights." The letter states, "it
should be obvious that society must at times be
protected from the ignorance of some of its mem
bers to protect the society as a whole. ... It would
be wonderful if society could always trust all its
members to use sound judgment, making such
legislation unnecessary, but the unfortunate truth is
it cannot. As people such as Evers constantly dem
onstrate, we are surrounded by unthinking, ir
responsible beings whose activities must sometimes
be legally restrained for the good of society.' I ''
Despite its good intentions, this letter assumes
that there is such a thing as a correct opinion
among "the totality of human relationships." It
supposes that people who disagree with main
stream opinion (and consequently their laws) are
automatically "irresponsible" deviants who must
be controlled in order to protect "society." It for
gets that we are living in the United States, where
opinions that conflict with the majority are
(ideally) protected by the Bill of Rights precisely so
that the majority cannot force others into conform
ity. It furthermore perpetrates the fallacy that a
collective "societal" opinion exists, as if the
majority of members of our society are like
programmed automatons.
Unfortunately, because so many of us accept this
fallacy without question, we often tend to separate
our personal convictions from the non-existent
"societal" judgment. Consequently, we downgrade
these opinions as if they were a superfluous aberra
tion of the mainstream. An example of this action
happened at about the same time I read the Evers

rebuttal letter. I saw Grace Paley speak in Robin
son Lounge, and she asked the students about their
views concerning U.S. intervention in Central
America. Two male students each responded,
"Well, personally I'm against American interven
tion, but if the United States does get involved,
they should go in all the way." Paley reacted by
saying, "How do you differentiate yourself from
the rest of society? How can you differentiate your
opinion from the rest of the society that you live in?
Society is people."

The importance of Paley's point cannot be over
estimated. Because we are inseparable from the so
ciety we create, our diyerging opinions are also
inseparable. In the United States, where basic
protections of individual liberty are stated in the
Bill of Rights, the expression of personal beliefs is
necessary precisely to ensure these basic freedoms.
For example, according to a noted draft resister,
Paul Jacob, the major reason that the United States
government has not reinstituted the draft for the
purpose of intervening in Nicaragua and other
"American interests" is that American men like
himself have refused to sign their lives away for
something they don't believe in. In spite of the
claims that fighting in certain wars would be
"good" for American democracy, the fact that
these people express their disapproval toward
legalized slavery shows their understanding that in
dividuals like themselves are what can make Amer
ican democracy ultimately successful.

However, many people in this country insist that
they know what is "best" for people in our society;
therefore, they enact (or try to enact) certain laws
that coerce people into doing what is best rather
than allowing each individual to voluntarily agree
or disagree with their views.
Yesterday, I read an article about why the in
stituting of the Social Security Act was "good and
necessary" for the United States, despite the fact
that it forces nearly every working American to
participate in the program. The day before I read
an article that argued that Congress should pass a
law forbidding children under 17 from attending
rock concerts because it is bad for young people to
be submitted to the explicit lyrics of Prince's
"Darling Nikki."
Last year, 1 learned that in California it is against
the law to sleep in your kitchen at night in order to
protect you from the perils of your gas range and
falling plates. Also, in Nebraska it is against the law
for women to dress in front of a picture of a man in
order to protect them from getting lustful ideas.
With some of these laws you may personally
agree, and others you might find laughable.
However, none of these American laws allow the
individual to determine what he or she believes is
right for himself or herself. Parents who don't want
their chttdren to go to Prince concerts generally
have the means to prevent them from going with
out a law forcing others to comply. People who
want to plan for their retirement do not need a gov
ernment to remove money from their paycheck for
them, no matter how "good" it appears superfi
cially. Once we Americans realize that each of us
is integral to the society we live in, we can begin
to individually determine what is best, good, bad or
wrong for ourselves. And once we are no longer
shackled by the legislation of other people's
seemingly altruistic consciences, we will finally
responsibly act on our own consciences whether
that means sleeping in the kitchen or not.
