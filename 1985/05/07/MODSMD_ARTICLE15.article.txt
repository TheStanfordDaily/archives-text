Racist Reagan
I would like to formally applaud
Darieck Scott for so eloquently
expressing his views (and mine) on
President Reagan's repeated insults
to the minorities in this country in
his recent column (The Daily, May
2). Clearly, Reagan's visit to the
Nazi graves at Bitburg is his attempt
to put American Jews "in their
place" as he has done repeatedly to
American Hispanics, particularly
Mexican-Americans. While Reagan
was the governor of California, he
tried to limit the number of
Hispanics permitted to matriculate at
the University of California. As
president, he has proposed abolish
ing the Bilingual Education Program,
has denied fair housing policies for
Chicanos, has supported the most
extreme version of the Simpson-
Mazzoli bill which all major Latino
leaders view as discriminatory, and
has opposed every major civil rights
law. a fact which earned him the
endorsement of the Ku Klux Klan.
Now. by lay ing a wreath on the
graves of men who committed the
most heinous crimes in history.
Reagan has convinced me that he is
a card-carrying racist. The president
claims he is there to consolidate our
post-war friendship with West Ger
many. It is only too obvious that in
doing so. he will symbolically slap
every .lew in the face while he has
the chance. Reagan may find it easy
to forget the Holocaust, but I don't
believe such an appalling denigration
of human life should ever be forgot
ten or forgiven.
Behind the mass of wrinkled skin,
cold eyes and heavily dyed hair lie
dark ulterior motives. Every action
our president takes has negative,
bigoted overtones: We should not
overlook the fact that the president
has chosen to patronize the racist
white regime in South Africa. Let's
face it. It's more than coincidence.
Does Reagan have to promote
genocide before the American public
takes notice?
I :>ni not the first person to call

Reagan a racist, nor will I be the last.
I am only ashamed that more mem
bers of the American public have not
realized that Reagan is an enemy of
racial equality all over the world.

Legislative change
Stanford President Donald Ken
nedy was reported on CBS news on
April 26 as telling 1,000 students at
a rally that "legislative reform," not
demands for divestment, is the best
way to end apartheid in South
Africa.
Kennedy's approach, sounding
remarkably similar to President
Reagan's, is not unexpected from a
university president at this time, nor
from a corporation manager in
today's world. However, there is a
bit of irony deriving from Kennedy's
hypocrisy. If recollection serves me
correctly, Kennedy resigned from the
position of head of the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) amid
continuing political pressures against
maintenance of the integrity and
high standards of public protection
that Kennedy advocated.
I do not think that, as an advocate
of the public health and welfare, nor
as a scientist. Kennedy found the
U.S. government terribly responsive.
The irony is that Kennedy left that
fight in the political arena for a most
comfortable position as the
manager for the Stanford trustees,
whose view of South Africa and
divestment he now comes to reflect.
I find it unlikely that Kennedy would
argue against divestment in private
to his wife, children or former as
sociates in the Biology Department.
Of course. Kennedy did not leave
the government under protest or
with any shame, so he is free to
challenge the veracity of what I have
written about his experience with
government, but those who study the
period in the press files will get the
picture. And if I am not mistaken.
Stanford students are surely as intel
ligent as those at UC-Berkelev.

Columbia. Colorado, Florida, etc.
and will see through the charade.

Poverty of ideas
It must he confessed that the num
ber of subjects upon which Newman
had no ideas was extremely large,
and it must be added that as regards
those subjects upon which he was
without ideas he was also perfectly
without words.
Jason Matherly, like Newman in
Henry James' "The American." is
afflicted with a poverty of ideas;
unfortunately, Matherly is not per
fectly without words. What substance
there was in his column (The Daily,
May 1) deserves refutation.
Divestment is not. as Matherly
maintains, an interventionist tactic.
American corporations that do busi
ness in South Africa are already
intervening in support of that gov
ernment by paying taxes and provid
ing material resources for the
maintenance of the apartheid system.
Divestment signals our commitment
to the end of that intervention.
Matherly also bids supporters of
divestment to "be realistic for a
moment." This realism consists of
recognizing that if we don't do busi
ness in South Africa, someone else
will. The immorality of this
"realism" was unmasked by Bishop
Desmond Tutu: "It's like saying.
'Hey, your wife is going to get raped,
and if I don't, someone else is
waiting.' " Further, if we are to be
truly realistic about the situation in
South Africa, we should heed the
words of Winnie Mandela: "When
we have won. we will remember
those who have supported us. and we
have a very long memory." When
South Africa has attained black
majority rule, whose side do we want
to be on? To blithely overrule the
African National Congress, Bishop
lutu, Winnie Mandela and others in
South Africa engaged in the struggle
against apartheid is to in some fun
damental way deny Black South
Africans their riiiht to self-

determination. Further, if divest
ment, as Matherly so patiently
explains, is not an effective anti
apartheid strategy, we challenge him
to explain why advocating divest
ment is a crime in South Africa.
Matherly uses his thesaurus and
name-calling to divide the world into
"us" and "them." "They" are:
"haughty dunderheads," "self
proclaimed pundits and moralizers"
and "patriotic chameleons," and
they occupy "a shoddily self
constructed moral high ground." The
numbers aren't in yet, hut if 2,500
signatures on a petition for total
divestment and an 80 percent stu
dent vote to divest from Motorola
Corp. are taken as indicators, Math
erly should think twice about calling
his "they" a "vociferous minority."
It seems to us that Matherly's "us"
comprises those who, like President
Reagan, believe that Marxism is a
greater crime than genocide, as
Reagan's Nicaraguan embargo and
visit to Bitburg suggest.
Like University President Donald
Kennedy, Matherly grants us the
nobility of our cause. Apartheid, as
Vice President of Business and
Finance William Massy also pointed
out, is abhorrent to all right-thinking
people. We have been hearing these
confirmations of principles and
human rights at Mandela Free Uni
versity for days now. But Matherly.
like Kennedy and Massy before him,
has nothing new to offer. If he has a
plan to end apartheid, to end U.S.
and Stanford participation in South
Africa's genocide, we challenge him
to present it at Mandela Free Uni
versity. If not, we invite him to come
and participate in the teaching and
learning there, so that this disagree
ment about means becomes some
thing more substantive than an
attack for the sake of attack.
(Besides. Jason, you might even
discover that not all — or even most
— of us at Mandela Free U. arc
"fellows.')
