## Tanner lectures are for specialists only 
### 
When I began attending the annual
Tanner Lectures in Human Values
three years ago, I supposed they were
meant for the general educated
public. After all, the subject "human
values" is broad, and the lectures are
advertised on posters throughout the
campus, and in good-sized notices in
The Daily. It appears, however, that

VIEWPOINT

the lectures are intended for
specialists in the speakers' fields of
research.
The first Tanner Lecture I heard
was given by David Gauthier of the
University of Pittsburgh in 1983, and
was called "The Incompleat Egoist:
From Rational Choice to Moral The
ory." Before the lecture, we were
handed Xeroxed sheets defining
"strategy" and "Nash-equiJibrium
set" and explaining that a "principle
for choice" is "a function taking sets
of alternative actions into subsets of
themselves." We were assumed to be
conversant with game theory and
with the writings of G.E. Moore and
John Rawls. And we were expected
to follow Gauthier's complex
demonstrations of two- and three
person games of strategies and
payoffs, and therefore to see the
validity of his conclusion that
"egoistic maximizers" are in the grip
of "self-defeating strategies."
In 1984. the Tanner Lecture
looked more promising. Leonard
Meyer, professor of music and
humanities at the University of Penn
sylvania, was to speak on "Ideology
and Music in 19th-century Roman
ticism." He had written a book with
the wonderfully broad title "Music,
the Arts, and Ideas." As it was, the
introduction to the lecture was filled
with such words as "synchronic" and
"constructs." Then came the state
ment of the main subject, "composers
and their strategies of composition."
Quotations of arresting beauty and
power from Schopenhauer, Wagner
and Schumann were followed by
Meyer's commentaries, littered with
such phrases as "norms of behavior,"
"is correlative to" and "consciously

conceptualizing." Sometimes, as in
the discussion of axial melodies versus
changing-note melodies, the technical
language was necessary, but often it
wasn't. And we were assumed to have
detailed prior knowledge of music
theory, and to be able to follow with
expertise. considerations of
"secondary parameters" and
"statistical climaxes."
I he title of this year's Tanner
Lecture, "Moderation, Rationality
and Virtue" (April 17 and 22),
reminded me of the subject of Gau
thier's lecture. And when Michael
Slote of the University of Maryland
began to speak, 1 was dismayed by
the similarity of his language to Gau
thier's. The "egoistic maximizer" of
Gauthier had become, with Slote, the
"egoistic optimizer" whose strategies
of maximization were also self
defeating. Instead of maximisation,
Slote recommended the more practi
cal and rational strategy of an entity
called the "moderate satisficer" (he
who is satisified with the sufficient).
Those who showed genuine interest
in this subject during the question
and-answer period were obviously
familiar with Slote's highly technical
books and methods. Some of the uni
nitiated mainly got the impression
that if you subtracted from the lecture
the word "strategy" and words
spelled with "-ize," there would have
been silence. What was there tor the
larger educated public, for a doctor, a
banker or a lawyer, who goes to a
public university lecture on reason
and virtue for enlightenment about
the world he's immersed in?
I propose that the Tanner Lectures
take on the breadth and graceful style
of the Mellon Art Lectures in Wash
ington, D.C., or Ortega y Gasset's
lectures on metaphysics, or Kant's on
ethics. If the Tanner Committee
means to keep its series specialized,
then Stanford might consider devising
an annual lecture for those of the
general public who look to the Uni
versity for the intellectual culture that
can't be found anywhere else.
