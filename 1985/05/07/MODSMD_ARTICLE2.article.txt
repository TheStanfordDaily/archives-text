## 
### SCOTT PARKER 
I.aurie Ann Landis. a former Psy
chology Department secretary,
pleaded not guilty yesterday to
charges that she embezzled almost
$6,000 from the University.
At yesterday's pre-trial hearing,
held in Santa Clara County's North
County Courthouse, Judge Edward
Scoven reduced Landis' bail from
$50,000 to $10,000.
The judge and lawyers from both
sides will meet next Wednesday for a
preliminary setting. At the setting,
according to Lorraine O'Keefe, su
pervising deputy district attorney, a
preliminary examination date will be
set. the case will be postponed, or
I .andis will plead guilty.
Public Defender Bill Cottrell,
Landis' attorney, argued against the
bail amount. "She should have been
released on her own recognizance.
She was in a (drug) treatment pro
gram," he said after the hearing.
"Now she's in jail. All they get there
are three meals a day, and sometimes
not even that."
Landis was arrested last Tuesday at
St. Cat heft ri .rs'lTosp ita P in" HaTf
Moon Bay. where she had voluntarily
entered a drug rehabilitation pro
gram.
Scoyen followed Pre-trial Specialist
Amos (irogan's bail report, which
recommended that Landis not be
released on her own recognizance.
Cirogan said that his pre-trial reports
take a number of factors into account
in making bail recommendations,
such as |iast criminal record, ties to
the community, emotional stability
and the opinions of the arresting offi
cers.
Landis has a police record, but she
told the judge that she had "nothing"
on her record since May 19N0.
Cottrell could not say whether
Landis would be able to make bail.
Landis was arrested after an inter
nal audit ol the Psychology Depart
ment revealed irregularities totaling
nearly $6,000 in petty cash transac
tions over the past year, according to
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer.
The audit began after Landis al
legedly intercepted a royalty check
intended for Prof. Richard
Thompson, forged his signature and
cashed it. Landis was Thompson's
secretary.
