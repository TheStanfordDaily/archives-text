# Amigos help provide aid in Latin America
## Features 
### NICOLE MICHAELS 
The scene seems somewhat
paradoxical. In the midst of a wealthy
Palo Alto home, a crowd of people
eat a potluck dinner and talk
animatedly about summer plans to
live and work in Latin America.
But from this paradox will come
another summer of aid to im
poverished Central and South Ameri
can nations from Amigos de las
Americas.
Amigos is a private, non-profit or
ganization that trains people 16 to 24
years old from 30 chapters in the
United States to provide aid in Latin
American nations where Amigos is
both needed and invited.
"We (Amigos) won't go where we
aren't asked," says Sue Beekley,
recruiting chairperson for the Penin
sula chapter of Amigos.
A needy nation's request for aid is
an important part of the Amigos pro
gram. A nation's ministry of health or
comparable organization determines
the type of aid needed and the area to
be covered, then contacts Amigos
through its international office.
Amigos in turn sends a route-leader
to the country to plan the program. In
this way. both Amigos and the nation
involved are assured of attending to
the nation's most urgent needs.
However, Amigos will not venture
into nations with dangerous political
instability. Nicaragua, Guatemala,
Honduras and Chile have all been
refused Amigos' aid, although they
have requested it each year.
Amigos provides a variety of health
and hygiene services. The most
popular and successful programs have
been instruction in dental hygiene,
community sanitation (latrine proj

ects), prescription and distrbution of
eyeglasses, human immunization
and rabies vaccinations for dogs and
cats.
Each new Amigo is trained over
the school year, beginning in Novem
ber, receiving more than 125 hours of
instruction in first aid, medical, dental
and veterinary techniques, commu
nity health, Latin culture and
Spanish.
This year's cost for each Amigo is
$2,200. Each Amigo is expected to
contribute $550 and to procure the
remainder through fund-raising activ
ities.
Since its founding in 1965, more
than 97,000 Amigos volunteers have
rendered more than 10 million indi
vidual health services.
This year, 25 chapters are sending
out approximately 500 Amigos to
Costa Rica, Dominican Republic,
Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay,
Venezuela and Panama. Among this
year's volunteers are five Stanford
students: Karol Aure, Marie Beaver,
Julia Bower, Mark Henderson and
Gabrielle Westergren.
Westergren, a junior majoring in
history and linguistics, joined
Amigos "to get experience at the
grassroots level." She is considering a
career working in the Third World.
Having grown up in England and
France, Westergren is not unaccus
tomed to life in foreign countries. She
has also traveled to Africa. Con
fronting poverty is not foreign to her.
"I've seen a lot of poverty," she says.
Westergren is a volunteer for
Friends for Youth, an organization
that pairs volunteers with under
privileged children. She is currently
working with a 12-year-old Mexican

girl who recently arrived in the
United States. "I'm helping her deal
with adjusting to American culture,"
says Westergren in a reversal of her
future role as an Amigo in Ecuador,
where she, herself, will need to adjust
to a different culture.
Westergren's volunteer work is
preparatory for her summer's work
both in its practical experience and its
fund-raising role: Amigos sponsors
have set up a fund for Amigos where
they are paid $10 an hour for a mini
mum of 20 hours of volunteer work.
The Amigos organization helps stu
dents raise funds for their trips in

other ways. Students are given exam
ples of how to write effective letters
soliciting funds and a list of groups
that have donated in the past. This
year some Stanford Amigos sold
grapefruit and wine — donated by
sponsors — to raise money.
Freshman Marie Beaver says that
the most substantial time commit
ment of the Amigos program during
the school year has been fundraising.
While it takes time and ingenuity,
"Amigos does help you out a lot,"
she added.
Beaver had been considering the
Peace Corps and a program that
sends students on archaeological digs

in Africa when she discovered
Amigos. She says she learned that
"you really need a bachelor's
(degree)" to join the Peace Corps
and decided that the archaeological
program "sounded interesting, but it
didn't seem right to be digging up
things when there arc people starving
nearby."
When asked to comment on the
relatively meager media coverage of
starvation in Latin America, in com
parison to the wide coverage of
starvation in Africa, Beaver replied,
"The situation in Africa is more dra
matic, but infantile death from diar
rhea is a serious problem in Latin

America." Such deaths are attributed
to poor nutrition and poor hygiene,
reflecting inadequate food resources
and hygiene education for Latin
American mothers, she said.
Beaver says that although "Amigos
focuses on disease and children," the
experience itself is "like peer coun
seling."
The peer counseling role of
Amigos volunteers is part of pro
grams like the dental hygiene and
community sanitation prjects. These
projects seek to teach people health
skills by eliciting their participation
