## Six-Pac champs face Gaels 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
After his team wrapped up its
second Pacific 10 Southern Division
title in the last three years Sunday,
Stanford Baseball Coach Mark
Marquess said, "Now we get to relax
a little bit."
In this case, relaxation is four
games in the next four days. Today,
the Cardinal plays its first game as the
1985 Six-Pac champion when it
travels to Moraga to take on St.
Mary's in a 2:30 p.m. contest.
Stanford clinched the pennant Sun
day, winning two out of three slug
fests with Arizona State over the
weekend. In Sunday's 15-10 victory,
the Cardinal had to withstand five
Sun Devil homers, including four in
one inning.
The two wins upped Stanford's Six-
Pac record to 21-6, five games ahead
of both Arizona and California with
only three to play. Because the Card
inal dominated the league so
thoroughly, the victory celebration
was subdued. There was no World
Series-like pileup on the pitcher's
mound after the final out was re
corded.
With its big lead in the standings,
this team expected to win, and it did.
"I'm excited, but not overwhelmed,"
catcher John Ramos said. "We knew
we had it — it was just a matter of
time." Ramos led Stanford with

seven RBls over the weekend.
Mark Davis" two-run homer in the
first on Sunday gave the Cardinal a
lead it never relinquished. "It was in
evitable," Davis said, explaining the
team's low-key attitude. "It wasn't
like the last game and we had to win
it."
Toi Cook, who had three hits in
Sunday's pennant-clincher, wasn't
jumping up and down either. "We
were expected to win. It was just an
other day at the ballpark," he said,
adding, "If we make the College
World Series and win it, then I'll get
excited."
A couple of Cardinal veterans
compared this title favorably to the
1983 crown. "It's a great feeling,"
left fielder Walt Harris said. "This is a
hell of a lot better. I didn't play much
back then, so I feel more like a part of
the team."
"I think this team is better," Pete
Stanicek said. Stanicek was also the
starting second baseman on the 1983
team. "Two years ago, a few big guys
carried the team. Now, everyone con
tributes. Plus, it being my senior year
makes it better."
St. Mary's brings a 30-22 mark into
today's game. The Gaels are cur
rently tied for second in the West
Coast Athletic Conference with a 12-
9 record. In January, Stanford beat

St. Mary's 5-1 in the season opener
for both teams.
The Gaels' offense is led by catcher
Chris Gaeckle. Gaeckle is hitting
.343 with seven homers. His 55 RBIs
are a school record, breaking the old
mark held by Philadelphia Phillies
outfielder Von Hayes.
St. Mary's plans to use six pitchers
against Stanford today. The last of
the six will probably be relief ace Ken
Reinsche, who is 6-1 with 2.96 ERA
and 14 saves. Ugo Colella will get the
starting call for the Cardinal.
After nine consecutive road games,
Stanford will return to Sunken Dia
mond for games with Cal Poly-San
l.uis Obispo tomorrow and San Fran
cisco State on Thursday. Both start at
2:30 p.m.
The Cardinal will finish the week
Friday with a 3 p.m contest at Santa
Clara.
Kevin Kunkel would undoubtedly
have figured in Stanford's pitching
plans for the week, but he flew back
home to Leonardo, N.J. over the
weekend after his father — former
American League umpire Bill Kunkel
— died. Because the funeral is sched
uled for tomorrow, Kevin is not ex
pected to return this week.
