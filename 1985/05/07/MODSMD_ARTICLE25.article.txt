I he Sixth Annual Cardinal Club
Celebrity/Amateur Golf Tournament at the Stan
ford Golf Course — a fund-raiser for the Stanford
womens' athletic program — exceeded the
predicted intake of $40,000 yesterday, netting ap
proximately $45,000, the equivalent of three fully
funded athletic scholarships, according to Stanford
Women's Golf Coach Tim Baldwin.
The event included an 18-hole tournament, a
dinner hosted by Los Angeles Raiders quarterback
Jim Plunkett, football announcer John Madden and
Stanford radio broadcaster Bob Murphy, and an
auction and raffle following the dinner.
"Good . . . terrific," was how Baldwin described
the outcome of the day's events. "This is a happen
ing, this isn't a golf tournament."
Though the golf may not have been the most im
portant aspect of the agenda, it was difficult to tell
by watching the reactions of the various groups as

they reported their scores at the end of the round.
Looks of disgust filled the face of several golfers as
they spoke to others about the easy putts which
they missed throughout the round.
The golfers were organized in groups of six, with
one celebrity or Cardinal woman in each group.
After every shot, the players were allowed to move
their balls up to the ball which was hit the closest to
the hole. This continued until one ball was finally
holed.
Charles Schulz — the world-renowned author of
the Peanuts comic strip — and his group captured
first place with a 15-under-par 57. The groups of
Mark Soltau, Chuck Evans, Jack Christiansen and
Randy Cross, the bulky All-Pro guard for the San
Francisco 49ers, tied for second at 59.
The leading finisher among the Cardinal women
was Kay Cornelius and her group at 60. The groups
of Adrienne Gilmartin, Stephanie Kondik, Kathy
Kostas and Christy Overgard all finished at 61.
Following the tournament, most of the partici

pants went inside the clubhouse to enjoy dinner
and the comedy of Madden and Murphy, who
shared the role of master of ceremonies.
When Madden received the microphone from
Murphy, he was warmly greeted by the audience,
which chanted in unison, "Less filling, tastes
great," in reference to the Lite Beer commercials
which have immortalized him in the minds of sports
enthusiasts.
Then Madden was not-so-warmly greeted by a
Murphy joke, which poked fun at the former
coach's excessive girth. "You can tell this man
really believed in physical fitness (when he was
coaching)," Murphy said. "Just take one look at
him."
Madden, with his enthusiastic brand of humor,
delighted the audience before Plunkett took the
stand to raffle off prizes which included weekend
trips to Palm Springs, Lake Tahoe and Monterey
and a 1985 Super Bowl football autographed by
the NFL champion 49ers.
