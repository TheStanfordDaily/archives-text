# Buckeye coach to take job here
## 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
Athletic Director Andy Geiger
will announce today that Tara Van
Derveer, the women's basketball
coach at Ohio State, will be named
to the same position at Stanford.
Van Derveer will replace Dotty
McCrea, who was forced to resign
in March after nine years as the
Cardinal coach.
This year, Van Derveer took
Ohio State to the NCAA East
Regional final, where the
Buckeyes were ousted by eventual
national champion. Old
Dominion. The Buckeyes finished
the season at 28-3 and won their

New women's hoop couch
fourth straight Big Ten title in the
five years Van Derveer has
coached there.
"I'm excited about it," Van
Derveer said last night from Co
lumbus. "I wouldn't be leaving
Ohio State if it weren't exciting."
"She's terrific," Geiger said.
"She's extra bright and an able
coach. She was highly recom
mended by everyone 1 talked to."
At Ohio State from 1980
through this year, Van Derveer
had a 110-37 record in five
seasons, and her teams posted four
consecutive 20-win seasons to go
with their conference champion
ships.
Prior to assuming the job in Co
lumbus, Van Derveer went 42-14
in two seasons at Idaho. She has
won almost 75 percent of her

games as a head coach, with a
career record of 152-51.
"I think there were probably
different reasons." Van Derveer
said on why she left a top-10 pro
gram at Ohio State for a Stanford
team that finished 9-19.
"I used to live in Idaho, so I'm
attracted to the geography in the
West. Second, I really think it's a
great educational institution — if I
were still in school, it's where I'd
want to go. And I was impressed
with the people out there, both in
the department and on the team."
Van Derveer said the Bay Area
offers more personal opportunities
than Columbus.
"Here it seems like you eat,
drink, sleep and breathe Buckeye
basketball. 1 think Stanford is a
little more balanced. It's great
here, but you start to think,' Is that
all there is?" "
Reaction from the players was
consistantly summed up in one ad
jective: "Excited."
Junior center Sarah Evans, who,
before deciding to attend Stan
ford, was recruited by Van Der
veer out of high school in Rio
Grande, Ohio, said, "She's a very
big name in the business, and she
knows what she's doing. I know
things are going to be changing a
lot here — the program's going to
be getting a lot more attention."
Sophomore guard Erica Mueser
said, "It's so much different from
last year. I just wanted to get away
from it then. Now, we've been
playing ever since we got back
from break, everyone's working
out, and everyone's planning to
stay out here this summer to play
and work out. We're really
psyched to play."
Sophomore forward Karen
Goedewaagen said, "She's going
to be, from what I can tell, more
quiet in what she says, a more
business-like person, more in con
trol."
"She's well-known and well
liked all over the country," fresh
man guard Charli Turner said. "I
think that's what we need. I think
she's really going to be tough and
work us real hard."

John Ramos had seven RBIs over the weekend to help Stanford clinch a
Six-Pac pennant that he said "was only a matter of time."
