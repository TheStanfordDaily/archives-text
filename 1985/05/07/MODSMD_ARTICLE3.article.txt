# Kennedy wary of H & C Slate
## Discusses aid, apartheid on KZSU 
### DAVID EMERSON 
University President Donald Ken
nedy said yesterday "a sense of re
sponsibility is likely to dawn" on the
newly elected Hammer and Coffin
Council of Presidents.
Kennedy spoke on the COP elec
tions, as well as a number of other
topics, yesterday on "Campus Confer
ence," K/.SU's weekly radio pro
gram.
The H & C Slate — which soundly
defeated its rivals by running on an
anti-ASSU.platform in last month's
election —- "may end up to be the vic
tim instead of the perpetrator" of its
"amusing if occasionally profane"
campaign, Kennedy said.
"Student government does some
very important things," he said. "No
one is going to make a joke out of it
for very long."

The election of the H & C, accord
ing to Kennedy, reflected students'
impatience with the old senate and
"some good old fashioned Stanford
whimsy." At the same time, however,
he called The Daily's editorial en
dorsement of the slate
"irresponsible."
"They didn't make a very good
case for it editorially," he said.
Turning to student aid, Kennedy
reiterated his pledge "to meet the full
demonstrated need of every student,"
regardless of federal budget cuts.
Kennedy labeled the current proposal
for an $8,000 cap on total institu
tional expenses, which the govern
ment will cover per family, as "a ter
rible idea." He said the effect of the
proposal would be to force students

to transfer from private, high-tuition
schools into public institutions.
Kennedy stated that he is lobbying
hard for Sen. Robert Stafford's (R-
Vt.) compromise amendment that
would restore many of the cuts that
have already been made. The amend
ment has a reasonable chance for suc
cess, he said, but right now the whole
budget process is "up for grabs."
Kennedy, when questioned con
cerning his stand on divestment,
restated his support for the Univer
sity's selective policy which, he said,
uses divestment only as "a last
resort." He said that Stanford's policy
of taking part in shareholder actions
and holding private dialogues with
management has been "construc
tive." Nevertheless, he said that "in
the case of the South Africa, the sit
uation does not show any signs of
having been positively influenced."
Asked why Stanford has never in
itiated a stockholder action, Kennedy
replied that "you don't have to in
itiate them in order to participate in
them."
"You have leverage when you own
stock," he stated. "You lose that
when you sell."
Kennedy also said divestment

would hurt the University financially.
If the University engaged in total
divestment, it would have to sell a
"very significant percentage" of its
investments, he said. This action, he
added, would result in a substantially
"weaker" portfolio, causing the Uni
versity to "suffer some losses."
In a related issue, Kennedy denied
having said, "Give them two weeks
and they'll calm down," in regard to
the anti-apartheid protesters. He
called the quotation, which is attrib
uted to him in a poster hanging in the
Inner Quad, "absolutely false."
Kennedy also discussed the case of
Steven Mosher, the Stanford anthro
pology student who was expelled
from the University after allegedly
using "improper research methods"
while working on his doctoral thesis
in China. Kennedy said he has
reached a "tentative recommenda
tion" on Mosher's final appeal to
re-enroll at Stanford, and
will announce his decision after
meeting with Mosher and his lawyer
near the end of this month.
On the two Grateful Dead concerts
held at Frost Amphitheatre last month,
Kennedy said his general impression
was that "they seemed to go well."
Before any more concerts can occur,
however, he said that "a careful ac
counting will have to be held" con
cerning the number of arrests, institu
tional costs and financial factors.
