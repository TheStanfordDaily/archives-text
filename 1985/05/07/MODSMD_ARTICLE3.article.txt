# Kennedy wary of H & C Slate
## Discusses aid, apartheid on KZSU 
### DAVID EMERSON 
University President Donald Ken
nedy said yesterday "a sense of re
sponsibility is likely to dawn" on the
newly elected Hammer and Coffin
Council of Presidents.
Kennedy spoke on the COP elec
tions, as well as a number of other
topics, yesterday on "Campus Confer
ence," K/.SU's weekly radio pro
gram.
The H & C Slate — which soundly
defeated its rivals by running on an
anti-ASSU.platform in last month's
election —- "may end up to be the vic
tim instead of the perpetrator" of its
"amusing if occasionally profane"
campaign, Kennedy said.
"Student government does some
very important things," he said. "No
one is going to make a joke out of it
for very long."

The election of the H & C, accord
ing to Kennedy, reflected students'
impatience with the old senate and
"some good old fashioned Stanford
whimsy." At the same time, however,
he called The Daily's editorial en
dorsement of the slate
"irresponsible."
"They didn't make a very good
case for it editorially," he said.
Turning to student aid, Kennedy
reiterated his pledge "to meet the full
demonstrated need of every student,"
regardless of federal budget cuts.
Kennedy labeled the current proposal
for an $8,000 cap on total institu
tional expenses, which the govern
ment will cover per family, as "a ter
rible idea." He said the effect of the
proposal would be to force students
