## 'S' provoking, but awkward drama 
### GREGORY WEINGARTEN Editorial staff 
As an indictment of the racist
regime in South Africa,
"S'kotiphola" is savage, gripping and
powerful; as a theatrical work,
though, "S'kotiphola" is somewhat
forced, heavy-handed and didactic.
The play has all the makings of a
quality production, hut somehow it
never quite flows together in one
comprehensive piece. Nonetheless,
"S'kotiphola" presents a stirring and
upsetting look at South African life.
"S'kotiphola" is written and di
rected by exiled South African
playwright Selaelo Maredi, who also
created another play on life in South
Africa called "Homeland," that
was well received by critics. Maredi is
currently operating at the Julian
Theatre under a grant from the
Naitonal Endowment for the Arts. In
"S'kotiphola," the playwright
ventures beyond dialogue — the pro
diction is billed as "a new musical on
South African life."
The play opens at a graduation cer
emony at an all-black university. The
president of the class, Matsobane
Seyako (Wedrell James), delivers a
stirring speech to the graduating stu
dents. James, unfortunately, never is
.able to ease into the character of
Matsobane, one of the lead figures in
the play, and the resulting per
formance is awkward. After the
graduation, Matsobane meets with a
fellow student and fiancee, Mampedi
(Velina Brown). The couple is deeply
in love, and Matsobane decides to
take Mampedi home with him to
meet his mother, Mrs. Seyako. (Mr.
Seyako, we learn, was killed under
circumstances which are never really

made clear to the audience.) The rest
of the play is set at Matsobane's home
and those of his neighbors — all part
of a South African township in which
blacks are segregated from the
whites. Here, the educated Mampedi
(she is studying to be a doctor), who
apparently is a stranger to the poverty
and destitution of her lovers ghetto,
witnesses the struggle, oppression
and injustices inflicted on the blacks

by the apartheid system. (It is
never made clear where Mampedi is
from, although at one point in the
play, one of the ghetto's residents
tells her to go back to her
"bourgeosie life" and leave the
township.)
Mampedi, though, is able to get the
people of the township to realize they
are not powerless over their cruel
existence — through the principle of

unity, they are able to fight and
overcome the oppression which con
fronts their daily lives. Maredi, the
playwright, chooses to represent this
evil oppression through a two
dimensional character, a black police
officer who is referred to only as
"Sergeant." Sergeant is repugnant to
the town people because he is black
and still willfully collaborates with the
white South African government. He
evicts families from their homes and
arrests "trouble makers." Yet, it is
not until the end of the play that the
town people dare stand up to the
policeman's tyranny.
The set design by Allan Curreri is
mercifully simple and very effective.
The blacks live in ramshackle
structures that appear to us as out
houses, but represent to their in
habitants basic shelter and survival.
About three houses form the main
structures of the stage. The area in
between the houses is where most of
the dialogue and action takes place.
Unfortunately, the set design is the
only part of the production that
doesn't intrude overbearingly on the
audience. The dialogue of the play of
ten seems unnatural. This is due in
part to the cast members, who don't
seem at ease in their roles (this might
have been because I attended an
opening night performance), and the
script itself. At times, the script reads
like a political-historical
philosophical treatise rather than a
dialogue among friends, and the result
are lines that often seem stilted:
"This world is so full of hate and
we're right in the middle of it, swal
lowing blades that cut our throat."
"Hell is here. . .. Satan is a hateful
white man" — somehow, while these

phrases are provoking and disturbing,
they seem strangely out of place and
artificial when they are delivered b\
actors.
Many of the all-black cast, though,
emerge as extremely talented
performers. Velina Brown, who plays
Mampedi, has a striking presence on
stage that is boosted b\ her mag
nificent singing voice. I.L. Mack
McJunkins is very convincing as Tsat
sopa, a mean-spirited character
whom we are lead to believe is a
"killer." McJunkins is able to appear
truly frightening while retaining a
human element underneath his hard
ened exterior — a feat which is not

easy given the dearth of character de
velopment Maredi allows for in his
script. Perhaps the biggest surprise of
the evening was the young actress
Michelle Scoggins, who plays
Mokatse Zondo, the child daughter in
the family evicted by Sergeant. Scog
gins' singing number is one of the few
songs that works in the play. She sings
"I'm proud to be a black child" with
such inner-strength and heart-felt
emotion that the song attains a uni
versal quality that reaches out to all

people who have ever been oppressed
or felt short-changed by their own
identity.
On the whole, however. Maredi's
attempt to interject music into the
play so us to make it a musical is
problematic, and just as the dialogue
often seems unnatural, so too does the
spontaneous singing which interrupts
the dialogue at awkward spots, often
shortchanging the spoken content of
the play. There is a resulting schizo
phrenia between pla\ and musical,
neither of which ever fully develops.
The music in the play doesn't really
work in song form, but is just an ex
tension of the dialogue which perhaps
would have worked better if
delivered in spoken form. However,
the musical part of "S'kotiphola" is
saved by African ballads sung in their
native tongue, which form some of the
most effective and beautiful moments
in the production. The African songs
are powerful and captivating, and the
cast delivers them in a style that
transcends language barriers.
Despite the fact the "S'kotiphola"
is often forced in a fashion that is
quite unlike the subtle maneuvering
that one looks for when examining a
play, the piece is still thought provok
ing. In exposing the injustices of
South African life, one gets the
feeling that Maredi places dramatic
technique and the play itself as sec
ondary to revealing political and so
cial issues that plague the South
African population. Maredi's ideas
are what carried "S'kotiphola"
through some of its awkward mo
ments. One leaves the theater moved,
feeling both the suffering and sorrow
but also the hope and spirit of the
South African black.


Wendrell James and Velina Brown star in 'S'kotiphola,' a drama about
life in South Africa. The play runs through June 2 at the Julian Theatre
in San Francisco.
