# Stookey produces uplifting music at Kresge

### ANDREW CROWELL 
Where were you Saturday night?
That's right, Stanford. It seemed as
if everyone and his younger brother
were at the Dormer Street Dance.
Do you know what was going on in
Kresge Auditorium, though?
Wrong. No movie. Nope. Guess
again. It was not a lecture.
Saturday night, Noel Paul Stookey

Magic Dragon." His acoustic solo
works have attracted the attention of
a diverse audience and have even
received some airplay.
Stookey received a warm welcome
from the audience. He admitted that
it would be a "different kind of even
ing." Stookey confessed that he was
recovering from a bad head cold that
would "probably be noticeable." (In

and the Bodyworks Band brought
their mellow and uplifting Christian
sounds to a near-capacity crowd in
the same auditorium now famous for
history and biology lectures. Stookey,
better known as the Paul in Peter,
Paul and Mary, has been performing
both solo and with groups for about
as long as you can say "Puff the

case you're wondering, it didn't affect
the performance at all.)
"The Wedding Song," which
opened the first of two 45-minute sets,
established the warm ambiance which
continued throughout the show.
Stookey demonstrated his virtuoso
talent on acoustic guitar as he riffed
through a toe-tapping rendition of

"The Lady Don't Like Jazz." In the
light-hearted sing-along "Who Took
the Cooky from the Cooky Jar?" the
musician cleverly revealed his ability
for combining humor and child-like
images to present concrete messages
— in this case, that of original sin.
Though the audience laughed heartily
as Stookey explained that the eating
of the forbidden fruit was the start of
the dry-cleaning business, the
predominantly Christian listeners
recognized the serious messages be
hind the songs.
The four-piece band came in and
added Some smooth synthesizer
textures to a rendition of Michael
Blanchard's "Looking out the Win
dow of an Airplane." Bellowing out
the chorus "Creation is a confession
of a love that has just begun,'"
Stookey and his band captured the
ears and hearts of their listeners. "El
Salvador" added politics and anti-war
issues to the performance, and, once
again, the headliner showed his
acoustic guitar acrobatics.

Perhaps one of the most moving
moments, though it is hard to single
them out in a show like this, was the
"Made in the Image of Love" duet
written by Karla Thibodeau, singer
and keyboard player in the
Bodyworks Band. Thibodeau's vocal
and songwriting abilities really shined
on this one.
Stookey put in a few licks against
the recent trends in made-for-radio
pop music. He applauded the audi
ence's attentiveness to the words of
his songs. He reflected on the days
when people used to "grab a six pack,
turn on their car stereos and boogie
into the tarmac." Stookey stated his
hope that the "time of content"
would return to music.
As I left Kresge, the LSJUMB was
just starting into "All Right Now." I
couldn't help but think that that was
the message of the show I had just
heard. In short, Paul Stookey's
spirited Christian music leaves one
with a smile on the outside — and on
the inside.
