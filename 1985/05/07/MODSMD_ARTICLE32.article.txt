# Soapy story and bizarre style mix in 'Paris, Texas'
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
The Sam Shepard trademarks are
clearly visible all through "Paris,
Texas," like signposts. The leading
character, Travis (Harry Dean Stan
ton), is first seen walking with deter
mination but without purpose across
the Mojave Desert; his eyes are those
of a damaged hawk, and he doesn't
say a word — he just keeps moving

'Paris, Texas' isn't
really a Shepard
movie; it's more
like Shepard
dubbed into a
foreign language.
L.M. Kit Carson
'adapted'
Shepard's script,
Wim Wenders di
rected it, and in
the process it's
been turned into
something very
difficult to
describe — sort of
a Teutonic
'Kramer vs.
Kramer.'

until he collapses. The doctor who
treats him (Bernhard Wicki) locates
his brother, Walt (Dean Stockwell),
who hasn't seen him in four years,
since Travis and his wife Jane disap

peared from L.A., leaving their
three-year-old son Hunter (Hunter
Carson) in the care of Walt and his
wife Anne (Aurore Clement). So
Walt travels out to pick up his
itinerant brother and bring him back
home, driving across country in a
rented car because Travis, who at first
refused to talk, eat or sleep, staunchly
refuses to fly. If you've read or seen
"The Curse of the Starving Class" or
"Buried Child" or "True West," you
recognize the motifs — two brothers,
one urban and one rural, a study in
contrasts; the absentee wild-man
father; the desert as the last outpost
of civilization (solitary motels, gas
pumps in the middle of nowhere, rail
road tracks cutting bleakly across the
horizon — some of the same symbols
of an alienated culture that we saw in
"Stranger Than Paradise").
Despite the presence of Harry
Dean Stanton, though, who would
make a brilliant Weston in "Curse of
the Starving Class" (or Lee in "True
West"), "Paris, Texas' isn't really a
Shepard movie; it's more like
Shepard dubbed into a foreign lang
uage. L.M. Kit Carson "adapted"
Shepard's script, Wim Wenders di
rected it, and in the process it's been
turned into something very difficult
to describe — sort of a Teutonic
"Kramer vs. Kramer." (I haven't
read the original screenplay, so I'm
not sure what Shepard intended.)
Watching this movie, with the
deliberate flatness of the semi
improvised acting, the measured
pace, the dead spots between the
lines that reflect the dead spaces be
tween buildings up on the screen, is
such a weird, alienating experience
that for the first time in years I actu
ally had no gut reaction to what I was
seeing — except perhaps surprise that
it amounted to so little by the end. It's
not a dislikable movie in any way; in
fact, once you get accustomed to the
peculiar tempo, some of it is actually
funny (though it's like hearing jokes
in another language — you have to
translate them before you laugh). It
looks terrific: Robby Muller has shot
the film in a clean, elegant style, with
almost as much feeling for the loneli
ness of the landscape of the western
United States as he showed for the
European landscape in Wenders'
"An American Friend," and one
image, of a Fantasyland motel with
neon contours, shivers in its frame.
And it has a haunting score, by that
wunderkind, Ry Cooder. (Almost all
the good music being written for the
moties these days is by Ry Cooder or
Mark Knopfler.)
Stanton is a superb character actor
who has given memorable perfor
mances in a number of films ("The
Missouri Breaks," "Rafferty and the
Gold Dust Twins," "Straight Time,"
"The Rose" and others). But there is
too much of him in "Paris, Texas,"
just as there was in "Repo Man" —
he begins to wear on you. In "Repo
Man" the problem seemed to be that

he was cast more as an emblem than
as an actor, and as the movie
diminished, inevitably, so did he; in
this picture. Travis' infantile behav
ior. which is comically appealing at
first, is a very thin (and strange) joke
for the amount of time he engages in
it. Stanton always commits himself
absolutely to a role — grizzled,
scraggly. with that Elastic Man face
and those peeled eyes, he's all there.
But his commitment forces us to look
too long and hard at Travis's childish
ness and see it for the writer's and ac
tor's conceit that it is. (At one point
he dresses up, with the help of Walt's
Chicano maid, to resemble a fairy tale
image of a rich father so that he can
impress Hunter. It's a dog of a scene
— amateur political theater of the
late 1960s variety — something I'd
hoped never to have to sit through
again.) And then, without warning,
he drops it; having spent a certain
(unspecified) amount of time living
with his brother and sister-in-law and
getting reacquainted with his son, he
suddenly becomes a full-fledged adult
again, and takes Hunter off in search
of his mother (Nastassja Kinski,
looking ethereal but trapped in an ut
terly improbable Texas accent).
Stanton does have one extraordi
nary scene, though. When he locates
Jane, she is working at a peepsho'w in
Houston (which Wenders and Muller
shoot imaginatively, with a real sense
of dislocation — as if this sleazy club
were on Mars), taking calls from
horny men whose faces she cannot
see, who hide out on the other side of
a two-way mirror. Travis steps into
the booth and lifts the receiver, but
he can't look at first; blinking back
tears, he keeps his head lowered, and
when he finally raises it he is clearly
in agony. She talks to him as if he
were any john (though she becomes
reticent when he implies that she
sleeps with the men who call her up),
not suspecting who he is and what
pain she is causing him. It's a hell of
an encounter. This must have been
what Paul Schrader was trying to get
at in "Hardcore" but, Puritan that he
is, never even came close to: the an
guish of a man who finds that some
one he loves has hurled herself over
the edge of Hell.
The problem is that Travis himself
is such an on-the-edge character that
we don't have a context for his
response to Jane's situation. In a
sense, Wenders is trying to have it
both ways: He places a bizarre figure
at the center of his movie, maintains a
dry ironic tone and "a molasses pace
that undercut the realistic level of the
story at every turn, yet what he finally
offers us is realism at its most basic
level: a soapy story of a mother and
child reunion. Hunter Carson (the
son of screenwriter L.M. Kit Carson)
has silky blond hair that covers his
ears like a shell, and desolate eyes; he
looks androgynous, like a fairy sprite,
and he has a cracked, nasal voice with
just the trace of a lisp. But he behaves

pretty much like any other precocious
seven-year-old, except that he seems
more-practised at everything he does
— he's as carefully rehearsed, as
much in control, as a kid actor from
the Shirley Temple-Our Gang era.
Wonders must have chosen this
curdled cherub of a child because of
his spooky looks, hut since they don't
add up to anything, you begin to
wonder what Wenders had in mind,
The last 20 minutes of the picture, in
which Travis sacrifices his own claim
to Hunter so the boy can be with his
mother, are loony and sappy at the
same time, but 1 suspect that though
it doesn't really make sense (as far as we
can see, the boy would be much bet
ter off with his father), it's the suffer
ing nobility Travis demonstrates at
the end and the weepy resurgence of
mother love that have won "Paris,
Texas" so much praise, not its less
conventional qualities. A woman sit
ting behind me at the theater who
noticed 1 was taking notes during the
picture asked me afterwards what 1
thought of it.and though 1 couldn't
answer right away, she was sure of
her own response: She'd been moved,
she said, because she was a mother.

It's not a dis
likable movie in
any way; in fact,
once you get ac
customed to the
particular tempo,
some of it is actu
ally funny (though
it's like hearing
jokes in another

laugh).

for the amount of time he engages in
it. Stanton always commits himself
absolutely to a role — grizzled,
scraggly. with that Elastic Man face
and those peeled eyes, he's all there.
But his commitment forces us to look
too long and hard at Travis's childish
ness and see it for the writer's and ac
tor's conceit that it is. (At one point
he dresses up, with the help of Walt's
Chicano maid, to resemble a fairy tale
image of a rich father so that he can
impress Hunter. It's a dog of a scene
— amateur political theater of the
late 1960s variety — something I'd
hoped never to have to sit through
again.) And then, without warning,
he drops it; having spent a certain
(unspecified) amount of time living
with his brother and sister-in-law and
getting reacquainted with his son, he
suddenly becomes a full-fledged adult
again, and takes Hunter off in search
of his mother (Nastassja Kinski,
looking ethereal but trapped in an ut
terly improbable Texas accent).
Stanton does have one extraordi
nary scene, though. When he locates
Jane, she is working at a peepsho'w in
Houston (which Wenders and Muller
shoot imaginatively, with a real sense
of dislocation — as if this sleazy club
were on Mars), taking calls from
horny men whose faces she cannot
see, who hide out on the other side of
a two-way mirror. Travis steps into
the booth and lifts the receiver, but
he can't look at first; blinking back
tears, he keeps his head lowered, and
when he finally raises it he is clearly
in agony. She talks to him as if he
were any john (though she becomes
reticent when he implies that she
sleeps with the men who call her up),
not suspecting who he is and what
pain she is causing him. It's a hell of
an encounter. This must have been
what Paul Schrader was trying to get
at in "Hardcore" but, Puritan that he
is, never even came close to: the an
guish of a man who finds that some
one he loves has hurled herself over
the edge of Hell.
The problem is that Travis himself
is such an on-the-edge character that
we don't have a context for his
response to Jane's situation. In a
sense, Wenders is trying to have it
both ways: He places a bizarre figure
at the center of his movie, maintains a
dry ironic tone and "a molasses pace
that undercut the realistic level of the
story at every turn, yet what he finally
offers us is realism at its most basic
level: a soapy story of a mother and
child reunion. Hunter Carson (the
son of screenwriter L.M. Kit Carson)
has silky blond hair that covers his
ears like a shell, and desolate eyes; he
looks androgynous, like a fairy sprite,
and he has a cracked, nasal voice with
just the trace of a lisp. But he behaves

pretty much like any other precocious
seven-year-old, except that he seems
more-practised at everything he does
— he's as carefully rehearsed, as
much in control, as a kid actor from
the Shirley Temple-Our Gang era.
Wonders must have chosen this
curdled cherub of a child because of
his spooky looks, hut since they don't
add up to anything, you begin to
wonder what Wenders had in mind,
The last 20 minutes of the picture, in
which Travis sacrifices his own claim
to Hunter so the boy can be with his
mother, are loony and sappy at the
same time, but 1 suspect that though
it doesn't really make sense (as far as we
can see, the boy would be much bet
ter off with his father), it's the suffer
ing nobility Travis demonstrates at
the end and the weepy resurgence of
mother love that have won "Paris,
Texas" so much praise, not its less
conventional qualities. A woman sit
ting behind me at the theater who
noticed 1 was taking notes during the
picture asked me afterwards what 1
thought of it.and though 1 couldn't
answer right away, she was sure of
her own response: She'd been moved,
she said, because she was a mother.

It's not a dis
likable movie in
any way; in fact,

Wim Wenders' first American movie,"
"Hammett," was a box office fiasco,«
and he felt the producer, Francis]
Coppola, and Hollywood as a whole
had betrayed him. Perhaps he's fi
nally learned how to make it in
America.


The Sam Shepard trademarks are
clearly visible all through "Paris,
Texas," like signposts. The leading
character, Travis (Harry Dean Stan
ton), is first seen walking with deter
mination but without purpose across
the Mojave Desert; his eyes are those
of a damaged hawk, and he doesn't
say a word — he just keeps moving

until he collapses. The doctor who
treats him (Bernhard Wicki) locates
his brother, Walt (Dean Stockwell),
who hasn't seen him in four years,
since Travis and his wife Jane disap

peared from L.A., leaving their
three-year-old son Hunter (Hunter
Carson) in the care of Walt and his
wife Anne (Aurore Clement). So
Walt travels out to pick up his
itinerant brother and bring him back
home, driving across country in a
rented car because Travis, who at first
refused to talk, eat or sleep, staunchly
refuses to fly. If you've read or seen
"The Curse of the Starving Class" or
"Buried Child" or "True West," you
recognize the motifs — two brothers,
one urban and one rural, a study in
contrasts; the absentee wild-man
father; the desert as the last outpost
of civilization (solitary motels, gas
pumps in the middle of nowhere, rail
road tracks cutting bleakly across the
horizon — some of the same symbols
of an alienated culture that we saw in
"Stranger Than Paradise").
Despite the presence of Harry
Dean Stanton, though, who would
make a brilliant Weston in "Curse of
the Starving Class" (or Lee in "True
West"), "Paris, Texas' isn't really a
Shepard movie; it's more like
Shepard dubbed into a foreign lang
uage. L.M. Kit Carson "adapted"
Shepard's script, Wim Wenders di
rected it, and in the process it's been
turned into something very difficult
to describe — sort of a Teutonic
"Kramer vs. Kramer." (I haven't
read the original screenplay, so I'm
not sure what Shepard intended.)
Watching this movie, with the
deliberate flatness of the semi
improvised acting, the measured
pace, the dead spots between the
lines that reflect the dead spaces be
tween buildings up on the screen, is
such a weird, alienating experience
that for the first time in years I actu
ally had no gut reaction to what I was
seeing — except perhaps surprise that
it amounted to so little by the end. It's
not a dislikable movie in any way; in
fact, once you get accustomed to the
peculiar tempo, some of it is actually
funny (though it's like hearing jokes
in another language — you have to
translate them before you laugh). It
looks terrific: Robby Muller has shot
the film in a clean, elegant style, with
almost as much feeling for the loneli
ness of the landscape of the western
United States as he showed for the
European landscape in Wenders'
"An American Friend," and one
image, of a Fantasyland motel with
neon contours, shivers in its frame.
And it has a haunting score, by that
wunderkind, Ry Cooder. (Almost all
the good music being written for the
moties these days is by Ry Cooder or
Mark Knopfler.)
Stanton is a superb character actor
who has given memorable perfor
mances in a number of films ("The
Missouri Breaks," "Rafferty and the
Gold Dust Twins," "Straight Time,"
"The Rose" and others). But there is
too much of him in "Paris, Texas,"
just as there was in "Repo Man" —
he begins to wear on you. In "Repo
Man" the problem seemed to be that

he was cast more as an emblem than
as an actor, and as the movie
diminished, inevitably, so did he; in
this picture. Travis' infantile behav
ior. which is comically appealing at
first, is a very thin (and strange) joke
for the amount of time he engages in
it. Stanton always commits himself
absolutely to a role — grizzled,
scraggly. with that Elastic Man face

any way; in fact,
once you get ac
customed to the
particular tempo,
some of it is actu
ally funny (though
it's like hearing
jokes in another
language — you
have to translate
them before you
laugh).

Wim Wenders' first American movie,"
"Hammett," was a box office fiasco,«
and he felt the producer, Francis]
Coppola, and Hollywood as a whole
had betrayed him. Perhaps he's fi
nally learned how to make it in
America.
