## Speakers encourage gay visibility 
### FELICIA PAIK 
As part of this year's Gay and Les
bian Awareness Week, two clergy
members spoke yesterday on ways
the gay and lesbian community can
become better accepted by the main
stream population.
Kevin Gordon, a Roman Catholic
theologian, and Loey Powell, a Prot
estant minister, outlined various
perspectives of anti-gay and lesbian
sentiment in a talk entitled "Anti-
Lesbian/Gay Invective — The Man
agement of Compulsory Miseduca
tion."
Gordon, who headed a 1981 task
force which examined gay and lesbian
issues in San Francisco, said, "A
change in public opinion on the gay
and lesbian movement will come
when silence and invisibility become
voices and presence."
He said American opinion could be
altered by using two tools: education
and familiarity. The general popula
tion needs to learn that being gay "is
not a choice but a constant orienta
tion and is not something one creates,
but discovers," he said.
People need to be familiarized with
the gay community and be "met with
the personal presence of someone
who is openly gay, rather than with
silence," he said.
Gordon also cited five common in
vectives used against gays and les
bians. First, he presented the "natural
law" or "gender-role violation" argu
ment. "Gays and lesbians are refusing
to do what human beings are created
to do, which is to procreate," he said.

Second, he discussed the sentiment
that being gay is a personal disorder
or a sickness. Third, he outlined the
argument that the actions of gays and
lesbians are in aversion to traditional
moral and religious values. Fourth,
Gordon spoke of the social pathology
argument, that the presence of a gay
community could cause "the downfall
of civilization." Finally, he presented
the notion that the general public
wants to create a "privatization" of
the issue; it would rather appear un
interested and bury the issue.
Powell, the National Coordinator
of the United Church Coalition for
Lesbian/Gay Concerns, followed up
with thoughts of her own. She spoke
of her "permanent commitment to all
systems which are oppressed," and
said that "feminism is a perspective,
not a theory."
Powell equated the struggles of the
gay and lesbian community with the
anti-apartheid movement and the
conflicts in Central America. She
asserted that she "listens creatively"
and tries to understand problems of
all who are oppressed. But she
reminded the audience of the impor
tance of understanding "what the op
pressor is thinking."
She said that certain individuals, in
conversation, refer to gay men and
lesbians as "non-heterosexual."
Powell encouraged people to call
others as they wished to be ad
dressed, rather than creating other
terms for them. She also called upon
gays and lesbians to "live openly,
honestly and with integrity."
