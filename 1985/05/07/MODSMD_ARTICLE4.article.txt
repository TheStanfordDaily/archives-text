Representatives of Stanford Out
Of South Africa (SOSA), University
President Donald Kennedy and Stan
ford trustees will present their argu
ments on divestment at today's public
forum in the Inner Quad.
The forum, scheduled for 5:30 this
evening, is the only ma jor demand by
SOSA to which the University has ac
quiesced.
The general views of both sides —
presented in full-page advertisements
in yesterday's Daily — are well
known. In his open letter to the Stan
ford community, Kennedy said, "I
believe that divestment is extremely
unlikely to have beneficial effects
upon the circumstances we all
deplore."
In its advertisement, however,
SOSA argued that divestment is for
"the sake of the South African
people" and asks the University for
"commitment to total divestment ot
stock in any company operating in
South Africa."
In addition to the forum and total
divestment. SOSA has demanded dis
closure of personal investment
portfolios of all trustees and William
Massy, vice president for business
and finance; an open University in
vestment policy; a Reinvestment
Planning Commission that includes

student representatives with full

Committee on Investment Responsi
bility; and a University-supported
boycott of companies with sub
sidiaries in South Africa, according to
the SOSA advertisement.
The two-hour forum will allow 45
minutes for SOSA to present its argu
ments for divestment and 25 minutes
for Kennedy and the trustees to pres
ent their case against divestment.
Kennedy and the trustees were of
fered equal time, but Kennedy opted
for only 25 minutes in order to have
"plenty of time for questions and
answers," said Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons.
"A hit of questions were raised last
week (at the private meeting between
the liaison committee of SOSA and
13 trustees), and it was agreed that
they would be answered at the
forum," Lyons said, explaining
SOSA's need for a full 45 minutes.
Each side will have five minutes for
a final statement, and then the forum
will be opened to questions from the
audience.

speak about conditions in South
Africa. Education Prof. Joel Samoff
will speak on the role of the Univer
sity. and Theodore Brown, founder
and president of the Institute for Cor
porate Research and Education and
former financial consultant at Shear
son/American Express, will address
the financial implications of divest
ment. John Harrington of Working
Assets, an investment firm which
places money in what it calls socially
responsible companies, was supposed
to have Brown's place but was
replaced late last night because of a
scheduling conflict, said L.ily Shiue. a
representative of SOSA.
Kennedy and three as yet un
announced trustees are expected to
elaborate on the University's position
against total divestment.
SOSA's panel to answer questions
from the audience will include
Brown. Walter Geys, a student mem
ber of the Board of Trustees' Com
mittee on Investment; Louis Edozien,
a member of Coalition Against
Apartheid; and SOSA members Bill
Cohn, Stacey Leyton and David
Troutt.
People other than those scheduled
to speak at the forum are on the panel
"basically to reflect the diversity,
breadth and depth of SOSA," said
Steve Phillips, chairman of the Black
Student Union and an organizer of
SOSA.
The University is paying for ex
penses related to the forum, said Phil
lips.
One of the expenses is the two full
page advertisements, both of which
are being paid for by the Office of the
President, said Marlene Wine, special
assistant to the president. The total
cost for the advertisements is $1,953.
The BSU is paying for the SOSA
advertisement and will be reimbursed
by the Office of the President, ac
cording to Phillips.
"We asked the University to fund
the forum, and they agreed," said

Phillips. "The reality of the situation
is that the students have the energy
and the University has the money,"
he said. "We're doing all the work.
We just asked that the money be put
into the forum."
Dean of Student Affairs Jim Lyons
explained the University's monetary
support by saying, "The University
. . . has wanted very much to encour
age as full a discussion as possible
about South Africa, apartheid and
divestment. . . . Stanford ought to be
a place where disagreement can be
open and vigorous, and rules of reason
can be applied to an argument. And
certainly a forum is designed to do
that."
Lyons said he does not see the cur
rent protest as "us against them. It's
our University and that includes stu
dents, faculty and staff. ... 1 see it as
an effort on the part of many people
to inform themselves about condi
tions in South Africa, apartheid in
particular, to find ways that people at
Stanford can affect those conditions
for the better. Some are saying divest,
others are saying there are other
ways."
In preparation for the forum,
SOSA prepared a position paper out
lining its argument for total divest
ment. The paper was distributed last
night and will be distributed again
today, according to Cohn.
To facilitate attendance of the
forum, dormitory dining halls will
open at 4:30 this afternoon to allow
students to pick up a box dinner, said
Maxine Anderson, manager of Uni
versity Food Service.
"I got a call from (Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs for Residential Edu
cation) Norm Robinson, and he
asked for cooperation and 1 said,
'Sure,' " Anderson said.
The protest began approximately
two weeks ago with a noon rally in
White Plaza. Students have been
sleeping in the Ouad outside of Ken
nedy's office since then, with some
dorm groups and graduate students
from some departments pledging to
spend one night of every week there.
