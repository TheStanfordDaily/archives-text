Representatives of Stanford Out
Of South Africa (SOSA), University
President Donald Kennedy and Stan
ford trustees will present their argu
ments on divestment at today's public
forum in the Inner Quad.
The forum, scheduled for 5:30 this
evening, is the only ma jor demand by
SOSA to which the University has ac
quiesced.
The general views of both sides —
presented in full-page advertisements
in yesterday's Daily — are well
known. In his open letter to the Stan
ford community, Kennedy said, "I
believe that divestment is extremely
unlikely to have beneficial effects
upon the circumstances we all
deplore."
In its advertisement, however,
SOSA argued that divestment is for
"the sake of the South African
people" and asks the University for
"commitment to total divestment ot
stock in any company operating in
South Africa."
In addition to the forum and total
divestment. SOSA has demanded dis
closure of personal investment
portfolios of all trustees and William
Massy, vice president for business
and finance; an open University in
vestment policy; a Reinvestment
Planning Commission that includes

student representatives with full

Committee on Investment Responsi
bility; and a University-supported
boycott of companies with sub
sidiaries in South Africa, according to
the SOSA advertisement.
The two-hour forum will allow 45
minutes for SOSA to present its argu
ments for divestment and 25 minutes
for Kennedy and the trustees to pres
ent their case against divestment.
Kennedy and the trustees were of
fered equal time, but Kennedy opted
for only 25 minutes in order to have
"plenty of time for questions and
answers," said Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons.
"A hit of questions were raised last
week (at the private meeting between
the liaison committee of SOSA and
13 trustees), and it was agreed that
they would be answered at the
forum," Lyons said, explaining
SOSA's need for a full 45 minutes.
Each side will have five minutes for
a final statement, and then the forum
will be opened to questions from the
audience.
Donna Anderson and Alice Stauf
