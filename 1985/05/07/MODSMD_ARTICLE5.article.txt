I lie Ga\ and I esbian Alliance at Stanford (GLAS)
continued its 1 1 th annual Gay and l esbian Awareness
(GALA) Week yesterday with Gay Blue Jeans Day,
the purpose of which, according to GLAS archivist
Gerard Koskovich. was to shock people into thinking
about the presence of diverse sexual orientations on
campus.
"A lot of people who think that they don't mind gay
people suddenly find out that they're wondering
whether they should wear blue jeans or not. because
they're worried that somebody might think they're
that way. Koskovich said.

next Wednesday, all people who wear blue jeans are
people who like to eat pineapples?" he went on to say.
"Would anybod\ be worried about whether they were
going to wear blue jeans that day or not? We want
people to be faced with the reality that this is a charged

Koskovich said that $5,800 was allocated for this
year's week ot activities, which comprises 15 events
over the course ot this week. I he ASSU Program

other University departments, the Stanford Progres

part of the "whole community"' of Stanford. "We go
