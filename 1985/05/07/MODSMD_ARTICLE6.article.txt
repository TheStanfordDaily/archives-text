# New fund to provide aid to minority grad students
## 
### DAVID S. GOLDSTEIN Staff writer 
The Ford Foundation announced
last week a $9 million fellowship pro
pram aimed at increasing the number
of minority faculty members
nationwide.
The philanthropic foundation,
based in New York, ran a similar pro
gram in the late 1960s and early '70s
that aided black colleges and minority
doctoral students, but ended that pro
gram in 1981.
"The percentage of minority
Ph.D.s who were obtaining faculty
positions was certainly decreasing, so
we thought it would be appropriate
for us to re-enter the field." said
Leslie Ciottleib. a foundation public
information officer.
The new program will be adminis
tered by the National Research
Council of the National Academy of
Sciences, which for the next three
years will award 40 three-year fellow -
ships of S 10.000 plus an annual
Sh.OOO for tuition and fees. The foun
dation will also provide 10 $18,000
grants each of the next three years to
minority graduate students who have
only dissertations left to complete
doctoral requirements.
Cecilia Burciaga. associate dean of
graduate studies and research, has

been working on the problem of
declining graduate enrollments of
black. Puerto Rican. Mexican-
American and native American stu
dents at Stanford, particularly in doc
toral programs. Although Burciaga
said she was unfamiliar with the new
Ford program, she said it sounds as
though it may help the nationwide
problem of declining minority
graduate enrollments and the result
ing decline in minority college faculty
appointments.
Burciaga cited the earlier Ford pro
grams. which she said "really paid
off." She said 85 percent of the
minority students who received Ford
grants finished their doctoral degrees.
Ford "knew that it (the fellowship
program) made a difference." she
said.
The grants will benefit non
minority students, too. Burciaga said.
The Ford fellowships to minority stu
dents will "relieve University funding
somewhat." freeing more money tor
other students, she said. She noted
that Stanford has no special awards
for minority graduate students.
But Burciaga said money is only
"half the issue." She said some
minority students from financially
disadvantaged backgrounds decide
not to apply to doctoral programs be

cause of the cost. Universities
therefore should not only help
minority students who have decided
to apply, but should also solicit more
applications from minority students,
she said.
"The real issue is knowing at what
point people make the decision to go
to graduate school and get the
Ph.D.." Burciaga said.
The grant program may have some
detrimental side effects. Burciaga
said. Some professors may mistakenly
think minority doctoral students have
full funding and may overlook them
when seeking research assistants, she
said. She suggested universities and
the foundation alternate student
funding each year, so institutions will
have to grant more research and
teaching assistantships.
All in all. Burciaga welcomes the
grants, but in light of recent Univer
sity reports that minority graduate
enrollments and minority faculty ap
pointments here have declined, she
said grants may not be enough â€”
here or elsewhere.
"Stanford is not alone in feeling
that something must be done." Bur
ciaga said.
Of the approximately 31.000 doc
torates awarded nationwide each
year, only about 1,380 degrees go to
minority students, The New York
Times reported last week. It said
among minority students receiving
doctorates, blacks predominated, fol
lowed by Hispanics and native

Americans, respectively.
Minority graduate students may
apply for the Ford fellowships begin
ning in September. Officials of the
foundation, which was created with
an endowment from the Ford Motor
Co. in 1936 and made a national or
ganization in 1950, say they expect
several thousand applications. The
Ford Foundation is no longer associ
ated with Ford Motor Co., Gottleib
said.
