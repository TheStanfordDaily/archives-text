Shelling claims more lives in Beirut
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Christian and Moslem gunners battled across
the city's dividing line yesterday in bloody artillery duels that have
claimed dozens of victims in the past week, many of them civilians killed
by stray shells.
President Amin Gemayel met with the militia commanders from both
sides in an attempt to arrange a cease-fire and and a neutral zone be
tween the two parts of the city.
Police reported 11 people killed and 67 wounded since Sunday night.
That raised the known toll to 40 dead and 254 wounded since the ar
tillery, rocket and mortar battles began April 28.
Among yesterday's casualties were 12 Lebanese army soldiers who
suffered bullet and shrapnel wounds in the Ras el-Nabaa neighborhood
that runs along the battle zone.
The bloodshed, which shows no signs of abating, is accompanied by
fears that Gemayel is losing authority among fellow Christians who are
split over his pro-Syrian policies.
The fragile coalition government of Moslems and Christians also is
split along sectarian lines. It appears helpless, unable even to agree on a
place to meet because Cabinet ministers fear to cross into rival territory.
Militiamen shoot it out among the shell-blasted buildings
of the 3-mile-long "green line" that cuts through the city from north to
south.
Official sources, who spoke on condition they not be identified, said
Gemayel seeks a a neutral, militia-free zone along the city's demarcation
line with security handled by religiously mixed units of the 37,000-
man Lebanese army.
United States will boycott parade
MOSCOW — Ambassador Arthur Hartman of the United States will
not attend the Soviet victory parade in Red Square because the issue of
the killing of a U.S. Army officer in East Germany is not resolved, the
embassy said.
A U.S. Embassy spokesman said Hartman would boycott the military
parade commemorating the 40th anniversary of victory over the Nazis
because the death of Maj. Arthur Nicholson in East Germany was "still
unresolved."
Nicholson was shot and killed by a Soviet sentry March 24 near Lud
wigslust. The Soviets said Nicholson, a member of a U.S. liaison mission
in East Germany, was spying in a restricted military area. The United
States has denied the Soviet charges and has demanded an apology and
compensation from the Soviets.
"At a time when the Nicholson case is still unresolved, we did not feel
it was appropriate for the ambassador or a military representative to at
tend a military parade on Red Square," said a U.S. Embassy spokesman
who spoke on condition he not be identified.
The Soviet Union's other World War II allies, Britain and France, are
breaking a five-year boycott of the parade and will send ambassadors to
the event.
Spokesmen for the British and French embassies said their ambas
sadors would go to all four Soviet ceremonies marking the triumph over
Nazi Germany. They are a wreath-laying ceremony and a meeting in the
Kremlin tomorrow followed by the Thursday parade and a Kremlin
reception following the parade.
NATO ambassadors all boycotted the Nov. 7 Revolution Day military
parade in J 980 because of the Afghanistan intervention, but some have
attended since.
Hartman also will skip the Kremlin meeting but will attend the
wreath-laying ceremony and the Kremlin reception.
Human rights meeting opens today
OTTAWA — An assembly of government specialists on human rights
from 35 countries opens today, and Western nations plan to accuse the
Soviet Union of violating pledges made in Helsinki a decade ago.
Canada, the United States and all nations of Europe except Albania
are represented at the meeting. It was called to review progress in
human rights since the 1975 Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe at Helsinki, Finland.
"We're hammering at the theme that human rights is an element in
the business of strengthening cooperation," said Harry Jay, Canadian
ambassador to the meeting, which is expected to last about six weeks.
"The focus of attention on human rights will be very greatly reinforced."
The Ottawa meeting stems from a previous assembly of the same 35
countries in Madrid, which ended contentiously in 1983 soon after a So
viet warplane shot down a South Korean passenger jet, killing all 269
people aboard.
That conference directed that "experts" from the participating nations
gather to review "respect, in their states, for human rights and funda
mental freedoms."
Richard Schifter, U.S. ambassador to the meeting, said he would cite
Soviet violations of the Helsinki accords, "not case-by-case, but topic
by-topic," with particular concern for the repression of members of
groups established to monitor compliance with the Helsinki provisions.
Because any decision at the meeting must be taken by consensus of all
35 countries, there is little prospect for quick or dramatic action.
Once the conference begins, neutral nations such as Switzerland,
Sweden and Austria are expected to play key roles in bridging the gaps
that develop between the Soviet bloc and the West.
The Soviet representative, Vsevolod Sofinsky, said before leaving
Moscow last month that each country should talk only about its own af
fairs at the Ottawa meeting, not discuss the human rights situation in
other nations.
Western delegates said the Soviet representative took the same posi
tion in the preparatory sessions, but had no chance of prevailing. In the
end. the Soviets are expected to criticize the United States for its race re
lations. unemployment and housing problems, and failure to guarantee
women's rights in the constitution.
Reagan aides cite Bitburg 'triumph'
BITBURG, West Germany — A beaming President Reagan
got a big round of applause from his staff as he boarded Air
Force One on his return from the Bitburg military cemetery, an eight
minute event that had generated the biggest controversy of his
presidency.
The big question, though, is whether he will get similar reviews back
home, offsetting the 25 days of criticism from Jews, veterans. Congress
and even his closest ally in NATO, British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, that led up to Bitburg.
White House officials had acknowledged in advance they botched up
plans for Reagan's trip by overlooking the fact that the military cemetery
in Bitburg contained the graves of 49 Nazi SS troopers.
The criticism and anger that exploded after that revelation seemed to
overshadow everthing Reagan did and drowned out his explanation that
visiting Bitburg would underscore reconciliation between West Ger
mans and the United States four decades after World War 11.
In the end. Reagan proclaimed. "It's been a wonderful day,"and his
aides insisted Bitburg will be remembered as a great triumph.
"It could well be the most important 10 minutes of the Reagan
presidency and vet the great communicator didn't speak a word." said
White House deput\ press secretary Peter Roussel. "Once all is said and
done. I think Bitburg will prove to be a positive thine for the president."
