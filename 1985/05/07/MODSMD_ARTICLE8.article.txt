# Demonstrators protest at arrival
## Reagan to talk with Spanish leaders 
### 
MADRID. Spain â€” President Reagan, fresh
from urging cheering German students to "create a
new Europe." arrived yesterday for talks with
Spanish leaders opposed to his Nicaragua policies
and pressed by street demonstrators to oust U.S.
forces from Spanish soil.
Leaving behind a difficult economic summit and
controversy over his visit to a Nazi grave site in
West Germany, Reagan and his wife, Nancy,
stepped off Air Force One into brilliant sunlight.
They were greeted by King Juan Carlos and Oueen
Sofia.
The day before, 200,000 anti-American demon
strators marched in Madrid and other Spanish cities
to protest the visit. They urged closing four military
bases leased from Spain under a 1953 agreement,
and pulling Spain out of NATO.
At the airport, the two couples reviewed troops,
while, out of their sight and earshot, some 30
Nicaraguans protested the U.S. trade embargo
imposed on their country, another major issue on
Reagan's agenda here.
With the government refusing demonstration
permits on weekdays, protesters urged Madrid resi
dents to shut off their lights and bang pots and pans
for 10 minutes during Reagan's first evening in

Spain. Only a modest din was heard in the city cen
ter at the appointed hour, and most lights remained
lit.
From the airport, the Reagans left for their
residence during this two-day stay. El Pardo
Palace, a 63-room estate nine miles northwest of
Madrid which served as home and headquarters to
Spain's authoritarian ruler Gen. Francisco Franco
from 1939 to his death in 1975.
There, Reagan met briefly with Socialist Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez, who favors a reduction
in the U.S. military presence and whose foreign
ministry has criticized the Nicaragua embargo.
As the two leaders posed for photographs, Gon
zalez said, "I hope we will talk about everything."
Asked about Spain's opposition to his
Nicaraguan embargo. Reagan replied, ' Perhaps
they don't understand our position. We are going
to try to make it more clear."
Of the Spanish demonstrations, the president
said, "1 don't know if there is anyone more used to
demonstrations than me."
Before leaving Germany, White House deputy
press secretary Larry Speakes said the president's
speech to the European parliament in Strasbourg,
France, tomorrow would contain "very important

. .. definite proposals regarding the Soviets."
Speakes indicated these would involve increased
U.S.-Soviet military contact to avoid incidents like
the March 24 shooting death of Maj. Arthur Nic
holson. a U.S. observer at a Soviet military installa
tion in East Germany, and the Sept. 1, 1983,
downing of a Korean Air Lines passenger plane by
Soviet fighters, killing 269 people.
In Madrid, Robert McFarlane, the national se
curity adviser, said Reagan would recommend four
specific measures designed to reduce mistrust be
tween the United States and the Soviet Union.
McFarlane said the proposals would involve ex
changing observers at military exercises, better
contact between the militaries of each side and a
concrete commitment to the non-use of force as
well as a direct communications link between miti-'
tary headquarters.
Speakes told reporters in Madrid that the presi
dent's proposals provide "an opportunity to see if
the new Soviet leadership is serious in its intention
to deal with the United States on matters that could
reduce tensions."
Before retiring for the night, the king and queen
entertained the Reagan with a private dinner at the
royal residence, Zarzuela Palace.
