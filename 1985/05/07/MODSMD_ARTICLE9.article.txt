# Senate budget battle resumes
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Senate is
resuming its budget debate after a
weekend off for senators to ponder a
series of proposed cuts — including
possibly their own salaries — while
the House returns to business under
the cloud of a Republican revolt.
Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) pro
posed on Friday to cut the congres
sional salary of $75,100 by 10 per
cent, only to lose in a 49-49 tie. The
symbolic proposal came after the
Senate approved cutting $17.5 billion
from Medicare and Medicaid over the
next three years.
"It is not fair for Congress to ask
the public to sacrifice if its members
are not willing to accept cuts from
their own pockets," said Sen. Strom
Thurmond (R-S.C.) in a statement.

"If we are going to be successful in
reducing the deficit, we must cut
everywhere, and Congress' pay
should not be exempt."
But Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-
W.Va.) said the proposal was
"brought up frivolously for political
purposes." The money saved would
total about $4 million, or $2 million
less than the millionaire Rockefeller
recently spent for a Washington man
sion.
For the pay cut plan to return, one
of the senators who voted against the
cut would have to ask that the pro
posal be reconsidered.
The House will attempt its first
major business since last week's brief
Republican walkout. GOP members

matched from the chamber Wednes
day after Democrats first refused to
call for a new election, and then in
stalled Democrat Frank McCloskey
in a disputed Indiana congressional
seat.
Lengthy House debate is expected,
beginning today, on dozens of
amendments to a bill authorizing
money for the State Department and
related agencies for the next two fis
cal years. At least a half dozen other
bills also are expected to reach the
House floor.
But the budget is expected to
consume the Senate's week, with
debate on controversial proposals in
cluding the elimination of Amtrak
subsidies, Small Business Adminis
tration loans and the Job Corps. <*

The Senate is debating a deficit re
duction package designed to save
$295 billion over three years. But
major facets of the package —r
worked out between the White
House and Senate Republican
leaders — have already beep
scrapped.
The Medicare and Medicaid cuts
approved were less drastic than the
cutbacks proposed in the package and
the Senate also rejected a plan to
reduce cost-of-living increases in So
cial Security benefits.
The Senate last week also voted to
slice the administration's military
buildup by $ 17.7 billion over the next
three years, holding the 1986 rise in
Pentagon spending at the rate of in
flation.
