Often, the key to a major investment like a personal computer is good financing That's precisely what SFCU offers
— Computer Loans at rates and terms so good that the system of your dreams is well within reach
A Computer Loan from SFCU is also the ideal complement to the university's MICRODISC program MICRODISC
will give you a good price SFCU will give you a great loan.
The credit union will lend 90% of the purchase price of a micro-computer system to a maximum amount of
$5,000. The term of repayment can be as long as 36 months. There's NO prepayment penalty and NO hidden
charges, only a $25 processing fee due with the loan application. The interest rate is good too — currently 15.00%*
for a variable-rate loan and 16 50%* for a fixed-rate loan
But the Interest rate can get even better. We'll subtract a full 2% from the rate if you've been participating in
Direct Deposit of your payroll, Social Security, or recurring benefit/pension checks for at least three months You
may also enroll in Direct Deposit when you apply for your loan, and we'll cut the rate by 2% within 90 days **
Students who want to buy a computer can use a qualifying parent as co-signer. In this case, both persons
