Vets get belated parade
NEW YORK — New York threw a belated
welcome-home party yesterday for 25,000 veter
ans of the Vietnam war'with parade
that drew tears and cheers echofng along the bbft s "
crete canyons of lower Manhattan.
Leaning from office windows, standing on
fences, and precariously perched atop vending
trucks, throngs cheered and waved American
flags as group after group of veterans from across
the nation passed by, many wearing jungle
fatigues.
And they cheered when Gen. William
Westmoreland, the soldiers' commander for part
of the war, climbed down from a reviewing stand
to march with his men alongside 26 Medal of
Honor recipients at the head of the column.
Police estimated the crowd at 1 million.
Signs lining the route read: "We should have
said it sooner — we're proud of you," and
"Thanks, so much."
The air was filled with confetti and trees were
webbed with streamers as the parade made its
way from Brooklyn across the Brooklyn Bridge
and down to Battery Park at Manhattan's south
ern tip.
Jerry White, 35, of Manhattan, a former
Marine who said he served in Vietnam "13
months, 23 days and 6 hours," was bitter that the
nation's approval was so long in coming.
White did not march, saying he came out of
respect for those who died.
"I don't consider this a 'thank you,' and it's not
a parade. It's just a mob, it's more like a political
convention or something. Ten years is too late for
anything."
New farm bill proposed
WASHINGTON — A dozen congressional
Democrats yesterday proposed sweeping changes
in U.S. farm policy they said would offer suffer

ing farmers higher incomes at the expense of
about $13 billion more on consumer food bills.
The changes proposed by the Democrats
would include sharply higher government price
supports for commodities like whea ( t and corn,
Together with provisions for farmer-imposed
curbs on production.
Sponsors contended the changes would help
get rid of price-depressing surpluses and give
farmers a way to earn their way out of the current
financial stress in rural America.
The legislation is sharply at odds with a stack
of other suggested farm bills being proposed to
replace the law that expires Sept. 30. Those bills,
for the most part, would reduce price supports in
order to make U.S. commodities more competi
tive in the export market.
"This is the only bill that would increase net
farm income immediately," said Sen. Tom
Harkin (D-Iowa), the bill's primary sponsor. He
said higher commodity prices might further cut
into the volume of already slumping U.S. farm
exports, but contended the dollar value of those
exports would increase.
Belushi reporters mute
LOS ANGELES— Two reporters, citing Cali
fornia's news shield law, refused to testify in the
John Belushi murder case yesterday, and a judge
set a hearing for them to say why they shouldn't
be held in contempt.
Municipal Court Judge Brian Crahan granted a
request from lawyers for Christopher Van Ness, a
free-lance writer, and Anthony Brenna of the
National Enquirer, for time to file briefs on
reporters' privilege to protect sources under the
First Amendment and the California Shield Law.
The reporters were called to testify in the pre
liminary hearing of singer Cathy Evelyn Smith,
who faces murder charges in Belushi's 1982
death from a drug overdose.
The judge scheduled another hearing for June

6, but said he would convene court briefly Mon
day on another issue that came up while Van
Ness was in court yesterday.
The prosecution disclosed it has records
showing Van Ness sold a recording of an in
terview with Smith to NBC television for $500
and said portions of it were broadcast.
The judge said the tape recording Van Ness
refuses to testify about may be in the public
domain if it was sold. He ordered prosecutors to
bring an official of NBC to court Monday to tes
tify about the reported sale.
Meanwhile, the prosecution called Brenna,
senior West Coast reporter for the National En
quirer.
Brenna admitted he wrote the story in the En
quirer's June 29, 1982, edition headlined:
"Hollywood Drug Queen Confesses — 1 Killed
John Belushi."
The story, reputedly based on a tape-recorded
interview with Smith, led to the filing of murder
charges against her because she allegedly said she
injected the comedian with a mixture of cocaine
and heroin.
Brenna refused to discuss his newsgathering
efforts or contact he may have had with Smith.
Brenna's attorney, Gerson Zweifach, argued
without success that his client's testimony was not
necessary.
Stocks rise broadly
Stock prices rose broadly yesterday, adding to
Monday's slim gains, but finished below the highs
of the session as confusion continued about the
course of the economy and interest rates.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
.55 Monday, rose another 4.97 points to close at
1,252.76 as 21 of the blue-chip issues gained
ground. Earlier in the session, however, the stock
market's best-known indicator had been up
nearly 10 points.
