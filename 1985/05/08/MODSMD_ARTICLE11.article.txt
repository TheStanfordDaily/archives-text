Duke to pick games head
SACRAMENTO — Gov. George Deuk
mejian said yesterday he expects to name an ex
ecutive director for the long-delayed state lottery
"by the end of the week."
But the Republican governor gave no hint of
his pick to run the games he opposed in last
year's lottery initiative, and he again defended
the long delays in starting the games.
The voter-approved constitutional amendment
creating the lottery last November directed the
governor to appoint a lottery director by early
December and to start selling lottery tickets to
the public before the end of March.
Deukmejian is now five months behind
schedule in picking a director, in part because his
first choice turned the job down at the last min
ute, and the target date for starting games is Sep
tember. six months past the deadline in the lot
tery initiative.
But in a Capitol news conference, Deukmejian
disputed questions from reporters which sugges
ted voters were critical of the delays in starting
the lottery.
"I have had hardly anybody ask me about the
lottery except reporters," Deukmejian said. He

added that tnere has been "hardly any comment
from the public" about the Oregon lottery, which
was approved by voters the same day as Califor
nia's lottery and started sales on time last month.
"I would expect to be able to make an an
nouncement on the executive director position
around the end of the week," Deukmejian said,
adding that without a permanent director yet the
lottery commission is "moving well now" to
adopt guidelines for lottery vendors and other
planning steps.
Diablo goes commercial
SAN LUIS OBISPO — Diablo Canyon's $5.6
billion nuclear plant began full commercial oper
ation yesterday, supplying electricity to Northern
and Central California after two decades of plan
ning and protest.
But the power struggle with anti-nuclear
groups continues, and paying for the plant prom
ises to cause static with consumers.
Last week, a federal appellate court agreed to
hear arguments that the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission disregarded earthquake safety ques
tions when it granted a full-power license last
August for the Unit 1 reactor. Diablo Canyon.

about midway between San Francisco and Los
Angeles, is located just a few miles from the of
fshore Hosgri earthquake fault.
The rehearing, which has yet to be scheduled,
didn't stop PG&E from going commercial, but
one of the main opponents of the plant, a group
called Mothers for Peace, is gearing up for that
battle.
"Today is a day of mixed emotions for us. We
are very unhappy it has reached commercial pro
duction,' group spokeswoman Nancy Cul
ver, who has taken part in protests against the
plant for the past 11 years — "since before I had
gray hair."
Through the years, thousands of demonstra
tors have been arrested at the plant's gates or on
surrounding hillsides.
Today's weather
It will be partly cloudy today, with highs hitting
the upper 50s and 60s. Clouds will increase as the
day progresses, leading to a chance of showers
tonight. Tonight's lows will be in the mid 40s to
low 50s. There will be a chance of showers to
morrow; highs will be in the upper 50s and 60s.
