## Holographic techniques produce three-dimensional images 
### NIKO SCHIFF Editorial staff 
The ability to view natural phenomena in three dimen
sions is progressing rapidly through the aid of holographic
imaging. Asst. Prof. Lambertus Hesselink of the
Aeronautics and Astronautics Department is working on
advanced optical techniques to generate three
dirtiensional images.
Most natural phenomena are three-dimensional and
time-dependent. Viewing these phenomena in 3-D
representations that can present data in "real" time pro
vides a much more accurate and useful experimental
model. "Real time is conceptualized as being continuous
and is usually characterized with the ability to display suc
cessive images rapidly, said Hesselink.
Work in this area has many applications, such as per
mitting robots to see 3-D qualities of objects, helping en
gineers to visualize experimental designs or allowing
measurements of fluid flow to be represented as 3-D
images.
Many of the difficulties encountered in developing
these techniques stem from the mechanics of the human
visual system, Hesselink explained. In the 3-D display of
data, the images created appear to be transparent, a result
of compiling data taken by cross-sectional slices. The ef
fect of seeing the objects as transparent confuses the
human mind, said Hesselink.
' Three-dimensional human perception is a complicated
process involving the eyes as sensors and the brain as a
processing unit, he explained. Three-dimensional vision is
roughly divided into three main processes.
"The first is the conversion of an image into a primal
sketch consisting of all boundaries and light and dark
transitions. The second process determines the likely
three-dimensional shape of the object, which is finalized
by inference in the third process: The likely shape is
compared with other familiar objects and by comparison a
final interpretation is made," explained Hesselink.
Optical illusions are a good example of the last step of
this process. Usually, they are images that do not admit to
easy matching for the brain so it chooses the most familiar
pattern, said Hesselink. An example is the famous duck
rabbit drawing used in Gestalt psychology. If looked at
from one perspective, the picture illustrates a duck; if
viewed differently it appears as a rabbit.
Another example of familiar-pattern recognition by the
brain is that by sketching only a few lines of a face, we
provide the brain with enough information to find the
retained pattern, said Hesselink.
The visual system responds to edges, and this is the
cause of most of the confusion with the transparent

images produced, he explained. "Ultimately, we would
want to make the surface semi-transparent. This could be
accomplished by super-imposing a dot pattern along the
surface of the imaged structure to orient the human obser
ver," Hesselink said.
Although the optimization of these techniques is
restricted by human limitations, there may be many appli
cations where the ultimate observer may be a machine
and these considerations could unduly compromise the
performance, said Hesselink.
Such limitations are apparent in the visualization of
grey scale images, images with variations of black and
white shading. Sensors on the human retina can detect
only 50 grey levels while the retina's sensitivity to color

Doris Mitsch/Daily
variation is greater, Hesselink explained.
Grey scale images give depth cues when viewing an ob
ject and are very important for 3-D imaging.
There are a number of methods Hesselink is using to
create the 3-D images."Holographic displays use either
planar or volume diffraction gratings, holograms, which
contain all the information about the object. The object is
displayed by illuminating the hologram and looking at the
diffracted light," said Hesselink.
Currently, Hesselink has been developing a holographic
technique using optical crystals called photorefractives,
small crystals that resemble mosaic tiles. The crystals are
unique in that they can be programmed in milliseconds,
providing "real" time capabilities, as well as easily stored

and erased.
The holograms can be written into the crystal. This is
done in total darkness with a set of laser beams. Two
coherent beams that create changes in the crystals are
used. Coherent beams are light beams of the same
wavelength that usually have the same phase as well.
In this procedure, one of the waves carries the encoded
information about the object, collected by different meth
ods and stored in the intensity and phase of the wave. This
wave is the object wave, said Hesselink.
The other wave is a reference wave, a wave with the
same wavelength as the object wave but without any re
corded information. The phase of these two waves is dif
ferent. The mixing of the two waves creates an inter
ference pattern, said Hesselink.
The pattern creates a grating on the interior of the crys
tal, changing its index of refraction. This information can
be read from the crystal by focusing on it another beam of
light identical to the reference wave.
The interference pattern stores intensity and phase and
from this information the 3-D conformation of the object
can be reconstructed, explained Hesselink.
The inscribing and read-out time together are
measurable in milliseconds, said Hesselink. This quick en
coding and decoding allows for real-time capabilities, but
much is still required.
The crystals can be tored for up to a month, and
erasure in certain crystals requires only flooding them
with light. Other crystals are temperature dependent, said
Hesselink.
The data for these experiments is numerical and is col
lected by many different methods. Fluid flow data, for ex
ample, is collected in large computers and is translated
into an object wave for visualization, said Hesselink.
These techniques can also be used to display synthetic
objects, objects that can be created through programming
a series of numbers into a computer with the object then
appearing on the computer screen. "Any technique that
can produce a numerical data base can be used,"said Hes
selink. Multi-variable output from calculations can also
achieve three-dimensional representations using this tech
nique.
There are also many applications for industry and medi
cal science. The cross-sectional data obtained from the
CAT (computerized axial tomography) scan could be
translated into a holographic image, said Hesselink.
Other applications include representations of designs
for rear axles or aircraft wings. Based on computed data
for these structures, a hologram could be constructed to
show engineers how the structures would look before they
were actually manufactured, said Hesselink.

easy matching for the brain so it chooses the most familiar
pattern, said Hesselink. An example is the famous duck
rabbit drawing used in Gestalt psychology. If looked at
from one perspective, the picture illustrates a duck; if
viewed differently it appears as a rabbit.
Another example of familiar-pattern recognition by the
brain is that by sketching only a few lines of a face, we
provide the brain with enough information to find the
retained pattern, said Hesselink.
The visual system responds to edges, and this is the
cause of most of the confusion with the transparent

images produced, he explained. "Ultimately, we would
want to make the surface semi-transparent. This could be
accomplished by super-imposing a dot pattern along the
surface of the imaged structure to orient the human obser
ver," Hesselink said.
Although the optimization of these techniques is
restricted by human limitations, there may be many appli
cations where the ultimate observer may be a machine
and these considerations could unduly compromise the
performance, said Hesselink.
Such limitations are apparent in the visualization of
grey scale images, images with variations of black and
white shading. Sensors on the human retina can detect
only 50 grey levels while the retina's sensitivity to color

variation is greater, Hesselink explained.
Grey scale images give depth cues when viewing an ob
ject and are very important for 3-D imaging.
There are a number of methods Hesselink is using to
create the 3-D images."Holographic displays use either
planar or volume diffraction gratings, holograms, which
contain all the information about the object. The object is
displayed by illuminating the hologram and looking at the
diffracted light," said Hesselink.
Currently, Hesselink has been developing a holographic
technique using optical crystals called photorefractives,
small crystals that resemble mosaic tiles. The crystals are
unique in that they can be programmed in milliseconds,
providing "real" time capabilities, as well as easily stored

and erased.
The holograms can be written into the crystal. This is
done in total darkness with a set of laser beams. Two
coherent beams that create changes in the crystals are
used. Coherent beams are light beams of the same
wavelength that usually have the same phase as well.
In this procedure, one of the waves carries the encoded
information about the object, collected by different meth
ods and stored in the intensity and phase of the wave. This
wave is the object wave, said Hesselink.
The other wave is a reference wave, a wave with the
same wavelength as the object wave but without any re
corded information. The phase of these two waves is dif
ferent. The mixing of the two waves creates an inter
ference pattern, said Hesselink.
The pattern creates a grating on the interior of the crys
tal, changing its index of refraction. This information can
be read from the crystal by focusing on it another beam of
light identical to the reference wave.
The interference pattern stores intensity and phase and
from this information the 3-D conformation of the object
can be reconstructed, explained Hesselink.
The inscribing and read-out time together are
measurable in milliseconds, said Hesselink. This quick en
coding and decoding allows for real-time capabilities, but
much is still required.
The crystals can be tored for up to a month, and
erasure in certain crystals requires only flooding them
with light. Other crystals are temperature dependent, said
Hesselink.
The data for these experiments is numerical and is col
lected by many different methods. Fluid flow data, for ex
ample, is collected in large computers and is translated
into an object wave for visualization, said Hesselink.
These techniques can also be used to display synthetic
objects, objects that can be created through programming
a series of numbers into a computer with the object then
appearing on the computer screen. "Any technique that
can produce a numerical data base can be used,"said Hes
selink. Multi-variable output from calculations can also
achieve three-dimensional representations using this tech
nique.
There are also many applications for industry and medi
cal science. The cross-sectional data obtained from the
CAT (computerized axial tomography) scan could be
translated into a holographic image, said Hesselink.
Other applications include representations of designs
for rear axles or aircraft wings. Based on computed data
for these structures, a hologram could be constructed to
show engineers how the structures would look before they
were actually manufactured, said Hesselink.

The ability to view natural phenomena in three dimen
sions is progressing rapidly through the aid of holographic
imaging. Asst. Prof. Lambertus Hesselink of the
Aeronautics and Astronautics Department is working on
advanced optical techniques to generate three
dirtiensional images.
Most natural phenomena are three-dimensional and
time-dependent. Viewing these phenomena in 3-D
representations that can present data in "real" time pro
vides a much more accurate and useful experimental
model. "Real time is conceptualized as being continuous
and is usually characterized with the ability to display suc
cessive images rapidly, said Hesselink.
Work in this area has many applications, such as per
mitting robots to see 3-D qualities of objects, helping en
gineers to visualize experimental designs or allowing
measurements of fluid flow to be represented as 3-D
images.
Many of the difficulties encountered in developing
these techniques stem from the mechanics of the human
visual system, Hesselink explained. In the 3-D display of
data, the images created appear to be transparent, a result
of compiling data taken by cross-sectional slices. The ef
fect of seeing the objects as transparent confuses the
human mind, said Hesselink.
' Three-dimensional human perception is a complicated
process involving the eyes as sensors and the brain as a
processing unit, he explained. Three-dimensional vision is
roughly divided into three main processes.
"The first is the conversion of an image into a primal
sketch consisting of all boundaries and light and dark
transitions. The second process determines the likely
three-dimensional shape of the object, which is finalized
by inference in the third process: The likely shape is
compared with other familiar objects and by comparison a
final interpretation is made," explained Hesselink.
Optical illusions are a good example of the last step of
this process. Usually, they are images that do not admit to
easy matching for the brain so it chooses the most familiar
pattern, said Hesselink. An example is the famous duck
rabbit drawing used in Gestalt psychology. If looked at
