## THE 						STANFORD DAILY Trustees must act now 
### 
The facts that emerged from yesterday's forum
on total divestment of Stanford's holdings in
South Africa speak for themselves. Students Out
of South Africa raised key questions, then sought
to answer them. The trustees sidestepped those
same questions, opting instead to tout the Uni
versity's eight-year-old policy of "selective
divestment," but never countering charges that
the policy — under which the University has
never divested from any company that does busi
ness in South Africa — is grossly inadequate.
Last week, when representatives from both
groups met to consider the merits of total divest
ment, the trustees pledged to enter yesterday's
forum with open minds. But University President
Donald Kennedy, who said yesterday he had
already presented his case in Monday's Daily, left
the impression that his mind was already made
up.
Trustee James Gaither, an attorney who served
in the administration of President Johnson, might
have discussed the legal and economic effects of
total divestment. Instead, he said the trustees
"have responsibilities" that prevent them from
behaving "as individuals." By then stressing that
the board's investment policy seeks "to nourish
this institution," he implied that profit maximiza
tion — not investment responsibility — guides
current University policy.
Trustee W. James Ware, who discussed his

own youth in segregated Alabama and his mem
bership on the Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility (C-IR), might have shed light on the
University's mechanism for implementing
selective divestment. Instead, Ware touted Stan
ford's current approach in general and the C-IR
in particular.
The trustees never made a strong case for their
policy of "selective divestment." How can an in
stitution have a policy of selective divestment
when it never divests and even abstains on share
holder resolutions that would urge companies to
follow the Sullivan Principles? If Kennedy and
the trustees truly believe that selective divest
ment is the best way to approach the South
Africa issue, why doesn't Stanford have a real
policy of selective divestment?
Stanford's so-called "selective divestment"
policy has been no policy at all, but rather a de
facto approval of any investments in South
Africa, regardless of company actions. The trus
tees must make a decision at their meeting Tues
day — and not delay by creating yet another in
vestigative committee — that the time has come
to change the University's investment policy.
We've already seen the effects of eight years of
"selective divestment." We don't need another
committee. We need action. We need total
divestment.
