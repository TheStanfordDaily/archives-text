# Historian's research reveals KAL questions
## 
### 
in his own scholarly, cautious way, Alexander Dallin
has dropped the equivalent of the Bikini H-bomb on the
political landscape.
Dallin is a professor in the History Department here;
he's written a book called "Black Box: KAL 007 and the
Superpowers." In it, Dallin lends his considerable author
ity as a historian to a set of very disturbing conclusions.
The book does not claim to know why Korean Air
Lines Flight 007 happened to be in Soviet airspace on
Sept. 1, 1983, when it was shot down by Soviet intercep
tors; it aims at "narrowing the range of possibly sound and
tenable explanations." Dallin concludes that the incursion
was probably either:
1. a fuel-saving shortcut;
2. pilot error; or
3. a deliberate violation of the Soviet borders so that
the Soviet air defenses could be examined by American
intelligence.
The first hypothesis is so shaky that I'm surprised it was
included; the savings involved would have been less than
$2,500. If KAL needed that kind of money, it could have
raised the price of drinks and served saltier peanuts.
The second one holds up a bit longer. Elaborate
scenarios can be constructed to explain how a series of er
rors could have led KAL 007 along the course it took —
improbable, but the improbable does happen.
The hardware involved is too complex to get into; it's
discussed at length in the April 25 issue of The New York
Review of Books by Murray Sayles, who argues for pilot
error.
But rather than quibbling over the niceties of jumbo jet
navigation, one should consider the fact that three
minutes before the plane was shot down, it was talking to
Tokyo, claiming to be almost 400 miles from where it ac

tually was, with nothing out of the ordinary.
For the crew members to have been telling the truth,
they would have had to fail to notice that they were over
land, twice, which their radar would have told them; it
would also require them to be somehow oblivious to the
Soviet MiGs that were tailing them. Tapes supplied by the
U.S. government show that the MiGs attempted to make
visual contact, hailed them on emergency frequencies and

finally fired tracer bullets at KAL 007, all with no
response. One eventually has to admit that the crew mem
bers either knew where they were, or they were comatose.
Dallin, in the end, edges uncomfortably toward the spy
mission theory: "With the passage of time, this argument,
unlike all others, looms stronger than before."
(For a somewhat more vigorous arguing of the spy case,
see "KAL 007: What the U.S. Knew And When We
Knew It," by David Pearson, in The Nation of August 18-
25, 1984.)
But does it make sense? What's to be gained by sending
a civilian airliner over the Soviet Union? Quite a lot, actu

ally. KAL 007's triggering of Soviet air defenses, inten
tional or not, was a bonanza for U.S. intelligence. And vi
olations have happened too often to be accidental — at
least 27 American aircraft have been shot down while on
air reconnaisance missions since 1950.
Most telling of all is the fact that another KAL plane
was involved in another violation of Soviet borders in
1978 — having flown nearly 1,000 miles off course over
the strategic Kola Peninsula, it ignored warnings to land

Our government has done
many things as bad and
worse, and usually lies
about them.

and had to be forced down with a cost of two lives. This,
too, was supposed to be a "navigational error."
My main criticism of Dallin's book is that he pulls many
of his punches. He presents the evidence, but leaves the
most important conclusions to be drawn by the reader. If
Dallin takes his findings seriously, then it's most probable
that the story the Soviets told was substantially true, and
that our government's position was a gross distortion.
If the plane was on a spy mission, Reagan almost cer
tainly knew of it before hand. Then, after 269 deaths, he
had the monstrous hypocrisy to exploit the tragedy for
propaganda purposes: "It was an act of barbarism, born of
a society which wantonly disregards individual rights and
the value of human life and seeks constantly to expand

and dominate other nations." He went on to make a pitch l
for the MX missile. Presumably all jumbo jets are to be!
equipped with an MX to use in case of attack.
Which is more barbaric: To shoot down a (probably uni-»
dentified) aircraft that is violating sensitive borders and!
ignoring warnings, or deliberately to send over a plane full)
of passengers, to be used as, in effect, hostages for
espionage mission?
In the end, the main argument against KAL 007 having
intruded for intelligence purposes is that offered by the
editor of the San Jose Mercury News: "Our government,
for all its countless failings, could not do such a terrible
thing as that
The sad fact is, our government has done many things
as bad and worse, and usually lies about them. (The Bay
of Pigs, the Vietnam War, and the Contras leap to mind.)
What is unique about this incident is not the atrociousness
of the act but the stature of the researcher who is exposing
it.
The outrage over the Bitburg visit, the vote in Congress
against Contra aid and especially the deteriorating quality
of the economy, all point to Reagan's popularity having
reached its highwater mark. "The teflon is off' is a com
ment that's often made. Perhaps Dallin's book will serve
as one more piece of evidence that Reagan's blunders and
outrages are not isolated incidents, but part of a consistent
pattern.
The citizens of this country owe it to themselves to read
Dallin's book in order to understand a little better what
this government is about. And Congress owes us a full in
vestigation of the unanswered questions surrounding
KAL 007. It may turn out to be Reagan's Watergate.

U.S. government show that the MiGs attempted to make

in his own scholarly, cautious way, Alexander Dallin
has dropped the equivalent of the Bikini H-bomb on the
political landscape.
Dallin is a professor in the History Department here;
he's written a book called "Black Box: KAL 007 and the
Superpowers." In it, Dallin lends his considerable author
ity as a historian to a set of very disturbing conclusions.
The book does not claim to know why Korean Air
Lines Flight 007 happened to be in Soviet airspace on
Sept. 1, 1983, when it was shot down by Soviet intercep
tors; it aims at "narrowing the range of possibly sound and
tenable explanations." Dallin concludes that the incursion
was probably either:
1. a fuel-saving shortcut;
2. pilot error; or
3. a deliberate violation of the Soviet borders so that
the Soviet air defenses could be examined by American
intelligence.
The first hypothesis is so shaky that I'm surprised it was
included; the savings involved would have been less than
$2,500. If KAL needed that kind of money, it could have
raised the price of drinks and served saltier peanuts.
The second one holds up a bit longer. Elaborate
scenarios can be constructed to explain how a series of er
rors could have led KAL 007 along the course it took —
improbable, but the improbable does happen.
The hardware involved is too complex to get into; it's
discussed at length in the April 25 issue of The New York
Review of Books by Murray Sayles, who argues for pilot
error.
But rather than quibbling over the niceties of jumbo jet
navigation, one should consider the fact that three
minutes before the plane was shot down, it was talking to
Tokyo, claiming to be almost 400 miles from where it ac

tually was, with nothing out of the ordinary.
For the crew members to have been telling the truth,
they would have had to fail to notice that they were over
land, twice, which their radar would have told them; it
would also require them to be somehow oblivious to the
Soviet MiGs that were tailing them. Tapes supplied by the
U.S. government show that the MiGs attempted to make
visual contact, hailed them on emergency frequencies and

finally fired tracer bullets at KAL 007, all with no
response. One eventually has to admit that the crew mem
bers either knew where they were, or they were comatose.
