## Pi Phi probation 
### 
Your editorial, "Ask first, shoot
later" (May 2), shows little under
standing of the way Pi Beta Phi was
placed on probation. I fully agree
that "due process" is essential in the
University's dealings with student
groups, as well as individuals.
However, I am disturbed by the
editorial's distinct implication that
the Pi Phis were given something less
than due process.
First, the probation was imposed
only after a thorough preliminary
investigation. When Residential
Education officials heard allegations
of misbehavior, their first action was
to ask me to investigate the charges.
I contacted several people who were

present at the bid party, and the
allegations of hazing were confirmed
by reliable eyewitnesses. I also con
sulted with Pi Phi actives, including
six officers, days before any restric
tions were imposed. This careful
investigation gave me strong reason
to believe that violations of Univer
sity guidelines had occurred.
Because groups of students (and
not administrators) should bear
primary responsibility for governing
student activities, the Intersorority
Council (ISC) is now conducting an
investigation which will produce final
determinations of fact and recom
mendations for further action.
Unfortunately, student judicial
deliberations can be quite lengthy,
especially when students are so new

at the game (this is the first judicial
function ever performed by the ISC).
The Interfraternity Council's investi
gation of a similar violation last
quarter (the Phi Delt hazing inci
dent) lasted five weeks. Stanford
cannot afford to wait this long before
acting on hazing charges.
California strictly prohibits hazing
activities, and any university which
"knowingly permits" student hazing
is subject to loss of state funds. Stan
ford has chosen to steer clear of
these strictures by acting quickly on
allegations of hazing — first to inves
tigate the merits of the charges and
then (if the charges appear well
founded) to impose restrictions on
the group involved, ensuring that
illegal activities do not recur. Under

these circumstances, social probation
(pending a final resolution of the
issue) is a reasonable response.
After the events of last quarter,
Stanford student groups are well
aware that the University will take
swift and severe action (including
probation) when it has probable
cause to believe that hazing has
occurred. "Probable cause," in this
context, does not mean mere unsub
stantiated allegations. It means a
reasonable knowledge of the facts,
based on fair and balanced investiga
tion. This accords with legal and
social notions of due process.
While criminal suspects may not
be convicted until proven guilty, they
may be arrested and held for
probable cause. Probation is in-

tended as an analogous precaution
ary measure — one which must not
be taken swiftly, but will only be
taken fairly.
I do agree with The Daily that
students ought to be more involved
in the judicial process. The Inter
fraternity and Intersorority Councils
are examining the hazing issue, and
have begun to develop effective
means for investigation and
response. Hopefully these groups
will soon be able 10 act in place of
Res Ed, taking swift action against
hazing whenever necessary. We
should support and encourage their
efforts.
