## Group refutes vandalism charges 
### 
The Daily has now printed three articles con
cerning the vandalism of two signs advertising Is
raeli Independence Day celebrations. The first two
articles contained statements by Michael Bunzel, of
the Israeli Action Committee, that effectively
accused the Stanford Committee for Justice in the

VIEWPOINT

Middle East (COJME) of having committed the
vandalism. Bunzel was quoted as saying: "If there
is one group who would do it, it would be them. . . .
Many of them are Palestinians."
Members of COJME immediately responded
with a letter to The Daily protesting the totally un
founded charge and, especially, the slander against
an entire group of Stanford students. Our letter
described COJME's aim as achieving a Middle East
peace settlement that would guarantee the security
and national independence of both Israelis and
Palestinians. Both peoples are, in fact, represented
in COJME's membership, along with others from a
variety of national and religious backgrounds.
Our letter, which denounced the vandalism, was
never printed. Instead, on May 3, The Daily pub
lished an editorial that once again implicitly
accused COJME of vandalism. The editorial stated,
"It is a sad state of affairs when Stanford commu
nity residents resort to vandalism and violence to
propagate their political beliefs. . . . Stanford rep
resentatives of the various Middle East factions
need not mindlessly duplicate the violence and hos
tility that currently characterize that chaotic
region."
According to the editorial, students who were
angered by the spray painting of their sign

proceeded to tear down a Palestinian flag that had
been placed next to the sign. They were
photographed by a Daily reporter â€” in the act, in
cidentally, of violating the Fundamental Standard.
Shortly afterward, someone told The Daily that
pro-Israeli students would be subject to reprisals if
the photographs were published.
The Daily editors apparently accepted this claim
at face value, without substantiating it, and again
participated in the libel of a group of Stanford stu
dents. Despite its air of self-righteous detachment,
the editorial itself is biased. It accepts the Israeli
Action Committee's allegations concerning there-

Smears and innuendo must not become a substitute
for reasoned discussion.

sponsibility of COJME for defacing the signs, and
the word of an anonymous caller that those who
tore down the Palestinian flag would be in danger if
their photographs were published.
What evidence does The Daily have to state that
the "fear, confusion and violence of the Middle
East have penetrated the Stanford community?"
Whoever called The Daily had an interest in paint
ing such a picture, however, to prevent The Daily
from publishing the photographs in its possession
and to tarnish the image of those criticial of Israel's
policies.
The Daily editorial, and the accusations that
preceded it, are the results of stereotyping, a
process that invariably associates Palestinians with

terrorism and violence. Such stereotyping has been
consistently used to justify exclusion of the Pales
tinians from the negotiating process and, indeed,
from any consideration as human beings with a just
claim to national identify. It seems to us no coinci
dence that those who support Palestinian rights at
Stanford are now being falsely accused of van
dalism and of threatening violence.
By publishing Bunzel's accusations against
COJME and by insinuating in its editorial that Pal
estinian students might resort to violence. The
Daily has cast a cloud over a group that has, in its
three years of existence, used only education and

discussion to advance its cause. Unfortunately, a
spokesman for the Israel Action Committee, with
an assist from the editors, has chosen to discredit us
with totally unwarranted accusations.
We are dismayed that The Daily has played a
role in promoting this tactic, one that has no place
in a university. Smears and innuendo must not
become a substitute for reasoned discussion and
debate; therefore, we ask for a retraction and an
apology from Michael Bunzel and the editor of The
Daily.
