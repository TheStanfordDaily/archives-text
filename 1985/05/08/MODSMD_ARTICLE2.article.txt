# 1,000 attend Quad forum with trustees

### BARBARA SCHULER Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy and 12 other
members of the Board of Trustees faced strong pressure
from advocates of divestment in a public forum yesterday.
The panel — comprising six SOSA representatives,
three trustees and Kennedy — assembled on a platform in
front of Memorial Church and spoke to an audience of
about 1,000 students and faculty.
Leading off the debate, members of the Stanford Out of
South Africa (SOSA) coalition argued that "total divest
ment is both fiscally responsible and morally imperative."
Kennedy focused his comments on the question of the
efficacy of total divestment as a means for achieving the
goal of improving conditions for blacks in South Africa.
Referring listeners to his open letter in Monday's Daily, he
reiterated his contention that divestment is not the best
method of effecting change.
"There is no universality of agreement, nor is there a
case that convinces me that prompt withdrawal (of foreign
companies) would be in the best interest of black South
Africans," he said.
SOSA member Alice Stauffer disagreed. "Why, if
divestment is so ineffective, has the South African govern
ment spent $17 million last year to defeat divestiture
votes in the U.S. alone?" she asked.
Kennedy and the trustees repeatedly voiced support for
demonstrators' concerns, asserting fundamental agree
ment with the protesters' view that apartheid is inconsis
tent with University ideals.
"Our values are not different. We're talking today and
will be talking in the future about means," said Trustee

James Gaither, a San Francisco attorney and formerly a
staff assistant in the Johnson administration.
Stauffer lodged complaints against the University's
policy of selective divestment, questioning Stanford's
commitment to a socially responsible investment policy.
"The students of Stanford are tired of hearing that we
have a process that works. No divestment is not proof of a
process that works or even takes seriously a commitment
to selective divestment," Stauffer said.
Kennedy and the trustees defended the current divest
ment policy and the record of the Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility (C-IR), which has also come under
fire by proponents of divestment as being "totally
reactive" and "procedurally inefficient."
SOSA invited Theodore Brown, president of the In
stitute for Corporate Research and Education, to address
the financial ramifications of divestment. Brown cited a
study he recently conducted in which a South Africa-free
portfolio outperformed an unconstrained one by 4.7 per
cent over a five-year period.
"It is simply not prudent to invest large sums of money
in such [an unstable] situation," he added, citing escalat
ing violence in South Africa. "The risk of losing one's in
vestment increases each day."
But Gaither said the trustees cannot "take our assets
and devote them to causes we believe in. . . . They were
given to us to nourish this institution . . . and it is our obli
gation to preserve, protect and seek the best return on the
assets we have."
SOSA speakers repeatedly returned to the theme of

self-determination and the necessity of letting black South
Africans decide what role U.S. corporations and institu
tions should play.
"If you want to help the African people, listen to what
they say. By being there, you have empowered apartheid
•.. by building its military, technological and industrial
base," said SOSA member Charles N'Cho.
SOSA members cited the major liberation organiza
tions in South Africa — the African National Congress,
the Pan-Africanist Congress and the United Democratic
Front — as strong advocates of divestment. "Why do we
have this disrespect for African opinion?" N'Cho asked.
Although Kennedy said that the trustees "are not

in concrete on this issue," he said it was unlikely that full
divestment would come up for a vote at the May 13-14
trustee meeting.
"Although we got the matter on the agenda for the in
vestments committee (and as a point of discussion for the
full board), I have never seen the board take immediate
action on an issue this complex at a single meeting," Ken
nedy said. "The chances that there will be a decision to
change that policy (selective divestment) are very, very
small."
In a speech that brought the crowd to its feet three
times, N'Cho said he could not understand the logic of arg
uments that U.S. companies should stay in South Africa to
promote free trade unions "so black workers can strike
these companies."
If we support that "convoluted sophism," he said,
"why don't we set up a strike fund ... so that students
can boycott classes to pet the trustees to divest?"
