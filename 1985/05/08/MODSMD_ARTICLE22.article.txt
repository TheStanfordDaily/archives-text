Rheology, a field that deals with
the phenomena of complex fluids, is
not a widely known subject. At the
forefront of this extension of the sci
ence of fluid mechanics is Asst.
Chemical Engineering Prof. Gerald
Fuller, who is also a resident fellow at
Rinconada.
Fuller was recently recognized as a
Young Investigator by the National
Science Foundation for his work in
the development of optical tech
niques to observe these phenomena.
Rheology is the study of the fluid
flow of complex liquids, said Fuller.
These fluids are unique because they
are anomalous liquids that do not fol
low Newton's law of viscosity,
meaning that they behave very unex
pectedly, he explained.
Fuller demonstrated a number of
the peculiar properties of these fluids,
usually polymeric fluids or suspension
solutions. The fluids contain a lot of
materials that alter the fluids' proper
ties when a flow is applied to them.

Polymer, a large complex molecule
that changes shape when a flow is ap
plied to the liquid, and proteins are
examples of such materials.
In one demonstration. Fuller took
a small beaker containing glycerine
with a 5 percent concentration of a
high-molecular-weight polymer
called polyacrylamide. The
polyacrylamide is a flexible polymer
chain and even at that low concentra
tion can alter the fluid flow signifi
cantly, said Fuller.
A rod attached to a motor was
placed in the center of the beaker. A
fluid obeying Newtonian mechanics
would spread out and up the side of
the beaker owing to the centrifugal
force created by the spinning rod.
This complex fluid, however, traveled
up the rod.
These fluids seem to have trouble
deciding whether they are elastic
solids or liquids, Fuller explained.
Fuller drew the polyacrylamide
containing fluid out of a syringe that
