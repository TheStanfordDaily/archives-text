Rheology, a field that deals with
the phenomena of complex fluids, is
not a widely known subject. At the
forefront of this extension of the sci
ence of fluid mechanics is Asst.
Chemical Engineering Prof. Gerald
Fuller, who is also a resident fellow at
Rinconada.
Fuller was recently recognized as a
Young Investigator by the National
Science Foundation for his work in
the development of optical tech
niques to observe these phenomena.
Rheology is the study of the fluid
flow of complex liquids, said Fuller.
These fluids are unique because they
are anomalous liquids that do not fol
low Newton's law of viscosity,
meaning that they behave very unex
pectedly, he explained.
Fuller demonstrated a number of
the peculiar properties of these fluids,
usually polymeric fluids or suspension
solutions. The fluids contain a lot of
materials that alter the fluids' proper
ties when a flow is applied to them.

Polymer, a large complex molecule
that changes shape when a flow is ap
plied to the liquid, and proteins are
examples of such materials.
In one demonstration. Fuller took
a small beaker containing glycerine
with a 5 percent concentration of a
high-molecular-weight polymer
called polyacrylamide. The
polyacrylamide is a flexible polymer
chain and even at that low concentra
tion can alter the fluid flow signifi
cantly, said Fuller.
A rod attached to a motor was
placed in the center of the beaker. A
fluid obeying Newtonian mechanics
would spread out and up the side of
the beaker owing to the centrifugal
force created by the spinning rod.
This complex fluid, however, traveled
up the rod.
These fluids seem to have trouble
deciding whether they are elastic
solids or liquids, Fuller explained.
Fuller drew the polyacrylamide
containing fluid out of a syringe that

was able to continue to draw fluid out
of the beaker when the tip of the
syringe was well above the top of the
beaker. This phenomenon, known as
the tubeless siphon, characterizes
other complex liquids.
Another strange behavior was that
when the flow rate was increased by
applying pressure to the syringe, the
fluid bulged out rather than narrow
ing, as a conventional fluid would.
Water in a hose, for example, would
narrow its diameter when subjected
to increased pressure.
Fuller's work is the development of
powerful optical techniques for the
study of these phenomena. These
techniques have a number of advan
tages over the conventional mechani
cal methods of studying such liquids,
Fuller explained. His optical tech
niques respond more quickly and also
allow for the continous collection of
data.
To study fluid flow, some method
of applying shear force must be
employed, explained Fuller. Most
mechanical methods are based on

placing the liquid between two plates
and then pushing the top plate, shear
ing the liquid. The force necessary to
keep the bottom remaining stationary
is measured, explained Fuller. With
optical techniques, it is possible to
send light into the fluids and get an
instantaneous response.
With the use of light, the measure
ment can be localized, while mechan
ical methods only allow for an
averaging of data. To get a time
course of the fluid flow from mechan
ical measurements requires repeating
the experiments rather than collect
ing all the data from one single fluid
flow, said Fuller.
Using lasers, a single point in a
complex liquid mixture can be mea
sured. This is critical as these compli
cated liquids usually have many dif
ferent materials within them, ex
plained Fuller. For example, a fluid
might have rod-like structures as well
as spaghetti-like structures. The ori
entation of these separate structures
relative to one another can be crucial
in characterizing the properties of the
fluid, Fuller said.
Floppy discs of computers rely on
the positioning of iron oxide rods that
need to line up on the surface of the

disc. In the manufacture of a flippy
disc, a polymer is used to cover the
surface of the disq. The function of a
floppy disc depends on the orienta
tion of the iron oxide rods on the
surface of the polymer. The fluid flow
of the iron oxide rods needs to be an
ticipated in order to assure proper or
ientation, explained Fuller.
The techniques developed in Ful
ler's lab are the first optical tech
niques to view time-dependent
phenomena. It is very important to
look at fluid flow starting from a res
ting point and to observe how it
changes in time, said Fuller. The
evolution of the fluid's structure pro
vides insight into the complex nature
of the fluid.
Fuller's techniques have their
greatest impact on analyzing the tran
sient states of polymer fluid flow.
Previously, all information was ob
tained from the final equilibrium
state of the liquid after it had been
sheared and had come to a resting
point.
Using a technique called
polarimetry, Fuller was able to
describe the state of the liquid at
various times during flow. "By pass

ing a laser through the sample, its
state can be related," said Fuller.
The laser beam will detect proper
ties of the refractive index of the ma
terial, said Fuller. A stretched-out
polymer in a fluid flow may change
directions many times causing conse
quent changes in the refractive index,
he explained. These changes can be
as small as a one-in-one-billionth
change in the refractive index. The
laser can detect changes this small
and can measure them continuously.
This is all accomplished in one step,
explained Fuller. The changes are
measured by modulating the
polarization of the light passed
through the sample. The polarization
of the light is modulated at a high rate
by a device called a photoelastic
modulator.
The modulated light is sent through
the sample, and the intensity is mea
sured. The information about the ori
entation and movement of particles in
the solution is measured simultane
ously as a function of time, explained
Fuller. The information is contained
in mathematical functions called
Fourier components that can be
analyzed to retrieve all the informa

tion about individual particles and
polymers in the solution.
This technique has commerical ap
plications for most industries utilizing
complex fluids. Fuller has done con
sulting for Exxon and Bell Laborato
ries and has constructed identical
devices to the one in his lab for these
companies.
Optical techniques allow data to be
collected in many situations where
mechanical methods would be unable
to function under the conditions ne
cessary to produce some of the
polymers. Many of these complex
fluids are processed in extreme en
viroments, said Fuller. The non
invasive nature of these optical tech
niques is an important advantage as
many fluids are processed at high
temperatures and pressures.
The other important technique that
Fuller has developed involves small
angle light scattering that detects the
light scattering of suspended particles
subjected to transient shear forces,
said Fuller. This technique digitally
records the evolution of an intensity
pattern of the transient fluid flow, al
lowing for an examination of the ori
entation distribution of the particles

in time.
To illustrate this technique, hard
ened blood cells are processed so they
will not deform. These chemically
treated cells are placed in a solution
and sheared. Their rotation in the
fluid is picked up and the shape can
be elucidated, explained Fuller.
The rotation of the hardened blood
cells, that is, the orientation of the
particles in the fluid flow, have fixed
frequencies. Fuller explained.
The cells begin in a random pat
tern. The cells will eventually return
to this random configuration in the
course of the flow, but each cell first
must perform a full rotation, ex
plained Fuller.
A hardened blood cell disc or rod
will not rotate smoothly, explained
Fuller. It will quickly flip from one
stable conformation to another in the
flow of the fluid. Eventually, the cells
return to their original random posi
tions. When they line up in their sta
ble conformations, they are
diagonally oriented. This type of
property of complex fluids can be
studied using the small-angle light*
scattering technique, said Fuller. V
