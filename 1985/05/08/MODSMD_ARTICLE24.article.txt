## Card nine pounds St. Mary's 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
MORAGA — In a nightmare for
scorekeepers and those who like good
defensive baseball, Stanford posted
its 38th win of the season with a 14-7
triumph over St. Mary's College.
The game was a rematch of the
season opener, a 5-1 Stanford victory
at Sunken Diamond. However, yes
terday's contest, which featured 10
errors — six by the Cardinal — and
13 walks — nine by the Gaels —
looked more like a sloppy early
season game than the one in January.
Having clinched the Pacific 10
Southern Division title last weekend
at Arizona State, a Stanford letdown
sepmed a strong possibility against a
non-conference opponent. But it
didn't happen.
By the time the sixth batter of the
game stepped to the plate, the Card

inal already had a 5-0 lead. After
Pete Stanicek and Ruben Amaro
walked, Mark Davis hit a ground ball
that Gaels' third baseman Duane
Louis let through for an error.
Then, on a 1-0 pitch from starter
Kevin Roullier, Rick Lundblade
deposited his 22nd homer of the year
over the fence in left-center. When
the crowd had finished buzzing about
Lundblade's towering shot, Mike
Deßenon smacked a homer of his
own — a howling line drive to left.
Deßenon's blast signaled the end
of the day for Roullier, who left with
out retiring a batter.
Stanicek's RBI double down the
left-field line gave the Cardinal an 8-
1 lead in the third. It was one of four
hits on the day for Stanicek, who has
quietly raised his average to .365.
"I've been hitting well lately," he

said. "I felt good today. I was waiting
on the ball really well."
A seven-run deficit against the
newly crowned Six-Pac champions
would have been a good reason for
St. Mary's to fold, but the Gaels came
back and gave the Cardinal a tempo
rary scare.
After scoring a single run in the
third, St. Mary's pulled to within one
with five unearned runs in the fourth.
With the bases loaded and one out,
Eric Lakin blooped an RBI single to
left. Then things got weird.
John Verducci fielded Mark
Homen's grounder and threw to
Stanicek at second, who dug the ball
out, then dropped it for Stanford's
sixth error. The next batter, Chris
Gaeckle, hit a chopper that Verducci
charged — until he was flattened by
Lakin running to third.
The base umpire called inter
ference, and Stanford ran off the
field, thinking it had an inning-ending

double play. After a long discussion,
the umpires called only Lakin out,
awarding Gaeckle first base. The
Gaels took advantage of the opportu
nity, as Chris Costley drove a two-run
double to right-center and Rod
Roche stroked an RBI single to left.
Stanicek wasn't too worried about
the Cardinal's off day in the field.
"With our hitting, we got away with
it,"he said. "The defense is there.
Today was just one of those days."
Stanford was then able to restore
order, scoring three in the fifth and
single runs in the sixth, eighth and
ninth innings. After his fourth-inning
problems, Plemel faced the minimum
12 batters over the next four innings,
earning his fifth win without a loss.
After playing its last nine games on
the road, the Cardinal returns home
today for a 2:30 p.m. game with Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo. Jeff Ballard
(10-2, 3.78 ERA) will be the starter
for Stanford.

U I was seeing the ball well," said Pete Stanicek, who had four hits and
three RBIs yesterday.
