Jon Root, a middle blocker/outside
hitter, has received first-team honors
in the California Intercollegiate Vol
leyball Association's post-season
poll. Setter Craig Lauchner was
named to the second team, while
outside hitter Chris Braun gained
third-team honors.
Root, a preseason Ail-American,
was a valuable force in Stanford's 23-
10 overall record and its trip to the
NCAA Western Regionals. He was
second on the team in kills (280) and
led the team in digs (304), block solos
(38) and block assists (76). The 6-5,
200-pound junior has been a starter

since his freshman year.
Lauchner set the Cardinal offense
in motion. The 6-6, 212-pound senior
setter was second in the team in hit
ting percentage (.309). The Cardinal
coaching staff felt Lauchner was one
of the best blocking and hitting set
ters in the country.
Braun, a 6-6, 200-pound outside
hitter, was a dominant force in col
legiate volleyball this year. He led the
team in kills (297) and hitting
percentage (.322). He came to Stan
ford with virtually no previous volley
ball experience.
