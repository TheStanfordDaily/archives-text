## Scientist lowers Copernican view 
### DEBORAH KEHLE Staff writer 
Aesthetics, and not accuracy,
caused people to revise their view of
the universe, said noted astrophysicist
and historian Owen Gingerich in a
speech last night.
Gingerich addressed a crowd of 40
in the Physics Lecture Hall on "Crisis
Versus Aesthetic in the Copernican
Revolution" as part of the Bunyan
lecture series.
The series was established to
promote multidisciplinary examina
tion of the origin and evolution of the
universe and the philosophical impli
cations of discoveries in that field.
Gingerich debunked many of the
popular myths about the Copernican
revolution. Copernicus' "sun
centered" universe "hardly gave any
better results" in predicting the mo
tion of the planets than the previous

"earth-centered" model, said Gin
gerich.
The Copernican system also did
not get rid of Ptolemy's "crystal
spheres," as is generally believed, he
said. Ptolemy's system had a series of
spheres, rings and epicycles which ac
counted for the motion of the planets.
A series of rings within rings was
hypothesized to account for the
planets' apparent reversal of motion
as they orbit around the earth.
Actually, the motion is caused by
the Earth's overtaking the other
planets and passing them as it goes
around the sun.
Gingerich pointed out that many
people at the time did not consider
Copernicus' sun-centered system to
be a physical reality, but merely a
nice mathematical model.
