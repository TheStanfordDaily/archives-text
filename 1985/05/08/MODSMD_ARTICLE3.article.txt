# ASSU calls for divestment
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
After more than 40 minutes o*l
debate, the ASSU Senate last night
requested that the Board of Trustees
divest totally of its investments in
firms that do business in South Africa
and gave full support to Stanford Out
of South Africa (SOSA).
In other action, the senate disquali
fied last month's runoff election be
tween Slate of Mind and Mac Slate for
the presidency of the senior class. The
new election, which will cost $1,200,
will be held May 15 and will include
the votes of juniors studying abroad.
In the April runoff, Slate of Mind
defeated Mac Slate by a five-vote
margin, 150-145.

ASSU Senator John Boranian, co
author of the resolution requesting
total divestment, said University in
vestments in South Africa "lend
legitimation and moral approval to
the apartheid regime" controlling
that country.
Action on the resolution was
slowed when Graduate Senator Jim
McGrath proposed several amend
ments which called for a stronger
University investment policy but
stopped short of blanket divestment.
All the amendments were eventually
defeated.
Senator Jon Adelstein, co-author
of the divestment move, objected to
McGrath's proposals, stating that the
University "simply will not institute a

stronger divestment policy. I've given
up hope on it."
Debate over the need for a new
runoff centered around an April 24
advertisement in The Daily. The ad
vertisement incorrectly stated that
the election, which took place on
April 24, would continue on April 25.
In addition, Mac Slate filed an ob
jection stating that juniors overseas,
who were not given a chance to vote
in the initial runoff, could have an ef
fect on the outcome of the election.
Steve Smith, a member of Slate of
Mind, objected to the new runoff,
stating that "it would just create more
confusion" and "separate the senior
class more."
Also questioning the need for an

other election, Council of Presidents
r member Tod Kerr stated, "I just
wonder if the new election will be
more accurate than this one."
COP member David Porter, ar
guing against the runoff, said "both
slates had the same basic problems."
He added that the exclusion of the
votes of juniors overseas "is not a
good enough reason to cause prob
lems now."
McGrath, however, defended
Mac Slate's objections, stating that
there was "ample ground for a re
election" given the error in the ad
and the small vote margin that
separated the two slates.
Slate of Mind member Leslie Dar
win said she was "sorry that the
ASSU made the oversight not to in
clude the overseas campuses, but we
will abide by the rules... .We want to
represent all of the senior class. We
believe the Slate of Mind will triumph
for the third time," she said.
The senate also reprimanded
Senator Richard Beigel for his in
volvement in the distribution of
"Dump McGrath" posters during the
April elections.
"Because we found no serious
harm done, we just recommend the
penalty of reprimand," Frank Chen,
the hearing committee chair, told the
senate.
The meeting was plagued early on
by poor attendance by senators and,
35 minutes into the meeting, had to
recess for a half-hour after one
senator eliminated the quorum by
leaving the meeting.
"In my four years of being at the
senate, this has never happened,"
said Porter.
