# Mixed reactions on divestment
## Stanford's South Africans respond News 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
White South African students here agree that
their country's apartheid system must be changed,
but they hold different opinions on whether Stan
ford and other holders of stock in companies that
do business in South Africa should divest.
, The white South African students said they
believe the impetus for change must come from
within the country, not from foreign pressure.
However, some see a symbolic value in divest
ment.
"Stanford's divestment isn't going to do much in
South Africa," said freshman Cathy Stewart, a
South African citizen who participated in the sit-in
in front of University President Donald Kennedy's
office. "But it's symbolic and forces people to re
think the issue. I think the protest is a good thing,"
added the Johannesburg native.
A graduate student from Pretoria, South Africa,
who spoke on condition he not be iden
tified, said, "Divestment is a good idea. All the uni
versities in the country making a statement is a
good thing, but I don't think divestment itself is

going to make any difference in South Africa."
Those who oppose divestment believe that other
nations would move in to take the place of any U.S.
companies that pull out of South Africa, but they
also worry about the intent behind the call for
divestment.
"If American companies pull out, there are
French and German companies ready to move in,"
said a graduate student who also asked not to be
identified.
"But the idea of divestment is to start a revolu
tion. That bugs the hell out of me," he said.
"Everybody knows there has to be change, but a
bloody revolution is not going to work."
His wife, also a citizen of South Africa, said,
"The big solution in South Africa will be education,
but it's not going to happen overnight."
Both criticized the pro-divestment sit-in outside
Kennedy's office.
"It's not a nice idea" to promote violence, said
the graduate student.
His wife said that she thinks the protest "makes
the students feel good. They think, 'This is a good
thing to protest,' and if they didn't have this, they

would find something else to protest. They are
doing it to solve their own psychological prob
lems," she said.
Her husband went on to say that the situation in
South Africa is misrepresented by the media and
that the revolutionary movement is actually led by
a small radical fringe of the black population.
"I think many blacks are happy. The system of
gradual change works," he said, calling upon
evidence published in a South African government
newspaper which states that three-quarters of the
black population of the country support foreign
investment.
He said that the only group clearly in favor of
foreign divestment is the African National
Congress (ANC), which he described as a
communist-supported terrorist organization being
supplied through Zambia.
He said that Nelson Mandela, a leader of the
ANC now in prison in South Africa, had an arsenal
capable of killing one-quarter of a million people at
the time of his arrest in 1963.
