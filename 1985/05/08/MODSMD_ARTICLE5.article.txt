Gay people should exercise their
"citizen power" and move into the
public space as gay people, said poli
tical activist and computer consultant
David Russell at a speech in Branner
Hall yesterday.
David Goodstein, owner and pub
lisher of The Advocate, a national
gay publication, was originally sched
uled to speak. Because of illness,
however, he was unable to keep the
engagement. Goodstein and Russell
are co-authors of "The Citizens
Handbook."
"A citizen is someone who has the
privilege and duty to . . . take part in
controlling the community," Russell

said. "We (gay men) don't do that."
Power means the same thing as
freedom, Russell continued. "A citi
zen's power is the ability to speak in a
public forum on issues," he said.
For the gay man, this ability starts
in the family when he "comes out of
the closet and tells everyone about his
gayness," Russell said.
Once a man has come out to his
family, he is much more likely to par
ticipate actively in the gay commu
nity, providing support with his
money, time and energy, Russell said.
The openly gay man is also more
likely to support the gay community.
Russell said.

David Russell, co-author of "The Citizen's Handbook," urges gays to
use their rights as citizens during a speech at Rranner Hall yesterday.
Such men are relatively rare, and
the majority of them seem to come
from a lower-middle-class back
ground, Russell said. He decried the
current situation in which he says
wealthy gay men with economic
power remain in the closet and do not
publicly support the gay community.
A problem in the gay community is
that the people do not exercise their
citizen power, Russell said. "We have
been playing a clever game of smoke
and mirrors, creating the illusion of
political power," he said.
"Gay power, as we've known it
since Stonewall, is bankrupt," Russell
said. "We're a paper tiger."
The 1969 Stonewall riots are con
sidered to have launched the modern
gay liberation movement.
Political power has been developed
in a small group of activists and not in
the community, Russell said.
Therefore, the national gay organiza
tions do not have the grassroots back
ing they need to retain any real
power, he explained.
