Gay people should exercise their
"citizen power" and move into the
public space as gay people, said poli
tical activist and computer consultant
David Russell at a speech in Branner
Hall yesterday.
David Goodstein, owner and pub
lisher of The Advocate, a national
gay publication, was originally sched
uled to speak. Because of illness,
however, he was unable to keep the
engagement. Goodstein and Russell
are co-authors of "The Citizens
Handbook."
"A citizen is someone who has the
privilege and duty to . . . take part in
controlling the community," Russell

said. "We (gay men) don't do that."
Power means the same thing as
freedom, Russell continued. "A citi
zen's power is the ability to speak in a
public forum on issues," he said.
For the gay man, this ability starts
in the family when he "comes out of
the closet and tells everyone about his
gayness," Russell said.
Once a man has come out to his
family, he is much more likely to par
ticipate actively in the gay commu
nity, providing support with his
money, time and energy, Russell said.
The openly gay man is also more
likely to support the gay community.
Russell said.
