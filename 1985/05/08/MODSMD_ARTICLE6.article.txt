# V-E Day: cool Farm response

### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
While Stanford students may
approach today with some usual
degree of enthusiasm, most will
not feel the same excitement as
students here felt 40 years ago.
Forty years ago today, Western
nations celebrated victory in
Europe (V-E Day) during World
War 11. On May 7, 1945, German
officials signed Germany's official
surrender at Gen. Dwight Eisen
hower's headquarters in Reims,
France.
V-E Day represented "the van
quishing of Germany and the tri
umph of a fragile alliance," ac
cording to History Prof. Barton
Bernstein.
Part of the V-E Day issue is
whether the day should be re
garded as the liberation of Ger
many or the conquest of Germany,
Bernstein said.
Within war-time Germany,
there were "strong anti-Hitler
forces for whom the defeat of Ger
many represented a liberation,"
according to Bernstein.
"Fundamentally, what is at issue
is a historical question and a moral
question about the responsibilities
of peoples for the behavior of their
nations and their leaders,"
Bernstein said.

Here at Stanford on V-E Day,
11 a.m. classes were canceled, and
the hour was designated an hour
of thanks. The Daily appeared
with a banner headline, "JAPS
NEXT!" and, according to the
front page, "momentous words
literally bounced off the walls of
the Daily Shack (the former home
of The Daily) every minute."
While one writer reported "a
general excitement and phrases
such as unconditional surrender'
and 'total capitulation,' " another
reporter told of a lack of excite
ment.
"It was V-E Day, but it wasn't
what we expected," the reporter
wrote. "Students had flippantly
hoped for the announcement
before every midterm, and here it
was. But there was no sudden blast
of fire whistles, no noisy holiday
celebration."
At 11 a.m, the hour of thanks,
University President Donald
Tresidder spoke at a ceremony in
Memorial Church.
"We all feel joy today because
the first chapter in this war has
ended," Tresidder said. According
to a Daily report, Tresidder told
Stanford students how lucky they
were to be living in a country that
