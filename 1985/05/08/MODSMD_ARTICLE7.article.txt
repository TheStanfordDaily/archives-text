Beirut shellings hit 10-month high
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Christian and Moslem militiamen shelled each
other yesterday with tank cannon, mortars, artillery and rockets in the
heaviest barrages in the Lebanese capital in the last 10 months.
After 15 hours of intense bombardment that claimed at least 28 lives,
militia leaders and army officers declared an "immediate and compre
hensive cease-fire" in a city battered by a new round of sectarian
warfare.
The declaration did not halt gunfights along the city's Green Line
frontier between Beirut's Christian and Moslem sectors. It was the 29th
cease-fire announced in 10 days of fighting that seemed to push the
country near resumption of full-scale civil war.
Police report that since April 28 at least 68 people have been killed
and more than 340 wounded.
During the heaviest shelling, fires burned out of control and shell
smashed cars smoldered in the streets.
The Christian Voice of Lebanon radio reported at least 2,500 shells
and rockets hit east Beirut and its suburbs. Moslem broadcasts said
thousands of mortar rounds hit the west side.
The few people who stayed or were caught in buildings near the front
line huddled around radios in bomb shelters and basements. Some have
been there for three days.
"The last three days have really been terrible," said one man at a
building near one of the Green Line crossing points. "But the worst is
yet to come," he said, echoing fears that the latest cease-fire also will
collapse.
Burned-out cars, chunks of concrete and broken glass littered the
streets. After the cease-fire was declared a few groceries, bakeries and
pharmacies opened and some residents raced through near-deserted
streets to buy supplies. Lebanese President Amin Gemayel telephoned
President Hafez Assad of Syria, the state radio announced. It gave no
details.
Assad has been trying to mediate between Lebanon's Christians and
Moslems. Gemayel's government has failed to halt the fighting, and
Syria has been reported alarmed at the erosion of Gemayel's authority.
A so-called "security committee" of leaders of the main warring fac
tions and senior army officers declared the cease-fire after a meeting at
the committee's headquarters at the mid-city racetrack.
The committee members were only able to meet after they were
driven through the fighting in French truce observers' armored person
nel carriers.
Rescuers give up hunt for Marines
TOKYO — Rescuers yesterday gave up the search for 17 U.S.
Marines presumed killed when their helicopter crashed into the ocean
off Japan's southern coast, U.S. and Japanese officials said.
"An accompanying helicopter witnessed the impact and observed that
there were no survivors. . . . All aboard are missing and presumed
dead," read a statement issued by the Marine Corps Command on
Okinawa.
After 24 hours of searching by U.S. military and Japanese Maritime
Safety Agency boats and planes, the only items recovered were an un
opened 12-man life raft, two fuel tanks and some personal items, includ
ing a Navy bag with camera, film, candy, music tapes and prescription
drugs from the Okinawa Navy Hospital.
Lt. Col. John Toner, a U.S. Air Force spokesman based at Kadena in
Okinawa, said American military aircraft did not return to the site yes
terday and officials decided to call off the search completely after
"constant surveillance for a 24-hour period."
Lt. Col. Jerry Shelton, a Marine Corps spokesman at Kadena, said the
helicopter was one of two CH-53Ds, large craft that carry cargo and
troops, that had been on display near Hiroshima,
Marine Air Station "open house" on Children's Day, a Japanese na
tional holiday. ■»'"
The two helicopters were about three hours into the return flight to
the Marines' base at Okinawa — a distance of about 600 miles — when
one pilot reported mechanical problems and said he was turning back,
U.S. officers said.
They said the helicopter was about 15 miles from the small southern
Japanese island of Yakushima when it crashed. The crew of the second
helicopter dropped a life raft, marked the site with blue dye and waited
at the scene for rescue aircraft.
Toner said military authorities would still try to salvage the wreckage
to "ascertain the cause of the crash."
Mengistu shrugs off camp blame
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — Ethiopia's Marxist leader says local of
ficials ordered the mass eviction of more than 50,000 famine victims
from a feeding camp without permission from the central government, a
top U.N. official reported.
Mengistu Haile Mariam indicated that disciplinary action would be
taken against the officials, said Kurt Jansson, an assistant U.N.
secretary-general.
Jansson talked with Mengistu on Monday after combing northern
Ethiopia by air in a fruitless search for people forced from the Ibnet
camp last week.
Jansson, who continues his search by helicopter today, said Mengistu
"emphasized that the action was not authorized and that he did not
agree with it or approve it. He also stressed that such actions would not
be allowed to occur."
Mengistu's reported comments contradicted a government statement
issued Saturday which denied the drought victims were forcibly removed
from the Ibnet camp, about 250 miles north of Addis Ababa. It said
30,000 healthy volunteers departed for home on foot to plant crops after
recent rains, and others remained under care at the camp.
The operation, which took place April 28-30, has been strongly con
demned by Western donor governments, and the U.N. secretary
general, Javier Perez de Cuellar, asked Jansson to investigate.
'Arabian Nights' taken to court
CAIRO, Egypt — The Egyptian government has gone to court to
clean up the "Thousand and One Nights," arguing that racy passages in
the centuries-old Arabic classic are a threat to Egyptian youth.
The Interior Ministry has charged three booksellers with mis
demeanor violations of pornography laws for printing, importing and
distributing the unexpurgated version of the legendary tales told by
Scheherazade. It has seized 3,000 copies of the book, also known as
"Arabian Nights."
Although a decision by the court is not expected before May 19, the
case already has caused an uproar among scholars and intellectuals who
fear the government move was prompted by Islamic extremists.
"The Thousand and One Nights' as a literary document has the right
to exist unchanged because of its historic significance," retired magazine
editor Anis Mansour, a prominent Egyptian intellectual, told The Asso
ciated Press.
"My fear is that if we continue to confiscate obscene words from our
literature, it will not stop there," he said. "It will move to poetry, swim
ming suits, alcohol, and step by step it will lead us to become another
(Islamic) fundamentalist state."
The Moslem Brotherhood and other fundamentalist groups have been
pressuring President Hosni Mubarak's government to make Islam's
stern religious law the national law of this largely Moslem nation.
Interior Ministry officials say they have nothing against well-known
parts of the "Thousand and One Nights." such as the adventures of Sin
bad the Sailor, Ali Baba and characters like Aladdin, known to children
around the world.
But parts of the classic include graphic sexual references and such
stories as the adventures of three young women who seduce a poor
porter.
"The book is lucky it wasn't seized before," said Brig. Adly el-
Kosheiry, head of the Interior Ministry's delinquents department, who
initiated the case. "We are not asking for the execution of the 'Thousand
and One Nights.' We want to expurgate from it the dirty words, sen
tences and tales which have bad effects on the youth and push them
toward deviation and corruption."
