## Reagan, Spanish leaders meet 
### 
MADRID, Spain — President Reagan said yes
terday he has new support in Congress for helping
anti-government rebels in Nicaragua, but he
remained clearly at odds with Spain's socialist
leaders over Central America policy.
For the second day in a row, administration offi
cials, while not skirting the policy disputes with
Reagan's hosts, attempted to focus attention on the
president's scheduled appearance today in Stras
bourg, France, marking the 40th anniversary of the
end of the war in Europe.
Volunteering quotations from Reagan's
prepared text, National Security Adviser Robert
McFarlane said the president would accuse the So
viet Union of "moving toward development" of
mobile, multiwarhead missiles which could avoid
arms control detection and are "clearly designed to
strike first."
"In doing this, the Soviet Union is undermining
stability and the basis for mutual deterrence,"
Reagan will say, according to McFarlane.
He said the weapon Reagan would refer to was
the SSX-24, a medium-sized missile which the
United States previously has said will be deployed
on rail in 1987 or 1988.
Reagan, meanwhile, delivered a speech to
Spanish leaders hailing the results of his economic
policies and discussing at some length his intention
to unveil a plan to overhaul the income tax system
when he returns to the United States.

The president discussed U.S. policy toward
Nicaragua and the recently imposed U.S. trade em
bargo against that nation during a 40-minute
meeting with Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez.
In a briefing for reporters, Secretary of State
George Shultz made no secret of U.S.-Spanish dif
ferences over Nicaragua. "I didn't get any sense of
support for our economic sanctions," Shultz said.
He added there was "some difference in analysis"
over the U.S. view that Nicaragua "is definitely
moving itself in the Soviet and totalitarian direc
tion."
Gonzalez will meet in Madrid on Saturday with
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, who is re
turning home after a trip to Moscow. The meeting
gives Gonzalez an opportunity to demonstrate that
Spain is independent of the United States.
Shultz said the United States and Spain are
united, however, in the goal of democracy for
Central America.
In a speech at the Juan March Foundation,
Reagan said, "Freedom, we see, is contagious, and
the force of your example has inspired a continent.
When I first became president a little over four
years ago, the map of our hemisphere was
shadowed by dictatorships.
"Today, for the first time ever, the exceptions to
the democratic tide in Spanish-speaking America
can be counted on the fingers of one hand. They
number four. Two, Paraguay and Chile, have

entrenched military rule. The two others, Cuba and
Nicaragua, are communist tyrannies," he said.
Reagan and his staff were delighted by reports
from Washington quoting House Speaker Thomas
"Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.) as saying that members of
Congress were embarrassed by Ortega's trip to
Moscow immediately after the House vote to deny
aid to anti-government rebels.
O'Neill said sentiment may be shifting toward
resuming aid for the rebels.
"I think there are some people having second
thoughts and discovering they have been the vic
tims of a disinformation campaign, as perhaps
some of you present have been," Reagan told
reporters as he posed for pictures with King Juan
Carlos in the ornate gardens of El Pardo Palace,
the 63-room estate he is using as a guest house.
Shultz said Spain's desire to cut back on the
12,000 American troops in this country was raised
and will be discussed later in diplomatic forums.
"We'll have to examine the situation and see
where we go from there," Shultz said. He refused
to discuss the conditions on which the United
States might cut troop strength.
Gonzalez said last week he wanted to open talks
before a referendum promised next spring on
whether Spain should withdraw from NATO.
Reagan was unclear on when the talks might
begin. "That doesn't actually come up for formal
negotiations for a couple of years yet," he said.
