# Congress said to back Contra aid

### 
WASHINGTON — The trip to
Moscow by Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega has aroused a bitter
reaction in Congress that probably
will lead lawmakers to reverse them
selves and approve some aid for the
anti-government Contras, informed
congressional sources say.
It is still considered unlikely that
the House of Representatives would
approve any military aid, but
proposals focusing on humanitarian
aid such as food and medicine are
gathering support.
"I think there is a general feeling
that humanitarian assistance, which

isn't just provisions for troops, might
be widely accepted in the House,"
said Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa), one of
a number of House Republicans who
voted last week against military aid to
the Contras. He said in a telephone
interview Monday he would still
oppose military aid.
House Speaker Thomas "Tip"
O'Neill (D-Mass.) said Monday he
also would continue to oppose mili
tary aid, but added that Ortega
"embarrassed us" by the timing of his
trip to Moscow last week. "Whether
or not there is any real change of
heart, I don't know."

The announcement that Ortega
was going to Moscow to seek $200
million in Soviet economic assistance
came only hours before the House
voted down President Reagan's re
quest for $14 million in military aid
for the anti-Sandinista rebels. The
House also rejected several proposals
for non-military aid.
Many lawmakers did not find out
about the trip until after they voted,
and a number of them have reacted
with anger and said they would have
voted in favor of aid, had they known.
The issue could come up as early as
next week when the House takes up

the 1986 foreign aid authorization
bill.
The vote against the Contra aid
was seen as one of the worst congres
sional setbacks for Reagan since he
was elected president.
Any program that keeps aid going
for the Contras will mark a partial,
but not complete, victory for Reagan„
who had initially fought for $14 mil
lion in military assistance.
Opposition appeared still to be
strong against providing aid through
the Central Intelligence Agency,
which initially organized, financed
and directed the Contra insurgency.
