# Senate rejects Democratic budgets
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The
Republican-controlled Senate yester
day twice rejected Democratic efforts
to restore billions of dollars in pro
posed domestic spending cuts and
raise taxes by at least $60 billion over
three years to reduce federal deficits.
"If we want government programs,
we must also pay for them," said Sen.
Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.), helping to
lead the futile Democratic charge to
include non-personal tax hikes in the
massive deficit-reduction package the
Senate has been debating for more
than two weeks.
But GOP Leader Robert Dole
said, "If we can do it without raising
taxes, we should," as he made a gen
erally successful appeal to

Republicans to resist the Democratic
formula for deficit reduction. Even
so, Dole sounded less adamant in op
position to tax hikes than President
Reagan has been.
The action unfolded on the Senate
floor as Dole worked behind the
scenes to revise the original GOP
budget in a bid to win a final show
down expected either today or next
week.
Sources, who asked not to be iden
tified by name, said the Kansas Re
publican had agreed to restore some
funding for education as a concession
to dissident Republicans, just as he
had agreed earlier to restore money
for handicapped aid. Medicare and

other programs.
Both Democratic plans would have
cut deficits by more than the $295
billion, three-year total in the original
Reagan-backed budget, and would
have at least met the GOP deficit re
duction target of $100 billion by
1988.
The first Democratic proposal to
fail — on a vote of 63-35 — was
drafted by Hollings and Sen. Lawton
Chiles of Florida. It would have
frozen Social Security cost of living
increases for six months, scaled back
the Reagan defense buildup and held
spending on many domestic programs
at current levels rather than accept
the deep cuts and program elimina
tions contained in the GOP blueprint.

It called for $72 billion in higher
taxes over three years, although both
southern senators stressed that indi
vidual income tax rates would not be
affected. Their plan called for a mini
mum corporate tax to raise the bulk
of the increased revenue.
The second proposal, authored by
Democratic Leader Robert Byrd of
West Virginia, was similar in many
respects, although it would have pro
vided full Social Security cost of living
benefits, slightly more for military
spending and about $61 billion in
higher taxes — mainly through
closing "corporate tax loopholes" —
over three years. It failed on a vote of
54-43.
