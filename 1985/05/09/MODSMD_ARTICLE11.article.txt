Heart patient recovers
LOUISVILLE, Ky. — William Schroeder was
awake but not talking yesterday as a hospital
spokeswoman confirmed that a second stroke,
caused by bleeding in the brain, had weakened
the artificial heart patient's right side.
Schroeder's speech was impaired by a stroke in
mid-December. Doctors did not know yet
whether Monday's stroke further limited his abil
ity to speak, said Donna Hazle, public relations
director at Humana Hospital Audubon.
"The bleeding occurred from the left base of
the brain to the left frontal lobe," she said. Nerve
centers that control speech and movement for the
right side of the body are located in the area.
Schroeder, the longest-living recipient of a
Jarvik-7 pump, showed movement on his right
side, but "it's weaker than the other side," said
Bob Irvine, Humana Inc. director of public rela
tions.
Two other patients remain hospitalized —
Murray Haydon at Humana and an unidentified
man in Stockholm, Sweden. The other two
people to receive a Jarvik-7 have died.
Illiteracy condemned
WASHINGTON — If Thomas Jefferson came
back to modern-day America, he'd be delighted
with the machinery but dismayed by writing that
emits "the authentic stink of the synthetic prose
of a technological age," an honored scholar told
official Washington last night.
Cleanth Brooks, professor emeritus of rhetoric
at Yale University, declared that the state of
learning in America "amounts to a disaster, and
one of Pearl Harbor dimensions."
Brooks cited studies that show four 17-year

olds in 10 cannot comprehend ordinary docu
ments, 23 million adults arc functionally illiterate
and only 20 percent of high school seniors can
write a coherent essay.
I he lecture is delivered to an invited audience
of dignitaries, and the selection of the lecturer by
the National Council of the National Endowment
for the Humanities amounts to the highest honor
conferred each year by the federal government
for achievement in the humanities.
"1 shall have to be blunt," Brooks said in his
text. "Neither reading nor writing flourishes in
our blessed United States ... In important
respects, we are an illiterate nation. A large sec
tion of our population cannot read at all, and
many of those who can read do not read books."
Big cocaine busts
MIAMI — More than two tons of cocaine with
an estimated street value exceeding $1 billion
and a ton of marijuana were seized and five
people arrested in three separate drug cases yes
terday, officials said.
Also seized were three automatic weapons, 31
Quaalude tablets and $2,000 in cash.
The amounts of cocaine seized in each of the
two cocaine busts are among the 10 largest in the
United States, according to statistics compiled by
The Associated Press.
"We have men standing around the station
with machine guns," said Lt. Tom Griffiths of the
Florida City police department. "You can never
tell what'll happen."
The first cocaine seizure occurred after a Coast
Guard helicopter swooped down to check on a
boat traveling on Biscayne Bay with no lights on.
The boat sped off but was overpowered after a
15-minutc, 50 mph chase near downtown Miami
early yesterday.

Three suspects jumped overboard and swam
ashore, leaving the 30-foot vessel "spinning
around in circles," said Coast Guard spokes
woman Brenda Flint.
Bad news for police?
NEW YORK — Recent allegations of
brutality and other wrongdoing by police officers
in New York City signal deeper problems with
policing in America — chiefly in the way officers
are readied for their jobs, criminal justice profes
sionals say.
"We give police an incredible amount of
power, and we do that without giving them suffi
cient preparation," said Barbara Raffel Price,
dean of graduate studies at John Jay College of
Criminal Justice.
Experts say other factors contributing to the
problems include mismanagement in police de
partments and demographic changes, especially
the presence of more young officers on police
forces.
l ast week's indictment of five New York City
officers accused of torturing and beating drug
suspects topped a long list of recent charges
against city police, from assaults to a fatal hit
and-run and several shooting deaths.
Stocks drop
The stock market turned downward yesterday
as the mild rally of the past four sessions faded.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
10.71 points in the past four sessions, dropped
2.98 to 1,249.78.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
came to 101.27 million shares, against 100.15
million Tuesday.
