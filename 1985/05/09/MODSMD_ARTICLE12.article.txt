Nicaragua protest ends
SAN FRANCISCO— A noisy but non-violent
demonstration against President Reagan's
Central America policy broke up yesterday at the
federal building after two days and more than
550 arrests.
Police said about 300 were arrested yesterday.
Some demonstrators jumped over police bar
ricades and others sat in circles in front of
entrances to the building and waited for police to
pull them away.
Federal authorities, assisted by city police
wearing riot gear, helped government employees
climb over ranks of sitting demonstrators, some
of whom had spent a chilly night beside the steel
barricades outside the high-rise building.
Frustrated police finally closed one of two
street entries entirely, forcing the building's
5.000 workers and those doing business with the
government to use the opposite side of the build

ing or a basement garage.
The demonstrators, protesting the Reagan ad
ministration's trade embargo against Nicaragua,
sang "We Shall Not Be Moved" as helmctcd
police dragged them away to be photographed
and cited.
Cemetery strike settled
SAN FRANCISCO — Striking cemetery
workers yesterday reached a tentative agreement
that might mean burials can begin within the
week for hundreds of bodies that have piled up in
mortuaries since March.
Details of the settlement were being withheld
pending ratification by the ISO striking workers
at 11 San Francisco Peninsula cemeteries. Union
spokeswoman Joan Twomey said the ratification
vote was expected to take placc within a week.
"We feel it's a gotnl settlement, it's a decent

settlement," she said.
I he strike began March 2H among 70 workers
at eight cast San Francisco Bay cemeteries and
spread a day later to facilities in Colma and Palo
Alto. More than 800 bodies collected in mor
tuary storage lockers in the last six weeks.
If the contract is ratified, burials can begin im
mediately but must be worked into the regular
flow of business.
"The biggest problem is when it's over," said
Pat O'Connor of Roller, Hapgood and Tinney
Mortuary in Palo Alto. "The cemeteries can only
take so many a day."
Today's weather
It will be fair today, with highs in the bOs and
west-to-northwest afternoon winds at 10 to 25
mph. Tonight's lows will be in the mid-40s to
low-50s. Tomorrow the outlook will be much
the same, with possible highs in the low-70s.
