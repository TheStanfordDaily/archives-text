## Heart patients play serious waiting game 
### TODD RAMMING Senior staff writer 
"As a fire marshal, I have been provided with the train
ing and expertise to handle any situation. The environ
ment you get into (as a liref ighter) is not of your choosing.
But you go into that environment with the equipment and
protection needed to sustain your life — nothing like open
heart surgery, though," said Charles Gray of Santa Rosa.
Gray, 50, a native of California, is currently awaiting a
heart transplant from Stanford Medical Center.
In April 1980, Gray underwent five bypasses in
response to a previous asymptomatic, or "silent," heart
attack which was seen only retrospectively. Following the
surgery, he suffered "worsening heart failure," according
to Dr. Robert Nitkin, a visiting cardiologist here who is
caring for Gray.
In an August 1984 examination following a second
silent heart attack, it was detected that occlusion, or
blockage, had occurred in four of the five bypasses in
Gray's heart, Nitkin explained.
Following the diagnosis of occlusion of the bypasses,
Dr.. John Reed of Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital, who
performed the exam, notified Gray's wife, Gayle, that
"there's nothing they could do to fix the bypasses," Gayle
said.
That day, eight months ago, Gayle was given word
privately that her husband had six months to live. That
night, she did not sleep. In the morning, Charles was
taken to a conference room and given his diagnosis. "I
was waiting for him in his room when he came back,"
Gayle said. Totally devastated, she thought, "It just
couldn't happen, but it did."
Previously "very active both socially and in his work,"
Charles found himself placed quite against his will "in a
whole different world," Gayle said. Elected this year as
the president of the Santa Rosa Kiwanis, Charles now
"can't do anything. He doesn't have the energy to do any
thing," she said.
Charles applied for a transplant at Stanford and, being
accepted to the waiting list for a heart, continues to wait
on a "tether to the telephone and the beeper," according
to Gayle.
Before gaining acceptance onto the transplant waiting
list, a potential recipient undergoes numerous tests to
verify that no disease exists that would damage the trans
planted heart. "The disease should be a disease where the
heart is the organ that's gone wrong, as opposed to the
heart being affected by some systemic disease (that would
subsequently damage the transplanted heart)," said Dr.
Michael Fowler, a physician specialist in cardiology.
Patients awaiting transplants carry a pager that sounds
if a transplant becomes available. If a heart became
available for Charles, he would be brought here by the
fastest means possible, including the Stanford Life Flight
helicopter if necessary. Upon notification of an available
heart, the transplant operation "could occur within three
hours, but almost always within 24 hours," Nitkin said.
When a heart becomes available for Stanford, patients
■dfc selected to achieve a "best tit,"' based primarily on
body size and blood group. Other factors, such as infec
tion, could also render a potential heart recipient in
eligible when a transplant becomes available, Nitkin said.
"The waiting period is probably the most difficult,"
Charles said. "Stress probably gave me the heart attack in
the first place," he said, "but a lot of stress is still placed
on the patient while waiting."
J The stress placed on the patient during the waiting per
iod is "incalculable," Fowler concurred. The Cardiac Ad
vanced Therapies Clinic at Stanford, the group that cares
for patients on the waiting list, employs a specialist who
conducts very detailed psychological examinations of

patients seeking admission to the Stanford transplant
waiting list, according to Fowler.
Patients must be able to handle the stress both on the
waiting list and after transplantation, Fowler explained.
Informed that they need a transplant, patients are
keenly aware that they are unlikely to live much longer
with their current heart. Fowler said. They live from day
to day "wondering if they are going to die on the waiting
list," he said.
"Our biggest problem is donor availability," Nitkin
said. Although the question of how many more patients
could be saved if more donor hearts were made available
is problematic, it is indisputable that "donor availability is
the rate-limiting step" in the transplant process, Nitkin
said.
Most hearts become available after sudden and unex
pected death. When faced with the death of a loved one,
relatives "don't like to make the decision (about making
an organ available for donation) unless it's been dis
cussed," Nitkin said.
Before being forced into confronting the issue of heart
transplantation, Gayle said she would have told her
children not to carry donor cards, for fear that "somebody
might kill you just to get the organ or some stupid thing
like that."
The main issue, Nitkin said, is to educate the public on
the potential of the transplant program. When confronted
with the death of a loved one, relatives should place them
selves in the place of a potential transplant recipient, said
Shelley McCrory, a nurse in the Cardiac Advanced
Therapies Clinic.
Most heart donors are under age 30 and die from some
sort of head trauma, leaving the heart undamaged, Nitkin
explained. The first I met Charles, he offered to give me
an old motorcycle. "No helmet, though," he joked.
During the period of waiting, Gayle occupies a unique,
and often unenviable, position as the mother. "I'm re
sponsible for doing everything," said Gayle, who contin
ues her job as a real estate broker. The Grays have three
children, Brad, 27, Scott, 24, and Leslie, 21.
"Everybody's rallying around me. Everybody's watch
ing me," Gayle said. "I tell him nothing that's a problem,"
she said. "It seems if I crack, then everyone will."
Although continuing to lead their lives, the children
never stop thinking about their father. Scott recently
moved back home to help. All three telephone constantly.
Leslie returns home each weekend from California State
University at Sacramento to see her father. "She's afraid
she'll miss one minute with him," Gayle said.
Reacting initially with total disbelief, the children share
a "fear to lose their father," Gayle said.
In the period first following Charles' diagnosis, "my
first thought was he was going to die," Gayle said. "I'd
wake up in the morning and check to see if he was breath
ing."
At first, "I used to get angry — angry at God," Gayle
said. During the first few days following the diagnosis,
Gayle kept a journal in which she recorded her feelings as
the time progressed. Rereading the journal some time
later, "I got so angry at the things I read that I tore the
pages out," she said.
"We both have tremendous religious faith," Gayle said.
"It's not that this isn't frustrating in a way, but because of
our religious beliefs, we believe that everything is going to
be fine."
As Charles continues his second month of life beyond
the limit doctors estimated for him, he has of late become
• "veFy frustrated," Gayle said. As the time wears on in the
waiting period, "I think your patience wanes a little bit,"
Charles said.
Confronted with a fate placed beyond his control into

the hands of doctors, nurses and potential donors, Charles
remarked, "Being a supervisor, it's difficult to have total
faith in the system, the system being other people."
Charles places what trust he can, however, in the Stan
ford medical staff. "The experience and the select criteria
necessary to be eligible (for transplant) led me to believe
it (Stanford) was the best place for my survival."
Stanford currently averages 40 to 50 transplants per
year and has performed more than 350 since the inception
of the heart transplantation program, Fowler said. At a
given time, approximately 12 to 20 people are on the
waiting list here.
Though disenchanted by eight months of waiting, Gayle
said she believes "Stanford is such a good hospital that
they will not plant him with a heart that will not work.
"You have to talk yourself into getting your spirits up
again."
"I'm not making myself out to be a martyr," Gayle said.
Whenever she calls home from work and receives no an
swer, she rushes home to investigate. "I often get very
frustrated," she said. When heading home to check on her
husband, "I go down the street screaming sometimes,"
she said.
When Charles applied for admission to the Stanford
waiting list, a psychologist asked Gayle who was going to
take care of her during the waiting period. "I responded,
'Who, me? I don't need anyone to take care of me,' "

Gayle recalled. "As time goes on, I'm beginning to
wonder."
Friends have offered help in every way, through
"money, time, whatever they have," she said.
Gayle believes the ordeal has drawn the couple closer
together. "He wants to see everybody and talk about
things," she said." He wants to go to the ocean and look at
the waves when I am ready to sit down and read a book
and rest."
Now, however, "I go home and I talk to him," she said.
"He could drop dead at any minute," Gayle said. With
death in such immediate perspective, "Time and distance
don't seem as relative as they do in everyday life," Charles
said.
"I'm at peace with everybody. I've led a regimented,
orderly life."
"(In my job,) I've seen so much death it doesn't bother
me," Charles said. "My house is in order, my car is not,"
he quipped, clearing some books and paperwork from the
backseat as the couple prepared to head for lunch.
For Charles Gray, each step in the past five years —
from proper diet to the bypass surgery — has bought some
time. Currently, according to statistics, 80 percent of
those patients receiving heart transplants will survive their
first two years, Fowler said.
"With the transplant, we'll buy some more time,"
Charles said.

list, a potential recipient undergoes numerous tests to
verify that no disease exists that would damage the trans
planted heart. "The disease should be a disease where the
heart is the organ that's gone wrong, as opposed to the
heart being affected by some systemic disease (that would
subsequently damage the transplanted heart)," said Dr.
Michael Fowler, a physician specialist in cardiology.
Patients awaiting transplants carry a pager that sounds
if a transplant becomes available. If a heart became
available for Charles, he would be brought here by the
fastest means possible, including the Stanford Life Flight
helicopter if necessary. Upon notification of an available
heart, the transplant operation "could occur within three
hours, but almost always within 24 hours," Nitkin said.
When a heart becomes available for Stanford, patients
■dfc selected to achieve a "best tit,"' based primarily on
body size and blood group. Other factors, such as infec
tion, could also render a potential heart recipient in
eligible when a transplant becomes available, Nitkin said.
"The waiting period is probably the most difficult,"
Charles said. "Stress probably gave me the heart attack in
the first place," he said, "but a lot of stress is still placed
on the patient while waiting."
J The stress placed on the patient during the waiting per
iod is "incalculable," Fowler concurred. The Cardiac Ad
vanced Therapies Clinic at Stanford, the group that cares
for patients on the waiting list, employs a specialist who
conducts very detailed psychological examinations of

patients seeking admission to the Stanford transplant
waiting list, according to Fowler.
Patients must be able to handle the stress both on the
waiting list and after transplantation, Fowler explained.
Informed that they need a transplant, patients are
keenly aware that they are unlikely to live much longer
with their current heart. Fowler said. They live from day
to day "wondering if they are going to die on the waiting
list," he said.
"Our biggest problem is donor availability," Nitkin
said. Although the question of how many more patients
could be saved if more donor hearts were made available
is problematic, it is indisputable that "donor availability is
the rate-limiting step" in the transplant process, Nitkin
said.
Most hearts become available after sudden and unex
pected death. When faced with the death of a loved one,
relatives "don't like to make the decision (about making
an organ available for donation) unless it's been dis
cussed," Nitkin said.
Before being forced into confronting the issue of heart
transplantation, Gayle said she would have told her
children not to carry donor cards, for fear that "somebody
might kill you just to get the organ or some stupid thing
like that."
The main issue, Nitkin said, is to educate the public on
the potential of the transplant program. When confronted
with the death of a loved one, relatives should place them
selves in the place of a potential transplant recipient, said
Shelley McCrory, a nurse in the Cardiac Advanced
Therapies Clinic.
Most heart donors are under age 30 and die from some
sort of head trauma, leaving the heart undamaged, Nitkin
explained. The first I met Charles, he offered to give me
an old motorcycle. "No helmet, though," he joked.
During the period of waiting, Gayle occupies a unique,
and often unenviable, position as the mother. "I'm re
sponsible for doing everything," said Gayle, who contin
ues her job as a real estate broker. The Grays have three
children, Brad, 27, Scott, 24, and Leslie, 21.
"Everybody's rallying around me. Everybody's watch
ing me," Gayle said. "I tell him nothing that's a problem,"
she said. "It seems if I crack, then everyone will."
Although continuing to lead their lives, the children
never stop thinking about their father. Scott recently
moved back home to help. All three telephone constantly.
Leslie returns home each weekend from California State
University at Sacramento to see her father. "She's afraid
she'll miss one minute with him," Gayle said.
Reacting initially with total disbelief, the children share
a "fear to lose their father," Gayle said.
In the period first following Charles' diagnosis, "my
first thought was he was going to die," Gayle said. "I'd
wake up in the morning and check to see if he was breath
ing."
At first, "I used to get angry — angry at God," Gayle
said. During the first few days following the diagnosis,
Gayle kept a journal in which she recorded her feelings as
the time progressed. Rereading the journal some time
later, "I got so angry at the things I read that I tore the
pages out," she said.
"We both have tremendous religious faith," Gayle said.
"It's not that this isn't frustrating in a way, but because of
our religious beliefs, we believe that everything is going to
be fine."
As Charles continues his second month of life beyond
the limit doctors estimated for him, he has of late become
• "veFy frustrated," Gayle said. As the time wears on in the
waiting period, "I think your patience wanes a little bit,"
Charles said.
Confronted with a fate placed beyond his control into

the hands of doctors, nurses and potential donors, Charles
remarked, "Being a supervisor, it's difficult to have total
faith in the system, the system being other people."
Charles places what trust he can, however, in the Stan
ford medical staff. "The experience and the select criteria
necessary to be eligible (for transplant) led me to believe
it (Stanford) was the best place for my survival."
Stanford currently averages 40 to 50 transplants per
year and has performed more than 350 since the inception
of the heart transplantation program, Fowler said. At a
given time, approximately 12 to 20 people are on the
waiting list here.
Though disenchanted by eight months of waiting, Gayle
said she believes "Stanford is such a good hospital that
they will not plant him with a heart that will not work.
"You have to talk yourself into getting your spirits up
again."
"I'm not making myself out to be a martyr," Gayle said.
Whenever she calls home from work and receives no an
swer, she rushes home to investigate. "I often get very
frustrated," she said. When heading home to check on her
husband, "I go down the street screaming sometimes,"
she said.
When Charles applied for admission to the Stanford
waiting list, a psychologist asked Gayle who was going to
take care of her during the waiting period. "I responded,
'Who, me? I don't need anyone to take care of me,' "

Gayle recalled. "As time goes on, I'm beginning to
wonder."
Friends have offered help in every way, through
"money, time, whatever they have," she said.
Gayle believes the ordeal has drawn the couple closer
together. "He wants to see everybody and talk about
things," she said." He wants to go to the ocean and look at
the waves when I am ready to sit down and read a book
and rest."
Now, however, "I go home and I talk to him," she said.
"He could drop dead at any minute," Gayle said. With
death in such immediate perspective, "Time and distance
don't seem as relative as they do in everyday life," Charles
said.
"I'm at peace with everybody. I've led a regimented,
orderly life."
"(In my job,) I've seen so much death it doesn't bother
me," Charles said. "My house is in order, my car is not,"
he quipped, clearing some books and paperwork from the
backseat as the couple prepared to head for lunch.
For Charles Gray, each step in the past five years —
from proper diet to the bypass surgery — has bought some
time. Currently, according to statistics, 80 percent of
those patients receiving heart transplants will survive their
first two years, Fowler said.
"With the transplant, we'll buy some more time,"
Charles said.

According to Dr. Michael Fowler, a physician specializing in cardiology, people like heart patient Charles
Gray (right) live from day to day "wondering if they are going to die on the waiting list."
"As a fire marshal, I have been provided with the train
ing and expertise to handle any situation. The environ
ment you get into (as a liref ighter) is not of your choosing.
But you go into that environment with the equipment and
protection needed to sustain your life — nothing like open
heart surgery, though," said Charles Gray of Santa Rosa.
Gray, 50, a native of California, is currently awaiting a
heart transplant from Stanford Medical Center.
In April 1980, Gray underwent five bypasses in
response to a previous asymptomatic, or "silent," heart
attack which was seen only retrospectively. Following the
surgery, he suffered "worsening heart failure," according
to Dr. Robert Nitkin, a visiting cardiologist here who is
caring for Gray.
In an August 1984 examination following a second
silent heart attack, it was detected that occlusion, or
blockage, had occurred in four of the five bypasses in
Gray's heart, Nitkin explained.
Following the diagnosis of occlusion of the bypasses,
Dr.. John Reed of Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital, who
performed the exam, notified Gray's wife, Gayle, that
"there's nothing they could do to fix the bypasses," Gayle
said.
That day, eight months ago, Gayle was given word
privately that her husband had six months to live. That
night, she did not sleep. In the morning, Charles was
taken to a conference room and given his diagnosis. "I
was waiting for him in his room when he came back,"
Gayle said. Totally devastated, she thought, "It just
couldn't happen, but it did."
Previously "very active both socially and in his work,"
Charles found himself placed quite against his will "in a
whole different world," Gayle said. Elected this year as
the president of the Santa Rosa Kiwanis, Charles now
"can't do anything. He doesn't have the energy to do any
thing," she said.
Charles applied for a transplant at Stanford and, being
accepted to the waiting list for a heart, continues to wait
on a "tether to the telephone and the beeper," according
to Gayle.
Before gaining acceptance onto the transplant waiting
list, a potential recipient undergoes numerous tests to
verify that no disease exists that would damage the trans
planted heart. "The disease should be a disease where the

pected death. When faced with the death of a loved one,
relatives "don't like to make the decision (about making
an organ available for donation) unless it's been dis
cussed," Nitkin said.
Before being forced into confronting the issue of heart
transplantation, Gayle said she would have told her
children not to carry donor cards, for fear that "somebody
might kill you just to get the organ or some stupid thing
like that."
The main issue, Nitkin said, is to educate the public on
the potential of the transplant program. When confronted
with the death of a loved one, relatives should place them
selves in the place of a potential transplant recipient, said
Shelley McCrory, a nurse in the Cardiac Advanced
Therapies Clinic.
Most heart donors are under age 30 and die from some
sort of head trauma, leaving the heart undamaged, Nitkin
explained. The first I met Charles, he offered to give me
an old motorcycle. "No helmet, though," he joked.
During the period of waiting, Gayle occupies a unique,
and often unenviable, position as the mother. "I'm re
sponsible for doing everything," said Gayle, who contin
ues her job as a real estate broker. The Grays have three
children, Brad, 27, Scott, 24, and Leslie, 21.
"Everybody's rallying around me. Everybody's watch
ing me," Gayle said. "I tell him nothing that's a problem,"
she said. "It seems if I crack, then everyone will."
Although continuing to lead their lives, the children
never stop thinking about their father. Scott recently
moved back home to help. All three telephone constantly.
Leslie returns home each weekend from California State
University at Sacramento to see her father. "She's afraid
she'll miss one minute with him," Gayle said.
Reacting initially with total disbelief, the children share
a "fear to lose their father," Gayle said.
In the period first following Charles' diagnosis, "my
first thought was he was going to die," Gayle said. "I'd
wake up in the morning and check to see if he was breath
ing."
At first, "I used to get angry — angry at God," Gayle
said. During the first few days following the diagnosis,
Gayle kept a journal in which she recorded her feelings as
the time progressed. Rereading the journal some time
later, "I got so angry at the things I read that I tore the
pages out," she said.
"We both have tremendous religious faith," Gayle said.
"It's not that this isn't frustrating in a way, but because of
our religious beliefs, we believe that everything is going to
be fine."
As Charles continues his second month of life beyond
the limit doctors estimated for him, he has of late become
• "veFy frustrated," Gayle said. As the time wears on in the
waiting period, "I think your patience wanes a little bit,"
Charles said.
Confronted with a fate placed beyond his control into

the hands of doctors, nurses and potential donors, Charles
remarked, "Being a supervisor, it's difficult to have total
faith in the system, the system being other people."
Charles places what trust he can, however, in the Stan
ford medical staff. "The experience and the select criteria
necessary to be eligible (for transplant) led me to believe
it (Stanford) was the best place for my survival."
Stanford currently averages 40 to 50 transplants per
year and has performed more than 350 since the inception
of the heart transplantation program, Fowler said. At a
given time, approximately 12 to 20 people are on the
waiting list here.
Though disenchanted by eight months of waiting, Gayle
said she believes "Stanford is such a good hospital that
they will not plant him with a heart that will not work.
"You have to talk yourself into getting your spirits up
again."
"I'm not making myself out to be a martyr," Gayle said.
Whenever she calls home from work and receives no an
swer, she rushes home to investigate. "I often get very
frustrated," she said. When heading home to check on her
husband, "I go down the street screaming sometimes,"
she said.
When Charles applied for admission to the Stanford
waiting list, a psychologist asked Gayle who was going to
take care of her during the waiting period. "I responded,
'Who, me? I don't need anyone to take care of me,' "

Gayle recalled. "As time goes on, I'm beginning to
wonder."
Friends have offered help in every way, through
"money, time, whatever they have," she said.
Gayle believes the ordeal has drawn the couple closer
together. "He wants to see everybody and talk about
things," she said." He wants to go to the ocean and look at
the waves when I am ready to sit down and read a book
and rest."
Now, however, "I go home and I talk to him," she said.
"He could drop dead at any minute," Gayle said. With
death in such immediate perspective, "Time and distance
don't seem as relative as they do in everyday life," Charles
said.
"I'm at peace with everybody. I've led a regimented,
orderly life."
"(In my job,) I've seen so much death it doesn't bother
me," Charles said. "My house is in order, my car is not,"
he quipped, clearing some books and paperwork from the
backseat as the couple prepared to head for lunch.
For Charles Gray, each step in the past five years —
from proper diet to the bypass surgery — has bought some
time. Currently, according to statistics, 80 percent of
those patients receiving heart transplants will survive their
first two years, Fowler said.
"With the transplant, we'll buy some more time,"
Charles said.

According to Dr. Michael Fowler, a physician specializing in cardiology, people like heart patient Charles
Gray (right) live from day to day "wondering if they are going to die on the waiting list."
