## THE 						STANFORD DAILY Emphasize teaching 
### 
The notion that professors at this, or any, uni
versity be good teachers should not be a hope —
it should be an expectation. Thus, when headlines
in The Daily read, "Teaching skill given
priority," one has to wonder what the priority
was before.
The Faculty Senate voted last Thursday to in
clude teaching effectiveness among the other five
criteria that the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (C-US) now uses to determine whether a
course can fulfill a distribution requirement.
Previously, the C-US used course evaluations
by students to determine the relative effective
ness of the professor. The new criteria will re
quire that a department chairman prove to the
dean of that area of study that the professor
teaching the course is effective. If the chairman
and dean agree, they must send a letter to the C
US stating proof of ability was shown.
Such information shouldn't be difficult to come
by. All departments keep information on the
teaching ability of their professors. Aside from
student evaluations, there are peer evaluations
based on lectures, critiques of syllabi and letters
from students, as well as the results of the annual
senior survey.
But the important thing about the Faculty Sen

ate's decision is that it provides for better as
surances that distribution requirements are
taught well. Although the importance of courses
meeting the distribution requirements may seem
overplayed in this case, Chemistry Prof. Hans
Andersen, a member of the C-US, explained the
importance of this assurance. "If you have a sci
ence student taking his only humanities course,
or a humanities student taking his only science
course, that's their only exposure to that area. It's
my feeling that it is important that that course be
well taught," he said.
The basic argument against this is that poor
teaching is an excusable flaw if the professor has
some other redeeming quality. Philosophy Prof.
John Perry told the Faculty Senate that the op
portunity for students to take a course from a
well-known "brilliant and distinguished" profes
sor outweighed ineffective teaching. However, it
seems to make no sense to take a class if the best
a student can hope for is to learn by osmosis.
We can only agree with Andersen's judgment
on the importance of distribution requirements.
And certainly it seems that the new criteria serves
as a further assurance, albeit not a perfect one,
that these courses will be taught well and that
teaching will be the emphasis.
