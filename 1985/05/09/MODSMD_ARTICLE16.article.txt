# STUART REGES
## Gay people, we need to open up about our lives 
### 
The decision to explain nothing about my life
left an odd void where a life should have been.
-Andrew Holleran, "Nights in Aruba"
One of my freshman advisees caught me
buying flowers in White Plaza on Valentine's
Day. "Who are they for?" he asked. I quickly
summoned up one of my genderless terms and
replied, "Someone special." He asked again,
and 1 dodged again, leaving us both in an un
comfortable silence.

VIEWPOINT

This is just one of the many instances where
I have been forced to choose whether to open
up about my sexuality or whether to hide it.
Gay people make such choices constantly,
most often choosing silence rather than
sharing.
If I were heterosexual, it would be different.
I could say, "I have a girlfriend named Mi
chelle," and this would be just one more fact
about me. If, however, I were to say, "I have a
boyfriend named Mike," I am saying much
more. This conjures up all of the gay myths
my listener might believe, so I am in effect
saying something like, "Stuart has a
boyfriend, which means he's gay, which
means he's had thousands of sex partners, and
he's a child molester, and he's sad and
suicidal, and he'll never have children, and so
on."
Because I don't want to shock people, I
usually don't reveal my sexuality when ques
tions like this are asked. I instead wait until I
have the chance to open up and talk about my
sexuality, answering any questions that might
come up. I realize how ignorant 1 was of the
gay community before I made contact with it,
so I am understanding of other people's ig

norance.
Until recently, I have been ambivalent
about opening up to advisees and students. A
few years ago, I started believing that I
shouldn't. I was making the transition be
tween being a Stanford student and being a
Stanford staff member and was trying to fig
ure out what it means to be "professional."
Several people convinced me that it isn't pro
fessional to discuss your sexuality with your
students, nor to write articles like this one.
The people who convinced me had the power
to prevent my being hired and also had the
power to cause me to be fired afterward, so it
was more than just a casual suggestion. I was
coerced into becoming an antiseptic profes
sional, doing my job and leaving my private
life at home.
Three years of considering this question
have convinced me that I was wrong to give
in. In theory, we all have jobs to perform, and
those job descriptions do not include anything
about our personal lives. But in practice, we
are people, and we are bound to interact the
way people do, even on the job. Most such in
teraction is ignored. The rule about not dis
cussing one's personal life is only invoked
when the personal life is potentially objec
tionable.
Let me give an example. Since I am a
teacher, I tend to think back on teachers
whom I have known. There were many teach
ers in high school with whom I was close,
especially those who sponsored clubs that I
belonged to. I usually knew a lot about these
teachers' private lives. I knew if they were
married, what their children were like, what
religion they were and so on. Some of the
teachers, however, guarded their personal
lives and avoided all inquiries. I have since

found out that those teachers are gay and
didn't talk about it for fear of being fired.
This is a form of institutionalized morality.
Rules exist to control people (e.g., "Teachers
shouldn't discuss their private lives with their
students"), but are only enforced when an in
dividual crosses a moral boundary. Teachers
can talk about being married and having
children and going to church, but mentioning
that you're gay is unprofessional and forbid
den.
The main argument against gays opening
up has always been, "If we want our children
to be heterosexual, we have to shelter them
from any knowledge of the gay lifestyle." This
argument stems from the idea that
homosexuality is acquired and not innate.
Most concerned parents seem to think that
homosexuality is something like drug abuse or
Moonieism. Healthy children are exposed to
evil practices that somehow trap them. The
healthy children can usually be brought back
to normal, however, through prayer and love
and psychotherapy and, if necessary,
deprogramming. "
Gay people like myself, however, see
homosexuality as something like left
handedness. We feel that it is natural for a
small portion of the population to have a dif
ferent orientation than the rest. This orienta
tion is determined at such an early age that for
all practical purposes we can consider it
innate. Trying to make a left-handed child use
his right hand only causes frustration all
around, mostly for the child. Keeping the
child away from "left-handed role models"
and other "left-handed influences" will not
change the child's basic orientation. Con
versely, presenting left-handedness as a viable
option will not increase the incidence of it. It

will merely make left-handed children's lives
much more pleasant.
Left-handedness is a nice parallel, because
it previously had almost the same status as
homosexuality. In medieval times, it was con
sidered a sign of possession by the devil. The
word "sinister" derives from "on the left."
Yet we now know that it is natural for some
children to use their left hand.
Many studies have come out in the last 20
years about the origins of sexuality. These
studies support the "left-handed" model
much more than the "drug abuse" one. They
disagree about what can be ascribed to
homosexuality versus heterosexuality and
what are causes versus effects, but they have
almost universal agreement on one point: A
person's basic sexual orientation is deter
mined very early in life. Most experts feel that
it happens before the child even makes it to
kindergarten. Even Masters and Johnson's fa
mous report, which many hailed as the long
awaited cure for homosexuality, said that
heterosexual dysfunction can often b£ curkd
by their techniques, but that the basic orienta
tion remains unchanged. In less fancy words,
many gay people can be taught how to have
sex with members of the opposite sex, but the
basic gay orientation remains.
I, therefore, don't accept the argument that
gay role models somehow turn children gay. I
believe they only serve to ease the frustration
felt by those children who are trying to
become something that they aren't.
The people I talked to three years ago said,
"If you want to get anywhere, you've got to
be quiet about being gay. You can be gay, just
don't talk about it." This reminds me of what
blacks and women have been told for years.
The only way to make it is to renounce any

connection to our communities. If we act
white and male and heterosexual, then we
have a chance of being accepted even though
we might not fit one or more of those
categories. "The losers." our friends warn us,
"are the blacks who act black and the women
who act feminine and the homosexuals who
act gay."
For three years I've tried to be a winner.
Why, then, do I feel that I've lost so much?
I've lost my openness and my individuality,
my spontaneity and my charm. I'm not a
whole person anymore. I'm just now realizing
what a loser I've been. The real losers,
though, have been my students and the
people that I work with. They've missed the
opportunity to share my life and to under
stand the culture that I'm part of. They've
missed an important opportunity to learn. ♦
I realize now that gay people like myself
need to start opening up about our lives. Only
then will people start understanding gay con
cerns. Only then will people start realizing
that it isn't an "us versus them" issue, that gay
people are everywhere. Only then will youAg
people have the role models they need to help
them accept their gay feelings.
This week is Gay and Lesbian Awareness
Week, a time for straight people to ask ques
tions and a time for gay people to answer
them. I hope that all of the gay people at
Stanford will take the opportunity to open up
to someone new, so that he or she can under
stand us better. And 1 hope that all of the
straight people will take the opportunity to
listen to and ask questions of their gay friends
and teachers and co-workers.

The decision to explain nothing about my life
left an odd void where a life should have been.
-Andrew Holleran, "Nights in Aruba"
One of my freshman advisees caught me
buying flowers in White Plaza on Valentine's
Day. "Who are they for?" he asked. I quickly
summoned up one of my genderless terms and
replied, "Someone special." He asked again,
and 1 dodged again, leaving us both in an un
comfortable silence.

VIEWPOINT

This is just one of the many instances where
I have been forced to choose whether to open
up about my sexuality or whether to hide it.
Gay people make such choices constantly,
most often choosing silence rather than
sharing.
If I were heterosexual, it would be different.
I could say, "I have a girlfriend named Mi
chelle," and this would be just one more fact
about me. If, however, I were to say, "I have a
boyfriend named Mike," I am saying much
more. This conjures up all of the gay myths
my listener might believe, so I am in effect
saying something like, "Stuart has a
boyfriend, which means he's gay, which
means he's had thousands of sex partners, and
he's a child molester, and he's sad and
suicidal, and he'll never have children, and so
on."
Because I don't want to shock people, I
usually don't reveal my sexuality when ques
tions like this are asked. I instead wait until I
have the chance to open up and talk about my
sexuality, answering any questions that might
come up. I realize how ignorant 1 was of the
gay community before I made contact with it,
so I am understanding of other people's ig

norance.
Until recently, I have been ambivalent
about opening up to advisees and students. A
few years ago, I started believing that I
shouldn't. I was making the transition be
tween being a Stanford student and being a
Stanford staff member and was trying to fig
ure out what it means to be "professional."
Several people convinced me that it isn't pro
fessional to discuss your sexuality with your
students, nor to write articles like this one.
The people who convinced me had the power
to prevent my being hired and also had the
power to cause me to be fired afterward, so it
was more than just a casual suggestion. I was
coerced into becoming an antiseptic profes
sional, doing my job and leaving my private
life at home.
Three years of considering this question
have convinced me that I was wrong to give
in. In theory, we all have jobs to perform, and
those job descriptions do not include anything
about our personal lives. But in practice, we
are people, and we are bound to interact the
way people do, even on the job. Most such in
teraction is ignored. The rule about not dis
cussing one's personal life is only invoked
when the personal life is potentially objec
tionable.
Let me give an example. Since I am a
teacher, I tend to think back on teachers
whom I have known. There were many teach
ers in high school with whom I was close,
especially those who sponsored clubs that I
belonged to. I usually knew a lot about these
teachers' private lives. I knew if they were
married, what their children were like, what
religion they were and so on. Some of the
teachers, however, guarded their personal
lives and avoided all inquiries. I have since

found out that those teachers are gay and
didn't talk about it for fear of being fired.
This is a form of institutionalized morality.
Rules exist to control people (e.g., "Teachers
shouldn't discuss their private lives with their
students"), but are only enforced when an in
dividual crosses a moral boundary. Teachers
can talk about being married and having
children and going to church, but mentioning
that you're gay is unprofessional and forbid
den.
The main argument against gays opening
up has always been, "If we want our children
to be heterosexual, we have to shelter them
from any knowledge of the gay lifestyle." This
argument stems from the idea that
homosexuality is acquired and not innate.
Most concerned parents seem to think that
homosexuality is something like drug abuse or
Moonieism. Healthy children are exposed to
evil practices that somehow trap them. The
healthy children can usually be brought back
to normal, however, through prayer and love
and psychotherapy and, if necessary,
deprogramming. "
Gay people like myself, however, see
homosexuality as something like left
handedness. We feel that it is natural for a
small portion of the population to have a dif
ferent orientation than the rest. This orienta
tion is determined at such an early age that for
all practical purposes we can consider it
innate. Trying to make a left-handed child use
his right hand only causes frustration all
around, mostly for the child. Keeping the
child away from "left-handed role models"
and other "left-handed influences" will not
change the child's basic orientation. Con
versely, presenting left-handedness as a viable
option will not increase the incidence of it. It

will merely make left-handed children's lives
much more pleasant.
Left-handedness is a nice parallel, because
it previously had almost the same status as
homosexuality. In medieval times, it was con
sidered a sign of possession by the devil. The
word "sinister" derives from "on the left."
Yet we now know that it is natural for some
children to use their left hand.
Many studies have come out in the last 20
years about the origins of sexuality. These
studies support the "left-handed" model
much more than the "drug abuse" one. They
disagree about what can be ascribed to
homosexuality versus heterosexuality and
what are causes versus effects, but they have
almost universal agreement on one point: A
person's basic sexual orientation is deter
mined very early in life. Most experts feel that
it happens before the child even makes it to
kindergarten. Even Masters and Johnson's fa
mous report, which many hailed as the long
awaited cure for homosexuality, said that
heterosexual dysfunction can often b£ curkd
by their techniques, but that the basic orienta
tion remains unchanged. In less fancy words,
many gay people can be taught how to have
sex with members of the opposite sex, but the
basic gay orientation remains.
I, therefore, don't accept the argument that
gay role models somehow turn children gay. I
believe they only serve to ease the frustration
felt by those children who are trying to
become something that they aren't.
The people I talked to three years ago said,
"If you want to get anywhere, you've got to
be quiet about being gay. You can be gay, just
don't talk about it." This reminds me of what
blacks and women have been told for years.
The only way to make it is to renounce any
