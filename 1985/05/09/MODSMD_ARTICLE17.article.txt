# Send a Mother's Day gift to Ma Bell

It's nice to think that in this world of rapid and
ever-increasing change there will always be at least
one universal constant that we can anchor our lives
to: The telephone company will always be run by
imbeciles. Yes, people may come and go, and the
mountains may erode into the sea, but Ma Bell will
still be there telling you to deposit 25 cents into
your home phone.
As you've probably deduced, I've been having
problems with my pals at Pacific Bell again. I'll
spare you the agonizing details, but, as you've no
doubt surmised, your faithful narrator did not come
out a winner. A few random quotes from my con
versation with the friendly service representative
should give you a fairly clear picture of the whole
ordeal.
"It sounds like you're calling from Australia," 1
was told. Evidently she hadn't been watching the
AT&T commercials. "We've never lost a check,
not ever, but if you can prove we cashed it, we'll
restore your service free of charge." Toward the
end I was informed, "Oh no sir, we would hate to
cut off your service and lose you as a customer."
Presumably she was worried that after they cut off
my service I was going to take my business else
where: Joe's Telephone Service, for instance.
Eventually, I realized that I was indulging in a
particularly insidious form of masochism and quit
trying to reason with her. Pacific Bell has us by the
proverbial glands and they don't see any reason in
the world to treat us any better than cattle. And
they never will either, unless we give them one.
Now you. too. have probably had some bad ex
periences with the phone company and probably
feel just as powerless to deal with them as I do. As
long as they have something that we all need, and
can't get any place else, they'll continue to treat us
like the czar treated the serfs. Remember what
happened to the czar. Thanks to the breakup of Ma
Bell, we finally have a chance to get back at the
bastards.
Now, I'm not suggesting that you should go rip a
pay phone off the wall. That's actually coun
terproductive since they just replace it and raise
your rates to pay for it. I'm suggesting you hit them
where it hurts the most, in their profit margin. A lot
of Pacific Bell's business is now unregulated, and
they have to compete just like a real company. It's
time that we made them pay for 50 years of the cus
tomer is always wrong.
If you're in a feisty mood, give them a call. Don't
call the complaints department — the cost of that
just gets passed on to you through the Public
Utilities Commission — call their business office
(1 >800-556-2020). Affect a heavy accent and ask
for someone who speaks Etruscan. When that's not

forthcoming, try a couple of other obscure lan
guages — Esperanto, for instance — and then hang
up, muttering darkly that "Armenia will be free."
Call them right back and, in your normal voice,
start talking business. Imply that you're running a
brothel (they won't care — these are the same
people that invited little kids to call Santa at 50
cents a crack) and need about a dozen outside lines
now and maybe 50 by next year. Get the salesper
son's hopes way up there. Talk until you get bored;
it'll be good practice. Get their price and tell them
that they're 50 percent higher than the next lowest
bid and that you're really mad at the guy for was
ting your time. Then hang up. This is guaranteed to
drive them crazy. Don't feel sorry for them just be
cause they're small fry. The"I just work here"
defense didn't work at Nuremburg and it doesn't
work here.

That doesn't mean that the high-level executives
should escape your attention. After all, if there are
going to he changes at the telephone company
they're going to have to come from the top. There
are an infinite number of perfectly legal ways you
can bring your dissatisfaction to the attention of the
upper management of Pacific Telesis.
For instance, you could send the following letter
to the chairman of the board of IBM (John F.
Akers, International Business Machines Corpora
tion, Armonk, NY 10504):
"It seems inevitable, due to the recent advances
in cellular communications, that IBM will soon be
able to go into direct competition with the local
telephone operating companies. The only question
that remains is, is there a market for another phone
company? Yes, Mr. Akers, there is. Given the op
portunity, I would dump Pacific Bell like a dead
gopher. I would be perfectly willing to pay extra —
although it's hard to believe that you couldn't beat
them on price — to escape from the clutches ,of the
octopus."
Naturally, you will get little satisfaction from this
letter unless you send a copy of it to the chairman

of the board of Pacific Telesis (Donald E. Guinn,
Pacific Telesis Group, 140 New Montgomery St.,
San Francisco, CA 94105).
Speaking of Mr. Guinn, you might drop him a
note as well:
"In my Introduction to Business Administration
class, we're discussing how to evaluate business
proposals, using a telephone system as an example.
We're trying to evaluate the subjective aspects of
the proposals and have run into real difficulty in as
signing a penalty cost for doing business with
Pacific Telephone. The professor has suggested a
flat 50 percent penalty, the class wants to use 130
percent and I'd like to use 85 percent minus .01T,
where T is the cost in millions of dollars. Who do
you think is right?"
Or you could just invite him to speak at the next
meeting of the local chapter of Socialized Dialing,
whichever you feel will do the most damage to his
digestive tract.
If you feel that some sort of concrete action is re
quired, how about starting a rumor? You've prob
ably heard that a certain fast food chain is using
kangaroo meat in their burgers and that a certain
consumer products company support Satanism, but
nobody has told you that you can contract AIDS
from public telephones (that is until now). Don't
panic, that's only an unconfirmed rumor. And
speaking of devil worship, have you taken a close
look at the Pacific Bell logo?
And how about all that junk mail they've been
showering us with lately, the ones with the little
business-reply mail envelopes in them? You
haven't been throwing those away, have you? The
Post Office doesn't deliver them free as a service to
the business community. Next time you get one,
send it in. And if it happens to get stuck to the
outside of a brick on its way to the mailbox, well,
accidents will happen.
The possibilities are endless. Use your imagina
tion. Write a letter to Caspar Weinberger, telling
him that Pacific Telesis executives are charging
their mistresses' abortions to the Defense Depart
ment. .Speaking of abortions, you might call the
Public Utilities Commission (557-3447) and in
quire as to why New Yorkers can buy private pay
telephones, and they're selling like hot cakes, while
Californians can't. You might also show up at the
next public hearing and ask why there's still a
premium charged for having touch-tone service.
So, next time the phone company treats you like
so much dirt beneath their feet — there will be a
next time, I guarantee it — don't get mad, get even.
Just reach right out and screw them right back.
