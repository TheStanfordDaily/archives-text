## Harris compares '60s to '80s 
### ALLISON HARTWELL Staff writer 
The ongoing divestment protest
on campus is part of an "informal,
unarticulated tradition" of student
concern about political issues here,
a former Stanford student activist
said last night.
David Harris, a journalist who
was a Stanford student from 1963 to
1967, told an audience of 65 at
Murray House that Stanford pos
sesses its "own unique history" of
student activism, citing the Univer
sity's leading role in the civil rights
and Vietnam protests of the 19605.
Harris was one of the instigators
of an anti-Vietnam organization
which advocated draft violations as
a means of ending the war. He was
also a civil rights field worker in
Mississippi.
"I felt there was a direct connec
tion between what was going on in
Southeast Asia and the draft card in
my back pocket," he said.

Harris cited similarities between
his own experiences with University
administrators and what anti
apartheid demonstrators say they
face today. "The Stanford adminis
tration has always been a slick oper
ator" when dealing with student
demands, he said.
"They (the administrators) have
always been able to work it out so
there doesn't have to be any arrests
in the paper," he added.
Harris said University President
Donald Kennedy "missed the
point" of Tuesday's forum with
members of Stanford Out of South
Africa, who advocate total divest
ment of University investments in
South Africa, and members of the
Stanford Board of Trustees, who fa
vor a selective divestment approach.
"What the hell is the University
doing with holdings in that sort of
a racist situation?" Harris asked.

"The Stanford administration has always been a slick operator"
when dealing with student demands, says David Harris, who spoke at
Murray House last night. Harris, the author of "Dreams Die Hard,"
attended Stanford from 1963 to 1967.
When asked if he had any advice
for today's student protesters, he said
civil disobedience is "very effective"
in promoting change.
Even though the '60s are over,
people should "take what they can
learn from that period" and apply it
to today, he added.

Harris said he feels the lessons of
Vietnam can be seen in the political
atmosphere of today. "The only thing
that has restrained direct intervention
in Nicaragua is the experience of
Vietnam," he said.
"Our current president seems to
have abandoned the notion of col
lective responsibility" he said. Harris
urged individual citizens to "take re
sponsibility for themselves and the
government."

Harris, currently a contributing
editor of The New York Times Maga
zine and author of the book "Dreams
Die Hard/ 1 said the transformation
from activist to journalist was easily
accomplished.
A successful journalist must "learn
to take risks," and Harris said his
prison term — three years in the
Federal Correction Agency in La
Tuna, Texas, for resisting the draft —
taught him that.
