# Pre-med excels despite past illness

### GREG CROSSFIELD 
Harvard, Yale and UC-San Diego
all have medical schools that many
pre-meds would love to attend. These
three and a fistful of others accepted
Amy Saxman, a senior here majoring
in biology.
No big deal, you say? Maybe not,
but Saxman will graduate with well
over a 4.0 grade-point average
despite having spent almost two quar
ters of her sophomore year in and out
of Cowell Health Center and the Palo
Alto Medical Clinic.
"Two weeks into winter quarter of
my sophomore year, I began to have
problems staying awake," she said. "I
would sleep from 12 to 15 hours a
day and still have a hard time staying
awake in class. My most embarrasing
incident was when I fell asleep during
a Bio 40 midterm. There was no time
pressure because it was a three-hour
exam, but it was a little embarrassing."
After six months and a barrage of
tests, it was discovered that Saxman
had a hormonal imbalance; the
byproduct of which was constant
sleepiness. "A lot of people don't like
Cowell, but 1 am really thankful for
all the assistance they provided. They
were constantly refering me to a spe
cialist at the Palo Alto Medical Clinic
who did an excellent job. Cowell even
picked up all by medical expenses,"
she said.
"My roommates used to joke that 1
would take it all in by osmosis. That's

because I would always fall asleep
while studying and still do extremely
well in my classes," she said.
Saxman's performance was pretty
good while awake. Only two Bs ap
pear on a transcript that otherwise
has nothing but As and A-plusses. "I
have always been motivated to work
hard. It fascinates me to see how
things work on the molecular level,"
she said. "The fact that God created
things on that level increases my awe
of Him."
Saxman's "awe of God" stretches
beyond the minute levels she has
studied. She credits her faith for
having helped her when she was sick.
"My relationship with Christ was
really confirmed while I was sick. It
was really lonely sometimes, but I al
ways knew He was there," she said.
And even with a bevy of ac
complishments in science, Saxman
says her accomplishments in religion
are the most important. While in high
school, she started a Bible study
group. "It was really amazing that we
had 60 or 70 people, out of 1,200 stu
dents, that showed up at 7:15 a.m. for
Bible studies," she said.
When asked what she felt was her
most important accomplishment at
Stanford, she said, "I developed a
strong relationship with Jesus Christ,
which placed Him first and foremost
in my life. That brings me even more
satisfaction than my scientific en
deavors."

But Saxman's scientific endeavors
are hardly second rate. She has
picked up a few valuable awards
while at Stanford. Her A-plusses in
the Chemistry 30 series during fresh
man year earned her a scholorship
from Kodak that has paid 75 percent
of her tuition for the last three years.
She was recently published in Prog
ress in Polymer Science for a paper
she did on polymer research conduct
ing during the summer after freshman
year.
Saxman's attitude toward the com
petitive and sometimes grueling grind
of a pre-med is also quite an ac
complishment of sorts. The competi
tion in biology and chemistry classes
tends to lend itself to making students
look over each other's shoulders. But
unlike some of her cohorts, Saxman
competes internally. "I tend to com
pete with myself and not other
people. 1 am always asking myself if 1
am doing the best I can at this, and
not whether I am doing better than
Joe," she said.
Saxman attributes much of her sci
entific interest to parental encourage
ment. "We used to take a lot of na
ture walks in the mountains near our
Albuquerque (N.M.) home," she
said. "My father would take a lot of
time to explain how nature worked
through basic geology. I developed a
curiosity about how science worked,
and the positive feedback I got from
both parents toward education en

couraged me to study hard." Sax
man's parents now reside in Los
Alamos, N.M., where both work at
the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
Saxman developed an interest in
medicine while a sophomore in high
school. "I was pretty good at science,
and I liked to work with people," she
said. "So I decided to become a doc
tor because it is one of the few places
where science and good people-skills
are combined." Saxman finished at
the top of her class of 400. She won a
number of awards for her violin
playing. She also played soccer and
acted as a representative to student
council.
Saxman has also been active in
Christian groups on campus. She is a
member of Stanford Christian Fel
lowship and Asian American Chris
tian Fellowship. Among her other ac
tivities, she teaches Sunday school for
4-year-olds at the Menlo Park Pres
byterian Church. She is a volunteer
for the Hospice Program through The
Mid-Peninsula Health Service, a
group that provides in-home care for
the terminally ill.
Saxman is also putting a lot of time
into wedding preparations. In Au
gust, she will marry fellow senior
Tony Oro. The future Oros will both
attend UC-San Diego. Oro will be
working toward both an M.D. and a
Ph.D., while Saxman will pursue an
M.D.
