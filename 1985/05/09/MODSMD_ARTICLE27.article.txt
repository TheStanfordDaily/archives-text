# Card nine tames Mustangs

The Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
Mustangs didn't figure to be much of
a match for the second-ranked Stan
ford Cardinal yesterday at Sunken
Diamond.
They weren't.
Led by Jeff Ballard's five-hit pitch
ing and Mark Davis' four RBIs, Stan
ford rolled to a 12-0 win, upping its
record to 39-11. Ballard, 11 -2, was in
command all the way, allowing only
one walk while striking out eight.
"I felt really loose, really com
fortable today," Ballard said. "It was
one of those days when you've got a
lot of stuff going for you. Plus, it's al
ways good to have the big lead."
Ballard had the big lead from the
fourth inning on, as the Cardinal of
fense opened up a 10-0 lead after
three innings. It was the eighth time
in the last nine games that Stanford
has scored in double figures.
With one on and two outs in the
second, the Cardinal exploded for
seven consecutive hits against Mus
tang starter Mike Briare. John Ramos
got the hit parade started with a
single to center that scored Mike

Deßenon, who had walked and
stolen second.
After John Verducci's bad-hop
single to left, Pete Stanicek grounded
a hit-and-run single up the middle to
score Ramos. Ruben Amaro then
drove a triple to right-center, making
the score 4-0.
Davis knocked Amaro in with a
single to center, and went to third on
a single to right by Rick Lundblade.
Deßenon got the final hit — an RBI
double down the left-field line.
"It was a high, inside fastball, and I
got my hands over it," Amaro, a
switch-hitter, said of his triple. "It felt
pretty good, and it's about time. I've
had trouble from the right side
lately."
With five errors in the last three
games, Amaro has also had trouble
on defense lately. "A lot of people
have been talking to me about what I
should do," he said. "But it's a men
tal thing, a ridiculous Steve Sax-type
of thing," referring to the throwing
problems of the Los Angeles Dodgers
second baseman last year.
Amaro had no Sax-like difficulties
yesterday, making a brilliant play on
a fifth-inning chopper. Leaping to his

left, Amaro was able to spear the ball
and make a perfect throw across the
diamond. "That'll give me some con
fidence," he said.
The Cardinal continued its
onslaught against Mustang pitching in
the third. Toi Cook singled to right,
bringing John Berringer in for Briare.
After Cook stole second and moved
to third on a Ramos groundout, Ver
ducci scored him with a single to cen
ter.
Walks to Stanicek and Amaro
loaded the bases for Davis, who im
mediately cleared them with a three
run double off the fence in left. "It
was a fastball, inside," Davis said. "It
was 1-0, so I was sort of expecting it."
Davis has been in a mild slump
recently, which has dropped his
average some 30 points to its current
.372. He attributed his problems to
impatience. "I've been swinging at a
lot of balls lately," he said. "I'm a
good hitter when I swing at strikes,
but when I swing at balls, I'm out."
Stanford added two more runs in
the seventh on a sacrifice fly by Ver
ducci and a run-scoring groundout by
Stanicek, but Ballard already had a
lot more than he needed.

"I hud a real good time out there
today," Ballard said, knowing he
wasn't exaetly facing a Murderer's
Row lineup. "Against a team like
[Arizona] State, I wouldn't really
change the way 1 pitch, but I'd he
more intense. There would be a lot
more pressure."
Pressure is something the Cardinal
probably won't have to deal with this
week, with the possible exception of
tomorrow's game at Santa Clara. "It's
hard to pump yourself up for these
games," Davis said. "That's what I'm
trying to do this week."
Stanford will try to continue to
keep itself pumped up today when it
hosts San Francisco State in a 2:30
p.m. contest. Jack McDowell (8-4,
4.81 ERA) will be the Cardinal
starter.
Stanford is still the No. 2 team in
the nation, according to the latest
ESPN/Collegiate Baseball poll. In
stead of Miami, the Cardinal now
trails Texas, which vaulted to the top
of the rankings with 16 straight wins.
Twelve of the victories came in
league play, enabling the Longhorns
to capture the Southwest Conference
title.

Junior linebacker David Wyman received the Irving S. Zeimer
Memorial Trophy as the most valuable player on the 1984 Stanford
football team. Wyman was also named the outstanding junior on the
team. He led Stanford last season with 130 tackles despite missing the
Cal game with a severe knee injury.
