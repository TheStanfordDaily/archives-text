# Leonard's A Life': drama of revelations
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG Editorial staff 
The Irish playwright Hugh
Leonard is a sentimentalist, but he
has a gift for dialogue and for psycho
logical detail. You can see him tug
ging at your emotions, but then sud
denly one of his characters will speak
a line that cuts through all the stock
dramaturgical manipulation to some
thing authentic, shrewdly observed
and illuminating — and you feel,
rightly or not, that he has justified
himself. That's why I can't resolve my
reactions to his play "A Life," first
performed in Dublin in 1979 and cur
rently receiving a production at
Palo Alto's Theatre Works (at the
Burgess Theater in Menlo Park,
through Saturday). A sequel to
Leonard's much-lauded "Da," which
was also set in Dalkey, Ireland (just
south of Dublin), "A Life" comprises
several hours of the day Drumm
(George Ward), an acid-tongued civil
servant in his early 60s, discovers
he has six months to live, as well as
several months in his youth, which he
recalls in an effort to take stock of his
Jife before leaving it.
• The characters in the flashback
scenes parallel those in the present
day narrative: Desmond Drumm
(David Kudler); Mibs (Kate Con
nors), the young woman he courts
and loses, largely through his own
stubbornness, to an amiable ne'er
do-well named Lar Kearns (John
Brady) and Mibs' friend Dorothy

(Alicia Delgado), who has a crush on
Desmond. In the play's present, Mibs
has become Mary (Elise Appleby),
whose volatile, tense friendship with
Drumm, held in a non-speaking
stalemate for six years, is reinstated
and to some degree patched up in the
first act; Dorothy is now Dolly
(Audrey Filippini), Drumm's sweet,
unimaginative and long-suffering
wife; and Kearns (Lee Carrau) is still
Mary's spouse — still endearing and
still insolvent.
Structurally, "A Life" is in the na
ture of a drama of revelations, played
backwards and forwards: We get the
first secret (Drumm's terminal ill
ness) early on, in his first conversa
tion with Mary after their half-dozen
years of mutual silence, and the
second 15 or 20 minutes before the
end. Those revelations place a con
straint on the imaginative expansive
ness of the play, not only because the
first is a platitude and a lachrymose
bid for audience sympathy, and the
second involves a character we
haven't met, but also because a set-up
like this puts us in a vise, too, and we
want to rebel, dismiss all of "A Life"
as maudlin hogwash. It's infuriating,
because Leonard is such a good
writer that he doesn't need this phony
structure — if he trusted his instincts,
and his characters, the play might be
a sort of Chekhovian "Merrily We
Roll Along." But because he's a good
writer, we get caught up in the play
even when his methods are suspect

(or transparent).
The combination of the best ele
ments in his writing and the high
points in the acting — which is cer
tainly variable — makes Theatre-
Works' "A Life" worth
seeing. Robert Kelley's direction is
competent, except for a clumsily
staged fight scene at the end of the
first act, though unimaginative: He
employs Bruce McLeod's set, consist
ing of three distinct playing areas (on
three levels), predictably. (The set,
lighting and costume designers —
McLeod, Geoffrey Eroe and Connie
Strayer — have framed the play
nicely.) There is a virtue in Kelley's
limitations, however; the production
reads clearly from start to finish, and
while solving none of the problems
inherent in Leonard's text — if any
thing, the casting emphasizes them —
at least he adds none of his own.
George Ward gives a witty, self
possessed performance as Drumm.
Sometimes he seems to be the only
actor on the stage, partly because
Elise Appleby and Lee Carrau are
not quite up to their roles — in
Audrey Filippini's case, it may be the
role itself that is at fault; we are evi
dently meant to see charms in Dolly
that Drumm has overlooked, but she
comes across as exasperating. Partly,
though, the imbalance of the present
day sequences derives from the way
Ward's role is written, as a sort of

one-man show. He has a command of
language that no one else can match,
and his amusing battery of insults
comes equipped with its own psycho
logical annotations, so that we can al
ways see what he means when he
makes an insensitive remark or grows
disproportionately angry. Ward
deserves a lot of credit, of course, for
making this double-tracked role
work, and he achieves his effects
without straining for them or wallow
ing in them.
However, the heart of the play is
not in the scenes dominated by the
middle-aged Drumm; it is in the
flashbacks that Hugh Leonard rises to
real heights. In the first scene be
tween Desmond and Mibs, he is
coaching her for a poetry exam; sen
suous and bored, she insists on
talking of other things — sex, prin
cipally — and he is caught between
his attraction to her and his fas
tidiousness, the legacy of his tyranni
cal schoolmaster father, which com
pels him to register shock at her
prurience and to censure her for
neglecting intellectual pursuits. Des
mond is the would-be lover as
reformer; he adores Mibs, but he
can't leave well enough alone. And
while her tough-mindedness responds
to his finer qualities (loyalty, per
severance, integrity and an incisive
intelligence that often enslaves him),
her capacity for enjoying life uncriti
cally draws her to the easy, affec
tionate Lar, whom Desmond regards
as her inferior (and of course his
own). In the end, Leonard views both
Desmond and Mibs fairly. Hearing of
her engagement to Lar, he calls the
first of many truces after the first of

many quarrels by dropping by a wed
ding present — a reproduction of Van
Gogh's "Gauguin's Chair." Lar is
unimpressed by it, but Mibs, in her
stubbornly anti-intellectual fashion,
expresses a fascinated bewilderment
at it that, we recognize, is the begin
ning of a genuine response to art —
and in a flash we see what Desmond
has seen and has been trying to coax
out of her all along, why he wouldn't
let her drop that poem she was study
ing.
It's a small moment but a stunning
one. and there's another to follow.

The combination
of the best ele
ments in Hugh
Leonard's writing
and the high
points in the act
ing makes' A Life'
worth seeing.

Before he departs, Mibs tries to ex
plain to Desmond (in an overwritten
speech) that she chose Lar over him
because while Lar will never satisfy
the part of her that Desmond cares
about, he won't suppress it either;
Desmond would want to claim all of
her and strive to suffocate the part he
doesn't comprehend. This speech is
Mibs' offer of friendship — of the
spark in her that won't belong to Lar
— but Desmond, whose pride and in
ability to compromise will provoke
him all his life to wound those around
him, shuts the door in her face: "I

won't take your leavings," he say*.
These two moments offer, in capsule
form, the entire history of two char
acters.
Needless to say, the flashback
scenes would not be as affecting as
they are in Theatre Works' produc
tion if the roles of Desmond and Mibs
were played by actors less able than
David Kudler and Kate Connors.
(The other two young actors fail to
make much of an impression.) Of
everyone in the show, Connors seems
most convincingly Irish — not just
because she has mastered the brogue
(the accents in this production are as
variable as the performances, but at
their worst they never descend to in
eptitude, like some in the AC Ps
recent "Translations") but also be
cause the resilient, deprecatory
humor Leonard has given the characr
ter fits snugly inside her personality;
she never gives the impression that
she is playing it. It's a spunky, persis-r
tent piece of acting — it trails at ter
you when you leave the theater —-
marked by some unusual line read
ings.
David Kudler, a Stanford actor
who is a talented director as well (he
staged a wonderfully intelligent
"Taming of the Shrew" for Ram's
Head last fall), exposes the private
turmoil beneath Desmond's un
generous emotional reticence — his
decision always to deflect the affec
tions of those who love him. He takes
as the core of his performance the
tension between the character's
stated obstinacy and his subtextual
warmth and sweetness. That's not an
obvious choice, though it is the logical
one, and Kudler accomplishes it with
delicacy, and with readings that are
often beautiful. He and George Ward
match up well: One performance tells
you all you need to know to truly ap
preciate the other.

first act, though unimaginative: He

lighting and costume designers —
McLeod, Geoffrey Eroe and Connie
Strayer — have framed the play

reads clearly from start to finish, and

though, the imbalance of the present

one-man show. He has a command of
language that no one else can match,
and his amusing battery of insults
comes equipped with its own psycho
logical annotations, so that we can al
ways see what he means when he
makes an insensitive remark or grows
disproportionately angry. Ward
deserves a lot of credit, of course, for
making this double-tracked role
work, and he achieves his effects
without straining for them or wallow
ing in them.
However, the heart of the play is
not in the scenes dominated by the
middle-aged Drumm; it is in the
flashbacks that Hugh Leonard rises to
real heights. In the first scene be
tween Desmond and Mibs, he is
coaching her for a poetry exam; sen
suous and bored, she insists on
talking of other things — sex, prin
cipally — and he is caught between
his attraction to her and his fas
tidiousness, the legacy of his tyranni
cal schoolmaster father, which com
pels him to register shock at her
prurience and to censure her for
neglecting intellectual pursuits. Des
mond is the would-be lover as
reformer; he adores Mibs, but he
can't leave well enough alone. And
while her tough-mindedness responds
to his finer qualities (loyalty, per
severance, integrity and an incisive
intelligence that often enslaves him),
her capacity for enjoying life uncriti
cally draws her to the easy, affec
tionate Lar, whom Desmond regards
as her inferior (and of course his
own). In the end, Leonard views both
Desmond and Mibs fairly. Hearing of
her engagement to Lar, he calls the
first of many truces after the first of

many quarrels by dropping by a wed
ding present — a reproduction of Van
Gogh's "Gauguin's Chair." Lar is
unimpressed by it, but Mibs, in her
stubbornly anti-intellectual fashion,
expresses a fascinated bewilderment
at it that, we recognize, is the begin
ning of a genuine response to art —
and in a flash we see what Desmond
has seen and has been trying to coax
out of her all along, why he wouldn't
let her drop that poem she was study
ing.
It's a small moment but a stunning
one. and there's another to follow.

The combination
of the best ele
ments in Hugh
Leonard's writing
and the high
points in the act
ing makes' A Life'
worth seeing.

Before he departs, Mibs tries to ex
plain to Desmond (in an overwritten
speech) that she chose Lar over him
because while Lar will never satisfy
the part of her that Desmond cares
about, he won't suppress it either;
Desmond would want to claim all of
her and strive to suffocate the part he
doesn't comprehend. This speech is
Mibs' offer of friendship — of the
spark in her that won't belong to Lar
— but Desmond, whose pride and in
ability to compromise will provoke
him all his life to wound those around
him, shuts the door in her face: "I

won't take your leavings," he say*.
These two moments offer, in capsule
form, the entire history of two char
acters.
Needless to say, the flashback
scenes would not be as affecting as
they are in Theatre Works' produc
tion if the roles of Desmond and Mibs
were played by actors less able than
David Kudler and Kate Connors.
(The other two young actors fail to
make much of an impression.) Of
everyone in the show, Connors seems
most convincingly Irish — not just
because she has mastered the brogue
(the accents in this production are as
variable as the performances, but at
their worst they never descend to in
eptitude, like some in the AC Ps
recent "Translations") but also be
cause the resilient, deprecatory
humor Leonard has given the characr
ter fits snugly inside her personality;
she never gives the impression that
she is playing it. It's a spunky, persis-r
tent piece of acting — it trails at ter
you when you leave the theater —-
marked by some unusual line read
ings.
David Kudler, a Stanford actor
who is a talented director as well (he
staged a wonderfully intelligent
"Taming of the Shrew" for Ram's
Head last fall), exposes the private
turmoil beneath Desmond's un
generous emotional reticence — his
decision always to deflect the affec
tions of those who love him. He takes
as the core of his performance the
tension between the character's
stated obstinacy and his subtextual
warmth and sweetness. That's not an
obvious choice, though it is the logical
one, and Kudler accomplishes it with
delicacy, and with readings that are
often beautiful. He and George Ward
match up well: One performance tells
you all you need to know to truly ap
preciate the other.


Kate Connors, Alicia Delgado, John Brady and David Kudler star in Hugh Leonard's "A Life."
The Irish playwright Hugh
Leonard is a sentimentalist, but he
has a gift for dialogue and for psycho
logical detail. You can see him tug
ging at your emotions, but then sud
denly one of his characters will speak
a line that cuts through all the stock
dramaturgical manipulation to some
thing authentic, shrewdly observed
and illuminating — and you feel,
rightly or not, that he has justified
himself. That's why I can't resolve my
reactions to his play "A Life," first
performed in Dublin in 1979 and cur
rently receiving a production at
Palo Alto's Theatre Works (at the
Burgess Theater in Menlo Park,
through Saturday). A sequel to
Leonard's much-lauded "Da," which
was also set in Dalkey, Ireland (just
south of Dublin), "A Life" comprises
several hours of the day Drumm
(George Ward), an acid-tongued civil
servant in his early 60s, discovers
he has six months to live, as well as
several months in his youth, which he
recalls in an effort to take stock of his
Jife before leaving it.
• The characters in the flashback
scenes parallel those in the present
day narrative: Desmond Drumm
(David Kudler); Mibs (Kate Con
nors), the young woman he courts
and loses, largely through his own
stubbornness, to an amiable ne'er
do-well named Lar Kearns (John
Brady) and Mibs' friend Dorothy

(Alicia Delgado), who has a crush on
Desmond. In the play's present, Mibs
has become Mary (Elise Appleby),
whose volatile, tense friendship with
Drumm, held in a non-speaking
stalemate for six years, is reinstated
and to some degree patched up in the
first act; Dorothy is now Dolly
(Audrey Filippini), Drumm's sweet,
unimaginative and long-suffering
wife; and Kearns (Lee Carrau) is still
Mary's spouse — still endearing and
still insolvent.
Structurally, "A Life" is in the na
ture of a drama of revelations, played
backwards and forwards: We get the
first secret (Drumm's terminal ill
ness) early on, in his first conversa
tion with Mary after their half-dozen
years of mutual silence, and the
second 15 or 20 minutes before the
end. Those revelations place a con
straint on the imaginative expansive
ness of the play, not only because the
first is a platitude and a lachrymose
bid for audience sympathy, and the
second involves a character we
haven't met, but also because a set-up
like this puts us in a vise, too, and we
want to rebel, dismiss all of "A Life"
as maudlin hogwash. It's infuriating,
because Leonard is such a good
writer that he doesn't need this phony
structure — if he trusted his instincts,
and his characters, the play might be
a sort of Chekhovian "Merrily We
Roll Along." But because he's a good
writer, we get caught up in the play
even when his methods are suspect

(or transparent).

many quarrels by dropping by a wed
ding present — a reproduction of Van
Gogh's "Gauguin's Chair." Lar is
unimpressed by it, but Mibs, in her
stubbornly anti-intellectual fashion,
expresses a fascinated bewilderment
at it that, we recognize, is the begin
ning of a genuine response to art —
and in a flash we see what Desmond
has seen and has been trying to coax
out of her all along, why he wouldn't
let her drop that poem she was study
ing.
It's a small moment but a stunning
one. and there's another to follow.

The combination
of the best ele
ments in Hugh
Leonard's writing
and the high
points in the act
ing makes' A Life'
worth seeing.

Before he departs, Mibs tries to ex
plain to Desmond (in an overwritten
speech) that she chose Lar over him
because while Lar will never satisfy
the part of her that Desmond cares
about, he won't suppress it either;
Desmond would want to claim all of
her and strive to suffocate the part he
doesn't comprehend. This speech is
Mibs' offer of friendship — of the
spark in her that won't belong to Lar
— but Desmond, whose pride and in
ability to compromise will provoke
him all his life to wound those around
him, shuts the door in her face: "I

won't take your leavings," he say*.
These two moments offer, in capsule
form, the entire history of two char
acters.
Needless to say, the flashback
scenes would not be as affecting as
they are in Theatre Works' produc
tion if the roles of Desmond and Mibs
were played by actors less able than
David Kudler and Kate Connors.
(The other two young actors fail to
make much of an impression.) Of
everyone in the show, Connors seems
most convincingly Irish — not just
because she has mastered the brogue
(the accents in this production are as
variable as the performances, but at
their worst they never descend to in
eptitude, like some in the AC Ps
recent "Translations") but also be
cause the resilient, deprecatory
humor Leonard has given the characr
ter fits snugly inside her personality;
she never gives the impression that
she is playing it. It's a spunky, persis-r
tent piece of acting — it trails at ter
you when you leave the theater —-
marked by some unusual line read
ings.
David Kudler, a Stanford actor
who is a talented director as well (he
staged a wonderfully intelligent
"Taming of the Shrew" for Ram's
Head last fall), exposes the private
turmoil beneath Desmond's un
generous emotional reticence — his
decision always to deflect the affec
tions of those who love him. He takes
as the core of his performance the
tension between the character's
stated obstinacy and his subtextual
warmth and sweetness. That's not an
obvious choice, though it is the logical
one, and Kudler accomplishes it with
delicacy, and with readings that are
often beautiful. He and George Ward
match up well: One performance tells
you all you need to know to truly ap
preciate the other.


Kate Connors, Alicia Delgado, John Brady and David Kudler star in Hugh Leonard's "A Life."
