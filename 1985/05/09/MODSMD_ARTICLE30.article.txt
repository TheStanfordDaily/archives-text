# Leonard's A Life': drama of revelations
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG Editorial staff 
The Irish playwright Hugh
Leonard is a sentimentalist, but he
has a gift for dialogue and for psycho
logical detail. You can see him tug
ging at your emotions, but then sud
denly one of his characters will speak
a line that cuts through all the stock
dramaturgical manipulation to some
thing authentic, shrewdly observed
and illuminating — and you feel,
rightly or not, that he has justified
himself. That's why I can't resolve my
reactions to his play "A Life," first
performed in Dublin in 1979 and cur
rently receiving a production at
Palo Alto's Theatre Works (at the
Burgess Theater in Menlo Park,
through Saturday). A sequel to
Leonard's much-lauded "Da," which
was also set in Dalkey, Ireland (just
south of Dublin), "A Life" comprises
several hours of the day Drumm
(George Ward), an acid-tongued civil
servant in his early 60s, discovers
he has six months to live, as well as
several months in his youth, which he
recalls in an effort to take stock of his
Jife before leaving it.
• The characters in the flashback
scenes parallel those in the present
day narrative: Desmond Drumm
(David Kudler); Mibs (Kate Con
nors), the young woman he courts
and loses, largely through his own
stubbornness, to an amiable ne'er
do-well named Lar Kearns (John
Brady) and Mibs' friend Dorothy

(Alicia Delgado), who has a crush on
Desmond. In the play's present, Mibs
has become Mary (Elise Appleby),
whose volatile, tense friendship with
Drumm, held in a non-speaking
stalemate for six years, is reinstated
and to some degree patched up in the
first act; Dorothy is now Dolly
(Audrey Filippini), Drumm's sweet,
unimaginative and long-suffering
wife; and Kearns (Lee Carrau) is still
Mary's spouse — still endearing and
still insolvent.
Structurally, "A Life" is in the na
ture of a drama of revelations, played
backwards and forwards: We get the
first secret (Drumm's terminal ill
ness) early on, in his first conversa
tion with Mary after their half-dozen
years of mutual silence, and the
second 15 or 20 minutes before the
end. Those revelations place a con
straint on the imaginative expansive
ness of the play, not only because the
first is a platitude and a lachrymose
bid for audience sympathy, and the
second involves a character we
haven't met, but also because a set-up
like this puts us in a vise, too, and we
want to rebel, dismiss all of "A Life"
as maudlin hogwash. It's infuriating,
because Leonard is such a good
writer that he doesn't need this phony
structure — if he trusted his instincts,
and his characters, the play might be
a sort of Chekhovian "Merrily We
Roll Along." But because he's a good
writer, we get caught up in the play
even when his methods are suspect

(or transparent).
The combination of the best ele
ments in his writing and the high
points in the acting — which is cer
tainly variable — makes Theatre-
Works' "A Life" worth
seeing. Robert Kelley's direction is
competent, except for a clumsily
staged fight scene at the end of the
first act, though unimaginative: He
employs Bruce McLeod's set, consist
ing of three distinct playing areas (on
three levels), predictably. (The set,
lighting and costume designers —
McLeod, Geoffrey Eroe and Connie
Strayer — have framed the play
nicely.) There is a virtue in Kelley's
limitations, however; the production
reads clearly from start to finish, and
while solving none of the problems
inherent in Leonard's text — if any
thing, the casting emphasizes them —
at least he adds none of his own.
George Ward gives a witty, self
possessed performance as Drumm.
Sometimes he seems to be the only
actor on the stage, partly because
Elise Appleby and Lee Carrau are
not quite up to their roles — in
Audrey Filippini's case, it may be the
role itself that is at fault; we are evi
dently meant to see charms in Dolly
that Drumm has overlooked, but she
comes across as exasperating. Partly,
though, the imbalance of the present
day sequences derives from the way
Ward's role is written, as a sort of


Desmond Drumm (George Ward, center) remembers a scene from his youth. David Kudler (left ) plays young
Desmond and Kate Connors plays Mibs in Theatre Works' production of "A Life." The play runs through
Saturday at the Burgess Theater in Menlo Park.
