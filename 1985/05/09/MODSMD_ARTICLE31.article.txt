Guadalcanal Diary — Walking In
The Shadow Of The Hig Man
★ ★ ★ '/i
This wonderful band probably
didn't have a chance of selling you
its first record — until you started
to read this review. Most shoppers
would be put off by the strange
name, enigmatic cover and lack of
commercial airplay, but you will
know better. This album deserves
your support, but don't expect to
find dance remixes (yawn) or a lot
of tech no-pop sounds inserted to
cover up for lack of talent. Instead,
the band does something that may
be coming back into style now.
They play real instruments, write
unpretentious music and back it
with meaningful but not patently
obvious lyrics. What you get tor
your money is a string of 10 nice,
three-minute, guitar-oriented songs

with no superfluous noise. As with
most popular music shows today,
there is a tendency to capitalize on
any catchy melody a band may hap
pen to write by beating it to death
through repetition. One of the
things which make this record so
enjoyable is that the band knows
when a song should end and has the
confidence to end it and write an
other one. Some of the best songs
are among the shortest, giving the
listener only a taste of one interest
ing melody before moving on to the
next. But, you may ask, what is the
record about: What does it sound
like? Well, I would have to say that
it is about God, the Third World,
war and relationships; it sounds like
four guys from Georgia that you
should keep your ear on.
— Ben Vaughan

Fishbone — Fishbone
33 rpm — ★ ★ ★
45 rpm — ★ ★ ★ '/2
This record is exactly what the
record industry needs: a fun record
with a new style and no real hope of
commercial success. Fishbone come
from Beverly Hills High School,
apparently; they listen to ska, lunk
and Devo; they use Macintosh
graphics on their record covers.
Every song is consistently out of
control and almost too fast to dance
to. One song is funky, one sounds
heavy-metal-ish, one has choral
segments. Even if the songs don't
always come up to "professional"
standards, even if they tend to be a
bit longer than they have to. their
hyperactivity and entertainment
v;ilne make up for it. The six-song

Chick Corea — Voyage ★ ★ ★
Chick Corea is not one of my fa
vorite musicians, although I fre
quently listen to his brilliant "Piano
Improvisations" albums on ECM.
These two albums are brilliant and
diverse spontaneous compositions
recorded in two days in 1971. I al
ways listen to new Chick Corea
records, and old ones that I haven't
heard, to hear music like that, but
only in flashes is his playing so in
spired. When he plays duets with
Herbie Hancock or Gary Burton,
much of the music is at a high level,
but the other albums seem bland in
comparison — especially his fusion
albums, which don't compare to his
earlier work. This new album, duets
with flutist Steve Kujala, again in-

EP runs about 30 spastic minutes in
length at its recommended speed;
however, experimentation at the
KZSU Picks Acoustic Research
Center has revealed that maximum
artistic worth can be attained by
turning your turntable's speed up to
45 rpm. Sorry, prerecorded cassette
fans. (You deserve it anyway.)
"Progressive" rock hasn't been this
fun since the Toy Dolls' debut last
year. (They pass the 45 test, too.
And while we're at it, try side 2 of
Abbey Road and the entire White
Album sometime.) Take our advice
and buy Fishbone — it's spazrock
at its best.
— John Wallin
and Telford Work

eludes some very fine music. But he
is not playing with a Burton or a
Hancock here — and so the music
is lukewarm, pretty, but not filling.
No whole piece consistently grabs
me, often because Corea's accom
paniment to Kujala's soloing is
mostly stiff and unsupportive. But
moments of the Corea genius 'can
be heard. Parts of "Free Fall" and
"Diversions," the two duet im
provisations, are quite splendid. If
you love Chick Corea, get this al
bum. But if you don't know him
well, start somewhere else, perhaps
with "Piano Improvisations" or the
duets with Herbie Hancock. This
one can wait.

"Progressive" rock hasn't been this
fun since the Toy Dolls' debut last
year. (They pass the 45 test, too.
And while we're at it, try side 2 of
Abbey Road and the entire White
Album sometime.) Take our advice
and buy Fishbone — it's spazrock
at its best.

eludes some very fine music. But he
is not playing with a Burton or a
Hancock here — and so the music
is lukewarm, pretty, but not filling.
No whole piece consistently grabs
me, often because Corea's accom
paniment to Kujala's soloing is
mostly stiff and unsupportive. But
moments of the Corea genius 'can
be heard. Parts of "Free Fall" and
"Diversions," the two duet im
provisations, are quite splendid. If
you love Chick Corea, get this al
bum. But if you don't know him
well, start somewhere else, perhaps
with "Piano Improvisations" or the
duets with Herbie Hancock. This
one can wait.
