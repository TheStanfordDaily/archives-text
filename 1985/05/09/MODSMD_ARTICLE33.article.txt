# Media hinder AIDS research
## 
### JOHN GALLON 
A San Francisco doctor argued that
factors other than strictly medical
considerations have stymied efforts to
combat Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome (AIDS), and a San Fran
ciso Chronicle reporter added that
the government was allowed to
ignore the epidemic because the
media "were not on their toes."
The two spoke to about 30 people
at Branner Hall yesterday in a Gay
and Lesbian Awareness Week pro
gram.
Dr. Dennis McShane, a member of
the Stanford Medical School faculty
and the president of Bay Area
Physicians for Human Rights,
charged that the current federal lead
ership "sustains the epidemic."
McShane said that social mores and
hysterical attitudes "not grounded in
absolute fact" and perpetuated by the
media have "debased AIDS from the
realm of disease to politics." He
added that "these viewpoints have
made AIDS a "social and political
phenomenon."
McShane characterized govern
ment action following the initial
AIDS outbreak in 1981 as "too little
too late. . . . The Reagan administra
tion must shoulder responsibility for
the AIDS epidemic." He cited Secre
tary of Health and Human Services
Margaret Heckler's lack of coopera
tion, and the administration's lack of
commitment to substantial funding as
evidence. "AIDS is still stuck behind
the funding eight ball," he said.
Randy Shilts, a reporter who has
followed the AIDS story in San Fran

cisco from the start, gave an account
of the epidemic's evolution.
He agreed with McShane that the
"media did do a poor job early on."
He observed that the early focus was
not on "gay people, heaven forbid,
but on scientists."
"One reason the government was
able to get away with not doing ade
quate research was because the big
papers like The Washington Post and
The New York Times were not on
their toes," Shilts said.
According to Shilts, Anita Bryant's
anti-gay crusade opened the door for

discussion of homosexuality by focus
ing on the issue of human rights.
Similarly, the discussion on AIDS ini
tially received press attention as a
medical curiosity rather than as a
sexual preference issue.
McShane observed that his
"profession has contributed to the
politicization of the disease," and
pointed to cultural factors which have
inhibited an aggressive response to
the problem of AIDS. "Current con
servatism contributes to the feeling
that these groups (gays, Haitians,
drug abusers) with AIDS 'deserve
what they get.'

attract students at A Majors Event in the Inner Quad yesterday. Other departments also offered infor
