# In spite of exams, nationwide protest goes on
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
Although the novelty of sit-ins and arrests
has dwindled and exams are imminent, stu
dents involved in the anti-apartheid move
ment are still continuing their protests and
demonstrations at universities across the
country.
Students at Columbia, UC-Berkeley, UC-
Santa Cruz, Cornell, Rutgers and the Univer
sity of Wisconsin-Madison — organizers of last
month's National Day of Strike and Protest —
refuse to give up their quest for the total
divestment of their universities' stock in com
panies which do business in South Africa.
Rutgers students are planning to camp out
tonight in honor of the 28th day of their
protest, according to Rutgers Daily Targon
reporter Kelly-Jame Cotter. As many as
1,000 students from as far away as UC-Santa
Cruz, UC-Berkeley, lowa, Dartmouth, Yale,
Princeton, Cornell and elsewhere have been

invited to participate, she said.
Tomorrow morning, students at Rutgers
will be wearing black to show their dissatisfac
tion with the Rutgers Board of Governors'
refusal to put total divestment on the agenda
for its meeting tomorrow. Students plan to
march into the meeting and demand that
divestment be discussed.
Cotter said that although the demonstra
tion "dwindles" during the day, "at night it
perks up" to around 150 people.
The momentum at UC-Santa Cruz is
"not dying out but getting stronger," accord
ing to Santa Cruz freshman Sandra Meadow,
a member of the Student Divestment and
Anti-Apartheid Coalition (SDAAC).
Students at Santa Cruz have initiated a
nationwide boycott of all Coca-Cola products
to protest the company's operations in South
Africa, Meadow said.
Coca-Cola is "very visible" and "will be

monitoring [its] sales very closely," especially
in light of its new publicity campaign, she said.
In a speech to the United Nations Tuesday,
Santa Cruz studentlTNancy Netherland and
Mark Durham talked about the student anti
apartheid movement. While in New York,
Netherland and Durham established contacts
with other students by phone and computer to
"strengthen the national network" of anti
apartheid protesters, Meadow said.
Netherland also spoke at a protest during a
board of trustees meeting at Columbia. Ap
proximately 250 people attended the rally,
according to Jeff Craig, news editor of The
Columbia Daily Spectator.
Although "nothing is really going on (at
Columbia) because of finals," a silent protest
for commencement is in the planning, Craig
said.
At UC-Berkeley, the "sit-in is still there,
but barely," said Daily Californian City
Editor Will Miner. Most groups pulled out

Monday, but not before a total of 500 arrests,
Miner added.
Members of the Gray Panthers were ar
rested Monday, members of the Board of
Commissions Tuesday, and members of the
school board yesterday, he said.
It has been rumored that South African
Bishop Desmond Tutu will speak at Berkeley
Monday, Miner said. Tutu is also expected to
speak at UC-Davis Monday, according to Et
han Watters, managing editor of the Davis
Aggie.
Miner added that "burn out," lack of
"imminent danger" and the recent lack of
university reaction to the Berkeley sit-in has
"led to it dwindling." However, with the arri
val of Tutu, "everybody is predicting there
will be action again."
Students at the University of Wisconsin-
Madison ended their occupation of the capitol
yesterday, according to Carolyn Helmke, a
representative of the Wisconsin Student As

sociation, the group which initiated the sit-in
in Madison. Because the university has
already divested, students have centered their
energies around lobbying lor state legislation.
Although classes at Wisconsin are almost
finished for the year, students protesters will
be planning and working all summer and into
the fall, Helmke said.
Two Harvard students have accused Har
vard of wiretapping their phones to obtain in
formation about apartheid protests. The Har
vard Crimson reported yesterday. The stu
dents used the phones to plan a fake take
over of the office of the Harvard Magazine,
an "obscure" building "on the fringe of
campus," according to reporter Kristin Goss.
The police showed up soon after the students'
telephone conversation, she said.
Goss said university officials said the take
over was brought to their attention by an
anonymous phone call, but that
details are still vague.
On May 2, when a South African
diplomat spoke to the Conservative
Club at Harvard, activists tried to
prevent him from speaking. Allega
tions that the police used unnecessary
force are under investigation, Goss
said.
It has been a constant "give and
take" between the administration and
the students, she said. As finals ap
proach, the administration is hoping
the attitude on campus will change,
although some students are saying
they will "sacrifice their academic
careers" for the cause, she said.

Students at Cornell held a rally yes
terday in front of the main student
union, said Cornell Daily Sun
reporter Leslie Postal. Students tied
the main gate together with red arm
bands, Postal said.
Around 1,000 arrests have been
made thus far at Cornell, although
none have been made this week. The
enthusiasm for being arrested has
stopped, but not the overall momen
tum, Postal said.
She added that today is the last day
of classes at Cornell, but that the
issue of divestment is expected to
resurface at graduation.
UC-Santa Cruz students, who are
still weeks away from finals, are pre
paring for the monthly UC Board of
Regents meetings in Berkeley May
17 and in San Francisco in late June.
The meeting in San Francisco was

originally intended to be held at UC-
Santa Cruz, but was moved when
regents "recognized the power of the
movement (at Santa Cruz)," Meadow
said. "We could easily have gotten
10,000 people," she added.
UC spokesmen have countered
that UC-Santa Cruz is somewhat in
accessible for people wishing to make
their views known to the regents.
Santa Cruz students are also con
cerned about the May meeting, be
cause students will be given 15
minutes to express their views, while
non-students will be allowed one
hour and 45 minutes, Meadow said.
At the meeting, students will be ask
ing for total divestment, equal time to
express their views and amnesty for
students arrested at UC-Berkeley,
she said.

sity of Wisconsin-Madison — organizers of last
month's National Day of Strike and Protest —
refuse to give up their quest for the total
divestment of their universities' stock in com
panies which do business in South Africa.
Rutgers students are planning to camp out
tonight in honor of the 28th day of their
protest, according to Rutgers Daily Targon
reporter Kelly-Jame Cotter. As many as
1,000 students from as far away as UC-Santa
Cruz, UC-Berkeley, lowa, Dartmouth, Yale,
Princeton, Cornell and elsewhere have been

invited to participate, she said.
Tomorrow morning, students at Rutgers
will be wearing black to show their dissatisfac
tion with the Rutgers Board of Governors'
refusal to put total divestment on the agenda
for its meeting tomorrow. Students plan to
march into the meeting and demand that
divestment be discussed.
Cotter said that although the demonstra
tion "dwindles" during the day, "at night it
perks up" to around 150 people.
The momentum at UC-Santa Cruz is
"not dying out but getting stronger," accord
ing to Santa Cruz freshman Sandra Meadow,
a member of the Student Divestment and
Anti-Apartheid Coalition (SDAAC).
Students at Santa Cruz have initiated a
nationwide boycott of all Coca-Cola products
to protest the company's operations in South
Africa, Meadow said.
Coca-Cola is "very visible" and "will be

monitoring [its] sales very closely," especially
in light of its new publicity campaign, she said.
In a speech to the United Nations Tuesday,
Santa Cruz studentlTNancy Netherland and
Mark Durham talked about the student anti
apartheid movement. While in New York,
Netherland and Durham established contacts
with other students by phone and computer to
"strengthen the national network" of anti
apartheid protesters, Meadow said.
Netherland also spoke at a protest during a
board of trustees meeting at Columbia. Ap
proximately 250 people attended the rally,
according to Jeff Craig, news editor of The
Columbia Daily Spectator.
Although "nothing is really going on (at
Columbia) because of finals," a silent protest
for commencement is in the planning, Craig
said.
At UC-Berkeley, the "sit-in is still there,
but barely," said Daily Californian City
Editor Will Miner. Most groups pulled out

Monday, but not before a total of 500 arrests,
Miner added.
Members of the Gray Panthers were ar
rested Monday, members of the Board of
Commissions Tuesday, and members of the
school board yesterday, he said.
It has been rumored that South African
Bishop Desmond Tutu will speak at Berkeley
Monday, Miner said. Tutu is also expected to
speak at UC-Davis Monday, according to Et
han Watters, managing editor of the Davis
Aggie.
Miner added that "burn out," lack of
"imminent danger" and the recent lack of
university reaction to the Berkeley sit-in has
"led to it dwindling." However, with the arri
val of Tutu, "everybody is predicting there
will be action again."
Students at the University of Wisconsin-
Madison ended their occupation of the capitol
yesterday, according to Carolyn Helmke, a
representative of the Wisconsin Student As

sociation, the group which initiated the sit-in
in Madison. Because the university has
already divested, students have centered their
energies around lobbying lor state legislation.
Although classes at Wisconsin are almost
finished for the year, students protesters will
be planning and working all summer and into
the fall, Helmke said.
Two Harvard students have accused Har
vard of wiretapping their phones to obtain in
formation about apartheid protests. The Har
vard Crimson reported yesterday. The stu
dents used the phones to plan a fake take
over of the office of the Harvard Magazine,
an "obscure" building "on the fringe of
campus," according to reporter Kristin Goss.
The police showed up soon after the students'
telephone conversation, she said.
Goss said university officials said the take
over was brought to their attention by an
anonymous phone call, but that
details are still vague.
On May 2, when a South African
diplomat spoke to the Conservative
Club at Harvard, activists tried to
prevent him from speaking. Allega
tions that the police used unnecessary
force are under investigation, Goss
said.
It has been a constant "give and
take" between the administration and
the students, she said. As finals ap
proach, the administration is hoping
the attitude on campus will change,
although some students are saying
they will "sacrifice their academic
careers" for the cause, she said.

Students at Cornell held a rally yes
terday in front of the main student
union, said Cornell Daily Sun
reporter Leslie Postal. Students tied
the main gate together with red arm
bands, Postal said.
Around 1,000 arrests have been
made thus far at Cornell, although
none have been made this week. The
enthusiasm for being arrested has
stopped, but not the overall momen
tum, Postal said.
She added that today is the last day
of classes at Cornell, but that the
issue of divestment is expected to
resurface at graduation.
UC-Santa Cruz students, who are
still weeks away from finals, are pre
paring for the monthly UC Board of
Regents meetings in Berkeley May
17 and in San Francisco in late June.
The meeting in San Francisco was

originally intended to be held at UC-
Santa Cruz, but was moved when
regents "recognized the power of the
movement (at Santa Cruz)," Meadow
said. "We could easily have gotten
10,000 people," she added.
UC spokesmen have countered
that UC-Santa Cruz is somewhat in
accessible for people wishing to make
their views known to the regents.
Santa Cruz students are also con
cerned about the May meeting, be
cause students will be given 15
minutes to express their views, while
non-students will be allowed one
hour and 45 minutes, Meadow said.
At the meeting, students will be ask
ing for total divestment, equal time to
express their views and amnesty for
students arrested at UC-Berkeley,
she said.
Although the novelty of sit-ins and arrests
has dwindled and exams are imminent, stu
dents involved in the anti-apartheid move
ment are still continuing their protests and
demonstrations at universities across the
country.
