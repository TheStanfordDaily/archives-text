# Questions remain in Halothane case
## 
### JOYA WESLEY Staff writer 
An anesthesia that authorities
say killed a Stanford freshman last
month is still available at the labo
ratory where he worked, and stu
dents continue to have access to a
variety of other potentially dan
gerous chemicals at campus labo
ratories.
Whether Michael Bandy, who
was found dead in his dormitory
room on April 1, obtained the
Halothane that killed him from
the Stanford laboratory at which
he worked is still unclear. But one
neuropsychology laboratory em
ployee told The Daily that he
believes some Halothane is mis
sing from that laboratory.
The employee, who spoke on
the condition he not be named,
also expressed concern over the
manner in which dangerous
chemicals are controlled here.
However, another source in the
department said no shortage of
Halothane has been found there.
The source, who also asked not to
named, noted that as a
veterinarian. Bandy's mother
probably maintained a supply of
Halothane to which her son might
have had access.
Halothane can be used as a
recreational drug, experts said.
But the suspicion that students ob
tain raw chemicals from Stanford
laboratories to make recreational
drugs is unfounded, according to
students contacted by The Daily
who work in laboratories here.
The biochemistry laboratory at
the medical school has chemicals
available to graduate students who
know the proper uses, according
to Laboratory Manager Wayne
Chapman.
Anyone "without a mature out

look" and with enough creativity
can, with forged approval, gain
access to practically anything in
the laboratory, Chapman said.
However, abuse has not been a
problem, and there is general trust
in student discretion, he said.
This trust also exists in the
chemistry laboratories here.
Sophomore Jamil Jacobs-El
said that although the raw materi
als are available and the processes
for making drugs are common
knowledge, the time and experi
ence necessary to make recrea
tional drugs properly are a deter
rent.
"They showed us on the board
how to make cocaine," said
Jacobs-El. However, one would
have to be especially careful and
meticulous in order to make it cor
rectly, he added.
All University laboratories, in
cluding those at Stanford Medical
School, are subject to U.S. De
partment of Agriculture (USDA)
regulations on the accessibility of
potentially harmful chemicals.
The USDA regulations, accord
ing to Nora Weldon, a clinical
veterinarian in the Laboratory
Animal Medicine Department
here, vary from substance to sub
stance.
"Some must be locked up, some
must be out of reach, and some arc
not allowed except for specific re
search. such as marijuana and
heroin," Weldon said.
Halothane, she continued, is not
considered especially dangerous
and is not subject to strict control.
However. Weldon said that stu
dents never have access to it in her
department.
