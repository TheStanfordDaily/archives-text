# Activists tell of gay politics

### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Staff writer 
Government attempts to control homosexual im
migration, the battle for more AIDS funding and a
possible conservative swing of the federal courts all
pose a "challenge and a threat" to the gains
homosexuals have made in recent years, a
prominent gay activist said here last night.
Pat Norman, coordinator of gay and lesbian
health resources for San Francisco, told an audi
ence of about 100 gathered in History Corner that
problems confronting the gay and lesbian commun
ities are real and threatening. She was joined in the
discussion by Harry Britt, a member of the San
Francisco Board of Supervisors, who disagreed that
a "conservative trend to the right" is necessarily
thwarting the gay community's efforts.
Britt stressed that "all of the significant things
that deny diversity are very visible and very power
ful, but they are a sign of reaction." He said the
dynamics of political involvement by gays parallel
the process other groups have faced as they entered

"mainstream society."
"Politically, I think it parallels the structure of
other marginal political movements in the country
â€” the movement from the closet to the ghetto, to
the margin of politics, and then into the main
stream," Britt said.
Britt added that the "gay ghettos" of San Fran
cisco and other communities developed the original
"source of power" for gays to enter political life.
"The beginning of politics as an effective means
(of change) comes when we take our ghetto experi
ence and move out," he said, "and when we act as
if we have power when we know damn well we
don't."
Norman said that on the federal level, "the
Reagan administration is appointing conservative
judges to the bench who will probably be able to
take back what has been gained. If that happens,
we are in deep trouble."
"Right now, we are suffering from an increase in

violence against us," Norman said,
attributing this rise to "misdirected
energies" in reaction to the epidemic
of Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome (AIDS).
"Basically, that (violence) comes
from the New Right and the religious
right claiming that this disease is
caused by God because he is
'punishing' us for our sins of
homosexuality," she said.
Norman added that the govern

ment has underfunded AIDS re
search, calling it an "abomination."
Both Britt and Norman said that
conquering homophobia must be a
top priority if gays are to gain politi
cal and social acceptance.
"Its really quite simple," Norman
said. "We must work on ourselves so
we are no longer afraid of participat
ing in the outside world."
Britt concurred. "We realize that
the only way we are going to get rid of
homophobia is by instructing and
teaching. They don't know how to
deal with us yet, but if we play our
game right, we might convince them

that they better learn."
Britt added that public unwilling
ness to accept gays is not much differ
ent than the gay community's reluc
tance to "come out of the closet."
"We are asking mainstream
America to take the same kinds of
risks that we ourselves were afraid to
take," Britt said. "1 have a lot of faith
in straight people learning how to
deal with us."
"The most deadly homophobia is
the one we feel ourselves, the one
that blocks our actions," Norman
said. "If we don't work, we only have
ourselves to blame."
