# Budget cuts hurt disease research
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
While Congress currently debates
budget cuts in Washington, a Stan
ford Medical School professor is one
of several University researchers
already feeling the effects of reduced
federal aid for their projects.
Dr. Paul Basch. a parasitoligist and
professor of family, community and
preventive medicine, said he has suf
fered a total loss of federal support
for his research. He is now trying to
continue his work at a minimal level.
Basch is investigating schis
tosomiasis, a disease that affects more
than 200 million people in developing
countries worldwide.
According to a Washington
spokesman for Rep. Ed Zschau
(R-Sunnyvale). Basch is one of
"hundreds of people at Stanford"
who have contacted the congress
man's office after losing federal re
search grants as a result of recent
budget cuts by the Reagan adminis
tration.

A spokeswoman for Sen. Alan
Cranston (D-Calif.) said, "A lot of
researchers were originally told that if
their priority was good enough, they
would likely be funded." She added
that Reagan's action was "totally
against congressional intent" and a
violation of a bill enacted into law in
October 1984 calling for federal
funding of 6,500 research projects.
Basch lost his funding in February,
following a decision by the Reagan
administration to cut the number of
research projects funded by the Na
tional Institutes of Health (NIH)
from 6,500 to 5,000. Before the cuts,
Basch received between $142,000
and $159,000 in grants.
To decide which research projects
will receive federal grants, a 20-
member panel of NIH scientists as
signs a rating to each project, then
provides money only for research that
falls above a certain cut-off point.
Basch is confident his research
would have received funding if the

government had not raised the cut-off
point.
"I was quite confident that my
priority score would fall within the
pay-line, but, when the pay-line was
reduced, my project was dropped,"
he said.
"The ranking he received this time
in years past would have been suffici
ent for funding," said Elwood Pierce,
director of operations at the medical
school.
According to Basch, federal grants
for research in his area of the NIH —
the Tropical Medicine and Parasitol
ogy Section — are extremely compet
itive. In an October 1984 review of
research projects, nine out of 89 proj
ects received grants, while in
February, when Basch's project was
dropped, nine out of 94 were success
ful.
Basch is hopeful his funding will be
restored by fall, but added, "nobody
seems optimistic."
However, the Zschau spokes
man said that on Monday, the Senate

voted to increase the number of re
search programs receiving federal
grants from 5,000 to 6,000.
The current situation in Washing
ton is "extremely fluid and changing
day by day as [politicians] debate the is
sue," the spokesman said, adding that "it
may change more tomorrow or the
next day."
While Basch waits to find out if he
will receive new funding, he is con
tinuing his research at a greatly
reduced level.
"A small amount of funding" from
other sources allows Basch to keep
one part-time technician and "to
keep things alive." he said. When his
grant was lost, he was forced to lire
the rest of his laboratory staff, he
said.
Basch worries that even if he does
eventually receive renewed aid. his
research will be lost.
"There is a living thing and once it's
gone, it's gone," he said. "There will
