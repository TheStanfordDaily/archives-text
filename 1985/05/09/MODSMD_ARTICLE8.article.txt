Cease-fire takes hold in Lebanon
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Christian and Moslem militiamen fought a
string of gunbattles in downtown Beirut yesterday, but a cease-fire ap
peared to be taking hold after 11 days of fighting.
Police reported three militiamen and a civilian were wounded yester
day. Since April 28, 77 people, mostly civilians, have been killed and
400 wounded, police said. "lTiirty eight of those killed were slain Tuesday
in the heaviest shelling in Beirut in nearly a year.
The cease-fire was shattered hours after it was declared at sundown
Tuesday. Artillery and gun battles broke out during the night, but
tapered off yesterday into exchanges of machine-gun and rifle fire.
The relative lull gave civilians who have been huddling in basements
and bomb shelters a chance to get out to buy food. But the streets on
both sides of the Green Line remained virtually deserted.
President Amin Gemayel met with government leaders and army
commanders in an attempt to cement the cease-fire, the 29th announced
since heavy sectarian fighting broke out in the capital last month.
Prime Minister Rashid Karami, a Moslem, told reporters after talking
with Gemayel that he had "great hope" stability could be restored to the
capital. "It is the duty of all of us to help in bringing about the disman
tling of the demarcation line, the reopening of crossings and the
withdrawal of armed elements," he said.
Gemayel, under mounting pressure from Syria to end the bloodshed,
has seen his authority undermined as militias ignored his efforts to halt
the fighting.
With Kara mi's government split along sectarian lines, there was little
sign any of the militias were ready to pull back.
The Voice of Lebanon radio reported that Moslem gunmen moved
into the Argentine Embassy on the Green Line and set up firing posi
tions and an observation post.
Reagan: Crisis centers possible?
WASHINGTON — A nuclear crisis expert believes proposals Presi
dent Reagan outlined to the European Parliament on reducing the
chance of accidental war may be a prelude to advocating creation of
U.S.-Soviet crisis centers.
"I think he's testing the waters," said William Ury, director of a Har
vard Law School nuclear negotiation project and author of a book that
urges the establishment of full-fledged crisis centers to prevent war by
error.
In the view of Ury and other proponents of crisis management, twin
crisis centers should be set up in Washington and Moscow, each staffed
with Soviets and Americans.
Working side by side, these military and diplomatic employees would
become so familiar with each other and each nation's operating
procedures that they would be able to work together during crises to
avert war by miscalculation.
The centers should be linked by giant video screens and operate under
set emergency safety procedures, according to Ury.
Brazil to have direct elections
BRASILIA, Brazil — Congress yesterday gave overwhelming initial
approval to a bill reinstating direct presidential elections, responding to
a demand by the public that had been denied during the military's 21
years in power.
Brazilians last elected a president by popular vote in 1960. The mili
tary took power in 1964 and gave way to a civilian government this year.
The constitutional amendment, which does not set a date for the presi
dential elections, was subject to two sets of votes before becoming law. It
passed in the House ot Representatives 458-0 on the first vote, while the
Senate approved it with 62 of a possible 69 votes.
Before returning to the direct presidential vote for a second balloting.
Congress voted on measures that would allow illiterates to vote, enable
clandestine communist parties to become legal, and mandate direct elec
tions this November for mayors of state capitals.
The presidential election measure was introduced Tuesday night by
President Jose Sarney and rushed onto the agenda for a vote.
He said he planned to step down in four years, but would leave that
decision as well as a date for elections, to a constitutional assembly to be
set up in 1986. The current constitution gives the president a six-year
term.
Millions of Brazilians last year staged mass demonstrations from the
steamy Amazon to the industrialized south to demand the right to vote
for president. They wore T-shirts with slogans and chanted: "Direct
Elections now."
11 dead in South African violence
JOHANNESBURG. South Africa — Migrant workers and residents
of a black township battled with hatchets, knives and stones on a 24-
hour rampage that left 11 blacks dead, authorities said yesterday.
Police fired rubber bullets and tear gas to restore order, and
roadblocks scaled off the township.
The fighting in Tsakanc township east of Johannesburg pitted migrant
men, enraged by the burning of their beer hall, against permanent resi
dents of the township, witnesses said. The township was described as
quiet late yesterday after the estimated 1,800 migrant workers were es
corted out of the township by a dozen armored vehicles.
Streets were littered with glass from windows smashed in hundreds of
homes during the fighting that started Tuesday night and ended yester
day.
Elsewhere, police reported rioting in several black townships, mainly
m the eastern Cape province, and controversy raged over the death of a
prominent trade union activist of head injuries soon after his release
from police detention.
Police described the Tsakane battle as a fight among tribal factions,
saying most of those killed were from the Xhosa tribe based in the south
of the country.
But residents said the fighting broke out over the migrants' anger at
local youths who burned their beer hall to protest white rule. Beer halls,
which provide revenue for the white-government's local black councils,
have been frequent targets for rioters in recent months.
Charles Marx, chief director of black affairs for the eastern Johannes
burg region, said there were 1,800 migrants living in hostels and 45,000
permanent residents of Tsakanc, 14 miles east of Johannesburg.
In the eastern Cape province, policc supported by army units moved
into two black townships outside I'ort Elizabeth. The sweep appeared to
be similar to one staged Sunday in nearby Kwanobuhle township, where
police said they hunted agitators in a show of force involving more than
1,000 police anil soldiers.
In Cape Town, white opposition legislator I lelcn Suzman called for an
inquiry into the death of Andries Raditscla, a Chemical and Industrial
Workers Union official.
The 29-year-old black man was picked up at his home in Tsakane on
Saturday, assaulted and dragged into an armored vehicle, union official
Rod Crompton said. His family saw him three hours later lying on the
floor ol a government building being used by police, Crompton said. The
family located him Monday at a black hospital, where he died of head in
juries later in the day.
