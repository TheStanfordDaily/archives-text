# Third of audience walks out or boos
## Reagan attacks Soviet policies 
### 
STRASBOURG, France — As a third of
Europe's parliament waved protest signs, heckled
or walked out. President Reagan yesterday accused
the Soviets of trying to "spread their dominance by
force" and argued his "Star Wars" program offers
the best promise of perpetuating the 40 years of
peace since V-E Day.
Addressing officials from 10 allied nations,
Reagan strongly warned the West not to be com
placent about the Kremlin's military intentions.
Reagan complained that Moscow is developing a
dangerous new multi-warhead mobile missile,
known in the West as the SS-X-24, that could not
be monitored for arms control.
"The Soviet Union is undermining stability and
the basis for mutual deterrence." Reagan said. "It
has chosen ... to build nuclear forces clearly de
signed to strike first, and thus to disarm their ad
versary."
But he said his Star Wars plan, which is formerly
known as the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI),
offers a way to resolve the East-West nuclear
deadlock. SDI, which was unveiled in 1983, is
aimed at developing an anti-ballistic missile
defense.
"The state of modern technology may soon make
possible for the first time the ability to use non
nuclear systems to defeat ballistic missiles,"
Reagan said.
He also renewed proposals to reduce military
tensions by, among other steps, setting up a
military-to-military communications link sup
plementing the Washington-Moscow hotline.
When Reagan criticized the Soviet Union, about
30 deputies, most from the British Labor party.

walked out of the assembly. Reagan smiled and
said. "You know, I've learned something useful.
Maybe if 1 talk long enough in my own Congress,
some of those will walk out." The remaining audi
ence applauded loudly.
About a third of the deputies either joined the
walkout, sat silent with arms folded or waved
brightly colored signs with slogans, such as "Hands
Oft Nicaragua," "Star Wars, No" and "Nuclear
Freeze Now."
At lirst, Reagan had ignored the protests, but
when a chorus of boos greeted his declaration that
there were "Soviet efforts to profit from and stim
ulate regional conflicts in Central America,"the
president grimaced, paused and interjected, "They
haven't been there. 1 have."
In closing, Reagan tacked on this rejoinder:
"We've seen evidence here of your faith in
democracy, in the ability of some to speak up feeely
as they preferred to speak. And yet I can't help but
remind all of us that some who take advantage of
that right of democracy seem unaware that if the
government that they would advocate became
reality, no one would have that freedom to speak
up again."
Alter tour hours in France, Reagan Hew to Lis
bon, Portugal, the final stop of his 10-day tour of
Europe that began in West Germany with a seven
nation economic summit meeting. He returns to
Washington tomorrow.
Nowhere in his speech did Reagan mention that
during World War II the Soviet Union was an ally
ol the United States and saw 20 million of its
people lose their lives in the struggle against the
Nazis.

Reagan hailed the end of that struggle 40 years
ago and the resulting "peace that has become the
longest of this century."
"Ultimately, I hope the leaders of the Soviet
Union will come to understand that they have
nothing to gain from attempts to achieve military
superiority or to spread their dominance by force,
but have much to gain from joining the West in
mutual arms reduction and expanding coopera
tion."
The traveling White House, meanwhile, released
the text of a letter from Reagan to Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev calling the anniversary "an oc
casion for both our countries to remember the
sacrifice of those men and women everywhere who
gave the last full measure of devotion to the cause
of fighting tyranny."
He expressed hope that the two superpowers
would rededicate themselves to the job of over
coming differences and working toward nuclear
arms control.
In Moscow, Tass, the Soviet news agency,
released Gorbachev's response saying that the most
important lesson of the war "is that a responsible
approach to preserving peace and strengthening in
ternational security is required from all states and
their leaders" and saying his country is prepared to
cooperate in order to prevent nuclear war and to
eliminate nuclear weapons.
On Reagan's plane during the flight to Lisbon, a
senior official, refusing to be identified by name,
said Reagan would meet Gorbachev if the Soviet
leader attends the United Nations session in New
York City this fall.
