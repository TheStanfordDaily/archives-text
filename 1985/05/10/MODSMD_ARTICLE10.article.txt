LOS ANGELES — Cheered by
some 3,000 university students.
South African Bishop Desmond
Tutu yesterday thanked
Americans who have demon
strated their opposition to his
country's segregationist policy of
apartheid.
"It isn't too often that I can say
without being presumptuous that I
speak for millions. . .. But I do
speak for millions who would have
wished to have come here and ex
press to you their very profound
gratitude to you for all you have
done and continue to do in the
struggle for justice and peace in
our very sad but beautiful land."
the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize win
ner said.
"Don't let anyone delude you
into thinking that what you do
here is of little moment," the 53-
year-old Tutu told the gathering at
Pauley Pavilion at UCLA.
He said student protests calling
for divestiture were significant. He
noted that, in an unprecedented
move, the South African govern
ment has appointed a diplomat to
Washington, D.C., whose sole
purpose is to deal with the calls for
American companies to divest
themselves of ties to South Africa.

"Know that it gives encourage
ment to the victims and the people
who struggle for change." Tutu
said, calling the South African
government "one of the most vi
cious systems since Nazism and
communism."
Frequently interrupted by ap
plause and cheers. Tutu said: "We
say to purveyors of apartheid,
'Hey. We "are being nice to you.
Come joining the winning side.'
"There is absolutely no doubt at
all that we shall be free. ... For
goodness sake, we want it to hap
pen now. and we want it to happen
peacefully and we want it to hap
pen to all of us in South Africa,
black and white," Tutu exclaimed,
his hands spread wide as the crowd
drowned him out with cheers and
applause.
Asked if divestment of foreign
funds from South Africa wou\drf\
hurt black workers, he said: "I
would much rather that I would be
in control of my destiny than that 1
would live in clover."
South Africa has 5 million
whites and 22 million blacks.
Tutu said he and his wife Leah
traveled to the United States to at
tend the graduation of their
daughter Naomi at the University
of Kentucky.
