Schroeder improving
LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Artificial heart patient
William Schroeder's body is absorbing blood that
washed over his brain tissue, causing a stroke, but
more tests are needed to give doctors a better
idea of his condition, a hospital spokeswoman

CAT scan X-rays, which showed bleeding in the
brain Monday and no new bleeding Tuesday.
The cause and source of the bleeding has not
yet been determined, Humana Hospital
Audubon spokeswoman Donna Hazle said after
speaking with implant surgeon William DeVries.

of the country.

AIDS cases top 10,000
ATLANTA — The number of AIDS cases in
the United States has topped the 10.000 mark,
with nearly half the patients dead and the case
count expected to double in the next year, the na

terday.
The CDC said 10,050 cases of acquired
immune deficiency syndrome have been reported
in this country. Forty-nine percent of the victims,
or 4,963, have died.
The number of AIDS victims contracting the
disease through blood transfusions has increased
from 0.9 percent before May 1983 to 1.6 percent
of all cases.
"That's close to doubling," said Dr. Harold

Jaffe of the agency's AIDS task force. "It still ac
counts for only a tiny proportion, but in that con
text. it's increased significantly."
Contras doubt claims
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administra
tion and Nicaraguan rebels tried Wednesday to
cast doubt on a former rebel commander's al
legation that U.S.-backed Contra forces
routinely commit atrocities.
Bosco Matamoros. spokesman for the U.S.-
backed Nicaraguan Democratic Force, the chief
rebel group known by the initials FDN. dismissed
the new charges as "outright lies" and "a clear
part of a campaign carried out by the Sandinis
tas " Nicaragua's leftist rulers.
Deputy State Department spokesman Edward
Djerejian said the administration has seen "no
information which would substantiate the specific
charges, while adding that it condemns "all acts
of terror and violence directed against civilians."
Stocks soar
Stock prices rang up their biggest advance in
more than two weeks yesterday, rebounding
from a modest setback in the previous session.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
down 2.98 Wednesday, climbed 10.49 to

12.15-point jump on April 23.
