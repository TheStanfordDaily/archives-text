## Popular aerobics improve fitness level of students 
### KEVIN SHORT 
"Keep breathing! Land smoothly
from toe to heel!"
The exhortations mingle with the
theme music from "Cats' ringing out
across White Plaza.
"Now take it up! Up! Up!"
Inside the Old Union Clubhouse,
closely packed bodies exude sweat as
they twist and gyrate to the beat, fol
lowing the instructor's commands.
The scene is repeated morning, noon
and evening here and at other spots
throughout campus. Aerobic dancing
has become a popular form of physi
cal training and recreation for Stan
ford students and staff.
To many people, the word
"aerobics" is synonomous with
aerobic dancing. Aerobic exercise,
however, includes any rythmic activ
ity that uses the major muscles of the
body and continously maintains the
participants' heart rates at their indi
vidual target level, calculated
variously as 65 to 80 percent of maxi
mum heart rate — equal to 220 minus
the participant's age. Swimming, jog
ging, rowing, bicycling, cross-country
skiing and jumping rope all qualify as
aerobic exercise.
Unlike some forms of physical ex
ercise that require short bursts of in
tensive energy, aerobic training
demands sustained output at a more
moderate level. The popular term
"aerobic" refers to the continous
supply of oxygen required by the
muscles to sustain that level of en
ergy.
According to Barbara Hewitt, re
search assistant and exercise
physiologist at the Stanford Center
for Research and Disease Prevention
— formerly the Stanford Heart
Disease Prevention Program — regu
lar aerobic exercise can result in sub
stantial long-term physiological,
metabolic and psychological benefits:
increased efficiency in the body's
ability to supply oxygen to muscles
through the lungs, heart and blood
vessels; reduced blood pressure, both
at rest and during physical activity;
weight loss; decrease in potentially
harmful components of blood choles
terol; and an improved feeling of
well-being and reduced stress.

Hewitt cautions that while the psy

chological benefits may be immedi
ate, some of the physiological and
metabolic changes may require
several months to a year to occ r.
Many aerobic activities are popular
on campus. I he Dish run is an old fa
vorite, and Stanford pools are
crowded with lap swimmers. Aerobic
dancing, however, has experienced a
steady boom in popularity over the
past five years; six organizations on
campus currently offer a total of 51
class-hours per week.
Stanford Aerobics is a large
student-run organization, with nine
instructors and 20 hours of class per
week. The majority of the partici
pants are undergraduates. Most
classes have a fast pace. The Super
aerobics 90-minute workout features
long sessions of high kicks, combined
with full arm movements — a sure
fire heart-rate raiser for even the
best-conditioned people.
Jazzaerobics is sponsored by Stu
dent Organization Services (SOS)
and is attended mostly by under
graduates. Pace is moderate to fast
with a strong emphasis on stretching.
Director Cynthia Ellis is very safety
conscious and likes to take her class
out for a short jog as part of the
aerobic portion.
Health Promotion Program (HPP)
classes are sponsored by Cowell
Health Center and offered free to
graduate students. The pace is
moderate, but the aerobic phase is
long, up to 35 minutes. There is an
exceptionally strong emphasis on
safety through maintaing proper form
during exercises. Fitness Program
Coordinator Anna Marcovich is a
grand wizard at combining stretching
and toning exercises.
The Bechtel International Center
class features a fast-paced workout
conducted in both English and
Spanish. Toning exercises include a
rigorous upper-body session. Instruc
tor Chani Phillips, also the director of
the program, notes that while such
exercises appeal to the men in her
class, women also will find that even a
small increase in their often
neglected upper-body strength will
pay off handsomely in day-to-day ac
tivities.
The Health Improvement Program

is offered for Stanford faculty and
staff. Pace is moderate, and there is a
special class for beginners only. As in
Cowell's program, injury prevention
through proper execution of exercises
is emphasized.
Jazzercise is an internationally
franchised exercise program. Accord
ing to instructor Roxanne Chun, the
program emphasises a fun workout
without a lot of physical pain.
Although the organizations and the
individual instructors have different
approaches, emphases and styles,
most of the classes share a basic four
part structure of warm up/stretching,
actual aerobics, toning exercises and
cool down/stretching.
Classes begin with a period of
preparatory stretches and easy warm

up ex ercises. Careful stretching
before exercise warms up joints and
muscles and thus helps avoid injury,
while stretching afterward prevents
residual soreness and loss of
flexibility, according to Marcovich.
The warm-up and cool-down exer
cises result in a gradual transition
from resting heart rate to target level
and then back to resting. Chun
stresses the importance of this
smooth transition for safe perfor
mance during the aerobic session.
The period of actual aerobic dan
cing, during which the participants'
heart rate s remain around their tar
get levels, varies in intensity from
class to class and may last from 20 to
35 minutes. This is where the real
cardiovascular exertion and calorie
burning occurs.
The fourth element, toning exer
cises for individual muscle groups,
usually falls between the aerobics and
the final stretching, though in some
classes they come before the aerobics.
Exercises include push-ups, sit-ups
and leg-lifts.
Phillips feels that these toning ex
ercises add power and definition
relatively quickly to muscles, thus
helping to keep participants
motivated.
In addition to these four common
elements, aerobic dancing classes at
Stanford share a committment to pro
viding participants with information
about health and fitness. This is ac
complished through talks before and
during classes, distribution of fitness
oriented literature, and even lectures
and movies that present the latest is
sues on the subject.
For example, Laurel Skurko,
manager of Stanford Aerobics, dis
tributes a monthly pamphlet entitled
"Health Foqus" and feels that such
communication can be a major factor

in motivating participants to adopt
and continue a fitness-oriented life
style. Instructor Rhonda Teters
values these communication channels
as a means of making her students
aware of what is happening inside
their bodies.
Aerobic dancing is a growing activ
ity at Stanford. Last year, 804 indi
viduals attended Cowell's HPP
classes. According to data cards filled
out by new participants, reasons cited
for joining the program included, in
order of frequency, "to get in
shape,""to lose weight,""to relieve
stress," "to have fun" and "to meet
people."
Instructors and students from other
classes report similar feelings. Stan
ford Acrobics instructor Amy Slater
says she likes the total-body condi
tioning offered by aerobics, as
compared to other sports which work
only one or two groups of muscles.
Instructor Nina Schuyler stresses the
social aspect, saying that exercising
with people is more fun and therefore
easier to continue than exercising
alone.
Some students like the music,
others enjoy dancing. Many partici
pants describe clearly observable
benefits. In a HPP follow-up study on
regular participants, 65 percent felt
more energetic, 40 percent less
stressful and 24 percent reported im
proved dietary habits, eating more
nutritious food and less junk food.
Many people simply like the idea of
doing exercise and having fun.
An interesting trend in recent years
has been a slow but steady increase in
the number of male participants.
Slater notes that traditionally aerobic
dancing was attuned only to women's
problem areas — primarily hips,
thighs and buttocks — but recently
instructors are becoming more aware

of men's interests and including arm,
chest and shoulder exercises.
Mistaken perspectives on the part
of both sexes also contibuted to the
lack of male participants. One man
who has never tried aerobic dancing
felt it to be "a bunch of women and
wimps fooling around," while several
non-participant women felt men go
"just to gape at girls in sexy outfits,"
as one women said.
However, with the percentage of
men in some aerobics classes as high
as 35, the situation seems to be
changing.
Hewitt cautions that while aerobic
dancing is can providing substantial
health benefits, many closely related
to the prevention of heart disease,
there is a chance of injury involved.
According to Hewitt, foot, shin and
knee injuries are most common and
can often be attributed to improper
floors and footwear. Marcovich adds
that failure to observe proper form
and stretch sufficiently can also be
major factors.
The aerobic dance organizations on
campus try to reduce injury problems
through rigorous instructor training
and communication with participants.
Although there are no nationally
recognized standards for competency
certification, many of Stanford's in
structors have received training in in
jury prevention and are actively in
volved in transmitting this knowledge
to their classes.
Many instructors offering or super
vising classes on campus have many
years of experience here and abroad.
Nina Schuyler has taught aerobic
dancing for five years at Stanford and
in Denmark. Other instructors take
advanced classes in exercise physiol
ogy and Skurko and Phillips are

Toning exercises, concentrating on specific muscle groups of the body, are an important part of most aerobic
classes.

specialists in health communication.
These rich and varied backgrounds
create a reservoir of information for
the use of instructors and partici
pants. Currently, however, no oppor
tunity exists for instructors from the
various organizations to meet and ex
change information.

Hewitt offers the following
guidelines for a good aerobics pro
gram: for full cardiovascular benefits,
the program should include at least
20 minutes of actual aerobics a mini
mum of three times a week; the class
should promote a fitness lifestyle
through education; and the instructor
should be well-qualified.
Stanford has a variety of readily
available classes that meet these
criteria.
