## THE
						STANFORD DAILY Reagan and the atom 
### 
While the Reagan administration forges ahead
with its "strategic modernization" plan to build
more and better nuclear weapons, Ambassador
Gerard Smith's visit here last week focused some
needed attention on an element of foreign policy
Reagan has sorely neglected: nuclear non
proliferation.
With the exception of Ronald Reagan, every
president since Harry Truman has sought to es
tablish and reinforce an international regime to
control the spread of nuclear weapons and tech
nology to non-nuclear countries. In 1957, Presi
dent Eisenhower pushed for the International
Atomic Energy Agency (lAEA), an autonomous
international organization to which 112 countries
currently belong. But in recent years, efforts by
the Reagan administration to cut funding for
the lAEA have put into peril the successful oper
ation of the organization.
Under the lAEA, states seeking to acquire nu
clear energy for peaceful purposes, such as the
generation of electricity, must submit their reac
tors to international inspection. The success of
this approach is clear: The lAEA currently has
under safeguard 98 percent of the nuclear ma
terial in all countries that do not have nuclear
weapons. Last year alone, the lAEA conducted
on-site inspections of nuclear activities in more
than 50 countries.

Perhaps no one is more aware of America's
pioneering non-proliferation effort than Smith,
whose experience in the initial lAEA talks paved
the way for a distinguished career in arms control
that in 1977 earned him the Presidential Medal
of Freedom. So when Smith says, "Ronald
Reagan has no understanding of nuclear weap
ons," it's time to take a look at how the adminis
tration has approached non-proliferation.
If adopted, Reagan's current budget package
will cut U.S. appropriations for the lAEA to $42
million a year — about the cost of two F-15
fighter planes. Despite the fact that the adminis
tration's much-touted "re-evaluation" of the
lAEA in 1983 found the agency does indeed per
form a critical role for U.S. national security,
funding for the lAEA has been slashed in the last
two fiscal years.
Worse still, when the U.S. representative to the
lAEA left his post in December, Reagan did not
replace him.
When used in tandem with arms control
negotiations aimed at reducing the research, de
velopment and deployment of nuclear weapons, a
policy of nuclear non-proliferation is a key to
keeping America strong — and keeping the
world at peace. Before the international non
proliferation regime breaks down, it's time to
restore America's commitment to the lAEA.
