# Out of South Dakota now
## 
### 
Maybe I'm crazy, but this year's Big Game win still has
not made up for the indescribable, unconstitutional, im
moral and illogical victory that Cal pulled over our heads
in 1983. Sure, it was nice to kick their butts once again;
but hell, the damage was done. They did it, completed the
impossible, and, no matter how hard we try, the memories
will never fade. Consequently, thousands of papers
nationwide covered the story, boasting the sad fact — Cal
beat Stanford.

On a more current note, recent weeks have seen
hundreds of Stanford students sitting in in the Inner
Quad in protest of the University's investments in South
Africa. Certainly a worthy cause, but once again a
response to Cal, where thousands of weenies have been
protesting longer and with better results. True, many of
you couldn't really care less if what we do is first in the na
tion or 41st, as long as it's for a good cause, but I per
sonally would derive grand satisfaction in stealing the
limelight from our obnoxious neighbors to the north and
placing the media attention where it belongs, at the na
tion's finest university, Stanford.
Now, for those of you with the same sickly desires as
mine, I can foresee only one situation. A protest that is so
unique in its conception that we will not only be the move
ment's forerunners, but will also be able to achieve our
desired results without any interference from less worthy
institutions.
Stanford Out of South Dakota not only has a catchy
ring to it, but economically it would be inexpensive to
carry out. Hundreds of posters that have already been
printed in regard to South Africa could easily be altered,
with only the aid of some White-Out and a few Magic
Markers necessary. What more could one ask for?
Additionally, those of you who may have been having
trouble falling asleep on the Quad's cold inner surface
would probably be overjoyed at the idea of road-tripping
to South Dakota to sleep luxuriously upon any one of the
state's many rolling hills. And if the urge strikes you, just
get up and move to another spot. Doesn't this sound one
hell of a lot more exciting than awakening to the same
boring sights and sounds of the Inner Quad?
And don't think we wouldn't have good reason, either.
I know this may come as a surprise to many of you, but
South Dakota has been planning to secede from this great
country for quite some time. In fact, I don't think they

ever really wanted to join in the first place. Do you know
their state motto is, "Under God the people rule?"
Sounds like a bunch of anarchists to me.
Gov. "Wild Bill" Janklow has been preparing for
the move carefully. Mount Rushmore is a perfect exam
ple. What use is an aging Republican president, when you
already have four of the nation's greatest immortalized in
stone? Really, 700,000 people and four presidents. The
least they could have done was settled for Carter.
Similarly, how can one trust a state that's home to Bad
lands National Monument and Wild Bill Hickok? Maybe
they're all a bunch of reckless hoodlums. Also, one of the
state's prime attractions is the Corn Palace found in
Mitchell, S.D. This bizarre, square block building is cov
ered with real corn-on-the-cob murals and trimmed with
cornstalks and clutches of wheat. Would you feel com
fortable there?

Stanford Out of South
Dakota not only has a
catchy ring to it, but also it
would be inexpensive to
carry out. Posters that have
already been printed in
regard to South Africa could
easily be altered, with only
some White-Out and Magic
Markers.

One last point. Unemployment in South Dakota is only
4 percent, less than half the national average. I'm afraid
no more of these anti-American ideas can be tolerated.
Enough is enough.
The time is right, and we must respond to our call.
Throw down your notebooks and pack up your bags.
Look out, South Dakota; here we come. To hell with
grades and to hell with money. If Stanford doesn't pull
out, we'll remain there until we rot. Only in this way can
we triumph over Berkeley in our hearts as well in as our
minds.
Touche, weenies. Prepare for the Big Sit-in.
