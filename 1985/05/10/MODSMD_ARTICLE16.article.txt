Bitburg visit
Ray Ravaglia's letter (The Daily,
May 2) grossly distorts the signifi
cance of President Reagan's visit to
the Bitburg cemetary. First, he seems
to be blind to the political ploy of
"reconciliation" that lies behind the
stubborn insistence of the adminis
tration in this matter. The establish
ment of political, economic, military
and cultural ties between the United
States and West Germany has
already taken place. This new
"reconciliation'' has the concrete
purpose of bolstering conservative
and right-wing elements that con
stitute Helmut Kohl's electoral back
ing in a difficult election year. The
tragedy here lies not in the sad fact
that many people on both sides died
in World War 11. but in the attempt
by present-day politicians to erase or
rewrite historical differences for
more trivial political expediencies.
Ravaglia also suggests that those
who participated in atrocities were
"numbed . .. divorced from life" in
some way that exempts them from
any special guilt. Some metaphysical
exoneration thereby awaits the tragic
torturers who, because they eventu
ally died in the war. are also true
victims just like those they tortured.
Such leveling of moral differences
through pleas to insanity and eventu
ally through death only serves as an
excuse for Nazi murder and for any
violence whatsoever — we all go to
Valhalla in the end to drink and tell

tales of our deeds.
That Jews were the particular
victims of the such vast and
premeditated murder is downplayed
by a not-so-subtle form of anti-
Semitism. While Bitburg contains
members of the Waffen SS who ran
concentration camps, it does not
seem reasonable to Ravaglia that
Jews should be upset (not to mention
the American Legion and others);
instead he thinks that we should be
thinking of other genocidcs that have
not received so much attention: the
"neverending influx of Holocaust
movies" is so tiring. Bitburg,
however, is stuck with the specific
connotation of the "Final Solution."
For, in spite of the hideous dimen
sions of the Turkish massacre of
Armenians, the SS were apparently
more concerned with Jews. Thus, the
assertion that "America is not full of
influential Armenians" has little to
do with why Bitburg has become the
focus of protest. Exposing the moral
chicanery of Reagan on this specific
issue can only help in the growth of
sensitivity to other peoples who have
been likewise persecuted.
Any attempt to reduce such events
to obscure concepts of universal
tragedy or reconciliation only
promulgates the political and moral
manipulation of the past and present.
Reagan's visit to Bitburg is a case in
point.

Nicaragua speech
Your reporter generally did a
reasonably accurate job of reporting
the Rev. Norman Bent's talk con
cerning the difficult situation in
Nicaragua's Atlantic coast region
(The Daily, May 1). However, he
left out some important information
Bent provided regarding promising
recent developments there.
Autonomy for the indigenous people
and other ethnic groups living there
is not, as the reporter suggests, a
vague aspiration deferred until "one
day" in the distant future; it is, on
the contrary, a definite, specific plan,
the details of whose implementation
are being worked out right now.
Moreover, the Nicaraguan govern
ment has recently, according to Bent,
taken a series of measures designed
to demonstrate its good faith. Specif
ically, it has negotiated a ceasefire in
the Atlantic coast zone, released all
Miskitu prisoners, and invited Mis
kitu refugees currently in Honduras
to return to Nicaragua, guaranteeing
them a safe return and offering them
amnesty.
These are concrete, constructive
moves — and remarkable ones for a
country under attack by the most
powerful nation in the world, as
Nicaragua clearly is. The flexibility,
maturity and commitment to the
well-being of all Nicaraguans which
the Sandinista regime has recently
shown in its handling of the volatile

Atlantic coast situation, following an
earlier period of insensitivity and
gross blunders and abuses, is a story
which has received far too little
coverage in the U.S. press. It is a ,
shame that The Daily story on Bent's
visit had the effect of maintaining
this disturbing silence.

Rude audience
Suppose the pro-total divestment
group had expressed their views one
evening in a public forum in the
Quad. Suppose their speeches had
been continually interrupted by
members of the audience who hissed,
booed, catcalled and generally
"picked on" the speaker as he spoke.
I'd bet you 10-to-l that angry
publicity would fly about this rude
and obnoxious audience.
Well, consider the reverse which
happened at last week's forum,
where members of the Board of
Trustees were constantly badgered
by some people in the audience
while they spoke, yet no one in the
audience seemed to mind. Wasn't
the purpose of the forum to listen to
what the members of the board had
to say?
