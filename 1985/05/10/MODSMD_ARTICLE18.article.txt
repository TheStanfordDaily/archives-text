## TMU staff strives to serve 
### 
In a deep, dark corner of the second floor sits the Great
Beast of Tresidder Management. Holding court like Jabba
the Hutt, it gobbles up the defenseless and belches in the
face of University policy and human decency.
I apologize for destroying a fantasy, but like all "Great
Beasts," this one, too, is mythical. If this is the vision you
hold, I invite you to visit Tresidder Memorial Union and
see what really stands behind its services, programs and
administration. Throughout the organization, you will find
individuals who chose their profession because they
believe in student development and community service.

VIEWPOINT

Don't get me wrong. I do not view Tresidder through
rose-colored glasses. All organizations have problems and
weak points; this one is no different. The rough spots in
the record of TMU stand out more distinctly than those of
other organizations because it is a public place and it
invites inspection. If all organizations have problems, then
the point is not what they are, but rather, how they are re
solved.
Over the course of the last several years, significant im
provements have been made throughout Tresidder
Union. The facility has been renovated, the programs
have been expanded and upgraded, the services have
become more responsive to the community, and staff
morale and team spirit have increased. The road has not
been a smooth and even one, but the direction has been
positive and forward. Let me paint for you a picture of the
people behind Tresidder that the public rarely sees:
• During the 1982 United Stanford Workers strike, staff
members took turns coming in early to open the building
and ensure that services continued for the Stanford com
munity. Assistant directors and managers cleaned rooms
and did set-ups — whatever was necessary to keep the
operations going.
• As two new food service areas developed (the Corner

Pocket and Baker Street), they were given student
manager positions. No University policy dictated this
move, but the people at Tresidder recognize the value of
such opportunities for learning outside the classroom.
• When staff morale hit a low point, a series of ongoing
staff development opportunities was instituted by the
director and organized by teams of other staff members —
this includes an annual retreat, monthly workshops and
opportunities for greater input (available to all staff mem
bers) through project teams. Those who have complained
so loudly of late refused to take advantage of any of these
opportunities.
• In the rainy winter of a couple years ago, the director,
assistant directors and several area managers spent hours
into the evening slogging sandbags against the flood and
removing perishable goods to emergency storage until the
power was restored.
What qualified me to offer these observations? I spent
four years as a student volunteer at Tresidder, serving on
the Food and Space Committees and chairing the Union
Board for two years (in an ASSU nominations committee
position). I also worked at the Coffee House and am cur
rently an administrative assistant in the business office.
Having been involved with TMU for approaching five
years, and having seen Tresidder from both a student and
a staff perspective, I have a different sense of history than
do most people.
The point I offer you is that no organization is one
dimensional, and neither are the individuals involved. The
next time you need a quick snack or cup of coffee at 11
p.m., the next time you are enjoying a noon concert or
happy hour musician, the next time your group needs a
meeting room at the last minute, or the next time you say
"hello" to one of your friends working behind a counter at
Tresidder, think again about your vision of the people
who manage TMU.
