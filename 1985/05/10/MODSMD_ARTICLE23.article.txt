# Instructor stresses direct expression of music
## 
### CRISTINA RUOTOLO 
"l strongly believe that every person has an innate mu
sical sense."
With this unconventional and assuring perspective on
musicianship, Gennady Kleyman teaches violin, viola and
chamber music to both music majors and non-majors at
Stanford, encouraging all his students to strive for
acomplishment.
When Kleyman came to Stanford six years ago, he en
countered only a handful of performing violinists, violists
and cellists. Now his schedule overflows with eager stu
dents, and he often teaches 12 or 13 hours a day during
the two days a week he reserves for music instruction.
His students perform regularly in solo recitals and cham
ber concerts and as soloists with the symphony and
chamber orchestras on campus. This surge of string
playing under his guidance can be explained by his stu
dents' enthusiasm for his teaching approach.
Kleyman conveys "a philosophy of life" in the process
of teaching music, according to freshman John Pollack.
Other students agree that Kleyman presents the experi
ence of music in terms of a general approach to human
self-expression.
Kleyman stresses the importance of unhindered infor
mation, of "saying exactly what you think and feel" for
the creative experience, he says. Direct and honest ex
pression determines one's success as a musician, and the
greatest musicians are those who develop their technical
skills "in order to communicate what exists within them.
Virtuosity for its own sake has little meaning," he says.
Students praise Kleyman's ability to get them excited
about making music. Senior Kim Hamilton says she al
ways leaves her lessons "with a better perspective on life"
because she feels Kleyman has helped her to express her
self through music. "He helps me to bring myself into
music, rather than imposing his own framework on me,
she explains.
Senior Phil Richardson says he believes Kleyman is the
"best violin teacher and one of the best teachers" he has
had, because Kleyman's primary goal "is obviously to
help the students."
Pollack agrees, saying, "Mr. Kleyman makes you aware
how high the mountain is, but doesn't discourage you
from trying to climb it."
Kleyman's holistic method has attracted quite a few
pianists and wind players to his studio for chamber music
coaching. Ellen Brodsky, a graduate student in music, says
that Kleyman's "ability to verbalize both musical and
technical ideas" revitalized her interest and success in
playing the piano at a critical point in her musical career.
Brodsky emphasizes Kleyman's sensitivity to different
qualities of color and tone in sound production that allows
him to offer valuable coaching to instrumentalists other
than string players.
Kleyman's parallel committments during his six years at
Stanford have included a professorship at the San Fran
cisco Conservatory of Music, a position playing viola in

the San Francisco Symphony, and private teaching in his
San Francisco home. He says his teaching experience at
Stanford has been the most challenging and exciting be
cause "Stanford is an environment of total commitment,"
one that infuses the violin lesson with a degree of energy
and effort that one sometimes misses at purely musical in
stitutions. He feels he must constantly present all aspects
of playing music for the Stanford student whose profes
sional goals often lie elsewhere. Although the pre-

professional musician often must conform to technical
standards before or apart from musical ones, Kleyman
"cannot teach only technique, but must integrate tech
nique and music at all times' to maintain his students' en
thusiam, according to one of his students.
Kleyman most enjoys teaching advanced, serious stu
dents who are ready to tackle the fundamental project of
making music, learning "to say exactly what they want to
say," he says. He emphasizes the physiological aspect of
producing sound, believing that "to express yourself is to

be physically comfortable." One must learn how to con
trol the body and discover "where things happen," ulti
mately integrating musical style with one's physique, he
says.
Danny Cher, who recently played a concerto with the
Stanford Symphony as a winner of the Stanford Concerto
Competition, feels he has benefitted significantly from
Kleyman's physiological approach. Another student who
has often performed both on and off campus claims that

Direct and honest expres
sion determines one's sue
cess as a musician. The
greatest musicians are those
who develop their technical
skill 'in order to communi
cate what exists within
them. Virtuosity for its own
sake has little meaning.'

her entire perspective on music has been radically altered
by Kleyman's unique method. "I came to him very
frustrated and limited by my awkward technique. He
gradually got me to realize that I could be comfortable
and play the violin at the same time. And to be com
fortable meant I could express my ideas about the music
rather than fight my body," she says.
Although a good number of his Stanford students are
serious musicians who place music high on their priority
lists, many simply do not have much time to practice as

much as they would like. While most performance teach
ers with his background of rigorous training might be
frustrated with the necessarily diverse commitments of
Stanford students, Kleyman easily adapts himself to their
various levels of ability and motivation. Richardson notes
that Kleyman "strikes a balance between pushng me and
letting me go my own pace." Richardson feels that
Kleyman, unlike any of his past teachers, has "taught me
how to practice. He has given me the tools with which 1
can progress, and now 1 only need the time."
Even with the intermediate and beginning students,
Kleyman presents the idea of producing sound and
melody in terms of basic physical and mental experiences.
The story of his first student illustrates his uniquefap
proach to both the development of one's musical ease and
the often awkward and alien experience of holding an
oblong wooden box under one's chin and drawing a bow
over a string stretched across the box.
A young boy of six or seven years came to Kleyman
with no apparent proclivity to either making music or
playing the violin. "He couldn't sing one single note. He
couldn't hear (music). He couldn't listen. 'What can I do?'
I asked myself," Kleyman says.
Kleyman began by asking the boy to recite nursery
rhymes learned at school. Evident in the boy's verbal in
flections was a sense of rhythm and pitch, Kleyman says.
Kleyman moved on to simple songs that the boy
succeeded in singing with a degree of recognition.
Kleyman then repeated the songs on the piano and finally
alerted the boy to a connection between what he heard
and what he sang. A realization of that connection is con
sidered the first major step to developing a sense of one's
own musical talent. After further exercises of clapping,
dancing and singing, the boy was ready to play. This boy,
Kleyman's first "tone-deaf" student, is now a successful
professional violinist, Kleyman says.
Born in Russia, Kleyman emigrated to the United
States 11 years ago. He studied at the Leningrad Conser
vatory, where he eventually became a member of the fac
ulty. He was also a violist in the Rimsky-Korsakov Quar
tet, the resident chamber group noted for performing con
temporary music, and made many recordings for Melodia
Records.
In 1963, he won the Russian Viola Competition.
During the following decade, he played in the Leningrad
Philharmonic, the Leningrad Chamber Orchestra and
later the Kirov Opera and Ballet Orchestra, accompany
ing such virtuosi as David Oistrahk and Mistlav
Rostropovitch.
He left the Soviet Union in 1974 and, after spending
some time in Austria and Italy, went to Rochester,
N.Y., where he played in the Rochester Philharmonic.
The next year he came to San Francisco, his current home.
In addition to playing and teaching viola and violin,
Kleyman has taken up violin making in his spare time.
One of his Stanford students, Nancy Wu, played in a reci
tal with a violin made by Kleyman.

chamber orchestras on campus. This surge of string
playing under his guidance can be explained by his stu
dents' enthusiasm for his teaching approach.
Kleyman conveys "a philosophy of life" in the process
of teaching music, according to freshman John Pollack.
Other students agree that Kleyman presents the experi
ence of music in terms of a general approach to human
self-expression.
Kleyman stresses the importance of unhindered infor
mation, of "saying exactly what you think and feel" for
the creative experience, he says. Direct and honest ex
pression determines one's success as a musician, and the
greatest musicians are those who develop their technical
skills "in order to communicate what exists within them.
Virtuosity for its own sake has little meaning," he says.
Students praise Kleyman's ability to get them excited
about making music. Senior Kim Hamilton says she al
ways leaves her lessons "with a better perspective on life"
because she feels Kleyman has helped her to express her
self through music. "He helps me to bring myself into
music, rather than imposing his own framework on me,
she explains.
Senior Phil Richardson says he believes Kleyman is the
"best violin teacher and one of the best teachers" he has
had, because Kleyman's primary goal "is obviously to
help the students."
Pollack agrees, saying, "Mr. Kleyman makes you aware
how high the mountain is, but doesn't discourage you
from trying to climb it."
Kleyman's holistic method has attracted quite a few
pianists and wind players to his studio for chamber music
coaching. Ellen Brodsky, a graduate student in music, says
that Kleyman's "ability to verbalize both musical and
technical ideas" revitalized her interest and success in
playing the piano at a critical point in her musical career.
Brodsky emphasizes Kleyman's sensitivity to different
qualities of color and tone in sound production that allows
him to offer valuable coaching to instrumentalists other
than string players.
Kleyman's parallel committments during his six years at
Stanford have included a professorship at the San Fran
cisco Conservatory of Music, a position playing viola in

the San Francisco Symphony, and private teaching in his
San Francisco home. He says his teaching experience at
Stanford has been the most challenging and exciting be
cause "Stanford is an environment of total commitment,"
one that infuses the violin lesson with a degree of energy
and effort that one sometimes misses at purely musical in
stitutions. He feels he must constantly present all aspects
of playing music for the Stanford student whose profes
sional goals often lie elsewhere. Although the pre-

professional musician often must conform to technical
standards before or apart from musical ones, Kleyman
"cannot teach only technique, but must integrate tech
nique and music at all times' to maintain his students' en
thusiam, according to one of his students.
Kleyman most enjoys teaching advanced, serious stu
dents who are ready to tackle the fundamental project of
making music, learning "to say exactly what they want to
say," he says. He emphasizes the physiological aspect of
producing sound, believing that "to express yourself is to

be physically comfortable." One must learn how to con
trol the body and discover "where things happen," ulti
mately integrating musical style with one's physique, he
says.
Danny Cher, who recently played a concerto with the
Stanford Symphony as a winner of the Stanford Concerto
Competition, feels he has benefitted significantly from
Kleyman's physiological approach. Another student who
has often performed both on and off campus claims that

Direct and honest expres
sion determines one's sue
cess as a musician. The
greatest musicians are those
who develop their technical
skill 'in order to communi
cate what exists within
them. Virtuosity for its own
sake has little meaning.'
â€” Gennady Kleyman

her entire perspective on music has been radically altered
by Kleyman's unique method. "I came to him very
frustrated and limited by my awkward technique. He
gradually got me to realize that I could be comfortable
and play the violin at the same time. And to be com
fortable meant I could express my ideas about the music
rather than fight my body," she says.
Although a good number of his Stanford students are
serious musicians who place music high on their priority
lists, many simply do not have much time to practice as

much as they would like. While most performance teach
ers with his background of rigorous training might be
frustrated with the necessarily diverse commitments of
Stanford students, Kleyman easily adapts himself to their
various levels of ability and motivation. Richardson notes
that Kleyman "strikes a balance between pushng me and
letting me go my own pace." Richardson feels that
Kleyman, unlike any of his past teachers, has "taught me
how to practice. He has given me the tools with which 1
can progress, and now 1 only need the time."
Even with the intermediate and beginning students,
Kleyman presents the idea of producing sound and
melody in terms of basic physical and mental experiences.
The story of his first student illustrates his uniquefap
proach to both the development of one's musical ease and
the often awkward and alien experience of holding an
oblong wooden box under one's chin and drawing a bow
over a string stretched across the box.
A young boy of six or seven years came to Kleyman
with no apparent proclivity to either making music or
playing the violin. "He couldn't sing one single note. He
couldn't hear (music). He couldn't listen. 'What can I do?'
I asked myself," Kleyman says.
Kleyman began by asking the boy to recite nursery
rhymes learned at school. Evident in the boy's verbal in
flections was a sense of rhythm and pitch, Kleyman says.
Kleyman moved on to simple songs that the boy
succeeded in singing with a degree of recognition.
Kleyman then repeated the songs on the piano and finally
alerted the boy to a connection between what he heard
and what he sang. A realization of that connection is con
sidered the first major step to developing a sense of one's
own musical talent. After further exercises of clapping,
dancing and singing, the boy was ready to play. This boy,
Kleyman's first "tone-deaf" student, is now a successful
professional violinist, Kleyman says.
Born in Russia, Kleyman emigrated to the United
States 11 years ago. He studied at the Leningrad Conser
vatory, where he eventually became a member of the fac
ulty. He was also a violist in the Rimsky-Korsakov Quar
tet, the resident chamber group noted for performing con
temporary music, and made many recordings for Melodia
Records.
In 1963, he won the Russian Viola Competition.
During the following decade, he played in the Leningrad
Philharmonic, the Leningrad Chamber Orchestra and
later the Kirov Opera and Ballet Orchestra, accompany
ing such virtuosi as David Oistrahk and Mistlav
Rostropovitch.
He left the Soviet Union in 1974 and, after spending
some time in Austria and Italy, went to Rochester,
N.Y., where he played in the Rochester Philharmonic.
The next year he came to San Francisco, his current home.
In addition to playing and teaching viola and violin,
Kleyman has taken up violin making in his spare time.
One of his Stanford students, Nancy Wu, played in a reci
tal with a violin made by Kleyman.

"l strongly believe that every person has an innate mu
sical sense."
With this unconventional and assuring perspective on
musicianship, Gennady Kleyman teaches violin, viola and
chamber music to both music majors and non-majors at
Stanford, encouraging all his students to strive for
acomplishment.
When Kleyman came to Stanford six years ago, he en
countered only a handful of performing violinists, violists
and cellists. Now his schedule overflows with eager stu
dents, and he often teaches 12 or 13 hours a day during
the two days a week he reserves for music instruction.
