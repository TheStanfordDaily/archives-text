# Views differ on the cost of divestment
## News 
### BARBARA SCHULER Senior staff writer 
In contrast to the University response during
the 1977 wave of divestment protests, Stanford
President Donald Kennedy has steered clear of
financial arguments in the current debate. His
open letter to the Stanford community in Mon
day s Daily skimmed over the possible costs of
divestment, making reference to the trustees'
legal responsibility "for preserving the institu
tional assets they hold in public trust."
Similarly, Trustee James Gaither addressed
fiduciary responsibility at Tuesday's public
forum by never arguing the point explicitly, but
by adhering to an implicit University assumption
that divestment will lower Stanford's invest
ment returns.
Those facing the economic question head on
this time around are not the opponents but the
advocates of divestment. In public forums on
the issue at both Stanford and UC-Berkeley,
divestment backers chose as keynote speakers
financial analysts who argued the profitability of
South Africa-free investment portfolios.
"Not only don't you lose money, but you can
make money with a South Africa-free
portfolio," said John Harrington, president of
Working Assets Money Fund, at the April 24
Berkeley divestment forum.
Expressing sharp disagreement with Har
rington's claims, Stanford Treasurer Rodney
Adams, a co-author of Stanford's 1977 cost
benefit analysis of divestment, said the nine
most thorough studies he has seen all come to
"a strong and clear conclusion that (a South
Africa-free portfolio) is a lower return and
higher risk."
A recent review of the same nine divestment

studies by the Investment Responsibility Re
search Center (IRRC), a non-profit organiza
tion based in Washington, D.C., contradicts
Adams' interpretation.
"Nearly all of the studies that measured risk
and return found that the South Africa-free
portfolio exhibited both higher rates of return
and greater variability of returns (which is the
definition of risk in financial theory) than did
unconstrained portfolios," according to the
report.
"This comparison . . . fails to answer the
question of whether the additional return was
sufficient to compensate investors for the addi
tional risk," wrote report author David Hauck.
The answer to that question depends on who
you ask.
Respected studies supporting their points of
view have been put forth vigorously by both
friends and foes of divestment. One of the few
areas of agreement between the two is the con
tention that many of these studies employed
flawed methodologies that skewed their conclu
sions.
"If I had the time, I could do one study, or I
could do 10 studies, and I could prove whatever
you wanted me to prove, either that South
African-free did better or South African (-free)
did worse," Adams said.
One of the earliest comprehensive studies by
a university on divestment was the one Adams
drafted. While its findings have been criticized
as "very overstated and tenuous at best" by one
professor here, the eight-year-old report still
proves useful as an indicator of University con
cerns over divestment costs.
The report cites three major adverse effects

of divestment on the University's portfolio:
transaction costs for one-time divestment and
continued exclusion; inability to outperform the
market due to decreased diversity and con
straints on money managers; and the loss of
future gift receipts from excluded companies
and affiliated individuals.
Kennedy has asked Adams, who says he is
"not a fan of divestment." to address the finan
cial implications of such a policy at next week's
trustee meeting. Despite the array of reports
on both sides of the question, Adams says he is
convinced that the price of divestment would be
very high.
"Financially, it would significantly hurt us,"
Adams said."lf all the endowed universities and
colleges in the U.S. sold all their stocks, they
would be exchanged within a matter of days on
the New York Stock Exchange ... so the finan
cial impact on the company is nil, the financial
impact on the university is significant," he said.
According to figures from the Treasurer's Of
fice, Stanford owns stock worth $215 million in
97 U.S. companies that operate in South Africa.
This amount represents 60 percent of Univer
sity assets invested in domestic stock.
Adams estimates that the cost of excluding
South Arica-related companies from Stanford's
portfolio would be more than 1 percent an
nually. Domestic stock holdings of $358 million
constitute 27 percent of Stanford's total endow
ment assets of $1.3 billion. Thus, the annual
cost to Stanford of full divestment is about $4
million, Adams said.
"That's a statistically supportable figure. My
guess is that it's probably more," he added.
Adams based these figures on the three major
divestment costs analyzed in the 1977 report, as

well as subsequent findings. South Africa-free
money managers consistently point to exagger
ated transaction costs and an ignorance about
the kinds of companies that comprise the South
Africa-free universe as sources of these high
cost estimates.
Theodore Brown, president of the Institute
for Corporate Research and Education, and
formerly an analyst with Shearson-Lehman-
American Express, said at Tuesday's forum that
transaction costs are "essentially a non-issue.
They're a smokescreen . . . designed to hide the
typical investment manager's distaste for the
politics of divestment."
According to Brown, the insistence that
transaction costs will be an extraordinary drain
on assets hides the fact of normal portfolio turn
over. "Twenty-five to 75 percent of the typical
institutional fund is turned over every year," he
said. In order to get an accurate picture of trans
action costs, normal costs must be subtracted
from the slightly increased costs of trading
smaller capitalization companies, he said.
Market capitalization is the product of the
number of shares outstanding by the market
value of the stock.
Besides, "potential return is so much greater
that even if [the cost figure] is 1 percent, that
will be cleaned up within the first year by in
creased returns," Brown said.
One very real cost that cannot be refuted,
however, is "cost between the bid and ask price
of a stock," according to Harrington. "Smaller,
more thinly traded stocks," such as those of the
smaller capitalization companies that
predominate in the South Africa-free universe,
"run a higher risk between your bid
and ask price," explained Harrington.
Bid-ask spread is the difference in
price between what sellers are asking
and buyers are offering for a share of
stock.
Adams also made the frequently
voiced argument that the exclusion of
South Africa-related companies from
a stock portfolio will significantly
decrease diversification, or spreading
of funds throughout numerous indus
try sectors. "Forty to 50 percent of
Standard & Poor's 500 stocks would
be barred under a total divestment
policy. If you wanted to buy stock,
you'd want to buy from the whole,
not just half the market," he said.
Both Brown and Harrington
believe it is a mistake to hold the
S & P 500 "sacrosanct." The IRRC
identified 285 companies doing busi
ness in South Africa in December
1984, and Standard & Poor's tracks
more than 10,000 public corpora
tions, Brown explained. He insists
there are plenty of South Africa-free
stocks to trade both in and out of the
S & P 500.
"To say that if you divest from
South Africa, you're going to be in
vesting in itty-bitty companies is just
not true," Brown said. In a study he
conducted, analyzing 124 companies
ranked A- or better by Stan
dard & Poor's in the South Africa
free universe and 124 in the uncon
strained universe, the market
capitalization value of the South
Africa-free companies was at least
$1.5 billion, he said. "These were
huge American corporations. AL
COA, AMAX, ABC, Anheuser
Busch, Boise-C'ascade, Campbell's

Soup . . . and I could go on." Brown
said.
Over a five-year period from Janu
ary 1980 to December 1984, the
South Africa-free companies outper
formed those companies with assets
in South Africa by an average of 29.2
percent, he said.
Addressing the issue of diversifica
tion, Harrington acknowledged that
within the Standard & Poor's 500,
companies in certain sectors may be
excluded by going South Africa-free,
but the S& P 500 does not represent
all the companies in any one sector.
Diversification can be sought outside
the S & P 500, he said.
"There is literally not a single in
dustry group eliminated if you go
South Africa-free. . . . Have you ever
seen a money manager that has all the
major industry sectors in his portfolio
anyway?" Harrington asked.
As of December 1984, Stanford's
domestic equities were spread among
16 industry sectors, according to a
February treasurer's report to the
trustees.
One contention that no study has
denied is that corporate philanthropy,
on which Stanford relies heavily,
would decrease as a result ot a total
divestment policy. While the 1977
University report did not attempt to
quantify the decrease in such gifts, a
1978 Harvard study estimated its po
tential losses at about 16 percent in
donated securities, and its cash gifts
from corporations would drop by
$700,000 annually.
Adams believes the negative im
pact of divestment on the University's
relations with business could be se
vere. "It'll be viewed by [some], in
correctly ... as an anti-business, anti-
American, anti-free enterprise ac

tion. That in turn could prompt reac
tions," Adams said.
"Any company we choose to
publicly chastise would not he too in
terested in giving money and would
not be as interested in having people
come to recruit. .. . They're
diplomatic enough that they have not
stated this explicitly." Adams said,
adding, though, that he has sensed
these feelings in recent dialogue with
Motorola Corp., the Timken Co. and
Hewlett-Packard.
The January IRRC report con
cluded in its executive summary that
"divestment will have a detrimental
effect over the long term on portfolio
performance." This conclusion,
which has particular application for
large, actively managed portfolios
similar to Stanford's, is based on
relatively high transaction, liquidity
and research costs, according to the
IRRC analysis.
The executive summary is tem
pered by findings of several studies
analyzed in the body of the report.
"For the five studies assessed in this
report that conducted return com
parisons, the return for the South
Africa-free portfolio always exceeded
that of the unconstrained portfolio,"
the IRRC stated.
But Adams said it was unlikely that
Stanford's current money managers
would want to manage a South
Africa-free portfolio.
"There is very clear evidence that if
you hire somebody to do something,
and then don't give them the discre
tion to do it, then their performance
will be less. ... If you tie a hand be
hind somebody's back, they're not
going to do as well as somebody with
both hands free," Adams said.
