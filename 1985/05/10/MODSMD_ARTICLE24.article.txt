# Views differ on the cost of divestment

### BARBARA SCHULER Senior staff writer 
In contrast to the University response during
the 1977 wave of divestment protests, Stanford
President Donald Kennedy has steered clear of
financial arguments in the current debate. His
open letter to the Stanford community in Mon
day s Daily skimmed over the possible costs of
divestment, making reference to the trustees'
legal responsibility "for preserving the institu
tional assets they hold in public trust."
Similarly, Trustee James Gaither addressed
fiduciary responsibility at Tuesday's public
forum by never arguing the point explicitly, but
by adhering to an implicit University assumption
that divestment will lower Stanford's invest
ment returns.
Those facing the economic question head on
this time around are not the opponents but the
advocates of divestment. In public forums on
the issue at both Stanford and UC-Berkeley,
divestment backers chose as keynote speakers
financial analysts who argued the profitability of
South Africa-free investment portfolios.
"Not only don't you lose money, but you can
make money with a South Africa-free
portfolio," said John Harrington, president of
Working Assets Money Fund, at the April 24
Berkeley divestment forum.
Expressing sharp disagreement with Har
rington's claims, Stanford Treasurer Rodney
Adams, a co-author of Stanford's 1977 cost
benefit analysis of divestment, said the nine
most thorough studies he has seen all come to
"a strong and clear conclusion that (a South
Africa-free portfolio) is a lower return and
higher risk."
A recent review of the same nine divestment

studies by the Investment Responsibility Re
search Center (IRRC), a non-profit organiza
tion based in Washington, D.C., contradicts
Adams' interpretation.
"Nearly all of the studies that measured risk
and return found that the South Africa-free
portfolio exhibited both higher rates of return
and greater variability of returns (which is the
definition of risk in financial theory) than did
unconstrained portfolios," according to the
report.
"This comparison . . . fails to answer the
question of whether the additional return was
sufficient to compensate investors for the addi
tional risk," wrote report author David Hauck.
The answer to that question depends on who
you ask.
Respected studies supporting their points of
view have been put forth vigorously by both
friends and foes of divestment. One of the few
areas of agreement between the two is the con
tention that many of these studies employed
flawed methodologies that skewed their conclu
sions.
"If I had the time, I could do one study, or I
could do 10 studies, and I could prove whatever
you wanted me to prove, either that South
African-free did better or South African (-free)
did worse," Adams said.
One of the earliest comprehensive studies by
a university on divestment was the one Adams
drafted. While its findings have been criticized
as "very overstated and tenuous at best" by one
professor here, the eight-year-old report still
proves useful as an indicator of University con
cerns over divestment costs.
The report cites three major adverse effects

of divestment on the University's portfolio:
transaction costs for one-time divestment and
continued exclusion; inability to outperform the
market due to decreased diversity and con
straints on money managers; and the loss of
future gift receipts from excluded companies
and affiliated individuals.
Kennedy has asked Adams, who says he is
"not a fan of divestment." to address the finan
cial implications of such a policy at next week's
trustee meeting. Despite the array of reports
on both sides of the question, Adams says he is
convinced that the price of divestment would be
very high.
"Financially, it would significantly hurt us,"
Adams said."lf all the endowed universities and
colleges in the U.S. sold all their stocks, they
would be exchanged within a matter of days on
the New York Stock Exchange ... so the finan
cial impact on the company is nil, the financial
impact on the university is significant," he said.
According to figures from the Treasurer's Of
fice, Stanford owns stock worth $215 million in
97 U.S. companies that operate in South Africa.
This amount represents 60 percent of Univer
sity assets invested in domestic stock.
Adams estimates that the cost of excluding
South Arica-related companies from Stanford's
portfolio would be more than 1 percent an
nually. Domestic stock holdings of $358 million
constitute 27 percent of Stanford's total endow
ment assets of $1.3 billion. Thus, the annual
cost to Stanford of full divestment is about $4
million, Adams said.
"That's a statistically supportable figure. My
guess is that it's probably more," he added.
Adams based these figures on the three major
divestment costs analyzed in the 1977 report, as

well as subsequent findings. South Africa-free
money managers consistently point to exagger
ated transaction costs and an ignorance about
the kinds of companies that comprise the South
Africa-free universe as sources of these high
cost estimates.
Theodore Brown, president of the Institute
for Corporate Research and Education, and
formerly an analyst with Shearson-Lehman-
American Express, said at Tuesday's forum that
transaction costs are "essentially a non-issue.
They're a smokescreen . . . designed to hide the
typical investment manager's distaste for the
politics of divestment."
According to Brown, the insistence that
transaction costs will be an extraordinary drain
on assets hides the fact of normal portfolio turn
over. "Twenty-five to 75 percent of the typical
institutional fund is turned over every year," he
said. In order to get an accurate picture of trans
action costs, normal costs must be subtracted
from the slightly increased costs of trading
smaller capitalization companies, he said.
Market capitalization is the product of the
number of shares outstanding by the market
value of the stock.
Besides, "potential return is so much greater
that even if [the cost figure] is 1 percent, that
will be cleaned up within the first year by in
creased returns," Brown said.
One very real cost that cannot be refuted,
however, is "cost between the bid and ask price
of a stock," according to Harrington. "Smaller,
more thinly traded stocks," such as those of the
smaller capitalization companies that
predominate in the South Africa-free universe,
