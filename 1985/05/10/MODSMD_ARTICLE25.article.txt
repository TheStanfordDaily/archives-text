## Stanford rolls past SF State 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
For a while yesterday, it appeared that San Fran
cisco State might give Stanford a tough game. But
after three scoreless innings, the Cardinal took con
trol and stomped the Gators 15-0 behind Jack
McDowell's overpowering pitching and a balanced
14-hit attack.
The win was the second-ranked Cardinal's 40th
of the year, against 11 losses. McDowell's eight
hitter, his second shutout of the season, extended
Stanford's scoreless inning streak to 23.
"I felt a little out of rhythm, but it didn't really
matter," McDowell said. "I had good stuff."
The Gators did reach McDowell for three hits in
the first, but were denied a run because catcher
John Ramos picked Lorant Reeves off first base.
The early hits didn't bother McDowell. "They were
cheap hits, all three of them," he said.
San Francisco State starter Neal Griggs was able
to keep Stanford off balance with his curveball —
until the fourth. In that inning, Mike Deßenon ex
ecuted a perfect sacrifice bunt to move up Mark
Davis and Rick Lundblade, who had both walked.
Then, on a 1-0 pitch, Walt Harris drilled a two-run
single to center, and the rout was on.
A walk to Toi Cook ended the day for Griggs,
and with two out, John Verducci drove a two-run
single off the glove of shortstop Steve Glass,

making the score 4-0.
The Gators were unable to stop the Cardinal
from scoring in any inning the rest of the way. After
a three-run uprising in the fifth, Stanford reached
double figures for the ninth time in the last 10
games with three more in the sixth.
After Pete Stanicek reached on an error and
Davis singled. Lundblade smacked his 23rd home
run of the year off the scoreboard in left-center. It
was the 40th career homer for Stanford's all-time
longbal! king, who broke the record previously held
by Eric Hardgrave and Tom Guardino on Sunday
against Arizona State.
"1 m happy about it. It's something I can look
back on later" Lundblade said. "Right now, I've
got other things to think about — like getting into
the College World Series."
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess decided to clear
his bench in the seventh, and the subs kept the
Cardinal offense running smoothly with five runs in
the next two innings.
James Gasho led off the seventh with a single
and went to third on a Fred Laningham double to
left. After Ramos lofted a sacrifice fly, David
Esquer drove in Laningham with a solid single to
center.
With Lundblade on second in the eighth, pinch
hitter Dave Nelson was grazed on the hamstring by
a Phil Rollins pitch, but Nelson wanted to stay at

the plate and take his cuts. "I told him (the umpire)
it was only my third at-bat of the year, and that it
didn't hit me very hard," he said.
The man in blue was unsympathetic and sent
Nelson to first.
Esquer's second hit, an RBI single to right in the
eighth, gave him a 2-for-2 day that raised his bat
ting average 190 points to .333. "It has to be the
highlight of my career here so far." he said. "Both
the pitches were fastballs. It was early in the count,
so 1 could expect fastballs."
Both Nelson and Esquer agreed that although
they would naturally prefer more playing time, the
success and cohesiveness of the team make the life
of a substitute a lot easier. "This team is great
about really being a team," Nelson said. "It's not
just a couple of separate groups."
"We're winning, and we gotta stay with what
works," Esquer said. "We've got no complainers at
all. Everyone knows his role."
McDowell played his role perfectly yesterday,
striking out nine while walking only one. According
to his catcher, the Gators were just overmatched
against the hard-throwing right-hander. "He was
throwing fastballs right by them," Ramos said. "I
mean literally throwing them by them."

Pinch hitter Dave Nelson grins while talking to Asst. Coach Kirk
Mason after being hit by a pitch in the eighth inning yesterday. Nelson,
making only his third plate appearance of the season, was reluctant to
relinquish his at bat after being hit, claiming, "It didn't hit me very
hard," to an unsympethetic umpire.
McDowell was a little more
diplomatic. "They're a good hitting
team, but they just didn't have
today."
In addition to his forkball and
glove-popping fastball, McDowell
has been working on a new pitch for
his arsenal — a slider. "He started
throwing it at USC," Ramos said. "It
gives him something else to show the
hitters."
"We've been working on it for a
while," McDowell said. "I feel more
comfortable every time I throw it."
Rob Wassenaar hopes he will feel
comfortable today against Santa
Clara, as Stanford travels to Buck
Shaw Stadium for a 3 p.m. game with
the Broncos.
Wassenaar, 8-2 with a 5.85 ERA,
had a rough outing against Santa
Clara on April 30.
