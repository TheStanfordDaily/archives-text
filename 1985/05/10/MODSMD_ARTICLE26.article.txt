# Cardinal women's track at WCAA meet
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Staff sportswriter 
Entering this weekend's Western
Collegiate Athletic Association
championships, the Stanford
women's track team will try to uphold
— but more likely will relinquish —
its three-year title reign to an im
mensely talented host UCLA squad.
It is the consensus opinion of the
WCAA track coaches that the Bruins
should walk away with this year's
championship unless "they com
pletely blow it," as Cardinal Asst.
Coach Dave Wollman put it.
According to Wollman, UCLA
Olympian Jackie Joiner is an "easy
60-point team by herself," coming in
as a favorite in five different events —
the long jump, high jump, triple
jump, 400-meter hurdles and, finally,
the heptathlon.
What's worse is that the Bruins
have more. To accompany Joiner,
UCLA boasts an outstanding sprint
ing corps that is strong from the 100
up to the 400 meters.
In addition, UCLA brings in excel
lent relay teams, perhaps the final
touch to a team that Wollman
believes is the odds-on favorite to win
the NCAA championship as well.
"The loss of Ceci Hopp and Cory
Schubert, the bulk of our distance
crew, really hurt our chances," Wol
lman said. "We come in as under

dogs. The kids will have to out-prove
our expectations."
Though Wollman is part of the vast
majority to bet on the Bruins, he does
good-naturedly concede that "if the
meet was meant to be played on
paper, then no one would show up,"
or just ask Georgetown Basketball
Coach John Thompson about being
an overwhelming favorite.
Realistically, Stanford will hope for
a second-place finish, a task that will
not be easy. Wollman expects the
battle for second to be "a dogfight"
between the five remaining confer
ence teams, a conference that Woll
man considers "by far the best in the
country."
Bolstering the Cardinal chances
will be senior standouts Ellen Lyons
and Regina Jacobs. Jacobs has a
strong opportunity to secure both the
800- and 1,500-meter titles, and
Lyons has a legimate shot at winning
both the 5,000 and the 10,000
meters, Wollman said.
Stanford discus thrower Karen
Nickerson also shows promising pos
sibility of nailing down first place,
though her path will no doubt be
impeded by San Diego State Olym
pian Laura DeSnoo.
Perhaps the Cardinal's biggest dark
horse could be distance runner
