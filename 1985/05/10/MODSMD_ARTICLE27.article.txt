# Stanford tennis teams join for mixed match with Cal
## 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's and women's tennis
teams will combine to play California's men's
and women's teams in a rare indoor exhibi
tion match at Maples Pavilion tomorrow
night.
The Mixed Team Match, as it is called, will
consist of six sets, beginning and ending with
mixed doubles. The match begins at 7 p.m.
and will be played on a carpet-covered bas
ketball floor in Maples.
"Relaxing" is the term used to describe the
event by both Stanford Coach Dick Gould
and Cal Coach Bill Wright.
"The whole thing is really quick, fun and
relaxing," Gould said "You don't have to sit
through match after match — everything is
fast-moving and fun."
Leading off for the Cardinal will be John
Letts and Patty Fendick. Letts, who did not
play UCLA in this season's first indoor
match, said at the time he enjoys the fast style
of play on the carpet, and the "crowd
pleasing" aspect of indoor tennis at Maples.
Four other men's team members will play
tomorrow, including Dan Goldie, Eric Rosen
feld, Derrick Rostagno and Pat McEnroe.
Goldie and Rosenfeld will play men's doubles
against Cal's Don Lioni and Chris Schoop di
rectly after the first mixed doubles set.
The third and fourth sets will feature three

members of Stanford's No. 1-ranked women's
team. Senior Linda Gates, ranked 18th na
tionally, will play singles in what will be her
final collegiate appearance at Stanford.
Following Gates will be sophomore Stepha
nie Savides and freshman Cari Hagey in
doubles. Savides regularly plays No. 4 singles
and No. 3 doubles for the Cardinal. Hagey, on
the other hand, will be playing only the
second match since early in the season after
being sidelined for some time with a bad right
shoulder.
The fifth set will highlight Derrick Ros
tagno in men's singles, while McEnroe and
Leigh Anne Eldredge will close out the even
ing with the second mixed doubles match.
Rostagno will play Steve DeVries in men's
singles for the second year in a row. DeVries
got the better of him, 6-4, in last year's set.
Since then, however, Rostagno has played
and defeated DeVries.
"I beat him (6-4, 6-1) in an Olympic qual
fying tournament in New York at the end of
last year, so it's more his turn to catch up,"
Rostagno said.
As far as playing indoors is concerned, Ros
tagno said the conditions are very different,
but "fun" for the same reason.
"The ball is harder to see because of the
lighting," he said. "The bounce is different,
too. The basketball floor is easy to move on,
but sometimes you find yourself bouncing and

moving when you don't want to be.
"It's really fun to play in front of a crowd if
they're into it — just like the UCLA and USC
crowds. I'm looking forward to it as a good
change. 1 usually have a lot of fun."
Tickets arc $1 if purchased in advance at
the Athletic Department, and $3 at the gate.
Last year, Stanford had no difficulty with
the Bears, winning five of six sets en route to a
34-18 victory. The score reflects the games
won by each team.
Three women and four of the men from this
year's teams played in that match last year.
Fendick had led off the match in mixed
doubles with Rosenfeld, and the pair
responded by defeating Chris Schoop and
Mary Margaret Torres, 6-2.
Letts played the men's doubles match last
time, teaming with Jim Grabb to down Peter
Wright and Eduardo Estaban by another 6-2
score.
Gates teamed up with Elise Burgin, with
whom she won the NCAA doubles crown last
year, to record an easy 6-1 victory.
After Rostagno dropped his set with
DeVries, El dredge teamed with Mark
McKeen in what was the best match of the
evening. With the set against Harold Hecht
and Stacy Savides tied at 5-5, Eldredge served
an ace to make it 6-5, and the Cardinal duo
closed out the evening with a 7-5 triumph.
