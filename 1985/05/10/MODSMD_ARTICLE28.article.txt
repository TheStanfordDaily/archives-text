# Modesto meet a qualifier for Cardinal men's track
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Staff sportswriter 
As the track season winds down to a close — with
Pacific 10 Conference championships only two weeks
away — the Stanford men's track team will try to add
more athletes to its list of Pac-10 and NCAA qualifiers
this weekend at the Modesto Relays.
With such track notables as Carl Lewis and Steve Scott
competing, the Modesto Relays, considered to be one of
the top invitationals on the West Coast, should provide a
"chance to get into some high-caliber competition," ac
cording to Cardinal sophomore Marc Olesen, who is
looking to qualify for the NCAAs in the 1,500 meters,
along with teammate Jeff Atkinson.
In such a prestigious meet, where the times will most
likely be faster in all running events, Olesen believes that
there is a tendency "to slightly run over your head," which
could prove beneficial for would-be Stanford qualifiers.

Last year, Olesen said he wasted little time but lots of
energy when he qualified for the NCAA 1,500 meters in
early April. This year, however, Olesen has changed strat
egies, training hard in the midseason, then waiting for the
season's end to claim his NCAA qualifying times.
"If you run real hard early in the season, you definitely
fade off late in the season," Olesen said. "Last year, I
peaked too early in the season. This is the week to do it —
hopefully, just a matter of time."
To accompany his breakaway kick that usually changes
a seemingly close race into a rout, Olesen hopes that the
1,500-meter field will set a fast early pace that should be
the final catalyst to garner that elusive NCAA qualifica
tion.
Other Stanford hopefuls include steeplechasers Ryan
Stoll and Brian Pettingill, who are both hovering around
the NCAA 3,000-meter steeplechase qualifying time, ap
proximately 8.3 seconds off the pace.
