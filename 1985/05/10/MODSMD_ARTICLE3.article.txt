Stanford Medical Center has received a $12 mil
lion gift from the Arnold and Mabel Beckman
Foundation to be used toward the construction of
a new $50 million Center for Molecular and Ge
netic Medicine, the medical center announced yes
terday.
The announcement was made during a medical
center press conference by the foundation's foun
der, Dr. Arnold Beckman, chairman of Beckman
Instruments. The biochemistry laboratories in the
new center are to be named after the Beckmans.
Beckman, whose foundation is based in Corona
Del Mar, is a leading scientist whose firm
pioneered the development of precision instru
ments, such as Ph meters. Those meters measure
acidity, and they are widely used in medicine, sci
ence and industry.
"At the press conference, it was mentioned that
early genetic findings were aided by instruments
made by Beckman," said Mike Goodkind, medical
center news director. "A full circle has been made
now that Dr. Beckman has donated his money to
support additional research in the field."
In a pre-released statement, Beckman an
nounced that his purpose in donating the money to
the medical center is "to help guarantee that bio
chemistry at Stanford will remain strong and be able

to contribute to the next revolution of biomedical
advances.
"A large part of the impetus of the genetic revo
lution grew out of the research in biochemistry at
Stanford, under the leadership of (Biochemistry
Profs.) Arthur Kornberg and Paul Berg," Beck
man's statement said.
"Beckman has an admiration for Berg and
Kornberg," said Spyros Andreopoulos, director of
communications at the medical center. "I think he
wanted to ensure the excellence of the Biochemistry
Department and the continuity of its research. He
donated the money out of a tremendous admiration
for the Department of Biochemistry, and for Stan
ford in general."
University President Donald Kennedy also an
nounced at the press conference that the Howard
Hughes Medical Institute has committed $17 mil
lion in advance lease payments to aid in the con
struction of laboratories within the new center. The
laboratories will comprise a "discrete unit for
molecular and genetic medicine," according to
Andreopoulos.
"The Hughes laboratory is the other part of the
equation," Andreopoulos said. "The Hughes unit
is pivotal to the whole center. It will deal with the
problem of how basic advances made in the labora
tory can be translated to patients."
In a prepared statement, Kennedy praised the

center's role as an innovative outlet for scientists to
bridge the gap between biomedical discoveries and
clinical applications.
"The concept of this center represents not only a
new and interesting approach to science, but an in
strumental experiment in technological transfer,"
Kennedy's statement said.
Berg said, "It's natural that it (the establishment
of the center) should happen here. In addition to its
sciencc strengths, the character of the medical
school permits a contiguity of medical expression
with clinical science."
Berg, winner of a Nobel Prize in biochemistry,
will direct the new center's efforts in multidiscipli
nary research.
M.B.T. Associates, a San Francisco architectural
firm, is currently drawing plans for the new cen
ter, according to Andreopoulos.
The site of the new center will be west of the
medical center, next to the Fairchild Building.
"The site now occupied by temporary wooden
buildings and the Department of Psychiatry will be
the site for the new center," according to
Andreopoulos.
"A new office building will be built by the
cancer-biology building. It is to be completed
sometime this fall.
