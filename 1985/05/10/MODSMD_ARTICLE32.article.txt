NEW YORK (AP) — Major
League Baseball Commissioner Peter
Ueberroth said yesterday he believed
in the innocence of players who tes
tified before a Pittsburgh grand jury
investigating possible drug trafficking
involving major league baseball
players.
About a dozen major leaguers have
been granted immunity and testified
before the federal grand jury. The
group includes Lonnie Smith of the
St. Louis Cardinals, Tim Raines of
the Montreal Expos and Rod Scurry
of the Pittsburgh Pirates — all of
whom went through rehabilitation for
chemical dependency problems.
Others who appeared before the
grand jury included Al Holland and
Lee Mazzilli of the Pirates; ex-Pirates
Lee Lacy, now with the Baltimore
Orioles, and Dale Berra, now with
the New York Yankees; Keith Her
nandez of the New York Mets; and
Enos Cabell of the Houston Astros.
Holland appeared just a day after
being traded by Philadelphia to the
Pirates.
The commissioner would not say if
he has talked with federal authorities

involved in the Pittsburgh probe. "I
will tell you, though, that I feel the
players who testified are innocent,"
he said.
Ueberroth said he hoped to have a
drug program including mandatory
testing for all baseball personnel ex
cept major league players in place
within one month.
"It's a sensitive issue," the commis
sioner said. "I want to collect a
couple of missing links on the pro
gram. I'd like to get all the details to
gether before discussing it further.
"One of the things both the
players' association and the Player
Relations Committee asked was to
give them the details first, not to air it
out. That's what I'm going to do."
Ueberroth would not respond to
the charge by Don Fehr, acting exec
utive director of the Major League
Baseball Players Association, that the
mandatory testing plan was
"grandstanding."
"I don't want to extend the story,"
he said. "It's not in my interest to ex
tend the story until we're ready with
announcements. I don't think it's
proper to get into responses."
