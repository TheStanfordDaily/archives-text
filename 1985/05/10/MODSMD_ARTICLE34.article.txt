# Card women's JV crew hosts Santa Clara varsity
## 
### KEITH SEINFELD 
The Stanford women's crew
hopes its final home meet of
the season will serve as a
launching pad. Tomorrow morning's
race, pitting the Cardinal junior var
sity against Santa Clara's varsity,
comes just one week before the all
important Pacific Coast Rowing
Championships.
Racing begins at 10 a.m. tomorrow
at Redwood Shores, Stanford's home
on the Bay. There are three races
scheduled in the dual meet.
Coach John Davis expects tough
competition for his third-ranked JVs
from the Broncos' varsity. "We had
an inspirational victory at Oregon
State last week, and Santa Clara
should be excellent preparation for
the Pacific Coasts," he said.

The top two teams in each division
at the championships will go on to the
Collegiate Nationals in June. An
other team could also go if the na
tional committee issues a third invita
tion. This means the Cardinal will
probably have to beat second-ranked
California to advance.
The Pacific Coasts and beating Cal
are big goals regardless of the nation
als, according to sophomore Joi
Hinkson.
"The Pac-Coasts are the culmina
tion of our season, and our goal there
is to win," she said. But she added
that the championships are very in
tense, saying, "If any one of the nine
people in the boat doesn't believe
we're going to win, we probably
won't."

The junior varsity crew has worked
especially hard this season, Davis
said, because most of them moved up all
the way from last year's second
novice crew.
He feels "pretty confident" going
into the Pacific Coasts about both the
varsity and the JVs. Washington is
ranked first, Cal second, and Stanford
third in both divisions. The Huskies
are traditionally the team to beat
both regionally and nationally.
The Pacific Coast Championships
will be held at Lake Natoma, near
Sacramento, May 18 and 19. The
Women's Collegiate Nationals will be
June 1 and 2 at Springfield, Va.
As for the rivalry with Berkeley,
Hinkson says, "Cal is a team we need
to beat, Washington is a goal."
