## Spare no expense when dining at the Castle 
### 
Julius Castle
1541 Montgomery St.
San Francisco
362-3042
The main point of many restaurant
reviews is to determine whether the
restaurant in question is worth the
money. Certainly, that determination
is important to most diners.
But sometimes, the economics of a
restaurant are secondary. Such res
taurants have redeeming qualities
that far outweigh whatever price you
pay.
Such a restaurant is Julius Castle,
perched high on Telegraph Hill just
below Coit Tower.
The Castle has sat on a seemingly
precarious ledge overlooking the Bay
since 1923. And in a city where great
views are nearly a prerequisite, the
one there is absolutely gorgeous, with
a clear sight of everything from
Hayward to Angel Island.
The restaurant, which serves a
mixture of French and Italian cuisine,
is located at the end of a residential
section of Montgomery and looks
fairly small as you drive toward the
entrance. The main part of the build
ing runs along the hill and can't be
seen from the entrance.
The first floor, where the bar and
cashier are located, is fairly unim
pressive. But as you reach the top
of the stairs and enter the dining area,
the beauty of the restaurant unfolds.
Facing the Bay is a wall made up
almost entirely of windows. Aside
from a couple of medium-sized chan
deliers, the room is unadorned with
anything that would qualify as gawdy
or excessive. Some small wood car
vings are dispersed on the redwood
and maple-paneled walls. The
furniture is likewise tasteful, blending

into the background rather than call
ing attention to itself.
The patrons of the Castle are
likewise unobtrusive. As romantic as
the atmosphere could be, it can also
be quite staid. Most of the diners are
40 years old or older, and when the
waiters refer to them as "doctor" (as
in "thank you, doctor" or "good
night, doctor"), you get a good per
ception of the type of people who fre
quent the Castle.
But the suit-and-tie crowd
shouldn't get in the way of romance
or fun. The man sitting at the table
next to ours said all of about three
words to his wife and her mother, but
the couple across the room held
hands and looked at each other in a
dreamy, cliche fashion.
A large number of high schoolers
were there as part of prom night ac
tivities, which wasn't at all bother
some but rather humorous. Seeing
people in formal wear is proof that
tuxedos should only come in black or
white and that the "Cinderella" look
is ghastly.
While you watch your fellow cus
tomers, a couple of drinks will do.
The cocktails were strong, but the
grapefruit juice in my Greyhound
wasn't fresh, unless the bartender did
a good job straining it.
A friend of mine suggested that this
would be a wonderful place to go
have a drink or two during the day
and take in the view. 1 agree, espe
cially considering that the drinks are
about the same price as at any bar.
For hors d'oeuvres, we ordered the
jumbo prawns sauteed in a lemon,
butter and garlic sauce (Gamberi
Luigi Nono, $5.75), and the house
pate ($4.75).
Although the prawns are a fairly
basic dish, the sauce was excellent. A

typical lemon, butter and garlic sauce
is overpowered by one of the in
gredients. This sauce was not tart
from the lemon, strong from the gar
lic or bland from the butter. The
prawns were fresh.
The pate was well spiced, but
likewise not too strong. It's served
with toasted white bread. Uneventful
but good. For connoisseurs, there is
an imported goose liver pate (Pale de
Foie Crus Truffe, $15).
Among the other hors d'oeuvres
are smoked salmon, freshly shucked
Blue Point oysters, escargots, caviar
and fetuccine alfredo, ranging from
$5.75 to $9. The servings are suffi
cient for two, but if you have a hearty
appetite you could easily finish one
by youself.
The two of us split an avocado, bay
shrimp and vinaigrette salad ($6.50).
The shrimps were fresh, as expected,
and the avocado was perfectly ripe
and unbruised. The best part,
however, was the vinaigrette, which
mixed well with the rich taste of the
avocado and the sweet taste of the
shrimp. The white wine vinegar was
just a tinge too sharp.
The remainder of the salads in
clude the usual mixed green salad, a
Caesar salad (for two or more at
$5.50 per person) and various others,
ranging from $3.75 to $6.50.
The Castle features three soups: a
soup of the day, Bermuda onion and
consomme with bone marrow, green
onions and poached eggyolk. Not an
unusual variety, but probably not
predictable.
Wine with your meal could be a fun
experiment, especially if you're a
connoisseur and have the money for
it. The wine list consists of more than
100 varieties, ranging from a 1982
Gamay Beaujolaise ($l2 a bottle) to

a 1944 Lafite Rothchild (the rough
equivalent of a meal plan at $700 to
uncork).
Some people might call the list
pretentious (especially if they don't
carry them all), but if you want to find
out what an expensive bottle of wine
tastes like, this is the place. The
Castle also carries my favorite (yet in
frequently tasted) champagne,
Schramsberg.
For dinner, I had the sauteed veal
filets and mushroom caps in a pink
peppercorn sauce (Mignonnettes de
Veau au Poivre Rose, $19.50), while
my friend had the broiled New York
sirloin steak with the bordelaise sauce
($19.50).
Once again, what made both dishes

wonderful were the sauces. The veal
itself was tender and excellent, but
the sauce of veal stock, wine and pep
percorns was a delicious complement
that did not overpower the taste of
the meat.
The basic result was the same with
the steak, although for different
reasons. Most steak tends to he
cooked correctly (as expected) and
served in a light beef stock sauce. The
bourdelaise was an excellent comple
ment because it was strong and didn't
get lost with the distinct flavor of the
meat.
Among the other entrees are a fine
selection of seafood dishes (from
scallops sauteed in eggbutter and
lemon sauce to grilled filet of sole or

abalone), a plethora of beef dishes, a
roast duck dish (which the table next
to us had and looked wonderful) and
the usual specialties. The dishes range
from $14.50 to $19.50 (although
some dishes designed for two people,
like the roast duck, run up to $39.50).
For dessert we shaied a chocolate
tort, which was a mistake after a big
meal. The tort was very rich and the
liquer used in it was very strong. Not
a good way to top off this meal.
If you're feeling very romantic,
have a special occasion coming up or
your parents are willing to fit the bill
for a good dinner in the city, Julius
Castle would be an ideal choice.

The patrons of the Castle are
likewise unobtrusive. As romantic as
the atmosphere could be, it can also
be quite staid. Most of the diners are
40 years old or older, and when the
waiters refer to them as "doctor" (as
in "thank you, doctor" or "good
night, doctor"), you get a good per
ception of the type of people who fre
quent the Castle.
But the suit-and-tie crowd
shouldn't get in the way of romance
or fun. The man sitting at the table
next to ours said all of about three
words to his wife and her mother, but
the couple across the room held
hands and looked at each other in a
dreamy, cliche fashion.
A large number of high schoolers
were there as part of prom night ac
tivities, which wasn't at all bother
some but rather humorous. Seeing
people in formal wear is proof that
tuxedos should only come in black or
white and that the "Cinderella" look
is ghastly.
While you watch your fellow cus
tomers, a couple of drinks will do.
The cocktails were strong, but the
grapefruit juice in my Greyhound
wasn't fresh, unless the bartender did
a good job straining it.
A friend of mine suggested that this
would be a wonderful place to go
have a drink or two during the day
and take in the view. 1 agree, espe
cially considering that the drinks are
about the same price as at any bar.
For hors d'oeuvres, we ordered the
jumbo prawns sauteed in a lemon,
butter and garlic sauce (Gamberi
Luigi Nono, $5.75), and the house
pate ($4.75).
Although the prawns are a fairly
basic dish, the sauce was excellent. A

typical lemon, butter and garlic sauce
is overpowered by one of the in
gredients. This sauce was not tart
from the lemon, strong from the gar
lic or bland from the butter. The
prawns were fresh.
The pate was well spiced, but
likewise not too strong. It's served
with toasted white bread. Uneventful
but good. For connoisseurs, there is
an imported goose liver pate (Pale de
Foie Crus Truffe, $15).
Among the other hors d'oeuvres
are smoked salmon, freshly shucked
Blue Point oysters, escargots, caviar
and fetuccine alfredo, ranging from
$5.75 to $9. The servings are suffi
cient for two, but if you have a hearty
appetite you could easily finish one
by youself.
The two of us split an avocado, bay
shrimp and vinaigrette salad ($6.50).
The shrimps were fresh, as expected,
and the avocado was perfectly ripe
and unbruised. The best part,
however, was the vinaigrette, which
mixed well with the rich taste of the
avocado and the sweet taste of the
shrimp. The white wine vinegar was
just a tinge too sharp.
The remainder of the salads in
clude the usual mixed green salad, a
Caesar salad (for two or more at
$5.50 per person) and various others,
ranging from $3.75 to $6.50.
The Castle features three soups: a
soup of the day, Bermuda onion and
consomme with bone marrow, green
onions and poached eggyolk. Not an
unusual variety, but probably not
predictable.
Wine with your meal could be a fun
experiment, especially if you're a
connoisseur and have the money for
it. The wine list consists of more than
100 varieties, ranging from a 1982
Gamay Beaujolaise ($l2 a bottle) to

a 1944 Lafite Rothchild (the rough
equivalent of a meal plan at $700 to
uncork).
Some people might call the list
pretentious (especially if they don't
carry them all), but if you want to find
out what an expensive bottle of wine
tastes like, this is the place. The
Castle also carries my favorite (yet in
frequently tasted) champagne,
Schramsberg.
For dinner, I had the sauteed veal
filets and mushroom caps in a pink
peppercorn sauce (Mignonnettes de
Veau au Poivre Rose, $19.50), while
my friend had the broiled New York
sirloin steak with the bordelaise sauce
($19.50).
Once again, what made both dishes

wonderful were the sauces. The veal
itself was tender and excellent, but
the sauce of veal stock, wine and pep
percorns was a delicious complement
that did not overpower the taste of
the meat.
The basic result was the same with
the steak, although for different
reasons. Most steak tends to he
cooked correctly (as expected) and
served in a light beef stock sauce. The
bourdelaise was an excellent comple
ment because it was strong and didn't
get lost with the distinct flavor of the
meat.
Among the other entrees are a fine
selection of seafood dishes (from
scallops sauteed in eggbutter and
lemon sauce to grilled filet of sole or

abalone), a plethora of beef dishes, a
roast duck dish (which the table next
to us had and looked wonderful) and
the usual specialties. The dishes range
from $14.50 to $19.50 (although
some dishes designed for two people,
like the roast duck, run up to $39.50).
For dessert we shaied a chocolate
tort, which was a mistake after a big
meal. The tort was very rich and the
liquer used in it was very strong. Not
a good way to top off this meal.
If you're feeling very romantic,
have a special occasion coming up or
your parents are willing to fit the bill
for a good dinner in the city, Julius
Castle would be an ideal choice.

Julius Castle sits near the top of Telegraph Hill in San Francisco, where it has offered diners a spectacular
view of the Bay Area and excellent food since opening in 1923.
Julius Castle
1541 Montgomery St.
San Francisco
362-3042
The main point of many restaurant
reviews is to determine whether the
restaurant in question is worth the
money. Certainly, that determination
is important to most diners.
But sometimes, the economics of a
restaurant are secondary. Such res
taurants have redeeming qualities
that far outweigh whatever price you
pay.
Such a restaurant is Julius Castle,
perched high on Telegraph Hill just
below Coit Tower.
The Castle has sat on a seemingly
precarious ledge overlooking the Bay
since 1923. And in a city where great
views are nearly a prerequisite, the
one there is absolutely gorgeous, with
a clear sight of everything from
Hayward to Angel Island.
The restaurant, which serves a
mixture of French and Italian cuisine,
is located at the end of a residential
section of Montgomery and looks
fairly small as you drive toward the
entrance. The main part of the build
ing runs along the hill and can't be
seen from the entrance.
The first floor, where the bar and
cashier are located, is fairly unim
pressive. But as you reach the top
of the stairs and enter the dining area,
the beauty of the restaurant unfolds.
Facing the Bay is a wall made up
almost entirely of windows. Aside
from a couple of medium-sized chan
deliers, the room is unadorned with
anything that would qualify as gawdy
or excessive. Some small wood car
vings are dispersed on the redwood
and maple-paneled walls. The
furniture is likewise tasteful, blending

into the background rather than call
ing attention to itself.
The patrons of the Castle are
likewise unobtrusive. As romantic as
the atmosphere could be, it can also
be quite staid. Most of the diners are
40 years old or older, and when the
