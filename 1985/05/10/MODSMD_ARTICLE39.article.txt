## Paradise found: Sako's fine food 
### 
Sako's
340 University Ave.
Palo Alio
321-1037
Frankly, the place is a hole in the
wall. Occupying a space even smaller
than most dorm rooms, Sako's con
sists of a tiny kitchen, a refrigerated
display case, a counter and nothing
more.
Nothing more, that is, except one
of the most fabulous chefs in the Bay
Area, who provides some of the best
food ever to be found.
My friend and I selected chicken
Creole and crab croquettes (each
$3.85) for our entrees, and found
them to have specific, well
articulated tastes, rather than the
bland, indistiguishable-from-sawdust
tastes so often found in continental
restaurants.
Crab meat rolled in a seasoned
breadcrumb mixture, lightly fried and
draped with a smooth, lemony sauce,
the crab croquettes were delicious.
The delicate taste of the crab was
masked by neither spices nor sauce.
The chicken Creole was also excel
lent. Chunks of chicken, vegetables

and shrimp mingled in a tomato sauce
rich with herbs. The clearly distin
guishable taste of each ingredient and
the subtle influence of these tastes on
one another formed the basis for the
notable quality of this dish.
Other entrees include beef Bur
gundy ($3.85), lamb curry ($3.95),
stuffed chicken breast ($3.85) and

in the Bay Area.

butterfly trout ($3.75). Entrees in
clude green salad and choice of
potato or pasta salad.
The potato salad, containing a min
imum of dressing and a maximum of
potatoes, seemed to identify more
with the spuds than with the salads.
This side dish had just enough
seasoning to add extra flavor and
achieved a fresh taste, largely owing
to the enormous chunks of >otato.

In contrast, the pasta salad was
loaded with spices and artichoke
hearts, as well as with corkscrews of
pasta. A number of distinct tastes are
detectable in a single mouthful of
salad, and the result is a wonderful
dish.
The chef and owner of this tiny res
taurant is Sako Fusako Nakano, an
equally tiny woman with seemingly
unlimited energy.
Sako's is a one-woman operation.
Looking like a favorite aunt, Sako
smiles as she cooks in her kitchen
and takes orders from her customers.
She cooks everything from scratch,
disdaining the use of shortcut con
veniences that short-change quality.
Her culinary experience is exten
sive and varied. She has served as
a private chef for Swiss and Italian
diplomats in Japan after World War
11. As a chef in the Italian embassy in
Tokyo, she learned the regional
specialties of both southern and
northern Italy.
In 1967, Sako came to the United
States and became the chef for the
Wallace Sterling family. She has also
been the chef at the Bay Window res
taurant, where she received in

numerable compliments for her food.
Several years ago, she opened
Sako's. A desire for independence
and closer interaction with the cus
tomers were among the reasons for
starting her own venture, Sako said.
"1 like people," she explained.
Her friendliness is directed at all
people, with smiles, laughter and acts
of generosity. One person I know
went to Sako's for the first time last
Saturday, and after the meal Sako
gave him and his companions a com
plimentary platter of fresh straw
berries.
The place really is a hole in the
wall, but it shines with the joy Sako
takes in her work and reflects the
lively sparkle in her eyes. And it has
her distinctively wonderful food.
Sako's is open Mondays through
Fridays from 11 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.,
Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.
and is closed on Sundays.
Sako also does surprisingly inex
pensive catering, from small, intimate
dinner parties to full-course dinner
banquets for 100. All in all, Sako's is
a culinary paradise found.
