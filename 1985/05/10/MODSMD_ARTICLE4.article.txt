## Small model stolen from museum 
### MICHAEL GOFF Editorial staff 
A Rodin sculpture valued some
where between $2,500 and $10,000
was stolen from the Stanford Univer
sity Museum of Art last weekend.
The Daily learned yesterday. Stan
ford Police Chief Marvin Herrington
said there are currently no clues,
leads or suspects in the case.
The piece, an 18-inch-tall model
for the full si/e "Jean de Fiennes"
statue now in Memorial Court, was
reported missing Sunday by Albert
Elscn, curator of the Rodin collection
at Stanford and professor of art his
tory here. According to Herrington.
the value of the piece, one of the
"Burghers of Calais." initially was re
ported to be $ 10.000. but that figure
was recently changed to $2,500.
Herrington said all evidence points
to "someone who knew the setup."
Construction on the Rodin collec
tion's rotunda has forced the museum
to alter its alarm system, and entry
was relatively easy because an outside
door to the rotunda was under con
struction. Herrington said. He called
the temporary alarm system a " jerry
rigged operation." saying the thief

"only had plastic to cut through" to
get inside.
Herrington said he is hopeful the
sculpture will be returned. He said.
"We have gotten the word out to the
art world. ... It will be very difficult
tor the individual to do anything with
it" because to sell it for anything near
what it is valued, the thief would have
to go to a major art dealer.
"I hope the individual puts it some
where we can recover it" when he
discovers the statue cannot be sold.
Herrington said. "The saddest thing
would be if they just threw it away."
he said.
Police responded to a museum
alarm lasting only two minutes at
9:30 p.m. Saturday, and Herrington
said this may have been the time of
the robbery. He said the investigating
officer noticed nothing missing, pos
sibly because of the disorder caused
by museum construction.
Herrington said the museum
should have notified the police of the
altered alarm system and the con
struction. both of which threatened
museum security. Since the robberv.

Museum, according to Stanford police.
the alarm system at the museum has
been improved, and, Herrington said,
"in the future, we'll be more aware of
construction" on campus.
When first contacted for a com
ment yesterday afternoon, Lorenz
Eitner, director of the museum and
chairman of the Art Department, said
he wasn't sure whether a robbery had
taken place at the museum."lt's
something I'll have to check on," he
said. Later, Eitner admitted he' did

know of the theft, but said, "I don't
recall when I was notified." Eitner
then said he had no further comment.
Elsen is out of town and is un
available for comment until tomor
row morning, according to his wife.
This is not the first time Stanford
Museum pieces have been stolen.
Within a period of three days in May
1974, thieves stole a Ch'ing Dynasty
vase worth $15,000 and 12 netsuke,
tiny Japanese ivory clothing orna
ments, worth $2,400.
In 1975, 40 rare coins, with a
nominal value of $28,000, were
stolen, then returned a year later.
