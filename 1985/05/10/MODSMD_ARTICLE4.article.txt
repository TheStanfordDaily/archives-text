# Burglar pilfers Rodin sculpture
## Small model stolen from museum 
### MICHAEL GOFF Editorial staff 
A Rodin sculpture valued some
where between $2,500 and $10,000
was stolen from the Stanford Univer
sity Museum of Art last weekend.
The Daily learned yesterday. Stan
ford Police Chief Marvin Herrington
said there are currently no clues,
leads or suspects in the case.
The piece, an 18-inch-tall model
for the full si/e "Jean de Fiennes"
statue now in Memorial Court, was
reported missing Sunday by Albert
Elscn, curator of the Rodin collection
at Stanford and professor of art his
tory here. According to Herrington.
the value of the piece, one of the
"Burghers of Calais." initially was re
ported to be $ 10.000. but that figure
was recently changed to $2,500.
Herrington said all evidence points
to "someone who knew the setup."
Construction on the Rodin collec

to alter its alarm system, and entry
was relatively easy because an outside
door to the rotunda was under con
struction. Herrington said. He called
the temporary alarm system a " jerry
rigged operation." saying the thief

"only had plastic to cut through" to
get inside.
Herrington said he is hopeful the
sculpture will be returned. He said.
"We have gotten the word out to the
art world. ... It will be very difficult
tor the individual to do anything with
it" because to sell it for anything near
what it is valued, the thief would have
to go to a major art dealer.
"I hope the individual puts it some
where we can recover it" when he
discovers the statue cannot be sold.
Herrington said. "The saddest thing
would be if they just threw it away."
he said.
Police responded to a museum
alarm lasting only two minutes at
9:30 p.m. Saturday, and Herrington
said this may have been the time of
the robbery. He said the investigating
officer noticed nothing missing, pos
sibly because of the disorder caused
by museum construction.
Herrington said the museum
should have notified the police of the
altered alarm system and the con
struction. both of which threatened
museum security. Since the robberv.
