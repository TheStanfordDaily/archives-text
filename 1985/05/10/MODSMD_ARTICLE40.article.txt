84 (1963)
U.C.Theater, Berkeley
Or, The Price of Fame. Federico Fel
lini's dream revue about a famous film
director whose self-doubts result in a cre
ative block concerns itself with how great
filmmakers turn their own fantasies and
the unresolved shreds of their lives into
art. This self-proclaiming autobigoraphy
has more glamor than pain in it, however,
and it has a handsome movie star in the
"Fellini" role — Marcello Mastroianni.
Some of the sequences are extraor
dinarily compelling (and Gianni Di
Venanzo has shot them in gorgeous black
and white), but Fellini cheats on the am
biguous overlapping-levels-of-reality
structure by making all the supporting
characters, especially the adoring women,
so extravagantly absurd that you can't
take any of them seriously. Guido
(Mastroianni) is a questionable hero: his
sensitivity has such stringent limits (that
is, it's inner-directed) that one's sympa
thy for him may wane. This is a minority
opinion, however — "8 1/2" has won
over a dozen awards (including the Oscar
and the New York Film Critics' prize for
Best Foreign Film), is widely considered
a masterpiece, and has influenced many
important directors, among them Paul
Mazursky ("Bob and Carol and Ted and
Alice," "Alex in Wonderland"), Bob
Fosse ("All That Jazz") and Woody Al
len ("Stardust Memories"). With Anouk
Aimee, Sandra Milo, Claudia Cardinale
and Rossella Falk; script by Fellini, En
nio Flaiano, Tullio Pinelli and Brunello
Rondi.
Plays Wednesday with "L'Age d'Or."
Wait Until Dark (1967)
Kresge Auditorium
Terence Young's film of the Frederick
Knott play about a blind woman who ac
cidentally takes possession of a doll
packed with heroin and then finds herself
alone with the hoodlums who want it
back. It's a very simple premise, really —
and extremely effective. Much of the
credit for the tension in this film goes to
Audrey Hepburn, who plays the main
character. Alan Arkin, Richard Crenna,
Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. and Jack Weston co
star. Robert and Jane Howard did the
adaptation.
Plays tonight at 9.

The Flamingo Kid (1984)
Memorial Auditorium
A rite-of-passage comedy set in 1963.
Matt Dillon plays Jeffrey Willis, a teen
ager in quiet rebellion against his honest,
hard-working plumber father (Hector
Elizondo). Jeffrey's friends belong to
Jewish nouveaux riches families who
spend their summers at a beach club; his
landing a job there as a parking attendant
permits him to fall under the influence of
a wealthy, ostentatious cardsharp
(Richard Crenna) whose Willy Loman
like values begin to infect him. The movie
(by TV director Garry Marshall, from a
script he wrote with Neal Marshall) is far
from great, but the rapport between Hec
tor Elizondo and Matt Dillon is so good
that the picture expands in your mind
after you've seen it.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 & 9:30.
La Nuit de Varennes (1983)
Maison Francaise
For this picture, set on the eve of the
French Revolution, director Ettore Scola
must have had the most extravagant
budget of his career, but the picture dis
plays no extravagance of spirit — it's
respectably dull, an Italian equivalent to
the expensive history pageant movies
produced here and in England in the 60s.
The cast is such an unholy mix of
nationalities and acting styles — Jean-
Louis Barrault, Marcello Mastroianni,
Hanna Schuygulla, Harvey Keitel, Jean-
Claude Brialy, Andrea Ferreol — that a
director with any wit or imagination
would make comic use of the contrasts
between them, but except for
Mastroianni (who plays Casanova) no
one in it does anything you can recall a
month later.
Plays Thursday evening at 8.

Distant Thunder (1973)
U.C.Theater, Berkeley
Satyajit Ray's film, set during the
"man-made" famine of 1942-43, is about
pride and the effects of war. The leading
character (a brilliant performance by
Soumitra Chatterjee — one among many
he has given under Ray's direction) is a
Brahmin, painfully conscious of his re
sponsibility not to "lower himself in the

eyes of the lower castes. The "distant
thunder" of the title is World War II: The
Japanese have taken Burma, and so the
Indians cannot get the rice they need.
Ray tries a number of contrasting styles
in this film (a visual account of a food riot
is almost neo-realist), and some of them
fail; moreover, there is a subplot involv
ing a symbolically scar-faced man who
trades rice for sexual favors that plays
like Victorian melodrama. But on the

whole the film is magnificent, and
Soumendu Roy's photography (it was
Ray's first film in color) is very, very
beautiful.
Plays Monday with "Pather Panchali."
Pather Panchali (1955)
U.C.Theater, Berkeley
When Jean Renoir came to India in the
early 1950s to film "The River," Satyajit
Ray apprenticed with him and then went
on to make his first film: "Pather
Panchali (Song of the Road)," the first of
a trilogy based on the novels of Bibhuti
Bhushan Bandyopadhyay. Perhaps no
other director in the history of movies has
made such an astonishing debut. Subir
Banerjee plays the boy, Apu, who lives
with his mother (the extraordinary
actress Karuna Banerjee), his sister
(Champa Banerjee) and his wizened old
aunt (Chunibala Devi) in a Bengalese vil
lage; they live in poverty, and Apu's
father (Kanu Banerjee), a Brahmin,
spends most of his time travelling from
village to village, unable to support them.
Like his mentor, Renoir, Ray is an impas
sioned director, but he has a serene style:
moments of almost unbearable beauty
seem to be suspended like a painter's
images, yet you wouldn't call the film
painterly — it has an inexorable move
ment, but Ray's sense of time is so differ
ent from ours that you have to enter it
before you can begin to feel the flow of
the movie. The rewards of giving yourself
over to the experience of the film are very
great.
Plays Monday with "Distant
Thunder."
Twentieth Century (1934)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
Ben Hecht and Charles Mac Arthur
adapted this brilliant screwball comedy
from Charles Bruce Millholland's play
"Napoleon of Broadway," and Howard

Hawks directed, in the frantic, crack style
he would later use for "Bringing ' 'p
Baby" and "His Girl Friday." This
picture is not as well known as either of
the others, hut it's in the same league. As
the ruthless, tyrannical, egomaniacal
Broadway producer Oscar Jaffe, John
Barrymore gives a magnificent, full-scale
parodic performance; he. Hawks and the
script bring out the best in Carole Lom
bard, who plays Mildred Plotka, the
nobody he makes into a star (changing
her name to Lily Garland) and then
hounds mercilessly. These two are the ul
timate theatrical monsters, turning every
moment of their lives into extravagant
melodrama. The film is called "Twentieth
Century" because most of it takes place
on the famous train of that name that
crossed the continent in the 19305. The
extremely skillful supporting cast features
Roscoe Karns and Walter Connolly as
Jaffe's loyal associates, Ralph Forbes,
Charles Lane, Edgar Kennedy and, as the
meek lunatic, Etienne Girardot.
Plays Monday with "The Awful
Truth."
Modem Romance (1981)
York, San Francisco
Albert Brooks' style of comedy in this
film is so muted that you have to lean
closely into it before you can see what is
meant to be humorous, but if you link up
with it, it's almost unceasingly funny for
the first half. (Then it turns obnoxious.)
Brooks, who directed and co-authored
the script, plays Robert Cole, a film
editor who is breaking up with his girl
friend, Mary Harvard (Kathryn Harrold)
— sort of. The best scenes, like a
quaalude routine, are like Impressionist
lonesco. James L. Brooks, himself a com
edy writer, does a hilarious cameo as a
movie director who talks about his
crummy science-fiction epic as if it were
"Citizen Kane."
Plays Tuesday with "Real Life."

U.C.Theater, Berkeley
Or, The Price of Fame. Federico Fel
lini's dream revue about a famous film
director whose self-doubts result in a cre
ative block concerns itself with how great
filmmakers turn their own fantasies and
the unresolved shreds of their lives into
art. This self-proclaiming autobigoraphy
has more glamor than pain in it, however,
and it has a handsome movie star in the
"Fellini" role — Marcello Mastroianni.
Some of the sequences are extraor
dinarily compelling (and Gianni Di
Venanzo has shot them in gorgeous black
and white), but Fellini cheats on the am
biguous overlapping-levels-of-reality
structure by making all the supporting
characters, especially the adoring women,
so extravagantly absurd that you can't
take any of them seriously. Guido
(Mastroianni) is a questionable hero: his
sensitivity has such stringent limits (that
is, it's inner-directed) that one's sympa
thy for him may wane. This is a minority
opinion, however — "8 1/2" has won
over a dozen awards (including the Oscar
and the New York Film Critics' prize for
Best Foreign Film), is widely considered
a masterpiece, and has influenced many
important directors, among them Paul
Mazursky ("Bob and Carol and Ted and

Terence Young's film of the Frederick

The Flamingo Kid (1984)
Memorial Auditorium
A rite-of-passage comedy set in 1963.
Matt Dillon plays Jeffrey Willis, a teen

Elizondo). Jeffrey's friends belong to
Jewish nouveaux riches families who
spend their summers at a beach club; his
landing a job there as a parking attendant
permits him to fall under the influence of
a wealthy, ostentatious cardsharp
(Richard Crenna) whose Willy Loman
like values begin to infect him. The movie
(by TV director Garry Marshall, from a

For this picture, set on the eve of the

must have had the most extravagant
budget of his career, but the picture dis
plays no extravagance of spirit — it's
respectably dull, an Italian equivalent to
the expensive history pageant movies
produced here and in England in the 60s.
The cast is such an unholy mix of
nationalities and acting styles — Jean-
Louis Barrault, Marcello Mastroianni,
Hanna Schuygulla, Harvey Keitel, Jean-
Claude Brialy, Andrea Ferreol — that a
director with any wit or imagination
would make comic use of the contrasts

Distant Thunder (1973)
U.C.Theater, Berkeley
Satyajit Ray's film, set during the
"man-made" famine of 1942-43, is about
pride and the effects of war. The leading
character (a brilliant performance by
Soumitra Chatterjee — one among many
he has given under Ray's direction) is a
Brahmin, painfully conscious of his re
sponsibility not to "lower himself in the

eyes of the lower castes. The "distant
thunder" of the title is World War II: The
Japanese have taken Burma, and so the
Indians cannot get the rice they need.
Ray tries a number of contrasting styles
in this film (a visual account of a food riot
is almost neo-realist), and some of them
fail; moreover, there is a subplot involv
ing a symbolically scar-faced man who
trades rice for sexual favors that plays
like Victorian melodrama. But on the

whole the film is magnificent, and
Soumendu Roy's photography (it was
Ray's first film in color) is very, very
beautiful.
