# New board president?
## Christopher likely to succeed Kimball 
### TIM GRIEVE Editorial staff 
Warren Christopher, whom Cali
fornia magazine once called the
"quiet cardinal of California
lawyers," may soon find a new call
ing. The former deputy secretary of
state will likely become the next pres
ident of Stanford's Board of Trustees,
a source said yesterday.
The source, who spoke on the con
dition he not be named, said the
board's nominations committee has
decided to nominate Christopher,
managing partner at the Los Angeles
based law firm o'Melveny& Myers,
to succeed William Kimball as board
president.
The trustees will vote on Christop
her's nomination at their June
meeting, the source said, adding that
the board has never, in recent
memory, voted down a candidate
chosen by the nominations commit
tee.
Christopher, 59, a nine-year board
veteran who currently serves on the
board's academic affairs, nominations
and Hoover-Stanford committees,
said through his secretary yesterday
that he would have no comment on
the matter.
Others in the Stanford community
had high praise for the man many

credit with the safe return of 52
American hostages from Iran in
1981.
"1 think he is a terrific trustee,"
said Robert Freelen, the University's
vice president for public affairs.
Freelen would not confirm the nom
ination, but said he has enjoyed
working with Christopher on a num
ber of issues in the last two years.
Director of Development Commu
nication Dave Fulton, who, in his role
as staff for the board's nominations
committee, has worked with Chris
topher previously, said, "He is a
bright, well-organized man." Fulton
said Christopher has never indicated
to him any desire to make radical

changes in the operations of the
board.
When asked to compare Christop
her and Kimball, Freelen said: "I've
worked with them both. . . . One is a
lawyer and one is a businessman, and
that's a very fundamental dilter
ence." Freelen cited Christopher's
diplomatic experience as an asset,
calling him "one of the best listeners
I've ever encountered."
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons also said Christopher's
"talking and listening" skills will
prove valuable. "These are the
qualities that 1 hope he will bring to
the presidency," Lyons said.
When Christopher spoke at Stan
ford's Commencement in 1981, he
said talking "receives less attention
than it deserves."
"We may come to think we can
punish our adversaries by refusing to
talk â€” or by silence induce changes in
policies we deplore," Christopher
said in his Commencement address.
"But without talking, without
diplomacy, an essential instrument of
our national security is lost. ..."
"But talking can also tame conflict,
lift the human condition and move us
closer to the ideal of peace."
