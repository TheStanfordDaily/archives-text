# New board president?
## Christopher likely to succeed Kimball 
### TIM GRIEVE Editorial staff 
Warren Christopher, whom Cali
fornia magazine once called the
"quiet cardinal of California
lawyers," may soon find a new call
ing. The former deputy secretary of
state will likely become the next pres
ident of Stanford's Board of Trustees,
a source said yesterday.
The source, who spoke on the con
dition he not be named, said the
board's nominations committee has
decided to nominate Christopher,
managing partner at the Los Angeles
based law firm o'Melveny& Myers,
to succeed William Kimball as board
president.
The trustees will vote on Christop
her's nomination at their June
meeting, the source said, adding that
the board has never, in recent
memory, voted down a candidate
chosen by the nominations commit
tee.
Christopher, 59, a nine-year board
veteran who currently serves on the
board's academic affairs, nominations
and Hoover-Stanford committees,
said through his secretary yesterday
that he would have no comment on
the matter.
Others in the Stanford community
had high praise for the man many

credit with the safe return of 52
American hostages from Iran in
1981.
"1 think he is a terrific trustee,"
said Robert Freelen, the University's
vice president for public affairs.
Freelen would not confirm the nom
ination, but said he has enjoyed
working with Christopher on a num
ber of issues in the last two years.
Director of Development Commu
nication Dave Fulton, who, in his role
as staff for the board's nominations
committee, has worked with Chris
topher previously, said, "He is a
bright, well-organized man." Fulton
said Christopher has never indicated
to him any desire to make radical

changes in the operations of the
board.
When asked to compare Christop
her and Kimball, Freelen said: "I've
worked with them both. . . . One is a
lawyer and one is a businessman, and
that's a very fundamental dilter
ence." Freelen cited Christopher's
diplomatic experience as an asset,
calling him "one of the best listeners
I've ever encountered."
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons also said Christopher's
"talking and listening" skills will
prove valuable. "These are the
qualities that 1 hope he will bring to
the presidency," Lyons said.
When Christopher spoke at Stan
ford's Commencement in 1981, he
said talking "receives less attention
than it deserves."
"We may come to think we can
punish our adversaries by refusing to
talk — or by silence induce changes in
policies we deplore," Christopher
said in his Commencement address.
"But without talking, without
diplomacy, an essential instrument of
our national security is lost. ..."
"But talking can also tame conflict,
lift the human condition and move us
closer to the ideal of peace."


Warren Christopher
Likely to he board president
In a later speech, which Christop
her said would "round out the
picture" from his 1981 Commence
ment address, he said that certain en
during values are non-negotiable.
Among the qualities he listed were
"a sense of duty; honor — personal
honor, and honor among friends and
fellow workers; loyalty to country
and to cause; courage in adversity;
freedom for ourselves and others,
with an understanding that when
anyone loses freedom, we all lose
some of ours."
Before President Carter lost his re
election bid in 1980, it had been
rumored that Christopher would be
chosen to succeed Secretary of State
Cyrus Vance in a second Carter ad
ministration. In the No. 2 spot at the
State Department, Christopher had
earned a reputation as a man who
could keep his cool in the most diffi
cult of situations.
A 1980 article in The Washington
Post called Christopher " "Mr. Cool,'
'Mr. Human Rights,' and Cy Vance's
'alter ego.' "
Born in Scranton, N.D., Christop
her graduated magna cum laude from
the University of Southern California
in 1945. He served in active duty in
the Naval Reserve from 1943 to 1946,
before enrolling at Stanford Law
School, where he was president of the
law review.
After serving as a clerk to Supreme
Court Justice William Douglas,
Christopher joined O'Melveny
& Myers in 1950. In 1965
and 1966, Christopher was the
vice chairman of the commission that
investigated the Watts riots, and he
represented the Johnson administra
tion in cotton textile negotiations
with Japan. In 1967, Christopher left
O'Melveny & Myers for two years to
serve as deputy attorney general un
der Ramsey Clark.
Christopher is married to the
former Marie Wyllis, and he has four
children. His son Thomas graduated
from Stanford in 1980, and his
daughter Kristen graduated this year.

"We may come to think we can
punish our adversaries by refusing to
talk — or by silence induce changes in
policies we deplore," Christopher
said in his Commencement address.
"But without talking, without
diplomacy, an essential instrument of
our national security is lost. ..."
"But talking can also tame conflict,
lift the human condition and move us
closer to the ideal of peace."


Warren Christopher
Likely to he board president
In a later speech, which Christop
her said would "round out the
picture" from his 1981 Commence
ment address, he said that certain en
during values are non-negotiable.
Among the qualities he listed were
"a sense of duty; honor — personal
honor, and honor among friends and
fellow workers; loyalty to country
and to cause; courage in adversity;
freedom for ourselves and others,
with an understanding that when
anyone loses freedom, we all lose
some of ours."
Before President Carter lost his re
election bid in 1980, it had been
rumored that Christopher would be
chosen to succeed Secretary of State
Cyrus Vance in a second Carter ad
ministration. In the No. 2 spot at the
State Department, Christopher had
earned a reputation as a man who
could keep his cool in the most diffi
cult of situations.
A 1980 article in The Washington
Post called Christopher " "Mr. Cool,'
'Mr. Human Rights,' and Cy Vance's
'alter ego.' "
Born in Scranton, N.D., Christop
her graduated magna cum laude from
the University of Southern California
in 1945. He served in active duty in
the Naval Reserve from 1943 to 1946,
before enrolling at Stanford Law
School, where he was president of the
law review.
After serving as a clerk to Supreme
Court Justice William Douglas,
Christopher joined O'Melveny
& Myers in 1950. In 1965
and 1966, Christopher was the
vice chairman of the commission that
investigated the Watts riots, and he
represented the Johnson administra
tion in cotton textile negotiations
with Japan. In 1967, Christopher left
O'Melveny & Myers for two years to
serve as deputy attorney general un
der Ramsey Clark.
Christopher is married to the
former Marie Wyllis, and he has four
children. His son Thomas graduated
from Stanford in 1980, and his
daughter Kristen graduated this year.
