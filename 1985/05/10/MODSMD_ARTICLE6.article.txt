# Worker rehired after settlement
## 
### TODD RAMMING Senior staff writer 
Lagunita Food Service worker
Caine Han returned to work Mon
day following the out-of-court
settlement of an unfair labor
practice complaint filed against
Stanford more than a month ago
by United Stanford Workers
(USW) on his behalf.
USW officials filed the com
plaint with the National Labor Re
lations Board, charging that Han's
Feb. 28 resignation was forced
upon him and was "in retaliation
for union complaints" on his be
half, a violation of federal labor
laws.
In March 1983, Han filled a
temporary opening at Lagunita
Food Service, hoping it would lead
to a permanent, union-protected
position. Despite about a dozen
attempts at filling permanent posi
tions, Han was still working two
years later as a temporary worker
with no union protection, vacation
time or sick leave, he said.
According to the settlement
reached late last week, Han has
been rehired as a Food Service
Worker I, a permanent position
with full membership in the bar
gaining unit, said USW lawyer Jim
Eggleston.
According to the 1982 contract
between the union and Stanford,
"regular staff' in the collective
bargaining unit here includes
employees "in positions requiring
at least 20 hours per week for a
period actually lasting at least four
months."
USW Field Representative
Rodney Barnett said an employee
who has worked an initial four
months and a three-month proba
tion period is a bargaining unit
member with full union rights.
Han "has the right to work a per
manent job," he said. The settle
ment grants "everything that Han
should have had," Eggleston said.
Owing to improper recording of
hours, complaints have been filed
that Han received pay at straight
time for overtime hours, although
California law requires that
overtime be paid at time and one
half, according to Priscil la
Wheeler, staff counsel to the Uni
versity.
"The overtime issue is still sub
ject to review," Eggleston said.
Han said he is unsure whether
he will receive the overtime pay he
believes the Univcrsitv owes him.

But Wheeler said, "We're
seeing that [any back overtime
pay] is paid."
During the dispute between
USW and Stanford, Han Han,
Caine Han's father, said Susanna
Wong, assistant manager at
Lagunita Food Service, tried to
pressure him into convincing his
son not to pursue his complaints
against Stanford. "Susanna told
me if my son is still fighting Stan
ford. that means I am fighting
too," he said.
The settlement reached with the
University contains "assurances of
no retaliation," Eggleston said.
As his first week back on the job
drew to a close, Han said
"everything's going smoothly now
. . . although I have not yet seen
Susanna."
Wheeler said the University
reached the current settlement "in
the interest of Mr. Han."
"We believe there had been
some confusion," she said.
"Certainly, a mistake was made."
In hopes of avoiding future errors,
Lagunita Food Service officials
"have been reminded of what the
rules are."
Upon discovering that a regular
staff position was open, Wheeler
said her office called the union and
obtained permission to give this
position directly to Han. Union
regulations require that "all unit
job openings be posted for at least
10 working days before they are
filled."
"The issue was not the NLRB
charges, the issue was Caine
Han," Wheeler said. In regard to
the USW complaint to the NLRB
of forced resignation in retaliation
for union complaints, she said that
"we didn't believe anything like
that happened."
Barnett said of the USW
charges. "I hadn't seen a stronger
case in years. . . . They (the Uni
versity) had all the opportunity to
correct the situation when we
raised it with them in the begin
ning."
Barnett said he placed Han's
appeal for bargaining unit mem
bership on the agenda of the Feb.
27 meeting of the Committee on
Union-University Concerns
(CUUC). a joint committee com
prising labor and management
representatives. At that meeting.
