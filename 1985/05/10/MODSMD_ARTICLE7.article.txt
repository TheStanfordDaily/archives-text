Attacks ruin Beirut cease-fire
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Christian and Moslem militiamen unleashed
artillery barrages yesterday all along the Green Line dividing Beirut, and
militia street fighters opened fire on each other's strongholds.
The new fighting swept away a cease-fire that had been declared
Tuesday night, but was never fully observed.
President Amin Gemayel, a Christian, was reported under mounting
Syrian pressure to get tough with militants defying efforts to end the
fighting.
The artillery bombardment followed a night of clashes.
The rival militias exchanged rocket-propelled grenade, 106 mm recoil
less rifle and machine-gun fire from strongpoints in shell-blasted build
ings along the three-mile-long line that divides Beirut into Christian and
Moslem sectors. Army commanders and the "security committee'' made
up of military officers and representatives of the three main militias
sought to build a lasting cease-fire and to reopen the major crossing on
the Green Line.
But they appeared powerless to halt the fighting. And an attempt to
reopen the important gateway failed when gunmen on both sides started
shooting at bulldozers sent to flatten earthworks thrown up by the
militias.
There was no immediate word on casualties in yesterday's fighting.
But at least 77 people have been killed and more than 400 wounded
since April 28.
Usually well-informed sources denied a report from Abu Dhabi that
Gemayel was expected to resign shortly and hand over power to a 10-
man military government headed by Gen. Michel Aoun, the army com
mander.
Official sources in Beirut said that Syrian leaders have demanded
Gemayel get rid of hard-line Christian militia commander Samir
Geagea, who has defied Gemayel's efforts to end Lebanon's 10-year-old
civil war.
Geagea seized control of Christian forces on March 12 to protest
Gemayel's pro-Syrian policies.
Israeli navy kills five guerrillas
TEL AVIV, Israel — An Israeli navy patrol boat fired at and killed
five men who were in a rubber dinghy on their way to carry out a terror
ist attack on Israel, the military command said Wednesday.
The command said a navy vessel, on routine patrol south of the
Lebanese port of Tyre, spotted the dinghy heading south toward Israel
on Tuesday night. When the dinghy began to sail away, the navy ship
opened fire on it, killing all five occupants, the command said.
Israeli military sources said the dinghy, equipped with a 50 horse
power outboard motor, carried an Arabic inscription known from previ
ous attack attempts, but they did not say what the inscription was. The
five men were wearing camouflaged uniforms, said the sources, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
The sources did not give any details about the slain men or what weap
ons they were carrying.
Christian militia chooses new chief
BEIRUT. Lebanon — Christian militia leaders shunted aside their
chief last night, under pressure from Syria, and replaced him with Elie
Hebeika, the man Israel blames for massacres at two Palestinian refugee
camps in 1982.
The former commander. Samir Geagea, led the Lebanese Forces
militia in a revolt March 12 against Syrian influence in President Amin
Gemayel's government, seizing control in most of Christian Lebanon.
Syria blames him for the current upsurge in Christian-Moslem fighting.
Official sources said Gemayel, a Maronite Christian, had been under
mounting pressure from Syria to move against Geagea and other
hardline militia leaders as a means of ending the sectarian fighting, in
which more than 250 people have been killed since March 29.
The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said President
Hafez Assad of Syria told Gemayel that he would support a push by
Moslem militias into Christian east Beirut unless the Lebanese president
moved against Geagea.
The Lebanese Forces announced that Hobeika, who has served as in
telligence chief, was elected head of the decision-making executive com
mittee. That means he outranks Geagea, 32, who retains his post as chief
of staff.
An Israeli government commission accused Hobeika. 35, of leading
the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees Sept. 16-18 at the
Sabra and Chatila camps in Beirut, which the Israelis then controlled
after their June invasion.
Hobeika said after his election: ' Our option is the Arab option.
Lebanon is Arab and we say this out of conviction and not fear."
Moscow parade celebrates V-E day
MOSCOW — Old and new paraded for Victory Day yesterday —
medal-bedecked veterans and the multiple-rocket launchers of World
War 11, young soldiers and weapons of the nuclear age — to com
memorate the defeat of Nazi Germany.
Thousands packed Red Square in a chill wind and heard Defense Min
ister Sergei Sokolov pledge retribution on any aggressor, but appeal for
"trust, cooperation and mutual understanding" among nations.
At a reception later. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev said the world's
problems can be resolved only through "a patient and constructive
dialogue."
The sun broke through for the parade past the Kremlin on the 40th
anniversary of V-E Day — it was May 9 in Moscow when the Nazis sur
rendered — included several pieces of military hardware new to Red
Square parades, among them unarmed nuclear weapons.
Gorbachev, who was 14 years old when the war ended, led members
of the ruling Politburo onto Lenin's mausoleum to view the parade that
climaxed a nationwide celebration,
Sokolov congratulated the units taking part in the parade, and
declared: "Mankind never before witnessed such valor, heroism,
courage and will to win" as displayed by Soviet soldiers in World War 11.
"Western propaganda makes considerable efforts to distort history, to
absolve those who started the Second World War and denigrate the
U.S.S.R.'s role," he said. "The war cost 20 million Soviet lives and we
shall never forget that."
But he also paid tribute to others: "The peoples and armies of the
U.S.A.. Britain, France, China and other members of the anti-Hitler
coalition made a great contribution to victory."
Of the major NATO allies, only the United States and West Germany
did not send their ambassadors to the parade. U.S. Ambassador Arthur
Hartman stayed away because of the shooting of an American military
officer by a Soviet sentry in East Germany last month.
Hartman attended the Kremlin reception later. He said he and Gorba
chev held a brief conversation mostly about the meeting set for next
week in Vienna between Secretary of State George Shultz and Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko.
Congress remembers hostages
WASHINGTON — Congress was urged Wednesday to remember the
plight of five Americans kidnapped and held hostage by terrorists in
Lebanon, and to support efforts to secure their release.
The pleas came on the first anniversary of one of the kidnappings. The
Rev. Benjamin Weir, a Presbyterian missionary, was seized May 8, 1984
as he walked with his wife down a street in strife-torn Beirut.
"We were touched by the plight of five fellow Americans victimized
by international terrorism, and by the pain of their families bereaved of
their presence." Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) told his colleagues in a floor
speech.
Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) said "we can only
hope that whatever hardships confront our five countrymen, they are
finding the strength to endure knowing they have the support of this
entire, great nation.
"Our prayers are with them and with those who are working tirelessly
for their release," Dole said.

The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said President
Hafez Assad of Syria told Gemayel that he would support a push by
Moslem militias into Christian east Beirut unless the Lebanese president
moved against Geagea.
The Lebanese Forces announced that Hobeika, who has served as in
telligence chief, was elected head of the decision-making executive com
mittee. That means he outranks Geagea, 32, who retains his post as chief
of staff.
An Israeli government commission accused Hobeika. 35, of leading
the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees Sept. 16-18 at the
Sabra and Chatila camps in Beirut, which the Israelis then controlled
after their June invasion.
Hobeika said after his election: ' Our option is the Arab option.
Lebanon is Arab and we say this out of conviction and not fear."
Moscow parade celebrates V-E day
MOSCOW — Old and new paraded for Victory Day yesterday —
medal-bedecked veterans and the multiple-rocket launchers of World
War 11, young soldiers and weapons of the nuclear age — to com
memorate the defeat of Nazi Germany.
Thousands packed Red Square in a chill wind and heard Defense Min
ister Sergei Sokolov pledge retribution on any aggressor, but appeal for
"trust, cooperation and mutual understanding" among nations.
At a reception later. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev said the world's
problems can be resolved only through "a patient and constructive
dialogue."
The sun broke through for the parade past the Kremlin on the 40th
anniversary of V-E Day — it was May 9 in Moscow when the Nazis sur
rendered — included several pieces of military hardware new to Red
Square parades, among them unarmed nuclear weapons.
Gorbachev, who was 14 years old when the war ended, led members
of the ruling Politburo onto Lenin's mausoleum to view the parade that
climaxed a nationwide celebration,
Sokolov congratulated the units taking part in the parade, and
declared: "Mankind never before witnessed such valor, heroism,
courage and will to win" as displayed by Soviet soldiers in World War 11.
"Western propaganda makes considerable efforts to distort history, to
absolve those who started the Second World War and denigrate the
U.S.S.R.'s role," he said. "The war cost 20 million Soviet lives and we
shall never forget that."
But he also paid tribute to others: "The peoples and armies of the
U.S.A.. Britain, France, China and other members of the anti-Hitler
coalition made a great contribution to victory."
Of the major NATO allies, only the United States and West Germany
did not send their ambassadors to the parade. U.S. Ambassador Arthur
Hartman stayed away because of the shooting of an American military
officer by a Soviet sentry in East Germany last month.
Hartman attended the Kremlin reception later. He said he and Gorba
chev held a brief conversation mostly about the meeting set for next
week in Vienna between Secretary of State George Shultz and Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko.
Congress remembers hostages
WASHINGTON — Congress was urged Wednesday to remember the
plight of five Americans kidnapped and held hostage by terrorists in
Lebanon, and to support efforts to secure their release.
The pleas came on the first anniversary of one of the kidnappings. The
Rev. Benjamin Weir, a Presbyterian missionary, was seized May 8, 1984
as he walked with his wife down a street in strife-torn Beirut.
"We were touched by the plight of five fellow Americans victimized
by international terrorism, and by the pain of their families bereaved of
their presence." Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) told his colleagues in a floor
speech.
Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) said "we can only
hope that whatever hardships confront our five countrymen, they are
finding the strength to endure knowing they have the support of this
entire, great nation.
"Our prayers are with them and with those who are working tirelessly
for their release," Dole said.
Attacks ruin Beirut cease-fire
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Christian and Moslem militiamen unleashed
artillery barrages yesterday all along the Green Line dividing Beirut, and
militia street fighters opened fire on each other's strongholds.
The new fighting swept away a cease-fire that had been declared
Tuesday night, but was never fully observed.
President Amin Gemayel, a Christian, was reported under mounting
Syrian pressure to get tough with militants defying efforts to end the
fighting.
The artillery bombardment followed a night of clashes.
The rival militias exchanged rocket-propelled grenade, 106 mm recoil
less rifle and machine-gun fire from strongpoints in shell-blasted build
ings along the three-mile-long line that divides Beirut into Christian and
Moslem sectors. Army commanders and the "security committee'' made
up of military officers and representatives of the three main militias
sought to build a lasting cease-fire and to reopen the major crossing on
the Green Line.
But they appeared powerless to halt the fighting. And an attempt to
reopen the important gateway failed when gunmen on both sides started
shooting at bulldozers sent to flatten earthworks thrown up by the
militias.
There was no immediate word on casualties in yesterday's fighting.
But at least 77 people have been killed and more than 400 wounded
since April 28.
Usually well-informed sources denied a report from Abu Dhabi that
Gemayel was expected to resign shortly and hand over power to a 10-
man military government headed by Gen. Michel Aoun, the army com
mander.
Official sources in Beirut said that Syrian leaders have demanded
Gemayel get rid of hard-line Christian militia commander Samir
Geagea, who has defied Gemayel's efforts to end Lebanon's 10-year-old
civil war.
Geagea seized control of Christian forces on March 12 to protest
Gemayel's pro-Syrian policies.
Israeli navy kills five guerrillas
TEL AVIV, Israel — An Israeli navy patrol boat fired at and killed
five men who were in a rubber dinghy on their way to carry out a terror
ist attack on Israel, the military command said Wednesday.
The command said a navy vessel, on routine patrol south of the
Lebanese port of Tyre, spotted the dinghy heading south toward Israel
on Tuesday night. When the dinghy began to sail away, the navy ship
opened fire on it, killing all five occupants, the command said.
Israeli military sources said the dinghy, equipped with a 50 horse
power outboard motor, carried an Arabic inscription known from previ
ous attack attempts, but they did not say what the inscription was. The
five men were wearing camouflaged uniforms, said the sources, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
The sources did not give any details about the slain men or what weap
ons they were carrying.
Christian militia chooses new chief
BEIRUT. Lebanon — Christian militia leaders shunted aside their
chief last night, under pressure from Syria, and replaced him with Elie
Hebeika, the man Israel blames for massacres at two Palestinian refugee
camps in 1982.
The former commander. Samir Geagea, led the Lebanese Forces
militia in a revolt March 12 against Syrian influence in President Amin
Gemayel's government, seizing control in most of Christian Lebanon.
Syria blames him for the current upsurge in Christian-Moslem fighting.
Official sources said Gemayel, a Maronite Christian, had been under
mounting pressure from Syria to move against Geagea and other
hardline militia leaders as a means of ending the sectarian fighting, in
which more than 250 people have been killed since March 29.
The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said President
Hafez Assad of Syria told Gemayel that he would support a push by
