LISBON. Portugal — President Reagan, his 10-
day European odyssey almost over, lashed out at
Soviet and Nicaraguan leaders yesterday and ex
pressed hope for a time when totalitarian rule "is
only a sad and distant memory."
Reagan rejected charges by Soviet leader Mik
hail Gorbachev that the United States is "the for
ward edge of the war menace to mankind." Asked
what he thought about Gorbachev's statement,
Reagan replied, "What I usually think of him? . . .
Who is he to talk?"
Training his fire on Nicaraguan President Daniel
Ortega, Reagan said the leftist Sandinista govern
ment was "interferring with democracy in the
Americas."
Reagan said he was not surprised Ortega visited
Moscow last week. "That's his patron saint,"
Reagan declared.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes said the
White House was "surprised by the tone" of Gor
bachev's speech Wednesday on the 40th anniver
sary of the end of World War II in Europe.
"We think it's a hardline speech from a Soviet
leader," Speakes said. "A statement like that from
the Soviet leader is not helpful."
The president was upbeat on the last full day of
his trip, spent with leaders of a nation that was a
founding member of NATO and is a durable ally of
the United States.
Ignoring differences with other European
countries over foreign policy and defense issues
that were highlighted during his four-nation visit.
Reagan said, "a long journey is ending now, but
one fruitful in results and rich in memory."
Asked if he were weary on the eve of his return
to Washington, the 74-year-old Reagan beamed a
smile, spread his arms wide and said, "Youth is on
mv side."
