# Dole pushes budget
## Officials say Reagan accepts proposal 
### 
WASHINGTON — Senate
Majority Leader Robert Dole
struggled yesterday to nail down final
details of a revised budget that would
cancel next year's Social Security cost
of living increase and sharply pare
President Reagan's defense buildup
as part of a three-year plan to cut
spending by $300 billion.
Administration officials said
Reagan had agreed to the proposal,
despite the change in defense spend
ing and the resurrection of numerous
domestic programs he had proposed
killing, including the Job Corps, Ur
ban Development Action Grants and
the federal subsidy for Amtrak.
There would be no tax increases in
the proposal, which Dole said would
cut spending by as much as $56 bil
lion next year alone. In all, the plan
was designed to reduce federal
deficits in half over three years, to
roughly SIOO billion.
Dole said the chances were "SO
SO" he could win approval for the
revised blueprint within hours, but
Democratic Sen. Lawton Chiles of
Florida, an opponent, said the GOP
leader was still "horse-trading." GOP
aides also said the final pieces of the
deficit-reduction puzzle had not yet
fallen into place.
GOP efforts to find Democratic
support for their plan were focused
on Sen. Edward Zorinsky of Ne
braska. a former Republican who told

reporters he was undecided. "I have
never been known to vote on a par
tisan basis," Zorinsky said, adding he
didn't know of any other Democrats
who were likely to support the GOP
proposal.
A proposal by Sen. Arlen Specter
(R-Pa.) to maintain funding for
Amtrak was approved, 53-41, a
result that GOP aides said assured
the rail subsidy would survive in the
package Dole was assembling.
In a third vote, a plan by several
senators to freeze spending across
the-board, including defense, was
defeated. 70-27.
The Dole package would still call
for cancellation of about a dozen pro
grams over three years, such as reve
nue sharing and Small Business Ad
ministration direct loans.
But by agreeing to salvage other
domestic programs and hold the rise
in defense spending next year to an
inflation adjustment, the Kansas Re
publican jettisoned a compromise
spending plan agreed to several
weeks ago by Reagan.
Even so. White House spokesman
Larry Speakes said the president was
supporting the new proposal, and
added that Chief of Staff Donald
Regan was telephoning wavering
senators on its behalf.
Vice President George Bush also
cut short a trip to Arizona to return to
Washington in case his vote were
needed to break a tie.
