# Illinois governor frees Gary Dotson

### 
CHICAGO â€” Gov. James
Thompson yesterday freed Gary
Dotson, commuting his sentence
after Dotson served six years in
prison for a rape his former ac
cuser now says never happened.
Thompson, who refused to
grant Dotson a pardon proclaim
ing his innocence, said he was act
ing "to do justice and mercy" and
that "no good purpose would be
served" by returning Dotson to
prison, where he was serving a 25-
to 50-year sentence.
Thompson, acting a day after
the end of a clemency hearing,
said he did not believe key aspects
of Cathleen Crowell Webb's story
that she fabricated the rape. But
he noted the length of time Dot
son served, that Webb wants Dot
son freed and that Dotson
behaved well in prison.
"I have to decide this case as my
gut tells me to decide it," said
Thompson, adding that it had
brought a cloud over the Illinois
criminal justice system.
Dotson, who has been free on

bond, watched the televised
proceedings at his family's home
and smiled briefly when
Thompson announced the com
mutation. He said he planned to
continue to clear his name, either
through a new trial or by continu
ing his appeal before an appellate
court.
Carol Smith, Webb's foster
mother, said she thought
Thompson "made a very wise
decision."
"We have no objection to Dot
son getting out of jail," said Smith,
who has said she finds it hard to
believe Webb was not raped. "I
think he has served long enough."
The commutation was contin
gent on good behavior by Dotson,
said Thompson. The governor
could have commuted Dotson's
sentence, granted him a pardon on
grounds of innocence or returned
him to prison.
Dotson, 28, was convicted in
1979 of kidnapping and raping
Webb, formerly of suburban
Homewood. He was released on
$100,000 bond May 1.
