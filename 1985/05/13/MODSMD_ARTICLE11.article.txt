Defense under fire
WASHINGTON — Congress, which went
along with President Reagan's huge defense
buildup during his first term, now appears ready
to veto further increases in Pentagon spending as
a result of rising budget deficits and defense con
tracting scandals.
Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) captured the new
mood when he said, "I don't believe it. Last year
the debate was: Can we survive with 5 percent?
Now the debate is can we survive without a
freeze?"
The Senate last week approved a fiscal 1986
budget blueprint that essentially freezes defense
spending at current levels, permitting increases
only to account for inflation.
That vote came hours after the House Armed
Services Committee, normally a bastion of sup
port for the military, drafted its own Pentagon
spending program, which also pegged defense
spending to current levels.
The two votes indicate a changed mood on
Capitol Hill, where Reagan's first-term plan to
"re-arm America"' won both strong support and
average annual defense increases of 9 percent
beyond inflation.

Reagan, who originally sought a 5.9 percent
defense hike above inflation next year and then
said he would settle for a 3 percent increase,
denounced the initial Senate decision as an
"irresponsible act."
Artificial hearts debated
NEW YORK — The head of artificial human
heart experiments at Humana Institute acknowl
edged yesterday that the program is not a success
so far because it has substituted mechanical prob
lems for disease in cardiac patients.
"We hope that eventually, mechanical heart
disease will be much less severe than human
heart disease. But at this point, it has certainly
not been that successful," Dr. Allan Lansing said
on ABC-TV's "This Week With David
Brinkley."
Despite problems with the program at
Humana Hospital Audubon at Louisville, Ky.,
Lansing said, "If I were dying and I had some
thing to live for, then I wouM try an artificial
heart.
"If it were a life just to stay alive . . . no, I am

not interested in that. But if I have something to
live for and the mechanical heart is the only pos
sibility of my achieving it, then I would certainly
take a mechanical heart."
Three patients have received artificial hearts at
Humana. One has died and the other two,
William Schroeder and Murray Haydon, remain
hospitalized with severe health problems.
Dr. William DeVries, who implanted Jarvik-7
artificial hearts in all three men, as well as in Bar
ney Clark in Utah, said last week that Schroeder
will need transfusions for the rest of his life be
cause the mechanical pump breaks down red
blood cells.
DeVries is authorized by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration to implant three more ar
tificial hearts, after which the agency will deter
mine whether to continue the experiments.
Schroeder's son Melvin told television inter
viewers that two strokes since the implant opera
tion have left his father unable to speak and
unable to tell his family whether he regrets un
dergoing the implant.
Its kind of like saying, 'If I'd known I was
going to be thrown out stealing second base, I
wouldn't have stolen second base,' " said the
younger Schroeder.
