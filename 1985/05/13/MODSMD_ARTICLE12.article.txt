Retail gas prices rise
LOS ANGELES — Retail gas prices, which
have jumped nearly 9 cents per gallon in the past
three months, are continuing to rise as the oil in
dustry scrambles to cope with a July 1 low-lead
law, an industry analyst said yesterday.
Also expected to add to the upward spiral are
traditional summer increases in consumption and
price, a discrepancy between wholesale and retail
prices and higher crude oil spot prices, analyst
Dan Lundbcrg said.
In a nationwide survey of 17,500 gasoline sta
tions compiled Saturday, the overall price of all
grades of gasoline was $1.23 per gallon, an 8.8
cent rise since Feb. 8 when prices were at their
lowest in five years, he said.
In comparison, prices rose 2.4 cents during the
same period last year, he said.
Bees fly amok
SACRAMENTO — Millions of bees were
turned loose on a downtown freeway yesterday

when a truck trailer containing hundreds of hives
overturned, the California Highway Patrol said.
"There are millions and millions of bees," said
CHP dispatcher Michael Bartley. "There are
40,000 in a hive and at least 100 (hives) broke
open."
He said the accident happened when a truck
and trailer rig changed lanes about two miles
southeast of the state Capitol on State Highway
99 and one of two trailers overturned.
The truck driver suffered minor injuries and
several passersby were stung, Bartley said. But
two hospitals near the accident site said no one
came in complaining of bee stings.
Several beekeepers helped round up the bees,
Bartley said, along with crews from the U.S. De
partment of Forestry armed with flamethrowers.
He said the flamethrowers were being used to
drive swarms of bees back to the hives.
Tremor shakes Bishop
BISHOP — A mild earthquake rumbled
through central California yesterday but authori

ties reported no injuries or damage.
The temblor, which struck at 8:29 a.m., had a
preliminary magnitude of 3.9 on the Richter
scale of ground motion, said Charles O'Neal,
warning controller for the state Office of Emer
gency Services in Sacramento.
"I wasn't even aware of it," said Jeff Geiger,
Inyo County Sheriff s deputy in Bishop, about 40
miles south of the quake's epicenter near
Crowley Lake.
The Richter scale is a measure of ground mo
tion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase
of one number means a tenfold increase in mag
nitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an
earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5.
