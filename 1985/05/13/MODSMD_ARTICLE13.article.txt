## Religious groups help students combine faith, fun 
### ALICE PETERS 
For a growing number of Stanford
students, worship services, Bible
studies and community outreach pro
grams are becoming part of the col
lege experience.
"For me, a Stanford education —
or any education period — is a lot
more important than what you learn
in books," explained Marivern
Slaveck, student coordinator for the
Newman Center, the Catholic organi
zation on campus.
Dean of the Chapel Robert
Hamerton-Kelly says he has noticed
an increase in student involvement in
religious activities since he first came
to Stanford 12 years ago.
In addition to Memorial Church's
nondenominational student services,
approximately 23 groups comprising
Stanford Associated Ministries
(SAM) meet the needs of many stu
dents from Christian and Jewish
backgrounds.
Before becoming active at Stan
ford, religious organizations must
join SAM.
, The Rev. Byron Bland, director of
United Campus Christian Ministry
(UCCM) said, "All religious groups
that wish to work on campus are re
quired to submit applications through
the nondenominational Memorial
Church and to become a part of Stan
ford Associated Ministries. New
groups are continually asking to be
included, and joining is a fairly simple
procedure."
First called United Campus Mini
stries and then Stanford United Mini
stries, SAM originated in 1966.
Before then, denominational mini
stries were not allowed on campus.
"Stanford Associated Ministries is
a way of coordinating the denomina
tions," Hamerton-Kelly, director of
SAM, explained. He estimates that
approximately 2,000 students of
various denominations currently
utilize SAM.
"We have broad goals for Stanford
Associated Ministries," said
Hamerton-Kelly. "One is religious
cooperation," he said. "One hopes
that that would lead to a better un
derstanding among religous groups. It
serves the needs of the students at
Stanford."
Several of the organizations
belonging to SAM are grouped to
gether in the Ecumenical Ministries
at Stanford. These include the Epis
copal Fellowship (Canterbury Fel
lowship), the Newman Center,
UCCM, Memorial Church and the
Lutheran Center. Together, the five
ministries work to solve community
and world problems and offer Chris
tian fellowship and activities.
The Canterbury Fellowship, associ
ated with St. Bede's, Holy Trinity, St.
Mark's, All Saints and Christ Church,
offers a Eucharist Tuesdays at noon.
The main objective of the organi
zation is "to have representation of
the Episcopal Church and the
Anglican Communion here at Stan
ford," according to the Rev.

Penelope Duckworth, who just took
over leadership of the Canterbury
Fellowship on May 1.
Describing the Episcopalian
Church, Duckworth said, "It's often
been called the thinking person's
church. We try to balance the Bible,
tradition and reason."
Duckworth noted that evangelism
has a role in the church. "I think
evangelism is an important aspect of
our faith," she explained, admitting
however, that "the Episcopal Church
may not be as openly aggressive or
evangelical as other religions."
Approximately 20 students cur
rently are active in the Canterbury
Fellowship.
"I owe much of my happiness just
to them being there," said Camm
Macguire, who along with Noelle
Morris is a student fellow of Canter
bury. "It's just meant the world to
me, and 1 don't see how I could have
done it any other way," Macguire
said.
Both Macguire and Duckworth
stressed social awareness and com
munity service as important activities
of the Canterbury Fellowship.
"I think a real Christian experience
at Stanford involves a lot of interac
tion outside of Stanford," said Mac
guire. "That's always got to be what
the main focus is: What can we do to
realize God's mission on earth?"
Citing the Ecumenical Hunger
Project and the Stanford Christian
Student Movement as rewarding
community service organizations,
Macguire said of the relationship be
tween his faith and charity work," It's
just basic human love and caring
when you accept it as a tenet of your
faith."
Macguire added, "What I'd like to
see eventually is a lot of liaison be
tween the Stanford Volunteer Net
work and the student Christian
groups."
The Newman Center, a Catholic
organization affiliated with St. Ann's
Chapel, offers daily Mass at the Club
house.
The Rev. Eugene Boyle, director
of the center, said the center's objec
tives are "to provide for our congre
gation the best possible experience of
the Catholic community — that
would be the primary goal of our
group."
The Newman Center is not openly
evangelical, according to Boyle.
"Preaching the Gospel is of essence
to Christianity, so it is an objective of
Catholicism. We do not engage in
overt proselytizing. We spread the
Gospel through our example and
through our word," he said.
The Newman Center provides
services such as liturgical worship,
educational programs, Bible studies,
discussion groups, retreats and social
activities.
Like Duckworth and Macguire,
Boyle emphasized the importance of
volunteer work to the Newman Cen
ter. "We do have a very important
outreach program of community ser

vice at local hospitals, day care
centers and child care centers," he
Said.
"1 made a choice to devote a lot of
time to the Newman Center, and I
think I'm a better person for it,"
Slaveck said.
The center, "offers a Catholic com
munity, allowing me to learn more
about my faith and practice my
faith," she said. "I think a lot of
people struggle with, 'How do I
combine what 1 believe in my faith
with what I practice and what I do?' "
Slaveck praised the support provided
by the Newman Center, saying,
"There's always a forum to talk about
that kind of thing. There are all kinds
of people who've faced the same
problems."
Slaveck pointed out that people
who are not Catholic are also
welcome to participate in Newman
Center activities. "We try to meet
people where they're at," she ex
plained.
UCCM, incorporating Presbyter
ian, Methodist, United Church of
Christ and American Baptist
denominations, offers worship and
supper on Wednesday evenings and
discussions on ethical issues.
"It is our goal to engage people in
active Christian faith," explained
Bland, director of UCCM. "It ad
dresses and involves people in issues
of the day. I think we take all aspects
of that seriously."
According to Bland, a large part of
UCCM's role involves community
service. "One big thing I think
UCCM is is a focus for ecumenicity,
where people of different back
grounds come together and interact
with each other. It's an opportunity to
develop Christian responsibility," he
explained.
UCCM has helped instigate the
Peace Studies program and the Sci
ence and Technology program and is
active in the Ecumenical Hunger
Project.
The Lutheran Campus Ministry,
associated with University Lutheran
Church, offers soup and supper on
Sunday evenings, Bible studies,
retreats and counseling.
"I guess we're unique here, be
cause unlike many of the other organ
izations, we do have our own church
here," commented the Rev. Sue
Hedahl, interim pastor of the church.
Hedahl said, "I think Stanford is a
wonderful context in which one is
forced to ask lots of questions (such
as) 'What does it mean to be a Chris
tian?' " i
Lutheran student John Hensala
said, "It's nice to share the
denomination with everyone in the
group. It's just a kind of angle on
Christianity that we share."
He added, "We're trying to stress
that it's not only Lutheran and
nobody else, but that's just kind of
the starting point for it."
Another member of SAM, Stan
ford Christian Evangelical Ministries
(SCEM), includes Stanford Christian

Fellowship (Intervarsity), Campus
Crusade, Navigators, Menlo Univer
sity Fellowship (Menlo Park Presby
terian Church), Seminar 80
(Peninsula Bible Church), Interna
tional Students Christian Outreach
and Parakaleo.
The largest of these organizations
is Intervarsity, boasting approxi
mately 150 members who take part in
large group meetings on Wednesday
evenings, daily prayer at noon, Bible
studies and retreats.
"1 think our goal is to establish a
group or a fellowship of students to
help each other and encourage each
other in growing as Christians, that
will work together in understanding
the Scripture and living it out," said

staff leader Bill Glad.
Freshman Dan McWilliams com
mented, "The group helps a lot in
really living out what you hear about
and what you're taught. It's definitely
not an easy thing to integrate the
secular with your faith."
Sophomore Andrew Crowell
agreed, saying, "There are a lot of
value conflicts in being a Christian at
an essentially non-Christian
campus."
Crowell objects most to "the work
study-get-rich attitude a lot of people
have. I don't want to come across as
sounding cynical, but it's more of a
frustration on my part," he said.
Both McWilliams and Crowell list
"spreading God's word" as important

David Kim/Daily
and find that Intervarsity encourages
them.
"I view it as a very active thing,"
Crowell said. "They really stress
enacting your own faith and letting
your friends know."
According to McWilliams, "It's
more of a one-on-one, more like
loving people into the kingdom (of
God), not like trying to hit them over
the head with a Bible. It's not seeing
people as objects and trying to con
vert them, but seeing them as human
beings who need love and need God,
basically."
