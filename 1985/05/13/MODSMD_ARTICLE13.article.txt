## Religious groups help students combine faith, fun 
### ALICE PETERS 
For a growing number of Stanford
students, worship services, Bible
studies and community outreach pro
grams are becoming part of the col
lege experience.
"For me, a Stanford education —
or any education period — is a lot
more important than what you learn
in books," explained Marivern
Slaveck, student coordinator for the
Newman Center, the Catholic organi
zation on campus.
Dean of the Chapel Robert
Hamerton-Kelly says he has noticed
an increase in student involvement in
religious activities since he first came
to Stanford 12 years ago.
In addition to Memorial Church's
nondenominational student services,
approximately 23 groups comprising
Stanford Associated Ministries
(SAM) meet the needs of many stu
dents from Christian and Jewish
backgrounds.
Before becoming active at Stan
ford, religious organizations must
join SAM.
, The Rev. Byron Bland, director of
United Campus Christian Ministry
(UCCM) said, "All religious groups
that wish to work on campus are re
quired to submit applications through
the nondenominational Memorial
Church and to become a part of Stan
ford Associated Ministries. New
groups are continually asking to be
included, and joining is a fairly simple
procedure."
First called United Campus Mini
stries and then Stanford United Mini
stries, SAM originated in 1966.
Before then, denominational mini
stries were not allowed on campus.
"Stanford Associated Ministries is
a way of coordinating the denomina
tions," Hamerton-Kelly, director of
SAM, explained. He estimates that
approximately 2,000 students of
various denominations currently
utilize SAM.
"We have broad goals for Stanford
Associated Ministries," said
Hamerton-Kelly. "One is religious
cooperation," he said. "One hopes
that that would lead to a better un
derstanding among religous groups. It
serves the needs of the students at
Stanford."
Several of the organizations
belonging to SAM are grouped to
gether in the Ecumenical Ministries
at Stanford. These include the Epis
copal Fellowship (Canterbury Fel
lowship), the Newman Center,
UCCM, Memorial Church and the
Lutheran Center. Together, the five
ministries work to solve community
and world problems and offer Chris
tian fellowship and activities.
The Canterbury Fellowship, associ
ated with St. Bede's, Holy Trinity, St.
Mark's, All Saints and Christ Church,
offers a Eucharist Tuesdays at noon.
The main objective of the organi
zation is "to have representation of
the Episcopal Church and the
Anglican Communion here at Stan
ford," according to the Rev.

Penelope Duckworth, who just took
over leadership of the Canterbury
Fellowship on May 1.
Describing the Episcopalian
Church, Duckworth said, "It's often
been called the thinking person's
church. We try to balance the Bible,
tradition and reason."
Duckworth noted that evangelism
has a role in the church. "I think
evangelism is an important aspect of
our faith," she explained, admitting
however, that "the Episcopal Church
may not be as openly aggressive or
evangelical as other religions."
Approximately 20 students cur
rently are active in the Canterbury
Fellowship.
"I owe much of my happiness just
to them being there," said Camm
Macguire, who along with Noelle
Morris is a student fellow of Canter
bury. "It's just meant the world to
me, and 1 don't see how I could have
done it any other way," Macguire
said.
Both Macguire and Duckworth
stressed social awareness and com
munity service as important activities
of the Canterbury Fellowship.
"I think a real Christian experience
at Stanford involves a lot of interac
tion outside of Stanford," said Mac
guire. "That's always got to be what
the main focus is: What can we do to
realize God's mission on earth?"
Citing the Ecumenical Hunger
Project and the Stanford Christian
Student Movement as rewarding
community service organizations,
Macguire said of the relationship be
tween his faith and charity work," It's
just basic human love and caring
when you accept it as a tenet of your
faith."
Macguire added, "What I'd like to
see eventually is a lot of liaison be
tween the Stanford Volunteer Net
work and the student Christian
groups."
The Newman Center, a Catholic
organization affiliated with St. Ann's
Chapel, offers daily Mass at the Club
house.
The Rev. Eugene Boyle, director
of the center, said the center's objec
tives are "to provide for our congre
gation the best possible experience of
the Catholic community — that
would be the primary goal of our
group."
The Newman Center is not openly
evangelical, according to Boyle.
"Preaching the Gospel is of essence
to Christianity, so it is an objective of
Catholicism. We do not engage in
overt proselytizing. We spread the
Gospel through our example and
through our word," he said.
The Newman Center provides
services such as liturgical worship,
educational programs, Bible studies,
discussion groups, retreats and social
activities.
Like Duckworth and Macguire,
Boyle emphasized the importance of
volunteer work to the Newman Cen
ter. "We do have a very important
outreach program of community ser

vice at local hospitals, day care
centers and child care centers," he
Said.
"1 made a choice to devote a lot of
time to the Newman Center, and I
think I'm a better person for it,"
Slaveck said.
The center, "offers a Catholic com
munity, allowing me to learn more
about my faith and practice my
faith," she said. "I think a lot of
people struggle with, 'How do I
combine what 1 believe in my faith
with what I practice and what I do?' "
Slaveck praised the support provided
by the Newman Center, saying,
"There's always a forum to talk about
that kind of thing. There are all kinds
of people who've faced the same
problems."
Slaveck pointed out that people
who are not Catholic are also
welcome to participate in Newman
Center activities. "We try to meet
people where they're at," she ex
plained.
UCCM, incorporating Presbyter
ian, Methodist, United Church of
Christ and American Baptist
denominations, offers worship and
supper on Wednesday evenings and
discussions on ethical issues.
"It is our goal to engage people in
active Christian faith," explained
Bland, director of UCCM. "It ad
dresses and involves people in issues
of the day. I think we take all aspects
of that seriously."
According to Bland, a large part of
UCCM's role involves community
service. "One big thing I think
UCCM is is a focus for ecumenicity,
where people of different back
grounds come together and interact
with each other. It's an opportunity to
develop Christian responsibility," he
explained.
UCCM has helped instigate the
Peace Studies program and the Sci
ence and Technology program and is
active in the Ecumenical Hunger
Project.
The Lutheran Campus Ministry,
associated with University Lutheran
Church, offers soup and supper on
Sunday evenings, Bible studies,
retreats and counseling.
"I guess we're unique here, be
cause unlike many of the other organ
izations, we do have our own church
here," commented the Rev. Sue
Hedahl, interim pastor of the church.
Hedahl said, "I think Stanford is a
wonderful context in which one is
forced to ask lots of questions (such
as) 'What does it mean to be a Chris
tian?' " i
Lutheran student John Hensala
said, "It's nice to share the
denomination with everyone in the
group. It's just a kind of angle on
Christianity that we share."
He added, "We're trying to stress
that it's not only Lutheran and
nobody else, but that's just kind of
the starting point for it."
Another member of SAM, Stan
ford Christian Evangelical Ministries
(SCEM), includes Stanford Christian

Fellowship (Intervarsity), Campus
Crusade, Navigators, Menlo Univer
sity Fellowship (Menlo Park Presby
terian Church), Seminar 80
(Peninsula Bible Church), Interna
tional Students Christian Outreach
and Parakaleo.
The largest of these organizations
is Intervarsity, boasting approxi
mately 150 members who take part in
large group meetings on Wednesday
evenings, daily prayer at noon, Bible
studies and retreats.
"1 think our goal is to establish a
group or a fellowship of students to
help each other and encourage each
other in growing as Christians, that
will work together in understanding
the Scripture and living it out," said

staff leader Bill Glad.
Freshman Dan McWilliams com
mented, "The group helps a lot in
really living out what you hear about
and what you're taught. It's definitely
not an easy thing to integrate the
secular with your faith."
Sophomore Andrew Crowell
agreed, saying, "There are a lot of
value conflicts in being a Christian at
an essentially non-Christian
campus."
Crowell objects most to "the work
study-get-rich attitude a lot of people
have. I don't want to come across as
sounding cynical, but it's more of a
frustration on my part," he said.
Both McWilliams and Crowell list
"spreading God's word" as important

David Kim/Daily
and find that Intervarsity encourages
them.
"I view it as a very active thing,"
Crowell said. "They really stress
enacting your own faith and letting
your friends know."
According to McWilliams, "It's
more of a one-on-one, more like
loving people into the kingdom (of
God), not like trying to hit them over
the head with a Bible. It's not seeing
people as objects and trying to con
vert them, but seeing them as human
beings who need love and need God,
basically."
Another member of SCEM,
Campus Crusade for Christ, offers

Bible studies, fellowship, disciple
groups and retreats under the leader
ship of Dave Moore.
Campus Crusade member Rich
Goode, describes the organization as
"strongly evangelist."
"It's helped me to keep what I feel
is the proper perspective on life,"
Goode said. "And it's helped me see
the importance of reaching others
with the word of God."
Goode, also a member of the Phi
Psi fraternity, does not see his faith as
conflicting with his social life. "It
doesn't prevent me from socializing,"
he explained. "The style of my
socialization may be different,
though. I feel kind of like I'm there to
show the other guys that they don't
have to drink if they don't want to."
The 30 members of Navigators, a
third group in SCEM, are led by Paul
Stoltenberg and his wife Colleen in
group meetings, singing, prayer and
small-group Bible studies every Tues
day evening.
"Our stated purpose is to help
equip people in their walk with God
and in their relationship with Him
and in their ability to communicate
the news about God to others," Stol
tenberg explained.
Evangelizing is central to
Navigators. "If you're hungry and
you know how to find food, you

should show someone else how to get
it," Stoltenberg said. "It's very im
portant to our people to share the
love of God."
He emphasized the importance of
incorporating faith into daily life. "I
think that the Bible and a person's
faith you can't separate from life here
at Stanford or anything else."
Members of SAM not associated
with either the Ecumenical Ministries
or SCEM are the New Life Stanford
Fellowship, the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter Day Saints and the
B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundation, the
Jewish organization.
The 20 members of New Life Stan
ford Fellowship, operating in con
junction with the New Life Church,
work "mostly to provide support for
each other, not so much on evange
lism or larger campus activities, be
cause we felt we were a little small for
that," said Lori Crupp, student co
ordinator.
"Worship is perhaps more directed
toward working in the Holy Spirit,"
she explained. "The emphasis is on
learning the gifts of the Holy Spirit."
Crupp sees no conflicts between
her religion and her relationship with
her non-religious friends. "They
seem to be fairly open about our
faith," she said.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Lat
ter Day Saints (LDS), affiliated with
the church in Palo Alto, provides
Sunday worship services, a women's
organization, a men's organization,
cultural, social and religious speakers

and service projects, according to
Bishop Dave Ellison.
Ellison stressed a family atmos
phere among the members of LDS.
"We provide for our students what's
called a family evening on Monday
evening. It's a chance to get together
as a group for socializing and reli
gion," he said. "We try to be a family
away from home for the 65 to 70
members of our faith."
Charity work is another major
focus of LDS. "We have a committee
of members who actively look for
charities we can support," Ellison
said, mentioning an after school day
care project for children in East Palo
Alto.
Sophomore Elayne Wells says she
appreciates LDS for its close atmos
phere. "When I came here last year
as a freshman, it was like an immedi
ate family," she recalled.
When asked whether she saw a
conflict between secular norms and
the values of LDS, Wells observed
that "epecially with our church, it's
very geared to a non-secular type of
attitude. We're taught to be in the
world and not necessarily of the
world in terms of our types of stand
ards.
"I came here to Stanford with very
firm convictions," Wells continued.
"I think it's been very interesting to
see how they've been challenged."
Wells noted that her non-religious
friends sometimes don't understand
her religious ethics. "A lot of times
they question them, and they might

think they're a little ridiculous and a
little old-fashioned, but as long as you
don't apologize for them, they
(friends) respect you," she said.
Stanford Hillel, the Jewish organi
zation on campus, provids Shabbat
services on Fridays and Torah study
on Saturdays.
"Stanford Hillel is a group that
tries to meet the needs — religious,
cultural and political — of all Jewish
people at Stanford," explained Rabbi
Ari Cartun.
Cartun listed religious services, fes
tivals, classes, the Israel Action Com
mittee, the World Jewry Committee,
the Stanford Jewish Appeal, fund
raisers, movies, parties and films as
some of Hillel's functions. He also
mentioned a 500-volume library and
a newspaper called the Mosaic.
"I'm not so concerned with spread
ing the word as spreading right infor
mation," Cartun explained.
Ethan Orlinsky, co-president of
Hillel with Susan Tucker, said that to
him, "there's more of a concern for
the cultural and political aspects than
for the religious aspects."
Orlinsky said of Hillel, "It's a gat
hering place for students to share
their views about issues, as well as a
place to meet with friends."
An active social committee plans
functions that " in some ways relate
to Jewish activities, but not necessar
ily as the main focus," Orlinsky said.
For a growing number of Stanford
students, worship services, Bible
studies and community outreach pro
grams are becoming part of the col

"For me, a Stanford education —

, The Rev. Byron Bland, director of
United Campus Christian Ministry
(UCCM) said, "All religious groups
that wish to work on campus are re
quired to submit applications through
the nondenominational Memorial
Church and to become a part of Stan
ford Associated Ministries. New
groups are continually asking to be
included, and joining is a fairly simple
procedure."
First called United Campus Mini
stries and then Stanford United Mini
stries, SAM originated in 1966.
Before then, denominational mini
stries were not allowed on campus.
"Stanford Associated Ministries is
a way of coordinating the denomina
tions," Hamerton-Kelly, director of
SAM, explained. He estimates that
approximately 2,000 students of
various denominations currently
utilize SAM.
"We have broad goals for Stanford
Associated Ministries," said
Hamerton-Kelly. "One is religious
cooperation," he said. "One hopes
that that would lead to a better un
derstanding among religous groups. It
serves the needs of the students at
Stanford."
Several of the organizations
belonging to SAM are grouped to
gether in the Ecumenical Ministries
at Stanford. These include the Epis
copal Fellowship (Canterbury Fel
lowship), the Newman Center,
UCCM, Memorial Church and the
Lutheran Center. Together, the five
ministries work to solve community
and world problems and offer Chris
tian fellowship and activities.
The Canterbury Fellowship, associ
ated with St. Bede's, Holy Trinity, St.
Mark's, All Saints and Christ Church,
offers a Eucharist Tuesdays at noon.
The main objective of the organi
zation is "to have representation of
the Episcopal Church and the
Anglican Communion here at Stan
ford," according to the Rev.

Penelope Duckworth, who just took
over leadership of the Canterbury
Fellowship on May 1.
Describing the Episcopalian
Church, Duckworth said, "It's often
been called the thinking person's
church. We try to balance the Bible,
tradition and reason."
Duckworth noted that evangelism
has a role in the church. "I think
evangelism is an important aspect of
our faith," she explained, admitting
however, that "the Episcopal Church
may not be as openly aggressive or
evangelical as other religions."
Approximately 20 students cur
rently are active in the Canterbury
Fellowship.
"I owe much of my happiness just
to them being there," said Camm
Macguire, who along with Noelle
Morris is a student fellow of Canter
bury. "It's just meant the world to
me, and 1 don't see how I could have
done it any other way," Macguire
said.
Both Macguire and Duckworth
stressed social awareness and com
munity service as important activities
of the Canterbury Fellowship.
"I think a real Christian experience
at Stanford involves a lot of interac
tion outside of Stanford," said Mac
guire. "That's always got to be what
the main focus is: What can we do to
realize God's mission on earth?"
Citing the Ecumenical Hunger
Project and the Stanford Christian
Student Movement as rewarding
community service organizations,
Macguire said of the relationship be
tween his faith and charity work," It's
just basic human love and caring
when you accept it as a tenet of your
faith."
Macguire added, "What I'd like to
see eventually is a lot of liaison be
tween the Stanford Volunteer Net
work and the student Christian
groups."
The Newman Center, a Catholic
organization affiliated with St. Ann's
Chapel, offers daily Mass at the Club
house.
The Rev. Eugene Boyle, director
of the center, said the center's objec
tives are "to provide for our congre
gation the best possible experience of
the Catholic community — that
would be the primary goal of our
group."
The Newman Center is not openly
evangelical, according to Boyle.
"Preaching the Gospel is of essence
to Christianity, so it is an objective of
Catholicism. We do not engage in
overt proselytizing. We spread the
Gospel through our example and
through our word," he said.
The Newman Center provides
services such as liturgical worship,
educational programs, Bible studies,
discussion groups, retreats and social
activities.
Like Duckworth and Macguire,
Boyle emphasized the importance of
volunteer work to the Newman Cen
ter. "We do have a very important
outreach program of community ser

vice at local hospitals, day care
centers and child care centers," he
Said.
"1 made a choice to devote a lot of
time to the Newman Center, and I
think I'm a better person for it,"
Slaveck said.
The center, "offers a Catholic com
munity, allowing me to learn more
about my faith and practice my
faith," she said. "I think a lot of
people struggle with, 'How do I
combine what 1 believe in my faith
with what I practice and what I do?' "
Slaveck praised the support provided
by the Newman Center, saying,
"There's always a forum to talk about
that kind of thing. There are all kinds
of people who've faced the same
problems."
Slaveck pointed out that people
who are not Catholic are also
welcome to participate in Newman
Center activities. "We try to meet
people where they're at," she ex
plained.
UCCM, incorporating Presbyter
ian, Methodist, United Church of
Christ and American Baptist
denominations, offers worship and
supper on Wednesday evenings and
discussions on ethical issues.
"It is our goal to engage people in
active Christian faith," explained
Bland, director of UCCM. "It ad
dresses and involves people in issues
of the day. I think we take all aspects
of that seriously."
According to Bland, a large part of
UCCM's role involves community
service. "One big thing I think
UCCM is is a focus for ecumenicity,
where people of different back
grounds come together and interact
with each other. It's an opportunity to
develop Christian responsibility," he
explained.
UCCM has helped instigate the
Peace Studies program and the Sci
ence and Technology program and is
active in the Ecumenical Hunger
Project.
The Lutheran Campus Ministry,
associated with University Lutheran
Church, offers soup and supper on
Sunday evenings, Bible studies,
retreats and counseling.
"I guess we're unique here, be
cause unlike many of the other organ
izations, we do have our own church
here," commented the Rev. Sue
Hedahl, interim pastor of the church.
Hedahl said, "I think Stanford is a
wonderful context in which one is
forced to ask lots of questions (such
as) 'What does it mean to be a Chris
tian?' " i
Lutheran student John Hensala
said, "It's nice to share the
denomination with everyone in the
group. It's just a kind of angle on
Christianity that we share."
He added, "We're trying to stress
that it's not only Lutheran and
nobody else, but that's just kind of
the starting point for it."
Another member of SAM, Stan
ford Christian Evangelical Ministries
(SCEM), includes Stanford Christian

Fellowship (Intervarsity), Campus
Crusade, Navigators, Menlo Univer
sity Fellowship (Menlo Park Presby
terian Church), Seminar 80
(Peninsula Bible Church), Interna
tional Students Christian Outreach
and Parakaleo.
The largest of these organizations
is Intervarsity, boasting approxi
mately 150 members who take part in
large group meetings on Wednesday
evenings, daily prayer at noon, Bible
studies and retreats.
"1 think our goal is to establish a
group or a fellowship of students to
help each other and encourage each
other in growing as Christians, that
will work together in understanding
the Scripture and living it out," said

staff leader Bill Glad.
Freshman Dan McWilliams com
mented, "The group helps a lot in
really living out what you hear about
and what you're taught. It's definitely
not an easy thing to integrate the
secular with your faith."
Sophomore Andrew Crowell
agreed, saying, "There are a lot of
value conflicts in being a Christian at
an essentially non-Christian
campus."
Crowell objects most to "the work
study-get-rich attitude a lot of people
have. I don't want to come across as
sounding cynical, but it's more of a
frustration on my part," he said.
Both McWilliams and Crowell list
"spreading God's word" as important

David Kim/Daily
and find that Intervarsity encourages
them.
"I view it as a very active thing,"
Crowell said. "They really stress
enacting your own faith and letting
your friends know."
According to McWilliams, "It's
more of a one-on-one, more like
loving people into the kingdom (of
God), not like trying to hit them over
the head with a Bible. It's not seeing
people as objects and trying to con
vert them, but seeing them as human
beings who need love and need God,
basically."
Another member of SCEM,
Campus Crusade for Christ, offers

Bible studies, fellowship, disciple
groups and retreats under the leader
ship of Dave Moore.
Campus Crusade member Rich
Goode, describes the organization as
"strongly evangelist."
"It's helped me to keep what I feel
is the proper perspective on life,"
Goode said. "And it's helped me see
the importance of reaching others
with the word of God."
Goode, also a member of the Phi
Psi fraternity, does not see his faith as
conflicting with his social life. "It
doesn't prevent me from socializing,"
he explained. "The style of my
socialization may be different,
though. I feel kind of like I'm there to
show the other guys that they don't
have to drink if they don't want to."
The 30 members of Navigators, a
third group in SCEM, are led by Paul
Stoltenberg and his wife Colleen in
group meetings, singing, prayer and
small-group Bible studies every Tues
day evening.
"Our stated purpose is to help
equip people in their walk with God
and in their relationship with Him
and in their ability to communicate
the news about God to others," Stol
tenberg explained.
Evangelizing is central to
Navigators. "If you're hungry and
you know how to find food, you

should show someone else how to get
it," Stoltenberg said. "It's very im
portant to our people to share the
love of God."
He emphasized the importance of
incorporating faith into daily life. "I
think that the Bible and a person's
faith you can't separate from life here
at Stanford or anything else."
Members of SAM not associated
with either the Ecumenical Ministries
or SCEM are the New Life Stanford
Fellowship, the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter Day Saints and the
B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundation, the
Jewish organization.
The 20 members of New Life Stan
ford Fellowship, operating in con
junction with the New Life Church,
work "mostly to provide support for
each other, not so much on evange
lism or larger campus activities, be
cause we felt we were a little small for
that," said Lori Crupp, student co
ordinator.
"Worship is perhaps more directed
toward working in the Holy Spirit,"
she explained. "The emphasis is on
learning the gifts of the Holy Spirit."
Crupp sees no conflicts between
her religion and her relationship with
her non-religious friends. "They
seem to be fairly open about our
faith," she said.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Lat
ter Day Saints (LDS), affiliated with
the church in Palo Alto, provides
Sunday worship services, a women's
organization, a men's organization,
cultural, social and religious speakers

and service projects, according to
Bishop Dave Ellison.
Ellison stressed a family atmos
phere among the members of LDS.
"We provide for our students what's
called a family evening on Monday
evening. It's a chance to get together
as a group for socializing and reli
gion," he said. "We try to be a family
away from home for the 65 to 70
members of our faith."
Charity work is another major
focus of LDS. "We have a committee
of members who actively look for
charities we can support," Ellison
said, mentioning an after school day
care project for children in East Palo
Alto.
Sophomore Elayne Wells says she
appreciates LDS for its close atmos
phere. "When I came here last year
as a freshman, it was like an immedi
ate family," she recalled.
When asked whether she saw a
conflict between secular norms and
the values of LDS, Wells observed
that "epecially with our church, it's
very geared to a non-secular type of
attitude. We're taught to be in the
world and not necessarily of the
world in terms of our types of stand
ards.
"I came here to Stanford with very
firm convictions," Wells continued.
"I think it's been very interesting to
see how they've been challenged."
Wells noted that her non-religious
friends sometimes don't understand
her religious ethics. "A lot of times
they question them, and they might

think they're a little ridiculous and a
little old-fashioned, but as long as you
don't apologize for them, they
(friends) respect you," she said.
Stanford Hillel, the Jewish organi
zation on campus, provids Shabbat
services on Fridays and Torah study
on Saturdays.
"Stanford Hillel is a group that
tries to meet the needs — religious,
cultural and political — of all Jewish
people at Stanford," explained Rabbi
Ari Cartun.
Cartun listed religious services, fes
tivals, classes, the Israel Action Com
mittee, the World Jewry Committee,
the Stanford Jewish Appeal, fund
raisers, movies, parties and films as
some of Hillel's functions. He also
mentioned a 500-volume library and
a newspaper called the Mosaic.
"I'm not so concerned with spread
ing the word as spreading right infor
mation," Cartun explained.
Ethan Orlinsky, co-president of
Hillel with Susan Tucker, said that to
him, "there's more of a concern for
the cultural and political aspects than
for the religious aspects."
Orlinsky said of Hillel, "It's a gat
hering place for students to share
their views about issues, as well as a
place to meet with friends."
An active social committee plans
functions that " in some ways relate
to Jewish activities, but not necessar
ily as the main focus," Orlinsky said.
For a growing number of Stanford
students, worship services, Bible
studies and community outreach pro
grams are becoming part of the col
lege experience.
"For me, a Stanford education —
or any education period — is a lot
more important than what you learn
in books," explained Marivern
Slaveck, student coordinator for the
Newman Center, the Catholic organi
zation on campus.
Dean of the Chapel Robert
Hamerton-Kelly says he has noticed
an increase in student involvement in
religious activities since he first came
to Stanford 12 years ago.
In addition to Memorial Church's
nondenominational student services,
approximately 23 groups comprising
Stanford Associated Ministries
(SAM) meet the needs of many stu
dents from Christian and Jewish
backgrounds.
Before becoming active at Stan
ford, religious organizations must
join SAM.
, The Rev. Byron Bland, director of
United Campus Christian Ministry
(UCCM) said, "All religious groups

cooperation," he said. "One hopes
that that would lead to a better un
derstanding among religous groups. It
serves the needs of the students at
Stanford."
Several of the organizations
belonging to SAM are grouped to
gether in the Ecumenical Ministries
at Stanford. These include the Epis
copal Fellowship (Canterbury Fel
lowship), the Newman Center,
UCCM, Memorial Church and the
Lutheran Center. Together, the five
ministries work to solve community
and world problems and offer Chris
tian fellowship and activities.
The Canterbury Fellowship, associ
ated with St. Bede's, Holy Trinity, St.
Mark's, All Saints and Christ Church,
offers a Eucharist Tuesdays at noon.
The main objective of the organi
zation is "to have representation of
the Episcopal Church and the
Anglican Communion here at Stan
ford," according to the Rev.

Penelope Duckworth, who just took
over leadership of the Canterbury
Fellowship on May 1.
Describing the Episcopalian
Church, Duckworth said, "It's often
been called the thinking person's
church. We try to balance the Bible,
tradition and reason."
Duckworth noted that evangelism
has a role in the church. "I think
evangelism is an important aspect of
our faith," she explained, admitting
however, that "the Episcopal Church
may not be as openly aggressive or
evangelical as other religions."
Approximately 20 students cur
rently are active in the Canterbury
Fellowship.
"I owe much of my happiness just
to them being there," said Camm
Macguire, who along with Noelle
Morris is a student fellow of Canter
bury. "It's just meant the world to
me, and 1 don't see how I could have
done it any other way," Macguire
said.
Both Macguire and Duckworth
stressed social awareness and com
munity service as important activities
of the Canterbury Fellowship.
"I think a real Christian experience
at Stanford involves a lot of interac
tion outside of Stanford," said Mac
guire. "That's always got to be what
the main focus is: What can we do to
realize God's mission on earth?"
Citing the Ecumenical Hunger
Project and the Stanford Christian
Student Movement as rewarding
community service organizations,
Macguire said of the relationship be
tween his faith and charity work," It's
just basic human love and caring
when you accept it as a tenet of your
faith."
Macguire added, "What I'd like to
see eventually is a lot of liaison be
tween the Stanford Volunteer Net
work and the student Christian
groups."
The Newman Center, a Catholic
organization affiliated with St. Ann's
Chapel, offers daily Mass at the Club
house.
The Rev. Eugene Boyle, director
of the center, said the center's objec
tives are "to provide for our congre
gation the best possible experience of
the Catholic community — that
would be the primary goal of our
group."
The Newman Center is not openly
evangelical, according to Boyle.
"Preaching the Gospel is of essence
to Christianity, so it is an objective of
Catholicism. We do not engage in
overt proselytizing. We spread the
Gospel through our example and
through our word," he said.
The Newman Center provides
services such as liturgical worship,
educational programs, Bible studies,
discussion groups, retreats and social
activities.
Like Duckworth and Macguire,
Boyle emphasized the importance of
volunteer work to the Newman Cen
ter. "We do have a very important
outreach program of community ser

vice at local hospitals, day care
centers and child care centers," he
Said.
"1 made a choice to devote a lot of
time to the Newman Center, and I
think I'm a better person for it,"
Slaveck said.
The center, "offers a Catholic com
munity, allowing me to learn more
about my faith and practice my
faith," she said. "I think a lot of
people struggle with, 'How do I
combine what 1 believe in my faith
with what I practice and what I do?' "
Slaveck praised the support provided
by the Newman Center, saying,
"There's always a forum to talk about
that kind of thing. There are all kinds
of people who've faced the same
problems."
Slaveck pointed out that people
who are not Catholic are also
welcome to participate in Newman
Center activities. "We try to meet
people where they're at," she ex
plained.
UCCM, incorporating Presbyter
ian, Methodist, United Church of
Christ and American Baptist
denominations, offers worship and
supper on Wednesday evenings and
discussions on ethical issues.
"It is our goal to engage people in
active Christian faith," explained
Bland, director of UCCM. "It ad
dresses and involves people in issues
of the day. I think we take all aspects
of that seriously."
According to Bland, a large part of
UCCM's role involves community
service. "One big thing I think
UCCM is is a focus for ecumenicity,
where people of different back
grounds come together and interact
with each other. It's an opportunity to
develop Christian responsibility," he
explained.
UCCM has helped instigate the
Peace Studies program and the Sci
ence and Technology program and is
active in the Ecumenical Hunger
Project.
The Lutheran Campus Ministry,
associated with University Lutheran
Church, offers soup and supper on
Sunday evenings, Bible studies,
retreats and counseling.
"I guess we're unique here, be
cause unlike many of the other organ
izations, we do have our own church
here," commented the Rev. Sue
Hedahl, interim pastor of the church.
Hedahl said, "I think Stanford is a
wonderful context in which one is
forced to ask lots of questions (such
as) 'What does it mean to be a Chris
tian?' " i
Lutheran student John Hensala
said, "It's nice to share the
denomination with everyone in the
group. It's just a kind of angle on
Christianity that we share."
He added, "We're trying to stress
that it's not only Lutheran and
nobody else, but that's just kind of
the starting point for it."
Another member of SAM, Stan
ford Christian Evangelical Ministries
(SCEM), includes Stanford Christian

Fellowship (Intervarsity), Campus
Crusade, Navigators, Menlo Univer
sity Fellowship (Menlo Park Presby
terian Church), Seminar 80
(Peninsula Bible Church), Interna
tional Students Christian Outreach
and Parakaleo.
The largest of these organizations
is Intervarsity, boasting approxi
mately 150 members who take part in
large group meetings on Wednesday
evenings, daily prayer at noon, Bible
studies and retreats.
"1 think our goal is to establish a
group or a fellowship of students to
help each other and encourage each
other in growing as Christians, that
will work together in understanding
the Scripture and living it out," said

staff leader Bill Glad.
Freshman Dan McWilliams com
mented, "The group helps a lot in
really living out what you hear about
and what you're taught. It's definitely
not an easy thing to integrate the
secular with your faith."
Sophomore Andrew Crowell
agreed, saying, "There are a lot of
value conflicts in being a Christian at
an essentially non-Christian
campus."
Crowell objects most to "the work
study-get-rich attitude a lot of people
have. I don't want to come across as
sounding cynical, but it's more of a
frustration on my part," he said.
Both McWilliams and Crowell list
"spreading God's word" as important

David Kim/Daily
and find that Intervarsity encourages
them.
"I view it as a very active thing,"
Crowell said. "They really stress
enacting your own faith and letting
your friends know."
According to McWilliams, "It's
more of a one-on-one, more like
loving people into the kingdom (of
God), not like trying to hit them over
the head with a Bible. It's not seeing
people as objects and trying to con
vert them, but seeing them as human
beings who need love and need God,
basically."
Another member of SCEM,
Campus Crusade for Christ, offers

Bible studies, fellowship, disciple
groups and retreats under the leader
ship of Dave Moore.
Campus Crusade member Rich
Goode, describes the organization as
"strongly evangelist."
"It's helped me to keep what I feel
is the proper perspective on life,"
Goode said. "And it's helped me see
the importance of reaching others
with the word of God."
Goode, also a member of the Phi
Psi fraternity, does not see his faith as
conflicting with his social life. "It
doesn't prevent me from socializing,"
he explained. "The style of my
socialization may be different,
though. I feel kind of like I'm there to
show the other guys that they don't
have to drink if they don't want to."
The 30 members of Navigators, a
third group in SCEM, are led by Paul
Stoltenberg and his wife Colleen in
group meetings, singing, prayer and
small-group Bible studies every Tues
day evening.
"Our stated purpose is to help
equip people in their walk with God
and in their relationship with Him
and in their ability to communicate
the news about God to others," Stol
tenberg explained.
Evangelizing is central to
Navigators. "If you're hungry and
you know how to find food, you

should show someone else how to get
it," Stoltenberg said. "It's very im
portant to our people to share the
love of God."
He emphasized the importance of
incorporating faith into daily life. "I
think that the Bible and a person's
faith you can't separate from life here
at Stanford or anything else."
Members of SAM not associated
with either the Ecumenical Ministries
or SCEM are the New Life Stanford
Fellowship, the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter Day Saints and the
B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundation, the
Jewish organization.
The 20 members of New Life Stan
ford Fellowship, operating in con
junction with the New Life Church,
work "mostly to provide support for
each other, not so much on evange
lism or larger campus activities, be
cause we felt we were a little small for
that," said Lori Crupp, student co
ordinator.
"Worship is perhaps more directed
toward working in the Holy Spirit,"
she explained. "The emphasis is on
learning the gifts of the Holy Spirit."
Crupp sees no conflicts between
her religion and her relationship with
her non-religious friends. "They
seem to be fairly open about our
faith," she said.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Lat
ter Day Saints (LDS), affiliated with
the church in Palo Alto, provides
Sunday worship services, a women's
organization, a men's organization,
cultural, social and religious speakers

and service projects, according to
Bishop Dave Ellison.
Ellison stressed a family atmos
phere among the members of LDS.
"We provide for our students what's
called a family evening on Monday
evening. It's a chance to get together
as a group for socializing and reli
gion," he said. "We try to be a family
away from home for the 65 to 70
members of our faith."
Charity work is another major
focus of LDS. "We have a committee
of members who actively look for
charities we can support," Ellison
said, mentioning an after school day
care project for children in East Palo
Alto.
Sophomore Elayne Wells says she
appreciates LDS for its close atmos
phere. "When I came here last year
as a freshman, it was like an immedi
ate family," she recalled.
When asked whether she saw a
conflict between secular norms and
the values of LDS, Wells observed
that "epecially with our church, it's
very geared to a non-secular type of
attitude. We're taught to be in the
world and not necessarily of the
world in terms of our types of stand
ards.
"I came here to Stanford with very
firm convictions," Wells continued.
"I think it's been very interesting to
see how they've been challenged."
Wells noted that her non-religious
friends sometimes don't understand
her religious ethics. "A lot of times
they question them, and they might

think they're a little ridiculous and a
little old-fashioned, but as long as you
don't apologize for them, they
(friends) respect you," she said.
Stanford Hillel, the Jewish organi
zation on campus, provids Shabbat
services on Fridays and Torah study
on Saturdays.
"Stanford Hillel is a group that
tries to meet the needs — religious,
cultural and political — of all Jewish
people at Stanford," explained Rabbi
Ari Cartun.
Cartun listed religious services, fes
tivals, classes, the Israel Action Com
mittee, the World Jewry Committee,
the Stanford Jewish Appeal, fund
raisers, movies, parties and films as
some of Hillel's functions. He also
mentioned a 500-volume library and
a newspaper called the Mosaic.
"I'm not so concerned with spread
ing the word as spreading right infor
mation," Cartun explained.
Ethan Orlinsky, co-president of
Hillel with Susan Tucker, said that to
him, "there's more of a concern for
the cultural and political aspects than
for the religious aspects."
Orlinsky said of Hillel, "It's a gat
hering place for students to share
their views about issues, as well as a
place to meet with friends."
An active social committee plans
functions that " in some ways relate
to Jewish activities, but not necessar
ily as the main focus," Orlinsky said.
For a growing number of Stanford
students, worship services, Bible
studies and community outreach pro
grams are becoming part of the col
lege experience.
"For me, a Stanford education —
or any education period — is a lot
more important than what you learn
in books," explained Marivern
Slaveck, student coordinator for the
Newman Center, the Catholic organi
zation on campus.
Dean of the Chapel Robert
Hamerton-Kelly says he has noticed
an increase in student involvement in
religious activities since he first came
to Stanford 12 years ago.
In addition to Memorial Church's
nondenominational student services,
approximately 23 groups comprising
Stanford Associated Ministries
(SAM) meet the needs of many stu
dents from Christian and Jewish
backgrounds.
Before becoming active at Stan
ford, religious organizations must
join SAM.
, The Rev. Byron Bland, director of
United Campus Christian Ministry
(UCCM) said, "All religious groups
that wish to work on campus are re
quired to submit applications through
the nondenominational Memorial
Church and to become a part of Stan
ford Associated Ministries. New
groups are continually asking to be
included, and joining is a fairly simple
procedure."
First called United Campus Mini
stries and then Stanford United Mini
stries, SAM originated in 1966.
Before then, denominational mini
stries were not allowed on campus.
"Stanford Associated Ministries is
a way of coordinating the denomina
tions," Hamerton-Kelly, director of
SAM, explained. He estimates that
approximately 2,000 students of
various denominations currently
utilize SAM.
"We have broad goals for Stanford
Associated Ministries," said
Hamerton-Kelly. "One is religious
cooperation," he said. "One hopes
that that would lead to a better un
derstanding among religous groups. It
serves the needs of the students at
Stanford."

over leadership of the Canterbury
Fellowship on May 1.
Describing the Episcopalian
Church, Duckworth said, "It's often
been called the thinking person's
church. We try to balance the Bible,
tradition and reason."
Duckworth noted that evangelism
has a role in the church. "I think
evangelism is an important aspect of
our faith," she explained, admitting
however, that "the Episcopal Church
may not be as openly aggressive or
evangelical as other religions."
Approximately 20 students cur
rently are active in the Canterbury
Fellowship.
"I owe much of my happiness just
to them being there," said Camm
Macguire, who along with Noelle
Morris is a student fellow of Canter
bury. "It's just meant the world to
me, and 1 don't see how I could have
done it any other way," Macguire
said.
Both Macguire and Duckworth
stressed social awareness and com
munity service as important activities
of the Canterbury Fellowship.
"I think a real Christian experience
at Stanford involves a lot of interac
tion outside of Stanford," said Mac
guire. "That's always got to be what
the main focus is: What can we do to
realize God's mission on earth?"
Citing the Ecumenical Hunger
Project and the Stanford Christian
Student Movement as rewarding
community service organizations,
Macguire said of the relationship be
tween his faith and charity work," It's
just basic human love and caring
when you accept it as a tenet of your
faith."
Macguire added, "What I'd like to
see eventually is a lot of liaison be
tween the Stanford Volunteer Net
work and the student Christian
groups."
The Newman Center, a Catholic
organization affiliated with St. Ann's
Chapel, offers daily Mass at the Club
house.
The Rev. Eugene Boyle, director
of the center, said the center's objec
tives are "to provide for our congre
gation the best possible experience of
the Catholic community — that
would be the primary goal of our
group."
The Newman Center is not openly
evangelical, according to Boyle.
"Preaching the Gospel is of essence
to Christianity, so it is an objective of
Catholicism. We do not engage in
overt proselytizing. We spread the
Gospel through our example and
through our word," he said.
The Newman Center provides
services such as liturgical worship,
educational programs, Bible studies,
discussion groups, retreats and social
activities.
Like Duckworth and Macguire,
Boyle emphasized the importance of
volunteer work to the Newman Cen
ter. "We do have a very important
outreach program of community ser

vice at local hospitals, day care
centers and child care centers," he
Said.
"1 made a choice to devote a lot of
time to the Newman Center, and I
think I'm a better person for it,"
Slaveck said.
The center, "offers a Catholic com
munity, allowing me to learn more
about my faith and practice my
faith," she said. "I think a lot of
people struggle with, 'How do I
combine what 1 believe in my faith
with what I practice and what I do?' "
Slaveck praised the support provided
by the Newman Center, saying,
"There's always a forum to talk about
that kind of thing. There are all kinds
of people who've faced the same
problems."
Slaveck pointed out that people
who are not Catholic are also
welcome to participate in Newman
Center activities. "We try to meet
people where they're at," she ex
plained.
UCCM, incorporating Presbyter
ian, Methodist, United Church of
Christ and American Baptist
denominations, offers worship and
supper on Wednesday evenings and
discussions on ethical issues.
"It is our goal to engage people in
active Christian faith," explained
Bland, director of UCCM. "It ad
dresses and involves people in issues
of the day. I think we take all aspects
of that seriously."
According to Bland, a large part of
UCCM's role involves community
service. "One big thing I think
UCCM is is a focus for ecumenicity,
where people of different back
grounds come together and interact
with each other. It's an opportunity to
develop Christian responsibility," he
explained.
UCCM has helped instigate the
Peace Studies program and the Sci
ence and Technology program and is
active in the Ecumenical Hunger
Project.
The Lutheran Campus Ministry,
associated with University Lutheran
Church, offers soup and supper on
Sunday evenings, Bible studies,
retreats and counseling.
"I guess we're unique here, be
cause unlike many of the other organ
izations, we do have our own church
here," commented the Rev. Sue
Hedahl, interim pastor of the church.
Hedahl said, "I think Stanford is a
wonderful context in which one is
forced to ask lots of questions (such
as) 'What does it mean to be a Chris
tian?' " i
Lutheran student John Hensala
said, "It's nice to share the
denomination with everyone in the
group. It's just a kind of angle on
Christianity that we share."
He added, "We're trying to stress
that it's not only Lutheran and
nobody else, but that's just kind of
the starting point for it."
Another member of SAM, Stan
ford Christian Evangelical Ministries
(SCEM), includes Stanford Christian

Fellowship (Intervarsity), Campus
Crusade, Navigators, Menlo Univer
sity Fellowship (Menlo Park Presby
terian Church), Seminar 80
(Peninsula Bible Church), Interna
tional Students Christian Outreach
and Parakaleo.
The largest of these organizations
is Intervarsity, boasting approxi
mately 150 members who take part in
large group meetings on Wednesday
evenings, daily prayer at noon, Bible
studies and retreats.
"1 think our goal is to establish a
group or a fellowship of students to
help each other and encourage each
other in growing as Christians, that
will work together in understanding
the Scripture and living it out," said

staff leader Bill Glad.
Freshman Dan McWilliams com
mented, "The group helps a lot in
really living out what you hear about
and what you're taught. It's definitely
not an easy thing to integrate the
secular with your faith."
Sophomore Andrew Crowell
agreed, saying, "There are a lot of
value conflicts in being a Christian at
an essentially non-Christian
campus."
Crowell objects most to "the work
study-get-rich attitude a lot of people
have. I don't want to come across as
sounding cynical, but it's more of a
frustration on my part," he said.
Both McWilliams and Crowell list
"spreading God's word" as important

David Kim/Daily
and find that Intervarsity encourages
them.
"I view it as a very active thing,"
Crowell said. "They really stress
enacting your own faith and letting
your friends know."
According to McWilliams, "It's
more of a one-on-one, more like
loving people into the kingdom (of
God), not like trying to hit them over
the head with a Bible. It's not seeing
people as objects and trying to con
vert them, but seeing them as human
beings who need love and need God,
basically."
Another member of SCEM,
Campus Crusade for Christ, offers

Bible studies, fellowship, disciple
groups and retreats under the leader
ship of Dave Moore.
Campus Crusade member Rich
Goode, describes the organization as
"strongly evangelist."
"It's helped me to keep what I feel
is the proper perspective on life,"
Goode said. "And it's helped me see
the importance of reaching others
with the word of God."
Goode, also a member of the Phi
Psi fraternity, does not see his faith as
conflicting with his social life. "It
doesn't prevent me from socializing,"
he explained. "The style of my
socialization may be different,
though. I feel kind of like I'm there to
show the other guys that they don't
have to drink if they don't want to."
The 30 members of Navigators, a
third group in SCEM, are led by Paul
Stoltenberg and his wife Colleen in
group meetings, singing, prayer and
small-group Bible studies every Tues
day evening.
"Our stated purpose is to help
equip people in their walk with God
and in their relationship with Him
and in their ability to communicate
the news about God to others," Stol
tenberg explained.
Evangelizing is central to
Navigators. "If you're hungry and
you know how to find food, you

should show someone else how to get
it," Stoltenberg said. "It's very im
portant to our people to share the
love of God."
He emphasized the importance of
incorporating faith into daily life. "I
think that the Bible and a person's
faith you can't separate from life here
at Stanford or anything else."
Members of SAM not associated
with either the Ecumenical Ministries
or SCEM are the New Life Stanford
Fellowship, the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter Day Saints and the
B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundation, the
Jewish organization.
The 20 members of New Life Stan
ford Fellowship, operating in con
junction with the New Life Church,
work "mostly to provide support for
each other, not so much on evange
lism or larger campus activities, be
cause we felt we were a little small for
that," said Lori Crupp, student co
ordinator.
"Worship is perhaps more directed
toward working in the Holy Spirit,"
she explained. "The emphasis is on
learning the gifts of the Holy Spirit."
Crupp sees no conflicts between
her religion and her relationship with
her non-religious friends. "They
seem to be fairly open about our
faith," she said.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Lat
ter Day Saints (LDS), affiliated with
the church in Palo Alto, provides
Sunday worship services, a women's
organization, a men's organization,
cultural, social and religious speakers

and service projects, according to
Bishop Dave Ellison.
Ellison stressed a family atmos
phere among the members of LDS.
"We provide for our students what's
called a family evening on Monday
evening. It's a chance to get together
as a group for socializing and reli
gion," he said. "We try to be a family
away from home for the 65 to 70
members of our faith."
Charity work is another major
focus of LDS. "We have a committee
of members who actively look for
charities we can support," Ellison
said, mentioning an after school day
care project for children in East Palo
Alto.
Sophomore Elayne Wells says she
appreciates LDS for its close atmos
phere. "When I came here last year
as a freshman, it was like an immedi
ate family," she recalled.
When asked whether she saw a
conflict between secular norms and
the values of LDS, Wells observed
that "epecially with our church, it's
very geared to a non-secular type of
attitude. We're taught to be in the
world and not necessarily of the
world in terms of our types of stand
ards.
"I came here to Stanford with very
firm convictions," Wells continued.
"I think it's been very interesting to
see how they've been challenged."
Wells noted that her non-religious
friends sometimes don't understand
her religious ethics. "A lot of times
they question them, and they might

think they're a little ridiculous and a
little old-fashioned, but as long as you
don't apologize for them, they
(friends) respect you," she said.
Stanford Hillel, the Jewish organi
zation on campus, provids Shabbat
services on Fridays and Torah study
on Saturdays.
"Stanford Hillel is a group that
tries to meet the needs — religious,
cultural and political — of all Jewish
people at Stanford," explained Rabbi
Ari Cartun.
Cartun listed religious services, fes
tivals, classes, the Israel Action Com
mittee, the World Jewry Committee,
the Stanford Jewish Appeal, fund
raisers, movies, parties and films as
some of Hillel's functions. He also
mentioned a 500-volume library and
a newspaper called the Mosaic.
"I'm not so concerned with spread
ing the word as spreading right infor
mation," Cartun explained.
Ethan Orlinsky, co-president of
Hillel with Susan Tucker, said that to
him, "there's more of a concern for
the cultural and political aspects than
for the religious aspects."
Orlinsky said of Hillel, "It's a gat
hering place for students to share
their views about issues, as well as a
place to meet with friends."
An active social committee plans
functions that " in some ways relate
to Jewish activities, but not necessar
ily as the main focus," Orlinsky said.
