## THE 						STANFORD DAILY No aid for Contras 
### 
President Reagan's plans to get and to keep
Nicaragua out of communist hands is not only un
ethical; it is illogical.
The Sandanista regime, for all its faults, was
duly elected by the Nicaraguan people, and so
should be left alone. But if the president, dislik
ing the Marxist bent of the Sandanistas, insists on
meddling with the affairs of the Nicaraguans, he
at least should go about it a bit more sensibly.
A case in point: When Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega recently visited the Soviet Union
— ostensibly to ask for aid, military and other
wise — the White House reportedly was furious.
Its reaction was to announce embargoes against
Nicaragua. It seems to us that severing ties be
tween that country and this could only drive the
Nicaraguans deeper into the arms of the Soviets.
Meanwhile, skirmishes continue in Congress
over aid to the Contras, the Nicaraguan rebels
whom the president has likened to our own
founding fathers. Not surprisingly, the

Republican-controlled Senate passed the presi
dent's plan to send $14 million in aid to the Con
tras, and the Democrat-controlled House
defeated it.
This is not the end of the issue, however. More
versions of aid to the Contras, such as a plan
drafted by a group of Democrats calling for
"humanitarian" aid as opposed to military aid,
are still being debated. We agree with many con
gressmen who have pointed out that sending
humanitarian aid will only serve to free more
funds for weapons. We hope that all pending bills
that propose sending any form of aid to the Con
tras are defeated.
We are pleased to note that our own represen
tative, Ed Zschau — usually a dedicated Republi
can — crossed party lines to vote against aid. We
hope he doesn't succumb to party pressure and
continues to support efforts to establish peace in
Latin America, or at least to let them fight their
own wars.
