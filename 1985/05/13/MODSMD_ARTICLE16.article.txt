## KAL 007 not a spy plane 
### 
Jim Naureckas, in his May 8 viewpoint, provides no
evidence of U.S. culpability in the shooting down of
Korean Air Lines Flight 007 and yet concludes that be
cause the United States has done bad things before, it
must somehow be guilty again. More incredibly, he argues
that the continued absence of evidence over time, makes
American guilt more, rather than less, likely. Conspiracy
theories notwithstanding, I believe a careful review of the
evidence reduces the probability of U.S. wrongdoing.

VIEWPOINT

Naureckas calls for a full investigation. In December
1983, following an exhaustive review by investigators who
were considered experts in the area they were examining
(which most conspiracy theorists are not), the Interna
tional Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) issued a report
which concluded, in part, that KAL 007 had not been on
an intelligence-gathering mission and that the crew was
unaware that it had strayed into Soviet territory. Human
error was found to be the most likley cause of the tragedy.
It was further concluded that the Soviets "did not make
exhaustive efforts to identify the aircraft through in-flight
visual means" probably because they "assumed the
Korean airliner was a spy plane." Several major U.S.
newspapers, including The New York Times (hardly an
administration apologist), reached the same conclusion
after their own independent reviews.
It is perhaps useful to point out that History and Politi
cal Science Prof. Alexander Dallin, while widely
respected as an authority on Soviet affairs, is likewise (by
his own admission) no expert on civil aviation or naviga
tion procedures. Perhaps the reason he "pulls many of his
punches" in the first half of his book is that he prefers to
limit his conclusions to matters dealing with his own area
of expertise. If so, this would be a refreshing change from
most of the articles and books written on this subject. (I
must confess that I have been unable to find a copy of
Dallin's book and must depend on second-hand accounts
of its contents. I suspect Naureckas does also.)
I fully agree that many legitimate questions remain.
Some answers were no doubt contained in KAL 007's
"black box." Recovery of the wreckage could have
resulted in the examination of the plane's navigational
computer and/or determined if the plane was being guided
instead by a magnetic compass heading (the most credible
explanation). It could also have confirmed or refuted the
presence of "spy equipment."
For more than two months, the United States con
ducted extensive search operations in the most likely
crash locations outside the Soviet Union's 12-mile ter
ritorial limits. The initial air search canvassed 3,000
square miles while surface ships carefully combed more
than 150 square miles. The cost of this search effort,

which involved more than 3,000 flying hours and 320 ship
days, exceeded $22 million.
During the American search efforts, international ob
servers and members of the world press were permitted
on board, and ICAO representatives were on the scene to
take immediate possession of any recovered objects. The
Soviets were invited to send observers as well. They
refused. They also refused repeated American requests to
extend the search into Soviet waters off Sakhalin Island
(the most likely crash site). Instead, they constantly
harassed and interfered with the searchers' efforts. The
downed airliner was never located.
American actions were hardly those of a conspirator.
And, if the Soviets really believed their own propaganda
about an American spy mission, why did they impede
rather than assist the effort to find the wreckage? Could it
be because they had a great deal to lose and nothing to
gain by its recovery?
The ICAO scenario remains the most logical and
plausible, even if it is the least likely to generate books
and movies. The simple (and not unprecedented) failure
to switch the autopilot from its magnetic course setting of
246 degrees would have placed KAL 007 along the track
it followed, as expertly detailed by Murray Sayle in his ar
ticle entitled "KEOO7: A Conspiracy of Circumstance" in
the New York Review of Books, further debunks the con
spiracy theories. Naureckas acknowledges this article's
existence. Perhaps he should read it once again.
While the entire story may never be known, in the face
of evidence to the contrary it appears most logical to
assume that human error put KAL 007 over the Soviet
Union on that fateful night. Soviet defensive paranoia and
their assumption (or at least hope) that they had a spy
plane in their sights prompted them to shoot first and ask
questions later. Given the option of either admitting their
mistake or making false allegations in order to shift the
blame, Moscow chose to respond in typical Soviet fashion.
I agree with Naureckas that history is all too full of ex
amples of American wrongdoing, or at least acts of ex
tremely poor judgment. But this does not mean that
everything our government does is wrong or that every
thing it says is untrue. After all, previous U.S. misdeeds
have most often been revealed by the government itself or
by participants who, occasionally for profit but usually on
moral grounds, chose to tell all. It has been 20 months
since the shooting down of KAL 007. Can he find no sig
nificance in the fact that no intelligence officer, radar
operator or aviation official in the United States, Korea or
Japan has yet to step forward and lend credence to any of
the conspiracy theories? Isn't it possible that the reason
for this is simply because no conspiracy exists?

Jim Naureckas, in his May 8 viewpoint, provides no
evidence of U.S. culpability in the shooting down of
Korean Air Lines Flight 007 and yet concludes that be
cause the United States has done bad things before, it
must somehow be guilty again. More incredibly, he argues
that the continued absence of evidence over time, makes
American guilt more, rather than less, likely. Conspiracy
theories notwithstanding, I believe a careful review of the
evidence reduces the probability of U.S. wrongdoing.

VIEWPOINT

Naureckas calls for a full investigation. In December
1983, following an exhaustive review by investigators who
were considered experts in the area they were examining
(which most conspiracy theorists are not), the Interna
tional Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) issued a report
which concluded, in part, that KAL 007 had not been on
an intelligence-gathering mission and that the crew was
unaware that it had strayed into Soviet territory. Human
error was found to be the most likley cause of the tragedy.
It was further concluded that the Soviets "did not make
exhaustive efforts to identify the aircraft through in-flight
visual means" probably because they "assumed the
Korean airliner was a spy plane." Several major U.S.
newspapers, including The New York Times (hardly an
administration apologist), reached the same conclusion
after their own independent reviews.
It is perhaps useful to point out that History and Politi
cal Science Prof. Alexander Dallin, while widely
respected as an authority on Soviet affairs, is likewise (by
his own admission) no expert on civil aviation or naviga
tion procedures. Perhaps the reason he "pulls many of his
punches" in the first half of his book is that he prefers to
limit his conclusions to matters dealing with his own area
of expertise. If so, this would be a refreshing change from
most of the articles and books written on this subject. (I
must confess that I have been unable to find a copy of
Dallin's book and must depend on second-hand accounts
of its contents. I suspect Naureckas does also.)
I fully agree that many legitimate questions remain.
Some answers were no doubt contained in KAL 007's
"black box." Recovery of the wreckage could have
resulted in the examination of the plane's navigational
computer and/or determined if the plane was being guided
instead by a magnetic compass heading (the most credible
explanation). It could also have confirmed or refuted the
presence of "spy equipment."
For more than two months, the United States con
ducted extensive search operations in the most likely
crash locations outside the Soviet Union's 12-mile ter
ritorial limits. The initial air search canvassed 3,000
square miles while surface ships carefully combed more
than 150 square miles. The cost of this search effort,

which involved more than 3,000 flying hours and 320 ship
days, exceeded $22 million.
During the American search efforts, international ob
servers and members of the world press were permitted
on board, and ICAO representatives were on the scene to
take immediate possession of any recovered objects. The
Soviets were invited to send observers as well. They
refused. They also refused repeated American requests to
extend the search into Soviet waters off Sakhalin Island
(the most likely crash site). Instead, they constantly
harassed and interfered with the searchers' efforts. The
downed airliner was never located.
American actions were hardly those of a conspirator.
And, if the Soviets really believed their own propaganda
about an American spy mission, why did they impede
rather than assist the effort to find the wreckage? Could it
be because they had a great deal to lose and nothing to
gain by its recovery?
The ICAO scenario remains the most logical and
plausible, even if it is the least likely to generate books
and movies. The simple (and not unprecedented) failure
to switch the autopilot from its magnetic course setting of
246 degrees would have placed KAL 007 along the track
it followed, as expertly detailed by Murray Sayle in his ar
ticle entitled "KEOO7: A Conspiracy of Circumstance" in
the New York Review of Books, further debunks the con
spiracy theories. Naureckas acknowledges this article's
existence. Perhaps he should read it once again.
While the entire story may never be known, in the face
of evidence to the contrary it appears most logical to
assume that human error put KAL 007 over the Soviet
Union on that fateful night. Soviet defensive paranoia and
their assumption (or at least hope) that they had a spy
plane in their sights prompted them to shoot first and ask
questions later. Given the option of either admitting their
mistake or making false allegations in order to shift the
blame, Moscow chose to respond in typical Soviet fashion.
I agree with Naureckas that history is all too full of ex
amples of American wrongdoing, or at least acts of ex
tremely poor judgment. But this does not mean that
everything our government does is wrong or that every
thing it says is untrue. After all, previous U.S. misdeeds
have most often been revealed by the government itself or
by participants who, occasionally for profit but usually on
moral grounds, chose to tell all. It has been 20 months
since the shooting down of KAL 007. Can he find no sig
nificance in the fact that no intelligence officer, radar
operator or aviation official in the United States, Korea or
Japan has yet to step forward and lend credence to any of
the conspiracy theories? Isn't it possible that the reason
for this is simply because no conspiracy exists?
