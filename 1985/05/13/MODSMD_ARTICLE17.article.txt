Hammer and Coffin
Hoo! I was pleased and gratified to
read that no less of an authority fig
ure than University President Donald
Kennedy is wary of the upcoming
inauguration of my jolly cohorts and
myself, the Hand C.O.P. (The Daily,
May 7). I was further heartened to
read that our pleasantly overwhelm
ing victory is best attributed to "good
old fashioned Stanford whimsy." Oh
— so that was it! And just when
I thought that students
voted for things that they believed
in, too! Silly me. Let it further be
recorded that if, at any time during
our tenure as your presidents, a
"sense of responsibility'' dawns upon
us as the president has suggested, we
be locked into a small room with
Jason Matherly and Noel Hanrahan
for several hours with only copies of
Playboy and The Atlantic to protect
us. I believe that this would remind
us of the error of our ways. Kennedy
wary of our slate — indeed! I've
been wary of Kennedy ever since
that incident at Chappaquiddick all
those years ago. Ha! Probably
thought that we'd forgotten that one,
eh?
Nothing shall soften the Hammer
and Coffin.

The H & C.O.P.
COP wimping out?
An open letter to the Hammer and
Coffin:
I'm way bummed.
I distinctly remember voting for a
radical change in our student bu
reaucracy this spring. I voted for
your slate because you offered this
change.
But last Monday, I picked up The
Daily and read "H & C tempers
plans." The only thing I thought:
"Aw jeez. They're wimping out."
Let me refresh your memory: "We
ran saying we'll disband the Senate
because it was obsolete and non
productive. If we can fundamentally
change the Senate into an efficient
organization, then there's no need to
disband it."
How can you say that with a
straight face when you ran on the
premise that the fundamental change
you offered was to disband the Sen
ate? Per se. Many fundamental
changes have been offered by
various Councils of Presidents in the
past, and all promised some kind of
streamlining effort.
ITS ALL HORSESHIT. This
University does not need a student

government nor does it need a pious
body making resolutions and recom
mendations. As a community all we
need is a service organization, and
for this reason your slate was
elected. Overwhelmingly.
To compound the situation, the
next day's Daily read: "Kennedy
wary of H & C." These are some
heavy negative vibes coming from
Mr. Popular. I sincerely do not
believe, as the good doctor said, that
your election was "some good old
fashioned Stanford whimsy." That is
a condescending statement and not
in tune with the students' thinking.
I'd be pissed off if I were you.
I'm only one vote, but I don't
think I'm by myself with these senti
ments. You promised a real change.
With your election, a lot of expecta
tions have been raised, but you won't
be the first COP to come in with new
ideas only to leave shrouded in
mediocrity. But then again you know
all about resume-packing 'tards.
Or do you?
Please. I'm asking nicely. Ideas
and intentions by themselves lead
nowhere quickly. Execution is every
thing. Change it now.
With utmost sincerity,

Black Greeks
In the article titled "Pledges go 'on
line' in the black Greek system"
(The Daily, May 1), a number of
concepts about black Greek organi
zations were misconstrued. As
leaders of these groups, we would
like to inform the Stanford commu
nity about the purpose, history and
selection processes of these tradi
tionally black Greek organizations.
We hope, then, to clarify these mis
conceptions, as well as establish a
respectful understanding of these
organizations in the eyes of the
Stanford community.
Black Greek organizations were
founded in the early 1900s in order
to provide foundations for fostering
unity, community service, support
and overall achievement at both
black and predominantly white uni
versities. Eighty years later, the eight
traditionally black fraternities and
sororities have grown to include
more than 500,000 members of both
graduate and undergraduate status
worldwide. In fact, some of these
members include leading figures in
our society, such as the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, former congresswoman
Barbara Jordan, Los Angeles Mavor
I om Bradley, novelist Toni Mor-

rison and Supreme Court Justice
Thurgood Marshall.
Here at Stanford, black Greek
organizations have existed since
1978 in accordance with the objec
tives of their national organizations.
Although only recently recognized
by the University, our groups have
undertaken a wide range of activities
within both Stanford and the sur
rounding communities. In terms of
community service, we have col
lectively sponsored voter registration
drives, tutoring programs, canned
food drives and fund raising for
scholarship funds as well as relief in
Ethiopia. Although our service proj
ects address the needs of all people,
our main interest lies within the
black community.
Unfortunately, at Stanford these
positive facets of our organizations
are overlooked. Instead, our most
visible activity, the pledge period, is
singled out and scrutinized. The
activities in which the pledges partic
ipate are standard throughout the
country, emphasizing the unity so
highly valued by our organizations.
These activities include learning
about the ideals and history of the
given organizations, as well as a
heightened interaction between the
pledges and group members. The
process results in producing
knowlcdgable. qualified and. most
important, dedicated members for
the group. With an emphasis on
brotherhood or sisterhood, these
new members are able to share in
and perpetuate the ideals of the
organization. The strong unity
emanating from this process is the
distinguishing characteristic of black
Greek organizations. The challenge
of the pledge program, along with
this oneness, gives members deep
rooted incentive to participate in the
organization on a graduate level.
In short, we look at our organiza
tions as an extension of the diversity
existent on Stanford's campus. In
this light, we should not have to
defend the ideals important to us.
Instead, they should be respected, as
opposed to being ridiculed by mem
bers of the Stanford community. We
welcome any questions pertinent to
our organizations.
