# Bike-locking: a state of mind
## 
### 
I hadn't been in a hike race for a long time. Actu
ally, I had never been in a bike race. And so when I
woke up at the painfully early hour of 7 a.m. three
Saturdays ago. 1 was too excited to be as tired as I
should have been. I had heard about the Stanford
Criterium only a few days earlier, and I had finally
decided to enter the race only the night before it
was to be held. I dug through my closet to find all
my rarely used bike gear. Before long, I had every
thing ready, except for my bike. I went downstairs
to get my bike so I could bring it up to my room to
work on it. No bike.

I stared at the empty space where my bike should
have been for a minute until I finally realized that it
had been stolen. I reacted differently than I
thought 1 would have. I wasn't terribly upset. In
fact. I reacted with an "Oh. well" attitude. It
seemed strange to me that I was taking my mis
fortune so well.
My roommate handled it very well also — he
laughed when I told him my bike had been stolen.
He laughed at me because I had been vehement in
my practice of never locking my bike. I always gave
him a hard time when we went somewhere on our
bikes because he would always lock his bike, even if
we were only going to be gone for a couple of

minutes. He would always reply by telling me that
one day I would be sorry, and every morning I felt a
deep satisfaction when I would find my bike
obediently waiting for me where I had left it the
night before. I had always thought that I left my
bike unlocked so I could feel that satisfaction when
I found it where I had left it. I also felt as though I
was expressing my faith in my fellow man's respect
for private property. My roommate thought these
reasons were ridiculous, as I suspect you do also.
I admit that my reasons for leaving my bike un
locked appear illogical and that these reasons can
be blamed for my present lack of transportation,
but if I had another bike I would do the same thing.
I'm not wealthy, so I'm not adopting this philoso-

In the act of locking up one's bike, one attempts to
alter the world around him. If somebody's bike is
stolen, he should accept that event as an inevitable
consequence of innumerable uncontrollable factors.

phy because I could buy a new bike every time my
bike was stolen. No, I thought about why I felt
good leaving my bike unlocked and why I wasn't
terribly upset when it was stolen. I was able to is
olate some more general reasons to explain my
feelings.
In the act of locking up one's bike, one attempts
to alter the course of the world around him. If
somebody's bike is stolen he should accept that
event as an inevitable consequence of innumerable
uncontrollable factors. It didn't bother me that
somebody stole my bike because I looked at the

event as something that had already happened, and
there was nothing I could do. But still, you say, if I
had locked my bike it wouldn't have happened.
Well, I chose not to lock my bike. I exercised my
will in the same way that others exercise their will
when they decide to lock their bike. I don't view my
decision as any less valid than anybody else's deci
sion. I simply made my decision using different
principles. I chose to de-emphasize the object, my
bike, in favor of my freedom to make a decision
about whether or not I wanted to lock my bike. I
didn't want to lock my bike, so I didn't. It was
stolen. So what?
Obviously, I am not a philosopher — I don't
profess to be. Perhaps my perspective on this situa-

tion of locking bikes is extreme. It is such a small
thing to lock one's bike. But the relative impor
tance of the issue is not critical; what is critical is
being aware of the world around you. Take nothing
for granted. Don't brush apparent simplicities
aside. Ask yourself why you're doing, as often as
you ask yourself to do. When you play a more ac
tive role in your world, you gain more control in it.
Be ready to question. And be ready to discover.
