### 
Former editors of The Stanford Daily viciously bombarded current
staff members last night with fire arms, dangerous foaming chemicals
and liquidizing fluid contained in gelatinous missiles.
The progress of the paper was somewhat hindered by this unwar
ranted violence, as Daily journalists were forced to defend both them
selves and their work against the attack of the embittered veterans ot
Stanford's major daily publication.
The attackers, led by former Editor-in-Chief Tim Grieve, former
Managing Editor Charlie Gofen and former Photography Editor Rod
Searcey, went so far as to sabotage the photography department, the
telephones and the computer typesetting system and to steal the
vehicles of current staff members. One attacker even stole the crutches
of an injured photojournalist, while another nearly blinded a senior
staff writer. Grieve also engaged the current managing editor in a near
fatal bicycle chase.
While climbing on the roof of the building. Grieve was heard saying
gleefully, "Maybe I'll fall through and crush a staffer to death."
Surprisingly, he left the roof intact.
Despite this harassment, Daily staffers were able to produce today's
paper, complete with the latest news and sports.
