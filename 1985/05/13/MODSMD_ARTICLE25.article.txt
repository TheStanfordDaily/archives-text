## Card women capture second 
### ERIK ESELIUS Staff sportswriter 
After a slow start on the first day of
competition, the Stanford women's
track team picked up its intensity and
its performance on the final day to
capture second-place in the Western
Collegiate Athletic Association
Championships last weekend at
UCLA.
As was expected by virtually every
track coach, athlete and fan, the host
Bruins glided to its first championship
in the league's four year existence,
winning by a margin of over forty
points.
Stanford Assistant Coach Dave
Wollman aptly called the meet "the
Jackie Joiner show" and could not
say enough for the Bruin Senior's
"phenomenal" performance.
And well he should be overcome.
Out of UCLA's 148 points, Joiner
ran, leapt and threw for 58 of them.
By the end of the competition. Joiner
had won the long jump, triple jump,
and both the 100 and 400 hurdles.
For good measure, she added a
third-place showing in the high jump,
a fourth in the javelin and a sixth in
the shotput. What energy remained
was used to anchor UCLA's winning
400 meter relay team. Luckily for the
Cardinal and the rest of the teams,
she was at least not at full strength.
"UCLA was Jackie Joiner," Wol
lman said most emphatically. "It was
probably the most outstanding per
formance I have ever seen by a
human being — thank God she's
graduating."
While Joiner was performing at her
own level, the rest of the teams
battled for second place with Stan
ford, Arizona and USC taking the
forefront.
The Cardinal, according to Woll
man, did not show its usually com
petitive spirit on the first day, coming
in a respectable but disappointing
third place.
However, a "heartwarming" pep
talk by Stanford Head Coach Brooks

Johnson, who has a particular
penchant for candidly stating his
point, seemed to change things
around and "set the tone for the
second day," Wollman said.
As has been the case for most of
the Cardinal season, Stanford was led
by its middle distance and distance
people, most notably Seniors Regina
Jacobs and Ellen Lyons, who "ran as
well or better than any other person,"
said Wollman.
Lyons, a distance specialist, came
across first in the 10,000 meters with
a time of 33:45.55, good enough for a
WCAA meet record. Cardinal fresh
man Kathy Smith was a surprise
second.
On the next day, Lyons went on to
rack up second place in the 5,000
meters and a fourth place in the 1,500
meters, which was won by Jacobs.
The school record holder in both
the 800 and the 1,500 meters, Jacobs
recorded an impressive 4:18.64 in the
1,500, eight seconds faster than her
closest competitor.
The 800 meter race, though, did
not go exactly as planned. Entering as
a pre-race favorite and WCAA
record holder, Jacobs came home
fourth. Her record was, in the
process, broken by San Diego State's
Renee Ross.
Junior Alison Wiley, victimized by
a knee injury for the majority of the
season, recuperated well enough to
post a second-place finish in the
3,000 meters and a third-place finish
in the 5,000 meters. Wiley narrowly
missed qualifying for the NCAAs in
the 3,000 meters, an event that she
had won her freshman year.
The Cardinal got a stand-out per
formance out of sophomore Pam
Board in the 400 hurdles — perhaps
"her single best event," according to
Wollman.
Board's time of 58.74 easily bet
tered the NCAA qualifying standard
and gave her fourth for the race.
According to Wollman, the biggest

and most clutch effort for the Card
inal was turned in by junior Denise
Gaztambide. In order to secure an
overall fourth place in the heptath
lelon, Gaztambide needed to finish
within six seconds of Arizona's
Maxine Fry in the her speciality —
the 800 meters.
Gaztambide did just that, knocking

six seconds off her seasonal best and
giving Stanford a more comfortable
lead for second over the steadily per
sistent Wildcats.
Cardinal discus thrower Karen
Nickerson also performed admirably.
Her throw of 176 feet earned her
second place behind San Diego
State's Laura DeSnoo.

Though they ran like the wind, Stanford's women couldn't keep up with
UCLA and failed over the weekend to take their fourth straight tourna
ment title.
