# Bi-Cardinal tops Golden Bear's mixed group
## 
### BUCK MONTANA Staff sportswriter 
There was a little bit of everything Saturday night in Maples
Pavilion, where the Stanford men's and women's tennis teams
hosted California in a non-counting, mixed-match exhibition.
There were women's singles, women's doubles, men's singles,
men's doubles and even mixed doubles. There were aces and
overheads and volleys and winners, too.
But above all, there was fun.
There was Stanford's Eric Rosenfeld blowing the ball out or
bowing to Cal's Don Lione after Lione's second straight ace.
There was the fair-skinned ballboy who lost a dollar bill out of
his pocket on the court and then turned cardinal red when Linda
Gates returned it to him. And there were sisters Stephanie and
Stacy Savides, the former wearing red and the latter blue and
gold, playing against each other in women's doubles.
For the record, Stanford won the match — modeled after the

late World Team Tennis league — by a score of 34-19. Few,
however, seemed to care.
"It was just a fun thing," said Stanford Women's Coach Frank
Brennan. "You hope no one gets hurt and everyone has fun."
No one got hurt and, at last count, all 20 participants from the
four nationally-ranked teams — which begin the NCAA Cham
pionships this week — had fun.
The mixed-match format consists of six one-set matches —
two mixed doubles and one each of men's and women's singles
and doubles. The games, not the sets, are tallied to determine the
winner.
About 2,000 people were in Maples Pavilion, which was
turned into a tennis court thanks to a unique carpet rolled on top
of the basketball floor.
"For an exhibition, that's a pretty good turn-out," said Stan
ford Men's Coach Dick Gould, who noted that Saturday's crowd
was the largest in the past few years for the annual exhibition.

"Other than the NCAAs in Georgia and our annual home
(indoor/outdoor) match against UCLA or USC, this is probably
the biggest collegiate tennis event of the year as far as attendance
is concerned," Gould said.
Of the six matches, Stanford won five, three by a 6-3 margin
and two by 6-2. Only Cardinal senior Linda Gates, who was
making her final home appearance as a collegian, came up short,
as Cal's Heather Ettus won their women's singles set, 6-4.
Stanford's John Letts and Patty Fendick started the evening
off by defeating Cal's Peter Wright and Jennifer Prah, 6 3.
Rosenfeld and Dan Goldie extended the Cardinal's lead to 12-6
with a 6-3 victory over the Bears' Lione and Chris Schoop.
Next up was Gates in women's singles, a match in which there
were four service breaks. Gates appeared to be in control with
the score tied 2-2 in games and a 3-0 lead in the fifth game. But
Ettus ran off four straight points to win that game, then held
serve to take a 4-2 lead.
"1 think she had problems walking that fine line between ex
hibition and competition," Brennan said of Gates, a three-time
All-American. "I think her problem tonight was one of concen
tration."
Ettus' 6-4 victory cut Stanford's lead to 16-12, but Cal's rally
was short-lived. Stanford's Savides and Cari Hagey defeated
Cal's Savides and Julie Grummel, 6-2, in the most convincing
victory of the evening.
"I thought it was really cute to see the Savides sisters out there
battling back and forth," Brennan said, adding that it was the
first time that Stephanie, a sophomore, and Stacy, a senior, had
played against each other in a collegiate match.
Besides winning the set, Stephanie also got the better of the
sibling showdown, as she rocketed an overhead at her sister's feet
in the seventh game.
Perhaps the most impressive performance of the evening was
Derrick Rostango's 6-3 victory over Cal's Steve DeVries in the
fifth set. Rostagno broke DeVries in the sixth game to go up 4-2,
but couldn't hold in the seventh game and was forced to break
again in the eighth game to take a 5-3 lead. Rostagno then put
DeVries away in style, finishing him off with an ace.
"I thought he played really well," Gould said of Rostagno,
who avenged a 6-4 loss to DeVries in last year's exhibition
against Cal. "He served well, and he played aggressively."
Patrick McEnroe and Leigh Anne Eldredge clinched the
match for Stanford with a 6-2 win in the second mixed doubles
match. The pair broke the Bears' serve three times en route to
the victory.
"In general, the whole atmosphere is different than in a nor
mal match," Gould said. "There's no blood and guts in this one."
Neither the men nor the women can afford to stay so carefree
much longer, however. Both squads are preparing for season
climaxing NCAA tournaments. Unlike at Saturday's ex
travaganza, performances at the NCAAs will most assuredly go
down in the books.
The women travel to Oklahoma City, Okla., to defend last
year's national championship, while the men go to Athens, Ga.,
to improve upon their runner-up finish of a year ago.
Both Cardinal squads have completed all regularly scheduled
matches on their respective schedules.
