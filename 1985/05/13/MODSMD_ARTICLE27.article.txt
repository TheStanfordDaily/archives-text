# Baseball delayed

Light, early-morning show
ers were just enough to
force postponement of Stan
fords's Friday afternoon
baseball game at Santa Clara.
The away game was re
scheduled for tomorrow at 3
p.m.
The rain probably prevented
the red-hot Cardinal baseball
squad from deluging the host
Broncos. Indeed, one must
wonder whether heaven's tor
ment wasn't really best for
Santa Clara.
As with any under-dog, the
Broncos must have been buck
ing for an upset. Upon reflec
tion, though, Santa Clara might
have unwittingly run into a
Cardinal buzz saw had the
game been played. Stanford
has of late shown no mercy in
starching its opponents.
After returning from
Arizona State last weekend —
with the Pacific 10 Southern
Division championship firmly
in hand — Stanford has
thrashed any and every would
be challenger.
And what has to delight
Cardinal Coach Mark
Marquess the most is the
sledgehammer style of those
victories. In scoring 12 runs
Wednesday against Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo and 15 more
Thursday, the Cardinal
batsmen would appear to be in
mid-season form.
Stanford's hot bats have
been buttressed by sparkling
pitching. Jeff Ballard blanked
the Mustangs, allowing only
three hits, and freshman Jack
McDowell tossed his second
shut-out of the year, an eight
hitter, at the bewildered
Gators.
