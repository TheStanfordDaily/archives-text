# New York gets prize after NBA lottery
## 
### 
OAKLAND — The Golden State
Warriors finished last once again, and
team owner Franklin Mieuli tried to
hide the hurt with a little humor.
When asked what he thought of
yesterday's National Basketball As
sociation draft lottery, Mieuli winced
and said. "Well, Mrs. Lincoln, what
did you think of the show tonight?''
He admitted. "I'm reaching for op
timism and it's very hard to do."
Coach John Bach said, "Obviously,
we have to put the pieces together,
and there won't be a big chunk like
Patrick Ewing to do it."
Ewing. the three-time All -
American center from Georgetown,
will be negotiating with the New
York knicks. the luckiest of the seven

teams involved in the lottery.
The Warriors, whose 22-60 record
was the worst in the league this
season, finished last in the lottery and
will be up seventh in the June 18
draft.
"We needed immediate help, and
we didn't get it," Bach said, referring
to the starting center job which he
would have gladly handed to Ewing.
"But we will find a way to get a center
who will help us."
The lottery results could have im
proved appreciably the bargaining
power of Joe Barry Carroll, the cen
ter who averaged 20 points a game
over four seasons with the Warriors
and left after becoming a free agent
last year. Golden State made him a

contract offer, but he turned it down
and spent the season in the Italian pro
league.
"We still have his NBA rights,"
Warriors General Manager Al Attics
noted. "We would still like to get his
contract signed."
But whether the Warriors would
then keep Carroll is another matter.
Bach said yesterday, "That's one of
the avenues open, but there are
others to be explored."
There will be "five or six" good
college centers available in the draft.
Bach said. But Ewing. the only sure
thing among the centers, was crossed
off the Warriors' availability list yes
terday.
