## Card crew busts Broncos 
### KEITH SEINFELD 
REDWOOD CITY — The Stan
ford women's crew team pitted their
second string against Santa Clara's
first team in the morning sunshine
Saturday at Redwood Shores.
The Cardinal came up with two
wins in three races, providing an up
beat end to the regular season, and
added confidence going into next
weekend's Pacific Coast Rowing
Championships.
When the Cardinal junior varsity's
eight-person crew posted an easy vic
tory over Santa Clara's varsity eight
in the day's third and final event, a
Stanford triumph was clinched. The
Stanford rowers finished in 6:54, bet
tering the Broncos' time of 7:07.
The Cardinal's four-person team
also coasted past Santa Clara's varsity

four, winning by fifteen seconds in
7:33.
However, Stanford's second novice
eight suffered a surprising loss to the
first novice from Santa Clara. That
upset was to be the Broncos' lone
success on the day, though.
Cardinal Coach John Davis said
the meet "was basically a low-key
warm-up" for the JV's that "should
psyche them up for the Pacific Coast
Championship." He added that he
and assistant coach (and wife) Wendy
Davis were "disappointed that the
second novice had to go out with a
loss because they've worked hard and
we're very proud of the progress they
made this season."
This was the last race of the year
for the second novice, while the JV's
will go on to join the varsity for the
championships.

"We tried out some new things,
and it felt good," Michele Dreyfuss,
who rows in the JV eights, said. " It's
fun to win by that much," Dreyfuss
added.
As for the do-or-die champion
ships near Sacramento this weekend,
Coach Davis said, "Our backs are to
the wall — if we don't do well, we
don't go to the nationals. That's
enough to get them psyched."
Dreyfuss agreed: "We're going to
have to kill ourselves this week, and
even then we figure that to beat (top
ranked) Washington we might need
something new."
Both the women's and men's teams
will row in the Pacific Coast Cham
pionships at Lake Natoma, Califor
nia, May 18 and 19. The rankings will
probably read Washington, Berkeley
and Stanford in all divisions.
