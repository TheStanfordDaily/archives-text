# Board meets today
## 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
The most publicized item for discussion in the Stanford
Board of Trustees' meeting here today and tomorrow
takes up only one line of a 100-page agenda.
The item — added as the final copies of the agenda
were being written up to be sent out to the board's 33
trustees — says simply: "Issues relating to divestiture."
The treatment of the issue of whether the board will ac
cede to the demands of the students who have been sitting
in outside University President Donald Kennedy's office
for almost three weeks indicates that it's very unlikely that
there will be quick action by the trustees.
Kennedy told student protesters May 7 that the chances
are "very, very small" that the board would change its
policy at this meeting.
And Bob Freelen, vice president for public affairs, told
The Daily that, though the board could make some kind
of statement on divestment, "I don't think that they will
take any action."
"It's pretty obvious why, if you've been on the Quad for
two weeks, you'd want them to take some kind of action,
but it's not in the nature of the board to get stampeded,"
Freelen said.
. The protesters are demanding total divestment of the
University's holdings in 97 firms that do business in South
Africa and that members of the Board of Trustees reveal
their personal investment portfolios so students can see if
there is a conflict of interest in any decisions board mem
bers may make on divestment.
Stanford Out of South Africa (SOSA), the student coal
ition that is organizing the protest, issued a press release
yesterday which threatened that the group would
"escalate" its tactics if the trustees do not agree to its
demands. The trustees will hold committee meetings
today and a full board meeting tomorrow.
SOSA said it will move its sit-in from the Quad to the

area outside the Lou Henry Hoover building where trus
tee meetings are held.
A member of SOSA who asked not to be identified told
The Daily last night that 75 percent of the members of
SOSA said at a meeting Thursday night that they would
be willing to take part in civil disobedience if necessary.
SOSA will meet tonight to discuss whether to use civil dis
obedience to pressure the trustees at their meeting tomor
row morning.
The source also said the civil disobedience that was dis
cussed Thursday night involved "obstructing" the trus
tees. The source would not elaborate.
The SOSA press release quoted Steve Phillips, a SOSA
spokesman and chair of the Black Student Union, as
saying that the decision to escalate stems from a general
perception that the University is attempting to defuse the
divestment movement by stalling and failing to directly
address the concerns of the protesters.
Phillips said the protesters would take a "major action"
if the board fails to act on divestment.
Freelen said, however, that members of the board are
"sensitive" to the protesters' concerns. He emphasized
that the trustees, if they are to consider an issue carefully,
must take time to investigate it, pointing out that the
board discussed the issue of whether the University would
accept the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Complex
for five meetings without coming to a final decision.
"The board is very aware of the sit-in," Freelen said.
"Thirteen board members showed up at the forum, and 1
don't know of any occasion, except for a board meeting or
commencement, when so many members have been there
at one time."
SOSA and members of the board held a two-hour
forum May 7 where the protesters and board members
who oppose divestment presented their positions.
Phillips said, however, that he was "insulted" when a
number of trustees left the forum before it was over.
