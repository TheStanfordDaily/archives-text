For the Stanford Cycling Club, a
comment by a rival teammate says it
all.
"Man, we got whaled on," said
Peter Boberg, a rider for UC-Santa
Barbara after the Cardinal turned a
close competition between the two
schools into a blowout at the Western
Regional Intercollegiate Cycling

Championships at Santa Barbara this
weekend.
In winning the weekend's three
race championship 512-433, Stanford
secured the trophy for the team title
for the entire season as-we'l — an im
pressive feat in that Santa Barbara
had taken the last two championships
and five of the last 10.
This weekend's races were the
high-point for the Stanford season.

however. Scoring for collegiate cy
cling is based on a compilation of
point totals from the top five races,
plus the championships, and the
Cardinal led Santa Barbara by only
44 points, 1 189-1145, going into the
championships.
But propelled by consistently
strong performances by members of
the women's team, Stanford stormed
to an insurmountable lead Saturday.
Senior Katrin Tobin won both the 10
kilometer (6.2 mile) time trial and the
road race for Stanford, scoring big
points and beating many of the fastest
men's times in the time trial.
The women's team showed impres
sive teamwork throughout the
weekend, as Peggy McKee, Laura
Rodman and Sarah Carpenter fol
lowed close behind Tobin.
The goal for Stanford on Saturday
was not only to have strong individual
performances, however. In both the
men's and the women's races, the
Cardinal concentrated on denying
points to Santa Barbara.
With this is mind, Stanford riders in
the Expert road race helped two
riders, one from Cal-Poly San Luis
Obispo and the other from UC-San
Diego, to break away from the pack.
Stanford riders Brad Chen and Art
Walker were able to nab third and
fourth places, respectively, in the
sprint.
Chen also won the time trial, and
teammate EricTopp placed 10th.
Stanford outscored Santa Barbara
388-221 on Saturday.
Yesterday, however, at the cham
pionship criterium in front of a par
tisan crowd on the Santa Barbara
campus, Stanford was basically in a
holding pattern as UCSB won 212-
124. The Cardinal ended up winning
the season title 1701-1578.
