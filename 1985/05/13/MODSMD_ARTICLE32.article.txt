# McRann uncorks prodigious toss

### 
Tom Mcßann, Stanford's ultimate
frisbee team coach, has "thrown an
object farther than anyone else has
thrown an object," it has been re
ported.
Friday at 1 p.m., Mcßann let fly his
Skyro-Flying Ring 1,114 feet, or
371.54 yards. With his heave,
Mcßann eclipsed the standing record
previously held by Scott Zimmerman,
also affiliated with Stanford. Zim

merman had chucked an Aero-bie a
mere 1,026 feet. Mcßann has etched
his own little niche in the annals of
sporting records.
The sight of this Herculean ac
complishment was Maloney Field,
just behind the Stanford Stadium.
"There was a heavy cross-wind,"
Mcßann said. That cross-wind,
however, did not seem to hinder the
athlete.
