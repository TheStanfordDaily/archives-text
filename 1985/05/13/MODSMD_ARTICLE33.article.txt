# Atkinson qualifies
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Staff sportswriter 
Cardinal senior Jeff Atkinson
became Stanford's fourth male ath
lete to earn a trip to the NCAAs
when he qualified in the 1,500 meters
this weekend at the Modesto invita
tional.
With stiffer competition and a
faster early pace, Atkinson was able
to record his seasonal personal best ot
3:41.68, more than a full second
faster than NCAA requiring time.
Atkinson, who qualified last year in
the same event, said he entered the
race "well prepared" and was not al
toghether surprised by his time,
stating that it "came fairly easily."
For sophomore Marc Olesen, the
NCAA 1,500 meter standard did not
come as easily â€” in fact it did not
come at all. Olesen's time of 3:43.00
narrowly fell short, likely denying
him a shot at the NCAAs. Olesen
may, however, have a chance to
qualify in a non-scheduled meet.
The final scheduled meet for which
both Atkinson and Olesen will begin
to prepare is the Pac-Ten Champion
ships of May 24 and 25 at Tucson,
Ariz.
According to Atkinson, Steve
Dudmeyer of Oregon and Mike Star
of Arizona State will be obstacles in
the way of his bid for an undefeated
season in the 1,500 meters.
The Cardinal men's team has thus
far qualified a total of four athletes
for the NCAAs. Both hammer
throwers Sean Pickering and Brjan
Masterson had qualified in the mid
season. '/
Freshman high-jumper Brian Mar
shall was the third Cardinal field man
added to the NCAA qualifying list.
