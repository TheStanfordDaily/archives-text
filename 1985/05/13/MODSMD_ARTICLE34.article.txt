## Trustees skirt conflict of interest 
### DANNY PEARL Staff writer 
When Stanford s Board of Trustees meets today
and tomorrow and for the first time discusses total
divestment from companies that do business in
South Africa, the question of possible conflicts of
interest will be a powerful, if unspoken issue.
At least five of Stanford's 33 trustees hold or
have recently held controlling positions in the com
panies under scrutiny, while an unknown number
hold stock in one or more of the companies.
Board members are currently not required to
publicly or privately disclose their personal stock
portfolios.
University President Donald Kennedy implied
that trustees' holdings come under independent
scrutiny when he told students in an April 25
speech, "There is examination of holdings and a
disclosure requirement, but it is not a public dis
closure requirement. The University counsel looks
at those questions and advises board members
about conflicts of interest."
But University Counsel John Schwartz said he
does not in general actively investigate possible
conflicts of interest. He said Board of Trustee
policy requires trustees who think they have con
flicts of interest to abstain from voting, but does not
require trustees to make any disclosures to him or
anyone else.
Schwartz said, "Most of the time, a member of
the board simply announces they are not going to
vote or participate in discussion because of a con
flict of interest." He said trustees don't always
specify their reasons for abstaining.
"We rely on the judgement and integrity of the
trustees to disclose possible conflicts of interest,"
Schwartz said. He said trustees can, if they wish,

seek the advice of the University counsel but added
that none have sought his advice so far.
"In most cases it is clear to the trustee," he said.
Schwartz said trustees "do disclose and abstain a
lot."
Trustees whose high-level positions in companies
might be considered a conflict of interest in a total
divestment vote include William Timken, chairman
of the board of The Timken Co. in Canton, Ohio;
John Grey, president of Chevron Corp. in San
Francisco; Thomas Barrow, who until recently
served as vice chairman of the Standard Oil Co. in
Houston; and John Young, president of Hewlett-
Packard.
None of the trustees with direct links to compan
ies conducting business in South Africa has said
whether he would disqualify himself from a vote on
total divestment.
Six other trustees have said their stock portfolios
probably include companies doing business in
South Africa. The rest of the trustees either could
not be reached, have declined to comment, or are
unsure if they have holdings in the companies in
question.
The University has no written guidelines con
cerning what constitutes conflict of interest.
William Massy, vice president for business and
finance, said trustees are expected to disqualify
themselves from votes which might "materially"
affect them.
But opinions differ on whether a vote for total
divestment would materially affect a company and
its stockholders.
According to Stanford Treasurer Rodney
Adams, "The sale by Stanford of all its stock in a
company would not significantly alter the value of a
stock. That is not a real concern."

But Trustee Michael Ridley, a Los Angeles in
vestment lawyer, said, "Most of the big board
stocks are held largely by institutional investors. If
Stanford decided to divest from Hewlett-Packard,
you don't have to go to business school to see it
would drive down the price of the stock."
William Kimball, president of the Board of Trus
tees, has said voting on divestment would not nec
essarily create a conflict for trustees who own stock
or hold positions in any of the companies in ques
tion. Kimball is president of Kimball and Com
pany, which would be included in a total divest
ment vote.
Walter Geys, a graduate student sitting on the
Board's Committee on Investments, said Kimball's
definition of conflict of interest is too narrow.
"He's saying conflict of interest standards don't ap
ply because total divestment is a general
philosophical procedure, not just an action on one
particular company.
"1 don't think that's the proper way to do it. If
there's a conflict of interest when you're deciding
on part of the stock, why isn't there a conflict of in
terest when you're deciding on the total of it?,"
Geys asked.
Trustees, for the most part, are opposed to dis
closure of their stock holdings. "It's an invading,
personal question, and I don't see that it's rele
vant," Trustee Katharine Hanson said.
Trustee Otis Pease said, "You'd be risking your
money if you bet that the trustees would voluntarily
agree to disclose their holdings."
Schwartz said it wouldn't make sense for trustees
to discuss conflicts of interest before an actual vote
on total divestment. Massy has said such a vote
probably would not be taken before June.
