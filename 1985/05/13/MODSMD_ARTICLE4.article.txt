# SOSA discovers undercover cop at meeting
## 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
Stanford Out of South Africa (SOSA)
members are outraged after finding a
plainclothes police officer in attendance at an
allegedly closed organizational meeting held
Thursday night in El Centro Chicano.
Approximately 100 SOSA members were
present at the meeting, which was held to dis
cuss ways to pressure the Board of Trustees
into voting for divestment at their meeting to
morrow, according to SOSA spokesperson
Steve Phillips.
Brad Hightower, the meeting's facilitator,
said he made an announcement at the outset
of the meeting which "implied that there were
no police to be there." But half an hour into
the meeting, someone recognized plainclothes
officer Mike Riley as an officer who had been
patrolling SOSA events in the Ouad. Follow
ing Riley's identification, participants voted
to have him leave, and he left.
Hightower said he "was surprised" that a
police officer remained after the announce
ment and speculated that Riley stayed
"possibly to undermine the movement."
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington
said Friday that the police understood the
meeting to be a public one. "The officer

wasn't interested in the substance of the
meeting, but in the fact that there were going
to be a large number of people there," Her
rington said.
Herrington said the police routinely moni
tor potentially problematic events in an at
tempt to maintain public safety on campus.
Confusion arose concerning whether the
meeting was a closed assembly, because it was
originally planned to be a public one held in
the Inner Quad. The meeting was moved to
El Centro when organizers said it was too cold
outside.
When the group convened in El Centro,
meeting facilitator Hightower said he asked
any members of the press who were present to
leave. He said he then asked, "Is there
anyone with any links to the administration
here?" and finally, if there were "any CIA or
FBI people."
Hightower then proceeded with the
meeting until Riley was discovered.
"The word police was never used, .. . but
I'm sure he felt a little uneasy, and he should
have come out," Hightower said. "I think he
definitely should have on the implication that
it was a closed meeting."
Herrington said Riley only heard the news
media and "people from the administration"

asked to leave. The officer did not leave be
cause the Stanford police do not consider
themselves part of the administration, Her
rington said.
Herrington defended the presence of his of
ficer at the meeting. SOSA advertised a
public meeting, and "we've monitored every
meeting they've had as far as a public
meeting," he said.
When asked if the Stanford Police Depart
ment had ever had officers at private SOSA
meetings before, Herrington responded in the
negative. "Not to my knowledge," he said.
Herrington said in the future SOSA should
be more explicit about their intentions and
desires. "If they don't want police officers
there, then [they should] say that. . . . We
have no intention of going into any meeting
where we're not welcome."
SOSA members said no confidential issues
were discussed in the presence of the officer
but remained angry about the principles in
volved.
"This demonstrates the University's lack of
commitment to real dialogue and discussion,"
said SOSA member Mike Salman. "A univer
sity cannot claim to uphold civil liberties and

Herrington said that the officer
"was not undercover — he was in
plainclothes. . He knows the
(SOSA) leaders, and they know
him."

Several SOSA members said they
felt betrayed after going out of their
way to conduct a peaceful, lawful
demonstration of their feelings.
The sit-in in the Quad, now in its
2()th day, has resulted in no arrests to
date.
Herrington concurred on the good
behavior of the demonstrators. "It's
been a very law-abiding and peaceful
demonstration, . . . there's been good
discussion, it's a tough issue."
"We've had a pretty good relation
ship with SOSA. I'm sorry there's bad
feeling over this," he added.
