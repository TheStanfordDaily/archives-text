### DAVID RISSER Senior staff writer 
SAN FRANCISCO — Bringing
the message "all power to you" to
students involved in the anti
apartheid movement. South African
Bishop Desmond Tutu addressed
thousands here yesterday at the
Mothers Day Celebration for Justice
held at the Civic Center.
Tutu also commented on his
private meeting Thursday in Los An
geles with Stanford University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy and University
of California President David
Gardner. They were both "very
receptive," he said.
"One . . . left the meeting with
views different from those he started
the meeting with," Tutu said, declin
ing to identify to which person he
referred.
"I suspect both of us did (leave the
meeting with some different views),"
Kennedy said last night. "I don t
know what he meant. I would have
said both.' " Kennedy would not say
whether or not the meeting in
fluenced his opinion of divestment.
The meeting was held "for the pur
pose of discussing issues of common
interest regarding the Republic of
South Africa." according to a state
ment jointly released by Kennedy
and Gardner on Friday. Neither pres

ident will comment further on the
content of last week's meeting.
Both the Stanford Board of Trus
tees and the UC Board of Regents
will discuss divestment this week as
vocal campus pressure mounts in fa
vor of university divestment.
While he said U.S. corporations
"have not used their clout effec

tively," Tutu did not specifically call
for divestment. Any South African
who publicly declares support for
divestment can be arrested for
treason and sentenced to at least 20
years in prison or death under that
country's laws.
Tutu, on a four-day whirlwind tour
of this state sponsored by the Califor
nia Democratic Council (CDC), said
he is speaking "to be able to say
thank you to people . . . especially
students in California and other states
who have shown a wonderful com
mitment to our struggle for justice
and peace."
Tutu said the day's celebration
gave him "a profound sense of being
a part of one family — the human
family."
Those struggling in South Africa
"know they have a cause that will

prevail because of people like you,"
he told the cheering audience. "What
you do matters; what you do counts,"
he added.
"There is no way in which injustice
will prevail against justice. . . . We
are on the winning side, my brothers
and sisters," Tutu said.
The protests in the United States
have been heard in South Africa, ac
cording to Tutu. "The government is
very greatly disturbed," he said.
Tutu likened the political situation
in South Africa to "sitting on a pow
der keg with a very short fuse
indeed." The oppressors there are "in
trouble," he said.
Tutu said elements of the apartheid
system represent "reprehensible, evil
policy very much like Hitler's Aryan
madness."
South Africa is a "country where
men have chosen the biological ir
relevance of color of skin" as the de
termining factor of policy and
privelege, according to Tutu. "What
does the color of my skin tell you of

my value as a human being?" he
asked.
Apartheid "destroys stable com
munities" as "people are uprooted
and dumped literally like garbage,"
he said. "The Reagan administration
has to know it is collaborating with
such a system," he added.
Tutu expressed hope that "black
and white can live amicably together"
in South Africa and said he remains
committed to non-violent means of
abolishing apartheid.
Tutu drew upon themes of religion
and faith several times in his speech.
"Our God takes sides against the op
pressor," he said.
Displaying his sparkling wit on
many occasions, Tutu related the
story of a road sign in Africa that was
changed from "Drive Carefully:
Natives Cross Here" to read "Drive
Carefully: Natives Very Cross Here."
Yesterday's event, coordinated in
large part by Reverend Cecil Wil
liams of San Francisco's Glide
Church, included speeches from

many local religious, union and politi
cal leaders, and Mayor Dianne
Feinstein was on hand to present
Tutu with a key to the city.
"There is no more critical world
issue than ridding the world of what
can be described in one word as fas
cism," said James Herman, president
of the Longshoremen's union.
California Assemblyman Willie
Brown (D-S.F.) urged those in the
Civic Center to donate money to be
split between anti-apartheid organi
zations designated by Tutu and fund
ing for a celebration of the first na
tional observance of Dr. Martin Lut
her King's birthday in 1986.
Lia Belli, past president of the
CDC, reported that $80,000 has been
collected during Tutu's visit to Cali
fornia.
BroWn said he hopes his fellow UC
regents will "understand that politics
and diplomacy must take a back seat
[in this] question of good and evil"
when they consider divestment.
Tutu, who has had his passport

confiscated on two occasions by the
South African government, was care
ful to note that he is in the United
States primarily to attend his
daughter's graduation from the Uni

versity of Kentucky.
Tutu will speak at the Greek
Theatre in Berkeley today at 4 p.m.
after addressing a joint session of the
State Legislature this morning.
