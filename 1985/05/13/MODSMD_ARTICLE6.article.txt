# First round Draw shows its cards
## The 						French House and Terra fill; Synergy may fold 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Staff writer 
The French House and the co-op Terra filled
in round one of the Undergraduate Housing
Draw, but Synergy — with only 33 out of 44
spaces filled — faces the prospect of losing its co
operative living arrangement, according to
Rodger Whitney, assistant dean of Student Af
fairs and director of the Housing Center.
Of the 11 vacancies left in Synergy, 10 must be
filled by males, Whitney said. Considering that
Synergy had only 15 male spaces to fill, 10 male
vacancies is a lot, he said.
Last year, Synergy had approximately the
same number of vacancies after round one.
About 74 percent — 3,100 out of the 4,175
students who entered the Draw this year — were
assigned housing, according to Whitney.
The computer program that tabulated Draw
results took about three minutes per sex to run.
Whitney said. Housing assignments are done sep
arately for men and women.
Round one assignments extended to 2,949 in
the men's pool and 4,046 in the women's pool,
according to Whitney. All but approximately 20
men with guaranteed housing were assigned to a
residence and all guaranteed women — plus
about 230 unguaranteed women — were as
signed housing, Whitney said. These results are
very close to last year's, he said.
According to a plan formulated this year by
Residential Education, Synergy must fill 90 per
cent of its spaces by the end of round two or it
will be turned into a self-operated or University

operated house. Whitney said. Terra and the
French House are also under these regulations
but having already filled their spaces, they are
not in danger of becoming self-ops or U-ops next
year.
Columbae, with one female and six male
vacancies, and Haus Mitteleuropa, with five
male vacancies, also failed to fill at the end of
round one, Whitney said. While Haus Mitt will
definitely fill. Synergy and Columbae may not, he
said.
Storey House was the most popular residence
this year with a cutoff number of 118 for men
with level two priorities and 281 for women with
level two priorities, according to Whitney. A
level two priority is higher than a level three
priority, while a returning residence priority is
the highest of all. Not all houses have the level
three priority.
Some of the other cutoff numbers are:
• 558 Mayfield — Men: 320, Women: 315;
• Yost — Men: 524. Women: 428;
• Alpha Sig — Men: 427, Women: 1,754, both
for level 3;
• Lambda Nu — Men: 679, Women: 826, both
for level 2;
• Toyon — Men: 622, Women: 696, both for
level 2;
• Roble— Men: 928. Women: 1,2.25;
• Four-person Suites — Men: 1,799, Women:
789, both for level 2;
• Six-person Suites — Men: 2,772, Women:
3,309, both for level 2;
• 353 Campus — Men: 954, Women: 1.008,

both tor level 2;
• American Studies — Men: 1,251, Women:
2,422, both for level 2;
• Eucalypto (Lagunita) — Men: 1.472, Women:
1,565;
• Terra — Men: 2,857, Women: 3,001, both for
level 2;
• French — Men: 2,479, Women: 3,048, both for
level 2;
• Twain (Stern) — Men: 2425, Women: 2916;
• Mirlo (Florence Moore) — Men: 2368.
Women: 3727;
• Cedro (Wilbur) — Men: 2656, Women: 3000.
The 4-pcrson suites for men, which filled com
pletely last year with returning residents, had ab
solutely no returning resident groups this year,
according to Whitney. Two reasons are behind
this result. Whitney said. First, a guaranteed year
will naturally be followed by an unguaranteed
year since everyone who returned from last year
to this year had no more guaranteed years of
housing; second, Residential Education's new
policy this year forbade 6-person Suite residents
to use returning residence priorities for 4-pcrson
suites.
Some unguaranteed women were assigned to
the 6-person Suites, which had a cutoff number
above 3,000. Unguaranteed students drew from
3.001 to 5,000.
Whitney called it "a dream Draw, very
smooth, well-functioning." Residential Educa
tion will post cutoff numbers and lists of housing
assignments today, according to Whitnev.
