Three bombs explode in Jerusalem
JERUSALEM — Three bombs exploded in and around Jerusalem
and a fourth was defused yesterday near the hotel where Secretary of
State George Shultz had spent the night. There were no injuries.
Israel's Army Radio quoted unidentified police sources as saying the
bombs were planted by a guerrilla squad to demonstrate its opposition to
dialogue between Palestinians and Israel.
Shultz's four-day visit to the region was to encourage efforts to set up
a Palestinian delegation to join Jordanians in talks with Israel.
The defused bomb was discovered by a passerby 100 yards from the
King David Hotel where Shultz stayed during his visit in Israel. When
the bomb was found, Shultz was a half-mile away, giving Prime Minister
Shimon Peres a final briefing before flying to Jordan.
Palestine Liberation Organization factions loyal to PLO leader Yasser
Arafat and those opposed to him both claimed responsibility for the
three bombs which exploded, but neither group mentioned the defused
bomb.
Indian police nab bombing suspects
NEW DELHI, India — Police captured three suspected Sikh terror
ists during a shootout yesterday and said the arrests were a major
breakthrough in the investigation of booby-trap bombings that have
killed at least 85 people.
Authorities said more than 1,000 Sikh suspects have been arrested in
connection with the wave of explosions that began across northern India
on Friday. Another 1,000 Sikh militants and anti-social elements were
detained as a protective measure, the officials said.
Ved Marwah, New Delhi's top police official, said his force obtained
vital clues about the people who masterminded the bombings with the
arrest of "three dreaded terrorists" during a shootout in the capital.
In western India, meanwhile, a new round of Hindu-Moslem violence
killed 12 people in Ahmedabad, India's fifth largest city and the main
city in Gujarat state. The violence, which left 54 people wounded,
prompted authorities to order an indefinite curfew and to again call out
Indian army troops there.
The deaths raised to 113 the official toll in violence in Gujarat since
March. The unrest stemmed from a controversial state government plan
to increase quotas for lower castes in colleges and government employ
ment.
No end in sight for Beirut shelling
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Druse leader Walid Jumblatt ruled out any
chance of a settlement with armed Christian rivals yesterday, the 15th
day of shelling and sectarian skirmishing between militias in Beirut.
Police said one civilian was killed and 11 were wounded in night fight
ing between irregulars along the three-mile demarcation line that splits
Christian east Beirut from the capital's mostly Moslem west.
The toll now stands at 87 killed and 459 wounded since fighting broke
out on April 28 along the Green Line.
Militiamen battled with automatic weapons and rocket-propelled
grenades. Mortar rounds hit residential areas on both sides of the line.
In the Aley mountains overlooking Beirut, Christian Lebanese army
troops were in action against Jumblatt's Druse militiamen, now allied
with Moslem forces.
There were no reports of casualties in the sporadic clashes.
Soccer stadium called 'firetrap'
BRADFORD, England — A fire chief said yesterday that the old
wooden soccer grandstand that was destroyed by a weekend flash fire,
killing 52 people and injuring 211, had been identified as a "firetrap" six
months earlier.
The inferno Saturday at the Bradford City Soccer Club's Valley
Parade stadium, was England's worst soccer disaster.
West yorkshire Fire Chief Graham Karren said the club was warned
six months ago that its 79-year-old grandstand was a fire risk. But Kar
ren said he was powerless under existing law to insist on improvements.
Investigators combed through the grandstand's ashes with their fin
gers yesterday, looking for clues to what started the fire.
A police official said it did not seem to be the result of "a deliberate
criminal act."
On a day when civic celebrations had been planned to honor the
championship Bradford City soccer club, flags flew at half staff in this
city of 300,000 people, mourning what Sports Minister Neil Macfarlane
called "the worst tragedy we have ever seen in English football
(soccer)."
The Anglican Bishop of Bradford, the Rt. Rev. Robert Williamson,
held a special prayer service yesterday afternoon. About 1,000 people
packed Bradford Cathedral, some with bandages on their heads and
hands, and many wearing the maroon and yellow scarf of the Bradford
City club.
Ihe fireball that took only four minutes to engulf the wooden
grandstand on Saturday prompted immediate calls for improved safety
measures at aging sports stadiums throughout the country.
Football Association Chairman Bert Millichip said the disaster would
almost certainly result in fire authorities closing the stands of several of
the 92 Football League clubs.
Nearly 20 hours alter wind-fed flames turned the grandstand into an
inferno. West Yorkshire Police Chief Colin Sampson announced:
"There are 52 fatalities in this dreadful event."
He told a news conference 72 of the 211 people injured were still
hospitalized yesterday, including three of the 23 police hurt trying to
help people out of the rapidly spreading flames. Two people were re
ported in critical condition, and five others were described as "poorly."
Dutch protesters threaten pope
UT RF,( HI, Netherlands — Hundreds of anti-establishment youths,
chanting We want to kill the pope,' battled police yesterday near a
conference hall where Pope John Paul II heard liberal Dutch Catholics
challenge church doctrine.
About 1,000 youths marched to within several hundred yards of the
Jaarbeurs industrial conference ccnter where John Paul, on the second
day of his visit to the Netherlands, was meeting Dutch Catholic clergy
and lay people.
When riot police blocked the way, some youths began throwing rocks.
Helmeted officers responded with tear gas and baton charges in a half
hour melee, driving the young people back toward the center of Utrecht,
a university city in central Holland and the seat of the Dutch Roman
Catholic church.
In two separate incidents, officers surrounded by demonstrators fired
pistol shots. Police Chief Jan Wiarda said. None of the shots was
believed to have hit anyone.
Wiarda said 14 people had been arrested in the rioting. Three
policemen and one demonstrator were injured. All were treated and
released.
The police chief said a bystander, not involved in the rioting, died of a
heart attack. He was not identified.
I he pitched battles followed a peaceful march by about 10,000 Dutch
radicals, feminists and homosexuals opposing John Paul's visit, the first
ever by a pope to the predominantly Protestant Netherlands.
John Paul s 1 1-day tour, which includes Belgium and Luxembourg,
put him at the center of a dispute between the Dutch church s strong
liberal wing and a conservative hierarchy that progressives say has been
imposed by the Vatican.
Liberals favor looser rules on birth control, premarital sex, divorce
and homosexuality and want the church to allow priests to marry,
women to be ordained and laymen to celebrate Mass.
Thousands of the Netherlands' 5.6 million Catholics — about 40 per
cent of the population — have rallied along the pope's motorcade route
to express support, but their numbers have fallen short of the totals
predicted by organizers.
