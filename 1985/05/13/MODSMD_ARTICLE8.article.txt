# No breakthroughs achieved
## Shultz meets with Hussein 
### 
AQABA, Jordan â€” Secretary of State George
Shultz met last night with King Hussein on a royal
yacht in the Red Sea, but no breakthrough was
achieved in arranging Arab-Israeli peace talks, a
senior U.S. official said.
The official, speaking on condition he not be
identified, added: "We didn't come here expecting
a breakthough. I don't think there's any big event
shaping up in the final hours" of the secretary's
three-day Middle East tour.
Shultz flew to Aqaba from Cairo, where he con
ferred for more than two hours with Egyptian Presi
dent Hosni Mubarak. He went to Cairo after
meetings in Jerusalem with Prime Minister Shimon
Peres and other Israeli leaders.
Hussein and Shultz will meet again this
morning and the secretary then flies to Vienna,
Austria, where he will confer with Soviet officials
on the U.S.-Soviet arms reduction talks.
Shultz said earlier yesterday that it was "a hard
problem" to find Palestinian peace negotiators ac
ceptable to both Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organization. He said a solution is essential,
however, if peace talks ever are to get under way
between Israel and a joint Jordanian-Palestinian
delegation.
Shultz's two-hour meeting with Hussein ap
parently failed to advance efforts to reach agree
ment on the Palestinian representation.
"You're dealing with very serious men looking

hard at highly complex issues," the U.S. official
said.
He said Shultz has decided to have Richard
Murphy, the State Department's top diplomat for
the Middle East, remain in the region for further
talks with Israel and Egypt.
Murphy, who has held "get-aquainted sessions"
with some Palestinians, also is prepared to take fur
ther soundings, the offical said.
Summing up the frustrations Shultz has faced on
his Middle East swing, the official said, "There's no
breakthrough in sight or sought."
Reporters traveling with Shultz asked him if
there were Palestinians acceptable to both Israel
and the PLO and he replied, "I don't know the an
swer to that question. That's one of the things I
don't know. It's a hard problem."
He added that the problem "is to find people
who are truly recognized as people who represent
the Palestinians and who also have a background
that would be acceptable in the negotiating
process."
In Israel, officials were divided on whether mem
bers of the Palestine National Council, which sets
policy for the PLO, might qualify. Opponents cited
the council's role in adopting the covenant that
calls for the extinction of Israel.
Yesterday, Peres appeared to soften Israel's line
when he told his Cabinet that Israel would rule out
negotiations only with Palestinians who are dedi

cated to the destruction of Israel.
"Israel is prepared to conduct direct negotiations
with a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation which
will not include persons belonging to an organiza
tion that is committed to the Palestinian covenant,"
which calls for Israel's destruction. Cabinet Secre
tary Yossi Beilin quoted Peres as saying.
"We will not deal with those who are committed
to destroying Israel," Beilin told reporters in
Jerusalem.
He said the government believed "there are Pal
estinian leaders in the (Israeli-occupied) West
Bank and Gaza and maybe elsewhere who are not
committed to the Palestinian covenant and are
eager to participate," in peace talks.
On his second stop, Shultz praised Egypt's "real
determination to work at the problems and keep
the level of frustration down and the level of effort
up. That is the most welcome sign, and I appreciate
it."
In Jordan, he was prepared to tell Hussein that a
U.S. arms package is nearly ready for submission to
Congress. "We want to be helpful to King Hussein
in ways that we can," Shultz said.
But in Peking, where Yasser Arafat held three
days of talks with Chinese leaders, the PLO chair
man said he and Hussein had agreed that "any
delegation of any purpose or any mission has to be
from the Jordan government and the PLO di
rectly."
