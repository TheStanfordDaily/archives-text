# CIA linked to Beirut bombing

### 
WASHINGTON — The Reagan
administration is remaining silent, but
the vice chairman of the Senate Intel
ligence Committee says he wants
more information about reports that
the CIA organized an anti-terrorist
group that was responsible for an un
authorized bombing which killed 80
people in Beirut.
"I've already started a series of in
quiries." Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.)
said last night after details of the op
eration were disclosed by The Wash
ington Post. He said he would raise
the issue as early as today at the
opening of Senate hearings on ter
rorism.
"If the story is accurate, it would be
all the more reason to find out why
we don't have better plans for com
bating terrorism," Leahy said.
Leahy declined to discuss the
details cited in the Post story, saying
"that's something the administration
is going to have to comment on."
The White House, CIA and State
Department refused to discuss the
substance of the story, which was
based on information from uniden
tified sources.
The newspaper said President

Reagan late last year gave his support
to the anti-terrorist plan, which was
pushed by Secretary of State George
Shultz and National Security Adviser
Robert McFarlane.
The plan was designed to stage pre
emptive strikes — including killing
suspected terrorists, if necessary — to
head off further terrorist attacks on
U.S. facilities in the Middle East, the
Post said.
Members of one of the counterter
rorist groups, acting without CIA au
thorization, hired others in Lebanon
to detonate the car bomb outside a
Beirut apartment building March 8,
the newspaper said,
Leahy, who said he "found out
about it on my own" last month,
wasn't vice chairman of the intelli
gence ommittee at the time the oper
ation was planned. The post was then
held by Sen. Daniel Moynihan (D-
N.Y.), who told The New York Times
he was informed late last year that
Reagan had ordered the CIA to
develop "a small anti-terrorist effort"
in the Middle East.
Eighty people died and 200 were
injured in the March 8 blast.
