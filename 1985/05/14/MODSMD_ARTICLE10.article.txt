MX cost rising
WASHINGTON — The Air Force, blaming
budget cuts made by Congress, has revised the
cost of each MX intercontinental ballistic missile
upward by 50 percent, Defense Week said in
today's editions.
The magazine said the Air Force notified con
gressional leaders last week that the estimated
cost of producing each MX in fiscal 1985 would
rise from $79.3 million to $119 million.
Defense Week said the notification came in
letters sent by acting Air Force Secretary E.C.
Aldridge to House Speaker Thomas "Tip"
O'Neill (D-Mass.) and Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-
Ariz.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee.
Federal law requires such notification
whenever a Defense Department procurement
cost estimate rises by more than 15 percent.
Aldridge said he raised the MX estimate on
April 5 "solely because Congress voted to

procure 21 missiles in fiscal year 1985 instead of
the budgeted quantity of 40," the magazine said.
Defense Week quoted an unidentified Air
Force spokesman as saying that "the difference
in cost is the result of losing the benefits of
economies of scale."
The magazine said the Air Force also has in
creased by 12.3 percent the estimated pricc tag
for each MX built in fiscal 1986, which begins
next Oct. 1.
Dotson seeks new trial
CHICAGO — Gary Dotson, granted freedom
but not vindication, returns to court today for a
hearing on his petition for a new trial in his fight
to clear his name.
"The motion for a new trial is not moot as long
as something hangs over his head," Chief Crimi
nal Court Judge Richard Fitzgerald said Sunday.
Cathleen Crowell Webb, who accused Dotson
of a July 9, 1977, rape, came forward in March

and said she had fabricated the tale to cover a
teen-age sexual indiscretion she feared had left
her pregnant.
Dotson, 28, of suburban Country Club Hills,
served six years in prison after his 1979 convic
tion on charges of rape and aggravated kidnap
ping. He would have been eligible for parole in
1988.
