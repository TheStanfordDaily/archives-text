SAN DIEGO — A city council committee,
rejecting the advice of city staff, yesterday en
dorsed the withdrawal of city investments in
companies doing business in South Africa.
The rules committee, in a unanimous vote,
called for the city's retirement board to sever all
ties between the employees pension fund and
American companies with links to South Africa
in protest of that country's racial segregationist
policies.
The city manager also was asked to draft a
resolution reflecting the committee's recommen
dation so the issue can be brought before the full
council for a vote on June 10.

In its recommendation, the rules committee
recommended that the City Employees Retire
ment Board System withdraw within one year in
vestments in a half dozen companies that operate
in South Africa.
The board now maintains about $38 million, or
about 8 percent of its portfolio, in stock in the six
companies.
Board President Jerald Lewis said he expects
the board to follow the recommendation of the
full council, provided there arc guarantees that
the board would not be liable for any financial
losses stemming from divestiture.
Staff reports from the retirement board and
city treasurer's office concluded that divestment
would cost the citv at least $570,000 the first year

and $380,000 a year after that and would he of
questionable help to blacks in South Africa.
But the four members of the committee dis
regarded the staff recommendation, agreeing
that the city should avoid any support of what
Councilman William Jones described as "the
most unjust system in the world in modern
times."
Today's weather
Mostly sunny today with the highs near 80.
Northwest winds 10 to 20 mph. Fair tonight.
Lows in the 40s to low 50s. Sunny and warmer
tomorrow. Highs in the upper 80's.
