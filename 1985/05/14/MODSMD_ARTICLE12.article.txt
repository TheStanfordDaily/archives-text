## Snacking on caterpillars is just no treat 
### 
T>ear Bug Me,
Here s one that's right up your path.
It concerns the caterpillars that are
dropping on us these days. I had
assumed them to be harmless, al
though übiquitous. However, a friend
told me that he broke out in bumps
and was bedridden "near to death
lor two days after one of these furry
fiends brushed against his bare chest.
He then cryptically remarked, "Nature
didn't give it hair and bright colors for
nothing.' What gives? - On The Farm
Or In ['he Jungle.
1 wouldn't compare the campus to
the jungle. After all, this isn't the
meat-packing industry. But it is a bit
like Alice's Wonderland, if you want
to get literary about it. The only
problem is that the caterpillers here
aren't smoking from hookahs and
doling out size-altering 'shrooms.
The tussock moth caterpillar —
already criticized, if not eulogized, in
another Daily column — does give off
a type of organic acid or other, more
caustic substances which may have
caused your friend's problem, accord
ing to Prof. Ward Watt, a specialist in
evolutionary genetics.
Watt said the critters produce an ir
ritating substance for defense and
carry it around on their razor stubble
— where it won't bother them and
will bother birds who get the
munchies.
Of course, the fact that some spar
row gets a bellyache doesn't help the
bisected caterpillar much, except that
after several rounds of evolution,
birds learn not to mistake tussock
moths for Doritos.
The problem with hyper-evolved
humans of the kind that attend Stan
ford is that we don't have useful trivia
like that in our collective uncon
scious. Instead, we know what level
of sunscreen to put on the nose, as
compared to the knee, in order to
avoid skin cancer, or what deduction
to claim on the 1040 form.
It's still a matter of risk avoidance.
The University has sprayed for the
oak tree infestations, but the sprayers
have to be careful to avoid killing off

the Biology Department's experi
mental critters, or getting insecticide
into the forced-air circulation systems
of many campus buildings, according
to Watt.
He said that infestations come and
go every few years and are relatively
harmless because the fuzzy little
croutons don't kill the trees they feed
on. "They won't eat your wallet or
your ASSU notes if they get in a
dorm room," Watt said.
Why do fuzzy green caterpillars
hang from trees? Haven't they learned
that they're safer in the trees? -
Amateur Entomologist
I think that we can infer from the
last question that people would also
be safer if the caterpillars stayed in
the trees. I know it would at least
make eating dinner outside on those
lazy spring evenings a lot more relax
ing if I didn't have to keep inspecting
the garnishes on my salad.
I tried asking one why they insist
on ooching themselves out onto
sidewalks and in front of bike tires —
whether it was some undeniable in
stinctual drive to lope across my fork
tines at speeds just over zero miles an
hour — but it was more interested in
shadow boxing with my big toe. 1
resisted the urge to give it a knock
out, but I didn't get you an answer,
either.
Actually, if you think about it,
there is an appealing challenge to
biking down White Walk — or
whatever the thoroughfare by the
Quad is called — dodging the hanging
menace as well as the pedestrian
[plague.
1 can just see the video game now:
Caterpillar Crunch, a new release
from Hasbro, just in time for the June
Christmas buying rush. Your child
will have hours of fun guiding his ve
hicle through swarms of parachuting
parasites, trying to make it to his 9
a.m. class without becoming a landing
pad for the terrible tussock.
While on a jaunt into the far reaches
of Eastern Paraguay some years ago, I
met a fellow who asked me a question

that he thought only a student associ
ated with a major American university
could answer. The question was,
"How much does the earth weigh?" I
told him, "A whole lot." He was
satisfied with the answer I gave, but /
suspect he was just being polite.
Would you help out with this? I
haven't been able to sleep since then. -
Thorn Whigham
While your answer is undoubtedly
true, Thom, it is correct to say that
the earth is estimated to weigh 5.976
x 1 0 24 pounds, according to the
Cambridge Encyclopedia of
Astronomy.
I don't know how much of that is
Eastern Paraguay, but I don't think
vou should worrv about it too much;

you've already gone without sleep for
"some years" over this problem.
I thought it would be really difficult
to get a figure for something like that,
too, but when I called Meyer Library,
David Swadell, the reference libra
rian who answered the phone, said,
"Oh gosh, I used to know that!" Then
he went off for about two minutes
and came back with the statistic I
gave you.
/ have been wondering: Just what is
the Food Research Institute over in
Encina? What do they do to food? Are
they involved with University Food
Service? Was eggplant stack-up
created there, and was this institute re

sponsible for tofu? I like food. Is there
anything for me at the Food Research
Institute? Can I eat there for free? -
Gary Christensen
Let's get it straight before any
anonymous fire bombing incidents
occur down by Encina: The Food Re
search Institute is in no way affiliated
with University Food Service or its
eggplant wonders, and it has no poli
tical leanings toward this group.
The institute is really a department
in the School of Humanities and
Sciences that gives master's and doc
torate degrees in something that
really should be called applied eco
nomics, according to Prof. Walter
Falcon, the director of the program.
His field covers issues like world

food supply, the commodities market,
demography, public health and nutri
tion and economic development of
countries.
There are 14 faculty members and
50 graduate students, a third of whom
are from Third World countries. It
was founded and named in 192 1, and
the difficulties about its function
started just a little bit after that.
"We'd have many fewer confusions
if we were called something else,"
Falcon admitted. So far, he hasn't
been swarmed with heartburn cases
demanding new technology in ar
tichokes or mandates against meat
loaf. You may be the first.
