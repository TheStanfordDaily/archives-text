## THE 						STANFORD DAILY SOSA and the police 
### 
Police and protesters do not always have the
best of relations.
At Harvard, anti-apartheid demonstrators
have accused the police of bugging their phones.
At UC-Berkeley, the police have accused some
divestment protesters of trying to incite violence
by grabbing for the guns of police officers.
Until a Thursday night meeting of Stanford
Out of South Africa (SOSA) though, relations
between the police and protesters at Stanford
had been relatively cordial. At that meeting,
SOSA members became incensed after discover
ing a plainclothes police officer in the midst of
what they understood to be a private meeting.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington sent
an officer to a public SOSA meeting scheduled
for the Inner Quad. After the meeting was moved
to El Centro Chicano, SOSA made announce
ments which "implied" that the meeting was
closed to the police, but Herrington said Officer
Mike Riley did not understand that implication.
Brad Hightower, the meetings facilitator, said
the press, all members of the University adminis

tration, and representatives from the CIA or FBI
should leave. He did not say police should leave.
Herrington said Riley did not identify himself
because the Stanford police are deputized by the
Santa Clara County Police Department and do
not consider themselves part of the University
administration. In addition, Herrington said
Riley did not hear the reference to the CIA and
FBI.
This conflict between protesters and the police
was not necessary: SOSA representatives say
they have a right to private meetings, and Her
rington says the police will not attend any
meeting where they are "not welcome.*"
It seems clear, then, that what happened
Thursday was a breakdown in communication.
Police should not attend private SOSA meetings
where they are not wanted, and SOSA should
make it clear exactly when police are and are not
welcome. Anything less is a bad-faith violation of
the atmosphere of respect and trust that has been
cultivated between the police and SOSA.
