# Holocaust continues behind Iron Curtain
## 
### 
The controversy which surrounded President
Reagan's recent trip to West Germany reveals that
for many, still, after 40 years, the psychic scars of
World War II and the Nazi Holocaust have not
faded.
By laying a wreath at the Bitburg cemetery, con
taining among the 2,000 German war dead the
bodies of 49 members of Hitler's Waffen-SS,
Reagan appeared to honor both the victim and the
villain of the Nazi terror and to paper over German
complicity in the name of reconciliation among
former enemies now allied in the defense of
Europe.
For the few survivors of the Holocaust, and for
many who share their suffering, life is a constant
vigil. The crimes perpetrated at Bergen-Belsen,
Buchenwald, Auschwitz, among other places, are
unimaginable. Many, such as Elie Wiesel, believe
that if humankind is to guarantee that "never
again" will the Holocaust be repeated, the memory
of it must never fade.
Thus, May 8, 1945, is fixed in memory as much
to celebrate the Allied liberation of Europe as it is
to commemorate and to mourn more than 6 million
Jews who died under Nazi tyranny.
May 8, 1945, bears a second legacy which is of
ten forgotten in our occupation with renewing the
memory of the Holocaust. Largely forgotten
among the VE-Day commemorations is the en
suing peace. For much of Eastern Europe, the war
never ended, and Soviet tyranny merely replaced
German tyranny.
It is tragically ironic that while we zealously con
demn the Nazi Holocaust, we overlook its existence
in another form. The Holocaust continues every
day for those left behind the Iron Curtain.
Freedoms of religion, speech, opportunity and
freedom from fear and want are largely unknown
to people under Soviet domination. In Romania,
churches are destroyed. In Poland, Catholic priests
are harassed. In Czechoslovakia, people must line
up at 3 a.m. to purchase basic food goods. Dissent
is brutally repressed in East Germany. In the Soviet
Union, dissidents regularly are imprisoned or
exhiled to Eastern Siberia, or are "committed" to
psychiatric prisons, or simply disappear. Three
million dissidents are currently held in Soviet pris
ons.
Although not since Stalin have Jews been perse
cuted systematically, recently there has been an
alarming upsurge in officially sanctioned anti-
Semitic propaganda and restrictions of Jewish na

tional and cultural activity.
Religious practices are restricted. Hebrew can be
taught only by Russian Orthodox priests and by
government "Jewish experts." Prominent Hebrew
teachers have been routinely arrested and im
prisoned on fraudulent charges. These include:
• Yosef Begun. Arrested in 1982 for anti-Soviet
agitation. Sentenced to seven years of hard labor
and five years of internal exhile.
• Alexander Kholmiansky. Arrested in 1984 for
"aggravated hooliganism." Sentenced to 18 months
of hard labor.

For much of Eastern
Europe, Soviet tyranny
merely replaced
German tyranny.

Others, such as human rights activists Anatoly
Shcharansky and Yuri Litvin languish and die in
prison, forgotten by all but a few.
American Jewish groups and Western leaders
alike were outraged to hear that during Soviet ob
servances of VE-Day held at Buchenwald, no men
tion was made of Jewish suffering during the war.
Such disregard for the 6 million victims of the Nazi
Holocaust may not surprise those who recall that
Stalin's own holocaust — Jews, Ukranians, Russian
kulaks, Lithuanians, murdered to "make way for the
revolution" — claimed more than 30 million lives.
In fact, Soviet officials took the opportunity to con
demn Jewish nationalism as the new Zionism.
In 1979, 50,000 Jews were allowed to emigrate

from the Soviet Union, largely due to American
pressure, trade concessions and cash payments.
Since then, more than over 350,000 Jews have
completed applications for emigration. In 1984,
only 896 Jews were allowed to leave.
Demands of "Never again!" are pitifully useless
to stop the institutionalized persecution of those
left behind the Iron Curtain. If we are serious in
preventing tyranny, we must open our eyes to the
tyranny which exists around us.
Soviet crimes should no longer go unreported,
nor should our outrage be muzzled by the fear of
damaged Soviet relations. Names such as
Birobidzhan, the "Jewish Homeland" in Eastern
Siberia where many Jewish dissidents are exhiled,
Kolyma, the notorious mining camp where
thousands died digging gold for Stalin, and Chris
topol Prison should replace Auschwitz, Dachau
and Bergen-Belsen as symbols of the new tyranny
which threatens not just Jews but all people.
May 8, 1945, should commemorate not only
Allied victory, but also Allied indifference, ap
peasement and isolationism of a decade earlier
which allowed a criminal such as Hitler to consoli
date power. We must also bear some guilt for those
who suffered under tyranny. Had the Western na
tions opposed Hitler earlier, the sacrifices of World
War II and the ensuing bitter peace might have
been avoided.
As Thomas Jefferson said, "Those who expect to
reap the blessing of freedom . . . must undergo the
fatigues of supporting it." America's freedom is
closely tied to that of a community of free nations.
As the leader of the free world, America must ful
fill her moral responsibility to stand by all those in
the world who are threatened by tyranny. We must
be willing to make the promise which President
Reagan made at Bitburg: "Today, freedom loving
people around the world must say, 'I am a Berliner.
I am a Jew in a world still threatened by anti-
Semitism. I am an Afghan and I am a prisoner of
the Gulag. I am a refugee in a crowded boat foun
dering off the coast of Vietnam. I am a Laotian, a
Cuban and a Miskito indian in Nicaragua. I too am
a potential victim of totalitarianism.' "
Only by recognizing totalitarianism as the
tyranny which threatens peace in the world, and
only by feeling the suffering of all who fall under its
yoke* can we begin to say with confidence, "Never
again!"

ten forgotten in our occupation with renewing the
memory of the Holocaust. Largely forgotten
among the VE-Day commemorations is the en
suing peace. For much of Eastern Europe, the war
never ended, and Soviet tyranny merely replaced
German tyranny.
It is tragically ironic that while we zealously con
demn the Nazi Holocaust, we overlook its existence
in another form. The Holocaust continues every
day for those left behind the Iron Curtain.
Freedoms of religion, speech, opportunity and
freedom from fear and want are largely unknown
to people under Soviet domination. In Romania,
churches are destroyed. In Poland, Catholic priests
are harassed. In Czechoslovakia, people must line
up at 3 a.m. to purchase basic food goods. Dissent
is brutally repressed in East Germany. In the Soviet
Union, dissidents regularly are imprisoned or
exhiled to Eastern Siberia, or are "committed" to
psychiatric prisons, or simply disappear. Three
million dissidents are currently held in Soviet pris
ons.
Although not since Stalin have Jews been perse
cuted systematically, recently there has been an
alarming upsurge in officially sanctioned anti-
Semitic propaganda and restrictions of Jewish na

tional and cultural activity.
Religious practices are restricted. Hebrew can be
taught only by Russian Orthodox priests and by
government "Jewish experts." Prominent Hebrew
teachers have been routinely arrested and im
prisoned on fraudulent charges. These include:
• Yosef Begun. Arrested in 1982 for anti-Soviet
agitation. Sentenced to seven years of hard labor
and five years of internal exhile.
• Alexander Kholmiansky. Arrested in 1984 for
"aggravated hooliganism." Sentenced to 18 months
of hard labor.

For much of Eastern
Europe, Soviet tyranny
merely replaced
German tyranny.

Others, such as human rights activists Anatoly
Shcharansky and Yuri Litvin languish and die in
prison, forgotten by all but a few.
American Jewish groups and Western leaders
alike were outraged to hear that during Soviet ob
servances of VE-Day held at Buchenwald, no men
tion was made of Jewish suffering during the war.
Such disregard for the 6 million victims of the Nazi
Holocaust may not surprise those who recall that
Stalin's own holocaust — Jews, Ukranians, Russian
kulaks, Lithuanians, murdered to "make way for the
revolution" — claimed more than 30 million lives.
In fact, Soviet officials took the opportunity to con
demn Jewish nationalism as the new Zionism.
In 1979, 50,000 Jews were allowed to emigrate

from the Soviet Union, largely due to American
pressure, trade concessions and cash payments.
Since then, more than over 350,000 Jews have
completed applications for emigration. In 1984,
only 896 Jews were allowed to leave.
Demands of "Never again!" are pitifully useless
to stop the institutionalized persecution of those
left behind the Iron Curtain. If we are serious in
preventing tyranny, we must open our eyes to the
tyranny which exists around us.
Soviet crimes should no longer go unreported,
nor should our outrage be muzzled by the fear of
damaged Soviet relations. Names such as
Birobidzhan, the "Jewish Homeland" in Eastern
Siberia where many Jewish dissidents are exhiled,
Kolyma, the notorious mining camp where
thousands died digging gold for Stalin, and Chris
topol Prison should replace Auschwitz, Dachau
and Bergen-Belsen as symbols of the new tyranny
which threatens not just Jews but all people.
May 8, 1945, should commemorate not only
Allied victory, but also Allied indifference, ap
peasement and isolationism of a decade earlier
which allowed a criminal such as Hitler to consoli
date power. We must also bear some guilt for those
who suffered under tyranny. Had the Western na
tions opposed Hitler earlier, the sacrifices of World
War II and the ensuing bitter peace might have
been avoided.
As Thomas Jefferson said, "Those who expect to
reap the blessing of freedom . . . must undergo the
fatigues of supporting it." America's freedom is
closely tied to that of a community of free nations.
As the leader of the free world, America must ful
fill her moral responsibility to stand by all those in
the world who are threatened by tyranny. We must
be willing to make the promise which President
Reagan made at Bitburg: "Today, freedom loving
people around the world must say, 'I am a Berliner.
I am a Jew in a world still threatened by anti-
Semitism. I am an Afghan and I am a prisoner of
the Gulag. I am a refugee in a crowded boat foun
dering off the coast of Vietnam. I am a Laotian, a
Cuban and a Miskito indian in Nicaragua. I too am
a potential victim of totalitarianism.' "
Only by recognizing totalitarianism as the
tyranny which threatens peace in the world, and
only by feeling the suffering of all who fall under its
yoke* can we begin to say with confidence, "Never
again!"

The controversy which surrounded President
Reagan's recent trip to West Germany reveals that
for many, still, after 40 years, the psychic scars of
World War II and the Nazi Holocaust have not
faded.
By laying a wreath at the Bitburg cemetery, con
taining among the 2,000 German war dead the
bodies of 49 members of Hitler's Waffen-SS,
Reagan appeared to honor both the victim and the
villain of the Nazi terror and to paper over German
complicity in the name of reconciliation among
former enemies now allied in the defense of
Europe.
For the few survivors of the Holocaust, and for
many who share their suffering, life is a constant
vigil. The crimes perpetrated at Bergen-Belsen,
Buchenwald, Auschwitz, among other places, are
unimaginable. Many, such as Elie Wiesel, believe
that if humankind is to guarantee that "never
again" will the Holocaust be repeated, the memory
of it must never fade.
Thus, May 8, 1945, is fixed in memory as much
to celebrate the Allied liberation of Europe as it is
to commemorate and to mourn more than 6 million
Jews who died under Nazi tyranny.
May 8, 1945, bears a second legacy which is of
