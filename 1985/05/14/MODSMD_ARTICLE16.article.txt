## Don't fund education with this money 
### 
Political Science Prof. David Abernethy, colum
nist Bill Evers and University President Donald
Kennedy have all argued recently for continued
Stanford investment in corporations which do busi
ness in South Africa. While Kennedy maintains
that the opinion of experts is split on the question
of whether or not divestment would hurt black
South Africans, Abernethy and Evers agree that it
would indeed have such an effect. It is my opinion
that both their positions and their reasoning are
severely flawed.

VIEWPOINT

As others have pointed out, American divest
ment would only cause about 100,000 South
African blacks, less than 1 percent of the black
population, to lose their jobs. However, the main
reason why total divestment is Stanford's best op
tion is that American investments in South Africa
clearly hurt blacks more than they help them. Al
though the black union movement does receive a
relatively small amount of money as a result of
American investments, the benefit to blacks is very
minimal compared to the much larger benefits the
white minority accrues as a result of our invest
ments.
American firms pay blacks very low wages to
produce goods which are almost totally reserved
for consumption by whites. Thus, the more blacks
work, and the more Americans invest, the richer
the whites become and the greater the oppression
against blacks.
Every American dollar invested in South Africa
ultimately helps to maintain the present racist gov
ernment and the apartheid system. This is true for a
number of reasons. First, blacks are forced, be
cause of the hiring policies of foreign companies, to
take low-paying jobs, while the whites get higher
paying managerial jobs.
Second. American companies play an important
role in many crucial industries, including oil and
computers. The investments in these areas
strengthen the South African economy a great deal,
rendering the white minority government richer
and stronger.
Finally, taxes on every gotxl produced go to sup
port the South African government, including the
police and military, who forcibly maintain the
apartheid system.
It has been asserted that by continuing to invest

in companies that do business in South Africa, we
can act as a progressive force for change. Seven
years ago, the Stanford trustees said the same thing,
yet since then they have done nothing of the sort.
But, again, this is not the main issue. Even if we
do force some companies to appease black South
African workers with small salary increases and
other token gestures, our investments are still going
to help the white minority and the present govern
ment a lot more than they help blacks.
In addition, it will be nearly impossible to bring
about any real change in South Africa in this way,
because it is in the economic self-interest of all
American companies to keep the blacks oppressed
and to maintain the apartheid system. As long as
blacks are forced to work for very low wages and to
live in poverty on the worst land, American com
panies will continue to reap huge profits.
Over the past 20 years, American corporations
have had every opportunity to help blacks in their
struggle, and yet they have done no such thing.
During this period, black incomes have continually
decreased, while white incomes have risen con
siderably.

South African blacks have been told to wait just a
few more years for at least the last 20 years.

The presence of American companies has done
almost nothing to help, and very much to hurt,
black South Africans, and there is no reason to
believe that this is going to change in the future.
Stanford's only solution is to remove its money
from companies in South Africa and to press others
to do the same.
Our goal. then, should be the complete
departure of all American companies from South
Africa. I do not think, based on experience, that
the University can be at all effective in this effort if
it continues to invest in companies in South Africa.
Our best means would be to pull our money out of
all corporations in South Africa, and to agree to
repurchase stock in those companies only after they
have left South Africa.

Kennedy says that such effects disappear quickly,
but I think that an action of this kind, with a prom
ise to repurchase stock once the company has left
South Africa, combined with a large movement to
boycott the products of companies in South Africa,
could achieve considerable success.
Most opponents of divestment ignore the ques
tion of the morality of having reaped and continu
ing to reap profits from such an unjust system.
Even if the trustees do not think divestment would
help blacks, it is still fundamentally wrong to profit
from the apartheid system, a system under which
blacks and whites are forcibly segregated, families
are split apart and black children die from mal
nourishment.
We at Stanford should be unwilling, under any
circumstances, to gain from this kind oppression
and misery, and even less willing to fund an educa
tion with this money. Kennedy maintains that if we
sell our stock, then somebody else will just buy it. If
that does happen, and if American companies con
tinue to aid in the oppression of South African
blacks, then let those other people accept the moral
responsibility for their actions.

Finally, Kennedy states that he believes a two
year timetahle for the dismantling of the apartheid
system is a reasonable one. If we told a black South
African, say one who is in prison for advocating
divestment, to wait two more years. I am sure he
would view our request cynically. South African
blacks have been told to wait just a few more years
for at least the last 20 years.
For this reason, the trustees, if they do not vote
for total divestment, should sign an agreement to
divest of all companies in South Africa in 1987, un
less the apartheid system is being dismantled. Such
an action would proclaim to everyone that Stanford
is truly interested in the dissolution of the apartheid
system.

Kennedy says that such effects disappear quickly,
but I think that an action of this kind, with a prom
ise to repurchase stock once the company has left
South Africa, combined with a large movement to
boycott the products of companies in South Africa,
could achieve considerable success.
Most opponents of divestment ignore the ques
tion of the morality of having reaped and continu
ing to reap profits from such an unjust system.
Even if the trustees do not think divestment would
help blacks, it is still fundamentally wrong to profit
from the apartheid system, a system under which
blacks and whites are forcibly segregated, families
are split apart and black children die from mal
nourishment.
We at Stanford should be unwilling, under any
circumstances, to gain from this kind oppression
and misery, and even less willing to fund an educa
tion with this money. Kennedy maintains that if we
sell our stock, then somebody else will just buy it. If
that does happen, and if American companies con
tinue to aid in the oppression of South African
blacks, then let those other people accept the moral
responsibility for their actions.

Finally, Kennedy states that he believes a two
year timetahle for the dismantling of the apartheid
system is a reasonable one. If we told a black South
African, say one who is in prison for advocating
divestment, to wait two more years. I am sure he
would view our request cynically. South African
blacks have been told to wait just a few more years
for at least the last 20 years.
For this reason, the trustees, if they do not vote
for total divestment, should sign an agreement to
divest of all companies in South Africa in 1987, un
less the apartheid system is being dismantled. Such
an action would proclaim to everyone that Stanford
is truly interested in the dissolution of the apartheid
system.

Political Science Prof. David Abernethy, colum
nist Bill Evers and University President Donald
Kennedy have all argued recently for continued
Stanford investment in corporations which do busi
ness in South Africa. While Kennedy maintains
that the opinion of experts is split on the question
of whether or not divestment would hurt black
South Africans, Abernethy and Evers agree that it
would indeed have such an effect. It is my opinion
that both their positions and their reasoning are
severely flawed.

VIEWPOINT

As others have pointed out, American divest
ment would only cause about 100,000 South
African blacks, less than 1 percent of the black
population, to lose their jobs. However, the main
reason why total divestment is Stanford's best op
tion is that American investments in South Africa
clearly hurt blacks more than they help them. Al
though the black union movement does receive a
relatively small amount of money as a result of
American investments, the benefit to blacks is very
minimal compared to the much larger benefits the
white minority accrues as a result of our invest
ments.
American firms pay blacks very low wages to
produce goods which are almost totally reserved
for consumption by whites. Thus, the more blacks
work, and the more Americans invest, the richer
the whites become and the greater the oppression
against blacks.
Every American dollar invested in South Africa
ultimately helps to maintain the present racist gov
ernment and the apartheid system. This is true for a
number of reasons. First, blacks are forced, be
cause of the hiring policies of foreign companies, to
take low-paying jobs, while the whites get higher
paying managerial jobs.
Second. American companies play an important
role in many crucial industries, including oil and
computers. The investments in these areas
strengthen the South African economy a great deal,
rendering the white minority government richer
and stronger.
Finally, taxes on every gotxl produced go to sup
port the South African government, including the
police and military, who forcibly maintain the
apartheid system.
It has been asserted that by continuing to invest

in companies that do business in South Africa, we
can act as a progressive force for change. Seven
years ago, the Stanford trustees said the same thing,
yet since then they have done nothing of the sort.
But, again, this is not the main issue. Even if we
do force some companies to appease black South
African workers with small salary increases and
other token gestures, our investments are still going
to help the white minority and the present govern
ment a lot more than they help blacks.
In addition, it will be nearly impossible to bring
about any real change in South Africa in this way,
because it is in the economic self-interest of all
American companies to keep the blacks oppressed
and to maintain the apartheid system. As long as
blacks are forced to work for very low wages and to
live in poverty on the worst land, American com
panies will continue to reap huge profits.
Over the past 20 years, American corporations
have had every opportunity to help blacks in their
struggle, and yet they have done no such thing.
During this period, black incomes have continually
decreased, while white incomes have risen con
siderably.

South African blacks have been told to wait just a
few more years for at least the last 20 years.

The presence of American companies has done
almost nothing to help, and very much to hurt,
black South Africans, and there is no reason to
believe that this is going to change in the future.
Stanford's only solution is to remove its money
from companies in South Africa and to press others
to do the same.
Our goal. then, should be the complete
departure of all American companies from South
Africa. I do not think, based on experience, that
the University can be at all effective in this effort if
it continues to invest in companies in South Africa.
Our best means would be to pull our money out of
all corporations in South Africa, and to agree to
repurchase stock in those companies only after they
have left South Africa.

Kennedy says that such effects disappear quickly,
but I think that an action of this kind, with a prom
ise to repurchase stock once the company has left
South Africa, combined with a large movement to
boycott the products of companies in South Africa,
could achieve considerable success.
