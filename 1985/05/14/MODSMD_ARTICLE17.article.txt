Tanner misperceived
We would like to correct a few
misconceptions in Dennis Backlund's
viewpoint concerning the Tanner
Lectures in Human Values (The
Daily, May 7). We didn't attend the
lectures, but John Rawls' book, "A
Theory of Justice," is on the L.A.
Times Book Review list of "100
Books for the Modern Library," so
an assumption that the "educated
public" would be familiar with it is
not too unreasonable. Most of the
educated public also ought to know
what "synchronic" and "norms of
behavior" mean. If Backlund had
read Michael Slote's work, he would
know that it is not any more
"technical" than Kant's, which he
suggested the Tanner lectures should
emulate. But in any case, Backlund
seems to misunderstand the purpose
of the Tanner lecture series. They
are not meant as a two-hour Intro
duction to Ethics course for doctors,
bankers and lawyers. Rather, "the
purpose of the Tanner lectures is to
advance and reflect upon the schol
arly and scientific learning relating to
human values and valuation." It is
toward this purpose that experts in
the field are brought in to improve
the level of discussion. This year's
lectures were not terribly technical:
The issues Slote discussed are of
central concern in numerous schol
arly fields, e.g. economics, political
science, philosophy, history and law.
While we regret that Backlund did
not enjoy Slote's lecture, we find
the Tanner Lectures in Human
Values to be an exciting, intellec
tually stimulating contribution to the
Stanford community.

Lingering questions
Due to time constraints at the
divestment forum last week, several
important questions were left un
answered, one of which is critical in
the debate between selective and
total divestment.
1. Granting that the best way to
implement the Sullivan Principles is
through a policy of selective divest
ment, at the forum I asked the trus
tees if they would like to be blacks in
South Africa living under the Sul
livan Principles (which improve work
conditions for blacks, but leave them

with no political rights whatsoever),
The trustee representatives an
swered with a clear "no."
A follow-up question which I did
not get to ask is, "Why push for a
policy of selective divestment (which
isn't even being done) if all it ac
complishes is putting blacks in a
position you yourselves wouldn't
want to be in, rather than pushing
for sometning greater?"
2. The Committee on Research
recently met to discuss conflict of
interest. It turns out that a Univer
sity policy on disclosure of stock
holdings exists and has been imple
mented. It is known as the Heffner
memorandum of Sept. 28, 1966.
Section 2b states that a situation
requiring disclosure is the recom
mendation of the purchase (or sale)
of any item from a private firm in
which the individual has an interest.
I would like to ask: "Why is it that
the president and the vice-president
for budget and finance have not
complied with this policy, which
applies to all University employees?
Why is it that what is considered a
conflict of interest requiring full
disclosure for non-trustees is not
considered such for trustees?"
3. In his open letter to the Stan
ford community. University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy wrote,
"Bishop Tutu has said that unless the
system (of apartheid) is being dis
mantled within two years, he will
urge foreign companies to leave. I
believe that timetable is fair and
reasonable, and that it can be made a
rallying point for those who wish to
use economic influence con
structively rather than discard it." I
believe this to be sincere, and not
just empty rhetoric. But the proof of
sincerity is in action.
The question remains: "Is the
Board of Trustees willing to vote
now (not in two years) for total
divestment to begin in two years if
Tutu judges that apartheid is not
being dismantled?"
