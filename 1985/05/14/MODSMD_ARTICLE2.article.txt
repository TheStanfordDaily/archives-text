By taking advantage of numerous
undergraduate research grants, Stan
ford students are expanding their
educations beyond classroom walls.
Firestone grants and scholarships,
offered by the Center for Latin
American Studies and the Anthro
pology Department, are awarded to
qualified students who pursue re
search projects in the humanities and
sciences. According to Laura
Selznick, director of Ex
tradepartmental Programs, these
grants allow undergraduates to take
advantage of "research as a learning
tool."
Firestone grants have provided a
total of $50,000 to 20 students for
use in laboratory and field research.
The maximum award given by the
Firestone grants was $2,500. A total
of 73 applications for major grants
were filed, and 10 students asked for
smaller grants, Selznick said.
The applications were initially
evaluated and screened by the indi
vidual academic departments, she ex
plained. The winners were selected
by a final committee of faculty mem
bers. Each student is sponsored by a
faculty adviser, who will receive
$1,000 for his aid, Selznick added.
Sophomore Jill "Jacobson,' an riTP"
thropology major, will spend next
summer in Senegal to research the
function of women's clubs in the mi
grant community. Jacobson is
researching how the women's clubs
aid women in the transition from vil
lage culture to the city.
The rate of rural to urban migra
tion is increasing rapidly, according to
Jacobson. It is predicted that the larg
est and most poorly planned cities
will be in the Third World by the end
of this century, she said. Research is
necessary to formulate more sensitive
political solutions for the problems of
urban migrants, she added.
Jacobson said she needed to
prepare extensively on her topic
before she received the Firestone
grant. She has taken numerous an
thropology courses and classes in
Wolof, the native dialect of Senegal.
It will take Jacobson nine months to
complete her study of women's clubs,
which will include writing an ethnog
raphy describing her research.
"I wanted to do any anthropologi
cal field research before graduating,"
Jacobson said, "because anthropol
ogy is the study of culture directly."
Regarding the importance of un
dergraduate research, Jacobson said,
"I think that opportunities should be
available for students to teach them
selves."
Jacobson also received a grant
from the Michelle Rosaldo Memorial
Fund in the Anthropology Depart
ment. This year, four of the 10 appli
cants were awarded these grants, ac-
