# Grants support research

By taking advantage of numerous
undergraduate research grants, Stan
ford students are expanding their
educations beyond classroom walls.
Firestone grants and scholarships,
offered by the Center for Latin
American Studies and the Anthro
pology Department, are awarded to
qualified students who pursue re
search projects in the humanities and
sciences. According to Laura
Selznick, director of Ex
tradepartmental Programs, these
grants allow undergraduates to take
advantage of "research as a learning
tool."
Firestone grants have provided a
total of $50,000 to 20 students for
use in laboratory and field research.
The maximum award given by the
Firestone grants was $2,500. A total
of 73 applications for major grants
were filed, and 10 students asked for
smaller grants, Selznick said.
The applications were initially
evaluated and screened by the indi
vidual academic departments, she ex
plained. The winners were selected
by a final committee of faculty mem
bers. Each student is sponsored by a
faculty adviser, who will receive
$1,000 for his aid, Selznick added.
Sophomore Jill "Jacobson,' an riTP"
thropology major, will spend next
summer in Senegal to research the
function of women's clubs in the mi
grant community. Jacobson is
researching how the women's clubs
aid women in the transition from vil
lage culture to the city.
The rate of rural to urban migra
tion is increasing rapidly, according to
Jacobson. It is predicted that the larg
est and most poorly planned cities
will be in the Third World by the end
of this century, she said. Research is
necessary to formulate more sensitive
political solutions for the problems of
urban migrants, she added.
Jacobson said she needed to
prepare extensively on her topic
before she received the Firestone
grant. She has taken numerous an
thropology courses and classes in
Wolof, the native dialect of Senegal.
It will take Jacobson nine months to
complete her study of women's clubs,
which will include writing an ethnog
raphy describing her research.
"I wanted to do any anthropologi
cal field research before graduating,"
Jacobson said, "because anthropol
ogy is the study of culture directly."
Regarding the importance of un
dergraduate research, Jacobson said,
"I think that opportunities should be
available for students to teach them
selves."
Jacobson also received a grant
from the Michelle Rosaldo Memorial
Fund in the Anthropology Depart
ment. This year, four of the 10 appli
cants were awarded these grants, ac-
cording to Marjorie Wright, the aca
demic assistant in the Anthropology
Department. Funding for undergrad
uate research has been available for
at least five years, she said.
Firestone grant recipient Steve
Hellman, a junior majoring in eco
nomics, will also study abroad this
summer, researching how the United

States is adapting to its declining
power in Central America. Hellman
will spend time in Nicaragua, El Sal
vador and Washington D.C. He plans
to compile his findings into an honors
thesis, he said.
Junior Gabrielle Glaser, another
Firestone grant recipient, will spend
10 weeks in Haiti this summer
researching the correlation between

the country's native literary move
ment of 1915-1934 and the 1946
overthrow of the Haitian mulatto
elite.
Glaser, a history major, has also
received a grant from the Center for
Latin American Studies. According
to Sharon Phillips, program coordina
tor of the center, one of the purposes
of these grants is to "promote re
search so the students have material
to write an honors paper." Available
since the mid-19605, the Latin Amer
ican Studies grants are funded by the
Mellon and Tinker Foundations.
Other Stanford students will work
in university laboratories this sum
mer. Working in the laboratory at the
Stanford Medical School Pediatrics
Department, Junior Charles Kim will
use his Firestone grant to attempt to
develop a drug to eliminate the
buildup of the toxin bilyrubin. In in
fants, excess bilyrubin causes
jaundice and brain damage.
He mentioned that the doctors also
benefit from undergraduate research,
because this is "all [research] they
would have to do anyway."
Junior Julja Burchard, a biology
major, received a Firestone grant to
research myosin, a protein which
causes motion in muscles. In her re
search, Burchard observes how
myosin, when placed on beads
threaded on filaments, causes the
beads to move. She will research her
topic through fall quarter.
Junior Jack Parent, another Fire
stone grant recipient, is researching
how pharmaceutical agents affect the
rate of learning in rabbits. Parent, a
human biology major, is trying to pin
point the systems of the brain in
which learning takes place and to dis
cover the effects of drugs on these
systems.
