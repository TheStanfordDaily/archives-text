## Water polo takes national title 
### VAL CRITES Editorial staff 
The Stanford women's water polo team captured
its first collegiate crown at the national champion
ships this weekend at UC-San Diego in convincing
fashion.
In the decisive game Sunday against UC-Santa
Barbara, the Cardinal overwhelmed the Gauchos
12-7 to take the title. The game was not even as
close as the score might indicate, for Stanford
jumped out to an early lead and never trailed in
garnering the national championship.
The Cardinal started on the path to victory
Friday, overwhelming Pomona 15-0. Stanford
team captain Mariana Ysrael led the team with four
goals in the rout. Val White, Lorna Thornton,
Carol Lieske, Maddy Metzgerand Dena Rodriguez
all tallied twice, and Jill Palmer added one goal.
Saturday's games proved more challenging, but
Stanford again prevailed. In the morning game, the
Cardinal toppled defending champion Slippery
Rock by a score of 7-6.
After spotting Slippery Rock a one-goal lead,
Stanford came back to tie the score on a goal by
Metzger with 2:24 remaining in the seven-minute
first quarter. Goals by Thornton and Mev Vetters
gave Stanford a 3-1 advantage at the end of the
quarter, and the Cardinal held the lead for the
remainder of the game.
In the game, Thornton scored three times, Vet
ters knocked home two goals, and Metzger and
White added one each.
In the afternoon game, Stanford once more came
from behind, this time to defeat UC-Davis 9-8.
After jumping to an early lead on a goal by
Rodriguez, the Cardinal fell behind the Aggies 3-1.
Lieske pumped home a goal with three seconds
left in the quarter to leave Stanford one goal down

at the first break. The Cardinal then rallied behind
goals by Vetters and Metzger to take a 4-3 lead at
halftime.
Stanford never trailed again, with scores in the
third quarter by Thornton and Metzger and in the
final frame by Thornton, Metzgerand Vetters.
With three straight victories, Stanford entered
Sunday's competition as the top team from its
bracket. The Cardinal's morning opponent was
UC-San Diego, the second-place finisher from the
other bracket.
The Tritons upset the Cardinal 12-9 in a game
marked by Stanford miscues. UC-San Diego took
advantage of a number of 6-on-5 scoring opportu
nities, and this provided the margin of victory in a
game in which the lead was tied five times.
Metzger led Stanford with three goals, Thornton
scored twice, and Ysrael, Rodriguez, Vetters and
White each added a goal.
Entering the final game against UC-Santa Bar
bara, Stanford had to win by at least five goals in
order to triumph in the point-differential category
that determines the champion from among teams
with identical records.
In four previous meetings between the teams,
each had triumphed twice, so the game figured to
be fairly even. It wasn't.
Vetters absolutely dominated Santa Barbara,
finishing the game with six goals, including four of
Stanford's first five tallies, and several assists and
steals. Vetters'.scoring spree was interrupted only
by a goal by Rodriguez off a picture-perfect drive
in which she left her guard befuddled and out of
place.
At halftime, the Cardinal led by a score of 8-4,
and showed no signs of letting up. A goal by Vet
ters increased the score to 9-4 with less than a min
ute gone in the third quarter, and Stanford goalie

Karen Docter allowed only one return tally by the
Gauchos. Docter and the Cardinal defense virtually
shut down the highly touted Santa Barbara offense,
pressing the Gauchos into turnovers.
In the final quarter, White scored with 13
seconds gone to post the essential five-goal lead.
After a Gaucho score, Vetters regained the margin,
pushing the score to 11-6, and, a minute later, Ys
rael upped the lead to six with the final goal of her
Stanford career.
Santa Barbara came back to cut the margin to
12-7, but came no closer, and the Cardinal had se
cured the national title.
In addition to Vetters' half-dozen goals,
Rodriguez, Metzger, Lieske, Palmer, White and Ys
rael notched scores.
For her effort, Vetters was named to the All-
Tournament team. Teammates Ysrael and Palmer
were named to the second-team, and Thornton,
Metzger and Docter received honorable mention.
Each of the players emphasized the role that
teamwork played in the victories. Palmer said, "We
couldn't have won if everybody hadn't pulled to
gether and worked as a team."
Ysrael added, "In our last game we finally ap
plied all of the things that [Coach Martin Fischer]
has taught us, and the result was our best game of
the season. We played as a team and not as individ
uals, and the championship is ours as the
outcome."
Vetters concurred, "Individuals stood out be
cause the team as a whole played well and provided
the support we all needed."
Ysrael summed up the feelings of the team mem
bers and Fischer: "After four years of coming so
close, it's nice to be able to come home to Stanford
and say that we won."
