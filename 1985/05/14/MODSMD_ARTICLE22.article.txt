## 
### JENNIFER KOCH Staff sportswriter 
For the second time in three years, Stanford will host
one of college baseball's two West Regionals, the NCAA
announced yesterday. The four-team regional will be
played in Sunken Diamond on Memorial Day weekend,
May 24-27.
Two games will be played each day on Friday, Saturday
and Sunday, and a Monday game may be necessary
depending on the results of the double-elimination tourn
ament.
The NCAA also awarded regionals to No. 1-ranked
Texas, Mississippi State and Florida State. The other four
sites, as well as the complete 38-team field, will be an
nounced officially Monday.
At that time, the Cardinal will find out which three
teams are blocking its path to the College World Series.
The winning team from each regional site will travel to
Omaha, Neb., May 31-June 9 to compete for the national
title-
No. 2-ranked Stanford is the top team in the West. The
only other team in the region to secure a bid is West Coast
Athletic Conference champion Pepperdine. Stanford
clinched a berth nine days ago when it beat Arizona State

to win the Pacific 10 Southern Division with three games
to play.
The winners of postseason tournaments in the Western
Athletic Conference, the Pacific Coast Athletic Associa
tion and the Pac-10 Northern Division receive automatic
bids as well.
The Six-Pac runner-up is also almost assured of a bid.
California currently leads Arizona by a half game, but
plays a three-game series with Stanford this weekend to
close the season.
Before closing the season against Cal, Stanford travels
to Santa Clara today for another attempt to play the
Broncos in a non-conference game that has already been
rained out and rescheduled twice.
Stanford split a two-game series with Santa Clara in the
beginning of the season, but earlier this month, the Card
inal boosted its record with a convincing 11-8 win againsi
the Broncos.
"These games are important,:' Coach Mark Marquess
said. "They give more pitchers a chance to pitch and pro
vide the opportunity to play extra people."
Rob Wassenaar will be looking for his ninth win today
at 3 p.m. when he takes the mound for the Cardinal. Lee
Plemel and Rick Dietz are also scheduled to pitch.
