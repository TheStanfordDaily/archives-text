## 'Streetwise: a real movie captures the real world 
### STEVE VINEBERG Editorial staff 
The kids in "Streetwise," the documentary about
Seattle teenagers living off the streets, are the most
provocative cast of characters in any movie released this
season. Tiny is a 14-year-old hooker with an eternal
toothy grin and an alcoholic mother who is a hash-joint
waitress; of her father, she says philosophically, "For all I
know, he might be one of these dates (johns) walkin'
around. For all I know, I might have dated him." Her best
friend. Rat, lives with an older doper named Jack in an
abandoned hotel; when they can't make enough food
money panhandling or selling drugs, they raid "regs" —
local dumpsters that they check regularly, so that they
know how fresh the food is that people have tossed away.
DeWayne looks wasted and malnourished; his ribs stick
out, and his long arms and legs dangle lethargically. Shel
ley argues with her mother, who, saddled with seven kids
at the age of 32, can't understand why Shelley hasn't yet
forgiven her stepfather for molesting her when she was
younger — since, after all, he stopped doing it years ago.
Patti and Munchkin are, in the words of one of their
friends, "a street couple trying to survive," and that
means, inevitably, that Patti has to "turn dates"
sometimes while Munchkin pimps for her.

These young people, as well as a boy who sells blood to
make ends meet, and a tough lesbian who patrols the
streets protecting other girls she believes are being abused
by pimps, dates and cops, play out their lite stories un
sensationally and with some irony in "Streetwise," which
Cheryl McCall and Mary Ellen Mark fashioned out of
their Life magazine article, "Stories of the Lost," and
Martin Bell directed and photographed. There has been
some argument as to how much of the film is "caught"
footage and how much was written down, based on the
kids' experiences, and performed especially for the
camera, and apparently some viewers have found the
combination disconcerting. But if the filmmakers did
indeed dramatize incidents in the lives of their subjects,
they are following a distinguished precedent: The great
documentarian Robert Flaherty invented this procedure
in "Nanook of the North" and "Man of Aran." The only
issue, as far as I can see, is how much credit to give McCall
and Mark for screenwriting, and Tiny, Rat, DeWayne and
the others for acting, because if "Streetwise" falls into the
category of drama, then it contains some of the most start
i ling and unaffected acting currently on view, and some of
the most extraordinary writing.

Bell thinks like a director — the editing (by Nancy
Baker) is sophisticated, and the film moves dramatically.
It's not just a case of a competent documentary filmmaker
who has lit on a rich subject and knows enough not to
wreck it; "Streetwise" is a real (and emotionally complex)
movie. Inevitably, it brings the Brazilian "Pixote" to
mind, but Bell isn't the daring muckraker Hector Babenco
is; he's far more restrained, and though he exposes the
raw realities of existing off garbage and sex, the movie
doesn't have a raw feeling — it's not an open wound, like
"Pixote" was. (For one thing, the photography, though it
is often lovely, is more accomplished than evocative.)
Bell's methods are more indirect. He emphasizes how
much these kids have in common with ordinary suburban

teenagers: Self-conscious, self-serious, sentimental, ten
ding to form very strong attachments (like Rat and Tiny's,
which provides the emotional focus of the picture), prone
to gossip and cutting up, they recall the adolescents in our
own experience, except that the topics they address in
clude getting busted and getting beaten up and picking up
old men. When Rat visits Tiny, who's been thrown in
detention for prostitution, she giggles over her arrest as if
she'd been caught breaking curfew and grounded for the
weekend. Yet we've seen Tiny's mother, a touchingly in
effectual woman with Tiny's scrunched mandarin face
("It's just a phase she's going through," she says of Tiny's
whoring; "I'm not going to try to stop her, because she's
going to do it anyway") who has her own troubles (drink
and a violent husband), and we know that when these two
messed-up, mutually caring people share their problems,
Tiny is more likely to give maternal advice than her
mother is. DeWayne has a slightly reticent, winning man
ner and a fuzzy, attenuated verbal style; he's like the
sweet, out-of-it kid at the back of the class who you feel

would be a lot happier if he didn't have to attend school.
But we see DeWayne visiting his father in prison, where
he's serving a term for robbery and attempted arson — his
father, who looks more like a greasy, overweight
bartender than a thief, and whose lectures to his son about
selling dope on the streets are interspersed with expres
sions of exasperation over DeWayne's habit of chewing
his fingernails. (This scene, which ends with the father
promising his son he'll make it all up to him — "I love you
a big, big bunch," he tells him, and the two of them to
gether, he swears, can "whip the whole world" — is ut
terly amazing.)
Because of the familiarity of these kids' style — of the
post-Valley Girl diction of Kimberley, the first-time-out
streetwalker who chooses among pimps the way another
teenager might select a new hairstyle — we are constantly
being pulled up short by "Streetwise," and astonished by
the desperate straits in which the subjects of the
filmmakers' inquiry find themselves. It isn't clear how
many of the kids who hang out downtown have left com

fortable homes for the dangerous allure of the streets
(Kimberley, we suspect, is one, and Patrice, whose mother
and grandmother "visit" him in his chosen habitat, ap
pears to be another), so the movie leaves us wondering
how close to the edge all teenagers are. At the end of the
film, we learn that one of the cast has committed suicide,
and we shake our heads in bewildered disbelief: These
kids seem so resilient, such determined survivors — who
could have known things had gone so far? Teen suicide is
a popular subject on TV this year, but 1 wasn't persuaded
that those good-looking kids with the permanently wrin
kled brows in the TV film "Surviving" really represented
the adolescents out there who are in danger of losing con
trol, any more than I was convinced that the kids in "The
Breakfast Club" were saying anything worth listening to
in their all-day bull session. The young heroes and
heroines of "Streetwise," who come from the real world,
are finally beyond our ken and probably beyond our help;
all we can do with these "Stories of the Lost" is read 'em
and weep.

streetwalker who chooses among pimps the way another
teenager might select a new hairstyle — we are constantly
being pulled up short by "Streetwise," and astonished by
the desperate straits in which the subjects of the
filmmakers' inquiry find themselves. It isn't clear how
many of the kids who hang out downtown have left com

fortable homes for the dangerous allure of the streets
(Kimberley, we suspect, is one, and Patrice, whose mother
and grandmother "visit" him in his chosen habitat, ap
pears to be another), so the movie leaves us wondering
how close to the edge all teenagers are. At the end of the
film, we learn that one of the cast has committed suicide,
and we shake our heads in bewildered disbelief: These
kids seem so resilient, such determined survivors — who
could have known things had gone so far? Teen suicide is
a popular subject on TV this year, but 1 wasn't persuaded
that those good-looking kids with the permanently wrin
kled brows in the TV film "Surviving" really represented
the adolescents out there who are in danger of losing con
trol, any more than I was convinced that the kids in "The
Breakfast Club" were saying anything worth listening to
in their all-day bull session. The young heroes and
heroines of "Streetwise," who come from the real world,
are finally beyond our ken and probably beyond our help;
all we can do with these "Stories of the Lost" is read 'em
and weep.
The kids in "Streetwise," the documentary about
Seattle teenagers living off the streets, are the most
provocative cast of characters in any movie released this
season. Tiny is a 14-year-old hooker with an eternal
toothy grin and an alcoholic mother who is a hash-joint
waitress; of her father, she says philosophically, "For all I
know, he might be one of these dates (johns) walkin'
around. For all I know, I might have dated him." Her best
friend. Rat, lives with an older doper named Jack in an
abandoned hotel; when they can't make enough food
money panhandling or selling drugs, they raid "regs" —
local dumpsters that they check regularly, so that they
know how fresh the food is that people have tossed away.
DeWayne looks wasted and malnourished; his ribs stick
out, and his long arms and legs dangle lethargically. Shel
ley argues with her mother, who, saddled with seven kids
at the age of 32, can't understand why Shelley hasn't yet
forgiven her stepfather for molesting her when she was
younger — since, after all, he stopped doing it years ago.
Patti and Munchkin are, in the words of one of their
friends, "a street couple trying to survive," and that
means, inevitably, that Patti has to "turn dates"
sometimes while Munchkin pimps for her.

These young people, as well as a boy who sells blood to
make ends meet, and a tough lesbian who patrols the
streets protecting other girls she believes are being abused
by pimps, dates and cops, play out their lite stories un
sensationally and with some irony in "Streetwise," which
Cheryl McCall and Mary Ellen Mark fashioned out of
their Life magazine article, "Stories of the Lost," and
Martin Bell directed and photographed. There has been
some argument as to how much of the film is "caught"
footage and how much was written down, based on the
kids' experiences, and performed especially for the
camera, and apparently some viewers have found the
combination disconcerting. But if the filmmakers did
indeed dramatize incidents in the lives of their subjects,
they are following a distinguished precedent: The great
documentarian Robert Flaherty invented this procedure
in "Nanook of the North" and "Man of Aran." The only
issue, as far as I can see, is how much credit to give McCall
and Mark for screenwriting, and Tiny, Rat, DeWayne and
the others for acting, because if "Streetwise" falls into the
category of drama, then it contains some of the most start
i ling and unaffected acting currently on view, and some of
the most extraordinary writing.

Bell thinks like a director — the editing (by Nancy
Baker) is sophisticated, and the film moves dramatically.
It's not just a case of a competent documentary filmmaker
who has lit on a rich subject and knows enough not to
wreck it; "Streetwise" is a real (and emotionally complex)
movie. Inevitably, it brings the Brazilian "Pixote" to
mind, but Bell isn't the daring muckraker Hector Babenco
is; he's far more restrained, and though he exposes the
raw realities of existing off garbage and sex, the movie
doesn't have a raw feeling — it's not an open wound, like
"Pixote" was. (For one thing, the photography, though it
is often lovely, is more accomplished than evocative.)
Bell's methods are more indirect. He emphasizes how
much these kids have in common with ordinary suburban

teenagers: Self-conscious, self-serious, sentimental, ten
ding to form very strong attachments (like Rat and Tiny's,
which provides the emotional focus of the picture), prone
to gossip and cutting up, they recall the adolescents in our
own experience, except that the topics they address in
clude getting busted and getting beaten up and picking up
old men. When Rat visits Tiny, who's been thrown in
detention for prostitution, she giggles over her arrest as if
she'd been caught breaking curfew and grounded for the
weekend. Yet we've seen Tiny's mother, a touchingly in
effectual woman with Tiny's scrunched mandarin face
("It's just a phase she's going through," she says of Tiny's
whoring; "I'm not going to try to stop her, because she's
going to do it anyway") who has her own troubles (drink
and a violent husband), and we know that when these two
messed-up, mutually caring people share their problems,
Tiny is more likely to give maternal advice than her
mother is. DeWayne has a slightly reticent, winning man
ner and a fuzzy, attenuated verbal style; he's like the
sweet, out-of-it kid at the back of the class who you feel

would be a lot happier if he didn't have to attend school.
But we see DeWayne visiting his father in prison, where
he's serving a term for robbery and attempted arson — his
father, who looks more like a greasy, overweight
bartender than a thief, and whose lectures to his son about
selling dope on the streets are interspersed with expres
sions of exasperation over DeWayne's habit of chewing
his fingernails. (This scene, which ends with the father
promising his son he'll make it all up to him — "I love you
a big, big bunch," he tells him, and the two of them to
gether, he swears, can "whip the whole world" — is ut
terly amazing.)
