## 'Streetwise: a real movie captures the real world 
### STEVE VINEBERG Editorial staff 
The kids in "Streetwise," the documentary about
Seattle teenagers living off the streets, are the most
provocative cast of characters in any movie released this
season. Tiny is a 14-year-old hooker with an eternal
toothy grin and an alcoholic mother who is a hash-joint
waitress; of her father, she says philosophically, "For all I
know, he might be one of these dates (johns) walkin'
around. For all I know, I might have dated him." Her best
friend. Rat, lives with an older doper named Jack in an
abandoned hotel; when they can't make enough food
money panhandling or selling drugs, they raid "regs" —
local dumpsters that they check regularly, so that they
know how fresh the food is that people have tossed away.
DeWayne looks wasted and malnourished; his ribs stick
out, and his long arms and legs dangle lethargically. Shel
ley argues with her mother, who, saddled with seven kids
at the age of 32, can't understand why Shelley hasn't yet
forgiven her stepfather for molesting her when she was
younger — since, after all, he stopped doing it years ago.
Patti and Munchkin are, in the words of one of their
friends, "a street couple trying to survive," and that
means, inevitably, that Patti has to "turn dates"
sometimes while Munchkin pimps for her.

These young people, as well as a boy who sells blood to
make ends meet, and a tough lesbian who patrols the
streets protecting other girls she believes are being abused
by pimps, dates and cops, play out their lite stories un
sensationally and with some irony in "Streetwise," which
Cheryl McCall and Mary Ellen Mark fashioned out of
their Life magazine article, "Stories of the Lost," and
Martin Bell directed and photographed. There has been
some argument as to how much of the film is "caught"
footage and how much was written down, based on the
kids' experiences, and performed especially for the
camera, and apparently some viewers have found the
combination disconcerting. But if the filmmakers did
indeed dramatize incidents in the lives of their subjects,
they are following a distinguished precedent: The great
documentarian Robert Flaherty invented this procedure
in "Nanook of the North" and "Man of Aran." The only
issue, as far as I can see, is how much credit to give McCall
and Mark for screenwriting, and Tiny, Rat, DeWayne and
the others for acting, because if "Streetwise" falls into the
category of drama, then it contains some of the most start
i ling and unaffected acting currently on view, and some of
the most extraordinary writing.
