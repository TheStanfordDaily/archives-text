# Byrne's unique quality shines in album

David Byrne
ECM Records
A new David Byrne album?
Really?
Well, friends, yes and no. The yes
half is that David Byrne does appear
on a new album. The no half is that
this is neither a solo album, nor a
Talking Heads album.
"Music for 'The Knee Plays' " is the
score taken from Robert Wilson's
epic opera, "The CIVIL WarS" and
is no more a Byrne solo piece than
was his collaboration with Brian Eno
on "My Life in the Bush of Ghosts."
Rather, the music combines Byrne's
crisp percussive-style vocals with the
slow-to-develop music of Robert
Wilson — Wilson being perhaps best
known for his work with Philip Glass

on "Einstein On the Beach." Byrne
does not "sing" on any of the tracks,
though his voice's musical quality
pervades the tapestry of brass and
percussion effectively throughout the
work.
The music is a welcome departure
from the typical Talking Heads
sound. Byrne developed much of the
music from the traditions of Ameri
can jazz and gospel hymns with a spe
cial emphasis on the marching bands
of New Orleans (in particular the
Dirty Dozen Brass Band), whose cel
ebrated musicians carry their funeral
spirituals to the streets. A quick
glance down the back cover of the
record jacket reveals a list of 20 brass
players who appear on the album, in
cluding some of today's most sought
after session players, like Pete

Christlieb, Ernie Watts, Chuck
Findley and Garnett Brown.
"Tree (Today Is An Important Oc
casion)" starts the recording with a
rather solemn, yet majestic, brass and
bass sound interspersed with Byrne's
thought-provoking vocals. I must
confess that the instrumental rendi
tion of "In the Upper Room" was so
predictable and Muzakesque that I
could not fully appreciate or under
stand it until I had heard the entire al
bum and could then draw a
hermeneutic horizon from which to
evaluate the whole work and this
piece's necessary position in it. The
piece helps to develop a conformity
and loss of identity theme which
serves as a unifying element.
The musical qualities of "The
Sound of Business" help to make it
one of the most visual sections of the
album. Byrne's minimalist lyrics and
vocals provide an ironically effective
means of communicating the hustle
and bustle of present-day society.
"Social Studies" echoes the conform
ity theme through the rather
humorous idea of food. The song tells
of people who try to be like other
people by imitating their eating pat
terns — people "living identical lives
as long as the groceries lasted."
"(The Gift of Sound) Where the Sun

Never Goes Down" juxtaposes
images of movie-going with funeral
type jazz music to create an interest
ing and provocative piece. Phrases
like "Being in the theater is more im

portant than knowing what is going
on in the movie" reflect a certain
Byrne-like poetry that grows on the
listener.
A mechanical military-march is

drummed out in "Admiral Per*y,"
while " I've Tried" remains a slow and
sensitive blues tune. The latter's
beautiful sax solo contrasts with
Byrne's list of 26 seemingly dis
jointed and random items. Songs like
this are what cause many Talking
Heads fans to naively label Byrne a
"weird singer." However, when the
listener begins to decipher the con
nections among the items, he is more
likely to rephrase the previous com
ment to "a thinking artist."
"Winter" weaves trumpet fanfares
into a tapestry of sound best des
cribed as a Brian Eno loop tune. Fi
nally, "In the Future" seems to
summarize the work with its descrip
tions of a future life devoid of distin
guishing features which characterize
people and material objects today.
"Music for 'The Knee Plays' " is a
welcome relief at a time when radio is
still rehashing Wham! songs that put
in question the integrity of all music.
No doubt, some Talking Heads fans
will be disappointed. In fact, they
might even believe Byrne's incanta
tions to be more like speaking in
tongues than on the record bearing
that title. These same people may
wish to retitle tht recording "No
Sense" or "Start Making Sense," but
others will surely find real depth to
the work. Don't be surprised if this
album doesn't get much airplay, but
don't let that stop you from getting
your copy.
