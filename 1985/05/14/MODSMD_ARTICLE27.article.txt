## Daily FICA debt discussed ASSU committee eyes banking status 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Editorial staff 
The business manager of The Daily told the
ASSU Senate Appropriations Committee last night
that the recent discovery of $35,000 in unpaid
Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) taxes
will have little impact on the newpaper's financial
standing.
In response to testimony from Daily Business
Manager Andrew Shaddock and KZSU Business
Manager Ted Wheeler, the committee voted to rec
ommend to the full senate that The Daily and
KZSU be granted a one-year extension of their in
dependent banking status.
Currently, The Daily and KZSU are the only
groups receiving ASSU funding that do not bank
with the ASSU, according to Carey White, chair
man of the committee. Each year, the senate con
siders extension of the independent banking status,
White said.
The committee interviewed Shaddock to deter
mine whether The Daily was "acting in a manner
that was fiscally prudent," White said.
In addition, the committee wanted to know why
KZSU did not bank with the ASSU. White said
Wheeler told the committee that KZSU's current
system of banking with the University is more
convenient.
According to Shaddock, The Daily's FICA debt

stems from a Jan. 1, 1984, change in the federal tax
code. Prior to that date. The Daily had been ex
empt from FICA taxes based on its status as an
"educational institution." After Jan. 1, 1984,
however, only religious institutions remained ex
empt from the tax. Shaddock said.
The tax act, which funds the Social Security sys
tem, requires employers to deduct about 7 percent
in FICA taxes from the paychecks of employees
and to pay an extra sum, equivalent to about 7 per
cent of employee earnings, themselves, according
to Shaddock.
The Daily was not aware that it had to pay FICA
until it received a letter from the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) in late March of this year, Shaddock
said. The letter said The Daily had underpaid in
each of the four quarters of 1984, and that the
paper "had to pay within 10 days, or [the IRS]
would ... lay legal claim on the assets of The
Daily," Shaddock said.
The Daily paid its 1984 FICA-related debt to the
IRS in early April, Shaddock said. "We have a
reserve of money . . . which we were able to use to
pay the IRS.
"We have no benefactor or line of credit," Shad
dock said. "We, as any other business, need a
working-capital cushion to cover contingencies
such as this."

Back payments for the employees' share of
FICA since February 1985 will be deducted from
their paychecks this month, Shaddock said. In addi
tion, Shaddock said he has notified Wells Fargo,
the bank that handles The Daily's payroll, to begin
removing FICA from the paychecks of employees.
Prior to the notice from the IRS,
"communications with The Daily would have been
between Wells Fargo and the IRS," Shaddock said.
Shaddock says The Daily received only one
notice from Wells Fargo. The form letter, which
has been recovered recently from The Daily's busi
ness files, was addressed to the office manager of
The Daily's business department, but was never
given to then-Business Manager Tom Nelson,
Shaddock said.
That office manager "left the employment of
The Daily in June 1984," Shaddock said.
Although Shaddock said that the "primary
blame lies within these four walls (of The Daily),"
he said it is "still surprising" that Wells Fargo "only
notified us once and did not follow up in any way"
on its original letter.
The Daily's not paying any FICA after the
change in the law "would kind of stick out like a
sore thumb," Shaddock said. "If [Wells Fargo]
looked at us on a 'reasonableness' basis, they would
see we were not a religious organization."
