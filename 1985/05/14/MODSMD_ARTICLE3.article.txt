# SOSA modifies tactics
## Trustees meet today; civil disobedience near certainty 
### MARY YUH Editorial staff 
The first day of the May Board of Trustees meeting was
marked yesterday by increased protest, complaints of un
responsiveness and talk of civil disobedience from the
members of Stanford Out of South Africa (SOSA).
SOSA temporarily moved its sit-in from the Inner
Quad to Hoover Tower in an attempt to further pressure
the trustees to vote on total divestment of University
stock from companies doing business in South Africa.
According to SOSA's press release yesterday, the or
ganization has "mapped out a strategy for increasing pres
sure on the Board of Trustees," and has threatened to esc
alate its tactics if the trustees do not respond.
SOSA is devising a one-year plan for pressuring the
University into divestment, SOSA spokesman Steve Phil
lips said at yesterday's press conference. SOSA also may
announce a new demand today, he said.
"The main reason we are demonstrating today and to
morrow is that we really want the Board of Trustees to
vote (on total divestment) after eight years of stalling,"
Phillips said yesterday.
"At this point, SOSA does not call for civil dis
obedience. But we can't restrict the freedom of choice of
individuals. A lot of people are outraged at the Univer
sity," Phillips said.
Civil disobedience of some kind is planned for today,
according to a source who spoke on the condition that his
name be witheld.
According to Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington,
arrests will be made if the law is broken, even if the law
breaking protester is a senior faculty member. "There's
only one standard," Herrington explained.
SOSA members are angry that University President
Donald Kennedy met last week in Los Angeles with
David Gardner., the president of the University of Califor
nia system, and Bishop Desmond Tutu, the South African
anti-apartheid activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner,
without inviting a student representative, Phillips said.
"I think [Kennedy] went because students have made
[apartheid] a national issue. The fact that he went without
a student representative is very disappointing," Phillips
said.
The Coalition Against Apartheid had been working for
months with the Office of the President to try to arrange a
visit by Tutu to Stanford, according to SOSA's press
release.
Citing last Tuesday's forum with SOSA, Kennedy and
12 trustees, and the placement of total divestment on the
agenda of the board meeting, Derek Miyahara told a

crowd of approximately 300 students at yesterday's noon
rally in White Plaza, "We must keep these victories in
perspective. ... Our victories arc victories only as far as
they bring us closer to our goal of total divestment."
Elizabeth Enslin of the Coalition Against Apartheid
said: "Total divestment itself is not an end. . . . We must
struggle until we no longer have multi-national corpora
tions exploiting cheap labor. . . . We must put an end to
oppression of minorities and women."
Calling the forum "totally inadequate in terms of our
ultimate goal," Enslin suggested that neither Kennedy nor
the trustees displayed the open-mindedness they said they
would have. After SOSA presented its case for divestment
at the forum, Kennedy said that his views had been stated
in the previous day's Daily advertisement, Enslin said.
"If intelligent debate does not persuade [Kennedy to
support total divestment], we will find other means —
forceful, embarrassing and financially harmful means,"
Enslin said.
"The struggle for human liberation takes generations,"
Enslin said. "The longer the wait to take the students
seriously, the longer the wait to take the people of South
Africa seriously, the higher the price [the University will
pay]. . . financially, morally," Enslin said.
"The problems we (blacks) have in South Africa are the
same problems we have in East Palo Alto and are the
same as the problems we have right here at Stanford,"
said Omowale Satterwhite, a member of the East Palo Alto
City Council and a founder of the Black Student Union.
"We are politically oppressed. We are economically ex
ploited. We are under rules and regulations that control
us."
Divestment "is a means along the road to achieving the
goal of justice, equality and peace that we all struggle
for," Satterwhite said.
Chanting "Divest now. Divest now," the crowd of ap :
proximately 300 marched to Hoover Tower after the rally.
Once there, the protesters clapped and chanted, "Board
of Trustees, don't you know apartheid has to go" and,
"No business, we mean it, no business in South Africa,
for about 45 minutes before the crowd thinned to ap
proximately 60 people.
Trustees were meeting in committees yesterday,
reportedly inside Hoover. The full board meets today.
A number of uniformed and plainclothes police were
visible at Hoover Tower. According to Herrington. five or
six officers were in plainclothes and three to five were in
uniform.

The first day of the May Board of Trustees meeting was
marked yesterday by increased protest, complaints of un
responsiveness and talk of civil disobedience from the
members of Stanford Out of South Africa (SOSA).
SOSA temporarily moved its sit-in from the Inner
Quad to Hoover Tower in an attempt to further pressure
the trustees to vote on total divestment of University
stock from companies doing business in South Africa.
According to SOSA's press release yesterday, the or
ganization has "mapped out a strategy for increasing pres
sure on the Board of Trustees," and has threatened to esc
alate its tactics if the trustees do not respond.
SOSA is devising a one-year plan for pressuring the
University into divestment, SOSA spokesman Steve Phil
lips said at yesterday's press conference. SOSA also may
announce a new demand today, he said.
"The main reason we are demonstrating today and to
morrow is that we really want the Board of Trustees to
vote (on total divestment) after eight years of stalling,"
Phillips said yesterday.
"At this point, SOSA does not call for civil dis
obedience. But we can't restrict the freedom of choice of
individuals. A lot of people are outraged at the Univer
sity," Phillips said.
Civil disobedience of some kind is planned for today,
according to a source who spoke on the condition that his
name be witheld.
According to Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington,
arrests will be made if the law is broken, even if the law
breaking protester is a senior faculty member. "There's
only one standard," Herrington explained.
SOSA members are angry that University President
Donald Kennedy met last week in Los Angeles with
David Gardner., the president of the University of Califor
nia system, and Bishop Desmond Tutu, the South African
anti-apartheid activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner,
without inviting a student representative, Phillips said.
"I think [Kennedy] went because students have made
[apartheid] a national issue. The fact that he went without
a student representative is very disappointing," Phillips
said.
The Coalition Against Apartheid had been working for
months with the Office of the President to try to arrange a
visit by Tutu to Stanford, according to SOSA's press
release.
Citing last Tuesday's forum with SOSA, Kennedy and
12 trustees, and the placement of total divestment on the
agenda of the board meeting, Derek Miyahara told a

crowd of approximately 300 students at yesterday's noon
rally in White Plaza, "We must keep these victories in
perspective. ... Our victories arc victories only as far as
they bring us closer to our goal of total divestment."
Elizabeth Enslin of the Coalition Against Apartheid
said: "Total divestment itself is not an end. . . . We must
struggle until we no longer have multi-national corpora
tions exploiting cheap labor. . . . We must put an end to
oppression of minorities and women."
Calling the forum "totally inadequate in terms of our
ultimate goal," Enslin suggested that neither Kennedy nor
the trustees displayed the open-mindedness they said they
would have. After SOSA presented its case for divestment
at the forum, Kennedy said that his views had been stated
in the previous day's Daily advertisement, Enslin said.
"If intelligent debate does not persuade [Kennedy to
support total divestment], we will find other means —
forceful, embarrassing and financially harmful means,"
Enslin said.
"The struggle for human liberation takes generations,"
Enslin said. "The longer the wait to take the students
seriously, the longer the wait to take the people of South
Africa seriously, the higher the price [the University will
pay]. . . financially, morally," Enslin said.
"The problems we (blacks) have in South Africa are the
same problems we have in East Palo Alto and are the
same as the problems we have right here at Stanford,"
said Omowale Satterwhite, a member of the East Palo Alto
City Council and a founder of the Black Student Union.
"We are politically oppressed. We are economically ex
ploited. We are under rules and regulations that control
us."
Divestment "is a means along the road to achieving the
goal of justice, equality and peace that we all struggle
for," Satterwhite said.
Chanting "Divest now. Divest now," the crowd of ap :
proximately 300 marched to Hoover Tower after the rally.
Once there, the protesters clapped and chanted, "Board
of Trustees, don't you know apartheid has to go" and,
"No business, we mean it, no business in South Africa,
for about 45 minutes before the crowd thinned to ap
proximately 60 people.
