# Motorola: no sales to military, police
## 
### DAVID S. GOLDSTEIN Staff writer 
Motorola Corp., which for nearly a year has
been the most likely target for Stanford stock
divestment, has announced a policy change
stating it will no longer sell equipment to the
South African police.
In a Dec. 6 letter to the University Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility (C-IR),
Motorola President John Mitchell said his com
pany does not sell to the South African military,
but made two sales of replacement two-way
radios to the South African police since Novem
ber 1982. He did not say, however, whether
Motorola would sell to the police in the future.
But Motorola has now made such a state
ment. "It is now our policy not to sell equip
ment to the South African police," said a
Motorola spokesman who asked not to be iden
tified.
The source said the policy change stems from
New York City's recent demand that all its con

tractors — which includes Motorola — refrain
from selling to South African military or police.
He did not state whether threats of stockholder
divestment or nationwide student activism
against apartheid affected the decision, but a
recent New York Times article said most Amer
ican companies that change their policies re
garding South Africa cite economic factors —
rather than stockholder divestment threats — as
catalysts.
Nevertheless, pressure on the University to
divest itself of South Africa-linked stocks has
continued throughout the school year.
In October, students passed 2,045 to 485 a
referendum asking the University to divest of
Motorola stock "as soon as possible." This fol
lowed the C-IR's vote last year to support a
shareholder resolution asking Motorola to end
sales to the South African military and police
until apartheid is ended. The Board of Trustees
Special Committee on Investment Responsibil

ity accepted C-IR's recommendation.
The trustees abstained on the proxy vote,
citing their policy set in 1972 not to vote on
"any shareholder resolution involving social is
sues unless they conclude a company's activities
cause substantial injury."
But the trustees agreed Feb. 12 to divest of
the University's nearly $4.7 million worth of
Motorola stock if the Illinois-based firm sells to
the South African military or resumes sales to
the South African police.
In light of Motorola's announced policy
change, it is now more unlikely the University
will sell its Motorola stock unless the trustees
make a blanket divestment of all South Africa
linked stocks. But the trustees' conditional
agreement to divest was significant in that it
marked the first time the board ratified a divest
ment proposal of any type since the University
adopted an investment responsibility policy in
1977. William Massy, vice president for busi

ness and finance, has said Stanford has never
sold stock on moral grounds.
The trustees' conditional agreement to divest
came after the C-IR voted unanimously in Jan
uary to recommend the University divest itself
of Motorola stock if it were determined that
Motorola sells to the South African military or
police. Such sales strengthen the government's
apartheid rule and thus constitute a "social in
jury," the C-IR maintained.
C-IR member Mark Landesmann called
Motorola's policy change "a positive develop
ment," which "puts them on the same level" as
other companies in the University's portfolio.
Although Motorola is no longer "particularly
harmful" in relation to other companies whose
stock the University owns, Landesmann said,
"Ultimately, some very, very serious questions
have to be raised about [Motorola] in South
Africa.
"They're still supporting apartheid
by being in South Africa," he said.
The Motorola spokesman said his
company is also striving to better
comply with the Sullivan Principles, a
voluntary code of ethics developed

for companies operating with or in
South Africa. Arthur D. Little, a con
sulting firm, rated Motorola's compli
ance with the principles "111-A" in
1984, meaning the company needs to
become more active in bettering the
living standards of non-white South
African employees. The rating indi
cates Motorola "passed all basic re
quirements but received [a] low point
rating."

The Investor Responsibility Re
search Center, which Stanford and
several other universities established
in 1970 to gather information on
shareholder proxy controversies, said
Motorola met the Sullivan standards
in desegregation, minimum wages,
trade union rights, equal pay for
equal work and elimination of racial
discrimination in pay or benefits, but
failed to make satisfactory efforts in

black education, training and ad
vancement of black employees and
community development.
The Motorola spokesman said he
expects a top rating for Motorola this
year, reflecting the company's addi
tional programs for non-white stu
dent education, a reading
improvement project and interest
free loans to employees.
