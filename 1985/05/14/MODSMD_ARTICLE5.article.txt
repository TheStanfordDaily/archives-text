## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
BERKELEY — In a speech that UC-Berkeley
protesters hope will holster their demand for total
divestment of the University of California's stock in
companies that do business in South Africa, Bishop
Desmond Tutu yesterday praised students for their
demonstrations against apartheid.
More than 9,000 jammed UC-Berkeley's Greek
Theater to hear Tutu, the bishop of Johannesburg
who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his
criticism of South Africa's racist system of apart
heid. He is currently wrapping up a six-day tour of
California which included speeches at UCLA, UC-
Davis, the Civic Auditorium in San Francisco and
numerous churches, a presentation before a joint
session of the state legislature, and a meeting last
Thursday with University President Donald Kennedy
and David Gardner, the president of the UC sys
tem.
Tutu also gave his support to the anti-apartheid
protests at Stanford yesterday, scrawling "I do"
and his signature to the bottom of a prepared state
ment from Stanford Out of South Africa, according
to SOSA spokesman Steve Phillips.
Demonstrators, who have been sitting in on the
steps of UC-Berkeley's Sproul Hall since April 10,
hope that Tutu's appearance will help persuade the
UC Board of Regents to vote in favor of divest
ment when they meet later this week.

One protester said that he hopes Tutu's speech
will add "sustaining power and bring greater
credibility" to the dwindling movement at UC-
Berkeley.
Craig Anderson, a spokesman for The Daily
Californian. said about 100 protesters were ex
pected to sleep last night on the steps of Sproul
Hall, which they have renamed Stephen Biko Hall.
Late yesterday afternoon, close to 60 were sitting
in.
Organizers of the protest hope to escalate their
demonstrations again when the regents meet
Thursday. They plan to move the sit-in across
campus to Lawrence Laboratory, the site of the
meeting, and to barricade the regents inside the
building if their demand for total divestment of the
UC system's $2.4 billion worth of stock in compan
ies that do business in South Africa is not met, ac
cording to a Berkeley student sitting in front of
Sproul Hall yesterday.
Anderson said "thousands" are expected to
protest at the regents' meeting, and that a major
organizational meeting was going on late last night
to determine the exact course the renewed protest
would take.
Speaking with wit and charisma, Tutu yesterday
thanked student activists for their commitment to
end apartheid and condemned his country's racist
policies.
"I thank you verv. very much indeed for many,

many people who would have liked to have been
here themselves. I come to say, on behalf of those
people, thank you ... for saying that there are
some things more important than good grades. . . .
Thank you for saying we all belong to one family —
God's family," the 53-year-old bishop began.
"As God looks down on you today. He is saying
'Hey, have you seen my children in Berkeley?
Don't you think they're something?' " Tutu said.
"You are always on the forefront — whatever is
being done today at Berkeley is being done
everywhere else tomorrow."
He went on to say that blacks and whites must
work together to bring a peaceful end to apartheid.
"The only way we can get out of the [depths] of
human bondage and degradation is to go up to
gether. . . . That is how God works things out. Until
blacks are free in South Africa, nobody is free," he
said.
Tutu, who has twice had his passport confiscated
by the South African government, stressed that he
is in the United States to attend his daughter's
graduation from the University of Kentucky. To
encourage divestment explicitly would be
treasonous, and Tutu could face 20 years in prison
or death.
Tutu was joined by Berkeley Mayor Eiugcne
"Gus" Newport, musicians Holly Near and Bobby
McFarren, and a spokeswoman for Bay Area
African students in calling for divestment.
