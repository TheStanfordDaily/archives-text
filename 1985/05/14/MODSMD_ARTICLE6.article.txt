FBI foils plot to assassinate Gandhi
WASHINGTON — The FBI has thwarted a plot by Indian Sikh ter
rorists in the United States to assassinate Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
during his state visit here in June, FBI Director William Webster said
yesterday.
Webster said the alleged plot also contained plans to murder Bhajan
Lai, chief minister of the Indiana state of Haryana, who had been under
going treatment at the Louisiana State University Eye Center in New
Orleans.
According to an FBI affidavit filed in the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Louisiana, the purported plot against Lai was un
covered by Special Agent Thomas Norris, "acting in an undercover
capacity," who was told by one of the accused that "his group wanted to
assassinate an Indian official who is in New Orleans, Louisiana, for tem
porary medical treatment."
The affidavit was made public by FBI headquarters here.
There were no details on how the bureau unraveled the alleged plot
against Gandhi, whose mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, was as
sassinated by Sikh members of her personal bodyguard last year. Bureau
spokesman Manuel Marquez said "there isn't any more I can say at this
point."
Gandhi is scheduled to visit the United States June 12-15 and to meet
with President Reagan at the White House on June 12, according to
White House officials.
Pope reaffirms all-male priesthood
UTRECHT, Netherlands — Pope John Paul II yesterday delivered a
firm message to rebels in the Dutch Roman Catholic hierarchy that he
would not ease the Vatican's ban on women in the priesthood.
He also went to the World Court, the judicial arm of the United Na
tions, where he issued a ringing denunciation of South Africa's apartheid
system of racial separation.
Public controversy over John Paul's visit to the Netherlands, the first
by a pope, was muted yesterday. Protests in The Hague, where he spent
most of the day, were scattered and generally peaceful, in contrast to
Sunday's street battles between radical youths and riot police in this uni
versity city.
In his greeting to the pontiff. Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers dealt di
rectly with the rebellion by liberals in the Dutch church.
At his official residence in The Hague, Lubbers, himself a Catholic,
told John Paul the Vatican must "build bridges and restore confidence"
in the Netherlands.
"To be quite frank, simply the word Rome makes some people uneasy
if not downright suspicious," the prime minister said.
Many Dutch Catholics dissent from the Vatican's ban on priestly mar
riage, abortion and artificial birth control, and ordination of women.
The pontiff used an ecumenical meeting on the third day of his visit to
address the ban on women in the priesthood, rejecting the assertion of a
Protestant leader that it was a "painful situation" that put the Catholic
church out of step with society.
In a speech text distributed at the closed-door session and to reporters
earlier, the pontiff insisted that "faithfulness to the word of God" for
bids the ordination of women.
He omitted several sections of the text when he spoke, including the
one on women, church officials said later.
In early afternoon, he went to the World Court.
Standing before the court's 15 judges at the lectern from which
lawyers plead their cases, the pontiff attacked "discrimination — in law
or in fact — on the basis of race, origin, color, culture, sex or religion."
"Hence, no system of apartheid or separate development will ever be
acceptable as a model for the relations between peoples or races,"he
said, speaking in English.
Kohl's party defeated in election
BONN, West Germany — Chancellor Helmut Kohl says his ruling
party suffered a "major defeat" in elections in West Germany's most
populous state, and the victors said the vote reflected dissatisfaction with
high unemployment.
The voting in North Rhine-Westfalia, which with 12.6 million voters
has a third of the country's electorate, on Sunday was the most impor
tant state election since Kohl won a majority nationwide for his coalition
of Christian Democrats and Free Democrats over the Social Democratic
Party two years ago.
Gov. Johannes Rau, a possible candidate for chancellor in 1987, led
the Social Democrats to victory. They won 52.1 percent of the vote, ex
panding the absolute majority they first captured in 1980. Kohl's party
plummeted to 36.5 percent, its worst showing ever in the state.
The Social Democrats won 125 seats in the state parliament. Kohl's
party took 88 seats.
"This is without a doubt a major defeat for the CDU (Christian Dem
ocratic Union)," Kohl said on national television.
The chancellor said he thought low voter turnout — 75.3 percent
compared to 80 percent in the state five years ago — took its toll on the
Christian Democrats.
"I think we still have good chances for 1987," when the next national
elections are to be held, said Kohl.
But Rau said he thought the vote was a slap at Kohl's policies, espe
cially his government's failure to reduce unemployment of 9.6 percent
nationwide and 11 percent in North Rhine-Westphalia.
India arrests 2,000 in terrorist hunt
NEW DELHI, India — Authorities reported more than 2,000 arrests
after a weekend wave of bombings that killed or wounded hundreds of
people. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi pledged yesterday to toughen In
dia's already harsh anti-terrorist laws.
A bomb disguised as a camera was found at the Home Ministry and
was defused.
Most commercial activity in the capital was halted by a strike called by
the opposition Janata Party to protest the bombings, which have been
blamed on terrorists of the Sikh religious sect.
In his pledge to strengthen a nti-terrorist laws and give police more
power, Gandhi said: "We will fight terrorism with all our strength. We
must not let terrorism be a scar in our democracy. Violence has no place
in a society." The weekend explosions in northern India, most of which
were caused by booby-trap bombs placed in transistor radios, killed at
least 85 people and and wounded 225.
Gandhi charged in his remarks to Parliament that "a foreign hand"
was actively promoting Sikh terrorism.
He did not identify the foreign power, but his government has fre
quently accused Pakistan of training and arming Sikh separatists who
support either more autonomy or complete independence for Punjab
state, where members of the sect are the majority.

BRADFORD, England — Police said yesterday that smoke bombs
and fireworks were thrown during a soccer match where a fire swiftly en
gulfed an old wooden grandstand and killed 53 people.

tal and authorities said many of them had burns that will require plastic
surgery.
West Yorkshire County Council, meanwhile, said it warned the Brad
ford City socccr club in writing 10 months ago that the 79-year-old tim
ber grandstand was a fire hazard, but said no action was taken to correct
the alleged dangerous conditions. The club's chairman denied receiving
any warning.
In Parliament. Home Secretary Leon Brittan, the Cabinet minister in
charge of safety and police matters, announced a judicial inquiry into the
fire, with orders to investigate fire safety and crowd-control measures at
all 92 soccer stadiums in the country. »
