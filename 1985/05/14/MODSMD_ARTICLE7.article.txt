# Fire spreads to 60 houses
## Police wage 'war' with MOVE 
### 
PHILADELPHIA — Police trying to evict
members of the radical group MOVE from their
fortified rowhouse dropped a bomb on the building
yesterday, and a fire erupted, spreading to up to 60
houses before being brought under control.
The bomb was dropped around 5:30 p.m. during
a day-long siege in which police also used water can
nons and tear gas and traded gunfire with those
inside.
The flames had driven four armed MOVE mem
bers into the alley behind their house, forcing
police to hold back firefighters as the blaze spread,
Mayor Wilson Goode said at a news conference.
"What we have out there is war," Goode said.
He said one of the four, a woman, was captured,
and the other three "still are loose in the alleyway."
The others may have been hiding in a labyrinth
of tunnels that police believe MOVE members
constructed in the backyard and alley, said Leo
Brooks, the city's managing director.
The fire involved 50 to 60 homes and was
brought under control at 11:40 p.m., said Fire
Commissioner William Richmond.
Two children were carried alive from the scene
by police around 7:30 p.m., to cheers from several
hundred onlookers who also taunted officers with
chants of "Murder! Murder!"
One child was caught leaving the house, Goode
said, adding that nothing was known of the fate of
two or three other children believed to be living in
the house. Authorities earlier had said as many as
10 children lived there.

It was not immediately clear what started the
fire, although it began after police brought in a
helicopter that dropped a bomb. The device was
meant to blow a hole in the house so police could
lob more tear gas inside, said an officer at the scene
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The New York Times quoted unidentified police
officers in today's editions as calling the object an
"incendiary device."
In an interview on ABC-TV's "Nightline,"
Goode said the bomb may have started the fire, but
added that there is some speculation that the
people inside the house may have started the fire
themselves.
"I don't know at this point and 1 think that based
upon what I do have I front of me, however, that
the chances of the fire having been started by police
is probably better than 50-50," Goode said.
Officers decided to let the MOVE house burn to
destroy a log-reinforced bunker that members con
structed inside the front of the house. Police Com
missioner Gregore Sambor said.
The inhabitants, who espouse a back-to-nature
philosophy, had refused early yesterday to leave
the house under an eviction order from police, who
had surrounded the house and evacuated about
200 neighborhood homes Sunday.
A 90-minute gun battle erupted after MOVE'S
refusal. Group members said they would not leave
until nine members imprisoned for a 1978 shootout
that left one police officer dead and several
wounded were released.
Police said they decided to move in on the two
story west Philadelphia house after obtaining arrest

warrants Friday for four adults believed to be living
there. The warrants accused them of harassing
neighborhood residents, possessing explosives and
disorderly conduct.
Minutes after the bomb exploded, smoke poured
from the house. The fire spread to nearby houses,
and authorities let it burn almost 90 minutes before
turning on water cannons and calling in fire trucks.
Police kept firefighters from entering the area
because MOVE members were shooting from the
house, fire Lt. Tom Brennan said.
Flaming ash fell throughout the evacuated four
block area. Officers forced their way into houses,
battering down doors and shooting off locks.
One of the children carried from the scene, a 9-
year-old boy, was taken to Children's Hospital's
emergency room with second-degee burns, and
hospital workers were warned to expect one or two
more, spokeswoman Shirley Bonnem said.
A spokeswoman at Misericordia Hospital said a
female MOVE member had been taken there, but
she was unable to provide an identity or condition.
The fire followed hours of inaction as
sharpshooters were poised spread-eagle on sur
rounding roofs, and 150 helmeted officers
regrouped after unsuccessfully trying to serve the
eviction notice.
Goode said earlier that police would not leave
until the house was emptied.
"We intend to evict from the house. ... We in
tend to take control of the house by any means ne
cessary," Goode said. "1 am totally convinced the
group is bent on violent confrontation. ... 1 pray to
Almighty God the children will not be hurt."
