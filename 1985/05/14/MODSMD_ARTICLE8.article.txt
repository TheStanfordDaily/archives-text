# GE pleads guilty, fined $1,040,000

PHILADELPHIA â€” General
Electric Co., the nation's sixth-largest
defense contractor, pleaded guilty
yesterday to defrauding the Air Force
of $800,000 on a nuclear-warhead
contract and was fined $1,040,000,
the maximum penalty.
GE's plea means it could be barred
for up to three years from bidding on
new contracts, said U.S. Attorney
Edward Dennis.
The Air Force did not immediately
indicate what action, if any, would be
taken against GE, which performed
the work at two area plants.
U.S. District Judge Louis Bechtle
said the maximum penalty was "fully
and clearly appropriate here" be
cause the nation is dependent on GE
"just like a newborn baby is depen
dent on its mother."
GE pleaded guilty to 108 counts of
making false statements and claims
for payment to the Air Force to
recover cost overruns on a $47 mil
lion contract to refurbish the
Minuteman Mark-12A intercon
tinental ballistic missile. The plea
came on what was to be the opening
day of jury selection for trial on the
charges.
The work, according to an indict
ment returned against GE on March
26, involved research, development,
engineering and other services for the
Minuteman re-entry systems done at
GE plants in Philadelphia and subur
ban King of Prussia between June 22,
1980, and April 19, 1983.
The indictment accused GE
managers of altering employee time

cards, having employees submit blank
cards and filling them out themselves
and transferring non-reimbursable
costs to other contracts.
After the indictment, Air Force
Secretary Verne Orr suspended GE
from bidding on any new defense
contracts, but he later limited the
suspension to the company's Re
entry Systems Division, which was in
volved in the alleged mischarges.
The actions made GE the largest
defense contractor ever suspended
from doing business with the govern
ment and the largest charged in a
criminal indictment with defrauding
the military.
"The evidence would show higher
management was blueprinting the in
tentional mischarging being done by
lower-level managers," Assistant
U.S. Attorney Ewald Zittlau told the
court yesterday.
GE attorney Henry Ruth told Be
chtle that GE, which had originally
pleaded innocent, changed its posi
tion after former GE Unit Manager
Roy Baessler, 40, of Topsfield, Mass.,
admitted intentional mischarging.
In 1984, GE was the nation's No. 6
defense contractor, receiving con
tracts worth $4.51 billion,
Ruth said the corporation, which
has also agreed to reimburse the
$800,000 in overcharges, will argue
before the Defense Department that
the wrongdoing took place five years
ago and that the company has since
instituted controls to prevent further
wrongdoing.
