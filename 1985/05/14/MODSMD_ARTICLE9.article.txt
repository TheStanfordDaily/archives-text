# Denies training Lebanese involved
## CIA statement 
### 
WASHINGTON — The
Central Intelligence Agency
denied yesterday it had trained
any Lebanese forces involved in a
March 8 car-bombing in Beirut
that left more than 80 people dead
and 200 wounded.
However, the denial did not rule
out the possibility of some other
connection between the CIA and
the group that carried out the op
eration.
According to an account in Sun
day's editions of The Washington
Post, a CIA-trained and
-supported counterterrorist unit in
Lebanon, acting without CIA au
thorization, was responsible for
the incident, which took place
outside the residence of
Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, a
militant Shiite leader.
The account said Fadlallah was
believed responsible for terrorist
attacks on U.S. installations.
Breaking a 24-hour silence on
the report, CIA spokeswoman
Patti Volz said, "The CIA never
conducted any training of
Lebanese security forces related to
the events described" in the Post
article.
The Post story said the CIA and
the Reagan administration quickly
canceled the counterterrorism op
eration after the bombing for fear
the alleged U.S. ties to the group
might be disclosed.
A New York Times account
yesterday of the same incident said

the Lebanese unit had been
"working with" the CIA.
Volz' statement said the CIA
had no foreknowledge of the
"counterterrorism action" and
added that the agency also
"scrupulously observes" its obli
gation to keep congressional intel
ligence oversight committees in
formed of its activities.
On Capitol Hill, two members
of the House Judiciary Committee
introduced a resolution directing
the CIA to provide Congress with
documents and other information
about its counterterrorist activities
in the Middle East.
"In an area as volatile as the
Middle East, we don't need to set
loose foreign proxies to participate
in ill-conceived operations," said
Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.)
in a statement.
"Where is the wisdom in financ
ing hit squads in the Middle East,
which is already a hair trigger,"
she said.
Introducing the resolution with
Schroeder was Rep. Don Edwards
(D-Calif.)
Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), vice
chairman of the Senate Intelli
gence Committee, said he has
begun a series of inquiries about
the Post article.
"If the story is accurate, it
would be all the more reason to
find out why we don't have better
plans for combating terrorism,"
Leahy said.
