# Stress at Stanford:
## Career choice dilemmas 
### Alejandro Martinez 
This is third in a series of three articles on
stress at Stanford.
It has been said that in every human action
there is an element of risk. This seems particu
larly true when it comes to making career
choices. There are many unknowns when
making such decisions, and even the best deci
sion making models cannot control for every
factor. Making a career decision can be one of
the biggest stressors that confront Stanford stu
dents. But what is it exactly that makes is stress
ful?
One reason career decision-making is
stressful lies in the fact that this choice is fre
quently given disproportionate importance. It is
a question that we are asked to answer begin
ning in childhood. Most of us can still remem
ber that innocent question, "What do you want
to be when you grow up?" Yet this question
eventually takes on a powerful symbolism for
us. Making a career choice becomes
synonomous with being a grown up, being
serious, being sure, being committed. The play
ful, fun dimension of "what do you want to be
when you grow up" is forgotten. Thus, we
come to believe that the question has one an
swer and that we must know the right answer. A
tremendous amount of energy is spent trying to
find the right career and avoiding the wrong
one.
To some extent or another, we are all afraid to
make mistakes. Frequently our energy is
focused on how to avoid "wrong" decisions
and much less attention is given to deciding
what really has meaning to us. Sometimes we
try to avoid wrong decisions by repeating a deci
sion enough times to the point everyone comes
to believe it to be true. At other times we try to
use our imagined telepathic powers to guess
the right answer from others. In other words,
we try choosing a career that we guess will make
our parents, friends, and teachers proud.

Sometimes, we try to avoid choosing the
wrong career by continually postponing the
decision. We avoid burning any bridge. We
keep all options open. This strategy often takes
the concept of a broad education to its limit. An
other frequently used strategy for dealing with
the not-knowing-the-right-answer dilemma is
making decisions, but not having any long-term
commitment to them. Thus we commit to one
profession and then another and another, on a
regularly changing basis.
It seems that there are two extreme ways that
we use to deal with the stresses of a career deci
sion. One is choosing as early as possible, and
living with the security of having an answer. The
other is never quite choosing, but having the se
curity that if the "right" answer comes along,
we will recognize it and take it. For a few indi
viduals, the first option is a truly positive strat
egy. We all know of at least one person who
wanted to be a "doctor" ever since he or she
could remember. Indeed for these individuals
this "career" takes on an uninterrupted life
long direction. But for many others, these early
career decisions can bring a tremendous sense
of failure. Having chosen their life long goals,
they may be frustrated by inner limiting factors
such as intellectual ability, aptitude, level of
confidence, amount of perseverance, kinds of
and levels of skill. External limiting factors such
as accessibility of opportunities, competition,
entrance requirements, financial resources,
economic conditions may also prevent reaching
their career goals. Denied their first choice of a
career, individuals in this situation frequently
feel that they will fail in future career choices as
well.
Those who choose early out of fear rather
than out of interest often find that while they
are competent to do the job, in other respects
they find little satisfaction and many feelings of
emptiness and stagnation.
