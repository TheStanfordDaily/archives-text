# Stress at Stanford:
## Career choice dilemmas 
### Alejandro Martinez 
This is third in a series of three articles on
stress at Stanford.
It has been said that in every human action
there is an element of risk. This seems particu
larly true when it comes to making career
choices. There are many unknowns when
making such decisions, and even the best deci
sion making models cannot control for every
factor. Making a career decision can be one of
the biggest stressors that confront Stanford stu
dents. But what is it exactly that makes is stress
ful?
One reason career decision-making is
stressful lies in the fact that this choice is fre
quently given disproportionate importance. It is
a question that we are asked to answer begin
ning in childhood. Most of us can still remem
ber that innocent question, "What do you want
to be when you grow up?" Yet this question
eventually takes on a powerful symbolism for
us. Making a career choice becomes
synonomous with being a grown up, being
serious, being sure, being committed. The play
ful, fun dimension of "what do you want to be
when you grow up" is forgotten. Thus, we
come to believe that the question has one an
swer and that we must know the right answer. A
tremendous amount of energy is spent trying to
find the right career and avoiding the wrong
one.
To some extent or another, we are all afraid to
make mistakes. Frequently our energy is
focused on how to avoid "wrong" decisions
and much less attention is given to deciding
what really has meaning to us. Sometimes we
try to avoid wrong decisions by repeating a deci
sion enough times to the point everyone comes
to believe it to be true. At other times we try to
use our imagined telepathic powers to guess
the right answer from others. In other words,
we try choosing a career that we guess will make
our parents, friends, and teachers proud.

Sometimes, we try to avoid choosing the
wrong career by continually postponing the
decision. We avoid burning any bridge. We
keep all options open. This strategy often takes
the concept of a broad education to its limit. An
other frequently used strategy for dealing with
the not-knowing-the-right-answer dilemma is
making decisions, but not having any long-term
commitment to them. Thus we commit to one
profession and then another and another, on a
regularly changing basis.
It seems that there are two extreme ways that
we use to deal with the stresses of a career deci
sion. One is choosing as early as possible, and
living with the security of having an answer. The
other is never quite choosing, but having the se
curity that if the "right" answer comes along,
we will recognize it and take it. For a few indi
viduals, the first option is a truly positive strat
egy. We all know of at least one person who
wanted to be a "doctor" ever since he or she
could remember. Indeed for these individuals
this "career" takes on an uninterrupted life
long direction. But for many others, these early
career decisions can bring a tremendous sense
of failure. Having chosen their life long goals,
they may be frustrated by inner limiting factors
such as intellectual ability, aptitude, level of
confidence, amount of perseverance, kinds of
and levels of skill. External limiting factors such
as accessibility of opportunities, competition,
entrance requirements, financial resources,
economic conditions may also prevent reaching
their career goals. Denied their first choice of a
career, individuals in this situation frequently
feel that they will fail in future career choices as
well.
Those who choose early out of fear rather
than out of interest often find that while they
are competent to do the job, in other respects
they find little satisfaction and many feelings of
emptiness and stagnation.

At the other extreme, those who are reluctant
to make a choice face other issues. On the posi
tive side, some, by delaying their career deci
sion, discover in themselves a richness of skills,
aptitude, and potential. Yet there are at least as
many individuals whose reluctance to make a
commitment keeps them in a constant state of
self-questioning. They do not trust their feelings
of satisfaction or degree of interest in what they
are doing now because they live in fear of set
tling for the wrong career. There is a tendency
for these individuals to be so preoccupied with
the future that they neglect to enjoy the pres
ent.
There is another set of factors that can in
crease the degree of stress one feels regarding a
career choice. These have to do with the natural
tension that exists between career and other life
goals or between achievement needs and per
sonal commitments. Individuals are often faced
with the demands and pressures of a career
versus the rewards of relationships, friendship,
personal time, and a particular life style.
Sometimes choosing a career can mean leaving
a familiar setting, friends, a love relationship, a
personal network of support, or a way of life.
Sometimes we make careeer choices because
we feel pressure that the time has come to make
that choice. Students that are approaching
graduation are particularly susceptible to this.
There is an unspoken edict that by this time we
are supposed to know what we want to do with
our lives.
It is difficult not to feel the pressures and
demands involved in making a career decision.

The pressures are real, have real consequences,
and in one way or another have to be faced by
each of us. Yet there are some things that one
can do to moderate the degree of stress experi
enced in the decision process.
For example, it would be immensely helpful if
some time were set aside to sort out life goals
that have been made for us, from those that we
can truly choose for ourselves. We also need to
be aware and trust in the values that provide the
motivation for action, direction and are consis
tent with our self view. This self understanding
can better define what we desire from a career,
what we do not want, and what is honestly
negotiable. It can separate our career interests
from brief career infatuations and hobbies, or it
can help transform our hobbies into careers.
It also helps to recognize that choosing a
career is not a one-time decision, but a series of
decisions that either affirm the direction being
pursued, or suggest new directions. In reality,
few of us are suited for just one profession. The
only issue is the kind of trade-offs we are willing
to pursue. Even people showing a strong com
mitment to their professions periodically reaf
firm this choice by giving up others that
continue to be presented to them.
Finally, it is extremely important to recognize
that who we are is not the same as what we do.
While there is overlap, what we do can only par
tially define who we are. Thus the most impor
tant question in career choice is not what we
do, but how it will help us move in the direction
of who we want to be.
