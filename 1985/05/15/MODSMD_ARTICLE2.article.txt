# Health care decisions important for graduates
## 
### JOHN DORMAN M. D 
Graduating students are of
ten faced with the task of fin
ding a health care provider for
the first time. Before that, par
ents made the decision or the
student came to Cowell. So
how does one choose a
health care provider?
Most students will be best
served by finding a "primary
care physician" (PCP). You
would ordinarily see this per
son for all your medical prob
lems, and then be referred to
other specialists as indicated.
The PCP may be a general or
family practitioner, an inter
nist, or in some cases, even a
gynecologist who is willing to
be a primary care physician.
Another option is to go with
a "fee-for-service" system
(where you get billed each
time for services) or a prepaid
system like Kaiser or Take
Care. There are pros and cons
of each system.
Usually care from the
prepaid system is less expen
sive than fee for service, but
many people complain about

long waits and impersonal
service. It is possible to get
excellent care at reasonable
cost in such a system, but you
may have to try out different
practitioners, then insist on
seeing the same person each
time. Cowell actually operates
as such a prepaid system and
should be used in a similar
fashion.
A fee-for-service system
allows you to see whomever
you want. Unfortunately, this
approach often means going
to a dermatologist for your
acne, to an otolaryngologist
(ENT person) for your ear in
fection, to a gynecologist for
vaginitis, etc. While the medi
cal care you get in this fashion
may be technically excellent,
most physicians feel that you
— the whole person — are
best served by seeing the
same primary care physician
regularly; thus providing con
tinuity of care. Development
of such a relationship is more
rewarding for the doctor, too!
Whether you go with the
prepaid of fee-for-service ap

proach, find a PCP first. Some
systems, like Take Care, re
quire that you do this.
How do you get the right
person? Probably your rela
tionship with the individual
practitioner is more important
in this decision than their par
ticular area of expertise. An
exception to this is the care of
a person who has a chronic or
serious problem; in this in
stance your best PCP might
well be a specialist in the area
of concern.
How do you evaluate the
quality of your medical care?
If your are on 2 or 3 medicines
per day, if you get an injection
every time you go to the doc
tor, or if expensive tests are
ordered for minimal
symptoms, you may need to
look elsewhere. If your com
munication with your doctor
is poor, consider changing. If
surgery, for example, is rec
ommended, and you don't
think you need it, ask for a
second opinion. Most doctors
who are competent won't

mind — a second opinion will
usually confirm the original
diagnosis. If the second
opinion is very different,
there may be more than one
way of approaching the prob
lem.
Remember, though, that
doctors are human, too.
Don't change doctors just be
cause he or she cannot deter
mine exactly what the matter
is on the first visit, or even if
he or she makes a mistake, if
they're honest about it.
Respect someone who says,
"I don't know."
More detail on finding the
right physician and how to the
use the medical care system
in general may be found in
the book "Take Care of Your
self, A Consumer's Guide to
Medical Care" by Vickery and
Fries.
