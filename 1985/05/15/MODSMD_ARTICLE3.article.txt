# Reduce cancer risks through good nutrition
## 
### 
In recent years, a number of dietary
constituents have been linked to the
occurrence of cancer. Although no
concrete dietary advice can be given
that will guarantee prevention of any
specific cancer, The American Cancer
Society believes that there is sufficient
inferential information to make in
terim recommendations that are likely
to provide some measure of reducing
cancer risk:
Avoid obesity.
That obese people are at risk of cer
tain cancers has been demonstrated.
In a study conducted by The American
Cancer Society, marked increases in
cancers of the uterus, gallbladder, kid
ney, stomach, colon and breast were
associated with obesity. Therefore, for
people who are obese, weight reduc
tion may be one way to lower cancer
risk.
Cut down on total fat intake.
Accumulating evidence implies that
excessive fat intake increases the
chance of developing cancers of the
breast, colon and prostate. Americans
consume about 40 percent of total
calories as fat. A decrease in the
amount of fat we consume to 30 per
cent of total calories has been sugges
ted in a report of the National
Academy of Sciences. Moderation in
the consumption of fats, oils and
foods rich in fats is advised.
Eat more high fiber foods, such as
whole grain cereals, fruits and
vegetables.
Fiber is a term describing many food
components that are not readily

digested in the human intestinal tract.
These substances are contained in
whole grains and fruits and
vegetables. Agreement on fiber's role
in cancer prevention is not universal.
There is a large body of evidence that
suggests colon cancer is low in
populations who live on a diet of
largely unrefined food high in fiber.
However, many believe that since
diets high in fiber are likely to be low
in fat, these lowfat diets may play a
more prominent role in lowering can
cer risk than high fiber intake.
Include foods rich in vitamins A and C
in the daily diet.
A number of studies indicate that
foods rich in carotene, or vitamin A,
may lower the risk of cancers of the
larynx, esophagus and lung. Examples
of foods rich in carotene are carrots,
tomatoes, spinach, apricots, peaches
and cantaloupes. Excessive vitamin A
in the form of supplements is not rec
ommended because of possible
toxicity.
People whose diets are rich in ascor
bic acid (vitamin C), i.e., those con
suming diets high in fruits and
vegetables, are less likely to get can
cer, particularly of the stomach and
esophagus. It is still uncertain whether
it is vitamin C itself or other constitu
ents of the vitamin C-containing fruits
and vegetables that exert the protec
tive effect.
Include cruciferous vegetables, such
as cabbage, broccoli, brussels sprouts,
kohlrabi and cauliflower in the diet.
Cruciferous vegetables belong to

the mustard family, whose plants have
flowers with four leaves in the pattern
of a cross. Studies have suggested that
consumption of these vegetables may
reduce the risk of cancer, particularly
of the gastrointestinal and respiratory
tracts. Tests have also revealed that in
clusion of cruciferous vegetables in
the diet may be highly effective in the
prevention of chemically induced can
cer.
Be moderate in consumption of al
coholic beverages.
Heavy drinkers of alcohol,
especially those who are also cigarette
smokers, are at unusually high risk for
cancers of the oral cavity, larynx and
esophagus. Alcohol abuse can also
result in cirrhosis, which may
sometimes lead to liver cancer.
Be moderate in consumption of salt
cured, smoked and nitrite-cured foods.
Conventionally smoked foods such
as hams, some varieties of sausage,
fish and so forth, absorb some of the
tars that arise from incomplete com
bustion. These tars contain numerous
carcinogens that are similar chemically
to the carcinogenic tars in tobacco
smoke. The risks may apply primarily
to conventionally smoked meats and
fish. The food processing industry is
now using a "liquid smoke" that is
thought to be less hazardous.
There is limited inferential evidence
that salt-cured or pickled foods may
increase the risk of stomach and esop
hageal cancer. In parts of the world
where nitrate and nitrite are prevalent
in food and water, as in Colombia, or

where cured and pickled foods are
common in the diet, such as in Japan
and China, stomach and esophageal
cancers are common. There is good
chemical evidence that nitrates and
nitrites may be human carcinogens.
Nitrite has been employed tradition
ally in meat preservation, where it acts
as a preventive against botulism (food
poisoning) and improves the color and
flavor of meats. The U.S. Department
of Agriculture and the American meat
industry already have substantially
decreased the amount of nitrite in
prepared meats and are searching for
improved methods of meat preserva
tion.
The following substances or dietary
practices have received much atten
tion and are therefore reviewed, but
no recommendations are made at this
time. All are under investigation.
Food additives
Various chemicals are added to
foods to improve color and flavor, and
to prevent spoilage. Some have been
found to cause cancer in animals and
have been banned. Several others are
thought to be protective against car
cinogens. Knowledge about the possi
ble cancer risks or benefits of food
additives is insufficient to warrant a re
commendation for or against their
use.
Vitamin E
There is no evidence that vitamin E
prevents cancer in humans. While vi
tamin E is an antioxidant, and an
tioxidants may prevent some cancers
in animals, more research is
needed before the role of vita
min E in human cancer pre
vention can be assessed.
Selenium
Although there is evidence
that selenium, a trace ele
ment, may offer protection
against some cancers, this
evidence is much too limited
to justify a recommendation
that selenium intake be in
creased. Because of the po
tential hazard of selenium
poisoning, the medically un
supervised use of selenium as
a food supplement cannot be
recommended.
Artificial sweeteners
At high levels, saccharin has
been shown to cause bladder
cancer in rats. Epidemiologic
studies offer no clear evidence
for an increase in risk of blad
der cancer among people who
are moderate users of this ar
tificial sweetener. Of possible
concern is the consumption of
saccharin by children and
pregnant women. The long
term consequences of this
possible risk cannot be
predicted from current
epidemiologic data. New non
caloric sweeteners are now
entering the market. Their
long-term effects have not yet
been studied in humans.
Coffee
Evidence about coffee as a
risk factor in human cancer is
inconclusive. Although some
epidemiologic studies impl
icate high intake of coffee in
bladder and pancreas cancer,
others fail to make such a con
nection. Available information
does not suggest a recommen
dation against its moderate
use. There is no indication
that caffeine, which is a natu

ral component of both coffee
and tea, is a risk in human can
cer.
Meat and fish cooked at high
temperatures, such as by
frying or broiling
Recent studies have demon
strated that the cooking of
meat and fish at high tempera
tures such as by frying or
broiling gives rise to a number
of potent mutagens (agents
causing genetic changes) in
bacteria, and some of them
have induced cancers in
animal tests. This subject is
now being investigated in
several laboratories.
Cholesterol
Although cholesterol is con
sidered to be a risk factor for
heart or blood vessel disease,
there is little evidence that a
high cholesterol intake or a
high cholesterol level in the
blood also poses the risk of
cancer. Evidence relating low
blood cholesterol to human
cancer is inconclusive.
An optimal diet cannot yet
be defined. However, there is
abundant evidence that the
usual American diet is not op
timal, and this is adequate rea
son to recommend
modification. Current dietary
recommendations were
developed to prevent the oc
currence of nutritional
deficiency disease in the 1930s
and 19405. They have been
largely successful. New infor
mation about diet and cancer,
hypertension, obesity,
diabetes, etc. leads to sensible
and consistent dietary recom
mendations to moderate the
dietary practices of most
Americans.
