# Women—the stronger sex?
## 
### HARVEY WEINSTEIN M. D 
In recent years, we have seen the emergence
of a new physical problem for women — the
phenomenon of eating disorders. The in
cidence appears to have increased dramatically
over the last 10 years and most striking has been
the recognition of bulimia as a major problem
for scores of college women. Although it ap
pears that the causes of anorexia pervosa and
bulimia are best understood as being multifac
torial in nature with developmental, biological
and cultural factors all playing a part, it is inter
esting to conjecture whether eating disorders
(which are found predominantly in women) are
the current equivalent of a "woman's disease"
found through the centuries. Some feminist
authors feel that eating disorders may represent
women's current attempt to defy societal expec
tations by proclaiming their independence in
this way.
For centuries, women have been portrayed
and treated by Western society as the weaker
sex. Seen as decorative objects to be cared for,
worshipped and at the same time derided,
women have been passive and silent. Given the
position of not being allowed to express
opinion; having to swallow dissent, what did
women do with their angry feelings?
The literature of medicine is filled with des
criptions dating from ancient Rome and Arabic
writings of women suffering from strange il
lnesses. These sicknesses were described as fits
and swoons, and were ascribed by the ancient
physicians as diseases of the womb. The uterus
was thought to wander or to produce the equiv
alent of semen which, if suppressed would
travel though the body — both of these
phenomena could result in these peculiarly
female diseases.
What characterizes these descriptions, is that
they were all written by male physicians about
women patients. The cures though the cen
turies were quite varied, but most involved the
male physicians carrying out genital manipula
tion (e.g., massage) of one form or another.
Eventually, the illness became known as hys
teria and took on protean manifestations —
seizures, paralysis, blindness, etc. After the
19205, when hysteria was well described by
Freud and a psychodynamic explanation of
fered, the disease seemed to wane in incidence.
For awhile, nothing emerged to take its place.

Recent research has suggested that women
appear to be differentially susceptible to the
stresses of certain occupations and professional
roles than men. In the student situation, women
medical students report significantly more de
pression. Women graduate students in general
report more emotional and physical distress
than their male counterparts. Women in the
business world describe vague physical
symptoms that appear to be a response to work
environments that they report being very happy
with. Lastly, the suicide rate of women
physicians is three to four times that of their
counterparts in the general populations.
How can we understand all of this? It would
be easy to continue the long history of attribut
ing the cause of all this to the notion that
women are constitutionally weaker. In fact, the
higher suicide rate in women doctors has been
said to be caused by the fact that 65 percent of
women physicians suffer from major psychiatric
mood disorder — a conclusion reached by a
group of predominantly male physicians who
do not consider that women face unique
stresses as a consequence of how society views
them.
The commonality that may tie all of the cur
rent research together is the issue of role con
flict, with its attendant strain. Through their
bodies, women may be expressing the stresses
of trying to develop careers in traditionally
male-dominated institutions. Additionally, if
married or if mothers, they then face the prob
lem of trying to reconcile often conflicting roles
and values with little support from colleagues,
family or husband.
It is critical for us to look beyond the individ
ual woman, to question our academic, business
and professional institutions, and to begin a
process of change that will encourage women
to move from expressing anger and hurt with
their bodies, and to assume an equal role in our
society.
Has there been, therefore, a culturally
sanctioned physical abuse of women for
hundreds of years — abuse which takes the
form of physical illness? If so, their per
severance and current success make them not
only survivors, but the "stronger sex."
