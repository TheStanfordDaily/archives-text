Burns — While most burns are preventable, they
still happen. Contrary to popular belief, apply
ing butter, greasy ointments or sprays is not
what you should do. Rather, flushing with or im
mersing the burned part in cold water, or in
some cases applying a cold compress, is the
proper first step. Cold water diminishes swell
ing and fluid loss, limits the extent of damage
and helps to counter infection and pain.
Cuts — Medical attention for cuts is advised
when (a) movement or feeling is lost; (b) the
edges of the skin pull apart instead of coming
easily together; (c) it is caused by a bite or is
very dirty; (d) it occurs in an area of continuous
movement such as a joint; or (e) it occurs in an
area such as the face which is of cosmetic con
cern.
Dog bites — Prompt and proper treatment is im
portant to prevent infections and scars. If the
injury is a scratch, cleanse the wound
thoroughly with soap and water and rinse it well
a couple of times a day. A puncture wound or a
bite that tears open tissues should be washed
with soap and water as soon as possible and
kept under running water for at least five
minutes. Cover the wound with sterile gauze
and go immediately to your physician.
Ingrown toe nails is a misnamed condition. The
nail does not actually grow in, rather, the sur
rounding tissue presses against the edge of a
nail that has been cut too short. The problem is
prevented by cutting toe nails straight across,
rather than in a curve. If there is no evidence of
infection, you may treat ingrown toenails by
forcing a tiny piece of absorbent cotton under
the nail. This prevents the nail from digging into
sensitive soft tissue. Replace the cotton twice
daily.
Nutrients are chemical substances derived from
food during the process of digestion. The major
nutrients — proteins, carbohydrates and fats —
are needed by the body for growth, repair,

maintenance and energy. The amount of energy
supplied by a nutrient is measured in calories.
Fat in the diet supplies almost double the
calories per ounce of protein or carbohydrates.
Salt — On average Americans eat 20 times more
salt than they need. It is not necessary to add
any salt to reach one's sodium requirement. It is
naturally found in foods.
Sore throat is not a disease, but a symptom. The
cause can be as trivial as having talked too loud
or smoked too much, or it may be a symptom of
a bacterial infection, infectious mononucleosis
or sinusitis. But by far the most common cause
is a minor viral infection, for which time is the
only cure.
Swimmer's ear — Inflammation of the ear canal
is really a skin rash resulting from over
exposure and moisture or too vigorous cleans
ing. Otitis externa, as it is technically called, is
usually treated with ear drops.
Swimming — If there is such a thing as the per
fect exercise, swimming may come close to
being it. It can be done by people of all ages —
and in most any physical shape. By exercising all
the major muscle groups, swimming can pro
vide full-body benefits without overly stressing
any one part of the anatomy. Swimming can
help you to tone up flabby muscles (without
making them bulky), increase flexibility, shed
excess pounds, relieve tension, condition your
cardiovascular system, and counter the mec
hanized stresses of other activities.
Tennis elbow — Weekend tennis players can
guard against tennis elbow by having racquets
strung no tighter than 55 pounds. Flexible rac
quets and a two-handed backhand technique
help keep elbows and wrists fixed during the
stroke.
