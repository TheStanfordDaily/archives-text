# House Democrats push budget package
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — House
Democrats pressed for speedy action
on their newborn $56 billion package
of 1986 spending cuts yesterday, \yjth
leaders boasting that the plan
matches savings in the Senate-
Reagan administration budget with
out trimming Social Security benefits
or scrapping a single program.
The day-old plan, brought before
the Democrat-controlled House
Budget Committee for action, also
would freeze defense spending au
thority at 1985 levels, a move
Republicans immediately vowed to
fight.
The Democratic proposal would
not cut as deeply in domestic pro
grams as the Senate-passed measure,
preserving automatic cost-of-living
increases not only for the nation's 36
million Social Security recipients but
for all government benefit programs.
In fact, it retains, although at

reduced levels of funding, all 13 pro
grams that th 6 budget approved last
week in the Senate would terminate
— including general revenue sharing,
the Economic Development Admin
istration, the Appalachian Regional
Commission and urban development
action grants.
"I think it represents a very strong
step in the direction of deficit reduc
tion," said Rep. William Gray (D-
Pa.), the Budget Committee chair
man. He said he hoped his panel
would finish work on the budget by
late yesterday or today, setting up a
possible floor vote next week.
Like the budget that passed the
Senate 50-49 last week with Presi
dent Reagan's support, the new
Democratic proposal would not raise
taxes.
The Senate bill would cancel next
January's cost-of-living benefit in
creases for Social Security recipients

and others receiving government
pension and benefit checks.
Democratic House leaders have
cited overwhelming opposition within
their party for such an approach, and
the new Democratic budget spares
the Social Security system from the
budget knife completely.
On defense spending, the bill
would freeze Pentagon spending au
thority at 1985 levels. However, Gray
said that, because of actual outlays of
funds that will be made next year by
the Pentagon from previously author
ized programs, defense spending
could still rise by about $15 billion in
1986 — compared with a rise of $21
billion under the Senate.
Thus, actual defense spending
would be restrained by $6 billion
more under the Democratic proposal
than under the Senate-passed bill.
The Democratic spending outline
would reduce the federal deficit —

now at just over $200 billion — to
$173.2 billion in fiscal 1986. The
Senate-passed bill would bring the
deficit to $171.4 billion in the same
period.
Overall, the Democratic offering
would accumulate savings of $259.1
billion by 1988, compared with $295
billion in the Senate measure.
The Democratic plan would retain
subsidies to the Amtrak rail pas
senger system — a program Reagan
originally sought to kill — but with a
10 percent, one-year reduction in
federal support. By contrast, the Sen
ate bill would cut the Amtrak subsidy
by 12.5 percent in 1986, 25 percent
in 1987 and 40 percent in 1988.
The Democratic plan would make
spending cuts or freezes in nearly all
federal programs. However, pro
grams designed to help the disabled
and low-income Americans would
not be affected.
