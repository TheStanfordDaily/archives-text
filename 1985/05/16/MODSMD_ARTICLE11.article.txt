School lawsuit settled
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administra
tion, seeking to avoid mandatory school busing,
has approved another in a series of "magnet
school" desegregation programs, the Justice De
partment said yesterday.
The department said the magnet-school system
approach would be permitted in lieu of manda
tory cross-town busing in the Phoenix, Ariz.,
Union High School District under a proposed
consent decree filed by the department and
Phoenix school officials.
If approved by the U.S. District Court in
Phoenix, the consent decree would resolve a civil

suit brought the department filed simultaneously
yesterday, alleging that the school district has
violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
which prohibits discrimination in federally as
sisted programs.
The consent decree filed yesterday followed
agreement between the city high school district
and the Education Department on a desegration
plan.
The magnet-school system of desegregation,
which has been approved by the department for
use in Chicago, Bakersfield and some
other areas, allows students in a school system to
voluntarily transfer to the so-called magnet
schools, which would offer special academic pro

grams.
Under the magnet school approach, a school
system attempts to bring about desegregation by
creating special courses and other incentives at
certain schools in a district — but not all schools
— and then to make these offerings available to
all students on a voluntary basis.
Market mixed
Stock prices turned mixed late yesterday,
backing away from earlier broad gains. The Dow
Jones average of 30 industrials fell 4.2 points
from Tuesday.
