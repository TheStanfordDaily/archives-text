Police ready for protest
BERKELEY — UC-Berkeley police are
gearing up in expectation of the largest campus
protest here since the Vietnam War when the
Board of Regents hears testimony this week on
investments in South Africa.
Police and university officials' predictions of at
least 2,500 to 3,000 demonstrators are far lower
than those of the students, who say they expect
up to 25,000 protesters.
Since daily South Africa protests began on the
campus April 10, more than 660 demonstrators
have been arrested on the campus and at the ad
ministration headquarters. That includes a group
of 57 people arrested at a sit-in yesterday.
More than 200 people were arrested yesterday
at an anti-apartheid protest on the Santa Cruz
campus. Police said a car attempted to drive
through the line of marchers, hitting two men.
Neither man was injured seriously.
At UC-Santa Barbara, 75 protesters briefly

occupied the office of Chancellor Robert Hutten
back after an anti-apartheid demonstration by
250 students yesterday.
Some 10,000 people at Berkeley and 12,000 at
UC-Davis greeted South African Bishop Des
mond Tutu when the Nobel Peace Prize winner
visited the campuses on Monday.
Today and tomorrow, the students will
be demanding UC divest itself of what they
claim are about $2.4 billion worth of investments
in corporations and banks doing business with
the apartheid regime in South Africa.
At least 2,000 students from the other eight
campuses in the UC system are expected to
arrive via some 50 chartered buses, according to
organizers of today's march, teach-in and sleep
in at the Lawrence Hall of Science, where the
regents are meeting.
Bomb blast in Berkeley
BERKELEY — A bomb hidden in a package
exploded yesterday in a UC-Berkeley classroom

when a curious student tried to open it, seriously
injuring his right arm and eye, witnesses said.
"I was in an adjacent room. I heard a very
strong explosion, and then, after about two or
three seconds. I heard a person screaming," said
C.C. Chen, a graduate student who had been
working in the next room on the second floor.
"He was screaming, 'Help me, help me.' I went
in and his arm was exploded. There was blood
everywhere."
John Hauser, 26, of Richmond, was listed in
fair condition at Herrick Hospital, where he un
derwent surgery to repair damage to his right
hand, arm and eye, a hospital spokesman said.
The device apparently was in a package left in
a room used by computer students, said Prof.
D.J. Angelakos.
Today's weather
Sunny and warm today with highs in the 90s.
Lows tonight in the 4()s and 50s.
