## Shedding light on the debate over units 
### TRACY FURUTANI 
"This was for a two-unit class (Electrical Engineering
121)," said Glenn Slocum, a co-terminal student in elec
trical engineering, as he thunked down a meticulous 20-
page lab report overflowing with circuit diagrams, "now
all I have to do is build it." He estimated that he spent
more than 25 hours over a week and a half on just this
project as part of the class. Electrical Engineering 121
used to be a three-unit class until one of the units was
taken for an engineering writing requirement.
"There's this blow-off level (for any given humanities
class) where you do absolutely zero work during the
term," explains Geoff Dryvynsyde, who double majors in
history and philosophy. "You make a few witty com
ments in class and write a really terrible paper. Then the
prof, calls you into his office and tells you how you'd better
change your attitude . . . but you end up with a B —
anyway." And you get five units.
The root of unit ambition
The debate between "techies" (people with sci
ence/technical majors) and "fuzzies" (those with non
technical majors) over how many units a science/engi
neering class should be worth in relation to a human
ities class has gone on since, quite possibly, the in
ception of the unit system at the University. At that fate
ful time, it was decided that, in general, a sci
ence/engineering class should be worth three units, while
a humanities/social science class should be worth five.
In recent years, the debate has intensified as the
amount of "basic" information engineers need to know to
be competent in their field has grown exponentially, in
creasing the number of classes they have to take.
Entwined with the question of equity in unitdom is the
bigger question of what the major is trying to accomplish
for its students: the philosophy of that field of study. This
determines the kinds of requirements (and classes) the
major will entail, which will lead straight back to the num
ber of units each class is worth.
The unit system at Stanford is based on something
called the "Carnegie System," which, in essence, states
that for every academic unit a class is worth, there should
be three hours of work associated with the class. So a
three-unit class should require nine hours of in-class and
out-of-class time, while a five-unit class should have
15. Extrapolating from Slocum's experiences, Electrical
Engineering 121 should be worth six units.
"Units are a very arbitrary way to judge someone's
knowledge acquisition," said senior Jeff Gelles, who
double majors in human biology and communication.
He feels the system of determining units, or unitting, for
science classes should not be gauged against unitting in
humanities courses: "The inconsistency lies in trying to
compare two different types of goals ... in engineering.

you're learning a vocation as opposed to getting an educa
tion, which is the point of college."
Many people agree with Gelles' point, especially a few
engineers whose ability to take humanities courses is
severely limited by the requirements of their major. Jim
McVey, a co-terminal student in electrical engineering,
noted that engineers can "get the same education as a
liberal arts major if they work really hard. Otherwise, it's
really easy to fall out (and not take humanities courses)
.. . (electrical engineering) is a major that requires many
years of advance planning in order to take courses in your
senior year that you'd like to take." McVey said he plot
ted his entire academic career during the first term of his
freshman year, allowing him to go overseas one term.
Why things are the way they are
The University's guidelines on the design of undergrad
uate education, according to the Stanford University Bul
letin, state that a major should require no fewer than 55
and no greater than 120 units toward its completion. This
is designed to achieve the twin goals of study in "depth"
and study in "breadth and exploration," as well as to
prevent scholastic "parochialism." Engineering majors all
require close to the maximum, while many humanities and
social science degrees hover near the minimum "depth."
Engineering departments require so many units
because of an external constraint, according to Gene
Franklin, a professor of electrical engineering and chairman
of the School of Engineering Undergraduate Council
School. "There's an accreditation board for engineering
and technical programs . . . for students, accreditation (by
the board) is of great economic and academic value."
Thus, there is a definite lower limit on the number of
classes an engineer is expected to take for the program to
maintain accreditation.
For the engineering classes to be of any use, though, the
prospective engineer needs the proper math/science back
ground — hence the math/science requirements push the
number of units required for the degree close to the Uni
versity maximum. A practical result of this is when a new
course is deemed necessary for engineers, it can't just be
tacked on; units have to be taken from other classes —
and so cases like that of Electrical Engineering 121 arise,
where a possibly under-unitted class loses units.
This slashing also occurs when the University decides to
change its own requirements— the addition of the foreign
language requirement for graduation spurred an overhaul
of the engineering degree requirements.
Most humanities degrees require comparatively few
classes (generally 12 to 15 classes at five units each) be
cause humanities departments believe the under
graduate degree should mean. "Basically, the major is de
signed to give the students the ability to have insights on a

topic, analyze the facts, and, in general, think," said Diane
Paulsen, the undergraduate secretary for the History De
partment.
Communication Prof. Marion Lewenstein, chair of the
Communication Department Undergraduate Curriculum
Committee, agreed, saying, "I think that people on the
outside view us (Communication) as vocational training,
but we've tried to change that." Communication is in its
first year of revised major requirements that give more
emphasis to liberal arts: "A liberal arts undergraduate
education gives the student background both in breadth
and depth on the role of communications in society and its
effects on individuals," she explained.
The upshot is that many faculty members in humanities
and social sciences don't believe that adding more re
quirements to their majors will enhance a student's train
ing in "how to think."
At the student level, this difference in philosophy is
seen in the terminology. A fuzzy course implies that a
humanities/social science class is not as rigorous as a
techie course. The practical difference between engineer
ing/science and humanities/social science, said Dana
Shelby, who until recently majored in engineering but
now is in international relations, "is that science courses
have problem sets due every week, whereas there's more
leniency in humanities courses . . . papers can be
postponed."
Shelby switched majors because she didn't like the en
gineering way of thinking. International relations shifts
"your mode from writing equations to thinking about dif
ferent levels and implications of actions," she said.
There is a noticeable difference in attitude between
techies and fuzzies, manifest especially in humanities
courses. "Humanities classes assign the same amount of
work per unit as science classes," said Joe Sinner, a co
terminal student in petroleum engineering.
According to Sinner, a "lot" of people in humanities
don't do the readings, because papers can be written using
just one. This gives the impression that humanities
classes are less work than their five units imply. "When 1
took humanities courses, when things got hectic,
humanities went, in terms of work," he continued, "If you
did all the readings, then it could become a heck of a lot of
work."
Kathy Christie, a co-terminal student in industrial en
gineering, remarked, "I have never pulled an all-nighter
for a humanities class, whereas I do that a lot for CS
(computer science) classes." She agreed that humanities
courses would be five units worth of work if you did the
reading.
All the same, there is still a basic misunderstanding be
tween fuzzies and techies. Marissa Quiroz, a co-terminal
student in English who also majors in history, said that
though "it does appear that they (techies) have a lot of
problem sets, it doesn't seem as taxing as a humanities

course. . . . (Technical courses have) no reading, just go to
lecture; you can miss some lectures. There's just some
thing about bringing all the material in the course to
gether, like in humanities courses, which demands you to
be more creative." She said she believes that the
humanities courses are worth their units.
But Engineering Prof. Gilbert Masters, the associate
dean of Student Affairs for engineering, said that
"engineering classes demand the correct amount of work
for the units, whereas humanities classes don't demand as
much work (as they're unitted for)."
How they do things
Units for all departments in humanities and sciences
and engineering are set by a combination of lecturer input
and unwritten rules. The lecturer for a course will submit
a recommendation for how many units he believes
the course to be worth; the recommendation is discussed
at the department faculty meeting and approved.
For required courses, however, especially in the
crowded engineering majors, the process is much more
complex because units have to be taken from other
courses in order to stay below the University maximum.
So instead of dickering with the units of several courses in
order achieve the desired total, some schools, like the
School of Engineering, will call together an undergradu
ate council to change the requirements for the major.
The School of Engineering's Undergraduate Council
has just completed a two-year study on the overhaul of its
requirements and is about to implement some sweeping
changes, the net effect of which will increase the number
of engineering depth units a prospective engineer must
take, while lowering the total number of units required for
the degree by 10 units — incidentally alleviating the unit
slashing phenomenon.
Departments that are not saddled with the problem of
too many units also change their requirements. The gen
eral trend of these non-unit related changes now put more
rigor into the major. Not surprisingly, these kinds of
changes are occuring predominantly in humanities pro
grams. Communication, as noted earlier, is now putting
more emphasis on the theory of communication rather
than merely the practice. History is requiring more writ
ten work from students. Biology is considering altering its
core course emphasis to include more contemporary top
ics, as well as streamlining the entire core course structure
to fit within the sophomore year.
