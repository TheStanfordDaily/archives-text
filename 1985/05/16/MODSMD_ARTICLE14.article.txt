## THE 						STANFORD DAILY The 						rape recant case 
### 
The well-publicized case of Gary Dotson and
Cathleen Crowell Webb is a very strange one.
In 1977, Webb testified that Dotson raped her.
But in March of this year, Webb changed her
story. She now says she made up the rape story to
protect herself, a nervous 16-year-old girl who
feared she was pregnant and didn't want her
foster parents to know that she was sexually ac
tive.
This weekend, after two months of controversy
and publicity about the case, Illinois Gov. James
Thompson commuted Dotson's sentence but said
he believes Dotson was properly convicted of the
crime.
So Dotson is now a free man, but he wants a
new trial to prove his innocence. Unless Dotson
is retried and proven innocent, he remains a con
victed felon, and, as such, is ineligible to vote or
hold public office, and must go through life with
the stigma of being a convicted rapist.

Perhaps we will never know what really hap
pened: Did Webb lie in 1977, or is she lying now?
What we do know is this: The Dotson-Webb
case will probably hurt all victims of rape. Too of
ten already, rape victims are treated with
suspicion. People accuse them of "asking for it,"
of leading on their attackers, of making up
stories. A well-publicized case such as this one,
where a woman says she was raped and then
changes her story, allows those people to believe
their opinions have some credibility, when they
almost never do.
Webb's changing story will make these people
even more skeptical of women taking the terribly
difficult step of reporting a rape. Her case is a set
back to years of efforts of encouraging women to
come forward and prosecute rapists. When rape
victims know they are going to be 'ooked upon
with skeptical eyes, they are going to be even
more reluctant to come forward. And that is a
real tragedy.
