# Do not over-intellectualize divestment
## 
### 
I've been avoiding writing about this particular
subject for some time now. In part I've shied away
from it because I felt I had nothing to contribute to
the discussion that had not already been contrib
uted by more knowledgeable individuals than I.
But the true reason for my reluctance is an endur
ing confusion I feel about the issue; I am all too
easily swayed by arguments on both sides, and in
recent weeks I've found myself struggling without
much success to fully define my position. The issue,
of course, is Stanford's investment in companies
which operate in South Africa, and whether that in
vestment ought to continue. t
My initial answer was — and my final answer is
— that Stanford ought to divest. The confusion
arises not from those conclusions, but from what
comes between them. In his open letter to the Stan
ford community last week, University President
Donald Kennedy wrote, "I am troubled that ra
tional discourse about (divestment) . . . seems to
have become a victim of moral urgency." His words
are echoed by UC President David Gardner,
who has expressed concern about what he
calls "the absence of a more reasoned and critical
analysis of a very complex issue." The applicability
of these statements to well-informed organizations
like Stanford Out of South Africa (SOSA) is ques
tionable; I would hardly call their position paper on
the issue lacking in "reasonable and critical analy
sis." The statements are more descriptive of myself
and, I suspect, a good number of students like me
who favor divestment but probably couldn't sustain
a good argument with a knowledgeable person
opposed to it. We know that we want the Univer
sity to divest, and we are reasonably sure we are
right; the problem arises when we're confronted
with detailed counter-arguments such as Kennedy's
which cause us to wonder if we have truly ad
dressed the issue from a completely rational stand
point.
The dilemma rests in the issue's complexity.
Reading page after page of news articles and
people's opinions is likely to leave you more uncer
tain than ever. You begin to feel overwhelmed by
the intricate relationships involved and the vast ar
ray of consequences ensuing from both action and
inaction. One of the useful things I got out of the
human biology core was a recognition that every
problem worthy of public policy solutions is like a
universe unto itself; untold social, political, eco
nomic, moral and technological factors exist to con
found every conceivable alternative. In the face of
such chaos, one is obliged to carefully consider
each element, weigh costs and benefits, and at
tempt to forge the best possible policy. It seems to
me that this is the only viable course if one is to
pretend to be educated; I agree with Kennedy that

ours is a tradition of "thoughtful examination of all
possible views." It is difficult to justify or support a
position which is arrived at by other than a logical,
rational thinking process. To refuse to acknowl
edge the complexity of an issue, to willfully simplify
and then reduce the numerous facets of a problem
into a bumper-sticker slogan strikes me as a conces
sion to mental weakness. It is not the kind of think
ing I generally consider worthy of respect.

There are times and is
sues which require that
complexity give way to
' moral urgency.' This is
such a time, and divest
ment is such an issue.

Fully aware of all this, and after having thought
fully examined a host of opinions and facts, I still
feel that Stanford ought to divest, and I am still dis
satisfied with my response to Kennedy's argument.
I can only parrot SOSA's line in reply, which makes
me feel like an intellectual cheat for using someone
else's mental work to justify an opinion I formed in
the space of an instant. But then I think about
South African families who hover in tin shacks at
night and dismantle them before dawn in order to
live on the land of their choice in defiance of South
African law; I think of mourners at a funeral,
mercilessly shot down; I think of a regime which
daily condemns millions of human beings to lives of
misery and degradation. And suddenly this issue
becomes very clear indeed. This university should
have no part in supporting such a system.
Sure that's a bleeding-heart liberal way of think
ing. Sure it's not the most logically cogent argu
ment. But there are times and there are issues which
are obscured rather than illuminated by over

intellectualization and assiduous attention to detail.
There are times and issues which require that com
plexity give way to "moral urgency." This is such a
time, and divestment is such an issue. It cannot be
repeated enough: Our education, our privilege to
examine and reason and analyze, must not be
financed by the blood of South Africans.
This is not to advocate an anti-intellectual ap
proach to the issue. It is instead to argue that the
mode of reasoning which Kennedy employs is per
haps not entirely appropriate for this issue. Ken
nedy's argument is utilitarian; it attempts to assess
good and bad consequences of opposing policies.
He defines the moral question as divestment's ef
ficacy as a tool by which to end apartheid. Such
reasoning is clearly legitimate and certainly com
pelling; it is also the kind of reasoning which, in the
context of this issue, is far too conducive to inac
tion.
We are not discussing the efficacy of divestment.
We are discussing South African families hiding in
makeshift tin shacks and the morality of Stanford's
contribution to their plight. I am not sure I believe
that Stanford's divestment from companies doing
business in South Africa will have any real effect on
that regime. I am sure that this possible lack of im
pact in no way justifies pursuing a policy built upon
what Kennedy himself calls "the very slim chance"
Stanford's influence as a minor stockholder can be
brought to bear on corporation conduct in South
Africa.
The intrinsic immorality of supporting the apart
heid system by doing business with it outweighs the
alleged ineffectiveness of divestment. Of course,
one might argue that the morality implicit in divest
ment itself is suspect. One might argue that divest
ment makes us latter-day Pontius Pilates, washing
our collective hands of direct responsibility but as
suming a deeper, darker guilt for the consequences
of relinquishing that responsibility. Perhaps. But I
believe we must shoulder that guilt (if indeed there
will ever be any reason to feel it) rather than bide
our time and hope someone solves the moral di
lemma for us.
I am thus compelled again to conclude that Stan
ford should divest. The issue is complex. But it is
clear to me that we cannot do business with those
who do business in South Africa except at the cost
of our morality, however we define it. To persist in
investment is necessarily to become so mired in in
tricate details and sober, calculated judgments that
we lose sight of what is most important: the suffer
ing of South African blacks, and our hand in that
suffering. To me, there is no good rational justifica
tion for that.
