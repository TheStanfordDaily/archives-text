Distorting history
Apparently Stephen Debenham
does not know the difference be
tween totalitarianism and genocide.
"The Holocaust continues every day
for those left behind the Iron Cur
tain," he writes, as if genocide were
defined simply as the deprivation of
rights and freedoms. Genocide in the
Nazi era was the systematic mass
extermination of a people, and if
Debenham can prove that such
extermination of a people is going on
behind the Iron Curtain, then he
might have a point. Instead, his
statement distorts history and
reflects a lack of understanding
about the uniqueness of the Jewish
Holocaust.
So does President Reagan's state
ment at Bitburg in which Berlin
ers=Jews=Afghans=Miskito
Indians. Debenham is eager to quote
Reagan by saying, "America must
fulfill her moral responsibility to
stand by all those in the world who
are threatened by tyranny." Who is
threatened by tyranny? Here's
Ronnie: "Today, freedom-loving
people around the world must say, "I
am a Berliner. I am a Jew in a world
still threatened by anti-Semitism. I
am an Afghan and I am a prisoner of
the Gulag. I am a refugee in a
crowded boat foundering off the
coast of Vietnam. I am a Laotian, a
Cuban and a Miskito Indian in
Nicaragua." Reagan's statement is
no more about morality than was
Kennedy's: It's about political al
liances, and if Debenham failed to
notice the president's blatant omis
sion of blacks in South Africa, then
he failed to notice that the issue in
Reagan's mind is not, "Where do
people suffer?" but, "Whose suffer
ing can I use and whose suffering
must I ignore for my own political
ends?"
To blur the distinction between
totalitarianism and genocide allows
for outrageous statements like
Reagan's in which the situation in
Afghanistan is somehow equated
morally with the situation of Jews in
Nazi Germany. By leveling the evil

of the Holocaust to the evil of the
Iron Curtain, such a statement dulls
rather than heightens our moral
awareness. It is possible to remem
ber the unique horror of the Nazi era
and still remain critical of the
totalitarianism of the Eastern bloc
without resorting to moral reduc
tionism for political purposes.

No paranoid fantasy
The Daily editorial (May 14)
about the undercover cop at the
SOSA meeting was wrong, wrong,
wrong. The presence of an uniden
tified police officer, clearly there for
the purposes of "intelligence gather
ing," was a scary infringement of
SOSA's political freedoms.
This is not a paranoid fantasy. The
Daily editorial writers would do well
to read a little about the efforts of
police, FBI agents and others to
undermine the civil rights and anti
war movements through such pro
grams as COINTELPRO.
It couldn't be happening here?
Our Stanford police are too friendly
for that? Perhaps. But at best the
cops betrayed a tremendous lack of
sensitivity and professional ethics.
As someone who has not been
active in SOSA but who has atten
ded many of the rallies and strongly
supports full divestment, I would like
to see SOSA meetings be open to
everyone whenever possible. That
said, journalists and especially cops
who have the privilege of attending
such meetings should always make
themselves known from the very
beginning. SOSA members can then
decide whether they want all their
activities being monitored by
"Stanford's finest."
Instead of labeling this sordid
episode a "breakdown in communi
cation," The Daily should be con
demning it and demanding an
apology from the police and the
administration.
