## SOSA concerned with facts, not fashion 
### 
I am writing as someone who has attended Stan
ford Out of South Africa (SOSA) events and tried
to help the divestment movement progress as best I
can. I, therefore, write as a member of Stanford
Out of South Africa. This letter is to clarify the fal
lacies of the viewpoint by Gary Malone, Daniel
Coles and R. Richard Banks, and the column by
Jason Matherly (The Daily May 15). In simple
words. In simple truths.

VIEWPOINT

SOSA supports total divestment of Stanford
holdings in corporations operating in South Africa.
Jason Matherly's statement that we have somehow
restricted our focus since our conception is not
true. We have never entertained selective divest
ment, shareholder resolutions or any other method
as an alternative to total divestment. They are, of
course, welcome means to that end. Perhaps in ex
amining our name, Stanford Out of South Africa,
people can understand our purpose.
And perhaps they will stop misunderstanding our
motives. Malone, Coles and Banks had well
formed points, but they did not apply to the SOSA
movement. The struggle in South Africa should be
linked to the struggle in our country — and it has,
in every major speech, including Angela Davis'
recent presentation, in the nighttime films in Man
dela Free University, in workshops and in a five
hour SOSA meeting several weekends ago. I
suspect that had these gentlemen attended SOSA
events, they would have discovered that our fourth
principle of unity is education — at many levels, in
the United States and abroad. We are not
"fashionable protesters" with "psychological prob
lems." We specifically adopted that fourth princi
ple to ensure that no one would come just to join
the bandwagon. Anyone involved in SOSA has
been swamped with information since he began,
because we want an educated protest — the most
effective kind. Talk to the people involved,
Malone, et al.; they know the scope of what they're
supporting. And as we discovered after the forum,
it is precisely the people who get the facts who want
to join in. M;«kes sense to me. El in, Jason?
Actually, problems stem from those who luive
not listened to the facts, the bases of the national

divestment movement. It is not just a moral argu
ment. Apartheid is aborrhent and it must end. And
corporate divestment is the answer. We know
foreign divestment can crash South Africa's gov
ernment; the great recession in 1977 was proof of
that. Point one: Divestment is a proven method. We
also recognize the impact Stanford divestment, as a
leading university and a shareholder, would have
on divestment by other schools as well as the com
panies in their portfolio. On the other hand, what
has been the positive result of their considerably in
creased investments in those corporations over the
past decades? Point two: Stanford divestment
would be a strong statement. Continued Stanford
investment means continued Stanford ineffective
ness. The Board of Trustees' latest decisions signal
a maintained lack of commitment to action. We

Perhaps in examining
our name, Stanford Out
of South Africa, people
can understand our pur
pose.

also acknowledge the responsibility of the trustees
to the financial well-being of our university. But as
Ted Brown, president of the Institute for Corpor
ate Research and Education, has explained,
portfolios without the risky South Africa invest
ments do just as well or better than those with
those investments. Point three: Divestment is finan
cially responsible. Last, we strongly uphold the
right of the oppressed people in South Africa to de
termine their own political fate. All they request
from us is divestment; what happens afterward
must be left them. Point four: Opposition to
divestment based on the desire to determine the
political future and structure of another country is

paternalistic and invalid.
Matherly's attempt to parallel SOSA's activities
with Stanford's (continued enrollment equals con
tinued investment) overlooks our crucial argument.
SOSA has put its leverage to work. We have used
means within and without the system to achieve our
goal: total Stanford divestment. And we have seen
that our efforts bring results. This issue has gone
farther than it has ever gone, and we will eventually
succeed. On the other hand, in the eight years since
this issue last arose full-scale, the University has not
used its leverage inside or outside the system at all. 11
has not initiated one shareholder resolution, has
not sanctioned one corporation for "social injury,"
has not divested from one company to achieve its
proclaimed goal: to take a stand against apartheid.
And at this point in South Africa's history, black
South Africa tells us divestment is the last and only
viable solution. SOSA has listened.
Finally, Malone, et al., were quick to point out
how little SOSA has suffered from protesting.
Sacrifice is not a prerequisite for commitment.
Nevertheless, the two seem to come hand in hand,
and this movement is no different. If you honestly
think that rallies for two, 50 or 1,000 people, edu
cational brochures, a public forum and continuous
campus programming and advertisement for three
weeks is an easy undertaking, is"more like a picnic
than a protest," then come on down to Mandela
Free University and, quite bluntly, get your facts
straight.
That is the main point of this letter. It is a plea
that people stop speaking out of ignorance on this
issue and start acting out of concern. As Theodore
Roosevelt said many years ago, "It is not the critic
who counts, not the person who points out how the
strong person stumbled or where the doer of deeds
could have done them better. The credit belongs to
the person who is actually in the arena. ..." Come
see the rest of the motto down at Mandela Free U;
it's hanging there as a reminder that this is not a
movement for "fashionable protesters" and "self
styled leaders.' " SOSA is self-righteous? Remem
ber that old saying about people in glass houses not
throwing stones. If I were you, Matherly, I'd be
afraid to sneeze.
