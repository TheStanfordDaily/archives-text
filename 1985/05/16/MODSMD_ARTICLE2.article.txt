Padres remain at loggerheads over an
employee at Tresidder Union who
was allegedly docked pay for com
plaining about unsafe working condi
tions.
Linda Crouse, a maintenance crew
member serving as shop steward at
Tresidder, attended a Feb. 7 meeting
to present complaints concerning an
unsafe elevator in Tresidder to the
University.
According to the Crouse's tes
timony before Padres, Crouse
received approval of "steward release
time," specified as paid time in the
collective bargaining agreement,
from her immediate supervisor to at
tend the Feb. 7 meeting.
The University says Crouse's pay
was docked appropriately, because
the time spent at the meeting was
"not time worked by her" and "not
steward relief time authorized by the
collective bargaining agreement," ac
cording to University lawyer Michael
Vartain.
The pay for attending the meeting
"was initially approved by manage
ment, and Crouse was paid without
objection," according to Padres' fin
dings.
An investigation had shown the mal
functioning of the elevator was due to
water in the shaft, which deteriorated
the electronic components, and im
properly loaded heavy objects that

stressed the elevator parts. At the
meeting, it was ordered that new
parts he installed in the elevator, the
water be drained from the shaft and
the employees receive training in
proper loading procedure.
"It was only after the University
learned that the union had gone
outside the University to complain

about the elevator that her wages
retroactively were denied to her," ac
cording to Padres' concluding state
ment.
Upon reviewing the evidence sub
mitted, the deputy labor commis
sioner issued a concluding statement
ordering the Univerity to pay Crouse
the wages she had been docked. Cali
fornia labor code forbids discrimina
tion against an employee "because
such an employee has . . . made any
oral or written complaint to the divi
sion (or) the governmental agencies
. . . assisting the division with refer
ence to employee safety or health."
According to the labor code, if
Stanford fails to settle the matter with
the deputy labor commissioner within
10 days, the matter may be taken to
court.
Vartain said Stanford has not
settled since receiving the deputy
labor commissioner's decision 14
days ago and will not.
Upon going to court, it is standard
practice for the judge to require the
University and the union to submit to
impartial arbitration, Vartain said.
The University should proceed as
"with all other grievances" and sub
mit to arbitration, Vartain said.
Due to the obvious malfuntioning
of the equipment, Crouse and her fel
low workers sought information from
the supervisor as to the proper weight
load of the elevator.
Unable to find answers from man
agement officials at Tresidder, Lon
Warneke, the union safety officer
here, contacted an elevator licensing
agency prior to the Feb. 7 meeting to
"just to get some information and to
find out whether it (the Tresidder
elevator) was a safety hazard," he
said.
Despite the initial positive
response at the Feb. 7 meeting,
Crouse was informed by her super
visor on Feb. 26 that her pay for at
tending the meeting would be
docked.
Crouse had received word soon
after the Feb. 7 meeting that the Uni
versity was displeased upon learning
that Warneke had discussed the
Tresidder situation with an outside
party, she said.
At a Committee on Union-
University Concerns (CUUC)
meeting on Feb. 13, Felix Bar
thelemy, the manager of employee
relations, demanded to know why the
workers had appealed to an outside
source, Crouse said.
"We don't know if he was told to
dock my pay, but we know he had the
OK of employee relations to do
that," Crouse said.
