# Geist's busy schedule puts him in doughnuts
## 
### GREG CROSSFIELD 
Rich Geist works 40 hours a week
at Horizon Partners, a consulting firm
in Menlo Park, which isn't unusual
for someone from Stanford. He also
works seven hours a week running a
doughnut delivery service to Row
houses and fraternities at Stanford.
From the two, Geist manages to
make a fair income, then finds time to
attend classes.
Geist, a junior majoring in political
science and economics, likes to be ac
tive. "I hate being unbusy," he says.
"I am choosing not to concentrate on
school, but I am learning as much or
even more than a lot of people who
just concentrate on school."
But even without concentrating on
school, Geist maintains a 4.0 grade
point average in political science,
with three classes to complete, and a
3.5 in economics, with two classes.
This quarter, he's taking 22 units, in
cluding two economics classes, a
stock market class, Psychology 1, a
Macintosh class and a marketing re
search project— which he is pursuing
at the Graduate School of Business in
conjunction with two students. Still,
the heavy load may require some
concessions.
"I might not complete the poli sci
degree because it requires a lot of
thinking time. Whereas in economics,
you can memorize formulas and take
exams in a lot less time," Geist says.
Geist is an associate at Horizon
Partners. He spends a great deal of
time finding out about a client com
pany's costs, competition and clients,
but the job also requires corporate

presentations and maintaining busi
ness contacts. It involves a lot of work
with employees in the firms for which
Horizon consults — keeping people
throughout the client company in
formed on the project's progress.
Stanford, unlike larger universities,
doesn't rely on a big corporation to
supply items like doughnuts, leav
ing room for the proverbial "little
guy" — an apt term for the
5-foot-7 Geist — to operate. He
delivers doughnuts seven days a week
to several fraternities and Row
houses from a small bakery in Menlo
Park.
But Geist has turned this "little
guy" operation into a $ 15,000-a-year
gross operation, although he won't
divulge his exact earnings. He claims
to have doubled the total revenues of
the previous delivery person, a friend
who gave the business to Geist in the
fall of 1983, by advertising and going
house to house seeking new business.
Geist says his parents gave him a
lot of independence when he was
young, which has had a significant im
pact on him. Both his parents work at
a family-owned and -operated air
freight company in Chicago. "My
parents always encouraged me to be
independent," he says."I started
spending a lot of time alone at around
age seven, when my mother started
working again. I learned to take re
sponsibility."
This responsibility came in the
form of starting work early. "1 have
worked every summer since seventh
grade. At 17, I started doing cold
calls and contacting clients for my
mom and dad," he says.

Along with finishing third among
640 students in high school, Geist
played varsity basketball and worked
nights and weekends for his parents.
He was also an assistant tennis pro for
two summers. "There were just not a
lot of things around my school I
wanted to do," he says.
As soon as he arrived at Stanford,
Geist dove right in. As a freshman, he
was the assistant project manager for
the ASSU Advertising Agency.
During that summer, he sold adver
tising for the ASSU Course Guide
and Restaurant Guide while
working full time as marketing direc
tor for a small software firm.
During sophomore year, he ran the
ASSU Sunday Flicks, a position nor
mally held by a senior. During winter
and spring quarter, he began working
as a "gofer" at Bain & Co. in Palo
Alto. The contacts he developed
there helped him get the job with
Horizon Partners. During last sum
mer, Geist built a management infor
mation system for the First National
Bank of Chicago while taking two
economics classes at night.
Geist's summer plans include
working with Horizon Partners and
The Horizon Group and doing re
search on a San Francisco office for
his parents air freight business.
"1 would not recommend my style
of life to anyone," he says."It re
quires 6 a.m. to 2 a.m. every day and
really takes a lot out of me. Eventu
ally, I will have to slow down, but I
want to take advantage of all Stan
ford has to offer because 1 will never
be in this atmosphere again."
