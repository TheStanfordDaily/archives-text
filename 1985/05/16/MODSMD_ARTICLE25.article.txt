## Women netters face Harvard today Card opens title defense 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
OKLAHOMA CITY — The No. 1-ranked
Stanford women's tennis team spent the even
ing before its first-round defense of its NCAA
title eating barbecued buffalo at a cookout
and sipping white wine at a reception spon
sored by the Cardinal Club.
Meanwhile, Harvard players — Stanford's
opponents today at 11:30 PST — spent last
night in their hotel rooms studying for the
final exams they will take this morning.
After completing their finals, which will be
mailed back to Harvard, the Crimson netters
will head to the Oklahoma City Tennis Cen
ter, where they will in all likelihood end
something else — their season.
"I felt pretty good about playing Harvard in
the first round," Stanford Coach Frank Bren
nan said of the 19th-ranked and 16th-seeded
Crimson, which the Cardinal defeated 8-1

earlier this year. "I'm not too worried about
them.
"It's a nice match for us because it's almost
a practice match, and we can relax a little bit.
It's a match in which we can not play our best
and still win."
In fact, Brennan probably won't have to
worry about losing until the finals of the 16-
team tournament on Sunday. That's the only
time Stanford can face No. 2-seeded USC, the
only team to mar the Cardinal's 25-1 record.
Although top-seeded Stanford does hold a
2-1 advantage over the Trojans this season,
Brennan does not see his team as the over
whelming favorite.
"I consider us really a co-No. 1 (seed) be
cause of USC," he said. "We've had three 5-4
matches (with USC), all of which could have
gone either way. So I don't consider us a
strong favorite by any means. But I do think
Stanford and USC should be in the finals."
To get there, Stanford will have to beat

Harvard today, either UCLA or Trinity
(Texas) tomorrow, and then probably fourth
seeded Miami (Fla.) or fifth-seeded Florida in
Saturday's semifinal. Of the 15 teams in the
tournament, the Cardinal has played nine this
season and is a combined 16-1 against them.
If Stanford is upset in its quest to win its
second straight NCAA crown and its third in
four years, it will most likely be a wind-upset.
Objects known for their wind-blocking
qualities such as trees and mountains are not
too common in Oklahoma — which from the
air looks like a Formica table top — and ten
nis here has been known to suffer from an
over-abundance of wind at times.
"I think it (the wind) will be a factor," said
senior team captain Linda Gates, who will be
trying to win her third NCAA championship
watch. "But I don't think it will hurt our team
at all. I think we have experienced players,
