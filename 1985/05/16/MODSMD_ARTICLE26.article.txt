# Don't call him Pat, and don't compare him to John
## McEnroe coming into his own 
### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
At first, it was hard to track him
down.
Patrick "Don't call me Pat"
McEnroe doesn't list his telephone
number in the Stanford directory.
And when somebody does chance
upon McEnroe's number, his phone
is usually busy — day and night.
And Dick Gould, the normally
cheery and gregarious coach of the
Cardinal's No. 3-ranked men's tennis
team and McEnroe's West Coast
mentor, was strangely tight-lipped
when discussing his ace freshman.
His answers were run-of-the-mill
and sounded rehearsed. "I'm
delighted with Patrick's play," Gould
said, appearing to read some kind of
mental cue card. "Frankly, there was
no adjustment to college tennis. He
fit right in from the start."
Gould went on with these positive
assessments, generously heaping
compliments on McEnroe. He never
once strayed from the beaten path
that almost every coach takes when
describing one of his own.

Yet Gould was tense and some
what undiplomatic in his replies. He
even seemed to notice his own abrupt
manner: "I'm sorry for being flippant
with your questions," he said.
Dick Gould wasn't about to open
up and freely discuss his prodigy from
New York. Gould clearly cares
deeply for McEnroe and doesn't want
him badgered by the press, especially
if the reporter wants only to question
Patrick about another Stanford tennis
alum, John McEnroe, the world's No.
1 tennis player.
It was only after these
preliminaries that things started to
get interesting. Gould on McEnroe
left something to be desired — only
McEnroe speaking on himself would
do.
And McEnroe was engaging enough
in his own right, surely worth
knowing for reasons other than his fa
mous surname and unique blood
lines. He's intelligent and artic
ulate, although a little shy, and his
distinctive skills between the
baselines merit attention in their own
right.

The New Yorker migrated west
with a long list of accomplishments on
the junior circuit. McEnroe was a mem
ber of America's Junior Davis Cup
team from 1983-84, and last year
captured the singles title at the Junior
Grass Court Championship and the
Junior Nationals in Michigan.
In other words, he came to Stan
ford already an established talent.
"All the juniors knew me and knew
me for my play," McEnroe said.
Once on the Farm, however, he
floundered early. In losing four of his
first seven dual-match singles con
tests, he was "losing to guys I never
heard of before," McEnroe said. "I
couldn't just walk on the court and
expect to win."
But he has improved noticeably
since, at times showing flashes of bril
liance. "I struggled all the way until
about halfway through the winter,"
McEnroe said. "But things are just
now starting to come around.
"My forehand has gotten better
and I've worked on the serve," he
noted. He couples those shots with a
two-handed backhand that Gould

describes as "one of the best I have
ever seen." And Gould has seen an
awful lot of high-caliber backhands in
his day.
After the rough initiation,
McEnroe has posted 16 singles vic
tories in his last 17 matches, including
10 straight. With that streak, the
freshman has vaulted from the sixth
to fourth singles spot on the varsity
ladder. "I still have a long way to go,"
McEnroe warned ominously.
Just how far can McEnroe go? In
evitably, the question conjures up
brother John. "It would be stupid for
me to try to emulate John. I've got to
be realistic. He's probably one of the
best, if not the best, to ever play the
game," McEnroe said with unmis
takable pride.
While his brother's successes must
please McEnroe, those same suc
cesses coupled with his brother's in
famous on-court antics have now and
then made McEnroe's life difficult.
But the freshman, in his own quiet
way, has taken the pressure in stride

Patrick McEnroe has been on fire as of late, winning 16 of his last 17
matches and 10 straight.
and handled it well. "A lot of people said I shouldn't go
here because of my brother," he said. "But 1 wanted to go
to the place that 1 wanted the most."
Gould helped McEnroe through the early, trying times,
and perhaps that explains Gould's paternalism and his re
luctance to discuss his pet player. "Having Coach (Gould)
has been real good," Patrick said. "He can blow them (the
reporters) off when they get in the way."
Like the time USA Today called McEnroe and asked
him about his brother's "love life." McEnroe has learned
that a few well-placed words can drive off even the most
stubborn of sleuths.
The press's meddling "can be a hassle, especially earlier
when 1 was struggling. I wanted to work on my game and
they were a distraction."
But there is a flip-side to the story. "When I'm playing
well, 1 don't mind the attention. In fact, I kind of enjoy
it," McEnroe said. "That's sort of selfish, I know.
His recent string of fine performances might explain
McEnroe's willingness to discuss his brother, but
McEnroe is convinced that his early on-court difficulties
reflected problems with mechanics and not problems
dealing with undue public scrutiny. "When you change
major parts of your game, it takes a while to adjust," he
said. "I'm only now starting to feel comfortable."
McEnroe's cool and confident off-court manner sug
gests that mechanics were indeed the real culprit, and not
the excessive limelight. He has tried to be just another
Stanford student, and succeeded to a surprising extent. By
all indications, he fits in well with the other team mem
bers. "Patrick has adjusted well to the team concept of
college tennis," Gould said.
McEnroe can be seen at times wearing a pair of
thoroughly Californian "baggies," so he fits right in. His
near crewcut, too, is completely in vogue. And after many
hours of hard work, the naturally fair-skinned Irishman's
tan is at least respectable.
And maybe that's the best way to compare McEnroe to
his brother. Patrick's tan is a whole lot better than pale
John's. Tans rather than forehands — that's the way
Patrick would like any comparison with John.
