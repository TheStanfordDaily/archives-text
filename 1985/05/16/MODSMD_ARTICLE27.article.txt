# Equestrians in first show
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN Editorial staff 
It's taken a long time, but the
school that stands on the former site
of Leland Stanford's horse farm will
finally be represented by a team in
the Farm-oriented sport of equita
tion. Three members of Stanford's
brand-new club sport are in Bur
hank's Griffith Park today for the Los
Angeles Equitation Center Spring
Hunter-Jumper Show, and their
teammates will be in Davis over the
weekend for West Coast Intercol
legiate Horse Show Association com
petition.
Mary Boyce, Annette Cholon and
Ries Robinson will ride for Stanford
in Burbank against a field which in
cludes UCLA, USC, California, Cal
State-Northridge and Arizona State.

The disadvantage of being a new
team will not be as great for the Card
inal equestrians as it might be for
beginning squads in other sports.
First, equitation is clearly a very
individual-oriented sport, and
second, intercollegiate equitation
has only been around for a very short
time itself — none of Stanford's com
petition will have much intercol
legiate experience either.
The equestrians will be judged in
three general categories. Perfor
mances in the hunter competition will
be judged on the smoothness of the
exhibition > — the way the horse
moves, the way it jumps and its over
all appearance.
In the jumper competition, the
horse and rider will receive their

marks depending on how many
mistakes they make, such as faults,
stops and knocking down poles. And
in the equitation category, the riders
will be judged on their appearance —
on how well they sit up and on the po
sition of their feet and legs.
The first-place rider and horse in
each category will receive seven
points, the runner-up will get five
points, and the third- through sixth
placers will score tour, three, two or
one. The top three finishers on
each team — there is a maximum of
five — will then combine their scores
to determine the team finish.
Membership on the team is open to
any Stanford student, faculty member
or alumnus who is not a professional
rider.
