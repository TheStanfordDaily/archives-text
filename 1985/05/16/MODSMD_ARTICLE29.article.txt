Dire Straits —
Brothers in Arms ★ ★ ★ x /i
Ever seen a cover of an album
that was so neat that you bought it
figuring it had to be an excellent,
classy album, and then you played
it and it wasn't? It was OK, of
course, but not nearly as neat as the
cover. Well, "Brothers in Arms"
looks classy. Nice sky blue cover,
with a silver Victorian bedwarmer
style guitar picture. "Also
Available on Compact Disc" on
the back. And when the stylus first
hits, excellent, excellent sound
quality. But wait. There's less. Less
guitar work from guru Mark

Knopfler. Less involved instrumen
tation. And there's more, too.
More keyboard emphasis. More
studio musicians. More of a full,
diverse instrumental sound. Dire
Straits has chosen a style different
from that of its first four albums —
more accessible, more conven
tional, more edible, less filling,
tastes great. OK, maybe it's less
satisfying than previous records, es
pecially classics like "Making
Movies" and "Love Over Gold."
Mark Knopfler's distaste for
"trumpet-playing bands" seems to
have diminished, and if he's ready
to make a transition, so be it, we're

ready to listen. So go ahead, Mark,
be yourself. It's beautiful.

The Dukes of Stratosphear —
25 O'Clock ★ ★ ★ ★
You'd never believe it. Fuzzy
guitars, mellotrons, vocals washed
away by all sorts of primitive
electronic effects. You'd never
think it was released after 1968 —
but it came out a couple of weeks
ago, copyright 1985. The Dukes of
Stratosphear play the psyche
delicest of musics, imitating per
fectly the styles of Syd Barrett-era
Pink Floyd, late Turtles, the
Beatles and whatever other groups
were around back then. You'd
swear it's a "long-lost master
tapes" collection like "VU" by the
Velvet Underground. But it's not.
Nope. Guess what it is. Go ahead.

This expertly crafted new old stuff
is from a) Ringo Starr, b) John
Fogerty. c) The Fleet Street Sing
ers. d) XTC. Okay, time's up. Pen

cils down. Stumped? No wonder. A
new wave band like d), XTC, relies
on synths and guitar and meaning
ful vocals and catchy pop styles and
all that other sorta '80s-ish stuff.
But it looks like this just-for-fun
project actually has some reality
behind it. XTC imitates the Found
ing Fathers so well that it comes off
entertaining, even slightly amazing.
Their parody of "I Am The
Walrus," for example, is incredibly
accurate, yet subtle enough to not
give it away immediately. That an
effort like this should come off so
well is a credit to both psychedelia
and XTC's talent, as well as a clear
indication that it should be bought
en masse.

Yellow jackets —
Samurai Samba * *Vi

First of all, the Yellowjackets
gotta lotta nerve putting vocals on a
fusion record. Rules are rules, and
you can't go around trying to be
adventurous if you're gonna be a
jazz-fusion band in 1985. Up until
now, the Yellowjackets were such
nice boys. They did everything just
like they were told, never trying to
cause any trouble, playing their
synths and well-miked drums and
rhythm guitar and bass just like
heroes Jeff Lorber and Spyro Gyra,
and you could depend on a Yellow
jackets album to sound the same
throughout. Consistently energetic,
cheerful, always in a major key,
never even the slightest hint of a

challenge. The Yellowjackets were
fusion and its fusedest. And there
was always that "digital recording"
to get the audiophiles going for
those clean, crisp sounds time after
time. Well, despite the Totovocals
and some minor instrumentation
changes, every song is the same,
slow or fast, loud or soft, on or off.
This is still formula fusion, and it
soon gets tiring. And if bands like
Lorber and the Jackets haven't yet
realized this, it's time for us to vote
with our pocketbooks and let them
know.
