Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons recently selected
seven more students to receive the 1984-85 Dean's
Awards for Service.
The seven students, three undergraduates and four
graduates, were selected for "exceptional service to Stan
ford University and to its students," according to the cita
tion that will appear on their certificates.
This exceptional service extended into all areas of Stan
ford life, ranging from the coordination of the World
Hunger Conference by undergraduate Sarah Von Der
Lippe, to the introduction of computers into student
residences by John Scoggins.
Other recipients include Nazir Ahmad, who established
the Stanford International Development Organization,
and David Ehrlich and Jeffrey Gelles, who co-directed the
Cerebral Palsy Sports Program, the first event of its kind
in Northern California.
Also, Jack Chin was awarded for his excellence as a res
ident assistant at Synergy House and service as editor of
the Stanford Quad, and Steve Leonhardt. also an RA. for
his service on the Task Force on Fraternities and
Sororities at Stanford and his "steadfast service to the
fraternal system and to the University.'
Von Der Lippe said she was surprised to receive the
award. "I wish there was a way to have the award go to all
the people who worked on the conference." she said.
Leonhardt views his award as positive press for fraterni
ties and sororities. "I was pleased to see that Dean Lyons
was recognizing some of the service that's going on in the
fraternities."
"You're not doing it for recognition, but when suddenly
and surprisingly you are recognized, it's a great feeling."
Gelles said. He also applauded the
Cerebral Palsy Sports Program for its suc
cess in consolidating the energies of a vari
ety of people with interests in the area.
Chin said that he thought he got his

award for his work as a co-op RA and his
time as editor of The Quad a few years ago
and as student editor of Approaching Stan
ford. He said that at this point he is not
worried about Synergy's uncertain position
as a result of the first round Draw results
and that he and the other residents "are
doing all we can" to fill the house. "A lot
of people don't give Synergy a chance."
