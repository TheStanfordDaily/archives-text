# Hilarious script and great cast blend in 'A Private Function'

### STEVE VINEBERG 
The English comedy of manners "A Private Function"
transpires in a small Yorkshire town in 1947, where the
continued rationing of food and gasoline has lent a new
color to the class struggles: To drive a car and serve ham
and pork at one's repast are signs of social distinction,
though (to a greater or lesser extent) everyone is suffering
some deprivation or indignity. In the context of the post
war economic darkness, the upcoming royal wedding has
acquired symbolic stature — a sign to the rest of the world
and to the English themselves that the country is operat
ing not just smoothly, but with a merry grace. In tribute to
this event, the leading socialites of this little town —
Lockwood the solicitor (John Normington), Swaby the
doctor (Denholm Elliott) and Allardyce the accountant
(Richard Griffiths) — plan a banquet for 150 invited
guests, representing the town's upper crust. Seeking to
evade the scrutiny of sharp-eyed Inspector Wormold (Bill
Paterson), who is employed by the Ministry of Food to
crack down on the black market traffic in meat, this trio
arranges with a local livestock farmer, Sutcliff (Tony
Haygarth), to raise an unlicensed pig for the celebratory
dinner.
At the other end of the social stratum is Gilbert Chil
vers (Michael Palin), an uncomplaining, hard-working
chiropodist who bikes everywhere he has clients, huffing
and puffing up the steep Yorkshire hills while Swaby
glides past him in his automobile. Gilbert's wife, Joyce
(Maggie Smith), supplements his income by playing the or
gan at the town cinema and giving piano lessons — one of
her pupils is Allardyce's sour-tempered daughter
Veronica (Amanda Gregan) — but still they cannot afford
to put proper meat on their table, and Joyce, who inclines
to aphorisms like "It's not just steak, it's status" and "It's
not just pork, it's power," reminds Gilbert constantly that
men like Swaby are holding him back. Finally, when
Swaby (who abhors Gilbert because he sees him as an
emblem of the rising lower middle class he will be obliged
to service with the advent of Medicare) denies him the
license he requires to open a downtown office, Gilbert
rebels and steals the very pig Swaby and his cohorts had
intended to butcher for their banquet.
As Alan Bennett has written him and Michael Palin (in
an uncharacteristically restrained performance) plays him,
Gilbert Chilvers is directly in the line of the obsessed
little-man protagonists of the comedies Britain's Ealing
Studios put out in the '50s, usually starring Alec Guinness
or Alastair Sim. (Palin, his tiny eyes darting, makes him
look fiercely supernormal, like an aging David Byrne.) A
good example is "The Lavender Hill Mob" (1951), in
which Guinness portrayed a bank clerk, self-described as
"fubsy," who steals 3 million pounds' worth of gold bul
lion, though the fact that one of the supporting characters
in "A Private Function" is named "Wormold" suggests
a nod to another Guinness film — the meek government
agent who invents spies to fill his reports with in the 1959
"Our Man in Havana," based on a Graham Greene novel.
Chilvers is also a variation on the henpecked husbands
W.C. Fields played in the '30s and early '40s, with Maggie
Smith as the absurdly haute social-climbing wife. But
when Betty the pig, to whom Gilbert feels a special kin
ship after he has removed a nail from her paw, is roaming
the Chilvers cottage and Joyce hands her demurring hus
band the nearest "weapon" at hand (an instrument from
his chiropodist's kit), demanding that he kill the beast, we
can see what Bennett and the director, Malcolm Mowbray
(who co-authored the story), have in mind: not really
"Androcles and the Pig" at all, but a burlesque
"Macbeth."
The movie doesn't take off right away — not because

it's slow in starting, but because the combination of a
hefty cast of characters and a variety of brogues (Bill
Paterson, who played the melancholy disc jockey in Bill
Forsyth's "Comfort and Joy," gives Wormold a precisely
rounded, comic-opera Scottish accent) requires some get
ting used to. But it gets funnier and funnier as it bounds
along. Food is the subject of much of the dialogue, and
Bennett and Mowbray show us every character in some
kind of relationship with it: Joyce's wobbly, distracted
mother (Liz Smith) is always hungry, while Mrs. Al
lardyce chomps black market chocolates casually, tossing
away half-eaten the ones that don't gratify her taste. Al
lardyce himself is fatuously chubby-faced, and he and the
plump, bespectacled Veronica are a cartoon father-and
daughter match, like Robert and Annabel Morley in "An
Outcast of the Islands." The filmmakers ring surprising
changes on this motif. The fastidious, fish-eyed inspector
has no sense of taste (or smell). Furthermore, the title of
the picture refers not only to the banquet for which Betty
is being surreptitiously fattened, but also to the pig's
chronic diarrhea, a juicier comic idea than one would have
imagined, treated indirectly (entirely in the disgusted
grimaces on the Chilvers' faces) as it is here.
Malcolm Mowbray is not a very interesting director; he
has a television background ("A Private Function" is his
feature film debut), and it shows. But Stuart Walker, the
production designer, has aided him considerably by sup
plying delightful period touches, such as the desperately
trying-to-be-elegant facade of the hotel where the dinner
is to take place and the antique organ Joyce plays at the
local moviehouse. The major virtues of the picture,
however, are Alan Bennett's hilarious script and the cast,
who take Dickensian relish in filling out their wonderful
roles and who actually succeed in holding their own when
Betty the pig (an imperially funny camera subject ob
tained, evidently, from an organization known as Intellec
tual Animals, Ltd.) is on screen. As well as Michael Palin,
Bill Paterson, that unfailingly superb character actor Den
holm Elliott in the comic villain role of Dr. Swaby, young
Amanda Gregan, and Philip Wileman as a carelessly cold-


Michael Palin, Betty the pig and Maggie Smith star
in u A Private Function," now playing at the Fine
Arts Theatre in Palo Alto.
