## Jesuit's philosophy survey huge, valuable 
### A History of Philosophy" By Frederick Copleston 
Doubleday, in three volumes,
$16.95 each
One certainly cannot criticize Fred
erick Copleston, the author of "A
History of Philosophy," for the nar
rowness of his knowledge. However,
1 must proceed to discuss him through
the narrowness of my own. Copies
ton, a Jesuit priest, has assembled his
massive life-work into an attractive
three-volume set, published by
Doubleday: There are about 4,500
pages of explaining, in a more or less
evenhanded way, the key thinkers in
the Western Philosophical tradition,
from Thales and Heraclitus to Sartre
and Wittgenstein. The books are an
undisputed and awesome achieve
ment. Written in a clear phlegmatic
style, they display an assured mastery
over their material, and they will no
doubt remain a standard reference
work for decades, valuable additions
to the libraries of literature, history
and anthropology students as well as
to the libraries of philosophy stu
dents.
(One caveat should be mentioned
right away: This is not a history of
philosophy so much as it is one of
Western philosophy. Oriental and In
dian thinkers, for example, are not
discussed.)
There are many histories of philos

ophy, and they divide themselves, I
think, into three kinds. First, there
are the encyclopedic treatments, in
which an editor gathers articles from
several experts in the field of their
specialty. Those experts — usually
philosophers themselves, or

academics, not that the distinction
makes much sense these days— often
provide so-called state-of-the-art pre
sentations of their subject in a way
more intense or precise than more
generalized histories can. The best
example of this kind of history would

be the massive, scholarly
"Encyclopedia of Philosophy."
The drawback with the en
cyclopedic approach is that no single
point of view pervades the work,
which makes measuring the critiques
of one article against another article

difficult. Thus, the greater depth
and precision this approach supplies
is gained at the expense of presenting
a single vision, a synthesis.
Such a synthesis is easier to
achieve, not surprisingly, in a work
written by a single author, and of this

category there are two types. The first
is best exemplified by Bertrand Rus
sell's classic "A History of Western
Philosophy," published at the end of
World War 11. Russell surveys
philosophical thought from Thales to
Whitehead from an openly polemical
position. For it is Russell's purpose to
show how the 3,000 years in
which Western philosophy has
flourished has culminated in, well, his
own ideas. So from this admittedly
superior stance, Russell has no prob
lem in whacking early greats. For ex
ample, of Descartes, Berkeley. Kant
and Fichte ("for whom everything is
only an emanation of the ego") he
writes that "their work was insanity,
and from this extreme, philosophy
has been attempting ever since to
escape into the world of everyday
common sense." For Russell, com
mon sense means scrapping the "fog
of metaphysics," giving up the quest
to figure out the insoluble problems
of man's existence in favor of trying
to know what might actually be
knowable, with the precise and
"objective methods of logical analy
sis."
Not only can Russell magnetize his
survey with his strong biases, but he
ends his work with a clear political
prescription. If the logical result of
continental philosophy is subjec

tivism and anarchy, then logical anal
ysis, correctly applied, should lead to
a reasonable liberalism. "The essence
of liberalism is an attempt to secure a
social order not based on irrational
dogma, and insuring stability without
involving more restraints than are ne
cessary for the preservation of the
community. Whether this attempt can
succeed," he notes, "only the future
can determine."
The third category of history, into
which Copleston's work pretty much
fits, is one which claims to be written
from a position of little or no bias.
Copleston is not a philosopher him
self, and he offers no contemporary
political analysis. Which means, here,
that the bias is merely more subtle,
untrumpeted but pervasive. "My
chief motive for writing the book," he
says, "has been that of supplying
Catholic ecclesiastic seminaries with a
work that should be somewhat more
detailed and of wider scope than the
textbooks commonly in use and
which at the same time should en
deavor to exhibit the logical devel
opment and inter-connection of
philosophical systems."
Copleston therefore tends to view
scholastic philosophy (that is, thought
that flourished when the Catholic
church was at its peak of power and
influence) as philosophy's greatest
achievement. And Copleston often
apologizes for philosophy's inferiority
to religion: "There is a great differ
ence between the true (revealed) reli

gion and the true philosophy, that
whereas the former, as revealed, is
neeessarily true in its totality, the true
philosophy may be true in its main
lines without reaching completion."
So Copleston has a hard time
dealing with someone like Russell
(author of "Why I Am Not a Chris
tian") — he admits that "it is indeed
natural that those of us who hold tirm
beliefs which are very different from
his and which he has attacked, should
deplore certain aspects of his influ
ence." And, as you might guess, the
Jesuit's treatment of Nietzsche is curt
and unenthusiastic. In any case, it is
to Copleston's credit that his personal
religious preferences usually do not
so blatantly intrude upon his discus
sions. His exposition of the
philosophies of Greece and Rome,
the medieval systems and Kant are
balanced and detailed. Indeed, the
portions of this work which have ap
peared in earlier years have provided
thousands of students with shortcuts
into the work of Aristotle and
Aquinas (with little injustice). Here,
Copleston's readable explanations
are without peer.
One handy feature of these
volumes is the extended bibliography
of the philosophers' own work and of
important scholarly studies on the
work. Since "A History of Philoso
phy" should be around for decades, 1
hope that in the future Doubleday
will issue supplementary updates of
the bibliography in order to include
more recent scholarship.
