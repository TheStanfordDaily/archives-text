## Jesuit's philosophy survey huge, valuable 
### A History of Philosophy" By Frederick Copleston 
Doubleday, in three volumes,
$16.95 each
One certainly cannot criticize Fred
erick Copleston, the author of "A
History of Philosophy," for the nar
rowness of his knowledge. However,
1 must proceed to discuss him through
the narrowness of my own. Copies
ton, a Jesuit priest, has assembled his
massive life-work into an attractive
three-volume set, published by
Doubleday: There are about 4,500
pages of explaining, in a more or less
evenhanded way, the key thinkers in
the Western Philosophical tradition,
from Thales and Heraclitus to Sartre
and Wittgenstein. The books are an
undisputed and awesome achieve
ment. Written in a clear phlegmatic
style, they display an assured mastery
over their material, and they will no
doubt remain a standard reference
work for decades, valuable additions
to the libraries of literature, history
and anthropology students as well as
to the libraries of philosophy stu
dents.
(One caveat should be mentioned
right away: This is not a history of
philosophy so much as it is one of
Western philosophy. Oriental and In
dian thinkers, for example, are not
discussed.)
There are many histories of philos

ophy, and they divide themselves, I
think, into three kinds. First, there
are the encyclopedic treatments, in
which an editor gathers articles from
several experts in the field of their
specialty. Those experts — usually
philosophers themselves, or

academics, not that the distinction
makes much sense these days— often
provide so-called state-of-the-art pre
sentations of their subject in a way
more intense or precise than more
generalized histories can. The best
example of this kind of history would

be the massive, scholarly
"Encyclopedia of Philosophy."
The drawback with the en
cyclopedic approach is that no single
point of view pervades the work,
which makes measuring the critiques
of one article against another article

difficult. Thus, the greater depth
and precision this approach supplies
is gained at the expense of presenting
a single vision, a synthesis.
Such a synthesis is easier to
achieve, not surprisingly, in a work
written by a single author, and of this

category there are two types. The first
is best exemplified by Bertrand Rus
sell's classic "A History of Western
Philosophy," published at the end of
World War 11. Russell surveys
philosophical thought from Thales to
Whitehead from an openly polemical
position. For it is Russell's purpose to
show how the 3,000 years in
which Western philosophy has
flourished has culminated in, well, his
own ideas. So from this admittedly
superior stance, Russell has no prob
lem in whacking early greats. For ex
ample, of Descartes, Berkeley. Kant
and Fichte ("for whom everything is
only an emanation of the ego") he
writes that "their work was insanity,
and from this extreme, philosophy
has been attempting ever since to
escape into the world of everyday
common sense." For Russell, com
mon sense means scrapping the "fog
of metaphysics," giving up the quest
to figure out the insoluble problems
of man's existence in favor of trying
to know what might actually be
knowable, with the precise and
"objective methods of logical analy
sis."
Not only can Russell magnetize his
survey with his strong biases, but he
ends his work with a clear political
prescription. If the logical result of
continental philosophy is subjec
