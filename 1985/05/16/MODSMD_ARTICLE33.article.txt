# 'Reasons to Live' isn't much worth living for
## 
### Reasons to Live" By Amy Hempel 
Fear not, ye literati who have con
sidered suicide in this post-literary
generation. Slim, photogenic Amy
Hempel has given us a slim,
photogenic book of short fictions
aptly titled "Reasons to Live."
Not that the book itself is some
thing to live for. Rather, Hempel
shows the writer that there's plenty of
room out there for improve
ment. "Reasons to Live" is a collec
tion of new things done badly.
Hempel likes to write about the im
portant things in life — namely,
death. She likes to write about it in a
way that makes you unsure who in
the story is alive and who dies. So you
read the story over again, look for
clues, of which there are few, and so
called subtleties, of which there are
many. You read the story one more
time, and then make some arbitrary
decision about what it means. And
then you don't care.
Reading the first few stories, I
admired Hempel's use of language,
her taut narratives. I supposed that
after I read a few more things I would
be drawn into her bizarre but
seemingly interesting world. No go.
The writer of these stories stands
solidly as a wall between the reader
and what is written; even when the
first person is used, one feels Hem
pel's oppressive presence.
The problem is that there seems to
be a conspiracy between the writer
and the pen, a conspiracy that the

reader is supposed to envy, but never
crack. There are pretty words and
pretty passages, which make for a lot
of aesthetic reading. But far too
much is sacrificed to make the stories
"pretty" — a commitment to the
characters, a commitment ot the nar
rative, and a commitment to truth are
some of the larger things wanting.
If you don't know what I mean by
this, read Raymond Carver at his very
worst. Like Carver, Hempel tends to
respect her characters far less than
she respects herself. But we don't
know Hempel, so we can't care about
her. And we can't care about the
people in her stories because our
knowledge of them is too shaky.
One story, "Celia Is Back," reads
like a Carver parody. Here we have a
father who is either crazy or dying, a
pair of children who are either
worried about him or frightened of
him. Or maybe the story merely
depicts a man on the way to take his
driving test. 1 don't remember.
Well, you might argue, what if
Hempel doesn't want us to know any
thing about her characters? I'm call
ing this bad realist fiction, but what if
she's not trying to write the stuff?
It's a valid argument, granted, but
if one reads the book jacket, it seems
that Hempel is trying to move us.
And move us with emotional content,
not merely virtuoso technique. In
"When It's Human Instead of When
It's Dog," Hempel talks about a man
whose wife has just died, who is dis
turbed by the large, wet body stain
she left on the floor, and in "The
Cemetery Where A 1 Jolson Is

Buried," she depicts a girl who visits
her dying best friend.
There are sad people in these
stories, but when they cry they turn
their faces away from the page so we
can't see them. One suspects Hempel
doesn't want to show us pain. Because
these people are more attractive as
syntactical arrangements then as
human beings, a description of their
pain isn't as "gorgeous" as a simple
choreography of their activities.
The characters in "Reasons to
Live" do and say things that Hempel
suggests are abnormal, but their ac
tions are almost always shrugged off
by the fictional characters. In "Pool
Night," when a boy covers himself
with gasoline and jumps off a diving
board, his friend simply runs a home
movie camera. If this boy is going to
burn himself to death, then either
Hempel or the characters she has
created ought to care. As it is, the
stories aren't even sinister in their in
difference towards disaster; they're
just empty.
I'm not suggesting that Hempel has
to write about suffering, that she has
to suffer to write. I hope there's room
in the world for literature spun
from things other then angst. But if
Hempel wants to write about sad
people and sad things, she should
care about them a little bit. Other
wise, her "Reasons To Live" are
about as effective as a Hallmark card
sent to someone sitting on the electric
chair. So pretty. Try again.

their faces away from the page so we
can't see them. One suspects Hempel
doesn't want to show us pain. Because
these people are more attractive as
syntactical arrangements then as
human beings, a description of their
pain isn't as "gorgeous" as a simple
choreography of their activities.
The characters in "Reasons to
Live" do and say things that Hempel
suggests are abnormal, but their ac
tions are almost always shrugged off
by the fictional characters. In "Pool
Night," when a boy covers himself
with gasoline and jumps off a diving
board, his friend simply runs a home
movie camera. If this boy is going to
burn himself to death, then either
Hempel or the characters she has
created ought to care. As it is, the
stories aren't even sinister in their in
difference towards disaster; they're
just empty.
I'm not suggesting that Hempel has
to write about suffering, that she has
to suffer to write. I hope there's room
in the world for literature spun
from things other then angst. But if
Hempel wants to write about sad
people and sad things, she should
care about them a little bit. Other
wise, her "Reasons To Live" are
about as effective as a Hallmark card
sent to someone sitting on the electric
chair. So pretty. Try again.

Amy Hempel's "Reasons to Live" is about as effective as a Hallmark card sent to someone sitting on the
electric chair.
