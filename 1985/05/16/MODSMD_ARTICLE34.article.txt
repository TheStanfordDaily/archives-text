# Europe for the offensive male

### Europe: Where the Fun Is" By Rollin Riggs Bruce Jacobsen 
Mustang Publishing, 174 pp.,
$7.95
So you're going to Europe this
summer.
The Eiffel Tower. Buckingham
Palace. Chartes Catherdral. A visit to
the Louvre.
Sure. We know why you're going to
Europe. Or at least Rollin Riggs and
Bruce Jacobsen do. These two ex-
Stanfordites just put together a book
about the real Europe. Here are all
the places that the Michelin Guide
won't list, the places you'll scour the
back streets and bad neighboorhoods
to find.
Drugs. Whores. Bars. Where to get
that cute sweater. It's all in the pages
of "Europe: Where The Fun Is."
What isn't here is any of that tacky
cultural stuff that's in all the other
travel guides. Just "the wildest bars,
the hottest beaches, the cheapest flea
markets . . . anything and everything
(sic) that's fun in the major cities in
Europe."
The authors cite 14 "fun" cities
and eight "hot" beaches. Each place
is briefly described, then the authors
offer more specific listings of the fun
stuff.
The descriptions transform all of
Europe into a series of badly printed
picture postcards. Venice is "a pic
turesque maze of tiny alleys and ca
nals, exquisite hand-blown glass,
friendly neighbors and, of course, the
gondolas," but the authors say that if
you look carefully, "you'll have no
problem finding some off-beat ad
venture, some relatively unspoiled
beauty, and maybe some relatively
unspoiled beauties."
The listings themselves are pretty
interesting, though I hope they're not
as exhaustive as the claim to be. It
would be pretty depressing if Berlin
really had only as many hot spots as
downtown Palo Alto.
Also, despite the fact that the back
cover claims that there are "no
hotels, no museums, no historic
sights" in this book, I did find a listing
for Venice's Grand Canal, "an inte
gral part of Venice's historic charm,"
Paris' Le Centre Pompidou and
Musee Rodin, and the Palme Hotel at
Cinque Terre beach.
Also, though this book is pegged as
a traveler's guide, about half the
travelers I know would find it useless.
This is a book written by and for men.
The cover displays a drawing of map
of Europe with a naked, gartered leg
jutting out, and certain chapters
could be subtitled "how to pick up or
buy women who don't speak your
own language." I guess I can't really

expect the authors to pay much
serious attention to women; they
know so little about them, it seems.
But the Playboy approach to the Old
World just doesn't thrill me.
I think it's starting to sound like
I'm against fun. I'm not. I like fun.
Sometimes I even have fun. I can see
the need for a book about fun places
to go in Europe. I've read enough
travel guides by givers of Audobon
slide shows to understand why
people our age (my age) would leave
Michelin in their suitcases and go off
in search of McDonald's.
I guess what I'm looking for is
balance. Is it too much to assume that

a travel guide could miss the carnal
and the cultural without producing
sensory overload? I get kind of
queasy at the thought of the authors
dancing at another Parisian night
club, checking out another nude
beach, "exploring the best bars in
Amsterdam," and later learning that
"a wink at the attractive blond at the
next table transcends all cultural bar
riers." Don't they realize that this is
the kind of tourist that chases
Europeans out of their cities all sum
mer long?
This book isn't as bad as it is an
noying. If it were terribly written
(which it isn't) or utterly useless

(which it isn't), I'd be happy, because
then I'd know that not many people
would pay attention to it. But a lot of
effort went into this book, the authors
aren't stupid, and some of the infor
mation is good. So undoubtably the
philosophy will appeal to some
people, and they'll go have hangovers
in Hamburg, drop acid in Amster
dam, have a quickie in Copenhagen,
piss off some Europeans and go
home avoiding all of that museum,
history, culture garbage.
Too bad.
