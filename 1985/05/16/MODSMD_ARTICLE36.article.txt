## Fellowship supplies key experience 
### EVELYN UHLIG Staff writer 
The John S. Knight fellowship program, which
allows professional journalists to study at Stanford
tor a year, will celebrate its 20th anniversary during
the 1985-86 academic year. The anniversary not
only marks the program's longevity, but will also
introduce a new director for the program.
James Risser, former Washington bureau chief
of The Des Moines Register, will take over for out
going Director Lyle Nelson. Risser, who went
through the program during 1973-74, described
it as "a mind-broadening experience" in which a
fellow comes into contact with people he wouldn't
normally encounter.
The education received through the program en
riches the career of a journalist on various levels,
according to Managing Director Harry Press. A
journalist may meet experts who are able to pro
vide information for stories, he said.
Press cited an example in which former fellow
Don Colburn, a health-care reporter for The
Washington Post, attended a seminar with a geron
tologist during his fellowship. Later, when Colburn
was writing a story on the problems of aging, he
remembered the seminar and interviewed the
scientist.
In addition, the education increases a journalist's
background on various issues. A journalist is able

to take courses in a specific area, arms control for
example, to specialize his knowledge.
During their sabbatical. Knight and international
fellows follow independent courses of study. All at
tend required seminars, which feature guest
speakers from various fields.
Each of the 12 Knight fellows receives a $20,000
stipend during his nine months of study, although
the stipends for international fellows vary. Tuition
and fees are paid by the program, which is managed
through the Department of Communication.
Knight fellowships are awarded to American
journalists, and are funded with a $4 million grant
from the Knight Foundation. International fellow
ships are funded by other sources, including the
Reuter Foundation and the German Marshall
Fund.
This year's competition was the stiffest ever, with
82 applications filed, according to Risser and Nel
son. Nelson mentioned that there are "too few op
portunities of this kind for the mid-career jour
nalist," and added that although many journalism
programs stress technique, the Knight fellowship
program works toward a better knowledge base.
He also said many journalists in the program
have moved on to top positions in the media. Es
teban Wissenger, the chief of the foreign news sec
tion of Hungarian television, and Feng Xiliang, the
editor in chief of the China Daily, were both Stan

ford journalism fellows.
Former fellow Marciej Wierzynski gave a guest
lecture on journalism in Poland to last year's fel
lows. Wierzynski is the former editor in chief of
Kultura, the leading weekly journal in Poland,
which was closed by that nation's military regime.
At one of the hearings when the journal was closed,
Wierzynski said he "would rather he a taxi driver
than a cog in the propaganda machine." Until he
left the nation a few years later, he became a taxi
driver. Wiernyzski plans to return to Poland in
July.
International fellow Paulynn Sicam, a freelance
journalist from the Philippines, has studied political
subjects this year for a better understanding of how
the actions of powerful nations affect Third World
countries. "The value of my stay here is getting into
the American mind so l can better understand
where the American government is coming from,"
she said.
Besides pursuing her studies, Sicam has also
given numerous speeches on campus about condi
tions in the Philippines.
Knight fellow Jon Funabiki, assistant news editor
of the San Diego Union, used the program to "dig
into a subject" and specialize in that area. His
topic. East Asian studies, focuses on technological
