## SOSA will free cars at noon 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
Stanford Out of South Africa
(SOSA) announced yesterday that a
group of approximately 35 students
will end the two-day blockade of trus
tees' cars today at noon.
SOSA also called on University ad
ministrators to "begin drafting their
own proposals for divestment" to be
voted on at the June 14 meeting of
the Board of Trustees.
The blockade began late Tuesday
morning after the board met and
decided not to support total divest
ment of University holdings in com
panies that do business in South
Africa. The 14 cars, some of which
are rented, are parked on Serra Street
near the Hoover Institution.
A statement released by SOSA on
behalf of the student protesters, who
call themselves the Civil Dis
obedience Group, said the blockade
"has been successful" and "is effec
tively forcing the trustees to recog
nize the seriousness of our concerns.
"We now wish to move to a
dialogue with individual trustees,"
the release said.
Trustees may pick up their cars be
tween noon and 3 p.m. today, accord
ing to the statement, at which time
"members of SOSA will be present to
provide them with further educa
tional materials and to discuss mat

ters of concern informally on a one
to-one basis."
SOSA members say they do not
consider the move to end the block
ade a defeat. "1 don't see it in any
way as backing down," SOSA mem
ber Laurie Edelstein said. She said
the intention of the blockade was to
"personally confront the trustees"
and get them to "individually respond
to the issue."
Earlier in the day, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy told The Daily
that the University was watching the
civil disobedience "hour by hour,"
but would not speculate at what point
arrests might come as a result of the
blockade.
Kennedy said that in the anti
apartheid protests across the country,
"chic arrests" have caused the idea of
civil disobedience "considerable
devaluation over the last two
months."
Kennedy also said the most recent
SOSA demand to have eight student
members on the the board is one that
has been brought up a number of
times in the past 20 years. He said
this demand "came rather late in the
game" of the current protests, and
that if the board were to become a
constituency organization, it would
not be able to adequately "look out

Police barrier tape, a parking permit and a fake parking ticket adorn
one of the cars Stanford Out of South Africa (SOSA) members have
detained on Serra Steet since Tuesday. The fake tickets, which SOSA
members placed on the trustees' cars* charge trustees with committing a
"violation of human rights" by not voting for total divestment.
