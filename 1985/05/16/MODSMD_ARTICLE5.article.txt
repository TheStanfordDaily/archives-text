# Prof. pans military research funds
## 
### LYNN MARCUS Staff writer 
The dramatic increase in the proportion of
nationwide university research funded by the De
partment of Defense in recent years constitutes a
"dangerous trend toward increased militarization,"
according to Terry Winograd, associate professor
of computer science and linguistics.
Winograd, a member of the national board and
the executive committee of the arms control adv
ocate group Computer Professionals for Social Re
sponsibility, warned an audience of 17 at Turing
Auditorium in Jordan Quad yesterday of the harm
to society and to universities that could be caused
by such a trend.
Among the effects of increased military funding
of computer research, Winograd said; are a distor
tion of the balance of research and learning at uni
versities, restrictions on the flow of information
and the legitimization of military projects such as
President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative
(SDI), commonly known as the "Star Wars" proj
ect.
Winograd said the idea that the military has a
role to play in promoting basic science research
grew out of World War II and remained unques
tioned by the public until the Vietnam War era.
In the late 1960s and early '70s, Winograd said,

there was a "big push to get military research off
campus," and at Stanford, student protests forced a
severing of relations between the University and
the Stanford Research Institute.
In order to reverse the trend, Winograd sugges
ted that researchers take action individually by
refusing to participate in certain projects and by
seeking less easily attainable sources of funding.
Such "local and unglamorous acts," although
frustrating, may be important in changing the
climate throughout the country and in congress, he
said.
"There's no logical reason the NSF (National
Science Foundation) couldn't have a huge pro
gram" as do non-military government agencies in
other developed nations, he added.
But Winograd said there has been a "gradual
easing back out of the confrontational mode and
over the years it (military funding) became pretty
much a non-issue."
Two key events which result from and have con
tributed to the trend are the allocation in recent
years of $500 million for the Strategic Computing
Program of the Defense Advanced Research Proj
ect Agency and the creation of SDI.
Winograd said he believes it is dangerous when
"more and more of the economy is in fact con
trolled by money being funnelled through the mili

tary agencies" even if some of the results of the
research has socially beneficial applications.
Even when researchers claim to be using military
funding for non-defense related research,
Winograd said, the source of the funding can limit a
professor's choice of topics and distort the empha
sis of research in favor of "hard technology," re
sulting in "opportunity costs." He said more
products beneficial for civilian purposes may often
be produced if the funding comes from non
military sources such as the agency of Housing and
Urban Development or the NSF.
"The fact that they (military agencies) are fund
ing research which might alternatively be funded,
say by the NSF, has an impact even if in the end the
exact same research gets done," he said.
Another reason the trend is undesirable is the
"subtle social effects" it causes, such as the in
creased legitimacy that universities lend to military
projects through their participation, he said.
Negative effects on universities include questions
that arise regarding control over resources used for
military research, restrictions on the flow of infor
mation, and the potential for imbalance in aca
demic areas.
"Do we want to become the MIT of the West?"
Winogrand asked.
