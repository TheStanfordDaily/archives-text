# Critic links Stanford to nuclear problems

### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Staff writer 
"Nuclear weapons are not the problem; the
military is the problem," said nuclear critic
Peter Faulkner last night in the first of a series
of SWOPSI lectures entitled "Ethics and Tech
nology for the 21st Century." Faulkner, a lec
turer at Stanford since 1977, discussed the in
fluence of nuclear power on weaponry, the en
vironment. energy and its effect on Stanford as
an industry.
"We are confronting a military organization
that, if it goes through its cycle, it will destroy it
self — the environment and the world — be
cause that is what it is trained to do," Faulkner
said.
He attributed the military's frustration to the
"existence of nuclear weapons, which for the
past 40 years has stopped war in its tracks."
Faulkner added that the peace movement has
augmented the military's discontent.
Many peace movement supporters have not
served in the military and have "yet to come to
terms with reality. ... All of the positive, well
articulated reforms involve taking the control of
nuclear weapons away from the military."
The peace movement hopes to get a nuclear
freeze passed by Congress to "dilute" the mili
tary's exclusive authority over nuclear weapons,
Faulkner said. Those who have yet to make flag
rank are "antsy" about their future military
control over nuclear weapons, he added.
Faulkner discussed the influence of U.S. oil

companies on the emergence of nuclear power
as a major industry. In Faulkner's new book,
"Journey of the Skeptic," he argues that there
was huge interest and momentum for the nu
clear industry to come into being by oil compan
ies, such as Gulf Oil, which led to illegal politi
cal contributions from these companies.
In the mid-19405, Faulkner explained. U.S
oil companies bought 52 percent ot the uranium
market, with the expectation that the govern
ment would need uranium for the building of
nuclear weapons. What the oil companies failed
to realize was that it was much more efficient
for the government to make the weapons out of
plutonium, he said.
Starting in the early 19605, Gulf spent ap
proximately $13 million in bribes to govern
ment officials in 13 years to establish a strong
U.S. nuclear industry. If enough money camc to
senators such as Howard Baker (R-Tenn.) or
Henry Jackson (D-Wa.), government legisla
tion was therefore "tainted," and the "entire
(nuclear) industry is retroactively unconstitu
tional," he said.
Faulkner quoted the Feb. 11 issue of Forbes
magazine: "The failure of the U.S. nuclear
power program ranks as the largest managerial
disaster in business history, a disaster on a
monumental scale," the article said. "The utility
industry has already invested $ 125 billion in nu
clear power, with an additional $140 billion to
come before the decade is out, and
only the blind, or the biased, can now
think that most of the money has
been well spent."
He addeu that today's engineers
who are responsible for managing the
nuclear industry are "second class"
and tend to be "incompetent."
Yet, Stanford is ultimately affected

and influenced by the government
and these corporations "to keep it
afloat," Faulker said. "People are ad
mitted to Stanford based on how suc
cessful they are going to be and how
much money they are going to
make." Stanford is going to shy away
from the heretics and non
conformists, he added.
Faulkner continued that "Stanford,
in order to survive ... is having prob
lems remaining separated from the
government." The more it gets ab
sorbed into the government, "the
more it becomes like it."
