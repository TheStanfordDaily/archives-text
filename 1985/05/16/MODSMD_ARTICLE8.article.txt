U.N. Irish relief official abducted
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Eight heavily armed men in combat fatigues
abducted an Irish relief official yesterday, forcing his U.N. station wagon
to a halt on a seafront boulevard and shoving him into one of their cars.
Rival militias battled with artillery, rockets and machine guns in their
18th day of open war along the line that divides Beirut into Christian
and Moslem sectors. Police reported at least nine people killed and 22
wounded.
Aidan Walsh, 49, was abducted in a swift, well-organized operation in
Moslem west Beirut that took less than two minutes, his driver said.
Mahmoud Ghanem said the kidnappers were in two cars. One cut in
front of Walsh's white station wagon, which was emblazoned with the
U.N. insignia and flew a blue U.N. flag, and the other blocked the road
behind.
Six gunmen armed with AK-47 assault rifles and pistols jumped out,
leaving two armed drivers in the cars, Ghanem told The Associated
Press.
The driver, a Palestinian, said two gunmen covered the street and four
surrounded the station wagon. When the driver protested, one gunman
smashed the windshield with the metal butt of his rifle.
Walsh has for two years been deputy director of the Vienna-based
U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which aids Palestinians in Lebanese
refugee camps.
There was no claim of responsibility. The Rauoche sector is controlled
by the Shiite Moslem militia Amal and Druse fighters, but other Moslem
groups have carried out kidnappings there.
Walsh's wife, two sons and a daughter live in Dublin.
He was the second UNRWA employee abducted in Lebanon in recent
weeks. British journalist Alec Collett, 63, was kidnapped in southern
Beirut on Mar. 25 while on a writing assignment for the agency.
Collett, the last Western kidnap victim until Walsh, was seized one
week after gunmen abducted Terry Anderson, 37, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press.
At least 13 Westerners have been held captive by various groups since
March last year. Four of them, two Britons and two French citizens, have
been freed.
A Dutch Roman Catholic priest, Nicolas Kluiters, 44, was found
strangled April 1, two weeks after he disappeared in the Bekaa Valley. It
has not been established whether he was a kidnap victim.
Shultz: summit meeting not set
SHANNON, Ireland — U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz, flying
home to report on his Mideast mission and talks with Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko, said yesterday that "no time or place " has
been set for a U.S.-Soviet summit.
But Shultz apparently made some headway toward setting up peace
talks between Israel and a mixed Palestinian-Jordanian delegation.
Reacting to a statement by Yasser Arafat, chairman of the the
Palestine Liberation Organization, that edged closer toward conditional
acceptance of Israel, Shultz said, "possibly the attitude of the Pales
tinians has been shifting some."
Shultz said "it's good" there now were direct references to Israel and
to U.N. Security Council Resolution 242, which asserts Israel's right to
exist within secure boundaries.
But on the Soviet segment of his trip — three exchanges in Vienna,
Austria, with Gromyko, one lasting six hours— Shultz did not claim any
particular accomplishments.
He said little on the issue of a possible meeting this year between
Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet leader.
Shultz told reporters traveling with him, "The situation remains as it
has been. The two leaders have exchanged messages saying the summit
meeting would be a good idea. No time or place has been set."
Shultz and Gromyko were in Vienna yesterday to celebrate a rare suc
cess story in the history of superpower bargaining — the 30th anniver
sary of the Austrian State Treaty. The treaty, signe J May 15,1955, after
nine years of haggling by'the United States, Britain, France and the So
viet Union, ended the four powers' occupations of Austria, which had
become part of the Nazi Germany in 1938.
Shultz said that after their talks, Gromyko now had a "clear idea of
our views" on arms control and other issues, but Shultz gave no indica
tion he had gained any concession from the Soviet foreign minister.
Asked if there could be progress when talks resume May 30 in Geneva
on nuclear weapons and space-based defense, Shultz said, "We'll just
have to see how things work out."
Gromyko insisted progress depended on "strict adherence" by the
United States to an agreement he reached with Shultz in Geneva in Jan
uary that President Reagan's "Star Wars" program would be discussed
in tandem with curbs on offensive nuclear weapons.
The Reagan administration has insisted on going ahead with research
on anti-missile defense but has said there would have to be negotiations
with the Soviets before any systems were deployed.
Shultz told reporters before he left Vienna's Schwechat Airport for
home that he was coming away with the idea that "negotiations work."
Legionnaires' disease claims 37
STAFFORD, London — Health authorities said yesterday they
hoped the outbreak of Legionnaires' disease that has claimed 37 lives
would end in a few days. It is believed to be the world's highest death toll
from the virulent illness.
An 80-year-old man died of the pneumonia-like illness in Stafford's
Kingsmead Hospital yesterday, raising the death toll to 37. Two more
people with symptoms of the disease were admitted to Stafford District
General Hospital, which is believed to be the source of the infection.
Fifty-eight people remained hospitalized with Legionnaires'
symptoms, and two people were reported in poor condition.
Dr. John Gibson, who is treating Legionnaires' patients, said,
"Assuming that the hospital is the source of the outbreak, we should be
clear of the incubation period at the end of this week."
Blood tests showed that six of the hospital's nurses who had worked in
the outpatient area have the disease bacterium in their bloodstreams.
The discovery of the bacterium in the six nurses tended to confirm that
the outbreak originated in the hospital, said Jim Bartlett, general
manager of the Mid-Staffordshire Health Authority.
Soviet plane disappears over Japan
TOKYO — The government said an aircraft that disappeared off the
Soviet coast earlier today belonged to the Soviet airline Aeroflot.
Japan Defense Agency sources, who spoke on condition they were not
identified, said the plane vanished from Japanese military radar screens
while flying over the Sea of Japan, north of Japan's main island of Hok
kaido.
Japanese officials would not say whether the plane was known to have
crashed.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Yoshio Hatano said the aircraft was not
over international waters when it disappeared, and offered no other
details, including whether it may have been carrying passengers or cargo.
"It appears that an Aeroflot plane was missing somewhere between
Primorskiy and Sakhalin," Hatano told an afternoon news briefing. He
did not say how the ministry determined the plane belonged to the So
viet airline.
Primorskiy is just west of Vladivostok, a major Siberian seaport and
naval base on the Sea of Japan coast. Sakhalin is the offshore island near
where Korean Air Lines Flight 007 was shot down by a Soviet fighter on
Sept. 1, 1983, after it flew off course. All 269 aboard died.
Senate approves $14.8 billion in aid
WASHINGTON — The Senate voted 75-19 yesterday to approve a
$14.8 billion foreign aid bill, including $5 million for non-communist
resistance fighters in Cambodia and a resolution aimed at pressuring
Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos to implement democratic
reforms in his country.
The legislation — reluctantly supported by the Reagan administration
— now goes to the Democratic-led House, which is not expected to take
final action until early June.
The $5 million is intended to help guerrillas seeking to oust the Viet
namese forces now occupying Cambodia and controlling its government.

Beirut on Mar. 25 while on a writing assignment for the agency.
Collett, the last Western kidnap victim until Walsh, was seized one
week after gunmen abducted Terry Anderson, 37, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press.
At least 13 Westerners have been held captive by various groups since
March last year. Four of them, two Britons and two French citizens, have
been freed.
A Dutch Roman Catholic priest, Nicolas Kluiters, 44, was found
strangled April 1, two weeks after he disappeared in the Bekaa Valley. It
has not been established whether he was a kidnap victim.
Shultz: summit meeting not set
SHANNON, Ireland — U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz, flying
home to report on his Mideast mission and talks with Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko, said yesterday that "no time or place " has
been set for a U.S.-Soviet summit.
But Shultz apparently made some headway toward setting up peace
talks between Israel and a mixed Palestinian-Jordanian delegation.
Reacting to a statement by Yasser Arafat, chairman of the the
Palestine Liberation Organization, that edged closer toward conditional
acceptance of Israel, Shultz said, "possibly the attitude of the Pales
tinians has been shifting some."
Shultz said "it's good" there now were direct references to Israel and
to U.N. Security Council Resolution 242, which asserts Israel's right to
exist within secure boundaries.
But on the Soviet segment of his trip — three exchanges in Vienna,
Austria, with Gromyko, one lasting six hours— Shultz did not claim any
particular accomplishments.
He said little on the issue of a possible meeting this year between
Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet leader.
Shultz told reporters traveling with him, "The situation remains as it
has been. The two leaders have exchanged messages saying the summit
meeting would be a good idea. No time or place has been set."
Shultz and Gromyko were in Vienna yesterday to celebrate a rare suc
cess story in the history of superpower bargaining — the 30th anniver
sary of the Austrian State Treaty. The treaty, signe J May 15,1955, after
nine years of haggling by'the United States, Britain, France and the So
viet Union, ended the four powers' occupations of Austria, which had
become part of the Nazi Germany in 1938.
Shultz said that after their talks, Gromyko now had a "clear idea of
our views" on arms control and other issues, but Shultz gave no indica
tion he had gained any concession from the Soviet foreign minister.
Asked if there could be progress when talks resume May 30 in Geneva
on nuclear weapons and space-based defense, Shultz said, "We'll just
have to see how things work out."
Gromyko insisted progress depended on "strict adherence" by the
United States to an agreement he reached with Shultz in Geneva in Jan
uary that President Reagan's "Star Wars" program would be discussed
in tandem with curbs on offensive nuclear weapons.
The Reagan administration has insisted on going ahead with research
on anti-missile defense but has said there would have to be negotiations
with the Soviets before any systems were deployed.
Shultz told reporters before he left Vienna's Schwechat Airport for
home that he was coming away with the idea that "negotiations work."
Legionnaires' disease claims 37
STAFFORD, London — Health authorities said yesterday they
hoped the outbreak of Legionnaires' disease that has claimed 37 lives
would end in a few days. It is believed to be the world's highest death toll
from the virulent illness.
An 80-year-old man died of the pneumonia-like illness in Stafford's
Kingsmead Hospital yesterday, raising the death toll to 37. Two more
people with symptoms of the disease were admitted to Stafford District
General Hospital, which is believed to be the source of the infection.
Fifty-eight people remained hospitalized with Legionnaires'
symptoms, and two people were reported in poor condition.
Dr. John Gibson, who is treating Legionnaires' patients, said,
"Assuming that the hospital is the source of the outbreak, we should be
clear of the incubation period at the end of this week."
Blood tests showed that six of the hospital's nurses who had worked in
the outpatient area have the disease bacterium in their bloodstreams.
The discovery of the bacterium in the six nurses tended to confirm that
the outbreak originated in the hospital, said Jim Bartlett, general
manager of the Mid-Staffordshire Health Authority.
Soviet plane disappears over Japan
TOKYO — The government said an aircraft that disappeared off the
Soviet coast earlier today belonged to the Soviet airline Aeroflot.
Japan Defense Agency sources, who spoke on condition they were not
identified, said the plane vanished from Japanese military radar screens
while flying over the Sea of Japan, north of Japan's main island of Hok
kaido.
Japanese officials would not say whether the plane was known to have
crashed.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Yoshio Hatano said the aircraft was not
over international waters when it disappeared, and offered no other
details, including whether it may have been carrying passengers or cargo.
"It appears that an Aeroflot plane was missing somewhere between
Primorskiy and Sakhalin," Hatano told an afternoon news briefing. He
did not say how the ministry determined the plane belonged to the So
viet airline.
Primorskiy is just west of Vladivostok, a major Siberian seaport and
naval base on the Sea of Japan coast. Sakhalin is the offshore island near
where Korean Air Lines Flight 007 was shot down by a Soviet fighter on
Sept. 1, 1983, after it flew off course. All 269 aboard died.
Senate approves $14.8 billion in aid
WASHINGTON — The Senate voted 75-19 yesterday to approve a
$14.8 billion foreign aid bill, including $5 million for non-communist
resistance fighters in Cambodia and a resolution aimed at pressuring
Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos to implement democratic
reforms in his country.
The legislation — reluctantly supported by the Reagan administration
— now goes to the Democratic-led House, which is not expected to take
final action until early June.
The $5 million is intended to help guerrillas seeking to oust the Viet
namese forces now occupying Cambodia and controlling its government.
U.N. Irish relief official abducted
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Eight heavily armed men in combat fatigues
abducted an Irish relief official yesterday, forcing his U.N. station wagon
to a halt on a seafront boulevard and shoving him into one of their cars.
Rival militias battled with artillery, rockets and machine guns in their
18th day of open war along the line that divides Beirut into Christian
and Moslem sectors. Police reported at least nine people killed and 22
wounded.
Aidan Walsh, 49, was abducted in a swift, well-organized operation in
Moslem west Beirut that took less than two minutes, his driver said.
Mahmoud Ghanem said the kidnappers were in two cars. One cut in
front of Walsh's white station wagon, which was emblazoned with the
U.N. insignia and flew a blue U.N. flag, and the other blocked the road
behind.
Six gunmen armed with AK-47 assault rifles and pistols jumped out,
leaving two armed drivers in the cars, Ghanem told The Associated
Press.
The driver, a Palestinian, said two gunmen covered the street and four
surrounded the station wagon. When the driver protested, one gunman
smashed the windshield with the metal butt of his rifle.
Walsh has for two years been deputy director of the Vienna-based
U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which aids Palestinians in Lebanese
refugee camps.
There was no claim of responsibility. The Rauoche sector is controlled
by the Shiite Moslem militia Amal and Druse fighters, but other Moslem
groups have carried out kidnappings there.
Walsh's wife, two sons and a daughter live in Dublin.
He was the second UNRWA employee abducted in Lebanon in recent
weeks. British journalist Alec Collett, 63, was kidnapped in southern
Beirut on Mar. 25 while on a writing assignment for the agency.
