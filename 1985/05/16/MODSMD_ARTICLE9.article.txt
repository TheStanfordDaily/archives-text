# Death toll climbs to 11
## Five more found in MOVE debris 
### 
PHILADELPHIA — Five more
incinerated bodies and a cache of
weapons were found yesterday in the
ruins of a radical cult's fortified
rowhouse by police who searched the
debris with heavy machinery and
long-handled prongs.
That find — which included the
bodies of the two children — in
creased the death toll to 11. Two
other children were among the six
bodies found Tuesday in the ruins of
the house once occupied by the
MOVE cult.
"We're taking one shovel at a
time," said police spokesman Lt.
Jerry Whartenby. "We're looking for
any kind of evidence to tell us what
went on, any more bodies that may or
may not be there, weapons, ammo,
things of that sort."
The five bodies found yesterday
were wrapped in canvas body bags
and taken to the city morgue for
study, according to Clarence Mosley,
assistant city managing director.
Police assaulted the house on Mon
day with bullets, water cannon and tear
gas and finally a two-pound bomb.
An ensuing fire burned 61 homes and
uprooted at least 225 residents of the
west Philadelphia neighborhood.
Police uncovered a second
bunker with gunports in a rear corner
of a basement. Earlier, police found
another basement bunker and
bombed a steel-reinforced bunker on
the roof.
Meanwhile, Mayor Wilson Goode
again defended his plan to evict the
radicals and took full responsibility
for the result.
"The whole purpose of the opera
tion was to preserve life. What hap
pened was an accident. There will not
be any scapegoats. I am fully and to
tally responsible," he said at a news
conference.
Goode said he would appoint
within one week a commission to
review the facts that led up to the
Monday confrontation.
Police used a five-story crane with
a large bucket to scoop rubble
from the MOVE house and dump it
in the street. Officers picked through
the debris with hand tools.

Police were unsure how long the
process would take, Whartenby said.
"They don't want to miss something
that might be crucial," he said.
Meanwhile, refugees from the
middle-income neighborhood wre
sheltered at college dormitories and
with friends and relatives while the
city develops plans to rebuild the
neighborhood.
Expecting to be away from home
only overnight, the residents took no
possessions when police evacuated
them from the area Sunday, and most
lost everything they owned in a fire
that destroyed 53 homes and burned
eight others.
Residents under police escort
returned to their old street yesterday,
but most found only the brick divid
ing walls still standing.

"I walked right past it and didn't
know it was my house. The police of
ficer had to tell me it was my house.
And when I walked in, there was no
second floor, no roof. Everything was
right down in the basement," said
Damion Robinson, 18, whose house
was right down the block from the
MOVE shootout.
"Some of the people are going back
to their homes and breaking down,"
said Dr. Richard Surles, director of
the Philadelphia Mental Health and
Mental Retardation Agency.
"This was not an act of nature. This
was gunfire and water cannons and
bombs. This was as close as we see to
war in a city in peacetime," said Dr.
Arthur Freeman, a psychologist at
the hospital of the University of
Pennsylvania who specializes in coun
seling disaster victims.

A firefight and firestorm erupted
Monday after police tried to evict
MOVE members and arrest four of
them on charges of harassment and
possession of explosives. The group
had moved into the house three years
ago.
MOVE, founded in 1972 by Vin
cent Leaphart, is an anti-civilization
group whose members use the
surname Africa. They shun medicine,
refuse to bathe with soap, and
welcome dogs, cats, cockroaches and
rats into their house.
Two MOVE members escaped
their blazing compound — Ramona
Africa, who was arrested on charges
of assault and held on $3 million bail,
and Birdie Africa, belived to be 13,
who is hospitalized good condition
with burns.
