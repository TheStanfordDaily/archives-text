# 'Superfund' budget debated
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Senate
Finance Committee, over strong dis
sent from the Reagan administration,
voted yesterday for a vastly enlarged
"Superfund" toxic waste cleanup
campaign financed by a new excise
tax on manufacturers.
Cleared for floor debate by a 16-1
vote of the Republican-controlled
panel was bipartisan legislation that
would boost Superfund spending to
$7.5 billion in the five years begin
ning Oct. 1.
This is a nearly five-fold increase
from the $1.6 billion earmarked for
attacking abandoned waste dumps in
Superfund's first five years and al
most 50 percent more than the $5.3
billion the administration is seeking.
The committee acted shortly after
House members unveiled a $10.1 bil
lion Superfund proposal billed as
"consensus" legislation but so far
lacking broad support from members
of a key subcommittee that will con
sider the issue.
Mikel Rollyson, the Treasury's tax
legislative counsel, made clear to
senators that the administration is
against a Superfund larger than $5.3
billion and the new tax to pay for it.
"We're strongly opposed to it,"he
testified. "This is a very difficult
tax. . . . We strongly suggest the $5.3
billion level so no new tax would be

necessary."
Environmental Protection Agency
Administrator Lee Thomas has con
sistently told Congress that $5.3 bil
lion is the most his agency could ef
fectively spend cleaning up toxics
through 1990.
But like the Senate Environment
Committee in an earlier vote, the tax
writers pegged Superfund at $7.5 bil
lion, all but establishing this as the
minimum amount Congress will au
thorize this year.
The Finance Committee called for
a major change in Superfund financ
ing by approving 17-2 an excise tax of
.08 percent on the gross receipts of
manufacturers with more than $5
million a year in sales.
The levy, which would not apply to
exports or unprocessed farm com
modities, would greatly broaden the
Superfund tax base and give Congress
a relatively easy way to alter the size
of Superfund in the future.
Currently, the cleanup effort is
financed principally by two sources:
about one-eighth from general tax
revenues and nearly all the rest from
a tax on petroleum and so-called
"feed stock" chemicals that are the
building blocks for other toxics.
