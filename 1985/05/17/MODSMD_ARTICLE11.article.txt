# House committee approves budget
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The House
Budget Committee, on a straight
party-line vote, yesterday ap
proved a Democratic-sponsored
$967.3-billion budget for 1986
that protects next year's Social Se
curity benefit increases while
slicing deeply into President
Reagan's military buildup.
The 20-13 vote, sending the
spending outline to the full House
of Representatives, came after ef
forts to reach a bipartisan agree
ment on military spending col
lapsed.
The proposed budget would
trim $56 billion from a projected
federal deficit of $230 billion, ac
complishing the reduction by a
mix of spending restraint in mili
tary and domestic programs.
However, the plan would not
cut into domestic programs nearly
as deeply as a rival budget ap
proved by the Republican-led
Senate last week. But like the Sen
ate package, it would not require
tax increases.
House leaders said they ex
pected a vote on the budget on the
House floor by the middle of next
week. Minority-party Republicans
vowed to make major changes in
the plan on the House after they
failed to win any points in the

committee.
Earlier, Democrats offered to
slightly increase military spending
levels in the package in exchange
for GOP support of the rest of the
plan.
But Republican members said
the offered amount — an increase
of about $2 billion in fiscal 1986
— was far too small to cut such a
deal.
"Our negotiations with the
other side haven't been very suc
cessful this year," said Speaker
Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.)
The Senate plan, endorsed by
President Reagan, would elimi
nate 13 programs, cancel next
year's cost-of-living increases for
Social Security and most other
recipients of federal benefit pro
grams, and hold defense spending
increases at the rate of inflation
next year — all for a three-year
savings of almost $300 billion.
By contrast, the House plan
would protect inflation adjust
ments in Social Security and all
other benefit programs, would not
eliminate any programs next year
and would restrain defense spend
ing by $6 billion more in 1985
than the Senate version.
