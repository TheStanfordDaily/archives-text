Clergymen back mayor
PHILADELPHIA — A group of black cler
gymen joined the police union and much of the
public in supporting Mayor Wilson Goode yes
terday, three days after the fiery police raid on a
radical cult's stronghold that incinerated at least
11 people and destroyed dozens of homes.
"I think what people saw was a mayor who
wanted to do everything he could to preserve life,
but, when an accident took place, was willing to
stand up and deal with those problems," Goode
said.
"The upside of this, if there can be an upside, is
that the death toll is as small as it is at this point,"
he said on NBC's "Today" show.

United pilots strike
BOSTON — Pilots struck United Airlines
early today after contract talks stalled over the
company's demand to pay lower salaries to
beginning pilots, authorities said.
"We have a strike," said Dave Jewell, a
spokesman in Chicago for the Air Line Pilots As
sociation, following the midnight strike deadline
by United's 5,300 pilots. Pickets went up in
Chicago, San Francisco, Denver, Portland, Ore.,
Honolulu and Seattle against the nation's largest
airline.
Even before the strike was announced. United
canceled 155 flights, about 10 percent of the
airline's system, because pilots called in sick at

higher than the normal rate, said Chuck Novak, a
spokesman for the Chicago-based airline.
