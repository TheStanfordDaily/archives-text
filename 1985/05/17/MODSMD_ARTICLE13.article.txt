Clergy case thrown out
GLENDALE — A landmark $1 million clergy
malpractice lawsuit stemming from a young
man's suicide was dismissed yesterday by a judge
who said the case was groundless and might have
had a chilling effect on religious freedom.
It was the second time in five years the suit was
dismissed. But one juror, queried afterward, said
the panel would have ruled in favor of the par
ents of Kenneth Mark Nally, a young man who
committed suicide in 1979 after counseling at
Grace Community Church of Sun Valley.
However, Superior Court Judge Joseph Kalin
ruled: "There is no compelling state interest for
this court to interfere in the pastoral counseling
activities of Grace Community Church. Such in
terference could result in excessive entanglement
of the state in the church and religious beliefs and
teachings."
The Nallys' attorney, Edward Barker, said he
was shocked by the ruling and is ready to appeal,
if the parents wish to.
Barker said only one juror was opposed to the
plaintiffs, "but the rest were with us."
"I feel strongly the church would have lost,"
Juror Cheri Ashcraft said. "I'd say at least 80
percent (of the jury) felt that."
However, church attorney Samuel Ericsson
said his poll of the panel showed them 10-5 in fa
vor of the church.
Nally, 24, a convert from Roman Catholicism,

had been despondent over a breakup with his
girlfriend and had tried suicide previously.
Walter and Maria Nally sued in 1980, alleging
malpractice, wrongful death, negligence and out
rageous conduct by the church and four cler
gyman, including the Rev. John Mac Arthur,
senior pastor and president-elect of The Masters
College of Newhall, formerly Los Angeles Bap
tist College; and pastors Duane Rea, Richard
Thomson and Lynn Cory.
"Ken sought counseling. He did it of his own
free will. The state should not interfere with his
choice of counselor," the judge said. "The defen
dant had no legally recognized duty in the law to
investigate, inform his parents, refer Nally to a
psychologist or to train an employed competent
counselor. There is no evidence to show that a
breach of duties . . . led to suicide."
The judge said any such "attempt to impart
standards of pastoral counseling would open the
floodgates to clergy malpractice suits" and have a
"chilling effect on the exercise of freedom of reli
gion."
Illegal export charged
LOS ANGELES — An Orange County man
was charged yesterday in a 30-count federal in
dictment with illegally exporting to Israel trigger
ing devices usable in atomic weapons, U.S. At
torney Robert Bonner said.

The indictment was the result of "an intensive
investigation by the U.S. Customs Service under
its 'Operation Exodus' program, which is de
signed to help stem the flow of military and high
technology materials out of the United States,"
Bonner said.
Richard Kelly Smyth, 55, of Huntington Beach
was not in custody, but arrangements were made
for his surrender in about 10 days at the federal
courthouse on charges stemming from export of
the two-inch-long krytron triggering devices,
Bonner said at a news conference. Israel has
maintained it was using the devices strictly for
non-nuclear purposes.
"Although they do have some civilian applica
tions, they can be used in nuclear and other mili
tary weapons," Bonner said.
Krytrons are included on the U.S. Munitions
List, which means they may not be exported
without a license or written approval from the
State Department.
Smyth is accused in the indictment of circum
venting those regulations by preparing false
documentation for the exports.
