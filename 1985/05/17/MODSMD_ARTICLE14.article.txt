## Trio to bike across America for Africa 
### NATHANIEL WARING 
Over the past year, the famine in
Africa has inspired numerous organi
zations and individuals to raise relief
funds. Some, like popular artists in
Canada, Britain and the United
States who have banded together and
produced hit singles, receive wide
media attention.
Others, like a trio of young men
who plan a "Biking for Africa " trip
across the United States, receive only
local attention at best.
Celebrity status, however, is not
their goal. The goal is to raise money
— "a minimum of $20,000" —
through corporate and individual
pledges of money per mile, says
junior Peter Haven, one of the three
bikers.
Co-terminal student Aaron Persky,
1984 Stanford graduate Eric Wolfe
and Haven plan to leave from White
Plaza on June 24 and arrive at the
Mall in Washington, D.C., seven
weeks and 3,269 miles later. The
money raised from those pedaled
miles will be presented to the Ameri
can Red Cross, where it will be tar
geted for East African famine relief.
Persky and Wolfe, freshman
roommates five years ago, came up
with the Biking for Africa idea last
winter when they combined a desire
to challenge themselves physically
with a commitment to helping others.
Haven, teammate of Persky on the
Stanford lacrosse club, joined the
group at its inception as the Argos
Bicycle Club.
"This kind of venture is not some
thing any of us have done before, but
we are aware of the situation and we
want to do something about it,"
Wolfe says. "Originally, Aaron and I
wanted to take the summer off and
bike across Europe, but that idea
soon developed into our Biking for
Africa trip."
Biking across America is not a
jaunt through Europe. There are the
Sierras and the Rockies of the West
to climb, the plains and fields of the
Midwest to traverse and the crowded,
hilly highways of the East to

negotiate. The three bikers will be
pedaling six to eight hours a day,
seated on thin, hard leather saddles.
Their bikes will be loaded with equip
ment — a pup tent, sleeping bags, a
tool kit and a change of clothes — all
stuffed in panniers strapped around
both wheels.
"We draw our inspiration not from
the great biking shape we're in now,
but from sheer determination," says
Haven. Sheer determination is some
thing they will need. "A woman I
spoke with made it across country on
a three-speed by training in the Stan
ford hills with loaded rice sacks on
her back," Haven says.
These three cyclists, however, plan
to ride better bikes. Haven has writ
ten to several bicycle manufacturers
to find a sponsor who will donate
bikes and equipment. He thinks it
probable that a bicycle manufacturer
will provide the group with bikes.
"They've done such things before,
and besides, think of all the publicity
they will receive as we ride across
America," Haven says.
The already detailed itinerary of
the trip includes stops in at least 10
local chapters of the Red Cross. The
Palo Alto chapter of the Red Cross
plans to contact other chapters along
the planned bike route to organize
receptions for the bikers, according to
freshman Daniel Schvartzman, the
on-campus representative for Red
Cross.
"The Red Cross has been very
excited about the whole thing,"
Persky says.
"One of the reasons we chose Red
Cross was for their well-respected
name and their organizational
structure throughout the U. 5.," ex
plains Haven.
Between stops at Red Cross chap
ters, the bikers will camp out and
make a luxury stop at a motel once
every week to clean up and sleep on a
soft bed. Haven hopes to be able to
call the motels a day in advance and,
by explaining their cause, to get a

room for no charge.
For most of the seven weeks spent
biking across the country, the three
cyclists will be alone on big roads. Of
ten the only road going in the right di
rection will be a highway with its
share of cross-country truckers and
speeding cars.
The bikers will camp out at public
campgrounds, maybe even town
parks, with the permission of local
police. They will eat cold food,

"sandwiches," says Wolfe, who has
an apartment in the city and never
cooks. " Don't think we're going to do
any real cooking," he says.
By the time they ride through
Maryland on the last day of their
journey, a planned easy 25 miles
from Falls Church, Va., to downtown
Washington, D.C., they will be
weary, looking like real bikers.
"We're going to look like hell.

There is no way we'll be able to pop
suit and tie for our Red Cross recep
tion in Washington,"says Wolfe, who
is accustomed to looking neat for his
job at Crocker National Bank in San
Francisco. "But we are planning a
celebration in Washington," Haven
adds.
The future of the Argos Bicycle
Club will depend on just how this trip
turns out and what new ideas the
group will have. "I think we're all

going to remain committed to charity
work because of this, and with all our
experience in raising money, I think it
will make any other ideas we have
that much easier," Persky says.
Haven notes that anyone interested
in helping out the three bikers' cause
should make checks payable to the
American Red Cross /Biking for
Africa and send them to American
Red Cross, 400 Mitchell Lane, Palo
Alto, CA 94301.

bikes and equipment. He thinks it
probable that a bicycle manufacturer
will provide the group with bikes.
"They've done such things before,
and besides, think of all the publicity
they will receive as we ride across
America," Haven says.
The already detailed itinerary of
the trip includes stops in at least 10
local chapters of the Red Cross. The
Palo Alto chapter of the Red Cross
plans to contact other chapters along
the planned bike route to organize
receptions for the bikers, according to
freshman Daniel Schvartzman, the
on-campus representative for Red
Cross.
"The Red Cross has been very
excited about the whole thing,"
Persky says.
"One of the reasons we chose Red
Cross was for their well-respected
name and their organizational
structure throughout the U. 5.," ex
plains Haven.
Between stops at Red Cross chap
ters, the bikers will camp out and
make a luxury stop at a motel once
every week to clean up and sleep on a
soft bed. Haven hopes to be able to
call the motels a day in advance and,
by explaining their cause, to get a

room for no charge.
For most of the seven weeks spent
biking across the country, the three
cyclists will be alone on big roads. Of
ten the only road going in the right di
rection will be a highway with its
share of cross-country truckers and
speeding cars.
The bikers will camp out at public
campgrounds, maybe even town
parks, with the permission of local
police. They will eat cold food,

"sandwiches," says Wolfe, who has
an apartment in the city and never
cooks. " Don't think we're going to do
any real cooking," he says.
By the time they ride through
Maryland on the last day of their
journey, a planned easy 25 miles
from Falls Church, Va., to downtown
Washington, D.C., they will be
weary, looking like real bikers.
"We're going to look like hell.

There is no way we'll be able to pop
suit and tie for our Red Cross recep
tion in Washington,"says Wolfe, who
is accustomed to looking neat for his
job at Crocker National Bank in San
Francisco. "But we are planning a
celebration in Washington," Haven
adds.
The future of the Argos Bicycle
Club will depend on just how this trip
turns out and what new ideas the
group will have. "I think we're all

going to remain committed to charity
work because of this, and with all our
experience in raising money, I think it
will make any other ideas we have
that much easier," Persky says.
Haven notes that anyone interested
in helping out the three bikers' cause
should make checks payable to the
American Red Cross /Biking for
Africa and send them to American
Red Cross, 400 Mitchell Lane, Palo
Alto, CA 94301.

D.C., this summer to raise money — from corporate and individual
pledges — for famine relief in East Africa.
Over the past year, the famine in
Africa has inspired numerous organi
zations and individuals to raise relief
funds. Some, like popular artists in
Canada, Britain and the United
States who have banded together and
produced hit singles, receive wide
media attention.
Others, like a trio of young men
who plan a "Biking for Africa " trip
across the United States, receive only
local attention at best.
Celebrity status, however, is not
their goal. The goal is to raise money
— "a minimum of $20,000" —
through corporate and individual
pledges of money per mile, says
junior Peter Haven, one of the three
bikers.
Co-terminal student Aaron Persky,
1984 Stanford graduate Eric Wolfe
and Haven plan to leave from White
Plaza on June 24 and arrive at the
Mall in Washington, D.C., seven
weeks and 3,269 miles later. The
money raised from those pedaled
miles will be presented to the Ameri
can Red Cross, where it will be tar
geted for East African famine relief.
Persky and Wolfe, freshman
roommates five years ago, came up
with the Biking for Africa idea last
winter when they combined a desire
to challenge themselves physically
with a commitment to helping others.
Haven, teammate of Persky on the
Stanford lacrosse club, joined the
group at its inception as the Argos
Bicycle Club.
"This kind of venture is not some
thing any of us have done before, but
we are aware of the situation and we
want to do something about it,"
Wolfe says. "Originally, Aaron and I
wanted to take the summer off and
bike across Europe, but that idea
soon developed into our Biking for
Africa trip."
Biking across America is not a
jaunt through Europe. There are the
Sierras and the Rockies of the West
to climb, the plains and fields of the
Midwest to traverse and the crowded,
hilly highways of the East to

negotiate. The three bikers will be
pedaling six to eight hours a day,
seated on thin, hard leather saddles.
Their bikes will be loaded with equip
ment — a pup tent, sleeping bags, a
tool kit and a change of clothes — all
stuffed in panniers strapped around
both wheels.
"We draw our inspiration not from
the great biking shape we're in now,
but from sheer determination," says
Haven. Sheer determination is some
thing they will need. "A woman I
spoke with made it across country on
a three-speed by training in the Stan
ford hills with loaded rice sacks on
her back," Haven says.
These three cyclists, however, plan
to ride better bikes. Haven has writ
ten to several bicycle manufacturers
to find a sponsor who will donate
bikes and equipment. He thinks it
probable that a bicycle manufacturer
will provide the group with bikes.
"They've done such things before,
and besides, think of all the publicity
they will receive as we ride across
