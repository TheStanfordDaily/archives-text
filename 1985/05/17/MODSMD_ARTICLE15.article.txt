## THE
						STANFORD DAILY No food for thought

Staff members at Meyer Library, with the help
of the Stanford Polo Club, are currently patrol
ling the building to stop students from taking food
or drinks into study areas. A flier at the library
explains that the policing is part of a two-week
campaign designed to "educate library users
about its No-Food/Drink Policy." The flier says
library staff members "sympathize with the
desire to snack while studying" but realize the
importance of protecting library materials from
damage "either by direct contact with food and
drink or by having food transferred to them by
their users' hands."
As polo team members stationed in Meyer
continue to search students' backpacks, it
becomes all too obvious that the already tense
situation in the library's lobby could easily esc
alate. Steps should be taken to ensure that polo
players do not whack any violators with mallets.
And how long will it be before polo horses are
added to the library patrol?
Another worry is that other buildings around

campus will follow suit. One conjures up a
frightening scenario in which guards at Old
Union confiscate the lunchtime sandwich of an
irate Norm Robinson as he tries to return to his
office.
A third potential problem is a University Food
Service retaliation to the library's stated anti
food policies. It's not unlikely that food service
officials will take up an anti-books stance in
which they forbid students to carry any reading
materials into residence dining halls.
Meyer Library also boasts a new glass-case dis
play in its lobby of an assortment of soda cans
and candy bar wrappers that it claims to have
gathered in 15 minutes of patrolling. Damaged
books and a fake rat — symbolic of the destruc
tion food can cause and of the vermin food at
tracts — are an integral part of the display.
The display and the policing tactics are remi
niscent of the scene in a junior high school li
brary. And presumably, we've all grown up a
little since then.
