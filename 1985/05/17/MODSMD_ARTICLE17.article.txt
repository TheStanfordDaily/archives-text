# How to survive in an 'information society'
## 
### 
We live — as you all know, having been
told it an infinite number of times before — in
an information society. To rearrange a few
words in search of a definition, that means our
society runs on information.
Or, to say what it really means, the govern
ment wants to know everything about us.
They inundate us with pro-information
propaganda. Without information, life itself
would be impossible. And not only life, but
also so many of the things that make life
worth living: AT&T, the post office, the
IRS, the armed forces. ABC, NBC and CBS,
"The A-Team," "Diffrent Strokes," "Punky
Brewster," "Dynasty," "Dallas," "All My
Children." Income tax. The SATs, MCATs,
LSATs, GREs. Wayne Newton records.
Wang Chung records. Frank Sinatra records.
Muzak. All the sources and repositories of in
formation that keep our society running
smoothly. (Well, relatively smoothly.)
Where would we all be without those
sources and repositories of information?
Without CBS? Without the IRS? Without the
SATs? Without — God forbid — Wayne
Newton?
We'd be a lot better off, that's where we'd
be — assuming for the sake of metaphor that
"a lot better off' is a place, of course. You
know what I mean. What they mean when
they say "where would we be" is, where
would they be? And I think we all know who
"they" are. They are the government. The
CIA, the FBI, Ronald Reagan, the IRS, the
Department of Defense. The people who ac
tually listen to Wayne Newton records. The
bad guys. Where they would be is out of luck
— assuming, again, that "out of luck" is a
place. It might be.
The information society is getting out of

hand. In fact, it already is out of hand. When
anyone who wants it — for any purpose,
however nefarious — can find out what my
mother's maiden name was, then things have
definitely gone too far. A person should be
allowed some privacy. The problem is, there's
too much information floating around out
there. It's too easy to find stuff out.

You may not know it — you probably
don't, because they don't like to spread such
things around — but if you ate breakfast in a
food service-operated dining hall this morn
ing, then right now your name, approximate
height, approximate weight, the kind and
amount of food you had for breakfast and the
color of your eyes are all recorded in some
federal data bank. I don't know where the
data bank is, but I know it's out there.
I used to work for food service, and you
wouldn't believe some of the things they
made us do. And you wouldn't believe how
much the government can tell about a person
from an extended record of the food he eats.
It's frightening.
Here's another example of what is going
on. It is a well, but not widely, known fact that
McDonald's — yes, that McDonald's— is ac

tually a front for intelligence-gathering activi
ties conducted by the CIA against U.S.
citizens. Have you noticed that fast-food
places are being computerized at an alarming
rate? It's not just because they can afford it, I
can tell you. No, they're after something, if
you know what I mean, and I think you do.
So whenever I go into McDonald's, I al
ways make it a point to buy something I don't
want, and remark to the cashier that it's one
of my favorite foods. Then I throw it away
when I get outside. It's expensive, sure, but
it's money spent in a good cause. I'm creating
an informational smoke screen around
myself.
They're not just in food, either. It goes
deeper than that. I got a call from some guy a
few days ago who said his name was Joe.
(Right. Sure it was.) He wanted to ask me a
few questions — he said — about my car. I
don't own a car, so I told him I did, and he
asked me some questions about it. Like: Have
I had to repair it in the last month? Five times,
I told him. Was it an American car, or an im
port? American, I said; otherwise it wouldn't
have needed so many repairs. He asked me a
few more questions, thanked me and hung
up, thinking he had fooled me.
By the time they find out (if they ever do)
that I don't even own a car, the information I
gave them will be in so many places, integra
ted with so many other pieces of information,
that they'll never get it out. They'll just have
to carry on with their databases screwed up,
thinking mistakenly that I hate American
cars, which will screw up other things, and
those things will screw up other things, and so
on. And when the CIA, for example, needs to
know something about me, or something
about American attitudes toward American

cars, or about the frequency with which
American cars need repairs — they'll get the
wrong information. And, gosh, won't that just
be too bad for the CIA? Because whatever in
formation they need, you can just bet it's
going to be used for something nasty. They
deserve to be screwed up, as much as possible.
When this column is printed, someone
somewhere — probably in the government's
Bureau of College Newspaper Biweekly
Columnists — will read it, and become
alarmed. Not too alarmed, of course, because
who the hell am I, anyway? Nobody to get
very alarmed about. But it'll be noticed, and
probably my name will get flagged in a num
ber of computer files, warning that Tom
Kearney has been known to lie to
McDonald's employees and telephone poll
takers, that therefore he's probably a commu
nist and that he's not to be trusted.
But then they won't know what to think of
anything they might have in my file: Was I
lying when I said that my favorite color was
puce? When I said the Rolling Stones were
my favorite band? Do I really need glasses, or
have I just been faking an inability to see? Is
my mother's maiden name actually Muscetti?
Was I really lying to that guy on the phone, or
did I just say I was in order to confuse them?
Or in order to confuse my readers?
They won't know. So they won't be able to
use the information they have; but they won't
be able to disregard it, either. Throwing away
information, even false information, is repug
nant to people in the government. I don't
know what they'll do. Maybe they'll go on
using all the information they have, even if it's
wrong. That sounds like something the gov
ernment would do, doesn't it? Hell, it is some
thing the government would do — something

the government has done, so they'll probably
keep on doing it. And that'll screw them up
even more.
And that's a good thing. Because, in my
small way, I am protecting the privacy of
every one of you. If they're wrong about me,
sooner or later they'll be wrong about you in
some way or another. And God knows (but
don't worry, He won't tell) you want the gov
ernment to be wrong about you. Because if
they're right about you, you don't have a
chance against them.
You can help preserve our fundamental
right to privacy. Here's what you should do.
Tell a lie — just one, if you want, just a small
one — to every person you meet today, just
on the chance that person is a government
agent or that a government agent is listening.
Because if so, then that little lie could pay off
big. The information might be sent to a com
puter, and a computer, properly lied to, can
make a million mistakes a second. That's
more than 3 billion mistakes an hour. If
enough of you do it, it could be really signifi
cant.
So go ahead. Tell someone your favorite
color is teal or purple or something else
ridiculous; tell the person who serves you din
ner that you want two pieces of fried liver; call
up an 800 telephone number that you've seen
on a TV ad and say, "I just saw your commer
cial on television and I thought it was
fabulousl" and then hang up. Offer a fake
walnut to a squirrel. No lie is too small, no
falsehood too insignificant. If we don't screw
up the information society, the information
society will screw us up.
Let's do it to them, before they do it to us.

who the hell am I, anyway? Nobody to get
very alarmed about. But it'll be noticed, and
probably my name will get flagged in a num
ber of computer files, warning that Tom
Kearney has been known to lie to
McDonald's employees and telephone poll
takers, that therefore he's probably a commu
nist and that he's not to be trusted.
But then they won't know what to think of
anything they might have in my file: Was I
lying when I said that my favorite color was
puce? When I said the Rolling Stones were
my favorite band? Do I really need glasses, or
have I just been faking an inability to see? Is
my mother's maiden name actually Muscetti?
Was I really lying to that guy on the phone, or
did I just say I was in order to confuse them?
Or in order to confuse my readers?
They won't know. So they won't be able to
use the information they have; but they won't
be able to disregard it, either. Throwing away
information, even false information, is repug
nant to people in the government. I don't
know what they'll do. Maybe they'll go on
using all the information they have, even if it's
wrong. That sounds like something the gov
ernment would do, doesn't it? Hell, it is some
thing the government would do — something

the government has done, so they'll probably
keep on doing it. And that'll screw them up
even more.
And that's a good thing. Because, in my
small way, I am protecting the privacy of
every one of you. If they're wrong about me,
sooner or later they'll be wrong about you in
some way or another. And God knows (but
don't worry, He won't tell) you want the gov
ernment to be wrong about you. Because if
they're right about you, you don't have a
chance against them.
You can help preserve our fundamental
right to privacy. Here's what you should do.
Tell a lie — just one, if you want, just a small
one — to every person you meet today, just
on the chance that person is a government
agent or that a government agent is listening.
Because if so, then that little lie could pay off
big. The information might be sent to a com
puter, and a computer, properly lied to, can
make a million mistakes a second. That's
more than 3 billion mistakes an hour. If
enough of you do it, it could be really signifi
cant.
So go ahead. Tell someone your favorite
color is teal or purple or something else
ridiculous; tell the person who serves you din
ner that you want two pieces of fried liver; call
up an 800 telephone number that you've seen
on a TV ad and say, "I just saw your commer
cial on television and I thought it was
fabulousl" and then hang up. Offer a fake
walnut to a squirrel. No lie is too small, no
falsehood too insignificant. If we don't screw
up the information society, the information
society will screw us up.
Let's do it to them, before they do it to us.

TOM
KEARNEY
We live — as you all know, having been
told it an infinite number of times before — in
an information society. To rearrange a few
words in search of a definition, that means our
society runs on information.
Or, to say what it really means, the govern
ment wants to know everything about us.
They inundate us with pro-information
propaganda. Without information, life itself
would be impossible. And not only life, but
also so many of the things that make life
worth living: AT&T, the post office, the
IRS, the armed forces. ABC, NBC and CBS,
"The A-Team," "Diffrent Strokes," "Punky
Brewster," "Dynasty," "Dallas," "All My
Children." Income tax. The SATs, MCATs,
LSATs, GREs. Wayne Newton records.
Wang Chung records. Frank Sinatra records.
Muzak. All the sources and repositories of in
formation that keep our society running
smoothly. (Well, relatively smoothly.)
Where would we all be without those
sources and repositories of information?
Without CBS? Without the IRS? Without the
SATs? Without — God forbid — Wayne
Newton?
We'd be a lot better off, that's where we'd
be — assuming for the sake of metaphor that
"a lot better off' is a place, of course. You
know what I mean. What they mean when
they say "where would we be" is, where
would they be? And I think we all know who
"they" are. They are the government. The
CIA, the FBI, Ronald Reagan, the IRS, the
Department of Defense. The people who ac
tually listen to Wayne Newton records. The
bad guys. Where they would be is out of luck
— assuming, again, that "out of luck" is a
place. It might be.
The information society is getting out of

hand. In fact, it already is out of hand. When
anyone who wants it — for any purpose,
however nefarious — can find out what my
mother's maiden name was, then things have
definitely gone too far. A person should be
allowed some privacy. The problem is, there's
too much information floating around out
there. It's too easy to find stuff out.

You may not know it — you probably
don't, because they don't like to spread such
things around — but if you ate breakfast in a
food service-operated dining hall this morn
ing, then right now your name, approximate
height, approximate weight, the kind and
amount of food you had for breakfast and the
color of your eyes are all recorded in some
federal data bank. I don't know where the
data bank is, but I know it's out there.
I used to work for food service, and you
wouldn't believe some of the things they
made us do. And you wouldn't believe how
much the government can tell about a person
from an extended record of the food he eats.
It's frightening.
Here's another example of what is going
on. It is a well, but not widely, known fact that
McDonald's — yes, that McDonald's— is ac

tually a front for intelligence-gathering activi
ties conducted by the CIA against U.S.
citizens. Have you noticed that fast-food
places are being computerized at an alarming
rate? It's not just because they can afford it, I
can tell you. No, they're after something, if
you know what I mean, and I think you do.
So whenever I go into McDonald's, I al
ways make it a point to buy something I don't
want, and remark to the cashier that it's one
of my favorite foods. Then I throw it away
when I get outside. It's expensive, sure, but
it's money spent in a good cause. I'm creating
an informational smoke screen around
myself.
They're not just in food, either. It goes
deeper than that. I got a call from some guy a
few days ago who said his name was Joe.
(Right. Sure it was.) He wanted to ask me a
few questions — he said — about my car. I
don't own a car, so I told him I did, and he
asked me some questions about it. Like: Have
I had to repair it in the last month? Five times,
I told him. Was it an American car, or an im
port? American, I said; otherwise it wouldn't
have needed so many repairs. He asked me a
few more questions, thanked me and hung
up, thinking he had fooled me.
By the time they find out (if they ever do)
that I don't even own a car, the information I
gave them will be in so many places, integra
ted with so many other pieces of information,
that they'll never get it out. They'll just have
to carry on with their databases screwed up,
thinking mistakenly that I hate American
cars, which will screw up other things, and
those things will screw up other things, and so
on. And when the CIA, for example, needs to
know something about me, or something
about American attitudes toward American

cars, or about the frequency with which
American cars need repairs — they'll get the
wrong information. And, gosh, won't that just
be too bad for the CIA? Because whatever in
formation they need, you can just bet it's
going to be used for something nasty. They
deserve to be screwed up, as much as possible.
When this column is printed, someone
somewhere — probably in the government's
Bureau of College Newspaper Biweekly
Columnists — will read it, and become
alarmed. Not too alarmed, of course, because
who the hell am I, anyway? Nobody to get
very alarmed about. But it'll be noticed, and
probably my name will get flagged in a num
ber of computer files, warning that Tom
Kearney has been known to lie to
McDonald's employees and telephone poll
takers, that therefore he's probably a commu
nist and that he's not to be trusted.
But then they won't know what to think of
anything they might have in my file: Was I
lying when I said that my favorite color was
puce? When I said the Rolling Stones were
my favorite band? Do I really need glasses, or
have I just been faking an inability to see? Is
my mother's maiden name actually Muscetti?
Was I really lying to that guy on the phone, or
did I just say I was in order to confuse them?
Or in order to confuse my readers?
They won't know. So they won't be able to
use the information they have; but they won't
be able to disregard it, either. Throwing away
information, even false information, is repug
nant to people in the government. I don't
know what they'll do. Maybe they'll go on

ernment would do, doesn't it? Hell, it is some

keep on doing it. And that'll screw them up
even more.
And that's a good thing. Because, in my
small way, I am protecting the privacy of

sooner or later they'll be wrong about you in
some way or another. And God knows (but
don't worry, He won't tell) you want the gov
ernment to be wrong about you. Because if
they're right about you, you don't have a
chance against them.
You can help preserve our fundamental
right to privacy. Here's what you should do.
Tell a lie — just one, if you want, just a small
