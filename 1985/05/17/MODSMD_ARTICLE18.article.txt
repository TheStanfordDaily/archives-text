## Jews were not the Nazis' only victims 
### 
In the furor over President Reagan's visit to the
Bitburg cemetery, the press has been referring of
ten to the Nazi terror and its victims. Reagan's visit
was insensitive and dishonored these victims; but
the press too is failing in its chance to honor all of
those who suffered and died at the Nazis' hands by
continuing to perpetuate the false idea that "the

VIEWPOINT

Holocaust" was an exclusively Jewish experience.
Reference is almost always made to the extermina
tion of 6 million Jews, while other victims, when
mentioned, are consistently grouped together as
"millions of others" or "millions of non-Jews." I
would venture that in the minds of most of the
American public, the term "the Holocaust" (which
itself improperly implies a sole historical episode of
horror and tragedy), and any reference to Nazi
atrocities brings to mind only Jewish victims.
Stephen Debenham, in his column "Holocaust
continues behind Iron Curtain" (The Daily, May
14), can state, "Thus, May 8, 1945, is fixed in
memory as much to celebrate the Allied liberation
of Europe as it is to commemorate and to mourn
more than 6 million Jews who died under Nazi
tyranny," and no one is going to stop to question
the gross injustice he does to millions. Why does it
not also mourn and commemorate the communists
afid homosexuals and Jehovah's Witnesses and
members of so many other groups killed and perse
cuted by the Nazis? Why shouldn't the murdered
Oypsies, targeted for extermination like the Jews,
also be mourned?
And why not the Slavs? Himmler told his SS
generals that 30 million Slavs had to be killed. Two
million, five hundred thousand non-Jewish Poles
were murdered, another 5 million enslaved. Rus
sian prisoners of war were brought to extermina
tion camps, where more than 4 million perished.

Why shouldn't the murdered Gypsies, targeted for
extermination like the Jews, also be mourned? Why
not the Slavs?

Are these figures so insignificant in comparison
with the deaths of Jews that they are not deserving
of mention, and hiding the names of the specific
peoples in the anonymity of terms like "millions of
non-Jews" is acceptable?
It is my intention neither to deny the fact of the
Final Solution and the Nazi killings of millions of
European Jews, nor to take away from the
episode's tragic proportions. But when the millions

of other victims become nameless, this too is a
tragedy. In a May 2 letter to The Daily, which it
chose not to print, I wrote in response to a small
item in the same day's issue which told of the order
of extradition of Andrija Artukovic to Yugoslavia
(from California) for crimes committed in the Nazi
puppet state of Croatia during the war. Toward the
end, the article stated that as interior minister, Ar
tukovic was allegedly " responsible for the deaths of
some 700,000 Jews, Gypsies and Serbs." There
were some 700,000 victims of Artukovic and the
Croatian government; but the vast majority of
those murdered were Serbs.

Are these figures so insignificant in comparison with
the deaths of Jews that they are not deserving of
mention, and hiding the names of the specific
peoples in the anonymity of terms like 'millions of
non-Jews' is acceptable?

In that letter, I cited two sources as evidence; I
could give hundreds more — it is simply a fact, and
I hope it wasn't doubt of the accuracy of my state
ments that led The Daily not to print my letter.
For the sake of credibility, here is the respected
Nora Levin in "The Holocaust": "When unleashed
after April 1941, the Ustashi (the Croatian group
which carried out the atrocities) murdered and
tortured Jews and Serbs in indescribably bestial
fashion. One of the most notorious camps in Hit
ler's Europe, Jascnovac, was in Croatia. Here the
Ustashi used primitive implements in putting their

victims to death — knives, axes, hammers, and
other iron tools. A characteristic method was bin
ding pairs of prisoners, back to back, and then
throwing them into the Sava River. One source es
timates that 770.000 Serbs, 40,000 Gypsies and
20.000 Jews were done to death in the Jasenovac
camp."
The horror of this passage needs no comment,
except that it is an episode virtually unknown in our

country. I have been wondering about The Daily's
decision not to print my letter. I think it may have
been that my contention that calling the murders
"the deaths of some 700,000 Jews, Gypsies and
Serbs" distorts the realities of history was seen as a
squabble and a very minor point. All three groups
were mentioned after all, and shouldn't I be con
tent that the article informed the public of the mur
ders?
To draw up an analogous situation, suppose the
press, writing on Reagan's visit to Germany,
referred to Hitler's "alleged responsibility for the
deaths of millions of Jehovah's Witnesses, Gypsies

and Jews." Imagine the (justified) outcry! It would
be widely viewed as an affront to the millions of
Jews killed by the Nazis, a grave insult likely inter
preted by many as anti-Semitic. Failure to ac
knowledge the outcry would probably justify such
an interpretation. Is not a similar insult delivered to
the hundreds of thousands of Serbs murdered
simply because they were Serbs?
I am unfortunately led to consider that because
Serbians are not perceived as a group with "media
value" or with which the public can "identify," The
Daily did not bother to print my letter. Somehow I
think the editors' attention might have been caught
if I was talking about the virtually unknown
genocide of nearly a million French. Or about the
massacre of Armenians or Cambodians, the
oppression of black South Africans, the starvation
of the Ethiopians, or about any other suffering
group which the press has currently chosen to be "a
la mode." Of course the tragedies of these peoples
should be known, but I would like to think that The
Daily has more integrity and concern than to just
jump on the bandwagon of popular causes.
The 40th anniversary of the end of the war in
Europe offers an excellent opportunity to recog
nize and honor all those who suffered and died at
the hands of the Nazis and their accomplices. The
call to "never forget" should not apply only to
those who are already remembered, and I sincerely
hope that The Daily will not take part in a selective
memory which erases the sufferings of millions
from the slate of history.

Europe offers an excellent opportunity to recog
nize and honor all those who suffered and died at
the hands of the Nazis and their accomplices. The
call to "never forget" should not apply only to
those who are already remembered, and I sincerely
hope that The Daily will not take part in a selective
memory which erases the sufferings of millions
from the slate of history.

In the furor over President Reagan's visit to the
Bitburg cemetery, the press has been referring of
ten to the Nazi terror and its victims. Reagan's visit
was insensitive and dishonored these victims; but
the press too is failing in its chance to honor all of
those who suffered and died at the Nazis' hands by
continuing to perpetuate the false idea that "the

VIEWPOINT

Holocaust" was an exclusively Jewish experience.
Reference is almost always made to the extermina
tion of 6 million Jews, while other victims, when
mentioned, are consistently grouped together as
"millions of others" or "millions of non-Jews." I
would venture that in the minds of most of the
American public, the term "the Holocaust" (which
itself improperly implies a sole historical episode of
horror and tragedy), and any reference to Nazi
atrocities brings to mind only Jewish victims.
Stephen Debenham, in his column "Holocaust
continues behind Iron Curtain" (The Daily, May
14), can state, "Thus, May 8, 1945, is fixed in
memory as much to celebrate the Allied liberation
of Europe as it is to commemorate and to mourn
more than 6 million Jews who died under Nazi
tyranny," and no one is going to stop to question
the gross injustice he does to millions. Why does it
not also mourn and commemorate the communists
afid homosexuals and Jehovah's Witnesses and
members of so many other groups killed and perse
cuted by the Nazis? Why shouldn't the murdered
Oypsies, targeted for extermination like the Jews,
also be mourned?
And why not the Slavs? Himmler told his SS
generals that 30 million Slavs had to be killed. Two
million, five hundred thousand non-Jewish Poles
were murdered, another 5 million enslaved. Rus
sian prisoners of war were brought to extermina
tion camps, where more than 4 million perished.

Why shouldn't the murdered Gypsies, targeted for
extermination like the Jews, also be mourned? Why
not the Slavs?

Are these figures so insignificant in comparison
with the deaths of Jews that they are not deserving
of mention, and hiding the names of the specific
peoples in the anonymity of terms like "millions of
non-Jews" is acceptable?
It is my intention neither to deny the fact of the
Final Solution and the Nazi killings of millions of
European Jews, nor to take away from the
episode's tragic proportions. But when the millions

of other victims become nameless, this too is a
tragedy. In a May 2 letter to The Daily, which it
chose not to print, I wrote in response to a small
item in the same day's issue which told of the order
of extradition of Andrija Artukovic to Yugoslavia
(from California) for crimes committed in the Nazi
puppet state of Croatia during the war. Toward the
end, the article stated that as interior minister, Ar
tukovic was allegedly " responsible for the deaths of
some 700,000 Jews, Gypsies and Serbs." There
were some 700,000 victims of Artukovic and the
Croatian government; but the vast majority of
those murdered were Serbs.

Are these figures so insignificant in comparison with
the deaths of Jews that they are not deserving of
mention, and hiding the names of the specific
peoples in the anonymity of terms like 'millions of
non-Jews' is acceptable?

In that letter, I cited two sources as evidence; I
could give hundreds more — it is simply a fact, and
I hope it wasn't doubt of the accuracy of my state
ments that led The Daily not to print my letter.
For the sake of credibility, here is the respected
Nora Levin in "The Holocaust": "When unleashed
after April 1941, the Ustashi (the Croatian group
which carried out the atrocities) murdered and
tortured Jews and Serbs in indescribably bestial
fashion. One of the most notorious camps in Hit
ler's Europe, Jascnovac, was in Croatia. Here the
Ustashi used primitive implements in putting their

victims to death — knives, axes, hammers, and
other iron tools. A characteristic method was bin
ding pairs of prisoners, back to back, and then
throwing them into the Sava River. One source es
timates that 770.000 Serbs, 40,000 Gypsies and
20.000 Jews were done to death in the Jasenovac
camp."
The horror of this passage needs no comment,
except that it is an episode virtually unknown in our

country. I have been wondering about The Daily's
decision not to print my letter. I think it may have
been that my contention that calling the murders
"the deaths of some 700,000 Jews, Gypsies and
Serbs" distorts the realities of history was seen as a
squabble and a very minor point. All three groups
were mentioned after all, and shouldn't I be con
tent that the article informed the public of the mur
ders?
To draw up an analogous situation, suppose the
press, writing on Reagan's visit to Germany,
referred to Hitler's "alleged responsibility for the
deaths of millions of Jehovah's Witnesses, Gypsies

and Jews." Imagine the (justified) outcry! It would
be widely viewed as an affront to the millions of
Jews killed by the Nazis, a grave insult likely inter
preted by many as anti-Semitic. Failure to ac
knowledge the outcry would probably justify such
an interpretation. Is not a similar insult delivered to
the hundreds of thousands of Serbs murdered
simply because they were Serbs?
I am unfortunately led to consider that because
Serbians are not perceived as a group with "media
value" or with which the public can "identify," The
Daily did not bother to print my letter. Somehow I
think the editors' attention might have been caught
if I was talking about the virtually unknown
genocide of nearly a million French. Or about the
massacre of Armenians or Cambodians, the
oppression of black South Africans, the starvation
of the Ethiopians, or about any other suffering
group which the press has currently chosen to be "a
la mode." Of course the tragedies of these peoples
should be known, but I would like to think that The
Daily has more integrity and concern than to just
jump on the bandwagon of popular causes.
The 40th anniversary of the end of the war in
Europe offers an excellent opportunity to recog
nize and honor all those who suffered and died at
the hands of the Nazis and their accomplices. The
call to "never forget" should not apply only to
those who are already remembered, and I sincerely
