# Research ties heart, alcohol

Stanford researchers have estab
lished a link between moderate alco
hol consumption and a protein
believed to reduce the risk of heart
disease.
Studies observing drinkers and
non-drinkers over time have already
established that there is some link, in
dependent of other factors, between
moderate alcohol consumption and
reduced risk of heart disease. The
Stanford study's significance is that it
traces a possible direct connection by
demonstrating that alcohol affects
blood levels of a substance called
apolipoprotein A-l. APO A-l has
been established as a factor in
predicting heart disease risk.
But researchers at the Stanford
Center for Research in Disease Pre
vention (SCRDP), where the 14-
week study was conducted, warned
that the results should not be taken as
an incentive to drink.
"Alcohol has the potential to be an
extremely hazardous drug and should
be treated with caution," said Carlos
Camargo, who initiated the study last
year as a Stanford undergraduate in
human biology.
Camargo said, "We certainly don't
want people to think fhat if two
drinks are good, four drinks must be
better. Nor should anyone consider
driving while under the influence of
alcohol
The study, reported in today's issue
of the Journal of the American Medi
cal Association, monitored 24
healthy men in periods of moderate
drinking and abstinence. The sub
jects' levels of APO A-l increased
when they drank and decreased
during periods of abstinence.
APO A-l is a component of the so
called "good cholesterol," high
density lippoprotein (HDL). Earlier
studies have shown that alcohol con
sumption increases HDL-cholesterol
levels. But until this study, it was not
known if alcohol consumption actu
ally affects active components of
HDL.
APO-A1 has been identified as an
essential, functioning component of
HDL. "APO-A1 may be a better
predictor of heart disease risk than
HDL-cholesterol," said Camargo,
who is now a first-year medical stu-
