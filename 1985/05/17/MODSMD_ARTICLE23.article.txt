## Women netters whitewash Crimson 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
OKLAHOMA CITY — It was no mystery
why Harvard Women's Tennis Coach Don
Usher walked briskly off the court after Stan
ford eliminated his team 9-0 in the wind
swept first round of the NCAA champion
ships here.
"It doesn't pay to take exams and try to
play tennis at the same time," said Usher,
whose players took final exams in their hotel
rooms yesterday morning before the match.
"I think that says it all," Usher continued.
"Plus, we had to play the No. 1 team in the
country."
Making Usher's nightmare even more real
was the absence of his top player, Elizabeth
Evans, the nation's seventh-ranked singles
player. Evans, a senior, was at Harvard study
ing for an exam she needed to pass for
graduation and, in Usher's words, "couldn't
make" a flight which would have brought her
here in time for the match.
Regardless, it wouldn't have mattered.
Evans or no Evans, the "Stanford of the
East" is no match for the Stanford of the West
when it comes to tennis.
"It wouldn't have made much difference,"
said Stanford Coach Frank Brennan, whose
team advanced to today's quarterfinals
against eighth-seeded Trinity (Texas). "I
would have preferred her (Evans) to be here,
so we might have had some tougher
matches."
As it was, none of them even approached
tough. Stanford, trying to win its second
straight NCAA team title and third in four
years, won all six singles and three doubles
matches in straight sets. In games, the Card
inal won by a 110-33 margin.
"The matches were all quite easy, so
nobody had any traumatic experiences,"
Brennan said. "When you beat somebody one
and one (6-1, 6-1), you have to feel good. It

was a good day to see who needs towels, who
needs Gatorade, and to check out the back
court sightlines."
Senior team captain Linda Gates led the
Cardinal barrage with a 6-2, 6-2 victory over
Erika Smith at No. 1 singles, avenging an ear
lier loss to Smith when the teams met in
March.
"You're kind of nervous when you go out
there to play someone you lost to before,"
Gates said. "The way she played the first
game was the same way she played when she
beat me before, but then 1 settled down and
got things under control."
At No. 2 singles, Patty Fendick was equally
awesome, hitting in 31 of her 39 first serves
en route to a 6-3, 6-1 win. Leigh Anne
Eldredge, Stephanie Savides, Kay Tittle and
Alyce Werdel had no problems at third
through sixth singles, each winning at least
one love set.
The closest the Cardinal came to losing a
set was at No. 3 doubles, where Savides and
Tittle were forced to win a 7-3 tiebreaker in
the first set of their 7-6, 6-2 triumph over
Debbie Kaufman and Roberta Hing.
"You're always nervous in your first match
of the NCAAs, so it's nice to go out there and
win all nine matches on the first day," Gates
said. "I think after the way we played today,
people have to be confident going into tomor
row's match."
Gates and her teammates hope things today
will be as easy as they were yesterday, but
they're not counting on it. Trinity, 24-6, has
been ranked as high as fourth nationally this
season, and routed ninth-seeded UCLA 8-1
yesterday.
"I think Trinity is much better than eighth
in the country," Brennan said. "They should
be at least fifth or sixth. We've only seen them
once this season — at a preseason tournament
in Palm Springs, but we know what they've

got. They're a very good team."
Trinity has three players ranked in the top
30 nationally in singles, including third
ranked Gretchen Rush and 2()th-ranked Lisa
Sassano. Rush will play Gates, her former
junior doubles partner, at No. 1 singles in
what should be today's best matchup. Rush is
ranked second in doubles, as she teams with
Sassano to form Trinity's No. 1 team.
If Stanford gets by Trinity, it will face a
team from Florida — either fourth-seeded
Miami or fifth-seeded Florida — in tomor
row's semifinal. In the final, the Cardinal
most likely would face rival USC for the
fourth time this season.
USC, meanwhile, appeared that it would
have a tougher time reaching the final, with
seventh-seeded San Diego State and third
seeded Texas as probable quarterfinal and
semifinal opponents. But in the day's sole up
set, host Oklahoma State, the 14th seed, up
set Texas 6-3 and, in effect, eliminated USC's
only real roadblock to the final.
"I think our draw is tougher," Brennan
said. "I think Trinity and Miami are pretty
scary opponents. I'd rather have his (Trojan
Coach Dave Borelli's) draw."
Brennan has refused to label his team the
heavy favorite to repeat as national champs.
And after looking at USC's lineup yesterday,
he may even consider the Cardinal a slight un
derdog.
That's because Caroline Kuhlman, the
Trojans' top netter who has been sidelined
with a badly sprained ankle since March 27, is
playing again. In fact, Kuhlman played No. 1
singles yesterday with a air-cast on her ankle
and beat Arizona State's Sheri Norris 6-1, 6-
2. Norris is the nation's 15th-ranked singles
player.
"It's the first time we've been playing com-

ranked Gretchen Rush of Trinity.
pletely healthy in a few months,"
Borelli said yesterday. "Having
Caroline back does a lot for our kids.
It especially helps our doubles.
"The last few weeks, we've been
playing on the strength of our singles,
trying to get up at least 4-2 going into
doubles. But with Kuhlman in there,
we're greatly improved in doubles,
too."
The last time the two teams met,
USC led 4-2 after the singles, and
then watched as Stanford swept the
doubles to win 5-4. However, with
Kuhlman playing No. 1 singles and
doubles, falling behind 4-2 after
singles is a luxury the Cardinal won't
have.
Card notes
Fendick has won her last 17
straight singles matches and is 30-3
overall in singles this season.
Stanford's 9-0 victory was its
second straight shutout and ninth of
the season.
Yesterday's victory was the Card
inal's 12th straight this season.
