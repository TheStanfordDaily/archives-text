# Card crews at Pac Coasts this weekend
## 
### KEITH SEINFELD 
The Stanford men's and women's crew teams
departed yesterday for Sacramento, where they
hope to get settled and familiar with the course for
this weekend's Pacific Coast Rowing Champion
ships.
After a marathon workout in the darkness Wed
nesday night, lasting until 2 a.m., the Cardinal
men's team left at 2:30 yesterday afternoon. They
are spending this weekend in various private homes
in the Sacramento area.
Stanford Coaches Ken Dreyfuss, Jim Farwell and
John Davis want the teams to row as much as possi
ble on the championship course and then a get good
night's sleep before tomorrow's races.
Racing begins on Lake Natoma at 7 a.m. tomor
row, and continues until sundown. Competition
resumes Sunday morning at 7 for those teams that
are successful in tomorrow's heats, concluding when
a winner has been determined in each division.
There will be races for both men's and women's
varsity, junior varsity, novice and freshman eight
man crews, and for varsity and novice fours. And in
every division, perennial powerhouse Washington
will be a heavy favorite.
Stanford will need to finish second in most
categories to advance to the nationals, and this
should lead to several spirited duels with second
rated California.
The Cardinal crews have been concentrating on
higher stroke rates, better efficiency and other tech
nical improvements for several weeks in prepara
tion for the season's climax. Farwell described
"trying to increase the stroke rate" as being
"similar to a runner changing from the 800 meters
to the 400 meters."
The first-place finishers will receive an automatic
invitation to the nationals, if they ask for one. Crew
tradition requires that, before being considered, a
team must request an invitation to the nationals.
The men's National Collegiate Rowing Cham
pionships will be held in Cincinnati, while the
Women's Collegiate Nationals will be in
Springfield, Va.
