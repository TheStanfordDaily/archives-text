# Men netters open at NCAAs
## 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
Stanford Men's Tennis Coach Dick Gould, in
his 18th year at the helm of the Cardinal, is
taking yet another team to the NCAAs this
weekend in Georgia, but Gould says he's far
from tired of making the trek to the small town
of Athens for the national championships.
"This is what we wait so patiently for all year.
This is what counts," Gould said.
Indeed, for all the insignificant preseason
matches, and all the tougher Pacific 10 Confer
ence wins (and losses), Stanford is heading once
again to Georgia this year ranked third in the
nation, and with the corresponding third seed in
the NCAA tournament.
It's almost as if the season never took place.
The teams that were supposed to get to the
championships did, and it's at the NCAAs
where the real play begins.
Gould said, as he has said about the season as
a whole, that his team will take the tournament
a match at a time, never looking ahead, yet
confident the team will advance.
But even though the Cardinal plans to stay
alive in the tournament one day at a time, both
coach and players are well aware that to win the
national title, Stanford will probably have to
defeat No. 2-ranked USC in the semifinals, and
No. 1-ranked UCLA in the final match.
Stanford and UCLA are traditional rivals in
NCAA championships and Pac-10 titles.
Twelve years have passed since a team other
than Stanford or UCLA won the NCAAs, and
15 years have gone by since a team other than
Stanford or UCLA won the Pac-10.
Stanford's tally this season is 1-1 against
UCLA, and 1-2 against USC. The Cardinal lost
its last matches against UCLA and USC, 8-1
and 5-4. Both were played in Los Angeles,
however, and Athens, the traditional spot for
the men's championship, effectively takes the
home court advantage away from all West
Coast teams.
"Obviously, if we play USC and UCLA,
those will be the crucial matches. But if we all
play well, we should do all right," Stanford's
Derrick Rostagno said. "Coach has told us we
can pull out of anything if we have to."
Unfortunately Stanford couldn't pull out of

the 1984 NCAA final match against UCLA
with a national title. The Cardinal lost to the
Bruins, 5-4. John Letts and Jim Grabb played in
the deciding doubles match, and Letts remem
bers the match well, down to the last few points.
"It would be nice if Jim and I could play to
gether again this year," Letts said earlier this
season. At the time, Gould had split up Stan
ford's best duo to even out the playing talent,
and it looked as if the 1985 NCAAs would have
Letts playing with Scott Moody, and Grabb
playing with Dan Goldie.
Grabb and Letts are back together again,
however, and have a chance to play UCLA in
the finals again.
"The split worked out reasonably well, but
what happened was that Eric (Rosenfeld) came
in when Jim was hurt and played so well he, in
effect, worked his way back into the lineup,"
Gould said.
"I obviously wanted to be in the lineup, but I
don't think the good results were due to my
playing any better," Rosenfeld said. "The Pac
-10 was the deciding factor." Rosenfeld and
Goldie won the Pac-10 doubles championship
in April. "We beat one USC and two UCLA
doubles teams in the tournament."
Goldie and Rosenfeld are no strangers to
playing doubles together. They were doubles
partners as freshmen, and are now playing to
gether again as juniors.
Stanford's first match this weekend will be
against Brigham Young. BYU was not ranked
in the last Head Intercollegiate Tennis Stand
ings, but was invited to the NCAAs as one of
the required representatives of each of the na
tion's eight regions.
Gould said he knows little about BYU, but
does know a lot about the Cardinal's probable
second-round opponent, Georgia. Georgia is
seeded sixth, and upset USC in the second
round of last year's NCAA tournament, accord
ing to Gould.
"Getting past Georgia won't be easy at all.
That's what USC thought last year, that getting
to the semis would be easy. Georgia took care
of that," Gould said.
Georgia also has Michael Pernfors playing
No. 1 singles. Pernfors was ranked No. 1 in the

with Eric Rosenfeld in doubles at this weekend's NCAA team cham
pionships at Athens, Ga.
nation in the preseason poll, but lost
the top spot to Goldie after losing in
the All American Individual Indoor
Championship in February. Goldie
has retained the No. 1 standing all
season.
On paper, Stanford can expect to
advance at least to the semifinals of
the NCAAs, but Gould said last
year's first- and second-round
matches gave him and the team a
good scare.
"It was crazy last year. In our first
match against Clemson, we won three
out of six singles and then let two of
the doubles matches go to three sets.
Against SMU (Southern Methodist),
in our next match, we lost the first
three singles matches again, right off
the bat," Gould said.
Stanford won both its matches
against Clemson and SMU, however,
and to Gould that's all that counts.
"I don't care as long as we win. All
the matches at this point are close.
The guys were definitely a cardiac
crew in that first match, but hey, once
you've won, it's all over," Gould said.
Single elimination appears to be
the name of the national champion
ship game. Tennis may be the
gentleman's sport, but when it comes
to national titles, there is an over
abundance of good teams with good
records and good players.
"Everyone is better this year,"
Gould said. But is this year's Cardinal
better? "We'll find out."
