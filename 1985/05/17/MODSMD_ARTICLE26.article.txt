# Six-Pac champs prep for regionals
## 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
The No. 2-ranked Stanford baseball team closes out its
regular-season schedule this weekend with a three-game
series against California. The series begins today with a 3
p.m. game at Sunken Diamond.
On the mound, today's game will be a matchup of two
All Six-Pac performers. Mark Sampson (7-4, 3.68 ERA)
will pitch for Cal, opposing Stanford ace Jeff Ballard (11-
2, 3.45).
The two teams travel to Evans Diamond in Berkeley for
tomorrow's 1 p.m. contest. Stanford's Jack McDowell (9-
4, 4.40), who received honorable mention in the All Six-
Pac voting, will take on Will Schock (6-3, 4.83), who
hasn't won since March 30 against USC.
On Sunday, the Cardinal will host the series finale at 1
p.m. Rob Wassenaar (9-2, 5.83) will be the Stanford
starter. Coach Bob Milano has not announced who will
pitch for Cal, but it is likely that his choice will be 6-foot-9
Dave Masters (5-3, 4.43).
Having clinched the Pacific 10 Southern Division title
and a berth in next weekend's NCAA West Regional,
Stanford doesn't have a lot at stake this weekend. But
don't expect the Cardinal to be cruising.
"Whenever we play, we want to play the best we can.
Going into regionals, we want to be playing well," Stan
ford Coach Mark Marquess said. "We'll play as hard as if
it were all on the line."
For the 16th-ranked Bears, it is all on the line. Cal is
currently nursing a half-game lead over Arizona in the
Six-Pac. Both the Bears and the Wildcats will possibly —
but by no means certainly — receive an at-large berth in
the regionals.
An impressive performance over the weekend could be
the difference for Cal — a fact not lost on Milano. "We
have to be extremely competitive," Milano said. "A 15-3
blowout will be bad for us."
The Bears suffered two such blowouts when they met
the Cardinal six weeks ago, losing 9-1 and 7-1 before ral
lying to win the series finale 10-8.
Although Milano was confident that two wins this
weekend would get his team a spot, Marquess, a member

of the NCAA selection committee, wasn't so sure.
"There are important factors out of their (Cal's and
Arizona's) control," Marquess said, explaining that
postseason tournaments in other conferences could have a
large impact. "They could lose all three and make it, or
win all three and not make it."
Winning all three will not be easy for Cal, considering
that the Bears haven't won at Stanford in more than four
years. According to Milano, Cal has had trouble with the
spacious foul territory of Sunken Diamond, but the
Bears' problem this year, instead of the stadium's dimen
sions, has been its occupants.
"By far, this is the best ballclub I've seen them have in
the last four or five years," Milano said. "They play well
defensively, they have good pitching, and they can really
get on a roll."
Milano believes that the difference between the two
teams is that his squad lacks the Cardinal's offensive
firepower. "We rely on sound defense and real clutch hit
ting. We're not the same type of team as Stanford,"
Milano said. "We have to create offense — run a little bit
and take gambles. We don't have guys like (Mark) Davis
and (Rick) Lundblade to pick us up."
Although Cal is averaging only .967 homers per game
compared to Stanford's 1.35, the Bears do have some
punch. Both Jeff Weiss (.330, 1 1 HRs, 55 RBIs) and
Lance Blankenship (.292, 8 HRs, 68 RBIs) were first
team All Six-Pac choices.
The stolen base has been an integral part of Cal's attack
this year. The Bears have stolen 186 bases, compared to
129 for the Cardinal. Rich Harger is Cal's leading thief
with 52 steals, followed by Blankenship with 44 and
Honorable Mention All Six-Pac shortstop Dan Truax with
27.
"They run a lot more than we do," Marquess said.
"(But) we've got the one big guy."
The one big guy is Lundblade, the Six-Pac Player of the
Year. With his .415 average, 24 homers and 81 RBIs, the
senior first baseman made it easy for the conference
coaches to select the league's top player. Unless his
average drops 30 points or Davis (.374) gets very hot this
weekend, Lundblade will win the league's Triple Crown.

An impressive performance over the weekend could be
the difference for Cal — a fact not lost on Milano. "We
have to be extremely competitive," Milano said. "A 15-3
blowout will be bad for us."
The Bears suffered two such blowouts when they met
the Cardinal six weeks ago, losing 9-1 and 7-1 before ral
lying to win the series finale 10-8.
Although Milano was confident that two wins this
weekend would get his team a spot, Marquess, a member

of the NCAA selection committee, wasn't so sure.
"There are important factors out of their (Cal's and
Arizona's) control," Marquess said, explaining that
postseason tournaments in other conferences could have a
large impact. "They could lose all three and make it, or
win all three and not make it."
Winning all three will not be easy for Cal, considering
that the Bears haven't won at Stanford in more than four
years. According to Milano, Cal has had trouble with the
spacious foul territory of Sunken Diamond, but the
Bears' problem this year, instead of the stadium's dimen
sions, has been its occupants.
"By far, this is the best ballclub I've seen them have in
the last four or five years," Milano said. "They play well
defensively, they have good pitching, and they can really
get on a roll."
Milano believes that the difference between the two
teams is that his squad lacks the Cardinal's offensive
firepower. "We rely on sound defense and real clutch hit
ting. We're not the same type of team as Stanford,"
Milano said. "We have to create offense — run a little bit
and take gambles. We don't have guys like (Mark) Davis
and (Rick) Lundblade to pick us up."
Although Cal is averaging only .967 homers per game
compared to Stanford's 1.35, the Bears do have some
punch. Both Jeff Weiss (.330, 1 1 HRs, 55 RBIs) and
Lance Blankenship (.292, 8 HRs, 68 RBIs) were first
team All Six-Pac choices.
The stolen base has been an integral part of Cal's attack
this year. The Bears have stolen 186 bases, compared to
129 for the Cardinal. Rich Harger is Cal's leading thief
with 52 steals, followed by Blankenship with 44 and
Honorable Mention All Six-Pac shortstop Dan Truax with
27.
"They run a lot more than we do," Marquess said.
"(But) we've got the one big guy."
The one big guy is Lundblade, the Six-Pac Player of the
Year. With his .415 average, 24 homers and 81 RBIs, the
senior first baseman made it easy for the conference
coaches to select the league's top player. Unless his
average drops 30 points or Davis (.374) gets very hot this
weekend, Lundblade will win the league's Triple Crown.
