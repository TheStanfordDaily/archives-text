## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
Thanks to some fine sailing by nine Cardinal sailors and
a disqualification by two Long Beach sailors, the Stanford
Sailing Team was able to qualify for the National Sailing
Championships last weekend.
Stanford will go on to compete in the national cham
pionships June 4-7 at Old Dominion in Norfolk, Va.
Eleven teams competed Saturday and Sunday at Red
wood City in the Pacific Intercollegiate Yacht Racing As
sociation Championships, with the top two teams advanc
ing to nationals. On a low-point system, USC was the top
qualifier, with 59 points, followed by Stanford with 106.
Long Beach, although unable to qualify for nationals,
finished third with 112 points.
"Qualifying for nationals clearly made our entire sailing
season a success," Stanford Coach Joe Petrucci said.
"Heading into the competition, I felt we were about the
fourth-best team competing, but our total team effort
pulled us up into a strong second, just when we needed
it."
According to Petrucci, USC dominated the racing on
both Saturday and Sunday. Led by 1984 Olympian John

Shadden, the Trojans finished the meet more than 50
points ahead of the second-place Cardinal.
"Stanford, Long Beach and Irvine battled it out for
second the entire weekend, espcially on Sunday," Peturcci
said.
Following Saturday's first 11 races, Stanford was in
fourth place behind USC, Irvine and Long Beach, but on
Sunday the Cardinal quickly began pulling ahead into a
strong race for second place.
On Sunday Stanford received strong sailing from Doug
Hagen, Liz Egan, Doug Buckstaff, Tom Kuhnle and Al
vina O'Brien. Bukstaff, a freshman, skippered for the
Cardinal with Egan as crew tallied up first, fifth and sixth
place finishes in the B division for Stanford.
Entering the last race of the competition, a B division
race, the Cardinal trailed slightly behind Irvine. Accord
ing to Petrucci, this last race was the most crucial race of
the competition.
"I wasn't sure who I should put into the last race, but 1
finally decided to stick with experience, so I put in Kuhnle
with Egan as crew," Petrucci said. "Kuhnle is cool un
der pressure and I knew he would hold out and finish the
race with no complications."
