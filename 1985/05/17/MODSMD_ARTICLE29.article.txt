## Bay to Breakers brings frivolity to the City 
### VAL CRITES Editorial staff 
The Examiner Bay to Breakers
race has been called the world's big
gest singles bar, a cardiovascular
Mardi Gras, a rite of spring and a
moving block party. The race, which
traditionally brings 100,000 runners
together in a spirited celebration of
fitness and fun, will be held Sunday.
Many of the less serious individuals
run in costumes, making the throng of
runners behind the leaders resemble
a moving masquerade ball. The first
costumed runner appeared in 1940
dressed as Captain Kidd; last year the
number of persons registered to run
in costume rose to a record 4,500.
Madcap attire included the 49ers
Super Bowl trophy, the Transamerica
Pyramid, a Steinway piano and fa
mous cartoon figures.
Although many Stanford students
plan to participate in the event, the
majority are taking the race with a
little less frivolity and are not com
peting in outrageous outfits. The
devotion of the participants from
campus ranges from interested jog
gers to serious racers.
Scott Gable and Tom Kuhnle have
been training hard for the race, get
ting up to run every morning at 7
a.m. Gable commented, "It's the
most miserable feeling to get up to
run at 7, but it's worth it because it
wakes us up. Some people consider
our schedule masochistic, but it is
such a nice feeling of accomplishment
to finish each morning."
This race will be far larger than
anything Gable has experienced.
"The largest run I've previously com
peted in is the Cascade Run-Off in
Oregon, with about 12,000 runners.
If we can get to the front of the
crowd, we plan to run hard."
The serious runners will have to
avoid a lot of overgrown insects in the

race in order to finish quickly, for Bay
to Breakers is the permanent site of
the World Centipede Running Cham
pionships, established in 1978.
Centipedes must have 13 runners,
an antenna and a tail, and be con
nected by some tether. Categories in
clude velocepedes (all men),
splitpedes (coed), speedypedes (all
women) and minipedes (kids under
ninth grade).
Usually, these centipedes have a
unique theme, resulting in a
humorous and informal competition
for creativity raves. Some of the more
wacky centipedes from the past have
included Santa and his reindeer, a
pack of gorillas, a chain of cave men
chasing a chain of cave women, a
pack of M & M candies and the Bud
weisder Clydesdales pulling a keg of
beer.
The 74th annual footrace begins
with the starter's gun Sunday.
Five-hundred seeded runners
will begin the 7.46-mile route from a
special section at the front of the in
tersection of Spear and Howard
Streets in the City. All non-seeded
runners must enter the starting area
from the Embarcadco, and will be
separated from the seeded runners by
a row of race officials.
The course is a flat and fast 12-
kilometer route along city streets and
park land, with one major hill. The
course is intended to resemble a trip
from New York to San Francisco —
at both ends is a body of water.
Skyscrapers dominate the eastern
end, open space and roaming buffalo
in Golden Gate Park symbolize the
West.
Just beyond the two-mile mark lies
the infamous Hayes Street Hill, ap
proximately half a mile long, followed
by about a mile of more gentle, roll
ing terrain which runs by San Fran
cisco's famous Victorian houses. The

remaining 3.5 miles, through Golden
Gate Park, are downhill or flat. The
view for the last portion includes the
Conservatory of Flowers, buttalo at
pasture and the North Dutch
Windmill.
The first race, on Jan. 1, 1912, cel
ebrated the reconstruction of San
Francisco after the 1906 earthquake.
Called the "Cross-City Race," there
were 121 finishers — all men. Race
restrictions imposed the following
year required that the runners be
over 18 years old, have lived in Cali
fornia for more than three years, have
passed a mandatory pre-race medical
examination and be male.
Women could not officially run the
race until 1971. Bobbie Burke ran
anyway in 1940, and thereby earned
the distinction of being the first
"unofficial" woman runner. This
year, registered runners of both sexes
range in age from five to 90 years old,
and come from 45 states as well as
from England, New Zealand and
Australia. The pre-race medical ex
amination is also no longer required,
but is recommended.
In 1928, the race was changed from
New Year's Day to avoid conflicts
with college football schedules. The
race was renamed the Bay to
Breakers in 1963 and was officially
sanctioned as a 12-kilometer race by
The Athletic Congress last year.
Proceeds from the Examiner Bay
to Breakers benefit 21 Northern Cali
fornia charities, including the Red
Cross, the Friends of Recreation and
Parks, and the San Francisco Conser
vation Corps. Over the years, nearly a
million dollars have been raised by a
combination of entry fees and dona
tions by the race sponsors.
Following this year's race is
Footstock, a post-race festival and
exposition that will continue all day at

the Polo Field. Footstock will include
live entertainment, booths, the
awards ceremony and refreshments
of Miller Lite and Pepsi Free. Offi
cials suggest that runners meet their
friends at the Polo Field following the
race. It is located just off the race
route, so it provides a good opportu
nity for viewing the procession of
runners during the race.
Also at the Polo Field will be the
tables where runners can pick up
their official jade-green T-shirts with
the"I survived" slogan at the bottom.

Last year, more than 334,000
people watched the race live on tele
vision, and more than 401,000 people
viewed the evening highlight show.
Last year's coverage was broadcast
tape-delayed in Portland, Seattle, Los
Angeles and Hawaii.
This year, live coverage for
armchair runners begins at 8 a.m.,
with pre-race coverage beginning a
half hour earlier, on KPIX television.
The highlights show will be shown
from 6 to 7 p.m.
The shows will feature the whimsi

cal costumes of some of the runners,
as well as focusing on some of the top
talent competing. Among the seeded
runners expected to racc are 1984
Olympic marathon winner Joan
Benoit, men's record-holder Rod
Dixon and last year's female winner,
Nancy Ditz. Both the male and
female winners of the race will
receive a BMW automobile.
The San Francisco Examiner plans
to print the names and times of the
top 5,000 finishers in the race on
Monday.


Gorillas, reindeer and centipedes will join thousands of runners in a multi-colored throng through the streets
of San Francisco in Sunday's Examiner Bay to Breakers.

The course is a flat and fast 12-
kilometer route along city streets and
park land, with one major hill. The
course is intended to resemble a trip
from New York to San Francisco —
at both ends is a body of water.
Skyscrapers dominate the eastern
end, open space and roaming buffalo
in Golden Gate Park symbolize the
West.
Just beyond the two-mile mark lies
the infamous Hayes Street Hill, ap
proximately half a mile long, followed
by about a mile of more gentle, roll
ing terrain which runs by San Fran
cisco's famous Victorian houses. The

remaining 3.5 miles, through Golden
Gate Park, are downhill or flat. The
view for the last portion includes the
Conservatory of Flowers, buttalo at
pasture and the North Dutch
Windmill.
The first race, on Jan. 1, 1912, cel
ebrated the reconstruction of San
Francisco after the 1906 earthquake.
Called the "Cross-City Race," there
were 121 finishers — all men. Race
restrictions imposed the following
year required that the runners be
over 18 years old, have lived in Cali
fornia for more than three years, have
passed a mandatory pre-race medical
examination and be male.
Women could not officially run the
race until 1971. Bobbie Burke ran
anyway in 1940, and thereby earned
the distinction of being the first
"unofficial" woman runner. This
year, registered runners of both sexes
range in age from five to 90 years old,
and come from 45 states as well as
from England, New Zealand and
Australia. The pre-race medical ex
amination is also no longer required,
but is recommended.
In 1928, the race was changed from
New Year's Day to avoid conflicts
with college football schedules. The
race was renamed the Bay to
Breakers in 1963 and was officially
sanctioned as a 12-kilometer race by
The Athletic Congress last year.
Proceeds from the Examiner Bay
to Breakers benefit 21 Northern Cali
fornia charities, including the Red
Cross, the Friends of Recreation and
Parks, and the San Francisco Conser
vation Corps. Over the years, nearly a
million dollars have been raised by a
combination of entry fees and dona
tions by the race sponsors.
Following this year's race is
Footstock, a post-race festival and
exposition that will continue all day at

the Polo Field. Footstock will include
live entertainment, booths, the
awards ceremony and refreshments
of Miller Lite and Pepsi Free. Offi
cials suggest that runners meet their
friends at the Polo Field following the
race. It is located just off the race
route, so it provides a good opportu
nity for viewing the procession of
runners during the race.
Also at the Polo Field will be the
tables where runners can pick up
their official jade-green T-shirts with
the"I survived" slogan at the bottom.

Last year, more than 334,000
people watched the race live on tele
vision, and more than 401,000 people
viewed the evening highlight show.
Last year's coverage was broadcast
tape-delayed in Portland, Seattle, Los
Angeles and Hawaii.
This year, live coverage for
armchair runners begins at 8 a.m.,
with pre-race coverage beginning a
half hour earlier, on KPIX television.
The highlights show will be shown
from 6 to 7 p.m.
The shows will feature the whimsi

cal costumes of some of the runners,
as well as focusing on some of the top
talent competing. Among the seeded
runners expected to racc are 1984
Olympic marathon winner Joan
Benoit, men's record-holder Rod
Dixon and last year's female winner,
Nancy Ditz. Both the male and
female winners of the race will
receive a BMW automobile.
The San Francisco Examiner plans
to print the names and times of the
top 5,000 finishers in the race on
Monday.


Gorillas, reindeer and centipedes will join thousands of runners in a multi-colored throng through the streets
of San Francisco in Sunday's Examiner Bay to Breakers.
The Examiner Bay to Breakers
race has been called the world's big
gest singles bar, a cardiovascular
Mardi Gras, a rite of spring and a
moving block party. The race, which
traditionally brings 100,000 runners
together in a spirited celebration of
fitness and fun, will be held Sunday.
Many of the less serious individuals
run in costumes, making the throng of
runners behind the leaders resemble
a moving masquerade ball. The first
costumed runner appeared in 1940
dressed as Captain Kidd; last year the
number of persons registered to run
in costume rose to a record 4,500.
Madcap attire included the 49ers
Super Bowl trophy, the Transamerica
Pyramid, a Steinway piano and fa
mous cartoon figures.
Although many Stanford students
plan to participate in the event, the
majority are taking the race with a
little less frivolity and are not com
peting in outrageous outfits. The
devotion of the participants from
campus ranges from interested jog
gers to serious racers.
Scott Gable and Tom Kuhnle have
been training hard for the race, get
ting up to run every morning at 7
a.m. Gable commented, "It's the
most miserable feeling to get up to
run at 7, but it's worth it because it
wakes us up. Some people consider
our schedule masochistic, but it is
such a nice feeling of accomplishment
to finish each morning."
This race will be far larger than
anything Gable has experienced.
"The largest run I've previously com
peted in is the Cascade Run-Off in
Oregon, with about 12,000 runners.
If we can get to the front of the
crowd, we plan to run hard."
The serious runners will have to
avoid a lot of overgrown insects in the

race in order to finish quickly, for Bay
to Breakers is the permanent site of
the World Centipede Running Cham
pionships, established in 1978.
Centipedes must have 13 runners,
an antenna and a tail, and be con
nected by some tether. Categories in
clude velocepedes (all men),
splitpedes (coed), speedypedes (all
women) and minipedes (kids under
ninth grade).
Usually, these centipedes have a
unique theme, resulting in a
humorous and informal competition
for creativity raves. Some of the more
wacky centipedes from the past have
included Santa and his reindeer, a
pack of gorillas, a chain of cave men
chasing a chain of cave women, a
pack of M & M candies and the Bud
weisder Clydesdales pulling a keg of
beer.
The 74th annual footrace begins
with the starter's gun Sunday.
Five-hundred seeded runners
will begin the 7.46-mile route from a
special section at the front of the in
tersection of Spear and Howard
Streets in the City. All non-seeded
runners must enter the starting area
from the Embarcadco, and will be
separated from the seeded runners by
a row of race officials.
