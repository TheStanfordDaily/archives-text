## Experts disclose social difficulties in Poland 
### FRANK LESTER Staff writer 
Three members of the Stanford
community who have been actively
following the progression of events in
Poland told a small audience in His
tory Corner last night that more at
tention should be paid to the lack of
human rights in that Communist bloc
nation.
Calling Poland "the leading
country in Eastern Europe in terms of
moral resistance to the domination of
the Soviet Union," moderator and
Political Science Prof. Jan Triska said
concern should be directed to the fact
that the most populous country in
Eastern Europe is torn between two
irreconcilable wills: that of the mili
tary dicatatorship of General Woj
ciech Jaruzelski and that of the
people.
So far, the will of Jaruzelski holds
sway. But last night's forum seemed
to illustrate that the forced diversion
of Poland's goals in directions con
trary to the desires of the people can
only last so long before something
snaps.
Wojciech Zalewski, the curator of
Green Library's Russian and East
European Materials division, said
that between 94 and 98 percent of
Poles are baptized Roman Catholics.
This, he pointed out, is a strong in

dicator of the powerful moderating
influence that the church has in
Poland.
Zalewski said the church is a
"horizontal" rather than a "vertical"
institution of authority in Poland. Be
cause the Jaruzelski regime has
superseded the national media and
banned all suspicious forms of social
organization, the church has been the
main source of community for the
people, he said.
According to Zalewski, the church
in Poland has taken advantage of the
people's religious devotion with the
aim of unifying them and providing
them with much of the services that
go unsupplied by the regime. It brings
in professional medical personnel to
give marriage counseling to members
of its congregation; it puts on perfor
mances by Polish artists; it sponsors
lectures by the faculty of Polish uni
versities who could not otherwise
speak because of government censor
ship.
In sum, because it is "opposed
ideologically to atheistic institutions
such as the state," Zalewski said, the
church binds the Polish people to
gether in a spirit of trust and encour
ages the intellectual restlessness that

the military regime is so bent on stag
nating.
Joseph Jedd, the University's bur
sar emeritus, has traveled to Poland
and said he gets the sense that things
are changing rapidly there. He said
everyone with whom he talked
believes Jaruzelski is a traitor to the
Polish people despite his pretense of
performing a balancing act between
governing Poland and satisfying the
Soviet Union's implicit desires.
"They consider him a Russian gen
eral in a Polish uniform," Jedd said.
"They also say that he wears a short
coat so that when he has to go on his
knees in Moscow, it doesn't interfere
with his walking."
Kazimierz Poznanski, this year's
national fellow at Hoover Institution,
argued that the "biological survival"
of Poland is threatened by the
Jaruzelski regime. He acknowledged
the role of the church in keeping lines
of communication open among the
people, but added that the govern
ment is approaching success in its
goal to break the populace's spirit.
Thirty percent of the Polish popula
tion lives below the poverty line, ac
cording to Poznanski, and the rate of
alcoholism in Poland comes close to
that of the Soviet Union, where one
third of every family's budget is set
aside to buy liquor.
