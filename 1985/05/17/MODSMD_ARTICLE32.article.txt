## Ford chairman speaks Computers assist firm 
### ALLISON HARTWELL Staff writer 
In the last 10 years, the automobile industry has un
dergone the "biggest industrial revolution in peacetime
history," according to Donald Petersen, chairman of the
board of Fqjd Motor Co., the nation's second largest car
manufacturer.
Petersen, a graduate of the Graduate School of Business,
spoke yesterday at a seminar in the Center for Educa
tional Research at Stanford (CERAS) on Ford's use of
computers in meeting the demands of today's market.
Ford faced a loss of $1.5 billion in 1980, the biggest loss
in U.S. corporate history. By 1984, the company reversed
that situation and registered record profits.
Petersen attributes much of the turnaround to the com
pany's "massive facility transformation" from drafting
boards to "robotics, lasers and computers."
" 'Computer' is the magic word today," Petersen said.
Computers are now used in all facets of Ford's operations,
from initial design to final manufacturing. The revamping

of the company was necessary to make "the United States
competitive in a global market," he said.
Petersen is active in advising at the business school and
in the Engineering Department.
Ford's public affairs manager, Paul Preuss, said after
the seminar that the company's recent success is a product
of a "combination of factors." In addition to the increased
use of computer technology, he cited the healthy economy
and a "change in design philosophy" as factors in the
company's recovery.
Joining the seminar was Jack Telnack, chief design ex
ecutive for Ford's North American Division, who des
cribed Ford's innovative "user-friendly graphic system."
The system, called computational fluid dynamics, allows
the engineer to display the car design on a computer
screen in a three-dimensional "wire cage."
Such technology saves time, energy and money, accord
ing to Telnack. "Work that used to take a half day on a
draft table now takes 30 seconds," he said.
