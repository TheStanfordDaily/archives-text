Bonnie and Clyde (1967)
Kresge Auditorium
Burlesque segues to horror in Arthur
Penn's film about Clyde Barrow and
Bonnie Parker, the Depression bank
robbers who enjoyed a scandalous
popularity. The writers, David Newman
and Robert Benton (an editor and an art
director at Esquire Magazine), had been
inspired by the French New Wave films
based on American gangster pictures of
the 1930s and '40s (Truffaut's "Shoot
the Piano Player," Godard's
"Breathless" and especially "Band of
Outsiders"); borrowing their vision of
gangsterism as a style game, a series of
put-ons that somehow takes on the con
tent of reality without ever abandoning
the style of fiction, Newman and Benton
bring the genre back home. And Penn,
whose gift for astonishing tonal shifts was
first apparent in "The Left Handed
Gun," his Billy the Kid picture (1958),
brought his own esthetic to the project,
and his own interest in the interplay be
tween myth and reality. The result is the
best movie work done by Americans in
the 19605. Burnett Guffey
(photographer), Dean Tavoularis (art
director) and Dede Allen (editor) are
among the artists who perform at the
peak of their powers. And the cast is
peerless: Warren Beatty as Gyde, Faye
Dunaway as Bonnie, Gene Hackman as
Clyde's brother Buck, Estelle Parsons as
his wife Blanche, Michael J. Pollard as
C.W. Moss, driver for the Barrow Gang.
Among the supporting players who make
distinctive appearances are Denver Pyle,
Dub Taylor, Gene Wilder and Evans
Evans.
Plays tonight at 9,
Burden of Dreams (1982)
History Corner, Building 200, Room 2
Les Blank's documentary about the
making of Werner Herzog's
"Fitzcarraldo" is considerably more
compelling than "Fitzcarraldo" itself —
perhaps because its focal character, Her
zog, is more frighteningly (and convinc
ingly) obsessive than the hero of his own
film. Unmanageable terrors plague the
cast and crew, players bow out and are
replaced, locations shift, and yet the film
ing proceeds — and this possibly quite
mad director sits calmly before the
camera and talks about keeping his ac
tors prisoner in the jungles of Peru and
mentions the occasional fatal accident.
Not an especially well made documen
tary, but certainly a riveting one.
Plays today at noon.

A Soldier's Story (1984)
Memorial Auditorium
A black non-commissioned officer is
murdered at a black army base in
Louisiana in 1944, and Charles Fuller's
script, adapted from his Pulitzer Prize
winning play, covers the investigation of
the crime. Fuller's handling of racial is
sues evokes glossy Hollywood
"problem" dramas from the year the
picture is set in. The characters wear tags
tied to their lines that brand them as
Liberals or Rednecks, GOod Negroes or
Self-Hating Negroes, and his messages
come rattling through like a rickety but
reliable old locomotive, on the half hour.
The old-fashioned, straight-on approach
that the director, Norman Jewison, takes
to this stale material finishes the movie
off. Wretchedly acted by a cast that in
cludes three of the members of the
original New York cast (Adolph Caesar,
Larry Riley and Denzel Washington);
Jewison hasn't helped them to shape
their performances for the camera, so
they work up a stagey sweat.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 & 9:30.
The Blue Angel (1929)
Haus Mitteleuropa
Josef von Sternberg's Hollywood films
quickly descended into kitsch, but there

is no debate about the quality of this
German semi-expressionist classic,
adapted (by Karl Zuckmayer, Karl Vol-
Imoller and Robert Liebmann) from
Heinrich Mann's novel "Professor Un
rath." Emil Jannings gives a superlative
demonstration of how repressed
sexuality — the unlived life — leads to
unreasonable infatuation, emotional
blindness, and finally self-contempt and
violence. He plays a small-town
schoolmaster who, learning that his
adolescent pupils have been visiting a
local dive to watch the overtly sexual
performances of the singer, Lola Lola
(Marlene Dietrich), shows up at the club
to protest and falls hopelessly, foolishly
in love with her himself. The professor's
passion is balanced by Lola's sneering
dispassionateness. What Dietrich does in
this film may or may not be acting, but
it's amazing — and it made her a star.
Friedrich Hollaender wrote "Falling in
Love Again" and the other songs.
Plays Thursday evening at 7:30.
Napoleon (1927)
Maison Francaise
Kevin Brownlow reconstructed Abel
Gance's silent epic in 1981 and Carmine
Coppola furnished a splendid full-length
score; one of the great achievements of

film scholarship, this resurrected over
four-hour "Napoleon" is a tribute to one
of the world's great directors. One can
find plenty that's wrong with the movie
— the tone of religious awe in some of
the scenes that are meant to show
Napoleon's effect on his countrymen, the
sentimentality of the return to his family
at Corsica, the tedious Napoleon-
Josephine wooing scenes in Part Two,
and the stiff, Delsartean acting. (Gance
cast for the qualities he saw in his actors'
faces, and these faces — Albert
Dieudonne's, Gina Maries', Antonin Ar
taud's — imprint themselves on the
memory.) One could argue that Gance's
historical perspective lacks depth and
credibility, but Napleon isn't a psycho
logical study of a conqueror, and it isn't
even a view of history — it's about the
excitement of making movies, about
going farther than anyone ever had
before (and most people have since).
Cameras are attached to horses and car
riages and swing, pendulum-like, in the
great convention scene; the screen
breaks up into nine frames to represent
the chaos of a children's pillow fight; a
storm at sea is intercut with the "storm"
at the National Assembly, and the
visualization of the metaphor lends it
staggering force. And at the end, Gance
employs a triptych as a kaleidoscope, to

create a panorama, and for montage.
Gance's tone is joyous and playful; the
camera seems to be grinning.
Plays Thursday evening at 7.
Hiroshima Mon Amour (1959)
Cubberley Auditorium
A French woman tells her Japanese
lover all that she has seen in Hiroshima
— the museums, the monuments to the
1945 atrocity — and he replies,
repeatedly and in an unvarying
monotone, "You haven't seen anything
in Hiroshima. You haven't seen any
thing." Watching this picture is about as
interesting as listening to an hour and a
half of traffic noises — except that the
dialogue has considerably less vitality
than traffic. Alain Resnais directed, Mar
guerite Duras wrote the screenplay, and
Emmanuelle Riva gives a remarkably
modulated performance — all things
considered — as the woman.
Plays Tuesday evening at 8.
The T.A.M.I. Show (1965)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A super-deluxe edition of an
"American Bandstand"-type TV show,
this rock 'n' roll revue from the British
Invasion/Motown era is an invaluable

period piece, down to David Winters' go
go choreography. The director, Steve
Binder, doesn't really know what he's
doing, and the most monotonous
performers — Gerry and the
Pacemakers, with their curdled-nice-guy
style (Gerry is like a junior version of
Tommy Steele), and Lesley Gore, Queen
of the J.A.P.s (teenybopper division) —
are permitted to go through their entire,
repetitive repertoires. But how can you
complain about even an extremely bad
movie that has Smokey Robinson and
the Miracles (performing the unforget
table "You Really Got a Hold on Me"),
Marvin Gaye, James Brown and The
Rolling Stones? Even at this early stage
in their careers, the Stones look dis
reputable. and Mick Jagger has already
developed his technique of pulling back
from the audience, lapsing into a brood
ing introspection, and erupting — he's
hypnotic. With The Supremes, The
Beach Boys, Jan and Dean and Billy J.
Kramer.
Plays today through Monday with
"Stop Making Sense."
Faust (1926)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
In F.W. Murnau's Expressionistic
silent film of Goethe's "Faust" plays, the
title character (played by Gosta Ekman)
begins as a saintly scholar who makes a
pact with the devil in order to save his
plague-stricken neighbors. The show
piece role is Metphisto, and Emil Jan
nings plays it without restraint: It's an
immense performance, and immensely
funny. As a whole, this film is perhaps
too crowded and erratic to be called truly
great, and it contains passages of conven
tional Teutonic robustness, but it is full
of extraordinary sequences. With
Camilla Horn as a touching Marguerite.
Plays today with "Beauty and the
Devil."
The Last Laugh (1925)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
The great Emil Jannings plays a hotel
doorman who loses his job and must take
another as a washroom attendant; the
irony is that both jobs are really demean
ing, but the doorman retains at least a
semblance of dignity. F.W. Murnau di
rected this celebrated German Expres
sionist silent, which employs only a
handful of inter-titles, and it is visually so
exciting and eloquent that you hardly
need even the few the film supplies.
Plays Sunday with "Tartuffe."
