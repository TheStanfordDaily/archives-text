## Faculty hears Centennial plans Program improvements forecasted for students, faculty 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate cut short its
biweekly meeting yesterday, making
way for the annual meeting of the
Academic Council. The senate is a
subset of the Academic Council,
which contains all members of the
faculty.
The council, chaired by University
President Donald Kennedy, focused
its attention on the Centennial Cam
paign, with reports from Kennedy
and the Senate Advisory Committee
on Centennial Campaign Planning.
Chair of the SAC-CCP Lawrence
Ryan reported to the council on the
"central priorities and opportunities
for the campaign," which are divided
into three categories: improvement of
conditions for undergraduate stu
dents, faculty improvement in the
humanities, and the near west
campus.
For undergraduate students, the
campaign will focus on educational
programs, such as more honors pro
grams, individual research and sup
port for the interdisciplinary pro
grams, Ryan said. Other improve

ments being sought include housing,
financial aid and recreational
facilities, he said.
Faculty improvement, especially in
the humanities, has been a "major
focus," Kennedy said.
"One result (of the focus) is that
over the past five years, the
humanities have added more ap
pointments than the social sciences or
the natural sciences within the
humanities and sciences," he said.
Kennedy added that more needs to
be done, but said the fund-raising ef
forts in this area, prior to the Centen
nial, "have been very encouraging."
Kennedy also mentioned the need
to recruit younger faculty members to
combat "the demographic trends that
have increased the average age of the
Stanford faculty by nearly four years
in the past decade." He added that a
partial restructuring of the Univer
sity's early retirement programs was
also underway.
The near west campus is another
focal point of the Centennial Cam
paign. Improving the quality of both
the faculty and the facilities is a
necessity to counter "the capital

starvation of scientific research that is
to be found across American univer
sities as a consequence of 17 years of
government neglect," Kennedy said.
The limited space of the near west
campus has "seriously handicapped"
the departments located in this
region, he added.
Kennedy said this area of fund
raising is especially challenging be
cause donors have been reluctant for
"the construction of capital
facilities."
Extensive fund-raising activity was
also initiated for the School of
Medicine before the commencement
of the Centennial Campaign, Ken
nedy said.
"Hospital modernization became a
matter of extreme urgency, and the
opportunity arose to bring the
Children's Hospital at Stanford into a
direct physical relationship with the
newly configured Stanford University
Hospital," Kennedy said. "Given the
size of that planning task, it seemed
sensible to integrate it with our acute
needs for new space and a new design
for basic biomedical science."

At the Faculty Senate meeting that
preceded the Academic Council
meeting, most of the time was al
lotted to a question-and-answer ses
sion on South Africa between Ken
nedy and faculty members. Kennedy
briefed the senate on recent events
around campus concerning divest
ment, including the Board of Trustees
meeting earlier this week and the
demonstrators' blockade of trustees'
cars following the meeting.
Kennedy commented that no ar
rests have been made, because "in
our judgment, so far, no one has done
anything worth being arrested for."
He added that he is against promot
ing what he terms "chic arrests."
Computer Science Prof. John
McCarthy said, "Arrest is not the
only possible way of dealing with mis
conduct," implying that the recent
blockade could be a violation of the
University's Fundamental Standard.
"The right to drive one's car is an
individual right" and is not subject to
"University tactical considerations,"
McCarthy said. He said students are
using the anti-apartheid movement to
"go back to the 19605."
