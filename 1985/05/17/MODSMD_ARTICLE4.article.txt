# Res Ed eases sorority ban
## Pi Phis allowed functions without alcohol By STEPHEN KASIERSKI Staff writer

The probation of the Pi Beta Phi sorority has been
amended to allow social functions on campus without al
cohol, Norm Robinson announced yesterday.
Robinson, associate dean of Student Affairs for Resi
dential Education, placed the Pi Phis on social probation
April 24 after allegations of hazing activities at a bid ac
ceptance party one week earlier. The probation allowed
the sorority to hold business meetings, but prohibited all
social activities on campus, pending the completion of an
investigation by the Intersorority Council (ISC).
Robinson said a report submitted by the ISC last Friday
and the actions of the sorority were sufficient to warrant
altering the probationary conditions.
"What they have done so far is a very good first step,"
Robinson said. "That type of progress ought to be
recognized in some tangible way."
In a letter submitted yesterday to the Intersorority
Council, Robinson said there was currently "insufficient
evidence that the ISC and all Stanford sororities have
given careful consideration to the issues that arose out of
the Pi Phi activities of April 17" and that certain questions
"remain to be answered before 1 can determine whether
Pi Phi's probation should be lifted."
In the letter, Robison asked for evidence that "the In
tersorority Council has discussed with each sorority the is
sues of hazing and party control, and that each group has
had the time and made the effort to consider those issues
thoughtfully and thoroughly."

Robinson the ISC to review the exact cir
cumstances of the incident and to identify the escorts who
allegedly supplied alcohol to the pledges, including who
was "exactly responsible for the alcohol abuse that oc
curred."
Ivy Li, elected ISC president last week, blamed "a lack
of communication among the guests and the Pi Phis them
selves" as the source of the trouble.
Li told The Daily the Pi Phis have been "very
cooperative" throughout the investigation and have aided
in the development of hazing guidelines. "We had a
meeting with all the sorority presidents to explain what is
expected of them and their members," Li said.
Pi Phi President Jennifer Matuschek declined to com
ment, saying she had not yet seen Robinson's letter.
In his letter, Robinson said the development of specific
ISC guidelines to respond to possible future situations is
integral to the process.
"It is incumbent on the Intersorority Council to develop
means by which every group, and each member of every
group, is made aware of the issues of sound group gover
nance and collective responsibility, and ascribes to the
guidelines developed by the ISC."
Robinson said later,"lt's important to design mecha
nisms and policies ensuring that this kind of thing couldn't
happen again."
Diana Conklin, assistant dean of Student Affairs and
director of the Row, said this was the first opportunity to
"create and test" the ISC's judicial authority.
