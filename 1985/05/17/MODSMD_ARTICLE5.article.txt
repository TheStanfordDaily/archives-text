## Treasurer's Office evacuated 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Editorial staff 
An anonymous caller told the Uni
versity Treasurer's Office and the
Palo Alto Police Department yester
day afternoon that they had "two
hours to find the bomb at Stanford,"
but no explosions were reported and
nothing unusual was found in Univer
sity buildings, according to the police.
The calls began around 1:35 p.m.,
when the Palo Alto Police Depart
ment received an anonymous phone
call. Lt. Ed Austin said the caller told
a secretary: "You put me on hold for
five minutes, now you have two hours
to find the bomb at Stanford."
The Treasurer's Office, located in
downtown Palo Alto, received a
similar call about 20 minutes later,
according to Austin.
University Treasurer Rod Adams
said the office was evacuated and
he and several members of the Stan
ford Police Department later
searched it for unusual objects, but
nothing unusual was found. Adams
said this was the first bomb threat
received by the office since it moved
to its present location in 1982.
Still, said Adams, "It is not clear
whether it (the bomb threat) was di
rected to our office or to a building of
the University."
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington told the University News Ser
vice last night that the police
"checked one or two other places on
campus," but that no buildings here
were evacuated in response to the
threat. Nothing was found, he told
the University News Service.
The Treasurer's Office manages
the University's investment portfolio,
but the threats appeared to be more
closely related to a recent rash of
bombings at Bay Area colleges and
universities than to the recently con
tentious issue of divestment.
According to the receptionist at the
Treasurer's Office, a person with a
deep voice who "sounded definitely
like a male" called the office shortly
before 2 p.m. and said, "Stanford
University, you have two hours to lo
cate a bomb."
Before the receptionist could tell
him he had reached an off-campus
number, he said, "Remember
Berkeley, remember San Francisco,"
and then hung up. she said.

The receptionist said the office of
ten receives calls from people trying
to reach campus because the office's
number is one of only three listed in
the Palo Alto Yellow Pages under
Stanford University.
In the last three days, there have
been several bombings and threats at
Bay Area colleges and universities.
On Tuesday, police at
San Francisco State University
disarmed a pipe bomb they said was
powerful enough "to kill a couple of
people." At UC-Berkeley on Wed
nesday, a package with a bomb hid
den inside was found in a room used
by computer students. When
graduate student John Hauser tried
to open it, it exploded. Hauser was
listed in fair condition after undergo
ing surgery to repair damage to his
right hand, arm and eye, according to
the Associated Press.
Yesterday, police at City College in
San Francisco evacuated a building
after receiving a bomb threat.
"We received a phone call about
8:4(T this morning saying a bomb had
been placed in Batmale Hall. The
building has been evacuated," JoAnn
Hahn, a City College spokesman, told
the Associated Press. "There was a
suspicious box found. However, when
they opened it, it was a box of busi
ness cards."
Hahn said the building houses the
computer science, mathematics and
behavioral science departments,
along with a number of faculty
offices.
Adams said he doubts yesterday's
Stanford threat was related to the
divestment issue. "I would not think
any of those involved could in any
way rationalize . . . that bombing and
killing was morally good if they are
outraged at apartheid."
Adams said he did not think the
caller was a Stanford student, but
speculated that it was someone
mimickng the bombs and threats else
where.
Biko Plaza News, a publication by
divestment protesters at Berkeley,
said, "Everyone involved in the anti
apartheid movement condemns the
bomb attacks that have taken place
on our campus and at San Francisco
State. Any attempt to blame these at
tacks on the divestment movement is
an outrageous police lie."
