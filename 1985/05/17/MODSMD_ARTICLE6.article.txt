confrontation as the regents attempted to leave at 4:30
p.m.
Seventy-five demonstrators began circling the auto
mobile exit to Lawrence at 4 p.m., chanting "I will never
rest, 'til the old UC divests" as the police watched from

his team could return to its place behind the barricade, a
brief shoving exchange erupted between one policeman
and a few demonstrators who claimed that the officer
had pushed one of them to the ground for no reason.
