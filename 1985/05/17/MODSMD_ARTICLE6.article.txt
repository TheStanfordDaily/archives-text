# Berkeley, Stanford demonstrations continue
## UC Regents draw protest 
### DAVID RISSER Senior staff writer 
BERKELEY — Anti-apartheid protest here heated
up yesterday as several thousand demonstrators
marched two miles to a heavily guarded UC Board of
Regents meeting held in the hills above campus at the
Lawrence Hall of Science.
Dozens of police from various jurisdictions were pres
ent when the marchers reached the meeting place, hut
there were no arrests at Lawrence despite a very tense
confrontation as the regents attempted to leave at 4:30
p.m.
Seventy-five demonstrators began circling the auto
mobile exit to Lawrence at 4 p.m., chanting "I will never
rest, 'til the old UC divests" as the police watched from
behind a barricade surrounding the front of the building.
When a police motorcade for the regents arrived,
about 15 regents suddenly exited the building and
boarded cars and vans. As another 100 demonstrators
rushed to the driveway, 30 police officers entered the
crowd and forcibly created a path for the caravan.
The protestors lined the path and repeatedly shouted
"divest" as the vehicles slowly edged through the crowd.
An officer ordered "Single file, return," but before
his team could return to its place behind the barricade, a
brief shoving exchange erupted between one policeman
and a few demonstrators who claimed that the officer
had pushed one of them to the ground for no reason.
The confrontation did not result in arrests, but did anger
demonstrators who proceeded to raise their arms to

After the motorcade left, one
protester ran up an embankment to
announce, "That was a great dress
rehearsal for tomorrow," and the
demonstrators cheered.
Some have vowed to block the exit
today if the regents try to leave with
out totally divesting of the UC sys
tem's investments in companies with
business interests in South Africa.
"The regents must not be allowed
to leave until they decide to fully
divest," reads the Biko Plaza
News, printed daily by some
protesters. "If we want divestment,
we, all of us, must blockade," it con
tinues.
The protesters have renamed
Sproul Plaza here "Biko Plaza," after
Stephen Biko, an anti-apartheid
black South African who died while
in the custody of South African
police. A sleep-in on the steps of
Sproul Hall has entered its 38th day.
More than 600 protesters at Berkeley
have been arrested.
While the regents will hear presen
tations on apartheid and divestment
today, they are not expected to vote
on divestment until their June
meeting.
"There is nothing on the agenda.

but someone could bring a motion
(on divestment), said Fred Gaines, a
student representative to the board.
"I haven't heard anything yet," he
added.
According to Gaines, the pro
divestment protest movement has
had an effect on the regents meeting.
"It has shaped the agenda," he said.
"No regent can ignore the broad
based support on this issue."
Gaines, who supports divestment,
was particularly happy yesterday."I
think this is a tremendous turn
out. . . . It's wonderful to see every
one up here."
Some of those present were UC
designated "observers," university
staff members who volunteer to mon
itor such events.
A video crew from the District At
torney's office was also prepared to
record any confrontation.
Another march on Lawrence,
which has been renamed the " Azania
Hall of Science" by protesters, will
take place this morning. Those as
sembled will hear a broadcast of the
regents' meeting, and civil dis
obedience is likely to follow.
