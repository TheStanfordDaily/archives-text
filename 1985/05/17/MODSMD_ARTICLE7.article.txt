Calling their protest "very worthwhile," members of
Stanford Out of South Africa (SOSA) ended the two
day blockade of trustees' cars yesterday at noon and
then met to plan the group's strategy for the coming
months.
The blockade of 14 cars parked on Serra Street near
the Hoover Institution began Tuesday after the Board
of Trustees' decision not to support total divestment of
Stanford's holdings in companies doing business in
South Africa.
No arrests were made during this first act of civil dis
obedience at the University since 1977, when 294 stu
dents were arrested during a sit-in at Old Union.
"Doing the action was very worthwhile," said Steve
Phillips, a leader of SOSA and chair of the Black Stu
dent Union.
"Some trustees came and some sent people to pick
their cars up," said Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington. adding that the process was "all very amiable."
Phillips said members of SOSA spoke with a few of
the trustees, presenting each with a packet containing
information on SOSA's position calling for blanket
divestment and a personal letter from the group.
"None of them (the trustees) claimed to be upset" by
the blockade. Phillips said, adding that "more pressure"
is needed to change the trustees' views on divestment.
Approximately 60 protesters peacefully left the site of
the blockade around 3 p.m. and returned to the Inner

Members of SOSA met later in the
afternoon to plan the group's activi
ties for the next four to five months.
"We had a pretty good meeting

today," said Phillips, adding that
SOSA plans to "streamline what
we're doing." Although he didn't give
specific plans, he said that the group
intends to extend its "dorm out
reach" program.
Herrington told University News
Service that "the minute the
demonstration was over, there was a
rush for parking places."
