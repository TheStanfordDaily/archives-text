Soviet plane vanishes near Siberia
J
TOKYO — An aircraft that is believed to belong to the Soviet airline
Aeroflot vanished from Japanese radar screens yesterday off the coast of
Siberia, the government reported. Its fate remained a mystery.
Aeroflot and other Soviet officials in Tokyo said they had no informa
tion on the reports.
The incident occurred north of Japan, in the region where a South
Korean passenger jet was shot down by a Soviet fighter Sept. 1, 1983,
killing all 269 people aboard.
"It appears that an Aeroflot plane was missing somewhere between
Primorskiy and Sakhalin," Foreign Ministry spokesman Yoshio Hatano
said. He stressed that the identity of the aircraft "needs further con
firmation."
The city of Primorskiy is just west of Vladivostok, a major Siberian
seaport and home base for the Soviet Far East fleet. It is about 500 miles
southwest of the southern end of Sakhalin Island, over which the South
Korean jumbo jet was flying when it was attacked.
Hatano and other Japanese officials offered no further details on
whether the plane that vanished had crashed, or whether it was a cargo
or passenger flight.
The Defense Agency, possibly because of reluctance to reveal its
radar capabilities, provided few details about the aircraft reported mis
sing yesterday.
Spokesman Shinji Yazaki told a news conference: "One aircraft of the
Soviet Union was reported missing off the (Soviet) Maritime Territory
between 1 and 9 p.m."
Kyodo News Service quoted Foreign Ministry sources it did not iden
tify as saying there were unconfirmed reports the aircraft was a cargo
plane.
Reagan hails Duarte's performance
WASHINGTON — President Reagan said yesterday that leftist
forces are losing ground in El Salvador but are still exporting revolution
from Nicaragua, and urged that the United States muster "the courage
to help all our friends in Central America."
Reagan met in the Oval Office for a half hour with Salvadoran Presi
dent Jose Napoleon Duarte in what the White House later described as
"a celebration of progress" in the Salvadoran army's five-year battle
against the rebels and strides toward democractic development.
"Those who question our efforts in Central America should take note
of the heartwarming progress that President Duarte has made," Reagan
said, standing alongside the Salvadoran leader on the colonnade facing
the Rose Garden.
Reagan, rebuffed by Congress in his campaign to aid guerrillas bat
tling the leftist government of Nicaragua, said, "If there's to be peace
and democracy in the region, if our neighbors are to be spared the
tragedy that comes from every communist dictatorship, we must have
the courage to help all our friends in Central America."
Duarte is spending nine days in the United States, talking with top ad
ministration officials and congressional, business and labor leaders about
economic and military support for his country.
An administration official, briefing reporters on condition he not be
identified, said Duarte discussed with Reagan "specific needs" of his
country but did not present a formal request for additional aid. The ad
ministration indicated to Duarte "there would be sympathetic under
standing given to those specific needs," the official said.
Duarte also had lunch with Secretary of State George Shultz and later
told reporters he will not resume the peace dialogue with leftist rebels on
the same basis as before unless he receives prior assurances that the con
sultations would produce positive results.
Duarte said he was willing to engage in behind-the-scenes peace dis
cussions but that the insurgents have shown little interest in that ap
proach.
"They don't want to commit themselves to a process of making it a
success," he said.
TV clip shows a jolly Gorbachev
MOSCOW — An unusual television clip aired last night showed Mik
hail Gorbachev joking, shaking hands and telling students in Leningrad
their "young, creative brains" were needed to modernize the Soviet
Union.
"Let's move the country forward," Gorbachev urged middle-aged
women, old men and young people crowding around him in a Leningrad
street.
"Having a strong economy, we will have a strong defense and we will
continue the growth in well-being of the people." he pledged, gesticulat
ing and smiling frequently to lend force to his words. "We will do every
thing."
Soviet leaders are never shown on television chatting with the
populace in the easy-going manner that Gorbachev appeared to adopt
on the first day of the trip to Leningrad, the Soviet Union's second larg
est city.
It is Gorbachev's second foray outside the Kremlin to "meet the
people" in less than a month. In the 20-minute clip, Gorbachev was
shown alternately lecturing and joking with citizens Wednesday while
babies cried and horns of passing cars honked in the background.
40 reported killed in reprisal attack
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Attackers boarded a coastal ferry Wednes
day and hacked to death up to 40 Tamils in reprisal for a raid on a city by
Tamil separatists who killed nearly 150 people, officials and news
reports said.
At least 13 other Tamils were reported killed in reprisals around
Anuradhapura, site of the guerrilla raid Tuesday. The city and area are
mainly inhabited by the majority Sinhalese-speaking population, which
is predominantly Buddhist.
The Tamil-speaking minority, centered in the north, is mainly Hindu.
A government spokesman said the guerrillas who raided Anurad
hapura had been spotted by a military helicopter Wednesday in the Wil
pattu game preserve 30 miles west of the city.
Police said Sri Lankan navy sailors attacked the ferry off the northern
Jaffna Peninsula, where most Tamils live, killing about 40 people with
axes, swords and knives. The United News of India said 28 Tamils were
butchered, including a 4-year-old girl, and 30 were wounded.
A senior official in Colombo said, however, that he was convinced the
navy was not involved in the attack on the ferry travelling between the
islands of Delft and Pungudutivu off the Jaffna coast. He said his infor
mation was that "there are 31 dead and many more injured lying at the
Jaffna hospital."
Transport crisis slows Ethiopian aid
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — More than a million Ethiopians earning
rations by working on development projects may have to join food lines
because a transport crisis has slowed delivery of aid, the United Nations
office said Wednesday.
"Unless a solution can be found, this is a major setback to Ethiopia's
long-term plans to beat drought and famine," said Desmond Taylor, the
U.N. World Food Program's deputy representative.
"The only answer to the Ethiopian dilemma is the rapid mobilization
by the donor community of additional vehicles, spare parts and tires,"
Taylor said in a statement.
Taylor said all those working for rations live in drought areas.
The "food-for-work" program mobilized drought victims to help
plant trees, shore up eroded terraces on hillsides and plant crops. The
Rome-based World Food Program has called it the largest development
program in the country.
The World Food Program has spent about $88 million on the program
in the last three years as drought gripped this Horn of Africa nation.
But over the past three or four months only about two-fifths of the aid
arriving at Ethiopia's Red Sea port of Assab. most of it from the West, is
being cleared and sent to famine victims. Because of a truck shortage,
huge stockpiles of food have built up at the port.
