BEIRUT, Lebanon — The ex
tremists of Islamic Holy War said yes
terday they will free at least six
American and French hostages if
Kuwait releases the men convicted of
bombing the U.S. and French em
bassies there in 1983.
The group said in statements ac
companied by pictures of six hostages
kidnapped from Beirut streets that it
would "terrorize America" unless
authorities turn over "our brothers in
Kuwait."
Aidan Walsh, 49, Irish deputy
director of the U.N. Relief and
Works Agency, was freed unharmed
last night, 36 hours after eight gun
men kidnapped him in Moslem west
Beirut, Irish Ambassador Robert
McDonagh announced at the United
Nations in New York.
An Irish source in Beirut said:
"He's physically all right, but upset
by his ordeal."
Islamic Holy War said, "We will
not wait long," in one of three Arabic
language statements calling on the
U.S. and French governments to
pressure Kuwait.
The Reagan administration
rejected the demands. Deputy White
House spokesman Larry Speakes

said: "We will not allow ourselves to
be intimidated by terrorist threats."
The Shiite Moslem fundamentalist
group, whose name in Arabic is Jihad

lslami, said, "We shall terrorize
America and France forever" if
Kuwait does not free the men con
victed of bombing the U.S. and

French embassies and other targets
there on Dec. 12, 1983. Five people
were killed and 86 wounded.
Color photographs of four kid
napped Americans and two French
diplomats accompanied the state
ments, delivered in plain brown en
velopes to Beirut daily newspapers.
The grainy pictures, taken against
different backdrops, showed Terry
Anderson, 37, chief Middle East cor
respondent of The Associated Press;
U.S. Embassy official William Buck
ley, 56; the Rev. Benjamin Weir, a
60-year-old Presbyterian minister;
the Rev. Lawrence Jenco, 50, a
Roman Catholic priest, and and
French diplomats Marcel Fontaine,
45, and Marcel Carton, 62.
The messages were the first public
statements from Islamic Holy War,
although it recently has sent letters
and video tapes to the families of
some hostages.
To the hostages' families, it said:
"For the last time, we wish to stress
that all contact with your relatives
will be cut off and the consequences
will be catastrophic if you do not act
seriously and force your governments
to intervene for the release of the
men held in Kuwait."
