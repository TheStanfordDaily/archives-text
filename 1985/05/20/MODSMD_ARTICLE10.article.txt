MOVE threats told
PHILADELPHIA — MOVE threatened to
burn its neighborhood, "with smoke, fire, guns
and bullets," in a letter police received two days
before bombing the radical group's fortress,
Mayor Wilson Goode said yesterday.
Goode released copies of the letter, signed by
Ramona Africa — the only adult known to have
survived the police raid — on a day declared by
Goode as a citywide day of prayer for the 1 1
people killed in the assault and the 270 people
left homeless when 61 rowhouses burned.
Church services were held throughout
Philadelphia yesterday for the fire's victims.
The letter, received by police on May 11. said
MOVE members had stockpiled weapons and
fortified their home in a tidy west Philadelphias
neighborhood.
"It's gone be a mess, if MOVE go down, not
only will everybody in this block go down, the
knee joints of America will break and the body of
America will soon fall and we mean it,"the letter
said.
During an appearance on "Face the Nation,"
Goode was asked by CBS reporter Leslie Stahl
whether there had been "serious errors of judg
ment" to drop a bomb on a house containing
gasoline and explosives.
"I think that those of us that have hindsight
can say if in fact we had to proceed the same way

again we would not do that because of what hap
pened as a result of it,"the mayor said.
Goode called the members of MOVE "urban
guerrillas" who were "bent on absolute destruc
tion."
Police tried to evict the cult last Monday with
bullets, water hoses and tear gas. When a
stalemate developed, police dropped a bomb,
and the ensuing fire destroyed 53 rowhouses and
damaged eight others. Of the 11 dead in the
MOVE rowhouse, four were children.
MOVE member Jerry Africa, in an interview
the network said was taped Saturday and also
shown on "Face the Nation." said more trouble is
coming. MOVE members are demanding
freedom for nine fellow cultists convicted of mur
der in a 197N raid on a MOVE house in which a
Philadelphia police officer was killed.
"We are going to put more heat on the city. If
it comes down to a situation where people have
to put their lives on the line, MOVE people are
committed to that," Africa said.
"When I tell people that we will definitely seek
revenge and vindicate our brothers and sisters,
we're talking about the mayor as a politician." he
said. "Ajud when we say we're going to destroy
him, we're talking about destroying him politi
cally."
During a service at the First Baptist Church ot
Paschall. where he is a deacon, Goode said.
"Prav that out of these ashes there will indeed be

a phoenix. The one assurance I have is, as long as
I can keep my hand in God's hand, everything is
going to be all right."
Reagan may go to people
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, in an
Armed Forces Day radio speech, warned House
Democrats Saturday that he would take his case
to the American people if Congress did not com
promise with him on defense spending.
"My first responsibility as president is the
safety and security of the American people,"
Reagan said. "So if a suitable compromise can't
be worked out, I won't hesitate to put our case
before the American people and ask for your
support."
"I'll be conferring with the Congress and with
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger on the
military budget and believe me, our attack on
waste and fraud in procurement ... is going to
continue," he said in his weekly radio speech.
"But we must have adequate military appropria
tions."
Ambassador firing line
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administra
tion has devised what it hopes is a way to replace
politically appointed U.S. ambassadors without
making it appear they are being fired.
U.S. officials said the White House decided
several months ago without announcement to
limit envoys who are political appointees to two
and-one-half-year tours of duty.
The new approach enables the administration
to "depersonalize" the replacement of politically
appointed ambassadors by informing them they
are subject to the same time limitations, the offi
cials said.
Helms restates position
KILMARNOCK, Va. — U.S. Sen. Jesse
Helms praised the Lord and President Reagan
and condemned CBS News anchorman Dan
Rather on Saturday, saying, "I'm as proud as I
can be ol that fellow in the White House who is
saying biblical principles come first."
The North Carolinian was the featured speaker
at a gathering of some 1.500 Virginia
Republicans.
He said the biggest threat to freedom in the
United States "is the inability of Americans to
uet the truth."

I can keep my hand in God's hand, everything is
going to be all right."
Reagan may go to people
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, in an
Armed Forces Day radio speech, warned House
Democrats Saturday that he would take his case
to the American people if Congress did not com
promise with him on defense spending.
"My first responsibility as president is the
safety and security of the American people,"
Reagan said. "So if a suitable compromise can't
be worked out, I won't hesitate to put our case
before the American people and ask for your
support."
"I'll be conferring with the Congress and with
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger on the
military budget and believe me, our attack on
waste and fraud in procurement ... is going to
continue," he said in his weekly radio speech.
"But we must have adequate military appropria
tions."
Ambassador firing line
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administra
tion has devised what it hopes is a way to replace
politically appointed U.S. ambassadors without
making it appear they are being fired.
U.S. officials said the White House decided
several months ago without announcement to
limit envoys who are political appointees to two
and-one-half-year tours of duty.
The new approach enables the administration
to "depersonalize" the replacement of politically
appointed ambassadors by informing them they
are subject to the same time limitations, the offi
cials said.
Helms restates position
KILMARNOCK, Va. — U.S. Sen. Jesse
Helms praised the Lord and President Reagan
and condemned CBS News anchorman Dan
Rather on Saturday, saying, "I'm as proud as I
can be ol that fellow in the White House who is
saying biblical principles come first."
The North Carolinian was the featured speaker
at a gathering of some 1.500 Virginia
Republicans.
He said the biggest threat to freedom in the
United States "is the inability of Americans to
uet the truth."
