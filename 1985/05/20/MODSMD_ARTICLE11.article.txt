Mexico expels Angels
SAN DIEGO — Mexican border officials told
members of the Guardian Angels to stay out of
their country yesterday, but the group s founder
said members of his band would enter Mexico il
legally to patrol for border bandits.
Curtis Sliwa said members of the group refused
to declare themselves as tourists when they
arrived at the Mexican border, because their in
tent was to patrol a canyon-laced area where
people trying to enter the United States illegibly
are often attacked by the bandits.
"On Saturday, they just told us to remove our
T-shirts and berets." Sliwa said. "This time they
told us they wouldn't let us in. because we
wouldn't declare ourselves as tourists.
But Sliwa said his 32-member contingent
planned to cross the border illegally, "the same
way the bandits do." except that the Angels
would cross from north to south through holes in
the border's wire fence.
Sliwa said Saturday night's dawn to dusk patrol

succeeded, and claimed members of a San Diego
Police Department and Border Patrol crime
suppression unit warned the Guardian Angels
they were interfering with their stake out.
"They claimed that our patrols were scaring off
the bandits. But by us sweeping through there,
the bandits were running back and sneaking
through the fence into Mexico," Sliwa said.
"That's the whole idea — deterrence."
San Diego police spokesman Bill Robinson did
not immediately return a call from the Associ
ated Press yesterday.
Sliwa said some aliens had heard that "los an
geles guardinese" planned to patrol the border
over the weekend, but about 75 mistook the
volunteer force of 32 Angels for attackers and
hurled rocks at them. No one was injured.
He said 100 Mexican police in the border town
of Tijuana awaited the group Saturday and
threatened to arrest them if they didn't remove
their red berets and T-shirts, trademarks of the
organization begun in 1979 to fight crime on
New York's subwavs.

The Angels complied with the order, hut Sliwa
said they donned the items during night patrol on
hoth sides of the border, when no Mexican police
were visible.
He said the group planned to seek an order
from a Mexican court, possibly in Mexico City, to
allow them to wear the berets and T-shirts.
Mexican officials say outsiders are not allowed to
patrol in their country.
Local Mexican State Judicial Police officials
said the group was not welcome in Mexico.
"They have no business coming here," said
Police Commandant David Bolanos Camara.
