## Powwow brings Indian culture to Farm 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
"I wish I had brought my camera,"
said one Stanford student as he
watched native Americans from
every part of the country dance, sing
and display colorful traditional crafts
yesterday at the 14th annual powwow
held here.
"This is really awesome," he con
tinued, as Comanches, Sioux,
Omahas, Navajos and others from
more than 100 North American
tribes concluded a dance competition
under a large tent on the fields be
tween Sunken Diamond and El
Camino Real. "I'd heard about the
powwow, but I didn't really know
what it was. It's great to see that the

Indian culture is still alive," he said.
The student, David Blumberg, a
business administration master's stu
dent, was one of more than 5,000
people who attended the Stanford
American Indian Organization Pow-
Wow — making it the largest ever
held at Stanford. The event began in
1972 to protest Stanford's mascot,
which was then the Indian, and to
"show the University ethnic unity,"
according to Debbie Phillips, a Chip
pewa from Montana and co
coordinator of the powwow.
Native Americans who participated
in this weekend's powwow said that
the purpose of the gathering was to
show pride and to introduce their

children to native American tradi
tions.
The purpose of the powwow was
"to express pride in our culture and
to keep the culture strong so
youngsters can see the respect their
elders have for it," said Kelly
Looking Horse, a member of the
Sioux tribe in South Dakota who now
attends school in Santa Cruz.
Motioning to the crafts fair and the
dancing taking place, he added,
"Realistically, this is all we have left
as a culture. All our lives we've seen
nothing but poverty and oppression,
but to see youngsters be proud of
[accomplishments] like winning a
dance contest is very good for the
elders — to be proud of our culture
instead of ashamed," he said. "It's
good to see people ... go to all this
expense to be here."
Looking Horse said his own experi
ence is representative of the struggle
that native Americans now face to
preserve their traditions. "My
grandfather used to sing and dance
when I was a youngster," he said.
"But others would make fun of me
when I danced, and I would become
ashamed. My grandfather would say,
"Forget about that — you're a dan
cer." " Looking Horse added that
now he will "probably dance until I
die."
Dennis Bowen, an Allegany Indian
from New York who now lives with
his Navajo wife in Arizona, served as
master of ceremonies for the pow
wow. He said the gatherings are good
for the children. They are "losing
tradition — they go for the modern
life." Seeing the powwow, "[children]
think about it and it helps them feel
proud of who they are." This feeling
"comes from the family, it comes
from the heart."
Richard Poafpybitty, a half-
Omaha, half-Comanche Indian from
Oklahoma, said that powwows are a
way to bring North America's diverse
native American population together.
They are a "way to carry on our cul
ture with different tribes. When we
come to powwows, we're all one," he
said.
He added that, in addition to the
fun times at the gatherings, there are
also very serious moments of prayer.
"Powwows are fun times, yet
serious times," he said, moments
before he announced the winner of
the owl dance competition. "There is
prayer and then there are good times
— that's what it's all about."
The Stanford powwow is one of
many held throughout the year at
various locations in North America.
Bowen said the first gathering of
native Americans from tribes

throughout the country occurred
about 50 years ago. "Before that,
tribes kept mostly to themselves," he
said.
Powwows now regularly attract
representatives of between 80 and
300 different tribes, he said.
Phillips said that there are "two or
three powwows per weekend." On
any weekend, "You might have to
travel a couple of hundred miles, but
if you look hard enough, you'll find a
powwow," she added.
At this weekend's event, native
Americans established a performance
tent in the center of the field, while
around the perimeter of the field,
cooks and craftsmen set up more than
100 boothes to sell food, jewelery
and art work. The participants, who
flocked to the powwow from as far
away as New York, Alaska and Wis
consin, also established a tent city in
the field between Stanford Stadium
and El Camino for their two-night
stay. Many also slept in their campers
and vans.
The powwow began late Friday af
ternoon with a traditional parade of
the participants, and ended yesterday
afternoon with the presentation of
awards to the winners of dance com
petitions that had been going on all
weekend.

serious times," he said, moments
before he announced the winner of
the owl dance competition. "There is
prayer and then there are good times
— that's what it's all about."
The Stanford powwow is one of
many held throughout the year at
various locations in North America.
Bowen said the first gathering of
native Americans from tribes

throughout the country occurred
about 50 years ago. "Before that,
tribes kept mostly to themselves," he
said.
Powwows now regularly attract
representatives of between 80 and
300 different tribes, he said.
Phillips said that there are "two or
three powwows per weekend." On
any weekend, "You might have to
travel a couple of hundred miles, but
if you look hard enough, you'll find a
powwow," she added.
At this weekend's event, native
Americans established a performance
tent in the center of the field, while
around the perimeter of the field,
cooks and craftsmen set up more than
100 boothes to sell food, jewelery
and art work. The participants, who
flocked to the powwow from as far
away as New York, Alaska and Wis
consin, also established a tent city in
the field between Stanford Stadium
and El Camino for their two-night
stay. Many also slept in their campers
and vans.
The powwow began late Friday af
ternoon with a traditional parade of
the participants, and ended yesterday
afternoon with the presentation of
awards to the winners of dance com
petitions that had been going on all
weekend.

Some of the powwow activities include classical Indian dancing contests,
as well as a crafts fair at which jewelery, art and food are sold.

Part of the purpose of the powwow is to promote Indian culture among the children. "To see youngsters be
proud of their [accomplishments] ... is good for the elders — to be proud of our culture
instead of ashamed," said Kelly Looking Horse.

More than 5,000 people attended the powwow, the largest held over the
14 years it has been at Stanford. The Stanford American Indian Or
ganization sponsors the event each year.
"I wish I had brought my camera,"
said one Stanford student as he
watched native Americans from
every part of the country dance, sing
and display colorful traditional crafts
yesterday at the 14th annual powwow
held here.
"This is really awesome," he con
tinued, as Comanches, Sioux,
Omahas, Navajos and others from
more than 100 North American
tribes concluded a dance competition
under a large tent on the fields be
tween Sunken Diamond and El
Camino Real. "I'd heard about the
powwow, but I didn't really know
what it was. It's great to see that the

Indian culture is still alive," he said.
The student, David Blumberg, a
business administration master's stu
dent, was one of more than 5,000
people who attended the Stanford
American Indian Organization Pow-
Wow — making it the largest ever
held at Stanford. The event began in
1972 to protest Stanford's mascot,
which was then the Indian, and to
"show the University ethnic unity,"
according to Debbie Phillips, a Chip
pewa from Montana and co
coordinator of the powwow.
Native Americans who participated
in this weekend's powwow said that
the purpose of the gathering was to
show pride and to introduce their

children to native American tradi
tions.
The purpose of the powwow was
"to express pride in our culture and
to keep the culture strong so
youngsters can see the respect their
elders have for it," said Kelly
Looking Horse, a member of the
Sioux tribe in South Dakota who now
attends school in Santa Cruz.
Motioning to the crafts fair and the
dancing taking place, he added,
"Realistically, this is all we have left
as a culture. All our lives we've seen
nothing but poverty and oppression,
but to see youngsters be proud of
[accomplishments] like winning a
dance contest is very good for the
elders — to be proud of our culture
instead of ashamed," he said. "It's
good to see people ... go to all this
expense to be here."
Looking Horse said his own experi
ence is representative of the struggle
that native Americans now face to
preserve their traditions. "My
grandfather used to sing and dance
when I was a youngster," he said.
"But others would make fun of me
when I danced, and I would become
ashamed. My grandfather would say,
"Forget about that — you're a dan
cer." " Looking Horse added that
now he will "probably dance until I
die."
Dennis Bowen, an Allegany Indian
from New York who now lives with
his Navajo wife in Arizona, served as
master of ceremonies for the pow
wow. He said the gatherings are good
for the children. They are "losing
tradition — they go for the modern
life." Seeing the powwow, "[children]
think about it and it helps them feel
proud of who they are." This feeling
"comes from the family, it comes
from the heart."
Richard Poafpybitty, a half-
Omaha, half-Comanche Indian from
Oklahoma, said that powwows are a
way to bring North America's diverse
native American population together.
They are a "way to carry on our cul
ture with different tribes. When we
come to powwows, we're all one," he
said.
He added that, in addition to the
fun times at the gatherings, there are
also very serious moments of prayer.
"Powwows are fun times, yet
serious times," he said, moments
before he announced the winner of
the owl dance competition. "There is
prayer and then there are good times
— that's what it's all about."
