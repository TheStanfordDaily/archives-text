## THE 						STANFORD DAILY In support of Zschau 
### 
Last week, the Republican Central Committee
of Santa Clara County voted to call on the House
Republican leadership to consider removing Rep.
Ed Zschau (R-Los Altos) from the House
Foreign Affairs Committee. Apparently, the
county's party policy makers feel that Zschau's
deviation from the GOP line by opposing military
aid for the Contras in Nicaragua is inexcusable.
Zschau was one of 14 Republicans who voted
against a GOP-sponsored compromise bill that
would have given $ 14 million in direct aid to the
rebels fighting the Sandinista government. Stan
foid's representative was also one of only 15
Republicans who voted for a compromise bill
sponsored primarily by Democrats that aimed to
give $14 million to the Central American region
but to withhold money from the Contras.
The Daily has previously praised Zschau for
the courage and determination he showed in
defying the House GOP leadership by voting
against aid for the Contras. The Reagan adminis
tration's policy of helping the counter

evolutionaries who are trying to overthrow
Nicaragua's legitimate government is merely ex
acerbating that country's problems. The United
States needs to come to terms with the
Nicaraguan revolution and seek diplomatic, not
military, solutions to the crisis in Central
America.
The local Republican committee's decision to
try to undermine Zschau's position in the House
only serves to emphasize the courage and states
manship of Zschau's vote against the Contras.
The congressman deserves praise for represent
ing the true interests of his constituents and of the
Nicaraguan people rather than merely kowtow
ing to partisan politics.
We urge our readers to write to Zschau and let
him know that, contrary to the GOP committee's
actions, many of his constituents appreciate his
actions. More representatives should listen to
their consciences rather than blindly following
party lines.
