# Is market-socialism free of the usual tyranny?
## 
### 
A new socialist approach is gaining impor
tant support in the American left. The new
approach might he called market-socialism or
even market-syndicalism. Syndicalism is the
name for an economic system of worker
managed enterprises.
Symptomatic of this new trend is an article
in the Jan. 23 issue of the Democratic
Socialist newsweekly. In These Times, by
socialist journalist John Judis on the current
state of the American socialist movement.
Judis says that the current unpopularity of
socialism in America does not stem from
public relations problems or from the resur
gence of conservatism. Instead, Judis says,
this opportunity stems from a correct ap
praisal by the American populace of socialism
(as it is usually understood). The populace
sees socialism as both impossibly Utopian in
aspiration and unbearably despotic in
practice.
Judis, speaking as a convinced socialist,
writes eloquently of the manifest dangers to
political liberty of massive government eco
nomic endeavors and widespread government
employment under socialism. On this topic,
he is echoed by market-socialist economist
Alec Nove, who says of the Soviet economy,
"A strict state monopoly of printing presses
and editorial offices facilities (along with the
censorship) a dreary homogenization of news
and comment.
"It is easy to blacklist 'undesirables,' to
deprive them of employment if the state is the
only employer, and the damage is the greater
when unofficial ways of earning a living are
illegal.

"The great poet Mandel'shtam and his
wife, out of favor and penniless, dreamt of
owning a cow, for that would give a degree of
personal independence even when poems dis
please the powers that be: At least one could
drink and sell milk."
Likewise, Judis points to the unattractive
ness to the American populace of socialist
calls for transformations of everyone's per
sonality into the new socialist man or woman.

The citizens, understandably, don't like the
idea of having a "cultural revolution"
crammed down their throats.
In search of a socialism that is both appeal
ing and feasible, Judis, Nove and much of the
leadership in the important leftist group
Democratic Socialists of America have turned
increasingly toward a market-socialist altern
ative.
They reject Soviet-style marketless
centralized planning as both inefficient and
authoritarian: "A centralized economy leads
to a centralized political authority," in Judis'
words. They trace the Soviet model to Marx's
wrongheaded Utopian conceptions of a future
society.

What kind of a socialist future these
market-socialists are striving for is still under
debate. But it is basically Yugoslavia, Hun
gary and, now, China — without the secret
police.
Much of the economy would be organized
as producers' cooperatives, with management
elected by the workers. The cooperatives
would relate to each other and to consumers
on the market.
I see two basic problems that these market
socialists need to stay alert to: ensuring true
autonomy for worker-controlled enterprises;
and devising principles of justice and
legitimacy to sustain their institutions.
True autonomy is not simply a matter of
pious promises. The Soviet collective farms
are in theory independent producers'
cooperatives, owned and managed by their
workers. In reality, these farms are planta
tions whose serfs toil for the country's ruling
political bureaucrats (the nomenklatura).
True autonomy will require a capital mar
ket. Autonomy would be nullified by a state
investment bank. In Yugoslavia, investment
policy has proved to be a cockpit of political
in-fighting. In part to solve some of these
problems, Yugoslavia considered during the
1966-71 period adopting a capital market,
but did not do so for political reasons.
John Stuart Mill's 19th-century proposal
for market socialism implied that workers
could market their shares in their enterprises,
the need for a vigorous capital market, and a
major role for socialist entrepreneurs.
Modern-day market-socialist Alan Ryan ack
nowledges the importance of ensuring

entrepreneurial initiative under socialism.
True autonomy will require rejection of
egalitarian measures and of central planning.
Mill, in his proposal of market-socialism,
showed that these were seriors threats to per
sonal liberty as well as counterproductive.
The whole thrust of market-socialism has,
correctly, been one of skepticism toward
planning. Even the indicative planning now
lauded by Michael Harrington has in practice
been an excuse for propping up and subsidiz
ing "lemon" enterprises.
True autonomy will require saying "No" to
nationalization of industry. Some supposed
market-socialists still favor nationalization —
rather than producers' cooperatives — in
transport, energy, finance, telecommunica
tions or other industries.
Nationalization means an authoritarian
planning appartus. Nationalization means
rule by a political bureaucracy (an American
nomenklatura). Nationalization of such indus
tries, which are intertwined with the entire
economy, would destroy the autonomy of
worker-controlled enterprises in other indus
tries.
Finally, market-socialism needs some un
derlying principles of justice and legitimacy.
Equality will not do. Producers' cooperatives
are not going to be equal, and trying to make
them so will legitimize envy, destroy produc
tivity, replace enterprise autonomy with poli
tical bureaucracy and install authoritarian
power instead of political liberty.
Probably some sort of principle of entitle
ment to the fruits of one's labor will do. But
that will not help much in saying why one par

ticulur group of workers rather than another
should be entitled to a particular piece of land
or to a piece of capital equipment created in
the past.
Market-socialism lacks a principle of just
original acquisition (such as John Locke's
homesteading principle provides for
capitalism). It has<no principle of original en
titlement. Only if market-socialism can dis
cover such a principle can it have a
full-fledged system of justice based on the his
tory of past transactions.
Under such an "historical" system of
justice, the justice of the holdings people have
at any one time is determined by the justice of
transactions that led to the current situation.
In contrast, under a "pattern"' system of
justice constant redistributive efforts are re
quired to try to bring an ever-changing reality
into conformity with the desired pattern (e.g.,
equality).
As numerous social theoriests — including
Jeremy Bentham, F.A. Hayek, John Rawls
and Robert Nozick — have pointed out, such
"pattern" systems have immensely high costs
in economic discouragement and political
despotism.
Although the current advocates of market
socialism still have problems to resolve in
their effort to reconcile socialism, liberty and
workability, their tentative program deserves
to be welcomed as a vast improvement over
the deadly dogmas of Marxism.

tivity, replace enterprise autonomy with poli
tical bureaucracy and install authoritarian
power instead of political liberty.
Probably some sort of principle of entitle
ment to the fruits of one's labor will do. But
that will not help much in saying why one par

ticulur group of workers rather than another
should be entitled to a particular piece of land
or to a piece of capital equipment created in
the past.
Market-socialism lacks a principle of just
original acquisition (such as John Locke's
homesteading principle provides for
capitalism). It has<no principle of original en
titlement. Only if market-socialism can dis
cover such a principle can it have a
full-fledged system of justice based on the his
tory of past transactions.
Under such an "historical" system of
justice, the justice of the holdings people have
at any one time is determined by the justice of
transactions that led to the current situation.
In contrast, under a "pattern"' system of
justice constant redistributive efforts are re
quired to try to bring an ever-changing reality
into conformity with the desired pattern (e.g.,
equality).
As numerous social theoriests — including
Jeremy Bentham, F.A. Hayek, John Rawls
and Robert Nozick — have pointed out, such
"pattern" systems have immensely high costs
in economic discouragement and political
despotism.
Although the current advocates of market
socialism still have problems to resolve in
their effort to reconcile socialism, liberty and
workability, their tentative program deserves
to be welcomed as a vast improvement over
the deadly dogmas of Marxism.

A new socialist approach is gaining impor
tant support in the American left. The new
approach might he called market-socialism or
even market-syndicalism. Syndicalism is the
name for an economic system of worker
managed enterprises.
Symptomatic of this new trend is an article
in the Jan. 23 issue of the Democratic
Socialist newsweekly. In These Times, by
socialist journalist John Judis on the current
state of the American socialist movement.
Judis says that the current unpopularity of
socialism in America does not stem from
public relations problems or from the resur
gence of conservatism. Instead, Judis says,
this opportunity stems from a correct ap
praisal by the American populace of socialism
(as it is usually understood). The populace
sees socialism as both impossibly Utopian in
aspiration and unbearably despotic in
practice.
Judis, speaking as a convinced socialist,
writes eloquently of the manifest dangers to
political liberty of massive government eco
nomic endeavors and widespread government
employment under socialism. On this topic,
he is echoed by market-socialist economist
Alec Nove, who says of the Soviet economy,
"A strict state monopoly of printing presses
and editorial offices facilities (along with the
censorship) a dreary homogenization of news
and comment.
"It is easy to blacklist 'undesirables,' to
deprive them of employment if the state is the
only employer, and the damage is the greater
when unofficial ways of earning a living are
illegal.

"The great poet Mandel'shtam and his
wife, out of favor and penniless, dreamt of
owning a cow, for that would give a degree of
personal independence even when poems dis
please the powers that be: At least one could
drink and sell milk."
Likewise, Judis points to the unattractive
ness to the American populace of socialist
calls for transformations of everyone's per
sonality into the new socialist man or woman.

The citizens, understandably, don't like the
idea of having a "cultural revolution"
crammed down their throats.
In search of a socialism that is both appeal
ing and feasible, Judis, Nove and much of the
leadership in the important leftist group
Democratic Socialists of America have turned
increasingly toward a market-socialist altern
ative.
They reject Soviet-style marketless
centralized planning as both inefficient and
authoritarian: "A centralized economy leads
to a centralized political authority," in Judis'
words. They trace the Soviet model to Marx's
wrongheaded Utopian conceptions of a future
society.

What kind of a socialist future these
market-socialists are striving for is still under
debate. But it is basically Yugoslavia, Hun
gary and, now, China — without the secret
police.
Much of the economy would be organized
as producers' cooperatives, with management
elected by the workers. The cooperatives
would relate to each other and to consumers
on the market.
I see two basic problems that these market
socialists need to stay alert to: ensuring true
autonomy for worker-controlled enterprises;
and devising principles of justice and
legitimacy to sustain their institutions.
True autonomy is not simply a matter of
pious promises. The Soviet collective farms
are in theory independent producers'
cooperatives, owned and managed by their
workers. In reality, these farms are planta
tions whose serfs toil for the country's ruling
political bureaucrats (the nomenklatura).
True autonomy will require a capital mar
ket. Autonomy would be nullified by a state
investment bank. In Yugoslavia, investment
policy has proved to be a cockpit of political
in-fighting. In part to solve some of these
problems, Yugoslavia considered during the
1966-71 period adopting a capital market,
but did not do so for political reasons.
John Stuart Mill's 19th-century proposal
for market socialism implied that workers
could market their shares in their enterprises,
the need for a vigorous capital market, and a
major role for socialist entrepreneurs.
Modern-day market-socialist Alan Ryan ack
nowledges the importance of ensuring

entrepreneurial initiative under socialism.
True autonomy will require rejection of
egalitarian measures and of central planning.
Mill, in his proposal of market-socialism,
showed that these were seriors threats to per
sonal liberty as well as counterproductive.
The whole thrust of market-socialism has,
correctly, been one of skepticism toward
planning. Even the indicative planning now
lauded by Michael Harrington has in practice
been an excuse for propping up and subsidiz
ing "lemon" enterprises.
True autonomy will require saying "No" to
nationalization of industry. Some supposed
market-socialists still favor nationalization —
rather than producers' cooperatives — in
transport, energy, finance, telecommunica
tions or other industries.
Nationalization means an authoritarian
planning appartus. Nationalization means
rule by a political bureaucracy (an American
nomenklatura). Nationalization of such indus
tries, which are intertwined with the entire
economy, would destroy the autonomy of
worker-controlled enterprises in other indus
tries.
Finally, market-socialism needs some un
derlying principles of justice and legitimacy.
Equality will not do. Producers' cooperatives
are not going to be equal, and trying to make
them so will legitimize envy, destroy produc
tivity, replace enterprise autonomy with poli
tical bureaucracy and install authoritarian
power instead of political liberty.
