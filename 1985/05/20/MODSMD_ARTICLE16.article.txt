Do not donate
At some time everyone of you will
have to decide whether or not to serve
in some leadership role. I hope you
will accept, even if it looks a little
scary.
- Donald Kennedy,
Commencement 1984
On Tuesday, May 14, Stanford
University had the opportunity to
serve in a leadership role by oppos
ing an abhorrent political system —
apartheid. Instead, Stanford's trus
tees have elected to passively accept
the status quo. This decision conflicts
with the goals and values purported
by this institution. Enlightened insti

tutions such as Stanford University
have the responsibility to provide
moral leadership in our society.
Clearly, profiting from the blood and
indignity of apartheid, in the guise of
serving the oppressed black South
Africans, is inconsistent with Stan
ford's expected role and is therefore
unacceptable.
Hence, a group of concerned
seniors, ashamed of Stanford's ethi
cal inertia, invite the student body
and alumni to withhold all donations
to the University until Stanford
formulates and practices a morally
acceptable investment policy. If such
a policy is implemented, Stanford
will once again earn our contribu
tions by adhering to those values that

it claims to embody.
We invite all Stanford students
and alumni to come to White Plaza
between 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m.
weekdays to sign a petition to pledge
that you will not contribute money to
Stanford University until you are
convinced that Stanford is a worthy
recipient. In addition, we hope that
the student body encourages
prospective donors to examine Stan
ford's role in apartheid before con
tributing. Though Stanford
University has failed in its respon
sibilties, its students and alumni must
not.
It is important to keep asking your
self whether you are living up to the

responsibility your opportunities have
created for you.

The Daily missed my point in its
article "Shedding light on the debate

over units" (The Daily, May 16).
Not only did the author fail to un
derstand what I was suggesting to
him, but he resorted to a falsified
statement, .. in engineering,
you're learning a vocation as
opposed to getting an education,
which is the point of college," to
cover his insufficiency. For the
record, I did not make this state
ment, nor do 1 consider it to be true.
The point that I attempted to
make was that the unit is an arbitrary
concept loosely related to learning.
The actual knowledge acquired
should be the critical consideration
here. Instead of comparing units, we
should be comparing what the

School of Engineering and the
School of Humanities and Sciences
consider to be an undergraduate
level of education. Both schools offer
an education; this is the point of
college. Yet the School of Engineer
ing might have its goals set too high.
It might be trying to teach more than
an education; it might be attempting
to teach an entire vocation. I would
question the Engineering School's
undergraduate expectations before
questioning theii*nit allocations.
Clearly, I would not question their
status as an educational institution.
