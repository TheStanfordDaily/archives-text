## The
						social dynamics of bathroom sex 
### 
Upon learning about the warning put out by
GLAS regarding possible arrests for sexual behav
ior in public bathrooms, some of my non-gay
friends were, if not disgusted or appalled, at least
puzzled by the concept of instant, impersonal sex.
A number of them suggested that this is an issue
pertaining to criminal law — hence that it is appro
priate for the police to arrest people for engaging in
th'is kind of "perverse" conduct.

VIEWPOINT

Before I express my view on the matter, I would
like to volunteer what I judge to be a hit of relevant
information. The tea-room scene is, time and
again, a masterpiece of subtlety. Verbal solicita
tions are rare — rather, communication between
participants involves body language meaningful
only to them. Those who use the facilities for bio
logical reasons are never, gratuitously or forcefully,
made part of any kind of sex-oriented activity. The
sexual activity that takes place is always consented
upon and virtually invisible.
Here at Stanford, police attention to the issue
was brought up as a result of a number of com
plaints. I ignore their exact content, but I have a
feeling they reflect nothing but assumptions — for
example, that when all the stalls are occupied
someone is having sex. Of course, one only needs
to read the writings on the walls to realize that
bathrooms are places where sexual exchanges oc
cur. but it does make a difference whether or not
the activity is obvious or inferred, especially when
the police are called to "enforce the law."
According to the California Penal Code, Section
647. anyone "... a) who solicits anyone to engage
in or who in any public place or in any place open
to the public or exposed to public view engages in
lewd or dissolute conduct ..." is guilty of disor
derly conduct. In my opinion, lewd or dissolute
conduct constitutes an offense to public decency.
I he sexual activity that goes on in public toilets

rarely is obtrusive or in any way blatant as to
become a source of public outrage; thus, I do not
think that it falls within the realm of criminal con
sideration.
Others opine differently, however. Kirk
Cameron, in his letter of May 3, suggests that the
behavior in question "is criminal and simply
wrong." I think that before one makes a moral
judgment, one must be careful to remove one's
biases; it may not be "simply wrong" to engage in
behavior which affects no one except those in
volved. To be fair, I think it is important to con
sider some underlying questions: What constitutes
common decency? What is wrong sexual behavior?
What is the source of our moral guidelines? And,
finally, should the law concern itself with the en
forcement of morals?
Those who are (or wish to be) blind to the exis
tence of sexual deviance would argue that there is
only one true sexual morality. But in fact there is
no such thing as a moral majority in sexual matters,
nor can a consensus as to what behaviors are to be
encompassed by common decency (if there is such
a thing) be reached. Instead, morally appropriate
behavior is defined by personal moral guidelines.
Only in our society people's moral guidelines are,
for the most part, intrinsically linked to the Judeo-
Christian philosophy, which catalogues as sinful
most sexual actions.
The important thing to remember, however, is
that in our country the church is separate from the
state. Thus, a sphere of private morality free of le
gal influence must be allowed for. I think that, since
sexual activity in public bathrooms rarely, if ever,
includes an act of indecency, corruption or ex
ploitation. it falls within the limits of private
morality. Hence I can only conclude that the law
has no right to involve itself in this matter.
It seems to me that instead of concerning our
selves with passing moral judgment on people who
engage in the type of behavior alluded to (or, for
that matter, in any kind of harmless deviant behav

ior), we should consider the prevailing attitudes —
including heterosexist attitudes — that promote it
or condone it. In my experience, the majority of
those who frequent the tea-rooms fall within the
categories of (mostly gay) "closeted," married, un
attractive and elderly men (though, of course, there
are those who do it for fun). It is important to rec
ognize that people inclined toward homosexuality
in any way and to any degree make up one of the
most highly ostracized minorities in our society. We
are not allowed to express our affection openly. We
are not allowed to join in marriage and raise
children. We are denied our civil rights. And we are
encouraged to hide our feelings and ourselves.
Indeed, that our heterosexist society is highly
selective when it comes to expressing its views and
enforcing its morals and its laws is easy to see. For
example, rarely is a man arrested for making even
outright violent and dirty suggestions to a woman
in the street; yet a man who makes an audacious
suggestion to another man is liable to be penalized.
But gay people are doubly affected, for they also
confront the emphasis which our society places on
values focusing on superficiality, beauty and youth,
and enfolding highly immature views toward
sexuality in general (and to this extent I would
venture to say that part of the reason why people
complain about bathroom sex is that they do not
know what to do when sex of any kind is put right
in front of their faces). For ours is a society that is
highly hypocritical when it comes to sexual matters:
We are ready to speak about sex and do it loudly,
yet our prudishness and repression is comparable
to that of the Victorian period.
In my opinion, before aiming to eliminate
through moral judgment behaviors which we unar
bitrarily choose to be ashamed of. we need to extin
guish underlying attitudes which we should be
ashamed of. Cameron is right to state that
"sexuality of any type is a powerful event." It is
about time that we learn to deal with it.
