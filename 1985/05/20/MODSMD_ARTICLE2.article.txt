# Early exit for Cardinal tennis at NCAAs
## Georgia ousts Stanford men 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
ATHENS, Ga. — The Stanford men's tennis team
heard about the women's team's NCAA tournament loss
to Trinity the night before it played its first-round match
against Brigham Young.
Team members' sympathy was high for their Cardinal
counterparts. The shock of a top-seeded team losing in
the second round doesn't die quickly.
Two days later, the shock became personal experience,
as the Stanford men were upset by tournament host Geor
gia in the second round of the NCAAs yesterday.
Actually, the third-seeded men aren't shocked by their
5-3 upset loss to sixth-seeded Georgia. They're mad.
Coach Dick Gould was at a level of controlled anger after
the Bulldogs clinched a semifinal berth with a win at No. 1
doubles.
"I've never had a team lose in the quarters," Gould
said. "When the going got tough, the Cardinal simply
folded."
And where did the Cardinal fold? In the matches that it
usually depends on — No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 singles.
In front of a partisan crowd of 4,383 — the second
highest attendance at Athens in NCAA history — Dan
Goldie lost to No. 2-ranked Mikael Pernfors, Jim Grabb
lost to No. 9-ranked George Bezecny and Derek Ros
tagno lost to No. 32-ranked Allen Miller. Stanford began
the doubles competition down 4-2.
All three singles matches were two-set upsets, two
hours of C'urdinul unforced errors, heud-scratching and
bewildered looks at missed shots.
"Look at the scores at the top three singles, and I'll tell
you how tough we were. Look at the way I couldn't turn

things around and I'll tell you what kind of coach
ing job I did. Team attitude is my responsibility and
a team that can win nationals finds a winning atti
tude," Gould said.
Gould was quick to associate the word "attitude"
with Goldie's 6-1,6-1 loss to Pernfors.
Goldie's loss was the worst defeat he has
received in a long while. The match was quick — 48
minutes. It started with numerous superb passing
shots and returns of serve by Pernfors, and ended
with even more numerous double faults by Goldie.
Goldie, ranked No. 1 in the nation for most of
the season, analyzed his own playing at 1 -1, second
set. When one of his serves hit the tape and failed
to go over, he vented his frustration by shouting
two words: "The worst!"
Goldie played so badly in his last few games that
it looked like he was giving the match away and
denying Pernfors the satisfaction of winning by his
own good, hard playing.
"I'm more than surprised with how badly he
played," Pernfors said. "When you get that good,
you should be able to play well consistently. You .
don't get to be No. 1 and lose one and one."
Match point summed the match up well. Goldie
lofted a soft mid-court lob, and Pernfors smashed it
straight down center court for the victory.
Rostagno's No. 3 singles loss to Miller, 6-4, 6-4,
was reminiscent of Stanford's play in its 8-1 loss to
UCLA exactly one month ago. After that loss in
Los Angeles, Rostagno said the balls were consis
tently out by inches and hitting the tape.
Such was the case was against Georgia. Would
be winners missed by inches, and volleys died at the
net.

Rostagno was able to turn things around in the
No. 2 doubles match with his partner, Patrick
McEnroe. Gould said McEnroe — the only unde
feated Stanford player in the two matches —
played "exceptional doubles" against Georgia's
Deane Frey and Philip Johnson.
That 6-3, 6-1 win left the deciding matches at the
No. 1 and No. 3 doubles spots. Georgia took the
first sets in each of those matches, 6-3, and then
Pernfors and Miller came back from being down 3-
4 in the second set against Grabb and John Letts to
win the match.
"Pernfors and Miller came through for us as they
have all year," Georgia Coach Dan Magill said. In
30 years as the Bulldogs coach, Magill's teams
have compiled a 608-161 record in dual matches.
With that record, he is the all-time winningest col
legiate tennis coach.
"If anything turned the match around for us, it
was Mikael's win," No. 2 singles player Dezecny
said. "I felt pretty good after I saw he won 6-1,6-1.
That tied up the match two-all, and really got us
going," he said.
Stanford seemed to have it going too, after it out
did every other team in the first round by defeating
25th-ranked BYU 6-0 Saturday.
McEnroe's win at No. 4 singles clinched the vic
tory for Stanford, and BYU Coach Larry Hall
opted not to finish the match with any doubles
games.
Several BYU players admitted that drawing
Stanford as a first-round opponent was a bit of
"bad luck."
"In the first round, chances are you'll play either
UCLA, USC or Stanford, since they represent
three of the eight seeded teams. You'd like to play

LSU or Texas, though. It was bad luck," David
Harkness said.
Harkness could only take two games away from
Stanford's Grabb.
"He (Grabb) has really improved. Last year he
was tough, but his returns and passing shots weren't
great, so you could at least count on holding your
serve. Not so today," Harkness said.
BYU's Rob Fought, ranked 28th nationally, also
said his opponent — Goldie — has improved since
the two players last met.
"He is an entirely new player. When I last played
him, he made a lot of mistakes. He didn't make any
today. He has also learned to be a good net
player," Fought said.
Goldie won the match, 6-1, 6-2, by keeping his
ground strokes amazingly deep.
"He played so well I had no chance. He kept the
ball so deep it was impossible," Fought said after
the match.
"I played all right considering who 1 played,"
Goldie said. "He's not one of the better players,
and it's hard sometimes to play well in those kind of
matches."
In other tournament play, only 7th-ranked LSU
was upset in the first round, by No. 9-ranked Clem
son. Clemson went on to give defending champion
UCLA a scare in the quarterfinals, taking three of
six matches and sending two doubles matches to
three sets before finally losing 5-4.
Georgia will play the No. 2 seed, USC, today at 2
p.m. EST in the semifinals. The Trojans advanced
to the semis by defeating Arkansas, 5-3, and Texas,
6-2. The second semifinal match will pit UCLA
against the No. 4 seed. SMU. SMU eliminated
fifth-seeded Pepperdine, 5-2, in the quarterfinals.

Gould was quick to associate the word "attitude"
with Goldie's 6-1,6-1 loss to Pernfors.
Goldie's loss was the worst defeat he has
received in a long while. The match was quick — 48
minutes. It started with numerous superb passing
shots and returns of serve by Pernfors, and ended
with even more numerous double faults by Goldie.
Goldie, ranked No. 1 in the nation for most of
the season, analyzed his own playing at 1 -1, second
set. When one of his serves hit the tape and failed
to go over, he vented his frustration by shouting
two words: "The worst!"
Goldie played so badly in his last few games that
it looked like he was giving the match away and
denying Pernfors the satisfaction of winning by his
own good, hard playing.
"I'm more than surprised with how badly he
played," Pernfors said. "When you get that good,
you should be able to play well consistently. You .
don't get to be No. 1 and lose one and one."
Match point summed the match up well. Goldie
lofted a soft mid-court lob, and Pernfors smashed it
straight down center court for the victory.
Rostagno's No. 3 singles loss to Miller, 6-4, 6-4,
was reminiscent of Stanford's play in its 8-1 loss to
UCLA exactly one month ago. After that loss in
Los Angeles, Rostagno said the balls were consis
tently out by inches and hitting the tape.
Such was the case was against Georgia. Would
be winners missed by inches, and volleys died at the
net.

Rostagno was able to turn things around in the
No. 2 doubles match with his partner, Patrick
McEnroe. Gould said McEnroe — the only unde
feated Stanford player in the two matches —
played "exceptional doubles" against Georgia's
Deane Frey and Philip Johnson.
That 6-3, 6-1 win left the deciding matches at the
No. 1 and No. 3 doubles spots. Georgia took the
first sets in each of those matches, 6-3, and then
Pernfors and Miller came back from being down 3-
4 in the second set against Grabb and John Letts to
win the match.
"Pernfors and Miller came through for us as they
have all year," Georgia Coach Dan Magill said. In
30 years as the Bulldogs coach, Magill's teams
have compiled a 608-161 record in dual matches.
With that record, he is the all-time winningest col
legiate tennis coach.
"If anything turned the match around for us, it
was Mikael's win," No. 2 singles player Dezecny
said. "I felt pretty good after I saw he won 6-1,6-1.
That tied up the match two-all, and really got us
going," he said.
Stanford seemed to have it going too, after it out
did every other team in the first round by defeating
25th-ranked BYU 6-0 Saturday.
McEnroe's win at No. 4 singles clinched the vic
tory for Stanford, and BYU Coach Larry Hall
opted not to finish the match with any doubles
games.
Several BYU players admitted that drawing
Stanford as a first-round opponent was a bit of
"bad luck."
"In the first round, chances are you'll play either
UCLA, USC or Stanford, since they represent
three of the eight seeded teams. You'd like to play

LSU or Texas, though. It was bad luck," David
Harkness said.
Harkness could only take two games away from
Stanford's Grabb.
"He (Grabb) has really improved. Last year he
was tough, but his returns and passing shots weren't
great, so you could at least count on holding your
serve. Not so today," Harkness said.
BYU's Rob Fought, ranked 28th nationally, also
said his opponent — Goldie — has improved since
the two players last met.
"He is an entirely new player. When I last played
him, he made a lot of mistakes. He didn't make any
today. He has also learned to be a good net
player," Fought said.
Goldie won the match, 6-1, 6-2, by keeping his
ground strokes amazingly deep.
"He played so well I had no chance. He kept the
ball so deep it was impossible," Fought said after
the match.
"I played all right considering who 1 played,"
Goldie said. "He's not one of the better players,
and it's hard sometimes to play well in those kind of
matches."
In other tournament play, only 7th-ranked LSU
was upset in the first round, by No. 9-ranked Clem
son. Clemson went on to give defending champion
UCLA a scare in the quarterfinals, taking three of
six matches and sending two doubles matches to
three sets before finally losing 5-4.
Georgia will play the No. 2 seed, USC, today at 2
p.m. EST in the semifinals. The Trojans advanced
to the semis by defeating Arkansas, 5-3, and Texas,
6-2. The second semifinal match will pit UCLA
against the No. 4 seed. SMU. SMU eliminated
fifth-seeded Pepperdine, 5-2, in the quarterfinals.

"The worst!" said Stanford's Dan Goldie in the midst of his 48-minute,
6-1, 6-1 thumping at the hands of Georgia's Mikael Pernfors.
ATHENS, Ga. — The Stanford men's tennis team
heard about the women's team's NCAA tournament loss
to Trinity the night before it played its first-round match
against Brigham Young.
Team members' sympathy was high for their Cardinal
counterparts. The shock of a top-seeded team losing in
the second round doesn't die quickly.
Two days later, the shock became personal experience,
as the Stanford men were upset by tournament host Geor
gia in the second round of the NCAAs yesterday.
Actually, the third-seeded men aren't shocked by their
5-3 upset loss to sixth-seeded Georgia. They're mad.
Coach Dick Gould was at a level of controlled anger after
the Bulldogs clinched a semifinal berth with a win at No. 1
doubles.
"I've never had a team lose in the quarters," Gould
said. "When the going got tough, the Cardinal simply
folded."
And where did the Cardinal fold? In the matches that it
usually depends on — No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 singles.
In front of a partisan crowd of 4,383 — the second
highest attendance at Athens in NCAA history — Dan
Goldie lost to No. 2-ranked Mikael Pernfors, Jim Grabb
lost to No. 9-ranked George Bezecny and Derek Ros
tagno lost to No. 32-ranked Allen Miller. Stanford began
the doubles competition down 4-2.
All three singles matches were two-set upsets, two
hours of C'urdinul unforced errors, heud-scratching and
bewildered looks at missed shots.
"Look at the scores at the top three singles, and I'll tell
you how tough we were. Look at the way I couldn't turn
