# Early exit for Cardinal tennis at NCAAs
## Georgia ousts Stanford men 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
ATHENS, Ga. — The Stanford men's tennis team
heard about the women's team's NCAA tournament loss
to Trinity the night before it played its first-round match
against Brigham Young.
Team members' sympathy was high for their Cardinal
counterparts. The shock of a top-seeded team losing in
the second round doesn't die quickly.
Two days later, the shock became personal experience,
as the Stanford men were upset by tournament host Geor
gia in the second round of the NCAAs yesterday.
Actually, the third-seeded men aren't shocked by their
5-3 upset loss to sixth-seeded Georgia. They're mad.
Coach Dick Gould was at a level of controlled anger after
the Bulldogs clinched a semifinal berth with a win at No. 1
doubles.
"I've never had a team lose in the quarters," Gould
said. "When the going got tough, the Cardinal simply
folded."
And where did the Cardinal fold? In the matches that it
usually depends on — No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 singles.
In front of a partisan crowd of 4,383 — the second
highest attendance at Athens in NCAA history — Dan
Goldie lost to No. 2-ranked Mikael Pernfors, Jim Grabb
lost to No. 9-ranked George Bezecny and Derek Ros
tagno lost to No. 32-ranked Allen Miller. Stanford began
the doubles competition down 4-2.
All three singles matches were two-set upsets, two
hours of C'urdinul unforced errors, heud-scratching and
bewildered looks at missed shots.
"Look at the scores at the top three singles, and I'll tell
you how tough we were. Look at the way I couldn't turn
