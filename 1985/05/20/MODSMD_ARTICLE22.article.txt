Dynamic duo
Windham Hill recording artists Will Ackerman and Michael Hedges fill Frost Amphitheatre with the
mellow strands of a guitar duet. Ackerman and Hedges each performed solo pieces, with Shadowfax
finishing the four-hour Windham Hill concert at Frost on Saturday. According to Ackerman, the
Windham Hill concert at Frost will become an annual event.
