## USC wins crown 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
OKLAHOMA CITY — The Stan
ford women's tennis team was at the
Oklahoma City Tennis Center when
the trophies for first, second and third
place in the NCAA championships
were awarded yesterday.
But the trophies were presented on
Court 1. The Stanford team, wearing
a colorful variey of practice garb, was
on Courts 12, 13 and 14, preparing
for tomorrow's individual champion
ships, and Coach Frank Brennan and
his players could hear only the echoes
from the trophy presenter's
microphone.
It was second-seeded USC on the
center court receiving the tall first
place trophy, not the No. 1-seeded
Cardinal. The Trojans had defeated
fourth-seeded Miami — which on
Saturday beat eighth-seeded Trinity,
which upset Stanford Friday — to win
its second NCAA Women's Tennis
Championship in three years. It also
made it 26 straight years that USC
has won at least one NCAA title.
"We were lucky today," said USC

Coach Dave Borelli, whose team lost
only one singles match in its four vic
tories here. "But we'll take it. We'll
go back to the hotel and have a few
bottles of champagne and pat the kids
on the back."
Did it help that Stanford, which
defeated the Trojans twice in three
tries this season, was eliminated in
the quarterfinals?
"I think it hurt us more," Borelli
said, "because I think it put more
pressure on us to win.
Had Miami, which lost four singles
matches in three sets yesterday, upset
the Trojans, it would have been the
first time in 10 years that a team
other than USC, Stanford, UCLA or
Trinity had won the national champi
onship.
But the days of those four schools'
exclusive club at the top may be num
bered. As evidenced by Stanford's
exit in the quarterfinals and third
seeded Texas' loss to 14th-seeded
Oklahoma State in the first round,
parity is hitting women's collegiate
tennis just as it has in so many other
sports.
