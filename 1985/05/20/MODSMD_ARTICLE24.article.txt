# Card takes 2 of 3 from Bears
## 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
The California Golden Bears kept
their hopes for an NCAA tournament
bid alive yesterday by rolling to a 12-
6 victory over Stanford at Sunken
Diamond.
; The win enabled the Bears to
salvage the final game of the weekend
series. Before yesterday, the series
had belonged to Jeff Ballard. On Sat
urday, Ballard hit a three-run double
with two outs in the ninth to beat Cal
5-4. In Friday s series opener. Bal
lard picked up his 12th win of the
year, pitching the Cardinal to a 7-1
triumph.
! Cal Coach Bob Milano was proud
Qf his team, which broke a 13-game
Rising streak at Stanford. "To win
here with our backs against the wall
makes it even nicer," he said. " A lot
of credit goes to them for roaring
t>aek."
In the early going, it was Stanford
which did all the roaring. After an er
ror by shortstop Dan Truax and a
passed ball brought two runs in.
Ruben Amaro gave Stanford a 5-0
lead in the second with a three-run
homer to right.
It seemed that the game wouldn't
be close. It wasn't. Cal dominated the
rest of the way.
A two-run, bad-hop single by

Mickey bpeck and an RBI single by
Rich Harger brought Cal to within
one in the fourth. Then, in the sixth,
the Bears broke it open against
relievers Lee Plemel and Rick Dietz.
Consecutive RBI singles by
Harger. Rich Aldrete and Jeff Weiss
put Cal ahead 7-6. Kevin Maas
padded the Bears' lead with a two
run single to right. When the inning
was finally over. Cal had scored five
runs, poked six singles and built a 9-6
lead.
A three-run lead was more than
enough for Cal starter Dave Masters.
After the second. Masters allowed
only one run and two hits. Although
he walked 10 men. Masters also
struck out 10. including Mark Davis
and Rick Lundblade five times be
tween them.
"A lot of people pitch Stanford in.
but I've had success going away."
Masters said. " I made some good
pitches to them (Davis and
Lundblade). I changed speeds and
worked the outside part of the plate."
Masters was denied a complete
game when, with a six-run lead.
Milano brought in Andy Wortham to
get the final two outs in the ninth.
Milano*s decision was unpopular with
the fans, including University
President Donald Kennedy, who
Veiled a few catcalls of his own.

with a :»-tor-b day. Weiss had
more hits than the entire Cardinal
lineup. He had been 0-for-9 in the
tirst two games. "There was no differ
ence today. I just found the holes."
Weiss said, "i was seeing the hall
great."
After Cal's convincing win. the
speculation began about whether the
Bears would qualify for next
weekend's NCAA regionals. Cal
finished the Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion season with a 17-13 record, tied
with Arizona for second place. The
Bears have been ranked higher than
the Wildcats for most of the season,
but beat Arizona only once in six tries
this year.
Not surprisingly. Cal thinks it
belongs in the tournament. "I think
we have a great chance." Weiss said.
"It would be an injustice if we don't
make it."
"I think we can play with
anybody." Masters said.
Milano hopes that his team's per
formances against the second-ranked
Cardinal will sway the members of
the NCAA selection committee. "We
played them tougher than anybody."
he said "They've blown everyone
else out."
Even though Cal is undoubtedly
one of the eight best teams in the
West region, the Bears are not

assured of a spot, according to Stan
ford Coach Mark Marquess. "They'll
take the best teams even if they have
to move them." said Marquess, a
member of the selection committee.
However, both the Bears and the
Wildcats can count on some support
from Marquess. "I think Cal deserves
to go. and so does Arizona." he said.
"But guys from other parts of the
country may feel just as strongly
about other teams."
Had Cal been able to get one more
out on Saturday, the Bears might be
breathing a little easier right now.
"We win that one and we're a shoo
in.'' Milano said.
Saturday's game was the final
home contest for the Bears' seniors,
and after seven innings, it appeared
that their final effort at Evans Dia
mond would be a winning one.
Cal starter Will Schock hadn't been
pretty — allowing four hits and four
walks and hitting two batters — but
he had a 4-0 lead going into the
eighth. "I had real good luck today."
he said. "I've pitched better games,
but the guys played real well behind
me."
The guys Schock referred to were
the Cal infielders. who got him out of
trouble four times with double plays.

Third baseman Mark Machtolf tries to talk a ball into going foul in
Friday's game against California.
Both Schock and Stanford starter Jack McDowell gave
up his first hit in the fifth, but unfortunately. McDowell's
went about 450 feet further than the bunt single surren
dered by Schock.
With one out. first baseman Jerry Goff got all of a
McDowell fastball and sent it completely out of the ball
park and into the adjacent track stadium.
A three-run sixth gave the Bears their four-run lead,
but the Cardinal finally broke through in the eighth. After
Amaro walked, Davis hit what looked to be double play
No. 5, but Truax booted it, and everyone was safe.
Lundblade made Cal pay for the mistake by smashing a
two-run double down the left-field line.
Pete Stanicek got the Cardinal started in the ninth with
a one-out single to left. After Amaro walked. Stanford got
the tying run into scoring position with a daring double
steal. But Schock stayed tough, getting Davis to hit a short
fly to center for the second out.
Conventional baseball wisdom says you should never
put the winning run on base. But when the man at the
plate is Lundblade, the Six-Pac Player of the Year and
Triple Crown winner, conventional wisdom doesn't neces
sarily apply. Lundblade was walked to load the bases.
The next batter was the left-handed hitting Ballard.
Milano had the left-handed All Six-Pac reliever Wortham
ready in the bullpen, but the Cal skipper decided to stay
with Schock.
Was Ballard surprised by either decision?
"Not really," he said. "1 hadn't done anything."
On the first pitch, a high fastball, the previously 0-for-4
Ballard drilled a long drive to left-center. Harger made a
valiant effort, but not even the legs that have stolen 54
bases this year could prevent Stanicek. Amaro, and pinch
runner Fred Laningham from crossing the plate on Bal
lard's double.
"Coach Marquess just told me to wait and drive it,"
Ballard said. "They didn't have a man out there."
"I tried to keep the ball down, but it wasn't down
enough," Schock said.
Instead of with his bat, Ballard beat the Bears in more
accustomed style on Friday — with his talented pitching
arm. The senior left-hander, who is Stanford's career
leader in wins, strikeouts and innings pitched, fired a six
hitter en route to a 7-1 Cardinal win.
Ballard wasn't his normally smooth self, but the results
were the same as usual. "I was real happy because I was
struggling and was able to fight through it,"he said.

After Davis put Stanford ahead 1-0 in the first with a
double to left-center, Mike Knapp's RBI single to right
tied the game in the second. Then, with two outs in its half
of the second, the Cardinal took the lead for good.
John Ramos started the rally with a double down the
line in left. With the Cal outfield playing him to hit the
ball to right field, John Verducci fooled everyone by lining
a hanging Mark Sampson slider over the left-field fence.
"He threw the ball in the wrong spot, that's all," Ver
ducci said. "If you don't hit that pitch out, you won't hit
any pitch out."
After Stanicek singled and went to third on an error by
Weiss, Amaro drove him in with an infield single. The
three-run, two-out outburst did not surprise Verducci.

"We can score in any situation at any time," he said.
Stanicek extended the Cardinal lead to 5-1 with a
leadoff homer in the fifth. Then, in the sixth. Sampson
pitched himself out of the game by walking the first three
batters.
An All Six-Pac choice, Sampson has suffered two of his
five losses this season against Stanford. "He likes to mix
his pitches and use his breaking ball to nibble on the cor
ners," Ballard said. "He can't just blow it by people."
"He looked like he couldn't hit his spots," Verducci
added.
The entire 38-team NCAA tournament field will be an
nounced this morning. Stanford will host the Western I
Baseball Regional beginning on Friday.

done with a clutch three-run ninth-inning double.
