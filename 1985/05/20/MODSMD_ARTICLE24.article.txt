## 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
The California Golden Bears kept
their hopes for an NCAA tournament
bid alive yesterday by rolling to a 12-
6 victory over Stanford at Sunken
Diamond.
; The win enabled the Bears to
salvage the final game of the weekend
series. Before yesterday, the series
had belonged to Jeff Ballard. On Sat
urday, Ballard hit a three-run double
with two outs in the ninth to beat Cal
5-4. In Friday s series opener. Bal
lard picked up his 12th win of the
year, pitching the Cardinal to a 7-1
triumph.
! Cal Coach Bob Milano was proud
Qf his team, which broke a 13-game
Rising streak at Stanford. "To win
here with our backs against the wall
makes it even nicer," he said. " A lot
of credit goes to them for roaring
t>aek."
In the early going, it was Stanford
which did all the roaring. After an er
ror by shortstop Dan Truax and a
passed ball brought two runs in.
Ruben Amaro gave Stanford a 5-0
lead in the second with a three-run
homer to right.
It seemed that the game wouldn't
be close. It wasn't. Cal dominated the
rest of the way.
A two-run, bad-hop single by

Mickey bpeck and an RBI single by
Rich Harger brought Cal to within
one in the fourth. Then, in the sixth,
the Bears broke it open against
relievers Lee Plemel and Rick Dietz.
Consecutive RBI singles by
Harger. Rich Aldrete and Jeff Weiss
put Cal ahead 7-6. Kevin Maas
padded the Bears' lead with a two
run single to right. When the inning
was finally over. Cal had scored five
runs, poked six singles and built a 9-6
lead.
A three-run lead was more than
enough for Cal starter Dave Masters.
After the second. Masters allowed
only one run and two hits. Although
he walked 10 men. Masters also
struck out 10. including Mark Davis
and Rick Lundblade five times be
tween them.
"A lot of people pitch Stanford in.
but I've had success going away."
Masters said. " I made some good
pitches to them (Davis and
Lundblade). I changed speeds and
worked the outside part of the plate."
Masters was denied a complete
game when, with a six-run lead.
Milano brought in Andy Wortham to
get the final two outs in the ninth.
Milano*s decision was unpopular with
the fans, including University
President Donald Kennedy, who

with a :»-tor-b day. Weiss had
more hits than the entire Cardinal
lineup. He had been 0-for-9 in the
tirst two games. "There was no differ
ence today. I just found the holes."
Weiss said, "i was seeing the hall
great."
After Cal's convincing win. the
speculation began about whether the
Bears would qualify for next
weekend's NCAA regionals. Cal
finished the Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion season with a 17-13 record, tied
with Arizona for second place. The
Bears have been ranked higher than
the Wildcats for most of the season,
but beat Arizona only once in six tries
this year.
Not surprisingly. Cal thinks it
belongs in the tournament. "I think
we have a great chance." Weiss said.
"It would be an injustice if we don't
make it."
"I think we can play with
anybody." Masters said.
Milano hopes that his team's per
formances against the second-ranked
Cardinal will sway the members of
the NCAA selection committee. "We
played them tougher than anybody."
he said "They've blown everyone
else out."
Even though Cal is undoubtedly
one of the eight best teams in the
West region, the Bears are not

assured of a spot, according to Stan
ford Coach Mark Marquess. "They'll
take the best teams even if they have
to move them." said Marquess, a
member of the selection committee.
However, both the Bears and the
Wildcats can count on some support
from Marquess. "I think Cal deserves
to go. and so does Arizona." he said.
"But guys from other parts of the
country may feel just as strongly
about other teams."
Had Cal been able to get one more
out on Saturday, the Bears might be
breathing a little easier right now.
"We win that one and we're a shoo
in.'' Milano said.
Saturday's game was the final
home contest for the Bears' seniors,
and after seven innings, it appeared
that their final effort at Evans Dia
mond would be a winning one.
Cal starter Will Schock hadn't been
pretty — allowing four hits and four
walks and hitting two batters — but
he had a 4-0 lead going into the
eighth. "I had real good luck today."
he said. "I've pitched better games,
but the guys played real well behind
me."
The guys Schock referred to were
the Cal infielders. who got him out of
trouble four times with double plays.
