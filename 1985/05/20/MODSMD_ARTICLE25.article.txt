Sunny skies and flat .water made for a "really fun"
weekend on Lake Natoma. said sophomore crew member
Felicia Keesing. However, the Stanford men's and
women's crews came up short in their bids to upset Wash
ington and California at the Pacific Coast Rowing Cham
pionships there this weekend.
The men's freshman eight-man and varsity four-man
crews each finished third and may go on to the nationals,
while the varsity and junior varsity eights were both
fourth. The novice four finished sixth, and the novice
eight did not qualify for the final heat. Washington was
victorious in all but the varsity four race, which was won
by Orange Coast College.
The Cardinal women's team fared slightly better, finish
ing third in the varsity, junior varsity, and novice eights
and seventh in the novice four.
"Overall, we were pleased." Women's Asst. Coach
Wendy Davis said of the weekend's performance.
"Everyone raced well, and we did a little better than in
previous years."
The women found themselves in the familiar position of
chasing Washington and Cal. and nearly overcame the
Golden Bears in the JV eights race. The JVs, who Keesing
said were "racing incredibly well." came on strong at the
finish, but fell short by a half second.
Jim Farwell, men's assistant coach, was especially
pleased with the freshman eight. "They had an emotional
victory in beating UCLA, who they had been close to all
year," he said.
The freshmen won their first heat, and eventually
finished third out of I 7 boats. Farwell said that the fresh
men will probably receive an invitation to the nationals,
but whether they go will depend on finances.
