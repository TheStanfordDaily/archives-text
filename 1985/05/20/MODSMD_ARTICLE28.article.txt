# Panel clashes on Nicaragua
## 
### DANNY PEARL Staff writer 
A U.S. State Department repre
sentative last night defended the U.S.
withdrawal from the world court case
brought against it by Nicaragua, and a
visiting Stanford Law School profes
sor said the Reagan administration
was "using guns instead of the law"
and should return to the world court.
Nicaragua sued the United States
in the world court, officially called the
International Court of Justice, last
year for allegedly violating interna
tional law by supporting rebels at
tempting to overthrow the Sandinista
government.
Law Prof. Leonard Boudin told a
Kresge Auditorium audience of 200
last night that the United States, by
subsequently deciding to ignore
world court proceedings in Central
America, has contradicted its own
priciples of international adjudica
tion, has set a dangerous precedent
for other countries and has let serious
charges of aggression go unanswered.

"Our withdrawal, in the view of
leading international lawyers, is a vir
tual admission of guilt." said Boudin.
"If we have erred, we should take our
medicine, and we should return to the
court."
But Michael Kozak. deputy legal
adviser for the State Department,
said the world court has no jurisdic
tion in "ongoing armed hostilities."
charged Nicaragua with "forum
hopping" to try to sway public
opinion and implied that accession to
the court's judgment would allow a
"propaganda spectacular" which
would subvert regional peace efforts.
"What if we were to proceed on the
merits and to successfully establish
Nicaragua's armed aggression and the
lawfulness of the U.S. response?
What would we have achieved? A
useful propaganda victory — yes. But
a contribution to the resolution of the
conflict — no." said Kozak.
Kozak said the U.N. Security
Council, not the world court, has
jurisdiction in cases where armed

conflict is continuing. He said
Nicaragua had no right to bring suit
because Nicaragua had never com
mitted itself to compulsory court
jurisdiction. He said it is not wrong or
uncommon for a nation to modify its
agreement to submit to the court's
jurisdiction in all cases.
Boudin said the world court itself
has voted overwhelmingly that it has
jurisdiction over the case, and noted
that Congress, when it accepted com
pulsory court jurisdiction in 1946.
stressed that the agreement was a
•"renunciation" of the idea that a na
tion could withdraw from interna
tional jurisdiction in the face of a
threatened legal action.
Kozak said the Reagan administra
tion was trying to save the Contadora
peace process, which he said would
be damaged by a world court case.
But Boudin accused Reagan of trying
to undermine the Contadora agree
ment, which he said Nicaragua
already supports.
