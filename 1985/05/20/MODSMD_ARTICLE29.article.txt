### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
A year and a half after receiving formal recognition
from the University, Sigma Phi Epsilon was granted chap
ter status by that fraternity's national organization this
weekend.
Until now, the local group was recognized as a colony,
acording to Mani Sadeghi, president of the Stanford chap
ter.
Before attaining status as a chapter, the local colony
had to fulfill a number of criteria, according to Jim
McVey, the fraternity's controller.
"You have to show long-term stability . . . and have a
stable number of poeple," McVey said, noting that the
fraternity attracted 22 pledges during rush this spring,
raising the total number of members to 42.
In addition, the colony had to achieve a stable financial
situation, form an alumni support network and file a 100-

page petition with the national organization containing
explanations of why the colony should be granted chapter
status, McVey said.
According to Sadeghi, the members of the fraternity are
now eligible to receive educational scholarships from the
national organization. In addition, the fraternity can
receive cash awards for outstanding acheivement in both
academics and community service projects, he said.
Gaining recognition as a chapter is "a way of recogniz
ing we've established a quality operation at Stanford that
is going to go on and get better each year," McVey said.
"I've dedicated my last two years to this," McVey said,
adding that the fraternity has "really made great strides,
especially in the last year."
"This is the culmination of our efforts from the last two
and-a-half years," Sadeghi said, noting that plans for a
Sigma Phi Epsilon chapter here were begun by nine mem
bers of the Nutes, an intramural athletic team.
