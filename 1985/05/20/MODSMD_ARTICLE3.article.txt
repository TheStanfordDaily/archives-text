# No. 1 women fall to Trinity
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
OKLAHOMA CITY — The ball landed about 50 yards
away, bounced up and hit the fence just below the"Court
4" sign, then came to rest in the grassy area near the base
of the fence.
The ball had come off the racket of Stanford sopho
more Patty Fendick no more than a second after she had
mis-hit a forehand volley straight down into the court.
The missed volley gave Trinity's No. 2 doubles team of
Elvyn Barrable and Jana Klepac the point, the game, the
set and the doubles match.
It also gave Trinity the team match.
Trinity, the eighth-seed in the NCAA Women s Tennis
Championships, had upset — no, utterly shocked — top
seeded and defending champion Stanford, 5-4. Not in the
final, not in the semifinal, but in Friday's quarterfinal.
"I'm disappointed," said a stunned, yet composed Stan
ford Coach Frank Brennan. "I thought we had a good
chance to win the whole thing. But Trinity beat us. We
played well, and they just beat us.
"All those things that could possibly have happened,
happened."
It was one of those matches that it seemed Stanford, a
winner of 52 of its last 53 matches dating back to last
season, just wouldn't lose. Sure, it might be close, but the
Cardinal would pull it out as it had on so many other occa
sions this season.
But unlike sports such as boxing, there are no ringside
judges in tennis to give the champion the benefit of the
doubt. The team that is victorious in five or more
matches wins. The team that isn't loses.
"I thought we were going to sweat bullets in the singles
and get through today (in the
doubles), and then regroup tomor
row," said Brennan, whose Cardinal
teams have finished worse in NCAA
tournament play only once in his six
year tenure. "But I guess some things
aren't meant to be."
One thing that evidently wasn't
meant to be was a meeting between
Stanford and second-seeded USC in
the tournament final. The Trojans,
who were as shocked that Stanford
lost as the Cardinal was, waltzed
through the four-day tournament
with 9-0, 8-1, 9-0 and 6-3 victories,
the final decision over Miami (Fla.) in
yesterday's final.
Trinity clinched third-place honors
with a 5-1 victory over sixth-seeded
California earlier in the day.
For Stanford, the bitter taste of
losing in the quarterfinals was made
even worse by the fact that the Card
inal was a combined 5-1 against the
four teams that finished higher in the
tournament, including its two vic
tories in three tries against USC.
"The girls are in shock right now
because we've won so many matches
and so many big matches," Brennan
said Friday, a few hours after the loss.
"So when they lose, they are in shock.
They can't understand why or how
they've lost."
Make no mistake, Stanford had
more than its share of chances to put
Trinity away. Less than an hour into
the contest, Fendick had won 6-2, 5-2
at No. 2 singles, and freshman Kay
Tittle had won 6-2, 7-5 at No. 5.
Stanford had already locked up first
sets in three of the other four singles
matches, and appeared well on its
way to handing Trinity the same sort
of shellacking it dealt Harvard in the
first round.
Then, as it did in its only other loss
this season (a 5-4 setback to USC
March 27), Stanford mysteriously
began to unravel. Sophomore Steph
anie Savides fell at No. 4 singles to
Klepac after leading 6-1, 4-2. Senior
Linda Gates lost at No. 1 to former
junior doubles partner Gretchen
Rush, despite winning the first set 6-4.
The Cardinal, which never trailed
until the end, went ahead 3-2 when
junior Alyce Werdel prevailed 7-5, 6-
1 at No. 6, leaving sophomore Leigh
Anne Eldredge's No. 3 match as the
sole remaining singles contest.

Eldredge split sets with Barrable.
but was unable to win the third, los
ing 7-5, 3-6, 6-2. That tied it at 3-3
and sent the match to doubles as
anyone's ballgame.
"I think after the singles, everyone
was standing around and wondering
what was going on," Brennan said.
"They were stunned."
Gates and her teammates agreed.
"After the singles, my feeling was, '1
wish we could start over.' " Gates
said. "I think Trinity had a lot of mo
mentum. They went into the doubles
in a better position than I think they
expected to be in."
In the doubles, Savides and Tittle
jumped all over Trinity's No. 3 team
of Mary Graber and Jennifer Potter,
breezing to a 6-1, 6-3 victory.
However, Stanford's 4-3 lead was
short-lived, as Trinity's No. 1 team of
Rush and Lisa Sasano dusted off
Gates and Eldredge, 6-2, 6-3.
That left it up to Fendick and Wer
del at No. 2 doubles if the Cardinal's
hopes to win its second straight
NCAA crown and third in four years
were to remain alive. Barrable and
Klepac won the first set and Fendick
and Werdel the second, sending the
doubles match and the team match
into a third set.
The Cardinal fell behind early, and
if it hadn't been for a Trinity lob
that went long in the third game,
Fendick and Werdel would have been
down two service breaks at 3-0. Stan
ford did close it to 4-3 when Werdel
held serve, but Klepac returned the
favor to make it 5-3.
With Fendick serving at double
match point in the ninth game, Wer
del put away an overhead to knot the
game score at three-all. Then came
the match-deciding point.
"She hit a serve with a lot of
topspin," Klepac said of Fendick's
first offering. "I hit it back low, think
ing that it would either hit the top of
the net or just get over it. It got over
and she (Fendick) just missed the vol
ley."
Barrable and Klepac, not to men
tion the rest of the Trinity team, went
wild. Fendick picked up the ball and
put it into orbit, while her teammates,
some sitting, others standing, stared
blankly at the court.
"Patty and Alyce have done it in
the past, and I thought they would do
it again," Brennan said. "In fact, they

played better today than they did
against USC (in Stanford's come
from-behind 5-4 victory two weeks
ago), but it wasn't enough. Barrrable
and Klepac were awesome today."
So was the rest of Trinity's team,
for that matter.
"I told the kids that I was really
excited about these nationals," Tiger
Coach Emilie Foster said. "They
didn't believe me. But this group had
more guts than any I've ever worked
with.
"I guess it's easy to look back and
say we had nothing to lose," she con
tinued. "But we don't take that ap
proach. We approach each match, no

matter who the opponent, [believing]
that we have a chance to win."
It's also easy to look back at Bren
nan's decision two weeks ago to
suspend Anna Ivan, the freshman
phenom who quit the team after
Brennan suspended her because "she
did not adjust to the team concept."
But Brennan stuck by his decision,
calling the Ivan issue "water under
the bridge."
"We've been without Anna Ivan
for so many matches that it (her ab
sence) really didn't enter anyone's
mind," Brennan said. "It's a nice
excuse to have, but I don't think it
would have made much difference."

Trinity, smashing a tennis ball 50 yards away after the final point of the
last match.
