# Carson to edit King papers
## 
### BARBARA SCHULER Senior staff writer 
History Prof. Clayborne Carson was for
mally appointed editor of the Martin Luther
King Papers, a proposed 12-volume collec
tion of the slain civil rights leader's
speeches, sermons and personal papers, at a
press conference Thursday in Atlanta.
King's widow, Coretta Scott King, who is
the president of the King Center for Non
violent Social Change, made the announce
ment. The King Papers project, scheduled to
begin in June, will entail organizing the
I ()(),()()() documents already secured by the
King Center, making new acquisitions, as
sembling, editing and publishing the papers,
Carson said.
"The King papers are an extremely im
portant source for understanding the civil
rights movement and the 1960s in general.
Having the project at Stanford would pro
vide a unique opportunity for Stanford stu
dents to have access to this important collec
tion," Carson said. He called the documents
at the King Center in Atlanta "the most im
portant single body of information on the
civil rights movement."
The project, "a long-term, collective ef
fort." will include scholars from many disci
plines and is expected to continue for at
least 15 years, according to Carson. Two un
dergraduate interns will be selected each
quarter to work on the project, with the first
pair starting next October. Those positions
will be advertised and applications accepted

at the start of fall quarter.
According to Carson, the relocation of the
project's headquarters to Stanford will
benefit campus research facilities. "Our li
brary resources in the civil rights area will be
augmented because of the project.
Therefore, the University as a whole will be

a much more important center for civil
rights research." Carson said.
King and Carson, who was asked in Janu
ary to head the project, will choose a pub
lisher for the papers sometime in the next

three to four months.
The contenders include the Stanford
Press, which Carson said has "certainly indi
cated theii strong interest in the King
papers. 1 think they'll put up a strong offer,"
he added. Carson will meet with Grant
Barnes, director of the press, and several
editors tomorrow to discuss the possibilities
for the project.
Barnes told The Daily he is "extremely"
interested in the King Papers, but that, as
yet, he knows little about the criteria and
considerations Carson and King have for the
papers' publication. That is the purpose of
tomorrow's meeting, he said.
In its favor, "Stanford Press has an excel
lent record as a publisher of letters and per
sonal papers." Barnes said. However, he
added, "It's possible that Mrs. King would
have a sense of geographical identity and
want a publisher in the South."
"Just in principle, wouldn't it be a won
derful thing for Stanford to be the publisher
of this 12-volume collection of King's
work?" Barnes asked. "If we could some
how participate in his life and in his work . . .
that would be wonderful."
Funding for the project, both for the col
lecting and editing of the papers and for
their publication, is still uncertain.
The University has agreed to provide staff
and office space, but negotiations are still
underway amoni: Carson, the King Center
