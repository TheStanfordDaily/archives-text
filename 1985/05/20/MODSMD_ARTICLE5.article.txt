### TROY EID Editorial staff 
Stanford police shut down at least three
large campus parties this weekend, citing ex
cessive noise and numerous complaints.
Without warning, police on Saturday
night intervened to stop the Rmc-a-delt
Party on Wilbur Field, then put an end to
the Hula Party, staged at Lake* l.agunita by
the Delta Upsilon fraternity, witnesses said.
Yesterday's Florence Moore Miller High
I ife party, held on Florence Moore Field.
w;ts called off by police between 5:30 and 6
p.m.
Police also reportedly shut down a Satur
day night party at Governor's Corner, al
though it was unclear when that incident oc
curred. Stanford police were unavailable for
comment Saturday night and yesterday.
In a related incident, a Stanford sopho
more sustained neck injuries when he fell
from a tree during the Hula Party.
Andrew MacTavish was treated at the
scene by paramedics, who arrived at Lake
Lagunita at around 10 p.m., witnesses said.
MacTavish. who was fitted with a neck

brace, left the party on foot about 30
minutes later with the help of two friends,
according to a source who asked not to be
identified. The party was called off shortly
afterward.
MacTavish. a member of the fraternity,
could not be reached by The Daily yester
day.and DU President Mike Minchin said
he would not comment on the incident.
David Ransburg. chief organizer of the
Rinc-a-delt Party, said the trouble on Wil
bur Field started when a sound crew setting
up for the Freaky Executives finished an
hour late, throwing the evening's festivities
off schedule.
"'They (members of the sound crew) were
supposed to get started at S p.m.. but they
didn't finish until after i ). because they took
a break before they were supposed to."
Ransburg said. "The Freaky Executives
played for about an hour, then Wire Train
was up. but about a minute into it the police
came and shut it down."
Dave Ellison, a resident assistant at Rin
conada. the Wilbur house that sponsored
the party, said Stanford police officers came

to him before they stopped the Wire Train
performance.
"Sgt. Nick Brunot said to me. "We're
going to shut you down.' " Ellison said. "He
said they'd received 60 complaints from
people complaining about the noise.'"
Ransburg said he talked to Brunot five
minutes later, "and Brunot said. "We've
received 100 complaints.'
"So I suppose that in five minutes, the
police got 40 complaints." Ransburg said
sarcastically. "Brunot said their policy is
that after three complaints, they come out.
But they didn't come until 100."
Ransburg and Ellison said they "begged
and pleaded" backstage with Brunot to keep
the party going.
"We payed $1,000 for this band (Wire
Train), and they didn't even play one song."
Ransburg said. "Brunot was a wall. He
shined the flashlight on the drummer's face
to get him to stop playing. He said to the
drummer. "You touch those drums and
you're going to jail.'
"When I kept pleading with him.
Brunot said. "Come on. Be
reasonable.' " Ransburg said. "I
laughed. He was telling me to be
reasonable."
At that point. Ransburg said
Brunot confronted him directly.
"He (Brunot) said something to
the effect that he would slap hand
cuffs on me and take me to jail, if I'd
like that." Ransburg said.
Brunot then directly confronted
the band. Ransburg said. One band
member walked out on stage and told
the crowd of 1,200 that the police
were shutting down the Rinc-a-delt
party. "Everyone booed," he said.
Ellison said that by telling more
than a thousand people that Wire
Train would have to stop playing, the
police put Rinc-a-delt organizers in a
potentially dangerous situation.
"The police were sitting behind the
stage, and we seriously weren't sure
what the crowd was going to do," El
lison said.
Ransburg said the party, with a
total budget of about $4,000, was
aimed partly at raising money for
charity. "We called the police a
couple of days before so they'd know
about it."he said. "They had our

phone numbers. We have answering
machines, so we know that the police
never called us."
Ransburg and Ellison said police
left the part) after crews began taking
down the stage, then returned an
hour later, at 12:30 a.m.
"There was a stereo playing in the
window of a room on the third floor
of Rinconada. pointing toward
Stern." Ransburg said. "(The stereoj
was playing for the guys taking down
the stage. So the police came back
and made the guy turn off the
stereo."
Ellison elaborated. "I followed the
police up to the third floor. This
police officer was pounding on the
door of this guy's room with a
nightstick. I told him, 'I do have the
master key." He said, if you want to,
you can open this thing up.' I said it
would be better to ask the person first
. . . and another officer yelled at me.
"Get down to the end of the hall if you
aren't going to help.' When 1 tried to
explain, he said, "This isn't a debate.
Get out of here.' "
A witness at the scene of the Satur
day Hula Party, who demanded
anonymity, said party goers called
911 emergency after MacTavish's fall
because "they thought this guy
(MacTavish) was dead."
"It's nothing," the witness contin
ued. "Somebody panicked. . . . But

he's OK now."
A police officer patrolling the area
near the party, who would not give
his name and could not he identified,
said. "Somebody fell out of a tree.
What more do you want?" He would
not elaborate.
Two Palo Alto Fire Department
engines, an ambulance and at least
two police cars converged at the Lake
Lagunita parking lot on Lomita
Street. Jerry Davis, the department's
battalion chief on duty yesterday af
ternoon. said he would not receive a
report of the incident until sometime
today.
Davis, saying the department sends
only one fire engine to "any first aid
call," could not explain why two
engines responded to the incident.
"There shouldn't have been two
engines there, unless there was over
lapping jurisdiction," Davis said.
"Even if the guy really was dead, we
would still only send one engine."
The extent of MacTavish's injuries
is unclear, but Debbie Ecker. credit
manager in the Stanford Hospital's
Admitting Office, confirmed that
MacTavish was not admitted to the
hospital Saturday night or yesterday.
Norm Robinson, associate dean of
Student Affairs for Residential Edu
cation, did not comment on the issue
when contacted yesterday afternoon.

you're going to jail.'
"When I kept pleading with him.
Brunot said. "Come on. Be
reasonable.' " Ransburg said. "I
laughed. He was telling me to be
reasonable."
At that point. Ransburg said
Brunot confronted him directly.
"He (Brunot) said something to
the effect that he would slap hand
cuffs on me and take me to jail, if I'd
like that." Ransburg said.
Brunot then directly confronted
the band. Ransburg said. One band
member walked out on stage and told
the crowd of 1,200 that the police
were shutting down the Rinc-a-delt
party. "Everyone booed," he said.
Ellison said that by telling more
than a thousand people that Wire
Train would have to stop playing, the
police put Rinc-a-delt organizers in a
potentially dangerous situation.
"The police were sitting behind the
stage, and we seriously weren't sure
what the crowd was going to do," El
lison said.
Ransburg said the party, with a
total budget of about $4,000, was
aimed partly at raising money for
charity. "We called the police a
couple of days before so they'd know
about it."he said. "They had our

phone numbers. We have answering
machines, so we know that the police
never called us."
Ransburg and Ellison said police
left the part) after crews began taking
down the stage, then returned an
hour later, at 12:30 a.m.
"There was a stereo playing in the
window of a room on the third floor
of Rinconada. pointing toward
Stern." Ransburg said. "(The stereoj
was playing for the guys taking down
the stage. So the police came back
and made the guy turn off the
stereo."
Ellison elaborated. "I followed the
police up to the third floor. This
police officer was pounding on the
door of this guy's room with a
nightstick. I told him, 'I do have the
master key." He said, if you want to,
you can open this thing up.' I said it
would be better to ask the person first
. . . and another officer yelled at me.
"Get down to the end of the hall if you
aren't going to help.' When 1 tried to
explain, he said, "This isn't a debate.
Get out of here.' "
A witness at the scene of the Satur
day Hula Party, who demanded
anonymity, said party goers called
911 emergency after MacTavish's fall
because "they thought this guy
(MacTavish) was dead."
"It's nothing," the witness contin
ued. "Somebody panicked. . . . But

he's OK now."
A police officer patrolling the area
near the party, who would not give
his name and could not he identified,
said. "Somebody fell out of a tree.
What more do you want?" He would
not elaborate.
Two Palo Alto Fire Department
engines, an ambulance and at least
two police cars converged at the Lake
Lagunita parking lot on Lomita
Street. Jerry Davis, the department's
battalion chief on duty yesterday af
ternoon. said he would not receive a
report of the incident until sometime
today.
Davis, saying the department sends
only one fire engine to "any first aid
call," could not explain why two
engines responded to the incident.
"There shouldn't have been two
engines there, unless there was over
lapping jurisdiction," Davis said.
"Even if the guy really was dead, we
would still only send one engine."
The extent of MacTavish's injuries
is unclear, but Debbie Ecker. credit
manager in the Stanford Hospital's
Admitting Office, confirmed that
MacTavish was not admitted to the
hospital Saturday night or yesterday.
Norm Robinson, associate dean of
Student Affairs for Residential Edu
cation, did not comment on the issue
when contacted yesterday afternoon.
"This is the first I've heard of it,"he
said.
Stanford police shut down at least three
large campus parties this weekend, citing ex
cessive noise and numerous complaints.
Without warning, police on Saturday
night intervened to stop the Rmc-a-delt
Party on Wilbur Field, then put an end to
the Hula Party, staged at Lake* l.agunita by
the Delta Upsilon fraternity, witnesses said.
Yesterday's Florence Moore Miller High
I ife party, held on Florence Moore Field.
w;ts called off by police between 5:30 and 6
p.m.
Police also reportedly shut down a Satur
day night party at Governor's Corner, al
though it was unclear when that incident oc
curred. Stanford police were unavailable for
comment Saturday night and yesterday.
In a related incident, a Stanford sopho
more sustained neck injuries when he fell
from a tree during the Hula Party.
Andrew MacTavish was treated at the
scene by paramedics, who arrived at Lake
Lagunita at around 10 p.m., witnesses said.
MacTavish. who was fitted with a neck

brace, left the party on foot about 30
minutes later with the help of two friends,
according to a source who asked not to be
identified. The party was called off shortly
afterward.
MacTavish. a member of the fraternity,
could not be reached by The Daily yester
day.and DU President Mike Minchin said
he would not comment on the incident.
David Ransburg. chief organizer of the
Rinc-a-delt Party, said the trouble on Wil
bur Field started when a sound crew setting
up for the Freaky Executives finished an
hour late, throwing the evening's festivities
off schedule.
"'They (members of the sound crew) were
supposed to get started at S p.m.. but they
didn't finish until after i ). because they took
a break before they were supposed to."
Ransburg said. "The Freaky Executives
played for about an hour, then Wire Train
was up. but about a minute into it the police
came and shut it down."
Dave Ellison, a resident assistant at Rin
conada. the Wilbur house that sponsored
the party, said Stanford police officers came

to him before they stopped the Wire Train
performance.
"Sgt. Nick Brunot said to me. "We're
going to shut you down.' " Ellison said. "He
said they'd received 60 complaints from
people complaining about the noise.'"
Ransburg said he talked to Brunot five
minutes later, "and Brunot said. "We've
received 100 complaints.'
"So I suppose that in five minutes, the
police got 40 complaints." Ransburg said
sarcastically. "Brunot said their policy is
that after three complaints, they come out.
But they didn't come until 100."
Ransburg and Ellison said they "begged
and pleaded" backstage with Brunot to keep
the party going.
"We payed $1,000 for this band (Wire
Train), and they didn't even play one song."
Ransburg said. "Brunot was a wall. He
shined the flashlight on the drummer's face
to get him to stop playing. He said to the
drummer. "You touch those drums and
you're going to jail.'
"When I kept pleading with him.
Brunot said. "Come on. Be
reasonable.' " Ransburg said. "I
