Stanford police shut down at least three
large campus parties this weekend, citing ex
cessive noise and numerous complaints.
Without warning, police on Saturday
night intervened to stop the Rmc-a-delt
Party on Wilbur Field, then put an end to
the Hula Party, staged at Lake* l.agunita by
the Delta Upsilon fraternity, witnesses said.
Yesterday's Florence Moore Miller High
I ife party, held on Florence Moore Field.
w;ts called off by police between 5:30 and 6
p.m.
Police also reportedly shut down a Satur
day night party at Governor's Corner, al
though it was unclear when that incident oc
curred. Stanford police were unavailable for
comment Saturday night and yesterday.
In a related incident, a Stanford sopho
more sustained neck injuries when he fell
from a tree during the Hula Party.
Andrew MacTavish was treated at the
scene by paramedics, who arrived at Lake
Lagunita at around 10 p.m., witnesses said.
MacTavish. who was fitted with a neck

brace, left the party on foot about 30
minutes later with the help of two friends,
according to a source who asked not to be
identified. The party was called off shortly
afterward.
MacTavish. a member of the fraternity,
could not be reached by The Daily yester
day.and DU President Mike Minchin said
he would not comment on the incident.
David Ransburg. chief organizer of the
Rinc-a-delt Party, said the trouble on Wil
bur Field started when a sound crew setting
up for the Freaky Executives finished an
hour late, throwing the evening's festivities
off schedule.
"'They (members of the sound crew) were
supposed to get started at S p.m.. but they
didn't finish until after i ). because they took
a break before they were supposed to."
Ransburg said. "The Freaky Executives
played for about an hour, then Wire Train
was up. but about a minute into it the police
came and shut it down."
Dave Ellison, a resident assistant at Rin
conada. the Wilbur house that sponsored
the party, said Stanford police officers came

to him before they stopped the Wire Train
performance.
"Sgt. Nick Brunot said to me. "We're
going to shut you down.' " Ellison said. "He
said they'd received 60 complaints from
people complaining about the noise.'"
Ransburg said he talked to Brunot five
minutes later, "and Brunot said. "We've
received 100 complaints.'
"So I suppose that in five minutes, the
police got 40 complaints." Ransburg said
sarcastically. "Brunot said their policy is
that after three complaints, they come out.
But they didn't come until 100."
Ransburg and Ellison said they "begged
and pleaded" backstage with Brunot to keep
the party going.
"We payed $1,000 for this band (Wire
Train), and they didn't even play one song."
Ransburg said. "Brunot was a wall. He
shined the flashlight on the drummer's face
to get him to stop playing. He said to the
drummer. "You touch those drums and
you're going to jail.'
