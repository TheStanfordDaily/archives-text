# Meyer continues fight against food and drink
## 
### PETER HAVEN Staff writer 
To show that, for library staff members,
food and library materials do not mix,
Meyer Library has initiated a campaign, now
in its second week, to educate library users
about the no-food/no-drink policy at the li
brary.
Last week, members of the Stanford Polo
Club, who are assisting the Meyer staff with
the campaign, asked all patrons walking
through the library's entrance turnstiles to
open their backpacks and book bags for a
food and drink check.
If any food was found, the person was
asked to consume it in the first-floor lobby
before entering or to leave it with the library
monitors and claim it upon leaving.
T his week, the monitors will continue to
patrol the library during certain hours of the
day and to ask those consuming food either
to take it to the first-floor lobby or to dispose
of it in garbage sacks carried by the
monitors.
As part of the campaign, the library staff
has installed a large display case in front of
the main entrance. It is filled with food, soft
drink cans, candy wrappers and other
garbage, plus coffee-stained books and other
library supplies the staff savs have been

damaged by food materials in the library.
A sign in the display case says all the garbage
was collected by one person in 15 minutes.
"The major reason for the campaign is just
because it's so annoying to have all that food
around, " said Bob Kieft, head of Meyer's
circulation services.
Members of the polo club who have been
monitoring the turnstiles said that on the
whole, student reaction has been
cooperative, with only a few exceptions.
"They've been extremely cooperative —
much more so than I expected — and
seemed to understand why we were doing
it," said Feisal Khan, one of the monitors.
Khan did say there have been a few inci
dents where people were extremely un
cooperative. He said one man stormed
through the turnstiles with his backpack, told
the monitors he had his lunch inside and en
tered the library.
The man later re-appeared without his
backpack and lectured the monitors "on how
it was wrong not to trust the students and al
low them to take their food inside," Khan
said.
"A lot of people arc accepting it, but there

has been a fair amount of hostility,"
said Craig Hammond, a Meyer Li
brary portal monitor for the last year
and a half. "Some have even men
tioned Gestapo tactics," he said.
"I think 'Gestapo' is certainly hy
perbolic," Kieft said. "The searches
do slow people down, and it is incon
venient, but 1 think it's . . . simply a
reminder to people of their com

munal responsibilities. We have to
remind them of the violations they
are making."
Leigh Jackson, a first-year
graduate student in English and
American literature who was an un
dergraduate at Harvard, was forced
to give up her boxed salad last week
before she entered the library.
"For those of us who stay in the li
brary for a long time, it's incon
venient to come down here, and it's
also not a very nice place," Jackson
said of the Meyer first-floor lobby.
"Everybody breaks the rule; it's a

ridiculous rule," she said.
Jackson said Harvard libraries have
no such rule, "or if there was one it
was routinely broken."
Sophomore Liz Howell said she
feels that sudents' privacy was being
invaded.
"I can understand their point, but
it's kind of stupid to have backpacks
checked. It's an invasion of privacy."
Howell said. "If you get it (food) in,
you get it in. This isn't going to stop it."
According to library fliers, which
were placed last week at both the
Meyer entrance turnstiles and at the

foot of the stairs in the inner lobby, li
brary materials such as books, films,
microfilms, recordings and journals
can be damaged either by direct con
tact with food and drink or by having
food transferred to them by their
users' hands.
"In addition, leftover food attracts
vermin; and since ants, cockroaches,
and mice will just as happily eat your
trash from a wastebasket as from a
desk top or the floor, even those who
clean up their work area contribute to
the problem," the flier said.
Carpets and furniture also suffer

damage from food and drink in the li
braries, said Sally Buchanan, head of
the conservation office of Stanford
University Libraries.
kieft. who has worked at Meyer
since 1981. said that there is really no
way to measure the cost of damage
done to library materials by food, but
that it is considerable.
"If a lot of money has to be spent
on cleaning, that same amount of
money can't be spent on a com
fortable chair or another computer
terminal." she said. "It's costly in
terms of repairs, replacement and

staff time in terms of inconvenience."
If chairs, floors or computer termi
nals are damaged, the cost falls under
the budget of the Operations and
Management Department or the
equipment budget of of the Univer
sity Libraries. Buchanan said.
"All of this basically comes from
student fees." she said. "Students
aren't the only ones who pay. but stu
dent fees help provide the service."
"Depending on the funding, we
may hire people to patrol the building
throughout the school year." Kieft
said.
