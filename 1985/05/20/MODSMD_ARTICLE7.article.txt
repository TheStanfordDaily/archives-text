Gemayel's palace machine-gunned
BEIRUT — President Amin Gemayel's palace was hit by heavy
machine-gun tire yesterday as lighting between Christian and Moslem
militias in Beirut entered its fourth week. Gemayel. a Christian, was not
hurt, police said.
Police said three people were killed and 21 wounded in the night-long
battles, which continued despite a Christian militia's move to appease
neighboring Syria and its Moslem allies in Lebanon by cutting ties with
Israel.
An anonymous caller claiming to represent the Islamic Jihad group
told a Western news agency in Beirut that the fundamentalist extremists
were also responsible for two bomb explosion Saturday in the Saudi
Arabian capital of Riyadh.
The Saudi Interior Ministry said one person was killed and three
wounded when the bombs detonated in garbage trucks on a busy street.
The caller said Islamic Jihad, believed to be loyal to Iran's revolution
ary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, will unleash more attacks
against Saudi Arabia "in order to shake up the retrogressive monarchy."
I lie official Islamic Republic News Agency in Tehran, however,
blamed the bombings on Iran's enemy, Iraq.
Beirut police said the 42-year-old Gemayel was in his hilltop palace in
suburban Baabda, five miles east of the city, when it was raked bv fire
from anti-aircraft guns early yesterday.
A police statement said no tine in the palace was hurt. It was not
known whether the gunfire was aimed at the palace or was a stray burst
from militia in the hills near Baabda.
Hundreds of families spent another night huddled in basements and
bomb shelters as shells thudded along the three-mile-long Green Line
that divides Christian East Beirut and the Moslem west side.
Police said 1 17 people have been killed and 603 wounded since the
Beirut fighting flared April 28.
In southern Lebanon, the Lebanese Forces, the country's largest
Christian militia, began withdrawing by boat for the Christian heartland
north of Beirut, according to militia officials who asked not to be named.
I he militia leader, Elie Hobeika, announced the withdrawal Saturday
and said that the Lebanese Forces will close their liaison office in
Jerusalem.
The move appeared intended to distance the Christian command from
its former Israeli ally after Moslem warlords refused to negotiate with
the Christians as long as they were linked to Israel.
Hobeika also called for a "final, comprehensive cease-fire" through
out Lebanon.
"I am more optimistic of a solution," Prime Minister Rashid Karami,
a Sunni Moslem, responded yesterday in an interview with the Arab
Gulf News Agency.
I he conservative Moslem newspaper Al-Liwa quoted sources close to
Nabih Berri, leader of the Shiitc Amal movement, as saying he was
"very pleased" with the Christian moves, which he called "extremely
important."
I he political maneuvering reinforced speculation that Syria will send
troops into Beirut to halt the fighting, as it did in 1976 at the request of
then-Lebanese President Suleiman Franjieh.
Christian and Moslem leaders have urged Syrian military intervention.
But officials in Syria indicated President Hafez Assad will not move until
Israel completes its scheduled withdrawal from southern Lebanon early
next month.
Syrian-backed militiamen loyal to Assad recently have taken over
Moslem positions in Beirut. Scores of Syrian intelligence officers also
have been spotted on the Green Line.
Despite the Christian efforts, Syrian-backed Druse leader Walid
Jumblatt declared in the southern part of Sidon that the "general battle
in Lebanon is not over and won't be over as long as the tyrant (Gemayel)
remains in Baabda."
Sri Lankan forces kill 59
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Security forces in eastern Sri Lanka killed
59 unarmed Tamil men and then burned their bodies on a pile of blazing
tires to destroy the evidence, a Tamil leader said yesterday.
Government and police officials disputed the allegation, saying they
had received no report of such a massacre.
Paul Nallanayagam, president of a citizens' committee in the coastal
town of Kalmunai, 140 miles east of Colombo, said the Tamils were
killed Friday and Saturday.
He had said Friday that police commandos killed 23 young Tamil
men, apparently in revenge for a raid by Tamil extremists who killed 148
people in an attack on the sacred Buddhist city of Anuradhapura last
Tuesday.
Tamil rebels are fighting for an independent state in northern Sri
Lanka. The Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, make up about 18 per
cent of Sri Lanka's 15 million people. They claim the government, led by
the Buddhist Sinhalese majority, discriminates against them.
Nallanayagam, contacted yesterday by telephone by The Associated
Press, said the commandos seized the 23 Tamils near a village just
outside Kalmunai. moved them in trucks to another spot, made dig a
ditch and then killed them, dumping the bodies into the ditch.
He said that later Friday, 17 more Tamil men were killed and buried
at the same site, and on Saturday, 19 Tamils suffered the same fate.
Police, fearing the massacre would be discovered, exhumed the bodies
Saturday night and took them by truck to a camp five miles north of
Kalumnai where they were burned, he added.
Nallanayagam acknowledged that his information was based on ac
counts from local residents, and he said he filed a complaint with police
yesterday demanding an investigation.

journalist since becoming Soviet party chief, accused the United States
ol scuttling efforts to make the Indian Ocean a "zone of peace," the offi
cial news agency Tass said yesterday.

correspondent of the Press Trust of India on Saturday.

I he correspondent said he received responses to written questions
submitted in advance and also had a conversation with Gorbachev
during their 50-minute meeting.
In a written response to one question, Gorbachev accused the United

States has been scuttling the convening of an international conference on
this issue." Gorbachev was quoted as saying in a text issued by Tass.
"It has also unilaterally broken off the Soviet-American talks on limit
ing military activates in the Indian Ocean," Gorbachev said. "In the
meantime, the United States is constantly building up its military pres
ence there."
Tass said Gorbachev also called tin the United States to seriously con
sider Soviet calls for a nuclear weapons freeze, a ban on space-weapons
research, a nuclear test ban and a halt to new missile deployments in
Europe.

"I am more optimistic of a solution," Prime Minister Rashid Karami,
a Sunni Moslem, responded yesterday in an interview with the Arab
Gulf News Agency.
I he conservative Moslem newspaper Al-Liwa quoted sources close to
Nabih Berri, leader of the Shiitc Amal movement, as saying he was
"very pleased" with the Christian moves, which he called "extremely
important."
I he political maneuvering reinforced speculation that Syria will send
troops into Beirut to halt the fighting, as it did in 1976 at the request of
then-Lebanese President Suleiman Franjieh.
Christian and Moslem leaders have urged Syrian military intervention.
But officials in Syria indicated President Hafez Assad will not move until
Israel completes its scheduled withdrawal from southern Lebanon early
next month.
Syrian-backed militiamen loyal to Assad recently have taken over
Moslem positions in Beirut. Scores of Syrian intelligence officers also
have been spotted on the Green Line.
Despite the Christian efforts, Syrian-backed Druse leader Walid
Jumblatt declared in the southern part of Sidon that the "general battle
in Lebanon is not over and won't be over as long as the tyrant (Gemayel)
remains in Baabda."
Sri Lankan forces kill 59
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Security forces in eastern Sri Lanka killed
59 unarmed Tamil men and then burned their bodies on a pile of blazing
tires to destroy the evidence, a Tamil leader said yesterday.
Government and police officials disputed the allegation, saying they
had received no report of such a massacre.
Paul Nallanayagam, president of a citizens' committee in the coastal
town of Kalmunai, 140 miles east of Colombo, said the Tamils were
killed Friday and Saturday.
He had said Friday that police commandos killed 23 young Tamil
men, apparently in revenge for a raid by Tamil extremists who killed 148
people in an attack on the sacred Buddhist city of Anuradhapura last
Tuesday.
Tamil rebels are fighting for an independent state in northern Sri
Lanka. The Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, make up about 18 per
cent of Sri Lanka's 15 million people. They claim the government, led by
the Buddhist Sinhalese majority, discriminates against them.
Nallanayagam, contacted yesterday by telephone by The Associated
Press, said the commandos seized the 23 Tamils near a village just
outside Kalmunai. moved them in trucks to another spot, made dig a
ditch and then killed them, dumping the bodies into the ditch.
He said that later Friday, 17 more Tamil men were killed and buried
at the same site, and on Saturday, 19 Tamils suffered the same fate.
Police, fearing the massacre would be discovered, exhumed the bodies
Saturday night and took them by truck to a camp five miles north of
Kalumnai where they were burned, he added.
Nallanayagam acknowledged that his information was based on ac
counts from local residents, and he said he filed a complaint with police
yesterday demanding an investigation.

submitted in advance and also had a conversation with Gorbachev
during their 50-minute meeting.
In a written response to one question, Gorbachev accused the United
States of blocking moves to limit militarization of the Indian Ocean.
"It is common knowledge that for a number of years now the United
States has been scuttling the convening of an international conference on
this issue." Gorbachev was quoted as saying in a text issued by Tass.
"It has also unilaterally broken off the Soviet-American talks on limit
ing military activates in the Indian Ocean," Gorbachev said. "In the
meantime, the United States is constantly building up its military pres
ence there."
Tass said Gorbachev also called tin the United States to seriously con
sider Soviet calls for a nuclear weapons freeze, a ban on space-weapons
research, a nuclear test ban and a halt to new missile deployments in

BEIRUT — President Amin Gemayel's palace was hit by heavy
machine-gun tire yesterday as lighting between Christian and Moslem
militias in Beirut entered its fourth week. Gemayel. a Christian, was not
hurt, police said.
Police said three people were killed and 21 wounded in the night-long
battles, which continued despite a Christian militia's move to appease
neighboring Syria and its Moslem allies in Lebanon by cutting ties with
Israel.
An anonymous caller claiming to represent the Islamic Jihad group
told a Western news agency in Beirut that the fundamentalist extremists
were also responsible for two bomb explosion Saturday in the Saudi
Arabian capital of Riyadh.
The Saudi Interior Ministry said one person was killed and three
wounded when the bombs detonated in garbage trucks on a busy street.
The caller said Islamic Jihad, believed to be loyal to Iran's revolution
ary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, will unleash more attacks
against Saudi Arabia "in order to shake up the retrogressive monarchy."
I lie official Islamic Republic News Agency in Tehran, however,
blamed the bombings on Iran's enemy, Iraq.
Beirut police said the 42-year-old Gemayel was in his hilltop palace in
suburban Baabda, five miles east of the city, when it was raked bv fire
from anti-aircraft guns early yesterday.
A police statement said no tine in the palace was hurt. It was not
known whether the gunfire was aimed at the palace or was a stray burst
from militia in the hills near Baabda.

bomb shelters as shells thudded along the three-mile-long Green Line
that divides Christian East Beirut and the Moslem west side.

Beirut fighting flared April 28.

Christian militia, began withdrawing by boat for the Christian heartland
north of Beirut, according to militia officials who asked not to be named.
I he militia leader, Elie Hobeika, announced the withdrawal Saturday
and said that the Lebanese Forces will close their liaison office in
Jerusalem.
The move appeared intended to distance the Christian command from
its former Israeli ally after Moslem warlords refused to negotiate with
the Christians as long as they were linked to Israel.
Hobeika also called for a "final, comprehensive cease-fire" through
out Lebanon.
