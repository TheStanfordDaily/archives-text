LONDON — South African Foreign Minister
R.F. Botha said yesterday his country can survive
without U.S. investments and American lawmakers
are mistaken if they believe economic sanctions can
punish whites without hurting blacks.
"I cannot for the life of me see whose interests
can he served by disinvestment or boycotting of
South Africa." he said in a British Broadcasting
Corp. worldwide phone-in program.
Answering a question from a California caller.
Botha said: "It is strange to me that some of your
legislators have the idea that you can punish white
South Africans by depriving the blacks of South
Africa of income and jobs and training and of eco
nomic future."
The Reagan administration has come under in
tense pressure in recent months from both
Democrats and Republicans in Congress who want
punitive measures against South Africa's white
minority government to make it change its policy of
apartheid — racial segregation.
Bills before the Senate and House of Represen

tatives would prohibit new U.S. loans to South
Africa, restrict new investments, prohibit computer
sales to the goverment and ban the sale of gold
krugerrands in the United States.
"We can certainly survive without American in
vestment." Botha said, estimating that U.S. invest
ment in South Africa is currently about 23 percent
of all foreign investments.
"But. of course, we would like to attract more
American involvement and investment because it is
in America's interest. Through us. you export to
the rest of Africa." Botha said.
He said 1.5 million blacks from neighboring
countries now working in South Africa would suf
fer most from disinvestment because they would
have to go home if economic sanctions cause large
scale unemployment.
Botha said he could not give a date when the
govermment would start negotiations with blacks
for direct representation in Parliament.
"Our next phase, to which we are giving the
higest priority, is to negotitate, with the black lead
ership in the country, structures ... in which we

can share in devision-making while maintaining the
identity of the particular life of the individual com
munity. at the same time removing discrimination
based on color," he said.
Botha also said the governmment's demand that
black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela abandon
violence before he is freed from prison, where he
has served 21 years of a life sentence, is reasonable.
London's Observer newspaper said yesterday
that Mandela is being victimized for rejecting
Botha's offer of conditional relase three months
ago.
The independent weekly said Mandela told his
wife, Winnie, during a recent visit in Cape Town's
Pollsmoor Prison that he and other imprisoned
leaders of the outlawed African National Congress
have had their lives "made very difficult" since
they rejected the offer.
"He told me that they were being continually
harassed in an indirect way," Winnie Mandela was
quoted as saying. She also said she had been
searched by prison guards for the first time.
