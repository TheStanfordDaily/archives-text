# Florida blazes still uncontained

MIAMI — Must of the Florida
wildfires that burned up to 200
homes and scorched 110,000 acres
were contained yesterday, but an
enormous blaze remained out of con
trol and destroyed at least nine more
dwellings.
"Winds are lower and the humidity
is higher," said Larry Amison, a
spokesman for the state Division of
Forestry. "We are getting more confi
dent — things aren't getting worse."
Even though most of the blazes,
which together made up Florida's
worst outbreak of wildfires, were no
longer spreading, about 90.000 acres

were still burning yesterday, accord
ing to Paul Wills, a spokesman for the
state Division of Forestry.
Fires were concentrated in a 200-
mile stretch of northeast coast from
St. Augustine to Cape Canaveral, and
inward into the Ocala National For
est, one of the largest and most
popular forest campgrounds in the
state.
A 12,000-acre fire that burned
about 200 homes in Palm Coast, in
Flagler County, was contained by
yesterday afternoon. 13ut about 20
miles south, in the Daytona Beach
area, a 28.000-acre brush fire was out

of control yesterday and destroyed
nine homes.
No major region in the state was
free of fires, which were aided by
winds of 10-15 mph in most of the
state. A six-month drought has
parched Florida, making the land
more vulnerable to fire.
The wildfires have been burning off
and on for about a week, but grew to
major proportions early Friday. The
causes of the fires have not been de
termined in most cases, but officials
said arson, lightning and accidents all
probably contributed.
Florida officials said fires in 1981,

another drought year, burned about
the same amount of acreage, but this
year's fires were considered worse
because many populated areas have
been threatened.
"No houses were lost (in 1981) and
not nearly as many people were af
fected." said Wills. This outbreak, he
said, "is destruction without preced
ent in Florida."
"We are not going to get on top of
those fires until we see a lot of rain,"
Wills said.
Light rain fell in some parts of
Florida yesterday, but no major
storms were forecast, according to the
National Weather Service.
