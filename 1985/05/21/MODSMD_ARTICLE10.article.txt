# Hostage release stymied
## Jackson negotiates 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Rev.
Jesse Jackson met yesterday with
relatives of American hostages held
in Lebanon and, though declaring
"we would appeal to and negotiate
with the devil in heir if necessary, he
reported no progress in winning the
hostages' release.
He told a news conference he is
trying to arrange talks with officials in
several Middle East nations, includ
ing Iran, but refused to give details.
To disclose some of those initiatives,
he said, "would not be helpful for the
protection of the hostages."
Jackson offered to meet with rep
resentatives of any Mideast govern
ment or organization that might have
some influence over terrorists holding
the five American captives, probably
in Syrian-controlled Lebanon.
If needed, Jackson said, "We
would appeal to and negotiate with
the devil in hell if hell were burning
and the devil was the only one who
had a fire hose. If he would put the
fire out, we would shake his hand and
leave hell as quickly as possible."
The Chicago civil rights activist and
former contender for the 1984 Dem

ocratic presidential nomination met
privately with relatives of three of the
hostages, plus Sen. Paul Simon (D
-111.) and Rep. Norman Mineta (D-
Calif.).
Among the relatives was Peggy
Say, sister of Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, who was kidnapped
March 16. Also present were
relatives of the Rev. Lawrence Jenco,
a Roman Catholic priest who was
taken captive last Jan. 8, and the Rev.
Benjamin Weir, a Presbyterian mini
ster kidnapped May 8, 1984.
Two years ago, Jackson success
fully negotiated the release of a U.S.
Navy pilot, Lt. Robert Goodman,
who had been shot down over
Lebanon when U.S. peacekeeping
forces were based there.
The other known American captive
is William Buckley, a U.S. diplomat
held since March 16, 1984. A fifth
American, Peter Kilburn, a university
librarian in Beirut, has been missing
since last Nov. 30. The two French
captives are Marcel Fontaine and
Marcel Carton.
