# Westinghouse to clean waste sites
## 
### 
CHICAGO — Westinghouse
Electric Corp. will be required to
clean up six hazardous-waste sites
in Bloomington, Ind., after agree
ing yesterday to a settlement that
federal officials called the largest
since the "superfund" cleanup
program began.
Federal officials estimated the
cost at $75 million to $100 mil
lion, but Westinghouse said it
would be substantially less be
cause it will make money while
burning contaminated material.
The six sites are contaminated
with polychlorinated biphenyls, or
PCBs, which are known to cause
cancer in laboratory animals.
Valdas Adamkus, administrator
of the Midwest regional office of
the Environmental Protection
Agency, said the consent decree,
reached after nine years of litiga
tion at the state and federal levels,
was the first in which a company
agreed to incinerate contaminated
material on its property.
Westinghouse will build a high

temperature incinerator to destroy
the PCB-contaminated material,
rather than simply move it to an
other landfill.
Westinghouse spokesman Paul
Jones said in Pittsburgh that build
ing such an incinerator would
make the net cost of the cleanup
far less than the figures announced
by the government.
Jones said the incinerator would
also process garbage from the
community, and the company
could earn money from selling
steam or electricity generated by
the burning waste.
Four of the six dump sites were
on the EPA's national priority list
for cleanup under the "superfund"
program.
"I think in the early years, there
was not full knowledge of the
amount of contamination, even
though we closed our sewage
treatment plant in 1976," said
Mayor Tomilea Allison of
Bloomington.
