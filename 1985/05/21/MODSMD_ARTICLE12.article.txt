MOVE case assailed
PHILADELPHIA — Activist lawyer William
Kunstler yesterday called the police bombing of
the fortress-home of the radical group MOVE
"an act of murder," and said city officials should
be prosecuted.
An aide to Kunstler, who heads the Center of
Constitutional Rights, said a civil suit was
planned against Mayor Wilson Goode, Police
Commissioner Gregore Sambor and other top
city officials for the bombing of the MOVE
stronghold during an eviction May 13.
Ronald Kuby, the aide, said plaintiffs could in
clude members of the back-to-nature group but
he would not say if anyone had agreed to join the
suit.
Eleven people, including four children, died in
a fire that followed the bomb's detonation and 61
homes were burned in a west Philadelphia neigh
borhood. At least 270 people are homeless.
Police have said the bomb was dropped to
break up a rooftop bunker so they could drop
tear gas inside the MOVE house. Firefighters

were held back for a time because of shots fired
from the house, authorities have said.
"The act of dropping the bomb was an act of
murder, and it must be treated in that light
regardless of the consequences and without com
passion to the victims," Kunstler said.
Kunstler's recorded remarks were played at a
news conference called by local black civil rights
activists critical of Goode's handling of the police
assault.
He said city officials "had written the members
of MOVE out of the human race the way Hitler
did the Jews more than 40 years ago in Ger
many,"
Three calls to Goode's press office for com
ment were not immediately returned yesterday
afternoon.
U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese said yes
terday he did not have enough information to
criticize or praise the Philadelphia police for the
bombing.
Meese said he did not anticipate any Justice
Department investigation of the incident, be
cause "I've heard of no allegations of civil rights

violations, which is what would normally involve
us."
In an interview published yesterday, fire com
missioner William Richmond defended the deci
sion to let the fire burn after the bomb was
dropped so it would consume a rooftop bunker
that MOVE had built. He said again he would
not expose his firefighters to bullets fired from
the MOVE fortress.
