SACRAMENTO — Children who testify
against defendants accused of sexual molestation
would be allowed to give their testimony outside
the courtroom via closed-circuit television, under
a bill signed into law yesterday by Gov. George
Deukmejian.
The measure, long supported by prosecutors
but opposed by constitutional rights groups, was
prompted by the Virginian McMartin Preschool
case in Manhattan Beach, in which seven former
teachers of the care center have been accused of
208 counts of molestation against 41 children.
The author of the bill. Sen. Art Torres (D-Los
Angeles), has said his measure will protect
children from the psychological harm of being
forced to personally confront and testify against
adults in open court.
Deukmejian said the measure, an urgency
statute which goes into effect immediately, will

"help ease the trauma to some children who face
having to reopen the terrible memories of sexual
abuse in a court of law."
The bill allows children 10-years-old or
younger to offer testimony through a two-way
television hookup outside the courtroom — but
only if the court finds that the child or a member
of the child's family has been threatened in an at
tempt to prevent the testimony, or that the
defendant's presence greatly hinders the child's
testimony.
Supporters of the measure, 5846, contend the
new law will protect youngsters from personally
facing bullying defense lawyers, but critics, in
cluding the American Civil Liberties Union, said
the measure conflicts with the right of the
accused to face an accuser.
In his message announcing the signing of
5846, Deukmejian said he was "satisfied that
great care was taken to sensitively and legally
'-•dance the conflicting interests of providing a

more comfortable setting for a child's testimony
with a defendant's constitutional right to con
front his or her accuser."
Torres' original bill, introduced last December,
applied to 14-year-olds, and would have allowed
a court to order the television testimony if the
judge ruled that in-court questioning would have
proven psychologically harmful to the child.
However, the earlier measure was changed in
order to obtain approval of a key committee in
the Legislature, the Assembly Public Safety
Committee.
Today's weather
This morning low clouds and fog. Otherwise
mostly stinny and warmer. Highs around 85.
Lows in the 40s to mid 50s. Tomorrow morning
low clouds, with highs in the mid 80s.
