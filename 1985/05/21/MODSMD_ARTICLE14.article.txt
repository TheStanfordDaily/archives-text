## Packard's billion and serving ham on the Dish 
### 
1 have been issued a challenge.
Only, I think I've already failed.
Chris Krankin of Donner mailed in
four questions and asked a fifth
"Will you be able to answer all these
questions before your next
deadline?" The only problem was
that, according to the date on the let
ter, three deadlines had already
passed.
So I guess the answer to the last
question is no, even though it did take
me only one afternoon to do the re
search once I started.
They're all good questions, so I'll
print them in spite of the embarrass
ment.
Dear Bug Me,
Is it true that David Packard has be
queathed $1 billion to Stanford in his
will?
This is a touchy question because
David Packard (I assume you mean
the one connected with Hewlett-
Packard Co. and a former member
and chairman of the Board of Trus
tees) is still alive.

Until a person dies, they're the
only one who will tell you what's in
their will.
For example, Packard's lawyer
with the University said that he had
no knowledge of the sum, that in no
way could he tell me if he did, and
that it was very confidential, at which
point I felt very nosy and embar
rassed.
I did call Packard's office, but he
was out of town, so I talked to his sec
retary, who suggested that I not even
print the question.
This is what secretaries generally
say, though. I think they must be
taught in secretary school not to an
swer Bug Me questions about their
bosses, which is perfectly legitimate,
considering that I don't pay as well as
the average boss.
So I'm printing the question, but
I'm not printing an answer, except for
the rest of what Packard's secretary
did say to me.
"I know what he'd say, but I won't
repeat it," she said with a small
chuckle. Secretaries are either very
proper or slightly sadistic. I'm not
sure which.
"I don't think he'd really look
kindly on that question," she said

before hanging up. I took that to
mean that he would either feel guilty
because he's giving less than a billion
dollars to Stanford (certainly one of
the more dastardly sins an alum could
commit) or he would just think it's a
rude question, or maybe a little of
both.
Is the Dish for sale? What is the ask
ing price?
No, according to Bob Leonard,
director of the radio physics lab at'
SRI International, which
built the 150-foot radio astronomy
telescope in conjunction with the
University in the late 19605. It is not
for sale.
Of course, if you were a recipient in
David Packard's will, maybe some
thing could be arranged. I don't
know.
The Dish cost half a million dollars
when it was built and it has two twins,
one built in Scotland which has since
been moved to Germany, and one on
the East Coast.
There are lots of smaller dishes up
in the hills ranging in size from 60
feet to 16 inches.
Contrary to popular opinion, the
Dish is not dead, it's just not in use.
According to Leonard, it can be
turned on easily enough if there's any
reason to do so.
In 1982, it was resuscitated to save
a ham radio satellite that was jam
ming itself. Such satellites take
thousands of ham radio operator
hours to build, according to Leonard,
so it was a nice-guy kind of thing for
the Dish to do.
He also said that it really doesn't
have much value anymore, except for
in emergencies like that and in being
a point of reference for lost joggers.
Otherwise, it's not very useful be
cause of all the houses that have been
built around it. All those Osterizers
and Hoovers and Maytags tend to in
terfere.
About every five years, people
start asking SRI questions about the
Dish, like whether it's radioactive or
whether it's part of national defense.
Actually, I think it's a nice decora
tion, if you're into big cobwebs. Good
luck getting it into your room if you
do buy it.
What was Leland Stanford, Jr. 's
original Christian name?
I don't know whether this name is
very original, but little Leland was
christened Leland De Witt Stanford.
The middle part was the name of
one of his father's brothers, but this
uncle shall remain little known be
cause, when he was 12 years old, our
namesake asked to have his name
changed to his father's so he could be
a junior.

How does that sound? Leland De
Witt Stanford (pause) University
Marching Band or maybe The De
Witt Daily.
No, give little Leland credit for
having a good ear.
What is the value of all the Univer
sity's real estate? How much did it pay
in property taxes for last year?
1 don't know. But then, the people
who are supposed to know things like
that don't know, either.
I called a place of business in Palo
Alto that answers to the name, Stan
ford Investments, and completely
befuddled another secretary.
Please don't write me mad letters,
secretaries. I really like your profes
sion and get most of my answers from
people in it, or at least they know
whom I should call, which is
sometimes more important.
However, whoever it was who an
swered the phone at Stanford Invest

ments each of the several times 1
called alternated between thinking
that it would be impossible to find
that information in their files or that
she could possibly, given a week, dig
up some number with which to get me
out of her hair.
If you think back, however, to the
propaganda pamphlets the University
sent you when you were trying to gain
the privilege of paying tuition here,
the campus was described as 8,000
acres of rolling hills and Spanish-style
buildings dotted with bronzed, care
free students.
Now, if you figure that each acre
the University owns could, with a
small stretch of the imagination, bring
in lots of money in rent, then multiply
lots by 8,000, you've got just about
the right number.
Remember last week's number for
the weight of the world? Well, it's in
that range, as close as I can figure.
Of course, I should probably men

tion that I mislabeled that number
pounds when it should have been
kilograms, and that I claim all the
rights of a die-hard fuzzie to make
mistakes with scientific notation and
other forms of hieroglyphics.
I'm also told that a number in
kilograms denotes mass, not weight,
but I'm too confused to straighten it
out, and if you understand the prob
lem I'm talking about you probably
already know the answer, anyway.
I'm sure The Daily regrets the er
ror as much as I do, which is quite a
bit. But if you just get last Tuesday's
paper and write a dollar sign at the
front of that number, then you'll have
something roughly approximating the
answer to this question.
We should all remember to con
serve paper whenever possible.
In other words, I should probably
get on with this question and tell you
that according to Jack Dempsey of
the President's Office, there is very

little property tax paid on this very
big number.
Who are the closest living relatives
of Senator and Mrs. Stanford (i.e.,
descendants of their siblings)? A re any
of these people currently affiliated
with the University? - Ben Martin
Actually, there aren't a lot of close
relatives of the Stanfords, dead or
alive, because their only child, the
famed Leland Stanford, Jr., died at
the age of 15 years, 10 months.
According to University Archives,
there is a great-great-great nephew or
something living in California, but no
relatives were related to the Univer
sity right now.
The Stanfords took care of the pos
sibility of nepotism by declaring that
no relatives should be given prefer
ence in admission or scholarships.
No wonder there are no modern
Stanfords wandering around.
