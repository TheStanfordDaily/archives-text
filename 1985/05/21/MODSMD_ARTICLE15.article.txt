## THE 						STANFORD DAILY A 						wise proposal 
### 
It is sad to admit, but the diehard protesters of
the University's investments in companies that do
business in South Africa have been pounding
against a stone wall.
The Board of Trustees made it clear last week
that, for the time being, total divestment is out of
the question. The members of Stanford Out of
South Africa can rant and rave until Stanford
celebrates its bicentennial, but the trustees likely
will not change their decision.
Thus, compromise seems to be a pragmatic av
enue lo take, and that is what student members of
the Commission on Investment Responsibility
are proposing to the C-IR and the Board of Trus
tees.
Essentially, there are two crucial points to the
four-pronged proposal. The first calls for a staff
group to determine during the summer whether
the companies in which Stanford invests abide by
a set of guidelines. The guidelines include opposi
tion to the influx control laws, support of and
compliance with the Sullivan Principles (as well
as the achievement of a minimum rating by those
standards), no sales to the South African govern
ment, a policy of no loans to the government, and
disclosure of information pertaining to the
preceding criteria.

By October, a dialogue with the companies
that don't meet these guidelines would be in
itiated and a moratorium would be placed on fur
ther investments in these companies. By January,
the University would divest of any companies
that did not abide by the guidelines.
The second point states that if by October 1,
1987, "fundamental changes have not been made
to dismantle the Group Areas Act and other in
flux control laws, the University will make a final
appeal towards the removal of operations from
South Africa by companies in which it has shares.
If this plea is unsuccessful, the University will
divest these securities" by December, 1987. This
would apply to companies regardless of whether
they followed the aforementioned guidelines.
There are, admittedly, some loopholes to this
proposal. It is filled with some rather ill-defined
and unspecific language. The expression
"fundamental changes" could easily be mis
construed or redefined.
But the proposal is a responsible attempt at
compromise. It includes the demand for total
divestment and the pragmatism of a two-year ex
amination period. With improvement, it can be
something the trustees cannot dismiss as ir
responsible.
