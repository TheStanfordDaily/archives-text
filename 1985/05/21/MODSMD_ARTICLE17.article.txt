## The 						Israel-South Africa link 
### 
As much as Israel's friends would like it, the long
standing, well-developed alliance between Israel and
South Africa and the parallels between apartheid and in
stitutionalized racism in Israel cannot be ignored. The
issue was brought into sharp relief recently when speakers
at a rally commemorating the creation of Israel urged

VIEWPOINT

their audience to join students, faculty and staff to protest
Stanford's investments in companies that profit from
South African apartheid. Only on the basis of sheer
hypocrisy and opportunism can one simultaneously
celebrate the "moral rectitude" of the "Middle East's
only democracy" and condemn engagement with the
racist policies of South Africa's white minority.
Israel is the only country to invest economically in the
so-called tribal homelands created by the South African
regime to fragment the black labor force, divide workers
from their families and accommodate those unable to toil
in South African mines and industries. Bophuthatswana
and Ciskei, formally recognized only by South Africa,
have accredited representatives in Israel, Ciskei opened a
trade mission in Tel Aviv in 1982 and 10 Israeli factories
are under construction there. In 1983 the puppet regime
in Ciskei purchased aircraft from Israel, where Ciskei
pilots have been trained. These exchanges strengthen the
hands of those who benefit from South Africa's effort to
divide and rule the majority black population.
Israel maintains strong military ties to the apartheid
regime even though it is a signatory to the 1977 United
Nations ban on military sales to South Africa. The conser
vative British weekly. The Economist, reported in 1981
that 200 Israeli military advisers were teaching "anti
terrorist" tactics to South African forces. It is estimated
that between 1970 and 1979, 35 percent of Israel's mili
tary exports went to South Africa.
Israeli-South African trade relations are no less cozy.
The reported value of Israeli-South African trade in
creased from $9 million in 1968 to $250 million in 1984.
More important, Israel acts as a conduit for half-finished
South African goods which are re-exported to Europe and
the United States. Former Israeli Finance Minister Simha
Ehrlich said Israel would serve "as a convenient way sta
tion for South African products which would be exported
first to Israel and then re-exported to the United States
and Common Market countries, avoiding higher taxes and
political boycotts to the benefit of both countries." Under
the provisions of the unprecedented free trade agreement
signed this week between Israel and the United States,
South Africa may receive preferential trade treatment via
Israel.
Israel and South Africa have drawn closer together as
they feel themselves increasingly isolated in the interna
tional community. Third World governments have consis
tently expressed their resistance to apartheid and Israeli
racism in the United Nations. Defenders of Israel, like

their South African counterparts, argue that they are sub
jected to a double standard, that they are not judged in
the context of the Arab world or the rest of the African
continent. (See David Barrett's viewpoint, "In defense of
context and Israel," The Daily, April 23.) Apologists for
Israel and South Africa refuse to recognize that in the
context of the colonial legacy, both are perceived as
manifestations of settler colonialism and as such as out
posts of Western economic and political encroachment on
the peoples of Africa and Asia. The regional destabiliza
tion engendered by both, particularly South African in
cursions into Lesotho, Angola and Mozambique, and
Israeli intervention in Lebanon, only confirms this per
ception.
Apartheid is unabashedly racist in form and content.
Zionist racism is better concealed, but in important
respects no less institutionalized. Since the banning of the
al-Ard movement in 1964, Palestinians inside Israel have
had to content themselves with officially approved politi
cal parties. Any public display of the four colors of the
Palestinian flag is punishable by law. The Law of Return
grants any Jew anywhere the right to citizenship by virtue
of being Jewish. Palestinians, 700.000 of whom were for-i
cibly expelled'from their homes in 1948, are not permit
ted to return. Non-Jews are effectively excluded from use
of 90 percent of the land area within the pre-1967 borders
of Israel. Those Palestinians who remain in Israel but have
lost land to Israeli confiscations are known in the Orwel
lian language of such arrangements as "absent-presents."
There is no civil marriage or divorce in Israel so that inter
marriage between Muslims, Christians and Jews has no le
gal basis.
In the occupied territories, Israeli settlers come under
the jurisdiction of Israeli civil courts; Palestinians are sub
ject to military tribunals. Israeli settlements are connected
by infrastructures which deliberately avoid Palestinian
population centers: separate roads and electricity grids for
Jews and Arabs. Palestinian mobility is carefully con
trolled by coded identification cards and color-coded
license plates. More than 50 percent of the West Bank has
been declared state land, forcing farmers to seek wage
labor in Israeli industry. One-third of the Palestinian
labor force in the West Bank and Gaza commutes daily to
Israel, primarily as unskilled labor in the Israeli construc
tion trade and services sector. They are not covered by
trade union agreements or the national insurance system
and are prohibited by law from spending the night in Is
rael.
Those of us who consider divestment part of the
struggle against apartheid must not lose sight of the inter
national context of support for the South African system.
Uncritical American support of Israel, the largest
recipient of U.S. military and economic aid, plays a signif
icant role in the survival of the minority white regime in
South Africa and in the racist underpinnings of Israeli
policy toward the Palestinians.

marriage between Muslims, Christians and Jews has no le
gal basis.
In the occupied territories, Israeli settlers come under
the jurisdiction of Israeli civil courts; Palestinians are sub
ject to military tribunals. Israeli settlements are connected
by infrastructures which deliberately avoid Palestinian
population centers: separate roads and electricity grids for
Jews and Arabs. Palestinian mobility is carefully con
trolled by coded identification cards and color-coded
license plates. More than 50 percent of the West Bank has
been declared state land, forcing farmers to seek wage
labor in Israeli industry. One-third of the Palestinian
labor force in the West Bank and Gaza commutes daily to
Israel, primarily as unskilled labor in the Israeli construc
tion trade and services sector. They are not covered by
trade union agreements or the national insurance system
and are prohibited by law from spending the night in Is
rael.
Those of us who consider divestment part of the
struggle against apartheid must not lose sight of the inter
national context of support for the South African system.
Uncritical American support of Israel, the largest
recipient of U.S. military and economic aid, plays a signif
icant role in the survival of the minority white regime in
South Africa and in the racist underpinnings of Israeli
policy toward the Palestinians.

As much as Israel's friends would like it, the long
standing, well-developed alliance between Israel and
South Africa and the parallels between apartheid and in
stitutionalized racism in Israel cannot be ignored. The
issue was brought into sharp relief recently when speakers
at a rally commemorating the creation of Israel urged

VIEWPOINT

their audience to join students, faculty and staff to protest
Stanford's investments in companies that profit from
South African apartheid. Only on the basis of sheer
hypocrisy and opportunism can one simultaneously
celebrate the "moral rectitude" of the "Middle East's
only democracy" and condemn engagement with the
racist policies of South Africa's white minority.
Israel is the only country to invest economically in the
so-called tribal homelands created by the South African
regime to fragment the black labor force, divide workers
from their families and accommodate those unable to toil
in South African mines and industries. Bophuthatswana
and Ciskei, formally recognized only by South Africa,
have accredited representatives in Israel, Ciskei opened a
trade mission in Tel Aviv in 1982 and 10 Israeli factories
are under construction there. In 1983 the puppet regime
in Ciskei purchased aircraft from Israel, where Ciskei
pilots have been trained. These exchanges strengthen the
hands of those who benefit from South Africa's effort to
divide and rule the majority black population.
Israel maintains strong military ties to the apartheid
regime even though it is a signatory to the 1977 United
Nations ban on military sales to South Africa. The conser
vative British weekly. The Economist, reported in 1981
that 200 Israeli military advisers were teaching "anti
terrorist" tactics to South African forces. It is estimated
that between 1970 and 1979, 35 percent of Israel's mili
tary exports went to South Africa.
Israeli-South African trade relations are no less cozy.
The reported value of Israeli-South African trade in
creased from $9 million in 1968 to $250 million in 1984.
More important, Israel acts as a conduit for half-finished
South African goods which are re-exported to Europe and
the United States. Former Israeli Finance Minister Simha
Ehrlich said Israel would serve "as a convenient way sta
tion for South African products which would be exported
first to Israel and then re-exported to the United States
and Common Market countries, avoiding higher taxes and
political boycotts to the benefit of both countries." Under
the provisions of the unprecedented free trade agreement
signed this week between Israel and the United States,
South Africa may receive preferential trade treatment via
Israel.
Israel and South Africa have drawn closer together as
they feel themselves increasingly isolated in the interna
tional community. Third World governments have consis
tently expressed their resistance to apartheid and Israeli
racism in the United Nations. Defenders of Israel, like

their South African counterparts, argue that they are sub
jected to a double standard, that they are not judged in
the context of the Arab world or the rest of the African
continent. (See David Barrett's viewpoint, "In defense of
context and Israel," The Daily, April 23.) Apologists for
Israel and South Africa refuse to recognize that in the
context of the colonial legacy, both are perceived as
manifestations of settler colonialism and as such as out
posts of Western economic and political encroachment on
the peoples of Africa and Asia. The regional destabiliza
tion engendered by both, particularly South African in
cursions into Lesotho, Angola and Mozambique, and
Israeli intervention in Lebanon, only confirms this per
ception.
Apartheid is unabashedly racist in form and content.
Zionist racism is better concealed, but in important
respects no less institutionalized. Since the banning of the
al-Ard movement in 1964, Palestinians inside Israel have
had to content themselves with officially approved politi
cal parties. Any public display of the four colors of the
Palestinian flag is punishable by law. The Law of Return
grants any Jew anywhere the right to citizenship by virtue
of being Jewish. Palestinians, 700.000 of whom were for-i
cibly expelled'from their homes in 1948, are not permit
ted to return. Non-Jews are effectively excluded from use
of 90 percent of the land area within the pre-1967 borders
of Israel. Those Palestinians who remain in Israel but have
lost land to Israeli confiscations are known in the Orwel
lian language of such arrangements as "absent-presents."
There is no civil marriage or divorce in Israel so that inter
marriage between Muslims, Christians and Jews has no le
gal basis.
In the occupied territories, Israeli settlers come under
