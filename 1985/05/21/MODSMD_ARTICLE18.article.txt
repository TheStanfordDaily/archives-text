Libel over election
Once again, a self-interested
miscreant and The Stanford Daily
have teamed up to libel the ASSU
Senate. I refer to Ashwin Adarkar's
letter titled "Election bungling,"
(The Daily, May 15).
First, let me point out that the
senate doesn't even conduct elec
tions; an independently appointed
elections commission conducts them.
This commission ran the senior class
runoff without flaw, exactly as it has
been run in the past. Someone in the
The Stanford Daily's advertisement
department bungled the election by
copying a date incorrectly. Oops.
This error may have kept
hundreds of juniors from voting, but
Adarkar says that we should ignore
the error anyway because he thinks
that "any possible effect would be
evenly distributed between the two
slates." Deciding the election by a
coin flip would also have an even
effect on the two slates and would
cost less than a dollar (depending on
the coin); would Adarkar recom
mend that we abandon elections in
favor of randomness? Neither
Adarkar nor anyone else can pos
sibly know how those dis
enfranchised juniors will vote until
he sees the results of the new runoff.
Adarkar claims that the new elec
tion costs $1,200. In fact, the total
cost of the on-campus polling is $300
or $550, depending on whether The
Daily gives us one free ad or two. In
any case, it seems surprising that a
junior would complain that the
entire student body is spending
money for the sole benefit of his
class. Rather, I would expect him to
say, "Thank you."
Adarkar's gripes are a replay of
arguments that Slate of Mind candi
date Steve Smith made to the Rules
Committee and to the senate before
the senate's decision to call a new
election. The other members of the
rules committee and myself spent
an hour considering our decision. We
realized that, no matter what choice
we made, some self-interested tard
might go crying to The Stanford
Daily. A majority of us are graduate
students; we agreed that who

becomes senior class presidents
makes very little difference to us.
However, the new election costs us
money. If we had voted out of self
interest then we would have been
happy to let the election be decided
by a coin flip. However, since the
senate had already agreed to take
final responsibility for the election,
we agreed unanimously that we had
an overriding responsibility to ensure
that the election was run properly.
Let me cite a similar situation
(Mathematics Magazine, November
1981). In a 1976 Maine House of
Representatives election, the Repub
lican defeated the Democrat by 133
votes. After the result was an
nounced, 208 of the votes were
determined to be invalid and the
Democrat asked for a new election.
A mathematics department chairman
determined the probability of rever
sal to be infinitesimal and so tes
tified. However, the election
commission ordered a new election.
A political science professor on the
commission wrote," 'Common
sense' indicates that 208 votes could
affect the outcome of a contest in
volving a margin of only 133 votes."
So a new election was held. And the
second time the Democrat won.
Since we are talking about only a
six-vote margin this time, the possi
bility of reversal is hardly insignifi
cant. It is this possibility that so
upsets Adarkar. Adarkar neglects to
mention in his letter that he and
candidate Smith are both Phi Delts.
Smith's slate won the last election.
Adarkar's concern is due to the fear
that this time, in a properly con
ducted election, Smith might lose.
May the most popular slate win.
That's why we have elections.

Misrepresenting fun
I would like to correct some facts
and perhaps perceptions about the
book, "Europe: Where The Fun Is."
First, neither Rollin Riggs nor I are
ex-Stanfordites. I am currently a
student here, while Rollin has never
been west of the Mississippi.

Second, the book was mostly
written by women; if your reviewer
had looked at the credits, she would
note that the majority of the work
was done by women. Rollin and I
merely edited the chapters, and the
writers had the final word. I also
could mention that the cover design
er (duly credited), our agent and
lawyer are all women. For all her
cries of sexism, all the quotes she
cites are generic, e.g. "blonds," not
male or female.
More important. Rollin and 1
never suggest that anyone should
avoid the cultural sites of Europe.
We do know, however, that there are
dozens and dozens of books that
cover these topics. We not only left
out essentials like cultural sites but
also hotels, American Express
offices, etc. Clearly, our book is
intended to supplement the existing
books, not replace them. It says so in
the book.
Your reviewer makes much of the
fact that we mention prostitution and
drugs. To put it mildly, she is being
sensationalistic. These references are
almost entirely limited to one city,
Amsterdam, and anyone who has
been to Amsterdam knows that these
are fairly obvious activities there. We
discuss the symphony and coffee
houses of Vienna, the theater in
London, backpacking in Norway,
canal-boat cruising in France,
beaches in Portugal and so forth.
We do suggest, however, that the
reader get off the beaten track. For
example, there are few things less
French than Versailles in August.
There is more to Paris than the
Louvre and Notre Dame; just as
important, there are the Parisians
themselves. Bars, restaurants and
night clubs are some of the better
places to meet them.
So, if your reviewer has a long, hot
day at the Louvre and is tired of
being pushed by fellow tourists,
perhaps she'll take a look at our
book, find a quiet French restaurant
and a friendly jazz bar, and even
consider taking a look at our
itinerary for a hike through the Swiss
Alps.

sibly know how those dis
enfranchised juniors will vote until
he sees the results of the new runoff.
Adarkar claims that the new elec
tion costs $1,200. In fact, the total
cost of the on-campus polling is $300
or $550, depending on whether The
Daily gives us one free ad or two. In
any case, it seems surprising that a
junior would complain that the
entire student body is spending
money for the sole benefit of his
class. Rather, I would expect him to
say, "Thank you."
Adarkar's gripes are a replay of
arguments that Slate of Mind candi
date Steve Smith made to the Rules
Committee and to the senate before
the senate's decision to call a new
election. The other members of the
rules committee and myself spent
an hour considering our decision. We
realized that, no matter what choice
we made, some self-interested tard
might go crying to The Stanford
Daily. A majority of us are graduate
students; we agreed that who

becomes senior class presidents
makes very little difference to us.
However, the new election costs us
money. If we had voted out of self
interest then we would have been
happy to let the election be decided
by a coin flip. However, since the
senate had already agreed to take
final responsibility for the election,
we agreed unanimously that we had
an overriding responsibility to ensure
that the election was run properly.
Let me cite a similar situation
(Mathematics Magazine, November
1981). In a 1976 Maine House of
Representatives election, the Repub
lican defeated the Democrat by 133
votes. After the result was an
nounced, 208 of the votes were
determined to be invalid and the
Democrat asked for a new election.
A mathematics department chairman
determined the probability of rever
sal to be infinitesimal and so tes
tified. However, the election
commission ordered a new election.
A political science professor on the
commission wrote," 'Common
sense' indicates that 208 votes could
affect the outcome of a contest in
volving a margin of only 133 votes."
So a new election was held. And the
second time the Democrat won.
Since we are talking about only a
six-vote margin this time, the possi
bility of reversal is hardly insignifi
cant. It is this possibility that so
upsets Adarkar. Adarkar neglects to
mention in his letter that he and
candidate Smith are both Phi Delts.
Smith's slate won the last election.
Adarkar's concern is due to the fear
that this time, in a properly con
ducted election, Smith might lose.
May the most popular slate win.
That's why we have elections.

Misrepresenting fun
I would like to correct some facts
and perhaps perceptions about the
book, "Europe: Where The Fun Is."
First, neither Rollin Riggs nor I are
ex-Stanfordites. I am currently a
student here, while Rollin has never
been west of the Mississippi.

Second, the book was mostly
written by women; if your reviewer
had looked at the credits, she would
note that the majority of the work
was done by women. Rollin and I
merely edited the chapters, and the
writers had the final word. I also
could mention that the cover design
er (duly credited), our agent and
lawyer are all women. For all her
cries of sexism, all the quotes she
cites are generic, e.g. "blonds," not
male or female.
More important. Rollin and 1
never suggest that anyone should
avoid the cultural sites of Europe.
We do know, however, that there are
dozens and dozens of books that
cover these topics. We not only left
out essentials like cultural sites but
also hotels, American Express
offices, etc. Clearly, our book is
intended to supplement the existing
books, not replace them. It says so in
the book.
Your reviewer makes much of the
fact that we mention prostitution and
drugs. To put it mildly, she is being
sensationalistic. These references are
almost entirely limited to one city,
Amsterdam, and anyone who has
been to Amsterdam knows that these
are fairly obvious activities there. We
discuss the symphony and coffee
houses of Vienna, the theater in
London, backpacking in Norway,
canal-boat cruising in France,
beaches in Portugal and so forth.
We do suggest, however, that the
reader get off the beaten track. For
example, there are few things less
French than Versailles in August.
There is more to Paris than the
Louvre and Notre Dame; just as
important, there are the Parisians
themselves. Bars, restaurants and
night clubs are some of the better
places to meet them.
So, if your reviewer has a long, hot
day at the Louvre and is tired of
being pushed by fellow tourists,
perhaps she'll take a look at our
book, find a quiet French restaurant
and a friendly jazz bar, and even
consider taking a look at our
itinerary for a hike through the Swiss
Alps.

Libel over election
Once again, a self-interested
miscreant and The Stanford Daily
have teamed up to libel the ASSU
Senate. I refer to Ashwin Adarkar's
letter titled "Election bungling,"
(The Daily, May 15).
First, let me point out that the
senate doesn't even conduct elec
tions; an independently appointed
elections commission conducts them.
This commission ran the senior class
runoff without flaw, exactly as it has
been run in the past. Someone in the
The Stanford Daily's advertisement
department bungled the election by
copying a date incorrectly. Oops.
This error may have kept
hundreds of juniors from voting, but
Adarkar says that we should ignore
the error anyway because he thinks
that "any possible effect would be
evenly distributed between the two
slates." Deciding the election by a
coin flip would also have an even
effect on the two slates and would
cost less than a dollar (depending on
the coin); would Adarkar recom
mend that we abandon elections in
favor of randomness? Neither
Adarkar nor anyone else can pos
sibly know how those dis
enfranchised juniors will vote until
he sees the results of the new runoff.
Adarkar claims that the new elec
tion costs $1,200. In fact, the total
cost of the on-campus polling is $300
or $550, depending on whether The
Daily gives us one free ad or two. In
any case, it seems surprising that a
