# Summer is the time to live like dogs
## 
### 
1 watched "The Tonight Show" when 1 was home
a couple of weeks ago, and David Letterman
showed an old video clip of "dog poetry" he
originally aired on his own show. It was called
"Summer" and showed a German shepherd-mix
panting, roaming and whining with lyrics under
neath. I'd like to share some of my favorite lines
from the poem:
(lying down, panting)
A day so hot that
The fleas on my hack . . .
A re sweating.
(one of his asides)
excuse me a moment. . .
SQUIRRELS!!!!
(JET OUT OF HERE!!!
I HATE YOU!
I'M SERIOUS!!.'!
(later, at his dog dish)
My empty dish mocks me.
Will the folks with the food
Never come home?
I recite these excerpts now because with the
coming of summer, the importance of dogs cannot
be underestimated. When most Stanford people
think of summer, they think of beaches, good, non
commital sex and internships. I also think of those
things, but if I had to describe what summer is, in
one word, I would say dogs, without a question.
Dogs best epitomize the meaning of summer be
cause the> are the one species who live it all year
round. You find them dripping wet by your door
during a rain or snow storm because they're forever
convinced that it must be 100 degrees outside.

They don't worry about their next meal or the pos
sibility of nuclear war because as long as there's a
trash can nearby, they search for bones.

In order to understand the extraordinary phe
nomenon of the dog. an examination of a represen
tative dog day must be recorded. An average dog
day resembles the following: wake up late, run
around in circles awhile; drink some water, usually
out of a gutter or toilet seat; sleep in sun most of
the afternoon; go on daily mission (if he runs into
his owner during the daily quest, he'll lick his hand
and trot off on his way — "Must leave; need to
overturn garbage"); finds styrofoam cup or
whatever he was searching for; eat; find his pack to
roam around with for the evening; bark a lot and
torment all the dogs that have been locked in for
the night ("We're having the time of our life
chasing cars and you're locked up? Hah!"); go back
to sleep and dream of other dogs and cowbones.
The representative dog day should, along with
the "dog poetry," exemplify the summer essence of
dogs; however, in case some people are still not
convinced by these descriptions, I will give a true
to-life example proving the above point. The last
day of my weekend at home it was hot and sunny.

and my two dogs, Really, who is a dalmatian (he
once had a sister named Truly), and Oh Mighty
Isis, who is a spitz, were lying in the grass. It looked
like they were unoccupied, so I threw a tennis ball
for them to fetch, since it seemed like a good thing
to do. Really watched the ball fall, but then he
rolled over and grunted — "Sorry, I'm busy. Gotta
sleep now." Isis, on the other hand, chased the ball
somewhat belatedly, and she even carried it
halfway back to me. But then she dropped the ball
and trotted off in another direction. No doubt she
had something more important to do, like dig.
After all this recent observation on my part, it is
obvious to me that there's a dearth of dogs at Stan
ford. Countless students tell me that they're "wild"
and "love to party," but if more dogs roamed
around this school, I believe there would be a lot
less talk and a lot more damage. Also more Food
Service food would be eaten, and all true grinds
would be tormented to death by emotional distress.
Consequently, I now believe that the DUs get such
bad press in The Daily because, in actuality, they
are a pack of dogs. They stole the pizza because it
was time to eat. And the broken pipe? It was going
to get fixed.
Therefore, the point of my final column for the
school year is not to conjecture whether Chris Caen
was a dog in his last life, or why the lump of blind
black-furred flesh that lies in the corner of Daily
photographer Jill Gilbert's Los Angeles home has
lived 10 years longer than it should have, although
these arc two very compelling questions in their
own right. The point of this column is that summer
is in less than a month, and it's time to live like
dogs, at least for a little while. That's my mission.

school year is not to conjecture whether Chris Caen
was a dog in his last life, or why the lump of blind
black-furred flesh that lies in the corner of Daily
photographer Jill Gilbert's Los Angeles home has
lived 10 years longer than it should have, although
these arc two very compelling questions in their
own right. The point of this column is that summer
is in less than a month, and it's time to live like
dogs, at least for a little while. That's my mission.

American studies. Thus is her final column.)
