# Students propose C-IR change
## Plan to strengthen University divestment guidelines 
### SANDRA BODOVITZ 
A proposal issued yesterday aims at strengthen
ing University divestment guidelines by setting an
October 1987 deadline for divestment from com
panies doing business in South Africa unless at
tempts "to dismantle the Group Areas act and
other influx control laws" are made by that
country's government.
The proposal, co-authored by four students on
University committees, calls for changes in the
charter of the Commission on Investment Respon
sibility (C-IR), including the appointment of three
full-time staff people to research the University's
investments, criteria and a timetable for divest
ment, and a change in the C-IR's voting
procedures.
Guidelines for companies operating in South
Africa are enumerated and include "opposition to
the influx control laws as recommended by the
Tutu principles, along with frequent and sustained
lobbying of the South African government against
influx control and apartheid" and support of the
Sullivan Principles. "No sales to the South
African government and its security apparatus . . .
no loans to the South African government . . .
(and) disclosure of information pertaining to the
preceding criteria" are also required.
The proposal also calls for the University to
"vote in favor of cogent shareholder resolutions
which support these guidelines."
A specific timetable for divestment is set for
companies that fail to follow the stated guidelines.
"If by October 1, 1987, fundamental changes have
not been made to dismantle influx controls,- the
University will make a final appeal towards the
removal of operations from South Africa by com

panies in which it has shares. If this plea is un
successful, the University will divest these securi
ties by December 1987."
The proposal encourages the University to work
with other colleges and universities to increase
"leverage on corporations and U.S. policymakers."
The change in the voting membership rules of
the C-IR from "two thirds of the entire voting
membership of the C-IR" to "a majority of mem
bers of the C-IR who vote on that recommenda
tion" is necessary because of the poor attendance
at many meetings, according to Mark Landesmann,
a C-IR member and a co-author of the proposal.
C-IR members Margaret Miller and Robert
Schechter, along with Walter Geys, a member of
the Committee on Investments, also worked on the
proposal.
"This is an interim compromise. It's a take-what
you-can-get proposal," Landesmann said. The Oc
tober 1, 1987 deadline that the students adopted
has been "suggested by (University President)
Donald Kennedy," Landesmann said. "We're actu
ally turning it into a concrete proposal."
Landesmann called the deadline "totally
feasible."
Geys agrees. "The two-year time span is very
feasible. Tutu talked about it. Even Kennedy is
more .and more supportive." Geys added, "If two
years becomes a political fact in the United States,
then by 1987, stockholders may feel uncomfortable
still holding stock in certain companies."
Landesmann stressed that the proposal is only a
short-term solution. "It's important for [Students
Out of South Afri&it arid the students not to give
up the demand for total divestment," he said.
Bill Cohn, a SOSA member, agreed. "I

appreciate any effort being made to change Stan
ford's divestment policy. I support what they're
trying to do. But it's still important for SOSA to
push for total divestment."
The proposal was issued to the C-IR members at
their regular meeting yesterday at the same time it
was released to the public. "We were not happy
that they were presented to us at the same time as
they were presented to The Daily and others on
campus," said Kent Kaiser, an alumni member of
the C-IR.
"What the proposal basically amounts to is a
change in the charge of the C-IR. and the Board of
Trustees will have to make that change," Kaiser
said.
According to Kaiser, the major change is in how
specific the revised charge would be. "There are a
lot of other places in the world where there are
human rights violations, so to narrow our charge
down to one.specific country may not be a good
idea," he said.
But Geys disagrees. "The trustees agree that
South Africa is a special case that deserves special
attention. ... By broadening the problem, it makes
it less tangible, and that's something I will try to
avoid."
The charge of the C-IR can be changed only by
the Board of Trustees. Landesmann will attempt to
have the proposal discussed by the C-IR at its two
remaining meetings of the year on June 3 and 6.
The C-IR will then make a recommendation to the
board.
"I will independently try to get it on the agenda
of the Commutcc on Investments," Geys said. That
