## Regional pairings announced; Pepperdine coming to Farm 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
"We've played a lot of roles this year," said
Stanford's John Verducci after Friday's 7-1
win over California. "We were the front
runner. then the race got tight. Now we're the
spoilers."
The Cardinal has been an overwhelming
success in just about every role it has played
this season. But as the spoilers last weekend,
it didn't quite get the job done.
Although Stanford took two out of three
from Cal over the weekend, the Bears were
still able to land a spot in this week's NCAA
West II Regional at Fresno State.
The Cardinal will be the No. 1 seed in the
West I Regional, which it will host beginning
Friday. Joining Stanford will be ninth-ranked
Pepperdine, No. 19 Nebraska and Pacific 10
Northern Division champion Oregon State.
The Waves and the Cornhuskers will open
the regional Friday at 1 1 a.m. The Cardinal
will take on the Beavers that afternoon at
3:30 p.m.
While admitting he knew little about OSU,
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess was

definitely aware of Pepperdine. calling the
West Coast Athletic Conference champions
"outstanding."
Stanford appears to he in one of the tough
er regionals, hut probably the toughest of
the eight is the Central, where top-ranked
Texas hosts No. 7 Oklahoma. No. 21
Louisiana State. No. 25 Houston. Lamar and
Grambling.
Other difficult regionals are the South I, in
cluding No. 3 Michigan and No. 5 Mississippi
State, and the Midwest, with No. 4 Oklahoma
State, No. 12 Oral Roberts and No. 17 Wich
ita State. All the regionals are double
elimination.
For the second straight year, the Pacific 10
Southern Division was well-represented. In
addition to Stanford and Cal, Arizona was
also named to the 38-team field. Like the
Bears, the Wildcats will be playing in Fresno.
The Six-Pac also sent three teams to the
tournament last season — Stanford, USC and
Arizona State. This is the fifth consecutive
year the Cardinal has been selected.
"I think they (the members of the selection
committee) had a lot of respect for our con

ference." said Marquess, a committee mem
ber himself. "There were a lot teams to go
over and some tough teams with good records
didn't make it, but I think the right ones did."
Stanford may not have been able to knock
Cal out of the tournament, but by winning
two of the three games, the Cardinal finished
the regular season with a 43-12 record. Stan
ford did not lose a series all season, taking all
10 of its Six-Pac series.
"It was an outstanding effort," Marquess
said on Sunday. "When three teams from a
league are even considered for regionals, to
win that league by six games is pretty impres
sive."
To see the Cardinal's efforts this weekend,
students will have to make their own efforts
— into their wallets. Tickets for each game
will cost $2.50 for students, senior citizens,
faculty, staff and children under 12, and an
all-session book can be purchased for $8.
Others will be charged $4.50 for an individual
game and $ 15 for the all-session book.
And as if paying for tickets weren't bad
enough, alcohol will not be permitted at any
game due to NCAA rules.

Students will get one more chance to bask in the sun on the left-field hillside grass of
Sunken Diamond when Stanford hosts the NCAA West I Regional this weekend, but
they will have to pay $2.50 per game or $8 for a seven-game booklet to do so, and they
won't be able to bring a cooler full of beer into the park.
