# Women netters open NCAA individuals
## Cardinal tries to pick itself up 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
OKLAHOMA CITY — Probably
the only good thing about the Stan
ford women's tennis team's early exit
from the NCAA team tournament
here is that fatigue shouldn't be a
problem for the Cardinal when the
individual singles and doubles com
petitions begin today.
The five Stanford netters entered
in the 64-player singles and the 32-
team doubles tournaments have had
plenty of rest. While the final four
teams had just one day of rest, Stan
ford. which lost in the quarterfinals
Friday, has had three.
"We usually have been successful
and played all the way through the
team portion, so I don't know how it
(the layoff) will affect us," said Stan
ford Coach Frank Brennan, whose
teams have finished lower than fourth
place only twice in his six years.
"But I think the girls have
recovered from the team loss," he
continued, "so they won't be emo
tionally distraught and emotionally
spent tomorrow."
Stanford's top four singles players
— Linda Gates, Patty Fendick, Leigh
Anne Eldredge and Stephanie
Savides — qualified for the singles
competition, and the Cardinal's No. 1
and No. 3 doubles teams — Gates
and Eldredge, and Savides and Kay
Tittle — are in the doubles tourna
ment.
The No. 2 team of Fendick and
Alyce Werdel, formed when Anna
Ivan quit the team, lost only once this
season but didn't play enough
matches to qualify here.
Gates, Eldredge and Savides could
each play as many as three matches
today, as two rounds of singles and
the first round of doubles are sched
uled. beginning at 6 a.m. PDT. Even
if the prediction of rain holds true,
the matches will be played as sched
uled. but on indoor courts in the area.
Probably Stanford's best bet to
bring home an individual title is Fen
dick. the fourth seed in singles.
"Patty's hot," Brennan said of Fen
dick. who played No. 2 singles for
most of the season. "She hasn't lost a
match in a long time, and hot players
tend to do well in tournaments."
Calling Fendick "hot" might be un
derstating the issue a bit. The sopho
more is 31 -3 in singles this season and

has won her last 18 straight. She has
also won 36 straight sets, and in her
last 34 sets, only twiee has her op
ponent won more than three games in
the set.
"Last year, coming into this I was
so burned out," Fendick said yester
day after a 90-minute workout, "hut
this year, I feel I have so much left. I
feel like I could play for three more
weeks and still not he tired."
Fendick opens play this morning
against Chris Gilles of Wisconsin and,
if victorious, will play either Indiana's
Reka Monoki or Mississippi's Jane
Young this afternoon.
Fendick, however, is not one to
look ahead. In fact, she says that as a
rule she doesn't look at her draw, and
thus has no idea who her future oppo
nents might be.
Gates, who was a singles finalist
and a doubles winner last year, cant
be counted out either. The eighth
seeded Gates, who last night was
named the Senior of the Year by the
Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches Asso
ciation, faces Houston's Hee Baek
and then either Colorado's Kathleen
Heckman or USC's Mary Norwood,
an Oklahoma City native.
"Linda did very well last year, and
she's certainly playing well enough to
do it again," Brennan said. " But
mentally, I just hope she's ready to
bear down."
Stanford's other two singles
entrants, Eldredge and Savides, have
tougher first-round opponents, but
nonetheless are favorites to advance.
Eldredge takes on Pepperdine's
Carole Bertrand, who won a qualify
ing match yesterday, and Savides gets
New Mexico's Leann Palmisano.
"Leigh Anne has been in a minor
slump lately, and she's ready to break
out of it," Brennan said. "If she gets
one good win, I think she'll do well in
the tournament."
In the doubles, Eldredge and Gates
are seeded third and play Oklahoma
State's Libby Boudreaux and Mary
Lamb.
"Gates and Eldredge are one of the
top three or four teams in the
country," Brennan said. "I think if
nobody gets hot, they could win it.
They are one of those teams that play
consistently, but didn't seem to hit
those sudden highs."
Meanwhile, Savides and Tittle will
be hard-pressed to advance past the

first round. The Cardinal pair drew
USC's Norwood and Caroline
Kuhlman, the fourth seeds.
Because the Cardinal's four singles
players and two doubles teams are in
different brackets of their respective
tournaments, the possibility of all-
Stanford singles semifinals and
doubles final does exist.
"You have to go one match at a
time," Brennan explained, "because
if vou look at all the names in the

tournament, you can say that you
can't beat them all. But you don't
have to beat them all. You only have
to beat five or six of them."
Card note
Stanford's last NCAA women's
singles champion was Alycia Moulton
in 1982. Gates and Klisc won
the doubles crown last vear.

thus has no idea who her future oppo
nents might be.
Gates, who was a singles finalist
and a doubles winner last year, cant
be counted out either. The eighth
seeded Gates, who last night was
named the Senior of the Year by the
Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches Asso
ciation, faces Houston's Hee Baek
and then either Colorado's Kathleen
Heckman or USC's Mary Norwood,
an Oklahoma City native.
"Linda did very well last year, and
she's certainly playing well enough to
do it again," Brennan said. " But
mentally, I just hope she's ready to
bear down."
Stanford's other two singles
entrants, Eldredge and Savides, have
tougher first-round opponents, but
nonetheless are favorites to advance.
Eldredge takes on Pepperdine's
Carole Bertrand, who won a qualify
ing match yesterday, and Savides gets
New Mexico's Leann Palmisano.
"Leigh Anne has been in a minor
slump lately, and she's ready to break
out of it," Brennan said. "If she gets
one good win, I think she'll do well in
the tournament."
In the doubles, Eldredge and Gates
are seeded third and play Oklahoma
State's Libby Boudreaux and Mary
Lamb.
"Gates and Eldredge are one of the
top three or four teams in the
country," Brennan said. "I think if
nobody gets hot, they could win it.
They are one of those teams that play
consistently, but didn't seem to hit
those sudden highs."
Meanwhile, Savides and Tittle will
be hard-pressed to advance past the

first round. The Cardinal pair drew
USC's Norwood and Caroline
Kuhlman, the fourth seeds.
Because the Cardinal's four singles
players and two doubles teams are in
different brackets of their respective
tournaments, the possibility of all-
Stanford singles semifinals and
doubles final does exist.
"You have to go one match at a
time," Brennan explained, "because
if vou look at all the names in the

tournament, you can say that you
can't beat them all. But you don't
have to beat them all. You only have
to beat five or six of them."
Card note
Stanford's last NCAA women's
singles champion was Alycia Moulton
in 1982. Gates and Klisc won
the doubles crown last vear.

Stanford's untimely departure from the NCAA Team Tennis Champi
onship gave Patty Fendick a few extra days to practice in Oklahoma
City for the individual tournament which begins today. Fendick is
seeded fourth in the singles competition.
OKLAHOMA CITY — Probably
the only good thing about the Stan
ford women's tennis team's early exit
from the NCAA team tournament
here is that fatigue shouldn't be a
problem for the Cardinal when the
individual singles and doubles com
petitions begin today.
The five Stanford netters entered
in the 64-player singles and the 32-
team doubles tournaments have had
plenty of rest. While the final four
teams had just one day of rest, Stan
ford. which lost in the quarterfinals
Friday, has had three.
"We usually have been successful
and played all the way through the
team portion, so I don't know how it
(the layoff) will affect us," said Stan
ford Coach Frank Brennan, whose
teams have finished lower than fourth
place only twice in his six years.
"But I think the girls have
recovered from the team loss," he
continued, "so they won't be emo
tionally distraught and emotionally
spent tomorrow."
Stanford's top four singles players
— Linda Gates, Patty Fendick, Leigh
Anne Eldredge and Stephanie
Savides — qualified for the singles
competition, and the Cardinal's No. 1
and No. 3 doubles teams — Gates
and Eldredge, and Savides and Kay
Tittle — are in the doubles tourna
ment.
The No. 2 team of Fendick and
Alyce Werdel, formed when Anna
Ivan quit the team, lost only once this
season but didn't play enough
matches to qualify here.
Gates, Eldredge and Savides could
each play as many as three matches
today, as two rounds of singles and
the first round of doubles are sched
uled. beginning at 6 a.m. PDT. Even
if the prediction of rain holds true,
the matches will be played as sched
uled. but on indoor courts in the area.
Probably Stanford's best bet to
bring home an individual title is Fen
dick. the fourth seed in singles.
"Patty's hot," Brennan said of Fen
dick. who played No. 2 singles for
most of the season. "She hasn't lost a
match in a long time, and hot players
tend to do well in tournaments."
Calling Fendick "hot" might be un
derstating the issue a bit. The sopho
more is 31 -3 in singles this season and

has won her last 18 straight. She has
also won 36 straight sets, and in her
last 34 sets, only twiee has her op
ponent won more than three games in
the set.
"Last year, coming into this I was
so burned out," Fendick said yester
day after a 90-minute workout, "hut
this year, I feel I have so much left. I
feel like I could play for three more
weeks and still not he tired."
Fendick opens play this morning
against Chris Gilles of Wisconsin and,
if victorious, will play either Indiana's
Reka Monoki or Mississippi's Jane
Young this afternoon.
Fendick, however, is not one to
look ahead. In fact, she says that as a
rule she doesn't look at her draw, and
thus has no idea who her future oppo
nents might be.
Gates, who was a singles finalist
and a doubles winner last year, cant
be counted out either. The eighth
