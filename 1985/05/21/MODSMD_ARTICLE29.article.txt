### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
ATHENS, Ga. — Sixth-ranked
Georgia advanced to the finals of the
NCAA Men's Tennis Team Champi
onship yesterday, defeating No. 2-
seeded USC, 5-4. Defending cham
pion UCLA also advanced with a 5-4
win over fourth-seeded Southern
Methodist.
Georgia had earlier upset No. 3
Stanford in Sunday's quarterfinal
match. The Bulldogs were cautious
after that win, knowing it was risky to
predict the results of the semifinal
match against the Trojans.
"We don't want to celebrate too
much, because we still have a long
way to go," Georgia's George Be
cecny said.
Georgia's caution can be traced to
last year's NCAA tournament, where

the Bulldogs played spectacular
early-round tennis only to lose 5-3 to
Stanford in the semifinal match.
"We were happy too soon last year.
USC is ail awfully good team, and it's
going to take a lot to beat them," Be
cecny said.
It wasn't an easy win for Georgia.
The Bulldogs led 4-2 after singles,
but USC won at second and third
doubles to tie things up at 4-4. and
the match was decided at No. 1
doubles.
USC is known for its excellent
doubles teams, but Jorge I .oca no and
Todd Witsken, ranked No. I in the
country, lost 6-3. 6-1 to Georgia's
Mikael Pernfors and Allen Miller.
Tournament officials are expecting
a record crowd at 4,500-seat Henry
Fields Stadium here for today's final
match.
