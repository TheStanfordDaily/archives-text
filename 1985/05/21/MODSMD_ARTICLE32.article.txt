## Cacophony prevails in 'The Melody that Got Lost' 
### NANCY HENRY Editorial staff 
Despite the definitipnal mediocrity
of its subject matter, "The Melody
That Got Lost," a musical satire of
Yuppie culture, had the potential for
both subtle and slapstick humor. It
had the potential to make Stanford
students laugh and look a bit more
closely at their past, present and
future, precisely by utilizing the in
trinsic ludicrousness of that
mediocrity; the play, however, as
adapted and updated by Tom
Lindblade from the script of Danish
playwright Kjell Abell, fails on all ac
counts, and itself manages only to
vacillate between the mediocre at
best to the embarrassing at worst.
It is difficult to imagine what the
original work, produced in Copen
hagen in 1935, could have had in
common with this "cabaret-style,"
fantastic farce which is so wholly de
pendent upon cliches and stereotypes
of California in the 1980s, but the
spark, the "melody" which inspired
Lindblade to write his own music
score (six songs composed with the
help of Douglas Fulton) was
definitely lost in the translation. The
loose and unoriginal plot involves a
young, middle class, pre-professional
named Johnson, the possessor of "the
melody," a special quality,
presumably an elan vital and thirst for
life those around him ostensibly lack
and which takes the metaphorical
form of a catchy melodic tune (the
only "catchy" tune in the show).
Johnson is transformed by an aggres
sive and inhuman boss and a woefully
waspish and "cute" fiance; once a
boring, nerdish climber of the social
and corporate ladder with something
different, Johnson becomes an even
more boring, lifeless and unthinking
perpetuator of bourgeois values with
nothing even slightly different; he is
one of an overwhelming mass of mech
anized, computerized Americans.
The rest of the play consists of his

search for that lost melodv in a jungle
of painfully obvious and unoriginal
symbols of contemporary society and
bureaucracy.
If this sounds vague and uninterest
ing, it is, and the music contributes
little to the quality of the production.
There are a few, though too few and
too weak, bright moments; some
even border on the clever. The three
"Millers," for example, are three
identical secretaries who appear
wearing masks and furiously typing
— acting out all the events of a day in
the office at a comically accelerated
pace. Several "chorus-girl" numbers
are performed by the "acting en
semble" of Katie Hemmeter, Wiek
Kruitwagen, Monica Lytle and
Cecilia Walker. Of these four, only
Lytle adds enthusiasm and humor to
the lacklustre score and at times silly
skits. She alone seems comfortable on
stage by establishing her own distinc
tive presence; she far outshines the
competent but unmemorable others.
Terra Vandergaw likewise
transcends her circumstances and
creates an amusing, sincere, some
what victimized character in the cute
little wife, Heather. She must
overcome a meddling mother and
oafish father to help her husband
rediscover the melody the parents
(appropriately though irritatingly ob
noxious as played by Celia Maurice
and Robert Dinner) will never hear.
She and Michael Quinn, whose
Johnson is as consistent and boring as
the role demands, but not without
some personal appeal, have a few
briefly amusing numbers, such as a
"house-hunting tango," several
domestic scenes at home, and espe
cially a slide show presentation of
their wedding — of the traditional va
riety, identical to hundreds we've all
seen and been. Other scenes,
however, such as when the two
couples go on a picnic and lose their
way (with the uninspired lyrics of the

song "Sunday" droning in the back
ground), seems tedious and pointless.
The first act ends on a strong and
promising note of "The Idea of a
Man," the best of the cabaret-like
numbers, but, unfortunately, the
whole second act is a decided disap
pointment. More lost than the
melody, the characters seek the only
solution they can imagine to their
horrendous predicament — a "happy
ending." All cynical comments aside.

this simply does not make for a solid
play and the melody is just not
enough to hold things together. At
tempts at creative innovation seem
not only forced and unnecessary, but
distracting. Interruptions from the
audience, for example, the interac
tion of the real and the unreal, does
not break a spell because one was
never cast. The rebellion of the char
acter Heather, rather than revolu
tionary, is only childish and con

trived. These episodes could have
been eliminated altogether.
Finally, a word must be said for the
stage, which, as with so many Drama
Department productions, is quite im
pressive, creating a surrealistic sur
rounding of pastel colors and Dali
like images, interspersed with con
temporary commercial logos. Wen
dell Cole designed the set, and it is a
shame so much of the creativity of the
production seems to have been in

vested in the technical, visual depart
ment. "The Melody that Got Lost"
could have offered a light critique of a
society that is very real to us in the
Silicon Valley and might have em
phasized there is something of "life"
lost in the mechanized, routinized,
bureaucratized world we inhabit, but,
instead, it has become muddled in ar
tistic technique and appearances, per
haps unintentionally becoming a
parody of itself.
