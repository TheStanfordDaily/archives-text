## Windham Hill soars with' Day on the Green' show 
### ANDREW CROWELL Staff writer 
Check that headline out again, friends. It says,"Day on
the Green," not "Day at Green." There is a big differ
ence. After all, almost everyone has experienced a day at
Green, or at least an afternoon there before finals ... so
why pay $10 to do something your Stanford ID lets you
do for free? Green was definitely not the place to be.
No, the place to be last Saturday afternoon was Frost
Amphitheatre, for Windham Hill Record's "Day on the
Green." Will Ackerman, Michael Hedges and Shadowfax
performed some of the mellowest, Yuppiest sounds im
aginable to a mellow, Yuppie crowd.
Windham Hill Records started right here at Stan
ford/Palo Alto about 10 years ago when Ackerman
hesitantly released an album of original guitar works,
heeding the advice of some friends. Well, as many other
Peninsula success stories go, the concept caught on. Ack
erman and his wife started the company and signed more
artists to the label. To be honest, the process wasn't quite
that easy, but nevertheless did happen about that quickly.
Ackerman, introduced simply as "the founding father
of Windham Hill," began the three-and-one-half-hour
event by promptly taking off his shoes and lulling the au
dience with his smooth and reflective acoustic guitar
pieces. Ackerman's hey-I-just-came-off-the-beach ap
pearance largely helped to reinforce the soothing nature
of his songs. Strumming through "Seattle," Ackerman
noted that he only called the piece Seattle because that
was the place where he first performed it live. Appropri
ately, he retitled the song "Stanford," to the approval of
his fans. Charles "Chuck" Greenwood joined Ackerman
for a lovely rendition of the Romeo and Juliet work Ack
erman wrote years ago for the drama production per
formed here at Stanford. The beauty and pathos created
by the guitar/lyricon duet marked it as a real high spot in
Ackerman's set. Michael Hedges joined Ackerman for a
stunning version of "Hawkcircle," as the two guitarists
displayed their talents. Joined by Greenberg once more,
Ackerman ended with the soothing "Visiting" — a perfect
finish to a varied, yet mellow set.

Hedges performed the next hour to a wildly approving
audience. Hedges' ability to produce strong percussion
and beautiful harmonies while running through guitar
lines so rapidly he's liable to get a ticket are just a few of
characteristics for which this artist is known. From Silent
Anticipations" to "Baby Toes," Hedges provided a stun
ning act both visually and audibly. Ihe rellective
"Watching My Life Go By " the title cut from Hedges'
forthcoming album, displayed the artist s polished vocal
abilities as well. (An amusing footnote: Hedges confessed
that this last song was written "while sitting in the third
back seat of a station wagon that faced the wrong way.")
As if the above acrobatics weren't enough, Hedges
plucked out amazingly rich sound one-handed in
"Watching It Begin." Truly, Hedges is and will be a
musician to watch; see him if you get a chance.
Finally, Shadowfax ended the afternoon with its unique
brand of progressive jazz/rock, which includes a healthy
dose of Oriental flavoring. The five-piece, Chicago-based
band ran through a set of new and older material, includ
ing "Shadowdance," "Thousand Teardrops and even
some untitled work. Once again. Greenwood s wondertul
lyricon and saxophone textures served as a real highlight,
as these instruments are effectively able to cut through the
synthy, Eastern background tapestry. One of the most
memorable moments of their set was their rendition of
"Brown Rice" during which the bass player used a Vanish
container as a rattle. Shadowfax brought the sun-worn
crowd to its feet with "Sweet Home Chicago to finish a
super afternoon of quality entertainment.
Clearly, what began as a dream a decade ago has
become a major musical and artistic project. Windham
Hill's varied artists provide diverse styles on high-quality
pressings — two facts quite absent in the mainstream
music world of today. "You are the people who have
made this happen," Ackerman noted in some parting
words. "And we've had so much fun that we've decided to
make this an annual event,"he added to an enthusiastic
ally responsive audience. Go to the show next year if you
can. After all, Green Library is always here, but "Day on
the Green" comes only once a year.
