## 'Spring Migration '85' explores modern dance 
### GREG CROSSFIELD 
The Dance Department's Spring
Migration '85 was a well-planned col
lection of modern dance pieces that
left the audience wanting to see more.
Performed Wednesday through Sat
urday at Roble Dance Studio, the
performance brought together dan

'Conversation Among Kneecaps,' by
Jancy Limpert, was the most thought
provoking piece of the evening. It
included 14 dancers illustrating some
poor aspects of society.

cers with varying degrees of experi
ence and produced a thought
provoking show.
In "Betwixt the Hemispheres,"
choreographed by Lisa Stapp, dan
cers Kitty Donohue, Georgene Os
borne and Lynn Uyeda each made
very mechanical and smooth move
ments intermittently. The black
dance tights worn by all suggested
that their movements were related in
some way, but there were no
giveaways to easy understanding. The
piece was enjoyable nonetheless. But
further investigation revealed that the

dancers symbolized the right and left
half of the brain. One side was
"techy," while the other side was
devoted to "fuzzy," and there were
spurts when both sides operated si
multaneously.
The most breathtaking piece per
formed was "Fadings,"

choreographed by Kevin Grant, with
music by Philip Glass. This was a
modern dance version of ballet that
combined the graceful moves of
ballerinas Kera Statcn and Sarah
Russell with spectacular lifts and
moves performed, seemingly without
effort, by Kevin Grant and Andrew
Norris, and their partners Kitty
Donohue and Aleta Hayes.
The show was a success thanks to
the efforts of many people. One per
son whose efforts were particularly
notable was Jancy Limpert of the
Dance Department. Limpert was

production manager and stage
manager, as well as choreographer of
no fewer than three pieces. "Produc
tion is my love," she said, "but the
three pieces also gave me a chance to
express some things I think are im
portant about life."
"Conversation Among Kneecaps,"
by Limpert, was the most thought
provoking piece of the evening. It in
cluded 14 dancers illustrating some
poor aspects of society. Soloist Bar
ney Stein was the individual left
outside the mainstream as people
nnshed by toward their goals without
acknowledging his existence. Once
recognized, he was unable to fit in
and again expunged from the main
stream of society.
Late in Limpert's piece, the audi
ence was thrilled when dancer Karen
Scholz, a blond-haired, blue-eyed
aerobics teacher and grad student,
literally picked up Stein.
"Women are just beginning to
take jobs in construction and other
fields they have never been in
before," Limpert said. "Karen's lif
ting David illustrated that women are
strong and capable of doing any
thing."
For those of you who missed last
week's performances, two of the
pieces will be performed tonight at 8
p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium as
part of Alea 11, an ensemble for con
temporary music. Entrance is free.
