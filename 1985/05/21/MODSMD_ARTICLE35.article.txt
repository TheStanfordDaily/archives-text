## Tresidder odor conquered 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
By installing a manhole cover behind the Corner
Pocket to cover a steam vault beneath Tresidder Union
patio, the campus facilities department has done away
with a stench that has bothered Tresidder customers
and bypassers off and on for the last several months.
According to Fritz Beyer, manager of chill water and
steam distribution for campus utilities, workers at the
Corner Pocket had been assuming that the hole, which
was formerly covered only by a ventilating grate, was
part of the sewer system rather than a steam vault. He
said the garbage Corner Pocket employees had been
throwing down the hole had accumulated and rotted
among the steam pipes, causing the odor.
Beyer and managers of the Corner Pocket agreed
that the rotting garbage posed no health risk other than
the odor.
Last Friday, when the solid manhole cover was in
stalled to prevent further dumping into the opening,
there were about six inches of rotting trash in the vault,
part of the campus steam system, Beyer said.
He noted that the Corner Pocket managers have
been "notified repeatedly" in the past that the hole is
not a sewer, but, because of rapid turnover in manage
ment and employees, some workers were never told
not to throw garbage into the grate.
Workers are supposed to dispose of garbage in the
kitchen where it can drain directly into the sewer sys
tem, according to Beyer.
"It's a case of people being lazy and stupid," he said.

"They're supposed to go back to the kitchen and dump
it." The stench was due to "improper action on the
part of Tresidder Union. They were treating it like a
sewer."
John Loya, one of the managers of the Corner
Pocket, was unaware that the hole covers steam pipes
rather than the sewer system, but said that the restau
rant "has specific rules" about waste disposal. "We tell
our employees that there's not to be yogurt thrown
down the drain."
He said that two major causes of the odor could be
disposed yogurt and soda syrup which were occasion
ally thrown down the drain by Corner Pocket
employees. "I'd imagine employees once in a while
throw [garbage] into the drain," he said.
Another manager of the Corner Pocket, Kim Kelly,
knew that the grate covered a steam vault and said that
those who have been disposing of trash down the hole
have been "mostly new employees."
Beyer said that covering the steam vault with a sold
manhole cover will be "detrimental to the steam lines,
but we'll live with the detrimental effects." With the
ventilation grate, the temperature in the vault was
about 180 degrees Farenheit, and now, with the solid
cover the temperature is about 220 degrees.
He said that the high temperature may damage the
pipes but the temperature will also kill the bacteria
growing on the debris which collected in the vault. The
temperature "should cook out anything that's there,"
he said.
Frustrated by past attempts to solve the problem,
Beyer said, "I believe we've really fixed it this time."
