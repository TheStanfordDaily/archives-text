# $1,500 raised
## KZSU ends first fund-raiser 
### JOYA WESLEY Staff writer 
Student radio station KZSU closed
its first-ever independent fund
raising event Sunday after collecting
$ 1,500 in pledges.
Program Director Linda Christie
coordinated the event, which con
sisted of special programming and
was kicked off with last Saturday's
broadcast of Splendor on the Grass.
The purpose of the fund-raiser, ac
cording to Christie, was to show the
Stanford community that the station
is making an effort to help support it
self. This statement comes in
response to the recent approval of a
special fee assessment of more than
$56,000 by the students. "Our efforts
at underwriting have been small,"
Christie said. The fund-raiser was an
attempt to remedy this.
During the week of special pro
gramming, the station solicited
pledges of $5 to $50 in addition to

selling T-shirts, bumper stickers and
buttons.
Monday evening, the station's
fund-raising attempts targeted Palo
Alto. Leland Levy, the city's mayor,
gave a presentation on the air, and the
station received a plaque from the
city.
Tuesday through Friday evenings,
from 6 p.m. until midnight, KZSU
aired local music, new music, funk
and reggae, each on separate nights.
From Saturday evening at 6 until
Sunday morning at 6, the station
broadcast a Grateful Dead marathon.
On its daily morning jazz pro
grams, the station presented a special
focus each day, including vocal jazz,
jazz fusion, saxaphone and avant
garde.
According to Christie, the fund
raiser, which was aimed solely at
KZSU listeners, was successful. The
realistic goal was $1,000, and the
week surpassed this by $500. "We
found that we have a-lot of loyal lis

teners out there," she said.
The sum doesn't alter the amount
of KZSU's fee assessment from the
ASSU. According to Business
Manager Ted Wheeler, it falls into
the category of "outside revenue" in
the station's ASSU approved budget.
"The ASSU, I'm sure, is elated be
cause we're trying to get outside reve
nue," he said.
There has been pressure placed on
the station and on other student or
ganizations to increase outside
sources of revenue to reduce the
amount of special fee requests.
"They're definitely pressuring us to
seek other sources and we're doing
our best," Wheeler said.
The fund-raiser is scheduled to
become an annual event, and will
become a separate line item in the
budgets of upcoming years. The cur
rent amount of outside income for the
station is $10,000. This figure does
not include fund-raisers.
