# 80 wait-listers get fat letters

### 
Undergraduate Admissions has accepted 80 applicants
from its wait list in hopes of increasing the number of en
tering freshmen by about 50 students, according to Direc
tor of Freshman Admissions John Bunnell.
In recent years, admissions officials have admitted only
"a handful" of students off the wait list, Bunnell said. Last
year, no wait-listed applicants were admitted.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Jean Fetter said
admissions officials this year accepted 100 fewer appli
cants than last year, noting that they were aiming for a
smaller entering class this year.
Last year, 1,610 students — about 100 more than usual
— accepted their offer of admission. That number con
stituted a surprisingly high 64 percent of the 2,524 appli
cants admitted.
But as of May 10 this year, 1,487 students — or 61.3
percent of the 2,424 applicants offered admission in April
— had indicated that they plan to attend Stanford. Fetter
said she went to the wait list because she is aiming for a
class of 1,500 to 1,525.
Fetter noted that Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Brown, Co
lumbia and Amherst have also gone to their wait lists this
year.

Stanford received a record 17,637 applications for ad
mission to the freshman class this year, up from 15,614
last year. Fetter said many Ivy League schools also
received more applications this year than in 1984, but ac
knowledged that Stanford's pool of applicants jumped by
a greater percentage than did those at the Ivies, and that
Stanford received about 4,000 more applications than did
any one Ivy League school.
Asked why so many students are applying to Stanford,
Fetter discussed the University's "increasing stature,"'
both nationally and internationally, and cited the Univer
sity's location and aid-blind admissions policy as particu
larly attractive.
Bunnell, a 22-year veteran in Stanford's admissions of
fice, said the academic credentials of applicants this year
are the strongest ever. A total of 2,787 applicants — an
increase of 18 percent over last year — have 4.0 grade
point averages. A record 2,089 applicants, 36 percent
more than last year, scored 1,400 or above on their SATs.
Fetter said the most popular schools among students
who turned down Stanford's offers of admission this year
were Harvard, Yale and Princeton.
