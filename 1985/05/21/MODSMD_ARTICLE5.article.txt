# Forum probes investment
## Faculty discusses pension fund alternatives 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
Putting money behind moral values was the dominant
theme at an informational forum yesterday on a South
Africa-free retirement investment alternative for faculty
and staff members. However, making money was still a
major concern of the panelists, faculty and staff members.
Panelists William Massy, vice president for business and
finance, John Harrington, president of Working Assets
Money Fund, and Robert Parker, director of personnel,
discussed possible options and alternatives for those fac
ulty and exempt staff members wishing to invest in South
Africa-free pension programs under the Contributory Re
tirement Plan.
Under the plan, faculty and staff members decide the
amount of money invested and which companies will
receive the money. Each individual's decision will deter
mine the amount of pension money he receives. "You
take the risk — you make the choice," Massy said.
Among the current retirement plan investments. Massy
said that "most of the funds do have substantial positions"
with companies doing business in South Africa. The Uni
versity will "try to find the best fund to meet that (South
Africa-free) criteria" by the end of the calendar year, he
told the faculty and staff members.
Massy also said that both moral and economic "trade
offs" are considerations the faculty must keep in mind.
For example, a trade-off on returns might be necessary in
order to fulfill the faculty's request.

A total of 168 faculty and staff members have signed a
petition supporting advocates of total divestment of the
University's holding of stock in corporations doing busi
ness in South Africa. The petition, although not directly
related to the retirement plan, states that "the moral im
perative is clear and overriding."
Harrington, however, said that a trade-off on monetary
returns need not be a factor when opting for a South
Africa-free pension plan. Harrington cited a New World
Foundation study, which stated that over a five-to-10-
vear period, certain stocks of grade A-minus and above in
South Africa-free portfolios showed a 29.2 pcrcent higher
return than those stocks in South Africa portfolios.
Harrington explained that most South Africa-free
portfolios have invested in small businesses, which have
done remarkably in the last 10 years.
He also said that an "increase in risk and volatility" are
characteristic of South Africa-free pension plans. Har
rington cited the same study, which stated an increased
risk factor of 7 percent for those stocks not in South
Africa portfolios.
Harrington offered to the faculty and staff members
numerous South Africa-free pension plan options, such as
the U.S. Trust Company and the Calvert Group social
funds, which arc concerned with the relations between in
vestment and society.
Massy said another consequence in a South Africa-free
retirement program would be "a loss
of diversification."
Harrington countered Massy,
saying, "We actually increase diver
sification, because we are forcing
money markets to seek out new com

panies. .. . The real force of divest
ment is that you (American citizens)
have over a trillion dollars in pension
funds. You're talking about individ
uals and institutions beginning to
look at the next step."
Divestment would ultimately "cut
off the life blood of companies," Har
rington said. He qualified his state
ment, explaining what he termed
"boardroom morality." Companies

do not invest based on moral deci
sions, but on what will make the most
money, he said.
"I would dispute that" statement,
Massy said. He did not elaborate.
Harrington added that faculty and
staff members should not look just at
the exclusionary criteria, but "at the
positive criteria and positive impact
we can have," citing local businesses
as an example of possible areas of in

vestment. The ad hoc faculty and staff
group initially concerned with Stan
ford investments in South Africa also
added other social concerns, besides
South Africa, to their list of criteria
for a good moral investment.
Massy warned that "action of the
University has implications for
others" on and off campus. "It
transcends strictly investment consid
eration," he said, citing fund raising

as an example.
Massy added, "It's important to
take into account all these other facts.
They are facts of life." He stressed
"balancing the values against the con
sequences."
Harrington commented that
Massy's statement "is very frighten
ing to me." It is very "dangerous if
you are afraid to take action because
of a corporate gift," he said.

Massy did say that "we (University
members) do need to be more active
in selective investment. ... Stanford
is at the head of the parade."
Personnel Director Parker
reminded the faculty and staff mem
bers present that "those (South
Africa-free) options'remain a choice
for the individual. We're pro-choice,
to coin a phrase."

positive criteria and positive impact
we can have," citing local businesses
as an example of possible areas of in

vestment. The ad hoc faculty and staff
group initially concerned with Stan
ford investments in South Africa also
added other social concerns, besides
South Africa, to their list of criteria
for a good moral investment.
Massy warned that "action of the
University has implications for
others" on and off campus. "It
transcends strictly investment consid
eration," he said, citing fund raising

as an example.
Massy added, "It's important to
take into account all these other facts.
They are facts of life." He stressed
"balancing the values against the con
sequences."
Harrington commented that
Massy's statement "is very frighten
ing to me." It is very "dangerous if
you are afraid to take action because
of a corporate gift," he said.

Massy did say that "we (University
members) do need to be more active
in selective investment. ... Stanford
is at the head of the parade."
Personnel Director Parker
reminded the faculty and staff mem
bers present that "those (South
Africa-free) options'remain a choice
for the individual. We're pro-choice,
to coin a phrase."
