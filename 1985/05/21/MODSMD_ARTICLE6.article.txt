# Zschau crosses party

### JEFF BIDDULPH Staff writer 
U.S. Rep. Ed Zschau (R-Sunnyvale) said he was
"disappointed" that local Republicans voted last week to
call for his removal from the House Foreign Affairs Com
mittee because he opposed aid to the Contras.
Zschau said the move was disappointing because the
Republican Central Committee of Santa Clara County
hadn't taken the time to talk to him about the vote. In
light of accusations against Zschau's party loyalty, Zschau
said he hadn't followed the party line because he found
President Reagan's blind funding of the Contras to lack
the necessary support. "The way to support President
Reagan is to come up with something that works," he
said.
Zschau said he supports legislation "focusing more on
the Contadora process." He said the U.S. course of action
should be to, "pull back and continue to have the ban on
military and paramilitary actionin addition to a cease
fire within Nicaragua and a full exploration of the other
diplomatic options. "Let's see what happens. That ap
proach could give rise to some positive results," Zschau
said.
Zschau told the Times Tribune that the move by the
Republican central committee also "amused" him be
cause House Republican leaders, instead of ostracizing
him after his votes against aid to the Nicaraguan rebels,
have asked him to serve on a task force aimed at helping
the Republican leadership address issues in Central
America.
The committee voted 11-10 Thursday to call on the
House GOP leadership to "strongly consider" removing
Zschau from the foreign policy committee. The commit
tee said it "deeply regrets the position taken by [ZschauJ
in opposing aid to the freedom fighters in Nicaragua."
Zschau, whose district includes the Stanford campus,
was the only California Republican to vote against the aid
to the Contras, who are fighting to overthrow the
Sandinista government. He has voted against military aid
to the Contras both in committee and on the House floor,
and has taken other positions opposed by the GOP lead
ership, such as voting against funds for the MX missile.
Richard Salsman, a member of the committee who
voted in favor of calling for Zschau's removal, told The
Daily he is "trying to get the congressman to get back on

the president's side. Every Republican in California voted
with the president. Everyone from California. Except
Zschau."
Salsman said aid to the Contras is necessary because "I
don't want the Russians in control down there. They're in
control in too many goddamned places now."
Zschau said, however, that he favors more emphasis on
diplomatic, rather than military, solutions to the conflict
in Nicaragua.

"I guess that, for people who are 2,500 miles away from
Washington, D.C., somebody deviating from the consen
sus position of the party is seen as being on the other
side," Zschau said. "But I try to focus on the issues, not
on partisan politics."
John Hanley, who voted against the Santa Clara County
Republicans resolution, said the committee's vote went
against the organization's main purpose, which is to get
Republicans elected.
"The resolution is provocative. Engaging in offensive
cannibalism doesn't accomplish anything. We're devour
ing our own," Hanley said.
