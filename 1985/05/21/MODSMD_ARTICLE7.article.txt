# Kennedy demands sanctions
## 
### DAVID RISSER Senior staff writer 
When University President Donald
Kennedy stated his opposition to
total divestment as a step toward end
ing the system of apartheid in South
Africa, he was challenged by officers
of the Black Student Union to offer
alternatives.
Earlier this month. Kennedy
responded with an open letter to the
community in The Daily, stating.
"The legislative arena is the best one
in which to pursue our goals."
Specifically, congressional legisla
tion introduced by Sen. Edward
Kennedy (D-Mass.) "contains a num
ber of provisions that I think will take
us in the right direction," he wrote.
Sen. Kennedy's bill, which has
collected 12 Senate co-sponsors since

its introduction on March 7, is titled
the Anti-Apartheid Act of 1985.
Identical legislation has been intro
duced in the House of Representa
tives by Rep. Bill Gray (D-Pa.).
The bill would ban bank loans and
computer sales to the government of
South Africa, prohibit new invest
ment by U.S. firms in South Africa
and halt the importation of South
African gold Krugerrands.
President Kennedy, who has been
in direct contact with Sen. Ken
nedy's office regarding the proposed
legislation, has asked that such legis
lation make provisions for
humanitarian aid. The prohibitions
called for in this legislation do not ap
ply to loans for any educational,
housing or health facility which is
"available to all persons on a totally

nondiscriminatory basis" and the bill
permits donations of computers to
primary and secondary schools.
Under this legislation, the U.S.
president, with the consent of
Congress, may waive the investment
and Krugerrand prohibitions if one of
eight steps toward ending apartheid is
met.
These conditions include the elimi
nation, by the government of South
Africa, of removals of populations on
account of race, the freeing of all po
litical prisoners, the elimination of
residence restrictions based on race
and the ending of the policy of sepa
rating black workers from their
families.
Both Kennedy and soon-to-be
Board of Trustees President Warren
Christopher have said they want any
enacted legislation to adequately
cover subsidiaries of U.S. companies.
The Anti-Apartheid Act would apply
to subsidiaries.
"If you can help close the
regulatory loophole like the huge,
gaping loophole for foreign sub
sidiaries of American companies,
you'll have made a two-base hit,"
Christopher said May 7 at the public
forum on divestment.
"If you can persuade the Congress
to enact new legislation along the
lines of the Kennedy bill, you'll have
hit a home run,"he added, voicing his
opposition to divestment and support
for pursuing anti-apartheid action in
the legislative arena.
The University will not directly
support the bill, however. "We don't
position Stanford on issues where
there is no clear or direct role of the
University in the outcome," Kennedy
told The Daily last week. "It is not a
line that's easy to draw," he added.
In the case of legislation regarding
South Africa, "It's likely that I would
testify as a private individual," Ken
nedy said.
Analyses of three bills before
Congress were recently completed by
Diana Diamond, who is on special as
signment to the Office of Public Af
fairs. The analyses will be made
available for student and faculty use,

President Kennedy wrote in his open
letter.
In addition to summarizing the
Kennedy bill. Diamond analyzed a
bill written by Rep. Howard Berman
(D-Calif.) that would prohibit ex
ports of certain technological and
military goods to South Africa.
The bill is strictly an amendment to
the Export Administration Act of
1979; it does not address conditions
in South Africa.
Another bill analyzed by Diamond,
the Anti-Apartheid Action Act of
1985, introduced by Sen. Robert
Dole (R-Kan.), lists the same sanc
tions as the Sen. Kennedy bill, but
asks that they be imposed if the presi
dent decides in two years that signifi
cant progress has not been made
toward ending the system of apart
heid. The president could then rec
ommend sanctions which would have
to be approved by Congress.
"This bill is substantially weaker
than the Kennedy bill on the same
subject," according to Diamond's
analysis.
The bill recognizes "it may be
easier to do nothing, wait two years,
and then hope American interest in
the apartheid problems has dissipated
in Congress," the analysis reads.
The president of the African Na
tional Congress has spoken in support
of the Sen. Kennedy bill "as a step
toward total economic sanctions
against South Africa," said David
Ndaba, a New York spokesman for
the ANC.
The ANC prefers that U.S. con
gressional action be "taken further to

include bills like that one of [Rep.
Ronald Dellums (D-Calif.)] that calls
for total economic sanctions," he
said.
Legislation regarding South Africa
has been referred to the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee for
hearings. Assistants to both Senators
Kennedy and Dole said they expect
Congress to take action on some form
of legislation calling for economic
sanctions on the government of South
Africa before the August congres
sional recess.

Sen. Kennedy's bill, which has
collected 12 Senate co-sponsors since

its introduction on March 7, is titled
the Anti-Apartheid Act of 1985.
Identical legislation has been intro
duced in the House of Representa
tives by Rep. Bill Gray (D-Pa.).
The bill would ban bank loans and
computer sales to the government of
South Africa, prohibit new invest
ment by U.S. firms in South Africa
and halt the importation of South
African gold Krugerrands.
President Kennedy, who has been
in direct contact with Sen. Ken
nedy's office regarding the proposed
legislation, has asked that such legis
lation make provisions for
humanitarian aid. The prohibitions
called for in this legislation do not ap
ply to loans for any educational,
housing or health facility which is
"available to all persons on a totally

nondiscriminatory basis" and the bill
permits donations of computers to
primary and secondary schools.
Under this legislation, the U.S.
president, with the consent of
Congress, may waive the investment
and Krugerrand prohibitions if one of
eight steps toward ending apartheid is
met.
These conditions include the elimi
nation, by the government of South
Africa, of removals of populations on
account of race, the freeing of all po
litical prisoners, the elimination of
residence restrictions based on race
and the ending of the policy of sepa
rating black workers from their
families.
Both Kennedy and soon-to-be
Board of Trustees President Warren
Christopher have said they want any
enacted legislation to adequately
cover subsidiaries of U.S. companies.
The Anti-Apartheid Act would apply
to subsidiaries.
"If you can help close the
regulatory loophole like the huge,
gaping loophole for foreign sub
sidiaries of American companies,
you'll have made a two-base hit,"
Christopher said May 7 at the public
forum on divestment.
"If you can persuade the Congress
to enact new legislation along the
lines of the Kennedy bill, you'll have
hit a home run,"he added, voicing his
opposition to divestment and support
for pursuing anti-apartheid action in
the legislative arena.
The University will not directly
support the bill, however. "We don't
position Stanford on issues where
there is no clear or direct role of the
University in the outcome," Kennedy
told The Daily last week. "It is not a
line that's easy to draw," he added.
In the case of legislation regarding
South Africa, "It's likely that I would
testify as a private individual," Ken
nedy said.
Analyses of three bills before
Congress were recently completed by
Diana Diamond, who is on special as
signment to the Office of Public Af
fairs. The analyses will be made
available for student and faculty use,

President Kennedy wrote in his open
letter.
In addition to summarizing the
Kennedy bill. Diamond analyzed a
bill written by Rep. Howard Berman
(D-Calif.) that would prohibit ex
ports of certain technological and
military goods to South Africa.
The bill is strictly an amendment to
the Export Administration Act of
1979; it does not address conditions
in South Africa.
Another bill analyzed by Diamond,
the Anti-Apartheid Action Act of
1985, introduced by Sen. Robert
Dole (R-Kan.), lists the same sanc
tions as the Sen. Kennedy bill, but
asks that they be imposed if the presi
dent decides in two years that signifi
cant progress has not been made
toward ending the system of apart
heid. The president could then rec
ommend sanctions which would have
to be approved by Congress.
"This bill is substantially weaker
than the Kennedy bill on the same
subject," according to Diamond's
analysis.
The bill recognizes "it may be
easier to do nothing, wait two years,
and then hope American interest in
the apartheid problems has dissipated
in Congress," the analysis reads.
The president of the African Na
tional Congress has spoken in support
of the Sen. Kennedy bill "as a step
toward total economic sanctions
against South Africa," said David
Ndaba, a New York spokesman for
the ANC.
The ANC prefers that U.S. con
gressional action be "taken further to

include bills like that one of [Rep.
Ronald Dellums (D-Calif.)] that calls
for total economic sanctions," he
said.
Legislation regarding South Africa
has been referred to the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee for
hearings. Assistants to both Senators
Kennedy and Dole said they expect
Congress to take action on some form
of legislation calling for economic
sanctions on the government of South
Africa before the August congres
sional recess.
