When University President Donald
Kennedy stated his opposition to
total divestment as a step toward end
ing the system of apartheid in South
Africa, he was challenged by officers
of the Black Student Union to offer
alternatives.
Earlier this month. Kennedy
responded with an open letter to the
community in The Daily, stating.
"The legislative arena is the best one
in which to pursue our goals."
Specifically, congressional legisla
tion introduced by Sen. Edward
Kennedy (D-Mass.) "contains a num
ber of provisions that I think will take
us in the right direction," he wrote.
Sen. Kennedy's bill, which has
collected 12 Senate co-sponsors since

its introduction on March 7, is titled
the Anti-Apartheid Act of 1985.
Identical legislation has been intro
duced in the House of Representa
tives by Rep. Bill Gray (D-Pa.).
The bill would ban bank loans and
computer sales to the government of
South Africa, prohibit new invest
ment by U.S. firms in South Africa
and halt the importation of South
African gold Krugerrands.
President Kennedy, who has been
in direct contact with Sen. Ken
nedy's office regarding the proposed
legislation, has asked that such legis
lation make provisions for
humanitarian aid. The prohibitions
called for in this legislation do not ap
ply to loans for any educational,
housing or health facility which is
"available to all persons on a totally

nondiscriminatory basis" and the bill
permits donations of computers to
primary and secondary schools.
Under this legislation, the U.S.
president, with the consent of
Congress, may waive the investment
and Krugerrand prohibitions if one of
eight steps toward ending apartheid is
met.
These conditions include the elimi
nation, by the government of South
Africa, of removals of populations on
account of race, the freeing of all po
litical prisoners, the elimination of
residence restrictions based on race
and the ending of the policy of sepa
rating black workers from their
families.
Both Kennedy and soon-to-be
