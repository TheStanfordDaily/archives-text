Israel, Syria exchange prisoners
GENEVA, Switzerland — Three Israeli soldiers captured in Lebanon
in 1982 and held by Syria were freed yesterday in exchange for 1,150
Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
The International Committee of the Red Cross arranged the swap,
which brought the Israelis to Geneva from Damascus for simultaneous
release with 394 Palestinians flown to Geneva from Israel. An additional
756 Palestinian and Lebanese prisoners were driven out of Israeli deten
tion centers.
The terms of the exchange "have been respected and realized," Red
Cross spokesman Jean-Jacques Kurz told reporters at the Geneva air
port some 13 hours after the first of three planeloads of Palestinian
prisoners arrived from Tel Aviv.
The Red Cross declared the exchange complete after the 756 othrr
Palestinian and Lebanese prisoners were confirmed to have beer
released from Israeli prisons and a detention camp.
In Hebron, on the Israeli-occupied West Bank of the Jordan River, a
group of Jewish settlers led by militant Rabbi Moshe Levinger opened
fire Monday to break up a crowd of Palestinians celebrating the release
of the prisoners. There were no reports of injuries. y
One of the men freed by Israel was Koza Okamoto, 37, sole survivor
of a three-man Japanese Red Army suicide squad that machine-gunned
26 travelers in the 1972 Lod airport massacre.
The three Israelis were the last of the soldiers held by Arabs since Is
rael's invasion of Lebanon in 1982. They had been taken captive by the
Syrian-backed Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command.
Security at the airport was "very tight" during the operation, accord
ing to Geneva city protocol chief Robert Vieux, who said some 100
police were deployed at the airport.
It was the third major Israeli-Syrian prisoner exchange in six years.
The last was in June 1984 in the U.N.-patrolled zone between Israel and
Syria. Six Israelis were then traded for 311 Syrians, most of them sol
diers captured in Lebanon.
IRA bomb attack kills four police
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — An IRA bomb blew up a patrol car
near the Irish border yesterday, killing four police officers and slightly
wounding five civilians, police said.
The bomb, hidden in a truck parked on a country road near Newry,
apparently was set off by remote control as the car escorted a security
van with cash from the Irish Republic bound for Belfast, the British
Broadcasting Corp. reported.
The blast felled trees, damaged houses and scattered wreckage
hundreds of yards through nearby fields. It hurled the bullet-proof
police vehicle across the road, killing the three policeman and a
policewoman outright, the BBC said. Police said they had no details of
the type of bomb involved. Earlier, they had described it as a land mine.
Killed were Inspector James Wilson, 28; Constable Tracey Ellen
Doak, 21; Constable David Baird, 22, and and Reserve Constable
Steven Rodgers, 19.
All were attached to Newry police station, target of an IRA mortar at
tack in February that killed nine officers.
The five civilians were treated for cuts and bruises.
The killings brought to 17 the death toll this year among members of
the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern Ireland's mainly Protestant
police force.
The outlawed Irish Republican Army issued a statement to local news
organizations saying its action showed that the IRA could plant ex
plosives even in areas under close police observation.
The IRA is trying to drive the British from Northern Ireland, hoping
to unite the province with the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish
Republic.
Protestants outnumber Catholics 2-1 among Northern Ireland's 1.5
million people.
The attack came five days after Northern Ireland's municipal elections
in which Sinn Fein, the IRA's legal political wing, for the first time ran
for office throughout the province. Sinn Fein took 59 of 566 city council
seats contested, substantially more than had been predicted.
FBI arrests suspected Soviet spy
WASHINGTON — The FBI yesterday arrested a retired Navy com
munications specialist on charges of spying for the Soviet Union after he
deposited at an apparent drop-site 129 secret Navy documents concern
ing the deployment and movements of Soviet navy and merchant ships in
the Mediterranean.
In a court affidavit, the FBI said some of the documents appear to
have come from the Nimitz, a U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier, where the
retired officer's son is now stationed.
FBI Director William Webster said retired Chief Warrant Officer
John Anthony Walker, 47, now a private detective in Norfolk, Va., was
arrested before dawn at a motel in Rockville, Md., a Washington suburb,
after FBI agents confiscated a package containing the classified Navy
documents.
Walker retired in 1976 after 20 years service. His son was identified as
Michael Lance Walker, a yeoman third class.
FBI spokesman Bill Baker said it appeared that Walker earlier had
successfully delivered information to the Soviets. He said this conclusion
was based on the use of a so-called "dead drop," a common spy tech
nique where information is left in a secluded spot to be picked up later
by another agent.
A letter among the confiscated documents said, "This delivery con
sists of material from 'S' and is similar to the previously supplied ma
terial. The quantity is limited, unfortunately, due to his operating
schedule and the increased security prior to deployment. His ship
departed in early March and they operated extensively just prior to
deployment." according to the FBI. The Nimitz deployed in early
March.
The FBI said the documents were believed to have been placed by
Walker in a wooded area of rural Montgomery County, Md., which is
near Washington.
Pope urges 'ban' on terrorism
BRUSSELS, Belgium — Pope John Paul II yesterday called for an
end to torture and imprisonment of political dissidents and said
"terrorism must be absolutely banned, by a pact binding all nations."
As he neared the end of his 11-day journey through the Netherlands,
Luxembourg and Belgium, the pope also told infertile couples to avoid
scientific "manipulations" in their attempts to have children — a refer
ence to so-called test-tube babies.
In a speech to King Baudouin and Oueen Fabiola, members of the
Belgian Parliament and government and Brussels-based foreign
diplomats, he listed several "fundamental, inalienable rights."
" These rights include, of course, the respect of human life, whatever
its stage of development, from conception to old age, including the
respect for the human embryo." he told his audience of 850, gathered in
a hall that forms part of the palace's spectacular greenhouses.
The pontiff declared the human embryo "must not be submitted to ex
periments as if it were an object." Such experiments, he said, violate
"the dignity of the human individual."
His comments appeared aimed at scientists' increasingly complex ex
periments growing embryos for infertile women. Some physicians have
sought to perform experiments on embryos to chart human biological
development.
The Vatican opposes the in vitro fertilization process used for "test
tube" babies, and the use of frozen embryos to produce children.
On his current trip, which ends today, the pontiff has reaffirmed
church teaching on sexual morality, saying it will remain the Vatican
standard "for all time."
In renewing his appeal to end the East-West arms race. John Paul also
called on nations to reduce "the investments in arms of mass extermina
tion."
Yesterday afternoon he made the first papal visit to the headquarters
of the 10-nation Common Market, a star-shaped building that has
become a symbol of Western Europe's post-World War II prosperity.
Repeating themes he raised on Sunday, John Paul issued ringing calls
for the defense of human rights and greater social justice.
