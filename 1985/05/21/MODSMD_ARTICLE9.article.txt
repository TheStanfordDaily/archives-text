# Striking pilots resume bargaining
## 
### 
CHICAGO — Negotiators for
United Airlines and its 5,000 striking
pilots returned to the bargaining table
yesterday, and a federal mediator
said the atmosphere was positive as
both sides tried to resolve the four
day walkout against the nation's larg
est airline.
Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation
Administration reported numerous
incidents of pilots from other airlines
interfering with radio transmissions
between nonstriking United pilots
and air traffic controllers.
United, which usually logs 1,550
flights a day, planned 207 departures
systemwide yesterday. The airline has
advertised for new, experienced
pilots and said it was processing 5,500
applications.
In the bargaining session, Helen
Witt, head of the National Mediation
Board, said during a break that the
atmosphere yesterday was "positive"
and"the people came to talk."
Air Line Pilots Association
negotiator Bill Brashear described
the brief discussion as "very busines
slike and cordial."
Company and union representa
tives met with mediators in the morn
ing to lay down ground rules for fur
ther discussions. The mediators later
met separately with the company and
union.
"We have only one issue. It's a
one-issue negotiation," said Air Line
Pilots Association negotiator Bill
Bashear before meeting with Helen
Witt, head of the National Mediation
Board, and board negotiator Harold
Colliander.
Bashear was referring to the two
tier wage system sought by United,
which would apply a lower wage scale

to new hires. The proposal is vehe
mently opposed by the union, which
contends it would create "second
class" workers and potentially dan
gerous dissension in the cockpit.
"We want to do whatever we can to
reach a cost-competitive agreement
with our pilots," said United spokes
man Tom Germuska.
The airline, whose pilots earn an
average of $86,000 a year, says it
needs the two-tiered system to com
pete with airlines that pay less.
The strike began early Friday, and
yesterday's meeting marked the first
resumption of discussion.
Bashear declined to characterize it
as a resumption of formal negotia
tions, but said. "That's what the
board is planning."
United spokesman Dan Sheehy
called the meeting a formal resump
tion of "face-to-face" negotiations.
The talks were being held about
two miles from United's Chicago
headquarters, where pilots were pick
eting.
United pilots, whose last strike was
in 1951, had worked without a con
tract since April 1984.
United has said it will soon begin
hiring "permanent replacements" for
the strikers. They are being hired un
der a special plan that would pay cap
tains $75,000 a year and Ist Officers
$50,000.
Meanwhile, FAA Administrator
Donald Engen told the Air Line
Pilots Association that interference
with transmissions could jeopardize
air travelers, and warned of possible
criminal penalties if the incidents
continue.
