House dispute settled

WASHINGTON — House Democratic
leaders compromised among themselves yester
day and agreed to support a watered-down call
for a minimum tax on corporations but to leave
details of the tax out of the 1986 federal budget.
The agreement averted a major floor show
down and appeared to remove the last remaining
obstacle to expected House approval later in the
week of a Democrat-drafted $56 billion package
of spending cuts.
Democratic leaders had been deeply divided
over whether to put a popular proposed mini
mum corporate tax — which could help trim the
federal deficit by as much as $20 billion next year
— into the deficit-reduction package the House
will begin to debate today.
The compromise, agreed to by House Speaker
Thomas "Tip" O'Neill and Majority Leader Jim
Wright — who had been on opposite sides of the
controversy — leaves details of the minimum tax
to the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee.
And, it leaves open the question of whether
revenues from the minimum corporate tax should
be applied toward trimming the deficit or to re
ducing tax rates for individual taxpayers.

Debate on the nearly $1 trillion 1986 federal
budget is scheduled to begin in the House on
today, with a final vote expected by late tomor
row or Friday.
Firm defrauds military
WASHINGTON — A California company
and two of its officers were charged with mail
fraud yesterday for selling allegedly inferior steel
products to the military for use in aircraft, the
Justice Department said.
District International Supply Co. Inc., of Costa
Mesa, was charged with 15 counts of mail fraud,
as was its president, Donald Bigalke, 53, of Gar
den Grove, and the vice president, Timothy
Bigalke, 30, of Newport Beach.
The indictments were returned by a federal
grand jury in Los Angeles. Justice Department
officials also filed a civil complaint in federal
court there seeking more than $1.1 million from
the Bigalkes and the company.
The complaint alleges that the defendants con
spired to defraud the Defense Department by
substituting inferior and substandard steel in

place of steel specified in their military contracts.
U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner said in announc
ing the charges, "Illegal substitution of inferior
and below spec products is one type of defense
contractor fraud that will not be tolerated in any
form."
The alloy steel was for uses such as aircraft ex
haust manifolds, jet engine parts and fire walls,
the government said. At least some of the steel
was for use in a B-52 jet bomber.
Use of substandard steel "potentially
jeopardizes the life and safety of military person
nel because welded joints can fail catastrophi
cally without warning," the government said in
legal documents.
Market advances
NEW YORK — The stock market's blue chips
extended their record advance yesterday, but
prices overall finished mixed in active trading.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose
4.82 to a record high 1,309.70 after spurting
nearly 20 points Monday to climb above 1,300
for the first time.
