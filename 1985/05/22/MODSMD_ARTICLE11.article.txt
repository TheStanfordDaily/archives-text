Water plan approved
SACRAMENTO — A $900 million ballot
plan by the author of the ill-fated Peripheral
Canal to break California's decades-long water
impasse was approved yesterday by a key Senate
committee.
The proposal, by Sen. Ruben Ayala. would
provide state bond money to purchase water
from the water-rich federal Central Valleys Proj
ect to maintain water quality in the Sacramento-
San Joaquin Delta. Once that protection is
assured, under Ayala"s proposal, northern water
exports could be increased through the state
aqueduct to the San Joaquin Valley and Southern
California.
His measure goes hand-in-hand with a state
federal agreement, which has yet to be ratified by
Congress, that could provide 400,000 acre feet of
water annually by 19HK. An acre-foot is about
the amount of water used by a family of four in
one year, Like Avala's bill, the state-federal pact
also provides protections for the Delta, which are
critical in times of drought.
Ayala (D-Chino). the author of the $1.5 bil
lion Peripheral Canal rejected by voters in 1982.

said his latest measure "contains no new con
struction." and promised members of the Senate
Agriculture and Water Committee that he was
not attempting to build new water transfer
facilities. Ayala is chairman of the committee.
The bill. SB2IO, was approved in a 6-1 vote
and sent to its next legislative hurdle — a Senate
fiscal committee, where it may be whittled down.
Under another water proposal, in some ways
similar to Avala's, was unveiled earlier yesterday,
areas that need water could buy it from water
rich districts and avoid paying for expensive new
water projects.
"Water trading works, it's economically bene
ficial to buyers and sellers, it's environmentally
safe and can be done without building expensive
projects that cost billions of dollars and take
years." Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-
Scpulveda) said at a news conference.
Mexican cop murdered

a summons, said David Bolanos Camara, com
