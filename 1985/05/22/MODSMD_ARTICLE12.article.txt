## Proposed computer uses light to process data 
### CHRIS HAQQ 
Imagine sitting down with a personal robot that can
converse with you about the latest baseball game while it
searches databases to find and read references for your
term paper. The robot might interrupt you to tell you that
it had spotted the pizza delivery car, and then remind you
of where you last left your wallet.
It such a robot were to exist, it would have to rely on
flexible, high-speed computer programs important to ar
tificial intelligence, machine vision and communication.
With current computer hardware, these programs will not
work quickly, if at all.
However, researchers at Stanford, led by Electrical En
gineering Prof. Joseph Goodman, and other groups
around the country are beginning to develop hardware
with the potential to make the high-speed programs
feasible.
The new hardware uses beams of light instead of elec
trical connections. In the long term, optical computers
may be able to execute a trillion functions per second, a
rate 5,000 times faster than that of current machines.
The Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) of high-speed
electronic gates — the diodes and transistors etched in
silicon or gallium arsenide — is expected to lead to a se
vere crisis in the engineering of faster devices.
The crunch is expected to occur in the movement of
electrons between the high-speed gates. This is due to the
small size of the conducting elements, which increases
resistance to electron flow. The time needed to charge the
chip also slows down electron movement.
As a result, the speed of electron movement in current
computers is far below the speed of light.
Not only is the actual speed of transmission several or
ders of magnitude slower, but electromagnetic effects in
current computers can also lead to what electronics desig
ners call crosstalk, or noise.

When electrons move through a wire, they create a
magnetic field. This field can in turn influence other elec
trons in other wires, disturbing their movement. This phe
nomenon, known as "inductance," gives rise to the noise.
According to Goodman, optical connections have two
special advantages. One is that light beams are not suscep
tible to inductance. There is no crosstalk.
The other advantage is that light photons, unlike elec
trons, can pass through each other without interference.
An ordinary optical lens is a familiar example of this,
Goodman explained. A point of light on one side of the
lens comes into focus at a specific point on the opposite
side. If a second point of light is added at a different posi
tion, it will come into focus on the opposite side in a dif
ferent place.
Thus, an optical computer theoretically could route
many connections through each other using a single lens.
Taking advantage of this optical flexibility would free
computer architecture from the current constraint of
having gates connect only to nearest neighbors.
Not only conventional connections between elements of
a computer are susceptible to optical innovation. The
gates that process the communicated signals may be
redesigned as well.
New gates would depend on "optical bistability," a
recently discovered property of certain materials.
Some materials are differentially transparent to light of
different wavelengths, or colors. For example, a material
might transmit red, yellow and blue light, but little or no
light of other colors.
More rarely, some materials — those with optical bis
tability — will change their transparency when they are
subject to a special condition. In the second state of such
materials, transparency might now peak at orange, green
