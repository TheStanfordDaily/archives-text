## Proposed computer uses light to process data 
### CHRIS HAQQ 
Imagine sitting down with a personal robot that can
converse with you about the latest baseball game while it
searches databases to find and read references for your
term paper. The robot might interrupt you to tell you that
it had spotted the pizza delivery car, and then remind you
of where you last left your wallet.
It such a robot were to exist, it would have to rely on
flexible, high-speed computer programs important to ar
tificial intelligence, machine vision and communication.
With current computer hardware, these programs will not
work quickly, if at all.
However, researchers at Stanford, led by Electrical En
gineering Prof. Joseph Goodman, and other groups
around the country are beginning to develop hardware
with the potential to make the high-speed programs
feasible.
The new hardware uses beams of light instead of elec
trical connections. In the long term, optical computers
may be able to execute a trillion functions per second, a
rate 5,000 times faster than that of current machines.
The Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) of high-speed
electronic gates — the diodes and transistors etched in
silicon or gallium arsenide — is expected to lead to a se
vere crisis in the engineering of faster devices.
The crunch is expected to occur in the movement of
electrons between the high-speed gates. This is due to the
small size of the conducting elements, which increases
resistance to electron flow. The time needed to charge the
chip also slows down electron movement.
As a result, the speed of electron movement in current
computers is far below the speed of light.
Not only is the actual speed of transmission several or
ders of magnitude slower, but electromagnetic effects in
current computers can also lead to what electronics desig
ners call crosstalk, or noise.

When electrons move through a wire, they create a
magnetic field. This field can in turn influence other elec
trons in other wires, disturbing their movement. This phe
nomenon, known as "inductance," gives rise to the noise.
According to Goodman, optical connections have two
special advantages. One is that light beams are not suscep
tible to inductance. There is no crosstalk.
The other advantage is that light photons, unlike elec
trons, can pass through each other without interference.
An ordinary optical lens is a familiar example of this,
Goodman explained. A point of light on one side of the
lens comes into focus at a specific point on the opposite
side. If a second point of light is added at a different posi
tion, it will come into focus on the opposite side in a dif
ferent place.
Thus, an optical computer theoretically could route
many connections through each other using a single lens.
Taking advantage of this optical flexibility would free
computer architecture from the current constraint of
having gates connect only to nearest neighbors.
Not only conventional connections between elements of
a computer are susceptible to optical innovation. The
gates that process the communicated signals may be
redesigned as well.
New gates would depend on "optical bistability," a
recently discovered property of certain materials.
Some materials are differentially transparent to light of
different wavelengths, or colors. For example, a material
might transmit red, yellow and blue light, but little or no
light of other colors.
More rarely, some materials — those with optical bis
tability — will change their transparency when they are
subject to a special condition. In the second state of such
materials, transparency might now peak at orange, green

and purple instead of red, yellow and blue.
The shift in transparency allows the construction of
gates that may be open or closed, on or off.
A hypothetical gate — shown in the illustration —
could be made from an optically bistable material
sandwiched between partially reflective mirrors.
On one side the gate is illuminated by red light. If this
gate, called an etalon, is normally transparent to red light,
it would be "on" under normal circumstances. Now if the
bistable material receives an input that causes it to change
to the second state, no red light will go through, and the
gate will be off.
The optical gate just described is a simple on-off switch,
but when used with multiple wavelengths, or with several
other etalons, more complex signal processing schemes
could be devised.
I heoretically, optical gates are able to switch states in
as short a time as one-trillionth of a second or less. Cur
rently, however, they are scarcely past the conceptual
stage of design.
While a chip built around such technology would be
fast, it would not necessarily be smaller. Also, optical con

nections and devices produce a lot of heat. Goodman
identifies this factor as the greatest problem of the tech
nology. Engineers must find a way to cool optical gates
and interconnections so that the chips will not melt.
Goodman's research at Stanford centers on optical
communication tracts rather than gates. The Stanford
group currently is developing a device it hopes will elimi
nate a problem of high-speed computer chips known as
"clock skew."
Every chip, and every subunit of a chip, must act in
synchrony with each other. Clock skew arises from the
slow transmission time of the clock signal that attempts to
keep all devices working together.
When running at very high speeds, some parts of a cir
cuit or system receive the same state of the clock signal at
different times. In this condition the computer is unable to
process information in a reliable way; it would have the
silicon equivalent of mental confusion.
Goodman's group hopes to solve the problem of clock
skew by using holograms to distribute the clock signal
optically.
A hologram is a three-dimensional record of an image.
It is encoded as a diffraction grating arising from the inter
ference of two beams of laser light, one reflecting off the
object to be recorded and the other a reference beam.
Whenever the hologram is re-illuminated by the refer

ence beam, the image can be seen in three-dimensions.
Goodman and his colleagues use holograms to record
points of light instead of images of conventional objects.
The three-dimensional pattern of light spots could be used
to interconnect elements of a computer system in various
arrangements.
If re-illumination is done with a clock pulse, instead of a
reference beam, the points in space recorded on the
hologram will also receive a focused clock pulse and with
minimal time delay.
The holograms ultimately used in computers will be
very different from the familiar type described above.
Using materials with special properties, the diffraction
pattern created can be continually changed. Normal opti
cal holograms, in contrast, can be recorded only once.
The new holographic materials can be erased and
rerecorded in about the time that television frames are
changed — every thirtieth of a second.
This means that a holographic computer could totally
re-arrange its pattern of interconnection in an instant.

Thirty different computers could exist every second.
This plastic feature would allow very sophisticated com
puter programs to be run. In some situations a simple
computation may have to be performed once in a while,
but it would run at very high speed.
Currently, there is no good way to program a computer
to perform such a task. With new plastic devices, a differ
ent computer could be available to run every different
program or subprogram.
Nevertheless, supercomputer manufacturers need not
go into retirement yet. Optical elements are going to take
many years to implement, assuming they turn out to be
practical.
If research on optical hardware is successful, the
machines created may permit robots to emulate the com
plicated motion of the human torso in walking, to analyse
and synthesize speech well enough to converse freely, and
to perform sophisticated image processing in order to
have accurate three-dimensional sight.


The bistable material can transmit light in one of two states. In the first, it is transparent to red, yellow and
blue. In the second, it has shifted right, being transparent to orange, green and purple now.

tible to inductance. There is no crosstalk.
The other advantage is that light photons, unlike elec
trons, can pass through each other without interference.
An ordinary optical lens is a familiar example of this,
Goodman explained. A point of light on one side of the
lens comes into focus at a specific point on the opposite
side. If a second point of light is added at a different posi
tion, it will come into focus on the opposite side in a dif
ferent place.
Thus, an optical computer theoretically could route
many connections through each other using a single lens.
Taking advantage of this optical flexibility would free
computer architecture from the current constraint of
having gates connect only to nearest neighbors.
Not only conventional connections between elements of
a computer are susceptible to optical innovation. The
gates that process the communicated signals may be
redesigned as well.
New gates would depend on "optical bistability," a
recently discovered property of certain materials.
Some materials are differentially transparent to light of
different wavelengths, or colors. For example, a material
might transmit red, yellow and blue light, but little or no
light of other colors.
More rarely, some materials — those with optical bis
tability — will change their transparency when they are
subject to a special condition. In the second state of such
materials, transparency might now peak at orange, green

and purple instead of red, yellow and blue.
The shift in transparency allows the construction of
gates that may be open or closed, on or off.
A hypothetical gate — shown in the illustration —
could be made from an optically bistable material
sandwiched between partially reflective mirrors.
On one side the gate is illuminated by red light. If this
gate, called an etalon, is normally transparent to red light,
it would be "on" under normal circumstances. Now if the
bistable material receives an input that causes it to change
to the second state, no red light will go through, and the
gate will be off.
The optical gate just described is a simple on-off switch,
but when used with multiple wavelengths, or with several
other etalons, more complex signal processing schemes
could be devised.
I heoretically, optical gates are able to switch states in
as short a time as one-trillionth of a second or less. Cur
rently, however, they are scarcely past the conceptual
stage of design.
While a chip built around such technology would be
fast, it would not necessarily be smaller. Also, optical con

nections and devices produce a lot of heat. Goodman
identifies this factor as the greatest problem of the tech
nology. Engineers must find a way to cool optical gates
and interconnections so that the chips will not melt.
Goodman's research at Stanford centers on optical
communication tracts rather than gates. The Stanford
group currently is developing a device it hopes will elimi
nate a problem of high-speed computer chips known as
"clock skew."
Every chip, and every subunit of a chip, must act in
synchrony with each other. Clock skew arises from the
slow transmission time of the clock signal that attempts to
keep all devices working together.
When running at very high speeds, some parts of a cir
cuit or system receive the same state of the clock signal at
different times. In this condition the computer is unable to
process information in a reliable way; it would have the
silicon equivalent of mental confusion.
Goodman's group hopes to solve the problem of clock
skew by using holograms to distribute the clock signal
optically.
A hologram is a three-dimensional record of an image.
It is encoded as a diffraction grating arising from the inter
ference of two beams of laser light, one reflecting off the
object to be recorded and the other a reference beam.
Whenever the hologram is re-illuminated by the refer

ence beam, the image can be seen in three-dimensions.
Goodman and his colleagues use holograms to record
points of light instead of images of conventional objects.
The three-dimensional pattern of light spots could be used
to interconnect elements of a computer system in various
arrangements.
If re-illumination is done with a clock pulse, instead of a
reference beam, the points in space recorded on the
hologram will also receive a focused clock pulse and with
minimal time delay.
The holograms ultimately used in computers will be
very different from the familiar type described above.
Using materials with special properties, the diffraction
pattern created can be continually changed. Normal opti
cal holograms, in contrast, can be recorded only once.
The new holographic materials can be erased and
rerecorded in about the time that television frames are
changed — every thirtieth of a second.
This means that a holographic computer could totally
re-arrange its pattern of interconnection in an instant.

Thirty different computers could exist every second.
This plastic feature would allow very sophisticated com
puter programs to be run. In some situations a simple
computation may have to be performed once in a while,
but it would run at very high speed.
Currently, there is no good way to program a computer
to perform such a task. With new plastic devices, a differ
ent computer could be available to run every different
program or subprogram.
Nevertheless, supercomputer manufacturers need not
go into retirement yet. Optical elements are going to take
many years to implement, assuming they turn out to be
practical.
If research on optical hardware is successful, the
machines created may permit robots to emulate the com
plicated motion of the human torso in walking, to analyse
and synthesize speech well enough to converse freely, and
to perform sophisticated image processing in order to
have accurate three-dimensional sight.


The bistable material can transmit light in one of two states. In the first, it is transparent to red, yellow and
blue. In the second, it has shifted right, being transparent to orange, green and purple now.


Two independent light signals can pass through each other and be refocused on the other side of a lens
Imagine sitting down with a personal robot that can
converse with you about the latest baseball game while it
searches databases to find and read references for your
term paper. The robot might interrupt you to tell you that
it had spotted the pizza delivery car, and then remind you
of where you last left your wallet.
It such a robot were to exist, it would have to rely on
flexible, high-speed computer programs important to ar
tificial intelligence, machine vision and communication.
With current computer hardware, these programs will not
work quickly, if at all.
However, researchers at Stanford, led by Electrical En
gineering Prof. Joseph Goodman, and other groups
around the country are beginning to develop hardware
with the potential to make the high-speed programs
feasible.
The new hardware uses beams of light instead of elec
trical connections. In the long term, optical computers
may be able to execute a trillion functions per second, a
rate 5,000 times faster than that of current machines.
The Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) of high-speed
electronic gates — the diodes and transistors etched in
silicon or gallium arsenide — is expected to lead to a se
vere crisis in the engineering of faster devices.
The crunch is expected to occur in the movement of
electrons between the high-speed gates. This is due to the
small size of the conducting elements, which increases
resistance to electron flow. The time needed to charge the
chip also slows down electron movement.
As a result, the speed of electron movement in current
computers is far below the speed of light.
Not only is the actual speed of transmission several or
ders of magnitude slower, but electromagnetic effects in
current computers can also lead to what electronics desig
ners call crosstalk, or noise.

When electrons move through a wire, they create a
magnetic field. This field can in turn influence other elec
trons in other wires, disturbing their movement. This phe
nomenon, known as "inductance," gives rise to the noise.
According to Goodman, optical connections have two
special advantages. One is that light beams are not suscep
tible to inductance. There is no crosstalk.
