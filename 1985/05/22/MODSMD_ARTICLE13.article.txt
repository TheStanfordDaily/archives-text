# Improved testing of computer chips

Researchers at Stanford's Center for
Reliable Computing are working on improv
ing the self-testing capabilities of computer
chips. As the cost of testing computer chips
for faults begins to rise above the cost of ac
tual chip production, the need to develop
more cost-efficent methods has become
clear, explained Edward McCluskey, direc
tor of the center and professor of electrical
engineering and computer science.
The inclusion of circuitry on the chip is
providing a solution to the spiraling testing
costs. The equipment used for on-chip
tesing is called "built-in self test (BIST),"
McCluskey said. Researchers at the center
are working on the development of BIST
structures and BIST testing techniques.
Each silicon chip is on a wafer, a plate
usually containing a number of chips, and
must undergo testing. Conventional meth
ods use external machinery to run tests on
the chip. This process involves automatic
testing equipment (ATE) that is very expen
sive to produce, McCluskey said. Some
ATE equipment more than $500,000
for each testing unit.
The diversity of chips now available has
made it very difficult for testers to remain on
top of the state-of-the-art chips, McCluskey
said.
The ability to get devices of increasingly
smaller size on a chip is making it harder to
develop external testing tools that can
thoroughly check all the circuitry on a chip.
"Since the development of Very Large Scale
Integration techniques (VLSI), the charac
ter of computer chips has changed greatly,"
McCluskey explained. The VLSI techniques
make it possible to have a large number of
devices on a chip.
This capacity for devices is useful for the
incorporation of self-testing devices that are
additional circuits built into the chip. This

process is cost effective, especially when
compared to the high cost of the ATE
equipment. "It appears that most of the
functions of the expensive ATE equipment
can be replaced and incorporated into the
chip's design," said McCluskey.
The self-testing techniques, however, do
not reduce the complexity of the testing
process itself. Testing chips is becoming
much more difficult as increasing numbers
of components in the chip need to be tested.
To better conceptualize the computer
chip and the difficulties involved with this
research, McCluskey and his research assis
tant, Dorothy Andrews, created a number
of analogies. An important concept is that a
chip can be either a computer itself or
"computer pieces," very specialized hard
ware packed very tightly by VLSI tech
niques to control only one aspect of the sys
tem.
The VLSI techniques have made available
many highly specialized chips, creating
problems because no one testing techique is
specific enough to handle these specializa
tions.
McCluskey described a possible computer
chip used for cryptography. This chip had
10,000 devices linked by 200 connections to
the outside world. The number of connec
tions is smaller by orders of magnitude than
the number of devices in the basic relation
ship between devices and connections.
Although each device must be examined
and checked for proper function, the only
method to check the devices is to go through
one of the 200 connections, making the test
ing of computer chips very difficult.
An analogy developed by McCluskey and
Andrews was that of a naval armory.
"Imagine that there were 10,000 men in an
armory and the only way to monitor them
would be to look through one of the 200
portholes on the walls. If you had to check
that each soldier has the proper uniform on

and that none of them has died of heat ex
haustion it becomes a very difficult and ex
pensive process," McCluskey said.
The limited number of conduits through
which information can be obtained is the
main difficulty of testing chips, McCluskey
expalined.
The BIST technique is analogous to
placing observers within the armory to
maintain watch on the soldiers. However,
using the example of the cryptography chip,
it is clearly not enough to just observe the
workers, there needs to be a check on their
ability to perform the proper calculations.
The problems that the observers give to
the soldiers are called test patterns. Much of
the research into BIST techniques centers
on the development of effective test pat
terns. The test pattern has to be comprehen
sive enough to catch a mistake in each of the
various components. The trick is to limit the
number of test patterns necessary to test ef
fectively the machinery, McCluskey said.
Some test patterns can be stored on the
chip itself, but the number of tests that need
to be run far exceeds the storage capacity of
an on-chip tester. To work around this prob
lem, a system that generates test patterns
has to be built onto the chip, McCluskey ex
plained.
The BIST system uses devices that
generate test pattern inputs and provide a
way to evaluate the output responses. "A
random problem generator can be created
easily enough, the difficulty is in calculating
how many problems are necessary,"
McCluskey said.
The relative measure of the efficiency of a
testing system is its fault coverage, the
percentage of faults detected for each class
of fault, explained McCluskey. Fault
coverage percentages are the most impor
tant consideration when reviewing testing


Edward McCluskey, director of the Center for Reliable Computing and professor of elec
trical engineering and computer science, is developing a faster and more cost-efficient
method of testing computer chips for flaws.
strategies, according to McClusky.
Researchers at McClusky's lab are
using two major testing strategies.
Exhaustive testing, the standard pro
cedure with external testing equip
ment, involves giving all possible test
pattern inputs and is a very time
consuming process. A shorter process
is psuedo-exhaustive testing, in which
the circuitry in the chip is segmented
logically rather than physically. Each
segment is tested exhaustively, and
several of the segments can be tested
simultaneously. Psuedo-exhaustive
testing has a high percentage of fault
coverage and has been very success
ful, McCluskey said.
Since the self-test circuitry uses
chip area, there is a decrease in both
the yield of good chips and in the
reliability, McCluskey explained.
"These costs are compensated,
however, by the reduced testing and
maintence cost. The added cost due

to BIST circuitry should be less than
the savings in the life cycle cost in or
der to justify the use of BIST," he
said.
Regarding the future of computer
chips, McCluskey noted the trend in
technological development toward
adding more components on the
chips. Since the ratio of devices to
connections is going up rapidly, ex
ternal access to testing the chips will
be limited by the decreasing number
of connection points and the fact that
smaller circuitry will be more
sensitive, making external testing
methods less favorable, McCluskey
said.
BIST techniques seem to hold a so
lution for future chip developers. Re
search continues at the center by the
RATS (Reliability and Testing Scien
tists) group, to improve the reliability
estimates and produce more reliable
computers. "RATS is one of the larg
est centers for testing computer
reliability in the academic world and
has produced some of the top people
in the field," said one member of the
research team.
