Rock musician Glenn Frey titled his first solo
album "No Fun Aloud," and over the weekend
the Stanford police turned that expression from
a title into a mission. The police shut down three
parties Saturday and Sunday because of excessive
noise and numerous complaints.
The mere fact that the parties were shut down
in the first place is a little disturbing. But even
more disturbing is the seemingly heavy-handed
approach in which the shutdowns occurred.
On Saturday night at the annual Rinc-a-delt
party, the police told organizers shortly after 9
p.m. that they were going to shut down the event.
The organizers said that they tried to reason with
Sgt. Nick Brunot, but that he was a "wall" and
went so far as to say to the drummer of one band,
"You touch those drums and you're going to
jail."
Later, according to on â–  organizer, Brunot
threatened to "slap handcuffs on me and take me
to jail." After the party had broken up, the police
came back to make sure that a stereo had been
turned off.
Shutdowns also occurred at the Delta Upsilon
Hula Party and a Florence Moore field party. The

Hula Party was shut down after a member of the
fraternity was hurt, and the Flo Mo party was
stopped at around 6 p.m. on Sunday.
The police have been unavailable for comment
thus far, but Dean of Residential Education
Norm Robinson spoke with them yesterday to
find out what had happened. According to Rob
inson, the police had received an "unusually high
number of complaints" about the Rinc-a-delt
party and that a number of those complaints had
come from the Barron Park area, a housing com
munity south of the Stanford Industrial Park.
Other witnesses have said that none of the par
ties was particularly louder or wilder than any
typical party. Thus, there are a great many ques
tions that the police should answer: Why didn't
police simply try to reduce the volume of noise?
Why these parties, this weekend, when similar
parties have gone ignored? Were police as threat
ening as witnesses said they were? And if they
were, why?
The police have yet to answer these questions,
and future party-goers and party-planners have a
right to know what they're in for. At this point,
it's all a mystery.
