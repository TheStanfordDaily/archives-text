## STANFORD OUT OF SOUTH AFRICA Board must vote to divest at next meeting 
### 
In its May 14 meeting, the Stanford Board
of Trustees discussed policies regarding the
University's investments in firms that engage
in production in or export to South Africa.
This discussion took place only as a result of
several weeks of protest by the Stanford com
munity concerning Stanford's current invest
ment policy.

VIEWPOINT

Stanford Out ot South Africa (SOSA), the
coalition group which has organized this
protest, appreciates the board's expression of
its own abhorrence of apartheid and its dissat
isfaction with the progress toward ending it,
and we wholeheartedly concur with the
board's acknowledgement that "our current
investment policy is inadequate." Given this
frank admission of the failure of Stanford's
current investment policy, however, SOSA
finds it inexcusable that more concrete and
direct steps have not been taken to change
this policy. SOSA is demanding an immediate
commitment to total divestment as the only
effective solution to changing Stanford's in
vestment policy and ending of apartheid.
The Board of Trustees, despite its acknowl
edgement of the inadequacy of current policy,
concluded that it was not in favor of total
divestment at this time. Instead, it proposes
an alternative plan to effect change in the
apartheid system in South Africa: 1) a modifi
cation of Stanford investment policy and 2)
exploration of new ways to encourage dis
mantling apartheid.
A close examination of the board's state
ment, however, reveals that its response to
the situation is actually designed to deflect at
tention away from Stanford's own invest
ments in South Africa, and that the changing

of Stanford's investment policy is given only
hasty and secondary consideration.
The Board of Trustees maintains that the
best chance of changing the apartheid system
in South Africa would be an approach involv
ing cooperative action among all sectors of so
ciety. This would include the establishment of
a consortium of university and industry
leaders.
The board's suggested action continues to
minimize Stanford's role in ending apartheid.
Further, it continues to minimize Stanford's
current complicity with the South African

regime as a result of our investments there.
Moreover, this call to university and industry
leaders denies the voice and role of the Stan
ford community — students, faculty, staff,
workers — in contributing to the end of the
apartheid system.
SOSA maintains that the first step toward
dismantling apartheid should take place here,
at Stanford, with our divestment from corpo
rations doing business in South Africa. It is in
consistent to believe that we should first

pursue legislative action as a means for in
fluencing apartheid laws in South Africa when
our own policy at Stanford would itself violate
the intent of these actions. Therefore, we
demand that primary consideration be given
to the role which Stanford currently plays in
maintaining the apartheid regime in South
Africa.
The statement of the Board of Trustees re
garding this issue claims that it recognizes the
need for changing Stanford's investment
policy, but the lack of concrete proposals for
change and the absence of any immediate ac-

tions causes us to question its commitment to
this change.
The board has agreed only to consider over
time and to review several aspects of our cur
rent policy. It has offered no proposals for any
concrete action. Moreover, its considerations
are so limited in scope that it neglects to ad
dress the actual role of U.S. corporations in
South Africa and their complicity in main
taining the apartheid system.
The Board of Trustees once again directs

attention to the Sullivan codes as a means for
monitoring behavior of U.S. corporations in
South Africa. Ft has been proven numerous
times, however, that these codes are merely
workplace reforms and are ineffectual and in
adequate in changing the nature of the U.S.
corporate involvement in South Africa, which
is directly linked with the apartheid system.
Moreover, these codes have been disavowed
by their own author, the Rev. Leon Sullivan.
The board also proposes to review the
Committee for Investment Responsibility's
current procedures, including the meaning of
"substantial social injury." Even a cursory
review of U.S. corporate involvement in
South Africa, however, would reveal that the
mere presence of U.S. corporations in South

the South African regime.

Africa constitutes "substantial social injury,"
by lending credibility and confidence to the
oppressive regime. In addition, U.S. corpora
tions provide strategic resources, high-level
technology used for the modernization of
government repression and a revenue base for
the minority regime.
Therefore, SOSA is insisting that the re
sources which have been pledged to prepare a
timely and thorough review of the South
Africa activities of firms in which Stanford in
vests, instead be directed toward the develop
ment of a plan for Stanford's total divestment
from corporations operating in South Africa.
SOSA is currently developing a strategy

consisting of concrete proposals for a total
divestment plan for Stanford. We request that
the University begin drafting its own
proposals for divestment, and that they be
voted on at the June 14 hoard meeting.
We must begin dismantling the apartheid
system with our own divestment from South
Africa, and then we can pursue far-reaching
legislative action. SOSA demands that the
Board of Trustees immediately take the fol
lowing actions:
• Commit to total divestment of stock in any
company operating in South Africa, starting
with immediate divestment of stock in Hitachi
and Motorola.
• Disclose personal investment portfolios of
all board members and require the same for

the vice president of business and finance.
• Establish an open University investment
policy.
• Establish student seats with full member
ship on the Reinvestment Planning Commis
sion.
• Establish eight student seats with full
membership on the Board of Trustees.
• Establish student representation on the
trustees' Select Committee on Investment
Responsibility.
• Support the boycott of companies with sub
sidiaries in South Africa.

the intent of these actions. Therefore, we
demand that primary consideration be given
to the role which Stanford currently plays in

The board has agreed only to consider over
time and to review several aspects of our cur
rent policy. It has offered no proposals for any
concrete action. Moreover, its considerations
are so limited in scope that it neglects to ad
dress the actual role of U.S. corporations in
South Africa and their complicity in main
taining the apartheid system.

attention to the Sullivan codes as a means for

workplace reforms and are ineffectual and in

corporate involvement in South Africa, which
is directly linked with the apartheid system.

by their own author, the Rev. Leon Sullivan.
The board also proposes to review the

Africa constitutes "substantial social injury,"
by lending credibility and confidence to the
oppressive regime. In addition, U.S. corpora
tions provide strategic resources, high-level
technology used for the modernization of
government repression and a revenue base for
the minority regime.
Therefore, SOSA is insisting that the re
sources which have been pledged to prepare a
timely and thorough review of the South
Africa activities of firms in which Stanford in
vests, instead be directed toward the develop
ment of a plan for Stanford's total divestment
from corporations operating in South Africa.
SOSA is currently developing a strategy

consisting of concrete proposals for a total
divestment plan for Stanford. We request that
the University begin drafting its own
proposals for divestment, and that they be
voted on at the June 14 hoard meeting.
We must begin dismantling the apartheid
system with our own divestment from South
Africa, and then we can pursue far-reaching
legislative action. SOSA demands that the
Board of Trustees immediately take the fol
lowing actions:
• Commit to total divestment of stock in any
company operating in South Africa, starting
with immediate divestment of stock in Hitachi
and Motorola.
• Disclose personal investment portfolios of
all board members and require the same for

the vice president of business and finance.
• Establish an open University investment
policy.
• Establish student seats with full member
ship on the Reinvestment Planning Commis
sion.
• Establish eight student seats with full
membership on the Board of Trustees.
• Establish student representation on the
trustees' Select Committee on Investment
Responsibility.
• Support the boycott of companies with sub
sidiaries in South Africa.

In its May 14 meeting, the Stanford Board
of Trustees discussed policies regarding the
University's investments in firms that engage
in production in or export to South Africa.
This discussion took place only as a result of
several weeks of protest by the Stanford com
munity concerning Stanford's current invest
ment policy.

VIEWPOINT

Stanford Out ot South Africa (SOSA), the
coalition group which has organized this
protest, appreciates the board's expression of
its own abhorrence of apartheid and its dissat
isfaction with the progress toward ending it,
and we wholeheartedly concur with the
board's acknowledgement that "our current
investment policy is inadequate." Given this
frank admission of the failure of Stanford's
current investment policy, however, SOSA
finds it inexcusable that more concrete and
direct steps have not been taken to change
this policy. SOSA is demanding an immediate
commitment to total divestment as the only
effective solution to changing Stanford's in
vestment policy and ending of apartheid.
The Board of Trustees, despite its acknowl
edgement of the inadequacy of current policy,
concluded that it was not in favor of total
divestment at this time. Instead, it proposes
an alternative plan to effect change in the
apartheid system in South Africa: 1) a modifi
cation of Stanford investment policy and 2)
exploration of new ways to encourage dis
mantling apartheid.
A close examination of the board's state
ment, however, reveals that its response to
the situation is actually designed to deflect at
tention away from Stanford's own invest
ments in South Africa, and that the changing

of Stanford's investment policy is given only
hasty and secondary consideration.

minimize Stanford's role in ending apartheid.
Further, it continues to minimize Stanford's
