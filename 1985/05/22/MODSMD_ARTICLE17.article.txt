# For trustees, profits outweigh morality
## 
### 
A lot of things were made clear at the forum that
was held by'SOSA and the trustees. University
President Donald Kennedy made it clear that his
idea of "rational discourse" is saying "I'm not con
vinced." Trustee James Ware made it clear that
Stanford's vision of liberation in South Africa is
limited to integrated cafeterias. And Trustee War
ren Christopher made it clear why it took so long to
get the hostages back from Iran.
But the most illuminating speech of all came
from Trustee James Gaithcr. He made the devas
tatingly honest admission that the Board of Trus
tees considers its "principal" responsibility to be to
"preserve and protect and seek the best return
from the assets that we have."
Think of the significance of that statement. He
confirmed what the speakers at "Mandela Free
University" had been arguing for two weeks: that
the highest principle of Stanford's administration is
simply maximization of profits.
Was this really what he meant to say? He went
on to remove all doubt: "I think what I am trying to
say is that our responsibilities, not the merits of the
cause we ore addressing today, may well cause the
Board of Trustees to reach different conclusions
than those that have been advocated before me."
It I understand Gaither's use of the English lang
uage. he's saying that even if divestment is really
the right thing to do. even //divestment wiM. in the
end, help South African blacks throw off the
oppression of apartheid, the trustees will still con
tinue investing in South Africa, because the "merits
of the cause" have to take a back seat to the
"responsibility" of the trustees to maintain a maxi
mum cash flow for the University.
I wo weeks of obfuscation were cleared away by
this speech. Gone were the Sullivan principles, the
progressive role of U.S. corporations, the endorse
ments of Bantustan chieftains. Gone were the as
surances that the University and the protesters dif
fered only on means.
Gaither embraced the position attributed to him
by the most fervent of the Inner Quad agitators:
that financial considerations always take
precedence over morality, even if it means financ
ing our education with the blood of South African*.
During the reign of the Third Reich, a time that
our other president (Ron. not Don) tried un
suceessfully to have relegated to the mythological
past, many American firms had subsidiaries in Ger
many. which were completely integrated into the
Nazi economy.
Would Stanford have invested in those compan
ies which were thus giving material support to Hit
ler? Gaither. to be consistent, would have to say
yes — if slave labor brought a greater return on
Stanford's capital.
It is beside the point, from a moral perspective.

to argue that Stanford will not be hurt by divest
ment. I think we can all agree that freedom for the
prisoners of the Bantustans is more important than
new dorms for undergrads.
But Gaither, speaking on behalf of the trustees,
specifically rules out a moral approach, because
Stanford's foremost commitment is to amass the
greatest possible amount of money.
In that case, it might help to direct him to argu
ments made by financial analysts like Theodore
Brown, who makes the case that a portfolio like
Stanford's could actually maintain or even increase
its current rate of return by divesting from South
Africa-related companies. This is not a radical po
sition; this is the conclusion reached by most of the
studies of the issue.

The highest principle of
Stanford's administration
is simply maximization of
profits.

But perhaps lowered return on investment is not
the kind of financial loss that Stanford is primarily
worried about. Stanford's treasurer. Rodney
Adams, expresses a different fear: "Any companv
we choose to publically chastise would not be too
interested in giving money," he said in a Daily in
terview. adding that "they're diplomatic enough
that they have not stated this explicitly." Adams
seems to feel no such constraints about issuing
veiled threats to the university that he supposedly
serves on behalf of corporate America.
Speaking of supposedly serving Stanford, two of
the companies that have subtly pressured Stanford
not to div est, according to Adams, are Tim ken Co.

and Hewlett-Packard. Timken, of course, is run by
board member William Timken, and Trustee John
Young is president of H-P. One wonders why these
gentlemen, who are supposed to have accepted a
public trust to protect the University, are sneaking
around like thugs, blackmailing Stanford into
knuckling under to their corporations' interests. It
raises strong doubts about the independence of
Stanford as an academic institution, and about the
wisdom of allowing representatives of big business
to become the de facto owners of the University.
Despite Kennedy's snide implications that the
people advocating divestment are over-emotional
and irrational ("I am troubled that rational dis
course about that question seems to have become a
victim of moral urgency"), it is the administration,
not SOSA. that has failed to engage actively in
debate.
But I think students and others who want divest
ment are going to have to admit that if Bishop Tutu
isn't going to persuade Kennedy, no one will. If the
bottom line for the University is the bottom line, as
Gaither indicates, then the board will have to be
shown that the costs of remaining involved in South
Africa outweigh the perceived costs of divestment.
The only University funding source we can have an
effect on is alumni contributions.
These are far from insignificant— the University
took in $113 million in gifts last year. And in the
next few years it wants to take in even more, to ful
fill its grandiose plans for the Centennial.
If we can reduce the amount of money flowing
into Stanford's coffers by, say, 10 percent, we will
have more than outweighed the inflated figure of
$4 million that Adams gives as the cost of divest
ment.
This will require work. A group of seniors has
begun by circulating a petition that pledges to with
hold contributions until Stanford adopts a "morally
acceptable investment policy." A direct-mail cam
paign will have to appeal directly to alumni, and
SOSA should set up an escrow fund to collect con
tributions that will be given to the University when
it divests.
This represents the strongest tactic students have
against the monopoly of power held by the trustees.
But it's more than a tactic; it's basic moral sense. If
Stanford's trustees really see maximization of prof
its as their highest responsibility, then there's no
more reason to donate monev to Stanford than to,
say, IBM.
A lot of people have been contributing under the
mistaken impression that Stanford had some sort of
higher purpose. In order to be worthy of charity,
Stanford is going to have to show some moral lead
ership.

Africa outweigh the perceived costs of divestment.
The only University funding source we can have an
effect on is alumni contributions.
These are far from insignificant— the University
took in $113 million in gifts last year. And in the
next few years it wants to take in even more, to ful
fill its grandiose plans for the Centennial.
If we can reduce the amount of money flowing
into Stanford's coffers by, say, 10 percent, we will
have more than outweighed the inflated figure of
$4 million that Adams gives as the cost of divest
ment.
This will require work. A group of seniors has
begun by circulating a petition that pledges to with
hold contributions until Stanford adopts a "morally
acceptable investment policy." A direct-mail cam
paign will have to appeal directly to alumni, and
SOSA should set up an escrow fund to collect con
tributions that will be given to the University when
it divests.
This represents the strongest tactic students have
against the monopoly of power held by the trustees.
But it's more than a tactic; it's basic moral sense. If
Stanford's trustees really see maximization of prof
its as their highest responsibility, then there's no
more reason to donate monev to Stanford than to,
say, IBM.
A lot of people have been contributing under the
mistaken impression that Stanford had some sort of
higher purpose. In order to be worthy of charity,
Stanford is going to have to show some moral lead
ership.

A lot of things were made clear at the forum that
was held by'SOSA and the trustees. University
President Donald Kennedy made it clear that his
idea of "rational discourse" is saying "I'm not con
vinced." Trustee James Ware made it clear that
Stanford's vision of liberation in South Africa is
limited to integrated cafeterias. And Trustee War
ren Christopher made it clear why it took so long to
get the hostages back from Iran.
But the most illuminating speech of all came
from Trustee James Gaithcr. He made the devas
tatingly honest admission that the Board of Trus
tees considers its "principal" responsibility to be to
"preserve and protect and seek the best return
from the assets that we have."
Think of the significance of that statement. He
confirmed what the speakers at "Mandela Free
University" had been arguing for two weeks: that
the highest principle of Stanford's administration is
simply maximization of profits.
Was this really what he meant to say? He went
on to remove all doubt: "I think what I am trying to
say is that our responsibilities, not the merits of the
cause we ore addressing today, may well cause the
Board of Trustees to reach different conclusions
than those that have been advocated before me."
It I understand Gaither's use of the English lang
uage. he's saying that even if divestment is really
the right thing to do. even //divestment wiM. in the
end, help South African blacks throw off the
oppression of apartheid, the trustees will still con
tinue investing in South Africa, because the "merits
of the cause" have to take a back seat to the
"responsibility" of the trustees to maintain a maxi
mum cash flow for the University.
I wo weeks of obfuscation were cleared away by
this speech. Gone were the Sullivan principles, the
progressive role of U.S. corporations, the endorse
ments of Bantustan chieftains. Gone were the as
surances that the University and the protesters dif
fered only on means.
Gaither embraced the position attributed to him
by the most fervent of the Inner Quad agitators:
that financial considerations always take
precedence over morality, even if it means financ
ing our education with the blood of South African*.
During the reign of the Third Reich, a time that
our other president (Ron. not Don) tried un
suceessfully to have relegated to the mythological
past, many American firms had subsidiaries in Ger
many. which were completely integrated into the
Nazi economy.
Would Stanford have invested in those compan
ies which were thus giving material support to Hit
ler? Gaither. to be consistent, would have to say
yes — if slave labor brought a greater return on
Stanford's capital.
It is beside the point, from a moral perspective.

to argue that Stanford will not be hurt by divest
ment. I think we can all agree that freedom for the
prisoners of the Bantustans is more important than
new dorms for undergrads.
But Gaither, speaking on behalf of the trustees,
specifically rules out a moral approach, because
Stanford's foremost commitment is to amass the
greatest possible amount of money.
In that case, it might help to direct him to argu
ments made by financial analysts like Theodore
Brown, who makes the case that a portfolio like
Stanford's could actually maintain or even increase
its current rate of return by divesting from South
Africa-related companies. This is not a radical po
sition; this is the conclusion reached by most of the
studies of the issue.

The highest principle of
Stanford's administration
is simply maximization of
profits.

But perhaps lowered return on investment is not
the kind of financial loss that Stanford is primarily
worried about. Stanford's treasurer. Rodney
Adams, expresses a different fear: "Any companv
we choose to publically chastise would not be too
interested in giving money," he said in a Daily in
terview. adding that "they're diplomatic enough
that they have not stated this explicitly." Adams
seems to feel no such constraints about issuing
veiled threats to the university that he supposedly
serves on behalf of corporate America.
Speaking of supposedly serving Stanford, two of
the companies that have subtly pressured Stanford
not to div est, according to Adams, are Tim ken Co.

and Hewlett-Packard. Timken, of course, is run by
board member William Timken, and Trustee John
Young is president of H-P. One wonders why these
gentlemen, who are supposed to have accepted a
public trust to protect the University, are sneaking
around like thugs, blackmailing Stanford into
knuckling under to their corporations' interests. It
raises strong doubts about the independence of
Stanford as an academic institution, and about the
wisdom of allowing representatives of big business
to become the de facto owners of the University.
Despite Kennedy's snide implications that the
people advocating divestment are over-emotional
and irrational ("I am troubled that rational dis
course about that question seems to have become a
victim of moral urgency"), it is the administration,
not SOSA. that has failed to engage actively in
debate.
But I think students and others who want divest
ment are going to have to admit that if Bishop Tutu
isn't going to persuade Kennedy, no one will. If the
bottom line for the University is the bottom line, as
Gaither indicates, then the board will have to be
shown that the costs of remaining involved in South
Africa outweigh the perceived costs of divestment.
The only University funding source we can have an
effect on is alumni contributions.
