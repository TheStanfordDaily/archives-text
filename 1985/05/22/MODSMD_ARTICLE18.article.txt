Beware of tellers
Recently, I paid in a check
through an automated teller — and
duly received a transaction record.
Later, I discovered that the appro
priate sum had not been credited to
my statement. After some investiga
tion, the bank informed me that it
had no trace of the check or the
envelope, although an employee
admitted there was a record of the
transaction — and I was essentially
told the onus was on me to demon

strate that I had paid in a check for
the amount stated on my
"transaction record."
Imagine another scenario with
these uscr-friendlv machines. One
withdraws cash and the automated
teller shortchanges you; it seems
that again the bank would put the
onus on the customer to prove this
had happened.
Take care!
