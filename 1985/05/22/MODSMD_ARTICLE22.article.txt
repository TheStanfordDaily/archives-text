# Kepler's celebrates 30 years of books, individualism
## 
### MARY McDEVITT 
In May 1955, Roy Kepler opened
the Peninsula's first paperback
bookstore in a small building on El
Camino Real in Menlo Park.
Working 85 hours a week, Kepler
created a revolutionary bookstore
that came to embody his non-violent,
anti-establishment character and his
dedication to the right of free inquiry.
"It was the most incredible kind of
timing and intelligence," one
Kepler's employee says. By the late
19705, the store had become the larg
est paperback outlet west of the Mis
sissippi.
At the store's original location next
to what now is the Guild Theater,
Kepler's customers included people
who came in late at night while
waiting for a movie to start, recalls Ira
Sandperl, who has worked at Kepler's
for most of the last 29 years.
Now located in the Victoria Lane
shopping center at K2l El Camino
Real, the store is still owned by
pacifist Kepler, who is ill with Parkin
son's disease, although the store's
management gradually has been
handed down to his 26-year-old son,
Clark.
On June 1, Kepler's Books and
Magazines will celebrate its 30th an
niversary with an in-store public
party.
The spirit behind the store "has
always been [to provide a place] late
at night and early in the morning, to
enjoy a good book," Clark Kepler ex
plains.
From the beginning, the atmos
phere was casual and the staff was
friendly. "I was always talking, and
he (Roy Kepler) was always working
.. . and then when he would tell me
to get back to work, I would turn and
see him talking," Sandperl says.
"Somehow it was more than just
having a job."

Kepler, who didn't own a cash reg
ister during the first few years — he
wanted to own hooks and spent his
capital on little else — made change
out of his pockets.
Kepler's soon became an instituion
of the counterculture. The Grateful
Dead, in one of its earlier incarna
tions, used to practice at the store.
Folk singer Joan Baez, a student as
well as a personal and political friend
of Sandperl's, frequented the store
and still comes by occasionally, ac
cording to Sandperl.
In its early months, Kepler's ad
vertised itself as "the home of all
paperbacks." Approximately 4,500
paperbacks were in print at the time.
Now there are some 175.000 and
Kepler's, no longer "the Peninsula's
only complete collection of paper
bound books," must compete with
other local and established
bookstores, including Chimaera
Books and Records and Printers Inc.,
a direct outgrowth of Kepler's, as well
as expanding mainstream chains such
as Waldenbooks, Crown Books and
B. Dalton Booksellers.
Kepler's assistant manager, Ralph
Kohn, says that sales at Kepler's are
steadily increasing and that the store
is prospering.
Printers Inc. employee Ralph Diaz,
who worked at Kepler's during the
1 9705, says that Kepler's and Printers
Inc. "are not that different. . . . We
complement each other."
Four out of the five founders of
Printers Inc. are former Kepler's
employees, according to one Printers
Inc. worker.
Kepler's history, perhaps, makes it
stand out from the other local
bookstores.
According to Betty Sumral, who
recently retired after working at the
store since the early 19605, Kepler's
was "the first to have a sort of coffee

house atmosphere. Anyone whose
family disapproved of them or found
them disgraceful because they were
marching or demonstrating could
come to Kepler's and read and meet
and talk to each other.
"If you had long hair you could
come in — there were places at this
time where you could not even go in
if you had long hair. If you were too
poor to buy a book, you could come

in and read. Anyone, radical or not,
was welcome," Sumral says.
During the 19605, Kepler's pro
vided jobs and draft counseling for
non-violent draft resisters.
Some people apparently did not
like what the store stood for. In late
1968, the store was hit by a series of
shooting, bombing and arson attacks
that shattered windows and caused
several thousand dollars of structural

damage, although no one was hurt.
The terrorists were "a group called
'Christians,' " Sandperl says.
"They first started praying for Roy
Kepler's and then Joan Baez's death.
When they were caught they thought
that they would have a great deal of
support in the community, but they
were very surprised," Sandperl says.
Kepler never pressed charges against
the terrorist group, according to

Sandperl.
Despite death threats, Kepler
remained dedicated to pacifism and
the right to free inquiry. There was
only one book that Kepler and
Sandperl, both strongly against cen
sorship, decided not to stock, accord
ing to Sandperl. "It was 'The Anar
chist's Cookbook," " Sandperl says.

sula's first paperback bookstore, will celebrate its 30th anniversary
with an in-store open party on June 1.

Clark Kepler manages Kepler's Books and Magazines, which is owned
by his father Roy, who founded the store in 1955. Kepler's, the Penin-
"It showed how to make every kind
of destruction device available.
"We had right-wing, left-wing, and
center (books). . . . ['The Anarchist's
Cookbook'] was the one book that
we did not carry," he says. But
Kepler did order it eventually for
someone who came in and wanted it,
Sandperl adds.
Kepler's quickly gained a national
and international reputation for
quality paperbacks.
"We used to get orders from
thousands of miles away," says Nick
Simon, an original employee of
Kepler's who still works part time at
the store. "Someone who had previ
ously been at Stanford would write
from India to get a book. We got our
international reputation because of
Stanford and SRI (SRI Interna
tional)."
Now, four stores and 30 years after
the original Kepler's opening, most

people who know the bookstore's his
tory agree that its international
reputation, if not political image, has
been lost.
"The store hasn't changed, it's just
that there are more (stores like
Kepler's now)," Sumral said. "The
store is the same, but paperbacks are
not a novelty anymore."
English Prof. John L'Heureux, the
head of the Creative Writing Depart
ment and an author, has been familiar
with Kepler's for 13 years and
describes it as "still a very solid
literary bookstore. Kepler's, Printers
Inc. and Chimaera have remained
providers of what most of us at Stan
ford want."
English Prof, and poet Kenneth
Fields, who has gone to Kepler's since
the early 19605, says Kepler's "used
to be the principal bookstore in the
area." Like L'Heureux, Fields says
that today a number of other good
local bookstores exist, including
Chimaera, Wessex, Printers Inc. and
the Stanford Bookstore.
But Kepler's was the first of its
kind. Paperbacks were both a scarcity

and a novelty when the store opened
in 1955. Kepler was then considering
working for a university, but decided
to start a paperback business instead
— against the advice of many of his
friends — because he could have
more "freedom . . . more discussions,
and culture," Sandperl explained.
Kepler's relocated and expanded
over the years, opening stores in Palo
Alto (1962) and Los Altos (1964)
which were closed in the late 1970s
when Roy Kepler became ill. In
1974, the Menlo Park store at 825 El
Camino Real, next door to its current
location, more than doubled it size by
expanding into an old auto body
shop. The floor of the store — cover
ing an expansive 8,000 square feet as
compared to the current store's
5,000 square feet — was marked by
dried grease stains, Simon recalls
fondly.
The store moved into its current lo
cation in the early 1980s because that
is where the landlord wants it, ac
cording to Clark Kepler. The present
store, next to La Petite Boulangerie,
has a modern, quaint — one might

say Yuppie, perhaps even conserva
tive — look from the outside. It is
part ol the decor that the landlord
wants to maintain, according to both
Kohn and Clark Kepler.
Those with nostalgia say they miss
the old store. Kohn does not hide his
affection for the old building. "We try
to dirty up the (new) place a bit,"
Kohn says with a laugh.
When they first moved to the new
store, Kohn remembers discussing
the change with customers. "I joked
we were making a sow's ear out of
our silk purse. We have a silk purse
now and we had a kind of sow's ear
before," he says.
The different look of the new store
may only be deceptive. "The old
store had the appearance of infor
mality. That informality is still here,
but it doesn't appear so much. The
upgrading is sort of contrived," Kohn
says.
The underlying philosophy of
Kepler's has not disappeared.
"Despite the fact that we have car
pet ... we still have people interested
in books."
