# Kepler's celebrates 30 years of books, individualism
## 
### MARY McDEVITT 
In May 1955, Roy Kepler opened
the Peninsula's first paperback
bookstore in a small building on El
Camino Real in Menlo Park.
Working 85 hours a week, Kepler
created a revolutionary bookstore
that came to embody his non-violent,
anti-establishment character and his
dedication to the right of free inquiry.
"It was the most incredible kind of
timing and intelligence," one
Kepler's employee says. By the late
19705, the store had become the larg
est paperback outlet west of the Mis
sissippi.
At the store's original location next
to what now is the Guild Theater,
Kepler's customers included people
who came in late at night while
waiting for a movie to start, recalls Ira
Sandperl, who has worked at Kepler's
for most of the last 29 years.
Now located in the Victoria Lane
shopping center at K2l El Camino
Real, the store is still owned by
pacifist Kepler, who is ill with Parkin
son's disease, although the store's
management gradually has been
handed down to his 26-year-old son,
Clark.
On June 1, Kepler's Books and
Magazines will celebrate its 30th an
niversary with an in-store public
party.
The spirit behind the store "has
always been [to provide a place] late
at night and early in the morning, to
enjoy a good book," Clark Kepler ex
plains.
From the beginning, the atmos
phere was casual and the staff was
friendly. "I was always talking, and
he (Roy Kepler) was always working
.. . and then when he would tell me
to get back to work, I would turn and
see him talking," Sandperl says.
"Somehow it was more than just
having a job."

Kepler, who didn't own a cash reg
ister during the first few years — he
wanted to own hooks and spent his
capital on little else — made change
out of his pockets.
Kepler's soon became an instituion
of the counterculture. The Grateful
Dead, in one of its earlier incarna
tions, used to practice at the store.
Folk singer Joan Baez, a student as
well as a personal and political friend
of Sandperl's, frequented the store
and still comes by occasionally, ac
cording to Sandperl.
In its early months, Kepler's ad
vertised itself as "the home of all
paperbacks." Approximately 4,500
paperbacks were in print at the time.
Now there are some 175.000 and
Kepler's, no longer "the Peninsula's
only complete collection of paper
bound books," must compete with
other local and established
bookstores, including Chimaera
Books and Records and Printers Inc.,
a direct outgrowth of Kepler's, as well
as expanding mainstream chains such
as Waldenbooks, Crown Books and
B. Dalton Booksellers.
Kepler's assistant manager, Ralph
Kohn, says that sales at Kepler's are
steadily increasing and that the store
is prospering.
Printers Inc. employee Ralph Diaz,
who worked at Kepler's during the
1 9705, says that Kepler's and Printers
Inc. "are not that different. . . . We
complement each other."
Four out of the five founders of
Printers Inc. are former Kepler's
employees, according to one Printers
Inc. worker.
Kepler's history, perhaps, makes it
stand out from the other local
bookstores.
According to Betty Sumral, who
recently retired after working at the
store since the early 19605, Kepler's
was "the first to have a sort of coffee

house atmosphere. Anyone whose
family disapproved of them or found
them disgraceful because they were
marching or demonstrating could
come to Kepler's and read and meet
and talk to each other.
"If you had long hair you could
come in — there were places at this
time where you could not even go in
if you had long hair. If you were too
poor to buy a book, you could come

in and read. Anyone, radical or not,
was welcome," Sumral says.
During the 19605, Kepler's pro
vided jobs and draft counseling for
non-violent draft resisters.
Some people apparently did not
like what the store stood for. In late
1968, the store was hit by a series of
shooting, bombing and arson attacks
that shattered windows and caused
several thousand dollars of structural

damage, although no one was hurt.
The terrorists were "a group called
'Christians,' " Sandperl says.
"They first started praying for Roy
Kepler's and then Joan Baez's death.
When they were caught they thought
that they would have a great deal of
support in the community, but they
were very surprised," Sandperl says.
Kepler never pressed charges against
the terrorist group, according to

Sandperl.
Despite death threats, Kepler
remained dedicated to pacifism and
the right to free inquiry. There was
only one book that Kepler and
Sandperl, both strongly against cen
sorship, decided not to stock, accord
ing to Sandperl. "It was 'The Anar
chist's Cookbook," " Sandperl says.
