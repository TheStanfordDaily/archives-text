## Golfers tee off at NCAA championships No. 6 women could contend 
### KEN STEVENS Staff sportswriter 
Judging by its current No. 6 na
tional ranking, the Stanford women's
golf team figures to be a factor at this
week's NCAA championships in
Cape Cod, Mass. At least Cardinal
Coach Tim Baldwin thinks so.
"I'm counting on very solid perfor
mances out of (Kathleen) McCarthy,
(Kathy) Kostas and (Anna)
Oxenstierna, and if Trish
(McGonigle) and Kay (Cornelius)
play well, we have a hell of a shot at
the championship," Baldwin said.
The tournament, which will be
played on the 6,088-yard par-73 New
Seabury Blue Course, begins today
and will continue through Saturday.
Baldwin said that Florida, Tulsa
and Arizona State — the top three
teams in the nation — are the "real
favorites" this week and are a notch
ahead of the rest of the field. Follow
ing these three teams are "eight
teams that are really evenly
matched," according to Baldwin. In
cluded in this group are defending
NCAA champion Miami, San Jose
State, Stanford, Georgia, New
Mexico, UCLA, Florida Interna
tional and Brigham Young.
The Cardinal will send a relatively
inexperienced team into action today.
McCarthy and Kostas both competed
in the championships last year, when
the Cardinal finished in ninth place.
However, Cornelius, McGonigle and
Oxenstierna are all freshmen, com
peting in their first NCAA champion
ships.
Baldwin does not believe that the
lack of experience will be a detrimen
tal factor for the Cardinal women.
The NCAA championship tourna
ment is "a pretty big thing for all of
them, but it's a big thing for all of the
teams," Baldwin said.
The Cardinal will look to
McCarthy, the No. 5-ranked woman
golfer in the nation, for a big tourna
ment this week. In last year's cham
pionships, McCarthy rebounded from
a poor first round to tie for fifth place
in the individual competition as a
freshman. She finished just three
shots back of tournament champion
Cindy Scheyer of Georgia and
received All-America honors.
This season, McCarthy has excelled

once again, finishing among the top
six in eight of the 11 tournaments in
which she has competed. She broke
the Stanford Golf Course record in
winning the Stanford Invitational and
finished in second place at the Lady
Sun Devil and the California Inter
collegiate.
Baldwin said that McCarthy will be
one of the favorites to win the indi
vidual championship this week.
"Kathleen is playing as good now as
she ever has in her life," he said. "She
has no basic weaknesses in her
game."
McCarthy's top challengers for the
individual championship, according
to Baldwin, are Florida's No. 1-
ranked Deb Richard, Texas' Sherri
Stienhauser, Tulsa's Jody Rosenthal
— the British amateur champion —
and ASU's Heather Farr.

Playing behind McCarthy in the
No. 2 position for the Cardinal will be
Oxenstierna. After competing in
Europe with the Swedish World Cup
Team in the fall, missing the fall
season here, Oxenstierna had trouble
adjusting to playing in the United
States. She came on strong toward
the end of the season, however, and
garnered honorable mention All-
Western Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion honors.
"Anna had her ups and downs this
season, but right now she's putting
the whole package together,"
Baldwin said. "The New Seabury
course is the type of course she's used
to playing — on the ocean where you
could encounter winds and rough
weather."

Junior Kathy Kostas will contribute some valuable experience to this
year's youthful NCAA squad.
Kostas. playing in the No. 3 posi
tion. has come hack from tendinitis in
her left shoulder in impressive fash
ion. After tying for the championship
in the Nancy Lope/ Invitational ear
lier in the season. Kostas had to sit
out almost three months because of
the injury. When she returned in
March, however, she finished in fifth
place in the prestigious Lady Mustang
Classic in Dallas.
"kathy is a consistent and steady
player," Baldwin said. "1 think the
experience from last year's NCAAs
will definitely pay dividends at this
year's tournament."
Baldwin said that the key to the
Cardinal's performance this week will
he the performances of Cornelius and
McGonigle. "For us to finish in the
top five and possibly win it all. we
must get top performances from Irish
McGonigle and Kay Cornelius," lie
said.
Cornelius, last year's top high
school prospect, played erratically
early in the season hut has been more
consistent as of late, according to
Baldwin.
McGonigle should be aided by the
golf course in Cape Cod. "The New
Seabury course is similar to Fort Ord
and Pebble Beach (two courses on
which McGonigle McGonigle played
well this season), and that will work
to Trish's advantage," Baldwin said.
"All three courses are half in the
water and half through the trees."
