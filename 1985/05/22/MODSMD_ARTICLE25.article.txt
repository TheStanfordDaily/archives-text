# Veteran men aim for top 10
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff sportswriter 
While the Cardinal women will be
fielding a young, inexperienced team
in the first round of their NCAA
championships in Cape Cod, Mass.,
the Cardinal men will be sending a
decidedly veteran squad onto the
course for today's first round of the
men's NCAA championships at the
Grenelefe (Fla.) Golf and Tennis
Resort.
The Stanford men's team will in
clude three seniors and two juniors.
Four of the five golfers played in last
year's championships.
Though most of the Cardinal men
do have the experience of having
played in last year's nationals, that
experience is one that they would just
as soon put out of their minds. The
Cardinal finished in 26th place last
year at Bear Creek Golf World and
failed to make the cut after the third
round.
If the Stanford men are to improve
on last year's performance and pos
sibly contend for the national cham
pionship, they will have to play up to
the form that earned them a second
place finish at the Stanford U.S. In
tercollegiate April 13-14.
Following the Stanford tourna
ment, the Cardinal struggled to a dis
appointing 11 th-place finish at the
Sun Devil Invitational and finished
the regular season in mediocre fash
ion with a fourth-place finish at the
Pacific 10 Conference champion
ships. At one time, Stanford was con
sidered to be one of the top 10 teams
in the nation, but by the time of the
final NCAA Coaches Poll, the Card
inal had slipped into a tie for 17th.
Cardinal Coach lim Schaaf was
guardedly optimistic about the men's
chances this week. "We've had a
much-needed rest," Schaaf said. "We
seem to be playing well in practice."
The 7,325-yard par-72 course on
which the teams will compete should
help the Cardinal men, according to
Schaaf. "The golf course looks like it
will probably favor a team that hits
the ball far, which is good for us," he
said.
Schaaf said Houston will once
again be the favorite to win the na
tional championship. The No. 1
Cougars are the defending champions

and have dominated men's collegiate
golf for the past two decades.
Also in contention for the champi
onship will be No. 2 UCLA — the
Pac-10 champion — and No. 3 Okla
homa State, last year's runner-up.
Part of the reason for the Cardi
nal's decline in the last few weeks of
the season was the slump of senior
Tim Robinson, who was the team's
top goiter this season, gaining first
team All-Pac-10 honors. After win
ning the John Burns Invitational in
February and the Sacramento State
Invitational in the beginning of
March, Robinson struggled through

much of April, including a somewhat
disappointing 14th-place finish at the
Pac-10 championships. In last year's
NCAA championships, Robinson
finished last among Stanford golfers,
shooting 79-77-77 for the three
rounds.
Senior Scott Erickson was the
Cardinal's top NCAA finisher last
year, shooting 215 for three rounds.
Schaaf said that Erickson has been
playing excellent golf of late, as ex
emplified by his ninth-place finish at
the Pac-10 championships.

Tim Robinson, a first-team All-Pac-10 selection, will have to snap out of
his recent slump if Stanford is to challenge seriously at the NC A As.
Like Robinson, senior Doug
Thompson started quickly this season
only to struggle through the latter
part of the year. Thompson ap
parently turned things around during
the final weeks of the season,
however, finishing eighth at the Stan

ford U.S. Intercollegiate (72-71-73)
and sixth in the Pac-10 champion
ships (74-73-70-72). He was named
to the All-Pac-10 second team.
Juniors Don Walsworth and Carl
Wagner round out the Cardinal's
championship roster. Walsworth had
his best finish of the year last month
at the Stanford U.S. Intercollegiate
when he captured third place. Wag
ner will be a key performer in the
