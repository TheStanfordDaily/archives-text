# Cardinal goes 8-2 at NCAAs
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
OKLAHOMA CI TY — There was a new addi
tion to one of the officials' tents yesterday at the
NCAA Women's Tennis Championships on the
opening day of the individual singles and doubles
competition.
It was a cardboard sign with a quote attributed to
Will Rogers, Oklahoma's so-called native son, and
it read: "If you don't like the weather in Okla
homa, just wait a minute. It'll change."
The weather changed plenty of times yesterday,
from overcast to misty to overcast to rainy and back
again. When the sky finally cleared, the last match
of the day was just finishing — under the lights at
the Oklahoma City Tennis Center, nearly four
hours behind schedule.
Nonetheless, the Oklahoma weather didn't seem
to alfect the live Stanford netters entered in the in
dividual portion of the NCAAs. On the day, the
C ardinal was a combined 8-2 in singles and
doubles. No one who was supposed to win lost, and
one Cardinal doubles team that was supposed to
lose pulled off the biggest upset of the tournament.
As expected, fourth-seeded Patty Fendick and
eighth-seeded Linda Gates both advanced to the
round of 16 in singles with a pair of victories each.
Leigh Anne Eldredge and Stephanie Savides, nei
ther seeded in the top lb, won their first-round
matches but were eliminated in the second, and in
doubles, Stanford s third-seeded team of Eldredge
and Gates breezed into the round of 16.
However, the big story of the day was Savides
and her doubles partner, freshman Kay Tittle.
Stanford s No. 3 team gained some measure of ven
geance over team champion USC by upsetting the

Trojans No. 1 team of Carolyn Kohlman and Mary
Norwood, the tournament's fourth seeds.
Playing in on-again, otf-again mist and under
lights, Savides and Tittle broke Norwood's serve in
the 11th game, and then Savides held to take the
first set. In the second set, the Cardinal duo jumped
ahead 5-1 and even had a match point, but it wasn't
until Savides put away an overhead two games later
that it was in the books as a victory.
Savides and Tittle will have another tough,
though unranked, pair of opponents today in Diane
Dopson and Gen Greiwe, Texas' No. 2 team.
Eldredge and Gates, who routed Oklahoma State's
Mary Boudreaux and Robin Lamb 6-4, 6-3 yester
day, get Northeast Louisiana's Lillemur Hedburg
and Maria Lindstrom today.
In trying to advance to the doubles quarterfinals,
Eldredge will be looking for revenge. Linsdstrom
knocked Eldredge out of the singles in the second
round yesterday, after the Stanford sophomore
beat Pepperdine's Carol Bergrand 6-2, 6-0.
Lindstrom, a 22-year-old sophomore from
Sweden, defeated Eldredge 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in a
match that started outdoors four hours earlier and
10 miles away.
Near the end of the second set, it began to rain,
and after waiting more than an hour for it to stop,
officials moved the match to the indoor courts of
the Somerfield Racquet Club at the north end of
town.
At Somerfield, Lindstrom won the second set
and held on in the third after almost squandering a
3-1 lead.
While Eldredge and Lindstrom were finishing
up. Gates was beginning what might have been her
best match ever on the next court. Gates, who

defeated Houston's Phee Baek 6-4, 6-4 in the first
round, took less than 45 minutes to log a 6-2, 6-0
victory over Norwood, an Oklahoma City native
who attends USC.
"It was one of the most one-sided matches I've
seen in my life between two good players," Bren
nan said, noting that Norwood beat Fendick earlier
this season. "It was like she (Norwood) was playing
a guy. Norwood probably would have won more
games off the No. 6 player on (JSC's (No. 2-
ranked) men's team."
Fendick almost inconspicuously advanced to the
round of 16, blasting Wisconsin's Chris Gilles 6-1,
6-3 and then Indiana's Reka Monoki 6-4, 6-0. That
makes it 20 matches and 40 sets in a row for Fen
dick.
Besides Eldredge, the only other Cardinal to be
eliminated from the singles was Savides. The Card
inal sophomore rebounded from a 4-1 deficit in the
second set to beat New Mexico's Leann Palmisano
6-3, 6-4, but then ran into tough times against Cali
fornia's Heather Ettus, losing 6-2, 6-4.
In today's two rounds of singles. Gates will take
on Miami's Use Gregory in the third round, and
then, if victorious, either Rollins College's Mary
Dineen or Texas' Beverly Bowes, the second seed.
Fendick first gets UCLA's Jane Thomas, whom
she has defeated twice this year, both times in three
sets. If she wins, Fendick will face either sixth
seeded Ronni Reis from Miami or USC's Cecilia
Fernandez.
Of the perennial tennis powerhouses, Stanford
made by far the best showing yesterday. National
champion USC lost six of its 14 matches, and after
yesterday, had only two singles players and one
doubles team still in the tournament.

"It might have been the most perfect match I've ever seen a Stanford
player play," Coach Frank Brennan said yesterday after watching
Linda Gates whip USC's Mary Norwood 6-2, 6-0.
