# Georgia shocks UCLA in final

### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
ATHENS, Ga. — In the last 25
years, only one non-West Coast team
had ever won the NCAA Men's Ten
nis Team Championships. Yesterday,
however, sixth-seeded Georgia
became the first non-California team
to win the title since 1972, defeating
the No. 1 seed, defending champion
UCLA, 5-1.
Georgia Bulldog fans — 4,635 of
them, an all-time record — made
their presence felt yesterday, cheer
ing on such hometown heroes as
Mikael Pernfors, George Bececny
and Allen Miller.
The match marked Georgia's first
appearance in the NCAA team finals,
after three semifinal losses in 1981,
'82 and '84. The Bulldogs represent
the lowest seeded team ever to win

the national title, and no team seeded
lower than third had ever before
reached the final.
The hoopla in Athens, host city of
the tournament for the last nine
years, is quite understandable. Geor
gia managed to beat the three biggies
— Stanford, USC and UCLA — in as
many days. Before this tournament,
the toughest competition the Bull
dogs had faced was No. 5 Pep
perdine, to whom they lost twice ear
lier in the season.
How did they do it? The home
crowd helped, but looking at most of
the matches, Georgia's key was
keeping the ball in play. The Bulldogs
played it safe — they kept the ball in
play and let their opponents hit it out.
The third-place match was not such
a lopsided victory, as USC struggled
to a 5-4 victory over Southern Meth
odist.
