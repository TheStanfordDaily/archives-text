# Polo teams thriving again on the Farm
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
Docs riding a horse at 35 miles per hour up and
down a field hitting a tiny hall with a mallet appeal
to your wildest desires? It so, chances are polo is in
your blood. No. not water polo, hut the equestrian
sort.
"At one time,' Stanford had the best team in the
country," said sophomore Feisel Khan, referring to
the years 1953-54. The team was non-existent
from 1955 on, but was refounded in 19K0 as a club
sport, and is now under the leadership of Coach
Robert Genisman.
It was a fairly uphill struggle, at first, because the
University did not want the added liability of main
taining horses, he said. All the horses used by polo
club members have been donated to the University,
and are stabled at Webb Ranch on Alpine Road,
where the team practices.
" I he normal polo season starts about early May,
and we start playing in mid-fall," Khan said. Stan
lord polo seasons do not coincide with the normal
polo season, which prevents the team from compet
ing in more tournaments, he said.
According to Khan, the men's polo team has had
a fairly successful season. This was the first year
Stanford has sent the polo team to the nationals at
Darien, Conn. Stanford lost in the first round to
South Carolina, 13-7.
The women's team "has suffered this year," be
cause it lost most of its top players, said sophomore
Karen Anderson. "The team is really young."
The Cardinal women lost in the quarterfinals at
nationals,to Skidmore.
Both the men's and women's teams also play
scrimmages against USC, Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo and UC-Davis, Anderson said. "We are al
ways better than Cal Poly. . . . USC is new and
coming up strong," Anderson continued, adding
that Stanford is still better than either team.
UC-Davis is the defending national champion,
"and we come nowhere close," she said.
"It's hard to get collegiate tournaments to
gether," she added.
"If we could get more help, we could be very
good," Khan said. He named captain Igore Aguirre
as an example of a talented polo player. Aguirre
was invited to play for the West team in the East-
West game. Khan said.
He said the team needs more undergraduates.
Currently, approximately IS students are members
of the polo club.
"Once you get into playing polo, you don't want
to play anything else," Khan said.
A polo team is composed of four team members
when playing outdoors and three if playing indoors.

There is a goal but no specific goalie.
'It is vaguely like field hockey," Khan said.
There are two mounted referees if outside, one if
inside, and one on the sideline, who has the final
say on any call. The standard outdoor field is 200 x
300 yards, the indoor measurements are slighth
smaller at 65 x 35 yards.
"It's like an oversized bathtub." Khan remarked.
Khan provided three fundamental rules of polo
that any budding polo star should keep in mind.
Khan said the most important rule is "when the
ball is hit it makes a line. The person on the line has
the right of way."
Rule number two: The person who has the ball
on the right-hand side of his body has the right to
the ball over the person who has the ball on the
left-hand side of his body.
Rule number three: "There is no such thing as a
left-handed polo player," Khan said.
"It's easier if you know how to play golf."' said
freshman Cathy Stewart, referring to the swing ol
the mallet. Stewart said the ball can be hit on either
the near or the far side of the body, frontward or
backward.
Khan said it is quite easy to get involved, refuting
the standard elitist stereotype associated with polo.
"I never had those feelings. I played because my
father played."
Polo is "not a snobbish game. To be able to play
at a basic fun level, it does not take much money,"
he added.
It is less expensive here because a a team mem
ber need not own a horse, Stewart said. The fee is
$ 1 00 per quarter.
"I feel very guilty sometimes." she said about the
elitist stereotype. However, "you are at Stanford.
You are doing things to enjoy life."
"It doesn't feel very elitist," Stewart added.
"You have to clean the horses and saddle them
up."
"In a way it's cruel to horses," Stewart contin
ued, because their ankles and legs can be injured.
Khan added that it can be very dangerous for
team members, as well. "I've seen one person get
killed playing it (in Pakistan)," he said.
The polo club has also been involved in the
Meyer Library campaign to implement the no
food/no drink policy at the library. Members are
requesting all people walking through the library's
to open their backpacks and book bags
foi a TOlni and drink check.
Stewart said the club members are being paid to
monitor the incoming patrons, and all the money is
going toward the polo club.
"You'd be surprised how much a horse eats,"
Khan said.
