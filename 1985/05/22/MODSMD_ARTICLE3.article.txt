Slate of Mind decisively defeated
Mac Slate in a second runoff election for the
Senior Class presidency, the ASSU associate
elections commissioner announced yester
day.
With only 40 possible votes from the
Tours, France, campus yet to be reported.
Slate of Mind had garnered 262 votes to 170
for Mac Slate. said ASSU Assoc. Election
Commissioner George Zimmerman. The
results of the runoff, held last Tuesday, were
released last night when vote tallies from
students at Stanford's other overseas
campuses became known.
"How cool. I'm just so happy," com
mented Slate of Mind member Kim Oden.
"We're thrilled and are looking forward to a
great year," echoed Leslie Darwin, another
slate member. She stressed "unifying the
(senior) class" as one of the slate's goals,
and vowed, "We're going to work our tails
off."

Slate of Mind includes Darwin, Oden, Pat
Shannon and Steve Smith.
Last week's vote was the second runoff
race between Slate of Mind and Mac Slate.
An earlier runoff, held in late April, was dis
qualified by the ASSU Senate on May 7. In
that race, Slate of Mind also triumphed â€”
150 votes to 145.
Zimmerman said the ASSU decided to
hold a second runoff to include juniors at
overseas campuses and to compensate for
mistakes made in publicizing the earlier
election.
Zimmerman said "screwed up ads in The
Daily" before the first runoff may have
confused some voters. He said that on two
consecutive days The Daily ran the same ad
telling voters that the election would be the
next day."The election was so close" that
there was debate over whether the resultant
confusion had made a difference, Zimmer
man said.
Although he said he understood the

rationale behind another election, Zimmer
man said the second runoff had been "a real
hassle that cost a lot of money." Much of the
expense and effort, he explained, was
caused by the inclusion of the overseas
campuses in the runoff. "Students overseas
haven't ever voted in a runoff before," Zim
merman said.
Darwin said the slate has already worked
on the senior formal and begun making pub
night arrangements. For the year, she said
the slate's plans include having a boat dance,
working on a San Francisco progressive pub
night, creating a senior directory and build
ing "on non-academic relationships."
In terms of the election, Darwin said she
was sorry that it was such a "long ordeal,"
and added that "cither slate would have
done a good job."
On campus, 316 votes were cast in the
election. In addition, eight absentee votes
were cast, and slightly more than 100 votes
were cast overseas.
