## Libertarian and democratic socialist debate 
### EVELYN UHLIG Staff writer 
Libertarian Bill Evers and demo
cratic socialist Jim Shoch clashed
sharply in a History Corner debate
last night on the role of government
in solving existing social problems.
Before an audience of about 20
people, Shoch, national political
director of the Democratic Socialists
of America, stated that a market eco
nomy, free of most government
regulation, doesn't produce a society
which leads to liberty, democracy and
equality.
Evers, a representative of the Na
tional Committee for the Libertarian
Party, supported the political stance
that government should interfere as
little as possible with the conduct of
business. This involves the abolition
of taxes. "I look forward to the day
when taxation will be universally
looked on as the theft that it is,"
Evers said.
Criticizing libertarian capitalism on
the grounds that it does not promote
liberty or equality very well, Shoch
said that the system "produces great
devastation and social dislocation."
He pointed to flaws in the libertarian
belief that a free market, with no gov
ernment regulation, best promotes

individual liberty.
Unemployment is actually required
in an uncontrolled capitalistic society,
Shoch said, because it keeps pay
wages at a low level. Low wages are
necessary in order to produce the
largest possible profit.
Shoch added that those who are
"forced to take wage labor" are the
victims of their employers, who are
able to control and influence workers
in numerous ways.
This eventually translates into a
marked disproportion of political
power, in which the investing
capitalists exercise power over the
employees and enjoy the results of
their labor. In this case, the workers
are powerless to change their situa
tion.
He advocated an egalitarian distri
bution of power and wealth, and
stated, "a caring society decides col
lectively for its poorest."
Pointing to Hong Kong as an ex
ample of worker exploitation in the
free market, he said that workers
operate in poor conditions, numerous
injuries occur on the job, and
children are driven into the work
force.
But Evers said socialist systems are
inefficient and tend to overlook the

individual in their attempts to
promote equality.
Current socialist governments are
not particularly attractive, since at
best, secret police exist in these na
tions. and at worst, the country is un
enlightened. Evers said.
Evers also criticized socialists tor
placing importance upon the idea of
equality among the population,
saying this brings serious problems.
Not only does this blur the unique
ness of the individual, but trying to
create social and economic equality
among members of a population
necessitates the government exercis
ing immense power. The socialist
slogan to vote for equality "becomes
a smokescreen for which a new class
of political bureaucracy controls the
system," Evers said.
"I'm opposed to all racial and
sexual quotas," Evers said. He ex
plained that the Libertarian Party
does not support legislation making
discrimination in business illegal. He
said that if a Muslim does not want a
white man to work for him, because
he believes that the white man is the
descendant of the devil, anti
discrimination legislation infringes
upon his right to associate with whom
he wishes.
