Mobil donates $150,000
Mobil Oil Corp. has awarded a $150,000 grant to the
School of Earth Sciences to establish a fluid mechanics
and phase behavior laboratory, which will investigate mis
cible flooding, a promising technique to increase oil pro
duction.
Director of the project is Franklin Orr, Jr., associate
professor of petroleum engineering (research), who
joined the Stanford faculty in January. Previously, he
headed a similar project at the New Mexico Institute of
Mining and Technology.
Conventional oil recovery methods leave 50 to 70 per
cent of the oil underground. Stanford's Petroleum Engi
neering Department, chaired by Prof. Henry Ramey, Jr.,
specializes in enhanced oil recovery.
In miscible flooding processes, a fluid, usually carbon
dioxide or a light hydrocarbon mixture, is injected into the
the reservoir to replace the oil that remains after conven
tional recovery methods have been completed.
The National Petroleum Council has estimated that at
least 2 billion — and possibly as much as 8.5 billion —
barrels of oil could be recovered from U.S. reservoirs
through miscible flooding processes. The council study
suggests that about 600 reservoirs are candidates for mis
cible flooding.
The size of the investment required to install an en
hanced oil recovery project is so large that accurate
predictions of the amount and timing of oil recovery are
essential for the assessment of project economics. Orr's
research is aimed at improving the accuracy of miscible
flood performance predictions.
Freshman writing awards announced
Norman Wessells, dean of humanities and sciences, has
announced six winners of the autumn and winter quarter
1984-85 Boothe Prizes for Excellence in writing. The
prizes were established in 1982 by a gift from Mr. and
Mrs. D. Power Boothe, Jr.
They are awarded both in freshman English and West
ern Culture for the best freshman essays. Because all
freshmen take Western Culture or freshman English, the

essays represent some of the best writing in the entire
freshman class.
The winner in Western Culture for autumn is Mary Ann
Limbos for "The Eumenides: The Transitions." For win
ter, the winner is Daralyn Durie for "A New Synthesis:
The Primavera."
The winners in freshman English for autumn are
Andrea Harper for "My Ancestors: The Maroons," and
Nancy Jenner for "Under God, with Liberty and Justice."
For winter, the winners are Douglas Chin for "Composing
a Miracle" and Linda Sonne for "Save Mono Lake."
In addition, the Western Culture students receiving
honorable mention are Gerald Paper, Jr., David Fioren
tino, Catherine Gallagher, Phillip Lim, Brian Drucker,
Charles Moody, Hassanali Moinzadeh and Elizabeth
DeCarli. Freshman English students receiving honorable
mention are Dawn Sheggeby, Jay Theiler and Eric
Reifsnider.
The winners receive a $250 cash award. Both winners
and runners-up receive a personalized book. The
recipients will be honored at a reception at the dean's of
fice at 4:30 p.m. May 28.
Abramowitz to receive Swedish honor
Moses Abramowitz, Stanford professor emeritus of
economics, will go to Uppsala University, Sweden, May
31 to receive an honorary degree of doctor of philosophy.
The award, announced by Dean Erik Wallin, was
decided by the university's faculty of social sciences.
Abramowitz nominally retired from Stanford in 1979,
but has continued to work on campus. He stepped down
in 1981 as president of the American Economic Associa
tion, which has 20,000 members.
He was until recently managing editor of the associa
tion's Journal of Economic Literature.
Patell to take GSB post
James Patell, a professor of accounting, has been
named an associate dean for academic affairs with respon
sibility for the Stanford Graduate School of Business's
MBA program. Dean Robert Jaedicke has announced.

The position is a new one. Fatell will become one of
three associate deans for academic affairs when he begins
the appointment in September. He will join current Aca
demic Assoc. Deans Charles Holloway and Eugene
Webb.
Jaedicke said the creation of the new position will allow
a better division of the rapidly expanding workload of the
academic associate dean's office. The office has the re
sponsibility to oversee all of the school's academic pro
grams — doctoral, MBA, Sloan and executive education
— as well as to coordinate the activities of approximately
120 faculty members.
Jaedicke noted that the two current associate deans
now must spend significant amounts of their time recruit
ing new faculty because of an increasingly tight and com
petitive job market for top business school professors.
As an associate dean. Patell said he expects to spend a
good part of his time involved with long-range planning
issues. He said he foresees his role as one of "facilitating
the evolution of the MBA program into the 19905."
The two-year MBA program, the school's largest aca
demic component, has a total of about 640 students.
Entry into the program remains extremely competitive;
this year the school received about 4,500 aplications for
320 openings in next year's class.
GSB dean named to professorship
Stanford Graduate School of Business Dean Robert
Jaedicke has been appointed to a newly endowed profes
sorship for the dean which has been established by an
anonymous donor. The appointment was approved by the
Stanford Board of Trustees on May 14.
The board also approved the appointment of Business
School Prof. David Baron to the William Kimball Profes
sorship of Business, Economics and Environment.
Jaedicke held the Kimball chair until his new appoint
ment.
Both appointments are effective immediately.
"On behalf of the business school, I would like to ac
knowledge and thank the anonymous donor whose
generous gifts will permanently endow the new professor

ship for the dean," said Carol Marchik, associate dean
for external relations. "The establishment of an endowed
chair confirms the commitment of the business school's
friends to its continuing excellence and financial well
being. The new professorship for the dean is also a tribute
to the outstanding leadership and contributions of Dean
Jaedicke as well as the GSB's past and future deans."
The William R. Kimball Professorship was established
in 1 975 with gifts from William Kimball, the current pres
ident of the Stanford Board of Trustees. Kimball
graduated from Stanford with an AB degree in 1941 and
later earned an MBA degree from the Harvard Business
School. He has been active in Stanford affairs ever since.
He is owner of Kimball & Co., a San Francisco firm with
diversified operations and investments.
"The appointment of David Baron to the Kimball
Professorship is a well-deserved honor," said Charles
Holloway, associate dean for academic affairs. "Dave has
an excellent record of academic leadership and achieve
ments in many varied undertakings, including research,
curriculum development, teaching, and active and effec
tive participation in the affairs of the business school and
the University."
Chapel's associate dean to leave
Wendy Smith, associate dean of the chapel at Stanford,
will leave her position June 16 to pursue a career in parish
ministry in the Episcopal Church.
Smith came to Stanford as assistant dean of the chapel
in September 1974 and was promoted to associate dean in
1979.
Smith said she is leaving because she has "reached the
limit that's possible for an associate pastor and now hope
to find a position as priest in charge of a local parish. 1
need to make myself available to preach and participate in
Episcopal churches in a way that's not possible while my
responsibilites continue at Stanford."
She will preach her last sermon in Memorial Church on
June 9 and will deliver the benediction at Commence
ment June 16.

freshmen take Western Culture or freshman English, the

essays represent some of the best writing in the entire
freshman class.
The winner in Western Culture for autumn is Mary Ann
Limbos for "The Eumenides: The Transitions." For win
ter, the winner is Daralyn Durie for "A New Synthesis:
The Primavera."
The winners in freshman English for autumn are
Andrea Harper for "My Ancestors: The Maroons," and
Nancy Jenner for "Under God, with Liberty and Justice."
For winter, the winners are Douglas Chin for "Composing
a Miracle" and Linda Sonne for "Save Mono Lake."
In addition, the Western Culture students receiving
honorable mention are Gerald Paper, Jr., David Fioren
tino, Catherine Gallagher, Phillip Lim, Brian Drucker,
Charles Moody, Hassanali Moinzadeh and Elizabeth
DeCarli. Freshman English students receiving honorable
mention are Dawn Sheggeby, Jay Theiler and Eric
Reifsnider.
The winners receive a $250 cash award. Both winners
and runners-up receive a personalized book. The
recipients will be honored at a reception at the dean's of
fice at 4:30 p.m. May 28.
Abramowitz to receive Swedish honor
Moses Abramowitz, Stanford professor emeritus of
economics, will go to Uppsala University, Sweden, May
31 to receive an honorary degree of doctor of philosophy.
The award, announced by Dean Erik Wallin, was
decided by the university's faculty of social sciences.
Abramowitz nominally retired from Stanford in 1979,
but has continued to work on campus. He stepped down
in 1981 as president of the American Economic Associa
tion, which has 20,000 members.
He was until recently managing editor of the associa
tion's Journal of Economic Literature.
Patell to take GSB post
James Patell, a professor of accounting, has been
named an associate dean for academic affairs with respon
sibility for the Stanford Graduate School of Business's
MBA program. Dean Robert Jaedicke has announced.

The position is a new one. Fatell will become one of
three associate deans for academic affairs when he begins
the appointment in September. He will join current Aca
demic Assoc. Deans Charles Holloway and Eugene
Webb.
Jaedicke said the creation of the new position will allow
a better division of the rapidly expanding workload of the
academic associate dean's office. The office has the re
sponsibility to oversee all of the school's academic pro
grams — doctoral, MBA, Sloan and executive education
— as well as to coordinate the activities of approximately
120 faculty members.
Jaedicke noted that the two current associate deans
now must spend significant amounts of their time recruit
ing new faculty because of an increasingly tight and com
petitive job market for top business school professors.
As an associate dean. Patell said he expects to spend a
good part of his time involved with long-range planning
issues. He said he foresees his role as one of "facilitating
the evolution of the MBA program into the 19905."
The two-year MBA program, the school's largest aca
demic component, has a total of about 640 students.
Entry into the program remains extremely competitive;
this year the school received about 4,500 aplications for
320 openings in next year's class.
GSB dean named to professorship
Stanford Graduate School of Business Dean Robert
Jaedicke has been appointed to a newly endowed profes
sorship for the dean which has been established by an
anonymous donor. The appointment was approved by the
Stanford Board of Trustees on May 14.
The board also approved the appointment of Business
School Prof. David Baron to the William Kimball Profes
sorship of Business, Economics and Environment.
Jaedicke held the Kimball chair until his new appoint
ment.
Both appointments are effective immediately.
"On behalf of the business school, I would like to ac
knowledge and thank the anonymous donor whose
generous gifts will permanently endow the new professor

ship for the dean," said Carol Marchik, associate dean
for external relations. "The establishment of an endowed
chair confirms the commitment of the business school's
friends to its continuing excellence and financial well
being. The new professorship for the dean is also a tribute
to the outstanding leadership and contributions of Dean
Jaedicke as well as the GSB's past and future deans."
The William R. Kimball Professorship was established
in 1 975 with gifts from William Kimball, the current pres
ident of the Stanford Board of Trustees. Kimball
graduated from Stanford with an AB degree in 1941 and
later earned an MBA degree from the Harvard Business
School. He has been active in Stanford affairs ever since.
He is owner of Kimball & Co., a San Francisco firm with
diversified operations and investments.
"The appointment of David Baron to the Kimball
Professorship is a well-deserved honor," said Charles
Holloway, associate dean for academic affairs. "Dave has
an excellent record of academic leadership and achieve
ments in many varied undertakings, including research,
curriculum development, teaching, and active and effec
tive participation in the affairs of the business school and
the University."
Chapel's associate dean to leave
Wendy Smith, associate dean of the chapel at Stanford,
will leave her position June 16 to pursue a career in parish
ministry in the Episcopal Church.
Smith came to Stanford as assistant dean of the chapel
in September 1974 and was promoted to associate dean in
1979.
Smith said she is leaving because she has "reached the
limit that's possible for an associate pastor and now hope
to find a position as priest in charge of a local parish. 1
need to make myself available to preach and participate in
Episcopal churches in a way that's not possible while my
responsibilites continue at Stanford."
She will preach her last sermon in Memorial Church on
June 9 and will deliver the benediction at Commence
ment June 16.
Mobil donates $150,000
Mobil Oil Corp. has awarded a $150,000 grant to the
School of Earth Sciences to establish a fluid mechanics
and phase behavior laboratory, which will investigate mis
cible flooding, a promising technique to increase oil pro
duction.
Director of the project is Franklin Orr, Jr., associate
professor of petroleum engineering (research), who
joined the Stanford faculty in January. Previously, he
headed a similar project at the New Mexico Institute of
Mining and Technology.
Conventional oil recovery methods leave 50 to 70 per
cent of the oil underground. Stanford's Petroleum Engi
neering Department, chaired by Prof. Henry Ramey, Jr.,
specializes in enhanced oil recovery.
In miscible flooding processes, a fluid, usually carbon
dioxide or a light hydrocarbon mixture, is injected into the
the reservoir to replace the oil that remains after conven
tional recovery methods have been completed.
The National Petroleum Council has estimated that at
least 2 billion — and possibly as much as 8.5 billion —
barrels of oil could be recovered from U.S. reservoirs
through miscible flooding processes. The council study
suggests that about 600 reservoirs are candidates for mis
cible flooding.
The size of the investment required to install an en
hanced oil recovery project is so large that accurate
predictions of the amount and timing of oil recovery are
essential for the assessment of project economics. Orr's
research is aimed at improving the accuracy of miscible
flood performance predictions.
Freshman writing awards announced
Norman Wessells, dean of humanities and sciences, has

1984-85 Boothe Prizes for Excellence in writing. The
prizes were established in 1982 by a gift from Mr. and
