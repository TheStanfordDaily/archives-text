It was so much fun the first time
around, we decided to do it again
today.
Because no candidate garnered a
majority of the votes cast in yester
day's editorial election, we'll try again
today. Troy Eid and Charlie Gofen
are the candidates in today's runoff,
and whoever wins today will be Mr.
Steak of The Daily, Volume 188,

which begins in fall.
Voting for all staff members on the
voting list begins today at 1 p.m. and
ends at 10 p.m. All staffers who want
their votes counted in the runoff,
whether they voted yesterday or not,
must vote again today. Results will be
announced just after 10 p.m., with
celebratory refreshments offered to
all.
