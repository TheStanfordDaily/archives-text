# Near West plan
## $250 million renovation proposed 
### DAVID S. GOLDSTEIN Staff writer 
The University is looking into a ,$250 million
"exploratory" plan to rebuild and renovate 41
acres of the so-called Near West Campus, which
contains several science and engineering build
ings. The coordinated set of building projects
under consideration may be the biggest such ef
fort since the University was built.
"We're trying to look at it as one area,"
Budget Director Phil Williams said. The set of
individual projects would be remarkable not for
its cost, he said, but rather because the Univer
sity has never before integrated so many proj
ects for an overall purpose.
Raymond Bacchetti, vice provost for man
agement and director of University budgets,
cited the "slum-like quality" of parts of the area
west of the Durand building and the McCul
lough/Physics/Varian buildings.
"We really can do better than that," said Bac
chetti, who leads the multi-departmental plan
ning team that is analyzing the needs of the sci
ence and engineering departments in that area.
He said an unpleasant environment exists which
may lead to the loss of talented researchers.
Others, who do not work in the area, avoid it
because it looks "formidable" and isolated from
the rest of the campus, he added.
The proposal, which Bacchetti called
"exploratory and preparatory," outlines the
renovation of some buildings and the replace
ment of others, creating an integrated, more at
tractive area.
Bacchetti said the building project was "sort
of everybody's idea." The celebration of the
University's Centennial creates "a tremendous
opportunity to do something in that area," he
said. Williams said fund raising for the project
would be "a major element" in fund raising for
the Centennial.
The Board of Trustees will further discuss the
idea at its meeting in June, at which time pre
liminary approval should be granted for the
project, Bacchetti said. Meanwhile, the Univer
sity has retained The Architects Collaborative
of San Francisco and Cambridge, Mass., to
develop plans for the project. The architect's
report is due Nov. 1.
John Hughes, assistant provost of manage
ment and budget, said endorsement for building
projects normally requires several stages of
trustee approval. He said the trustees will prob
ably agree "in principle" to the plans at their
next meeting, but, according to Williams, they
would have to approve at a later date the budget
and design for each of the proposal's several
parts.
Williams said a small part of the revamping
effort has already begun with construction of

the Lab Surge between the museum and the or
ganic chemistry building. The Lab Surge build
ing, which will house departments and offices
temporarily displaced by other construction
projects, is part of the architectural scheme for
the area.
Plans are far from complete, however, and
the extent and nature of the final project, if ap
proved, depends on individual departments'
demonstrated needs and on fund-raising efforts.
Officials hope to raise 20 to 40 percent of the
estimated $250 million from a few principal
donors, another 20 to 30 percent from other in
dividuals and corporations and 5 to 10 percent
from foundations. The University would make
up the rest.
Bacchetti said the project would be a long
term one. "If everything breaks our way, 1 think
it would take about 10 years," he said, but
added that it would probably take longer be
cause of typical unforeseen problems and
changes. Spread over that many years, the ex
penditure would not exceed the normal annual
amounts the University spends, Williams said.
