# Kennedy speaks on C-IR plan
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Ken
nedy told the ASSU Senate last night
that he would give "careful consider
ation" to a proposal issued Monday
calling for changes in the structure of
the Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility (C-IR) which includes a
December 1987 deadline for Univer
sity divestment in companies doing
business in South Africa.
"I don't have any [opinion] yet be
cause they (the recommendations)
came out today," Kennedy said. He
did state that the two-year deadline
for divestment "is an appropriate
one."
Kennedy also said he believes that
most companies doing business in
South Africa are "seriously trying to
make a positive impact" on changing
the laws of that country's apartheid
system of government. "It's the
changing of the laws that is the signif
icant action."
Kennedy addressed the possible
conflicts of interest among members
of the Board of Trustees who might
have an interest in a corporation
operating in South Africa. He said
the current system for eliminating
such conflicts, in which trustees are
asked to abstain from voting in mat
ters where a conflict is apparent, "is
very traditional, and it has worked
fine."
"Abstentions of that type occur all
the time." Kennedy said, noting that
trustees "have never been requested'
to disclose specific causes of such
conflicts of interest.
Kennedy also answered questions
from senators on the closing of three
large campus parties last weekend.

including the Rinc-a-delt party on
Wilbur Field and the Hula Party at
Lake Lagunita.
Kennedy said he thought the
"extremely loud amplification" of
music at each party, which he said
brought an unusually large number ot
complaints from members of the
Stanford community, was the chief
reason police shut down the parties.
"I don't think the police changed
their threshold of action — I think the
noise level changed," he said, adding
that he would "try to find out" the
specific reasons behind the closings.

Kennedy said it was important to
take in account that "the campus is a
residential community lived in by
people other than students." pointing
out that residents of Escondido Vil
lage with young children live near
Wilbur Field.
He said he is "very much inclined
to non-interference myself" with
campus parties, noting that he has
called for the shut-down of only two
parties in five years.
Speaking on the election of the
Hammer and Coffin slate to the office
of Council of Presidents. Kennedy

said he "actually had a nice meeting
with the new COP, but I really don't
want to say any more." He joked that
he would "inflict irreparable political
damage by praising them."
In other action, the senate advised
the senate-elect to place on the first
ballot next fall a referendum asking
students to decide if the ASSU
"should remove its endowment funds
from the University Merged Pool B
and put these funds into a 'South
Africa-free' portfolio" should the
University not divest from compan
ies doing business in South Africa by
Dec. 31, 1987.
Senator Mark Soble, co-author of
the resolution, stated that an election
is the first step toward "a more so
cially responsible ASSU investment
policy," confirming whether
"students are ready to put their
money where their mouth is."
The Senate also asked the ASSU
financial manager to "identify South
Africa-free mutual funds which might
be alternatives to Stanford's Merged
Pool B" and report this information
to the Senate on Oct. 1, 1985.
In other matters, the Senate con
firmed the appointment of Eugene
Chen to the position of director of the
program board for 1985-86.
Three members of the H & C slate
at the meeting — Tim Ouirk. Mike
Collins and Andy Frisch — presented
Senators Soble. Carey White. Jim
McGrath and Senate Chair Eric Berg
with pie tins full of shaving cream and
peanuts.
The trio refrained from launching
the tins after Berg reminded them
that a similar prank by the Chaparral
last year cost the ASSU $400 in
cleaning bills.
