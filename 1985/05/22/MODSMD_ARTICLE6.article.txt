# Groups respond to apartheid

Protesting is not the only way to
voice disapproval of American in
vestment in South Africa, Stan
ford faculty members and Penin
sula area workers are finding out.
Recent actions by these groups
have included the withdrawal of or
alternative programs for pension
plan investments in South Africa.
In addition, a total of "13
municipal and five state pension
funds are selling some if not all
shares in companies with opera
tions in South Africa or removing
funds from banks that lend to
South Africa," according to two
groups quoted in the April 30
Wall Street Journal. The groups
are the Investor Responsibility
Research Center (IRRC), a con
sulting group that researches
public-policy issues, and the
American Committee on Africa, a
New York-based group lobbying
for such stock divestiture.
According to The Journal, "The
center (IRRC) estimates that uni
versities and public pension funds
have sold $450 million of such
stocks in recent years."
Stanford faculty and staff mem
bers have shown recent concern
about their pension plan invest
ments in South Africa. Respond
ing to individual Stanford faculty
desires for South Africa-free pen
sion fund investment options, the
Board of Trustees has agreed to a

South Africa-free pension plan as
an alternative for faculty members
wishing not to invest in South
Africa, University President
Donald Kennedy told The Daily
last week.
William Massy, vice president
for business and finance, and Per
sonnel Director Robert Parker
met with faculty and staff mem
bers Monday afternoon at Cub
berley Auditorium to discuss these
concerns.
"There is a wide range of
opinion about it (South Africa
free pension plan)," Parker said. It
is very important to faculty and
staff members to get a good return
on their investment, he added.
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo
announced Sunday that "New
York State should eliminate bil
lions of dollars of investments in
companies that do business in
South Africa and should sharply
limit all dealings with such con
cerns." according to The New
York Times.
These state funds include about
$4.4 billion in employees' and
teachers' pension funds. The
Times reported. Cuomo intends to
propose legislation that would
suggest a series of steps by which
the state comptroller and the trus
tees of the pension funds "would
be obliged to divest holdings." ac
cording to The Times.
Some local government agencies
are also electing to change their in
vestment policies. The San Diego
City Council, for example, on May 13
called for the city's retirement board
to sever all ties between the
employees' pension fund and Ameri
can companies with links to South
Africa. The board now maintains
about $38 million, or 8 percent of its
portfolio, in stock in six such compan
ies. The issue will be brought before a

full council vote on June 10.
However, "those numbers (of dol
lars in assets being sold by univer
sities and pension programs) pale
next to the $980 billion assets of all
corporate and union pension funds,
as estimated by the Employee Benefit
Research Institute," The Journal
stated.
Throughout the United States,
cities, companies and universities
have billions of dollars of assets in
pensions funds that have investments
in South Africa. According to The
Journal, despite anti-apartheid activi
ties, "the sale of stock of companies
doing business in South Africa

doesn't seem to have driven down the
market value of those shares."
According to the May 5 Times
Tribune. American investment in
South Africa is so pervasive that
nearly every local government agency
on the Peninsula has investments or
other financial dealings with Ameri
can corporations that do business in
South Africa. The Times Tribune
cited many local pension plan invest
ments in South Africa for area
workers.
Santa Clara County's transit dis
trict retirement fund, for example,
has investments in two companies
that do business in South Africa, in

cluding Mobil Oil, which has the larg
est financial investment in South
Africa of any American corporation,
the paper reported.
San Jose's retirement fund also has
part of its $425 million portfolio in
vested in IBM, which has large in
vestments in South Africa, the Times
Tribune said.
According to the paper, "All but
two of the Peninsula's cities have
placed their pension fund accounts in
a state retirement fund pool, the
Public Employees Retirement Sys
tem, which also has been criticized for
investments in companies with ties to
South Africa."
