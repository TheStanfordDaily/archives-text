Protesting is not the only way to
voice disapproval of American in
vestment in South Africa, Stan
ford faculty members and Penin
sula area workers are finding out.
Recent actions by these groups
have included the withdrawal of or
alternative programs for pension
plan investments in South Africa.
In addition, a total of "13
municipal and five state pension
funds are selling some if not all
shares in companies with opera
tions in South Africa or removing
funds from banks that lend to
South Africa," according to two
groups quoted in the April 30
Wall Street Journal. The groups
are the Investor Responsibility
Research Center (IRRC), a con
sulting group that researches
public-policy issues, and the
American Committee on Africa, a
New York-based group lobbying
for such stock divestiture.
According to The Journal, "The
center (IRRC) estimates that uni
versities and public pension funds
have sold $450 million of such
stocks in recent years."
Stanford faculty and staff mem
bers have shown recent concern
about their pension plan invest
ments in South Africa. Respond
ing to individual Stanford faculty
desires for South Africa-free pen
sion fund investment options, the
Board of Trustees has agreed to a

South Africa-free pension plan as
an alternative for faculty members
wishing not to invest in South
Africa, University President
Donald Kennedy told The Daily
last week.
William Massy, vice president
for business and finance, and Per
sonnel Director Robert Parker
met with faculty and staff mem
bers Monday afternoon at Cub
berley Auditorium to discuss these
concerns.
"There is a wide range of
opinion about it (South Africa
free pension plan)," Parker said. It
is very important to faculty and
staff members to get a good return
on their investment, he added.
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo
announced Sunday that "New
York State should eliminate bil
lions of dollars of investments in
companies that do business in
South Africa and should sharply
limit all dealings with such con
cerns." according to The New
York Times.
These state funds include about
$4.4 billion in employees' and
teachers' pension funds. The
Times reported. Cuomo intends to
propose legislation that would
suggest a series of steps by which
the state comptroller and the trus
tees of the pension funds "would
be obliged to divest holdings." ac
cording to The Times.
