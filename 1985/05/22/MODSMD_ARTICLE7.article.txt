India seeks tough anti-terrorist law
NEW DEHLI, India — The lower house of Parliament here instigated
the toughest anti-terrorist legislation since India became independent in
1947.
The measure followed the May 10-11 killing of at least 87 people in
Sikh terrorist bombings across northern India.
The upper house, like the lower, is controlled by Prime Minister Rajiv-
Gandhi's Congress Party and is expected to pass the new bill, which
would be in effect for two years.
The legislation provides the death penalty for terrorist killings and
prison terms for "disruptive activities" including songs, paintings, books
or tape cassettes deemed to undermine India's unity.
It provides special closed courts, admission of testimony from secret
prosecution witnesses, and immunity from prosecution for officials and
police in carrying out the act. Appeal from the special courts can be
made to the Supeme Court.
The tiny opposition in the Lok Sabha, or House of the People, argued
Monday that the bill was too severe, too broad and likely to be abused. It
said the legislation was a threat to democratic principles, giving officials
and police free reign to crush political dissent.
Law Minister Asoke Sen told the lower house, "Organized gangs of
terrorists are clearly out to subvert the Indian state. A time has now
come to not only combat, but root out terrorism from the country's soil."
The government said the threat to India's unity posed by Sikh ter
rorism was as grave as the threat during any war.
But Sen emphasized that the law was not directed against the Sikh
community, which he called "blood of our blood and flesh of our flesh."
India's 13 million Sikhs comprise 2 percent of the 750 million popula
tion and most of them live in Punjab state. A tiny minority of militants
are fighting for a separate Sikh nation in Punjab. Most Sikhs want
greater political and religious autonomy within India.
Palestinians battle with Shiites
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Palestinian guerrillas broke out of a besieged
refugee camp yesterday, seized four high-rise buildings and poured
heavy fire onto the Shiite Moslem militiamen who surrounded them,
witnesses reported.
At two other camps, Palestinians fought desperately to keep the
Shiites at bay. Men, women, boys and young girls joined in the struggle,
hurling grenades from behind the sandbags.
Squads of Palestinian fighters drove units of the Amal militia from
three 10-story apartment buildings on hilltops outside the Sabra camp in
west Beirut in fierce hand-to-hand battles, Palestinian spokesmen and
witnesses told The Associated Press.
They said other guerrillas recaptured the nine-story Gaza Hospital, on
the fringe of Sabra, which was overrun by the Shiite militiamen Monday
night.
The thrust into the Fakhani district gave them a string of strongpoints
overlooking the battle zone.
Amal assaults continued at the Chatilla and Bourj el-Barajneh camps.
"Everybody's fighting in there. Men, women, boys, even girls are
throwing hand grenades," said a commander of the Shiite militia Amal,
who identified himself by his fighting name Abu Mira.
He stood in the bullet-riddled Aamelieh school on the fringe of Bourj
el-Barajneh in south Beirut, which was surrounded by his men.
Mortars, rockets, grenades and machine-gun fire made an endless din
as darkness fell, and the carnage grew. Police said at least 121 people
had been killed and 637 wounded since the battles for the camps began
late Sunday.
Scores of Palestinians sneaked out of the camps during lulls in the
fighting yesterday, seeking safety from the incessant barrages even
though Shiites control the surrounding areas. Men and women clutching
children ran for cover.
Shiite fighters made house-to-house searches near the camps, drag
ging out at least 65 young men suspected of being Palestinians.
In Amman, Jordan, Yasser Arafat renewed appeals to Arab leaders
and communist countries to help end the fighting.
Israeli prisoner exchange assailed
JERUSALEM — Hundreds of Israelis demonstrated yesterday to
denounce the prisoner exchange that freed Palestinians convicted of
murder, and there were demands that Prime Minister Shimon Peres free
Jews accused of attacks on Arabs.
"Murder should not be a basis for negotiation," said Dorit Rosenfeld,
an immigrant from New York City. Her husband. David, was slain three
years ago by one of the 1,150 Palestinians and Lebanese exchanged
Monday for three Israelis captured in the 1982 Lebanon invasion.
"Prisoners of war, that's one thing, but for my husband's murderers to
serve only three years, I can't understand it," Rosenfeld said.
She joined hundreds of Jewish settlers from the West Bank in a
demonstration outside Parliament to protest the exchange and to
demand pardons for a group of 25 Jews convicted or standing trial in a
series of attacks on West Bank Palestinians.
The controversy set the stage for a political crisis between Peres, head
of the Labor Party, and Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir, the Likud bloc
leader who supports pardons for the underground.
Shamir has called for their release, and if he remains adamant the
issue could bring down the unity in government of Likud and Labor.
Commerce and Industry Minister Ariel Sharon, the former defense
minister who planned the 1982 Lebanon invasion, told Israel radio yes
terday,"it is unimaginable that after the release of the most terrible
murderers ... we should keep the Jewish underground prisoners under
lock and key."
Peres has avoided a direct response to demands for pardoning the
Jewish prisoners. The prime minister's office issued a statement yester
day saying "one cannot mix the subject of redemption of (war) prisoners
with any other issue."
Especially alarming for many Israelis was the government's agreement
to allow 605 of the freed prisoners to remain in Israel or in occupied ter
ritories. Military sources, who spoke on condition they not be named,
said the freed prisoners included 167 convicted of murder.
Reagan letter urges Soviet trade
MOSCOW — Mikhail Gorbachev received a letter from President
Reagan on Monday recommending more trade, and Gorbachev said
commerce could help "defrost" relations between the superpowers, Tass
said.
Both Gorbachev and U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige
stressed at a Kremlin meeting that lasted over two hours that increased
bilateral trade depends on restoring what Gorbachev called "the climate
of mutual trust." accounts of the talks indicated.
The official news agency said Baldrige, who is here for the first top
level superpower trade meeting since 1978. handed Gorbachev a letter
from Reagan that expressed "in general terms the wish for expanding
trade between the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R."
A statement from the American delegation confirmed that Baldrige
gave Gorbachev a letter from Reagan and discussed with him ways in
which trade might improve U.S.-Soviet relations.
Baldrige told Gorbachev "there probably can be no fundamental
change in the trade relationship without parallel improvements in other
aspects of the relationship." U.S. Embassy spokesman Jaroslav Verner
said.
Tass said Gorbachev blamed the United States for what he called the
unsatisfactory state of bilateral trade, and accused Washington of using
it as a political tool.
I he Soviet leader, who previously has coupled calls for a return to
detente with blunt criticism of U.S. policy, was quoted as saying
"efficient and mutually advantageous cooperation" could develop in
several fields.
"It is high time to defrost the potential of Soviet-American coopera
tion. and to freeze — or to be more precise, to stop — the arms race and
the escalation of hostility ." Tass quoted Gorbachev as saying.
"In this respect, business ties between both countries can play their
role." he added.
