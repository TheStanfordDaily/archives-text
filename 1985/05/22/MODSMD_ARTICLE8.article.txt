# Reagan fights for aid to Contras
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The administration and its
supporters in Congress voiced new optimism about
prospects for aid to Nicaraguan rebels yesterday,
despite congressional obstacles that prompted
President Reagan to pound his desk in impatience.
Reagan also met with President Roberto Suazo
Cordova of Honduras, whose government has
placed new restrictions on rebels operating from
Honduran bases. Reagan promised "appropriate
measures" to help that country defend itself in the
event of communist aggression.
In a meeting with Republican congressional
leaders, the president said. "We have got to get to
where we can run a foreign policy without a com
mittee of 535 telling us what to do."
House Minority Leader Robert Michel (R-Ill.)
said it was the second time, in his years of leader
ship meetings with Reagan, that he had seen him
"really put his fist down on the table very audibly."
The other time was on a tax issue.
Reagan, asked if he pounded the desk, said, "I
just kind of slapped it once," and later joked to
reporters that he had "killed a fly."
White House spokesman Larry Speakes,
however, said the president doubled up his fist and
brought it down for emphasis while expressing his
frustration with Congress.
Reagan originally sought $14 million in emer
gency military assistance to rebels fighting

Nicaragua's leftist government, but agreed to a
compromise providing non-lethal assistance after
Congress balked at the original proposal. The
Republican-controlled Senate agreed but the
House, led by Democrats, refused to go along.
Michel and Speakes said the administration now
plans to go back and seek congressional approval
for a $42 million package of non-lethal aid, consist
ing of the $i4 million emergency package plus the
$28 million that Reagan is seeking for the 1986 fis
cal year.
Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole of
Kansas said a bipartisan proposal would probably
be put to a vote in the Senate this week, and Michel
said House action was expected to follow within a
few days.
Both Michel and Speakes said Democrats who
opposed the aid in the vote last month have since
had misgivings because of Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega's well-publicized visit to Moscow
after the vote.
Suazo also touched on this in a picture-taking
session just before his closed meeting with Reagan,
saying, "What the American Congress and the
American people should remember is that 24 hours
after the request . . . was rejected by the Congress,
that President Daniel Ortega was in Moscow saying
hello to the chairman, (Mikhail) Gorbachev, and
the Soviet Communist party."

In an effort to curb recent cross-border attacks
by Nicaraguan forces against rebel units based in
Honduras, the Honduran Army has taken over a
key Contra headquarters just north of the
Nicaraguan-Honduran border, forcing many insur
gents to seek refuge at points farther inside Hon
duras.
For the past several years, the Reagan adminis
tration has been attempting to forge close political
and military ties with Honduras, telling Honduran
authorities privately this is their best defense
against what officials here believe is Nicaragua's
expansionist policies.
In a joint statement following the Reagan-Suazo
meeting, the U.S. and Honduran governments said,
"In case of an armed attack against Honduras, the
United States will take appropriate measures ... to
consult with and support in a timely and effective
manner the government of Honduras in its efforts
to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity
against communist aggression."
A senior administration official, asked whether
the United States would intervene unilaterally in
Honduras* behalf in the event of an armed attack,
answered that Reagan has said repeatedly he was
"not going to stand by" if Honduras was invaded.
The official spoke on condition he not be identi
fied.
