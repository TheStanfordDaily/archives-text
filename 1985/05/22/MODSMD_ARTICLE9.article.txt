# Adm. Rickover accepted $67,628 in gifts
## Navy penalizes General Dynamics 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Navy, ac
cusing General Dynamics Corp. of
"brazen" and "improper" business
conduct, stopped the processing of up
to $1 billion in new contracts yester
day pending reforms in the com
pany's dealings with the Pentagon.
Navy Secretary John Lehman told
a news conference he also would can
cel two existing contracts worth a
total of $22.5 million and would fine
General Dynamics $676,283 for gifts
to retired Adm. Hyman Rickover.
Lehman said the Navy would "hold
off further processing" of pending
contracts with General Dynamics'
Electric Boat Division, including a
planned contract to build the nation's
next half-billion-dollar Trident sub
marine, and with the Pomona Divi
sion, which makes missiles for the
Navy. The total amount of new con
tracts being processed is between
$600 million and $1 billion. None of
the contracts has yet been signed.
To get the process started again,
General Dynamics would have to es
tablish a code of ethics for its officers
and employees; rework and resubmit
millions of dollars in requests for
overhead payments that have
questioned by the Navy; and settff
those disputes.

There was immediate criticism of
Lehman's action on Capitol Hill,
where lawmakers said the Navy sec
retary had been far too lenient with
the giant defense contractor.
"General Dynamics is probably
chuckling," said Rep. John Dingell
(D-Mich.), chairman of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee.

"They are now convinced they have a
wholly owned subsidiary in the De
partment of the Navy and the Trea
sury of the United States."
But Lehman said stopping all work
with a firm that figures so importantly
I in the Pentagon's defense buildup
would be "cutting off your nose to
spite your face." General Dynamics

did $6 billion worth of business with
the Pentagon in fiscal 1984, building
submarines, cruise missiles, F-16
aircraft, M-l tanks and other major
weapons.
Lehman said he hoped the process
would take only a few weeks.
In a statement issued from its St.
Louis headquarters, General

'No gratuity or favor ever affected any
decision I made. The record shows
that I have been consistently tougher
on contractors than any government
official at any time.'
— Adm. Hyman Rickover

Dynamics said, "We have not seen
the documents, but we are deter
mined to work quickly and con
structively with the Department of
the Navy in an effort to resolve all of
the issues raised by today's decision."
For several months. General
Dynamics, the third-largest U.S.
defense contractor, has been under

fire from the Pentagon and the
Congress.
Lehman said he had sent a letter of
censure to Rickover, condemning the
admiral's acceptance of $67,628 in
gratuities from Electric Boat between
1961 and 1977 when he headed the
Navy's nuclear submarine building
program.
The letter, which Lehman said was
the sternest action he could take
against the admiral, represented "a
fall from grace" that should be
viewed in the context of a distin
guished career.
"I think Admiral Rickover should
have acted better," Lehman said. "A
higher standard is expected of an ad
miral in the U.S. Navy." He des
cribed the $67,628 in gifts as "little
trinkets."
Rickover issued a statement saying,
"My conscience is clear. I have al
ways acted in the best interest of the
Navy and my country during my 64
years of military service. No gratuity
or favor ever affected any decision I
made. The record shows that I have
been consistently tougher on contrac
tors than any government official at
