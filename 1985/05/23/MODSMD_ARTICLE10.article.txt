# Six of seven septuplets cling to life
## 
### 
ORANGE â€” The condition of
six surviving septuplets worsened
today as they battled heart and lung
problems and jaundiee, but a doctor
said the ailments were expeeted in
babies born 12 weeks early.
Dr. Carrie Worcester, of Children's
Hospital, said at least three and pos

sibly all of the newborn babies have a
heart problem and all have jaundice
and a lung condition that makes
respirators necessary.
"They're critical and slightly worse.
They're stable," Worcester said at a
hospital news conference. She said
the heart problem involves a duct be

tween the aorta and two pulmonary
arteries that failed to close. As a
result, blood is flooding their lungs,
she said.
In a normal child, the duct closes
immediately after birth, but in
premature babies it's not unusual for
it to remain open.

"It's a serious complication, but it's
something we can treat," she said.
Medication should close the duct, she
said.
Doctors said the mother, Patti Jor
gensen Frustaci would spend up to
three days in intensive care, where
she was in good condition, and up to
seven days in the hospital.
Exhausted "just trying to survive
the day," her husband, Samuel, sqid
he cuddled the dead baby earlier and
prayed for the other infants.
"It gives you some inner strength
to realize this (stillborn) baby hat] a
fighting chance," said Frustaci, add
ing that he and his wife were devout
Mormons. "We feel very strongly this
baby will always be with us."
fes Pane, director of the obstetri
cal nursing service, said that having
the parents hold the dead infant
"helps identify that that baby, even
though it is a stillbirth, is an individ
ual person."
The newborns were on respirators
and were being fed and provided
medication intravenously.
"Hour by hour for the first 12
hours is crucial." said Worcester* a
neonatologist at Children's Hospital,
where the six infants were taken after
their birth at the adjacent St. Joseph
Hospital.
When asked the chances of the six
surviving, Frustaci said, "You just
hope and pray they will come out all
right." !
The surviving babies, designated
only as A, B, C, D, E and F, were
delivered within three minutes start
ing at 8:19 a.m. Tuesday. Frustaci
said the babies will not be named for
at least a couple of days, but their first
names probably will start with the let
ters A through F.
