Child poverty rate up
WASHINGTON — An extra eight children
per 100 were added to the poverty population
from 1973 to 1983, lifting the child poverty rate
to 22.2 per 100, the highest since the mid-19605,
a congressional study showed yesterday.
In 1983, the last full year for which statistics
are available, nearly 13.8 million youngsters
lived in poverty, and poor children represented
40 percent of the total poor population in the
United States, it showed.
The study showed that almost half of all black
children and more than one-third of all Hispanic
children were poor. In contrast, it said, nearly
five-sixths of all white children did not fall into
the poverty population.
"If you are under 6 years old in the United
States, you are six times more likely to be poor
than if you are over age 65," said Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) "We are the first in
dustrial nation in the world in which children arc
the poorest age group."

Budget passage seen
WASHINGTON — House Republicans yes
terday denounced as "smokescreens, magic and
sleight of hand" a 1986 budget plan cutting $56
billion in spending without touching Social Se
curity benefits, but joined with Democrats in
predicting its easy passage.
Final approval of the deficit-reduction pack
age, which would trim spending by $253 billion
over the next three years, was expected today.
"I'd be greatly surprised if the budget wasn't
adopted," said Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill
(D-Mass.), whose party controls the House by a
253-182 majority.
The Democratic plan would make smaller cuts
in domestic programs than a version passed by
the Republican-led Senate earlier this month,
while cutting far more sharply into President
Reagan's military buildup. Neither plan would
raise taxes.

Budget Committee Chairman William Gray 111.

(D-Pa.), told the House: "The time has come to
significantly slow the growth of Pentagon spend
ing."
The House budget would freeze military
spending authority at 1985 levels while the Sen
ate's would allow it to rise with the rate of infla
tion.
