PAC contributions told
SACRAMENTO— Nine political action com
mittees representing California's most powerful
special interests have each contributed $1 million
or more to state legislative candidates since the
state's political reform law took effect a decade
ago, a watchdog organization reported yesterday.
The California Medical PAC. the lobbying arm
of the California Medical Association, led the
list, donating $2.5 million between 1975 and
19K4. One other organization topped $2 million
— the California State Employees Association,
which contributed $2.09 million.
Combined donations by the nine major con
tributors— described as "Super PACs" by Com
mon Cause — topped $14.3 million. Common
Cause Executive Director Walter Zelman said.

Last year, the Super PACs contributed nearly
15 percent of the total $49.55 million donated to
st;ite legislative candidates from all sources.
Strike helps competitors
SAN DIEGO — The week-old strike by
United Airlines pilots left thousands of travelers
scrambling for flights, and that has meant boom
times for some of United's competitors.
Passenger traffic on Pacific Southwest Airlines
and American Airlines has soared since United's
pilots walked out, although spokesmen for the
competing airlines say some of that increase is at
tributable to the onset of the summer travel
season.
American Airlines planes have been flying at
about 85 percent capacity, up from a pre-strike
average of 65 percent, said John Hotard, an

American Airlines spokesman.
At PSA, passenger traffic was up between 20
percent and 25 percent compared to last year's
level at this time, PSA spokesman Bill Hastings
said.
Although the strike could end at any time,
Hastings said it could produce long-term
dividends for other airlines.
"If we do our job right, these people (strike
affected passengers) will be back," he said.
