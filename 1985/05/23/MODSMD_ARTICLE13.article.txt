## Life Flight puts an ambulance in the air 
### DAVID EMERSON 
A woman visiting Portola Valley is
struck by congestive heart failure.
Fluid builds up in her lungs; she starts
to drown internally. Paramedics rush
to her, but due to the distance and the
narrow, winding roads, their progress
is painfully slow. A year ago, this
woman would most likely have died.
Today, she's alive and healthy, thanks
to a program called Life Flight.
Life Flight, an emergency helicop
ter transport service which marked its
lirst year of operation May 1, arrived
on the scene in less than 10
minutes. It carried a fully qualified
emergency room doctor, who began
treatment immediately and continued
administering medicine throughout
the return flight. The prompt action
of the Life Flight team saved criticial
minutes, which in this case were to be
the difference between life and death.
During its first year, the
Aerospatiale 1 win Star jet helicopter
flown by Life Flight has participated
in almost 300 rescues of this kind.
Operated jointly by the Stanford
University Hospital and the Santa
Clara Valley Medical Center, it is the
o'nly medical transport service in
Northern California which routinely
carries a doctor on board.
George Sternbach, acting director
of the emergency department at the
Stanford Hospital and a member of
the Life Flight team, was the doctor
on call in the Portola Valley case. He
remembers, "When we arrived, her
condition was so critical that we
began treatment in the car she was
seated in, without taking the time to
move her. She was very, very serious
and would have died within minutes.
It's rare that you find an instance
where you can make as much of a dif
ference right away.
"We got in there and got out
before the ambulance arrived," he
noted.
The Life Flight helicopter cruises at
up to 170 mph and covers a radius of
up to 150 miles. The crew consists of
a doctor and flight nurse, as well as
the pilot. With room to carry two
patients, the Twin Star is equipped

with intravenous equipment, medica
tions, monitoring systems, extrication
devices to stabilize a patient as he or
she is being removed from a vehicle,
built-in suction to clear airways,
oxygen, compressed air and a ven
tilator for respiratory assistance.
All this equipment and the doctor
who goes with it gives Life Flight an
enormous advantage over normal
paramedics, according to Chief Flight
Nurse Marcia Katz. Doctors can carry
out procedures that paramedics are
inexperienced in or prohibited from
performing. "They have to call their
base station in order to receive
permission to act," Katz said. "We
are the base station. We bring the
hospital out to the patient."
Besides being fully trained emer
gency room doctors, Life Flight
physicians are instructed in special
areas such as transporting spinal in
juries and the removal of people from
cars.
Nurses in the program spend a
minimum of two months getting spe
cial training before entering active
service. This training includes such
diverse disciplines as altitude physiol
ogy, public speaking, marketing
skills, transporting patients and
working at an accident scene with
paramedics.
Since beginning last May, the pro
gram has expanded significantly.
During that first month of activity,
the helicopter responded to 15 emer
gency calls. Last month, there were
52.
The Life Flight craft gets two basic
kinds of calls. First, there are the on
site trauma calls. The majority of
these consist of traffic accidents, al
though there are a great variety of
cases. In these instances, the first
responder (sheriff, highway patrol,
etc.) makes a request for a helicopter
through the county.
The county then calls either Life
Flight or Calstar, a rival helicopter
rescue service, and relays the request.
Life Flight Program Coordinator
Judy Colwell said that the county
makes the determination on whom to

call on the basis of alternate days, doctor — somthing Calstar does not
regardless of the fact that the Life do. "There's a real question about
Flight program regularly carries a that," she said.

Once it has received a request for
assistance, the Life Flight team is air
borne inside three to five minutes.
Most scene calls tend to be within a
20 to 30 mile radius, leaving the
helicopter a flight of 10 minutes or
less.
Upon arrival, the team immedi
ately swings into action. Sternbach
recalls a case in which an accident
along Highway 1 near Pigeon Point
left two people trapped in a car. The
first patient was quickly removed and
transported back to the hospital by
the flight nurse. Sternbach remained
with the second trapped patient and
began treatment even before he was
extricated from his smashed automo
bile. Just as the second patient was
freed, the helicopter returned.
"It was a remarkable bit of
timing," said Sternbach. "Although
they were both pretty seriously
injured, they're doing well now. Un
doubtedly, the ability to start treat
ment at the scene, as well as rapid
evacuation to the hospital, made a big
difference."
The other type of request that Life
Flight receives is transporting
patients from smaller hospitals un
equipped to handle difficult cases.
"You need to get these patients to
other hospitals, and you need spe
cially trained people to transport
them," Katz said. "You can't just
throw any nurse in the back of an am
bulance and expect them to know
what they're going to need, how to
trouble-shoot equipment, etc. Trans
portation is a whole different
specialty."
Katz cited cases of moving a 9-
month-old baby with bad burns from
San Luis Obispo and transporting a
critical heart patient from Santa Cruz
as examples of Life Flight's long

range and versatility. "The cardiovas
cular patient would have taken over
an hour to get to Stanford by ground.
It was an 11-minute flight," she said.
Sometimes the transfer of patients
can be just as criticial as responding
to "scene calls." One 27-year-old
man was in a motorcycle accident
which ripped a hole in his heart. The
small hospital he was taken to was not
equipped to handle major heart sur
gery, and Life Flight was called in.
The doctor on board the craft called
ahead to the hospital for emergency
surgery, and the heart was sewn up
immediately upon arrival.
Flight nurse for the case was Tony
Leiker. He said, "This man surely
would have died if he'd been
transported by ground amublance,
because he was bleeding so badly. We
got him to the hospital fast. He had
surgery, and a few weeks later, he
walked out."
The Life Flight service itself costs
$225 for lift-off and $12 a mile for
the return trip, according to Judy
Colwell. There is no charge for can
celing the call in flight, and overall
the costs can be "very similar" to
those of a ground ambulance —
depending on time and distance.
As for the future, Sternbach sees
"the trend is getting larger. We're
getting more well known to medical
providers, and they're happy with our
services." In the long term, he
predicts that "helicopters will play a
greater role in rural emergency medi
cal care, but in urban areas ground
ambulances will always be more effi
cient."
Dr. Michael Eliastam, local Life
Flight program director, is even more
optimistic. "My prediction for the
future," he says, "is that more and
more patients will be transported by
air rather than ground."



The Life Flight helicopter has been in operation since last May. During
its first month, it received 15 calls, but has grown over the year and now

handles more than 50 calls a month. The helicopter can reach a patient
who is 30 miles away in as little as 15 minutes.
