## The
						Stanford Daily Dedication apprehension 
### 
Today the Center for Integrated Systems (CIS)
will be dedicated with pomp and .festivity. Yet
amid the celebration which will mark the dedica
tion of this $15 million laboratory and office
complex, we should mark this event with a
demonstration of our questioning and concern.
"The relationship among government, industry
and the universities will be more important in the
next decade than it has ever been," according to
James Gibbons, executive committee chairman
of CIS. CIS goes a long way in strengthening the
working relationship between Stanford and in
dustry. Our concern is focused upon the behavior
and social impact of the companies with which
Stanford is strengthening ties.
Among the industrial sponsors who played a
major role in funding CIS are IBM, Motorola,
Hewlett-Packard and Xerox. The debate on
divestment has brought to light the questionable
social impact of these companies with operations
in South Africa.
U.S. computer companies control 75 percent
of the computer market in South Africa. Com
puter technology has played a strategic role in
creating a militarized national security-state ap
paratus in South Africa. IBM, for example, plays
a key role in the national identity system main
tained by South Africa's Department of the Inte

rior, sells equipment to the South African
Defense Force, and markets a computer program
known as "Law Enforcement System" to local
police. While IBM has been perhaps the most
blatant abuser of the South African majority, we
should keep in mind that it has been common
practice in South Africa for so-called non
repressive agencies to purchase equipment for
the police and military.
Should Stanford accept funding from any
source? We believe criteria must be established
to prevent the University from being tied to com
panies determined to be socially injurious.
Through the development of CIS, University re
search on computer electronics and semiconduc
tors will be more closely tied to the needs of those
corporations which funded this venture. While
the verdict is not in on the social role of the com
panies inovlved in funding CIS, step one is to
choose the jury.
For those in the Stanford community who
share our concerns, we urge you to attend the
noon teach-in today at the Inner Quad which will
explore the social implications of developments
in computer technology. As well, we believe it is
fitting for members of the Stanford community
to express their concern at the dedication of CIS
at 4 p.m. today.
