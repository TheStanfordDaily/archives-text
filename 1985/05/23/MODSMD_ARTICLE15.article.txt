# Write a column for The Daily
## 
### 
"Write for The Daily? Moi?" Why, you are probably
asking yourself, would I want to write for a 12-page news
paper with a one-page style guide and a sports section
larger than The New York Post's? Prestige; yes, that's
right, prestige. Writing for the Peninsula's only daily
(except weekends, holidays, dead week, quarter breaks,
finals week, most of the summer and when we don't feel
like it) newspaper carries a certain cachet that mere
wealth, good looks, social position or famous parents just
can't afford you.

My association with The Daily has provided me nothing
but happy memories. As a matter of fact, the celebrity
Twister match — Keith Kaplan and I versus the Dollies —
was probably the high point of my entire career. And
Dollies, Keith wants you to know that he's sorry about the
Wesson oil and that he thinks you're all real good sports.
Playing in the Jim Serpico Celebrity Pro-Am Pinball
Tourney was also quite an honor, although if they want
me to come back next year they're going to have to get me
a better partner than Don Kennedy. Really, 1 don't care
how badly the guy wants to hob nob with the beautiful
people; he chokes when the special's lit.
Of course, there's more to writing for The Daily than
luxuriating in the spotlight of public adoration. There's
the free food. Toward the end of winter quarter we
adopted "Zee best table in zee house for zee Daily colum
neests" as our unofficial motto. We have an official motto
too — "Sic transit gloria mundi" — but we don't use that
one very often because none of us knows what it means.
We adopted the unofficial motto because of all the free
meals we ate. Sleazy restaurateurs, in the faint hope that
they could garner some free publicity for their less-than
three-star establishments, showered us with freebies. I'm
just glad that Ray Kroc didn't live to see it.
The actual writing of the columns was simplicitly itself.
Although it was disconcerting at first to have the opinions
editor, Julie Ryan, following me around all day with a
tape recorder, I eventually got used to it. I never did get
used to constant whining, though. I mean really. I bet she
sings a different tune when she's trying to get an extension
from one of her professors.
Editor in Chief Tim "Which one are you?" Grieve was
a pillar of strength for us all. The friendly staffers — well.

they were friendly until they found out I hadn't just
stopped in to drop off a want ad — were a joy to work
with. The typesetting staff did a marvelous job, only
drastically changing the meaning of a few minor sen
tences; and they more than made up for that when they
confused me with cousin Tim on the Expos.
More than a few prestigious awards fell to this year's
columnists. Jason Matherly, for instance, won the
ACLU's annual Falwell Award (outstanding service in
making liberal ideas seem reasonable by comparison). Bill
Evers and I stunned the academic community by trounc
ing, 1-0-11, Santayana and Kierkegaard in the Philadel
phia Society for Philosophic Inquiry's annual debate
series. Tom Kearney received a special award from the
World Wrestling Federation (WWF) for "Most Promising
Young Ego."
Naturally, from our position at the top of the journalis
tic world, we were able to rub elbows with hoi polloi.
Steve Debenham was featured on "Hollywood Squares,"
and Jim Naureckas related his "most embarrassing mo
ment" to Dick Clark, or was it Ed McMahon? Stephen
Churchill traveled to Washington, D.C., where Njmcy
Reagan presented him "with a pair of hand-knitted mit
tens. "So," she told him, "you won't get chapped hands
playing in the nuclear winter wonderland, dear."
Unfortunately, our tenure at The Daily was not free
from tragedy. We were all saddened when Henri, the head
waiter at La Cote Basque — fine dining at reasonable
rates with courteous service and a splendid view of the
City, reservations recommended, MC, AE, DC, Visa —
flung himself out of a 42nd-story window upon hearing
Robyn Weisman pronounce the flambeed Quake "a tad
too Quisp-like for my taste." On a more personal note, I
nearly developed sunstroke during the 36 straight hours 1
spent in White Plaza waiting to be button-holed by a
nubile young co-ed anxious to learn Life's Mysteries.
The only hint of controversy during our tenure at The
Daily occurred when Darieck Scott refused to stop
making the rest of us look bad. Talent is no excuse for bad
manners. We got even, though, by sneaking one of his
columns into The Stanford Observer. If that doesn't kill
his literary career, nothing will.
I would love to report that last year's columnists are
doing as fabulously well as we are; I'm sure that they are.
It's just that no one down at the paper can remember who
any of them were. They've probably all retired by now,
living high on the hog on the royalties from their
autobiographies.
So, do fame, fortune and free food appeal to you? Do
you think you have what it takes to write for The Daily,
i.e. wit, wisdom and a No. 2 pencil? If so, apply today.
Who knows, you too could awaken one morning and find
a camera crew from "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous"
parked beneath your bedroom window.
