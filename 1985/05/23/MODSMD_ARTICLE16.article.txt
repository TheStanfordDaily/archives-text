## Banish missiles to the ocean 
### 
In a recent journal of the National Academy of Sciences
(Issues, Winter 1985), Harold Agnew, who is the former
director of the Los Alamos Weapons Laboratory, seems
to carry President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative
(SDI) considerably beyond its original intent. Agnew's
proposals are, to say the least, original and would, if they
could be implemented, probably achieve the goals he and
all the rest of us desire.

VIEWPOINT

Unfortunately, Agnew's proposals would require
breakthroughs in political thinking far more dramatic than
the scientific breakthroughs needed to materialize SDI.
He suggests that the space-based component of the SDI
be put in the hands of a world body or world court, with
the defense of Russia being the responsibility of the
American contingent, and the defense of America put in
the hands of the Russians. This puts the Americans, for
example, in the dual role of first launching the missiles
and then destroying them. This would make great fun for
the weapons laboratories, but it would be cheaper to
destroy the missiles before they are launched. The idea of
putting the space component of SDI in the hands of a
world body without making specific assignments would
seem to make more sense, but again the history of the re
lations between national states and world courts is not
promising.
If the kind of political breakthrough needed to imple
ment Agnew's plan could actually be achieved, then the
military component of the strategic defense would prob
ably not be needed at all. Thus, we do not feel the need to
be defended against British or French missiles, though the
French, with seven submarines, could destroy every major
city in both the United States and the Soviet Union in a
short afternoon.
Implementing the SDI would evidently require a very
large expenditure. Estimates by the Commission on Eco
nomic Priorities range from $400 billion to $800 billion,
with higher numbers favored by James Schlesinger,
former secretary of defense. Since we do not wish to
destroy the Soviet Union, but only to modify its behavior,
there may be other, better ways to expend this huge ef
fort. For example, $600 billion is enough to buy a brand
new luxury automobile for every one of the Soviet
Union's 60 million families.
In reality, there exists a far cheaper and, I believe, more
practical way to defend our territory against nuclear at
tack. Move the land-based missiles, the likely targets of

such an attack, out to sea, away from the population. With
our land-based missiles gone, no nation could gain a sig
nificant military advantage by attacking U.S. territory.
Do we need the land-based missiles to make deterrence
credible? The answer is surely no. In his 1978 State of the
Union address, President Carter announced to Congress
that a single U.S. Poseiden submarine carries enough war
heads to destroy every large and medium-sized city in the
Soviet Union. We have 30 such submarines and are now
adding the much larger Trident. Such submarines can
destroy land-based missiles, but the land-based missiles
cannot target them.
In fact, with the land-based missiles on the target list,
our only reliable deterrent is the submarine force. Ac
cording to Admiral Sir James Eberle, even if the Soviets
launched a first strike, taking out every land-based
missile, every airfield and every submarine in port, there
would still be enough American warheads at sea to fire
one every 30 seconds for 24 hours. Each of these war
heads is about 10 times as powerful as the Hiroshima
bomb.

Do we need land-based
missiles to make deterrence
credible?

It is said that we need the "triad" of forces in case one
or another of the systems were to fail. Thus, the sub
marines might fail if advances in submarine detection
made the oceans "transparent." Of course, the space
above the land-based missiles and the airfields is already
transparent. If technology does eventually make the sub
marines visible, we might have to abandon the large Tri
dent in favor of a number of smaller "midgetman" subs.
With military targets gone from our home territory, the
Soviets could still, of course, destroy our civilian popula
tion. To do so, however, would invite the nuclear winter.
Our submarine missiles, if exploded on the land, could
also create a nuclear winter. The submarine force is thus
the ideal deterrent, one that cannot be attacked and must
never be used.
