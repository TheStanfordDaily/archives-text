Use carrot and stick
I write in response to the letter
Eric Fajer and friends wrote (The
Daily, May 20) urging students not
to donate to Stanford until the Uni
versity divests from companies doing
business in South Africa. While I am
in complete agreement with the goals
that Fajer, et al., espouse — total
divestment at Stanford and abolition
of apartheid in South Africa — I
would like to suggest a more con
structive approach than simply "do
not donate." This is the establishment
of an Endowment for Divestiture, a
fund to which Stanford students and
alumni could contribute which would
be given to the University upon
divestiture and responsibly invested
in the interim.
A fund of this type would offer
students and alumni a way to show
their support for the positive aspects
of Stanford but also to hold the
University morally accountable for
its investments. While most Univer
sity development officers cringe at
the idea of a single-issue giving
campaign — they have to deal with
the Old Guard who threatened to
stop contributing when Stanford
dropped the Indian as its mascot —
the idea of our donations indirectly
supporting apartheid should be
enough to make us think twice
before giving unrestricted gifts.
Apartheid, and American corpora
tions' role in its perpetuation, is an
issue which transcends the pleas of

"fiduciary responsibility" (read
"profits") from the trustees. Mem
bers of the Stanford community can
no longer wade on in the "selective
indifference" that has characterized
our investment policy de jure for the
past eight years and de facto since
American companies first invested in
an apartheid South Africa.
Concerned students at Harvard
University set up an Endowment for
Divestiture in 1983, and many mem
bers of the senior class fund-raising
drive were active in soliciting contri
butions to this alternative fund.
Prominent Harvard alumni, like Sen.
Edward Kennedy, lent their support
to the effort. How the idea will fare
remains to be seen, but such a fund
is surely viable at Stanford. Given
the ingenuity and financial acuity of
most Stanford students, we could
design a similar program without
much difficulty.
"Do not donate" cuts off our nose
to spite our face. While it would be
deluding ourselves to think that our
donations — or lack thereof — will
alone change the trustees' minds
(alumni annual giving is a small
percentage of the operating budget,
and socially responsible annual
giving would be even smaller), it is
another tactic in the struggle for
divestment. An endowment for
divestiture offers not only the stick
of non-donation, but also the carrot
of an escrow fund growing undei
responsible moral and financial
strictures. A meeting with our

friends at Working Assets would be
a good place to start.

Not for everybody
In response to Dennis Backlund's
recent letter, 1 would like to clarify
the nature of the study of values and
the nature and purpose of the Tan
ner Lectures.
Philosophic study of values has
influenced our civilization again and
again. Yet great thinkers like Plato
or Spinoza, as well as the discussions
by lesser figures at the universities
and their specialized vocabulary,
were often not understood or even
available to the general public. With
the 20/20 vision of hindsight, we
regard the works of Plato or Kant
intelligible to wider audiences; they
were not so regarded at the time of
their creation.
The Tanner Lectures are supposed
to present the results of original
research in the field of ethics and
human values. One cannot expect
that all such work would be intel
ligible to the average lay person. The
Tanner lecturer does interact with
Stanford undergraduates and with
faculty and students of many depart
ments. Last year's lectures were of
interest to the Department of Music,
and next year's lectures will relate
certain philosophical issues to
literature.
We shall continue to invite original

thinkers who have something to say
about human values that is of inter
est not only to philosophers. In
different years different departments
and their students will be the
beneficiaries. To say that the lectures
are open to the public is to say that
the audience will not be restricted to
a particular discipline.
We hope that in any given year
some segment of the Palo Alto com
munity might find the lectures useful,
but it would be unrealistic to expect
that the presentation of the frontiers
of research in any field should be
intelligible to all segments of the
general educated public.

Techie/fuzz experts
As I read Tracy Furutani's discus
sion in the May 16 Daily regarding
the argument over units for "techic"
versus "fuzzy" courses. 1 was struck
by the similarity of the current argu
ments about comparable pay for
"comparable" worth.
Let me suggest that the University
hire some of the brilliant consultants
who have recently devised a scheme
to measure the comparability of
librarians and firemen and foresters
and street sweepers and nurses. They
should be well-qualified to resolve
the "techie/fuzzy" course value
question.
