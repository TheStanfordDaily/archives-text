High-tech fields, often seen as of
fering equal opportunities and pay for
women, are in fact just as gender
segregated as older industries, ac
cording to a new national study by re
searchers at Stanford.
"High tech may produce integrated
circuits, but it does not necessarily
produce an integrated work force or
eliminate the female/male earning
differential," the report, written by
Myra Strober and Carolyn Arnold,
researchers at Stanford's Institute for
Research on Educational Finance

Women's annual and hourly earn
ings are less than men's in certain
high-tech fields even after age and

according to the report. The re
searchers also said women in techni
cal fields are less likely to hold
managerial or professional-technical
jobs than women in non-technical
fields.
Men dominate prestigious jobs in
the high-paying industries that create
high technology, while women are
relegated to jobs in the lower-paying
industries that use the technology, the
report finds.
The report, based on comparisons
of 1970 and 1980 census data, ex
amines the place of women in the de
velopment of high-tech industries
from the first room-sized computer in
the 1940s to the widespread use of
silicon chip of the 1970s and '80s.
" The notion is that new occupa
tions, like high technology, are less
sex-stereotvped than longer-existing
occupations and might be open to
more occupational integration."
Strober, the director of IFG, said in
an interview with The Daily. "That is
just not the case, at least not for high
tech occupations."
Strober said that while there are
many women working on the "cutting
