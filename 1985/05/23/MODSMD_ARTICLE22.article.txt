## One doubles team also left at NCAAs Fendick, Gates reach semis 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
OKLAHOMA CITY — If people
questioned the legitimacy of Stan
ford's women's tennis team when the
top-seeded Cardinal lost in the quar
terfinals of the NCAA team competi
tion here, they won't anymore.
After two days of individual singles
and doubles play, three of the five
Stanford netters who began the tour
naments are still alive. Two of them
— Linda Gates and Patty Fendick —
will play in separate singles semifinals
this morning. In the afternoon. Gates
and Leigh Anne Eldredge will play in
the doubles quarterfinals and then, if
victorious, the semifinals, too.
"We didn't use up any luck in the
team portion, so we're using it in the
individuals," Cardinal Coach Frank
Brennan joked yesterday."I also
think we have a hell of a lot to prove
here.
"1 think the Stanford players are
hungry. Really hungry. 1 think they
want to get back a little respect and
pride."
In the process, Stanford may very
well get NCAA singles and doubles
titles.
Gates and Fendick can assure the
Cardinal its first NCAA singles
champion since Alycia Moulton in
1982 by winning their singles
semifinals today and setting up an all-
Stanford final tomorrow. It would be
the first time that two players from
the same school meet for the
women's collegiate singles national
championship.
And the way Gates and Fendick
have been playing, it is a distinct pos
sibility. Gates meets USC's Caroline
Kuhlman, seeded third, in one semi,
and Fendick gets top-seeded
Gretchen Rush of Trinity (Texas) in

the other.
The eighth-seeded Gates, who
Tuesday suddenly began playing what
Brennan is calling "the best tennis of
her life," continued her awesome
ways yesterday. Gates struggled early
against Lise Gregory of Miami (Fla.),
then caught fire to win 7-6, 6-0. In
the quarterfinals, Gates was even bet
ter and was no match for Beverly
Bowes of Texas, blasting the second
seed, 6-2, 6-2.
" Linda was very consistant," Bren
nan said of Gates, a doubles winner
and a singles finalist last year. "She's
continued in the awesome mode. The
Texas coach (Bob Moore) tame over
to me after she beat Bowes and said,
• Where'd you get that pro?' "
Gates is one of two semifinalists
who has yet to lose a set in the 64-
player singles tournament. The other,
to no one's surprise, is Fendick. Fen
dick, who is not entered in the
doubles, had a relatively easy time
yesterday, winning two more straight
set matches and extending her win
ning streak to 44 sets.
In the round of 16, Fendick beat
UCLA's Jane Thomas when Thomas
defaulted with back problems in the
first game of the second set. Then in
the quarterfinals, the Cardinal sopho
more recorded a 6-3, 6-2 victory over
a tired Ronni Ries, the sixth seed
from Miami, who was mentally and
physically drained from a three-set
match in the morning.
"I was kind of disappointed about
my first one because I hate to win a
match when someone gets hurt," said
Fendick, who had won the first set 6-
3 against Thomas.
"1 think I played well against
Ries," Fendick continued. "I had a

semifinals of the NCAA singles competition in Oklahoma City.
little bit of trouble handling her serve
at first. But once I got in the groove, I
was fine."
In the doubles, Gates and Eldredge
got a scare from unheralded Jill
Braendle and Sandy Sadler of Wich
ita State, but in the end came away
with a victory despite a subpar per
formance. The third-seeded Gates
and Eldredge lost the first set 6-2,
then woke up to take the second and
third, 6-3, 6-1.
"They're going to have to play a lot
better," Brennan said of his No. 1
team, which faces fifth-seeded Linda
Howell and Cindy MacGregor of San
Diego State in the quarterfinals.
"That was a little inconsistent today."
The only Cardinal netters to lose
were giant killers Stephanie Savides
and Kay Tittle. The pair, who
upended fourth-seeded Kuhlman and
Mary Norwood of USC yesterday,
couldn't do it again today and fell to
Texas' Diane Dopson and Gen
Greiwe, 6-3, 6-1.
For the most part, the singles and
doubles seedings have held true to

form. Only one of the singles and two
of the doubles quarterfinalsts were
not seeded in the top eight.
Card notes
The last time Stanford had two
singles players in the semifinals was
four years ago when Moulton and
Elise Burgin played in separate semi
finals. Moulton won, but Burgin lost
to the eventual champion.
Neither Gates nor Fendick has
played a complete match this season
against her semifinal opponent. Gates
did face Kuhlman in a Stanford-USC
dual match March 27 in Los Angeles,
but Kuhlman badly sprained her
ankle and was forced to default in the
second game. Kuhlman did not play
again until last Thursday, in the
opening round of the team champion
ships here.
The top-seeded Rush may not be a
favorite today against Fendick. To
say the least, Rush had her problems
advancing to the semifinals yesterday.
In the round of 16, Rush rebounded
from a 4-2 deficit in the third set to
beat California's Heather Ettus, and
then had to go three sets agaisnt
unseeded Tammy Whittington of
Florida.
