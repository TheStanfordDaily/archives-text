## One doubles team also left at NCAAs Fendick, Gates reach semis 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
OKLAHOMA CITY — If people
questioned the legitimacy of Stan
ford's women's tennis team when the
top-seeded Cardinal lost in the quar
terfinals of the NCAA team competi
tion here, they won't anymore.
After two days of individual singles
and doubles play, three of the five
Stanford netters who began the tour
naments are still alive. Two of them
— Linda Gates and Patty Fendick —
will play in separate singles semifinals
this morning. In the afternoon. Gates
and Leigh Anne Eldredge will play in
the doubles quarterfinals and then, if
victorious, the semifinals, too.
"We didn't use up any luck in the
team portion, so we're using it in the
individuals," Cardinal Coach Frank
Brennan joked yesterday."I also
think we have a hell of a lot to prove
here.
"1 think the Stanford players are
hungry. Really hungry. 1 think they
want to get back a little respect and
pride."
In the process, Stanford may very
well get NCAA singles and doubles
titles.
Gates and Fendick can assure the
Cardinal its first NCAA singles
champion since Alycia Moulton in
1982 by winning their singles
semifinals today and setting up an all-
Stanford final tomorrow. It would be
the first time that two players from
the same school meet for the
women's collegiate singles national
championship.
And the way Gates and Fendick
have been playing, it is a distinct pos
sibility. Gates meets USC's Caroline
Kuhlman, seeded third, in one semi,
and Fendick gets top-seeded
Gretchen Rush of Trinity (Texas) in

the other.
The eighth-seeded Gates, who
Tuesday suddenly began playing what
Brennan is calling "the best tennis of
her life," continued her awesome
ways yesterday. Gates struggled early
against Lise Gregory of Miami (Fla.),
then caught fire to win 7-6, 6-0. In
the quarterfinals, Gates was even bet
ter and was no match for Beverly
Bowes of Texas, blasting the second
seed, 6-2, 6-2.
" Linda was very consistant," Bren
nan said of Gates, a doubles winner
and a singles finalist last year. "She's
continued in the awesome mode. The
Texas coach (Bob Moore) tame over
to me after she beat Bowes and said,
• Where'd you get that pro?' "
Gates is one of two semifinalists
who has yet to lose a set in the 64-
player singles tournament. The other,
to no one's surprise, is Fendick. Fen
dick, who is not entered in the
doubles, had a relatively easy time
yesterday, winning two more straight
set matches and extending her win
ning streak to 44 sets.
In the round of 16, Fendick beat
UCLA's Jane Thomas when Thomas
defaulted with back problems in the
first game of the second set. Then in
the quarterfinals, the Cardinal sopho
more recorded a 6-3, 6-2 victory over
a tired Ronni Ries, the sixth seed
from Miami, who was mentally and
physically drained from a three-set
match in the morning.
"I was kind of disappointed about
my first one because I hate to win a
match when someone gets hurt," said
Fendick, who had won the first set 6-
3 against Thomas.
"1 think I played well against
Ries," Fendick continued. "I had a
