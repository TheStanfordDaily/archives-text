### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
Stanford Men's Basketball
Coach Tom Davis was named the
coach of the West team at the Na
tional Sports Festival this summer.
The announcement was made yes
terday by the U.S. Olympic Com
mittee and the Amateur Basket
ball Association of the U.S.A.
"it's quite an honor because it's
based on the observations of our
fellow coaches in the profession,"
Davis said.

The festival will be held in
Baton Rouge, La., from July 21 to
Aug. 1. It is the largest amateur
sporting event in the country, with
3.000 athletes competing in 34
sports.
"It's really a festival — a real
happening," Davis said. "There'll
probably be a number of Stanford
athletes invited. It's sort of a start
for the next Olympics."
Davis will be in some good com
pany in Baton Rouge. St. John's

Coach Lou Carnesecca of the East
heads a list that also includes
Kansas' Larry Brown from the
North and Alcorn State's Dave
Whitney from the South.
Carnesecca's Redmen reached
the Final Four of the NCAA
tournament this year, and Brown's
Jayhawks made the tournament as
well.
"I've coached against Coach
Carnesecca a few times," said
Davis, who came to Stanford from
Boston College, a Big East rival of
St. John's. "We're like the players
— we like to go up against the best
in the country.
"It's mostly a players' competi
tion. There are only four or five
practices, so I'm not sure how
much coaching will have an effect
on the games."
College freshmen and high
school seniors will be eligible to
compete in the Sports Festival be
cause they will still be in school
when the 1988 Olympics are held.
Davis said he has nominated
current freshmen Greg Butler and
Eric Reveno for the team, as well
as the five incoming freshmen he
recruited for next season. "It's a
chance for a player from here to
make it. I'm on the selection com
mittee, and I'll work to get a Stan
ford player at the Sports Festival."
The reputation of the West in
basketball was hurt by a poor
showing two years ago at the last
Sports Festival, as well as by its
performance in the NCAA tourn
ament this season. "There's some

pressure because the West team
didn't play well last time. There's
some concern about the West
representing itself better than in the
past," Davis said.
The trip to Baton Rouge won't be
Davis' only traveling over the sum
mer. Early next month, Davis will
speak at a clinic at the European
Championships in Stuttgart, West
Germany.
Later in June, Davis will coach an
all-star team from the Pacific 10 Con
ference on a 15-day, seven-game tour
of Australia. Stanford forward Earl
Koberlein will be one of the 10
players on that team.
"We've got some recruiting to do
in July," Davis added. "It'll be busy,
but it'll be fun."
