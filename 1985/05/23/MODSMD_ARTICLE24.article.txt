They were the only two baseball players to
start all 65 games for Stanford last year. They
are both All-Pacific 10 Conference first team
selections this season, and they both hit their
fourth home runs of the season last Friday
against California.
What Stanford second baseman Pete
Stanicek and shortstop John Verducci have
most in common, though, is the respect they
have for each other off the field as well as on.
That respect and friendship is obvious to
anyone who has seen the two players to
gether. Laughing and smiling, poking fun and
fists at each other, Stanicek and Verducci
seem like two little boys.
"I could pat Pete on the back all day," Ver
ducci says with a mischievious look in his eye.
"But I won't."
Stanicek retaliates when asked to elaborate
on influences Verducci has had on his playing.
Glancing at his teammate, Stanicek shrugs
and calmly replies, "None."
This good-natured bantering is as charac
teristic of Stanicek and Verducci as their ex
cellent defensive skills and hitting ability.
Yet it is easy to tell how much these two
teammates genuinely care about each other.
After a comment about how sick he is of
playing with Verducci for four years, Stanicek
flashes a smile by way of apology, and
proceeds to heap compliments on his
teammate.
"No doubt he's one of the best shortstops,
as well as a clutch hitter. He's the anchor of
the team." Stanicek says.
Verducci, beneath the teasing, also has his
share of pride in Stanicek.
"There's probably no one that doesn't like

him," Verducci says, "He's got a good per
spective, and he's going to go places."
The duo also had a lot to say about the ef
fects each has on the other's playing. Verducci
said he feels feels much of their success is a
result of their friendship on the field.
"We're pulling for each other. We pick
each other up during a game," Verducci says.
"He makes it easier for me to play my posi
tion."
"We get competitive with guys on the team
as much as the opposition," Stanicek says.
"We always push each other and try to be bet
ter than the other. We're competitive with
each other, but it's helpful."
Stanicek explains that the second baseman
and shortstop traditionally have to communi
cate a great deal on the field. As Coach Mark
Marquess says, "All the action happens down
the middle."
The long-standing relationship between
Stanicek and Verducci has enabled them to
master this aspect of playing, and they both
know what to expect from each other now.
As members of the nation's second-ranked
baseball team, Stanicek and Verducci have
become quite famous for their communica
tion during double-plays. So famous, in fact,
that the teammates share in Marquess' lavish
praise.
"They're an integral part of the team,"
Marquess says, "They may be the best combi
nation in college baseball in the country."
Not surprisingly, Stanicek and Verducci
have just as much pride in the coaching staff.
"One important thing we have gotten out
of Stanford is the coaching," Verducci says,
"They've done a lot of teaching and deserve a
lot of credit for our success."
Stanicek appears to be in complete agree
ment: "We play teams equal to us, but we

have our attitude. Marquess makes us feel
that we should expect to win."
The Pac-10 Southern Division champion
ship is one achievement both men appear to
have expected.
" It's a result of a lot of hard work we've put
in," Verducci says. "Another day at the of
fice."
"We've been able to keep our poise. We
haven't gotten too excited or too down, and
we've been able to come back in late innings,"
Stanicek says. And with a wry smile and a flip
of his blond hair, he adds, "I think our team
is solid."
"Solid" may be an understatement for a
team with a 43-12 record and a top-seeded
berth in the West 1 Regional this weekend at
Sunken Diamond.
Verducci said he feels that this is the best
chance in Stanford's history for a baseball
team to "win it all." Stanicek echoes this
opinion: "It's a boost to get the regionals
here. Big games are more comfortable when
you can sleep in your own bed."
These two All-America candidates may
have a big role in determining whether Stan
ford wins it all this weekend.
Stanicek enters this tournament with a .353
batting average and the Stanford career
record for runs scored with 214. This season
he is first on the team with 52 walks in 55
games, and first in stolen bases with 27 in 3b
attempts.
Hitting .296, Verducci leads the team with
nine sacrifice flies and has 53 RBIs to his
credit — fourth best on the team — although
he bats ninth.
Verducci states that one of the most
memorable team accomplishments was the

1983 trip to the College World Series after hosting the
regionals, and obviously both Stanicek and Verducci are
hoping for a repeat performance.
"It was nice for us to come through," Verducci says.
But these two players have quite a few memories to
look back on in their careers at Stanford. Stanicek recalls
a play earlier in the season against Arizona where Ver
ducci flipped the ball to Stanicek who caught and threw it
bare-handed to first base for a double-play.
"It's most satisfying when it's over and it's a great play
and you've accomplished something," Stanicek says. "But
you also remember the screwed-up plays when John falls
over his feet or the ball goes between my legs."
An economics major and recipient of Stanford's top
junior scholar-athlete award last year, Stanicek claims
that his plans for the immediate future are professional
baseball. Last season, he turned down an offer from the
Baltimore Orioles, who drafted him in the 13th round.
"I'm hoping to get drafted higher this year. Last year, I
wasn't going to get compensated for missing my senior
year," he says,"Baseball is most important to me but I'm
not so blind as to ignore school."
A fan would never suspect that Verducci was a third
round draft pick of the Minnesota Twins after hearing him
talk about baseball.
"I've always loved basketball more," he says, "Baseball
is such a boring sport. I lose interest watching it on TV."
But playing is a different matter for Verducci, who
claims he came very close to signing last year.
"The contract didn't allow me to finish school even part
time, and I really wanted to finish on time with my class,"
he says.
A major in product design, Verducci also plans to give
professional baseball "a shot," and hopes to keep busy in
the off-season with jobs in sports design.
Will the two members of Stanford's classic double-play
combination miss each other after graduation?
Stanicek appears to feel that way: "Professional ball is
more individualized. You have to be self-motivated. Now
John and I are playing together and pulling for each
other."
Stanicek and Verducci may feel the loss of the other
half of their middle-infield combination, but they won't be
the only ones.
"They're both seniors," Marquess says,"The team has
had them for three years and we don't appreciate them.
We may miss them next year."

most in common, though, is the respect they
have for each other off the field as well as on.
That respect and friendship is obvious to
anyone who has seen the two players to
gether. Laughing and smiling, poking fun and
fists at each other, Stanicek and Verducci
seem like two little boys.
"I could pat Pete on the back all day," Ver
ducci says with a mischievious look in his eye.
"But I won't."
Stanicek retaliates when asked to elaborate
on influences Verducci has had on his playing.
Glancing at his teammate, Stanicek shrugs
and calmly replies, "None."
This good-natured bantering is as charac
teristic of Stanicek and Verducci as their ex
cellent defensive skills and hitting ability.
Yet it is easy to tell how much these two
teammates genuinely care about each other.
After a comment about how sick he is of
playing with Verducci for four years, Stanicek
flashes a smile by way of apology, and
proceeds to heap compliments on his
teammate.
"No doubt he's one of the best shortstops,
as well as a clutch hitter. He's the anchor of
the team." Stanicek says.
Verducci, beneath the teasing, also has his
share of pride in Stanicek.
"There's probably no one that doesn't like

him," Verducci says, "He's got a good per
spective, and he's going to go places."
The duo also had a lot to say about the ef
fects each has on the other's playing. Verducci
said he feels feels much of their success is a
result of their friendship on the field.
"We're pulling for each other. We pick
each other up during a game," Verducci says.
"He makes it easier for me to play my posi
tion."
"We get competitive with guys on the team
as much as the opposition," Stanicek says.
"We always push each other and try to be bet
ter than the other. We're competitive with
each other, but it's helpful."
Stanicek explains that the second baseman
and shortstop traditionally have to communi
cate a great deal on the field. As Coach Mark
Marquess says, "All the action happens down
the middle."
The long-standing relationship between
Stanicek and Verducci has enabled them to
master this aspect of playing, and they both
know what to expect from each other now.
As members of the nation's second-ranked
baseball team, Stanicek and Verducci have
become quite famous for their communica
tion during double-plays. So famous, in fact,
that the teammates share in Marquess' lavish
praise.
"They're an integral part of the team,"
Marquess says, "They may be the best combi
nation in college baseball in the country."
Not surprisingly, Stanicek and Verducci
have just as much pride in the coaching staff.
"One important thing we have gotten out
of Stanford is the coaching," Verducci says,
"They've done a lot of teaching and deserve a
lot of credit for our success."
Stanicek appears to be in complete agree
ment: "We play teams equal to us, but we

have our attitude. Marquess makes us feel
that we should expect to win."
The Pac-10 Southern Division champion
ship is one achievement both men appear to
have expected.
" It's a result of a lot of hard work we've put
in," Verducci says. "Another day at the of
fice."
"We've been able to keep our poise. We
haven't gotten too excited or too down, and
we've been able to come back in late innings,"
Stanicek says. And with a wry smile and a flip
of his blond hair, he adds, "I think our team
is solid."
"Solid" may be an understatement for a
team with a 43-12 record and a top-seeded
berth in the West 1 Regional this weekend at
Sunken Diamond.
Verducci said he feels that this is the best
chance in Stanford's history for a baseball
team to "win it all." Stanicek echoes this
opinion: "It's a boost to get the regionals
here. Big games are more comfortable when
you can sleep in your own bed."
These two All-America candidates may
have a big role in determining whether Stan
ford wins it all this weekend.
Stanicek enters this tournament with a .353
batting average and the Stanford career
record for runs scored with 214. This season
he is first on the team with 52 walks in 55
games, and first in stolen bases with 27 in 3b
attempts.
Hitting .296, Verducci leads the team with
nine sacrifice flies and has 53 RBIs to his
credit — fourth best on the team — although
he bats ninth.
Verducci states that one of the most
memorable team accomplishments was the

"I could pat Pete on the hack all day," John Verducci (10) said of Stanicek (7), his
double play partner. "But I won't."
1983 trip to the College World Series after hosting the
regionals, and obviously both Stanicek and Verducci are
hoping for a repeat performance.
"It was nice for us to come through," Verducci says.
But these two players have quite a few memories to
look back on in their careers at Stanford. Stanicek recalls
a play earlier in the season against Arizona where Ver
ducci flipped the ball to Stanicek who caught and threw it
bare-handed to first base for a double-play.
"It's most satisfying when it's over and it's a great play
and you've accomplished something," Stanicek says. "But
you also remember the screwed-up plays when John falls
over his feet or the ball goes between my legs."
An economics major and recipient of Stanford's top
junior scholar-athlete award last year, Stanicek claims
that his plans for the immediate future are professional
baseball. Last season, he turned down an offer from the
Baltimore Orioles, who drafted him in the 13th round.
"I'm hoping to get drafted higher this year. Last year, I
wasn't going to get compensated for missing my senior
year," he says,"Baseball is most important to me but I'm
not so blind as to ignore school."
A fan would never suspect that Verducci was a third
round draft pick of the Minnesota Twins after hearing him
talk about baseball.
"I've always loved basketball more," he says, "Baseball
is such a boring sport. I lose interest watching it on TV."
But playing is a different matter for Verducci, who
claims he came very close to signing last year.
"The contract didn't allow me to finish school even part
time, and I really wanted to finish on time with my class,"
he says.
A major in product design, Verducci also plans to give
professional baseball "a shot," and hopes to keep busy in
the off-season with jobs in sports design.
Will the two members of Stanford's classic double-play
combination miss each other after graduation?
Stanicek appears to feel that way: "Professional ball is
more individualized. You have to be self-motivated. Now
John and I are playing together and pulling for each
other."
Stanicek and Verducci may feel the loss of the other
half of their middle-infield combination, but they won't be
the only ones.
"They're both seniors," Marquess says,"The team has
had them for three years and we don't appreciate them.
We may miss them next year."
They were the only two baseball players to
start all 65 games for Stanford last year. They
are both All-Pacific 10 Conference first team
selections this season, and they both hit their
fourth home runs of the season last Friday
against California.
