# Card men lead NCAA golf
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff sportswriter 
Just when it looked as though the
Stanford men's golf team was ready
to be embarrassed at this week's
NCAA ehampionships in Grenelefe,
Ha., the Cardinal men played their
best golf in more than a month yes
terday to grab a share of the lead
after the first round.
Stanford's season has resembled a
roller coaster ride with the last month
being the lowest of the season's lows.
However, the Cardinal men showed
->igns ot another resurgence yes
terday, tiring an even-par 288 to tie
defending champion Houston for the
first-round lead.
Hven Cardinal Coach Tim Schaaf
was not expecting yesterday's results.
You have to be surprised with being
in first place after today's round,"
Schaaf said. "We've been playing so
erratically lately that I wasn't sure
which team would show up for the
NCAAs â€” the team that played so
well in the fall or the team that's been
erratic lately."
Despite being somewhat surprised
with the team's current standing.
Schaaf knew all along that his golfers
were capable of posting low scores. "I
really wasn't sure what to expect." he
viid. "But vse prepared well and I'm
not at all surprised at how some of
uir players played today. We have
ih.it kind of talent."
The Cardinal's talent came out in
lull strength yesterday with juniors
Hon Walsworth and Carl Wagner
eading the way. Walsworth fired a

two-under-par 70 to edge into a tie
for fourth place. Wagner is one shot
behind Walsworth at 71, tied for 11 th
place.
Schaaf praised the play of
Walsworth and Wagner. "The key
today was that our fourth
(Walsworth) and fifth (Wagner)
players shot our two lowest rounds,"
Schaaf said. "If you have that kind of
production out of your fourth and
fifth players, it puts you in a good po
sition."
The scores of the other Cardinal
golfers were not too shabby, either.
Senior Scott Erickson fired an even
par 72, senior Tim Robinson shot 75
and senior Doug Thompson came in
at 76.
Besides the fact that the Cardinal is
in a tie for first place, the only other
major surprise of the tournament so
far has been that second-ranked
UCLA is way back in a tie for 15th
place, 12 shots behind the leaders.
USC's Sam Randolph leads the in
dividual competition after one round.
Randolph, an All-American and the
runner-up in the U.S. Amateur last
summer, fired a 68 to take the lead.
Mississippi's Glen Day and Eastern
Michigan's Bob McNiff are one shot
behind Randolph at 69.
A handful of golfers are tied with
Walsworth for fourth place, including
Oklahoma State's Scott Verplank,
the current U.S. Amateur champion.
Wagner is in a seven-way tie tor
11th/
Play continues through Saturday in
the 72-hole tournament.
