## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff sportswriter 
There were few surprises in yester
day's first round of the women's
NCAA golf championships as No. 1-
ranked Florida charged to the top of
the leaderhoard, led by the play of
Deb Richard, the nation's top woman
collegian.
The Cardinal women are in ninth
place, a distant 19 shots back of
Florida. The tournament continues
today with the second round at the
New Seabury Blue Course in Cape
Cod, Mass.
Florida, whose 292.4-strokc
average per round this season was six
lower than its nearest competitor,
thoroughly outmatched the rest of the
field, firing 301 for the first round.
The Gators have an eight-shot lead
over second-place Arizona State.
Following ASU are Brigham
Young (312). defending champion
Miami (313), Tulsa (314), Furman
(317). Georgia (3IS), New Mexico
(319) and Stanford (320).
With the exception of Florida, the
tricky course got the best of the
teams, with the result being inflated
scores across the board.
"The scores were insanely high,"
Cardinal freshman Irish McGonigle
said. "The wind is so brutal (on the
front nine) and the back side is really
tricky."
"It's a really difficult course,"
McGonigle said. "You have to make

shots."
The Cardinal's Anna Gxenstierna
leads a group of four golfers tied for
fifth place at 75. Oxenstierna, who
struggled through much of the early
part of the season, has recently been
playing up to her form of a year ago
when she was considered the No. 1
junior player in Europe.
I he scores of the other Cardinal
women reflected the merciless atti
tude of the course. Junior Kathy
Kostas finished in 37th place at SO,
followed by sophomore Kathleen
McCarthy at H2 and freshmen Kay
Cornelius and McGonigle at 83.
Despite a difficult first round, the
Cardinal women remain in good
spirits and are excited about the rest
of the tournament.
" Hie first-day jitters are all out,"
McGonigle said. "We are going to do
much better."
"I feel real confident that we're
going to move up." Kostas said.
"There's no doubt about it. We have
such a strong team from one to five."
McGonigle indicated that the
Cardinal is a good come-from-behind
team. "It's nice to be sitting where we
can drive forward," she said. "I think
that we all think that we can play bet
ter."
Florida s Richard opened up a two
shot margin in the individual compe
tition as she fired a two-under-par 71.
BYU's Terry Norman is in second
place at 73.
