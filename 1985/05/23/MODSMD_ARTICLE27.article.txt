## Card gears up for individuals 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
Fortunately for the Stanford men's
tennis team, there is life after the
NCAA team championship. Stanford
was eliminated by the eventual cham
pion, Georgia, in the quarterfinals of
the national tournament Sunday, but
today marks a new beginning — the
players hope — with the start of the
NCAA individuals.
Five Cardinal players are still in
Athens, Ga., to compete, including
Dan Goldie, Jim Grabb, Derrick
Rostagno, John Letts and Eric
Rosenfeld. "Redemption" for the
match losses against Georgia is on the
mind of some Stanford players, but
others want to "start from scratch"
putting aside the worst finish a Car
dinal team has had in the national
tournament — ever.
Coach Dick Gould just hopes his
players play like they can — and have
been all season long.
"I thought we were ready to play
Georgia. 1 wouldn't have changed
anything in preparation for the
match," Gould said. "Despite the
finish, 1 think we're playing good ten
nis."
Gould also refuses to call Georgia's
national title a fluke.
"I'm sorry for the program and the
players that we couldn't have done
better this year, but you have to look
at Georgia. They have five seniors
playing, all very experienced players
playing on their home court," Gould
said. "Upset? I didn't see one
anywhere in the tournament."
But according to Gould, you can
expect to see some upsets in the indi
viduals. Players that competed in the
semifinals and final matches will be
"mentally tired," Gould said, need
less to mention the number of
matches — conceivably 16 in eight
days — that the top players on Geor
gia's and UCLA's teams will have
played before both tournaments end.
Stanford players should be rested
up, however, for today's first-round
competiton. In singles, Goldie plays
39th-ranked Brian Shelton of Geor

gia Tech, Grabb will meet New
Mexico's Steve Otero and Rostagno
has drawn Paul Varga of Kentucky.
Stanford has one doubles team en
tered in the tournament — Grabb
and Letts, who are seeded eighth.
Goldie and Rosenfeld, the Pacific
10 Conference's doubles champions,
were knocked out in the preliminary
round match yesterday. Birgil Chris
tian and Lee Sponaugle of Penn State
defeated Stanford's No. 3 team, 6-1,
6-4.
Stanford's hopes in doubles are
now left solely to Grabb and Letts.
Letts said a few victories in the
doubles matches would help make up
for the "disappointing" team
outcome.
Letts is now an Athens celebrity
due to a rare appearance at Athen's
T.K. Harty's on amateur night. Stan
ford's No. 5 singles player gave the
Bulldog crowd an original rendition
of "Leroy Brown" with the word
"Bulldog" inserted at key places in
the lyrics.
Despite the crowd's pleasure, Letts
didn't win the $50 prize. He is more
interested, however, in the "big"
prize — a national doubles title.
"I still think we can beat any team
if we play like we can," Letts said.
Grabb, seeded third behind Goldie
and Georgia's Mikael Pernfors, said
he does not feel the need to redeem
himself in the individual tournament.
"I gave a hundred percent in every
match. It's not as if I didn't try. I will
say I didn't play great, but I still put in
a full effort during the team
matches," Grabb said. "I didn't serve
too well, I didn't volley too well, but
other than that, I played all right."
No one knows better than Grabb
that the key to his game is his serve
and volley. He also knows that every
thing has to be going right to win the
tournament.
"To win this, you have to be
playing well all the time. It's brutal.
Last year, Pernfors (the 1984 singles
champion) had to play something like
19 matches in eight days. Not many
people can do that," Grabb said.
