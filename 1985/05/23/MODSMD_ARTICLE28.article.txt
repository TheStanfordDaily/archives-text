### 
NEW YORK (AP) — The Na
tional Invitation Tournament, for
48 years a fixture in the
postseason but recently operating
in the shadow of the expanded
NCAA playoffs, announced plans
yesterday for a 16-team preseason
event.
The tournament, to be called
the Big Apple NIT, will be held
from Nov. 21 to Dec. 1, said Peter
Carlesimo, executive director of
the NIT. He said the field should
be announced in two weeks.
The NIT started in 1938 with six
teams, expanded to eight in 1941,

12 in 1949, 14 in 1965 and 16 in
1968. Until 1978, all games were
played in New York.
As the NCAA expanded its
field, ultimately reaching 64 in
1985, the NIT also expanded and
moved preliminary games to sites
around the country in an effort to
build interest and become more
national in scope. Since 1980, the
NIT has had 32 teams.
In the preseason Big Apple
tournament, opening-round
games will be played at four
regional sites, with the semifinals
and finals in New York.
