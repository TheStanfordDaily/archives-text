### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
In Stanford-in-Government's
20th year of organizing summer
internships in Washington, D.C.,
about 100 Stanford students are
planning to travel to the nation's
capital next month to assist con
gressmen. various government
agencies and lobby groups.
"Most people will be working
on [Capitol] Hill." according to
Scott Reisch. former director of
SIG. "Working for a congressman
is the easiest job to get. but a few
people will be working at agencies
and non-profit lobby groups."
Last summer, SIG interns
worked for more than 50 con
gressmen and more than 50 other
government organizations, and
"there's no reason to believe it's
going to be less than that" this
summer, Reisch said.
11l is summer's program begins
with a June 23 picnic with students
from Harvard, Princeton and the
Llniversitv of Pennsylvania, and
runs through Aug. 10. when most
of the internships will end. accord
ing to Reisch.
SIG assists Stanford students in
securing internships in Washing
ton by compiling information
about openings in government or
ganizations and lobbying for their
acceptance if students were unable
to travel to the East Coast for in
terviews. The organization tries to
help Stanford students make up
for the extra travel they face
compared to students at Ivy
I eaguc and other eastern colleges.
SlG's summer program includes

several speakers, tours of points of
interest in the city and regular so
cial events with interns from other
schools.
According to Reisch, among the
speakers invited for this summer's
activities in Washington are Sen.
William Proxmire (D-Wisc.), Jody
Powell, press secretary during the
Carter administration. Sen. Ed
ward Kennedy (D-Mass.), and
Sandra Day O'Connor and
William Rehnquist. Supreme
Court justices who graduated from
Stanford.
This summer's program will also
include tours of such Washington
landmarks as the White House,
the Capitol building, the Pentagon
and the Supreme Court, Reisch
said.
"To make sure they have a good
time." SIG also plans extensive
social functions. Reisch said.
As in past summers, interns will
hold weekly Softball games with
UC-Berkeley interns, weekly
happy hours, a boat dance anil
several parties, according to Liz
Egan, one of the two coordinators
for this summer's activities.
She added that interns will also
attend two filmings of " Meet the
Press." an activity that was espe
cially popular last year.
Thirty of the interns will live in
Georgetown University dormitor
ies which UCI.A rents and. in
turn, rents to interns from Stan
ford and other California schools.
Others will live with Washington
area alumni and at George Wash
ington University and American
University, according to Reisch.
