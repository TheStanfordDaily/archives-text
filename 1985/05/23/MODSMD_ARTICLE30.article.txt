New Order —Low-life ★ ★ , /i
Gloom, gloom, gloom. A number
of bands since progressive rock's
rise in the late 1970s have devoted
their music to telling all of us how
much life sucks. There's even a
three-word term for the stuff:
doom glamour rock. Most of it is
unfocused bummedness blended
with muddy, depressing instrumen
tation. And pretty much all of it has
remained in obscurity. The most
notable exceptions are The Cure,
which had to become a trendy new
wave dance band first, and New
Order, which has since thoroughly
changed its sound, style and name.

men and take away their songbook.
Then make them sing. What do
they sound like? They sound like
every other one-hit garage band
around. The Waves' single,
"Walking on Sunshine," is
definitely upbeat enough, enjoy
able enough and overplayed
enough to satisfy the masses. But
the rest of the album Ls contrived,
trite and only amusing if you didn't

However, "Low-life" has the exact

the weaker songs on "Lies." Noth

Burton has introduced Pat Me

world, and played with many greats
including Keith Jarrett, Stephanie
Grapelli and Roy Haynes. Here, he
introduces pianist Makoto Ozone
(whose own 1984 album Burton
produced) and continues his long
relationship with the vastly un
derrated Steve Swallow, bass player
and composer extraordinaire. The
compositions, from Carla Bley,
John Scofield, Duke Ellington,
Swallow and Ozone, provide a wide
range of possibilities for the quar

be much more fun to listen to at the
moment. The best example of this
is a cover of "Going Down to
Liverpool" that makes the Bangles'
version seem like an undiscovered
classic. Granted, we like
"Sunshine" almost as much as we
did when we first heard it long, long
ago; when placed alongside the rest
of the album, though, it loses most
of its charm. If you want to do the
band a favor, don't buy the album,

Hyman's drumming shimmers, fill

skill, are explosive in a powerhouse

"Syndrome." This album is won
