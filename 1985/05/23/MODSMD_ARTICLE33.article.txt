## Skywood Restaurant: fine dining experience 
### 
The Skywood Restaurant
Skyline Boulevard and La Honda
Road
Woodside
851-7444
Probably the best adjective to use
in describing the Skywood restaurant
in Woodside is "high." It is a high-

priced, high-class sort of place that is
nestled high in the beautiful, forested
Skyline hills. And it should be high on
your list if it is only delicious gourmet
food that you seek.
The key to an enjoyable experience
at the Skywood is to know what to ex
pect before you enter. For a rookie
restaurant critic who felt slightly ner
vous about dining at the considerable
expense of someone else, here is the
way that the Skywood shaped up.
The gorgeous evergreen-studded

hills of the Skyline area offer a spec
tacular feast for the eyes as one enters
the Skywood. The view is also a per
fect complement to the restaurant's
woody interior and rustic, yet elegant,
atmosphere.
The Skywood has a slightly stuffy
quality about it. The tables — beauti
fully arrayed with fine wine glasses,
tablecloth and spotless cutlery —
don't exactly induce you to prop your
elbows upon them or slouch in your
chair.
If you plan on going there for a
weekend dinner, make a reservation
and do not be late. My guest and I
were 15 minutes late for our 8 p.m.
reservations, and we waited nearly 45
minutes more for a table as a result.
The wait was only slightly alleviated
by the comfortably happy tunes of a
pianist in the cocktail lounge.
The restaurant's mesquite broiler
in the kitchen deserves mention. It
produces a smokey atmosphere and a
strong hickory smell which at first is
pleasant, but after a while it can easily
produce a slightly queasy feeling. On
the whole, I felt it detracted from the
meal.
You won't forget that hickory
aroma when you leave either. It will,
in fact, go with you. The smoke clings
tightly to your clothes and hair, so
that when you take a shower the next
morning you'll smell it being washed
away.
Once at our table, we were greeted
by an edible bouquet of one of the
Skywood's special treats — extremely
long breadsticks. (I had asked for the
breadsticks in the cocktail lounge, but
I never recieved them, although some
of my luckier neighbors had.)

These breadsticks, which come
with a serving of sweet whipped but
ter, were nearly two feet long, and
they loom up before you from their
glass vase in the middle of the table.
These tasty treats provide a quick
answer to those pre-dinner hunger
pangs one always gets at a restaurant,
but you should watch out. Like those
infernal tortilla chips at most good
Mexican restaurants, there is a ten
dency to forage on the breadsticks
before you even get to the meal.
The Skywood Restaurant's dinner
menu is high priced for anyone's wal
let, especially a student's. Entrees
ranged in price from the chicken
D'Avlo at $10.50 all the way up to
the milk-fed veal Porterhouse for
$16.95.
These prices don't include an ap
petizer or dessert, and, of course,
they don't include the $10 to $15 bot
tle of wine you always feel compelled
to order at any gourmet restaurant.
The Skywood's appetizer list in
cluded a wide choice of salads, pastas
and soup, as well as such delights as
warm squab salad with wilted spinach
($7), smoked reindeer and butter
salad ($6.50) and baked cashew goat
cheese ($5.25). Unless you order
simple garlic bread ($1.75), you
should expect to pay between $5 and
$7, just for an appetizer.
For an appetizer, my friend chose
the baked Camembert in Filo, which
is sauteed apples and pear sauce,
while 1 chose the tortellini stuffed
with chard, ricotta, pancetta, butter
and sage sauce. Simply put, both were
delicious, and they were served fairly
quickly.
My pasta was especially good. It

had just enough butter to keep it
from being dry, but it was not
saturated. The three ravioli-shaped
pastas were large enough to make an
effective appetizer, too. Like all the
Skywood's pastas appetizers, this dish
is also offered as an entree.
The Skywood offers a regular
entree menu of mesquite-broiled
specialties and pastas. In addition to
the traditional New York steak, there
are some not-so-traditional things
like fresh rabbit, lamb tenderloin
Cassis, veal scallopini and beet fet
tucine with Porcini mushrooms. All
come with fresh vegetables.

I didn't know
what to expect
from the
asparagus cream
sauce.

There is also a daily selection of
fresh fish entrees, and because my
guest and I both had an inclination
toward seafood, we chose from the
special daily menu which accom
panies the regular menu.
My selection, Canadian halibut
with asparagus cream sauce and black
truffles, was light, flaky and delicious,
while my guest's swordfish with Pom
niery mustard sauce was firm, well
seasoned and all-together good. Both
orders came with fresh snow peas and
whipped yams, which were simply
fantastic.

I wasn't sure what to expect from a
asparagus cream sauce, but I was
pleasantly surprised. It had a slightly
spicy taste that gave it a little zip, but
it didn't overpower the fish. It was
not poured on top of the fish either,
but rather next to it, so you could
partake of it according to your own
taste.
We also selected a bottle of Cal
laway Vineyard's Fume Blanc to ac
company our meal. I am partial to
Callaway wines, and I knew this to be
a good one from experience. But it
would be nearly impossible to choose
a bad wine at a fine restaurant like the
Skywood. We chose from a wide ar
ray of whites, reds and roses.
I like this wine chilled, and that's
the way it was served, but we were
not given the luxury of an ice bucket
to keep it cold, so it was warm by the
end of our meal.
There can be little to complain
about when it comes to the
Skywood's cooking. In fact, I would
give the chef rave reviews. If it's just
delectable gourmet food that you are
seeking, then the Skywood is your
place. If you are expecting a lot of
other niceties, like great service, the
story is not the same.
Our waitress was friendly enough
during the meal, but she seemed to be
lacking in the some of the finer points
in courtesy and restaurant etiquette.
And finally, one comes to the
Skywood's desserts. And to this there
is only one thing to say — it is simply
a given.
All the Skywood's desserts are
homemade and the selection varies
dailv.

The waitress brought to our a table
a tray filled with a mouth-watering
array which ranged from a fresh kiwi
papava pie to a rich white chocolate
mousse pie to a creamy strawberry
custard.
1 defy anyone to have the will
power to say no to one of these
desserts after they are presented
before you, and if you do, you are
missing a real treat.
My guest's chocolate strawberry
cheesecake with just a touch of
amaretto was simply out of this
world, as was my fluffy white choco
late mousse pie.
With a cup or two of the Skywood's
rich, dark coffee, these desserts were
the pcrfect ending to any meal.
The bill came to $67.83 for the two
of us. That's hardly cheap, but it is
not outlandish either. If everything
about the Skywood had been as high
quality as the food, then the price tag
could be easily justified.
The service was a little less than
good, and a lot less than the sort of
classiness one would expect at a place
like the Skywood. The atmosphere
was fine, if you don't mind a little bit
of stuffiness that can be attributed to
more than just the mesquite-burning
grill.
The Skywood may be just the place
you are looking for for that special
occasion. Perhaps, when you have
your next formal, you might want to
take your date here. But, then again,
you may be the only ones smelling
like hickory at the dance.
