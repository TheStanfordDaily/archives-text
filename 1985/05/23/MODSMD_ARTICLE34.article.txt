## THE 						SIXTH GAME BASEBALL ABSTRACT 
### 
jjl

If the value of a sport is reflected in
the writing it inspires, baseball — the
muse of writers as good as Bernard
Malamud and Roger Angell and
Wilfrid Sheed — is more than just the
national pastime; it's the state reli
gion. No other sport's literature ap
proaches baseball's in quantity and
quality, and no other sport inspires
the same fervor in its writers. There is
always a sense in baseball books that
small matters — love, money, nuclear
war, football — will work themselves
out between innings.
But even baseball isn't immune to
the general national malaise of the
1980s. As headlines about drugs and
salaries take over the sports pages,
even the most ardent writer/fan will
find doubts creeping in at the edges of
his prose. This reflex negativity flares
up, much like a nagging injury, in
most recent books about baseball.
Baseball makes up a larger world
than other sports, and writing about it
comes from more perspectives. The
view from the field can be seen in
"Balls," recently reissued in paper
back (Pocket Books, 293 pp., $3.95).
Graig Nettles' book (co-written with
Peter Golenbock) intercuts a
chronicle of his entire baseball career
with a month-by-month account of
the 1983 season, when the Billy
Martin-managed Yankees stayed
close through August but disin

tegrated in the last month. When
"Balls" was published in 1984, it
created a tremendous stir, and was
even said to have caused Nettles'
trade to the San Diego Padres.
Reading it now, after Nettles has
played in a World Series for the
Padres and Yankees owner George
Steinbrenner has hired Martin for the
fourth time, the book seems fairly
restrained. Nettles is always honest,
and one has to wonder how other
players reacted to his (occasional)
criticisms (anyone who thinks Roy
Smalley can play shortstop in the
major leagues should read this book);
but he doesn't really say anything that
bad about Steinbrenner, other than
that he's fat, comes from Cleveland
and won't let well enough alone.
The last sentence of the book is,
"All we need from George is a fight
ing chance." They didn't get it;
Nettles, who is, along with Mike
Schmidt, one of the two best third
basemen of our era, was traded
shortly after the book came out; since
then Steinbrenner has sent the
Yankees' best pitching prospects to
Oakland for Rickey Henderson, and
now the Yankees are in fourth place.
"Balls" is in the form of a diary, and
Nettles doesn't often bother to step
back and pronounce on Steinbrenner
and the Yankees in general. It's ob
vious that for him, the day-to-day

questions of baseball — whether
Goose Gossage has lost anything off
his fastball, whether Dave Winfield
really meant to hit the bird — are
more important than the year-to-year
ones — whether Steinbrenner is
ruining the team, whether free agency
will ruin baseball.
Peter Gammons addresses the big
questions, but his heart really isn't in
it. Gammons, who covers baseball for
the Boston Globe and The Sporting
News and is generally considered one
of the country's top baseball writers,
has written a book about his
hometown team, the Boston Red
Sox. "Beyond the Sixth Game: What's
Happened to Baseball since the
Greatest Game in World Series His
tory" (Houghton Mifflin, 283 pp.,
$15.95) covers the Red Sox from the
optimism of the early 19705, which
culminated in their seven-game loss
to Cincinnati in the 1975 World Se
ries; through the frustrations of the
late '70s, which found their perfect
expression in the Sox' loss to the
Yankess in a one-game divisional
playoff at the end of the 1978 season;
and on through the '80s, when pitch
ing woes have consistently kept the
Red Sox in the middle of their divi
sion. But in chronicling the Red Sox,
Gammons is forced to consider the
role of money, and all its attendant
evils, in baseball: The Sul-

livan/Leroux battles for ownership of
the team, and the disastrous effects of
free agency on the Red Sox' talent
pool, push aside Gammons' accounts
of what actually happened on the
field.
By far the best moments in the
book are the depictions of great mo
ments in Bosox history; Carlton
Fisk's home run in the sixth game of
the 1975 series, which opens the
book, and Carl Yastrzemski's pop-up
to end the 1978 playoff game. These
are lovingly written, and reach the
perfect pitch of sentimentality re
quired of baseball anecdotes (sports
writing being one of the few forms in
which sentiment has a purpose).
Much of the rest of the book,
however, is sloppy — confusing,
badly written and edited, and
seemingly cobbled together from
newspaper stories. These, of course,
are the sections dealing with the
down side of the Red Sox and
baseball in general: ownership
squabbles, contract fights and un
happy players. Gammons' attitude
toward this material seems to be a
combination of anger and distaste, as
if he can't believe that people would
be silly enough to inflict such indig
nities upon the game. He doesn't
reach any conclusions about
baseball's future, and it's obvious he
would have been much happier just

talking about the players and the
game, rather than slipping his stories
about Luis Tiant and Bill Lee and
Fred Lynn in between his long ac
counts of the antics of Haywood Sul
livan and Buddy Leroux.
Following the player's and the
reporter's viewpoints, we get the
fan's. Make that the superfan's. Bill
James has been publishing his
"Baseball Abstracts" since the late
'70s, and for his faithful readers (of
which 1 am one), "The Bill James
Baseball Abstract 1985" (Ballantine
Books, 308 pp., $7.95, paperback) is
more like an old friend than a book
full of arcane and, to the man in the
street, meaningless baseball statistics.
Interesting as they are, though, "runs
created" and "defensive winning
percentage" and "approximate
value" aren't the point; comments
like the following are: "Obviously,
the best player in baseball at this
point" (said about Cal Ripken); "It's
absolutely incredible that a player
this bad could be given 3,000 at bats
in the major leagues" (said about
Duane Kuiper). James says the same
things all true fans say at the ballpark,
but he backs them up with statistics
and gets them published. Perhaps the
definitive James statement was his
summation of Montreal Expos
shortstop Doug Flynn's 1982 season:
"One of the 10 nicest people in

baseball, according to everybody. 1
know who has dealt with him." •*>
The 1985 "Abstract" maintains|a(l
of James annoying habits, including
his propensity to go off on tangents;'il
he doesn't feel like discussing (hp
1984 Toronto Blue Jays in detail,-foe
talks about how likely various Bloc
Jays were to swing at the first pitch
instead. But the book is so packed
with information, and pithy opinions,
that one can't complain. James
spawned a mini-industry in the
years, as other statistics freaks have
put out their own books (Peter Pal
mer and Daniel Okrent are amoi)g
the good ones) and James himself has
been hired by both teams and players
as an expert witness for salary ar
bitration hearings (there's money
again). But as long as James keeps
expressing himself as bluntly as he
does here, he won't have any r£al
competition. «*
James approach to the game's ex<-
ternal problems is refreshing — "he
treats them simply as additional fac
tors impinging on his players' statis
tics, on a par with defensive range
and ability to hit the high fastball. His
attitude seems to be that the game!is
greater than the sum of its parts. We
can only hope he's right.
