## Brilliant explorations in the art of invective 
### Captain Maximus" By Barry Hannah Knopf, 101 pp., $11. 95 
Barry Hannah's second collection
) of short stories, "Captain Maximus,"
t is a remarkably belligerent work,
I delightfully so. In fact, in pieces that
* range from memoirs to surreal
• slapsticks, the author successfully
* mocks (almost to the point of
destruction) the genre of the short
• story itself. Better to say, then, that

the genre is Invective, and the mood
disgust; and that the result is a kind of
punchy mix of Nathanael West and
Jimi Hendrix; and that Hannah is a
stunning writer.
By Invective I mean the art of the
verbal attack, the rail. Today's most
protean expression concludes Han
nah's "Getting Ready," the story of
Roger Laird's disintegrating life and
his quest for the big fish. "He sold all
his fishing gear at a terrible loss, and
they moved to Dallas, address un
known. Then Roger Laird made an

old-fashioned two-by-four pair of
stilts eight feet high. It made him
stand about 12 feet in the air. He
would mount the stilts and walk into
the big lake around which the rich
people lived. The sailing boats would
come around near him, big opulent
three-riggers sleeping two families
belowdecks, and Roger Laird would
yell: 'Fuck you! Fuck you!'"
Why is this so refreshing?
"Idaho" is in part a memoir of
recently deceased Richard Hugo, the

famous poet from Montana to whom
Hannah obviously owes some of his
tricks, but it is in his divergences from
Hugo's style, and from the styles of
Hugo's many acolytes, that Hannah's
refreshingness can be located. This is
from a Hugo poem called "Letter to
Sister Madeline from lowa City":
"I'm getting strange when I drink. In
Solon /1 take a booth alone in the
back and play old tunes on the juke
box, trying, I suppose, to feel some
way /1 felt when I was young. But
things keep breaking in. /. . . I wanted
to scream at the women, / leave me
alone. Can't you see, I'm rotten."
Hugo's typical terrain, the West, and
his typical tone, bitterness, resolve
into a self-pity. The world may suck,
but it is his own shortcomings which
concern Hugo.
Hannah, in contrast, seems to
begin with his own damnation, so he
spends little time anatomizing it; he's
not looking for hugs and reassuring
words. He keeps himself afloat by at
tacking a world that is even more rot
ten than he is. As he says near the end
of "Idaho," "I was trying to step
away from that slobbering thug, self
pity. I thought I would try to. Truth
is, the drunk has all the feeling for the
miracle, but not quite the substance
of it... . And then you are greedy for
the miracle. It is too good, this close
ness, and you want to go on over,
across the river and into the trees
with Stonewall Jackson, who refused
liquor because he liked it too much.
At the big battle, he sucked a lemon
all day — suck, suck — while his foot
cavalry hit and hit again."
I remember attending a Richard
Hugo reading, five or six years ago,
when I adored him, and he read a
poem addressed to a professor of
mine, also an alcoholic. It was
moving. "No more bourbon to dissolve
the tension," he said. Together, they
had quit alcohol. The audience
clapped tearfully. But at the reception
after the reading, Hugo had beers in
both hands — gulp, gulp. What irked
me was not his drinking, but the
cheapness and dishonesty of the ef
fect he had been trying to achieve in

his poem. He aimed for the big hur
rah, and delivered — did he even
know it? — boasts that popped like
bubbles.
Hannah, who drives over the same
roads Hugo did, brilliantly avoids
Hugo's cheap exits. Witness, in the
conclusion to a story called "Ride,
Fly, Penetrate, Loiter," this bristling
elegance:
/ have been sober ever since.
I have just told a lie ... .
You may see me with the eye-patch,
though, in almost any city of the
South, the Far West, or the Northwest.
/ am on the black and chrome Tri
umph, riding right into your face.
Indeed, most of "Captain Maxi
mus" is unbridled attack. Vicious
swipes appear almost randomly.
"Ride, Fly, Penetrate, Loiter" begins
with the narrator explaining how a
"fake Indian" poked out one of his
eyes in Mississippi. Then the narrator
visits Alabama, where "everybody
has about exactly enough energy to
jaywalk or cheat a wife or a friend
with a quote from Nietzsche on his
lips," then on to Dallas, "the city of
fur helicopters." These cities appear
only for the length of time it takes
Hannah to trash them. (In the middle
of the Dallas section, the narrator
bites the head off T.S. Eliot: "It was
then I took the leap into the waste
land, happy as Brer Rabbit in the
briars. That long long, bloated
epicene tract 'The Waste Land' by
Eliot — the slide show of some snug
librarian on the rag — was nothing,
unworthy, in the notes that every
sissy throws away. ... You throw it
down like a pickled egg with nine
Buds and move on to giving it to the
preacher's wife on a hill while she
spits on a photograph of her hus
band.")
This very uncozy vituperation,
paradoxically, becomes an escape
from condescension — as if through
hatred a writer more fairly measures
his opposition's power. "What you
cannot correct," he writes, "you can
always insult." Yes: Hannah's stories
can be read as a catalogue of things
he cannot correct; and this admission

of his powerlessness in the face
of what this writer sees to be
America's übiquitous and senseless
malignity is a brave one. And it is one
that frees his imagination. If his
stories abandon the conventions of
narrative unity, characterization, de
velopment and so forth, their texture
nonetheless makes perfect sense. The
cuts, whaps, digs, excesses, cracks and
complaints are unified by tone, and
since Hannah chucks outright any
hope of coming out of this world with
anything more than his own annihila
tion, his tone has a winning sincerity.
Hannah may be a nihilist, but he
doesn't despair. Destruction itself has
a kind of thrilling buoyancy. In "Even
Greenland," two pilots are having a
conversation while their plane is
about to crash. They are trying to
think of something appropriate to say
for last words, something that's not
"bad writing." When one pilot blurts
out the line the other one had in
mind, they nearly "mix it up." In
stead, the pilot whose line was stolen
insists that his friend eject; if he can
not have his own last words, at least
he can imagine the crash as being his
own personal signature. His demise
will also be his "damned triumph."
Love, or more often sexual craving,
sometimes offers itself as a less dras
tic triumph. But here is no transcen
dent love. The best of it is still tran
sient, so much so that the writer can
hardly suspend the memory of love in
his mind. Women enter and exit the
lives of Hannah's (always male) nar
rators inexplicably. "It Spoke Exactly
of the Things" ends like this:
. . . Where the water washes in full
of the rust from old wrecks, the rust
from my sunken shotgun washing
over her tanned feet, I sit, still stunned
by carnivorous passion when the drug
runs out.
I drank enough.
I banged the walls of space and time
long enough. I don't have to lie. I
think of (her) black butterfly (tattoo)
and sometimes I can even remember
her name."

By Invective I mean the art of the
verbal attack, the rail. Today's most
protean expression concludes Han
nah's "Getting Ready," the story of
Roger Laird's disintegrating life and
his quest for the big fish. "He sold all
his fishing gear at a terrible loss, and
they moved to Dallas, address un
known. Then Roger Laird made an

old-fashioned two-by-four pair of
stilts eight feet high. It made him
stand about 12 feet in the air. He
would mount the stilts and walk into
the big lake around which the rich
people lived. The sailing boats would
come around near him, big opulent
three-riggers sleeping two families
belowdecks, and Roger Laird would
yell: 'Fuck you! Fuck you!'"
Why is this so refreshing?
"Idaho" is in part a memoir of
recently deceased Richard Hugo, the

famous poet from Montana to whom
Hannah obviously owes some of his
tricks, but it is in his divergences from
Hugo's style, and from the styles of
Hugo's many acolytes, that Hannah's
refreshingness can be located. This is
from a Hugo poem called "Letter to
Sister Madeline from lowa City":
"I'm getting strange when I drink. In
Solon /1 take a booth alone in the
back and play old tunes on the juke
box, trying, I suppose, to feel some
way /1 felt when I was young. But
things keep breaking in. /. . . I wanted
to scream at the women, / leave me
alone. Can't you see, I'm rotten."
Hugo's typical terrain, the West, and
his typical tone, bitterness, resolve
into a self-pity. The world may suck,
but it is his own shortcomings which
concern Hugo.
Hannah, in contrast, seems to
begin with his own damnation, so he
spends little time anatomizing it; he's
not looking for hugs and reassuring
words. He keeps himself afloat by at
tacking a world that is even more rot
ten than he is. As he says near the end
of "Idaho," "I was trying to step
away from that slobbering thug, self
pity. I thought I would try to. Truth
is, the drunk has all the feeling for the
miracle, but not quite the substance
of it... . And then you are greedy for
the miracle. It is too good, this close
ness, and you want to go on over,
across the river and into the trees
with Stonewall Jackson, who refused
liquor because he liked it too much.
At the big battle, he sucked a lemon
all day — suck, suck — while his foot
cavalry hit and hit again."
I remember attending a Richard
Hugo reading, five or six years ago,
when I adored him, and he read a
poem addressed to a professor of
mine, also an alcoholic. It was
moving. "No more bourbon to dissolve
the tension," he said. Together, they
had quit alcohol. The audience
clapped tearfully. But at the reception
after the reading, Hugo had beers in
both hands — gulp, gulp. What irked
me was not his drinking, but the
cheapness and dishonesty of the ef
fect he had been trying to achieve in

his poem. He aimed for the big hur
rah, and delivered — did he even
know it? — boasts that popped like
bubbles.
Hannah, who drives over the same
roads Hugo did, brilliantly avoids
Hugo's cheap exits. Witness, in the
conclusion to a story called "Ride,
Fly, Penetrate, Loiter," this bristling
elegance:
/ have been sober ever since.
I have just told a lie ... .
You may see me with the eye-patch,
though, in almost any city of the
South, the Far West, or the Northwest.
/ am on the black and chrome Tri
umph, riding right into your face.
Indeed, most of "Captain Maxi
mus" is unbridled attack. Vicious
swipes appear almost randomly.
"Ride, Fly, Penetrate, Loiter" begins
with the narrator explaining how a
"fake Indian" poked out one of his
eyes in Mississippi. Then the narrator
visits Alabama, where "everybody
has about exactly enough energy to
jaywalk or cheat a wife or a friend
with a quote from Nietzsche on his
lips," then on to Dallas, "the city of
fur helicopters." These cities appear
only for the length of time it takes
Hannah to trash them. (In the middle
of the Dallas section, the narrator
bites the head off T.S. Eliot: "It was
then I took the leap into the waste
land, happy as Brer Rabbit in the
briars. That long long, bloated
epicene tract 'The Waste Land' by
Eliot — the slide show of some snug
librarian on the rag — was nothing,
unworthy, in the notes that every
sissy throws away. ... You throw it
down like a pickled egg with nine
Buds and move on to giving it to the
preacher's wife on a hill while she
spits on a photograph of her hus
band.")
This very uncozy vituperation,
paradoxically, becomes an escape
from condescension — as if through
hatred a writer more fairly measures
his opposition's power. "What you
cannot correct," he writes, "you can
always insult." Yes: Hannah's stories
can be read as a catalogue of things
he cannot correct; and this admission

of his powerlessness in the face
of what this writer sees to be
America's übiquitous and senseless
malignity is a brave one. And it is one
that frees his imagination. If his
stories abandon the conventions of
narrative unity, characterization, de
velopment and so forth, their texture
nonetheless makes perfect sense. The
cuts, whaps, digs, excesses, cracks and
complaints are unified by tone, and
since Hannah chucks outright any
hope of coming out of this world with
anything more than his own annihila
tion, his tone has a winning sincerity.
Hannah may be a nihilist, but he
doesn't despair. Destruction itself has
a kind of thrilling buoyancy. In "Even
Greenland," two pilots are having a
conversation while their plane is
about to crash. They are trying to
think of something appropriate to say
for last words, something that's not
"bad writing." When one pilot blurts
out the line the other one had in
mind, they nearly "mix it up." In
stead, the pilot whose line was stolen
insists that his friend eject; if he can
not have his own last words, at least
he can imagine the crash as being his
own personal signature. His demise
will also be his "damned triumph."
Love, or more often sexual craving,
sometimes offers itself as a less dras
tic triumph. But here is no transcen
dent love. The best of it is still tran
sient, so much so that the writer can
hardly suspend the memory of love in
