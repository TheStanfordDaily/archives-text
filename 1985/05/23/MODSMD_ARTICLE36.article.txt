## Feature magazine resurrected 
### 
After a two-year hiatus, the stu
dent magazine Dialtone will re
emerge on campus next week.
Dialtone, an arts and feature
magazine, was published thrice
annually until the spring of 1983,
when most of its staff graduated.
Senior Barry Munger and junior
Leda Boswoth are responsible for the
publication's resurrection.
Munger, a member of the old
Dialtone staff, explains the hiatus this
way: "The magazine was a big thing
to get together, and it just didn't have
the staff." He expects that this issue
will spark interest and attract new
writers and editors. "We hope that
next year the magazine will be issued
once a quarter," he said.
As a general interest magazine,
Dialtone tries to maintain a balance

of fiction, poetry, interviews, feature
articles and artwork. "We were
looking for fiction that had heart and
editorials that had nerve," Munger
says.
The magazine has had a playful his
tory. In a spring 1981 edition of
Dialtone, the editors claimed they
were interested in "anything from
hard-core journalism to pure fiction
. . . a certain quality with a distinct
tone (the Dialtone, perhaps?)." In
the past, Dialtone has published arti
cles on America's political climate,
Domino's Pizza salesmen and the Ex
otic/Erotic Halloween Ball.
This current issue is top-heavy with
interviews. In a section called
"Vietnam Interviews," Vietnam vet
eran and war prisoner Adm. James
Stockdale discusses his experiences in

prison camp, while Stanford draft
resister and author David Harris
sums up the sense back home. In a
group of "Literary Interviews," writ
ers Grace Paley, John Bath and Gal
way Kinnell discuss their own work
and the value of creative writing pro
grams. There are also stories by Jim
Riley and Stanford junior Mike
Hawley, artwork and poetry by Shelly
Jackson, and photographs by Anne
Sconberg.
Dialtone will be printed in a large
newsprint format â€” "good for
showing off student art," Munger
notes.
"The magazine will be big and
free," he says.
And barring any printing disasters,
it will be out by Wednesday.
