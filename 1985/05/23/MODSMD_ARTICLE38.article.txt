dominated the less-skilled high-tech
production occupations— 73 percent
of the assembly jobs were held by
women.
Women computer specialists make
about 72 percent as much money as
their male counterparts. The pay dis
crepancy was changed from 1970 to
1980, even though the number of
computer-specialist jobs doubled and
the number of female specialists
nearly tripled.
The study also found that white
men are usually in higher-status posi
tions than minorities and women in
high-technology industries.
The report concludes: "The higher
the status and pay of the occupation,
the more white men were over
represented compared to their repre
sentation in the labor force as a whole
and the more minority men and
women of all racial and ethnic groups
were underrepresented."
