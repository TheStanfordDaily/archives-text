# Daily elects new party chief

Noveye nachala.
The Western world chose a new
spokesman yesterday as former
Asst. Deputy to the Consul for
U.S.-Moravian Grape Nuts Trade
Troy Hid (sounds like read) surged
to victory in Daily elections to
become editor in chief for Volume
188.
Eid, also the current chairman of
the Committee to Save Lake Baikal
(COSALABAK), said in an im
promptu news conference after his
triumph, "It's so good to see you
all. I really enjoyed the past year.
Was the traffic good?"
The editor-elect said he hopes his
term would improve relations be
tween the editorial and advertising
departments of The Daily.
"Preliminary talks with Biz Side
leaders indicate a willingness to
engage in constructive dialogue,"
he said late last night in a telephone
interview from the Nearby Dacha.
Business leaders expressed
guarded optimism that Eid's elec
tion would bring a "thaw" to at
times icy relations. But a Biz Side
memorandum from an unim
peachable source said better rela
tions are not in store, stemming
from a dispute over covert aid to
the re-election campaign of U.S.
Rep. Tim Wirth (D-Colo.).
Early in the evening, a number of
signals alerted veteran Eid
watchers that major changes were
afoot in the Daily hierarchy. Cars
were seen shuttling to and from
Eid's residence, and lights were
seen burning in both Meyer and
Green libraries.
Radio station KZSU interrupted
its usually eclectic programming to
broadcast four continuous hours of
Ultravox's "I Want to be a Ma
chine."
As word of Eid's election spread
from prison to prison through
inmate contact, banners proclaim
ing "Long live Mr. Steak" mys
teriously began appearing all over
campus, an event which in the past
has signaled new Daily leadership.
Professors in the Political Science
Department who spoke on the con
dition they not be awakened said
Eid's election would have minimal
impact on current arms control
negotiations. Said one, "Our
negotiating position vis a vis the D
-5 warhead may be somewhat com

promised. Speaking normatively
from the perspective of a realist,
the balance of power between the
hegemons should remain un
changed."

At a victory party attended by
leading Western diplomats, Eid
said, "The Daily is standing tall,
forging ahead. Making a name for
itself, if you will."
