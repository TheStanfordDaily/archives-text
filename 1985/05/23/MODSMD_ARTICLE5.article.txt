In a meeting with the Black Student Union yesterday,
University President Donald Kennedy gave his
"preliminary support" for a proposed West Coast anti
apartheid student conference to be held in October at
Stanford, according to BSU Chairman Steven Phillips.
"President Kennedy i 'is agreed to support the concept
of the conference with the -esources of his office," Phillips
said.
"The precedent for such a conference has been laid
with the past' You Can Make a Difference' conference on
hunger and public policy. . . . We feel it only appropriate
that there be a 'You Can Make a Difference' conference
on apartheid," said Phillips, reading from a prepared text
at a press conference following the meeting.
Also at the press conference, Amanda Kemp, secretary
of the BSU, voiced the BSU's opposition to the recent
South Africa investments proposal put forth by four stu
dents, three of whom are members of the Commission on
Investment Responsibility.

"The BSU stresses that the four individuals who drew
up the proposal do not reflect the sentiment of the
thousands of people on campus who still call for total
divestment. . . . The board has had eight years in which to
pressure the South African government to change. The
BSU questions whether giving them two more years to
avoid voting on this issue will benefit the people of South
Africa or answer the community's call for a socially re
sponsible investment policy," Kemp said.
Regarding the conference, Phillips said it would edu
cate the student body at large and help to develop a net
work of students throughout the state.
Phillips added that Stanford would be an ideal location
for the confcrence because of its resources and central po
sition in the Bay Area.
According to Phillips, Kennedy said that he was in favor
of a conference that opposes apartheid "with solutions of
all points of view." Kennedy stressed that there should be
a variety of approaches to the conference, Phillips said.
