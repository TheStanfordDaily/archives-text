# Kennedy splits latest proposal
## New divestment plan on agendas 
### SANDRA BODOVITZ 
University President Donald Ken
nedy agreed yesterday to place the
first of four parts of a student pro
posal for a stronger University invest
ment policy on the agenda of the
Board of Trustees' Committee on In
vestments.
The proposal that will be consid
ered calls for "more effective moni
toring and evaluation of performance
of companies in which Stanford holds
equity."
More specifically, the students re
quest four full-time staff people to
work on evaluating Stanford's hold
ings. The students stress that these
staff people would not work under
the supervision of the Treasurer's Of
fice, and that a student from either
the Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility (C-IR) or a student from
the ASSU Nominations Commission
would contribute to their selection.
"At the agenda planning session,
Donald Kennedy concurred that an
item should go on the Committee on
Investments' agenda which deals with
that part of the student proposal con
cerning resource commitment," said
Rod Adams, University treasurer.
Walter Geys, a member of the
Committee on Investments and a co
author of the proposal, said the rules
for putting an item on the agenda of
the committee are vague.
"I'm a voting member on the Com
mittee on Investments, just like the
trustees, and I want to put the whole
proposal on the agenda. They've
never been confronted with a contro
versial issue. There are no specific
bylaws that explain the rules for put
ting things on the agenda. There's
just the common practice, and that's
in the hands of Donald Kennedy,"
Geys said.
"If I have the right, I'll put the
whole thing on the agenda then the
board can decide whether or not to
discuss it. If students have a contro
versial issue, why should they have to

go through the administration?" he
asked.
Mark Landesmann, a member of
C-IR and one of the co-authors of the
proposal, agreed that the whole pro
posal deserves consideration. "I don't
understand how they can split the
proposal. ... It doesn't make a lot of
sense. I'm happy they're going to act
on it, but it's dubious the way they're
doing it,"he said.
According to Adams, the reason
for splitting the proposal is that the
second part concerns adding a new
section to the C-IR's charge, which is
something that needs more consider
ation. "My understanding is that
Donald Kennedy is looking to get
some recommendations from C-IR"
before he refers the rest of the pro
posal to the Board of Trustees' com
mittee, Adams said.
"The second part is more tricky,"
Geys said. "Kennedy wants to think
about it more carefully. It doesn't
mean he doesn't agree with it."
Although Adams said that in his
own opinion the thrust of the policy
change, focusing on South Africa, is
correct and in keeping with the stated
opinion of the board, it may not be
possible to take action on the pro
posal at the board's June meeting.
"Trying to turn all this around be
tween the end of May and the June
board meeting may be too am
bitious," Adams said.
He said that one thing the C-IR
will need to consider carefully is the
specific wording of the proposal, par
ticuarly the part that attempts to am
mend the C-IR charge. "There are
some sentences that sound wonderful
and some that I had problems with,"
he said. "I doubt the proposal will be
considered for action (at the board's
June meeting), but it may be dis
cussed."
The C-IR will have several
meetings before the board's June
