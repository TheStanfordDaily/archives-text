When was the last time you had a
beer at the laundromat? Does your
grocery store offer bright-colored
shopping bags, a mechanical cow that
sings nursery rhymes, or a petting zoo
outside for kids?
"I use these as illustrations of busi
nesses which have succeeded by
taking the mundane in the most unin
teresting corners of the economy
and turning it into something totally
spectacular — not as a function of
some mysterious set of techniques,
but as a function of finding a way, in a
straightforward fashion, to serve the
customer better," Tom Peters told a
crowd of about 250 people yesterday
in Kresge Auditorium.
Peters, co-author of the best
selling book "In Search of Excel
lence," and co-author of the newly
released "A Passion for Excellence,"
spoke on business management in the
1980s. He earned two degrees in civil
engineering from Cornell University,
as well as a master's and a doctorate
in business from Stanford.
Peters' speech, sponsored by the
International Association of Students
in Economics and Business Manage
ment. emphasized the importance of
direct involvement with the customer
to maximize business success.
"Everything starts with the cus
tomer," Peters said. "If you give the
customer something worth paying
for, he'll pay. The heart of the matter
is getting customer-oriented.
"Customer satisfaction is the most
important measure of business suc
cess." Peters continued. To empha
size this, he cited a survey which
revealed that 6H percent of the cus
tomers of car dealerships chose to
take their business elsewhere due to
"disinterest or indifference shown
them by a dealer in sales or service."
He added that this survey was a
"good systematic sample" of busi

nesses in general.
A key factor involved in serving the
customer's needs is listening, Peters
said. "Unfortunately, the 'experts'
define listening as talking, and that's
the problem."
On the international level, Ameri
can businesses often fail to under
stand the needs of their customers by
making little effort to be inter
nationalists, Peters said. American
business representatives in other
countries often don't speak the lang
uage of their customer, which dis
plays a lack of courtesy, he said.
"A business can succeed in one of
two ways," Peters continued. "Either
by incredible customer service and
product, or by constant innovation."
However, innovation is not easy to
achieve, he said. "Innovations only
make it to the market place by the
persistence of one person — a crazy,
irrational, irradic, nutty, determined,
royal pain-in-the-neck product cham
pion." He added that it is the persis
tence of these "irrational champions"
that provides the magic of compan
ies which constantly innovate.
Peters also stresed the importance
of a deep trust and belief in everyone
in the company as a key to business
success. "Some managers fear that
their associates will rip them off as
soon as they turn around." With com
petent. trustworthy employees, a
manager becomes a true leader, he
said.
"I despise the terms 'manager,'
'management,' and 'managing,'"
Peters said, "mainly because manage
ment to me is about constraining and
constricting and telling, and leader
ship is about growing and developing.
Leadership is what holds it all to
gether."
To all who hope for potential
careers in management, Peters
advised that they have pride and en
thusiasm for their organization.
