Lebanese violence kills 94
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Shiite Moslem militiamen and Lebanese army
units stormed strongpoints in Beirut refugee camps yesterday, driving
back Palestinian guerrillas who battled for their lives in hand-to-hand
combat.
A car bomb exploded in the city's Christian sector, devastating an in
tersection jammed with vehicles at the rush hour. Police reported at least
60 people killed and 190 wounded. Victims were trapped in burning cars
and charred bodies lay everywhere.
Police say the bomb, in the El-Fil district, was set off by a timing
device. It left a crater 10 feet deep and 26 feet wide, ripped walls from
apartment buildings and set more than 50 cars ablaze.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility and police said the
target was not clear.
Leaders of the Shiite militia Amal claimed they had seized the Sabra
and Chatilla camps in house-to-house fighting, capturing scores of Pales
tinian guerrillas. The Shiites began their assault on the camps Sunday
night.
Palestinian spokesmen conceded that several strongpoints in the two
camps were overrun in a three-pronged assault by Amal and Shiite sol
diers of the army's 6th Brigade, but denied that they were overwhelmed.
"Our men are still fighting," one Palestinian official told The Associ
ated Press by telephone. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
Police said at least 34 people were killed and 157 wounded in yester
day's battles, bringing the casualty toll since Sunday to at least 155 killed
and more than 800 wounded.
Amal militiamen herded jeeploads of blindfolded Palestinians, ap
parently captured in the two west Beirut camps, to the Shiites' main in
terrogation center in a the 40-story Murr Tower.
Militiamen in camouflage battle fatigues pushed their prisoners into
the unfinished tower block, slapping and beating them, newsmen outside
the building reported. The militiamen refused to let photographers take
pictures.
Palestinian gunners on hills east of Beirut sought to blunt yesterday's
attack by pounding Shiite residential districts in the south of the city with
artillery fire and at least 100 Grad rockets.
Several rockets hit houses, but no civilian casualty count was
available. Other rounds exploded on the main highway from the capital
to the international airport.
The Palestinian artillery tactic worked for a time. Reporters saw an
Amal attack on a strongpoint in Chatilla collapse when rockets crashed
in. The militiamen thrust into the camps later in the day, led by tanks
and armored personnel carriers from the army's 6th Brigade.
Tijuana police work on corruption
TIJUANA, Mexico — The Tijuana municipal police force is quietly
working to shed its reputation as a department riddled by corruption and
inefficiency, according to Police Chief Gerardo Sosa.
"Not everything is wrong here," says Sosa, who assumed control of
the 800-member department in November. "There are a lot of people
who are really trying to do their job. They are trying to better the image
of the police force," says Sosa, whose reforms have been overshadowed
amid increased border tensions between the United States and Mexico.
In the past six months, Sosa has fired 140 officers, including 30 for ex
tracting "mordidas," or bribes, from tourists.
About 60 officers were fired for sleeping or drinking on duty and an
other 50 were dimissed because "they didn't agree with my discipline,"
Sosa says.
"They arc making an honest attempt to clean up their act in Tijuana,"
says San Diego police spokesman Bill Robinson. He says Tijuana offi
cials need to maintain their vigilance over police activity in the Mexican
border city to restore tourist confidence in the Tijuana police depart
ment.
Navy seaman accused of spying
WASHINGTON — A 22-year-old Navy seaman whose father has
been accused of spying for the Soviets was arrested yesterday aboard the
nuclear aircraft carrier Nimitz and held on similar espionage charges,
authorities said.
A Navy statement said a Naval Investigative Servicc inquiry aboard
the Nimitz, berthed in Haifa, Israel, "has produced evidence that im
plicated" Seaman Michael Walker in a case against his father John, a
retired Navy warrant officer arrested in Maryland on Monday on
charges of spying for the Soviets.
"Seaman Walker was subsequently placed in pretrial confinement in
the brig of the USS Nimitz," the Navy said.
Lt. Stephen Pietropaoli, a Navy spokesman, said he had no informa
tion on what the investigators discovered and did not know where
Walker would be sent next.
CBS News reported last night that Navy investigators found Seaman
Walker "with a hidden box of classified documents next to his bunk"
aboard the Nimitz.
The network quoted an unidentified source close to the investigation
as saying that John Walker's wife and daughter had turned him in to the
FBI.
CBS said investigators also have interviewed the senior Walker's step
brother, a Navy enlisted man specializing in mine detection, but have
brought no charges.
In Baltimore, U.S. Attorney Michacl Schatzow said later in the day
that Michael Walker had been charged with espionage. He said the
younger Walker was expected to be brought to Baltimore within a few
days.
Walker, 22, a member of the Nimitz crew since early 1984, was
working as a clerk in the administrative office of the operations depart
ment. which handles communications and combat functions of the car
rier.
Walker's father, who had served for 20 years as a communications
specialist aboard aircraft carriers, submarines and in sensitive Navy
shore posts, was arrested in nearby Rockville, Md., on Monday and
charged with espionage.
Chinese man given stay extension
CLEVELAND — A judge yesterday granted Chinese farmer
"Charlie Two Shoes" another four-month extension of his stay in the
United States, where he has been living for two years with the ex-
Marines who befriended him 40 years ago in his native land.
"I feel more comfortable now," said Charlie, 50, who was given the
nickname as a 10-year-old boy by his American friends because they
had difficulty pronouncing his real name, Cui Zhxi. "I was bothered that
I would not have enough time.
"In these four months, I would like share my life with many more
people. And there are more of the Marines 1 want to meet. They all
mean so much to me," he said after the deportation hearing before Im
migration Judge Gordon Sacks.
C'ui's lawyer, Samuel Levine of Washington, indicated that a bill
pending before a congressional subcommittee could grant his client per
manent residency within four months.
At the hearing. Cui did not contest the government's claim that he is
deportable. Rather, his attorney filed an application for Cui's voluntary
departure to China along with a motion that he have six months to leave.
Government lawyer Russell Ezolt asked that the stay be limited to no
more than 30 days, saying immigration officials been "unusually
lenient" in the case.
Sacks granted Cui the right to stay until Sept. 22, with the understand
ing that if he remains after that date and circumstances of his visit are
unchanged, lie may be deported.
Both sides agreed not to appeal the decision.
I he Immigration and Naturalization Service officials in Cleveland
already had granted Cui three six-month extensions of his original six-
I month visa.
I ui, who has been staying for two years with former Marine Roy Sibit
and Sibit"s family in lallmadgc in northeastern Ohio, said before the
hearing that he wanted to remain in the United States temporarily be
cause he loves the country.
"Everybody in America is beautiful." he said on the ABC television
program "Good Morning America.""I just love everybody, and I love
this countrv."

"Not everything is wrong here," says Sosa, who assumed control of
the 800-member department in November. "There are a lot of people
who are really trying to do their job. They are trying to better the image
of the police force," says Sosa, whose reforms have been overshadowed
amid increased border tensions between the United States and Mexico.
In the past six months, Sosa has fired 140 officers, including 30 for ex
tracting "mordidas," or bribes, from tourists.
About 60 officers were fired for sleeping or drinking on duty and an
other 50 were dimissed because "they didn't agree with my discipline,"
Sosa says.
"They arc making an honest attempt to clean up their act in Tijuana,"
says San Diego police spokesman Bill Robinson. He says Tijuana offi
cials need to maintain their vigilance over police activity in the Mexican
border city to restore tourist confidence in the Tijuana police depart
ment.
Navy seaman accused of spying
WASHINGTON — A 22-year-old Navy seaman whose father has
been accused of spying for the Soviets was arrested yesterday aboard the
nuclear aircraft carrier Nimitz and held on similar espionage charges,
authorities said.
A Navy statement said a Naval Investigative Servicc inquiry aboard
the Nimitz, berthed in Haifa, Israel, "has produced evidence that im
plicated" Seaman Michael Walker in a case against his father John, a
retired Navy warrant officer arrested in Maryland on Monday on
charges of spying for the Soviets.
"Seaman Walker was subsequently placed in pretrial confinement in
the brig of the USS Nimitz," the Navy said.
Lt. Stephen Pietropaoli, a Navy spokesman, said he had no informa
tion on what the investigators discovered and did not know where
Walker would be sent next.
CBS News reported last night that Navy investigators found Seaman
Walker "with a hidden box of classified documents next to his bunk"
aboard the Nimitz.
The network quoted an unidentified source close to the investigation
as saying that John Walker's wife and daughter had turned him in to the
FBI.
CBS said investigators also have interviewed the senior Walker's step
brother, a Navy enlisted man specializing in mine detection, but have
brought no charges.
In Baltimore, U.S. Attorney Michacl Schatzow said later in the day
that Michael Walker had been charged with espionage. He said the
younger Walker was expected to be brought to Baltimore within a few
days.
Walker, 22, a member of the Nimitz crew since early 1984, was
working as a clerk in the administrative office of the operations depart
ment. which handles communications and combat functions of the car
rier.
Walker's father, who had served for 20 years as a communications
specialist aboard aircraft carriers, submarines and in sensitive Navy
shore posts, was arrested in nearby Rockville, Md., on Monday and
charged with espionage.
Chinese man given stay extension
CLEVELAND — A judge yesterday granted Chinese farmer
"Charlie Two Shoes" another four-month extension of his stay in the
United States, where he has been living for two years with the ex-
Marines who befriended him 40 years ago in his native land.
"I feel more comfortable now," said Charlie, 50, who was given the
nickname as a 10-year-old boy by his American friends because they
had difficulty pronouncing his real name, Cui Zhxi. "I was bothered that
I would not have enough time.
"In these four months, I would like share my life with many more
people. And there are more of the Marines 1 want to meet. They all
mean so much to me," he said after the deportation hearing before Im
migration Judge Gordon Sacks.
C'ui's lawyer, Samuel Levine of Washington, indicated that a bill
pending before a congressional subcommittee could grant his client per
manent residency within four months.
At the hearing. Cui did not contest the government's claim that he is
deportable. Rather, his attorney filed an application for Cui's voluntary
departure to China along with a motion that he have six months to leave.
Government lawyer Russell Ezolt asked that the stay be limited to no
more than 30 days, saying immigration officials been "unusually
lenient" in the case.
Sacks granted Cui the right to stay until Sept. 22, with the understand
ing that if he remains after that date and circumstances of his visit are
unchanged, lie may be deported.
Both sides agreed not to appeal the decision.
I he Immigration and Naturalization Service officials in Cleveland
already had granted Cui three six-month extensions of his original six-
I month visa.
I ui, who has been staying for two years with former Marine Roy Sibit
and Sibit"s family in lallmadgc in northeastern Ohio, said before the
hearing that he wanted to remain in the United States temporarily be
cause he loves the country.
"Everybody in America is beautiful." he said on the ABC television
program "Good Morning America.""I just love everybody, and I love
this countrv."
Lebanese violence kills 94
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Shiite Moslem militiamen and Lebanese army
units stormed strongpoints in Beirut refugee camps yesterday, driving
back Palestinian guerrillas who battled for their lives in hand-to-hand
combat.
A car bomb exploded in the city's Christian sector, devastating an in
tersection jammed with vehicles at the rush hour. Police reported at least
60 people killed and 190 wounded. Victims were trapped in burning cars
and charred bodies lay everywhere.
Police say the bomb, in the El-Fil district, was set off by a timing
device. It left a crater 10 feet deep and 26 feet wide, ripped walls from
apartment buildings and set more than 50 cars ablaze.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility and police said the
target was not clear.
Leaders of the Shiite militia Amal claimed they had seized the Sabra
and Chatilla camps in house-to-house fighting, capturing scores of Pales
tinian guerrillas. The Shiites began their assault on the camps Sunday
night.
Palestinian spokesmen conceded that several strongpoints in the two
camps were overrun in a three-pronged assault by Amal and Shiite sol
diers of the army's 6th Brigade, but denied that they were overwhelmed.
"Our men are still fighting," one Palestinian official told The Associ
ated Press by telephone. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
Police said at least 34 people were killed and 157 wounded in yester
day's battles, bringing the casualty toll since Sunday to at least 155 killed
and more than 800 wounded.
Amal militiamen herded jeeploads of blindfolded Palestinians, ap
parently captured in the two west Beirut camps, to the Shiites' main in
terrogation center in a the 40-story Murr Tower.
Militiamen in camouflage battle fatigues pushed their prisoners into
the unfinished tower block, slapping and beating them, newsmen outside
the building reported. The militiamen refused to let photographers take
pictures.
Palestinian gunners on hills east of Beirut sought to blunt yesterday's
attack by pounding Shiite residential districts in the south of the city with
artillery fire and at least 100 Grad rockets.
Several rockets hit houses, but no civilian casualty count was
available. Other rounds exploded on the main highway from the capital
to the international airport.
The Palestinian artillery tactic worked for a time. Reporters saw an
Amal attack on a strongpoint in Chatilla collapse when rockets crashed
in. The militiamen thrust into the camps later in the day, led by tanks
and armored personnel carriers from the army's 6th Brigade.
Tijuana police work on corruption
TIJUANA, Mexico — The Tijuana municipal police force is quietly
working to shed its reputation as a department riddled by corruption and
