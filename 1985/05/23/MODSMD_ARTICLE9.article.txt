# MX compromise efforts also continue
## Senate OKs chemical weapons 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Senate voted yesterday
to end a 16-year-long U.S. halt in building chemi
cal weapons, setting the stage for another Capitol
Hill showdown over the controversial issue.
The vote was 50-46 against a move to eliminate
nerve gas from a bill authorizing a record Pentagon
budget.
With Vice President George Bush presiding in
case his vote was needed to break a tie, the
Republican-controlled Senate thus gave a go
ahead to the only weapon denied President Reagan
as part of his defense build-up.
But the issue is still far from resolved since the
House has yet to vote on it. For the past three
years, the Democratic-controlled House has
refused to approve the weapons and that position
has prevailed in a conference committee called to
resolve the dispute.
Meanwhile, top Senate Republicans admitted
the White House was likely to be defeated on an
other controversial weapon, the MX missile.
Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.), chief sponsor of the
attempt to kill nerve gas, told his colleagues that re
sumption of production "would undermine our po
sition in Europe" where American allies are

unlikely to approve a NATO stockpile.
But Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) noted the large
Soviet gas stockpile and said, "It is»important that
we let the Soviets know that were aren't going to be
second best and give them an invitation to attack."
Earlier, the Senate voted 68-30 to allow the
Navy permission to spend $53.5 million next year
to prepare to bring the World War II battleship
Wisconsin out of mothballs later in this decade.
The chemical weapons proposal, rejected by
Congress for the past three years, would let the
Army prepare to build new U.S. weapons. No
chemical weapons have been built by the United
States since 1969, but President Reagan says the
nerve gas is needed to offset a growing Soviet gas
stockpile.
But Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.) moved to block
the Army's proposal, arguing that the current
American arsenal is enough.
As that debate was going on, efforts continued
for a second day to work out a compromise on the
MX, a key part of the bill authorizing Pentagon
spending for next year.
The dispute is over whether to limit MX deploy
ment to 40 of the 10-warhead weapons. Reagan
wants 100 of the MXs and Republican leaders were

seeking a compromise with Sen. Sam Nunn (D-
Ga.), author of the proposed 40-missile limit.
Nunn, one of the Senate's most respected
defense experts, told his colleagues that "I am now
at the end of the line on MX as long as it is
deployed in vulnerable Minuteman silos" which
could be knocked out by a Soviet strike.
Nunn was meeting throughout the day at the
Capitol with Reagan's national security adviser,
Robert NlcFarlane, but told reporters that "there's
no meeting of the minds" that would permit a com
promise.
Both Sens. Robert Dole of Kansas and Ted
Stevens of Alaska, the chamber's top-ranking
Republicans, predicted Nunn's proposal would
win. !
A dispute avoided yesterday involved proposals
to limit U.S. military activities in Central America
and whether to provide help for the Contras who
are trying to overthrow the leftist Sandinista gov
ernment of Nicaragua.
The Contra-aid question will be debated next
month in connection with a bill authorizing State
Department spending next year, Senate Majority
Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) told his colleagues)
