Jarvis sued for slander
SACRAMENTO — Tax crusader Howard
Jarvis, facing a $2 million lawsuit, testified yes
terday that he never directed a comment involv
ing prostitution at the woman who is suing him
for slander.
Jarvis, S3, told a jury of six women and three
men in the suit by former Davis community ac
tivist Darla Davisson, that he told a heckler:
"Why don't you go to Nevada? In a house they
have over there, you couldn't make a quarter."
Davisson, 48, has testified that Jarvis
made that remark to her, causing her humiliation
and emotional distress, after she called him "a
crook" during a noisy May 19S0 demonstration
against Jarvis" appearance at Sacramento State
University.
But Jarvis said he made the statement to a dif
ferent, unidentified heckler, and he denied ever
seeing Davisson before their meeting today
in court.
"I said it to someone who said, 'You son of a
bitch, you ought to be deported to Utah," " Jarvis
said. "If she didn't make the statement (about
Utah), then I never talked to her."
Protesters arrested
SAN FRANCISCO — Police arrested 79
people yesterday at a demonstration in which
more than 300 labor council officials protested
apartheid policies outside South African Air
ways.
Officers from eight San Francisco Bay Area
AFL-CIO labor councils and members of various

labor organizations participated in a noon rally at
Union Square.
Carrying signs that read, "We back South
African Unions," and "Reagan Supports Apart
heid," and chanting anti-apartheid slogans, labor
members marched across the street to South
African Airways.
Five police vans and about 50 officers, some of
whom wore riot helmets, waited for the crowd
outside the airline's office.
Richard Groulx, executive secretary of the
Central Labor Council in Alameda County, said
the purpose of the demonstration was to show
that "we are concerned about the people in
South Africa who have no rights."
"Any decent person involved in labor has an
obligation to get involved," said Groulx, who was
among those arrested.
The arrests came about 30 minutes after
protesters sat down and blocked the entrance of
South African Airways. Capt. Charles Beene said
the protesters were arrested for obstructing a
sidewalk.
Molest case continues
LOS ANGELES — Saying she has no funds to
pay her lawyer, preschool founder Virginia
McMartin yesterday asked to represent herself at
a hearing to decide if she and six co-workers will
be tried on 208 child molestation and conspiracy
charges.
"I consider it against my moral ethics to have
someone work for free for me," McMartin said as
she entered the tourtroom yesterday afternoon.

Inside, she told Municipal Court Judge Aviva
Bobb: "I will not have anyone work for me for
nothing."
Bobb, who announced that the 77-year-old
Manhattan Beach preschool founder had been
found indigent, said she would rule today on
McMartin s request to represent herself.
The judge pointed out, however, that Brunon
had agreed to defend McMartin with knowledge
of her financial condition.
"You have paid him a substantial amount of
money and he is obligated to represent you,"
Bobb told McMartin.
"You and the district attorney insisted I go
through this," McMartin responded. "He has a
family to support. With no money coming in, how
is he going to live?"
Asked outside court if he could be ordered by
the judge to represent McMartin without addi
tional compensation, Bradley Brunon, her attor
ney, said, "I could, yes."
McMartin told the judge that she already has
lost her livelihood because of a legal system
"where anybody can file false charges against you
and you have to defend yourself."
