## Exhibit displays artists' personal explorations 
### LEE CLINE 
The work is comparable to the
work in many San Fransisco art
galleries, says Steve Schlichtenmyer,
one of this year's four candidates for
the master of fine arts (MFA)
degree at Stanford, in what is prob
ably a vast understatement.
The MFA exhibition now at the
Stanford Art Gallery is bustlmg with
energy, imagination and wit far su
perior to that found in run-of-the
mill San Fransisco art galleries. The
exhibited works include paintings,
photographs and sculpture by
Schlichtenmyer, Jil Evans, Anna
Goslicka and Matthew Haberstroh.
The art is not only personal and
refreshingly non-commercial, but
also intelligent and highly original.
"This marks the end of two years of
concentrated work by these four.
We've really put them through the
mill," says Keith Boyle, director of
the Stanford MFA program. The pro
gram is comprised of a weekly semi
nar, where the students present their
work to a group of professors for cri
tique. They are also given an oppor
tunity to help teach undergraduate
courses in their area of concentration.
The students attend no formal
classes.
"There's a lot of isolation in the
program. They gave me time to work
alone, so that I could realize my own

judgment and discipline my own
eye," says Evans.
"It's been two years of — I would
say — intense personal exploration,"
says Schlichtenmyer. "The work goes
under very heavy criticism, very close
scrutiny. You're asked questions, and
you're expected to hold your own.
The works should be an expression of
conscious thought."
The program has "done more for
me than I can realize at this moment.
They taught me to speak up on the
one hand and to listen on the other,"
Goslicka says.
"We're not here to get our art
degree. We respect the faculty. We're
here because we want to be, because
it's good for our art," Schlictenmyer
says. "We're right up there as one
of the best programs in the country,"
says Boyle. "It's Yale and lowa and
us. We've got grads all over the
country. Stanford carries a name."
Abstractions
Jil Evans, one of the two painters at
the exhibition, obtained her bachelor
of fine arts (BFA) from Calvin Col
lege and a master's in painting in
1983 from the University of lowa.
"I've been working on abstraction
all along. I've been trying to develop
imagery that is meaningful to me. In
my mind the work is more personal:

I'm not trying to make any big state
ments," Evans says. She tries to
create imagery that is "close to being
recognizable," she adds. "When I'm
painting I'm thinking a lot about
memories and dreams. There are ref
erences in the work to landscape and
to animal and human forms."
This is one of the most fascinating
elements of her painting: Although
her work is abstract, occasionally one
can distinguish a recognizable shape
that introduces a new angle from
which one may perceive her works.
Her titles are particularly effective in
alerting the viewer of certain forms;
"Hot Wire" and "Rib Pole" espe
cially create a wonderful imagistic
dialogue.
Evans says she has specifically
worked on her use of color while here
at Stanford. She cites a few artistic in
fluences as DeKooning and Turner,
and connections can be drawn espe
cially in terms of rich, bright use of
color and expressionistic brushstroke.
Her six most recent paintings make
exceptional use of glowing color, and
certain areas of her paintings are daz
zling conjunctions of violets, tur
quoises, mauves, yellows, pinks and
oranges. In addition, her works are
richly textured, both in her imagery
and her application of paint to the
canvas.
"The faculty encouraged me to

keep my work personal,'' Evans says.
She adds that, in regard to painting in
more commercial terms, she is
"opposed to that sort of mentality."
People at home
Anna Goslicka grew up in Poland
and graduated with a BFA degree
from Rice University in 1982. Her in
itial intent was to study architecture
and to draw.
It was at Rice that she discovered
photography. Goslicka says she in
stantly "knew that was it. The im
mediacy of the medium was so attrac
tive." From the beginning, she was
"very excited about photographing
people, but it was a little intimidating
to approach them. Since I was study
ing architecture, I photographed that.
But it was too easy." Goslicka finally
turned to photographing people.
"That is the real challenge. It's un
predictable— 1/125-second psychol
ogy," she says.
Goslicka's subject matter ranges
from portraits of East Palo Alto
blacks, a sword swallower and a gypsy
to upper-middle-class families. The
old and young, wealthy and destitute,
freaks and painfully ordinary people
are all photographed in their homes,
their bars, the environments that in
