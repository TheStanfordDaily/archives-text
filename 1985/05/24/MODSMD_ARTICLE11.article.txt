## Exhibit displays artists' personal explorations 
### LEE CLINE 
The work is comparable to the
work in many San Fransisco art
galleries, says Steve Schlichtenmyer,
one of this year's four candidates for
the master of fine arts (MFA)
degree at Stanford, in what is prob
ably a vast understatement.
The MFA exhibition now at the
Stanford Art Gallery is bustlmg with
energy, imagination and wit far su
perior to that found in run-of-the
mill San Fransisco art galleries. The
exhibited works include paintings,
photographs and sculpture by
Schlichtenmyer, Jil Evans, Anna
Goslicka and Matthew Haberstroh.
The art is not only personal and
refreshingly non-commercial, but
also intelligent and highly original.
"This marks the end of two years of
concentrated work by these four.
We've really put them through the
mill," says Keith Boyle, director of
the Stanford MFA program. The pro
gram is comprised of a weekly semi
nar, where the students present their
work to a group of professors for cri
tique. They are also given an oppor
tunity to help teach undergraduate
courses in their area of concentration.
The students attend no formal
classes.
"There's a lot of isolation in the
program. They gave me time to work
alone, so that I could realize my own

judgment and discipline my own
eye," says Evans.
"It's been two years of — I would
say — intense personal exploration,"
says Schlichtenmyer. "The work goes
under very heavy criticism, very close
scrutiny. You're asked questions, and
you're expected to hold your own.
The works should be an expression of
conscious thought."
The program has "done more for
me than I can realize at this moment.
They taught me to speak up on the
one hand and to listen on the other,"
Goslicka says.
"We're not here to get our art
degree. We respect the faculty. We're
here because we want to be, because
it's good for our art," Schlictenmyer
says. "We're right up there as one
of the best programs in the country,"
says Boyle. "It's Yale and lowa and
us. We've got grads all over the
country. Stanford carries a name."
Abstractions
Jil Evans, one of the two painters at
the exhibition, obtained her bachelor
of fine arts (BFA) from Calvin Col
lege and a master's in painting in
1983 from the University of lowa.
"I've been working on abstraction
all along. I've been trying to develop
imagery that is meaningful to me. In
my mind the work is more personal:

I'm not trying to make any big state
ments," Evans says. She tries to
create imagery that is "close to being
recognizable," she adds. "When I'm
painting I'm thinking a lot about
memories and dreams. There are ref
erences in the work to landscape and
to animal and human forms."
This is one of the most fascinating
elements of her painting: Although
her work is abstract, occasionally one
can distinguish a recognizable shape
that introduces a new angle from
which one may perceive her works.
Her titles are particularly effective in
alerting the viewer of certain forms;
"Hot Wire" and "Rib Pole" espe
cially create a wonderful imagistic
dialogue.
Evans says she has specifically
worked on her use of color while here
at Stanford. She cites a few artistic in
fluences as DeKooning and Turner,
and connections can be drawn espe
cially in terms of rich, bright use of
color and expressionistic brushstroke.
Her six most recent paintings make
exceptional use of glowing color, and
certain areas of her paintings are daz
zling conjunctions of violets, tur
quoises, mauves, yellows, pinks and
oranges. In addition, her works are
richly textured, both in her imagery
and her application of paint to the
canvas.
"The faculty encouraged me to

keep my work personal,'' Evans says.
She adds that, in regard to painting in
more commercial terms, she is
"opposed to that sort of mentality."
People at home
Anna Goslicka grew up in Poland
and graduated with a BFA degree
from Rice University in 1982. Her in
itial intent was to study architecture
and to draw.
It was at Rice that she discovered
photography. Goslicka says she in
stantly "knew that was it. The im
mediacy of the medium was so attrac
tive." From the beginning, she was
"very excited about photographing
people, but it was a little intimidating
to approach them. Since I was study
ing architecture, I photographed that.
But it was too easy." Goslicka finally
turned to photographing people.
"That is the real challenge. It's un
predictable— 1/125-second psychol
ogy," she says.
Goslicka's subject matter ranges
from portraits of East Palo Alto
blacks, a sword swallower and a gypsy
to upper-middle-class families. The
old and young, wealthy and destitute,
freaks and painfully ordinary people
are all photographed in their homes,
their bars, the environments that in

herently reflect the subjects' per
sonalities. Goslicka believes that
"environment can tell a lot about
people; it's an integral part of them."
Particularly effective environment
subject relationships include her East
Palo Alto bar photographs, which ac
tually came about by accident. She
had parked in front of a bar and had
her back to her car for a moment
when she turned around and dis
covered that her photographic
equipment had been stolen. "I en
tered the bar to look for a phone to
call the police, and 1 discovered that
the people inside were great."
Also interesting is her portrayal of
the upper-middle-class families. Kids
are floating in seas of toys, and
women use exotic fabrics to cover
their sterile white walls, to cover
furniture, to cover themselves. And,

of course, there is the übiquitous tele
vision. Fabrics and toys are always
telling elements in Goslicka's works.
Reflecting the states of all her charac
ters, there is a hand-crocheted
bedspread, a beautiful lace dress, a
blue satin robe, stuffed animals, bal
loons, a crystal ball.
Goslicka spends a long time with
her subjects and lets them do
whatever they like. "1 never ask them
where to sit, how to pose." Regarding
problematic subjects, she says, "if
they don't want to be photographed, 1
don't remember them."
Although she does occasionally
photograph a "freak," Goslicka
denies any connections to "freak"
photographer Diane Arbus. Even
though she respects her, she says"l
don't like to be compared to Diane
Arbus. She is rather grim." Goslicka
prefers to see herself as somewhat
more optimistic.
Goslicka hopes to go into teaching
once she leaves Stanford. "I enjoy

teaching. That is another wonderful
thing about the Stanford program.
They give us the opportunity to
teach."
The most important element of
teaching, she believes, is to convey
the excitement of photography.
When she began, "I didn't know how
to do it, but I did know what I was
after, which is much more important
than knowing, oh. how many lenses
are on the market," she says.
Titles
Matthew Haberstroh, represented
by his sculpture and a conceptual
piece in the show, is originally from
San Diego and received a BFA from
the San Fransisco Art Institute in
1983. His sculpture consists of
veritable knots of tube-like shapes of
varying thickness, color and texture.
Some shapes are made from plaster
and wire, while others are acually
contorted branches, intricately woven

in to create a gnarled air of anxiety.
"I've been working on the tubular
shape for a while, since 1977 or so.
The branches are a new thing, the last
six months or so. The reason I started
putting branches and smaller tubes on
my work was for more contrast." A
sculpture may acually be ripped apart
and reconstructed several times
before it is finished. Haberstroh par
ticularly likes plaster because it
allows him to do this.
He uses spray enamels to color his
works in industrial reds, blues and sil
vers. "It's fun to spray. I don't like
brushes. I 'II hold three to four cans in
my hand so that the colors mix before
they hit the piece."
An amusing aspect of Haberstroh's
art is his attitude toward it, as demon
strated by his own descriptions of his
work and by his titles. "Mold that
silicon chip, jockey into your
paranoid live-in, your sloppy wimp,
your elf of the east, your elf of the
east" is the title the artist gave to a
particular piece which he likes to
think of as "something you'd find at
the bottom of a ravine." Another
work, "They'll Hide In The Cultural
Sink. . has "a shamanistic quality,"
Haberstroh says.
He explains where he gets his titles:
"I keep journals, and I write poetics
and prose. When I need a title I look
into the journals. I use the titles for
people to understand me, to get to
know what I'm about."
In addition to the sculpture,
Haberstroh is also showing a
"conceptual piece," an assemblage of
various items brought in to portray an
artistic scene. Against an uneven wall
of cement blocks, Haberstroh has
placed painted bamboo branches, an
orange television, with fuzz, and a set
of wonderful photographs of Presi
dent Reagan on TV, all set on a bed
of sand. "There's a certain amount of
symbolism (in the piece). I'm really
involved with TV, I watch it all the
time. It's like McDonald's — people
say they never watch it but they do."
Haberstroh says he tried to give the
piece an "Americana look," espe
cially with the Statue of Liberty
image sketched onto the wall. "1
wanted to give it a not-quite-built
look, like it's not structured right, not
only in a physical sense but in media's

effect on society."
The title, again, is an essential part
of the piece, something the artist ac
tually heard on a television newscast:
"march 19, 1984, 11:30 p.m. — an
explosion on the east coast at a nu
clear power plant, a fully armed rus
sian spy ship sits"2s miles off the west
coast near fort bragg, a russian
aircraft carrier is in the carribbean.
what's up? oh nothing, just a blown
arms deal in poland involving russian
advanced design tanks."
Haberstroh has done a few concep
tual pieces before, using materials
and effects such as computerized
music and slide dissolves. He has also
worked extensively in photography.

He calls himself "schizophrenic ... in
art terms 1 vary."
Color
Steve Schlichtenmyer, artist of the
second set of paintings, plus a series
of drawings and collage, is a native of
San Diego and obtained his bach
elor's in art in 1981; he also spent a
year studying at the Tyler School of
Art in Rome.
Schlichtenmyer's drawings and
collage explore shape, dimension and
coloration of object and background
in relation to each other. The artist's

A man looks at photographs by Anna Goslicka, a candidate for the master of fine arts degree. Goslicka
photographs people — from sword swallowers and gypsies to East Palo Alto residents and upper-middle-class
families — and catches them in their environments.


The works of Jil Evans, Steve Schlichtenmyer, Matthew Haberstroh
and Anna Goslicka comprise the exhibition of studio art by candidates
for the master of fine arts degree.
trademark form — akin to twisting,
contorted coils, rope and roots — are
most effective in his large paintings.
The shapes are boundlessly aggres
sive and unnerving, and the vibrant,
unusual colors he uses adds to the
tension of the works.
A painting must be substantial,
Schlichtenmyer believes. "I cannot
stand art that is stylized, vague." He
adds, "anything trendy bugs the crap
out of me.
"1 like agressive painting, not to
the point of being shocking, but
something you just don't see
everyday. I like painting that asks
questions. A big issue for me is en
ergy — not mindless, but focused en
ergy. Franz Kline was pretty ener
getic. There's energy behind every
brushstroke."
Regarding color, he says: "Color is
critical for me. I get tired of looking

at color out of the tube. I like colors a
little weird, hut I don't use them for
shock value. I want a certain light to
come from the color.
"I'm interested in image, not like
(Jackson) Pollock. I'm concerned
with space in paintings — space which
is highly structured, yet somewhat
contorted. I want paintings to have a
presence that is engaging, that makes
you want to look at them, that makes
you want to investigate. I want people
to leave and remember (my paint
ings), not to be able to define them,
but to remember them."
Schlichtenmyer's "Adagio" is a
particularly interesting work in the
inherent dichotomy of color and
form. A knot of moving, agitated
form is colored in cool blues and
greens, with the added twist of a
sliver of red. Another work,
"Banshee," appropriately named for
the tension in the raspberry reds, the
yellow-greens and the twisted, yet
lyric, form, the artist describes as
"not a safe painting." In addition,
Schlichtenmyer's "Scherzo" is one of

his most effective works in terms of
defining an intriguing space and,
again, the violets and pinks are excit
ing to explore.
Exhibit
The artists agree that they have
learned much from each other during
the past two years and have
developed a strong feeling of
camaraderie. The gallery dividers
have been modified to allow for more
flow between artists' areas. Certainly
the creativity and energy is shared by
all the artists, and the result is a uni
versally strong show.
Haberstroh believes that one of the
best aspects of the exhibit is that it
will increase students' awareness of
Stanford artists. "A lot of people
don't even know we're here."
The MFA Exhibition will continue
through June 16th at the Stanford
Art Gallery, next to Cummings Art
Building. The gallery is open Tuesday
through Friday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
and Saturday and Sunday 1 to 5 p.m.
