## The 						Stanford Daily An incentive to divest 
### 
Stanford's Board of Trustees will divest of the
University's South Africa-linked stocks only if it
is a financially attractive move, columnist Jim
Naureckas argued on this page Wednesday.
Naureckas quoted Trustee James Gaither as
saying Board members are bound by duty to
maximize profits — a goal that takes precedence
over morality. Gaither implied the trustees' posi
tion would change only if economics calls for it.
We see no reason to dispute this. To achieve
total divestment, students, faculty, staff and
others in the community who demand Stanford
divestment may have to use some economic in
itiatives of their own.
A group of seniors here has launched a petition
drive aimed at making economic pressure a
reality. Petition signatories say they will withhold
senior pledges to Stanford until the trustees take
significant steps toward divestment.
This may sound like a good way to hit the trus
tees in the coffers. But such a petition is
problematic, considering many seniors would not
give to the University in any case. In other words,
the petition has the potential to give some would
be donors an opportunity not to donate to an

otherwise worthy cause.
There's a better idea, one that would act as an
incentive to divest rather than a punishment for
not divesting. It calls for the establishment of an
independent fund for people who want to give
money to Stanford but are still seeking divest
ment. The fund would be invested in South
Africa-free stocks, and would be handed over to
the University only when the trustees have
satisfied predetermined criteria that constitute
significant progress toward divestment.
Call it the dangling-carrot method. The goal is
to create as attractive a carrot as possible by
soliciting donations from seniors, alumni, corpo
rations and others in the community who other
wise may or may not have donated to Stanford.
No doubt, such a move would be complicated, re
quiring attorneys and investment experts and
perhaps a clause to dispose of the fund if the trus
tees fail to divest by a given deadline.
But creativity is the way to keep the quest for
divestment alive, and establishing a well
endowed incentive fund may take us that much
closer to a responsible Stanford investment
policy.
