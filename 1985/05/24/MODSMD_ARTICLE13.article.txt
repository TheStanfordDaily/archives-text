## Board needs student members 
### 
One of the most important issues raised by Stan
ford Out of South Africa during this year's cam
paign for divestment — and one that will live
beyond the resolution of the current debate — is
that of the University's accountability to students,
faculty and alumni. As the conflict this spring has
proven again, the president of the University and
the Board of Trustees are accountable to no one
but themselves — and certainly not to the faculty or
students. This lack of accountability is apparent in
numerous other University decisions, but it gener
ally goes unnoticed except by a vigilant few.

VIEWPOINT

Accountability — that is, responsibility for one's
decision and actions — is an important concept, es
pecially in the training ground for "real life" that is
Stanford. Institutional, governmental and corpor
ate acccountability are all watchwords for an active
and participatory citizenry.
How does this relate to Stanford? Countless
decisions affecting you and me and the future of the
University are made every day; the most important
of these are made or ratified by the University
president and the Board of Trustees. Most mem
bers of the Stanford community are unaware of
even the most far-reaching decisions, and, even if
they are — as the recent debates over the Stanford
Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, the Reagan Li
brary complex, divestment, the United Stanford
Workers and the role of the Hoover Institution
have all proven — they have no institutional
recourse or voice.
One way to improve the accountability of the
president and the trustees is to have two or three
students serve on the Board of Trustees. This has
been called for by SOSA, and it is — along with
their other ideas, with which I am in almost total
agreement — an important first step. The Univer
sity response is predictable: "But you already have
student members of trustee committees, what do
you want more for?" The simple answer is, there
are no student members of the full board, and thus
no voting members.
Also, who are our representatives and what are
they doing? Several have played a leading role in
the divestment debate — including drafting some
important reform proposals now before their com
mittees — and should he lauded for this. But why
don't we hear from them about other important
decisions and actions of the trustees? Why are they
content to work in institutional anonymity? The
answer is expectation. We have no high expectation
of them.
We enter — and leave — Stanford with no ex

pectation that we as students should know how, by
whom, and for whom University policy is made.
We see only the most overt actions of the Univesity
and trustees: a new bell tower, a reform in alcohol
policy, the naming of the provost. We rarely hear
about the big decisions — building the Center for
Integrated Systems, for instance — until long after
they are made.
In turn, the trustees have no expectation of
hearing from us. Thus, they speak with us at dorm
meetings and the like, but as most who have atten
ded these get-togethers will attest, the events do
little to encourage discourse on "big" questions —
such as the role of morality in University invest
ment, or the increasing corporatization of our edu
cation — but are instead showcases for some of our
more important or wealthy alumni. If we have no
prior knowledge of what the trustees do, much less
any knowledge of how or why they do it, how can
we engage them in an enlightened debate or even
ask probing questions?

If we have no prior knowledge of what the trustees
do, much less any knowledge of how or why they do
it, how can we engage them in an enlightened
debate or even ask probing questions?

So, why not have two students on the full Board
of Trustees? Maybe even a faculty member? The
Board of Trustees is supposed to be above the
year-to-year caprice of the students and faculty,
and SOSA's call for eight students is unrealistic in
this regard, but surely a student voice or two would
not pervert the intent of the board: It might even
alert the trustees to the current whim or whimsey
so they wouldn't inadvertently fall prey to it.
The role of our student representatives would be
far different from those dedicated but still silent
committee members who are our emissaries today.
These would be students who, after each monthly
meeting, could issue a press release or hold a forum
to discuss trustee decisions and solicit student in
put. It is most important that these students be not
only voices from the students to the trustees, but
also voices from the trustees to the students. This
not only lets the student body know what the trus
tees are doing, but also encourages accountability.

Our representatives could report back to their fel
low students that "Old Man So-and-so is always
sleeping; all the trustees talk about is the football
team; and Mr. What's-his-name thinks that the
goal of the University should be to encourage de
velopment on the Peninsula rather than educate
students." Or they could report back, "Our trus
tees are doing a wonderful job of running our uni
versity." Either way, the expectation is fostered
among the students that they will know why deci
sions are being made.
In an institution that prides itself on providing an
excellent education, what better complement to
that education than to learn how the institution it
self is run? We might attract civically minded
prospective students, who hear that they can —
unlike at other, lesser schools — take an active role
in University decisions, or at least learn how the
decisions are made. What better course in manage
ment than hands-on training from or first-hand ob
servations of some of the greatest managers in the

country, managing our own university? And —
perish the thought — maybe, just maybe, the trus
tees would also learn from monthly interaction with
the students they purportedly represent. They
might learn the day-to-day consequences of their
decisions, or learn which departments need im
provement, or whether the University president is
doing a good job in the eyes of the students. They
might learn that some students have been con
cerned with Stanford's investment in companies
that do business in South Africa for a long time, but
have languished for want of an institutional voice.
And so. President Kennedy, in the name
of improving all of our educations at Stan
ford, I challenge you to press for this much-needed
reform before the trustees. Give us the tools to en
lighten ourselves, and pray that we take advantage
of them.

Stanford. Institutional, governmental and corpor
ate acccountability are all watchwords for an active
and participatory citizenry.
How does this relate to Stanford? Countless
decisions affecting you and me and the future of the
University are made every day; the most important
of these are made or ratified by the University
president and the Board of Trustees. Most mem
bers of the Stanford community are unaware of
even the most far-reaching decisions, and, even if
they are — as the recent debates over the Stanford
Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, the Reagan Li
brary complex, divestment, the United Stanford
Workers and the role of the Hoover Institution
have all proven — they have no institutional
recourse or voice.
One way to improve the accountability of the
president and the trustees is to have two or three
students serve on the Board of Trustees. This has
been called for by SOSA, and it is — along with
their other ideas, with which I am in almost total
agreement — an important first step. The Univer
sity response is predictable: "But you already have
student members of trustee committees, what do
you want more for?" The simple answer is, there
are no student members of the full board, and thus
no voting members.
Also, who are our representatives and what are
they doing? Several have played a leading role in
the divestment debate — including drafting some
important reform proposals now before their com
mittees — and should he lauded for this. But why
don't we hear from them about other important
decisions and actions of the trustees? Why are they
content to work in institutional anonymity? The
answer is expectation. We have no high expectation
of them.
We enter — and leave — Stanford with no ex

pectation that we as students should know how, by
whom, and for whom University policy is made.
We see only the most overt actions of the Univesity
and trustees: a new bell tower, a reform in alcohol
policy, the naming of the provost. We rarely hear
about the big decisions — building the Center for
Integrated Systems, for instance — until long after
they are made.
In turn, the trustees have no expectation of
hearing from us. Thus, they speak with us at dorm
meetings and the like, but as most who have atten
ded these get-togethers will attest, the events do
little to encourage discourse on "big" questions —
such as the role of morality in University invest
ment, or the increasing corporatization of our edu
cation — but are instead showcases for some of our
more important or wealthy alumni. If we have no
prior knowledge of what the trustees do, much less
any knowledge of how or why they do it, how can
we engage them in an enlightened debate or even
ask probing questions?

So, why not have two students on the full Board
of Trustees? Maybe even a faculty member? The
Board of Trustees is supposed to be above the
year-to-year caprice of the students and faculty,
and SOSA's call for eight students is unrealistic in
this regard, but surely a student voice or two would
not pervert the intent of the board: It might even
alert the trustees to the current whim or whimsey
so they wouldn't inadvertently fall prey to it.
The role of our student representatives would be
far different from those dedicated but still silent
committee members who are our emissaries today.
These would be students who, after each monthly
meeting, could issue a press release or hold a forum
to discuss trustee decisions and solicit student in
put. It is most important that these students be not
only voices from the students to the trustees, but
also voices from the trustees to the students. This
not only lets the student body know what the trus
tees are doing, but also encourages accountability.

Our representatives could report back to their fel
low students that "Old Man So-and-so is always
sleeping; all the trustees talk about is the football
team; and Mr. What's-his-name thinks that the
goal of the University should be to encourage de
velopment on the Peninsula rather than educate
students." Or they could report back, "Our trus
tees are doing a wonderful job of running our uni
versity." Either way, the expectation is fostered
among the students that they will know why deci
sions are being made.
In an institution that prides itself on providing an
excellent education, what better complement to
that education than to learn how the institution it
self is run? We might attract civically minded
prospective students, who hear that they can —
unlike at other, lesser schools — take an active role
in University decisions, or at least learn how the
decisions are made. What better course in manage
ment than hands-on training from or first-hand ob
servations of some of the greatest managers in the

country, managing our own university? And —
perish the thought — maybe, just maybe, the trus
tees would also learn from monthly interaction with
the students they purportedly represent. They
might learn the day-to-day consequences of their
decisions, or learn which departments need im
provement, or whether the University president is
doing a good job in the eyes of the students. They
might learn that some students have been con
cerned with Stanford's investment in companies
that do business in South Africa for a long time, but
have languished for want of an institutional voice.
And so. President Kennedy, in the name
of improving all of our educations at Stan
ford, I challenge you to press for this much-needed
reform before the trustees. Give us the tools to en
lighten ourselves, and pray that we take advantage
of them.

One of the most important issues raised by Stan
ford Out of South Africa during this year's cam
paign for divestment — and one that will live
beyond the resolution of the current debate — is
that of the University's accountability to students,
faculty and alumni. As the conflict this spring has
proven again, the president of the University and
the Board of Trustees are accountable to no one
but themselves — and certainly not to the faculty or
students. This lack of accountability is apparent in
numerous other University decisions, but it gener
ally goes unnoticed except by a vigilant few.

VIEWPOINT

Accountability — that is, responsibility for one's
decision and actions — is an important concept, es
pecially in the training ground for "real life" that is
Stanford. Institutional, governmental and corpor
ate acccountability are all watchwords for an active
and participatory citizenry.
