# On seniors, fat ladies and Yogi Berra
## 
### 
Ha, you can't fool me. I know what you're think
ing. You think there's only three weeks left and
then you're out of here — done with another year,
done with your college career. No more school
work; no more loud stereos; no more insensitive
roommates; no more bullshit. It's all over.
Well, you're wrong.
In the immortal words of Casey Stengel, it's not
over 'til the fat lady sings. Casey himself was a tall,
thin gentleman, and I always got the idea he had a
phobia about fat women. Deep inside, however, I
believe this statement has a much greater signifi
cance. To me. it means that nothing ever ends, it
merely fades away or transforms itself. If you can't
give in 'til the fat lady sings, you're not going
anywhere. The fat lady spends 12 hours a day at
Domino's and the other 12 hours sleeping. Occa
sionally, she sings in her sleep, but who's there to
listen? And even if you were there, would you ad
mit it? Seriously.
And for all you soon-to-be graduates, I bet
you're thinking: What about this Mario Cuomo
guy? When he speaks, isn't it going to be all over?
He must be the fat lady, no?
No! No! A thousand times no! Sure he talks
funny, and I've been told he wears panty hose; but
that's OK. He's a New Yorker. The fact of the mat
ter is graduation is nothing more than a step in the
upward direction. Forget that your high school
guidance counselor told you, "Hiese are the best
times of your life." That's why she's only a high
school guidance counselor. The best times of your
life are right now. and every right now as it comes
up. Your life is yours to mold. Don't sit back and
let yourself be manipulated. Explore new ad
ventures. Travel to exotic places. Meet different
kinds of people. (Sounds like the Army, huh?) If
you don't let yourself grow old. it's not going to
happen. Think young and you are young. Remem

ber — success should be measured in spiritual
happiness, not money.
All you undergraduates should watch out for Liz
Taylor. I could be wrong, but I think she's the fat
lady. It's a sad sight to see, but I think there's a
moral in here somewhere. Remember what they al-

All you undergraduates

Taylor.

ways told you about cleanliness being next to godli
ness. OK. I know it's not true. I, too. looked it up in
the dictionary and they're nearly 3()0 pages apart.
But that's not the point. Don't let yourself get like
that. Keep yourself in shape both physically and
mentally. Don't forget about freedom, it's what this
country was founded on. Continue to be your own

person. You'll be much happier if you do.
This leads me to another point. It's not over 'til
the cops shut you down. Last weekend's Rinc-a
delt party. Delta Upsilon Luau and Flo Mo Field
Party were shut down early by police order. Rumor
has it they were receiving calls from unhappy
neighbors. Cmon, guys, catch a clue. This campus
is as much ours as it is anyone else's. They should
have no more say over our noise than we have over
their silence. Look at the facts. Rinc-a-delts was
closed at 11:15 p.m., Flo Mo in the middle of the
afternoon. Does this sound reasonable? Assuming
most of Stanford's adjacent community acquired
their homes after the University was built, you'd
think they might be a little bit more cooperative.
By the same token, however, Stanford Univer
sity is being no more reasonable in its handling of
the matter. Rinc-a-delts. as an example, is an an
nual campus-wide function. Planned early in the
year, its date was set for many months. You'd think
the University might offer a little more support.
After all, they more than anyone should know what
goes into planning a campus-wide event. How
would they feel, if let's say a football game, or a
dedication ceremony, or maybe even the orienta
tion party thrown for freshmen at the beginning of
the year was closed down. I bet they never thought
of that, huh?
One more quote. Yogi Berra, twice the former
manager of the New York Yankees, once said: "It
ain't over 'til it's over." I bet the University likes
that. If they say it's over, it's over. Well, I per
sonally will have no part of their manipulative bul
lshit and will continue to fight for what I deserve.
And, to the rest of you: Be your own person,
even if it means being different. Seriously. It's the
only way to go.

ventures. Travel to exotic places. Meet different
kinds of people. (Sounds like the Army, huh?) If
you don't let yourself grow old. it's not going to
happen. Think young and you are young. Remem

ber — success should be measured in spiritual
happiness, not money.
All you undergraduates should watch out for Liz
Taylor. I could be wrong, but I think she's the fat
lady. It's a sad sight to see, but I think there's a
moral in here somewhere. Remember what they al-

ways told you about cleanliness being next to godli
ness. OK. I know it's not true. I, too. looked it up in
the dictionary and they're nearly 3()0 pages apart.
But that's not the point. Don't let yourself get like
that. Keep yourself in shape both physically and
mentally. Don't forget about freedom, it's what this
country was founded on. Continue to be your own

person. You'll be much happier if you do.
This leads me to another point. It's not over 'til
the cops shut you down. Last weekend's Rinc-a
delt party. Delta Upsilon Luau and Flo Mo Field
Party were shut down early by police order. Rumor
has it they were receiving calls from unhappy
neighbors. Cmon, guys, catch a clue. This campus
is as much ours as it is anyone else's. They should
have no more say over our noise than we have over
their silence. Look at the facts. Rinc-a-delts was
closed at 11:15 p.m., Flo Mo in the middle of the
afternoon. Does this sound reasonable? Assuming
most of Stanford's adjacent community acquired
their homes after the University was built, you'd
think they might be a little bit more cooperative.
By the same token, however, Stanford Univer
sity is being no more reasonable in its handling of
the matter. Rinc-a-delts. as an example, is an an
nual campus-wide function. Planned early in the
year, its date was set for many months. You'd think
the University might offer a little more support.
After all, they more than anyone should know what
goes into planning a campus-wide event. How
would they feel, if let's say a football game, or a
dedication ceremony, or maybe even the orienta
tion party thrown for freshmen at the beginning of
the year was closed down. I bet they never thought
of that, huh?
One more quote. Yogi Berra, twice the former
manager of the New York Yankees, once said: "It
ain't over 'til it's over." I bet the University likes
that. If they say it's over, it's over. Well, I per
sonally will have no part of their manipulative bul
lshit and will continue to fight for what I deserve.
And, to the rest of you: Be your own person,
even if it means being different. Seriously. It's the
only way to go.
