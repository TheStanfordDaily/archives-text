KZSU finance
1 was extremely pleased to read
the article "KZSU ends first fund
raiser" (The Daily, May 21). Along
with many other students, I believe
that KZSU should strengthen its
efforts at fund raising and underwrit
ing.
As a member of'the KZSU Board
of Directors, I see increased financial
independence as one of two impor
tant long-term goals that will im
prove KZSU's popularity among
students. Increased fund raising will
reduce the amount of KZSU's fee
assessment and thus will save stu
dents money.
The other important policy change
for KZSU, in my opinion, is to adopt
a more fixed programming schedule.
I would suggest that KZSU play one
type of music in the morning, a
different type in the afternoon and a
third type in the evening. This would
allow students to know what to
expect if they tune in KZSU.
Moreover, the two policy changes
are interrelated. If more students
listen to KZSU, it stands to reason
that KZSU would be better able to
obtain fund raising and underwriting
support.

Afrikaaners' power
Many of the discussions of the role
of American corporations in South
Africa have been concerned, in the
main, with the immorality of the
apartheid system. We applaud the
widespread repudiation of the apart
heid system, as even investors them
selves profess. Although such a
system was officially denounced in
America 20 years ago, it has been
perpetuated unofficially following
centuries of conditioning through
racist practices. It is proper that
concerned Americans be cognizant
of the history of this country's
European mentality with its ag
gressively racist approach toward
native Americans first, and then
toward Africans, Asians, Mexicans,
etc.
In view of these observations, and

the fact that the purely economic
arguments against divestment are
incredibly weak, why do the trustees
continue to refuse to consider divest
ment in the face of mounting
criticism? It has been pointed out
how they could easily reinvest if that
were the primary consideration.
What cannot be replaced, however,
is the power and control that the
current stronghold in South Africa
represents. First, control of a seaway
has become increasingly important as
the Suez Canal and the Horn of
Africa fall under socialist control.
Second, South Africa represents by
far the strongest military power on
the African continent. Witness the
South Africans recent role in An
gola and note the pressure they keep
on the so-called frontline states,
especially Zimbabwe. Third, it is
land of great mineral resources,
some of which are critical to the
"needs" of the "free world."
Jn our view, these are the primary
reasons that men of great wealth and
power feel the necessity to maintain
their ties, and hence their control, in
South Africa. The disenfranchised in
South Africa have much in common
with unemployed blacks in America
and with all decent-thinking people
committed to the struggle in South
Africa and elsewhere for self
determination and peace. They
represent the antithesis of the
geopoliticians and geo-economists
whose policies prop up the cruel and
immoral regime in South Africa as a
byproduct of their obsession to
maintain long-term control of the
area.
The appearance of a re-action but
no-action policy from the trustees
does not tell the whole story. Their
commitment to helping maintain
control of South Africa is so strong
that a serious consideration of
divestment will most likely coincide
with the time when Secretary of
State George Shultz converts his
home on campus into a left-wing
socialist think tank.
