## Investing in South Africa is immoral 
### 
Concerning divestment, it is
time for Stanford to make a sym
bolic move. It is time for Stanford
to think like a university, not like a
business.
Perhaps divestment will not
measurably alter most American
corporations' investment
practices. It does not matter. Pos
sibly a few South African blacks
will lose their jobs. It does not
matter. Probably many "sensible"
business people placing grant

VIEWPOINT

money into Stanford will snicker.
It does not matter. What matters is
that apartheid is patently the most
disgraceful practice of mankind
today. It is totally indefensible.
The argument that funds in
vested in South African corpora
tions can lead eventually to black
Africans' emancipation is cursory.
Further, investments in corpora
tions in South Africa do not per
form financially so well that they
in any way stand out as being par
ticularly desirable as far as profits
are concerned.
They are directly comparable to
nuclear power-related invest
ments. Because of their controver
sial societal impact, they are in fact
potentially unstable and, pru
dently viewed, suspect as appro
priate vehicles for Stanford invest
ment capital. Why, therefore,
should Stanford fight especially
hard to hold onto them?
America today abounds in
domestic investment opportunities
which go wanting capital because
they are not as theoretically
profitable as the business of
economically misusing an op
pressed racial minority as cheap
labor.
Stanford's arguments for not
divesting are almost all founded
on some sort of economic logic,
economic logic which is in and of
itself questionable. But even if it
were irrefutable — this is no time

for economic logic. This is not an
issue of logic. This is a moral ethi
cal issue. There is only one moral
and ethical solution.
Remove all funds from contact
with South Africa and place them
at the very least into ventures
which will not directly benefit
white South Africans.
After 300 years of capitalistic
development (based historically
and factually on planned oppres
sion by whites of non-whites all
the way back to English
dominated Barbados in the West
Indies, and the southern American
states in recent years) is it not time
that we whites and we business
men developed a more acute sense
of human responsibility?
Corporations and Stanford have
funds in South African-related
ventures to make profits. Profits
are not intrinsically evil. Profits
may, however, be made in a
myriad of other, far-less tainted
investments. And thereby a vital
moral message may be transmitted
to other academic institutions, to
corporate America, and to the
world. Would not the University's
fund directors prefer to be associ
ated with what is clearly a moral
right than with a morally contro
versial financial transaction?
As a long-time participant in
American business, and as a finan
cial investment adviser, I say there
are thousands of us who can show
Stanford more secure and poten
tially profitable places to stash the
University's excess cash — and
without it being stained by the
hypocritical, hateful, loveless,
loathsome, self-serving policies of
the oppressive South African
white minority.
It is time Stanford made that
symbolic move and put its money
where its morals and ethics right
fully deserve to be: anyplace but
in the morass of apartheid.
