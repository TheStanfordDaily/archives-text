## Avoid 'over-emotionalizing' divestment 
### 
Had the May 16 opinions column on the place of
intellectual evaluation in morality been written by
someone without Darieck Scott's characteristic elo
quence, or had he not framed this important issue
so clearly, I would not have been quite as dismayed
by the outcome. But this time I think he blew it.

VIEWPOINT

He says, "We are not discussing the efficacy of
divestment. We are discussing South African
families hiding in makeshift tin shacks and the
morality of Stanford's contribution to their plight."
I say the issue is not how bad their plight is — they
have already spent today in those tin shacks and
there's nothing we can do about that — but what
are Stanford's best options for helping to alleviate
their powerlessness. If anything, it seems to me that
the direness of their current situation only makes it
more incumbent on us to consider whether pro
posed actions will actually benefit those we seek to
help.
The only way I can see to avoid this conclusion is
to believe that our actions here will have no impact
on the South African situation — and Scott does
say, "1 am not sure I believe that Stanford's divest
ment from companies doing business in South
Africa will have any real effect on that regime."
Certainly, if the alternatives are simply to contrib
ute to an immoral situation or let someone else to

do it. we might well wash our hands of the problem.
But clearly Stanford Out of South Africa believes
that there's more at stake, and if we accept the pos
sibility of positive consequences, we must judge the
risks of negative ones as well. These might be very
small: Perhaps we would lose only University Pres
ident Kennedy's "very slim chance" for moral in
fluence as a corporation stockholder. But maybe
we'd have a bigger impact, in that collegiate divest
ment would lead American companies to pull out
of South Africa — possibly delaying the end of
apartheid by cutting into the growth of a black

union strike fund, as hypothesized by Political Sci
ence Prof. David Abernethy. Or maybe divestment
followed by American withdrawal would actually
hasten the end of apartheid — but via a bloody civil
war that kills many of the people hiding in those

tiny tin shacks. I'm not saying these contingencies
are likely or inevitable, but that they do demand
some attention in our thinking about divestment.
On the same opinions page. Donna Anderson
wrote, "Black South Africa tells us divestment is
the last and only viable solution," and earlier,
"what happens afterward must be left (to) them." I
don't see an attempt to avoid sparking widespread
bloodshed as "paternalistic and invalid"; on the
contrary, while the request for divestment from
(many sectors of) black South Africa is certainly
important evidence on their expectations of conse
quences (and their evaluations of those conse
quences), to allow that alone to settle the issue is, in
my opinion, to abdicate one's moral responsibility.
1 understand the urge to avoid "paralysis by
analysis"; we mustn't endlessly delay the better
while awaiting the perfect. But like all other in
stincts, our instinctive moral revulsion is used
primarily in situations of relatively low complexity,
which this is not. Until we have a clearer picture of
the likelihood of the various possible good and bad
consequences of divestment, I think there is much
greater danger of "over-emotionalizing" than
"over-intellectualizing" the issue; if you don't have
an answer for Kennedy and Abernethy, then it
seems to me you don't have an answer for divest
ment.
