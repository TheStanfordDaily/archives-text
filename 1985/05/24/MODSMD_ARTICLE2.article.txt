## University dedicates CIS 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
University officials and corporate
executives dedicated the $15 mil
lion Center for Integrated Systems
(CIS) yesterday afternoon amid
protests by Stanford Out of South
Africa (SOSA) members and other
students.
Between remarks by Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy and
Hewlett-Packard President John
Young to an audience of approxi
mately 250 people, about 30
protesters held up signs and
chanted "H-P out of South Africa"
and "You see investments, we see
apartheid!"
The demonstrators attended the
dedication ceremony outside the
newly constructed facility to protest
the project's industrial sponsors.
According to SOSA member Bill
Cohn, the protesters are concerned
that the companies sponsoring CIS
will "control to some extent the re
search being conducted."
The CIS building, comprising
80,000 square feet, will be used to

conduct research in computer sci
ence, communications and infor
mation science. At the heart of the
facility lies an integrated circuit
fabrication laboratory, covering
10,500 square feet.
The center is the result of a part
nership between the University, the
federal government and 20 indus
trial sponsors. Each industrial
sponsor donated $750,000 toward
the facility's construction.
Hewlett-Packard, Motorola
Corp., Digital Equipment Corp.
and IBM are four of the nine cor
porate sponsors of CIS now con
ducting business in South Africa,
according to Cohn.
Speakers at the CIS dedication
praised the joint venture of
academia, business and govern
ment. According to Young, the
center presents "our best chance of
continuing the American tradition
of technological innovation."
Young called technology, human
resources, capital accumulation and
trade policy the four necessities of
industrialized nations. Of these,

"only technology can be seen as a
comparative advantage for the
United States," he said.
"We're missing the transition
that moves innovations out of the
lab and into the marketplace,"
Young said. "The center is that
transition."
The center will steer funds
"towards those areas of inquiry
from which we can reap the
greatest rewards" and will "bring
us closer to realizing the full poten
tial of our technological brilliance,"
Young concluded.
Alter the dedication, protester
Matt Nicodemus noted that many
of the corporate sponsors of CIS
are also recipients of large
defense contracts.
"The administration seemed to
just focus on the socially beneficial
applications," Nicodemus said.
"They simply haven't spoken about
the other applications."
"In the future, we're going to be

investigating and publicizing certain
projects being done here at the center
and expose their connections with the
military, and through that to oppres
sion, such as apartheid." Nicodemus
said.
In his remarks at the dedication,
Kennedy said CIS "strikes me now as
a bold venture designed to lift us out
of two problems."
The first of these problems, accord
ing to Kennedy , is the lack of capital
available for scientific research and
facilities in the University. The
second is "the problem that has made
it such a sluggish process to bring sci
entific discoveries into the domain of
human service," he said.
Kennedy gave his "heartfelt
thanks" to the center's corporate
sponsors and expressed a desire to
reassure those concerned about the
center that the University concluded
"arrangements and agreements which
conform fully to this faculty's (the
University's) research policy."
At noon yesterday, SOSA mem
bers sponsored a teach-in in the Inner
Ouad on the potential for abuse of
computer technology.
According to Cohn, who also spoke
at the teach-in, computer technology
has enabled the South African gov
ernment to create a "tightly knit,
militarized state."
Freshman Irene Yen, a speaker at
the teach-in and a protester at the
CIS dedication, said corporate spon
sors of CIS want eventually to utilize
research done at Stanford for their
own benefit.
