Steve Tamari concludes his view
point, "The Israel-South Africa link"
(The Daily, May 21), by imploring
"those of us who consider divest
ment part of the struggle against
apartheid must not lose sight of the
international context of support for
the South African system." I agree.
That's why I'm baffled by the fact
that throughout Tamari's article only
one nation's support for South
Africa is analyzed.
What nation is so heinous in this
regard, that by focusing on it, we do
not lose sight of international con
text? Is it Japan — which has a total
trade volume with South Africa of
$3.84 billion? Is it Great Britain —
$3.81 billion? Is it Saudi Arabia —
which supplies 76 percent of South
Africa's oil, which perpetuates its
oppression of the black majority?
No, not one of these countries plays
a significant enough role in the

"survival of the white minority
regime in South Africa" to warrant
such special consideration.
Remarkably, the arch villain is Israel
— a nation with a total trade volume
with South Africa of $253 million;
that's 10 times less than the oil
diamonds exchange between the
Arab countries and South Africa.
Should Israel be condemned for its
relationship with South Africa? Yes!
Should the black African nations be
condemned for their relationship
with South Africa? Yes! Hence, the
question that Taman s article raises:
Who is audacious enough to write an
article on the "Zaire-South Africa
link" and pretend such analysis
illuminates our vision of "the inter
national context of support for South
Africa?" Answer: Someone bearing
a grudge against Zaire who finds, in
the important fight against apartheid,
an opportunity to lash Zaire.
