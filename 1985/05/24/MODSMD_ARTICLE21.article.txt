## An examination of the merits of divestment 
### 
Divestment — a reasonable strategy for
challenging white rule in South Africa or spit
ting into the wind? The issues— indeed lives
— at stake are too important to be buried in
the confusions of misunderstandings and mis
statements. In those confusions, people talk
past each other. Since those who favor selling
stocks and those who oppose the sale are
talking about different things, neither can

persuade the other. This debate is likely to
continue for a while. It is important,
therefore, to set aside some of the major con
fusions, and thus focus the discussion.
For a university to divest - sell stocks - has
two major purposes: education (of both our
selves and others) and pressure for change. Ul
timately, the primary focus of divesting stocks
of companies that operate in South Africa is
us: what we, as a university and a community,
will do to identify and challenge racism.
South Africa is a unique community. There,
racism is institutionalized. There are, of
course, other places where there is discrimi
nation. But in South Africa, the constitution,
laws, regulations and custom combine in a
society-wide web of racial differentiation and
subordination.
The focus of the current protest, then, is
apartheid, an umbrella term for the various

laws, rules and customs that constitute institu
tionalized racial discrimination. Apartheid is
not simply a matter of who uses which win
dow in the post office, or who rides which
train, or eats in which restaurant (though
those patterns of discrimination are neither
infrequent nor petty). Apartheid is also a
matter of poverty. What has been imposed
over the last century in South Africa is a strat
egy for mobilizing labor and immobilizing
people that impoverishes nearly 80 percent of
the population. To be black in South Africa is
to experience high rates of infant and mater
nal mortality, malnutrition, inferior schools,
insecure residential rights, irregular employ
ment and depressed wages. For many, death
precedes old age.
This is not simply another country whose
practices we find objectionable. South Africa
is a country where the oppression and ex
ploitation of a people is a matter of national
policy.
It is also a country whose practices are, in
essential ways, supported by foreign invest
ment and current U.S. government policy. As
the Senate Subcommittee on Africa reported
in 1978, "The net effect of American invest

ment has been to strengthen the economic
and military self-sufficiency of South Africa's
apartheid regime."
Most of us, 1 presume, share a revulsion at
apartheid. What to do? Why divestment?
After all, it is often pointed out that the South
African economy is relatively strong, unlikely
to collapse in the face of the withdrawal of
U.S. investments.
Quite so, but irrelevant. The goal of eco
nomic sanctions is not destruction, but libera
tion. Divestment is a strategy for promoting
change, not a cataclysm. Divestment is in
tended, in part, to press companies to curtail
and withdraw their operations in South
Africa, but it is absurd to anticipate dramatic,
large-scale, instantaneuous disinvestment.
Divestment applies increasing pressure on
companies to change their behavior. Changes
in companies' behavior in turn apply increas
ing pressure within South Africa, both against
the government and in support of those who
are the primary opponents of apartheid.
Changes occur long before massive disinvest
ment could be accomplished.
The impact of external economic pressure
on South Africa is clear. As many companies
themselves acknowledge, their commitment
to equal pay for equal work, their efforts to
desegregate cafeterias and toilets, their con
tributions to education funds for employees'
children, and the management training pro

grams are all responses to public outcry and
shareholders' challenges. Even the
employers' codes of conduct favored by oppo
nents of divestment are a response to earlier
pressures for divestment. These reforms, and
others, are modest, and for most South
Africans thus far inconsequential. But they do
demonstrate that external pressure can force
changes, and that as the pressures escalate, so
the changes are more substantial.
We should all be clear that external pres
sure, by itself, cannot reorganize power within
South Africa. South Africans must do that
themselves. But just as the international links
of white rule in South Africa enable it to
endure just a hit longer, so the disruption of
those links can reduce its staying power.
Foreign investors cannot, by themselves,
bring majority rule. But they can surely ac
celerate or delay it.
I hus the test of the utility of divestment is
its impact on events in South Africa — both
support for opponents of apartheid and pres
sure on the South African government — and
not either the likelihood that divestment by a
single institution will force total disinvest
ment. or the prospect that total disinvestment

will force change (since significant change will
long precede that).
Divestment is also a response to the re
quests of African leaders over a quarter cen
tury. Chief Albert Luthuli, Nobel Prize
winner and president of the African National
Congress, put it clearly 25 years ago: "The
economic boycott of South Africa will entail
undoubted hardships for Africans. We do not
doubt that. But if it is a method which shor
tens the day of blood, the suffering to us will
be a price we are willing to pay." Soweto
leader Dr. Nthato Motlana: "If 1 said that the
only way to bring change would be total eco
nomic sanctions, I would be liable to go to
jail. So let's just be cagey. Let's just say that I
support "pressures' and leave it at that." Most
recently. Bishop Desmond Tutu has been
similarly cautious, but equally clear.
There are, of course, South Africans, of all
races, who oppose divestment. So, indeed, in
the United States, there are blacks, chicanos
and women (including the chairman of the
U.S. Commission on Civil Rights) who say
that racial and sexual discrimination are not a
problem. There will always be people from
disadvantaged populations who are reluctant
to change and others who collaborate in their
own oppression. But the African leadership in
South Africa has been consistent and clear in
its message over a very long time: divest.
The case for divestment is strong, some
skeptics concede. But, they argue, selling the
shares of a few firms, whose behavior is par
ticulary objectionable, is preferable to total
divestment. A strategy of selective divest
ment, however, misses the point. What is at
issue is not the behavior of individual compan
ies or their managers, hut support for a society
wide system of institutionalized racial
discrimination and its consequences. It is not
the liberalism of the firms but the structure of
apartheid that must be challenged. To disas
sociate ourselves from a few unpleasant char
acters is to avoid assuming responsibility for
the perpetuation of apartheid.
I want to turn, alas all too briefly, to several
of the most common objections to divest
ment.
First, it is argued that divestment would be
very costly for a university. There is good
evidence now that institutional divestors need
suffer neither significantly higher transaction
costs nor significantly reduced return. A
phased divestment need not increase the
transactions for an actively managed
portfolio. Several South Africa-free portfolios
have shown rates of return equal to, or better
than, their pre-divestment experience. Al
though in theory any reduction in the list of
potential investments reduced the potential
overall rate of return, in practice the remain
ing available investment opportunities offer a
sufficient range for even the most successful
investors. Stanford might even chart the path
for effective divestment.
Second, it is claimed that divestment by
Stanford cannot really make any difference,
because others will quickly buy the shares. In
the short term, perhaps so. but that misses the
point. Divestment is a strategy of education
and pressure, and both of those occur regard
less of the behavior of other investors. Over
time, as the number of institutional divestors
increases, the pressure on the marketability of

target stocks becomes powerful pressure on
the companies involved.
A variant on this objection notes that if
U.S.-based firms withdraw from South
Africa, all that will change is the nationality of
the management. Again, that misses the
point. The departure of, say, General Motors,
from South Africa is powerful pressure,
regardless of whether or not another com
pany, or the South African government,
manages to continue production. In some sec
tors, especially energy and computers, U.S.
companies simply cannot easily be replaced.
Our responsibility is to terminate our support
for racism, even if others seem willing to carry
it on.

Divestment is intended, in part, to press
companies to curtail and withdraw their
operations in South Africa, but it is absurd to
anticipate dramatic, large-scale, instantaneous
disinvestment.

Third, it is argued that industrialization in
general, and thus foreign investment, is cor
rosive of racism. The claim is that economic
development, by its very nature, will un
dermine apartheid, and that, therefore, there
should be more investment, not less. This
claim, often advanced by apologists for apart
heid. is quite at odds with South African his
tory. The economic development that has in
the 20th century provided to white South
Africans incomes that are among the highest
in the world has been achieved by. not in op
position to, racial discrimination. Whatever
erosion of apartheid has occurred stems not
from the enlightened foresight of even the
profit motive of corporate management, but
rather from militant opposition by South
Africans.
Fourth, there is the claim that divestment, if
it produced withdrawal of foreign investment,
would hurt African workers. In part, to the
extent that disinvestment occurs, that is cor
rect: Economic contraction would displace
some workers. But it is also the case that dis
investment by U.S. companies is likely to
have a more rabid impact on the vitality of the
South African economy than of the African
labor force. U.S. firms employ relatively few
South Afridan workers (the largest single cat
egory of African wage and salaried labor in
South Africa is domestic service). Recall that
we arc talking about increasing pressure, not
cataclysmic withdrawal. It is reasonable to ex
pect many changes to occur long before a sig
nificant displacement of the African work
force.
Fifth, might not insisting on employers'
codes of conduct, like the Sullivan Principles,
achieve more rapid progress? Here, too, the
evidence is clear. The voluntary code of em

ployment practice developed by Rev. Leon
Sullivan in 1976, itself weaker than compara
ble codes, has been signed by approximately
one-third of the U.S. companies that operate
in South Africa. Regular reviews show, at
best, only partial compliance. An overall
comparison reveals little to distinguish the
workplace practices of the signatories from
those of the non-signers. These codes offer a
convenient smoksecreen, permitting compan
ies to proclaim their virtuous behavior while
changing little. None of the codes demands
change in the basic stucture of apartheid.
Thus, they all direct attention away from insti
tutionalized racism and its consequences and
toward the behavior of its practioners.

Finally, there is the claim that if the Univer
sity were to divest, it would lose leverage with
the companies involved. Not so. There is here
a misplaced analogy. If divestment were like
resignation, it would be a once-and-for-all
commitment, perhaps dramatic, but with little
subsequent influence. But divestment is not a
resignation, but a boycott. Just as consumers
might announce to their supermarket, dives
tors say to the companies, "We are not willing
to do business with you as long as you main
tain your current practices." That provides a
continuing incentive for change. As well, there
is simply no convincing evidence that we have
used our leverage as investors to promote
change in South A frica.
This brings us back to the starting point.
Divestment at its most immediate is aimed at
us, as a university and community. The
process of divestment involves us in an educa
tional effort whose benefits can be substan
tial.
At the next level, divestment is aimed at
joining with others in applying increasing
pressure to challenge institutionalized dis
crimination in South Africa. Over time, South
Africans will themselves determine their own
future. Our choice is between assisting pro
gressive change or getting in its way. Our
challenge is to improve the quality of our own
lives by making the attack on racism a very
high priority.
Rather than being troubled by the loud
noises, forceful protests and acerbic language
of the divestment movement, we should be
embarrassed by our own inactivity.

ment, however, misses the point. What is at
issue is not the behavior of individual compan
ies or their managers, hut support for a society
wide system of institutionalized racial
discrimination and its consequences. It is not
the liberalism of the firms but the structure of
apartheid that must be challenged. To disas
sociate ourselves from a few unpleasant char
acters is to avoid assuming responsibility for
the perpetuation of apartheid.
I want to turn, alas all too briefly, to several
of the most common objections to divest
ment.
First, it is argued that divestment would be
very costly for a university. There is good
evidence now that institutional divestors need
suffer neither significantly higher transaction
costs nor significantly reduced return. A
phased divestment need not increase the
transactions for an actively managed
portfolio. Several South Africa-free portfolios
have shown rates of return equal to, or better
than, their pre-divestment experience. Al
though in theory any reduction in the list of
potential investments reduced the potential
overall rate of return, in practice the remain
ing available investment opportunities offer a
sufficient range for even the most successful
investors. Stanford might even chart the path
for effective divestment.
Second, it is claimed that divestment by
Stanford cannot really make any difference,
because others will quickly buy the shares. In
the short term, perhaps so. but that misses the
point. Divestment is a strategy of education
and pressure, and both of those occur regard
less of the behavior of other investors. Over
time, as the number of institutional divestors
increases, the pressure on the marketability of

target stocks becomes powerful pressure on
the companies involved.
A variant on this objection notes that if
U.S.-based firms withdraw from South
Africa, all that will change is the nationality of
the management. Again, that misses the
point. The departure of, say, General Motors,
from South Africa is powerful pressure,
regardless of whether or not another com
pany, or the South African government,
manages to continue production. In some sec
tors, especially energy and computers, U.S.
companies simply cannot easily be replaced.
Our responsibility is to terminate our support
for racism, even if others seem willing to carry
it on.

Divestment is intended, in part, to press
companies to curtail and withdraw their
operations in South Africa, but it is absurd to
anticipate dramatic, large-scale, instantaneous
disinvestment.

Third, it is argued that industrialization in
general, and thus foreign investment, is cor
rosive of racism. The claim is that economic
development, by its very nature, will un
dermine apartheid, and that, therefore, there
should be more investment, not less. This
claim, often advanced by apologists for apart
heid. is quite at odds with South African his
tory. The economic development that has in
the 20th century provided to white South
Africans incomes that are among the highest
in the world has been achieved by. not in op
position to, racial discrimination. Whatever
erosion of apartheid has occurred stems not
from the enlightened foresight of even the
profit motive of corporate management, but
rather from militant opposition by South
Africans.
Fourth, there is the claim that divestment, if
it produced withdrawal of foreign investment,
would hurt African workers. In part, to the
extent that disinvestment occurs, that is cor
rect: Economic contraction would displace
some workers. But it is also the case that dis
investment by U.S. companies is likely to
have a more rabid impact on the vitality of the
South African economy than of the African
labor force. U.S. firms employ relatively few
South Afridan workers (the largest single cat
egory of African wage and salaried labor in
South Africa is domestic service). Recall that
we arc talking about increasing pressure, not
cataclysmic withdrawal. It is reasonable to ex
pect many changes to occur long before a sig
nificant displacement of the African work
force.
Fifth, might not insisting on employers'
codes of conduct, like the Sullivan Principles,
achieve more rapid progress? Here, too, the
evidence is clear. The voluntary code of em

ployment practice developed by Rev. Leon
Sullivan in 1976, itself weaker than compara
ble codes, has been signed by approximately
one-third of the U.S. companies that operate
in South Africa. Regular reviews show, at
best, only partial compliance. An overall
comparison reveals little to distinguish the
workplace practices of the signatories from
those of the non-signers. These codes offer a
convenient smoksecreen, permitting compan
ies to proclaim their virtuous behavior while
changing little. None of the codes demands
change in the basic stucture of apartheid.
Thus, they all direct attention away from insti
tutionalized racism and its consequences and
toward the behavior of its practioners.

Finally, there is the claim that if the Univer
sity were to divest, it would lose leverage with
the companies involved. Not so. There is here
a misplaced analogy. If divestment were like
resignation, it would be a once-and-for-all
commitment, perhaps dramatic, but with little
subsequent influence. But divestment is not a
resignation, but a boycott. Just as consumers
might announce to their supermarket, dives
tors say to the companies, "We are not willing
to do business with you as long as you main
tain your current practices." That provides a
continuing incentive for change. As well, there
is simply no convincing evidence that we have
used our leverage as investors to promote
change in South A frica.
This brings us back to the starting point.
Divestment at its most immediate is aimed at
us, as a university and community. The
process of divestment involves us in an educa
tional effort whose benefits can be substan
tial.
At the next level, divestment is aimed at
joining with others in applying increasing
pressure to challenge institutionalized dis
crimination in South Africa. Over time, South
Africans will themselves determine their own
future. Our choice is between assisting pro
gressive change or getting in its way. Our
challenge is to improve the quality of our own
lives by making the attack on racism a very
high priority.
Rather than being troubled by the loud
noises, forceful protests and acerbic language
of the divestment movement, we should be
embarrassed by our own inactivity.

persuade the other. This debate is likely to
continue for a while. It is important,
therefore, to set aside some of the major con
fusions, and thus focus the discussion.
For a university to divest - sell stocks - has
two major purposes: education (of both our
selves and others) and pressure for change. Ul
timately, the primary focus of divesting stocks
of companies that operate in South Africa is
us: what we, as a university and a community,
will do to identify and challenge racism.
South Africa is a unique community. There,
racism is institutionalized. There are, of
course, other places where there is discrimi
nation. But in South Africa, the constitution,
laws, regulations and custom combine in a
society-wide web of racial differentiation and
subordination.
The focus of the current protest, then, is
apartheid, an umbrella term for the various

which train, or eats in which restaurant.
Apartheid is also a matter of poverty.

laws, rules and customs that constitute institu
tionalized racial discrimination. Apartheid is
not simply a matter of who uses which win
dow in the post office, or who rides which
train, or eats in which restaurant (though
those patterns of discrimination are neither
infrequent nor petty). Apartheid is also a
matter of poverty. What has been imposed
over the last century in South Africa is a strat
egy for mobilizing labor and immobilizing
people that impoverishes nearly 80 percent of
the population. To be black in South Africa is
to experience high rates of infant and mater
nal mortality, malnutrition, inferior schools,
insecure residential rights, irregular employ
ment and depressed wages. For many, death
precedes old age.
This is not simply another country whose
practices we find objectionable. South Africa
is a country where the oppression and ex
ploitation of a people is a matter of national
policy.
It is also a country whose practices are, in
essential ways, supported by foreign invest
ment and current U.S. government policy. As
the Senate Subcommittee on Africa reported
in 1978, "The net effect of American invest

ment has been to strengthen the economic
and military self-sufficiency of South Africa's
apartheid regime."
Most of us, 1 presume, share a revulsion at
apartheid. What to do? Why divestment?
After all, it is often pointed out that the South
African economy is relatively strong, unlikely
to collapse in the face of the withdrawal of
U.S. investments.
Quite so, but irrelevant. The goal of eco
nomic sanctions is not destruction, but libera
tion. Divestment is a strategy for promoting
change, not a cataclysm. Divestment is in
tended, in part, to press companies to curtail
and withdraw their operations in South
Africa, but it is absurd to anticipate dramatic,
large-scale, instantaneuous disinvestment.
Divestment applies increasing pressure on
companies to change their behavior. Changes
in companies' behavior in turn apply increas
ing pressure within South Africa, both against
the government and in support of those who
are the primary opponents of apartheid.
Changes occur long before massive disinvest
ment could be accomplished.
The impact of external economic pressure
on South Africa is clear. As many companies
themselves acknowledge, their commitment
to equal pay for equal work, their efforts to
desegregate cafeterias and toilets, their con
tributions to education funds for employees'
children, and the management training pro

grams are all responses to public outcry and
shareholders' challenges. Even the
employers' codes of conduct favored by oppo
nents of divestment are a response to earlier
pressures for divestment. These reforms, and
others, are modest, and for most South
Africans thus far inconsequential. But they do
demonstrate that external pressure can force
changes, and that as the pressures escalate, so
the changes are more substantial.
We should all be clear that external pres
sure, by itself, cannot reorganize power within
South Africa. South Africans must do that
themselves. But just as the international links
of white rule in South Africa enable it to
endure just a hit longer, so the disruption of
those links can reduce its staying power.
Foreign investors cannot, by themselves,
bring majority rule. But they can surely ac
celerate or delay it.
I hus the test of the utility of divestment is
its impact on events in South Africa — both
support for opponents of apartheid and pres
sure on the South African government — and
not either the likelihood that divestment by a
single institution will force total disinvest
ment. or the prospect that total disinvestment

will force change (since significant change will
long precede that).
Divestment is also a response to the re
quests of African leaders over a quarter cen
tury. Chief Albert Luthuli, Nobel Prize
winner and president of the African National
Congress, put it clearly 25 years ago: "The
economic boycott of South Africa will entail
undoubted hardships for Africans. We do not
doubt that. But if it is a method which shor
tens the day of blood, the suffering to us will
be a price we are willing to pay." Soweto
leader Dr. Nthato Motlana: "If 1 said that the
only way to bring change would be total eco
nomic sanctions, I would be liable to go to
jail. So let's just be cagey. Let's just say that I
support "pressures' and leave it at that." Most
recently. Bishop Desmond Tutu has been
similarly cautious, but equally clear.
There are, of course, South Africans, of all
races, who oppose divestment. So, indeed, in
the United States, there are blacks, chicanos
and women (including the chairman of the
U.S. Commission on Civil Rights) who say
that racial and sexual discrimination are not a
problem. There will always be people from
disadvantaged populations who are reluctant
to change and others who collaborate in their
own oppression. But the African leadership in
South Africa has been consistent and clear in
its message over a very long time: divest.
The case for divestment is strong, some
skeptics concede. But, they argue, selling the
shares of a few firms, whose behavior is par
ticulary objectionable, is preferable to total
divestment. A strategy of selective divest
ment, however, misses the point. What is at
issue is not the behavior of individual compan
ies or their managers, hut support for a society
wide system of institutionalized racial
discrimination and its consequences. It is not
the liberalism of the firms but the structure of
apartheid that must be challenged. To disas

persuade the other. This debate is likely to
continue for a while. It is important,
therefore, to set aside some of the major con
fusions, and thus focus the discussion.
For a university to divest - sell stocks - has
two major purposes: education (of both our
selves and others) and pressure for change. Ul
timately, the primary focus of divesting stocks
of companies that operate in South Africa is
us: what we, as a university and a community,
will do to identify and challenge racism.
South Africa is a unique community. There,
racism is institutionalized. There are, of
course, other places where there is discrimi
nation. But in South Africa, the constitution,
laws, regulations and custom combine in a
society-wide web of racial differentiation and
subordination.
The focus of the current protest, then, is
apartheid, an umbrella term for the various

Apartheid is also a matter of poverty.

laws, rules and customs that constitute institu
tionalized racial discrimination. Apartheid is
not simply a matter of who uses which win
dow in the post office, or who rides which
train, or eats in which restaurant (though
those patterns of discrimination are neither
infrequent nor petty). Apartheid is also a
matter of poverty. What has been imposed
over the last century in South Africa is a strat
egy for mobilizing labor and immobilizing
people that impoverishes nearly 80 percent of
the population. To be black in South Africa is
to experience high rates of infant and mater
nal mortality, malnutrition, inferior schools,
insecure residential rights, irregular employ
ment and depressed wages. For many, death
precedes old age.
This is not simply another country whose
practices we find objectionable. South Africa
is a country where the oppression and ex
ploitation of a people is a matter of national
policy.
It is also a country whose practices are, in
essential ways, supported by foreign invest
ment and current U.S. government policy. As
the Senate Subcommittee on Africa reported
in 1978, "The net effect of American invest

ment has been to strengthen the economic
and military self-sufficiency of South Africa's
apartheid regime."
Most of us, 1 presume, share a revulsion at
apartheid. What to do? Why divestment?
After all, it is often pointed out that the South
African economy is relatively strong, unlikely
to collapse in the face of the withdrawal of
U.S. investments.
Quite so, but irrelevant. The goal of eco
nomic sanctions is not destruction, but libera
tion. Divestment is a strategy for promoting
change, not a cataclysm. Divestment is in
tended, in part, to press companies to curtail
and withdraw their operations in South
Africa, but it is absurd to anticipate dramatic,
large-scale, instantaneuous disinvestment.
Divestment applies increasing pressure on
companies to change their behavior. Changes
in companies' behavior in turn apply increas
ing pressure within South Africa, both against
the government and in support of those who
are the primary opponents of apartheid.
Changes occur long before massive disinvest
ment could be accomplished.
The impact of external economic pressure
on South Africa is clear. As many companies
themselves acknowledge, their commitment
to equal pay for equal work, their efforts to
desegregate cafeterias and toilets, their con
tributions to education funds for employees'
children, and the management training pro

grams are all responses to public outcry and
shareholders' challenges. Even the
employers' codes of conduct favored by oppo
nents of divestment are a response to earlier
pressures for divestment. These reforms, and
others, are modest, and for most South
Africans thus far inconsequential. But they do
demonstrate that external pressure can force
changes, and that as the pressures escalate, so
the changes are more substantial.
We should all be clear that external pres
sure, by itself, cannot reorganize power within
South Africa. South Africans must do that
themselves. But just as the international links
of white rule in South Africa enable it to
endure just a hit longer, so the disruption of
those links can reduce its staying power.
Foreign investors cannot, by themselves,
bring majority rule. But they can surely ac
celerate or delay it.
I hus the test of the utility of divestment is
its impact on events in South Africa — both
support for opponents of apartheid and pres
sure on the South African government — and
not either the likelihood that divestment by a
single institution will force total disinvest
ment. or the prospect that total disinvestment

will force change (since significant change will
long precede that).
Divestment is also a response to the re
quests of African leaders over a quarter cen
tury. Chief Albert Luthuli, Nobel Prize
winner and president of the African National
Congress, put it clearly 25 years ago: "The
economic boycott of South Africa will entail
undoubted hardships for Africans. We do not
doubt that. But if it is a method which shor
tens the day of blood, the suffering to us will
be a price we are willing to pay." Soweto
leader Dr. Nthato Motlana: "If 1 said that the
only way to bring change would be total eco
nomic sanctions, I would be liable to go to
jail. So let's just be cagey. Let's just say that I
support "pressures' and leave it at that." Most
recently. Bishop Desmond Tutu has been
similarly cautious, but equally clear.
There are, of course, South Africans, of all
races, who oppose divestment. So, indeed, in
the United States, there are blacks, chicanos
and women (including the chairman of the
U.S. Commission on Civil Rights) who say
that racial and sexual discrimination are not a
problem. There will always be people from
disadvantaged populations who are reluctant
to change and others who collaborate in their
own oppression. But the African leadership in
South Africa has been consistent and clear in
its message over a very long time: divest.
The case for divestment is strong, some
skeptics concede. But, they argue, selling the
shares of a few firms, whose behavior is par
ticulary objectionable, is preferable to total
divestment. A strategy of selective divest
ment, however, misses the point. What is at
issue is not the behavior of individual compan
ies or their managers, hut support for a society
wide system of institutionalized racial
discrimination and its consequences. It is not
the liberalism of the firms but the structure of
apartheid that must be challenged. To disas
sociate ourselves from a few unpleasant char
acters is to avoid assuming responsibility for
the perpetuation of apartheid.
I want to turn, alas all too briefly, to several
of the most common objections to divest
ment.
First, it is argued that divestment would be
very costly for a university. There is good
evidence now that institutional divestors need
suffer neither significantly higher transaction
costs nor significantly reduced return. A
phased divestment need not increase the
transactions for an actively managed
portfolio. Several South Africa-free portfolios
have shown rates of return equal to, or better
than, their pre-divestment experience. Al
though in theory any reduction in the list of
potential investments reduced the potential
overall rate of return, in practice the remain
ing available investment opportunities offer a
sufficient range for even the most successful
investors. Stanford might even chart the path
for effective divestment.
Second, it is claimed that divestment by
Stanford cannot really make any difference,
because others will quickly buy the shares. In
the short term, perhaps so. but that misses the
point. Divestment is a strategy of education
and pressure, and both of those occur regard
less of the behavior of other investors. Over
time, as the number of institutional divestors
increases, the pressure on the marketability of

target stocks becomes powerful pressure on
the companies involved.
A variant on this objection notes that if
U.S.-based firms withdraw from South
Africa, all that will change is the nationality of
the management. Again, that misses the
point. The departure of, say, General Motors,
from South Africa is powerful pressure,
regardless of whether or not another com
pany, or the South African government,
manages to continue production. In some sec
tors, especially energy and computers, U.S.
companies simply cannot easily be replaced.
Our responsibility is to terminate our support
for racism, even if others seem willing to carry
it on.

Divestment is intended, in part, to press
companies to curtail and withdraw their
operations in South Africa, but it is absurd to
anticipate dramatic, large-scale, instantaneous
disinvestment.

Third, it is argued that industrialization in
general, and thus foreign investment, is cor
rosive of racism. The claim is that economic
development, by its very nature, will un
dermine apartheid, and that, therefore, there
should be more investment, not less. This
claim, often advanced by apologists for apart
heid. is quite at odds with South African his
tory. The economic development that has in
the 20th century provided to white South
Africans incomes that are among the highest
in the world has been achieved by. not in op
position to, racial discrimination. Whatever
erosion of apartheid has occurred stems not
from the enlightened foresight of even the
profit motive of corporate management, but
rather from militant opposition by South
Africans.
Fourth, there is the claim that divestment, if
it produced withdrawal of foreign investment,
would hurt African workers. In part, to the
extent that disinvestment occurs, that is cor
rect: Economic contraction would displace
some workers. But it is also the case that dis
investment by U.S. companies is likely to
have a more rabid impact on the vitality of the
South African economy than of the African
labor force. U.S. firms employ relatively few
South Afridan workers (the largest single cat
egory of African wage and salaried labor in
South Africa is domestic service). Recall that
we arc talking about increasing pressure, not
cataclysmic withdrawal. It is reasonable to ex
pect many changes to occur long before a sig
nificant displacement of the African work
force.
Fifth, might not insisting on employers'
codes of conduct, like the Sullivan Principles,
achieve more rapid progress? Here, too, the
evidence is clear. The voluntary code of em

ployment practice developed by Rev. Leon
Sullivan in 1976, itself weaker than compara
ble codes, has been signed by approximately
one-third of the U.S. companies that operate
in South Africa. Regular reviews show, at
best, only partial compliance. An overall
comparison reveals little to distinguish the
workplace practices of the signatories from
those of the non-signers. These codes offer a
convenient smoksecreen, permitting compan
ies to proclaim their virtuous behavior while
changing little. None of the codes demands
change in the basic stucture of apartheid.
Thus, they all direct attention away from insti
tutionalized racism and its consequences and
toward the behavior of its practioners.

Finally, there is the claim that if the Univer
sity were to divest, it would lose leverage with
the companies involved. Not so. There is here
a misplaced analogy. If divestment were like
resignation, it would be a once-and-for-all
commitment, perhaps dramatic, but with little
subsequent influence. But divestment is not a
resignation, but a boycott. Just as consumers
might announce to their supermarket, dives
tors say to the companies, "We are not willing
to do business with you as long as you main
tain your current practices." That provides a
continuing incentive for change. As well, there
is simply no convincing evidence that we have
used our leverage as investors to promote
change in South A frica.
This brings us back to the starting point.
Divestment at its most immediate is aimed at
us, as a university and community. The
process of divestment involves us in an educa
tional effort whose benefits can be substan
tial.
At the next level, divestment is aimed at
joining with others in applying increasing
pressure to challenge institutionalized dis
crimination in South Africa. Over time, South
Africans will themselves determine their own
future. Our choice is between assisting pro
gressive change or getting in its way. Our
challenge is to improve the quality of our own
lives by making the attack on racism a very
high priority.
Rather than being troubled by the loud
noises, forceful protests and acerbic language
of the divestment movement, we should be
embarrassed by our own inactivity.

Divestment — a reasonable strategy for
challenging white rule in South Africa or spit
ting into the wind? The issues— indeed lives
— at stake are too important to be buried in
the confusions of misunderstandings and mis

past each other. Since those who favor selling
