## Regional starts at Sunken Diamond Stanford is favorite 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford baseball team begins
its quest for its second College World
Series berth in the last three years
when it hosts the NCAA West I
Regional beginning today.
No. 9 Pepperdine, No. 20 Ne
braska and No. 29 Oregon State will
be the teams trying to deny second
ranked Stanford a trip to Omaha. In
today's opening games, the Waves
will play the Cornhuskers at 11 a.m.,
with the Cardinal taking on the
Beavers at 3:30 p.m.
Stanford hosted a regional in 1983
and moved quickly into the Series,
beating Oregon State, San Diego
State and UC-Santa Barbara on its
way to Omaha.
Playing at Sunken Diamond will
definitely be an advantage for the
Cardinal, according to Pepperdine
Coach Dave Gorrie. "They'll have
familiarity with the playing surface
and the home crowd behind them,"
Gorrie said. "And they'll be sleeping
in their own beds."
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
doesn't think the home field advan
tage will be that great. "It's an advan
tage because of the surroundings, but
field-wise I don't think it is."
A friendly atmosphere may give
the Cardinal an edge this weekend,
but make no mistake about it — this
team doesn't need much help. Pep
perdine has fine pitching and a great
defense, Nebraska's hitters tear the
cover off the ball and Oregon State
has been hot lately, but Stanford's
potent blend of offense, defense and
pitching make it the team to beat.
Any discussion of the Cardinal at
tack begins with Rick Lundblade.
The senior first baseman has belted

24 homers and driven in 83 runs to go
with his .409 batting average, a per
formance that earned him Player of
the Year honors in the Pacific 10
Southern Division.
The 83 RBIs are a Stanford single
season record, and Lundblade's 41
career home runs are also the best in
Cardinal history. Lundblade has also
scored 71 times and stolen 17 bases
— not bad for a 6-foot-5, 230-
pounder.
Lundblade's numbers would have
carried most offenses, but Stanford
has gotten production from its entire
lineup this year. Mark Davis, the All
Six-Pac centerfielder, is right behind
Lundblade in most offensive
categories, including average (.360),
runs (69) and homers (13).
The Cardinal has also gotten signif
icant contributions from Pete
Stanicek (.353, 66 runs), Walt Harris
(.332), John Ramos (.309, 62 RBIs),
Toi Cook (.308), John Verducci
(.296, 53 RBIs), Mike Deßenon
(.291) and Ruben Amaro (.290, 55
runs).
A good defensive team is always
strong up the middle, and Stanford
certainly is. Catcher Ramos has only
allowed six steals in the last 19 games.
In second baseman Stanicek and
shortstop Verducci, both All Six-Pac
choices, the Cardinal boasts what
Marquess calls "(possibly) the best
combination in college baseball."
Stanford's pitching staff is
anchored by senior Jeff Ballard.
Ballard is 12-2 this year with a 3.28
ERA. He is the Cardinal's all-time
leader in wins, innings pitched and
strikeouts. "He's our ace — the guy
who starts the first game of every se

ries," Marquess said.
Fireballing freshman Jack
McDowell (10-4, 4.31 ERA) and
sophomore Rob Wassenaar (9-2,
5.92) make up the other two-thirds of
the Cardinal rotation. When the
starters get in trouble, Marquess
turns the ball over to the capable

arms of middle reliever Lee Plemel
(5-1, 4.78) and late-inning stopper
Rick Dietz (5-1, 2.30, 8 saves).
"Stanford does not beat itself.
They don't give you anything,"
Oregon State Coach Jack Riley said.
The regional's double-elimination
format could require a team to play
live games this weekend, putting a lot
of pressure on the pitching staff. Bal
lard will pitch today and McDowell
will throw tomorrow, but what hap
pens after that is anyone's guess.

McDowell (10-4, 4.31 ERA) and
sophomore Rob Wassenaar (9-2,
5.92) make up the other two-thirds of
the Cardinal rotation. When the
starters get in trouble, Marquess
turns the ball over to the capable

arms of middle reliever Lee Plemel
(5-1, 4.78) and late-inning stopper
Rick Dietz (5-1, 2.30, 8 saves).
"Stanford does not beat itself.
They don't give you anything,"
Oregon State Coach Jack Riley said.
The regional's double-elimination
format could require a team to play
live games this weekend, putting a lot
of pressure on the pitching staff. Bal
lard will pitch today and McDowell
will throw tomorrow, but what hap
pens after that is anyone's guess.
