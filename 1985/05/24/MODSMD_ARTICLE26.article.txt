# Waves are threat
## 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
Although Stanford is the favorite
to win this weekend's NCAA West I
Regional and advance to the College
World Series, the Cardinal is by no
means a shoo-in to get to Omaha.
Standing between Stanford and a
Series berth are Pacific 10 Northern
Divsion titlist Oregon State, West
Coast Athletic Conference champion
Pepperdine and third-place Big Eight
Conference finisher Nebraska.
All three of Stanford's opponents
are nationally ranked. Pepperdine.
which has been as high as fourth in
the polls, is now No. 9. Nebraska is
currently No. 20, and Oregon State is
ranked 29th.
The Beavers, who beat Washington
and Washington State last weekend
to win the conference tournament of
the Northern Division, may be over
matched this time. As Oregon State
Coach Jack Riley said bluntly, "We
know we're an underdog."
Riley brought the Beavers to
Sunken Diamond two years ago, and
like this year, the Cardinal was their
first-game opponent. It was a day
Riley would just as soon forget, as his
team was pounded by Stanford 14-0.
However, to count Oregon State
out completely would probably be a
mistake. The Beavers have played
their best baseball this year in tourna
ments. In addition to winning the
Northern Division tourney, Oregon
State captured the Riverside Col
legiate Baseball Invitational.
In the Riverside tournament, OSU
took two games from San Diego
State, beat UCLA 14-6 and thrashed
Arizona State 14-2. "It was quite an
accomplishment for our young team

to go through (the tournament) unde
feated." Riley said.
The ace of the OSU pitching staff is
John Sipple, who is 10-1 with a 4.05
ERA. Sipple will pitch today against
Stanford.
Offensively, the Beavers are led by
first baseman Dave Brundage's .369
average. In addition to Brundage,
OSU has five players batting over
.330. As a team, the Beavers are hit
ting .313.
"We've been a streak hitting team
this year," Riley said. He won't get an
argument from anyone at Chico
State, whom the Beavers clobbered
36-12 this year.
Like OSU. Nebraska is a streak
hitting team. The Cornhuskers, 44-
22, are currently on a 66-game hut
streak. They are hitting .324 as a
team and are averaging 10 runs per
game.
Mike Duncan, the Cornhusker first
baseman, has what could best be des
cribed as Rick Lundblade-like statis
tics — a .404 batting average, 14
home runs and 8N RBIs.
Outfielder Paul Meyers has some
pretty impressive numbers as well.
He is hitting .399 with 77 RBIs. Like
Duncan, he has 14 homers. Catcher
Mark Kister is Nebraska's third
leading hitter, with a comparatively
paltry .370 average.
However, when asked to name his
team's greatest strength. Coach John
Sanders did not choose offense. "It's
our competitiveness — the intan
gibles," he said. "It's our ability to
cope and mental toughness."
The Cornhuskers' toughness comes
from what Sanders called
"courageous" scheduling. Others
might call it suicidal. In addition to
playing a difficult Big Eight schedule,
including No. 1 Oklahoma State and
No. 10 Oklahoma, Nebraska made an
early season road trip west for games
against San Diego State, Arizona
State, New Mexico and Nevada-Las
Vegas.
Sanders hopes that his pitching
staff and defense can keep the
Cornhuskers close enough to let the
offense pull it out. "The key will be to
have reasonable pitching and
reasonable defense," he said. "We
should score some runs."
Jeff Mays (8-1, 4.95 ERA) will try
to be reasonable today against Pep
perdine, with Mike Dobbs (6-1, 4.29)
pitching tomorrow.
Assessing the regional, Stanford
shortstop John Verducci said, "With
an unknown quantity like Nebraska,
you don't know what to expect."
He may not know much about the

Cornhuskers, but Verducci is
definitely aware of the Waves. "We
know Pepperdine is good," he said.
"They're probably the team we're
thinking about most."
Like Stanford, Pepperdine's bal
ance is its main asset. "We've got a
good blend of offense and defense,"
Coach Dave Gorrie said. "We played
well defensively, we hit well and we
ran the bases well."
Gorrie was right on all counts. The
Waves' .975 fielding percentage is the
nation's second best, trailing only
Michigan's. Pepperdine's top hitter is
Brad Bierley, who has a .359 average,
26 homers and 72 RBIs.
Other hard-hitting Waves include
Paul Farles (.345), Steve Kirkpatrick
(.335) and Steve Erickson (.332).
Pepperdine also stole 179 bases.
When listing his team's strengths,
Gorrie forgot to mention his out
standing pitching staff, led by Scott
Marrett. Marrett is 14-0 this year and
has a 1.98 ERA. He usually finishes
what he starts, with 10 complete
games.

ance is its main asset. "We've got a
good blend of offense and defense,"
Coach Dave Gorrie said. "We played
well defensively, we hit well and we
ran the bases well."
Gorrie was right on all counts. The
Waves' .975 fielding percentage is the
nation's second best, trailing only
Michigan's. Pepperdine's top hitter is
Brad Bierley, who has a .359 average,
26 homers and 72 RBIs.
Other hard-hitting Waves include
Paul Farles (.345), Steve Kirkpatrick
(.335) and Steve Erickson (.332).
Pepperdine also stole 179 bases.
When listing his team's strengths,
Gorrie forgot to mention his out
standing pitching staff, led by Scott
Marrett. Marrett is 14-0 this year and
has a 1.98 ERA. He usually finishes
what he starts, with 10 complete
games.
Although Stanford is the favorite
to win this weekend's NCAA West I
Regional and advance to the College
World Series, the Cardinal is by no
means a shoo-in to get to Omaha.
Standing between Stanford and a
Series berth are Pacific 10 Northern
Divsion titlist Oregon State, West
Coast Athletic Conference champion
Pepperdine and third-place Big Eight
Conference finisher Nebraska.
All three of Stanford's opponents
are nationally ranked. Pepperdine.
which has been as high as fourth in
the polls, is now No. 9. Nebraska is
currently No. 20, and Oregon State is
ranked 29th.
The Beavers, who beat Washington
and Washington State last weekend
to win the conference tournament of
the Northern Division, may be over
matched this time. As Oregon State
Coach Jack Riley said bluntly, "We
know we're an underdog."
Riley brought the Beavers to
Sunken Diamond two years ago, and
like this year, the Cardinal was their
first-game opponent. It was a day
Riley would just as soon forget, as his
team was pounded by Stanford 14-0.
However, to count Oregon State
out completely would probably be a
mistake. The Beavers have played
their best baseball this year in tourna
ments. In addition to winning the
Northern Division tourney, Oregon
State captured the Riverside Col
legiate Baseball Invitational.
In the Riverside tournament, OSU
took two games from San Diego
State, beat UCLA 14-6 and thrashed
Arizona State 14-2. "It was quite an
accomplishment for our young team

to go through (the tournament) unde
feated." Riley said.
The ace of the OSU pitching staff is
John Sipple, who is 10-1 with a 4.05
ERA. Sipple will pitch today against
Stanford.
Offensively, the Beavers are led by
first baseman Dave Brundage's .369
average. In addition to Brundage,
OSU has five players batting over
.330. As a team, the Beavers are hit
ting .313.
"We've been a streak hitting team
this year," Riley said. He won't get an
argument from anyone at Chico
State, whom the Beavers clobbered
36-12 this year.
Like OSU. Nebraska is a streak
hitting team. The Cornhuskers, 44-
22, are currently on a 66-game hut
streak. They are hitting .324 as a
team and are averaging 10 runs per
game.
Mike Duncan, the Cornhusker first
baseman, has what could best be des
cribed as Rick Lundblade-like statis
tics — a .404 batting average, 14
home runs and 8N RBIs.
Outfielder Paul Meyers has some
pretty impressive numbers as well.
He is hitting .399 with 77 RBIs. Like
Duncan, he has 14 homers. Catcher
Mark Kister is Nebraska's third
leading hitter, with a comparatively
paltry .370 average.
However, when asked to name his
team's greatest strength. Coach John
Sanders did not choose offense. "It's
our competitiveness — the intan
gibles," he said. "It's our ability to
cope and mental toughness."
The Cornhuskers' toughness comes
from what Sanders called
"courageous" scheduling. Others
might call it suicidal. In addition to
playing a difficult Big Eight schedule,
including No. 1 Oklahoma State and
No. 10 Oklahoma, Nebraska made an
early season road trip west for games
against San Diego State, Arizona
State, New Mexico and Nevada-Las
Vegas.
Sanders hopes that his pitching
staff and defense can keep the
Cornhuskers close enough to let the
offense pull it out. "The key will be to
have reasonable pitching and
reasonable defense," he said. "We
should score some runs."
Jeff Mays (8-1, 4.95 ERA) will try
to be reasonable today against Pep
perdine, with Mike Dobbs (6-1, 4.29)
pitching tomorrow.
Assessing the regional, Stanford
shortstop John Verducci said, "With
an unknown quantity like Nebraska,
you don't know what to expect."
He may not know much about the

Cornhuskers, but Verducci is
definitely aware of the Waves. "We
know Pepperdine is good," he said.
"They're probably the team we're
thinking about most."
Like Stanford, Pepperdine's bal
ance is its main asset. "We've got a
good blend of offense and defense,"
Coach Dave Gorrie said. "We played
well defensively, we hit well and we
ran the bases well."
Gorrie was right on all counts. The
Waves' .975 fielding percentage is the
nation's second best, trailing only
Michigan's. Pepperdine's top hitter is
Brad Bierley, who has a .359 average,
26 homers and 72 RBIs.
Other hard-hitting Waves include
Paul Farles (.345), Steve Kirkpatrick
(.335) and Steve Erickson (.332).
Pepperdine also stole 179 bases.
When listing his team's strengths,
Gorrie forgot to mention his out
standing pitching staff, led by Scott
Marrett. Marrett is 14-0 this year and
has a 1.98 ERA. He usually finishes
what he starts, with 10 complete
games.
