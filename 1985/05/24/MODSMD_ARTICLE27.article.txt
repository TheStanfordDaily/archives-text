# Big Eight baseball: definitely a big deal

OKLAHOMA CITY — From the beer to the bugs,
from the bats to the base hits. Big Eight baseball is a big
deal.
And you thought all oversized things were in Texas.
The Big Eight tournament was in town here last
weekend, and, true to form, it was a big deal. In this
state, where there is about as much excitement as there
are hills, the Big Eight baseball tournament was the only
game in town.
Oklahoma City was also hosting the NCAA Women's
Tennis Championships, but judging by the few hundred
folks who wandered in and out of Oklahoma City Tennis
Center to watch the matches, Oklahomans evidently
don't consider tennis a real sport.
When it comes to baseball or football, sports where
"our boys" wear cleats and get their uniforms dirty,
there is fan interest. In the three-day Big Eight tourna
ment, there was nearly 50,000 people worth of interest.
The biggest deal for Oklahomans — that is, second to
a match-up against anyone or anything remotely con
nected with the state of Texas — is an athletic contest
between Oklahoma State and Oklahoma. Everyone
knows what happens when these two schools get to
gether for a tussle on the gridiron, and in baseball,
there's no less love lost.
The school from a town called Stillwater (Oklahoma
State) and the school from a town called Norman
(Oklahoma) met twice here last weekeend. The first
time, 13,100 people showed up. The second time, which
was for the Big Eight championship, 13,150 were there.
This is in a stadium on the Oklahoma State Fair
Grounds that has 12,000 seats.
It's called All Sports Stadium, but is should be called
All Baseball Stadium. The Oklahoma City 89ers, the
Texas Rangers' AAA farm club, make their home here,
and how anything but baseball could be played here bor
ders on ridiculous.

But what it lacks in versatility. All Sports Stadium
makes up for in character. There are seats, most of them
bleachers, that wrap all the way around from right field
to even with third base. Down the left-field line is a
grassy slope.
The outfield walls are about 20-feet high and not cov
ered with ivy. but with advertisements, giving it the look
of an oversized Little League park.
Included are the usual beer and soft drink ads. But
there's also an "Elect Governor Bellman I '' sign and the
"Orbit Taco Shells — Made in Oklahoma" sign. There
are even ads on the foul poles, with yellow vertical let
tering reading "Finger Furniture Rentals." And in left
field, a cut-out Marlboro man is tacked on a telephone
pole.
Then there's the public address announcer for the Big
Eight. In the top of the first inning Saturday night, he
announced that a grey Cutlass was in the parking lot
with its engine running and its doors locked. "I hope the
owner of the car has an extra set of keys with him," he
joked.
There's also the scoreboard, which midway through
one game became the site of a "dot race." Three num
bered dots "raced" around a "track" on the scoreboard
while fans placed bets among themselves.
Coming down the homestretch, dot one and three
were neck-and-neck, well ahead of dot two. But as they
approached the finish line, the two front-runners
collided, and dot two passed them to win. As the fans
voiced their disapproval, the P.A. announcer consoled
them by saying, "There's been an inquiry on the dot
race."
There were beers and bugs, too. Plenty of them. The
beer is served in 16-ounce transparent cups, and most of
it at concession stands and beer trucks all over the
stadium. Evidently, single beer salesmen are too slow.
Oklahoma State's assistant sports information direc
tor said after Saturday night's championship game, "It
was just another fraternity keg party, and they invited a

couple of baseball teams to show up."
A couple of thousand bugs also crashed the party. If
they counted the mammoth winged bugs — someone
said they were locusts — the attendance would easily
have exceeded 15,000, and shattered the single-game
NCAA record for baseball set last year at the College
World Series.
But above all, there were the fans and their teams.
The fans either wore black and orange or red and white,
depending on if they from O-State or OU. Each team's
fans sat behind their team's dugout, and, as a rule, never
left that side of the stadium, even to get a beer. An
Oklahoma fan on the Oklahoma State side was like a
boy on the girls' side at summer camp, only the conse
quences were worse.
The Oklahoma State fans' favorite cheer — led by
their mascot, a Cowboy with an over-sized plastic head

and hat who shot off a cap gun — constituted standing
and cheering in unison "O-S-U" while spelling out the
letters with their arms. The OU fans' favorite cheer —
well, they didn't have a whole lot to cheer about.
In the most recent set of national rankings, Oklahoma
State was ranked No. 1, mostly because of the old
fashioned ass-kickin' it dealt Oklahoma, which was
ranked sixth at the time. The Pokes, as the Oklahoma
State Cowboys are called, beat the Sooners 11-5 Thus
day night, then blew out, blasted and everything-elsed
them, 19-4, Saturday night for the Big Eight title.
Oklahoma State is not good and it did not win 54 of its
67 games this season because of pitching and defense.
The Cowboy hurlers have struggled at times, and enter
