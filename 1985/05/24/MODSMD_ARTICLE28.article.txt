### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
OKLAHOMA CITY — The gods of college athletics
must have felt sorry for the Stanford women's tennis team
after it lost in the quarterfinals of the NCAA team cham
pionship here.
Not only are they giving Stanford a chance to win the
NCAA singles and doubles titles today, they're giving the
Cardinal a chance to do it against Trinity (Texas), the
team that knocked Stanford out last Friday .
Stanford senior Linda Gates will face Trinity's
Gretchen Rush in the NCAA singles final today at 11 a.m.
PDT. Wh*. n it's over. Gates and Rush will join their
doubles partners — Leigh Anne Eldredge for Stanford
and Lisa Sassano for Trinity — and play for the NCAA
doubles crown.
It will be the first time ever that players from the same
two schools will meet in both the singles and doubles
finals, but only the first time in a week that Gates has
played agaist Rush, and Gates and Eldredge against Rush
and Sassano.
Today's NCAA championship contests will be
rematches of the No. 1 singles and No. 1 doubles in the
Stanford- Trinity team match last Friday. Rush beat Gates
4-6, 6-4. 6-2, and Rush and Sassano beat Gates and
Eldredge 6-2, 6-3 to lead the Tigers to their 5-4 upset
win.
Stanford almost guaranteed itself the singles crown a
day early, but Cardinal sophomore Patty Fendick couldn't
hold on to second- and third-set leads against the top
seeded Rush in yesterday's first semifinal. Fendick lost a
three-set heartbreaker 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) in what Card
inal Coach Frank Brennan called "one of the best college

tennis matches I've ever seen."
Fendick. who extended her winning streak to 45 sets
when she took the first set, led 4-3 in the second with
Rush serving at 0-3. But Rush fought off four break
points and went on to win the set 6-4.
"At the end of the first set. I thought I was skunked,"
Rush said. "Near the end of the second. 1 think she was all
ready to win. and she just relaxed and let me back into the
match."
Fendick's lead — not to mention Rush's comeback —
was bigger in the third set. Fendick broke Rush's serve in
the fourth game, then held her own serve to take a 4-1
lead.
Once again, just as Rush was presumed dead, the
Trinity junior rallied to go ahead 6-5. With Rush serving
in the 12th game. Fendick was forced to stave off one
match point to send it into a 12-point tiebreaker.
Rush had double match point at 6-4 in the tiebreaker,
only to watch Fendick fight off the first one and nearly the
second. However, with the score 6-5. a Fendick cross
court forehand nicked the net and fell wide.
Brennan saw the match as more a case of Rush playing
superbly than Fendick choking.
"I thought Paity played a great match." he said, noting
that Fendick won 100 points to Rush's 94. "I thought she
was beaten by a great player. I think the only variable was
Gretchen's game. I thought Grctchen made a few errors
for a while, then made zero errors for a while.

Stanford's Dan Goldie and Jim Grabb both advanced to
the third round of the NCAA men's tennis individual
championship yesterday in Athens, Ga.
Goldie. the No. 2 seed in the tournament, opened with
some difficulty in the first round against Bryan Shelton of
Georgia Tech.
Goldie needed a tiebreaker to win the first set and lost
the second, but he pulled away in the third for the 7-6, 4-
6, 6-1 victory .
Goldie had less difficulty in the second round, blasting
Greg Hill of Texas A&M 6-1. 6-0.
Grabb. seeded third, opened with a 6-2. 6-3 victory
over New Mexico's Steve Otero.
In the second round Grabb defeated Andy Solis of Ala
bama 6-3, 6-0.
Stanford's Derrick Rostagno was knocked out of the
tournament by Todd Witsken. the No. 4 seed. 6-4, 6-2.
According to Cardinal Coach Dick Gould. Rostagno
played well in his match, but Witsken was "simply bet
ter."
"Derrick did not play badly at all. He had a couple of
chances, but Witsken is a very good player — tough to
beat." Gould said.
Rostagno had won his first-round match against Paul
Varga of Kentucky 6-3. 7-6.
Grabb and John Letts, the only doubles team from
Stanford entered in the national tournament, won their
first round match against Jeff Chambers and Wayne
Hearn of North Carolina. 7-6. 6-3.
Grabb and Letts are seeded eighth and will play either
Sam Burger and Miguel Nido of Clemson or John Rive

and Stan Roper of Florida State today in the second
round.
Stanford's No. 3 doubles team of Dan Goldie and Eric
Rosenfeld was eliminated in the preliminary round Wed
nesday. They lost to Virgil Christian and Lee Sponaugle
of Penn State 6-1, 6-4.
In singles today, Goldie, seeded No. 2 behind Georgia's
Mikael Pernfors, is scheduled to play Clemson's Nido.
"Nido is a good player coming off a very good year.
He's scrapy," Gould said.
Grabb, seeded third, meets USCs Jorge 1.0/ano today.
Lozano is currently ranked No. 15 in the Head Intercol
legiate Tennis Standings.
Gould said the play thus far in the individuals "has had
its up and downs." "For a first day, I thought we did all
right," he said.
Gould did not seem overly enthusiastic about the
matches, but the tougher competition, starting soon, may
bring out better play in Cardinal players.
The matches will be played on Georgia's Henry Field
Courts.
Georgia has hosted the NCAA men's tournament since
1977, but there is a move afoot by UCLA to change that.
The 10,000-seat Los Angeles Tennis Center, built for
the 1984 Olympic Games, hosted the NCAA women's
tournament last year, but crowds did not approach the
4,500 that witnessed the Georgia-UCLA final in Athens
last week.
Georgia's contract for the tournament expires in 1956.
Athens has an advantage as well: the tournament is the
only game in town, unlike Los Angeles, where the tourna

But the way Gates almost routinely
disposed of third-seeded Caroline
Kuhlman of USC 6-4, 6-1 in the
second semifinal, even another lite
might not help Rush today.
It took Gates, a singles and doubles
finalist for the second straight year, a
while to warm up, but when she did,
she was no match tor the Trojan
freshman.
Gates fell behind 4-1 in the first
set, then won 11 of the next 12 games
from Kuhlman, who watched hope
lessly as the four-time Ail-American
spread aces and winners all over the
court. Gates won 27 of 36 points in
the 20-minute second set. losing just
one point when serving.
Gates said the key to winning the
singles crown, the only NCAA title
she hasn't won, will be not letting up
against Rush.
"It seems like the best part of her
game is playing well when she's be
hind," Gates said. "When you're up,
you have to keep the pressure on."
After her singles semifinal, Gates
took to the court for her doubles
quarterfinal and semifinal matches.
In the quarters, third-seeded Gates
and Eldredge shut down fifth-seeded
Linda Howell and Cindy MacGregor
of San Diego State, 6-4, 6-3.
In the semis, the Cardinal pair had
a tougher time of it, losing the second
set 6-0 to top-seeded Ronni Ries and
Lise Gregory of Miami (Fla.). But
Gates and Eldredge broke Ries' serve
in the first game of the third set, then
held serve the rest of the way for the
6-1, 0-6, 6-4 victory.
Eldredge said winning tomorrow is
doubly important. "First of all, I'd
like to win it," she said. "And per
sonally, when we played them the last
time, they played really well, and
Linda and I were off in space some
where."

Linda Gates will face former junior doubles partner Gretchen Rush for
both the NCAA singles and doubles titles today in Oklahoma City.
OKLAHOMA CITY — The gods of college athletics
must have felt sorry for the Stanford women's tennis team
after it lost in the quarterfinals of the NCAA team cham
pionship here.
Not only are they giving Stanford a chance to win the
NCAA singles and doubles titles today, they're giving the
Cardinal a chance to do it against Trinity (Texas), the
team that knocked Stanford out last Friday .
Stanford senior Linda Gates will face Trinity's
Gretchen Rush in the NCAA singles final today at 11 a.m.
PDT. Wh*. n it's over. Gates and Rush will join their
doubles partners — Leigh Anne Eldredge for Stanford
and Lisa Sassano for Trinity — and play for the NCAA
doubles crown.
It will be the first time ever that players from the same
two schools will meet in both the singles and doubles
finals, but only the first time in a week that Gates has
played agaist Rush, and Gates and Eldredge against Rush
and Sassano.
Today's NCAA championship contests will be
rematches of the No. 1 singles and No. 1 doubles in the
Stanford- Trinity team match last Friday. Rush beat Gates
4-6, 6-4. 6-2, and Rush and Sassano beat Gates and
Eldredge 6-2, 6-3 to lead the Tigers to their 5-4 upset
win.
Stanford almost guaranteed itself the singles crown a
day early, but Cardinal sophomore Patty Fendick couldn't
hold on to second- and third-set leads against the top
seeded Rush in yesterday's first semifinal. Fendick lost a
three-set heartbreaker 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) in what Card
inal Coach Frank Brennan called "one of the best college

tennis matches I've ever seen."
Fendick. who extended her winning streak to 45 sets
when she took the first set, led 4-3 in the second with
Rush serving at 0-3. But Rush fought off four break
points and went on to win the set 6-4.
"At the end of the first set. I thought I was skunked,"
Rush said. "Near the end of the second. 1 think she was all
ready to win. and she just relaxed and let me back into the
match."
Fendick's lead — not to mention Rush's comeback —
was bigger in the third set. Fendick broke Rush's serve in
the fourth game, then held her own serve to take a 4-1
lead.
Once again, just as Rush was presumed dead, the
Trinity junior rallied to go ahead 6-5. With Rush serving
in the 12th game. Fendick was forced to stave off one
match point to send it into a 12-point tiebreaker.
Rush had double match point at 6-4 in the tiebreaker,
only to watch Fendick fight off the first one and nearly the
second. However, with the score 6-5. a Fendick cross
court forehand nicked the net and fell wide.
Brennan saw the match as more a case of Rush playing
superbly than Fendick choking.
"I thought Paity played a great match." he said, noting
that Fendick won 100 points to Rush's 94. "I thought she
was beaten by a great player. I think the only variable was
Gretchen's game. I thought Grctchen made a few errors
for a while, then made zero errors for a while.
