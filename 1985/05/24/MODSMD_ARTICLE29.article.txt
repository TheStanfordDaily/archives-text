# Men golfers fall to 4th, women still struggling
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff sportswriter 
After a sizzling first round Wednesday that gained them
a share of the lead, the Cardinal men golfers looked ready
to crumble yesterday after 15 holes in the second round of
the NCAA championships at Grenelefe, Fla.
But the Cardinal salvaged the round over the last three
holes, taking five shots off par to remain in strong conten
tion, only eight shots off the lead in fourth place.
Fre-tournament favorite Houston leads after two
Â»rounds at 581. Five shots back of the Cougars is Missis
sippi at 586, followed by Florida at 587. Stanford, the No.
24 seed in the tournament, came in at 589.
Stanford Coach Tim Schaaf said that the Cardinal men
struggled throughout much of the round but were saved
by the play of senior Tim Robinson. "We didn't play as
well today," Schaaf said. "We were kind of shaky. Tim's
71 is what kept us going."
Schaaf is not complaining about the Cardinal's position
heading into today's third round. "Obviously, fourth place
is a good position to be in," he said.
With the exception of Robinson, the Cardinal men
found the going much tougher yesterday. Senior Scott
Erickson shot 75 for the day, followed by junior Carl
Wagner at 77, senior Doug Thompson at 78 and junior
Don Walsworth af 79.
Earlier in the week, Erickson and Robinson were named
two of the 10 Academic All-Americans in Division I
golf.
Schaaf was obviously delighted with the announcement.
"It's unusual to have a five-man team that's contending
for a national championship with two Academic All-
Americans," he said.
USC's Sam Randolph continues to lead the individual
competition at the championships. Randolph, who fired
an opening-round 68 Wednesday, came back with a 69
yesterday to open up a three-shot lead over Ohio State's
Clark Burroughs and Mississippi's Erin Cole.
"Sam is going to be real tough to beat," Schaaf said.
"He's really playing well."
In addition to the way he's been playing this week, Ran
dolph has an added advantage, according to Schaaf. Be
cause USC is fairing so poorly in the tournament, the
Trojans are teeing off early in the morning. This is to Ran

dolph's advantage because the morning rounds lack the
gusty winds that have been plaguing the players in the af
ternoon rounds.
As much as the Cardinal men are enjoying being in con
tention for the national title, the Cardinal women are dis
appointed and subdued about being in 14th place after
two rounds of the NCAA women's championships in
Cape Cod, Mass.
"We're doing really bad," sophomore Kathleen
McCarthy said. "If there was a cut, we'd be on our way
home."
The Cardinal women, who were ranked No. 6 in the na-*
tion heading into the championships, fell 38 shots out of
the lead after yesterday's second round.
Florida, the consensus No. 1 team in the nation, has all
but had its name engraved in the championship trophy.
The Gator women finished the second round at 602, a
whopping 18 shots ahead of second-place Arizona State.
Tulsa is one shot back of ASU at 621.
McCarthy was at a loss to explain the team's perfor
mance. She said that all the players are baffled. "It's not a
real difficult course. You can score on it," McCarthy said.
The normally upbeat, talkative McCarthy was dejected
and confused by the women's play. "We're just all playing
bad at the wrong time," she said. "I'm really frustrated."
"We've got two more days left," McCarthy said. "I
really don't think that it can get any worse. It's not the end
of the world."
Freshman Anna Oxenstierna is the lone Cardinal who
has played well through the first two rounds. Oxenstierna
is in a tie for seventh place at 152 after shooting a 77 yes
terday.
Florida's No. 1 ranked Deb Richard remained in the
lead after two rounds. Richard fired a 75 for a two-day
146 total. Furman's Dottie Pepper is two shots back at
148, and ASU's Danielle Ammaccapane is in third place
at 149.
Other Stanford scores include McCarthy at 160, junior
Kathy Kostas and freshman Kay Cornelius at 165 and
freshman Trish McGonigle at 166.
Both the Cardinal men and women play the third round
tomorrow and finish up the championships with Satur
day's final round.
