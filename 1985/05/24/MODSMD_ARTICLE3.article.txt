# Synergy to stay co-op

### MARK BEYREIS Editorial staff 
Preliminary results from round two of the undergradu
ate housing Draw indicate that the co-op Synergy has
filled the necessary number of spaces to retain its status as
a co-op, according to Rodger Whitney, assistant dean of
Student Affairs and director of the Housing Center.
Whitney said he was delighted that Synergy's drive to
reach its 90 percent quota was successful. "They made a
real effort to fill the vacancies. This is good news for
them," he added.
Jack Chin, a resident assistant at Synergy this year, said
he was "relieved" that the co-op had attracted enough res
idents.
While final results from round two of the Draw will not
he ready for release until Tuesday, Whitney said that
results from the first round of the graduate lottery, the
process by which graduate students are assigned housing,
were tabulated Wednesday night and will be posted today.
Students in the lottery can be divided into three differ
ent groups: single students, married couples and married
couples with children.
First-year graduate students are automatically offered
residence at one of the graduate housing facilities on
campus, Whitney said.
Once married couples with children have been assigned
to a residence, they are allowed to keep it for four years.
Returning couples without children and singles must

re-apply each year.
Men and women draw separately in the lottery — men
select numbers from 0001 to 1,500, while women choose
from 0001 to 600. The cutoff for continuing men was
1,079, and the cutoff for continuing women was 430.
Housing options for graduate students include Crothers
Hall, Crothers Memorial, Escondido Village, Manzanita
Park, Mirrielees and the co-ops.
About 82 percent of the single graduate students re
questing on-campus housing — 1,480 of 1,795 — were as
signed housing in this round.
Whitney was happy with the progress made over last
year, when between 75 and 80 percent were offered
housing in the first round. "I'm very pleased with the lot
tery this year. . . . Eighty-two percent is enormously
high," he said.
Two-thirds of the 180 couples without children were as
signed housing in one-bedroom apartments in Escondido
Village. All of the married couples with children were of
fered housing in two- and three-bedroom apartments in
Escondido Village.
Whitney said the University has a strong commitment
to housing graduate students with children because of the
difficulties they often face in finding off-campus housing.
Graduate students who have completed round one of
the lottery now have until June 24 to choose one of three
