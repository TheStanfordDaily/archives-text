## Sampling the good, bad and soggy in frozen foods 
### AMY BIRD MANUEL MORALES 
They came from every corner of
the campus, from all classes and
majors, united by their desire to be
part of the first annual Stanford Daily
Frozen Food Forum.
Some came to show their reverence
for frozen food, others simply to bury
it. Most of them just wanted an
excuse to get up and talk about
whatever came to their minds and to
generally rag on everything in sight,
which they figured would be OK as
long as they threw in a reference to
frozen food somewhere.
The Stern lifers came because they
hoped there might be free samples.
There were even a couple Dekes
looking for dates to the spring for
mal.
When the crowd settled, the first
speaker rose.
• ••
I've traveled all over the world and
know that if you're ever in a foreign
land, you take your life in your hands
if you refuse any offer of food or
drink. That's how it is. If boiled dog
intestines are good enough for the
king of Numbytidot, then they'd bet
ter be good enough for you.
But I'm telling you that if some
foreign dignitary fresh out of Harvard
and full of American ways tries to
serve me Mrs. Paul's Onion Rings,
I'm going to have to say no and take
the consequences.
Those perfect little circles have
ruined my life. I believed in them and
they betrayed me. I followed the in
structions on the package letter for

letter. Preheat oven, bake until
golden brown, it said. Easy enough.
But for all my trust I found only dis
mal failure.
It's true. I know it sounds in
credible, but it's the memory of those
onion rings that drives me crazy.
What blatant and pernicious decep
tion! I'm walking along feeling per
fectly calm and all of a sudden I see
them descending before me, beauti
fully, falsely round and golden brown.
I can't help myself. I reach for one.
I sink my teeth in, anticipating the
ecstacy promised to me on the pack
age, and then the horrible memory of
it all comes back. The near-frozen in
terior, the soggy exterior. I'm telling
you, I'm not insane. Those onion
rings are terrible.

Uninspired? Yeah, I guess you
could say I felt uninspired. Spring at
Stanford offers up nothing of interest
to carnivores like myself. Oh sure,
you can do time around the grill at
Tresidder poking away at Lubbock
beef that falls apart in little charred
strings of meat, but why bother?
Is it any different inside Tresidder,
you ask? No, I say. You can walk
inside Tresidder to the dining area
and check out all the offerings, but if
you're looking for some good honest
all-American beef, you ain't gonna
find none.
First off, the Corner Pocket won't
give you any satisfaction. They
sprinkle their pizzas with pepperoni
more as garnish than ingredient and
their bits of beef and processed
cheese topping bring me to tears

faster than most math finals. You can
forget the Corner Pocket if you want
to impress Teena, your powerlifting
girlfriend from Lagunita.
The Main Course is no better un
less roast beef is available, roast beef
being the only real-meat dinner they
serve at Tresidder. The problem is
they only serve it every third
weekend of the month coinciding wih

full moons, Delt formals or whenever
Ozzy Osborn (any similarities?) is in
town, so I can't depend on it as a
steady protein source. And
everywhere, lettuce, lettuce, on the
floor, the register, the tables.
Baker Street is too much the hang
out for skinny runners, anemic
cyclists and girls from Roth on
weekend forays. You just can't get

anything worth a real chew and a six
pack. Baker Street is no Wendy's
and have you seen the baker? Never
trust a skinny baker. Are you listen
ing Kelly?
It's sad to say, but Stanford has fal
len prey to omnivorous and semi
carnivorous manipulators. Real men
like myself have few places to turn to
for nourishment. Where can I go to

escape this mud flood of alfalfa
sprouts, flavorless yogurt and whole
wheat bread?
Have you ever eaten turkey with
cottage cheese stuffing? I don't know
about you, but there is something
very much communistic, un-
American and down right unhealthy
about this lack of meat.
It's at times like this that I reach for
Van DeKamps Mexican Classic
Crispy Fried Beef Burritos with
guacomole. What else? This frozen
delight is the complete carnivorous
treat. Culinary enlightenment
guaranteed for $2.49.
In this fro/en box you'll find two
glorious burritos so choked full of
beef they'd make Mr. Heimlech
proud. Squeeze it with your fork, and
beef just bursts out of either crispy
end, just begging for consumption.
What a treat, and as patriotic as the
USDA (United States Does Ap
prove) stamp can make it. I never
could turn away from this meal, and I
haven't even told you about the
prepared guacamole sauce that comes
with it.
It's my hope that President
Reagan offers to ship tons of this stuff
in the form of aid to our Contra
friends down in Monterey or there
abouts.

I just want to say that looks can be
deceiving. Listen, I'm not embar
rassed to admit to a frozen TV dinner
every once in a while. Nobody's per
fect. But I told my friend Bitsy about

it and she almost threw up all over
her BMW. Yuuchy, she said when she
recovered.
So she invited me over for, get this,
a Classic Lite dinner from Armour:
turkey parmesan with Italian-style
vegetables with butter sauce and
spaghetti. I was drooling. You should
know, you've seen the commercials.
That stuff looks better than any
home-cooked meal. High class, too.
Broccoli sprigs by Calvin Klein, beef
tips by Gucci.
I'm telling you, each of those baby
carrots has to audition against a
thousand other up-and-coming carrot
starlets to get the big break that lands
them the spot on the frozen food
package. And then there's nothing
between them and a centerfold in
"The American Carrott: A Farmer's
Manual."
So I was ready. Bitsy pulled back
the thin foil covering. A gentle wisp
of steam rose and circled around my
nose. 1 breathed in deeply, 1 closed
my eyes. I thrust my fork in that lu
scious hunk of meat.
It wouldn't come out.
As far as 1 know, that piece of
turkey is still sitting there on the for
mica counter with a silver tine stuck
in it, just waiting for the next King
Arthur.

I don't think there's anything else
to say about Classic Lite, anything
that would get printed, that is. I'll
keep to my TV dinners, thanks, I said,
but Bitsy couldn't take her eyes off
the $3.49 price tag and the fancy
packaging.
• ••
I couldn't deny it. I could chose to
ignore it and pretend that those days
were over, that that part of me was
2,000 miles away in my Texas home.
I could keep walking, shrugging off
my boyhood, this first layer of bone
marrow, this shelved history, this
testament to my roots in edible form.
I could do any number of things,
but how could I ever sleep if I walked
past Bel Air's own Came Guisada.
I turned and opened the freezer
door, dislodging two Safeway fliers in
the process and spilling Jolly Green
Giant niblets on my foot. Maybe this
was irrational, maybe I'd lost my
mind along with my composure, but
here was cultural rebirth promised for
$3.67.
The microwave hummed for an
eternity, but I knew that eight
minutes away was my resurrection
from the cavernous Stern Hall dining
rooms.
The foil was a struggle, but no!
Wow!
Well. Well? Well, Bel Air might be
advised to approach Hubbard and

Johnson's as a retail outlet. They
have truly concocted the finest home
repair material I've ever come across.
Felicidades.

All this talk about how bad frozen
food is forces me to bring up an ex
ception for the sake of balance. For
get about taste for a moment. Kids
love TV dinners. Forget ham,
asparagus crepes with sherry sauce
and shrimp avocado cocktails. It's
silver-dollar sized hamburgers, a few
french fries and a pat of chocolate
pudding all the way.
The only kids who don't like frozen
TV dinners are the ones who call
their parents Ralph and Janice, and
they're nerds anyway. They might as
well have been born 21.
So what is it that changes? How is it
that 20 years later these same people
take even the casual mention of
frozen food as a moral affront?
It can't be that taste buds become
more refined with age. How can you
have any respect for taste buds who
have learned to crave de-caf coffee
and diet soda? And I wouldn't be too
quick to assume that this disdain for
frozen food springs from a sincere
commitment to a healthy diet. It's not
kids who can't see straight in the
morning until they've had their cof
fee, and then can't sit still at night un
til they've had their little nip.

No, I'm convinced there's some
thing much more insidious behind
this habitual scoffing at frozen foods.
I think it goes with the territory of so
called success — the job, the kids, the
house, two cars and a passionate
hatred of Stouffers.
Behind its all-American facade,
frozen food is a genuine threat to the
not-so-pretty underside of the Amer
ican way. It's the true democratizer.
Anyone can cook a frozen dinner,
and well.
Frozen food does what it promises
— it makes food simple. Not only
does it simplify the preparation of
food itself, but by doing this it
simplifies the human relationships
surrounding this very important issue
of feeding our faces. With the advent
of the age of frozen food, the home
will cease to be an arena of trivial
competition, and the preparation of
food will no longer be a powerful and
dangerous status symbol.
So much for the businessmen who
live off the reputation of their wives'
cooking. It's one thing to say that
Sarah spent all day slaving in the
kitchen to make this meal, and she
even put up the jam on the croissants
herself last summer. It's another thing
to say she put everything in the mi
crowave an hour ago so that Joe can
serve the food and entertain the
guests himself while she goes out.
So much for the housewife who
holds her own by inspiring guilt in her

family for all the work she does. With
frozen food, there's nothing stopping
everyone from making his own din
ner.
Frozen food helps restore to us the
simple pleasure of eating that we
knew as children. Yet 1 know that
right here in this very room are skep
tics here who'll try to force the argu
ment back to the issue of the taste of
frozen food.
My only counter is that a change as
radical as the one attempted by
frozen foods can't be painless. Case in
point.
Last night, when I was eating my
Tyson's Chick'n Chunks, I broke my
tooth oh something hard, probably a
bit of stone from one of the gizzards
that accidentally made it into the
chunks.
But instead of filing a suit against
the company, I thought of the dedi
cated slicers trying against all odds to
make frozen food available to every
one. A slip of the knife is excusable.
The vision available to us through
frozen food is great enough that it re
quires a small sacrifice on all our
parts.
Thank you.
Stop right there! 1 know what
you're thinking. Should I grab four
Stouffer's Cheese Stuffed Shells or
only three?
Well, in all that excitement over
that low-cut dress in produce I lost
track myself, but 1 can truly say ten

would not be enough. Get the Stop
fer's. Yes, that's right — eat that
frozen food. The taste is superb.
These shells are as soft as a fresh
man's behind after his first three
hour exam. Or a senior's stomach
after pub night. Or the inherent talent
of the other writer in this article.
The stuffing promised and
delivered, unlike my first drive-in
date, and with little or no coaxing or
flowers, and the sauce, well, 1 didn't
play pretend with this sauce you
know.
I confronted it, tormented it,
teased it, pushed it all over my plate
and then I ate it. Frozen food, after
all, has a higher entertainment value
than fresh food, and 1 intended to milk
this cheese for all it was worth.
Well, Mr. Cheese Sauce held form,
delivering the kind of satisfaction and
pleasure to my senses that no
Vineberg review ever could.
The stuff in question:
Mrs. Paul's Onion Rings No
Van Dekamps's Mexican Classic Crispy
Fried Burritos Yes
Classic Lite Turkey Parmesan trom Armour No
Bel Air Came Guisada No
Tyson Chick'n Chunks Yes
Captain's Choice Gourmet Shrimp Yes

very much communistic, un-
American and down right unhealthy
about this lack of meat.
It's at times like this that I reach for
Van DeKamps Mexican Classic
Crispy Fried Beef Burritos with
guacomole. What else? This frozen
delight is the complete carnivorous
treat. Culinary enlightenment
guaranteed for $2.49.
In this fro/en box you'll find two
glorious burritos so choked full of
beef they'd make Mr. Heimlech
proud. Squeeze it with your fork, and
beef just bursts out of either crispy
end, just begging for consumption.
What a treat, and as patriotic as the
USDA (United States Does Ap
prove) stamp can make it. I never
could turn away from this meal, and I
haven't even told you about the
prepared guacamole sauce that comes
with it.
It's my hope that President
Reagan offers to ship tons of this stuff
in the form of aid to our Contra
friends down in Monterey or there
abouts.

I just want to say that looks can be
deceiving. Listen, I'm not embar
rassed to admit to a frozen TV dinner
every once in a while. Nobody's per
fect. But I told my friend Bitsy about

it and she almost threw up all over
her BMW. Yuuchy, she said when she
recovered.
So she invited me over for, get this,
a Classic Lite dinner from Armour:
turkey parmesan with Italian-style
vegetables with butter sauce and
spaghetti. I was drooling. You should
know, you've seen the commercials.
That stuff looks better than any
home-cooked meal. High class, too.
Broccoli sprigs by Calvin Klein, beef
tips by Gucci.
I'm telling you, each of those baby
carrots has to audition against a
thousand other up-and-coming carrot
starlets to get the big break that lands
them the spot on the frozen food
package. And then there's nothing
between them and a centerfold in
"The American Carrott: A Farmer's
Manual."
So I was ready. Bitsy pulled back
the thin foil covering. A gentle wisp
of steam rose and circled around my
nose. 1 breathed in deeply, 1 closed
my eyes. I thrust my fork in that lu
scious hunk of meat.
It wouldn't come out.
As far as 1 know, that piece of
turkey is still sitting there on the for
mica counter with a silver tine stuck
in it, just waiting for the next King
Arthur.

I don't think there's anything else
to say about Classic Lite, anything
that would get printed, that is. I'll
keep to my TV dinners, thanks, I said,
but Bitsy couldn't take her eyes off
the $3.49 price tag and the fancy
packaging.

I couldn't deny it. I could chose to
ignore it and pretend that those days
were over, that that part of me was
2,000 miles away in my Texas home.
I could keep walking, shrugging off
my boyhood, this first layer of bone
marrow, this shelved history, this
testament to my roots in edible form.
I could do any number of things,
but how could I ever sleep if I walked
past Bel Air's own Came Guisada.
I turned and opened the freezer
door, dislodging two Safeway fliers in
the process and spilling Jolly Green
Giant niblets on my foot. Maybe this
was irrational, maybe I'd lost my
mind along with my composure, but
here was cultural rebirth promised for
$3.67.
The microwave hummed for an
eternity, but I knew that eight
minutes away was my resurrection
from the cavernous Stern Hall dining
rooms.
The foil was a struggle, but no!
Wow!
Well. Well? Well, Bel Air might be
advised to approach Hubbard and

Johnson's as a retail outlet. They
have truly concocted the finest home
repair material I've ever come across.

All this talk about how bad frozen
food is forces me to bring up an ex
ception for the sake of balance. For
get about taste for a moment. Kids
love TV dinners. Forget ham,
asparagus crepes with sherry sauce
and shrimp avocado cocktails. It's
silver-dollar sized hamburgers, a few
french fries and a pat of chocolate
pudding all the way.
The only kids who don't like frozen
TV dinners are the ones who call
their parents Ralph and Janice, and
they're nerds anyway. They might as
well have been born 21.
So what is it that changes? How is it
that 20 years later these same people
take even the casual mention of
frozen food as a moral affront?
It can't be that taste buds become
more refined with age. How can you
have any respect for taste buds who
have learned to crave de-caf coffee
and diet soda? And I wouldn't be too
quick to assume that this disdain for
frozen food springs from a sincere
commitment to a healthy diet. It's not
kids who can't see straight in the
morning until they've had their cof
fee, and then can't sit still at night un
til they've had their little nip.

No, I'm convinced there's some
thing much more insidious behind
this habitual scoffing at frozen foods.
I think it goes with the territory of so
called success — the job, the kids, the
house, two cars and a passionate
hatred of Stouffers.
Behind its all-American facade,
frozen food is a genuine threat to the
not-so-pretty underside of the Amer
ican way. It's the true democratizer.
Anyone can cook a frozen dinner,
and well.
Frozen food does what it promises
— it makes food simple. Not only
does it simplify the preparation of
food itself, but by doing this it
simplifies the human relationships
surrounding this very important issue
of feeding our faces. With the advent
of the age of frozen food, the home
will cease to be an arena of trivial
competition, and the preparation of
food will no longer be a powerful and
dangerous status symbol.
So much for the businessmen who
live off the reputation of their wives'
cooking. It's one thing to say that
Sarah spent all day slaving in the
kitchen to make this meal, and she
even put up the jam on the croissants
herself last summer. It's another thing
to say she put everything in the mi
crowave an hour ago so that Joe can
serve the food and entertain the
guests himself while she goes out.
So much for the housewife who
holds her own by inspiring guilt in her

family for all the work she does. With
frozen food, there's nothing stopping
everyone from making his own din
ner.
Frozen food helps restore to us the
simple pleasure of eating that we
knew as children. Yet 1 know that
right here in this very room are skep
tics here who'll try to force the argu
ment back to the issue of the taste of
frozen food.
My only counter is that a change as
radical as the one attempted by
frozen foods can't be painless. Case in
point.
Last night, when I was eating my
Tyson's Chick'n Chunks, I broke my
tooth oh something hard, probably a
bit of stone from one of the gizzards
that accidentally made it into the
chunks.
But instead of filing a suit against
the company, I thought of the dedi
cated slicers trying against all odds to
make frozen food available to every
one. A slip of the knife is excusable.
The vision available to us through
frozen food is great enough that it re
quires a small sacrifice on all our
parts.
Thank you.
Stop right there! 1 know what
you're thinking. Should I grab four
Stouffer's Cheese Stuffed Shells or
only three?
Well, in all that excitement over
that low-cut dress in produce I lost
track myself, but 1 can truly say ten

would not be enough. Get the Stop
fer's. Yes, that's right — eat that
frozen food. The taste is superb.
These shells are as soft as a fresh
man's behind after his first three
hour exam. Or a senior's stomach
after pub night. Or the inherent talent
of the other writer in this article.
The stuffing promised and
delivered, unlike my first drive-in
date, and with little or no coaxing or
flowers, and the sauce, well, 1 didn't
play pretend with this sauce you
know.
I confronted it, tormented it,
teased it, pushed it all over my plate
and then I ate it. Frozen food, after
all, has a higher entertainment value
than fresh food, and 1 intended to milk
this cheese for all it was worth.
Well, Mr. Cheese Sauce held form,
delivering the kind of satisfaction and
pleasure to my senses that no
Vineberg review ever could.
The stuff in question:
Mrs. Paul's Onion Rings No
Van Dekamps's Mexican Classic Crispy
Fried Burritos Yes
Classic Lite Turkey Parmesan trom Armour No
Bel Air Came Guisada No
Tyson Chick'n Chunks Yes
Captain's Choice Gourmet Shrimp Yes

They came from every corner of
the campus, from all classes and
majors, united by their desire to be
part of the first annual Stanford Daily
Frozen Food Forum.
Some came to show their reverence
for frozen food, others simply to bury
it. Most of them just wanted an
excuse to get up and talk about
whatever came to their minds and to
generally rag on everything in sight,
which they figured would be OK as
long as they threw in a reference to
frozen food somewhere.
The Stern lifers came because they
hoped there might be free samples.
There were even a couple Dekes
looking for dates to the spring for
mal.
When the crowd settled, the first
speaker rose.
• ••
I've traveled all over the world and
know that if you're ever in a foreign
land, you take your life in your hands
if you refuse any offer of food or
drink. That's how it is. If boiled dog
intestines are good enough for the
king of Numbytidot, then they'd bet
ter be good enough for you.
But I'm telling you that if some
foreign dignitary fresh out of Harvard
and full of American ways tries to
serve me Mrs. Paul's Onion Rings,
I'm going to have to say no and take
the consequences.
Those perfect little circles have
ruined my life. I believed in them and
they betrayed me. I followed the in
structions on the package letter for

letter. Preheat oven, bake until
golden brown, it said. Easy enough.
But for all my trust I found only dis
mal failure.
It's true. I know it sounds in
credible, but it's the memory of those
onion rings that drives me crazy.
What blatant and pernicious decep
tion! I'm walking along feeling per
fectly calm and all of a sudden I see
them descending before me, beauti
fully, falsely round and golden brown.
I can't help myself. I reach for one.
I sink my teeth in, anticipating the
ecstacy promised to me on the pack
age, and then the horrible memory of
it all comes back. The near-frozen in
terior, the soggy exterior. I'm telling
you, I'm not insane. Those onion
rings are terrible.
• ••
Uninspired? Yeah, I guess you
could say I felt uninspired. Spring at
Stanford offers up nothing of interest
to carnivores like myself. Oh sure,
you can do time around the grill at
Tresidder poking away at Lubbock
beef that falls apart in little charred
strings of meat, but why bother?
Is it any different inside Tresidder,
you ask? No, I say. You can walk
inside Tresidder to the dining area
and check out all the offerings, but if
you're looking for some good honest
all-American beef, you ain't gonna
find none.
First off, the Corner Pocket won't
give you any satisfaction. They
sprinkle their pizzas with pepperoni
more as garnish than ingredient and
their bits of beef and processed
cheese topping bring me to tears

faster than most math finals. You can
forget the Corner Pocket if you want
to impress Teena, your powerlifting
girlfriend from Lagunita.
The Main Course is no better un
less roast beef is available, roast beef
being the only real-meat dinner they
serve at Tresidder. The problem is
they only serve it every third
weekend of the month coinciding wih

full moons, Delt formals or whenever
Ozzy Osborn (any similarities?) is in
town, so I can't depend on it as a
steady protein source. And
everywhere, lettuce, lettuce, on the
floor, the register, the tables.
Baker Street is too much the hang
out for skinny runners, anemic
cyclists and girls from Roth on
weekend forays. You just can't get

anything worth a real chew and a six
pack. Baker Street is no Wendy's
and have you seen the baker? Never
trust a skinny baker. Are you listen
ing Kelly?
It's sad to say, but Stanford has fal
len prey to omnivorous and semi
carnivorous manipulators. Real men
like myself have few places to turn to
for nourishment. Where can I go to

escape this mud flood of alfalfa
sprouts, flavorless yogurt and whole
wheat bread?
Have you ever eaten turkey with
cottage cheese stuffing? I don't know
about you, but there is something
very much communistic, un-
American and down right unhealthy
about this lack of meat.

TV dinners are the ones who call
their parents Ralph and Janice, and
they're nerds anyway. They might as
well have been born 21.
So what is it that changes? How is it
that 20 years later these same people
take even the casual mention of
frozen food as a moral affront?
It can't be that taste buds become
more refined with age. How can you
have any respect for taste buds who
have learned to crave de-caf coffee
and diet soda? And I wouldn't be too
quick to assume that this disdain for
frozen food springs from a sincere
commitment to a healthy diet. It's not
kids who can't see straight in the
morning until they've had their cof
fee, and then can't sit still at night un
til they've had their little nip.

No, I'm convinced there's some
thing much more insidious behind
this habitual scoffing at frozen foods.
I think it goes with the territory of so
called success — the job, the kids, the
house, two cars and a passionate
hatred of Stouffers.
Behind its all-American facade,
frozen food is a genuine threat to the
not-so-pretty underside of the Amer
ican way. It's the true democratizer.
Anyone can cook a frozen dinner,
and well.
Frozen food does what it promises
— it makes food simple. Not only
does it simplify the preparation of
food itself, but by doing this it
simplifies the human relationships
surrounding this very important issue
of feeding our faces. With the advent
of the age of frozen food, the home
will cease to be an arena of trivial
competition, and the preparation of
food will no longer be a powerful and
dangerous status symbol.
So much for the businessmen who
live off the reputation of their wives'
cooking. It's one thing to say that
Sarah spent all day slaving in the
kitchen to make this meal, and she
even put up the jam on the croissants
herself last summer. It's another thing
to say she put everything in the mi
crowave an hour ago so that Joe can
serve the food and entertain the
guests himself while she goes out.
So much for the housewife who
holds her own by inspiring guilt in her

family for all the work she does. With
frozen food, there's nothing stopping
everyone from making his own din
ner.
Frozen food helps restore to us the
simple pleasure of eating that we
knew as children. Yet 1 know that
right here in this very room are skep
tics here who'll try to force the argu
ment back to the issue of the taste of
frozen food.
My only counter is that a change as
radical as the one attempted by
frozen foods can't be painless. Case in
point.
Last night, when I was eating my
Tyson's Chick'n Chunks, I broke my
tooth oh something hard, probably a
bit of stone from one of the gizzards
that accidentally made it into the
chunks.
But instead of filing a suit against
the company, I thought of the dedi
cated slicers trying against all odds to
make frozen food available to every
one. A slip of the knife is excusable.
The vision available to us through
frozen food is great enough that it re
quires a small sacrifice on all our
parts.
Thank you.
Stop right there! 1 know what
you're thinking. Should I grab four
Stouffer's Cheese Stuffed Shells or
only three?
Well, in all that excitement over
that low-cut dress in produce I lost
track myself, but 1 can truly say ten

would not be enough. Get the Stop
fer's. Yes, that's right — eat that
frozen food. The taste is superb.
These shells are as soft as a fresh
man's behind after his first three
hour exam. Or a senior's stomach
after pub night. Or the inherent talent
of the other writer in this article.
The stuffing promised and
delivered, unlike my first drive-in
date, and with little or no coaxing or
flowers, and the sauce, well, 1 didn't
play pretend with this sauce you
know.
I confronted it, tormented it,
teased it, pushed it all over my plate
and then I ate it. Frozen food, after
all, has a higher entertainment value
than fresh food, and 1 intended to milk
this cheese for all it was worth.
Well, Mr. Cheese Sauce held form,
delivering the kind of satisfaction and
pleasure to my senses that no
Vineberg review ever could.

They came from every corner of
the campus, from all classes and
majors, united by their desire to be
part of the first annual Stanford Daily
Frozen Food Forum.
Some came to show their reverence
for frozen food, others simply to bury
it. Most of them just wanted an
excuse to get up and talk about
whatever came to their minds and to
generally rag on everything in sight,
which they figured would be OK as
long as they threw in a reference to
frozen food somewhere.
The Stern lifers came because they
hoped there might be free samples.
There were even a couple Dekes
looking for dates to the spring for
mal.
When the crowd settled, the first
speaker rose.
• ••
I've traveled all over the world and
know that if you're ever in a foreign
land, you take your life in your hands
if you refuse any offer of food or
drink. That's how it is. If boiled dog
intestines are good enough for the
king of Numbytidot, then they'd bet
ter be good enough for you.
But I'm telling you that if some
foreign dignitary fresh out of Harvard
and full of American ways tries to
serve me Mrs. Paul's Onion Rings,
I'm going to have to say no and take
the consequences.
Those perfect little circles have
ruined my life. I believed in them and
they betrayed me. I followed the in
structions on the package letter for

letter. Preheat oven, bake until
golden brown, it said. Easy enough.
But for all my trust I found only dis
mal failure.
It's true. I know it sounds in
credible, but it's the memory of those
onion rings that drives me crazy.
What blatant and pernicious decep
tion! I'm walking along feeling per
fectly calm and all of a sudden I see
them descending before me, beauti
fully, falsely round and golden brown.
I can't help myself. I reach for one.
I sink my teeth in, anticipating the
ecstacy promised to me on the pack
age, and then the horrible memory of
it all comes back. The near-frozen in
terior, the soggy exterior. I'm telling
you, I'm not insane. Those onion
rings are terrible.
• ••
Uninspired? Yeah, I guess you
could say I felt uninspired. Spring at
Stanford offers up nothing of interest
to carnivores like myself. Oh sure,
you can do time around the grill at
Tresidder poking away at Lubbock
beef that falls apart in little charred
strings of meat, but why bother?
Is it any different inside Tresidder,
you ask? No, I say. You can walk
inside Tresidder to the dining area
and check out all the offerings, but if
you're looking for some good honest
all-American beef, you ain't gonna
find none.
First off, the Corner Pocket won't
give you any satisfaction. They
sprinkle their pizzas with pepperoni
more as garnish than ingredient and
their bits of beef and processed
cheese topping bring me to tears

faster than most math finals. You can
forget the Corner Pocket if you want
to impress Teena, your powerlifting
girlfriend from Lagunita.
The Main Course is no better un
less roast beef is available, roast beef
being the only real-meat dinner they
serve at Tresidder. The problem is
they only serve it every third
weekend of the month coinciding wih

full moons, Delt formals or whenever
Ozzy Osborn (any similarities?) is in
town, so I can't depend on it as a
steady protein source. And
everywhere, lettuce, lettuce, on the
floor, the register, the tables.
Baker Street is too much the hang
out for skinny runners, anemic
cyclists and girls from Roth on
weekend forays. You just can't get

anything worth a real chew and a six
pack. Baker Street is no Wendy's
and have you seen the baker? Never
trust a skinny baker. Are you listen
ing Kelly?
It's sad to say, but Stanford has fal
len prey to omnivorous and semi
carnivorous manipulators. Real men
like myself have few places to turn to
for nourishment. Where can I go to

escape this mud flood of alfalfa
sprouts, flavorless yogurt and whole
wheat bread?
Have you ever eaten turkey with
cottage cheese stuffing? I don't know
about you, but there is something
very much communistic, un-
American and down right unhealthy
about this lack of meat.
It's at times like this that I reach for
Van DeKamps Mexican Classic
Crispy Fried Beef Burritos with
guacomole. What else? This frozen
delight is the complete carnivorous
treat. Culinary enlightenment
guaranteed for $2.49.
In this fro/en box you'll find two
glorious burritos so choked full of
beef they'd make Mr. Heimlech
proud. Squeeze it with your fork, and
beef just bursts out of either crispy
end, just begging for consumption.
What a treat, and as patriotic as the
USDA (United States Does Ap
prove) stamp can make it. I never
could turn away from this meal, and I
haven't even told you about the
prepared guacamole sauce that comes
with it.
It's my hope that President
Reagan offers to ship tons of this stuff
in the form of aid to our Contra
friends down in Monterey or there
abouts.

I just want to say that looks can be
deceiving. Listen, I'm not embar
rassed to admit to a frozen TV dinner
every once in a while. Nobody's per
fect. But I told my friend Bitsy about

it and she almost threw up all over
her BMW. Yuuchy, she said when she
recovered.
So she invited me over for, get this,
a Classic Lite dinner from Armour:
turkey parmesan with Italian-style
vegetables with butter sauce and
spaghetti. I was drooling. You should
know, you've seen the commercials.
That stuff looks better than any
home-cooked meal. High class, too.
Broccoli sprigs by Calvin Klein, beef
tips by Gucci.
I'm telling you, each of those baby
carrots has to audition against a
thousand other up-and-coming carrot
starlets to get the big break that lands
them the spot on the frozen food
package. And then there's nothing
between them and a centerfold in
"The American Carrott: A Farmer's
Manual."
So I was ready. Bitsy pulled back
the thin foil covering. A gentle wisp
of steam rose and circled around my
nose. 1 breathed in deeply, 1 closed
my eyes. I thrust my fork in that lu
scious hunk of meat.
It wouldn't come out.
As far as 1 know, that piece of
turkey is still sitting there on the for
mica counter with a silver tine stuck
in it, just waiting for the next King
Arthur.

I don't think there's anything else
to say about Classic Lite, anything
that would get printed, that is. I'll
keep to my TV dinners, thanks, I said,
but Bitsy couldn't take her eyes off
the $3.49 price tag and the fancy
packaging.
• ••
I couldn't deny it. I could chose to
ignore it and pretend that those days
were over, that that part of me was
2,000 miles away in my Texas home.
I could keep walking, shrugging off
my boyhood, this first layer of bone
marrow, this shelved history, this
testament to my roots in edible form.
I could do any number of things,
but how could I ever sleep if I walked
past Bel Air's own Came Guisada.
I turned and opened the freezer
door, dislodging two Safeway fliers in
the process and spilling Jolly Green
Giant niblets on my foot. Maybe this
was irrational, maybe I'd lost my
mind along with my composure, but
here was cultural rebirth promised for
$3.67.
The microwave hummed for an
eternity, but I knew that eight
minutes away was my resurrection
from the cavernous Stern Hall dining
rooms.
The foil was a struggle, but no!
Wow!
Well. Well? Well, Bel Air might be
advised to approach Hubbard and

Johnson's as a retail outlet. They
have truly concocted the finest home
repair material I've ever come across.
Felicidades.

All this talk about how bad frozen
food is forces me to bring up an ex
ception for the sake of balance. For
get about taste for a moment. Kids
love TV dinners. Forget ham,
asparagus crepes with sherry sauce
and shrimp avocado cocktails. It's
silver-dollar sized hamburgers, a few
french fries and a pat of chocolate
pudding all the way.
