## Sampling the good, bad and soggy in frozen foods 
### AMY BIRD MANUEL MORALES 
They came from every corner of
the campus, from all classes and
majors, united by their desire to be
part of the first annual Stanford Daily
Frozen Food Forum.
Some came to show their reverence
for frozen food, others simply to bury
it. Most of them just wanted an
excuse to get up and talk about
whatever came to their minds and to
generally rag on everything in sight,
which they figured would be OK as
long as they threw in a reference to
frozen food somewhere.
The Stern lifers came because they
hoped there might be free samples.
There were even a couple Dekes
looking for dates to the spring for
mal.
When the crowd settled, the first
speaker rose.

I've traveled all over the world and
know that if you're ever in a foreign
land, you take your life in your hands
if you refuse any offer of food or
drink. That's how it is. If boiled dog
intestines are good enough for the
king of Numbytidot, then they'd bet
ter be good enough for you.
But I'm telling you that if some
foreign dignitary fresh out of Harvard
and full of American ways tries to
serve me Mrs. Paul's Onion Rings,
I'm going to have to say no and take
the consequences.
Those perfect little circles have
ruined my life. I believed in them and
they betrayed me. I followed the in
structions on the package letter for

letter. Preheat oven, bake until
golden brown, it said. Easy enough.
But for all my trust I found only dis
mal failure.
It's true. I know it sounds in
credible, but it's the memory of those
onion rings that drives me crazy.
What blatant and pernicious decep
tion! I'm walking along feeling per
fectly calm and all of a sudden I see
them descending before me, beauti
fully, falsely round and golden brown.
I can't help myself. I reach for one.
I sink my teeth in, anticipating the
ecstacy promised to me on the pack
age, and then the horrible memory of
it all comes back. The near-frozen in
terior, the soggy exterior. I'm telling
you, I'm not insane. Those onion
rings are terrible.

Uninspired? Yeah, I guess you
could say I felt uninspired. Spring at
Stanford offers up nothing of interest
to carnivores like myself. Oh sure,
you can do time around the grill at
Tresidder poking away at Lubbock
beef that falls apart in little charred
strings of meat, but why bother?
Is it any different inside Tresidder,
you ask? No, I say. You can walk
inside Tresidder to the dining area
and check out all the offerings, but if
you're looking for some good honest
all-American beef, you ain't gonna
find none.
First off, the Corner Pocket won't
give you any satisfaction. They
sprinkle their pizzas with pepperoni
more as garnish than ingredient and
their bits of beef and processed
cheese topping bring me to tears

faster than most math finals. You can
forget the Corner Pocket if you want
to impress Teena, your powerlifting
girlfriend from Lagunita.
The Main Course is no better un
less roast beef is available, roast beef
being the only real-meat dinner they
serve at Tresidder. The problem is
they only serve it every third
weekend of the month coinciding wih

full moons, Delt formals or whenever
Ozzy Osborn (any similarities?) is in
town, so I can't depend on it as a
steady protein source. And
everywhere, lettuce, lettuce, on the
floor, the register, the tables.
Baker Street is too much the hang
out for skinny runners, anemic
cyclists and girls from Roth on
weekend forays. You just can't get

anything worth a real chew and a six
pack. Baker Street is no Wendy's
and have you seen the baker? Never
trust a skinny baker. Are you listen
ing Kelly?
It's sad to say, but Stanford has fal
len prey to omnivorous and semi
carnivorous manipulators. Real men
like myself have few places to turn to
for nourishment. Where can I go to

escape this mud flood of alfalfa
sprouts, flavorless yogurt and whole
wheat bread?
Have you ever eaten turkey with
cottage cheese stuffing? I don't know
about you, but there is something
very much communistic, un-
American and down right unhealthy
about this lack of meat.
It's at times like this that I reach for
Van DeKamps Mexican Classic
Crispy Fried Beef Burritos with
guacomole. What else? This frozen
delight is the complete carnivorous
treat. Culinary enlightenment
guaranteed for $2.49.
In this fro/en box you'll find two
glorious burritos so choked full of
beef they'd make Mr. Heimlech
proud. Squeeze it with your fork, and
beef just bursts out of either crispy
end, just begging for consumption.
What a treat, and as patriotic as the
USDA (United States Does Ap
prove) stamp can make it. I never
could turn away from this meal, and I
haven't even told you about the
prepared guacamole sauce that comes
with it.
It's my hope that President
Reagan offers to ship tons of this stuff
in the form of aid to our Contra
friends down in Monterey or there
abouts.

I just want to say that looks can be
deceiving. Listen, I'm not embar
rassed to admit to a frozen TV dinner
every once in a while. Nobody's per
fect. But I told my friend Bitsy about
