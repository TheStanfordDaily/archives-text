## Stanford, Oxford students debate collectivism 
### WILLIAM PENNEY 
"It's very trendy to be socially aware; it's very trendy to
talk about nuclear war and waste, but it's not trendy to
come up with real solutions," said a champion debater
from the United Kingdom on his way to defeating a Stan
ford debate team here last night.
Oxford student Nick Robinson and his colleague,
Robert MacKay, debated on the negative side of the
topic, "Does the survival of the world require collec
tivism?" against a Stanford team comprised of freshmen
Daralyn Durie and Mark Lemley in Terman Auditorium.
Durie, on the affirmative side, had the opening speech
and compared the current world situation to a "man who
jumps from a 100-foot building and, when tailing, says, at
the 10th floor, 'I'm not dead yet, so it must be OK.
"Collectivism simply means that the individuals in our
society must recognize that if our world is to survive, we
must look to the security of that world as a whole, and that
we must place our own individual desires, our own goals
— when they are harmful to our society — at rest," Durie
said.
MacKay spoke next, but first described the Oxford
Union Society, which he was representing, as "a quaint
little institution; a debating society with some 5,000 mem
bers. Every term we elect officers whom we spend 90 per
cent of our time insulting and being terribly rude to."
He criticized Durie's argument, saying, "To extrapolate
(from the world's problems) a doom-ridden view of the
future, with vast overpopulation, reduced supply and in
creased demand for essential commodities and strife re

suiting from these effects is to deny the fundamental les
son of science: that man can produce more from less by
increased technology.
"Collectivism is centralization: a structured and
planned economics," MacKay said. "Such economies do
not work, precisely because they do not respond to
demand, but they respond to predicted demand. A
demand, indeed, predicted by centralized planners rather
than the people, such as in the Soviet Union."
Lemley, recognized by moderator Todd Davies, a Stan
ford co-terminal student, retaliated, saying that "re
sources should be distributed more equally, so that every
one gets a fair share. We're not talking about control of
the means of production or a dictatorship at all levels of
society. Instead, we're talking about democracy, but one
where everyone has a piece of the pie. . . . The Soviet
Union is a dictatorship, ours is not," he added.
Robinson, speaking as Oxford's second negative, gave
the last of the constructive speeches. "A preoccupation
with the disasters that are supposedly to come produces a
warping of what we know to be the present; a rewriting of
the past," he said.
In the end, the audience of 100 people backed the Ox
ford team that argued against collectivism. Before the
debate, 38 took an affirmative stance on the topic, 19 had
a negative view and 35 were undecided. After the final
speeches, 28 people had a postive outlook, 50 people
were against collectivism and 14 people remained un
decided.
