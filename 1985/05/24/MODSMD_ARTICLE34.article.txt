## CINEMA SCOPE 
### 
New York, New York (1977)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
Martin Scorsese's movie musical is set
mostly in the 19405, during the late Big
Band era (it begins on V-J Day), and it
chronicles the romance between Jimmy
Doyle, a saxophonist (Robert De Niro),
and a singer, Francine Evans (Liza Min
nelli), both aspiring to reach the top. The
plot has echoes of "A Star Is Born" and
"Funny Girl"; shot entirely in dream
textured Technicolor by Laszlo Kovacs,
it recalls the M-G-M musicals of the '40s
and early '50s, especially Vincente Min
nelli's and Stanley Donen's (and Liza
Minnelli is coiffed and garbed to point up
an eerie resemblance to her mother, Judy
Garland, who starred in some of those
pictures). Scorsese wants to make two
movies at the same time: a comment on
the musicals he evokes, and a free-style,
probing examination of an unsuccessful
marriage. They intersect because the film
tries to get at the discrepancy between
the actual life of the post-war era and the
way in which the pop culture of the time
and our own nostalgia have distorted it.
Neither of these movies quite comes off
— long as it is (almost three hours),
"New York, New York" feels truncated,
the screenplay by Earl Mac Rauch and
Mardik Martin unshaped. (Those who
have read the original version claim that
it was Scorsese's improvisations with his
two stars that bent it out of shape.) But
unsuccessful as he is, ultimately, Scorsese
comes close, and the movie is breathtak
ing, partly because of the overpowering
performances of De Niro and Minnelli.
With Lionel Stander, Barry Primus,
Clarence Clemons, Georgie Auld (who
dubs De Niro's sax) and Diahnne Ab
bott. John Kander and Fred Ebb wrote a
handful of original songs; the rest are
standards.
Plays Wednesday with "Cabaret."
Animal House (1978)
Memorial Auditorium
It has a few very funny gags, but it does
go on. Given the setting — a small col
lege in 1962 — John Landis' movie
barely scratches the surface potential for
parody, though the best scene, at a
neighboring women's school called
Emily Dickinson College, where all the
students have long brown hair and names
like Fern Leibowitz and Shelley
Dubinsky, is worthy of Woody Allen.
Aside from that, the best reason to see
the movie is John Belushi. (Donald Suth
erland has an amusing cameo as a
stoned professor.) Harold Ramis,
Douglas Kenney and Chris Miller wrote
the script, and Elmer Bernstein, trying
painfully hard to be playful, came up
with the score. With Thomas Hulce, Tim
Matheson, John Vernon, Verna Bloom
and Peter Riegert.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 and 9:30.
Weekend (1967)
Cubberley Auditorium
Jean-Luc Godard's contemporary vi

sion of hell is not his most consistently
brilliant movie, or his most satisfying, or
his most accessible. But perhaps it should
be called his greatest, because at its best
— in the long erotic monologue (which
has only one equal in movies: Bibi An
dersson's description of the orgy in
"Persona") and the traffic jam sequence
(which is peerless) — it ranks with the
most provocative works of art of our cen
tury. "Weekend" marked the end of
Godard's classic period, which began in
1959 with "Breathless"; in the late
1960s he tumbled into a pedantic Maoist
phase from which he did not fully emerge
until 1980. With Mireille Dare and Jean
Yanne.
Plays Tuesday at 8.
Danton (1983)
Maison Francaise
Gerard Depardieu's Danton, the
French Revolutionary leader whose last
days this film chronicles, is a sensualist
and a star — he knows he enjoys the
idolatry of the Parisians and he plays up
to them as well as playing hard-to-get
with them. He has the savvy of a
celebrity. Depardieu has said that he
used Muhammad Ali as a role model for
some of Danton's flourishes, and (as
usual) his instincts served him well: Dan
ton is a champion, even in defeat (i.e.,
under the guillotine). The Polish
filmmaker Andrzej Wajda's film, written
by Jean-Claude Carriere and others, is a
vigorous historical spectacle that gives
the constant impression of forward mo
tion. Wajda's passionate sweep and his
recognition of the farcical element em
bedded in any grand gesture may not add
up to great history, but they are a
welcome relief from the usual cautious
approach taken by the makers of histori
cal epics. The supporting cast includes
two of the luminaries of the Parisian
stage, directors Patrice Chereau and
Roger Planchon.
Plays Thursday at 8.
Dreamscape (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Max von Sydow plays Paul Novotny, a
brilliant scientist who has discovered
"dreamlinking," a way to help psychia
tric patients suffering from terrifying
nightmares. Psychics enter the subjects'
dreams, acting either as objective obser
vers whose description of the
"dreamscape" can determine the course
of therapy afterwards, or as participants
— helpmates with the ability to guide the
dreamer or even shape his dream. Den
nis Quaid (who specializes in this kind of
role) plays Alex, the "good" psychic, a

cheerful, irreverent, womanizing screw
up with a predilection for gambling and a
taste for adventure; arrogant and sly, he
still has such a relaxed good time in life
that the audience identifies with him im
mediately. As the "bad" psychic, David
Patrick Kelly does his specialty — a
psycho role — and he's even creepier
than he was in "The Warriors." David
Loughery wrote this ingenious little
movie with the director, Joseph Ruben
(from Loughery's story). Ruben and his
team (photographer Brian Tufano,
editor Richard Halsey, special effects
designer Peter Kuran) have given it a
classy look and a varied texture; each of
the dreams Alex enters has a different
style and tone, and one of them — a little
boy's nightmare — is a beauty. With
Kate Capshaw as the love interest, Eddie
Albert as the president and Christopher
Plummer as a government villain whose
mean tricks (and performance) the
movie could easily have dispensed with.
Plays tomorrow with "2010."
Sons and Lovers (1960)
Castro, San Francisco
How could any film do justice to D.H.
Lawrence's autobiographical novel about
growing up in a Nottingham mining
town? Given the impossibility of the
task, the director. Jack Cardiff, and the
screenwriters, Gavin Lambert and
T.E.B. Clarke, have done better than
anyone could have expected: It's a
smashing movie, even if it is dwarfed by
its source. Three extraordinary English
actors do pretty close to their best work
here — Trevor Howard as Morel, Wendy
Hiller as Mrs. Morel and Mary Ure
(whose performance is a paragon of un
derstatement) as Clara — and the great
Freddie Francis' black and white photog
raphy is sensuous and evocative. As
usual. Dean Stockwell (in the central
role) — the only American in the cast —
isn't quite satisfying; he doesn't chart
Paul Morel's development in a way that
we can truly comprehend. Still, his line
readings are sensitive and intelligent, and
when you have dialogue like this, mostly
lifted from Lawrence, you can do without
a young Olivier if you have to. "You
would put me in your pocket, but I
should die there,smothered," Paul says to
Miriam (Heather Sears) — it was wise of
Lambert and Clarke to stick so close to
dialogue they could never h&ve bettered.
Plays Thursday with "Compulsion."
Outback (1970)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
This modest but gripping film about
male bonding in the fetid atmosphere of

the Australian outback is virtually un
known, but it's probably director Ted
Kotcheffs finest hour. Evan Jones based
his script on "Wake in Fright," a novel
by Kenneth Cook; it tells the story of a
teacher (Gary Bond) on the verge of self
destruction in this awful, dead place
where the men amuse themselves by tor
turing and killing kangaroos. The script is
not all it might be — the teacher's story is
not half as interesting as the milieu in
which it occurs, and Donald Pleasence
shows up in one of his aging-creepo roles
— but Kotcheff does well.
Plays Monday with "Ned Kelly."
Cover Girl (1944)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
Most of the big, optimistic Technicolor
musicals of the war years were made at
Twentieth Century-Fox, and most of
them were just awful; this one, which
came out of Columbia, is one of the few
worth seeing. Rita Hayworth plays the
cover girl of the title; she is in love with
Gene Kelly, and Phil Silvers is their
mutual best friend. These three are fun
to watch together, especially when they
romp through the Jerome Kern-Ira
Gershwin tunes, which include "Put Me
to the Test," the lovely ballad "Long
Ago and Far Away," and "Make Way
for Tomorrow" (lyric by E.Y. Harburg).
The highlight is Gene Kelly's "Alter
Ego" number, in which he dances with
himself. Find some excuse to sneak out
during the flashback sequence, in which
Rita Hayworth, playing her own mother,
sings a music hall ditty called "Poor
John!" (Actually, Nan Wynn does all of
Hayworth's singing for her.) Written by
Virginia Van Upp, directed by Charles
Vidor, and photographed by Rudolph
Mate. The lackluster supporting cast in
cludes Lee Bowman, Otto Kruger, Jinx
Falkenburg and (a relief); Eve Arden
brightens it a little.
Plays Monday with "Tonight and
Every Night."
Star! (1968)
Castro, San Francisco
Well, it was inevitable that one day
someone would revive the full-length
version of this misbegotten musical biog
raphy, which was such a bomb on its
original release that Twentieth Century-
Fox cut nearly an hour and a half out of
it, retitled it "Those Were the Happy
Times," and tried to recoup their losses
by bringing it out a second time. They
should have known better: Would you
rush out to see a movie called "Those
Were the Happy Times"? William Fair
child wrote this picture, which is an at

tempt (unusual for its time and its genre)
to frame the career of stage star
Gertrude Lawrence with a cynical view
of her private life, and Robert Wise,
whose phenomenal box office success
with "The Sound of Music" had evi
dently robbed him of any sense of
proportion, directed it. His decision to
cast Julie Andrews in the lead was obvi
ously an intended commercial one, but
she is so blatantly wrong for the role that
it almost seems like a daring piece of
stupidity. Gertrude Lawrence couldn't
sing a note without quavering all the
place, but she had a shrewd show
woman's self-assurance and so much wit
that she put over (brilliantly) some of the
best theatrical songs of the 19205, '30s
and '40s. Julie Andrews can sing, but she
can't do much else, and it's painful to
watch her reduce Noel Coward's
"Parisian Pierrot" and "Someday I'll
Find You," the Gershwins' "Someone to
Watch Over Me," Kurt Weill's "Jenny,"
Philip Brahm's "Limehouse Blues" and
other favorites to demonstrations of vo
cal technique. (Michael Kidd's staging
and Boris Leven's production designs ex
acerbate the situation.) Co-starring
Richard Crenna, Michael Craig and
Daniel Massey, who plays Noel Coward
with sharpness and modesty — a lack of
which virtues kills off the rest of the
movie.
Plays Wednesday with "There's No
Business Like Show Business."
