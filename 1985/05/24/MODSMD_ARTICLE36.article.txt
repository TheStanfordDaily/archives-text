## The 						University's noise guidelines 
### DANNY PEARL Staff writer 
When students, police and Resi
dential Education officials meet
today to discuss the problem of noisy
campus parties, they will not he
dealing with a new issue. For years,
the University has tried to balance
the right of students to have fun with
the right of the community to work
and to sleep.
In fact, in an attempt to alleviate
the problem, a committee composed
of students, faculty, staff and a Stan
ford police representative met earlier
this year and issued recommen
dations that serve as the University's
"guidelines on noise and neighborly
relations."
"We interpret the Fundamental
Standard to mean that students and
other residents of the community who
participate in activities that generate
noise must recognize that other mem
bers of the community may not wish
to hear that noise, and that those re
sponsible for the noise must modify
their behavior accordingly," the com
mittee reported.
The committee suggested specifi
cally that party-goers:
• Keep speakers indoors if possible.
"Move the party to people's rooms,
and significantly reduce all noise" by
11 p.m. during the week and l a.m.
nn ""^kends.

• Close as many windows and doors
as possible, especially those facing
neighbors who might be disturbed.
• "Ask party-goers not to congregate
outside the house — they should
either stay inside or disperse."
• Turn down the music after a party
starts.
• "Distribute a flier beforehand to
neighbors likely to be disturbed by
the party, and tell them the date and
time of the party as well as the steps
you are taking to keep the noise level
down. Include a phone number that
neighbors can call before calling
police. Student residents should dis
tribute these fliers to resident assis
tants and resident fellows in neigh
boring houses as well as to other
campus residents. Fliers should be
distributed well in advance of the
party."
The guidelines suggested bother
ered neighbors talk to offenders before
calling the police, saying, "If the
response from offenders was inade
quate, call the Office of Residential
Education the following work day."
Robinson, who will meet with stu
dents and police today to discuss out
door parties, said one other way to
keep parties from being cut
short is for students to identify clearly
a person in charge of the party and
reacting to complaints.
