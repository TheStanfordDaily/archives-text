# Stanford-run computer care eyed

Stanford's Academic Computing and Information Sys
tems (ACIS) has initiated a survey to determine the
feasibility of establishing its own maintenance division in
an effort to recapture up to 25 percent of the millions of
dollars paid out annually to outside vendors who currently
service computers here.
The savings would stem from the nonprofit nature of
the proposed maintenance center and the elimination of
nonessential overhead, Sandy Lernerof the Low Overhead
Time-Sharing (LOTS) computer system told the Uni
veristy News Service.
"It's mostly a question of economies of scale," said
Ralph Gorin, director of LOTS. Because each computing
facility on campus would have the option of continuing to
work with outside vendors, the proposal would be finan
cially worthwhile only "if we get enough of the systems
that are on campus to participate," he said.
If approved, the maintenance unit could begin with a
"gradual start-up" in September with an initial focus on
Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC) machines, which are the
most prevalent brand on campus, Gorin said. Service
would be expanded as appropriate to maintain other
brands of computing equipment.

Stanford spends approximate!) $3.5 million to service
several hundred DEC machines on campus.
Although such a maintenance division would he more
consistent, faster and more reliable than vendor-provided
services, "in a strong sense, the University does not want
to be in this business because it is not central to its aca
demic mission," Gorin said.
Computers, however, do pla\ a central role in the aca
demic mission, and having them functioning properly on a
regular basis is essential, Gorin said.
Computer science faculty members seem to concur that
an in-housc maintenance unit would not be going beyond
the bounds of accepted University behavior. "We don't
have McDonald's cater our food just because cooking
food isn't part of our academic mission,'' said Jett Ullman.
professor of computer science.
In addition, a large portion of computer maintenance
expenses are covered by general funds of the University.
Gorin said he hopes that savings garnered in the area ot
maintenance could be applied to the consolidation and
improvement budget,"the budget from which all new
programs are initiated."
According to its informational brochure, AC IS intends
for the maintenance unit to offer three-tiered service.
