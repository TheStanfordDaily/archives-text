## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Staff writer 
A Stanford Medical Center has
received a bequest of at least $1.1
million from the estates of former
University President Donald Tresid
der and his wife Mary.
The University Board of Trustees
authorized the use of the funds at a
May 13 meeting after a recommenda
tion from the Committee on Aca
demic Affairs and Development. The
funds will be used for the study of eye
and heart disease, as both Tresidders
were afflicted by these maladies.
He had heart disease, while she suf
fered from glaucoma.
Carol Kersten, assistant director of
medical development, said that al
though she could not compare the
size of the donation to other dona
tions, it was "definitely a very signifi
cant contribution'" to the financial re
sources available for research at the
medical center.
In 1970, Mary Tresidder estab
lished by bequest the Donald B. and
Mary C. Tresidder Charitable

Remainder Annuity Trust Fund,
which paid income for life to two
beneficiaries. The last beneficiary
died in January, making the principal

of the trust available to the School of
Medicine.
Donald Tresidder served as the
University's fourth president from
Sept. 1, 1943, until his death on
July 28, 1948. Tresidder was found

dead in his New York City hotel
room while on an East Coast trip to
visit universities and attend an educa
tional association meeting.
Both Tresidder and his wife were
Stanford graduates and had strong
ties to the University. The Tresidders
were married in 1920 after a romance
that started in Yosemite. Tresidder
later became president of a vacation
resort company established by his
wife's family, the founders of
Yosemite's Camp Curry.
Tresidder received his medical
degree from Stanford in 1927, and
later helped found the Stanford As
sociates, a successful fund-raising
group. He was named to the Board of
Trustees in 1939 and was chosen
president of the board in 1942.
In 1942, Tresidder led the search
to find a replacement for outgoing
University President Ray Lyman Wil
bur. While Tresidder was on a trip,
the heads of the University's ten
schools submitted a petition urging
the board to appoint him as presi
dent.
