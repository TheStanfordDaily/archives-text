# Students, police to meet on noise
## Party shut-downs spark dialogue with Residential Education

Students and Stanford police officers are sched
uled to meet this afternoon with Norm Robinson,
associate dean of Student Affairs for Residential
Education, to discuss a perennial problem that
resurfaced last weekend — party noise.
Robinson said the purpose of the public meeting,
to be held at 5 p.m. in the conference room on the
third floor of Old Union, is to work out ways to
ensure outdoor parties are not shut down.
The meeting was spurred by several incidents in
which police halted parties last weekend:
• Rinconada's annual outdoor Rinc-a-delt party
for charity was halted at 1 1:30 p.m. Saturday by
campus police, who said they had received up to
100 complaints about loud music. Party organizers
complained because they paid the band Wire Train
$1,000 to play at the party, only to have the police
halt the band a few minutes into its performance.
• Sunday afternoon, police officers stopped the
Florence Moore Hall's outdoor Miller High Life
party at 5:30 p.m.
• Outdoor rehearsals for a dorm musical at Twain
were stopped by police at midnight Monday and 1 I
p.m. Tuesday after complaints from residents of
Crothers and Crothers Memorial dormitories.
Some Rinconada residents complained of police
heavy-handedness and insensitivity in breaking up
their party, but Stanford Police Capt. Marvin
Moore said dormitory residents — not police offi
cers — acted unreasonably.
"It's not very considerate to start an outdoor
party with a live band at 10 at night." Moore said.
"People were deluged with noise from Escondido
Village all the way to Barron Park. The Palo Alto
emergency lines were so inundated with complaint
calls that if there had been a real emergency and
somebody had tried to call 911, they wouldn t have
been able to get through." he said.

A representative of the Palo Alto Dispatch Cen
ter said the center only records the first one or two
calls for a particular incident. Three or four lines
would have to be kept busy to keep the Stanford
area's 911 emergency circuit jammed, the repre
sentative said.
Moore said officers at the scene shut the Rinc-a
delt party down at 1 1:30 instead of simply warning
students partly because of the high number of com
plaints and partly because officers could not find
anyone to take responsibility for keeping the noise
down. He said officers might have allowed the
party to continue about 15 minutes longer had stu
dents' attitudes been different.
"Those guys were totally uncooperative. Three
sergeants spent 25 minutes trying to rationalize
with the people, and what they got was animosity
and belligerence."
But Rinconada residents said police did not give
the dormitory a chance to reduce the noise level.
"If they gave us some warning, maybe we could
have turned the speakers or something, and the
party could have gone on longer," said Rinconada
freshman Bret Caldwell.
"We think 11:30 is a ridiculous time to shut
down a party," Caldwell said. Dormitory residents
want to see guidelines set up so students can at
tempt to lower the noise level of parties before
police shut them down.
Most Escondido residents contacted by The
Daily said they did not notice Saturday's party or
were not bothered by it. but some residents of the
houses and condominiums on the south side of
campus said the Rincodelt party was loud enough
to be a nuisance.
"It was incredibly loud," said Philosophy Prof.
Jon Barwise. a resident of the Peter Coutts con
dominiums. "It woke up my kids and my wife. It's
the first time we've ever been woken up like that."
Most people contacted said they are usually not
bothered by campus parties. Lydia Baker, who

lives off Campus Drive East, said, "If it were all
day and all night for three days, I would complain.
But the noise doesn't last long, so I'm not going to
complain."
Several residents of faculty housing said students
have in the past delivered notices to them in ad
vance of parties, an action which they appreciated.
"The notices would just say, 'There's going to be
a party tomorrow night, so if it's too loud don't call
the police, call us.' I thought it was very urbane,"
said one resident of Alvarado Way.
Mike Resnick, resident assistant at Twain, said
the dormitory distributed similar notices to Croth
ers and Crothers Memorial residents to warn them
about upcoming performances of the play. He said
conversations with Crothers and Crothers
Memorial residents made him doubt that police
had received the number of complaints they
claimed.
Moore said the Florence Moore and Twain inci
dents were examples of police and students
working problems out in a reasonable way. Resnick
agreed, saying he has talked to Moore about ways
to reduce the noise from the play's band.
But Resnick said the confrontation between
police and students Tuesday night was "kind of
nasty." "Fifteen residents were arguing with the of
ficer. which is the best way to get a police officer
riled. He told us he didn't even know if a compro
mise could be effected [for the performances]."
Residents of Rinconada said police threatened
students and a band member with arrest, but
Moore said the account residents gave to The Daily
was not accurate. Moore said two students were ad
monished by police officers only after the students
harassed the officers. "One guy grabbed an offi
cer's pen from him. Another was drinking beer and

shouting in the officers face."
Moore said the band's drummer
was not threatened at all.
Police "don't go out trying to close
parties," Moore said. He added,
"We're in a damned-if-you-do,
damned-if-you-don't situation."
The valve stems were removed
from three squad cars parked at Rin
conada between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m.
Police said they do not know if the
vandal was a dorm resident.

party at 5:30 p.m.
• Outdoor rehearsals for a dorm musical at Twain
were stopped by police at midnight Monday and 1 I
p.m. Tuesday after complaints from residents of
Crothers and Crothers Memorial dormitories.
Some Rinconada residents complained of police
heavy-handedness and insensitivity in breaking up
their party, but Stanford Police Capt. Marvin
Moore said dormitory residents — not police offi
cers — acted unreasonably.
"It's not very considerate to start an outdoor
party with a live band at 10 at night." Moore said.
"People were deluged with noise from Escondido
Village all the way to Barron Park. The Palo Alto
emergency lines were so inundated with complaint
calls that if there had been a real emergency and
somebody had tried to call 911, they wouldn t have
been able to get through." he said.

A representative of the Palo Alto Dispatch Cen
ter said the center only records the first one or two
calls for a particular incident. Three or four lines
would have to be kept busy to keep the Stanford
area's 911 emergency circuit jammed, the repre
sentative said.
Moore said officers at the scene shut the Rinc-a
delt party down at 1 1:30 instead of simply warning
students partly because of the high number of com
plaints and partly because officers could not find
anyone to take responsibility for keeping the noise
down. He said officers might have allowed the
party to continue about 15 minutes longer had stu
dents' attitudes been different.
"Those guys were totally uncooperative. Three
sergeants spent 25 minutes trying to rationalize
with the people, and what they got was animosity
and belligerence."
But Rinconada residents said police did not give
the dormitory a chance to reduce the noise level.
"If they gave us some warning, maybe we could
have turned the speakers or something, and the
party could have gone on longer," said Rinconada
freshman Bret Caldwell.
"We think 11:30 is a ridiculous time to shut
down a party," Caldwell said. Dormitory residents
want to see guidelines set up so students can at
tempt to lower the noise level of parties before
police shut them down.
Most Escondido residents contacted by The
Daily said they did not notice Saturday's party or
were not bothered by it. but some residents of the
houses and condominiums on the south side of
campus said the Rincodelt party was loud enough
to be a nuisance.
"It was incredibly loud," said Philosophy Prof.
Jon Barwise. a resident of the Peter Coutts con
dominiums. "It woke up my kids and my wife. It's
the first time we've ever been woken up like that."
Most people contacted said they are usually not
bothered by campus parties. Lydia Baker, who

lives off Campus Drive East, said, "If it were all
day and all night for three days, I would complain.
But the noise doesn't last long, so I'm not going to
complain."
Several residents of faculty housing said students
have in the past delivered notices to them in ad
vance of parties, an action which they appreciated.
"The notices would just say, 'There's going to be
a party tomorrow night, so if it's too loud don't call
the police, call us.' I thought it was very urbane,"
said one resident of Alvarado Way.
Mike Resnick, resident assistant at Twain, said
the dormitory distributed similar notices to Croth
ers and Crothers Memorial residents to warn them
about upcoming performances of the play. He said
conversations with Crothers and Crothers
Memorial residents made him doubt that police
had received the number of complaints they
claimed.
Moore said the Florence Moore and Twain inci
dents were examples of police and students
working problems out in a reasonable way. Resnick
agreed, saying he has talked to Moore about ways
to reduce the noise from the play's band.
But Resnick said the confrontation between
police and students Tuesday night was "kind of
nasty." "Fifteen residents were arguing with the of
ficer. which is the best way to get a police officer
riled. He told us he didn't even know if a compro
mise could be effected [for the performances]."
Residents of Rinconada said police threatened
students and a band member with arrest, but
Moore said the account residents gave to The Daily
was not accurate. Moore said two students were ad
monished by police officers only after the students
harassed the officers. "One guy grabbed an offi
cer's pen from him. Another was drinking beer and

shouting in the officers face."
Moore said the band's drummer
was not threatened at all.
Police "don't go out trying to close
parties," Moore said. He added,
"We're in a damned-if-you-do,

Students and Stanford police officers are sched
uled to meet this afternoon with Norm Robinson,
associate dean of Student Affairs for Residential
Education, to discuss a perennial problem that
resurfaced last weekend — party noise.
Robinson said the purpose of the public meeting,
to be held at 5 p.m. in the conference room on the
third floor of Old Union, is to work out ways to
ensure outdoor parties are not shut down.
The meeting was spurred by several incidents in
which police halted parties last weekend:
• Rinconada's annual outdoor Rinc-a-delt party
for charity was halted at 1 1:30 p.m. Saturday by
campus police, who said they had received up to
100 complaints about loud music. Party organizers
complained because they paid the band Wire Train
$1,000 to play at the party, only to have the police
halt the band a few minutes into its performance.
• Sunday afternoon, police officers stopped the
Florence Moore Hall's outdoor Miller High Life
party at 5:30 p.m.
• Outdoor rehearsals for a dorm musical at Twain
were stopped by police at midnight Monday and 1 I
p.m. Tuesday after complaints from residents of
Crothers and Crothers Memorial dormitories.
Some Rinconada residents complained of police
heavy-handedness and insensitivity in breaking up
