Korean students storm U.S. facility
SEOUL, South Korea — Dozens of South Korean students invaded
the U.S. Information Service building in Seoul, barricaded themselves in
the library and shouted accusations yesterday that the United States
supports a "military dictatorship" in their country.
They began their takeover Wednesday and vowed a hunger strike "to
the end" to achieve their demands.
Early in the invasion, the protesters put signs in windows threatening
to leap ou» of the four-story building or take poison if South Korean
authorities sought to remove them by force.
The students — estimated to number from 60 to 70 — seized the li
brary and plastered second-story windows with placards and papers.
They scattered leaflets demanding that the U.S. government
"apologize to the Korean people for approving the Kwangju massacre
. . . and . . . withdraw support of the present military regime which was
the chief plotter."
The demands centered on the fifth anniversary of what now is known
as the Kwangju incident, a bloody uprising that began in that southern
provincial capital soon after the government declared martial law on
May 18, 1980. It took nine days for troops to put down the uprising. The
government now says 191 people died at Kwangju. Dissidents and
human rights groups put the toll higher.
U.S. officials have denied consistently there was any U.S. involvement
or responsibility for what took place at Kwangju.
Korean students have a long history of confronting governing authori
ties. In 1960, a student uprising helped bring down the government of
the late President Syngman Rhee. Students have tried to carry on that
tradition under the rule of the late President Park Chung-hee and now
that of Chun Doo-hwan. Throughout this spring there have been almost
daily street confrontations between students and police.
American Embassy officials and students alike said the current dem
onstrators do not appear to have weapons or explosives. The officials
made it clear from the start there was no hostage situation. U.S. person
nel could move about inside the building and were free to leave and en
ter as they desired.
One U.S. official, who like the others spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the students were clustered around chanting slogans,
singing protest songs and filling the library room with cigarette smoke.
In Washington, Larry Speakes, White House deputy press secretary,
who identified the protesters as medical students, said that "our people
there have encouraged dialogue."
Student demands included a meeting with U.S. Ambassador Richard
Walker and the domestic and foreign press. A sign said those inside the
library were on a hunger strike and would "fast to the end."
Camp battle continues in Lebanon
BEIRUT — Shiite Moslem militiamen and Palestinian guerrillas
struggled for control of Beirut's refugee camps yesterday, fighting from
house to burning house. Dozens of bodies lay in the streets.
Police said at least 188 people had been killed and about 1,000
wounded since the battle began Sunday, but the Red Cross and officials
on both sides said dozens of the dead were uncounted and still had not
been collected from the battle areas.
The guerrillas fought desperately, often hand-to-hand, but were en
circled by the militiamen and Shiite soldiers of the Lebanese army who
are determined to keep the Palestinian fighters from re-establishing
themselves in this war-ravaged country.
Guerrilla gunmen, pressed into a small defensive area in the Sabra and
Chatilla camps of west Beirut, fired through holes knocked through the
walls of tin-roofed houses turned into sandbagged fortresses.
"It's a horrific tragedy. They're pulverizing the camps, house by
house, with heavy artillery and tank cannon. Dozens of bodies are lying
on the streets. They won't let the Red Cross in," a Palestinian spokes
man said.
Shiite militiamen poured machine-gun fire and rocket-propelled
grenades into the sprawling Bourj el-Barajneh camp in south Beirut, but
made no attempt to move in.
In Christian east Beirut, thousands of people gathered at the Virgin
Mary Maronite church for a funeral Mass for 37 men, women and
children killed when a car packed with explosives blew up Wednesday at
a busy intersection.
Police initially reported 60 killed and 190 wounded in the bombing in
a street in the Sin el-Fil district. They said later they had recovered only
37 bodies, and 21 people were missing and believed dead.
Palestinian gunners on hills east of the city poured rocket and'artillery
fire into Beirut for the second day in an effort to take the heat off the
guerrillas, who have vowed to fight "to the last drop of our blood."
Many of the 120,000 refugees who normally live in the three camps
have fled, mainly to Druse-held areas in Beirut and the mountains to the
east.
Puerto Rico voices U.S. aid concerns
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Some leading Puerto Ricans are con
cerned that people here have become too dependent on aid from the
United States and that only harm can come of it.
At least two of them — a political scientists and an economist — main
tain that social assistance from Washington has resulted in loss of in
centive and that the U.S. Commonwealth is becoming a tropical ghetto
of crime, unemployment and reliance on the federal dole.
An economic slump has hit Puerto Ricans who had lived through the
"Operation Bootstrap" boom era that brought them dramatically im
proved living standards.
Despite a high unemployment rate, few Puerto Ricans today will take
menial, low-paying jobs. Much of the labor in the sugar cane fields or
other such areas is done by illegal aliens from the nearby Dominican
Republic.
Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon says Washington has been historically
generous with aid to its Caribbean cousin, but that more attention must
be paid to helping the island become "self-sustaining."
Political scientist Jorge Heine has written that "the Puerto Rican
miracle has turned into Welfare Island U.S.A." Economist Jaime San
tiago Melandez has said Washington could be faced with a "South Bronx
of the Caribbean."
Egypt foils bomb attempt
( AIRO — Egypt foiled a Libyan plot to blow up an embassy with a
truck bomb, the government said yesterday. The target was not named
by authorities, but a government-owned newspaper said it was the U.S.
Embassy.
I he operation had been planned for Wednesday, but was discovered
months earlier, according to the Interior Ministry announcement. It said
an official of Libyan intelligence promised an agent $500,000 to do the
job.
Hundreds of policemen closed off several blocks around the American
mission in the Garden City district Wednesday, causing rush-hour traffic
jams through the heart of Cairo. Witnesses and police on the scene said
the security operation focused on the U.S. Embassy.
In Washington. White House spokesman Larry Speakes said yester
day that American officials were working closely with Egyptian authori
ties. "We have taken appropriate security measures." he said.
I wo police generals said the agent was "under control." presumably
meaning in custody.
It was the third alleged Libyan terror plot in six months said to have
been thwarted by the Egyptians.
I he Interior Ministry statement said the plan involved Libya, a Syria
based terrorist group and a third country in which the Libyan intelli
gence official was stationed. That country was not named.
It said a green Czechoslovak-made Skoda pickup was to have been
rigged into a truck bomb carrying 185 pounds of plastic explosives that
would have been detonated outside the embassy at a time of heavy traf
fic.
The newspaper Al-Akhbar said in its Friday edition that it had
learned that'the U.S. Embassy was the intended target. It did not give a
source for its report.
Al-Akhbar identified the Syria-based organization as the "Abu-
Nidal" group, a radical Palestinian faction opposed to Yasser Arafat's
leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
