# Places premium on relocating missile
## Senate votes to cut MX plan 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The Senate voted over
whelmingly yesterday to cut President Reagan's
MX missile program in half unless the Pentagon
finds a new home for the much-debated nuclear
weapon.
The 78-20 vote ended three days of intense
negotiations between the White House, Senate
Republicans and Senate Democrats over a
Democratic-led plan to scale back the MX program
in the latest Capitol Hill tight over the weapon.
The plan, accepted by Reagan earlier in the day,
provides that only 50 MX weapons can be
deployed in existing Minuteman silos in Wyoming
and Nebraska, rather than the 100 missiles Reagan
wanted in the long-running fight over the weapon.
The scaled-down MX program was thus made
part of a bill authorizing Pentagon spending for
next.year. The House has yet to vote on its version,
but is considering a limit of only 40 MX weapons.
Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), author of the Demo
cratic plan to cut MX that would have originally
limited deployment to only 40 MX weapons, said,
"I don't think there is any question that the presi
dent is making a substantial change in his MX pro
gram."

Reagan, in a statement issued at the White
House, said the compromise "represents a biparti
san expression of continuing support for our strate
gic modernization program."
Under the compromise, only 12 MX weapons
would be built next year instead of the 48 Reagan
wanted, Nunn said. Any deployment of the MX
beyond a total of 50 would be in a new basing plan
other than the Minuteman silos.
While Nunn's proposal didn't specifically pro
pose killing the missile, the Pentagon has been
unable to come up with an acceptable basing plan
other than Minuteman silos.
Earlier, White House spokesman Larry Speakes
said, "We are a few votes short . . . and are not
certain that we are going to be able to close the
gap"
Reagan has said 100 of the 10-warhead missiles
should be put into Minuteman silos in Wyoming
and Nebraska starting next year.
All 47 Democrats planned to vote for Nunn's
plan along with enough of the 53 Republicans to
provide a majority, according to congressional
sources who spoke on condition they not be identi
fied.

Nunn's amendment was offered two days ago to
a bill authorizing most of a record Pentagon budget
of $302 billion next year. The House is considering
a smaller defense budget, but its proposal also
would limit overall MX deployment to 40 missiles.
Congress has already approved 42 MX weapons,
and Reagan proposed 48 more next year. But the
bill on the Senate floor cuts that to 21, and Nunn's
amendment would trim that down to 12. Any
missiles beyond the 40 deployed would be used as
spares.
In debate on the Senate floor yesterday, the MX
issue quickly developed political heat.
"American national security issues have been
politicized for partisan reasons," said Sen. Steven
Symms (R-Idaho). "This is being made blatantly
partisan."
"Today will tell the story," said Sen. Dan Quayle
(R-Ind.). "Either we vote for the MX or we kill it. I
think capping it kills it. I hope we can work it out.
But if we can't, the nation is going to know who
killed MX, who voted to weaken our position at the
(arms control) bargaining table."
