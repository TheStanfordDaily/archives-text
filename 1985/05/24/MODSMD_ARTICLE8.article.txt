# Condition of septuplets improves
## 
### 
ORANGE — Five of the six
surviving Frustaci septuplets im
proved yesterday as their astonished
mother got her first good look at
them on television and asked, "Are
these really my babies?"
"I have a smile on my face today,"
Dr. Carrie Worcester said as she an
nounced that one of the girls had
shown "marked improvement," while
the conditions of the second girl and
three of the boys had improved some
what since Wednesday.
The smallest baby, a 1-pound boy
nicknamed "the little Peanut" by
doctors and nurses, showed neither
improvement nor deterioration, said
Worcester, director of newborn in
tensive care at Children's Hospital of
Orange County.
The babies continued battling
heart, lung and liver problems and
were listed in critical but stable condi
tion, as they have been since Tuesday

morning when 30-year-old Patricia
Frustaci delivered them along with a
stillborn girl. She had taken a fertility
drug.
Doctors said all the ailments were
expected in such premature infants,
who were given a 50-50 chance of
survival by Worcester.
By yesterday morning, each of the
six received two doses of the drug in
domethacin for patent ductus ar
teriosis, in which a duct between the
aorta and pulmonary artery fails to
close, allowing blood to flood the
lungs. The duct normally closes right
after birth in full-term children, but
the Frustaci infants were born 12
weeks premature.
Frustaci previously got a brief
glimpse of her babies on a videotape
showing their transfer between St.
Joseph Hospital, where they were
born, and the adjacent Children's
Hospital. But she had her first good

look yesterday morning by watching
news broadcasts, said Tes Pane,
obstetrical nursing director at St.
Joseph.
"Her response was — she was as
tounded," the nurse said. "She asked
me, 'Are these really my babies?' "
Frustaci, a high school English
teacher who lives in Riverside with
her husband, Samuel, and 14-month
old son, Joseph, was in good condi
tion at St. Joseph. She should be able
to visit her babies for the first time
today.
Meanwhile, made-for-TV movies,
commercials, books, even dolls based
on the six surviving septuplets of
Samuel and Patricia Frustaci could be on
the way, the family's attorney said
yesterday.
"It's strictly print at this point," at
torney and family friend Andrew
Wallet said of his negotiations with
various media. "I'm talking to

people, trying to get things done. I
don't want to discuss that at this
point."
Wallet said he has negotiated with
People magazine and the National
Enquirer for the story rights and will
seek book and film rights and
product-endorsement deals for the
family.
"I would like to see made-for-TV
type things. Certainly books are not
out of the realm of possibility. We're
looking at commercials and any other
plausible use of media," he said.
"Everything we can possibly do."
Do the Frustaci's want all this
publicity?
"Certainly we want to try to keep
this as normal as possible, but we
have to look at reality," Wallet said.
"They have six children, of course
seven total, and that is certainly a
major event and certainly an expen
sive event."
