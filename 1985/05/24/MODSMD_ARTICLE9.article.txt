Women smokers at risk
CHICAGO — Women under age 50 who
smoke heavily may be seven times more likely to
have a heart attack than non-smokers, and their
risks are even higher if they also take birth con
trol pills, a new study says.
Compared to non-smokers using oral con
traceptives, women who smoke 25 cigarettes or
more daily and take the pill had 23 times the risk
of a heart attack, the study said.
The findings are in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association, which is devoted
to health problems associated with tobacco
smoking.
House OKs budget plan
WASHINGTON — Thi- Democratic
controlled House yesterday approved a
leadership-backed 1986 federal budget that
would cut spending by $56 billion without raising
taxes or curtailing Social Security benefits.
The vote was 258-170.
A House-Senate conference committee will
have to reconcile differences between the spend
ing outline approved today with the version ap
proved earlier this month in the Republican-run
Senate.

The Senate budget would also save roughly
$56 billion in 1986, but through deeper cuts in
domestic programs — including elimination of
next year's Social Security cost-of-living increase.
By contrast, the House budget takes a $6 bil
lion deeper bite out of defense spending.
Final passage came after two days of floor
debate during which Democratic leaders success
fully fended off efforts from both parties to make
major modifications in the plan.
Counselors aid farmers
WALTHILL, Neb. — Judy Dye, whose family
was forced to sell its own farm, now tries to help
others avoid the same fate by answering the Farm
Crisis Hotline five days a week.
The telephone service provides financial, legal
and emotional counseling and is the foundation
of a statewide network developed to help farmers
surmount the depressed agricultural economy.
Fourteen other states, mostly in the Midwest,
have crisis hotlines. Nebraska's is unique because
of the broad range of counseling it offers,
Dye said.
The Nebraska hotline was started eight months
ago by the Farm Families Crisis Council, a group

of 50 representatives of the state Department of
Agriculture, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Ex
tension Service, Nebraska Farm Organizations,
Legal Aid Society of Omaha and farm lenders.
The council is sponsored by the Interchurch Min
istries of Nebraska, an ecumenical group.
"Farmers are becoming known as 'the new
poor,'" said Kathleen Severens, the coordinator
for the crisis council. "We're trying to keep as
many viable farms as possible and save farmers as
far as their emotional well-being."
Stocks post loss
The stock market posted its second straight
loss yesterday, continuing its retreat from the
record highs it reached early in the week.
Bank stocks were the most prominent targets
of sellers in a moderately active session.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell
7.05 to 1,296.71, bringing its loss to 12.99 points
since it reached a record closing high of 1,309.70
on Tuesday.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
came to 101 million shares, against 101.37 mil
lion Wednesday.
