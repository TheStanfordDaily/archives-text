COME CELEBRATE
KEPLER'S
30th ANNIVERSARY
In May, 1955 Roy Kepler ushered in the Bay Area's paperback
revolution by opening the first paperback bookstore on the San
Francisco peninsula.
Throughout the years, the bookstore has been a reflection of Roy
Kepler's dedication to the concept of free speech and the right to
free inquiry. The bookstore carries a vast selection of titles, span
ning the centuries of all the best that has been thought, written
and lived.
Saturday, June Ist, 2-6 p.m., Roy Kepler, his family, staff
and friends will celebrate the 30th anniversary of Kepler's Books
and Magazines.
We are offering a 30% discount on all books in
stock the day of the party.
