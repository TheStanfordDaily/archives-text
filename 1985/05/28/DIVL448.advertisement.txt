ROOM ASSIGNMENT PROCEDURES
FOR AUTUMN QUARTER 1985-86
All room assignments, including the assignment of single rooms,
trailers, and apartments, are made by local residence offices and
individual houses. Although some residences may elect to make
room assignments prior to Autumn Quarter, such assignments
should be regarded as tentative until students move into their
residences next fall.
Listed below are room assignment meeting times and procedures
for some residences. For residences not listed, please contact the
residence office to inquire about room assignment procedures.
PLEASE NOTE: Attending a room assignment meeting does not
confirm your housing assignment. You must complete Draw Two or
Three and sign a Residence Agreement to accept your assignment.
