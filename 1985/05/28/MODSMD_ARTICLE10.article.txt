# Reagan speaks on tax reform plan

### 
ORLANDO, Fla. â€” President
Reagan told a throng of youths at
Disney World yesterday that his tax
reform plan will usher in "a new
American revolution" that will make
their families wealthier and their
futures brighter.
Reagan used a colorful Memorial
Day event at the amusement park as
the backdrop for a week-long blitz of
speeches and trips to build popular
support for the tax overhaul plan he
will unveil tonight.
Earlier, he began the annual obser
vance in honor of the nation's war
dead by laying a wreath at the Tomb
of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington
National Cemetery outside the na
tion's capital.
Reagan appeared to wipe a tear

from his eye while an Army bugler
played "Taps" during the brief,
solemn ceremony at the cemetery,
where 192,000 are buried.
There was a 21-gun salute to the
war dead shortly before Reagan's
motorcade arrived. About 200
people watched the ceremony. After
the president placed the wreath, there
was a moment of silence, a muffled
drum roll and the playing of "Taps."
He did not speak.
Reagan and his wife, Nancy, then
flew to Orlando, Fla., for a reunion
with some of the high school bands
that missed his second inauguration,
when frigid temperatures forced can
cellation of the inaugural parade.
In remarks prepared for delivery.

he said, "Tomorrow evening I will
address the nation about a dramatic
new proposal to reform our tax sys
tem. It is a proposal intended to
launch a new American reovlution
and to give to you as you come of age
a nation of ever greater freedom,
vitality and strength."
Reagan praised American innova
tion and perseverance and lauded the
creativity of Walt Disney as an exam
ple of a farm boy who made good
with an idea others ridiculed.
"Professionals in the field made
fun of the idea, and to produce his
first cartoons, the young man had to
sell or pawn virtually everything he
owned," said Reagan. "But today 57
years later, this man and his creation
have become permanently fixed in

the history of our popular culture. His
name was Walt Disney, his little crea
ture Mickey Mouse."
Reagan said he wants to revise the
tax system to keep alive that spirit of
determination. "Just as the American
people rebelled against oppressive
taxation some two centuries ago, the
reform that 1 will propose tomorrow
will represent a dramatic effort to
make our tax code more simple, effi
cient and fair and place more re
sources into the hands of your
families and, ultimately, you your
selves."
The president is scheduled to un
veil his plans for overhauling the na
tion's complex tax code in a
nationwide broadcast address
tonight.
