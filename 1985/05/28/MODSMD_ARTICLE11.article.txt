Volcano watched closely
VANCOUVER, Wash. — Earthquakes con
tinued rumbling within Mount St. Helens as sci
entists ventured into the steaming crater by
helicopter yesterday to gauge the chances of an
explosive eruption.
The scientists could feel some of the larger
quakes, which registered 2 to 3 on the Richter
scale, said Steve Brantley of the U.S. Geological
Survey.
That development signaled an "exponential in
crease" in the energy released by the volcano, he
said, adding that such increases have in the past
indicated an eruption within hours.
However, he cautioned, "All of the eruptions
are a little bit different."
There was no evidence of prominent or active
rockfalls, and clean snow flanking the base of the
growing lava dome inside the crater walls and on
the mountainside indicated there had been no
ash bursts, Brantley said.
Cardinals rap abortion
VATICAN CITY — Celebrating their first
Masses as cardinals, Archbishops John O'Connor
of New York and Bernard Law of Boston yester
day vowed to press their battle against abortion.
Keeping up the fight "will not be without
pain," O'Connor said during his homily in the
Basilica of Sts. John and Paul, filled with several
hundred pilgrims who had come from the United
States to see him elevated May 25 as one of 28
new cardinals.
In St. Peter's Basilica, hundreds of people from
the Boston area burst into applause when Law
said, "There can be only one Catholic position on
abortion.

"If we don't respect the rights of the unborn,
we will unravel the seamless garment of all
human rights," including the right to adequate
housing, work and a decent life, Law said.
During the 1984 U.S. presidential campaign,
O'Connor criticized Catholic politicians who he
felt did not speak out strongly against abortion.
Law said in his homily, delivered at the Altar
of the Chair of St. Peter in the huge basilica, that
to "harbor feelings of racism or anti-Semitism"
was "incompatible" with Christian beliefs.
O'Conner told his congregation that "there are
those who would foster tensions between Jews
and Christians, and between Christian bodies."
TMI restart discussed
WASHINGTON — After six years of
hearings, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is
preparing to decide whether power may again be
produced at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant,
scene of an accident that panicked a small Penn
sylvania town and riveted the nation's attention.
But the prospect of an immediate restart has
united a Republican governor and anti-nuclear
activists in opposition. They are vowing a long
court fight if the commission votes tomorrow, as
the opponents anticipate, to remove orders
keeping the undamaged Unit 1 reactor dormant.
Civil disobedience is also planned. Three Mile
Island Alert, a citizen group spearheading the ef
fort to keep the plant closed, has scheduled a
rally tomorrow night opposite the plant gate.
"There will be arrests, it's just a question of how
many," said the group's spokesman, Eric
Epstein.
By the plant management's count, the commis

sion has evaluated more than 3,000 pleadings
and held scores of hearings generating over
30,000 pages of transcripts involving TMI since a
combination of mechanical failure and human er
ror caused the Unit 2 reactor to overheat danger
ously on March 28, 1979.

Jet exit safety probed
WASHINGTON — Few noticed last fall when
the government approved the elimination of two
of the 10 emergency exits on Boeing 747 jumbo
jets, but now safety advocates, flight attendants
and some members of Congress are in an uproar.
The case of the disappearing doors also has put
the Federal Aviation Administration in the
peculiar predicament of endorsing an aircraft
design change, but, at the same time, warning
airlines they would be wise not to go along for
safety reasons.
"It's the most disturbing step backward in
cabin fire safety in recent years," declared Matt
Finucane, director of air safety for the Associa
tion of Flight Attendants, which represents
21,000 members at 14 airliners.
"A 20 percent reduction in the number of exits
on aircraft which are known to carry in excess of
400 passengers hardly seems appropriate," com
plained Rep. James Oberstar (D-Minn.), chair
man of subcommittee that oversees FAA activi
ties.
But FAA Administrator Donald Engen has
responded that his hands are tied on the matter
because federal regulations require only that
there be two doors capable of evacuating 110
passengers in 90 seconds. Boeing officials argued
that the 747s carry no more than 440 passengers
and that tests have shown that eight doors meet
the federal requirement.

airlines they would be wise not to go along for
safety reasons.
"It's the most disturbing step backward in
cabin fire safety in recent years," declared Matt
Finucane, director of air safety for the Associa
tion of Flight Attendants, which represents
21,000 members at 14 airliners.
"A 20 percent reduction in the number of exits
on aircraft which are known to carry in excess of
400 passengers hardly seems appropriate," com
plained Rep. James Oberstar (D-Minn.), chair
man of subcommittee that oversees FAA activi
ties.
But FAA Administrator Donald Engen has
responded that his hands are tied on the matter
because federal regulations require only that
there be two doors capable of evacuating 110
passengers in 90 seconds. Boeing officials argued
that the 747s carry no more than 440 passengers
and that tests have shown that eight doors meet
the federal requirement.
