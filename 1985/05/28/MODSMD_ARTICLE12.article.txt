Aliens in hunger strike
EL CENTRO — About 300 aliens at a federal
detention center in El Centro apparently began a
hunger strike yesterday over conditions at the
center, but the action was denied by a center em
ployee.
A detention officer at the facility said no
hunger strike was in progress, while a law student
working on behalf of the detainees said the action
began at 6 a.m.
The hunger and work strike at the Alien
Detention Facility and Processing Center was
called to protest crowding and poor sanitation,
said Shari Cruhlac.
"About 300 people are involved in the hunger
strike and they are giving the INS until 10 a.m.
Wednesday to decide whether to meet their con
ditions," said Cruhlac, a San Francisco law stu
dent working with the Imperial Immigration
Project. The church-backed project provides free
legal services to refugees from Central Amcrica
and other countries.
About 500 male aliens, mostly from Mexico
and Latin America but also from Surinam, China
and European countries, are housed at the
facility while awaiting the outcome of their ap
peals to remain in the United States, said Mic
helle Crawford, staff attorney for California
Rural Legal Assistance.
Crawford said thfc detainees want better medi
cal care, more toilets, sinks and soap and access
to air-conditioned barracks during the day.

'Star Wars' defended
LOS ANGELES — Studies to learn if
America can be shielded against Soviet missiles
are ethical and logical, the government's chief
"Star Wars" scientist said yesterday.
Gerold Yonas, the top scientist at the Pent
agon's Strategic Defense Initiative Organization,
also said Congress should fund President
Reagan's entire $3.7 billion request for Star
Wars research in fiscal year 19H6. Senate and
House committees already have voted deep cuts.
"The purpose of this research program is to
give a future president, a future Congress, the
basis for a decision" on whether it is feasible to
build an anti-missile defense system, Yonas said
during an American Association for the Ad
vancement of Science panel discussion.
End to cemetary strike?
OAKLAND — A tentative agreement has
been reached in a 2-month-old strike by 69
workers at eight East Bay cemeteries, a union of
ficial announced last night.
Union members voted to "accept manage
ment's latest offer if amnesty is granted to strik
ing employees," said Joan Twomey of Cemetery
Workers and Green Attendants Local 265.
No details of the agreement will be released
until management "acts on the amnesty issue,"
she added.

The strike forced some family members to
bring rakes and shears along with flowers when
they visited neglected graves to mark Memorial
Day yesterday.
Septuplets improve
ORANGE — Patricia Frustaci was "much
happier after touching her five surviving sep
tuplets for the first time, and hospital officials
canceled a news briefing yesterday because the
premature infants were making such good prog
ress.
Neonatologist Dr. David Hicks told reporters
Sunday that the babies' greatest problem contin
ued to be their inability to produce a substance
necessary to keep their lungs from collapsing.
The condition is called hyaline membrane
disease, and is common in premature infants,
whose lungs are among the last organs to mature
before birth.
