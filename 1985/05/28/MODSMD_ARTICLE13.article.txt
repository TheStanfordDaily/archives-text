Dear Bug Me,
Why does it say "Extreme Danger"
next to the running path around
Lagunita near the golfing area? Am I
going to be blown up as I jog by? Or
just bombarded with golf balls? - A
concerned senior
You know, I think Mr. Rogers
would say that signs are our friends.
Remember the stoplight from when
you used to watch his show as a kid?
Don't you think you're a better
driver now for knowing that red
means you should stop and green
means you should probably keep
going unless you want to get rear
ended? I know 1 am.

Phil Marrone, an assistant profes
sional at the Stanford Golf Course, is
a lot like Mr. Rogers in this case. He
says the sign means just what it says,
which is a lot more straightforward
than a stoplight's symbolic colors. 1
mean, a flashing red light could be
saying anything — "You have a
message waiting at the lobby desk,"
or "Jack will take your order now,"
or even the classic "Lonely, sailor?"
However, I suppose if you're the
intellectual sort you wouldn't just be
satisfied by being on your best fight
or-flight behavior when encountering
extreme danger, even in written form,
but would want to know what type of
predator was making you run the
other way as fast as your Adidas
could carry you.
Your conjecture about kamikaze
golf balls is actually pretty good, ac
cording to Marrone.
The driving range tees are about
300 yards away from the sign you
mention. Mow, the average golfer will
have a range of about 200 to 220
yards; but golf team members, who
have no specific hours for practice,
can easily launch a mini-satellite this
distance.
In other words, there is no way to
predict when someone could be mis
taking your head for the 18th hole.
Maybe they should have put up a
sign that said "Sporadic Danger," for
accuracy's sake, but it just wouldn't
have the same imperative quality. I
picture clouds of pollen instead of
bombs exploding, like you suggested.
I think if the University were con
ducting strip mining operations be
hind Elliot Program Center, we

would have more than a sign for
warning, though.
Why is the garbage collected at 2
a.m.? Who gets it? - Meri McCoy
I thought about calling Orson
Welles and asking him the optimal
time for gathering one's garbage, but
I wimped out.
I could just picture his prehensile
eyebrows lurching at me as he
intoned, "1 will tell no secret before
its time. You just have to know these
things."
Then I looked in the phonebook to
see if there is an Ernest and Julio
Sanitation Service or something,
thinking it would be funny if they
could comment on the crucial picking
season for ripe Domino's boxes, but
no such authority was to be found.
Louie Pellegrini, general manager
of Peninsula Sanitary, was willing to
explain the practices of his company,
which serves the University as its only
client, and has been doing so since
before 1957.
Three trucks follow their nocturnal
trails each night, sniffing out decay
and corruption in this fine academic
community, making the campus safe
for good hygiene and also waking a
few of us in the process, judging from
your question.
They start covering the academic
areas of campus at 1 or 2 a.m. to
avoid making noise while classes are
meeting during the day. Then they
split up to canvas the living areas of
campus, usually working between 5
and 9 a.m., according to Pellegrini.
It's a mystery to me why you were
bothered by the trucks unless you
sleep in the History Corner, which is
not the most unusual crime in
studious circles.
If you're too drowsy to follow the
trucks to find out where all our
garbage goes, I can explain that part
of it. The solid waste goes to the Palo
Alto's landfill.
Pellegrini said his company has
employed this schedule for the past
year and a half with fewer complaints
than when they collected dorm trash
before midnight and after 9 a.m.
I didn't ask him if they consulted
Welles in formulating this plan.
Why are the campus police so zealous
in enforcing parking regulations
everywhere except in front of the Ad
ministrative Services Annex? -
Puzzled
The area you describe is part of the
medical center's parking, which, ac
cording to Capt. Willian Wullschleger
of the Stanford Police Department, is
patrolled by one lone parking officer.
"We've got fairly large beats. He
doesn't get there (to the annex) every
day, but he does check it from time to

time," he explained.
If you feel you've been cheated out
of a ticket, I'm sure the police would
consider a donation to some charity
due penance; but if you're mad be
cause competitors for your preferred
parking places aren't being punished
when they go over the posted time
limits, then maybe vigilante action is
in order.
Most cars like that have convenient
windshield wipers that are just per
fect for securing irate notes.
I won't write you a sample one. I'm
sure you get the idea. If these drivers
complain to the police, maybe they
will start patrolling the area in ques
tion and your problem will be solved.
Football is almost here and spring

football practice has already begun at
most colleges. It seems that you
haven't printed a thing about the foot
ball team and what we can be looking
forward to this year, especially the new
recruits. So how about it, pal? - War
ren Young
I haven't printed anything about
spring practice because it ended a few
weeks ago with the alumni game,
which the current Stanford team won
whompingly. (Maybe you can tell
why they don't encourage me to write
sports around here. I tend to go wild
with my adjectives.)
I called Tony Samuel, the defensive
line coach, and he said the usual
things about recruits — "They all
have some promise" — and about
spring practice — "We had a good

spring. When you're working hard
and having fun things go fast."
I talked to redshirt freshman Barry
McKeever, who lives in my dorm,
about your question, and he too said
some usual things — "We accom
plished a lot of things we wanted to
do. We're really young and we have a
long way to go."
What he means by being really
young, I gather, is that lots of seniors
are graduating this year, five alone
from the defensive line, and the
replacements that have been
recruited are obviously less experi
enced.
He also said something unusual —
"I'm surprised that this guy is asking
this question because most people
don't show much interest in spring

practice.
I'm assuming this is different from
the ordinary line athletes give
reporters, just like I assumed that the
other statements were standard,
partly because 1 too am wondering
why you're interested in this ques
tion.
It also confuses me that you wrote
all the way from Los Angeles to ask
about this issue. I'd send you a white
rose or something for being the
longest distance reader if it were in
the Bug'Me budget, but I'm a little
worried about your motives. Are you
a spy from USC?
A wise man once asked, "So how
about it, pal?"
