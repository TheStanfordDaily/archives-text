The East Palo Alto Community Law Project
celebrated its first anniversary last week. The
project deserves praise not only because it has
provided free legal services to more than 800
people, but also because it has worked seriously
at gaining acceptance from the East, Palo Alto
community.
Several years ago, some Stanford law students
saw the need for legal services in East Palo Alto
and also saw that law students could use more
hands-on experience. Students raised $350,000
from attorneys and private foundations and were
able to open the project in an old Victorian house
in central East Palo Alto.
Currently, more than 100 law students volun
teer their time to the project. The majority of the
work done there involves tenant-landlord rela
tions, juvenile justice and government benefits
like food stamps, welfare, Social Security and dis
ability programs.
To the credit of the people involved in the
project, they did not start out assuming they
knew exactly what the community needed and
how to help. Instead, they spent months talking
to the leaders of the community and residents
about the problems they faced. They also spent a
lot of time talking to people about how to let city
residents know they existed. Many projects
similar to the one in East Palo Alto have died

simply because people didn't realize what they
offered or feel comfortable utilizing their
services.
Certainly the project has improved the rela
tionship between a wealthy university and an im
poverished city. Students working at the project
have also benefited. They have gained experience
working in the legal field and have been sen
sitized to the problems that poorer segments of
our society face with laws and programs that may
or may not have been designed to help them.
In September, the educational merit of the
project will be evaluated by the law school fac
ulty. If the reaction is positive, the University will
sponsor a massive fund-raising effort that will es
tablish the project as a permanent fixture in the
city.
As more and more East Palo Alto residents
look to the law project for legal counsel, the need
to secure a stable financial base for it will in
crease. September isn't that far away, and a
greater awareness of the project's achievements
now would do much to help the law students and
the community they serve.
The East Palo Alto Community Law Project is
an example of the type of public service we think
Stanford should support. It has provided needed
services and, with University help, will
become a permament fixture and not just a short
term experiment.
