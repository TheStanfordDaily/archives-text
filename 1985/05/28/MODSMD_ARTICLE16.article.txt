## Industry works to squelch revolution

We should all thank Bill Evers for his column
( The Daily. May 6), which provided much needed
political and economic background on South
Africa's system of apartheid, loosely and inac
curately translated as segregation but with different
connotations than the term used here. Apartheid
makes integration against the law, as opposed to
unlawful but accepted discrimination. But I would
like to address the issue Evers only touched upon,
the issue of total divestment, and respond to the
answers he put forth.

VIEWPOINT

Total divestment of University stock in compan
ies which conduct business in South Africa has the
primary purpose, apart from dealing with the moral
questions involved, of persuading these companies
to cease their business activities in the white-ruled
country. While no one disputes the fact that the
apartheid system denies South African blacks fun
damental human rights and should be replaced with
black majority rule, the harmful aspects of foreign
corporate investment in South Africa and the link
between divestment and an improvement in the sit
uation for blacks has not been investigated.
As the January 1978 report of the Senate Sub
committee on Africa states, "The net effect of
American investment has been to strengthen the
economic and military self-sufficiency of South
Africa's apartheid regime." One need not look
very hard to understand why U.S. investments
strengthen the apartheid economy and increase the
white government's ability to maintain its power by
concentrating in such crucial areas as automobiles,
oil and energy and computers. U.S. automobile in
dustries manufacture cars and trucks used by the
police and military. Under the National Key Points
Act, the minister of defense can declare any area or
place a national Key Point and require the owner,
such as Ford or Chrysler, to provide security
measures in cooperation with the South African
Defense Force. General Motors even prepared se
cret contingency plans in 1977 to cooperate with
the South African government "in the event of civil
unrest" which stated that "vehicles may be taken
over for civil defense purposes." These corpora
tions present a very real threat to the struggle
against oppression now and in the event of an

uprising against the white government.
Other U.S. industries also help support the
apartheid regime. IBM has supplied computers
which guide South African missiles, keep files on
all adult black males and maintain the pass laws,
laws which require all blacks over age 16 to carry
an identification passbook at all times. Control
Data Corp. has sold equipment to the South
African police. Exxon, Mobil, Texaco and Standard
Oil of California together supply 50 percent of
South Africa's petroleum market, in violation of an
OPEC oil embargo established against South
Africa in 1973. A large fraction of these sales go to
South African military and police forces, and these
corporations have stated their willingness to main
tain this supply even in the event of an interna
tional oil embargo. Fluor Corporation of California
is providing $4.2 billion worth of coal-to-oil con
version plants. These plants will help the South
African government become energy self-sufficient
in order to eliminate the threat of international
sanctions against the apartheid system.
This is what U.S. corporate presence does in
South Africa. !n fact, there is an alarming correla
tion between increased U.S. investment and es
calating oppression of blacks in South Africa. Since
1960, U.S. investments there have tripled. This
presence has greatly increased the repressive
powers of the apartheid state, as a quick look at
changes in the political situation for blacks will
show. Since 1961, laws have been enacted allowing
people to be detained without trial for increasingly
longer periods of time. Previously people had to be
charged within 48 hours of arrest, but since 1963 at
least 5,000 people have been detained without
trial. Government power to ban people and restrict
their activities without trial has grown, and more
than 1,400 people have been banned or banished
since 1961. More than 8 million people have been
arrested or prosecuted under the pass laws since
1961, and more than 1 million have been deported
to the Bantustan regions from urban areas.
But in order to support total divestment, one
must be sure that such a move would not hurt
South African blacks more than it would help
them. One very important consequence of total
divestment would be to deal a serious blow to the
confidence of the ruling majority. As the South

African minister of industries, commerce and
tourism, has said, "If the opposition has doubts
about the future of South Africa, I can only say our
confidence in our country is borne out by the num
ber of foreign investors."
These foreign investors develop key industries,
like the energy, automobile and computer indus
tries, which are impossible to develop within South
Africa due to a relative shortage of skilled workers
and the limited growth of a large internal market,
side effects of the apartheid economy. Without the
U.S. oil companies, it is doubtful that South Africa
could withstand the OPEC oil embargo; without
Fluor Corp.'s technological expertise and equip
ment, the apartheid regime's drive toward self
sufficiency would be crippled; and without
computer technology, for which South Africa is
completely dependent on the United States, the en
forcement of the apartheid system, and the entire
economy, would die.
Total divestment is an effective way for Stanford
and all of the United States to voice opposition to
the apartheid regime and undermine its power.
Other strategies, such as corporate compliance with
the Sullivan principles, require no change in the
fundamental structure of the apartheid system and
make no demand for black political rights. Some
question whether Stanford divestment will lead to
corporate withdrawal, but Citicorp withdrew from
South Africa when the state of New York
threatened to divest $1 billion of their stock. In
light of the widespread protests in universities
throughout the country and considering their huge
stock holdings in companies doing business in
South Africa, it seems clear that divesting this stock
will bring similar results.
Divestment is the way to proceed if the Stanford
community is truly concerned with ending the
apartheid system and establishing black majority
rule. The unique aspect of a protest movement such
as this one is the opportunity it provides for learn
ing. I invite all those interested to come to the In
ner Ouad and read such material as the pamphlet
compiled by the Stanford Coalition Against Apart
heid, "South Africa: the UC Connection," and a
variety of other informative material.
