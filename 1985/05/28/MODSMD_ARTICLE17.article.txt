Concerned i parties 9
We would like to apologize to all
of the people who were disturbed
last Saturday evening due to noise
from the Rinc-a-delt party. We did
not realize until very late that our
party was so loud, and we regret that
we did not have an opportunity to
remedy the situation earlier in the
evening. Due to the large number of
complaints received by the police, it
is very evident that our party con
tained "extremely loud amplifica
tion." However, we feel that the
situation was not handled properly
by the police. Our main complaint is
that we were not given the opportu
nity to remedy the situation. At no
point in time were we given any
option that would allow the party to
continue. The police arrived. The
party was over.
When the police arrived at 11:15
p.m., we were told that 60 to 100
complaints had been filed against us.
The police were there with one
purpose â€” to shut the party down.
We offered to turn the volume down,
to redirect the speakers and even to
shut down half of the PA system, but
the officers were adamant. They
wouldn't listen to reason.
We respect the rights of the sur
rounding communities but resent the
attitude with which the police han
dled the situation. Had the police
come to us after the first few com
plaints. we could have easily ad
dressed the problem, making both
the community and ourselves happy:
The community would not have been
subjected to noise late into the even
ing. and we would have been able to

continue our party. A more
reasonable approach by the police
would have made all "parties" con
cerned happier.

Stigmatizing slogans
I am offended by the insulting
language created by self
perpetuating campus "awareness"
groups in order to characterize those
who fail to unquestioningly accept all
items on their agendas. Not only are
most of us. according to these groups
and the passive consensus they and
The Daily have manipulated,
chauvinistic raping conformist apa
thetic racist anti-Semitic
homophobes, but according to Mario
Huerta ("The social dynamics of
bathroom sex" The Daily, May 20)
we are "heterosexists." The Daily
certainly would not print an article
or editorial referring to homosexuals
as "queers," yet The Daily encour
ages "awareness" by allowing certain
groups to use powerfully negative
slogans in order to close the issues
and lie publicly with impunity about
anyone who fails to kowtow to their
conforming and intolerant citadels of
linguistic deftness.
So much for freedom of speech. In
fact, if The Daily had its way, not
only would we all think alike, but we
would all be identical: "with GLAS
at the forefront . . . this struggle for
total equality will go on until it is
finally won" ("Celebrating with
GLAS," Daily editorial. May 6).
Maybe it will be won. when we all
become oppressed Daily-reading
feminist non-conformist politically
active Black Jewish homosexuals
fighting for total divestment, animal

rights and abortion. But until then,
must we use stigmatizing "open
minded" slogans as a faddish cover
up for our authoritarian narrowing of
dialogue? If so, shouldn't we con
tinue the campaign further, and label
all dissent "prejudice," all differ
ences of opinion "inequality" and
any freedom of choice
"discrimination"?

Equal work for units
When 1 shared my opinions with a
Daily reporter about the compara
tive workloads of humanities stu
dents and technical and science
students (The Daily, May 16), I
expected to receive a lot of criticism
from my friends. I said some pretty
controversial things. I believe the
popular conception that "fuzzy
people do no work, or less work than
techie people," is nonsense. I ex
plained to The Daily's reporter that
the type of work people do for
humanities and social sciences classes
may look less grueling than the type
of work people do for technical and
science classes, but that it actually
involves the same amount of energy.
Humanities and social science
classes require that the students
taking them actually think. Thinking
about an issue involves a lot more
energy than number-crunching or
puzzle-solving. Also, because think
ing doesn't take up discrete blocks of
time like solving a problem set does,
humanities and social science stu
dents cannot add up the amount of
time they spend on their classes the
way a technical or science student
can. I can't go to the library, leave at

midnight, and say, "I thought about
philosophy for five hours," the way a
techie can say, "The problem set this
week takes six-and-a-half hours." If
humanities and social science stu
dents actually counted the hours they
spend thinking about their classes,
discussing them at dinner, bringing
up different ideas after class and so
on, I believe they would be able to
say that they work just as hard for
their classes as technical and science
students do.
I spent more than half an hour
explaining this position to The
Daily's reporter, and so I was very
surprised when friends of mine with
fuzzy majors took me to task over
what I said in The Daily. Not only
was the one quotation taken from
my interview out of context, it was
thoroughly misconstrued. The
Daily's reporter had asked me how it
was that I thought fuzzy people
could take 20 units of classes and
still survive while engineers consid
ered a load of 16 units to be an
absolute maximum, given that I
thought fuzzies and techies did equal
work for equal units. I explained that
toward the end of a 20-unit quarter,
"there is a blow-off level," where
you decide to let one of your classes
slide. I suppose one can make a valid
logical inference from the statement
that when you have to, you can let
one class slide, all classes are expen
dable (as I was quoted to have said),
but that's certainly not what I meant
to say. I think it was obvious from
the position I had taken during the
interview that the statement The
Daily published was inconsistent
with my beliefs.
