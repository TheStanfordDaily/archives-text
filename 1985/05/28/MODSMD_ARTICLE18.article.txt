## A
						smooth transition will not be possible 
### 
This is in regard to the article titled
"Stanford South Africans respond"
(The Daily, May 8). I would specifi
cally like to respond to some of the
remarks made by anonymous white
South African students. One white
South African reportedly said, "the
idea of divestment is to start a revolu-

VIEWPOINT

tion. . . . It's not a nice idea to
promote violence. ... I think many
blacks are happy. The system of
gradual change works."
For 300 years, black Azanians have
had their heads kicked in, have had
their mothers and sisters raped, have
watched their children die of starva
tion, have had their throats slit, have
been debased, humiliated, vilified,
oppressed and exploited . .. and the
process continues. And now at Stan
ford. representatives of the fascist
South African regime ask for a sys
tem of gradual change. They claim
that "it's not a nice idea to promote
violence." I couldn't agree more. The
revolution that will overthrow the
fascist South African regime is not a
means of promoting violence. Rather,
it is a means of ending 300 years of
violence perpetuated on black
Azanians. Let me suggest that it is to
tally absurd to expect a smooth
transition in South Africa after 300
years of genocide. As Bishop Des
mond Tutu pointed out, it is not a
question of whether South Africa will
have a bloody revolution. "It is a
question of when and how bloody."
The only way, as far as I can see, of
avoiding an overly bloody revolution
is for the whites in South Africa to
pack their bags and leave. If they
think they can live in liberated
Azania and maintain the same life
style they have had for 300 years,
they suffer from illusions and hal
lucinations. And if they think "many
blacks are happy" in South Africa, I
suggest they sign up for intensive psy

chiatric treatment.
And the wife of this white South
African student suggests that, "The
big solution in South Africa will be
education." This is blatant racism. It
implies either that black Azanians
will not be able to manage their na
tion if the white masters leave, or it
implies that education will bring
down the system of apartheid. The
first option requires no response
other than to reiterate the recom
mendation of psychiatric care. As to
the second interpretation, let me
point out that white South Africans
are some of the most educated people
in the world.
And then she suggests that students
are protesting "to solve their own
psychological problems." Let me say
that it is students who aren't protest
ing that have psychological problems.
It is they who are emotional, irra
tional and overly subjective. For it is
an objective, rational analysis of the
fascist oppression in South Africa
that leads us to protest and cry out in
mortification. Even as we enjoy a
game of tennis, watch the Super
Bowl, listen to soap operas, have a
glass of beer at the Coffee House, dis
cuss how popular computer dating
has become and decide to pull an "all
nighter" for the economics exam to
morrow, hundreds of blacks have
died in South Africa.
As a final note, let me say that The
Daily's front-paging of the racist
views of anonymous white South
Africans is not a reflection of the
freedom of speech existing in this
country, but rather of the collabora
tion of the media in this nation with
the racist South African regime. For
why else would a newspaper publish
views of representatives of a fascist
regime that has been declared il
legitimate by the whole world?
