# Card locks up trip to Omaha

### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
In his final game at Sunken Dia
mond, Stanford pitcher Jeff Ballard
saved the best for last, leading the
Cardinal to a 7-1 win over Pep
perdine and into the College World
Series for the third time in the past
four years.
The Waves' 5-1 win over the Card
inal on Sunday made yesterday's
game a must-win situation, but as it
has done all season, Stanford came
through when it had to.
While the Pepperdine pitching staff
wilted under the strain of playing five
games in four days, Ballard got
stronger and stronger, retiring the last
20 men to face him.
"This is one of the most satisfying
wins I've ever had, certainly this year,
and maybe throughout my career,"
Ballard said.
"It was a fantastic performance by
Jeff Ballard today," Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said. "He's our ace
and did a super job."
The key to Ballard's success was his
ability to control and mix his pitches.
"I was able to throw my slider on 2-1
or 3-1," he said. "They couldn't sit on
any one pitch."
Brad Bierley gave Pepperdine a
brief 1-0 lead with a homer to right
center in the second, but Stanford
tied it in the third. With Ruben

Amaro on second, Pete Stanicek
smashed a line drive off the leg of
Wave starter Tony Lewis and into left
field for a run-scoring single.
Ballard and Lewis traded goose
eggs for the next two innings, but
Stanford went ahead to stay in the
sixth. After Amaro started the inning
with a single, Mark Davis chopped a
hit-and-run single to right, putting
runners at the corners with no outs.
Rick Lundblade nailed Lewis' next
offering into right-center for an RBI
single. Mike De√üenon sacrificed the
runners to second and third, then
Walt Harris gave Stanford a 3-1 lead
with a sacrifice fly.
"Mark's hit really changed the mo
mentum." Lundblade said. "We
knew when it was 3-1, we were in
good shape."
"It's funny how when we got those
runs in the top of the sixth, I felt a
little bit stronger," Ballard said.
Stanford broke the game open in
the seventh. The Cardinal's four-run
outburst made the score 7-1 and can
celed Pepperdine's flight plans to
Omaha faster than any airline strike
ever could.
