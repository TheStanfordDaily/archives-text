# Card locks up trip to Omaha
## 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
In his final game at Sunken Dia
mond, Stanford pitcher Jeff Ballard
saved the best for last, leading the
Cardinal to a 7-1 win over Pep
perdine and into the College World
Series for the third time in the past
four years.
The Waves' 5-1 win over the Card
inal on Sunday made yesterday's
game a must-win situation, but as it
has done all season, Stanford came
through when it had to.
While the Pepperdine pitching staff
wilted under the strain of playing five
games in four days, Ballard got
stronger and stronger, retiring the last
20 men to face him.
"This is one of the most satisfying
wins I've ever had, certainly this year,
and maybe throughout my career,"
Ballard said.
"It was a fantastic performance by
Jeff Ballard today," Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said. "He's our ace
and did a super job."
The key to Ballard's success was his
ability to control and mix his pitches.
"I was able to throw my slider on 2-1
or 3-1," he said. "They couldn't sit on
any one pitch."
Brad Bierley gave Pepperdine a
brief 1-0 lead with a homer to right
center in the second, but Stanford
tied it in the third. With Ruben

Amaro on second, Pete Stanicek
smashed a line drive off the leg of
Wave starter Tony Lewis and into left
field for a run-scoring single.
Ballard and Lewis traded goose
eggs for the next two innings, but
Stanford went ahead to stay in the
sixth. After Amaro started the inning
with a single, Mark Davis chopped a
hit-and-run single to right, putting
runners at the corners with no outs.
Rick Lundblade nailed Lewis' next
offering into right-center for an RBI
single. Mike Deßenon sacrificed the
runners to second and third, then
Walt Harris gave Stanford a 3-1 lead
with a sacrifice fly.
"Mark's hit really changed the mo
mentum." Lundblade said. "We
knew when it was 3-1, we were in
good shape."
"It's funny how when we got those
runs in the top of the sixth, I felt a
little bit stronger," Ballard said.
Stanford broke the game open in
the seventh. The Cardinal's four-run
outburst made the score 7-1 and can
celed Pepperdine's flight plans to
Omaha faster than any airline strike
ever could.
John Ramos, the regional's Most
Valuable Player, led off the inning
with a line drive homer to left. After

walked, Pat Dubar replaced Lewis on
the mound. Dubar immediately
walked Mark Machtolf to load the
bases, bringing Mike Fetters out of
the Pepperdine bullpen.
Unfortunately for the Waves, Fet
ters was not the same pitcher he was
when he throttled the Cardinal on
tour hits the previous day. Fetters

walked Davis to force in a run, then
gave up a long sacrifice fly to
Lundblade.
A walk to Deßenon reloaded the
bases and sent Fetters to the dugout.
His replacement, Victor Rollo, issued
another free pass, this one to Harris,
allowing Machtolf to stroll across
with the game's final run.
Even after Sunday's loss, when
nearly every hard-hit ball was

gobbled up by a Pepperdine infielder,
Stanford was confident it would
bounce back. "We were getting a
little frustrated yesterday," Amaro
said. "But we got a couple to go
through today."
"If you look at our schedule, no
one has beaten us twice in a row,"
Davis said. "Their bubble had to
break."
"After yesterday's game, we were a

little worried," Verducci said. "But
today we were looser than loose; guys
were grab-assing and stuff."
Ballard's presence on the mound
was also a confidence-builder. "Jeffs
just a pleasure to play behind," Davis
said. "He just goes out and wins."
"Ballard — he's just awesome,"
Amaro said.
"Awesome" would be a pretty
good description of Fetters' perfor
mance on Sunday. The sophomore
right-hander silenced the Stanford
bats as few pitchers have been able to
do in 1985. Although he did walk
seven batters, Fetters never walked
more than one in an inning on his way
to his 10th win of the year.
"It was basically fastball in and
slider away," Fetters said. "I tried to
pitch to my strength, not their weak
nesses. I wanted to see if they could
hit my pitch."
"Considering the circumstances, I
can't think of a better-pitched game
against us all year long," Marquess
said.
Lundblade put Stanford ahead 1-0
in the top of the first with an RBI
single, but Pepperdine came back
with two in the bottom of the inning.
Nezi Balelo hit Rob Wassenaar's
second pitch over the fence in left for
a game-tying homer. Then, after
singles by Steve Erickson and Bier
ley, Paul Faries' single to center gave
the Waves a lead they never relin
quished.
According to Marquess, Wassenaar
did "a real fine job," but Faries gave
the Cardinal right-hander problems
all afternoon. The Wave third
baseman followed his first-inning hit
with an RBI double in the fourth and
another run-scoring single in the
seventh.

Cliffhanger. Barnburner. Thriller.
Not one of these terms can even
begin to do justice to the game Stan
ford and Nebraska played on Satur
day. The two teams exchanged dra
matic comebacks all day until Ramos'
two-run single in the ninth gave the
Cardinal a 9-8 win.
The victory put Stanford in the
enviable position of having to win
only one of its final two games to ad
vance to the College World Series —
a fact not lost on Nebraska Coach
John Sanders. "This was a winners'
bracket game, a game where the win
ner really has control coming out of
it,"he said. "It's hard, but that's
baseball."
A throwing error by Verducci gave
the Cornhuskers a 5-4 lead in the
seventh, but with two on and two out
in the bottom of the inning, Deßcnon
came off the Cardinal bench and
slammed a three-run homer off the
scoreboard in left-center.
However, Nebraska came back
with a three-run outburst of its own in
the eighth. The key hit was a two-run
single to center by third baseman
Burt Beattie off Lee Plemel.
Reliever Bill McGuire, who began
the game as the Cornhuskers'
catcher, handled the Cardinal without
incident in the eighth, sending many
of the 3,500 fans home. But, as
anyone who has followed Stanford
this season can attest, this Cardinal
team is never dead until the final out
has been officially recorded.
After Deßenon and Harris walked
to start the ninth, Toi Cook moved
the runners up with a perfect sacrfice
bunt. With the hot-hitting Ramos (6-
for-8 in the tournament) due up. an
intentional walk seemed imminent,
but Sanders decided to let McGuire

pitch to Ramos if he wanted to. He
did.
On a 1-2 slider, Ramos poked a
single into right field. Pinch runner
Kevin Kunkel scored the tying run
easily, but right fielder Jeff Carter
made a strong throw that beat Harris
to the plate.
However, Harris laid a shot on
catcher Mark Kister that would have
made Jack Elway, for whom Harris
plays in the fall as a defensive back,
proud. Not bothering to slide, Harris
smashed right into Kister, jarring the
ball loose to score the winning run.
"I was kind of determined to
score," Harris said in a mild under
statement. "I didn't want to see a
hand up to stop me. As soon as I saw
it get past the second baseman, 1
knew 1 was going to score."
" 1 was expecting the strikeout pitch
away," Ramos said. "It was a pretty
good pitch."
There were a few good pitches
thrown in Stanford's 17-3 bombing of
Oregon State on Friday, most of them
by Ballard, who pitched the first six
innings to pick up the win.
The Beavers were able to stay close
in the early innings, but the Cardinal
exploded for seven runs in the fourth.
The big blow was Davis' three-run
triple to left-center that finished the
day for OSU starter John Sipple.
"It was something off speed,"
Davis said. "1 was looking for some
thing high or slow, and it was both."
The most important development
of the game was that Stanford was
able to pull Ballard early. "Ballard!
threw less than 80 pitches, so if it's'
necessary for him to relieve on Sun
day or to start on Monday, he can do
it no problem," Marquess proph
esized.

little worried," Verducci said. "But
today we were looser than loose; guys
were grab-assing and stuff."
Ballard's presence on the mound
was also a confidence-builder. "Jeffs
just a pleasure to play behind," Davis
said. "He just goes out and wins."
"Ballard — he's just awesome,"
Amaro said.
"Awesome" would be a pretty
good description of Fetters' perfor
mance on Sunday. The sophomore
right-hander silenced the Stanford
bats as few pitchers have been able to
do in 1985. Although he did walk
seven batters, Fetters never walked
more than one in an inning on his way
to his 10th win of the year.
"It was basically fastball in and
slider away," Fetters said. "I tried to
pitch to my strength, not their weak
nesses. I wanted to see if they could
hit my pitch."
"Considering the circumstances, I
can't think of a better-pitched game
against us all year long," Marquess
said.
Lundblade put Stanford ahead 1-0
in the top of the first with an RBI
single, but Pepperdine came back
with two in the bottom of the inning.
Nezi Balelo hit Rob Wassenaar's
second pitch over the fence in left for
a game-tying homer. Then, after
singles by Steve Erickson and Bier
ley, Paul Faries' single to center gave
the Waves a lead they never relin
quished.
According to Marquess, Wassenaar
did "a real fine job," but Faries gave
the Cardinal right-hander problems
all afternoon. The Wave third
baseman followed his first-inning hit
with an RBI double in the fourth and
another run-scoring single in the
seventh.

Cliffhanger. Barnburner. Thriller.
Not one of these terms can even
begin to do justice to the game Stan
ford and Nebraska played on Satur
day. The two teams exchanged dra
matic comebacks all day until Ramos'
two-run single in the ninth gave the
Cardinal a 9-8 win.
The victory put Stanford in the
enviable position of having to win
only one of its final two games to ad
vance to the College World Series —
a fact not lost on Nebraska Coach
John Sanders. "This was a winners'
bracket game, a game where the win
ner really has control coming out of
it,"he said. "It's hard, but that's
baseball."
A throwing error by Verducci gave
the Cornhuskers a 5-4 lead in the
seventh, but with two on and two out
in the bottom of the inning, Deßcnon
came off the Cardinal bench and
slammed a three-run homer off the
scoreboard in left-center.
However, Nebraska came back
with a three-run outburst of its own in
the eighth. The key hit was a two-run
single to center by third baseman
Burt Beattie off Lee Plemel.
Reliever Bill McGuire, who began
the game as the Cornhuskers'
catcher, handled the Cardinal without
incident in the eighth, sending many
of the 3,500 fans home. But, as
anyone who has followed Stanford
this season can attest, this Cardinal
team is never dead until the final out
has been officially recorded.
After Deßenon and Harris walked
to start the ninth, Toi Cook moved
the runners up with a perfect sacrfice
bunt. With the hot-hitting Ramos (6-
for-8 in the tournament) due up. an
intentional walk seemed imminent,
but Sanders decided to let McGuire

pitch to Ramos if he wanted to. He
did.
On a 1-2 slider, Ramos poked a
single into right field. Pinch runner
Kevin Kunkel scored the tying run
easily, but right fielder Jeff Carter
made a strong throw that beat Harris
to the plate.
However, Harris laid a shot on
catcher Mark Kister that would have
made Jack Elway, for whom Harris
plays in the fall as a defensive back,
proud. Not bothering to slide, Harris
smashed right into Kister, jarring the
ball loose to score the winning run.
"I was kind of determined to
score," Harris said in a mild under
statement. "I didn't want to see a
hand up to stop me. As soon as I saw
it get past the second baseman, 1
knew 1 was going to score."
" 1 was expecting the strikeout pitch
away," Ramos said. "It was a pretty
good pitch."
There were a few good pitches
thrown in Stanford's 17-3 bombing of
Oregon State on Friday, most of them
by Ballard, who pitched the first six
innings to pick up the win.
The Beavers were able to stay close
in the early innings, but the Cardinal
exploded for seven runs in the fourth.
The big blow was Davis' three-run
triple to left-center that finished the
day for OSU starter John Sipple.
"It was something off speed,"
Davis said. "1 was looking for some
thing high or slow, and it was both."
The most important development
of the game was that Stanford was
able to pull Ballard early. "Ballard!
threw less than 80 pitches, so if it's'
necessary for him to relieve on Sun
day or to start on Monday, he can do
it no problem," Marquess proph

When Jeff Ballard made the Cardinal's trip to Omaha, Neb., official by striking out Pepperdine's Andy
Stankiewicz yesterday, his jubilant teammates stormed the field.
In his final game at Sunken Dia
mond, Stanford pitcher Jeff Ballard
saved the best for last, leading the
Cardinal to a 7-1 win over Pep
perdine and into the College World
Series for the third time in the past
four years.
The Waves' 5-1 win over the Card
inal on Sunday made yesterday's
game a must-win situation, but as it
has done all season, Stanford came
through when it had to.
While the Pepperdine pitching staff
wilted under the strain of playing five
games in four days, Ballard got
stronger and stronger, retiring the last
20 men to face him.
"This is one of the most satisfying
wins I've ever had, certainly this year,
and maybe throughout my career,"
Ballard said.
"It was a fantastic performance by
Jeff Ballard today," Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said. "He's our ace
and did a super job."
The key to Ballard's success was his
ability to control and mix his pitches.
"I was able to throw my slider on 2-1
or 3-1," he said. "They couldn't sit on
any one pitch."
Brad Bierley gave Pepperdine a
brief 1-0 lead with a homer to right
center in the second, but Stanford
tied it in the third. With Ruben

Amaro on second, Pete Stanicek
smashed a line drive off the leg of
Wave starter Tony Lewis and into left
field for a run-scoring single.
Ballard and Lewis traded goose
eggs for the next two innings, but
Stanford went ahead to stay in the
sixth. After Amaro started the inning
with a single, Mark Davis chopped a
hit-and-run single to right, putting
runners at the corners with no outs.
Rick Lundblade nailed Lewis' next
offering into right-center for an RBI
single. Mike Deßenon sacrificed the
runners to second and third, then
Walt Harris gave Stanford a 3-1 lead
with a sacrifice fly.
"Mark's hit really changed the mo
mentum." Lundblade said. "We
knew when it was 3-1, we were in
good shape."
"It's funny how when we got those
runs in the top of the sixth, I felt a
little bit stronger," Ballard said.
Stanford broke the game open in
the seventh. The Cardinal's four-run
outburst made the score 7-1 and can
celed Pepperdine's flight plans to
Omaha faster than any airline strike
ever could.
John Ramos, the regional's Most
Valuable Player, led off the inning
with a line drive homer to left. After
John Verducci singled and Stanicek

walked, Pat Dubar replaced Lewis on
the mound. Dubar immediately
walked Mark Machtolf to load the
bases, bringing Mike Fetters out of
the Pepperdine bullpen.
Unfortunately for the Waves, Fet
ters was not the same pitcher he was
when he throttled the Cardinal on
tour hits the previous day. Fetters

walked Davis to force in a run, then
gave up a long sacrifice fly to
Lundblade.
A walk to Deßenon reloaded the
bases and sent Fetters to the dugout.
His replacement, Victor Rollo, issued
another free pass, this one to Harris,
allowing Machtolf to stroll across
with the game's final run.
Even after Sunday's loss, when
nearly every hard-hit ball was

gobbled up by a Pepperdine infielder,
Stanford was confident it would
bounce back. "We were getting a
little frustrated yesterday," Amaro
said. "But we got a couple to go
through today."
"If you look at our schedule, no
one has beaten us twice in a row,"
Davis said. "Their bubble had to
break."
"After yesterday's game, we were a

little worried," Verducci said. "But
today we were looser than loose; guys
were grab-assing and stuff."
Ballard's presence on the mound
was also a confidence-builder. "Jeffs

made Jack Elway, for whom Harris
plays in the fall as a defensive back,
proud. Not bothering to slide, Harris
smashed right into Kister, jarring the
ball loose to score the winning run.
"I was kind of determined to
score," Harris said in a mild under
statement. "I didn't want to see a
hand up to stop me. As soon as I saw
it get past the second baseman, 1
knew 1 was going to score."
" 1 was expecting the strikeout pitch
away," Ramos said. "It was a pretty
good pitch."
There were a few good pitches
thrown in Stanford's 17-3 bombing of
Oregon State on Friday, most of them
by Ballard, who pitched the first six
innings to pick up the win.
The Beavers were able to stay close
in the early innings, but the Cardinal
exploded for seven runs in the fourth.
The big blow was Davis' three-run
triple to left-center that finished the
day for OSU starter John Sipple.
"It was something off speed,"
Davis said. "1 was looking for some
thing high or slow, and it was both."
The most important development
of the game was that Stanford was
able to pull Ballard early. "Ballard!
threw less than 80 pitches, so if it's'
necessary for him to relieve on Sun
day or to start on Monday, he can do
it no problem," Marquess proph
esized.
