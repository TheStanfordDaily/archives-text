## Emotions run high for Card 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
When Stanford beat Arizona
State to wrap up the Pacific 10
Southern Division title four weeks
ago, there was not exactly a wild
celebration in the Cardinal locker
room. The team had expected to
win, and when it did, it didn't get
too excited about it.
As Mark Davis said at the time,
"It was inevitable. It wasn't like
the last game and we had to win
it."
Against Pepperdine in the final
game of the NCAA West I
Regional, it was the last game, and
Stanford did have to win it if it
wanted a berth in the College
World Series.
To John Verducci, the team's
ability to win with its back to the
wall makes the victory a little
more special than any of the Card
inal's previous trips to the Series.
" This was a lot sweeter. Games
like this make you show your true
colors," he said. "This team has a
lot of character. We had to play
that extra game."
In contrast to the pennant
cliching win at Arizona State, the
Cardinal responded emotionally
when the final out had been re
corded yesterday. "My reaction
was to go straight to (Jeff) Ballard
and give him a hug," catcher John
Ramos said after snaring the pitch
that fanned Andy Stankiewicz to

end the game.
Ramos was joined shortly by his
teammates in a brief but enthusi
astic gathering around the
pitcher's mound. The tournament
MVP has been waiting for such a
moment since coming to the Farm
last year.
"This is great. Ever since I got
here, everyone's been talking
about Omaha and how awesome it
is," Ramos said. "Now it's finally
happening. It's so new, it's excit
ing."
Winning the tournament hasn't
quite hit Ruben Amaro yet. "It's
the first one for me," the sopho
more third baseman said. "It'll
sink in when I see those millions
— well, maybe thousands — of
fans in Omaha."
For a couple of Cardinal veter
ans, reaching this year's Series was
more personally rewarding than
any previous appearance. "This
one is a little more satisfying,
being my senior year," Verducci
said.
"It's what we've been shooting
for since Sept. 29," first baseman
Rick Lundblade said. "This one
means so much more. Two years
ago was sort of bittersweet. I
started the year catching, but I
gradually worked my way out of
the lineup. I really feel I've con
tributed to this team. It's nice to
