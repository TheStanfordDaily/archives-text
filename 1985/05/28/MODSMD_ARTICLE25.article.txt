# Pepperdine took long route

### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
While Stanford moved quickly into
the regional final by winning its first
two games, Pepperdine took a less
direct route â€” through the losers'
bracket.
After dropping a 4-2 decision to
Nebraska on Friday, the Waves came
back to eliminate Oregon State the
next day and the Cornhuskers Sunday
morning.
Pepperdine Coach Dave Gorrie
was widely second-guessed for not
using ace pitcher Scott Marrett in
Friday's tournament opener. "We
thought we would try to save Marrett
for Stanford with all their right
handed hitters," he said. "But there
won't be much saving from here on.
We're hanging on now by the skin of
our teeth."
The saving of Marrett ended on
Sunday. With the bases loaded and
one out in the second inning, the
Wave ace relieved starter Dave
Miramontes. Marrett would have
escaped the inning unscathed, but a
passed ball and an error allowed two
unearned runs to score.
Pepperdine took a 3-2 lead in the
fifth, but an RBI double by catcher
Bill McGuire put Nebraska back
ahead in the sixth.
Down to their last nine outs, the
Waves fought back. In the seventh,
Brad Bierley drove in the tying run
with single to right. Pepperdine took
the lead for good in the eighth when
Chad Kreuter bounced an RBI single
up the middle.
The Waves upped their lead to 7-4
with two unearned insurance run in
the ninth, and they needed both of
them, as Paul Meyers tagged Marrett

for a two-run, two-out homer in the
bottom of the inning, making the final
score 7-6.
Marrett, who won his 15th game of
the year without a loss, knew he
might be called on early. "I was told
that if he (Miramontes) got into any
kind of trouble, I'd be right in there. I
don't mind relieving," he said.
"This is a whole lot better than
packing up and going home," Gorrie
said.
Although he was about to pack up
and go home, Nebraska Coach John
Sanders showed a lot of class after
suffering his second straight one-run
defeat. The Cornhuskers had lost a 9-
8 heartbreaker to Stanford the previ
ous day.
"We played awfully hard through
this tournament, and I thought we
represented ourselves and our con
ference (the Big Eight) well,"
Sanders said. "I'm glad we had a
chance to be here."
A chance to be at Sunken Diamond
was about the only chance Oregon
State had all weekend. After being
pounded 17-3 by Stanford on Friday,
the Beavers were beaten less spec
tacularly but just as soundly by Pep
perdine the next day.
The Waves scored five runs in the
second inning to take a 6-0 lead and
end whatever suspense there may
have been in this game.
Steve Erickson led the Pepperdine
attack with a 3-for-3 day, including a
home run and two RBIs.
Marrett started for the Waves, but
with a six-run lead, Gorrie went to
Pat Dubar in the fourth. Dubar had
only pitched 12 and two-thirds in

Like Pepperdine second baseman Andy Stankiewicz, who couldn't
bring down this attempt to nail the stealing Rick Lundhlade, the Waves
gave it their best all weekend only to fall short in the finals.
