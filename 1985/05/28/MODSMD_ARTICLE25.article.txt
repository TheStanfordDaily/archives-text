# Pepperdine took long route
## 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
While Stanford moved quickly into
the regional final by winning its first
two games, Pepperdine took a less
direct route — through the losers'
bracket.
After dropping a 4-2 decision to
Nebraska on Friday, the Waves came
back to eliminate Oregon State the
next day and the Cornhuskers Sunday
morning.
Pepperdine Coach Dave Gorrie
was widely second-guessed for not
using ace pitcher Scott Marrett in
Friday's tournament opener. "We
thought we would try to save Marrett
for Stanford with all their right
handed hitters," he said. "But there
won't be much saving from here on.
We're hanging on now by the skin of
our teeth."
The saving of Marrett ended on
Sunday. With the bases loaded and
one out in the second inning, the
Wave ace relieved starter Dave
Miramontes. Marrett would have
escaped the inning unscathed, but a
passed ball and an error allowed two
unearned runs to score.
Pepperdine took a 3-2 lead in the
fifth, but an RBI double by catcher
Bill McGuire put Nebraska back
ahead in the sixth.
Down to their last nine outs, the
Waves fought back. In the seventh,
Brad Bierley drove in the tying run
with single to right. Pepperdine took
the lead for good in the eighth when
Chad Kreuter bounced an RBI single
up the middle.
The Waves upped their lead to 7-4
with two unearned insurance run in
the ninth, and they needed both of
them, as Paul Meyers tagged Marrett

for a two-run, two-out homer in the
bottom of the inning, making the final
score 7-6.
Marrett, who won his 15th game of
the year without a loss, knew he
might be called on early. "I was told
that if he (Miramontes) got into any
kind of trouble, I'd be right in there. I
don't mind relieving," he said.
"This is a whole lot better than
packing up and going home," Gorrie
said.
Although he was about to pack up
and go home, Nebraska Coach John
Sanders showed a lot of class after
suffering his second straight one-run
defeat. The Cornhuskers had lost a 9-
8 heartbreaker to Stanford the previ
ous day.
"We played awfully hard through
this tournament, and I thought we
represented ourselves and our con
ference (the Big Eight) well,"
Sanders said. "I'm glad we had a
chance to be here."
A chance to be at Sunken Diamond
was about the only chance Oregon
State had all weekend. After being
pounded 17-3 by Stanford on Friday,
the Beavers were beaten less spec
tacularly but just as soundly by Pep
perdine the next day.
The Waves scored five runs in the
second inning to take a 6-0 lead and
end whatever suspense there may
have been in this game.
Steve Erickson led the Pepperdine
attack with a 3-for-3 day, including a
home run and two RBIs.
Marrett started for the Waves, but
with a six-run lead, Gorrie went to
Pat Dubar in the fourth. Dubar had
only pitched 12 and two-thirds in

nings all season, hut he held the
Beavers to a run and two hits over the
last six innings as Pepperdine eruised
to a ft-1 win.
"I knew I had to go the distance
because I know that we need the
other guys rested for the remainder of
the tournament," Dubar said.
OSU Coach Jack Riley was at a
loss to explain the performance of his
team, which was completely out
classed in both its games. "It makes
me wonder what we have to do to
prepare our kids for this caliber of
plav." he said. "I felt we might be in
over our heads because of our lack of
pitching."
However, because there are no
seniors on this year's team, the future
looks a lot brighter than the present
for the Beavers. "They have a lot of
learning to do in playing and knowl
edge of the game and, in that sense,
this appearance is beneficial," Riley
said.
The decision not to start Marrett
on Friday was controversial, but it is

unlikely that even the brilliant Pep
perdine hurler could have outdueled
Nebraska's Jeff Mays, who stifled the
Waves with a seven-hit, nine
strikeout performance.
"I was mainly around the plate all
day. The key is throwing strikes."
Mays said. " This was my tirst nine
inning complete game this year, al
though I never had a doubt that 1
couldn't go nine."
Pepperdine scored its only two runs
in the eighth. With the bases loaded
and one out. Mays tried to pick Chris
Johnson off third, but his throw sailed
wide, allowing two runs to score. "1
gave them a gift," Mays said.
Even after the loss, Gorrie stuck by
his decision to start Smith. "Jon
Smith has been one of our very best
pitchers," he said. "We had 12 men
left on base in this game, and that's
criminal."
However, there were a couple of
people in cardinal and white who
didn't think Pepperdine showed
much respect for Nebraska. "They're
idiots, and you can quote me," Stan
ford's Mark Davis said. "They were
looking past a good team from a great
conference. That's stupid."

"I knew I had to go the distance
because I know that we need the
other guys rested for the remainder of
the tournament," Dubar said.
OSU Coach Jack Riley was at a
loss to explain the performance of his
team, which was completely out
classed in both its games. "It makes
me wonder what we have to do to
prepare our kids for this caliber of
plav." he said. "I felt we might be in
over our heads because of our lack of
pitching."
However, because there are no
seniors on this year's team, the future
looks a lot brighter than the present
for the Beavers. "They have a lot of
learning to do in playing and knowl
edge of the game and, in that sense,
this appearance is beneficial," Riley
said.
The decision not to start Marrett
on Friday was controversial, but it is

unlikely that even the brilliant Pep
perdine hurler could have outdueled
Nebraska's Jeff Mays, who stifled the
Waves with a seven-hit, nine
strikeout performance.
"I was mainly around the plate all
day. The key is throwing strikes."
Mays said. " This was my tirst nine
inning complete game this year, al
though I never had a doubt that 1
couldn't go nine."
Pepperdine scored its only two runs
in the eighth. With the bases loaded
and one out. Mays tried to pick Chris
Johnson off third, but his throw sailed
wide, allowing two runs to score. "1
gave them a gift," Mays said.
Even after the loss, Gorrie stuck by
his decision to start Smith. "Jon
Smith has been one of our very best
pitchers," he said. "We had 12 men
left on base in this game, and that's
criminal."
However, there were a couple of
people in cardinal and white who
didn't think Pepperdine showed
much respect for Nebraska. "They're
idiots, and you can quote me," Stan
ford's Mark Davis said. "They were
looking past a good team from a great
conference. That's stupid."
While Stanford moved quickly into
the regional final by winning its first
two games, Pepperdine took a less
direct route — through the losers'
bracket.
After dropping a 4-2 decision to
Nebraska on Friday, the Waves came
back to eliminate Oregon State the
next day and the Cornhuskers Sunday
morning.
Pepperdine Coach Dave Gorrie
was widely second-guessed for not
using ace pitcher Scott Marrett in
Friday's tournament opener. "We
thought we would try to save Marrett
for Stanford with all their right
handed hitters," he said. "But there
won't be much saving from here on.
We're hanging on now by the skin of
our teeth."
The saving of Marrett ended on
Sunday. With the bases loaded and
one out in the second inning, the
Wave ace relieved starter Dave
Miramontes. Marrett would have
escaped the inning unscathed, but a
passed ball and an error allowed two
unearned runs to score.
Pepperdine took a 3-2 lead in the
fifth, but an RBI double by catcher
Bill McGuire put Nebraska back
ahead in the sixth.
Down to their last nine outs, the
Waves fought back. In the seventh,
Brad Bierley drove in the tying run
with single to right. Pepperdine took
the lead for good in the eighth when
Chad Kreuter bounced an RBI single
up the middle.
The Waves upped their lead to 7-4
with two unearned insurance run in
the ninth, and they needed both of
them, as Paul Meyers tagged Marrett

for a two-run, two-out homer in the
bottom of the inning, making the final
score 7-6.
Marrett, who won his 15th game of
the year without a loss, knew he
might be called on early. "I was told
that if he (Miramontes) got into any
kind of trouble, I'd be right in there. I
don't mind relieving," he said.
"This is a whole lot better than
packing up and going home," Gorrie
said.
Although he was about to pack up
and go home, Nebraska Coach John
Sanders showed a lot of class after
suffering his second straight one-run
defeat. The Cornhuskers had lost a 9-
8 heartbreaker to Stanford the previ
ous day.
"We played awfully hard through
this tournament, and I thought we
represented ourselves and our con
ference (the Big Eight) well,"
Sanders said. "I'm glad we had a
chance to be here."
A chance to be at Sunken Diamond
was about the only chance Oregon
State had all weekend. After being
pounded 17-3 by Stanford on Friday,
the Beavers were beaten less spec
tacularly but just as soundly by Pep
perdine the next day.
The Waves scored five runs in the
second inning to take a 6-0 lead and
end whatever suspense there may
have been in this game.
Steve Erickson led the Pepperdine
attack with a 3-for-3 day, including a
home run and two RBIs.
Marrett started for the Waves, but
with a six-run lead, Gorrie went to
Pat Dubar in the fourth. Dubar had
only pitched 12 and two-thirds in

Like Pepperdine second baseman Andy Stankiewicz, who couldn't
bring down this attempt to nail the stealing Rick Lundhlade, the Waves
