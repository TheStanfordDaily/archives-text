# Ballard 'unbelievable' in win
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
It was just a matter of time before
Stanford's hitters caught up with Pep
perdine's pitchers yesterday in the
championship game of the NCAA
West 1 Regional.
That's the way Cardinal starting
pitcher Jeff Ballard figured it."I just
thought that if I could keep the game
close going into the late innings, our
hitters would catch up with their
pitchers," he said.
Ballard, a senior making his final
appearance at Sunken Diamond, did
that and more. The blond left-hander
not only kept the game close, he won
it.
Ballard completely shut down the
Waves, allowing them one run and
three hits. He struck out seven,
walked none and faced three batters
over the minimum, retiring the last 20
in order. From the third inning on. no
Pepperdine batter reached base.
All this on two days rest after
pitching six innings in Stanford's 17-3
victory over Oregon State in Friday's
first round of the regional.
"I had a little stiffness after Friday,
but I worked it out in the bullpen
before the game." said Ballard, who
tied a Stanford season record with his
14th win and was a unanimous choice
for the All-Tournament team. "I
haven't done that all year — throw six
innings and come back.
"But I was pretty confident that I
would be able to come back and pitch
well. I didn't know if I could go nine
innings, but my adrenaline was
pumping pretty good."

Pepperdine pitchers had similar
rest problems, only much worse. Be
cause the Waves lost their opening
game to Nebraska, they were forced
to play an extra game and conse
quently entered yesterday's contest
with a staff of tired arms.
"You've got to give them credit,"
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess said
of Pepperdine's pitchers. "They lost
that first game and here they are in
the final. And they have to be drop
ping down to their fifth or sixth guys
on the staff. Hats off to them."'
Stanford hitters didn't start catch
ing up with the exhausted Pepperdine
pitchers — one of whom threw nine
innings Sunday — until the sixth and
seventh innings. That was when the
Cardinal drew walk after walk from
four different Wave pitchers and
erupted for six runs.
"After the fourth inning, my arm
started to ache," Ballard said. "But
when we got those six runs in the
sixth and seventh, the adrenaline
started pumping, and I was all right.
Those big innings also gave me a
chance to rest a bit."
Both Marquess and Pepperdine
Coach Dave Gorrie said the differ
ence in the game was Ballard, whose
mixture of off-speed pitches kept
Pepperdine hitters off balance all af
ternoon.
"Ballard is just a great pitcher."
Gorrie said. "He's proved it all year.
He makes good pitches and doesn't
walk anybody. And that (walks) was
our undoing "

JefT Ballard was near-perfect yesterday after only two days rest, allow
ing Pepperdine one run on three hits.
Marquess attributed Ballard's con
trol yesterday as the key factor for
keeping the game close early on. "I
thought it was so important that he
didn't let them get a two- or three
run lead," Marquess explained. "By
keeping it close, it gave our hitters a
chance to get going."
Ballard's only mistake was a slider
he threw to Pepperdine center fielder
Brad Bierley in the second, which
Bierley tagged over the right center
field fence. And at that, it wasn't even
a bad pitch.
"He hit a good pitch," Ballard said.
"It was a slider down and away, right
in his wheelhouse. He hit the heck
out of it — the heck.
"Except for the home run, though,
I'd give this so close to a 10 that it
would be silly. Without that home
run, it'd be perfect."
Has Ballard pitched any better?
Marquess didn't hesitate to answer:
"No. That was an unbelievable ef
fort."
