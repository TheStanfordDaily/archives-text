# Ramos earns MVP honors

Nebraska pitcher Bill McGuire
might have made the worst deci
sion of his baseball career in
choosing to pitch to Stanford
catcher John Ramos in Saturday's
West I Regional game.
With one out and men on first
and second in the bottom of the
ninth inning, and Ramos, with six
hits in his previous eight at bats, at
the plate, perhaps McGuire should
have thought twice.
"The pressure faded away,"
Ramos said. "All I was thinking
was base hit."
And a base hit was exactly what
he got; his line drive to right
center field brought in both base
runners and allowed left fielder
Walt Harris to score the winning
run for the Cardinal.
Ramos continued his hot streak
for the remaining two days of the
tournament, going 8-for-15 with
three walks to lead the team with a
.533 tournament batting average.
Two of Ramos' hits were
doubles, and another came in the
form of a seventh-inning solo
homer off Pepperdine's Tony
Lewis in yesterday's game.
Another of Ramos' accomplish
ments this weekend was to lead
the Cardinal team with five runs

scored. He also helped his team to
a regional championship with his
six RBIs in the tournament.
These impressive statistics were
enough not only to get Ramos
elected as All-Tournament
catcher, hut also to earn him the
Most Valuable Player honors.
"I haven't really been in a
groove all season, and it felt nice
to be in one now," Ramos said, "I
felt relaxed at the plate, and
everything was coming together."
Coach Mark Marquess, obvi
ously proud of his player's perfor
mance, claimed that he couldn't
have expected anybody to play as
well as Ramos did.
"He's been so darn hot lately,"
Marquess said. "I think he's start
ing to find himself."
That may be, but Ramos hasn't
appeared to have had much trou
ble finding himself the entire
season.
In the 54 games he started for
Stanford this season, Ramos main
tained a consistent .309 batting
average and had 62 RBIs and
eight home runs.
