# Women golfers skid to 16th at nationals
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff sports writer 
What began with visions of a
championship early last week
ended in complete frustration Sat
urday as the No. 6-ranked Cardinal
women's golf team finished in 16th
place out of 18 teams at the NCAA
championships in Cape Cod, Mass.
For the rest of the field, the
championships went as expected.
No. 1-ranked Florida captured the
championship in ridiculously easy
fashion. The Gator women led by
eight shots after the first round and
coasted to the title with a 1,218
four-round total. No. 2 ranked
Tulsa finished 15 shots back of
Florida in second place. No. 3
Arizona State captured third place
at 1,236.
1 he Cardinal women found
themselves in ninth place after
Wednesday's first round and things
only got worse from there. They
collapsed over the final three

rounds, finishing 69 shots back of
champion Florida.
Before the tournament, Stanford
Coach Tim Baldwin had said that
the Cardinal women had a
legitimate shot at the national
championship if each golfer played
up to her potential.
However, that was far from the
case, as the Stanford scores bal
looned throughout the tournament.
For the championships, the Card
inal women averaged more than 80
strokes per round.
The Cardinal's disappointment
was best exemplified by the play of
sophomore Kathleen McCarthy.
McCarthy, an All-American as a
freshman last season when she
finished fifth at the national cham
pionships, played her worst golf of
the season last week, finishing in a
tie for 49th place at 320. In Satur
day's final round, she shot an 86, 13
shots above par for the New
Seabury Golf Course.

ASU's Danielle Ammaccapane
came from four shots back in the
final round to capture the individ
ual championship at Cape Cod.
Ammaccapane, who had won the
prestigious Lady Mustang Roun
dup last March in Dallas, shot con
sistent rounds of 74, 75, 74 and 75
to finish at 298 for the tournament.
For a while, it looked as though
Stanford freshman Anna
Oxenstierna would at least provide
some satisfaction for the Cardinal
women. She shot 152 over the first
two rounds and found herself in a
tie for seventh place. However, the
poor play of her teammates seemed
to rub off on Oxenstierna as she
shot 79 and 85 over the final two
rounds to finish in a tie for 36th
place at 316.
Freshman Kay Cornelius shot
328 for the four rounds, followed
by freshman Trish McGonigle at
329 and junior Kathv Kostas at
332.
