The Stanford men's golf team took another step for
ward in its quest to become a national power in the col
legiate golf world, while current powerhouse Houston
added to its collection of championships last week at the
NCAA championships in Grenelefe, Fla.
Last season, the Cardinal qualified for the champion
ships for the first time in six years, though the team
finished 26th and failed to make the cut after the third
round. This year, the resurgence of the men's golf pro
gram here was even more evident, as Stanford finished
first among the West Coast teams competing at the cham
pionships.
"It's satisfying to be the leading team from the whole of
our district," Cardinal Coach Tim Schaaf said. "We beat a
lot of good teams."
Schaaf had many reasons to be pleased with the Card
inal's performance. "The most significant thing is that it's
the first time that Stanford has finished in the top 10 in
years and years," he said. "It's been a long time."
Houston, which has all but had a chokehold on the
championship for the past decade, led from start to finish
this year, although the Cardinal did share the lead with
the Cougars after one round. Houston's winning total was
1,172 for the four rounds.
Oklahoma State, led by U.S. amateur champion Scott
Verplank, captured second place, finishing three shots
back of the Cougars at 1,175. Florida finished in third

place at 1,185.
Schaaf was not surprised by the results of the cham
pionships. "The two best teams finished first and second,"
he said.
In Wednesday's first round, Stanford fired a sizzling
288 to tie Houston for the lead. The Cardinal's and
Cougars' first round 288s represented two of the three
sub-290 rounds during the championships. "We showed
that we can play at the absolute top level," Schaaf said.
Schaaf indicated that the one step that the Cardinal
must take in order to challenge the nation's powers is to
play more consistently. "We have to learn to play consis
tently on a four-round basis," he said. "There's a reason
that Houston has won 16 national championships."
Ohio State's Clark Burroughs captured the individual
championship this year, defeating USC's Sam Randolph
in the first hole of a sudden-hole playoff. Burroughs and
Randolph both shot a three-under 285 for the four
rounds.
Randolph, the runner-up to Verplank at the 1984 U.S.
Amateur Tournament, led after each of the first three
rounds and held a six-shot lead over Burroughs with nine
holes left in Saturday's final round. He fell apart on the
back nine, however, allowing Burroughs to tie him at the
end of regulation and win on the first playoff hole.
Stanford senior Tim Robinson had his most consistent
tournament in more than a month, finishing in 14th place
and gaining third-team All-American honors. His scores
for the four rounds were 75, 71, 74 and 73.
