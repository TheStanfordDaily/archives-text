# United Airlines strike forces yearbook delay

### SCOn PARKER 
The United Airlines pilots' strike will have
at least one effect on Stanford students:
Their yearbooks will be delayed. But the
1985 Stanford Quad should arrive by the
end of next week, according to Editor in
Chief Kevin Solliday.
The Quad office is mailing letters to pur
chasers today, explaining the reasons for the
delay and outlining tentative distribution
plans.
Distribution of The Quad, originally sched
uled to begin this week in White Plaza, is
now slated to begin on Saturday, June 8, the
second day of finals.
The Quad is normally flown from its North
Carolina printer. Hunter Publishing Co., to
the Bay Area on Eastern Airlines. However,
Eastern and other air freight carriers are re
quired to give precedence to the U.S. Postal

Service, and the United strike has left Eas
tern and the others with all the mail they can
carry.
"We're getting killed by it," said Mike
Magnus, Eastern Airlines' chief agent in the
Atlanta cargo office. "Little if any freight is
moving. The strike and the Memorial Day
weekend have filled us up."
Consequently, Hunter has had to hire
"wildcat" truckers to transport The Quad
west, according to The Quad's mailing.
Trucking the yearbooks cross-country will
take five days, while flying them would have
taken two.
Hunter has moved up the printing date of
books done for California schools to offset
the extra shipping time, Solliday said.
However, none of the books can be
delivered until all the schools' books
are printed.
"Hunter can't afford to send empty
trucks," Solliday explained.
If the books arrive as scheduled on
June 7, distribution will begin the
next day. According to Lee
Hoagland, business manager of The
Ouad, graduating seniors will be en

couraged to wait a few days to pick up
their copies of The Ouad. so students
leaving during finals week can get
their books before departing.
Purchasers with questions can call
The Ouad office, 497-3604. for a re
corded update on the situation. Of
fice hours are Monday, Wednesday
and Friday from noon to 1 p.m.
through June 5.
Solliday said the delay will be only
a minor inconvenience for yearbook
buyers. "The real hassle is more for
us than for anyone else," he said.
