# Gates nets 2 crowns

### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
OKLAHOMA CITY — It doesn't
get much sweeter.
At least not for Linda Gates, Stan
ford's senior tennis star, who ended
her illustrious college career Friday
afternoon on a warm, clear day at the
Oklahoma City Tennis Center.
Gates, a four-time Ail-American,
entered Friday's NCAA singles and
doubles finals already an NCAA
doubles winner, a doubles runner-up,
a singles runner-up and a two-time
team champion. A little after 1 p.m.,
she took the center court and won the
singles title. Later that afternoon, she
teamed with Leigh Anne Eldredge to
win the doubles title. And when she
shook hands at the end of the latter
match, her four years of eligibility
were spent.
All careers should end so well.
"It's great," said the unassuming
Gates. "It still hasn't hit me yet. 1
really didn't expect this (to win both),
it just worked out that way. It's one of
those things you dream about."
As if it wasn't enough to win both
the NCAA singles and doubles

crowns in the same year for the first
time since another Stanford netter —
current professional Kathy Jordan —
did it in 1978, Gates got some oh-so
sweet revenge in the process.
Both singles and doubles victories
came against players from Trinity
(Texas). That's the same Trinity that
knocked top-seeded Stanford out of
the team competition a week earlier
— in the quarterfinals.
In the singles. Gates recorded a 7-6
(7-5), 6-2 win over Trinity's
Gretchen Rush, with whom she won
the National Junior Doubles champi
onship in 1981. Gates and Eldredge
beat Trinity's Rush and Lisa Sassano
6-4, 6-3. Stanford lost both those
matches in its team match against
Trinity a week earlier.
So do the individual victories make
up for the team loss?
"I think they do," Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan said. "After we lost to
Trinity, everybody felt so down, like
nothing we could do would ever make
up for it. And now it's a week later,
and everything is great again. I think
it does clean things up again."
Although Gates won both matches

in straight sets, neither were as one
sided as the scores indicate. In fact,
her singles match with Rush was vir
tually decided by one point.
Gates and Rush each held serve six
times in the first set. bringing the set
to a 12-point tiebreaker. And in the
tiebreaker, it was more of the same.
Each player held serve five times,
knotting the score at 5-5 with Rush
serving.
Rush put her first serve in, but
Gates hit her return "fat" and it
floated over the net. Rush, who was
approaching the net, put a backhand
volley into it, and suddenly Gates was
a serve away from winning the first
set. A serve and two forehand volleys
later. Gates had won the tiebreaker
7-5 and the set 7-6.
Losing such a close set — one in
which Gates won 42 points and Rush
39 — obviously was traumatic for
Rush, who quickly fell behind 4-0 in
the second set. Gates extended that
lead to 5-1, but Rush fought off two
match points and held serve to make
it 5-2.
And for the slightest moments of
moments, it appeared Rush, who had
pulled out a three straight three-set
matches to reach the final, would do
it again.
"I was saying to myself, TJh oh,' "
Gates recalled. "1 was getting kind of
worried because I was thinking of all
the other matches she had pulled
out."
Gates, as was her game plan, kept
the pressure on Rush in the eighth
game with her serve and volley tac
tics. Ahead 3-2, Gates hit a second
serve that Rush returned into the net,
and the NCAA singles title was hers.
Coaches and players alike con
curred that Gates' powerful serve,
which Rush never broke, was clearly
the difference. In all, Gates hit in
nearly 75 percent (45-of-62) of her
first serves and had five aces.
"I think Linda's serve really did it,
and that's what makes a great
player," Brennan said. "Linda's serve
is much improved, and she's backing
it up with a good first volley. She's
realy found her style."
Brennan said that after Gates'
singles victory, he was worried she
might be "a little too bubbly and
happy, but she was all business."
Indeed, she and Eldredge were.
The Cardinal pair took the first set
from Rush and Sassano by breaking
Rush's serve in the 10th game. In the
second set, neither team could hold
serve until Eldredge did in the
seventh game to put Stanford ahead
4-3.
Gates and Eldredge then won eight
straight points — two of them on
doubles faults by Rush — to win the

the finals of the individual tournament Friday.
next two games, the set and the
match.
Like her partner, Eldredge said she
felt good about their chances. "When
we were warming up, I felt really
good," she said. "I've felt good about
this since yesterday (Thursday). It's
definitely the biggest doubles win of
my life."
While Eldredge played what Bren
nan called "one of her better
matches," the woman of the hour was
Gates, who left Court 1 at the Okla
homa City Tennis Center with two
first place trophies, bringing her
career total to five.
No one was happier than Gates,
who began playing easily the best ten
nis of her life virtually out of the blue.
"I think mentally I've been trying
to prepare myself for a while, since it
was my last college tournament," said
Gates, who plans to turn pro immedi
ately. "Since I had been through it
before, I thought there was no reason
why I couldn't do it again."
