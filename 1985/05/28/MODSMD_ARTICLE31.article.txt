# Cardinal falls short in Athens
## 
### Bv VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
If there was ever any doubt that Georgia was the
No. 1 team in the nation after it upset Stanford,
USC and UCLA in the NCAA team championship
last weekend, it was erased by the Bulldogs' perfor
mance in the NCAA individuals this weekend.
Georgia's Mikael Pernfors, a senior, won his
second consecutive NCAA singles title with a 6-2,
6-3 victory over teammate George Bezecny.
Pernfors became the first champion to successfully
defend his crown since current Southern Methodist
Coach Dennis Ralston won the 1963 and 1964
tournaments.
Jt may have been a "Cinderella story" for Geor
gia this year — playing as the underdog and win
ning in front of a home crowd in Athens, Ga. — but
when one team, dominates both NCAA tourna
ments, other teams get to pick up the losses and
head home with next year in mind.
Such is the case with the Stanford men's tennis
team. After losing to Georgia in the quarterfinals
of the team tournament, 5-3, the Cardinal was vic
timized a second time by Bulldog players this
weekend. Dan Goldie, Stanford's No. 1 player, lost
to Bezecny in the quarterfinals of the individual
tournament, 5-7, 7-6, 6-0. Jim Grabb lost to
Pernfors in the semifinals, 7-5, 6-4, and Pernfors
and Allen Miller combined to defeat Grabb and
John Letts in the doubles quarterfinals.

Stanford players are not disappointed with their
effort throughout both tournaments, however.
"We gave it our best shot," said Eric Rosenfeld,
Stanford's No. 6 singles and No. 3 doubles player.
"Georgia just has a great team."
"1 was up a set and 3-0, 4-3, in the second when
he won a few points and stayed in there," Goldie
said of his loss to Bezecny. "He won the tiebreaker
something like 9-7 — it was pretty close. I was tired
in the third set."
Both Goldie and Bezecny were playing their
second outdoor match of the day. Many believe the
two straight weeks of NCAA competition make the
national tournament a test of endurance as much as
of ability. Any injury incurred during the season is
bound to come up and hinder play somewhere
along the line.
Some had questioned Pernfors' ability to
withstand the torture of the two-week tournament
— in which he sometimes had to play three matches
a day — as back spasms had hindered his play late
in the season.
Pernfors may have been exhausted, but he still
managed to muster up 21 match victories in 10
days. One of those wins knocked out Grabb in the
individual semifinals. Grabb was the only Cardinal
player to reach the semifinals in either tournament.
Georgia's top five players were seniors this year,
and Coach Dan Magill said he will be "rebuilding"

the Bulldog squad for some years to come.
On the other hand, Stanford will have five
seniors next year — Goldie, Grabb, Letts, Derrick
Rostagnoand Rosenfeld. Experience will undoubt
edly be on the Cardinal's side if these players go to
their third national championship in 1986.
"It's impossible to say how well we will do next
year because everybody has a good shot every
year," Rosenfeld said. "We'll be practicing and
playing to get better."
Goldie said he will probably return. Rosenfeld
said he did not know of any nonreturning juniors.
"If Dan had won the nationals, there is a big pos
sibility he would have turned pro," Rosenfeld said.
"I'm sure I'll stay amateur through the summer,"
Goldie said. "I'll probably play again next year."
That's very good news for the Cardinal. Stanford
proved it could win a national team title in
February this year when it beat USC, 6-3, in the
finals of the ITCA Team Championship. Goldie
moved up to the No. 1 national spot soon after with
a straight set win over Pernfors in the finals of the
All American Individual Indoor Championship at
Houston.
The Stanford men have done it before — and
there's a good chance they can do it again next
year. Stanford will just have to be careful to time it
right. The early season "February" wins are fine,
but it's the competition in May that really counts.
