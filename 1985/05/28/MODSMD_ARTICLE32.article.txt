While Stanford knows that it will be playing the winner
of the Atlantic Regional in the first round of the College
World Series in Omaha, Neb., the No. 2-ranked Cardinal
doesn't know who that is. Two rainouts and a rain-forced
suspension at Coral Gables, Fla., have put that tourna
ment back a day.
The winner will be a team from Florida â€” either host
Miami (Fla.) or Florida. The teams meet today at 4:30
p.m. PDT to decide who gets to go to Omaha and who
gets to go fishing.
Yesterday, No. 5-ranked Miami handed No. 30 Vir
ginia its first loss of the tournament, downing the
Cavaliers 11-6 in the completion of Sunday's suspended
game. No. 15 Florida then staved off elimination by
knocking out Virginia, 15-2. In the first round, Virginia
had crushed the Gators, 14-1.
Miami had a chance to win the regional yesterday, but
Florida posted an 8-1 win to force tonight's title game.
At Omaha, conference champion Stanford won't be the
only team from the Pacific 10 Southern Division. Runner
up Arizona blew away the West II Regional at Fresno,
sweeping three games to advance.
Saturday, Arizona beat host Fresno State 10-3 to earn
the trip to the Series. The seventh-ranked Bulldogs were

the top seed in that regional, while No. 17 Arizona was
third.
Arizona reached the championship game with victories
over No. 21 Brigham Young, 7-3, on Thursday, and
Fresno State, 7-6, on Friday.
California, the other Six-Pac team in the West 11, found
itself eliminated quickly. The Bears lost Thursday to
Fresno State in 10 innings, 7-6, then dropped a 9-5 deci
sion to BYU.
Should Stanford win its first game, the Cardinal would
face the winner of Saturday's Arizona-Texas game next
Tuesday. The losers of those two games play Sunday.
Texas, the No. 3 team in the nation and the Southwest
Conference champion, won all four of its games in the six
team Central Regional that it hosted in Austin. A 10-2
victory over No. 28 Lamar sent the Longhorns to the Se
ries. Earlier, they had beaten Grambling State, Houston
and No. 10 Oklahoma.
In the other bracket of the Series, No. 14 South
Carolina will face No. 6 Arkansas, and No. 1 Oklahoma
State will meet No. 4 Mississippi State.
Host Oklahoma State received a scare at the Midwest
Regional when No. 16 Wichita State defeated the Cow
boys 7-2 yesterday afternoon. Oklahoma State had
beaten the Shockers 15-8 on Sunday and came back with
a 10-6 victory last night to earn the trip north.
