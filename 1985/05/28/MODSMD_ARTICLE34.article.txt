## Bond is back in 'A View to a Kill' 
### Bv STEVE WARRICK 
As Max Zorin, Christopher
Walken's hair is dyed blond and
blown straight back, and Grace Jones
has her hair done in two ridges that
look like the horny knobs on the head
of a rattlesnake. When these two
stand toghether, they are immedi
ately distinctive, and they don't over
shadow one another (unlike, say.
Jaws, who's the only villain we re
member from 'The Spy Who Loved
Me"). They're a great villain team,
and the filmmakers seem to know
what they've got with these two; it's
not often that they suggest in ads that
James Bond may have actually met
his match.
"A View to a Kill" is the 15th
James Bond movie, and this one has
an unusually clever and reasonable
plot. Max Zorin is a millionaire in
dustrialist involved in microchip pro
cessing who plans to corner the mar
ket by wiping out Silicon Valley. He's
a ruthless capitalist, a product of Nazi
experiments, and a KGB agent
(obviously, not too many hard-line
ideologues left in the Soviet
hierarchy), which means, of course,
that he's also a psychotic killer.

Walken has a great time with his role;
he teeters right on the edge through
out the movie, and drops over in
scenes where he mows down his own
men in a flooded mine shaft and later
attempts to hack Bond with a fire axe.
Zorin gets a schoolboy grin on his
face when he's committing mayhem,
and Walken gives him a really good
maniacal giggle. He transforms the
stock Bond villain lines ("You amuse
me, Mr. Bond") that previous actors
have mumbled over.
Grace Jones has a few great scenes,
including a parachute dive from the
Eiffel Tower and a fight scene with
Zorin, but she doesn't get the
clincher: She doesn't get to kick the
hell out of James Bond. She deserves
more to do, because we know she's a
threat the instant we see her (we also
know the extent of her acting range
â€” it's all there in her record-cover
pose). She kills almost all of Bond's
associates (in disappointingly predic
table and subdued ways), but when
Zorin betrays her, she is suddenly
willing to sacrifice her life for Bond's
cause; surely this woman would want
to stay alive to get revenge on Zorin?
Her demise is certainly spectacular.

and recalls Barbara Carrera s in
"Never Say Never Again" (the other
Bond film with a good male/female
villain team), but May Day needs
more action in the second hall ot the
movie; the filmmakers create a good
menace and then fail to use her.
The other female role, Stacey Sut
ton, is underdeveloped, though
Tanya Roberts shows spunk in some
situations. She screams too much, and
modern audiences have a very low
tolerance for female screams in har
rowing situations. She also plays the
American girl-next-door role a little
too conscientiously; this is accen
tuated by her house, which is about as
American Mid-West Victorian as you
can get. Her morality fits too: there
are audible groans when she tears up,
on principle, a $5 million check, and
more groans when Bond doesn't
sleep with her that night. After
defending her home, he sleeps in a
chair with a rifle across his knees,
defending her virginity like a diligent
marshall.
Maybe that's all that's left for
Roger Moore to do as Bond. He's

Grace Jones plays the villainous May Day, and Roger Moore is James Bond in "A View to a Kill." The pair
was given a reception at San Francisco's City Hall by Mayor Feinstein last week.
