## Bond is back in 'A View to a Kill' 
### Bv STEVE WARRICK 
As Max Zorin, Christopher
Walken's hair is dyed blond and
blown straight back, and Grace Jones
has her hair done in two ridges that
look like the horny knobs on the head
of a rattlesnake. When these two
stand toghether, they are immedi
ately distinctive, and they don't over
shadow one another (unlike, say.
Jaws, who's the only villain we re
member from 'The Spy Who Loved
Me"). They're a great villain team,
and the filmmakers seem to know
what they've got with these two; it's
not often that they suggest in ads that
James Bond may have actually met
his match.
"A View to a Kill" is the 15th
James Bond movie, and this one has
an unusually clever and reasonable
plot. Max Zorin is a millionaire in
dustrialist involved in microchip pro
cessing who plans to corner the mar
ket by wiping out Silicon Valley. He's
a ruthless capitalist, a product of Nazi
experiments, and a KGB agent
(obviously, not too many hard-line
ideologues left in the Soviet
hierarchy), which means, of course,
that he's also a psychotic killer.

Walken has a great time with his role;
he teeters right on the edge through
out the movie, and drops over in
scenes where he mows down his own
men in a flooded mine shaft and later
attempts to hack Bond with a fire axe.
Zorin gets a schoolboy grin on his
face when he's committing mayhem,
and Walken gives him a really good
maniacal giggle. He transforms the
stock Bond villain lines ("You amuse
me, Mr. Bond") that previous actors
have mumbled over.
Grace Jones has a few great scenes,
including a parachute dive from the
Eiffel Tower and a fight scene with
Zorin, but she doesn't get the
clincher: She doesn't get to kick the
hell out of James Bond. She deserves
more to do, because we know she's a
threat the instant we see her (we also
know the extent of her acting range
— it's all there in her record-cover
pose). She kills almost all of Bond's
associates (in disappointingly predic
table and subdued ways), but when
Zorin betrays her, she is suddenly
willing to sacrifice her life for Bond's
cause; surely this woman would want
to stay alive to get revenge on Zorin?
Her demise is certainly spectacular.

and recalls Barbara Carrera s in
"Never Say Never Again" (the other
Bond film with a good male/female
villain team), but May Day needs
more action in the second hall ot the
movie; the filmmakers create a good
menace and then fail to use her.
The other female role, Stacey Sut
ton, is underdeveloped, though
Tanya Roberts shows spunk in some
situations. She screams too much, and
modern audiences have a very low
tolerance for female screams in har
rowing situations. She also plays the
American girl-next-door role a little
too conscientiously; this is accen
tuated by her house, which is about as
American Mid-West Victorian as you
can get. Her morality fits too: there
are audible groans when she tears up,
on principle, a $5 million check, and
more groans when Bond doesn't
sleep with her that night. After
defending her home, he sleeps in a
chair with a rifle across his knees,
defending her virginity like a diligent
marshall.
Maybe that's all that's left for
Roger Moore to do as Bond. He's

way too old for us to believe any of
his stunts, and his leading ladies are
looking more like his daughters with
each film. The sexual innuendoes
have a nasty bite to them, particularly
those that refer to his anatomy. I
think the producers are overestimat

ing Moore's star appeal in this role.
There are plenty of young handsome
actors today who can really act
(though Moore's getting better in this
area, or I'm getting used to him). The
young Sean Connery was lean and
hard-edged; Moore is somewhat flac
cid, though he looks better in his late
50s than I ever will. But the director
doesn't cover for Moore's absence in
the action scenes; the doubles in
almost all the key stunts are caught
at awkward angles, where they obvi

ously look nothing like him. When
Moore subs back into the film, his
hair and dinner jacket are fresh from
the dressing room, and his move
ments are too slow; we don't make
the connection between the stunt we
just saw and the man who was
supposed to have done it. The series
needs a much stronger central charac
ter; Moore is dead air on the screen.
The moviemakers have done a bet
ter job of distracting us from the void

this time out. The last couple of Bond
films have had relatively minor
league threats, and before that Bond
went into outer space, where every
thing seemed too big for a single silly,
secret agent. "A View to a Kill" is
scaled down just right, and the plot
seems cleaner and the incidents less
random than usual. Some details are
disappointingly sloppy in the first
half: a falling dummy looks like just
that, and a tow rope is clearly visible
where none should be. And Moore

has too much make-up around his
eyes in some scenes (he looks like a
ghoul with a tan). But the overall pro
duction design really seems integral
to the story. Zorin's chateau in Chan
tilly, France, is so whoppingly huge
it's a good joke on itself, and the
filmmakers stage a big party that
really covers the grounds. The climax
on top of the Golden Gate Bridge is
exciting in a way that the last few
Bond's weren't; director John Glen
sets up the angles so we always get a

sense of great height, and the shots
down the cables instill a real vertigo.
In his blimp over San Francisco,
Zorin hovers like a petulant god
who's going to destroy his toy erector
set, and the area from above looks
like a giant's plaything, complete with
miniature boats in the bay. So when
Zorin leaps out of a blimp and goes
after Bond with a big axe, it makes a
crazy kind of sense: If he can't
destroy San Francisco, he's at least
going to chop down the damn bridge.

tilly, France, is so whoppingly huge
it's a good joke on itself, and the
filmmakers stage a big party that
really covers the grounds. The climax
on top of the Golden Gate Bridge is
exciting in a way that the last few
Bond's weren't; director John Glen
sets up the angles so we always get a

sense of great height, and the shots
down the cables instill a real vertigo.
In his blimp over San Francisco,
Zorin hovers like a petulant god
who's going to destroy his toy erector
set, and the area from above looks
like a giant's plaything, complete with
miniature boats in the bay. So when
Zorin leaps out of a blimp and goes
after Bond with a big axe, it makes a
crazy kind of sense: If he can't
destroy San Francisco, he's at least
going to chop down the damn bridge.
As Max Zorin, Christopher
Walken's hair is dyed blond and
blown straight back, and Grace Jones
has her hair done in two ridges that
look like the horny knobs on the head
of a rattlesnake. When these two
stand toghether, they are immedi
ately distinctive, and they don't over
shadow one another (unlike, say.
Jaws, who's the only villain we re
member from 'The Spy Who Loved
Me"). They're a great villain team,
and the filmmakers seem to know
what they've got with these two; it's
not often that they suggest in ads that
James Bond may have actually met
his match.
"A View to a Kill" is the 15th
James Bond movie, and this one has
an unusually clever and reasonable
plot. Max Zorin is a millionaire in
dustrialist involved in microchip pro
cessing who plans to corner the mar
ket by wiping out Silicon Valley. He's
a ruthless capitalist, a product of Nazi
experiments, and a KGB agent
(obviously, not too many hard-line
ideologues left in the Soviet
hierarchy), which means, of course,
that he's also a psychotic killer.

Walken has a great time with his role;
he teeters right on the edge through
out the movie, and drops over in
scenes where he mows down his own
men in a flooded mine shaft and later
attempts to hack Bond with a fire axe.
Zorin gets a schoolboy grin on his
face when he's committing mayhem,
and Walken gives him a really good
maniacal giggle. He transforms the
stock Bond villain lines ("You amuse
me, Mr. Bond") that previous actors
have mumbled over.
Grace Jones has a few great scenes,
including a parachute dive from the
Eiffel Tower and a fight scene with
Zorin, but she doesn't get the
clincher: She doesn't get to kick the
hell out of James Bond. She deserves
more to do, because we know she's a
threat the instant we see her (we also
know the extent of her acting range
— it's all there in her record-cover
pose). She kills almost all of Bond's
associates (in disappointingly predic
table and subdued ways), but when
Zorin betrays her, she is suddenly
willing to sacrifice her life for Bond's
cause; surely this woman would want
to stay alive to get revenge on Zorin?
Her demise is certainly spectacular.

and recalls Barbara Carrera s in
"Never Say Never Again" (the other
Bond film with a good male/female
villain team), but May Day needs
more action in the second hall ot the
movie; the filmmakers create a good
menace and then fail to use her.
The other female role, Stacey Sut
ton, is underdeveloped, though
Tanya Roberts shows spunk in some
situations. She screams too much, and
modern audiences have a very low
tolerance for female screams in har
rowing situations. She also plays the
American girl-next-door role a little
too conscientiously; this is accen
tuated by her house, which is about as
American Mid-West Victorian as you
can get. Her morality fits too: there
are audible groans when she tears up,
on principle, a $5 million check, and
more groans when Bond doesn't
sleep with her that night. After
defending her home, he sleeps in a
chair with a rifle across his knees,
defending her virginity like a diligent
marshall.
Maybe that's all that's left for
Roger Moore to do as Bond. He's

way too old for us to believe any of
his stunts, and his leading ladies are
looking more like his daughters with
each film. The sexual innuendoes
have a nasty bite to them, particularly
those that refer to his anatomy. I
think the producers are overestimat

ing Moore's star appeal in this role.
There are plenty of young handsome
actors today who can really act
(though Moore's getting better in this
area, or I'm getting used to him). The
young Sean Connery was lean and
hard-edged; Moore is somewhat flac
cid, though he looks better in his late
50s than I ever will. But the director
doesn't cover for Moore's absence in
the action scenes; the doubles in
almost all the key stunts are caught
at awkward angles, where they obvi

ously look nothing like him. When
Moore subs back into the film, his
hair and dinner jacket are fresh from
the dressing room, and his move
ments are too slow; we don't make
the connection between the stunt we
just saw and the man who was
supposed to have done it. The series
needs a much stronger central charac
ter; Moore is dead air on the screen.
The moviemakers have done a bet
ter job of distracting us from the void

this time out. The last couple of Bond
films have had relatively minor
league threats, and before that Bond
went into outer space, where every
thing seemed too big for a single silly,
secret agent. "A View to a Kill" is
scaled down just right, and the plot
seems cleaner and the incidents less
random than usual. Some details are
disappointingly sloppy in the first
half: a falling dummy looks like just
that, and a tow rope is clearly visible
where none should be. And Moore

has too much make-up around his
eyes in some scenes (he looks like a
ghoul with a tan). But the overall pro
duction design really seems integral
to the story. Zorin's chateau in Chan
tilly, France, is so whoppingly huge
