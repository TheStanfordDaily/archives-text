# 'The Danube': few memorable moments
## 
### KARY ANTHOLIS 
After Friday's presentation of
Maria Irene Home's "The Danube"
at the Eureka Theatre, the cast held
an informal discussion of the play
with the audience. A participant com
mented, "I saw some interesting ideas
and stylistic experiments, but frankly,
the play could not sustain my inter
est." A member of the cast
responded, "This play demands a lot
of an audience, and I think the author
aims more at an effect on the memory
of the viewer, than at an immediate
dramatic impact." Unfortunately, the
moments which have stewed in my
memory are the few which were ef
fective drama.
The plot of "The Danube" is
simple. Paul, an American busines
sman, falls in love with Eve, a Hun
garian innocent, on the eve of World
War 11. They marry and live with
Eve's father, Mr. Sandor, in
Budapest. The three main characters
live in a naive state of mind, and as
the world around them deteriorates,
each character grows physically ill.
Fornes hope to show us how op
pressed we are by our inability to
communicate the complexity of our
emotions. Her characters are
confined by their knowledge of only
the most elementary vocabulary and

sentence structures. As they find their
existences growing more complex,
their language devolves from a bridge
connecting their lives to a wall sepa
rating them from each other.

All of this is inter
esting stuff, but it
grows tedious.

Fornes uses the Danube as her
central metaphor. The characters are
in Budapest between 1938 and 1950.
The great river, at one time, had
joined the peoples of the Third
Reich. It was a unifying force and a
life blood. When the Reich was split
by the Cold War, the Danube, once a
symbol of unity, had become a
reminder of lost power and commu
nity. Fornes envisions the river as a
polluted force which poisons those
whom it had previously nourished. As
the characters deteriorate physically,
they lose their wills to act as individ

uals. They interact as if they are
automatons. In fact, toward the end
of the play, the actors mimic the char
acters' actions with hand puppets. All
of this is interesting stuff, but is grows
tedious. There are not enough dra
matic situations to keep us interested
in the ideas.
This is not entirely Forne's fault.
Director Susan Marsden fails to elicit
from her actors the absurdity of
Fornes' dialogue. Marc Hayashi plays
Paul with far too much realism. He
internalizes Paul's feelings rather
than playing to the state of being im
agined by Fornes. Nancy Carlin's Eve
and Roland Scrivner's Sandor are
more successful in this regard, but
even they seem restrained by
Marsden's direction.
There are several fine moments in
"The Danube." One particularly suc
cessful piece of drama comes after we
have seen all of the characters
deteriorate physically and spiritually.
Mr. Sandor wakes from a nap and
asks Paul, "What is the matter?" Paul
responds, "Eve coughs. 1 throw up.
You have diarrhea." Sandor suggests,
"Maybe we should call a doctor."
This captures man at the limit of an
absurd existence, and it is excellent
theater. Unfortunately, there are few
such moments in "The Danube."
