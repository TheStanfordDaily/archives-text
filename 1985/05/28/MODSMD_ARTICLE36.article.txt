# 'Camila': a provocative love story
## 
### MICHAEL ROSENTHAL 
"Camila," directed by Maria Luisa Bemberg, draws
upon the Argentina of the 1840s to comment upon Ar
gentina of the 19705. Censored by the military govern
ment there, it was recently rereleased in an unexpurgated
version to popular acclaim. While elegant artistically, the
film's political message is never far off. It is a love story
that slowly sharpens into a tale of oppression and
radicalization.
The opening scene is hazy and dreamy as we glimpse
the white dresses and parasols of an aristocratic family in
its country home. This romantic metaphor, like the rest of
the movie, soon slides into an edginess of meaning and sit
uation. A guarded carriage interrupts the tranquility.
Young children innocently ask their parents about the
crime of the woman inside. The reply of "She was a spy,"
prompts the children to ask, "What is a spy?" The inci
dent is a subtle foreshadowing of important questions
about the events that follow. What is a traitor, a heretic, a
criminal? In a country ruled by a military regime, the
answers are determined and manipulated to the advan
tage of the government at any cost.
In this case, we learn that this elderly woman has been
imprisoned by the governor of the "Holy Federation" in a
crackdown on the old corrupt regime. The situation is par
allel to the mid-1970s when the military usurped power
from Isabel Peron on the pretext of restoring order to a
land where "anarchy" had taken over. The extreme right
and left wings had indeed resorted to terrorism, but the
military itself utilized brutal tactics in order to secure its
power. At least 10,000 people, labeled "terrorists," were
taken by the secret police and never seen again. The film
echoes this fear in people's hearts when, in a night more
than 100 years earlier, the town's folk lock themselves
inside, listening to the bands of horsemen wreaking havoc
in the streets.
It is against this background that the young Camila
grows to maturity. Her eyes are turned as much to sub
versive books (illegally passed to her by the town booksel
ler) as to the young eligible men who court her. The
church, too, plays a large role in her family's life and, as
we soon realize, in the affairs of state. Unhappy with the
banality of her companions' petty loves and cares, a series
of events transforms her. Her growing infatuation with a
young priest pushes against all limits of propriety. Then,
seeing the bloody, decapitated head of the bookseller, she
is driven into a state of indignation beyond childish rebel
lion. Finally, at a sermon given by the young priest,
Gutierrez, in which he condemns the murderous act in
strong political lanquage, she is compelled to take a posi
tion against complicity of her class and church.
But the final separation comes only when the priest,
himself tormented by passion for the girl, succumbs to her
insistent advances. Camila places a white flower — sym
bolic because all must wear red in support of the gov
ernment — on her grandmother's casket just before

fleeing with Gutierrez. Henceforth, the constant cry to or
der — an order they have disrupted and threatened —
becomes a perverse backdrop to the renegade lovers, now
schoolteachers in a small town under an assumed identity.
Their passion, sometimes driven to frenzy, is a symbol of
the desparate attempts to live with their own fears and
sacrifices, and not less the very negation of the stultifying
regime. The struggle to liberate themselves from rigid so
cial norms and roles makes the couple's very presence a
threat to the Holy Federation. Throughout the film, the
entwining of personal with social liberation builds to a
powerful climax. The trinity of state, church and aris
tocracy cannot tolerate this kind of dissent.
The lavish sets and costumes of the movie vividly re
create the Buenos Aires and Pampas of 130 years ago.
But the initial tension between the romanticism of the
past and its chilling perspective on the present is constant.
The intensity of the acting is double edged. Susan

What is a traitor, a heretic, a

Pecoraro as Camila and Imanol Arias as Gutierrez pull us
into the urgency of their love and the doubts of their
sacrifice. The implacable father, played by Hector Al
terio, who will not give mercy to his daughter, finds an
equally villainous partner in the righteous Jesuit priest
Elortondo (Carlos Munoz). The most outstanding perfor
mance must be that of Pecoraro. Her expression of chil
dishness, passion, despair and certitude is remarkable for
its breadth.
In spite of obvious traps, the director kept the film from
falling into melodrama or, at the other extreme, didactic
allegory. With knowlege of its political context, "Camila"
becomes both entertaining and provocative.


Susan Pecoraro and Imanoi Arias star in "Camila," an Argentinian film set in the 1840s. The film is playing
at the Aquarius Theatre in Palo Alto.
