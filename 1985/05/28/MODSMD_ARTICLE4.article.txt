## Res Ed posts round two 
### MARK BEYREIS Editorial staff 
With round two of the Undergraduate Housing Draw
completed, 82 percent, or all but 660, of those students
who requested on-campus housing have been assigned to
a residence, according to Rodger Whitney, assistant dean
of Student Affairs and director of the Housing Center.
Last year, 79 percent of those who drew had been as
signed at this stage. Whitney said.
The results of the second round will be posted today in
residential offices. Dates for room assignments within
residences will be posted as well.
All of the guaranteed students who entered round two
have been assigned housing. Whitney said. Unguaranteed
women who drew 4,336 or less were assigned, as were un
guaranteed men who drew 3,765 or less.
Guaranteed students drew from numbers 0000 to
3,000, while unguaranteed students drew from 3.001 to
5,000. Whitney said the process, which is new this year, is
better understood by the students and more fair than the
previous draws.
Of the 4,175 students who entered the Draw, 1.371 ac
cepted their first round assignment. Another 450 students
dropped out of the Draw to become residential assistants,
join fraternities or live off campus. Whitney said a
"typical number" students joined fraternities this year.
Students who have received a housing assignment in the
second round have until June 7 to notify the University of
their decision to accept or decline.
These students have three options: accept the offer, ac
cept the offer and rejoin the waitlist, or decline the offer.
The 660 students who have not yet been assigned to any
residence have the option of joining the waitlist or drop
ping out of the process altogether.
Students planning to rejoin the waitlist have until June

7 to select three housing choices and get priorities for
those residences if necessary. They must also indicate
whether they wish to he considered for any on-campus
residence or only the three that they list. Whitney said.
Whitney advises those students planning to go overseas
next year to join either the winter or spring quarter wait
list. If not, they will be assigned a draw number over
5,000.
Some of the new cutoff numbers are:
• Storey — no change for either men or women.
• 558 Mayfield — 353 for men and no change for women.
• Adams — 2,425 for men and no change for women.
• Twain — 3,039 for men and 2.916 for women.
• Italian house — 3,305 for men with priority two and no
change for women.
• 353 Campus — 1,065 for men with priorty two and no
change for women.
• Roble Hall — 1,197 for men and 1,225 for women.
• Cardenal — 2,862 for men and 4,023 for women.
• Durand — 3,103 for men and 2.995 for women.
• Serra — 3,738 for men and 4,212 for women.
• Zap — no change for either men or women.
• Lathrop— 1,741 for men and no change for women.
• Eucalypto— 1,787 for men and 1,919 for women.
Students whose groups were split up in the round may
file a petition to rejoin their groups with their local
residence office. Whitney said.
On Aug. 15, the next round of the Draw will take place.
Some students not already housed will receive an assign
ment, and those with an assignment will have a chance to
be re-assigned if they have rejoined the waitlist.
There is also a round in early Septemher. but only stu
dents with no assignments may enter.
Whitney said he was "extremely pleased" with the
Draw this year. It is the "smoothest" Draw with which he
has been associated, he added.
