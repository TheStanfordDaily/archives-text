# Bookstore eyes expansion plan
## Growth concepts discussed 
### LYNN MARCUS Staff writer 
With phrases like "a bookstore that
few would dream of' and"the super
bookstore" to spur them on,
managers of the Stanford Bookstore
are launching an exploratory investi
gation into ways of expanding to an
unprecedented level.
Law School Prof. Jack Friedenthal,
president of the bookstore's board of
directors, says he has been
brainstorming over the idea of a
"super bookstore" with managers of
the non-profit bookstore in recent
months.
The managers received the go
ahead for further exploration of the
project Thursday, when the students,
faculty and staff members comprising
the bookstore's board of directors
unanimously approved the concept of
large-scale expansion.
Eldon Speed, general manager of
the bookstore, said, "We received the
board's enthusiastic response to the
idea of a bookstore with probably
more titles than any other bookstore
around for the perusal and benefit of
the Stanford community."
Friedenthal said that along with
physical expansion and an increase in

the number of titles carried,
managers will be looking into the
feasibility of leasing or taking over
other units, such as bookstores at
other campuses. He said such
measures could help other campus
communities while serving the Stan
ford community through lower prices,
higher rebates or expanded services
made possible by economies of scale.
Speed and Friedenthal emphasized
that the primary purpose of expan
sion would be to serve better the
Stanford community. "The basic
dream is to create a great bookstore
for Stanford University, and, in that
context, we want a bookstore that
maybe serves the country," Frieden
thal said. He added that people
unable to find certain books else
where could order them by mail from
the Stanford Bookstore.
Both Friedenthal and Speed
stressed that the plan is only at a pre
liminary, conceptual stage and that
no proposals for concrete action have
been approved. Speed said the next
steps for management will be to
"develop a timetable, gel rive Univer
sity involved and develop a program
