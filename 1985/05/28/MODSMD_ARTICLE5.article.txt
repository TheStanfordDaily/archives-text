# Bookstore eyes expansion plan
## Growth concepts discussed 
### LYNN MARCUS Staff writer 
With phrases like "a bookstore that
few would dream of' and"the super
bookstore" to spur them on,
managers of the Stanford Bookstore
are launching an exploratory investi
gation into ways of expanding to an
unprecedented level.
Law School Prof. Jack Friedenthal,
president of the bookstore's board of
directors, says he has been
brainstorming over the idea of a
"super bookstore" with managers of
the non-profit bookstore in recent
months.
The managers received the go
ahead for further exploration of the
project Thursday, when the students,
faculty and staff members comprising
the bookstore's board of directors
unanimously approved the concept of
large-scale expansion.
Eldon Speed, general manager of
the bookstore, said, "We received the
board's enthusiastic response to the
idea of a bookstore with probably
more titles than any other bookstore
around for the perusal and benefit of
the Stanford community."
Friedenthal said that along with
physical expansion and an increase in

the number of titles carried,
managers will be looking into the
feasibility of leasing or taking over
other units, such as bookstores at
other campuses. He said such
measures could help other campus
communities while serving the Stan
ford community through lower prices,
higher rebates or expanded services
made possible by economies of scale.
Speed and Friedenthal emphasized
that the primary purpose of expan
sion would be to serve better the
Stanford community. "The basic
dream is to create a great bookstore
for Stanford University, and, in that
context, we want a bookstore that
maybe serves the country," Frieden
thal said. He added that people
unable to find certain books else
where could order them by mail from
the Stanford Bookstore.
Both Friedenthal and Speed
stressed that the plan is only at a pre
liminary, conceptual stage and that
no proposals for concrete action have
been approved. Speed said the next
steps for management will be to
"develop a timetable, gel rive Univer
sity involved and develop a program
for an enlarged facility.
"We have to sit down and develop
from concepts to reality," Speed said.
Speed said one goal of the project
is to expand the number of titles from
the current 1 ()(),()()() to 500,000, with
the emphasis on academic titles. "If
we accomplish that, it would un
doubtedly be one of the finest
bookstores in the country," he said.
"1 know of no other bookstore that
offers such selection."
Speed said it is too early to esti
mate the size of the proposed expan
sion, both in terms of dollars and
physical size. The bookstore is cur
rently a $14 million per year opera
tion with a medically oriented branch
in Palo Alto, a sports shop near An
gell Field and the main store.
Friedenthal said physical espansion
could occur at the present site or else
where.
Another item which Friedenthal
said merits attention is the lack of
parking spaces adjacent to the Stan
ford Bookstore. "With no parking,

there's no way we can tap sources
other than those we've already
tapped," he said.
Friedenthal said expansion by the
bookstore could provide a valuable
service to other college communities
because many campus bookstores
have been going out of business
recently and are being taken over by
commercial book chains which are
more interested in making profits
than in providing a wide academic se
lection.
"We think we can do a better job
because we don't have to answer to a
profit-making motive, and we could
provide a better book selection," he
said.
Friedenthal said the Stanford
Bookstore has an advantage over
bookstores on other campuses be
cause it is independently managed,
whereas many bookstores are owned
by universities, and their managers
are restricted by university policies.
Friedenthal said, "assuming we can
do it without eroding basic services,"
the type of expansion envisioned
could create "a bookstore that few
would dream of."
