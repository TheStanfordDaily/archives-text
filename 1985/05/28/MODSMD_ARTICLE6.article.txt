# Party noise suggestions given
## 
### ALLISON HARTWELI Staff writer 
Students and representatives of Residen
tial Education met with Stanford Police
Capt. Marvin Moore Friday to discuss the
recent closing of parties because of noise
and to suggest guidelines for future
parties.
Moore said the shutdown of the parties on
May 18 and 19 was an "extreme case" and
urged students to take into account the un
usually large number of parties held those
three days.
Police said the parties were stopped due
to complaints of excessive noise. The three
were the Rinc-a-delt Party and the Delta
Upsilon Hula Party on Saturday night and
the Florence Moore/Miller High Life Party
Sunday afternoon.
Organizers of the Rinc-a-delt Party com
plained that the police offered no options to
closing the party. Rinconada Resident As
sistant Dave Ellison said, "We didn't find out
about it (the excessive noise) until it was too
late."
According to Moore, the police were

"overworked" and did not have time to
make concessions, but he added, "We've al
ways bent over backwards to be as agreeable
and amenable as we can."
Moore agreed to attempts at "earlier
notification" of complaints to party or
ganizers in future police actions. He said
that at this point officers do not contact stu
dents until numerous complaints are
received, but said an earlier warning could
lead to more flexibility for both the police
and party planners.
The sound system used at the Rinc-a-delt
Party could not be turned down and directly
faced faculty housing, according to Moore.
Speakers at the Donner Street Party a week
earlier had been directed toward Palo Alto,
requiring sound to travel a much greater dis
tance before reaching homes, he added.
Moore said he received only one complaint
about the party that evening.
Robin Hensley, program assistant to Res
idential Education, outlined additional
precautions students could take to decrease
the chance of party closure.
She suggested that equipment could be

tested before the party for noise levels, add
ing that technicians from University Events
and Services can arrange sound systems to
minimize noise. Party organizers, however,
would be responsible for payment of the ser
vice.
Hensley also suggested that in the future,
party organizers notify the police before the
party and provide the name of an individual
available at all times during the party who
would act as a "connector" between police
and students.
Police officers responding to the Rinc-a
delt Party said they could not find anyone in
charge with whom to negotiate and had no
choice but to close the party.
Hensley also suggested that party plan
ners distribute fliers to alert area residents
of upcoming parties and to ask them to con
tact party planners before calling the police
if a party is too loud.
In the event that a party is halted, Moore
urged organizers to "project a positive atti
tude of why the party is closing" to prevent
possible skirmishes among disappointed
party-goers.
