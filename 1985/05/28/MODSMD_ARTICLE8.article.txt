Shiites scuttle camp rescue mission
BEIRUT— A Red Cross team rescued 14 wounded Palestinians yes
terday from Beirut's Bourj el-Barajneh refugee camp, but raced out un
der fire 30 minutes later when a cease-fire between Shiite Moslems and
Palestinians broke down.
Palestinian spokesmen issued a statement saying fighters of Amal, the
main Shiite militia, stopped ambulances leaving the camp and "beat up
some of the wounded at a checkpoint near the Grand Prophet mosque"
at the camp entrance.
Reporters and photographers were kept away from the Red Cross
•vehicles.
But from a distance one photographer, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, saw militiamen cocking their rifles and pounding on the am
bulances with weapons and fists. He could not tell if any of the wounded
were assaulted.
A Lebanese gunman present at the scene later told The Associated
Press: "Yes. It's true. They beat them up. I can say no more."
He spoke on condition neither he nor the militia group he belongs to
be identified.
Red Cross officials could not be reached for comment.
Scores of wounded had to be left behind for a second day.
The truce called by Shiites and Palestinian guerrillas to aid the Red
Cross mercy mission lasted only long enough for six ambulances out of a
17-vehicle convoy to get into the shell-battered camp.
The Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Chatilla, in the west
Beirut area, and Bourj el-Barajneh were besieged by Shiites on May 19.
The Shiites want to prevent the Palestinians from rebuilding the power
base in Beirut that was destroyed in the 1982 Israeli invasion.
Police said eight people were killed and 35 wounded yesterday in the
camps, raising the known toll to 369 killed and 1,693 wounded in the
war for the refugee camps.
Sophie Martin, chief delegate of the International Red Cross in
Beirut, said the team at Bourj el-Barajneh brought out 14 Palestinians
yesterday.
The evacuees were bound for hospitals in the Chouf mountains east of
the capital that are controlled by the Druse. The Moslem sect's warlord,
Walid Jumblatt, arranged Monday's brief cease-fire.
The Red Cross chief said the Red Cross will try again today to rescue
"hundreds of civilians, including wounded" trapped in Bourj el-
Barajneh's Haifa Hospital.
Palestinian sources have said there were about 250 wounded lying in
the sprawling Bourj el-Barajneh camp on Beirut's southern outskirts.
They said many of their casualties bled to death in the camps because of
lack of medical facilities and medicine.
Palestinian spokesmen have claimed Shiite militiamen slaughtered
hundreds of wounded Palestinians and civilians in the bloody fighting for
the camps.
But there has been no independent confirmation. No reporters or
relief agencies have yet been able to get into the camp to see the bodies
for themselves.
The battles around the three camps eased yesterday. The heaviest
fighting was around Sabra, where a handful of Palestinians have fought
off repeated Shiite attacks.
Spanish tanker explosions kill 16
ALGECIRAS, Spain — Explosions tore through two oil tankers
docked at a refinery across from the Rock of Gibraltar Sunday, killing at
least 16 people and leaving 19 missing, an official said.
Heat from the flaming hulks kept police frogmen from searching for
more bodies, said Mariano Baquedano, civil governor of the province of
Cadiz.
The Spanish Merchant Marine in Madrid issued a statement saying the
explosions could have been caused by gases that accumulated in the hold
of one tanker, the Petragen One, as it unloaded a cargo of naphtha.
Witnesses said the explosions engulfed the wharf in flames in this
southern Spanish port.
Bacquedano reported 34 men were hospitalized for injuries suffered
when at least two explosions rocked the Panamanian-registered
Petragen One and the Spanish tanker Camponavia.
Both tankers were docked in front of the Gibraltar refinery, owned by
the Spanish company CEPSA. Refinery manager Jose Maria Pons told
The Associated Press that the Petragen One had picked up 20,000 tons
of naphtha in Libya.
The Camponavia, moored at the wharf close by, was taking on a load
of gasoline from the refinery, Pons said. The tankers' destinations were
not immediately known.
Pons said all indications were that the first explosion occurred in the
Petragen One, which he said sank in flames. He said the Spanish tanker
broke in two.
Pope's assassin calls himself Christ
ROME — The star prosecution witness in the papal shooting plot,
Mehmet Ali Agca, disrupted the first day of proceedings twice yesterday
— shouting that he was Jesus Christ and insisting that he was not crazy.
The state has built almost its entire case for a Bulgarian conspiracy in
the 1981 shooting of Pope John Paul II on the testimony of Agca, the
man who pulled the trigger.
Prosecutor Antonio Marini charges that Bulgaria, possibly with Soviet
support, masterminded the plot to kill the pope because of his support
for the Solidarity free trade union in his native Poland.
Agca is serving a life sentence for the attempt on the pope's life May
13, 1981, but is currently on trial on gun charges. The Turkish terrorist
had turned state's evidence and repudiated his original story that he
acted alone, and his testimony led to the indictments of three Bulgarians
and four Turks.
Of the defendants, only one of the Bulgarians and two Turks besides
Agca are in custody. The others are being tried in absentia.
"I am Jesus Christ! I am omnipotent!" Agca shouted in Italian from
inside his defendant's cage. "I announce the end of the world! The world
will be destroyed!"
Dozens of journalists jumped onto chairs and tables to see and hear
him.
A court official ordered him removed and he was led out by three
guafds. Five minutes later he was brought back into the fortress-like
courtroom, a converted gymnasium, and sat quietly.
Then when he was brought out of the cage to testify, he interrupted
the proceedings again.
Judge Severino Santiapichi cut him off with the comment: "I am run
ning this trial."
Allowed to speak again, Agca said, "I am a man completely sane of
mind. 1 am a rational man, rather intelligent."
The trial was adjourned until today because the sound system broke
down while Agca was testifying and it was impossible for anyone to hear
him.
Kuwaiti ruler survives car bomb
KUWAIT — Security forces rounded up suspects and a dragnet was
spread in this tiny Persian Gulf emirate on Sunday, one day after a
suicide car-bomb driver failed in his attempt to kill the ruler of Kuwait.
The 56-year-old emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmcd al-Sabah, resumed his
regular duties Sunday and met leaders of other oil-rich gulf countries,
who rallied around the Arab monarch in show of support.
President Reagan and the Soviet leadership also sent messages to
Jaber, denouncing the attempt on his life, Kuwaiti officials reported.
The emir suffered minor injuries, but the terrorist and three other
people perished in the explosion.
Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, visited
the emir on Sunday. He said Palestinians "stand fast in the same trench
with the Kuwaiti people against criminal perpetration at the leadership
and the country's establishments."
In Beirut, Lebanon, the terrorist Jihad Islami organization claimed re
sponsibility two hours after the attack. The group threatened new assas
sination attempts if 17 convicted terrorists now behind bars in Kuwait
were not freed Jihad Islami is believed comprised of fundamentalist
Moslems linked to Iran.

docked at a refinery across from the Rock of Gibraltar Sunday, killing at
least 16 people and leaving 19 missing, an official said.
Heat from the flaming hulks kept police frogmen from searching for
more bodies, said Mariano Baquedano, civil governor of the province of
Cadiz.
The Spanish Merchant Marine in Madrid issued a statement saying the
explosions could have been caused by gases that accumulated in the hold
of one tanker, the Petragen One, as it unloaded a cargo of naphtha.
Witnesses said the explosions engulfed the wharf in flames in this
southern Spanish port.
Bacquedano reported 34 men were hospitalized for injuries suffered
when at least two explosions rocked the Panamanian-registered
Petragen One and the Spanish tanker Camponavia.
Both tankers were docked in front of the Gibraltar refinery, owned by
the Spanish company CEPSA. Refinery manager Jose Maria Pons told
The Associated Press that the Petragen One had picked up 20,000 tons
of naphtha in Libya.
The Camponavia, moored at the wharf close by, was taking on a load
of gasoline from the refinery, Pons said. The tankers' destinations were
not immediately known.
Pons said all indications were that the first explosion occurred in the
Petragen One, which he said sank in flames. He said the Spanish tanker
broke in two.
Pope's assassin calls himself Christ
ROME — The star prosecution witness in the papal shooting plot,
Mehmet Ali Agca, disrupted the first day of proceedings twice yesterday
— shouting that he was Jesus Christ and insisting that he was not crazy.
The state has built almost its entire case for a Bulgarian conspiracy in
the 1981 shooting of Pope John Paul II on the testimony of Agca, the
man who pulled the trigger.
Prosecutor Antonio Marini charges that Bulgaria, possibly with Soviet
support, masterminded the plot to kill the pope because of his support
for the Solidarity free trade union in his native Poland.
Agca is serving a life sentence for the attempt on the pope's life May
13, 1981, but is currently on trial on gun charges. The Turkish terrorist
had turned state's evidence and repudiated his original story that he
acted alone, and his testimony led to the indictments of three Bulgarians
and four Turks.
Of the defendants, only one of the Bulgarians and two Turks besides
Agca are in custody. The others are being tried in absentia.
"I am Jesus Christ! I am omnipotent!" Agca shouted in Italian from
inside his defendant's cage. "I announce the end of the world! The world
will be destroyed!"
Dozens of journalists jumped onto chairs and tables to see and hear
him.
A court official ordered him removed and he was led out by three
guafds. Five minutes later he was brought back into the fortress-like
courtroom, a converted gymnasium, and sat quietly.
Then when he was brought out of the cage to testify, he interrupted
the proceedings again.
Judge Severino Santiapichi cut him off with the comment: "I am run
ning this trial."
Allowed to speak again, Agca said, "I am a man completely sane of
mind. 1 am a rational man, rather intelligent."
The trial was adjourned until today because the sound system broke
down while Agca was testifying and it was impossible for anyone to hear
him.
Kuwaiti ruler survives car bomb
KUWAIT — Security forces rounded up suspects and a dragnet was
spread in this tiny Persian Gulf emirate on Sunday, one day after a
suicide car-bomb driver failed in his attempt to kill the ruler of Kuwait.
The 56-year-old emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmcd al-Sabah, resumed his
regular duties Sunday and met leaders of other oil-rich gulf countries,
who rallied around the Arab monarch in show of support.
President Reagan and the Soviet leadership also sent messages to
Jaber, denouncing the attempt on his life, Kuwaiti officials reported.
The emir suffered minor injuries, but the terrorist and three other
people perished in the explosion.
Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, visited
the emir on Sunday. He said Palestinians "stand fast in the same trench
with the Kuwaiti people against criminal perpetration at the leadership
and the country's establishments."
In Beirut, Lebanon, the terrorist Jihad Islami organization claimed re
sponsibility two hours after the attack. The group threatened new assas
sination attempts if 17 convicted terrorists now behind bars in Kuwait
were not freed Jihad Islami is believed comprised of fundamentalist
Moslems linked to Iran.
Shiites scuttle camp rescue mission
BEIRUT— A Red Cross team rescued 14 wounded Palestinians yes
terday from Beirut's Bourj el-Barajneh refugee camp, but raced out un
der fire 30 minutes later when a cease-fire between Shiite Moslems and
Palestinians broke down.
Palestinian spokesmen issued a statement saying fighters of Amal, the
main Shiite militia, stopped ambulances leaving the camp and "beat up
some of the wounded at a checkpoint near the Grand Prophet mosque"
at the camp entrance.
Reporters and photographers were kept away from the Red Cross
•vehicles.
But from a distance one photographer, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, saw militiamen cocking their rifles and pounding on the am
bulances with weapons and fists. He could not tell if any of the wounded
were assaulted.
A Lebanese gunman present at the scene later told The Associated
Press: "Yes. It's true. They beat them up. I can say no more."
He spoke on condition neither he nor the militia group he belongs to
be identified.
Red Cross officials could not be reached for comment.
Scores of wounded had to be left behind for a second day.
The truce called by Shiites and Palestinian guerrillas to aid the Red
Cross mercy mission lasted only long enough for six ambulances out of a
17-vehicle convoy to get into the shell-battered camp.
The Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Chatilla, in the west
Beirut area, and Bourj el-Barajneh were besieged by Shiites on May 19.
The Shiites want to prevent the Palestinians from rebuilding the power
base in Beirut that was destroyed in the 1982 Israeli invasion.
Police said eight people were killed and 35 wounded yesterday in the
camps, raising the known toll to 369 killed and 1,693 wounded in the
war for the refugee camps.
Sophie Martin, chief delegate of the International Red Cross in
Beirut, said the team at Bourj el-Barajneh brought out 14 Palestinians
yesterday.
The evacuees were bound for hospitals in the Chouf mountains east of
the capital that are controlled by the Druse. The Moslem sect's warlord,
Walid Jumblatt, arranged Monday's brief cease-fire.
The Red Cross chief said the Red Cross will try again today to rescue
"hundreds of civilians, including wounded" trapped in Bourj el-
Barajneh's Haifa Hospital.
Palestinian sources have said there were about 250 wounded lying in
the sprawling Bourj el-Barajneh camp on Beirut's southern outskirts.
They said many of their casualties bled to death in the camps because of
lack of medical facilities and medicine.
Palestinian spokesmen have claimed Shiite militiamen slaughtered
hundreds of wounded Palestinians and civilians in the bloody fighting for
the camps.
But there has been no independent confirmation. No reporters or
relief agencies have yet been able to get into the camp to see the bodies
for themselves.
The battles around the three camps eased yesterday. The heaviest
fighting was around Sabra, where a handful of Palestinians have fought
off repeated Shiite attacks.
