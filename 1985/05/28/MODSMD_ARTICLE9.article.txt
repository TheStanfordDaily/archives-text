DHAKA, Bangladesh â€” Tens of thousands of
people are feared dead in a typhoon that roared in
from the Bay of Bengal, driving enormous waves
that swept the flat bay islands clean and devastated
coastal communities.
The official count of dead yesterday was 3,000,
but an Indian news agency said it had reports of
20,000 dead and 40,000 missing. A district official
in Chittagong, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, told The Associated Press that the mis
sing people were washed away by the storm and
were presumed dead.
In Geneva, Switzerland, the International Com
mittee of the Red Cross said it had an official death
count of 3,000. It said it had unconfirmed reports
of 40,000 dead in the storm, which struck on Satur
day, but "we discount these at the present time."
It added, however, that Red Cross officials
"report cadavers of people in the sea, cadavers of
animals in the sea, the crops completely destroyed,
washed out. Several islands are completely covered
in water.
"Several islands have become completely
denuded of people, of houses, of cattle, of dwell

ings. The situation on the ground is pretty desper
ate."
"The storm reached 140 miles per hour. . .. Our
people there say the entire population of Sandwip,
Pirbaksh and Pukiarchaga islands have been swept
away. Dwellings, crops, cattle and people in coastal
areas and offshore islands have simply disap
peared."
The Press Trust of India news agency attributed
its casualty figures only to "reports from outlying
areas." The figures could not be confirmed through
other sources.
It said in a dispatch from Dhaka that the death
toll could reach 40,000 and said 200,000 people
were left homeless by the storm, the worst to hit the
region since a hurricane that killed 300,000 people
in 1970.
Radio Bangladesh quoted official sources as
saying 1,500 people were confirmed dead 20,000
were missing, the agency reported. Many fishing
boats were at sea when the storm swept in.
The Bangladesh Observer, an English-language
daily, quoted unofficial sources as saying more than
25,000 people were missing.
"The devastation in the area is beyond descrip

tion," the agency quoted President Hussain
Mohammed Ershad as saying after visiting Sandwip
island, one of a chain of small islands off the south
ern coast of Bangladesh.
Ershad postponed a scheduled trip to China to
visit the region. He ordered air force helicopters
and four navy ships to join army and air force res
cue teams.
The president decreed a nationwide day of
mourning today, his press secretary said, with the
flag to be flown at half staff and prayers at all places
of worship.
Ershad called a special Cabinet meeting to
review the situation and plan emergency action to
be taken by his military government.
Officials in the Cyclone Control Room at the
chief martial law administrator's office said most of
the confirmed deaths were in the coastal district of
Noakhali.
The mass circulation Bengali-language daily The
Ittefaq quoted a forestry official it did not identify
as saying 7,000 of Urirchar Island's 10,000 resi
dents were feared dead.
It quoted survivors as saying waves 25 feet high
swept over the island.
