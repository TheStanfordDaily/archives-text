r IF YOU LIKE STANFORD UNIVERSITY
YOU'LL LOVE THE STANFORD FLYING CLUB
Nothing more logical than that. You come to Stanford for the concentrated,
innovative education that gives you a lead on life.
At Stanford Flying Club we offer the same kind of high-quality education that
will continue to give you the edge long after you have left the University. We can
help you learn to fly, everything from your first Solo, through all the advanced
licenses including instrument, Commerical, and the Airline Transport license. We
can help you learn to fly, for the sheer fun of It, and for the freedom of being able
to travel fast and affordably at the controls of an airplane.
Because the new training program at the Stanford Flying Club carefully
integrates the latest educational techniques and flight technologies. In flight and
on the ground you work one on one with an experienced instructor-pilot. Most
students obtain their Solo License in only 9 to 18 hours of flight time. And
because the Stanford Flying Club is a non-profit organization, the rates are low.
Many pilots have Learned to Fly for less than $572.
So join the Stanford Flying Club. -
Learn to fly. You'll love It.
