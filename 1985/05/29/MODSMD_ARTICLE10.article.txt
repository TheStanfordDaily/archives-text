Army alters liquor rules
Eighteen-year-old Airman Mark Kellman will
become underage Saturday. And he doesn't like
it.
By order of the Pentagon, military bases
around the country must conform Saturday to the
drinking age laws of the states where they are lo
cated. And Kellman and thousands of other ser
vice men and women under 21 will no longer be
able to drink legally.
"If I'm old enough to sign a paper saying I'm
willing to die for my country, I think it's
ridiculous to say I can't drink liquor," said Kel
lman, of Tampa, Fla., who is based at Ellsworth
Air Force Base, S.D.
It's a sentiment shared at his base and else
where.
But orders are orders. With a few exceptions,
the Defense Department's new policy will mean
no more on-base drinks for many 18,19 and 20-
year-olds in uniform.
The Pentagon estimates that nearly 400,000 of
the 2.1 million men and women on active duty
are under the age of 21:

United talks called futile
CHICAGO — United Airlines said yesterday
there was no point in resuming talks with striking
pilots, and announced it was rebuilding what had
been the nation's largest air carrier before the
strike began 12 days ago.
The union accused the company of trying to
destroy it.
The statements were made at back-to-back
news conferences as the walkout continued by
about 5,000 pilots. Talks collapsed Saturday
morning after negotiators resolved most eco
nomic issues during a 23-hour bargaining session,
but couldn't settle on a back-to-work agreement.
"1 do not think further talks at this point in
time would be of any benefit," said Richard Fer
ris, United's chairman and chief executive offi
cer. He said United's objective now is to "rebuild
this airline" with new pilots and with workers
who have crossed picket lines.
He estimated the airline could be back to full
operation by the end of the first quarter of 1986.
John Leßoy, a spokesman for the Air Line
Pilots Association, said the union was on standby

and willing to meet with United negotiators.
He also said United is not fighting an economic
battle, but wants to break the union.
A tentative agreement had been reached on
the major strike issue — a two-tier wage scale
that would put newly hired pilots on a lower scale
than current pilots.
Pilots had opposed the two tiers, saying it
would create animosity. But the company argued
it was necessary to remain cost-competitive.
In recent days, United has flown 209 flights, or
about 14 percent of its 1,550-a-day regular flight
schedule.
Stock advance falters
The stock market showed no clear trend yes
terday after an early advance faltered.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
more than 5 points in early trading, finished with
a .45 loss at 1,301.52.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
came to 90.60 million shares, against 85.97 mil
lion last Friday.
