High schoolers deficient
SACRAMENTO — Fewer California high
school students are meeting current eligibility
standards for admission to the state university
and University of California at the same time
those institutions are raising standards, a
legislative panel was told yesterday.
The report by the California Postsecondary
Education Committee sparked a sharp division
between members of the Assembly Subcommit
tee on Higher Education as to whether secondary
schools or the universities are to blame.
Assemblywoman Teresa Hughes (D-Los An
geles) said the report "points an accusing finger
back at the university — both the UC and CSU
(California State University) system that you arc
not extending the leadership and cooperation" to
improve high school programs.
But Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-
Thousand Oaks) complained that the universities

"should not be made the whipping boys for the
deficiencies of the secondary schools."
But there was general consensus that higher
admission stardards will have the most severe im
pact on minority students unless remedial courses
and special admission programs are expanded.
The study found that the percentage of public
high school graduates meeting UC and state uni
versity admission standards has dropped for
seven consecutive years, reflecting both lower
high school grades and lower admission test
scores.
Referring to what he called "a dismal report,"
subcommittee chairman Tom Hayden (D-Santa
Monica) said he thought one of the most signifi
cant statistics was that white students were ex
actly on the target set by the state 25 years ago,
with exactly one-third meeting state university
admission standards, while only 15.3 percent of
the Hispanic students and 10.1 percent of the
black students qualified.

"In the pursuit of excellence, we'll leave out
quite a few who do not start from a position of
excellence," Hayden said.
John Bedell, acting associate vice chancellor of
the 19-campus state university system, said he
was "very distressed" that many high schools in
California with high minority populations do not
even offer the courses needed for students to go
directly to the university.
