## Computer helps doctors treat cancer patients 
### ERIC ENDO 
Researchers at the Stanford Medi
cal Center have developed an artifi
cial intelligence computer program,
called ONCOCIN, to assist
physicians in treating cancer patients.
Although ONCOCIN is still exper
imental, physicians can consult it re
garding therapies for Hodgkin's
disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas,
breast cancer and one type of lung
cancer.
ONCOCIN operates like a human
consultant. First, it requests patient
information from the physician. The
physician answers by typing on a spe
cialized key pad.
When it has enough information,
ONCOCIN uses artificial intelligence
techniques to understand the pa
tient's situation. By weighing facts
and applying its information about
medicine, ONCOCIN makes recom
mendations on the patient's chemo
therapy plan.
Physicians use many drugs — most
of which are toxic — to kill the can
cerous cells that have multiplied in a
patient's body. Patients usually
receive these drugs in cycles over the
course of months. Radiation therapy
may also be part of the treatment
jegimen.
"The ideal therapy for most can
cers is not yet known," says Edward
Shortliffe, associate professor of
medicine and computer science and a
principle investigator of the ON
COCIN project. "To improve
therapy strategies, formal experi
ments, call protocols, are conducted
to compare therapeutic benefits and
side effects of accepted treatments
with»those of alternate therapies
believed to be of equal or greater
value."
Cancer therapy planning is compli
cated. Oncologists describe each
protocol in a lengthy written docu
ment that is usually from 50 to 60
pages. These documents contain
details on drug dosages, treatment
schedules, therapy adjustments and
laboratory tests needed to evaluate
drug effectiveness and toxicity.
Each documents includes many
treatment guidelines. At the medical
center, an oncologist may have to re
member the finer points of more than
50 different protocols.
ONCOCIN is designed to help on
cologists with these details. It
monitors the course of a patient's
treatment, specifies required labora-

tory tests and recommends therapy
changes when appropriate.
For example, certain drugs used in
chemotherapy will kill white blood
cells, which play an important role in
combating infection. If a patient's
white blood cell count drops con
siderably, the patient's oncologist
must modify the chemotherapy plan.
The oncologist may decide to
decrease the dosage of certain drugs,
remove one or more drugs from the
therapy or postpone therapy altoget
her.
The protocol document spells out
guidelines for these revisions. ON
COCIN knows these guidelines and
can make recommendations to the
oncologist. At that point, the on
cologist can follow the recommenda

tion or override ONCOCIN's advice.
Like a human consultant, ON
COCIN explains its recommen
dations. "Explanation is a key ele
ment of this project," says Christop
her Lane, the project's systems
programmer., "ONCOCIN is de
signed to build up explanations as it
goes along. So when a doctor wants to
know how it came up with a certain
conclusion, the computer can explain
the details."
Shortliffe and Charlotte Jacobs, as
sistant professor of medicine and an
other principle investigator of ON
COCIN, started the project by gath
ering information from treatment
protocols used in Hodgkin's disease
and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. This
information was translated into "if

then" rules, employing a logic that
computers readily understand.
ONCOCIN's knowledge and
reasoning capacity is represented in
the program by a series of these if
then rules. The "if' part of the rule
considers the patient's situation; the
"then" part dictates a specific course
of action.
An example of an if-then rule is the
following: If a patient's white blood
cell count drops below a given value,
then reduce the dosage of drug A by
30 percent.
"There can be several hundred of
these if-then rules in one protocol
document," says David Combs, an
applications programmer on the proj
ect. "When ONCOCIN has enough
information, it tries to fiqure out

which rules apply, then it carries out
those rules in the form of a therapy
recommendation."
When only a few rules apply, treat
ing a patient is straightforward.
Treatment becomes complicated,
however, when many of these if-then
rules apply to a particular situation.
"ONCOCIN may appear to be
very literal," says Larry Fagan, the
project director. "However, it is im
portant to remember that we don't
tell the computer what to recommend
for every conceivable situation.
"Instead, we supply it with infor
mation and instructions on how to put
bits of information together. The
computer then integrates incoming
information on its own," Fagan con
tinues.

"ONCOCIN is literal in the sense
that we supply the facts, hut we never
quite know how they will fit together.
When these programs get large, the
information sometimes fits together
in ways we never expected," Fagan
says.
How is ONCOCIN performing?
Physicians in the oncology clinic have
supported ONCOCIN since they
began using it in May 1981.
Also, formal studies have been per
formed to compare ONCOCIN's
decisions with those of real on
cologists. "We have looked at the
quality of advice offered by the com
puter relative to the opinions of ex
perts who care for lymphoma
patients," says She: tliffe. "That study
shows excellent performance of the
computer relative to the experts."
ONCOCIN is doing well, but mem
bers on the project continue to in
crease its sophistication.
The first version of ONCOCIN run
on a large timesharing computer sys
tem. Timesharing means that many
people use the computer system at
the same time. As a result, computer
response was slow, and oncologists
using ONCOCIN sometimes had to
wait for answers. In a busy clinic, this
presented a problem.
The ONCOCIN group is now
transferring programs from the old
system to newer and smaller com
puters that offer quick responses and
high resolution graphics. Because the
new system is not based on timeshar
ing, it will operate through indepen
dent work stations that are more ac
cessible and flexible.
Also, the new system can be moved
to other locations, unlike the old ver
sion. Ultimately, the ONCOCIN
group wants to implement the system
outside of Stanford, allowing more
clinics to participate in cancer
protocol therapy.
One of the problems facing the
ONCOCIN project, and all artificial
intelligence research, is improving the
process of entering data into the com
puter. Ideally, ONCOCIN would
work most efficiently if physicians
could enter knowledge directly into
the computer. Today, however,
programmers are required to
translate the physician's knowledge
into a language the computer under
stands.
To improve knowledge acquisition,


(Curtesy News and Publications
the ONCOCIN group is working on a
program called OPAL. It allows
physicians, by completing forms dis
played on the computer screen, to en
ter new protocol knowledge directly
into the computer. These forms put
knowledge in a format that is under
standable by both the physician and
the computer.
The ONCOCIN group is also
working to improve ONCOCIN's
ability to deal with uncertainty.
Today, ONCOCIN can only deal with
patient situations that are described
in a protocol document. These docu
ments, however, do not address every
circumstance that may arise in a pa
tient's therapy program. Otherwise,
the document would be many pages
more than 50.
When ONCOCIN runs into an un
usual situation, one that is not ad
dressed in the protocol document, it
cannot make a recommendation. Its
response is "I don't know. I don't
have enough information."
These special cases are referred to
an oncologist who is experienced in
designing protocol therapy, usually
the one who wrote the particular
document.
"ONCOCIN has problems with
patients that have been off protocol
treatment for three to four weeks,"
says Fagan. "At that point, the
clinician tries to straighten out the sit
uation.
"If a patient is off therapy, he
knows that the tumor has probably
grown. He may order an X-ray, to
check. If a patient's white blood cell
count is down, he knows the patient
is probably reacting poorly to the
chemotherapy. He might omit one of
the drugs from the treatment
regimen."
ONCOCIN currently cannot rea
son at this level. Its knowledge of
medicine is still superficial. ON
COCIN does not know the
physiologic effect of chemother
apeutic drugs on white blood cells.
It does not know that a decrease in
white blood cells will compromise a
patient's ability to fight off infection.
All it knows is to recommend an ac
tion when the white blood cell count
drops below a certain level.
"Much of medicine," says
Shortliffe, "is based on the ability to
deal with exceptions, to be creative in
understanding how underlying mech
anisms of biochemistry and patho
physiology account for the nuances of

patient problems."
The ONCOCIN group is working
to increase the system's reasoning
ability in a program called ONYX.
ONYX is still in its early stages of de
velopment, but its goals are clear.
The ONCOCIN group is trying to
model the way physicians appear to
reason in clinical settings. They are
providing the computer with knowl
edge on the human body, cancer and
the drugs used in treating cancer.
They hope the computer will make
sense of this knowledge and use it to
make reasonable recommendations
on cancer patients Who are off
protocol therapy.
"ONYX's strategy is based on the
way oncologists appear to think,"
says Fagan. "In addition to making
suggestions about drug therapy, we
would also like ONYX to predict
what is going to happen to a patient in
the future, based on what ONYX
knows."
Both ONCOCIN and ONYX use
heuristics — problem-solving meth
ods commonly called "rules of
thumb." There is no guarantee that
an heuristic is correct, but it is a good
guess.
Chess players, for example, do not
know the best sequence of moves, be
cause they don't consider every possi
ble sequence. There are simply too
many permutations to analyze.
Instead, they use rules of thumb for
guidance. For example, they may try
to control the center of the board, or
they may check their opponent's
king, whenever possible.
A player using these rules does not
always make the best possible move.
But heuristics help players to make
decisions and cope with uncertainty.
In some ways, playing chess is like
making medical decisions. Some deci
sions are clouded with uncertainty,
and physicians must rely on an appro
priate method of reasoning. They of
ten turn to heuristics.
Medical heuristics are represented
in ONCOCIN and ONYX as if-then
statements. The computer can under
stand them in this form.
"ONCOCIN uses heuristics," says
Fagan, "but because ONCOCIN fol
lows a specific protocol, most of its
knowledge consists of specific facts.
There is little uncertainty.
"In ONYX, we are using more
rules of thumb, because there are no
protocol guidelines to follow. There
are no guaranteed strategies. There
are no right answers necessarily, since
ONYX deals with patients when
protocol rules no longer apply.
"Using heuristics is a kind of ball
park approach. Computer programs

weigh these guesses to come up with
an answer. That's what ONYX does.
ONCOCIN, on the other hand,
doesn't try to guess. It integrates
mostly factual information to come
up with answers," says Fagan.
What is the ultimate goal of this re
search? Someday, Fagan would like
to see the invention of an "intelligent
textbook."
Today, physicians must skim
through the pages of an entire medi
cal textbook, even when they want
only specific information on a pa
tient's condition. Someday, a
physican may simply describe a pa
tient's situation to a computer, and

the computer will supply specific and
thorough information regarding the
patient's case.
"To achieve this goal, researchers
in artificial intelligence are trying to
develop better ways of entering and
representing knowledge in the com
puter," says Fagan. "For example,
how does one represent common
sense knowledge in the computer?
Programs like ONCOCIN need com
mon sense. Ideally, the computer
should know if a calculated answer is
reasonable.
"Artificial intelligence is getting
better and better at knowledge entry

and representation, but there is still a
lot of work ahead of us. Computer
programs are nowhere near the point
where they can read a book, scan the
text and pick out relevant informa
tion. Also, researchers continue to
work on ways of representing knowl
edge in the computer so that it is
more accessible and usable to
people," Fagan says.
The development of an intelligent
textbook is years away. Nevertheless,
projects like ONCOCIN help people
make decisions today.
This research also helps experts,
like physicians, in a way that few an
ticipated. In order for programs like

ONCOCIN to be developed, experts
must supply their knowledge for inte
gration into the program; this forces
people to articulate their understand
ing of the field.
"Computers are not flexible
enough to work like people's minds
seem to work," says Fagan.
"Consequently, it forces people to or
ganize their thinking.
"Experts that go through this
debriefing process often tell us that
they are never the same, because they
were forced to write down how they
reason, step by step. In the process,
some of them made important dis
coveries in their fields of study."

COCIN knows these guidelines and
can make recommendations to the
oncologist. At that point, the on
cologist can follow the recommenda

tion or override ONCOCIN's advice.
Like a human consultant, ON
COCIN explains its recommen
dations. "Explanation is a key ele
ment of this project," says Christop
her Lane, the project's systems
programmer., "ONCOCIN is de
signed to build up explanations as it
goes along. So when a doctor wants to
know how it came up with a certain
conclusion, the computer can explain
the details."
Shortliffe and Charlotte Jacobs, as
sistant professor of medicine and an
other principle investigator of ON
COCIN, started the project by gath
ering information from treatment
protocols used in Hodgkin's disease
and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. This
information was translated into "if

then" rules, employing a logic that
computers readily understand.
ONCOCIN's knowledge and
reasoning capacity is represented in
the program by a series of these if
then rules. The "if' part of the rule
considers the patient's situation; the
"then" part dictates a specific course
of action.
An example of an if-then rule is the
following: If a patient's white blood
cell count drops below a given value,
then reduce the dosage of drug A by
30 percent.
"There can be several hundred of
these if-then rules in one protocol
document," says David Combs, an
applications programmer on the proj
ect. "When ONCOCIN has enough
information, it tries to fiqure out

which rules apply, then it carries out
those rules in the form of a therapy
recommendation."
When only a few rules apply, treat
ing a patient is straightforward.
Treatment becomes complicated,
however, when many of these if-then
rules apply to a particular situation.
"ONCOCIN may appear to be
very literal," says Larry Fagan, the
project director. "However, it is im
portant to remember that we don't
tell the computer what to recommend
for every conceivable situation.
"Instead, we supply it with infor
mation and instructions on how to put
bits of information together. The
computer then integrates incoming
information on its own," Fagan con
tinues.

"ONCOCIN is literal in the sense
that we supply the facts, hut we never
quite know how they will fit together.
When these programs get large, the
information sometimes fits together
in ways we never expected," Fagan
says.
How is ONCOCIN performing?
Physicians in the oncology clinic have
supported ONCOCIN since they
began using it in May 1981.
Also, formal studies have been per
formed to compare ONCOCIN's
decisions with those of real on
cologists. "We have looked at the
quality of advice offered by the com
puter relative to the opinions of ex
perts who care for lymphoma
patients," says She: tliffe. "That study
shows excellent performance of the
computer relative to the experts."
ONCOCIN is doing well, but mem
bers on the project continue to in
crease its sophistication.
The first version of ONCOCIN run
on a large timesharing computer sys
tem. Timesharing means that many
people use the computer system at
the same time. As a result, computer
response was slow, and oncologists
using ONCOCIN sometimes had to
wait for answers. In a busy clinic, this
presented a problem.
The ONCOCIN group is now
transferring programs from the old
system to newer and smaller com
puters that offer quick responses and
high resolution graphics. Because the
new system is not based on timeshar
ing, it will operate through indepen
dent work stations that are more ac
cessible and flexible.
Also, the new system can be moved
to other locations, unlike the old ver
sion. Ultimately, the ONCOCIN
group wants to implement the system
outside of Stanford, allowing more
clinics to participate in cancer
protocol therapy.
One of the problems facing the
ONCOCIN project, and all artificial
intelligence research, is improving the
process of entering data into the com
puter. Ideally, ONCOCIN would
work most efficiently if physicians
could enter knowledge directly into
the computer. Today, however,
programmers are required to
translate the physician's knowledge
into a language the computer under
stands.
To improve knowledge acquisition,


(Curtesy News and Publications
the ONCOCIN group is working on a
program called OPAL. It allows
physicians, by completing forms dis
played on the computer screen, to en
ter new protocol knowledge directly
into the computer. These forms put
knowledge in a format that is under
standable by both the physician and
the computer.
The ONCOCIN group is also
working to improve ONCOCIN's
ability to deal with uncertainty.
Today, ONCOCIN can only deal with
patient situations that are described
in a protocol document. These docu
ments, however, do not address every
circumstance that may arise in a pa
tient's therapy program. Otherwise,
the document would be many pages
more than 50.
When ONCOCIN runs into an un
usual situation, one that is not ad
dressed in the protocol document, it
cannot make a recommendation. Its
response is "I don't know. I don't
have enough information."
These special cases are referred to
an oncologist who is experienced in
designing protocol therapy, usually
the one who wrote the particular
document.
"ONCOCIN has problems with
patients that have been off protocol
treatment for three to four weeks,"
says Fagan. "At that point, the
clinician tries to straighten out the sit
uation.
"If a patient is off therapy, he
knows that the tumor has probably
grown. He may order an X-ray, to
check. If a patient's white blood cell
count is down, he knows the patient
is probably reacting poorly to the
chemotherapy. He might omit one of
the drugs from the treatment
regimen."
ONCOCIN currently cannot rea
son at this level. Its knowledge of
medicine is still superficial. ON
COCIN does not know the
physiologic effect of chemother
apeutic drugs on white blood cells.
It does not know that a decrease in
white blood cells will compromise a
patient's ability to fight off infection.
All it knows is to recommend an ac
tion when the white blood cell count
drops below a certain level.
"Much of medicine," says
Shortliffe, "is based on the ability to
deal with exceptions, to be creative in
understanding how underlying mech
anisms of biochemistry and patho
physiology account for the nuances of

patient problems."
The ONCOCIN group is working
to increase the system's reasoning
ability in a program called ONYX.
ONYX is still in its early stages of de
velopment, but its goals are clear.
The ONCOCIN group is trying to
model the way physicians appear to
reason in clinical settings. They are
providing the computer with knowl
edge on the human body, cancer and
the drugs used in treating cancer.
They hope the computer will make
sense of this knowledge and use it to
make reasonable recommendations
on cancer patients Who are off
protocol therapy.
"ONYX's strategy is based on the
way oncologists appear to think,"
says Fagan. "In addition to making
suggestions about drug therapy, we
would also like ONYX to predict
what is going to happen to a patient in
the future, based on what ONYX
knows."
Both ONCOCIN and ONYX use
heuristics — problem-solving meth
ods commonly called "rules of
thumb." There is no guarantee that
an heuristic is correct, but it is a good
guess.
Chess players, for example, do not
know the best sequence of moves, be
cause they don't consider every possi
ble sequence. There are simply too
many permutations to analyze.
Instead, they use rules of thumb for
guidance. For example, they may try
to control the center of the board, or
they may check their opponent's
king, whenever possible.
A player using these rules does not
always make the best possible move.
But heuristics help players to make
decisions and cope with uncertainty.
In some ways, playing chess is like
making medical decisions. Some deci
sions are clouded with uncertainty,
and physicians must rely on an appro
priate method of reasoning. They of
ten turn to heuristics.
Medical heuristics are represented
in ONCOCIN and ONYX as if-then
statements. The computer can under
stand them in this form.
"ONCOCIN uses heuristics," says
Fagan, "but because ONCOCIN fol
lows a specific protocol, most of its
knowledge consists of specific facts.
There is little uncertainty.
"In ONYX, we are using more
rules of thumb, because there are no
protocol guidelines to follow. There
are no guaranteed strategies. There
are no right answers necessarily, since
ONYX deals with patients when
protocol rules no longer apply.
"Using heuristics is a kind of ball
park approach. Computer programs

weigh these guesses to come up with
an answer. That's what ONYX does.
ONCOCIN, on the other hand,
doesn't try to guess. It integrates
mostly factual information to come
up with answers," says Fagan.
What is the ultimate goal of this re
search? Someday, Fagan would like
to see the invention of an "intelligent
textbook."
Today, physicians must skim
through the pages of an entire medi
cal textbook, even when they want
only specific information on a pa
tient's condition. Someday, a
physican may simply describe a pa
tient's situation to a computer, and

the computer will supply specific and
thorough information regarding the
patient's case.
"To achieve this goal, researchers
in artificial intelligence are trying to
develop better ways of entering and
representing knowledge in the com
puter," says Fagan. "For example,
how does one represent common
sense knowledge in the computer?
Programs like ONCOCIN need com
mon sense. Ideally, the computer
should know if a calculated answer is
reasonable.
"Artificial intelligence is getting
better and better at knowledge entry

and representation, but there is still a
lot of work ahead of us. Computer
programs are nowhere near the point
where they can read a book, scan the
text and pick out relevant informa
tion. Also, researchers continue to
work on ways of representing knowl
edge in the computer so that it is
more accessible and usable to
people," Fagan says.
The development of an intelligent
textbook is years away. Nevertheless,
projects like ONCOCIN help people
make decisions today.
This research also helps experts,
like physicians, in a way that few an
ticipated. In order for programs like

ONCOCIN to be developed, experts
must supply their knowledge for inte
gration into the program; this forces
people to articulate their understand
ing of the field.
"Computers are not flexible
enough to work like people's minds
seem to work," says Fagan.
"Consequently, it forces people to or
ganize their thinking.
"Experts that go through this
debriefing process often tell us that
they are never the same, because they
were forced to write down how they
reason, step by step. In the process,
some of them made important dis
coveries in their fields of study."

Researchers at the Stanford Medi
cal Center have developed an artifi
cial intelligence computer program,
called ONCOCIN, to assist
physicians in treating cancer patients.
Although ONCOCIN is still exper
imental, physicians can consult it re
garding therapies for Hodgkin's
disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas,
breast cancer and one type of lung
cancer.
ONCOCIN operates like a human
consultant. First, it requests patient
information from the physician. The
physician answers by typing on a spe
cialized key pad.
When it has enough information,
ONCOCIN uses artificial intelligence
techniques to understand the pa
tient's situation. By weighing facts
and applying its information about
medicine, ONCOCIN makes recom
mendations on the patient's chemo
therapy plan.
Physicians use many drugs — most
of which are toxic — to kill the can
cerous cells that have multiplied in a
patient's body. Patients usually
receive these drugs in cycles over the
course of months. Radiation therapy
may also be part of the treatment
jegimen.
"The ideal therapy for most can
cers is not yet known," says Edward
Shortliffe, associate professor of
medicine and computer science and a
principle investigator of the ON
COCIN project. "To improve
therapy strategies, formal experi
ments, call protocols, are conducted
to compare therapeutic benefits and
side effects of accepted treatments
with»those of alternate therapies
believed to be of equal or greater
value."
Cancer therapy planning is compli
cated. Oncologists describe each
protocol in a lengthy written docu
ment that is usually from 50 to 60
pages. These documents contain
details on drug dosages, treatment
schedules, therapy adjustments and
laboratory tests needed to evaluate
drug effectiveness and toxicity.
Each documents includes many
treatment guidelines. At the medical
center, an oncologist may have to re
member the finer points of more than
50 different protocols.
ONCOCIN is designed to help on
cologists with these details. It
monitors the course of a patient's
treatment, specifies required labora-

For example, certain drugs used in
chemotherapy will kill white blood
cells, which play an important role in
combating infection. If a patient's
white blood cell count drops con
siderably, the patient's oncologist
must modify the chemotherapy plan.

decrease the dosage of certain drugs,
remove one or more drugs from the
therapy or postpone therapy altoget

The first version of ONCOCIN run
on a large timesharing computer sys
tem. Timesharing means that many
people use the computer system at
the same time. As a result, computer
response was slow, and oncologists
using ONCOCIN sometimes had to
wait for answers. In a busy clinic, this
presented a problem.
The ONCOCIN group is now
transferring programs from the old
system to newer and smaller com
puters that offer quick responses and
high resolution graphics. Because the
new system is not based on timeshar
ing, it will operate through indepen
dent work stations that are more ac
cessible and flexible.
Also, the new system can be moved
to other locations, unlike the old ver
sion. Ultimately, the ONCOCIN
group wants to implement the system
outside of Stanford, allowing more
clinics to participate in cancer
protocol therapy.
One of the problems facing the
ONCOCIN project, and all artificial
intelligence research, is improving the
process of entering data into the com
puter. Ideally, ONCOCIN would
work most efficiently if physicians
could enter knowledge directly into
the computer. Today, however,
programmers are required to
translate the physician's knowledge
into a language the computer under
stands.
To improve knowledge acquisition,


(Curtesy News and Publications
the ONCOCIN group is working on a
program called OPAL. It allows
physicians, by completing forms dis
played on the computer screen, to en
ter new protocol knowledge directly
into the computer. These forms put
knowledge in a format that is under
standable by both the physician and
the computer.
The ONCOCIN group is also
working to improve ONCOCIN's
ability to deal with uncertainty.
Today, ONCOCIN can only deal with
patient situations that are described
in a protocol document. These docu
ments, however, do not address every
circumstance that may arise in a pa
tient's therapy program. Otherwise,
the document would be many pages
more than 50.
When ONCOCIN runs into an un
usual situation, one that is not ad
dressed in the protocol document, it
cannot make a recommendation. Its
response is "I don't know. I don't
have enough information."
These special cases are referred to
an oncologist who is experienced in
designing protocol therapy, usually
the one who wrote the particular
document.
"ONCOCIN has problems with
patients that have been off protocol
treatment for three to four weeks,"
says Fagan. "At that point, the
clinician tries to straighten out the sit
uation.
"If a patient is off therapy, he
knows that the tumor has probably
grown. He may order an X-ray, to
check. If a patient's white blood cell
count is down, he knows the patient
is probably reacting poorly to the
chemotherapy. He might omit one of
the drugs from the treatment
regimen."
ONCOCIN currently cannot rea
son at this level. Its knowledge of
medicine is still superficial. ON
COCIN does not know the
physiologic effect of chemother
apeutic drugs on white blood cells.
It does not know that a decrease in
white blood cells will compromise a
patient's ability to fight off infection.
All it knows is to recommend an ac
tion when the white blood cell count
drops below a certain level.
"Much of medicine," says
Shortliffe, "is based on the ability to
deal with exceptions, to be creative in
understanding how underlying mech
anisms of biochemistry and patho
physiology account for the nuances of

patient problems."
The ONCOCIN group is working
to increase the system's reasoning
ability in a program called ONYX.
ONYX is still in its early stages of de
velopment, but its goals are clear.
The ONCOCIN group is trying to
model the way physicians appear to
reason in clinical settings. They are
providing the computer with knowl
edge on the human body, cancer and
the drugs used in treating cancer.
They hope the computer will make
sense of this knowledge and use it to
make reasonable recommendations
on cancer patients Who are off
protocol therapy.
"ONYX's strategy is based on the
way oncologists appear to think,"
says Fagan. "In addition to making
suggestions about drug therapy, we
would also like ONYX to predict
what is going to happen to a patient in
the future, based on what ONYX
knows."
Both ONCOCIN and ONYX use
heuristics — problem-solving meth
ods commonly called "rules of
thumb." There is no guarantee that
an heuristic is correct, but it is a good
guess.
Chess players, for example, do not
know the best sequence of moves, be
cause they don't consider every possi
ble sequence. There are simply too
many permutations to analyze.
Instead, they use rules of thumb for
guidance. For example, they may try
to control the center of the board, or
they may check their opponent's
king, whenever possible.
A player using these rules does not
always make the best possible move.
But heuristics help players to make
decisions and cope with uncertainty.
In some ways, playing chess is like
making medical decisions. Some deci
sions are clouded with uncertainty,
and physicians must rely on an appro
priate method of reasoning. They of
ten turn to heuristics.
Medical heuristics are represented
in ONCOCIN and ONYX as if-then
statements. The computer can under
stand them in this form.
"ONCOCIN uses heuristics," says
Fagan, "but because ONCOCIN fol
lows a specific protocol, most of its
knowledge consists of specific facts.
There is little uncertainty.
"In ONYX, we are using more
rules of thumb, because there are no
protocol guidelines to follow. There
are no guaranteed strategies. There
are no right answers necessarily, since
ONYX deals with patients when
protocol rules no longer apply.
"Using heuristics is a kind of ball
park approach. Computer programs

weigh these guesses to come up with
an answer. That's what ONYX does.
ONCOCIN, on the other hand,
doesn't try to guess. It integrates
mostly factual information to come
up with answers," says Fagan.
What is the ultimate goal of this re
search? Someday, Fagan would like
to see the invention of an "intelligent
textbook."
Today, physicians must skim
through the pages of an entire medi
cal textbook, even when they want
only specific information on a pa
tient's condition. Someday, a
physican may simply describe a pa
tient's situation to a computer, and

the computer will supply specific and
thorough information regarding the
patient's case.
"To achieve this goal, researchers
in artificial intelligence are trying to
develop better ways of entering and
representing knowledge in the com
puter," says Fagan. "For example,
how does one represent common
sense knowledge in the computer?
Programs like ONCOCIN need com
mon sense. Ideally, the computer
should know if a calculated answer is
reasonable.
"Artificial intelligence is getting
better and better at knowledge entry

and representation, but there is still a
lot of work ahead of us. Computer
programs are nowhere near the point
where they can read a book, scan the
text and pick out relevant informa
tion. Also, researchers continue to
work on ways of representing knowl
edge in the computer so that it is
more accessible and usable to
people," Fagan says.
The development of an intelligent
textbook is years away. Nevertheless,
projects like ONCOCIN help people
make decisions today.
This research also helps experts,
like physicians, in a way that few an
ticipated. In order for programs like

ONCOCIN to be developed, experts
must supply their knowledge for inte
gration into the program; this forces
people to articulate their understand
ing of the field.
"Computers are not flexible
enough to work like people's minds
seem to work," says Fagan.
"Consequently, it forces people to or
ganize their thinking.
"Experts that go through this
debriefing process often tell us that
they are never the same, because they
were forced to write down how they
reason, step by step. In the process,
some of them made important dis
coveries in their fields of study."

Researchers at the Stanford Medi
cal Center have developed an artifi
cial intelligence computer program,
called ONCOCIN, to assist
physicians in treating cancer patients.
Although ONCOCIN is still exper
imental, physicians can consult it re
garding therapies for Hodgkin's
disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas,
breast cancer and one type of lung
cancer.
ONCOCIN operates like a human
consultant. First, it requests patient
information from the physician. The
physician answers by typing on a spe
cialized key pad.
When it has enough information,
ONCOCIN uses artificial intelligence
techniques to understand the pa
tient's situation. By weighing facts
and applying its information about
medicine, ONCOCIN makes recom
mendations on the patient's chemo
therapy plan.
Physicians use many drugs — most
of which are toxic — to kill the can
cerous cells that have multiplied in a
patient's body. Patients usually
receive these drugs in cycles over the
course of months. Radiation therapy
may also be part of the treatment
jegimen.
"The ideal therapy for most can
cers is not yet known," says Edward
Shortliffe, associate professor of
medicine and computer science and a
principle investigator of the ON
COCIN project. "To improve
therapy strategies, formal experi
ments, call protocols, are conducted
to compare therapeutic benefits and
side effects of accepted treatments
with»those of alternate therapies
believed to be of equal or greater
value."
Cancer therapy planning is compli
cated. Oncologists describe each
protocol in a lengthy written docu
ment that is usually from 50 to 60
pages. These documents contain
details on drug dosages, treatment
schedules, therapy adjustments and
laboratory tests needed to evaluate
drug effectiveness and toxicity.
Each documents includes many
treatment guidelines. At the medical
center, an oncologist may have to re
member the finer points of more than
50 different protocols.
ONCOCIN is designed to help on
cologists with these details. It
monitors the course of a patient's
treatment, specifies required labora-

tory tests and recommends therapy
changes when appropriate.
For example, certain drugs used in
chemotherapy will kill white blood
cells, which play an important role in
combating infection. If a patient's
white blood cell count drops con
siderably, the patient's oncologist
must modify the chemotherapy plan.
The oncologist may decide to
decrease the dosage of certain drugs,
remove one or more drugs from the
therapy or postpone therapy altoget
her.
The protocol document spells out
guidelines for these revisions. ON
COCIN knows these guidelines and
can make recommendations to the
oncologist. At that point, the on
cologist can follow the recommenda

tion or override ONCOCIN's advice.
Like a human consultant, ON
COCIN explains its recommen
dations. "Explanation is a key ele
ment of this project," says Christop
her Lane, the project's systems
programmer., "ONCOCIN is de
signed to build up explanations as it
goes along. So when a doctor wants to
know how it came up with a certain
conclusion, the computer can explain
the details."
Shortliffe and Charlotte Jacobs, as
sistant professor of medicine and an
other principle investigator of ON
COCIN, started the project by gath
ering information from treatment
protocols used in Hodgkin's disease
and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. This
information was translated into "if

then" rules, employing a logic that
computers readily understand.
ONCOCIN's knowledge and
reasoning capacity is represented in
the program by a series of these if
then rules. The "if' part of the rule
considers the patient's situation; the
"then" part dictates a specific course
of action.
An example of an if-then rule is the
following: If a patient's white blood
cell count drops below a given value,
then reduce the dosage of drug A by
30 percent.
"There can be several hundred of
these if-then rules in one protocol
document," says David Combs, an
applications programmer on the proj
ect. "When ONCOCIN has enough
information, it tries to fiqure out

which rules apply, then it carries out
those rules in the form of a therapy
recommendation."
When only a few rules apply, treat
ing a patient is straightforward.
Treatment becomes complicated,
however, when many of these if-then
rules apply to a particular situation.
"ONCOCIN may appear to be
very literal," says Larry Fagan, the
project director. "However, it is im
portant to remember that we don't
tell the computer what to recommend
for every conceivable situation.
"Instead, we supply it with infor
mation and instructions on how to put
bits of information together. The
computer then integrates incoming
information on its own," Fagan con
tinues.

"ONCOCIN is literal in the sense
that we supply the facts, hut we never
quite know how they will fit together.
When these programs get large, the
information sometimes fits together
in ways we never expected," Fagan
says.
How is ONCOCIN performing?
Physicians in the oncology clinic have
supported ONCOCIN since they
began using it in May 1981.
Also, formal studies have been per
formed to compare ONCOCIN's
decisions with those of real on
cologists. "We have looked at the
quality of advice offered by the com
puter relative to the opinions of ex
perts who care for lymphoma
patients," says She: tliffe. "That study
shows excellent performance of the
computer relative to the experts."

white blood cells will compromise a
patient's ability to fight off infection.
All it knows is to recommend an ac
tion when the white blood cell count
drops below a certain level.
"Much of medicine," says
Shortliffe, "is based on the ability to
deal with exceptions, to be creative in
understanding how underlying mech
anisms of biochemistry and patho
physiology account for the nuances of

patient problems."
The ONCOCIN group is working
to increase the system's reasoning
ability in a program called ONYX.
ONYX is still in its early stages of de
velopment, but its goals are clear.
The ONCOCIN group is trying to
model the way physicians appear to
reason in clinical settings. They are
providing the computer with knowl
edge on the human body, cancer and
the drugs used in treating cancer.
They hope the computer will make
sense of this knowledge and use it to
make reasonable recommendations
on cancer patients Who are off
protocol therapy.
"ONYX's strategy is based on the
way oncologists appear to think,"
says Fagan. "In addition to making
suggestions about drug therapy, we
would also like ONYX to predict
what is going to happen to a patient in
the future, based on what ONYX
knows."
Both ONCOCIN and ONYX use
heuristics — problem-solving meth
ods commonly called "rules of
thumb." There is no guarantee that
an heuristic is correct, but it is a good
guess.
Chess players, for example, do not
know the best sequence of moves, be
cause they don't consider every possi
ble sequence. There are simply too
many permutations to analyze.
Instead, they use rules of thumb for
guidance. For example, they may try
to control the center of the board, or
they may check their opponent's
king, whenever possible.
A player using these rules does not
always make the best possible move.
But heuristics help players to make
decisions and cope with uncertainty.
In some ways, playing chess is like
making medical decisions. Some deci
sions are clouded with uncertainty,
and physicians must rely on an appro
priate method of reasoning. They of
ten turn to heuristics.
Medical heuristics are represented
in ONCOCIN and ONYX as if-then
statements. The computer can under
stand them in this form.
"ONCOCIN uses heuristics," says
Fagan, "but because ONCOCIN fol
lows a specific protocol, most of its
knowledge consists of specific facts.
There is little uncertainty.
"In ONYX, we are using more
rules of thumb, because there are no
protocol guidelines to follow. There
are no guaranteed strategies. There
are no right answers necessarily, since
ONYX deals with patients when
protocol rules no longer apply.
"Using heuristics is a kind of ball
park approach. Computer programs

weigh these guesses to come up with
an answer. That's what ONYX does.
ONCOCIN, on the other hand,
doesn't try to guess. It integrates
mostly factual information to come
up with answers," says Fagan.
What is the ultimate goal of this re
search? Someday, Fagan would like
to see the invention of an "intelligent
textbook."
Today, physicians must skim
through the pages of an entire medi
cal textbook, even when they want
only specific information on a pa
tient's condition. Someday, a
physican may simply describe a pa
tient's situation to a computer, and

the computer will supply specific and
thorough information regarding the
patient's case.
"To achieve this goal, researchers
in artificial intelligence are trying to
develop better ways of entering and
representing knowledge in the com
puter," says Fagan. "For example,
how does one represent common
sense knowledge in the computer?
Programs like ONCOCIN need com
mon sense. Ideally, the computer
should know if a calculated answer is
reasonable.
"Artificial intelligence is getting
better and better at knowledge entry

and representation, but there is still a
lot of work ahead of us. Computer
programs are nowhere near the point
where they can read a book, scan the
text and pick out relevant informa
tion. Also, researchers continue to
work on ways of representing knowl
edge in the computer so that it is
more accessible and usable to
people," Fagan says.
The development of an intelligent
textbook is years away. Nevertheless,
projects like ONCOCIN help people
make decisions today.
This research also helps experts,
like physicians, in a way that few an
ticipated. In order for programs like

ONCOCIN to be developed, experts
must supply their knowledge for inte
gration into the program; this forces
people to articulate their understand
ing of the field.
"Computers are not flexible
enough to work like people's minds
seem to work," says Fagan.
"Consequently, it forces people to or
ganize their thinking.
"Experts that go through this
debriefing process often tell us that
they are never the same, because they
were forced to write down how they
reason, step by step. In the process,
some of them made important dis
coveries in their fields of study."
