## Computer helps doctors treat cancer patients 
### ERIC ENDO 
Researchers at the Stanford Medi
cal Center have developed an artifi
cial intelligence computer program,
called ONCOCIN, to assist
physicians in treating cancer patients.
Although ONCOCIN is still exper
imental, physicians can consult it re
garding therapies for Hodgkin's
disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas,
breast cancer and one type of lung
cancer.
ONCOCIN operates like a human
consultant. First, it requests patient
information from the physician. The
physician answers by typing on a spe
cialized key pad.
When it has enough information,
ONCOCIN uses artificial intelligence
techniques to understand the pa
tient's situation. By weighing facts
and applying its information about
medicine, ONCOCIN makes recom
mendations on the patient's chemo
therapy plan.
Physicians use many drugs — most
of which are toxic — to kill the can
cerous cells that have multiplied in a
patient's body. Patients usually
receive these drugs in cycles over the
course of months. Radiation therapy
may also be part of the treatment
jegimen.
"The ideal therapy for most can
cers is not yet known," says Edward
Shortliffe, associate professor of
medicine and computer science and a
principle investigator of the ON
COCIN project. "To improve
therapy strategies, formal experi
ments, call protocols, are conducted
to compare therapeutic benefits and
side effects of accepted treatments
with»those of alternate therapies
believed to be of equal or greater
value."
Cancer therapy planning is compli
cated. Oncologists describe each
protocol in a lengthy written docu
ment that is usually from 50 to 60
pages. These documents contain
details on drug dosages, treatment
schedules, therapy adjustments and
laboratory tests needed to evaluate
drug effectiveness and toxicity.
Each documents includes many
treatment guidelines. At the medical
center, an oncologist may have to re
member the finer points of more than
50 different protocols.
ONCOCIN is designed to help on
cologists with these details. It
monitors the course of a patient's
treatment, specifies required labora-

tory tests and recommends therapy
changes when appropriate.
For example, certain drugs used in
chemotherapy will kill white blood
cells, which play an important role in
combating infection. If a patient's
white blood cell count drops con
siderably, the patient's oncologist
must modify the chemotherapy plan.
The oncologist may decide to
decrease the dosage of certain drugs,
remove one or more drugs from the
therapy or postpone therapy altoget
her.
The protocol document spells out
guidelines for these revisions. ON
COCIN knows these guidelines and
can make recommendations to the
oncologist. At that point, the on
cologist can follow the recommenda

tion or override ONCOCIN's advice.
Like a human consultant, ON
COCIN explains its recommen
dations. "Explanation is a key ele
ment of this project," says Christop
her Lane, the project's systems
programmer., "ONCOCIN is de
signed to build up explanations as it
goes along. So when a doctor wants to
know how it came up with a certain
conclusion, the computer can explain
the details."
Shortliffe and Charlotte Jacobs, as
sistant professor of medicine and an
other principle investigator of ON
COCIN, started the project by gath
ering information from treatment
protocols used in Hodgkin's disease
and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. This
information was translated into "if

then" rules, employing a logic that
computers readily understand.
ONCOCIN's knowledge and
reasoning capacity is represented in
the program by a series of these if
then rules. The "if' part of the rule
considers the patient's situation; the
"then" part dictates a specific course
of action.
An example of an if-then rule is the
following: If a patient's white blood
cell count drops below a given value,
then reduce the dosage of drug A by
30 percent.
"There can be several hundred of
these if-then rules in one protocol
document," says David Combs, an
applications programmer on the proj
ect. "When ONCOCIN has enough
information, it tries to fiqure out

which rules apply, then it carries out
those rules in the form of a therapy
recommendation."
When only a few rules apply, treat
ing a patient is straightforward.
Treatment becomes complicated,
however, when many of these if-then
rules apply to a particular situation.
"ONCOCIN may appear to be
very literal," says Larry Fagan, the
project director. "However, it is im
portant to remember that we don't
tell the computer what to recommend
for every conceivable situation.
"Instead, we supply it with infor
mation and instructions on how to put
bits of information together. The
computer then integrates incoming
information on its own," Fagan con
tinues.

"ONCOCIN is literal in the sense
that we supply the facts, hut we never
quite know how they will fit together.
When these programs get large, the
information sometimes fits together
in ways we never expected," Fagan
says.
How is ONCOCIN performing?
Physicians in the oncology clinic have
supported ONCOCIN since they
began using it in May 1981.
Also, formal studies have been per
formed to compare ONCOCIN's
decisions with those of real on
cologists. "We have looked at the
quality of advice offered by the com
puter relative to the opinions of ex
perts who care for lymphoma
patients," says She: tliffe. "That study
shows excellent performance of the
computer relative to the experts."
ONCOCIN is doing well, but mem
bers on the project continue to in
crease its sophistication.
The first version of ONCOCIN run
on a large timesharing computer sys
tem. Timesharing means that many
people use the computer system at
the same time. As a result, computer
response was slow, and oncologists
using ONCOCIN sometimes had to
wait for answers. In a busy clinic, this
presented a problem.
The ONCOCIN group is now
transferring programs from the old
system to newer and smaller com
puters that offer quick responses and
high resolution graphics. Because the
new system is not based on timeshar
ing, it will operate through indepen
dent work stations that are more ac
cessible and flexible.
Also, the new system can be moved
to other locations, unlike the old ver
sion. Ultimately, the ONCOCIN
group wants to implement the system
outside of Stanford, allowing more
clinics to participate in cancer
protocol therapy.
One of the problems facing the
ONCOCIN project, and all artificial
intelligence research, is improving the
process of entering data into the com
puter. Ideally, ONCOCIN would
work most efficiently if physicians
could enter knowledge directly into
the computer. Today, however,
programmers are required to
translate the physician's knowledge
into a language the computer under
stands.
