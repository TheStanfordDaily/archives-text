## The
						Stanford Daily Students biting back 
### 
Children often learn the hard way that if they
taunt an animal enough, the animal will retaliate
with a painful bite.
Much in the same way, University President
Donald Kennedy's abusive treatment of the latest
divestment proposal has caused frustration
among students, and yesterday some students bit
back. Nine students vented their frustration by
sitting in at the Bursar's Office in Old Union yes
terday until they were arrested.
Whether you agree with the students' action is
not important. Recognizing their frustration is.
As they put it, they disobeyed the law, in part,
"because the recent student-initiated proposal
for a change in the [Commission on Investment
Responsibility] has been split, protecting the
trustees from dealing with a controversial issue
head-on."
Kennedy has made a mockery of the latest pro
posal by splitting it in parts, deferring part of it to
a Board of Trustees committee and putting only
the least controversial part (calling for a group of

staff members to investigate companies) on the
agenda of the trustees' next meeting.
At its outset, the proposal appeared a viable
way of resolving the huge difference between the
demands of Stanford Out of South Africa and the
desires of the administration. The proposal calls
for total divestment while incorporating a two
year time frame suggested by Kennedy.
But Kennedy has chosen to sidestep this at
tempt at compromise. In doing so, he is frustrat
ing the students who are trying to accomplish
something positive and morally correct. As Mark
Landesmann, a member of C-IR and a co-author
of the proposal, said, "I don't understand how
they can split the proposal. ... It doesn't make a
lot of sense. I'm happy they're going to act on it,
but it's dubious the way they're doing it."
By frustrating the students, Kennedy is only
forcing them farther away from the administra
tion and lessening the possibility of a constructive
resolution. He is forcing students into civil dis
obedience by giving them no alternative.
