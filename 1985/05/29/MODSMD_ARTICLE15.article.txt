# SOSA leaders alienated students
## 
### 
The mini-movement by some students against
apartheid is no longer among the living. Whether it
is dead or simply in a deep coma is uncertain, but in
either case, resuscitation is unlikely. It is instructive
to ponder why the movement was so short-lived
and why it failed so miserably to gain and keep hold
of broad-based student support.
One can be certain that the leadership of Stan
ford Out of South Africa was ill-equipped to carry
out a successful movement. Some persist that even
if the group had had savvy leaders in touch with the
majority of students, the protests would have
fizzled. This may be true. But since most students
were never included, we can never be sure.
The leaders of SOSA were simply too radical.
But in the first days of the protests, this condition
was not a preventive factor for student participa
tion. The movement was new, and students were

unfamiliar with SOSA leaders. Students were pro
testing apartheid as individuals. The thought of
being led by a few self-important activists never
crossed their minds.
But SOSA and its leadership did not allow them
to demonstrate as individuals for long. Stanford
Out of South Africa emerged as the sole organiza
tion of the movement. Students could no longer
voice protest without implicitly identifying them
selves with SOSA and the emotionalism, ex
tremism, intolerance and dearth of rational thought
the group was coming to represent.
Within a week, the protest against apartheid had
become a "Struggle Against Oppression." By "day
seven," SOSA leaders were trying to heap a host of
other issues onto the imaginary coattails of the in
fant movement. There were speeches on the black
movement of the "60s, on "Simpson-Mazzoli IDs
vs. South African passbooks," on "Indian reserva

tions vs. the Bantustans," and on the labor union
struggle.
What happened to the overwhelming majority of
students who just wanted to devote some time and
energy to fight a South African system that they
found appalling? SOSA leaders effectively
alienated them, their only prospective source of
broad-based support.
When SOSA started calling a corner of the Ouad
"Mandela Free University," students didn't say,
"I'm with you all the way" and break into cheers of
"Rah Rah Mandela Free." They said "What in the
hell are those cretins doing, and why don't they
take their sleazy sleeping bags and mattresses home

with them?" When they lay down in front of a
Hoover Institution secretary's car as she tried to
leave work, students didn't praise them for their
selflessness or boundless dedication to the cause.
They asked themselves if these infants really went
to Stanford University.
Although most were aware that SOSA leaders
were radical, I don't think most realize how truly
radical they were. Here's a statement by SOSA
leader Steve Phillips given in an interview with a
tabloid called "Unity": "Some of the people who
have played roles in organizing SOSA have been
folks who've worked with Unity and take a
Marxist-Leninist perspective. .. . It's really excit-

ing to see the principles of Marxism-Leninism
being successful and making a difference" (Unity,
May 3-23, 1985).
Unity is a newspaper published by "the U.S.
League of Revolutionary Struggle (Marxist-
Leninist)" whose slogan reads "for Peace, Justice,
Equality and Socialism." Did students want to join
a Marxist-Leninist struggle? To describe SOSA
leaders as out of touch with students seems an un
derstatement.
Deluded leaders like Phillips mistakenly saw a
massive student commitment that extended far
beyond a willingness to work to eliminate apart
heid. Phillips said in the same interview with Unity:

When SOSA started calling a corner of the Quad
'Mandela Free University,' students didn't say, 'I'm
with you all the way' and break into cheers of' Rah
Rah Mandela Free.' They said, 'What in the hell
are those cretins doing, and why don't they take
their sleazy sleeping bags and mattresses home with
them?'

. . People are really learning a whole lot about
what this University really stands for, what role it
plays in society, the fact that the corporations can
not function and make a profit without exploiting
people. This commitment is far beyond total divest
ment." Had Phillips and his cohorts peered out of
their ivory tower for even an instant, they may have
seen the gross error in their assumptions. But per
haps they wouldn't have. From that high up in the
clouds, it's awfully difficult to see down to the
ground.
