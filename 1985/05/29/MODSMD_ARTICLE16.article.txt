Divest now
The editorial praising recent at
tempts at "pragmatic" compromise
on the issue of South Africa (The
Daily, May 21) shows a fundamental
misunderstanding of the anti
apartheid movement. The point is
neither to "rant and rave," nor to
reform University policy with the
veneer of a new version of the white
man's burden. The movement is
rather one of solidarity with the
struggle of an African people fight
ing for its freedom. We follow black
South Africans in raising the
decades-old demand for divestment.
Even if the trustees never budge,
total divestment serves well as the
slogan to rally and expand our move
ment. We are gaining valuable politi
cal experience.
Far from being politically naive,
we are in fact quite beyond those
who seek to mislead us with prom
ises of "reforms'" that take forever.
The ultimate goal is black majority
rule in South Africa. Any real
concessions won from those in power
will become tools in the struggle. But
even full divestment by Stanford, the
University of California, etc.. is not
the end of it. We will not let the
trustees off the hook so easily.
Our movement has raised the
consciousness of many about condi
tions in South Africa and about who
supports the oppression of blacks.
Thus, as University President
Donald Kennedy has noted, the days
of his policy of investment are num
bered. Call a spade a spade. Ken
nedy's doublespeak calls it "selective
divestment," but we call an increase
from $125 million (1977) to $215
million (1985), including Motorola
Corp. when it admitted direct sales
to the military , illicit investment and
accessory to a crime against
humanity.
Kennedy's attempt to split morals
from action and "rational discourse"
from the test of expericncc is both

unscientific and immoral. No reform
or promise of greater effort can save
a policy that has proven itself bank
rupt. Shams like the Sullivan Prin
ciples are no help, either. There is no
enforcement, and even the paltry
review of "compliance" is in the
hands of racists like President
Reagan.
We will continue to educate and
agitate until blacks, and all others,
are free. There is nothing wrong with
expressing our anger at an immoral
policy. There is nothing naive about
continued political pressure and
impassioned rational debate. We will
continue whether it takes two weeks
or two years or more.
There will, however, be truly
"fundamental changes" far before
the century, alluded to by The Daily.
Winnie Mandela put it this way:
"The West and those countries that
have trade links with South Africa
are protracting our struggle. They
are prolonging our suffering. Al
though they know that they are
doing so, they also know that we will
take over this country." The com
promisers are concerned about
agitated students and workers, but
we are concerned about injustice and
the right to rebel against it.

Compromise now
In the article "Kennedy splits
latest proposal" (The Daily. May
23), senior Michael Schmitz com
ments on a proposal that has been
put forth by the student representa
tives on the Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility and on the
Trustee Committee on Investments
(Walter Geys, Margaret Miller,
Robert Schechter and myself).
First, he states that the proposal
does not "reflect" the demand for
total divestment. This is false. The
proposal provides for total divest
ment over the next two years of all

stocks in companies operating in
South Africa. (By January 1986, the
University would divest from all
companies that have not signed the
Sullivan Principles and that have not
adopted a policy of no sales and no
loans to the South African govern
ment. By June 1986, the University
would divest from all companies that
have signed but inadequately adhere
to the Sullivan Principles and that do
not actively oppose the South
African influx control laws. And, by
December 1987, the University
would divest from all other compan
ies operating in South Africa —
unless apartheid is dismantled by
that time.)
Second, he states that "the as
sumption of the proposal is the cor
porations can change the
government [and] that corporations
can play a positive role in South
Africa." This is false. The very first
sentence of the policy statement that
we ask the Board of Trustees to
adopt states: "Given the reprehen
sible nature of apartheid rule in
South Africa, any corporation oper
ating there is abetting in substantial
social injury."
Third, Schmitz states that the
proposal "just means that the Board
of Trustees will wait to vote in two
years." This is false. The proposal
asks the trustees to vote now and to
commit themselves now to a specific
timetable for divestment over the
next two years.
Let me reiterate that the authors
of the proposal do believe that the
trustees should divest now of all
holdings in companies operating in
South Africa and would make a
proposal to that effect, would it have
the slightest chance of passing at the
next trustee meeting.
However, given that the goal is to
help and support black South
Africans. I do not believe that it is
sensible to confine one's efforts to
reiterating a stance that bears moral
purity but has no impact on the

investment policy of our university
and on those that bear the brunt of
this policy. When your goal is to help
others, an all-or-nothing approach is
not always morally most righteous —
especially if the chances of getting
"all" are infinitely small at the pres
ent time and under the current cir
cumstances.
"Thousands of students" have not
yet expressed their opinion (one way
or the other) on whether the demand
for total divestment should be
coupled with a compromise-seeking
proposal, which specifies a concrete
timetable for such divestment over
the next two years. I sense, however,
that those who reject the quest for
compromise as a viable and impor
tant complement to protest and
confrontation are part of a dwindling
minority. Various statements of
support from some individuals within
SOSA and from the student body at '
large indicate that the time has come
to give the administration and the
trustees an opportunity to prove the
sincerity of previous verbal commit
ments by asking them for concrete
actions and substantive decisions.

End hypocrisy
Divest now. Let's have no more
hypocrisy. Smash those H-P cal
culators. Bust those Kodak cameras.
Throw all IBM typewriters out the
window. We'll show those racist
companies we mean business. We
won't use their products, we'll break
them. Divest now. Drive a GM car
off a cliff. Take a baseball bat to
your GE appliances. Torch your
Time, your Sports Illustrated and
your People. Use your sleeve and
show Kleenex who's boss. Divest
now!
