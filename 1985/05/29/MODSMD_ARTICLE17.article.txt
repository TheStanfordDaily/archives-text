## Draft tied to voting 
### 
The story never would have gotten
out if Selective Service had not
goofed and sent out notices to 1,500
oldsters and amputees. The Selective
Service got its lists mixed up. The
notices were supposed to go to 18-
year-olds who had registered to vote

VIEWPOINT

but had not registered for the draft.
We now know that the Selective Ser
vice systematically combs voter lists
for 18-year-olds wise enough to vote
but not wise enough to know that
voting is a giveaway.
Searching voter lists is a device
worthy of even the most devious ac
tions of the Nixon administration.
The rare act of registering at 18
implies some kind of trust and faith in
politics. It might even show some
knowledge and interest in the larger
world. A failure to register for the
draft, for someone aware enough to
register and vote, was probably not
an act of indifference or laziness.
Most likely, it reflects a commitment
that could, at times, go beyond the
politics of voting.
By combing the voter lists, the
Selective Service can spot, and maybe
discourage, a potentially "trouble
some" citizen. When found this
way, the subject is already "on
the books," with the very first entry
in his dossier.
A failure to register, if based on
conviction, is a powerful and elo
quent political statement. It is a per

sonal statement for which the
government forces one to give up
either privacy or the vote. If that is
the trade-off, and the commitment
not to register (vote or draft) is still
there, so be it. There is another way,
however, that a 17-year-old might
wish to consider.
The alternative makes a statement
that may not be as strong, but it is
clear and it could place one in a less
vulnerable legal position. There is no
box or blank for this on the registra
tion form. This does not stop a new
registrant from stating on the form,
and/or on an appended sheet, in cer
tain and definite terms, a conviction
never to be drafted. The form and
sheets can be taken and copied before
being turned in. Copies can be sent to
fathers, mothers, ministers and
friends, and filed for later. The earlier
the statement, the stronger the case
and a family lawyer, armed with this
packet of information, would have a
field day with the Selective Service,
the legal maze and the courts.
Seventeen-year-olds do not re
member the early days of the Viet
nam experience. A strong anti-draft
movement as well as legal cases and
courtroom battles marked the begin
ning of effective opposition to that
war. A conviction made now and a
statement filed now serves notice that
there will always be strong opposition
to foreign military adventures.
