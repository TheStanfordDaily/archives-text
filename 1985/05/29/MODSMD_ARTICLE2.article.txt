# Hoover changes suggested
## 
### JULIE RYAN Editorial staff 
Ihe Faculty Senate committee charged with
scrutinizing relations between the Hoover Institu
tion and the University released a report yesterday
calling for increased academic governance of
Hoover.
The committee unanimously concluded that the
preservation of the status quo is not a reasonable
path to follow and suggested nine alternative direc
tions. The committee also decided that separation
of Stanford and Hoover is not desirable.
University President Donald Kennedy said he
would have no comment until he has had a chance
to study the report and hear the Faculty Senate dis
cussion tomorrow.
In a written response to the report, Hoover
Director W. Glenn Campbell said, "While I com
mend the authors of the senate report for the gen
eral tone of their remarks, I believe that the Ward
group which was set up by President Kennedy made
a number of constructive suggestions and laid the
groundwork for a more harmonious Stanford-
Hoover relationship."
Campbell also said that changes in the Stanford-
Hoover relationship, such as those proposed by the
senate committee report, "are beyond my authority
to grant or to consider."
The seven-nycjnber Faculty Senate group, headed
bv Sociology"ProT. Sanford Dornbusch, was created
in response to criticism of the Ward Committee
report. The Ward Committee, chaired by Political
Science Prof. Robert Ward, issued a report in No
vember which said that strengthening ties between
the University and Hoover could lead to an im
proved social sciences program here. Critics ex
pressed concern over the academic costs of imple
menting the Ward recommendations.
Political Science Prof. John Manley, outspoken
critic of the Ward report and a leader in efforts to
examine Stanford-Hoover ties, was not satisfied
with the senate committee's report released yester
day.
"Hoover is a problem because it is a right-wing
think tank with an explicit political mission that
operates out of a major university," Manley said.
"The committee has chosen to follow Donald Ken
nedy's lead in obscuring this fact in favor of
'governance,' and thus has ignored the most central
question of all: Should a university house and sup
port the leading conservative — or liberal — think
tank in the country?"
Addressing the central question of ideology at
Hoover and its reputation as a "conservative think
tank," the senate committee's report states that the
committee "does not believe that Hoover's pride in
its political influence is de facto evidence of institu
tional partisanship. But at the same time, we would
agree that this pride has sometimes been so
blatantly expressed as to stimulate antagonism on
campus."
"Governance is the key to reduction of ideologi
cal concerns," the committee said. "The centralized
governance at Hoover encourages the belief that
the institution may be engaging in political ad
vocacy."
The committee called for the Hoover Institution
Board of Overseers and the Herbert Hoover Foun
dation to assume only an advisory role in the selec
tion of the institution's next director. Currently,
both the overseers, who are appointed by the Board
of Trustees, and the foundation must endorse a pro
posed new director before this person is recom
mended to the board by the University president.
