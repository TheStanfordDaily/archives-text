# Hoover changes suggested
## 
### JULIE RYAN Editorial staff 
Ihe Faculty Senate committee charged with
scrutinizing relations between the Hoover Institu
tion and the University released a report yesterday
calling for increased academic governance of
Hoover.
The committee unanimously concluded that the
preservation of the status quo is not a reasonable
path to follow and suggested nine alternative direc
tions. The committee also decided that separation
of Stanford and Hoover is not desirable.
University President Donald Kennedy said he
would have no comment until he has had a chance
to study the report and hear the Faculty Senate dis
cussion tomorrow.
In a written response to the report, Hoover
Director W. Glenn Campbell said, "While I com
mend the authors of the senate report for the gen
eral tone of their remarks, I believe that the Ward
group which was set up by President Kennedy made
a number of constructive suggestions and laid the
groundwork for a more harmonious Stanford-
Hoover relationship."
Campbell also said that changes in the Stanford-
Hoover relationship, such as those proposed by the
senate committee report, "are beyond my authority
to grant or to consider."
The seven-nycjnber Faculty Senate group, headed
bv Sociology"ProT. Sanford Dornbusch, was created
in response to criticism of the Ward Committee
report. The Ward Committee, chaired by Political
Science Prof. Robert Ward, issued a report in No
vember which said that strengthening ties between
the University and Hoover could lead to an im
proved social sciences program here. Critics ex
pressed concern over the academic costs of imple
menting the Ward recommendations.
Political Science Prof. John Manley, outspoken
critic of the Ward report and a leader in efforts to
examine Stanford-Hoover ties, was not satisfied
with the senate committee's report released yester
day.
"Hoover is a problem because it is a right-wing
think tank with an explicit political mission that
operates out of a major university," Manley said.
"The committee has chosen to follow Donald Ken
nedy's lead in obscuring this fact in favor of
'governance,' and thus has ignored the most central
question of all: Should a university house and sup
port the leading conservative — or liberal — think
tank in the country?"
Addressing the central question of ideology at
Hoover and its reputation as a "conservative think
tank," the senate committee's report states that the
committee "does not believe that Hoover's pride in
its political influence is de facto evidence of institu
tional partisanship. But at the same time, we would
agree that this pride has sometimes been so
blatantly expressed as to stimulate antagonism on
campus."
"Governance is the key to reduction of ideologi
cal concerns," the committee said. "The centralized
governance at Hoover encourages the belief that
the institution may be engaging in political ad
vocacy."
The committee called for the Hoover Institution
Board of Overseers and the Herbert Hoover Foun
dation to assume only an advisory role in the selec
tion of the institution's next director. Currently,
both the overseers, who are appointed by the Board
of Trustees, and the foundation must endorse a pro
posed new director before this person is recom
mended to the board by the University president.
The granting of such authority to a
peripheral agency may be "the most
objectionable single feature of the
Hoover Institution," the report said.
The committee also proposed that
appointments of senior scholais —
the committee's recommended name
for the current top rank of senior fel
low — be made subject to review by
the Advisory Board and provost prior
to submission to the president and
Board of Trustees. Those persons
reviewed favorably should be given
the rank of professor at the Hoover
Institution for research, accompanied
by Academic Council membership
and a continuing appointment, the
committee said.
"Creation of this rank would
facilitate all-University recognition
that academic criteria are used in se
lection of senior scholars," the report
said.
Dornbusch said he is uncertain
about what impact the report will
have. The senate will discuss the
report tomorrow and will probably

make the decision to accept it or not
at its meeting on June 6. If the senate
accepts the report, it will be sent to
various decision-making groups. "No
single person or group has the power
to fix things," Dornbusch said.
People who read the report will
"learn a lot," according to
Dornbusch. "But we are a committee
without power, therefore we just
have advice to give to everybody. We
don't expect necessarily that anyone
will follow our advice exactly," he
said.
In a series of "suggested directions
for change," the committee said, "We
do not expect the transition period to
be short or easy." It recommended
five steps for immediate considera
tion:
• "The University president should
appoint a formally constituted advi
sory committee to review any pro
posed appointment to senior fellows,
the highest rank at Hoover.
• "Hoover should redefine the ranks
of senior fellow, senior research fel
low and research fellow. It should
create a distinct category of senior
scholar as the topmost rank there.
• "The Academic Council should

review criteria for various kinds of
professorial association with depart
ments, schools and research centers
and appointments for members of the
Hoover Institution should be consis
-4
tent with these criteria.
• ' With advice from the director of
University Libraries and the Hoover
Institution director, the University
president should appoint a committee
to find ways of reducing barriers to
communication and cooperation be
tween the Hoover and Stanford Uni
versity libraries.
• "Make joint appointments between
Hoover and a school or department
only when the appointment a) serves
the long-term goal of both units, b)
stands on its own merits, unaffected
by conditions of reciprocity, and c)
results from a search that is a genuine
collaboration between the units.
A further proposal calls for in
creased communication and interac
tion between the Hoover Institution
and the rest of the University.
"Realistically, relations could
easily be much better," Dornbusch
said. "It will take action and good
will. That's up to the people involved,
not me."

Board of Overseers and the Herbert Hoover Foun
dation to assume only an advisory role in the selec
tion of the institution's next director. Currently,
both the overseers, who are appointed by the Board
of Trustees, and the foundation must endorse a pro
posed new director before this person is recom
mended to the board by the University president.
The granting of such authority to a
peripheral agency may be "the most
objectionable single feature of the
Hoover Institution," the report said.
The committee also proposed that
appointments of senior scholais —
the committee's recommended name
for the current top rank of senior fel
low — be made subject to review by
the Advisory Board and provost prior
to submission to the president and
Board of Trustees. Those persons
reviewed favorably should be given
the rank of professor at the Hoover
Institution for research, accompanied
by Academic Council membership
and a continuing appointment, the
committee said.
"Creation of this rank would
facilitate all-University recognition
that academic criteria are used in se
lection of senior scholars," the report
said.
Dornbusch said he is uncertain
about what impact the report will
have. The senate will discuss the
report tomorrow and will probably

make the decision to accept it or not
at its meeting on June 6. If the senate
accepts the report, it will be sent to
various decision-making groups. "No
single person or group has the power
to fix things," Dornbusch said.
People who read the report will
"learn a lot," according to
Dornbusch. "But we are a committee
without power, therefore we just
have advice to give to everybody. We
don't expect necessarily that anyone
will follow our advice exactly," he
said.
In a series of "suggested directions
for change," the committee said, "We
do not expect the transition period to
be short or easy." It recommended
five steps for immediate considera
tion:
• "The University president should
appoint a formally constituted advi
sory committee to review any pro
posed appointment to senior fellows,
the highest rank at Hoover.
• "Hoover should redefine the ranks
of senior fellow, senior research fel
low and research fellow. It should
create a distinct category of senior
scholar as the topmost rank there.
• "The Academic Council should

review criteria for various kinds of
professorial association with depart
ments, schools and research centers
and appointments for members of the
Hoover Institution should be consis
-4
tent with these criteria.
• ' With advice from the director of
University Libraries and the Hoover
Institution director, the University
president should appoint a committee
to find ways of reducing barriers to
communication and cooperation be
tween the Hoover and Stanford Uni
versity libraries.
• "Make joint appointments between
Hoover and a school or department
only when the appointment a) serves
the long-term goal of both units, b)
stands on its own merits, unaffected
by conditions of reciprocity, and c)
results from a search that is a genuine
collaboration between the units.
A further proposal calls for in
creased communication and interac
tion between the Hoover Institution
and the rest of the University.
"Realistically, relations could
easily be much better," Dornbusch
said. "It will take action and good
will. That's up to the people involved,
not me."
Ihe Faculty Senate committee charged with
scrutinizing relations between the Hoover Institu
tion and the University released a report yesterday
calling for increased academic governance of
Hoover.
The committee unanimously concluded that the
preservation of the status quo is not a reasonable
path to follow and suggested nine alternative direc
tions. The committee also decided that separation
of Stanford and Hoover is not desirable.
University President Donald Kennedy said he
would have no comment until he has had a chance
to study the report and hear the Faculty Senate dis
cussion tomorrow.
In a written response to the report, Hoover
Director W. Glenn Campbell said, "While I com
mend the authors of the senate report for the gen
eral tone of their remarks, I believe that the Ward
group which was set up by President Kennedy made
a number of constructive suggestions and laid the
groundwork for a more harmonious Stanford-
Hoover relationship."
Campbell also said that changes in the Stanford-
Hoover relationship, such as those proposed by the
senate committee report, "are beyond my authority
to grant or to consider."
The seven-nycjnber Faculty Senate group, headed
bv Sociology"ProT. Sanford Dornbusch, was created
in response to criticism of the Ward Committee
report. The Ward Committee, chaired by Political
Science Prof. Robert Ward, issued a report in No
vember which said that strengthening ties between
the University and Hoover could lead to an im
proved social sciences program here. Critics ex
pressed concern over the academic costs of imple
menting the Ward recommendations.
Political Science Prof. John Manley, outspoken
critic of the Ward report and a leader in efforts to
examine Stanford-Hoover ties, was not satisfied
with the senate committee's report released yester
day.
"Hoover is a problem because it is a right-wing
think tank with an explicit political mission that
operates out of a major university," Manley said.
"The committee has chosen to follow Donald Ken
nedy's lead in obscuring this fact in favor of
'governance,' and thus has ignored the most central
question of all: Should a university house and sup
port the leading conservative — or liberal — think
tank in the country?"
Addressing the central question of ideology at
Hoover and its reputation as a "conservative think
tank," the senate committee's report states that the
committee "does not believe that Hoover's pride in
its political influence is de facto evidence of institu
tional partisanship. But at the same time, we would
agree that this pride has sometimes been so
blatantly expressed as to stimulate antagonism on
campus."
"Governance is the key to reduction of ideologi
cal concerns," the committee said. "The centralized
governance at Hoover encourages the belief that
the institution may be engaging in political ad
vocacy."
