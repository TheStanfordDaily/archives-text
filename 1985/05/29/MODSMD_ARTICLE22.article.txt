## Card will face Miami at CWS 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
Miami (Fla.) rallied for four runs in
the bottom of the eighth inning yes
terday to defeat Florida, 12-9, and
advance to the College World Series.
Stanford will face the Hurricanes Sat
urday in the first round of the CWS.
The win gave Miami the champion
ship of the Atlantic Regional that it
hosted in Coral Gables, Fla.
Cardinal Coach Mark Marquess
hasn't worried about who Stanford's
opening opponent will be. "I didn't
really have a preference," he said. "If
there had been someone that I knew
something about, I might prefer to
play one or the other.
"I don't know much about Miami. 1
know they've been ranked in the top
four or five all season, so they must
have a pretty good team."
Stanford advanced to the Series

Monday with a 7-1 victory over Pep
perdine to win the West I Regional.
Miami's win last night was a return
to the style that Hurricane teams
have become noted for — letting the
other team score a lot of runs, then
scoring more than a lot.
After falling behind 9-5 in the top
of the seventh after a home run by the
Gators' Mike Stanley, Miami scored
three runs in the bottom of that
frame, including a homer by Chris
Hart, and went ahead with four in the
eighth.
That has not been the method the
Hurricanes have used for most of this
season. Miami has uncharacteristi
cally relied on pitching and defense to
carry it this far.
That fell apart last night. Hurricane
ace Dan Davies was chased during a
four-run Florida third inning, and the

Miami defense committed five errors
on the night.
Reliever Rick Raether, 5-2, came
on to record the victory. Raether has
been the stopper in the Miami bull
pen, saving 19 games. The sopho
more right-hander has a 1.57 ERA.
His 19 saves are one away from the
NCAA record.
Davies will likely start Saturday
against Stanford. The junior left
hander is 15-1 this season with a 2.68
ERA. He has won 14 in a row since
Florida beat him 11-2 back on Feb.
16.
The Hurricane offense has not
been as potent as in years past. Jon
Leake, the leading Miami hitter at
.352, is the only Hurricane batting
over .350.
Greg Ellena is the leading power
threat with only 11 homers, although
he has only 80 at-bats this season

since moving into the starting lineup
midway through the year.
Miami ran off a 24-game winning
streak earlier this season, going over
a month before losing to Maine, 3-2,
March 24. The Hurricanes finished
second at the Oklahoma Shootout,
losing to Oklahoma, but twice defeat
ing USC, the last-place team in the
Pacific 10 Southern Division, and
also beating Fullerton State.
The Stanford-Miami game is
scheduled for 2 p.m. PDT Saturday in
Omaha's Rosenblatt Stadium. The
winner will face the winner of Satur
day's Arizona-Texas game Tuesday
at 5 p.m., while the losers in the
double-elimination Series will meet
Sunday at 5 p.m.
The trip to Omaha is Stanford's
first since it won the West Regional in
1983. Stanford's best finish in the
CWS has been third place in 1968.
