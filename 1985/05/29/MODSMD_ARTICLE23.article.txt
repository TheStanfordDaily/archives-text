(AP) — Billy Cunningham, saying
it's time to move on to other things,
resigned yesterday as head coach of
the Philadelphia 76ers after eight
years of unparalleled success that in
cluded one National Basketball Asso
ciation championship.
Meanwhile, Kevin Loughery, who
guided the Chicago Bulls to their first
NBA playoff appearance in four
years, was fired along with Assistant
Coaches Bill Blair and Fred Carter.
"It's not a day for tears," Cunnin
gham, 41, told a news conference.

"l've been just a very fortunate per
son to be able to have coached a great
basketball team, and be involved in
the great sport of professional basket
ball. I leave it with a smile on my face,
not with my head down."
Cunningham, who led the 76ers to
the 1983 championship, reached 200,
300 and 400 victories faster than any
coach in NBA history. He said his
decision to leave had nothing to do
with losing in the playoff semifinals
last week to the Boston Celtics.
"I feel that it's time for Bill Cun

ningham to move on to other areas
with his life," he said, but added that
he had no immediate plans.
"Right now I'm just going to sit
back and evaluate the whole thing
and relax for awhile and see what di
rection I'm going to be going into. I
have no timetable."
Chicago General Manager Jerry
Krause said he made his decision to
fire Loughery this weekend after
meeting with Loughery and new Bulls
owner Jerry Reinsdorf. "Jerry agreed
with me that it was best for the long

range goals of the franchise," Krause
said.
Krause said he had not spoken with
anyone about assuming Loughery's
duties and said there was no deadline
to pick a new coach. He described his
differences with Loughery as
"philosophical ones," but declined to
comment further.
"It's not an easy thing. It's never an
easy thing in this situation to let
someone go," Krause said. "I hope I
never have to do this again."
