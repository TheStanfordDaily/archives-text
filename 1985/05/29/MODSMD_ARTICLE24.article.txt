## 
### GEOFF SANBORN Editorial staff 
The Stanford men's ultimate
Frisbee team came away from this
weekend's national championships
with the satisfaction of knowing it
had hosted a successful tourna
ment, but without the satisfaction
of its second straight national title.
The defending champion Card
inal was ousted in the
preliminaries of the 12-team
double-elimination tournament.
On Saturday, Stanford lost to
Massachusetts, 18-13, and the
next day was stopped by Pennsyl
vania, 18-14.
Massachusetts and Pennsylvania
wound up advancing to Monday's
championship match, which Penn
sylvania won, 21-15.
Cardinal Coach Tom Mcßann
was disappointed with his team's
early departure. "I really hoped to
do better," he said. "The teams
from the East were pretty tough,
but we should have done better.

"Still, it was a good learning ex
perience," he added. "I'm really
pleased with the spirit on the
team. We're learning to throw bet
ter, and we have a real positive at
titude."
Mcßann listed Sandy Koonce,
Peter Hecht and Tom Watson as
the Cardinal players who excelled
over the weekend.
This is the first year that Stan
ford has hosted the nationals, and
Mcßann said he heard partici
pants call it "one of the best ul
timate tournaments they'd been
at."
"We kept it a players' tourna
ment," Mcßann said. "We didn't
have a lot of publicity, and we had
a trainer there all three days,
which was unprecedented.
"The weather wasn't too great,"
he continued," but the East Coast
teams liked it. I think we have a
pretty good chance of getting the
Western regionals here next
year."
