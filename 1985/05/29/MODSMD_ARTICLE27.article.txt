Walt Harris' teammates maul him after what may have been the biggest
play of the series. Harris, a defensive back on the football team, had just
crashed into the Nebraska catcher, knocked the ball loose and scored the
winning run in Stanford's 9-8 victory.


All-Six-Pac center fielder Mark Davis slides under the tag of Nebraska's Larry Mims to arrive safely at second
base in Saturday's 9-8 heartstopper.


Believe it or not, third baseman Mark Machtolf caught this ball hit to him in Stanford's
17-3 humiliation of hapless Oregon State, the champions of the Pacific 10 Northern Divi
sion.


Second baseman Pete Stanicek nearly collides with first baseman
Rick Lundblade on a Nebraska pop fly.
