Trustees approve new biology building
The Board of Trustees May 15 granted concept ap
proval for a $25 million to $30 million Biological Sciences
building, the third component of the Herrin complex.
Recommended site for the 90,000 square foot facility is
in the area south of Herrin Laboratory and west of Herrin
Hall, bounded by that building, Serra Street, and the
existing parking lot.
The additional building is needed to relieve overcrowd
ing and accommodate anticipated growth. Designed for a
faculty population of 18, the two Herrin buildings now
house 24. "Dangerously overcrowded conditions are ap
parent throughout the buildings," trustees were told.
Looking ahead, the department anticipates nine faculty
retirements in the two-year period between 1990 and
1992. Biological Sciences says it must begin appointing
faculty who eventually will replace those they expect will
retire.
In addition, there are plans to expand the department
by eight faculty positions during the next decade.
"This major investment of resources is justified by the
expectation that the life sciences, along with computer sci
ence, will witness many of the greatest advances in basic
and applied knowledge during the next decades," trustees
were told.

Israel institute awards Karlin highest award
Prof. Samuel Karlin of the Department of Mathematics
has been awarded the Doctor of Science Honoris Causa,
the highest honor bestowed by the Technion, the Israel
Institute of Technology in Haifa.
In announcing the award. Prof. Josef Singer, president
of the Technion, cited Karlin s outstanding and produc
tive mathematical work encompassing applications to the
theory of biological population, genetics, economics, ap
proximation theory, probability and statistics, and game
theory.
Former recipients of the honorary degree are Albert
Einstein, Neils Bohr, James Franck, Theodore von Kar
man, Isidor Rabi, Harold Urey, David Ben-Gurion and
Eugene Wigner. Stanford Mathematics Prof. Emeritus
Menahem Schiffer is also a former recipient.
