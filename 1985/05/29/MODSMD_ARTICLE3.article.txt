### MARY YUH Editorial staff 
Nine students were arrested yester
day at Old Union after they staged a
sit-in to protest University invest
ments in companies that do business
in South Africa.
The seven men and two women
were charged with trespassing and
refusing to leave an unlawful assem
bly after they stayed in the Bursar's
Office past 5 p.m., according to Stan
ford Police Chief Marvin Herrington.
The students are also charged with
resisting arrest for refusing to identify
themselves, said Stanford Police
Capt. Marvin Moore. They have
identified themselves to the police
only as John Doe or Jane Doe, and
refer to each other by the numbers
one through nine.
Late last night, the protesters were
offered cite release: If they identified
themselves, they would immediately
be released and a court date would be
scheduled within approximately 30
days, according to one student ar
rested.
But the protesters again refused to
identify themselves to the police.
They are expected to be brought
before a judge today. According to an
arrested protester, the protesters' le
gal counsel told them that if they
refuse to give their names to the
judge, they may be charged with con
tempt of court.
As of late last night, the men were
at k holding facility in San Jose, nnd
the women were in a women's facility
at Elmwood Jail in Milpitas, accord
ing to police. The men may be trans
ferred to a men's facility in Elmwood
or may be kept in San Jose, police
said.
Five of the men and both women
began a hunger strike when they were
arrested, said one of the students ar
rested. The strike is a symbolic
gesture to illustrate the hunger in
South Africa that is a result of the op
pressive regime there, the strikers
said. The hunger strikers contend that
University investments support that
regime.

They intend to continue the strike
as long as they are jailed and possibly
longer, acoording to one of the
strikers.
In a press statement released
before the arrests, the students said,
"Since the trustees refuse to engage
in honest dialogue with us, our only
choice is to confront their anti
democratic power structure through
civil disobedience."
The students chose the Bursar's
Office because they see it as sym
bolizing the economic basis of the
University, and they are protesting
University investments which they
contend are economic supports to the
South African apartheid regime, a
protester said.
"We have not forgotten the admi
nistrators w ho are our enemies in the
fight for divestment," he said. ' We
chose this office because it is a central
symbol of what we oppose."
The sit-in began at 1 p.m. yester
day, when about 15 protesters, call
ing themselves Students in Solidarity
with the Peoples of South Africa, en
tered the Bursar's Office on the main
floor of Old Union. Many of the stu
dents said they intended to remain
there until forcibly removed.
Shortly before 3 p.m., a cashier in
the Bursar's Office pressed an alarm,
reportedly because she overheard
protesters planning to move to the
business side of the till. Police advised
the students that such an act would be
a felonyt and nothing happened'.
At 5 p.m., University Bursar Jon
Erickson told the students, "I request
that you vacate this office, so we can
close in a normal manner."
Herrington said police acted on a
"pretty standard policy" in arresting
the students who refused to vacate
the University building.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons added, "They chose one area
of the University that's very secure â€”
and has to be, with confidential stu
dent records. They leave no alterna
tive but arrest."
