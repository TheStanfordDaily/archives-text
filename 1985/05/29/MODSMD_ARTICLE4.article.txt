## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
President Reagan Friday nominated
Thomas Moore, senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution and director of
Hoover s Domestic Studies Program, to he
a member of the Council of Economic Ad
visers in Washington, D.C.
The council advises the president and
the administration "on appropriate eco
nomic policy," according to Moore. The
council also prepares the annual Economic
Report of the President, provides eco
nomic forecasts and advises on budget and
tax policy.
"I hope to bring some sense to a lot of
government programs," Moore said.
Moore said he will be involved specifi
cally in microeconomic issues, focusing on
such areas as agriculture, transportation,
health welfare, regulatory policies and en
vironmental issues. A member's responsi
bility also includes participation in specific
legislative and administrative decision
making.
Moore explained that the original aim of
the council when it was set up in 1946 was

to promote full employment, because
many economists thought the United Staes
would return to a state of depression and
wide unemployment. But recent years
have changed and broadened the emphasis
of the council to include inflation and
other economic issues, he added.
Moore will be one of two members to
assist the newly appointed chairman of the
council, Bryl Sprinkel. He said the current
chairman interviewed a number of people
and "his name alone" was recommended
to the White House, which thought Moore
was "a good choice." He added that the
other assistant has yet to be named.
Moore was a senior staff economist on
the council from for Presidents
Johnson anil Nixon, under Chairman Ar
thur Okun.
"I have a bipartisan background," he
noted.
The council also has junior staff
economists, who are graduate students
who have completed all studies but their
dissertations. Moore said he has named
graduate student David Bizer to one of
these positions.

Moore refused to comment in detail on
his future plans and aspirations for his new
job.
"One of the things the council should do
is not to make policy publicly," he said.
Moore added that he would like to keep all
specifics of his plans out of the press.
Commenting on how his nomination af
fects the University's reputation, Moore
said it is "another sign of having good
scholars who are actually doing policy
work."
Economics Prof. Michael Boskin said
Moore's "willingness to do social work"
should he commended.
Moore is "a good general
microeconomist, and I think he will do a
terrific job," Boskin added.
Moore's research at Hoover has focused
predominantly on transportation, energy
and the environment. He is currently
researching the impact of airline deregula
tion.
Moore's responsibilities as director of
the Domestic Studies Program include
oversight and administration of there

search program. He also chairs a search
committee that recommends resident and
visiting scholars to the program.
Prior to his appointment at Hoover,
Moore was a member of the economics de
partment at Carnegie Institute of Technol
ogy and an economics professor at Mich
igan State University He has lectured
both at the Stanford Graduate School of
Business and at UCLA.
Moore earned a doctorate in economics
and a master's from the University of
Chicago. He also holds a bachelor's degree
in economics from George Washington
University.
Moore has written such books as "The
Economics of the American Theater"
(1968), "Freight Transportation Regula
tion" (1972), "Trucking Regulation: Les
sons from Europe" (1976) and "Uranium
Enrichment and Public Policy" (1978).
Moore has also contributed sections of
"To Promote Prosperity" (1984), " The
F r uture of American Oil" (1976) and
"Selected Readings in Quantitative Urban
