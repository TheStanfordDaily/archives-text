# Construction crews redo laying of pipe
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
Construction crews are once again
digging up the campus, this time to
replace 160.000 feet of recently laid
underground conduit tubes which will
protect various telephone, telecom
munication and computer cables
when the 6-month-old project is
finished.
Between November and late last
month, construction crews laid about
228,000 feet of the conduit, a heavy
plastic pipe, four inches in diameter,
designed to protect sensitive cables.
When the conduit was tested in late
April, engineers discovered that
about 70 percent of the pipe had been
improperly installed and needed to be
replaced.

Much of the conduit had been com
pressed by the covering dirt and sand
or bent by other underground water
and sewer pipes, according to James
Tomerlin, project manager for Volt
Business Communications. Western
Region — the company replacing the
damaged pipes.
"It was a combination of compac
tion and poor construction methods."
Tomerlin said. The new conduit "will
not be stronger, just put in correctly"
and "rerouted in some cases," he
added.
Sites where crews must dig up and
replace buried conduits include the
roads around Meyer Library, the
road between Encina Hall and the
