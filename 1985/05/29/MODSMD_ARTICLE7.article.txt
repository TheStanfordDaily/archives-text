American kidnapped in Beirut
BEIRUT — Six gunmen driving a blue van kidnapped the American
director of a university hospital yesterday as he walked across a Beirut
street on his way to work.
The abduction of David Jacobsen, 54, of Huntington Beach
heightened alarm that the few Westerners remaining in the embattled
city are targets of roving gunmen.
Jacobsen, director of the American University of Beirut hospital, is
the sixth American kidnapped in Beirut since March 1984. He was
walking to work with a doctor from the hospital when six men with guns
jumped from the van.
A witness, who declined to be identified, said the gunmen all carried
handguns and fired a shot at the unidentified doctor's feet. The ricochet
ripped a hole in his trousers, but did not hit him.
The witness said Jacobsen told the assailants in broken Arabic:
"Okay, I'll go, I'll go." He was bundled into the back of the van and
driven off.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
In Washington, State Department spokesman Bernard Kalb said the
kidnapping made it obvious that the threat to Americans in Lebanon
remains high.
"No one should consider oneself immune from that threat," he said.
"We believe that Americans should avoid travel to Lebanon and
Americans in Beirut should take advantage of opportunities to leave."
Jacobsen was the third Westerner kidnapped in mostly Moslem west
Beirut in a week. Unidentified gunmen grabbed two Frenchmen on the
road to the city's airport last Wednesday. Police said they still are mis
sing.
Jacobsen, who lives on the campus, was appointed director of the uni
versity's hospital, the biggest medical center in Beirut, last fall. He di
rected a hospital in Saudi Arabia before coming to Lebanon.
Robert Barry, New York spokesman for the American University in
Beirut, said Jacobsen's apartment is adjacent to the hospital, but that
Jacobsen had to cross a public street to reach the hospital entrance.
The American University's acting president, Lufti Diab, said the uni
versity's administration was trying to contact government authorities
and militia leaders "to assist in having Mr. Jacobsen freed."
A statement by the university said it believed the kidnappers were not
aware of Jacobsen's identity. The medical faculty, professors and other
university staff appealed in a statement to the kidnappers to release
Jacobsen "and give free scope to doctors and all hospital personnel to do
their work properly, away from all existing conflicts."
Jacobsen is the second American official of the university to be kid
napped in Beirut since gunmen began picking up Westerners March 16,
1984.
The university's librarian, Peter Kilburn, 60, failed to show up for
work Dec. 3. Islamic Jihad, a shadowy group of fundamentalist Shiite
Moslems who have apparently been behind many of the kidnappings,
claimed they hold Kilburn.
But in recent statements by the group they have made no mention of
him. On May 16 they said in statements published in Beirut newspapers
that they are holding four Americans and two Frenchmen.
The Americans named are William Buckley, 56, a U.S. Embassy poli
tical officer; the Rev. Benjamin Weir, 60, a Presbyterian minister; the
Rev. Lawrence Jenco, 50, a Roman Catholic priest, and Terry Ander
son, 37. chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.
Soviets launch Afghan offensive
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — At least 10.000 Soviet troops backed by
tanks, jets and helicopter gunships have launched one of the biggest of
fensives of the Afghan war to cut off guerrilla supply lines at the Pakis
tan border, Western sources said yesterday.
Western diplomatic sources, speaking here on condition they not be
identified further, said Soviet troop formations and armored columns
began moving out of the Afghan capital of Kabul earlier this month in
preparation for an offensive in Kunar and Laghman provinces.
Scores of Soviet and Afghan aircraft have also been carrying troops
and supplies to Afghanistan's eastern provinces near the Pakistani bor
der, the sources said.
The Soviet Union sent troops into neighboring Afghanistan in 1979.
An estimated 115,000 Soviet troops are now garrisoned in the country
to support the Marxist government of Babrak Karmal, which is chal
lenged by Moslem insurgents.
Past attacks have mobilized up to 20,000 Soviet soldiers. In the latest
campaign, the first major offensive along the Pakistani border, Western
sources said at least 10,000 combat troops had been committed, but in
dicated the total was probably much higher.
In undertaking the campaign, Soviet commanders appear to be trying
to halt convoys that bring weapons and supplies across the border to the
guerrillas, the sources said.
The timing of the attack also appears to indicate that Soviet com
manders are hoping to forestall the guerrillas' summer offensive by cut
ting off supplies, they said.
Western reporters are barred from Afghanistan, and it was impossible
to verify independently reports of Soviet movements.
However, Afghan guerrilla leaders told The Associated Press that So
viet and Afghan government forces have launched a major offensive in
Kunar province, and that their men are coming under frequent, heavy
attack.
One commander, who asked not to be identified for security reasons,
said the Soviets were determined to end the guerrilla siege of the border
town of Barikot, where an Afghan garrison is reportedly trapped.
Reports from Kunar indicate Soviet and Afghan warplanes have
launched heavy bombing raids, devastating large areas, the Western
sources said. Travelers reported seeing large Soviet troop formations
and tanks, artillery and other military equipment moving into the region.
Reports of a new Soviet offensive coincide with other reports from the
border region of killing of civilians, the diplomatic sources said.
More than 100 civilians were killed when Soviet aircraft bombed the
village of Surkh Khan on May 13, the sources said.
Pope's assassin disrupts trial again
ROME — The state's star witness in the trial of seven men accused of
a plot to kill the pope disrupted the trial for a second day yesterday by
claiming he is Jesus Christ reincarnated.
Mehmct Ali Agca also politely refused to testify about the gun he used
to shoot Pope John Paul 11. but indicated he might be willing to talk
about it later.
Prosecutor Antonio Marini said he was not concerned by the Turkish
gunman's erratic behavior. "When he begins to speak about facts, he is
very believable," Marini told reporters.
Agca. 27. initially said he acted alone in shooting John Paul on May
13. 1981. in St. Peter's Square. He told investigators later of a plot ar
ranged in Bulgaria.
His testimony led to the indictments of three Bulgarians and four
Turks now being tried on charges of complicity. Of the defendants, only
Agca, two other l urks and one Bulgarian are in Italian custody. The
others are being tried in absentia.
The prosecutor who brought the indictments, Antonio Albano, con
tended that Bulgaria, possibly with Soviet help, masterminded the plot
to kill John Paul because of his support for the Solidarity free trade
union in his native Poland.
Giuseppe Consolo, who represents the Bulgarian in custody, said of
Agca, "This is a man who has been fooling with Italian justice for three
years. He has been playing with innocent people who are in jail because
of this fellow's lies."
The pope, who was seriously wounded in the shooting, said he "prays
every day for a gotxl. positive solution of this episode so that it does not
weigh heavily on the name of a Slavic people."
