# Calls current system 'un-American'
## Reagan offers tax reform plan 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan yesterday
proposed the biggest overhaul ever in the nation's
tax code, denouncing the current system as so com
plicated and unjust that it is "un-American" and
offering a "revolutionary" plan to cut most individ
ual tax rates and close loopholes.
In remarks prepared for a nationally televised
Oval Office address, Reagan promised that his
package would "reduce tax burdens on the working
people of this country, close loopholes that benefit
a privileged few, simplify a code so complex even
Albert Einstein reportedly needed help on his 1040
form, and lead us into a future of greater growth
and opportunity for all."
The president said the tax system has been
changed dozens of times in hundreds of ways. "Yet,
most of those changes didn't improve the system,
they made it more like Washington itself: compli
cated, unfair, cluttered with gobbledygook and
loopholes designed for those with the power and
influence to hire high-priced legal and tax ad
visers."
He said, "I believe that, in both spirit and sub
stance, our tax system has come to be un-
American."
By contrast, he said his plan would be "the
strongest, pro-family initiative in post-war his
tory."
In the Democratic response to the president's

address, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chair
man of the tax-writing House Ways and Means
Committee, called Reagan's plan "a starting point"
to change the system, and said Democrats will not
rubber stamp the president's package.
Conceding that previous attempts to improve the
system have produced meager results, Ros
tenkowski said this time might turn out differently.
"This time, it's a Republican president who's
bucking his party's tradition as protector of big
business and the wealthy," Rostenkowski said in
prepared remarks. "His words and feeling go back
to Roosevelt and Truman and Kennedy. But the
commitment comes from Ronald Reagan. And
that's so important and so welcome.
"Because if the president's plan is everything he
says it is — he'll have a great deal of Democratic
support," Rostenkowski said. "This time, I really
think we can get tax reform."
Rostenkowski openly acknowledged the pre
ssures on Congress to protect various benefits.
"We are 535 men and women, each from a dif
ferent part of the country, each with different inter
ests to represent — each with our own tax agenda,"
Rostenkowski added. "Big special-interest lobbies
have already joined forces against reform. The
campaign to divide Congress has begun."
He called on Americans to let Congress know
the country wants tax reform.

Reagan said, "The power of these incentives
would send one, simple, straightforward message to
an entire nation: America, go for it."
Reagan said the number of taxpayers who would
have to itemize would be reduced to one in four.
"We envision a system where more than half of
us would not even have to fill out a return," the
president said. Under that plan, taxpayers would
let the Internal Revenue Service calculate their
taxes.
A fact sheet distributed by the White House said
overall taxes paid by individuals would be reduced
by 7 percent, while total taxes paid by corporations
would be increased by 9 percent.
The maximum corporate tax rate would be cut to
33 percent from the current level of 46 percent.
"We are determined to cut back on special
preferences that have too long favored some indus
tries at the expense of others," Reagan said.
Reagan said that under his plan, a family of four
at the poverty level income of $12,000 would pay
no taxes.
The president described his plan as "a revolu
tionary first for fairness in our future."
He urged Democrats to put aside politics in what
he called "a great national debate" which is about
to begin.
