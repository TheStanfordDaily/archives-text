DHAKA, Bangladesh — Ships and
helicopters shuttled through the Bay
of Bengal yesterday, bringing fopd
and taking away bodies. Mass burials
were held on patches of mud that had
been inhabited islands until a devas
tating storm swept them clean.
No one knows how many people
died in the storm Saturday. The
government says 1,400 deaths are
confirmed. The Red Cross says at
least 5,000 were killed. Newspaper
and other unofficial reports put the
total as high as 40,000.

A government official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, quoted
President Hussain Ershad, the army
general who governs the country, as
saying as many as 10,000 people may
have been killed.
On Urir Char, an island where
nothing was left standing, Navy
Cmdr. Iqbal Mujtaba watched the
mass burial of 900 people yesterday.
He said warning of the approaching
storm had been given as early as
Thursday, but the island people had
"no place to go and no way to get

there. All they could do was sit there
thinking almighty God would help
them."
An official who announced the
government statistics acknowledged
that there were no lists of people mis
sing after the storm swept over the
flat islands and coastal delta 220
miles south of Dhaka.
Mujtaba said 1,119 people were
evacuated after the storm from Urir
Char, described as the hardest-hit is
land, to nearby Sandwip, and be
tween 4,000 and 5,000 other

residents were unaccounted for. He
commands two Bangladesh navy
ships that brought rice, beans, milk
and clothing to the survivors.
He said many of the 900 people
buried on Urir Char were put into the
mass grave without being identified.
Urir Char is one of many islands
formed by silt from the Ganges,
Brahmaputra and Meghma rivers.
Small farmers moved to the islands
after erosion destroyed their farms on
the mainland, and officials in Dhaka
said many may have remained in spite
of the storm warning for fear other
squatters would displace them.
Many delta villages also wert?
devastated. Survivors at Charlaxmi,
10 miles inland, said a 20-foot wall of
water swept in from the bay and
crushed the village, killing an esti
mated 3,000 of the 10,000 residents.,
Reporters who visited the area yes
terday said many bodies of people
and livestock had not been removed
and more were being washed ashore
by waves moving in from the bay.
Public health officials said they
feared outbreaks of cholera, typhoid
and other diseases because „.o£ ..con
taminated drinking water and
decomposing corpses. Abul Khair,
sitting on a raised piece of ground
where his home once stood on Urir
Char, began sobbing when he
recounted the loss of seven members
of his family, including his wife.
"Ask Him (God) what He has
done," Khair said, looking at the sky.
"Today even He must be crying over
the tragedy."
