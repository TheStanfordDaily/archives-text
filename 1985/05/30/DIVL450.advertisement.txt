BACKPACKING:
Imagine yourself hanging out in an alpine meadow high up in yourfavorite mountains, enjoying the
sunset and reflecting that the strenuous off trail hike ended at the second most beautiful campsite in
the world; that the bubble-and-fly bagged a panful of trout; that the bread rose, the raisin-walnut
cake was the best thing you ever tasted, and the brandy hot chocolate warmed your very soul. If this
sounds enticing, then, Backpacking: A Hedonist's Guide is the book for you.
