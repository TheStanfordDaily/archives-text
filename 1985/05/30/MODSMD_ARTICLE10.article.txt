Comparable worth gains
PALO ALTO — The city council has ratified a
comparable worth agreement intended to put
salaries for city workers in traditionally female
jobs on par with workers in similar jobs usually
held by men.
The agreement gives a 5 percent to 21 percent
wage hike to 142 women working as secretaries,
librarians and other typically female jobs.
"The city has done a fair thing, the right
thing." said Abby Boyd, president of Local 715
of Service Employees International Union. "We
do not have parity, but this a significant step in
the right direction. These raises are enough to
make a difference in some women's lives."
Mayor Leland Levy, who abstained from Tues
day's 7-0 council vote, said "other cities have
done it. but it's still a small minority . The council
felt that the argument that certain positions are
primarily occupied b\ women was a valid one."
The city will pay 5244,300 more for pas equity
adjustments the firrst year and SI 14.300 the
second year. In nearby San Jose was the
nation's first city to pass comparable worth legis
lation. setting aside $1.4 million to upgrade
salaries of jobs dominated by women.
United tires blow out
SAN FRANCISCO — A United Airlines
Boeing 747 bleu five of IX tires on landing at San

Francisco International Airport because ot a
malfunctioning brake mechanism, a federal in
vestigator said yesterday .
Robert Palmer, an inspector with the Federal
Aviation Administration, said a lengthy ex
amination of Flight ISO from Honolulu on Tues
day determined that there was a minor malfunc
tion of the brakes' anti-skid system.
The anti-skid system in the brakes prevents the
plane's tires from locking no matter how much
pressure is exerted on the brakes.
FAA spokeswoman Barbara Abels said in this
case, the failure of the anti-skid mechanism
caused the tires to lock, which apparently trig
gered the blowouts.
None of the 429 passengers and crew members
aboard was injured, and the plane stopped
abruptly on the runway after the blowouts.
Palmer said five blown tires was unusual but
added. "Because of the tremendous inertia in
volved. it doesn't take much to blow a tire."
He said the aircraft had gone into annual in
spection and would not be flown again "prior to a
lengthy inspection."
Chavez: new strike
SACRAMENTO — Cesar Chavez warned
yesterday of new strikes in the fields as the
Legislature's auditor general said that more
worker complaints have been dismissed in recent
years by the farm labor board's ecncral counsel.

Chavez, head of the United Farm Workers,
said his union plans to use boycotts and then
strikes to pressure growers to accept "pre
contract agreements" protecting workers who try
to organize farm labor elections.
He said he also wanted growers to agree
beforehand to bargain in good faith it the UFW
wins an election to represent agricultural
workers.
C have/, said the campaign will be aimed ini
tially at table grape growers but added "there will
be others." He said it would involve boycotts
against non-union grapes in 10 cities in Canada
anil the U.S., including New York, Los Angeles,
San Francisco, Chicago, Philadelphia, Toronto
and Montreal.
"We want a pre-contract agreement where we
have a guarantee Irom table grape growers that
those workers that want elections will have fair
elections and will not be fired," Chavez said.
Chavez talked to reporters following a hearing
at which the auditor general released a report on
the efficiency of the Agricultural Labor Relations
Board.
