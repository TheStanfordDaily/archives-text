## Making his way by design Features

If dorm doors could talk, Thom
Todacheeney's would tell quite a
story. His door, like those of many
Stanford students, has clippings about
Madonna and television's "Dynasty."
But Todacheeney's door also has arti
cles on fashion designer Yves St.
Laurent and the House of C hloe.
Todacheeney. a senior majoring in
communication, spends much of his
time designing high-fashion clothing.
A Navajo Indian from Farmington,
N.M., Todacheeney had a passion for
liantc couture from a young age. He
saw his first fashion magazine.
Vogue, in the second grade and was
fascinated by the models, who
dressed very differently from Far
mington women. He says the models
wore perfectly matched outfits with
hats and gloves, unlike Farmington
women, who wore practical clothing.
I.ike most 8-year-olds, Toda
cheeney watched television, but unlike
them, he paid attention to the actors'
costumes. He would sit in front of the
television with a pad of paper and a
pencil and draw the costumes the way
he thought they should be.
Farmington lifestyle largely in
fluenced Todacheeney, he says. The
town "always seemed behind the
times" because it was small and had
little activity, he says. 1 here were few
museums and dancing places and the
big activity was cruising down Main
Street every night. He found fashion
to be an escape, and he studied a lot
through high school, becoming inter
ested in designing clothes as a
pastime.
Todacheeney says he had to com
bat bigotry and racism in Farmington,
a community with a minority of
Navajo Indians. School was "always a
struggle because 1 had to prove
myself," he says. "Teachers always
assumed I was in the wrong class. No
one felt an Indian was capable of ex
celling. They were surprised when I
asked questions or did very well in
exams."
In high school, Todacheeney
wanted to become a doctor. But in
11th grade he almost fainted in an
operating theater and realized that

medicine was not his profession. He
then decided to make fashion design
ing his career goal, he says.
The people in Farmington frowned
upon fashion designing and consid
ered it an unacceptable occupation,
especially for a man. Partly because
of this, Todacheeney told only his
family and close friends about his
love of designing, "it was something I
considered private." he says.
His family supported his decision
to design clothing. Todacheeney says
his father, a hospital administrator,
and his mother are not artistically in
clined. but "they liked the idea that I
was doing something creative."
At Stanford, he became interested
in the advertising area of communica
tion. He worked out a program with
his communication adviser. Prof.
Everett Rogers, that allowed him to
major in communication and focus on
high-fashion designing. He took com
munication classes, studied costume
design and learned to sew.
Todacheeney, 22, devoted, and
continues to devote, much of his time
to designing clothing. His designs are
between American and European
designers' fashions. Todacheeney
described them as "a little bit more
elaborate than American designers
are today, but a little less elaborate
than European designers."
Barbara Cleveland, a costumer in
Stanford's Drama Department, says
Todacheeney's designs are
"sophisticated, elegant and quite
wearable and usable."
Todacheeney says he prefers de
signing evening wear over day wear
because he likes opulence and "in the
evening, you can be bolder and wear
more outrageous things." Toda
cheeney, who generally designs his
clothing for a perfect size 7 model,
uses velvets and taffetas for evening
wear and wools and linens for day
wear. He uses pillbox hats and veils,
which he finds mysterious, alluring
and elegant, to add a special flair to
his designs.
During his sophomore year, he de
signed a 30-layer chiffon bridal dress
