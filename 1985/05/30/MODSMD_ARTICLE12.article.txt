## The 						Stanford Daily The 						AIDS scare

There is no shortage of clean needles in Bay
Area blood banks. There is, however, a shortage
of blood supplies in local hospitals and clinics. A
complete explanation for the dropoff has yet to
be offered, but officials at blood banks here and
in San Francisco believe that would-be donors
are not giving blood for fear of catching AIDS.
Irwin Memorial Blood Bank, which serves
most San Francisco hospitals, may be on the
brink of a crisis, according to Executive Director
Brian McDonough. Irwin Memorial collected
125,000 pints in 1982 â€” the first year a hetero
sexual recipient death from AIDS was traced to
infected blood received from the blood bank.
Donations have been declining steadily ever
since, to a current annual rate of 98,000.
Closer to home, the Stanford Blood Bank
reports a 10 percent drop in its donations, ac
cording to Edgar Engleman, medical director of
the blood bank and an assistant professor of pa
thology here. "Ten percent doesn't represent at

this moment a threat to the blood supply. But if it
goes up, we'll have a major problem," he said
Tuesday.
That it is impossible to contract AIDS by
giving blood is obvious. Blood donations are
taken with hypodermic needles and syringes that
are used only once and then discarded; there is
no chance of contracting AIDS from a tainted
needle because there are no tainted needles. But
blood bank officials say that the AIDS panic has
caused potential blood donors to confuse the acts
of giving blood and receiving tranfusions. While a
person cannot get AIDS from donating blood, it
is possible to contract the disease by receiving
AIDS-contaminated blood. The blood banks
have been responsible in dealing with this con
cern, however; Stanford's was the first blood
bank to test all blood for the antibodies of the
virus suspected of causing AIDS.
There is no relationship between getting AIDS
and giving blood; that is clear. But sometimes the
clearest things are the hardest to see.
