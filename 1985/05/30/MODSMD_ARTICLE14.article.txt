A J o delusions
In response to Luke Cole's
"Carrot and stick" letter (The Daily,
May 23), we would like to elaborate
the purpose and goal of our petition.
We have asked students and alumni
not to make donations to Stanford
University until they feel that the
University formulates and practices a
morally acceptable investment
policy. Implicit in this plea is that we
encourage donations to Stanford
when individuals believe that Stan
ford's investment policy is moral.
Naturally, the determination of what
is 'morally acceptable" is left to the
individual's conscience.
We also do not have delusions that
the result of this petition will be to
fiscally cripple Stanford. However,
this petition does serve to unite a
diversity of students and alumni who
disapprove of Stanford's current
investment policy. We feel that it is
contrary to those values which a
university should embody for Stan
ford to merely invest with the intent
of maximizing returns, without ex
amining the moral implications of
these investments.

A brilliant sleuth
Congratulations to the esteemed

Graduate Senator Richard Beigel for
his superb sleuthing work (The
Daily, May 21). Who else but the
brilliant Beigel could have unearthed
the ugly truth that both Slate of
Mind candidate Steve Smith and I
are Phi Delts? 1 should have known
better than not to mention my Greek
affiliation in my letter to The Daily.
If people don't mention these things,
how are simple-minded people going
to make simple-minded generaliza
tions and come to simple-minded
conclusions? I guess it is hard for
people whose minds are cluttered
with thoughts of playing politics to
comprehend that some people can
have opinions based on fairness and
equity rather than petty associations.
I am sure that Beigel would be inter
ested to know that Mac Slate candi
date Andrew Fischer told me that he
liked my letter. (No, Beigel, he is an
SAE.)
Regarding the rest of Beigel's
misguided thinking and dubious
analogies, he is mistaken if he
believes that I do not favor elections.
I believe in them so much that I feel
we should abide by their results and
not keep redoing them. (That is
unless someone proposed redoing
the election that put Beigel in of
fice.)
Oh, and another thing, Beigelboy;
the next time you accuse someone of
libel, try to avoid calling him a
"tard" or a "miscreant" (at least
until after you have met him). You
know what they say about glass
houses.
