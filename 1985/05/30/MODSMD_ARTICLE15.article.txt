# Excess specialization causes problems
## 
### 
Spring: when a young man's fancy turns to love,
and a young sophomore's mind turns reluctantly to
that most dreaded of duties — declaring a major.
Pity the poor undeclared underclassman; having
left behind the fun and frolic of youth, he now
labors under the grim shadow of The Decision. For
him, this is a time of trauma and heartbreak. He
knows that many of his classmates have already
made their decisions. He knows that they will
become doctors and bankers and engineers.He
knows that they have chosen their area of
specialization, that everyone has chosen an area of
specialization, and that he had better choose his
area soon, lest he be condemned to the ash heap of
society and become one of the forlorn number
desperately praying to get jobs as full-time
Domino's Pizza delivery men.Right?
Right. Exaggerated, but right. And too bad —
too bad that we all place such excessive value on
specializing. The undergraduate major decision is
but the first in a series of steps we take to narrow
ourselves, to find our personal niche in the world.
We may veer aside from time to time, we may
switch paths, but ultimately the aim is the same: to
find one thing that makes us more or less satisfied,
and do that one thing forever.The specialty is the
thing that defines us. We use our specializations
like indentification cards. No Stanford undergradu
ate in the history of the University has ever
graduated without being asked at least 52 times,
"What's your major?" Besides being a tried, true,
and excruciatingly boring conversation opener, the
question is also a reflection of the premium we
place on specialization. The question is so common
because the attitude is so pervasive: One has to
specialize in something, or one isn't doing anything
worthwhile.
Such an attitude is all too easy to acquire. Society
rewards specialization as it rewards few other
things. You don't get recognized for being a dilet
tante. Instead, if you do one thing enormously well
and society approves of that thing, you are likely to
be paid high tribute.ln fact, the better you are at
that one thing, the more likely you'll be listened to
on a wide variety of subjects. Witness Stanford's
own William Shockley, a Nobel Prize-winning
physicist who added a great deal of respectability to
the silly notion that blacks are genetically inferior
to whites.That a knowledge of physics doesn't have
an awful lot to do with expertise in genetics was al
most immaterial.
Specialization provides us personal rewards as
well. Emeritus Biology Prof. Colin Pittendrigh told
those of us assembled at the first Junior Convoca
tion that "nothing but the pursuit of something in
depth" gives a person true understanding. Indeed,
there is a great deal of personal satisfaction to be
had from knowing more about something than
anyone else. On the flip side, there's a great deal of
personal dissatisfaction to be had from getting into
discussions with people who know a lot about
something when you only know a little. This quar
ter I'm taking an arms control seminar which I am
convinced is populated by State Department offi

cials masquerading as Stanford students. For the
first few classes, the extent of my contribution to
the discussions was a carefully considered, "Good
point," and an equally sincere, "What did you
say?" — neither of which I was brave enough to say
aloud.
Clearly, specialization is the way to go. The suc
cessful specialist sits at the apex of human society.
It hardly matters whether his specialty is microchip
technology or the psychology of fingernail biting.
But specialization does not always profit society; it
can and does work to our detriment. Granted, a
human being has only so much time. To focus upon
one field necessarily means excluding equally im
portant others. This is why we have a division of
labor; I study fingernail biting, you study micro
chips, we both contribute our knowledge to society,

A greater danger is that
a society of specialized
people with specialized
concerns can be easily
manipulated.

and all are better off. But to the extent that we
deny ourselves knowledge of important fields in
this complex society, we give up control of seg
ments of our existence to others. If I rely upon you
to know everything about nuclear power, 1 also rely
upon you to use that knowledge responsibly and in
the best interests of humankind. Such is the societal
contract. That people break it, inadvertantly or
deliberately, is only one problem.
A greater danger is that a society of specialized
people with specialized concerns can be easily
manipulated by its leaders. So long as you refrain
from interfering with my work or make no incor
rect statements within the realm of my particular
knowledge, so long as you hold the key to informa
tion which I trust you to understand, you can ma
nipulate me. Others in other specialties may see a
problem and speak out, but I am not likely to say
anything because I know little or nothing about the
subject at hand. This can be a serious problem. The
oft-quoted Hannah Arendt wrote of "the banality
of evil" in reference to Nazi war criminals like

Adolf Eichmann. Eichmann and his ilk were not
diabolical masterminds pursuing grand strategies;
they were administrators, specialists doing special
ized jobs.
The danger is not confined to outside manipula
tion. Specialization can become so extreme as to
lead to an isolation that allows people to pursue ad
vancement in their particular fields with little
regard for the greater effects on society. The his
tory of the atomic bomb's development is replete
with tales of how the scientists' overriding concern
was that the weapon work; scant concern was given
to the consequences of the bomb's success. One of
the most disturbing accounts I've ever read des
cribed how a Soviet atomic scientist, unhappy with
Stalin's disinterest in his work, finally persuaded
the dictator to increase research funding by con
vincing him that the results could be used to build a
bomb.
Now, before I get too carried away, I'll be the
first to admit that the poor sophomore going in to
declare his major is not committing himself to per
petrating war crimes. The relation between the two
actions is clearly tenuous at best. Still, there's a
problem with excessive specialization and to one
degree or another, with everything which contri
butes to it.And in a world of ever-increasing com
plexity. that problem becomes magnified.
So what do we do? The limitations of time
remain; we cannot know everything about every
thing. Many of us who took Western Culture can
remember suffering through "The Book of the
Courtier," an unintentionally funny volume which
defined the Renaissance man as someone who
could thrash his rivals in a duel, dance with the
grace and elegance of a Mikhail Baryshnikov and
discuss in detail the qualities of civic humanism —
all more or less at the same time. That ideal may be
a bit out of reach in these times, but we might gain
from actually training at least some people to know
something about most things, to recognize overall
patterns and to think about the world as a system
rather than in pieces — in other words, people who
specialize in generalizing. Still more effective might
be my perennial solution to everything: better
educating people to think critically, so that even if
they don't know specifics, they can carefully exam
ine and evaluate the specialists' positions and argu
ments, as well as the effects their own actions have
on society at large.
Of course, none of this helps our miserable soph
omore, who is not given the option of selecting a
major in introductory classes. As an older and
supposedly wiser upperclassman, my only sugges
tion is to major in something interdisciplinary,
group a range of classes together under some
flexible area of concentration and pursue your own
eclectic education. You may feel like an idiot in
arms control seminars, but at the very least you'll
realize how much you don't know about a lot of
things — and that may well be the most important
lesson of all.

Domino's Pizza delivery men.Right?
Right. Exaggerated, but right. And too bad —
too bad that we all place such excessive value on
specializing. The undergraduate major decision is
but the first in a series of steps we take to narrow
ourselves, to find our personal niche in the world.
We may veer aside from time to time, we may
switch paths, but ultimately the aim is the same: to
find one thing that makes us more or less satisfied,
and do that one thing forever.The specialty is the
thing that defines us. We use our specializations
like indentification cards. No Stanford undergradu
ate in the history of the University has ever
graduated without being asked at least 52 times,
"What's your major?" Besides being a tried, true,
and excruciatingly boring conversation opener, the
question is also a reflection of the premium we
place on specialization. The question is so common
because the attitude is so pervasive: One has to
specialize in something, or one isn't doing anything
worthwhile.
Such an attitude is all too easy to acquire. Society
rewards specialization as it rewards few other
things. You don't get recognized for being a dilet
tante. Instead, if you do one thing enormously well
and society approves of that thing, you are likely to
be paid high tribute.ln fact, the better you are at
that one thing, the more likely you'll be listened to
on a wide variety of subjects. Witness Stanford's
own William Shockley, a Nobel Prize-winning
physicist who added a great deal of respectability to
the silly notion that blacks are genetically inferior
to whites.That a knowledge of physics doesn't have
an awful lot to do with expertise in genetics was al
most immaterial.
Specialization provides us personal rewards as
well. Emeritus Biology Prof. Colin Pittendrigh told
those of us assembled at the first Junior Convoca
tion that "nothing but the pursuit of something in
depth" gives a person true understanding. Indeed,
there is a great deal of personal satisfaction to be
had from knowing more about something than
anyone else. On the flip side, there's a great deal of
personal dissatisfaction to be had from getting into
discussions with people who know a lot about
something when you only know a little. This quar
ter I'm taking an arms control seminar which I am
convinced is populated by State Department offi

cials masquerading as Stanford students. For the
first few classes, the extent of my contribution to
the discussions was a carefully considered, "Good
point," and an equally sincere, "What did you
say?" — neither of which I was brave enough to say
aloud.
Clearly, specialization is the way to go. The suc
cessful specialist sits at the apex of human society.
It hardly matters whether his specialty is microchip
technology or the psychology of fingernail biting.
But specialization does not always profit society; it
can and does work to our detriment. Granted, a
human being has only so much time. To focus upon
one field necessarily means excluding equally im
portant others. This is why we have a division of
labor; I study fingernail biting, you study micro
chips, we both contribute our knowledge to society,

A greater danger is that
a society of specialized
people with specialized
concerns can be easily
manipulated.

and all are better off. But to the extent that we
deny ourselves knowledge of important fields in
this complex society, we give up control of seg
ments of our existence to others. If I rely upon you
to know everything about nuclear power, 1 also rely
upon you to use that knowledge responsibly and in
the best interests of humankind. Such is the societal
contract. That people break it, inadvertantly or
deliberately, is only one problem.
A greater danger is that a society of specialized
people with specialized concerns can be easily
manipulated by its leaders. So long as you refrain
from interfering with my work or make no incor
rect statements within the realm of my particular
knowledge, so long as you hold the key to informa
tion which I trust you to understand, you can ma
nipulate me. Others in other specialties may see a
problem and speak out, but I am not likely to say
anything because I know little or nothing about the
subject at hand. This can be a serious problem. The
oft-quoted Hannah Arendt wrote of "the banality
of evil" in reference to Nazi war criminals like

Adolf Eichmann. Eichmann and his ilk were not
diabolical masterminds pursuing grand strategies;
they were administrators, specialists doing special
ized jobs.
The danger is not confined to outside manipula
tion. Specialization can become so extreme as to
lead to an isolation that allows people to pursue ad
vancement in their particular fields with little
regard for the greater effects on society. The his
tory of the atomic bomb's development is replete
with tales of how the scientists' overriding concern
was that the weapon work; scant concern was given
to the consequences of the bomb's success. One of
the most disturbing accounts I've ever read des
cribed how a Soviet atomic scientist, unhappy with
Stalin's disinterest in his work, finally persuaded
the dictator to increase research funding by con
vincing him that the results could be used to build a
bomb.
Now, before I get too carried away, I'll be the
first to admit that the poor sophomore going in to
declare his major is not committing himself to per
petrating war crimes. The relation between the two
actions is clearly tenuous at best. Still, there's a
problem with excessive specialization and to one
degree or another, with everything which contri
butes to it.And in a world of ever-increasing com
plexity. that problem becomes magnified.
So what do we do? The limitations of time
remain; we cannot know everything about every
thing. Many of us who took Western Culture can
remember suffering through "The Book of the
Courtier," an unintentionally funny volume which
defined the Renaissance man as someone who
could thrash his rivals in a duel, dance with the
grace and elegance of a Mikhail Baryshnikov and
discuss in detail the qualities of civic humanism —
all more or less at the same time. That ideal may be
a bit out of reach in these times, but we might gain
from actually training at least some people to know
something about most things, to recognize overall
patterns and to think about the world as a system
rather than in pieces — in other words, people who
specialize in generalizing. Still more effective might
be my perennial solution to everything: better
educating people to think critically, so that even if
they don't know specifics, they can carefully exam
ine and evaluate the specialists' positions and argu
ments, as well as the effects their own actions have
on society at large.
Of course, none of this helps our miserable soph
omore, who is not given the option of selecting a
major in introductory classes. As an older and
supposedly wiser upperclassman, my only sugges
tion is to major in something interdisciplinary,
group a range of classes together under some
flexible area of concentration and pursue your own
eclectic education. You may feel like an idiot in
arms control seminars, but at the very least you'll
realize how much you don't know about a lot of
things — and that may well be the most important
lesson of all.

Spring: when a young man's fancy turns to love,
and a young sophomore's mind turns reluctantly to
that most dreaded of duties — declaring a major.
Pity the poor undeclared underclassman; having
left behind the fun and frolic of youth, he now
labors under the grim shadow of The Decision. For
him, this is a time of trauma and heartbreak. He
knows that many of his classmates have already
made their decisions. He knows that they will
become doctors and bankers and engineers.He
knows that they have chosen their area of
specialization, that everyone has chosen an area of
specialization, and that he had better choose his
area soon, lest he be condemned to the ash heap of
society and become one of the forlorn number
desperately praying to get jobs as full-time
