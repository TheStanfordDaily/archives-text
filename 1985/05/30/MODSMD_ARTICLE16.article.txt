## There is hope for the Democratic Party 
### 
Many Republicans and political pundits have
recently begun to speculate on the early demise of
the Democratic Party. Badly beaten in the 1984
presidential election, the Democrats have ap
parently lost the confidence of the American
people in their ability to lead the country andes-

tablish a national agenda for the future. Although
Democrats control 34 of 50 governorships and hold
clear majorities in the House, state legislatures and
municipal governments, overwhelming landslide
defeats in three out of the last five presidential
elections stand out as a critical concern of party
leaders. Consequently, a period of introspection
and re-evaluation is taking place among the rank
and file, and it appears as if a course of moderation
will be the result of months of soul-searching and
agenda-building.
Much of the blame for the recent crisis has to be
placed on past policies that alienated middle-class
America by stressing the interests and issues of
"minority" groups. The party was viewed by many
Americans as a consortium of special interests that
controlled national candidates and promoted ex
cessive government spending. The result of such
control was a waste of valuable taxpayer dollars.
Thus, the election signaled an end to middle
class America's acceptance of special-interest
politics in favor of short-term monetary gain and
comfort. It \sas perceived that Democrats no longer
understood the importance of economic growth,
defense and American "interests." A party of the
minority had become the minority party.
The Democratic Part\. though — even in the

view of past failures — should not be written off
that easily. The new focus that is emerging from
party leaders is characterized by more middle-of
the-road policies and rhetoric. Both connections
and political organizations are tired and tried and,
as party intellectuals now realize, economic growth
and strong defense must be emphasized in order to
regain the confidence of the American people. The
party figureheads, though, have gone to great
lengths to assure labor, women, minorities and
other special interests — groups that have
delivered success in the past — that they will not be
abandoned. In effect, the "new" policies of the
Democratic Party should not and will not mirror
those of the Republicans. America definitely does
not need two Republican parties.
All across the nation. Democratic leaders have
been asking themselves tough questions about the
future of the country and are coming up with very
pragmatic and insightful solutions. Many have pro
posed programs to combat illegal immigration,
curb overcrowding in the prison systems,
modernize American industry so that it can effec
tively compete with foreign competition, solve in
creasing burdens of medical technology and
provide education for all young Americans to
prepare them for the challenges of the future.
These issues require complex and meaningful
thought, and Democratic leaders have pointed out
that the Reagan administration has apparently cho
sen to ignore the difficulties of formulating a na
tional agenda for the future in favor of policies of
meanness and selfishness. They are. in effect, gam
bling on the future of promoting the image of a
trouble-free and carefree American. This image is,
at best, shortsighted and dangerous.

The Democratic Party has a strong heritage of
progress and change. It has always, in times of crisis
and peace, developed ideas to solve the problems
of American society and ensure prosperity, vitality
and security. Even our current president believes
that the greatest periods of American strength and
prosperity occurred under Presidents Roosevelt,
Truman and Kennedy — all Democrats. The Dem
ocratic Party's history is indeed glorious and inspir
ing, but Democrats can no longer, as many are
starting to realize, hope to be elected on past
achievements. They must find prescriptive policies

The party, though, must
never forget its commit
ment to the disad
vantaged and voiceless.

that will, without increasing the burden on Ameri
can taxpayers, lead to a genuine spirit of patriotism
and strength. The party, though, must never forget
its commitment to the disadvantaged and voiceless.
The new Democratic voice, thus, offers a hope
for a prosperous economy which benefits all
Americans without forgetting the values and prin
ciples that made the Democratic Party the party of
the people. All Americans, and especially the
young, should share in the renewed Democratic vi
sion of hope and greatness for tomorrow. Indeed,
our best days are ahead.
