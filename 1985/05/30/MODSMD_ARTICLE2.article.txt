# COP cans two senate motions
## New senate upholds vetos News 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
In its lirst official action, the in
coming ASSU Senate last night up
held two vetoes issued late Tuesday
night by the outgoing Council of
Presidents (COP) on hills that affect
portions of the ASSU's operating
budget for the coming year.
I he new senate also rejected a pro
posal by Graduate Senator Jim
McGrath to reform the structure of
the program board. The vote came
after length) debate over a section of
the bill that would have given mem
bers of the senate the power to ap
point people to the board.
One COP veto, given to new Sen
ate Chair Carey White shortly before
the COP's term expired, canceled a
move which would have taken control
of the ASSU's $2,200 discretionary
fund from the COP and given it solely
to the senate chair and the financial
manager.
"The senate should be able to trust
the COP to utilize the funds in the
special discretionary line and to
assure the proper use of funds, fur
ther, the financial manager makes an
adequate check." outgoing COP

members David Porter, Todd Kerr
and Melissa Auchard said in the let
ter.
Porter argued that COP members
"arc elected officials of the student
body and should subsequently have
a voice allocating discretionary funds.
Outgoing Senate Chair Eric Berg
objected to the COP's use of its
power to veto senate legislation,
stating that "if the practice becomes
that the COP vetos every piece of
legislation they disagree with . . .
we re just going to have a crummy
year."
"I don't think that the COP should
be allowed to veto one paragraph of
the bill.' Berg said. "Essentially,
before this year, you have to go back
three years to find a veto."
I he issue was resolved shortly
before the meeting adjourned when
the senate approved Graduate
Senator Richard Beigel's proposal,
which gives the COP and the senate
chair the ability to allocate $1,100
each in discretionary funds, all under
the supervision of the financial
manager
The other veto involved a move
giving the senate editorial control of
the ASSU Pamphlet, a publication
issued each fall to incoming freshman
explaining the operations and func
tions of the student government. In
past years, the COP has been respon
sible for production of the publica
tion.
In their letter to White, the former
COP members stated that the
pamphlet "is a publication done over
the summer and logistically, it is diffi
cult to have a committee of the senate
watch over the process."
In addition, the COP argued that
"since publishing the ASSU
Pamphlet is purely an administrative

function, it is clearly a responsibility
of the COP. not the senate."
McGrath argued against the veto,
stating that there were "real mechan
ical problems" in some publications
issued in past years by the COP of
fice.
Berg called the fall 1983 issue of
the pamphlet "really unacceptable."
although he praised Porter's effort on
the 19H4 edition.
The veto was upheld by the senate,
with nine senators supporting the
COP's action and seven voting
against it.
McGrath's bill calling lor changes
in the current structure of the pro
gram board drew heated debate
before failing to receive a majority
vote of the senate.
Several senators, including Jeff
Soukup, objected to an item in

McGrath's hill stating that members
of the program board â– "shall be con
sidered nominated upon receiving the
support of five elected senators, pro
vided that there are more than 35
elected senators, or the support of
four elected senators, provided that
there are (fewer] than 36 elected
senators."
Soukup stated that the item gave
the senate too much authority in se
lection of board members, adding
that the present process of recogniz
ing recommendations made by the
nominations committee makes the
system less political and gives more
power to students outside the senate.
"The problem is not necessarily
v\ho is going to be on it. . . but the se
lection process," Soukup said
Porter, stating that "most of the bill
is done quite well," objected to the

proposed selection process, noting
that is creates "a whole hell of a lot of
problems."
"I really don't think you're going to
get less political appointments" with
McGrath's proposal. Porter said.
Former Senator Eugene Chen also
authored a petition stating that
McGrath's proposal is "an attempt by
certain senate members to accrue
more personal power in the funding
process" and "severly limit participa
tion of non-elected students in the
funding process."
Chen said McGrath's changes are
like "conducting open-heart surgery
with a chain saw."
McGrath countered that his pro
posal "gives the board substantially
more power than it has now."
