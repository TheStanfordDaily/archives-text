# COP cans two senate motions
## New senate upholds vetos News 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
In its lirst official action, the in
coming ASSU Senate last night up
held two vetoes issued late Tuesday
night by the outgoing Council of
Presidents (COP) on hills that affect
portions of the ASSU's operating
budget for the coming year.
I he new senate also rejected a pro
posal by Graduate Senator Jim
McGrath to reform the structure of
the program board. The vote came
after length) debate over a section of
the bill that would have given mem
bers of the senate the power to ap
point people to the board.
One COP veto, given to new Sen
ate Chair Carey White shortly before
the COP's term expired, canceled a
move which would have taken control
of the ASSU's $2,200 discretionary
fund from the COP and given it solely
to the senate chair and the financial
manager.
"The senate should be able to trust
the COP to utilize the funds in the
special discretionary line and to
assure the proper use of funds, fur
ther, the financial manager makes an
adequate check." outgoing COP

members David Porter, Todd Kerr
and Melissa Auchard said in the let
ter.
Porter argued that COP members
"arc elected officials of the student
body and should subsequently have
a voice allocating discretionary funds.
Outgoing Senate Chair Eric Berg
objected to the COP's use of its
power to veto senate legislation,
stating that "if the practice becomes
that the COP vetos every piece of
legislation they disagree with . . .
we re just going to have a crummy
year."
"I don't think that the COP should
be allowed to veto one paragraph of
the bill.' Berg said. "Essentially,
before this year, you have to go back
three years to find a veto."
I he issue was resolved shortly
before the meeting adjourned when
the senate approved Graduate
Senator Richard Beigel's proposal,
which gives the COP and the senate
chair the ability to allocate $1,100
each in discretionary funds, all under
the supervision of the financial
manager
