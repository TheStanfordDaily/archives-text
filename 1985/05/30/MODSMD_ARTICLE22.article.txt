# Goldie earns Pac-10 honors
## 
### 
Despite a late-season slump that
saw him lose his No. 1 national tennis
ranking, Stanford's Dan Goldie was
named the Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion Player of the Year yesterday.
Goldie. a junior from Mcl.ean.
Va.. compiled a 20-4 record in dual
matches (34-7 overall) while leading
the Cardinal to the NCAA cham
pionships this year. He has been
Stanford's No. 1 player and an Ail-
American for the last two seasons.
Goldie reached the No. 1 ranking
in February by soundly defeating
Georgia's Mikael Pernfors in the
finals of the ITCA National Individ
ual Indoor Championships, 6-3. 6-2.
He held onto the top position until

losing to Georgia's George Bezecny
in the quarterfinals of the NCAA in
dividual championships last weekend.
Before his loss to Be/ecny. who
eventually lost to Pernfors in the
singles final, there had been talk that
Goldie would turn professional alter
this season.
"If Dan had won the nationals,
there is a big possibility he would
have turned pro." said Hrie Rosen
feld. who teamed with Goldie to win
the Pac-10 doubles title in \pril.
As it now stands, however. Goldie
said he will definitely remain an
amateur over the summer and will
"probably play again ne\t year."
