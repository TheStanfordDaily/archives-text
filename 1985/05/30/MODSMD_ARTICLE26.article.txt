KZSU will air the most promising tracks from these albums tonight at 6
The rating scale is from one to Jive stars.

Toy Dolls — A Far Out Disc
Supertramp —
Brother Where You Bound
★ ★★★★★★ I/i (combined)
We got greedy and wanted to do
two last records, so here's our
"Rolling Stone Memorial Two-
Record-Reviews-in-One-Column
Writing Style" review medley.
You say the above two bands
have nothing in common? Perhaps,
to noninquiring minds. But think of
this: The Toy Dolls have
singlebandedly revitalized their
otherwise-dead genre (punk) with
their fusion of Monty Python and
Puppy Uppers. And Supertramp is
trying to rescue art rock's once
conceptual style from the throes of
the Alan Parsons Proj
ect/Contemporary Hit Radio com
plex which is conspiring to convert

Keith Jarrett —
Standards, Vol. 2 ★ ★ ★ V2
The classical critics love Keith Jar
rett's melodic feel and dislike his
playing in traditional passages, and
the jazz critics don't think he plays
standards very well. The first
volume of this release wasn't too
hot, but this one seems better done,
tighter and more coherent. Jarrett's
one composition on the record is,
oddly enough, its high point. "So
Tender" moves swiftly and power

fully behind Jack DeJohnette's
potent drums and Gary Peacock's
equally potent bass, with Jarrett
and Peacock turning in splendid,
shimmering solos. " Moon and
Sand" follows, slower and mel
lower than "So Tender," without
its potency, but with beautiful
playing from all again. The second
side is slower and quieter than the
first, opening with a pensive
"Never Let Me Go" before rocking
through "If I Should Lose You."

Everything But the Girl —
Love Sot Money ★ ★ ★
This is a very pleasant album.
And, if you are the kind of person

who is intrigued by, but scared of,
bands with strange names and
sounds to match, it could be your
type of album — adventurous in
appearance but fairly conventional
sounding. And this band's previous
release was quite popular in En
gland last year, so you can impress
your friends without straining your
musical tastes. However, "Love
Not Money" is considerably more
lively than that effort. The album
manages to combine the pretty vo
cals and sparkling instrumental
production — common to many
mediocre records — with studied
lyrics. The result is not just another
silly record but an album that is
both easy and rewarding to listen

1970s progressive rock into musical
Spam. What we have here are two
legitimate bands, see. The Toy
Dolls are probably the most
hilarious group around today —
this album comes complete with
theme songs, skit songs, commer
cials (for their debut album) and a
turbo-cover of the Surfaris' "Wipe
Out!" It's OK even if you don't get
the jokes; the TDs' music is good
enough to carry the record by itself.
But you say you've got no sense of
humor? That's OK, too. Super
tramp has lome along with a
serious and well-executed album
that might just make us forget
about its previous clunker,
"Famous Last Words." The vocals
are much better off without Roger
Hodgson (lead whiner on
"Breakfast in America" et al.), the

production is awesome, the instru
ments are powerful yet tasteful. So
there you have it. Two completely
different albums that reaffirm our
faith in popular music. Reaffirm
yours today!
— John Wallin
and Telford Work

Here DeJohnette shines in near
perfect trades with Jarrett, his
drums exploding with sound. "I
Fall In Love Too Easily" closes the
album quietly. So why don't I rate
this album higher? Why don't other
people rate his standards higher?
They are well played and quite lis
tenable performances of old tunes,
but they don't Jo anything. Jarrett's
playing is sharp, but he's not his
usual exploratory self.
— Andrew Shields

to. As seems to be the latest rage in
England, the band incorporates
many country sounds into its
smooth sound. This addition gives
the record texture; it catches the
listener's ear and causes him to pay
attention to songs that could other
wise slip by unnoticed. In a way,
this makes for a versatile album.
"Love Not Money" can be as en
gaging a listening experience as you
want to make it. You can either lis
ten passively while enjoying the
beverage of your choice and talking
to friends, or pay close attention to
the lyrics with your headphones on
— either course is modestly
rewarding.

rewarding.
