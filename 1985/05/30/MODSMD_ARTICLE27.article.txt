## Pryor funny in 'Brewster’s Millions,’ but film fizzles with moral conclusion 
### STEVE WARRICK 
"Brewster's Millions" has been
remade four or five times now, and
the idea of someone having to spend
$30 million in 30 days may not be as
appealing today as it was. in the 1920s
or '30s. The Pentagon and other big
corporations spend inconceivable
amounts of money every few minutes,
and everyone knows it; Americans
are jaded by the thought of billions of
dollars being poured into advertising
and debts and missiles. The idea be
hind this movie isn't bad — it just
isn't modern. Richard Pryor is one of
our most hip, modern actors, and
when I saw this movie advertised, I
dreaded another "Silver Streak" ex
perience, with Pryor trapped in an
old. old movie situation that suff
ocates him. Parts of "Brewster's Mil
lions" put Pryor in the same
straitjacket, and it's depressing to
watch him go through the tired plot
machinations of the decent little guy
up against the unscrupulous bigwigs.
But much of the screenplay, by Her
shel Weingrod and Timothy Hitrris,
gives Pryor just the loose, free
floating kind of material he needs; I
think it's his best movie since "Live
on the Sunset Strip."
Pryor is Monty Brewster, a pitcher
for a minor-league baseball team who
has dreams of playing major-league
ball. In the opening scene, Brewster
stands on the mound like a star; he's
keyed up, and he plays to the raucous
crowd. He singles out a beautiful
woman and throws each pitch for her,
and he obviously loves being center
stage. John Candy is Spike Nolan, the
catcher, and he's as much of a ham as
Brewster, but Nolan performs solely
for the opposing team. He talks fast
in amiable, not-too-bright guy chat
ter, but he's shrewd, and his style

shifts for each batter. Nolan can razz
his opponent mercilessly, or he can
soften him up and then nail him with
a zinger. Nolan and Brewster are
performers, so when Brewster falls
into his $30 million and begins spend
ing it wildly (he can't have any assets
at the end of 30 days if he is to inherit
$300 million), they know just how to
handle the attention, and they revel
in it.
Candy complements whoever he's
with, and I've liked him in every
screen appearance. His role here isn't
as good as it could be, bu* that's a
problem with the plot: Brewster can't
tell anyone the conditions of spending

Americans are jaded by
the thought of billions of
dollars being poured into debts and
missiles. The idea behind this movie
isn't bad — it just isn't modern.

the money, so Nolan is somewhat left
out of the situation, and at times
works against Brewster. But Nolan
deserves to know, because he's
Brewster's best friend and because
Candy is the only other major comic
force in the movie. Not letting him in
on the joke weakens their bond and
diffuses Candy's comic presence.
Richard Pryor, on the other hand,
is all there, and in the first three
quarters of the movie he holds back
only in the scenes with Lonette
McKee, who plays his accountant,
Angela. She has the thankless role of
a social conscience in this movie, and

when she lectures Brewster on the
evils of frivolous spending, he closes
himself off. We can see he's no longer
being crazy-shrewd, and he doesn't
want to hear this. Angela sabotages
whatever credibility she has early on
when she describes her fiance. War
ren (Stephen Collins), as sensitive
and socially concerned. When we
meet him, he's so obviously a brown
nosed. insincere worm that we can't
believe Brewster would continue to
go after Angela; there isn't a single
thing that connects their two per
sonalities.
As Brewster watches the tape of his
great-grandfather Rupert Horn

(Hume Cronyn) outlining the terms
of the inheritance, Pryor lets us see
every cog in Brewster's thought
processes. When Horn cackles,
"Betcha didn't think your great
grandpappy was a honky!" Brewster
shakes his head dumbly, but we can
see he already guesses what's going
on, and he's shifting mental gears. He
has to become more devious to play
Horn's game, and when he gets the
money, he comes up with ideas to
spend it at almost the same time we
do, so we get to share in his ingenuity.
Pryor adopts a rich honky guise, and
starts moving and talking with the

confidence of someone with lots of
money backing him up. Pryor can't go
as far with his part as he does in his
concert movies, hut this screenplay
keeps giving him new ways to spend
money; it keeps him inventive and us
interested.
The ideas get faster and funnier
when Brewster runs for political of
fice. He runs a slanderous, extrava
gant campaign that recalls the
hyperbolic, accelerated humor in
"Used Cars." But this section could
have gone on longer, and the movie
needs to keep building the way "Used
Cars" did. Pryor's energy level peaks
in his sly campaign ads, and then
fizzles out as the movie, in an almost
fatal miscalculation, tries to reach
some sort of moral conclusion. The
final party is a real bummer, with all
but a few of Brewster's friends aban
doning him because he's run out of
cash. We don't need this tired lesson,
and the tone of these scenes is too
heavy. (A shot of Brewster in a
drunken stupor sprawled on his
opulent bed recalls, of all things,
"Scarface.") Director Walter Hill's
("The Warriors," "48 Hrs.") fast
paced. energizing touch, which works
amazingly well in this light comedy,
atrophies in the final moments. At
the end, Pryor is surrounded by all of
the cardboard characters in the
movie, and his reactions seem to take
place in a vacuum. No one else in
these scenes comes close to his talent;
they need John Candy, but he's inex
plicably dropped in the last 10
minutes.
Pryor hasn't used his aggressive
black stance much recently; his atti
tudes have been absorbed by Eddie
Murphy, who was so aggressive in
"Beverly Hills Cop" that he was im
probable and clownish. In making

himself more sympathetic, Pryor is in
danger of going mushy; "Brewster's
Millions" pulls back into the Saturday
morning conventions of "Pryor's
Place," when the movie needs more
of the full-throttle satire we get in
Pryor's "Live in Concert." Both he

and Hill are talented enough tor it,
and I expected more of a dirty kick
out of a film from these two. But the
last 15 to 20 minutes enervate the au
dience, partly because they contain
the movie's take-home moral
message.

As Brewster watches the tape of his
great-grandfather Rupert Horn

(Hume Cronyn) outlining the terms
of the inheritance, Pryor lets us see
every cog in Brewster's thought
processes. When Horn cackles,
"Betcha didn't think your great
grandpappy was a honky!" Brewster
shakes his head dumbly, but we can
see he already guesses what's going
on, and he's shifting mental gears. He
has to become more devious to play
Horn's game, and when he gets the
money, he comes up with ideas to
spend it at almost the same time we
do, so we get to share in his ingenuity.
Pryor adopts a rich honky guise, and
starts moving and talking with the

confidence of someone with lots of
money backing him up. Pryor can't go
as far with his part as he does in his
concert movies, hut this screenplay
keeps giving him new ways to spend
money; it keeps him inventive and us
interested.
The ideas get faster and funnier
when Brewster runs for political of
fice. He runs a slanderous, extrava
gant campaign that recalls the
hyperbolic, accelerated humor in
"Used Cars." But this section could
have gone on longer, and the movie
needs to keep building the way "Used
Cars" did. Pryor's energy level peaks
in his sly campaign ads, and then
fizzles out as the movie, in an almost
fatal miscalculation, tries to reach
some sort of moral conclusion. The
final party is a real bummer, with all
but a few of Brewster's friends aban
doning him because he's run out of
cash. We don't need this tired lesson,
and the tone of these scenes is too
heavy. (A shot of Brewster in a
drunken stupor sprawled on his
opulent bed recalls, of all things,
"Scarface.") Director Walter Hill's
("The Warriors," "48 Hrs.") fast
paced. energizing touch, which works
amazingly well in this light comedy,
atrophies in the final moments. At
the end, Pryor is surrounded by all of
the cardboard characters in the
movie, and his reactions seem to take
place in a vacuum. No one else in
these scenes comes close to his talent;
they need John Candy, but he's inex
plicably dropped in the last 10
minutes.
Pryor hasn't used his aggressive
black stance much recently; his atti
tudes have been absorbed by Eddie
Murphy, who was so aggressive in
"Beverly Hills Cop" that he was im
probable and clownish. In making

himself more sympathetic, Pryor is in
danger of going mushy; "Brewster's
Millions" pulls back into the Saturday
morning conventions of "Pryor's
Place," when the movie needs more
of the full-throttle satire we get in
Pryor's "Live in Concert." Both he

and Hill are talented enough tor it,
and I expected more of a dirty kick
out of a film from these two. But the
last 15 to 20 minutes enervate the au
dience, partly because they contain
the movie's take-home moral
message.

"Brewster's Millions" has been
remade four or five times now, and
the idea of someone having to spend
$30 million in 30 days may not be as
appealing today as it was. in the 1920s
or '30s. The Pentagon and other big
corporations spend inconceivable
amounts of money every few minutes,
and everyone knows it; Americans
are jaded by the thought of billions of
dollars being poured into advertising
and debts and missiles. The idea be
hind this movie isn't bad — it just
isn't modern. Richard Pryor is one of
our most hip, modern actors, and
when I saw this movie advertised, I
dreaded another "Silver Streak" ex
perience, with Pryor trapped in an
old. old movie situation that suff
ocates him. Parts of "Brewster's Mil
lions" put Pryor in the same
straitjacket, and it's depressing to
watch him go through the tired plot
machinations of the decent little guy
up against the unscrupulous bigwigs.
But much of the screenplay, by Her
shel Weingrod and Timothy Hitrris,
gives Pryor just the loose, free
floating kind of material he needs; I
think it's his best movie since "Live
on the Sunset Strip."
Pryor is Monty Brewster, a pitcher
for a minor-league baseball team who
has dreams of playing major-league
ball. In the opening scene, Brewster
stands on the mound like a star; he's
keyed up, and he plays to the raucous
crowd. He singles out a beautiful
woman and throws each pitch for her,
and he obviously loves being center
stage. John Candy is Spike Nolan, the
catcher, and he's as much of a ham as
Brewster, but Nolan performs solely
for the opposing team. He talks fast
in amiable, not-too-bright guy chat
ter, but he's shrewd, and his style

shifts for each batter. Nolan can razz
his opponent mercilessly, or he can
soften him up and then nail him with
a zinger. Nolan and Brewster are
performers, so when Brewster falls
into his $30 million and begins spend
ing it wildly (he can't have any assets
at the end of 30 days if he is to inherit
$300 million), they know just how to
handle the attention, and they revel
in it.
Candy complements whoever he's
with, and I've liked him in every
screen appearance. His role here isn't
as good as it could be, bu* that's a
problem with the plot: Brewster can't
tell anyone the conditions of spending

Americans are jaded by

isn't bad — it just isn't modern.

the money, so Nolan is somewhat left
out of the situation, and at times
works against Brewster. But Nolan
deserves to know, because he's
Brewster's best friend and because
Candy is the only other major comic
force in the movie. Not letting him in
on the joke weakens their bond and
diffuses Candy's comic presence.
Richard Pryor, on the other hand,
is all there, and in the first three
quarters of the movie he holds back
only in the scenes with Lonette
McKee, who plays his accountant,
Angela. She has the thankless role of
a social conscience in this movie, and

when she lectures Brewster on the
evils of frivolous spending, he closes
himself off. We can see he's no longer
being crazy-shrewd, and he doesn't
want to hear this. Angela sabotages
whatever credibility she has early on
when she describes her fiance. War
ren (Stephen Collins), as sensitive
and socially concerned. When we
meet him, he's so obviously a brown
nosed. insincere worm that we can't
believe Brewster would continue to
go after Angela; there isn't a single
thing that connects their two per
sonalities.
