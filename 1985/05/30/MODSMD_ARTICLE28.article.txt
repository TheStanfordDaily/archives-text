# Modern Romance's 'Burn It!' just plain bad
## 
### ANDREW CROWELL 
Question: What do you get when
you cross Duran Duran, the Bee
Gees and Madonna's drumulator?
Answer: Modern Romance's new
album, "Burn it!"
Sounds pretty pathetic, huh? Well,
it is. In fact, this album goes against
just about everything I stand for in
music. The exclamation point is really
included in the album title; I kid you

not. Included on the shrink wrap is an
advertisement for a collector's edi
tion, Modern Romance "Burn It
Love Mug" available only through
mail order. Amazing. Simply
amazing. But it is not a joke.
Who are these supply-siders and
what are their credentials? Modern
Romance is a five-piece English band
formed in 1980 by David Jaymes and
Geoffrey Deane. I am told that
Deane "led the band through its early
chart successes, then departed in
1982 to go solo." The group boasts
silver disc awards in England for its
singles "Best Years of Our Lives"
and "Walking in the Rain," the latter
also reaching No. 1 in Thailand.
Romance's "Adventures in
Clubland" album even went gold in
Venezuela. In case you're really out
of it and haven't heard of any of the
above, you certainly will remember
Romance's 1981 international dance
hit "Everybody Salsa."
The controversy over the band's
recent signing to RCA has no doubt
had many loyal Modern Romance

fans worried that Mullins, D. Jaymes,
P. Gendler, A. Kyriacou and R.
Jaymes are compromising their musi
cal integrity with this "sell-out"
move. Well, Modern Romance fans,
you have nothing to fear. They didn't:
They're still selling out, and if you
liked these guys before, you probably
still will. The band's press release
would tend to argue with my stance.
It assures that, "While the album is
sure to retain Modern Romance's in
terational appeal, it goes beyond the
lighthearted pop of the group's ear
lier work and shows greater musical
variety and sophistication." If RCA
does not consider this album
lighthearted pop, I'd be stunned. The
international appeal is simple: This is
blatant commercialism at its best (or
worst); I think this album is going to
have a tough time getting airplay
anywhere.
The title cut to "Burn It!" is so
monotonous it isn't even laughable. I
was reminded of the time some of my
friends got really bored and counted
the number of repetitions of the five

note bass line in "Thriller." (H7 was
the final consensus, 1 think.) Well, I
stopped counting "Burn It!" 's at 50,
and the song was only about half
over. That's not all; there is even a
"Burn It! (Reprise)" at the end of the
album. I don't even want to know
what the total count would be, but
I'm sure it puts even "Wild Boys" to
shame. The band's effort to establish
some sort of contrasting theme — its
cover shows the Romance boys
playing in the snow — just does not
work.
"Keep A Candle Burning" is a
weak attempt at an inspiring song.
"That's Entertainment" would make
the makers of the film of that same
name sorry they ever thought up the
title, and "That's What Friends Arc
For" is a humorously mindless dis
play of the meaning of friendship.
If I haven't made it absolutely clear
by now, I will tell you straighf: This is
commercial, boring and just plain
bad. I'd be surprised if even KYUU
plays much of "Burn It!"
