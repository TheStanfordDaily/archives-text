# Information cuts draw protest
## 
### MARK A. LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
Librarians at Stanford and across
the nation arc lobbying against a
Reagan administration proposal to
cut back the amount of government
information gathered and dis
seminated to the public.
Carol Anne Turner, chief of gov
ernment documents at the Jonsson
Library of Government Documents
here, said the proposal, outlined in
the March 15 issue of the Federal
Register, calls lor limiting the amount
ol information gathered and dis
tributed by the federal government,
at the expense of the public's right to
know what is happening in Washing
ton. D.C.
The Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) has been accepting
public suggestions about the proposal
since March 15 hut will end the com
ment period Saturday. Turner said
she expects a congressional decision

on the document "probably within
the next two months."
The Stanford library of govern
ment documents would lie especially
hurt by a cutback in government ma
terials. Turner said. The library is one
of two in the 12th congressional dis
trict serving as a Federal Depository
Library, a facility that receives free
government documents for public
use. Every district nationwide has two
such libraries.
I he American Library Association
(ALA), a group that rarely involves
itself in political issues, has been lob
bying congressmen and the OMB, en
couraging them to oppose the pro
posal.
"We're hoping that library users
will also write," Turner said. "It's
really important for people . . . who
just want to know what's going on."
While she sees some value in the
government's effort to reduce un
necessary paperwork, she said that

the proposal represents the violation
of an American "fundamental princi
ple."
"There is a basic principle here of
access to government information we
have to be concerned about," she
said. The government's concern
about efficiency "is really good, but
what's scary is cutting back on infor
mation."
The proposal in the Federal Regis
ter states that "because creation or
collection of information requires al
location of scarce resources, agencies
must economize on such activi
ties. . . . Before creating or collecting
new information, agencies should
look first to other agencies and the
private sector in order to satisfy their
needs."
I lie proposal goes on to say. "The
mere fact that an agency has created
or collected information is not itself a
valid reason for creating a program to
disseminate the information to the

public. Agencies create and collect
much information, often for purely
internal governmental purposes, that
is not intended for dissemination, for
which there is no public demand and
the dissemination of which would
serve 110 public purpose and would
not be cost-justified."
A letter submitted to the OMB by
the American Libraries Association
(ALA) states, however, that the pro
posal. if implemented, "will ac
celerate the current trend toward the
commercialization and privatization
of government information."
The letter contends that "the entire
thrust of this document reduces the
accountability of government to its
citizens."
In a recent speech, ALA President
E.J. Josey said, "Only the preserva
tion ol public services, publicly sup
ported. can assure that each individ
ual has equal and ready access to in
formation," according to the letter.
