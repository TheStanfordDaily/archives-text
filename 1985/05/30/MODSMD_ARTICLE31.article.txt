## A
						look at the new senate chair 
### XAVIER BRIAND 
Communication Prof. Elie Abel
likes to write books, but that will
have to wait.
Abel, a former foreign correspon
dent for The New York Times and
NBC News, plans to write a book
next year— but not until he finishes
his term as chair of the Faculty Sen
ate, a post to which he was elected
last month.
The 64-year-old Ahel is no
stranger to the senate. Last fall, as a
senator, he spearheaded the suc
cessful effort to open senate
meetings to outside media. Previ
ously, only campus news organiza
tions were allowed to cover the
meetings.
While the 66-member senate
lacks the clout of the University
president or provost, Abel said, "It
provides an arena for fairly high
level discussions of University issues
and, from that point of view, it's
worthwhile. If the senate takes a
stand on an issue, the administra
tion's bound to take it into ac
count."
Abel said he will take a long
awaited sabbatical after completing
a three-year stint as chairman of the
Communication Department next
year. During the break, he plans to
write a book.
"The most satisfying thing to me
is writing books," he said in an in
terview recently, "and I think that is
one reason l left active journalism."
Abel has previously written several
books on national politics and jour
nalism.
The prize-winning reporter and
broadcaster said he finds it "harder
and harder to enjoy reading
newspapers, partly because the big
news is so repetitive. How many
more stories can I read about civil
warfare in Lebanon? Who's blowing
up whom?"
Married and the father of two
grown children, the Palo Alto resi
dent said that being a foreign corre
spondent is a young man's game.
"Journalism is not an easy profes
sion in which to grow old," he said.
"I found it an exciting life as a corre
spondent, but the time comes when
you're not that eager to go racing
around the world. .. . Most of the
people doing that kind of work are
in their 30s and 405." Abel left ac
tive journalism for teaching when he

was 48.
Born in Montreal. Abel
graduated from McGill University
with a bachelor's degree in 1941 and
received a master's degree in jour
nalism from Columbia in 1942.
While a print reporter, he served as
a foreign correspondent for the
North American Newspaper Al
liance and The New York Times,
and as Washington bureau chief of
the Detroit News.
As reporter for NBC News, he
was chief of the London bureau and
diplomatic correspondent. He has
won the George Foster Peahody
Award and two Overseas Press Club
Awards, in addition to receiving
honorary LL.D. degrees from
McGill and the University of West
ern Ontario.
Prior to moving to Stanford in
1979, Abel served nine years as
dean and professor at the Graduate
School of Journalism at Columbia,
"an unhappy place in my time," he
recalled. He said the faculty was bit
terly divided over issues like the
Vietnam War and university re
search funded by the Department of
Defense. "Personal relations were
badly affected," he said.
As a professor of communication,
Abel looks for "quality of writing
combined with the ability to do
careful research" in his students,
"which doesn't leave (them) a lot of
time for theorizing."
Abel is troubled that many stu
dents, undergraduates in particular,
"do not write well, and probably
haven't read enough, either." Abel
said he grew up in a "reading gener
ation. There wasn't any TV when I
was a kid — probably a good thing."
Of the journalists he has worked
with over the years, Abel most
admires James Res ton, Walter
Lippmann and Edward R. Murrow,
all of whom he met "while they were
still active." Among today's jour
nalists, Abel has high regard for one
of his former students — Richard
Smith, editor in chief of Newsweek.
"I think one of the satisfactions of
teaching journalists is to see at least
some of them emerge as fairly
leading figures in the field," he said,
recalling that Smith moonlighted as
a cab driver to support his wife and
son.
"He's a winner, no question about

that," Abel said.
Abel considers novelist John
Updike one of his favorite writers.
"To say he's a novelist is diminish
ing him a little bit, because he's also
a significant critic and writes inter
esting poetry as well," he said.
"He's a man of letters, in the old
fashioned sense."
Nobel Prize-winning author
Gabriel Garcia Marquez is also a fa
vorite. "There is a whole group of
fascinating Latin American writers,
and somehow I'm less aware of

European writers of the new
breed," he said. "I'm sure they're
there, but they don't seem to be
making the same kind of impact."
Abel worked with Marquez while
the two served on the UNESCO In
ternational Commission for the
Study of Communication Problems
from 1977 to 1979.
Abel is a sharp critic of television
news, which "tries to cover in 22
minutes all that there is to cover. In
words, that's less than half of a

newspaper page." At the same time,
he noted that TV covers
"spectacles" — political conven
tions, men on the moon, funerals of
presidents — in ways that
newspapers cannot.
The famine in East Africa is a
case in point, he said. Both The New
York Times and The Washington
Post focused relatively limited at
tention on the famine until October
1984, when NBC News aired some
footage taken by a BBC reporter in
Ethiopia.
