## Gregory McDonald coughs up the '60s 
### The Education of Gregory McDonald" By Gregory McDonald Warner Books, 234 pp., $7. 95 
It's hard to he a child of the '60s
revisionism generation.
At the same time all these coming
of-age concepts — radicalism,
feminism, sex, drugs and/or rock and
roll — are finally beginning to solidify
in my consciousness, a lot of people in
their mid-40s are attempting to re
examine their own comings-of-age.
Many of the people who ran the show
in the '60s (and early '70s), from
David Harris to Richard Nixon, are
raising their voices again.
Some, like Gregory McDonald, are
coughing up what they said 20 years
ago, anthology-style. McDonald, who
wrote for The Boston Globe between
1966 and 1973, has compiled articles,
columns and interviews under the
title "The Education Of Gregory
McDonald."
McDonald prefaces his collection
with a collection of generalizations
about the '60s that seems unneces
sary; the '60s, he says, was not just a

McDonald on John Wayne: 'He kept looking into this pool, this walking
mountain of a man hesitating with his tequila, trusting me to realize ... his
mountain-high concern, his caring, for this country that somehow . . . puts him
in the middle and makes him zero with anyone who went to college. . . . '

youth movement but a cultural move
ment, television has a big effect, and
the essential goals of the '60s have
not been realized. It would seem that
anyone interested in a book of this
nature would already know this stuff.
In his introduction, McDonald
asserts that the '60s were "not a time
of great men, but of great people."
The great people in this book include
'60s landmarks, such as Jack
Kerouac, Joan Baez and names less
known to me such as Swami philoso
pher Krishnamurti. There are some
Wolfey pieces about culture in gen
eral, but they seem less focused and
effective than the essay portraits.
Let me say here that the book is

definitely entertaining, what you'd
call a "good read." And if you, like
me, happened to be unconceived
while McDonald was writing, there's
bound to be something new on these
pages, maybe even valuable.
An appealing thing about the book
is it's immediacy. Because the articles
were written on the spot, there's an
honesty about them that eludes many
works written later. McDonald
doesn't have Nixon's option of,
"When I said that, what l meant
was. ..."
However, it's disturbing that the
articles aren't dated, and often their
composition suggests or insists that
they've been either revised or

postscripted in indiscernible places.
An article about Kerouac mentions,
toward the end, that Kerouac died 14
months after the interview. I don't
think McDonald would have waited
14 months to publish; does this mean
that the comment was added on, or
ihat the whole thing is a
remembrance?
McDonald's coy approach to his
subjects is sometimes effective,
sometimes trite, sometimes
amusingly sacrilegious. McDonald is
the archetypal journalistic liberal,
believing in no cultural icons, attack
ing them either goodnaturedly or
moralistically. In pieces such as his
merciless attack on Tiny Tim, you get

the feeling that McDonald isn't truly
indignant, that he believes that un
derneath it all it's just tun and games.
Some of his columns, like
"Youngbodies," seem a bit disdain
ful, and it's hard to read behind the
sneer. They read like a combination
of Tom Wolfe and Soap Opera
Digest.
Sometimes you get the feeling that
McDonald isn't giving his topic
(victim?) a chance: that he ap
proaches a subject with so many
preconceived ideas that he'll as
semble all possible damning evidence
to prove a point. Often, in his or
chestration to get his message across,
the personality of the subject gets dis-

torted — overwhelmed — by
McDonald's intentions. He paints a
picture of John Wayne as. well, a
macho idiot, and when he says:
He kept looking into this pool, this
walking mountain of a man hesitating
with his tequila, trusting me to realize,
I suppose, waiting on me to see behind
this indiscretion his mountain-high
concern, his caring, for this country
that somehow, asking him questions,
Gee whiz, puts him in the middle and
makes him zero with anyone who went
to college or can sir.g the "Small
Hotel'' song.
You feel he's pushing the point.
I suppose that my biggest problem
with McDonald's "Education" is that
I'm much more interested in the sub
jects of McDonald's work than in his
views on them. Time has distorted
many of the characters and conditions
in this book; I can't see the people for
myself, so I get uneasy when I feel
McDonald has distorted them, way
back then.
