"Fathers: Reflections by Daughters"
Edited by Ursula Owen
Pantheon Books, 239 pp., $7.95
When I first picked up this book. I thought I'd read it
and not muss the pages, then sock it away for a Father's
Day present. I he cutesy cover and the known writers who
wrote the articles were bound to appeal to my father, who
likes cute and is currently writing the great American
novel somewhere in western New Jersey.
I hen I read it. And crumpled pages rereading it. made
overenthusiastie marginalia, dog eared sections. By the
time I was done reading the book. I felt almost as if I'd
written it. So much of it was about my father. And about
me.
"l athers: Reflections by Daughters" is a collection of
essays by members of the literati about fathers. Most are
about the writers' own fathers, though one is about
"Elizabeth Barret Browning's Father," and one about
"Our Father" (Freud).
The daughters range in age from 15 to 50. Manv of
them are English: the book was first released in En
gland. I heir fathers are gentlemen, lunatics, bigots and
war heros. too loving, not loving enough or simply not
there.
I he great thing about this book is that, somehow,
through an incredibly disparate selection of fathers and
daughters, it manages to make a coherent, universally
valid statement about fatherhood. Though each of the
daughters has a slightly different view of fathers and fath
erhood, the conflicting views reflect the conflicting
feelings I suspect every child has about her parents.
There are three main types of essays in this anthology;
some, such as Alice Munro's "Working for a living," read
like straight biography, and the author rarely, if ever,
mentions herself. Others, such as "Sugar Daddy" by An
gela Carter, deal with the relationship between father and
daughter, rather than focusing on either individual. A
third, such as Dinah Brooke's "An Obsession Revisited,"
tells the daughter's story; the father is described mainly in
terms of his influence on the writer's life, and he is often
ephemeral or surreal.
Much attention is paid to the connection between one's
"real" father and the father a daughter creates inside her
head. Brooke writes that her father was "just a screen for
me to have mad daughterly fantasies about." In "What
Good Times We All Had Then," Doris I.essing seems to
regret that she saw her parents as more illusory than real:
"We use our parents like recurring dreams, to be entered
into when needed, they are always there for love and hate,
but it occurs to me that I was not always there for my
father." Many of the writers describe the long, painful
process of reconciling the image of a father that they had
created with the actual man.
In "David." Mary Gordon describes her internal
struggle after discovering an anti-Semitic manuscript that
her father had written that makes her question whether he
was. in fact, an "evil" man. Her husband suggests that he
was "mad" when writing it; she is comforted, yet asserts,
"In this question I was my father's daughter and he would
have called interpreting something possibly evil as neu

rotic to be one of the pusillanimous evasions of our cen
tury."
Another experience discussed in "Fathers*" is a
daughter's attempt to live up to her father's expectations.
Here the roles are reversed: daughters have to become
the people the fathers fantasize (or expect) they will
become. When they don't, the result can be devastating.
In "Split at the Root." Adrienne Rich writes about the
tradeoff women often feel they make between indepen
dence and love. "I wanted him to cherish and approve of
me not as he had when I was a child, but as the woman I
was, who had her own mind, and had made her own
choices. This. I finally realized, was not to be." In "The
Man in the Orange Box," Eileen Fairweather writes.
"The conflict is deceptively simple. You long to be free
and to be loved. When the first man in your life teaches
you that the two are irreconcilable, the price of freedom
can seem impossibly high."

I thought I'd read it and not
muss the pages, then sock it
away for a Father's Day
present. ... By the time I
was done reading the book,
I felt almost as if I d written
it. So much of it was about
my father. And about me.

Many of these women are self-described feminists, and
they discuss not only father as father, but father as man.
Often the man in the father is grudgingly or bitterly ac
knowledged. Fairweather writes, in retrospect, of her
father's chauvinism: "At my father's knee I was exposed
to the full range of male prejudices, stripped bare of any
chivalrous gloss."
Rose Rider, an incest victim, seems to assert that any
good a father might do is often obscured by his maleness.
"Domination." she writes, "is in the patriarchal blood; it
passes from man to man as blood bond and blood vic
tory."
Rider's essay, with the exception of a two-pager by the
daughter of the anthology's editor, is the bitterest and
least distant of the group, and the hardest to interpet. As a
whole, however, the daughters in "Fathers" are eloquent,
graceful and even haunting in their reflections. After
reading "Fathers," daughters (and fathers and mothers
and sons) will probably have a lot on their minds. As
Owen says in her introduction, "There's a lot to be read in
between the lines. This is only a beginning."
