## Seniors asked to hold back pledges Petitioners link divestment, donations 
### MARK A. LAWRENCE Senior staff writer 
Fight seniors have drafted a peti
tion asking students anil alumni to
withhold donations to the Univer
sity until it changes its investment
policy and adopts what the groups
calls a firm stand on apartheid.
About 400 students and alumni
have signed the petition since or
gani/ers began circulating it on Mav
I 5. the day after Stanford's Board
of I rustees decided not to vote for
total divestment of University
stocks in companies that do business
in South Africa, according to Eric
I ajer. one of the petition or
ganizers.
By asking potential donors to
withhold gilts to the University, or
ganizers say they are hoping to show
their outrage at what they call a lack
of action by the trustees and to put
pressure on them to consider some
form of divestment in future
meetings.
David Fulton, director of commu
nications and deputy to the vice
president of development for the
University, would not comment on
how effective the petition could be
in causing alumni to withhold their
donations.
Between 70 and HO percent of the
signees are students, because so few
alumni live on campus, according to

Derek Passarelli. another organizer
of the petition.
Passarelli said that, since they
started, the sponsors of the petition
have been soliciting signatures at a
table in White Plaza, going door to
door and distributing flyers around
campus.
The organizers plan to concen
trate their efforts on the senior class
during the three weeks before Com
mencement by circulating the form
at several senior functions, accord
ing to Russell Poore. another organ
izer.
"We're urging people not to
donate until Stanford does some
thing that individuals consider
morally right," according to Pas
sarelli. "The thrust of it is that there
are people who are just not happy
with what happened at the trustees'
meeting. We don't know how much
impact it's going to have, but we're
using whatever economic impact we
do have.
"We were terribly disappointed
by the lack of action by the trustees.
We wish they would act in a moral
way. It's something we didn't want
to do if Stanford showed a firm
commitment to oppose apartheid,"
Passarelli added.
Fajer said that only about 20 per
cent of those approached with the
petition have been willing to sign.

He said that he believes students are
unwilling to withhold money from
the University because they believe
Stanford does many good things. In
addition, many students who are on
financial aid feel an obligation to
pay the University back, he said.
"People figure the University is
doing a lot of good things — no
argument there." said Fajer.
"We're just making the statement
that we expect more from Stanford.
We're not expecting Stanford to be
perfect, but we're asking them to
correct a known fault."
Although there are members of
Stanford Out of South Africa
(SOSA) among the organizers of
the petition, it is not sponsored bv
SOSA and does not specifically
espouse total divestment, according
to Fa jer.
"The petition was created to try
to unite a broad group of students
who are opposed to Stanford's in
vestments." Fajer said. The group
unites people who espouse total
divestment with people who support
partial divestment "to say, 'I ley, we
don't like this." "
"We're just some seniors who are
disappointed and want the Univer
sity to take a stand at the next trus
tee meeting," Passarelli said.
Organizers are unsure how they
will continue the petition after

Commencement on June 16. when
many will graduate. Poore said that
two of the eight sponsors will return
to Stanford next year as co-terminal
graduate students, but he added.
"We're hoping to pass it down to
underclassmen.
"It's not really clear what the next
step is." Poore said. "But obviously
we want to keep going until the
University does something accep
table. Hopefully, with all the things
students are doing, it will make a
difference."
Poore said that organizers
welcome suggestions that they
should adopt a program for with
holding donations like that devised
two years ago by Harvard students.
In 1983. students at Harvard es
tablished the Endowment for
Divestiture, a fund to which stu
dents and alumni can contribute
money that will go to Harvard if it
divests before the year 2003. ac
cording to Mike Hirschorn of the
Harvard Crimson. If the school does
not divest by that year, the money
will go to charity.
Poore said that organizers of the
Stanford petition are unsure if they
are headed in a similar direction,
but he said, "Whatever outlet we
can find to help the cause is fine —
it's up to the individual."
