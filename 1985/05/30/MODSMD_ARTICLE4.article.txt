### DEBORAH KEHLE Staff writer 
"I don't think an act of civil dis
obedience has very much meaning it
the first response to it is to issue am
nesty. Hither you're making a state
ment. or \ou're not." University
President Donald Kennedy said yes
terday. referring to the arrests l ues
da) of nine students protesting Stan
ford's investments in companies that
do business in South Africa.
Speaking to 20 people at Murray
House. Kennedy contrasted the civil
disobedience of the students, who
were arrested at the Bursar's Office
and charged with trespassing and un
lawful assembly, with other pro
divestment protests here this spring.
"It was clear that this group (the nine
students) wanted to make a stronger
statement."' Kennedv said after the
discussion.
When asked if the University
would press charges against the stu
dents, Kennedy that wasn't Stan
fords decision. "The prosecutorial
discretion is entirely in the hands of
'he distriet attorney." he said.
Kennedy reiterated his opposition
,(> total divestment, saving he feels it

is a had idea to "give up the lev erage"
of economic involvement with South
Africa. He suggested that such in
volvement could be used productively
as a means of exerting pressure on the
Pretoria government.
Kennedy was asked if the trustees'
reluctance to divest is linked to a fear
of losing corporate contributions to
the University. While stressing he
could not speak for the trustees. Ken
nedv said some university presidents
and trustees worry about this ques
tion. "I think there are other good
reasons for not favoring divestment."
he said.
Questions then turned to expan
sion and new construction, which
Kennedy suggested may become per
petual processes on campus. He said,
however, that "I wish it would stop I
don't want the crane to become the
University bird.
The session was the last in a series
of meetings between Kennedy and
the members of various residences,
sponsored by Residential Fducation.
When asked what he got out of the
sessions. Kennedy said. "I learned
that I don't do very well sitting 111 an
office and waiting for problems to
come to me."
