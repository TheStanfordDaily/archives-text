# Experts differ on tax reform
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Staff writer 
Economics professors here are giving mixed
reviews to President Reagan's tax reform package,
announced to the public Tuesday night.
Economics Prof. Ronald McKinnon. director of
the C enter for Research in Economic Growth, said
the planned lower tax rates would yield "long-term
benefits, but will not give any immediate
(economic) boost.
"The scheme is not entirely fiscally responsible."
McKinnon said. " I he stated interest of cleaning up
the tax system and broadening the (tax) base isn't
being achieved."
Economics Prof. Michael Boskin said the plan is
better than the original Treasury Department pro
posal. but "still has a long way to go."
I strongly favor the general idea of lowering the
rates and broadening the tax base." Boskin said.
" I nfortunatelv. [the plan | is too anti-investmcnt in
character."
I he plan would discourage domestic investment
while encouraging consumption and overseas in*
vestment. Boskin said. The net result would be to
worsen the trade deficit. He said corporate taxes
are relatively high now compared to personal taxes,
which have been reduced in the last few years.
Economics Prof. Roger Noll called the plan "an
elaborate attempt to do things that don't matter
much, while missing the big-ticket items.
"From what I can tell, there was a political cal
culation made." Noll said. "It still retains a little bit
of the goodies for everybody. It's not a big enough
reduction to qualify as major tax reform."
The possibility of increasing the budget deficit is
also a concern. Boskin said. "It this plan were im
plemented. I think it will raise less revenue than the
Ireasury forecasts. Boskin said. "I am very con
cerned about increasing the deficit inadvertantly."
Noll echoed Boskin's concern about the Trea

sury Department forecasts. "The revenue impact
estimates are wrong because they underestimate
the strategic response to the (new) system." Noll
said.
I he administration based its calculations on the
current system, and taxpayers would change their
investment strategies under the new proposal. Noll
said.
McKinnon said the plan fails to close several
existing loopholes and creates two new ones, tui
tion tax credits and enterprise zones. He warned
that the plan might well increase the budget deficit,
as the tax base would not be broad enough to sup
port existing expenditures.
Lowering the tax rate, raising the personal ex
emption level and broadening the tax base would
be a better solution. McKinnon said.
"I think revenue considerations are very impor
tant. McKinnon said. "All transfer payments
should be brought into the tax base, then given
generous basic exemptions at the bottom (income
level)."
Boskin said lower tax rates will decrease the
benefits gained by investing in tax shelters. "It
makes much more sense to have a very broad
based tax with low rates." lie said.
Boskin said lie prefers "junking" the personal
and corporate income taxes in favor of a
"consumcd-incomc or value-added tax that would
encourage savings.
Noll, a staff member of the Council of Economic
Advisers during the Johnson administration, said
the plan does not do enough to eliminate "fringe
benefits' such as hidden business deductions.
"The only big thing they did was eliminate the
deductability of state and local taxes." Noll said.
"The action is in fringe benefits. What you want to
do is institute a reform that makes the value of the
fringe benefits decrease."
Boskin said the elimination of loopholes or

preferences would be diiticult because of pressure
on Congress to maintain these allowances.
"Most of the so-called tax preferences were put
in for allegedly noble purposes." Boskin said, "I
think any proposal which gets rid of most of the
preferences we have now w ill bring increased pres
sure for direct outlays as a consequence."
Boskin saiil these outlays could take the form of
direct government subsidies or tax allowances.
I he key part is to think about the spending and
the tax sides at the same time."
The people who will most clearly benefit from
the plan are those in the low income brackets. Bos
kin said. The plan calls for nearly doubling the per
sonal income tax exemption, from SI."SO to
$2,000.
Bill fivers, a graduate student 111 political science
and past chairman of the I ihertarian Party of Cali
fornia. said he prefers cutting rates under the cur
rent tax system to the Reagan plan as a wa\ of com
batting government expenditure.
"I approve of loopholes (and) tax credits and ex
panding them, because it gives taxpayers more
fronts on which they can push taxes lower." Facts
said.
Fivers said the Reagan plan, coupled with "more
intensive | Internal Revenue Service| investigation
efforts." was also an effort to tax more of the
"underground economy" of unreported income
and transactions.
Both Boskin and Noll said they doubt Reagan's
proposal will pass Congress as written. "I think
there is very little chance that this plan will pass
without substantial modification." Boskin said.
"It's hard to pass something this sweeping."
"There's absolutely no chance the Reagan pro
posal will be enacted.' Noll said. "There's going to
be a lot of sound and fury, but the most likelv result

while encouraging consumption and overseas in*
vestment. Boskin said. The net result would be to
worsen the trade deficit. He said corporate taxes
are relatively high now compared to personal taxes,
which have been reduced in the last few years.
Economics Prof. Roger Noll called the plan "an
elaborate attempt to do things that don't matter
much, while missing the big-ticket items.
"From what I can tell, there was a political cal
culation made." Noll said. "It still retains a little bit
of the goodies for everybody. It's not a big enough
reduction to qualify as major tax reform."
The possibility of increasing the budget deficit is
also a concern. Boskin said. "It this plan were im
plemented. I think it will raise less revenue than the
Ireasury forecasts. Boskin said. "I am very con
cerned about increasing the deficit inadvertantly."
Noll echoed Boskin's concern about the Trea

sury Department forecasts. "The revenue impact
estimates are wrong because they underestimate
the strategic response to the (new) system." Noll
said.
I he administration based its calculations on the
current system, and taxpayers would change their
investment strategies under the new proposal. Noll
said.
McKinnon said the plan fails to close several
existing loopholes and creates two new ones, tui
tion tax credits and enterprise zones. He warned
that the plan might well increase the budget deficit,
as the tax base would not be broad enough to sup
port existing expenditures.
Lowering the tax rate, raising the personal ex
emption level and broadening the tax base would
be a better solution. McKinnon said.
"I think revenue considerations are very impor
tant. McKinnon said. "All transfer payments
should be brought into the tax base, then given
generous basic exemptions at the bottom (income
level)."
Boskin said lower tax rates will decrease the
benefits gained by investing in tax shelters. "It
makes much more sense to have a very broad
based tax with low rates." lie said.
Boskin said lie prefers "junking" the personal
and corporate income taxes in favor of a
"consumcd-incomc or value-added tax that would
encourage savings.
Noll, a staff member of the Council of Economic
Advisers during the Johnson administration, said
the plan does not do enough to eliminate "fringe
benefits' such as hidden business deductions.
"The only big thing they did was eliminate the
deductability of state and local taxes." Noll said.
"The action is in fringe benefits. What you want to
do is institute a reform that makes the value of the
fringe benefits decrease."
Boskin said the elimination of loopholes or

preferences would be diiticult because of pressure
on Congress to maintain these allowances.
"Most of the so-called tax preferences were put
in for allegedly noble purposes." Boskin said, "I
think any proposal which gets rid of most of the
preferences we have now w ill bring increased pres
sure for direct outlays as a consequence."
Boskin saiil these outlays could take the form of
direct government subsidies or tax allowances.
I he key part is to think about the spending and
the tax sides at the same time."
The people who will most clearly benefit from
the plan are those in the low income brackets. Bos
kin said. The plan calls for nearly doubling the per
sonal income tax exemption, from SI."SO to
$2,000.
Bill fivers, a graduate student 111 political science
and past chairman of the I ihertarian Party of Cali
fornia. said he prefers cutting rates under the cur
rent tax system to the Reagan plan as a wa\ of com
batting government expenditure.
"I approve of loopholes (and) tax credits and ex
panding them, because it gives taxpayers more
fronts on which they can push taxes lower." Facts
said.
Fivers said the Reagan plan, coupled with "more
intensive | Internal Revenue Service| investigation
efforts." was also an effort to tax more of the
"underground economy" of unreported income
and transactions.
Both Boskin and Noll said they doubt Reagan's
proposal will pass Congress as written. "I think
there is very little chance that this plan will pass
without substantial modification." Boskin said.
"It's hard to pass something this sweeping."
"There's absolutely no chance the Reagan pro
posal will be enacted.' Noll said. "There's going to
be a lot of sound and fury, but the most likelv result
is notliimi
