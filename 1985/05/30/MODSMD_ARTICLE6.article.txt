Shiites attack Palestinian camp
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Shiite Moslem militiamen and armored units of
a mainly Shiite army unit pounded a Palestinian refugee camp on
Beirut's southern edge with mortars and tank fire yesterday, and 13
shells hit Beirut airport, officials said.
Meanwhile, Beirut radio stations said President Amin Gemayel was
preparing to go to the Sy riun capital of Damascus to ask President Hafez
Assad for Syrian military intervention to stop the fighting.
The shells exploded on the airport tarmac as passengers hoarded a
flight hound for Europe, civil aviation sources said. The passengers
sprinted back to the terminal, and there were no reports of casualties.
Palestinians responded to the Shiite assault on Bourj el-Barajneh
camp with machine guns and armor-piercing rockets, police said.
Palestinians said they were keeping the Shiites from mounting a push
into the three besieged camps which had a population of 120.000 before
the fighting began.
Police reported 19 people were killed and 48 were wounded over
night, raising the toll to at least 408 dead and 1,803 wounded. The two
sides have accused each other of massacres, hut there has been no inde
pendent confirmation of the charges.
The Syrian army left Beirut during Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon
to crush the Palestinians. But Syria has maintained an estimated 30.000
soldiers in northern and eastern Lebanon under a peacekeeping
mandate from the Arab League.
Arab mediators continued efforts in Beirut and Damascus to work out
a compromise between Shiite demands that the camps be disarmed and
Palestinian vows to fight to the last man.
Libya sent envoys to both Beirut and Damascus, and government
ministers from Kuwait, North Yemen and South Yemen were in
Damascus.
Backed by a four-hour barrage of gunfire, the Shiite militiamen halted
a Palestinian counterattack at Sabra on Tuesday, and retook a key build
ing.
Sabra's defenders sneaked through a series of tunnels and surprised
Shiites holding a seven-storv nursing home that overlooks Sabra and
neighboring Chatilla.
The seizure had threatened the Shiites' supply lines in the area.
Palestinian spokesmen confirmed the Shiites had regained the nursing
home, but said the guerrillas recaptured other smaller positions and
regained control of Sabra's main northern entrance.
Hussein seeks peace negotiations
WASHINGTON — Jordan's King Hussein, say ing it presented "a last
chance" for peace in the Mideast, offered yesterday to negotiate with Is
rael in setting up an international conference "umbrella" involving the
Soviet Union.
President Reagan reserved judgment on the proposal, telling
reporters after meeting with Hussein at the White House, "We have not
resolved some of the differences. We are still discussing this whole mat
ter."
But Reagan, winding up the impromptu news conference as a light
rain fell on the South Lawn, agreed with Hussein that "the conditions
have never been more right than they are now to pursue peace."
Hussein said he had the full approval of the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization in proposing that a joint Palestinian-Jordanian delegation
negotiate with Israel on the basis of U.N. Security Council resolution
242.
The resolution, adopted after the 1967 Middle East war, and again
after the Yom Kippur conflict of 1973, assures Israel the right to exist
within secure boundaries. The Palestinians are referred to only as
■'refugees" without any mention of statehood aspirations.
Bangladesh guards against disease
DHAKA, Bangladesh — Survivors of a killer storm in the Bay of
Bengal lined up for cholera vaccinations yesterday, corpses were pushed
into mass graves and helicopters ferried water pumps in a hurried effort
to prevent disease from taking more lives.
A government official said navy vessels, army helicopters and Red
Cross rescue teams by Tuesday had reached all areas hit by Saturday's
storm that killed thousands of people and stripped coastal areas clean of
trees and homes.
Reporters saw people lining up for innoculations, and the helicopters
brought in small hand pumps to restore sources of clean water.
Estimates of the number killed in the storm varied widely, and the
government said it had no list of the missing. It said many of the people
living on hundreds of islands in the Bay of Bengal were squatters.
The government, which has revised its figures up and down several
times, said 1.400 deaths are confirmed. The Red Cross says at least
5.000 were killed and that the figure could increase significantly.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Observer newspaper said the death toll
might reach as high as 50.000, but it did not say how that estimate was
reached.
Mass burials also were reported elsewhere as rescue workers tried to
prevent the spread of disease among the weakened survivors.
The Indian Express newspaper reported today that rescue workers in
Urir Char used one needle to innoculate about 300 people against typ
hoid and tetanus. It quoted a naval officer as saying: "You cannot
change the needle. We cannot afford it. God will give them resistance."
Mujtaba commands two navy ships that brought ricc. beans, milk and
clothing to survivors. He said 1,119 people were evacuated after the
storm from Urir Char to nearby Sandwip, and between 4,000 and 5,000
other residents were unaccounted for.
Urir Char is one of many islands formed by silt from the Ganges,
Brahmaputra and Meghnia rivers about 220 miles south of Dhaka.
Defense: Agca 'fooling' with justice
ROME — Defense attorneys say the erratic behavior of Mehmet Ali
Agca during the papal plot trial shows the state's star witness has "been
fooling with Italian justice for three years."
In the first two days of the trial. Agca, 27, has claimed he was Jesus
Christ, predicted the end of the world and refused to say where he got
the pistol he used to wound Pope John Paul II in St. Peter's Square on
May 13. 1981.
" This is a man who has been fooling with Italian justice for three
years," attorney Giuseppe Console), who represents the only detained
Bulgarian defendant, said of Agca after Tuesday's session.
"He has been playing with innocent people who are in jail because of
this fellow's lies.' Consolo told reporters.
Agca was called to testify against three Bulgarians and four Turks
charged with conspiracy in connection with the shooting. All seven
defendants face life sentences.
Antonio Albano. the prosecutor who brought the indictments, main
tains that Bulgaria, possibly with Soviet support, masterminded the plot
to help stop unrest in the pope's native Poland.
Antonio Marini. who is prosecuting the state's case, said he was un
concerned by Agca's bi/zare courtroom behavior and believes that
Agca's testimony w ill be believable.
Cancer victim completes journey
VICTORIA. British Columbia — Steve Fonyo. a teen-age cancer vic
tim who fought the disease by running from coast to coast on his one
goix.l leg. says he plans to relax on a South Sea island after completing
his conquest of Canada yesterday.
Fonvo's "Journey lor Lives" brought in more than $5 million in dona
tions for cancer research, care and education.
The run began 14 months ago. in March I 984. in a snowstorm on the
Newfoundland coast. Fonyo dipped his wood-and-aluminum left leg in
the ocean and headed west with a running stride-shuffle-hop.
Since then. Fonyo, 19. has trudged nearly 5.000 miles across the
world's second-largest country. He wore out six artificial legs and 17
pairs of running shiies.
For yesterday's nationally televised finish, workmen laid a red carpet
down a ramp to the rocky Pacific shore and erected a platform at the
nearby Mile Zero marker on the Trans-Canada highway for speeches
from Fonvo and senior government officials.

Hussein seeks peace negotiations
WASHINGTON — Jordan's King Hussein, say ing it presented "a last
chance" for peace in the Mideast, offered yesterday to negotiate with Is
rael in setting up an international conference "umbrella" involving the
Soviet Union.
President Reagan reserved judgment on the proposal, telling
reporters after meeting with Hussein at the White House, "We have not
resolved some of the differences. We are still discussing this whole mat
ter."
But Reagan, winding up the impromptu news conference as a light
rain fell on the South Lawn, agreed with Hussein that "the conditions
have never been more right than they are now to pursue peace."
Hussein said he had the full approval of the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization in proposing that a joint Palestinian-Jordanian delegation
negotiate with Israel on the basis of U.N. Security Council resolution
242.
The resolution, adopted after the 1967 Middle East war, and again
after the Yom Kippur conflict of 1973, assures Israel the right to exist
within secure boundaries. The Palestinians are referred to only as
■'refugees" without any mention of statehood aspirations.
Bangladesh guards against disease
DHAKA, Bangladesh — Survivors of a killer storm in the Bay of
Bengal lined up for cholera vaccinations yesterday, corpses were pushed
into mass graves and helicopters ferried water pumps in a hurried effort
to prevent disease from taking more lives.
A government official said navy vessels, army helicopters and Red
Cross rescue teams by Tuesday had reached all areas hit by Saturday's
storm that killed thousands of people and stripped coastal areas clean of
trees and homes.
Reporters saw people lining up for innoculations, and the helicopters
brought in small hand pumps to restore sources of clean water.
Estimates of the number killed in the storm varied widely, and the
government said it had no list of the missing. It said many of the people
living on hundreds of islands in the Bay of Bengal were squatters.
The government, which has revised its figures up and down several
times, said 1.400 deaths are confirmed. The Red Cross says at least
5.000 were killed and that the figure could increase significantly.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Observer newspaper said the death toll
might reach as high as 50.000, but it did not say how that estimate was
reached.
Mass burials also were reported elsewhere as rescue workers tried to
prevent the spread of disease among the weakened survivors.
The Indian Express newspaper reported today that rescue workers in
Urir Char used one needle to innoculate about 300 people against typ
hoid and tetanus. It quoted a naval officer as saying: "You cannot
change the needle. We cannot afford it. God will give them resistance."
Mujtaba commands two navy ships that brought ricc. beans, milk and
clothing to survivors. He said 1,119 people were evacuated after the
storm from Urir Char to nearby Sandwip, and between 4,000 and 5,000
other residents were unaccounted for.
Urir Char is one of many islands formed by silt from the Ganges,
Brahmaputra and Meghnia rivers about 220 miles south of Dhaka.
Defense: Agca 'fooling' with justice
ROME — Defense attorneys say the erratic behavior of Mehmet Ali
Agca during the papal plot trial shows the state's star witness has "been
fooling with Italian justice for three years."
In the first two days of the trial. Agca, 27, has claimed he was Jesus
Christ, predicted the end of the world and refused to say where he got
the pistol he used to wound Pope John Paul II in St. Peter's Square on
May 13. 1981.
" This is a man who has been fooling with Italian justice for three
years," attorney Giuseppe Console), who represents the only detained
Bulgarian defendant, said of Agca after Tuesday's session.
"He has been playing with innocent people who are in jail because of
this fellow's lies.' Consolo told reporters.
Agca was called to testify against three Bulgarians and four Turks
charged with conspiracy in connection with the shooting. All seven
defendants face life sentences.
Antonio Albano. the prosecutor who brought the indictments, main
tains that Bulgaria, possibly with Soviet support, masterminded the plot
to help stop unrest in the pope's native Poland.
Antonio Marini. who is prosecuting the state's case, said he was un
concerned by Agca's bi/zare courtroom behavior and believes that
Agca's testimony w ill be believable.
Cancer victim completes journey
VICTORIA. British Columbia — Steve Fonyo. a teen-age cancer vic
tim who fought the disease by running from coast to coast on his one
goix.l leg. says he plans to relax on a South Sea island after completing
his conquest of Canada yesterday.
Fonvo's "Journey lor Lives" brought in more than $5 million in dona
tions for cancer research, care and education.
The run began 14 months ago. in March I 984. in a snowstorm on the
Newfoundland coast. Fonyo dipped his wood-and-aluminum left leg in
the ocean and headed west with a running stride-shuffle-hop.
Since then. Fonyo, 19. has trudged nearly 5.000 miles across the
world's second-largest country. He wore out six artificial legs and 17
pairs of running shiies.
For yesterday's nationally televised finish, workmen laid a red carpet
down a ramp to the rocky Pacific shore and erected a platform at the
nearby Mile Zero marker on the Trans-Canada highway for speeches
from Fonvo and senior government officials.
Shiites attack Palestinian camp
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Shiite Moslem militiamen and armored units of
a mainly Shiite army unit pounded a Palestinian refugee camp on
Beirut's southern edge with mortars and tank fire yesterday, and 13
shells hit Beirut airport, officials said.
Meanwhile, Beirut radio stations said President Amin Gemayel was
preparing to go to the Sy riun capital of Damascus to ask President Hafez
Assad for Syrian military intervention to stop the fighting.
The shells exploded on the airport tarmac as passengers hoarded a
flight hound for Europe, civil aviation sources said. The passengers
sprinted back to the terminal, and there were no reports of casualties.
Palestinians responded to the Shiite assault on Bourj el-Barajneh
camp with machine guns and armor-piercing rockets, police said.
Palestinians said they were keeping the Shiites from mounting a push
into the three besieged camps which had a population of 120.000 before
the fighting began.
Police reported 19 people were killed and 48 were wounded over
night, raising the toll to at least 408 dead and 1,803 wounded. The two
sides have accused each other of massacres, hut there has been no inde
pendent confirmation of the charges.
The Syrian army left Beirut during Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon
to crush the Palestinians. But Syria has maintained an estimated 30.000
soldiers in northern and eastern Lebanon under a peacekeeping
mandate from the Arab League.
Arab mediators continued efforts in Beirut and Damascus to work out
a compromise between Shiite demands that the camps be disarmed and
Palestinian vows to fight to the last man.
Libya sent envoys to both Beirut and Damascus, and government
ministers from Kuwait, North Yemen and South Yemen were in
Damascus.
Backed by a four-hour barrage of gunfire, the Shiite militiamen halted
a Palestinian counterattack at Sabra on Tuesday, and retook a key build
ing.
Sabra's defenders sneaked through a series of tunnels and surprised
Shiites holding a seven-storv nursing home that overlooks Sabra and
neighboring Chatilla.
The seizure had threatened the Shiites' supply lines in the area.
Palestinian spokesmen confirmed the Shiites had regained the nursing
home, but said the guerrillas recaptured other smaller positions and
regained control of Sabra's main northern entrance.
