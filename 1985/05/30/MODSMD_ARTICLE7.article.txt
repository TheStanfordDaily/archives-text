# Group to protest Three Mile Island decision
## NRC authorizes plant reopening 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Nuclear Regulatory
Commission yesterday authorized the reopening of
the undamaged Three Mile Island reactor, dormant
since a 1979 accident wrecked its twin unit and
raised questions about the safety of nuclear power.
The commission voted 4-1 to allow the General
Public Utilities Corp. to resume operations at the
Pennsylvania plant.
Over the dissent of Commissioner James As
selstine, the NRC said there was "reasonable as
surance that TMI-1 can and should be safely
operated." It agreed to ift its order that had kept
the Unit 1 reactor closed while cleanup continued
at Unit 2.
Three Mile Island Alert, a citizen group, said it
would immediately file a petition with the 3rd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia seeking
reversal of the decision. Attorney Joanne Doros
how said the group also would seek an injunction
barring operations at the plant.
William kuhns. chairman and chief executive of
ficer of GPU, said the startup of Unit 1 would not
interfere with the cleanup of the damaged reactor.

"We are pleased and overwhelmed with the trust
this commission has given us." he said.
The NRC. acting after nearly si\ years of
hearings which generated over 30.000 pages of
transcripts, said its ruling would not become effec
tive until June 3 to allow time for opponents' ap
peals.
I he commission listed two conditions that could
further delay restart. One requires GPU and the
plant operator. GPU Nuclear, to submit a schedule
for gradually bringing the reactor into operation.
The other stipulates that a program be developed
to increase the NRC staffs ability to oversee plant
operators.
NRC Chairman Nunzio Palladino said. "The
current organization is a different and improved or
ganization from the one that operated TMI in
"1979."
But Asselstine said the NRC had allowed itself to
he satisfied with "Band-Aid. short-term fixes."
"Each time evidence of a new transgression has
come to light, the commission has chosen to deal
with it in isolation." Asselstine said. "The commis

sion hits he en satisfied with shuttling around indi
viduals us a solution to the problems ot the plant
management, he said.
Pennsxlvania max also seek a stay ot the decision
in court, said spokeswoman Martha Lester.
On Tuesday, less than 24 hours before the vote,
the NRC staff certified that the last of 155 condi
tions necessarx lor restart had been met, said
spokesman John Stolz. The conditions ranging
from emergencx preparedness requirements to
plant design specifications — were drawn up by the
commission based on its assessment ot the accident.
Unit 1 could be operating within two weeks, and
it could reach full capacity within 90 days, accord
ing to the plant management.
The 800-megawatt Unit 1 was closed for refuel
ing and was unharmed in the accident in which its
twin. Unit 2. was crippled after its core dangerously
overheated. Several months later, in July 197 1 ). the
commission suspended the authority ot Unit 1 to
operate until it was satisfied that all safety concerns
had been addressed.
