# Reagan: Tax change 'all but inevitable'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President
Reagan declared yesterday that an
overhaul of the nation's tax code is
"all hut inevitable" and said that un
der his plan, "Making ends meet is
going to be a lot easier for a lot of
people."
In a speech before an audience that
the White House said would benefit
from Reagan's plan, the president
denounced the current system as un
fair and as "an old jalopy" and said
the country has only two options:
"We can either declare April 15
(the tax-filing deadline) a day of na
tional mourning, or we can change the
system. And I don't think Americans
can recognize an injustice without
trying to change it."
Barely acknowledging that any op
position has been voiced to his pro
posal, Reagan said: "Even those in
this town who are still reluctant are
being lifted up and carried forward by
the momentum of public support for
a fundamental change in our tax laws.
Once called impossible, tax fairness
and simplification are now all but in
evitable."
The president's assessment of the

prospects for change was more opti
mistic than that offered by Treasury
Secretary James Baker, who said.
"We have a fair shot at getting this
through Congress this year ... a fair
shot at keeping it reasonably intact."
Baker added, "Nobody ever said
it's going to be easy."
From Reagan at the White House
to Vice President George Bush
speaking before the convention of
Rotary International in Kansas City,
Mo., the administration put on a
major push to sell the tax plan the
president unveiled Tuesday night.
Baker appeared on two morning
network television shows to tout the
package and White House Chief of
Staff Donald Regan appeared on a
third program.
"Fifty-eight percent of the Ameri
can people benefit from this as they
get a tax reduction," Regan said.
"Twenty-one percent of us — no
change. Twenty-one percent arc hurt.
"We're going to rely on the 79 per
cent that benefit overall from this to
help us in gaining this victory,"
Regan said on ABC-TV's "Good
Morning America." "In other words.

it got to be the people against them,
the special interests."
In general, the biggest winners in
Reagan's program would be the
lowest-income families, people who
do not itemize or who claim few
deductions and wealthy Americans.
Henry Bloch, president of H&R
Block, the company that prepares
about one of every 10 individual tax
returns, said the proposal "is really
shifting a lot of the tax burden to
middle-class people and helping the
rich people. ... I really think they're
going to wind up footing the bill for
people at the low end and at the high
end."
A hypothetical two-earner couple
with $45,000 income and no children
would have to pay almost $300 more.
If the same couple had two depen
dent children, their tax hill would
drop by $ 165.
Reagan addressed a group in the
East Room that White House deputy
press secretary Larry Speakes said in
cluded Hispanics. blacks, women, re
ligious groups, low-income families
and "family" groups.
"Making ends meet is going to be a

lot easier tor a lot of people under our
plan, especially those of low and
modest incomes who find it difficult
to cope under the existing, unfair
code." the president said.
"We're making many changes, but
while we're throwing out the had in
the old tax law. we're being sure to
keep the good, with special attention
to those provisions that protect our
families." lie added, noting it retains
deductions for home mortgage inter
est. charitable gixing. medical bills
and other benefits.
The White House plan compresses
the tax rates into a three-tier system:
15 percent, 25 percent and 35 per
cent.
Reagan said seven out of every 10
taxpayers would be in the 15 percent
bracket and"and fully 97 percent of
all taxpayers w ill pay no more than 25
cents on the very last dollar they earn.
Only 3 percent of America's families
will have to pay at the highest rate."
He added: "Our proposal is not a
tax increase and it will not increase
the deficit. It will mean lover taxes
for a majority of Americans, with ex
panded opportunities to save and in
vest."
