Gene splicing cure
BOSTON — Researchers have engineered
bacteria to produce the human protein lipocortin.
the body's own inflammation fighter, and say it
could replace cortisone as a treatment for
arthritis and asthma.
The development, announced yesterday by the
biotechnology firm Biogen, represents the latest
effort to induce microbes to churn out rare
proteins by giving them human genes.
Lipocortin, a natural substance discovered just
five years ago, shuts down a chemical chain reac
tion inside the body that ordinarily leads to in
flammation.
Cortisone and similar steroid drugs work by
encouraging the body to make more lipocortin.
These drugs are extremely useful for relieving in
flammation. However, doctors are often reluc
tant to prescribe them for long periods because of
their side effects.
Arrest made in spy case
WASHINGTON — The FBI arrested the
brother of an accused Soviet spy yesterday night
on charges of supplying classified Navy docu
ments for delivery to the Soviet Union.
FBI Director William Webster announced that
former Navy Ft. Cmdr. Arthur James Walker.

50, was arrested without incident at his home in
Virginia Beach, Va.
The new defendant is the brother of James An
thony Walker Jr., 47. a retired Navy communica
tions specialist, and the uncle of Michael Lance
Walker. 22, a Navy seaman aboard the aircraft
carrier Nimitz, who were indicted Tuesday in
Baltimore on six counts of spying for the Soviet
Union.
Arthur Walker, who retired from the Navy in
1973 after commanding submarines, was charged
with espionage in an FBI complaint filed late yes
terday in U.S. District Court in Norfolk, Va.
He was accused of turning over classified docu
ments and communications relating to U.S. na
tional defense on April 2K, 19K2, in Chesapeake,
Va.
According to Webster, the FBI complaint said
that Arthur Walker — now working as an en
gineer with a defense contractor in Chesapeake
— knew this material would be delivered by his
brother, John, to Soviet agents.
Earlier, Michael Walker was ordered held
without bond to await arraignment on espionage
charges.
U.S. Magistrate Daniel Klein rejected argu
ments that Michael Walker was unlikely to flee
because his wife and other relatives live in Nor
folk. Va., and he did not present a danger to the
community.

Walker's attorney, Charles Bernstein, said his
client is not a risk "because he can't get to his
ship and he has no home in the arms of the Soviet
government."
Walker has been held without bond since his
arrest last week aboard the nuclear aircraft car
rier Nimitz.
a\ six-count federal indictment issued Tuesday
said Walker was paid $ 1.000 for classified papers
he took from the Oceana Naval Air Station in
Virginia Beach, Va.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Schatzow
said "the damage has already occurred," but the
penalty Walker faces, including life imprison
ment, "creates the biggest reason to flee."
