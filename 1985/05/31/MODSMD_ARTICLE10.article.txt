Measles on the rise
ATLANTA — Three years after the predicted
eradication date for measles, the once-common
childhood disease is up 69 percent in this country
compared with a year ago.
The national Centers for Disease Control said
yesterday that 2,534 cases of measles were re
ported in the United States last year, compared
with 1,497 in 1983.
News of measles resurgence comes less than
seven years after then-Secretary of Health, Edu
cation and Welfare Joseph Califano announced
an initiative designed to wipe out the disease in
this country by 1982. No new target date has
been announced.
"Although the number of reported measles
cases in 1984 has increased from 1983, it is still
far lower than the number in the prevaccine era,"
the CDC said in its Morbidity and Mortality
Weekly Report.
Between 1950 and 1962, before widespread
use of measles vaccine, an average of more than
525,000 cases were reported each year.

A CDC researcher said yesterday's report
doesn't mean that the nation's goal of eliminating
measles by vaccinating young people is unrealis
tic.
"Not necessarily," said Don Stenhouse, a CDC
measles specialist. "We just need to concentrate
on the individuals who have not received the
vaccine."
If preschool and school-age Americans get
their vaccinations as they should, "we feel we
certainly can eliminate indigenous measles within
the next year or so," he said.
A total of 874 cases, or 34 percent, last year
were classified as preventable — occurring in
someone between 16 months and 29 years old
and without measles immunity or a valid reason
not to be immunized.

WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger said yesterday he had ordered three
officers at the Miramar Naval Air Station in Cali
fornia relieved of their posts and transferred to

other duties because of the base's purchase of
$660 aircraft ashtrays.
Weinberger, speaking at his first general news
conference in a year, used this week's revelation
of high fees being paid to the Grumman Aero
space Corp. to reiterate his intention to crack
down on defense contractors.
Stocks gain slightly
The stock market scraped together a small gain
yesterday continuing its indecisive showing of the
past couple of sessions.
But analysts found some encouragement in the
fact that the market was able to hold firm despite
weakness in International Business Machines,
one of the most prominent blue chips on Wall
Street.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
down .45 Tuesdav and up 1.46 Wednesday, rose
2.80 to 1,305.78.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
stepped up to 108.76 million shares from 96.54
million the day before.
