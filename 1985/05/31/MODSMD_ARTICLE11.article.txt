Goodman lauds Jackson
MONTEREY — Navy Lt. Robert Goodman
ended his month as a Syrian prisoner of war with
160,000 letters and newfound respect for the
Rev. Jesse Jackson, the man responsible for his
release.
"He's an incredibly intelligent man with the
ability to foresee consequences," said the 28-
year-old airman. "1 don't agree with all the things
he espouses, but I give him credit for being out
there, trying."
Jackson's trip to Syria to gain Goodman's
release helped make Jackson a serious contender
for the Democratic nomination in 1984.
In an interview appearing in yesterday's Mon
terey Peninsula Herald. Goodman, a student at
the Naval Postgraduate School, said he is still
asked if Jackson deserved the political benefits
he received from his mission.
"1 say, 'sure.' He stepped out on a limb and
took a chance. If it failed, it would have been a
disaster for him." he said.
Goodman was a navigator in a two-seat Navy
A-6 Intruder from the aircraft carrier USS John
Kennedy in the Mediterranean off the coast of

Lebanon.
On Dec. 4, 1983. his plane and others flew a
retaliatory strike against anti-aircraft positions
that had fired on Navy RF-14 reconnaissance
planes supporting the U.S. peacekeeping mis
sion.
Artukovic appeals
LOS ANGELES — Attorneys for a man
accused of thousands of Nazi war murders filed
an appeal yesterday citing 27 reasons why a
magistrate's order to extradite him to Yugoslavia
should be reversed.
Among their key points was the oft-repeated
contention that the man. 85-year-old Andrija
Artukovic, is senile, half-blind and incompetent
to understand and participate in the proceedings
against him.
Universal chemical spill
UNIVERSAL- CITY — A hazardous chemical
leaked from a drum in a film processing lab at
Universal Studios yesterday and injured 26

people, most of them workers overcome while
trying to mop up the spill.
Three of the victims were hospitalized, and
county firefighters evacuated about 50 people
from a Technicolor Inc. building on the studio
grounds after about 20 gallons of the chemical
leaked from a 55-gallon drum.
"The ones who actually cleaned it up got the
worst exposure," said fire Capt. Harrol Ful
lbright. " I hey became drowsy and sleepy, but no
one actually lost consciousness."
The chemical, perchloroethylene, is "actually
very mildly toxic," said fire Inspector Pat Brad
shaw. In extremely high dosages it has an anes
thetic effect, he added.
One person was admitted to the coronary care
unit and two to the intensive care unit of Bur
bank C ommunity Hospital, complaining of short
ness of breath, but all were in good condition
later yesterday, said spokesman Mario Antoci.
Today's weather
Fair today with highs in the 70s. Tonight partly
cloudy with a chance of showers.
