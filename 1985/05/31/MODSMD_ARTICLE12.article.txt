## Protesters act on convictions about equality, justice 
### PETER HAVEN Staff writer 
Perhaps the only thing members of
Stanford Out of South Africa
(SOSA) have in common is their
desire to combat apartheid with U.S.
initiative.
SOSA does not seem to draw its
support from any one interest or
minority group on campus. Rather,
the six-week old group is a sort of al
phabet soup coalition with represen
tatives from many organizations here.
Members of the Black Student
Union (BSU), the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance at Stanford (GLAS) and
Students Against Reaganism
(STAR), humanists, pacifists and
feminists have all participated in the
SOSA protest movement.
In addition to its diverse roots,
SOSA has been aided by the often
passionate support of its membership.

The question of whether this sup
port is just a spring-quarter fling or a
permanent commitment by students
to bring about social change can be
answered only with the passage of
time.
But for now, at least, there are
definitely more than a few people
willing to hurl themselves headlong
toward the goal of total divestment.
Political awareness is something
SOSA member David Troutt sees as
a fundamental aspect of the develop
ment of all individuals, not only those
associated with the movement.
"For the individual, [the protest
movement] embodies the ideal of
practice, which is the nexus between
thinking and doing," Troutt says.
"Since victory may only be one's
integrity in the end,. . . protest is ulti
mately about growing up. The
process of adulthood in this country

demands a manifestation of political
consciousness," says Troutt, editor of
The Real News, a quarterly news
journal geared toward Stanford's
black community.
Troutt, who has a white mother
and a black father, has long been in
terested in social and civil rights is
sues.
Raised in the politically active city
of New York, Troutt says he was in
troduced to a wide range of social is
sues, but one with which he became
particularly concerned was racism.
"I hate racism. I hate it deeply, and
apartheid is its symbol," he says.
There was one event during
Troutt's high school days in New
York that had a profund impact on
him and his political beliefs.
"I was working in the morning with
ghetto youths in my New York neigh
borhood. One of them asked me for a

dollar, hut I couldn't give him one.
He called me a white hoy," Troutt
says.
"Later that night, 1 went to a party
on the east side of New York, which
is very rich and very white. 1 passed a
group of drunk white guys who called
me a nigger," he says.
"The schism that erupted in my
mind on that day Seemed to crystalize
in my mind one of the ugliest diseases
I could know, and in my embodying
both worlds (black and white) it
mandated a role to play," Troutt says.
Troutt says he believes SOSA is
made up of people who really believe
in their cause and are not just hop
ping on the bandwagon.
"The movement is just too de
manding," he says."It demands a
commitment. SOSA meetings are
painfully democratic at times. On
average, they take about four hours.
We've just blown whole Sundays [in
meetings]."
He adds, "This is not a superficial
movement by students."
Along with Troutt, many in SOSA,
such as BSU Treasurer Donna An
derson, have found their academic
pursuits to be in line with their activi
ties as protesters.
"It's simply a matter of a greater
commitment," Anderson says. "1 dis
ciplined myself when I came here that
academics were a priority, but not the
only priority.
"I have been exposed to a lot of in
formation before, in terms of racism
and sexism. I've dealt a lot with these
isssues through the classes and semi
nars I've taken," says Anderson, who
is majoring in political science with an
emphasis in ethnic studies.
Anderson, who is black, says she
encountered a lot of "blatant racism"
while attending high school in Santa
Barbara County and in Derby,
Kan. <
"Fighting repression is what my life
is about. This is it." Anderson says,
explaining her involvement with
SOSA. "This is what I'll be doing
when I graduate."
Anderson also says she has been

SOSA member Donna Anderson speaks at the May 14 divestment forum that features Stanford trustees and
SOSA. The University "is where it (racism) should be challenged," she says, explaining that the University is
unresponsive to minority needs. "But the challenge is completely delegitimized by the University."

practice, which is the nexus between thinking and doing," says David
Troutt, a member of SOSA's liaison committee that has met with Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy regarding University divestment.
surprised by the "institutionalized
racism" at Stanford.
"There is a complete disregard and
exclusion of minority cultures on this
campus," Anderson says.
As evidence for her claim, Ander
son cites the continuous attacks on
theme houses; the difficulty minority
tracks like black and ethnic studies
have in obtaining funding; and the
presentation of the Western Culture
program, in which the works of black
authors are almost never read.
"This is where it (racism) should be
challenged," she says. "But the chal
lenge is completely delegitimized by
the University."
With her heavy time commitment
to organizations like SOSA, Ander
son echoes the feelings of many
SOSA members when she says her in
volvement within the organization
has enhanced her life by allowing her
to make new friends, most of whom
share her political views.
Mario Huerta, a junior majoring in
psychology, says he spends "30 to 35
hours a week" with SOSA.
"I don't do very much work â€” you
know, school work," Huerta says.
"It's pretty minimal, but it doesn't
bother me at all.
"My feeling is I know how to be a
student already. It's not difficult for
me to sit down and read a book, take
a test, etc."
Like so many other SOSA mem
bers, Huerta says he feels he is
"learning much more being involved
in the movement."
He adds, "It is a powerful experi
ence, far more rewarding than class
work."

Huerta has been involved in the
past with GLAS, the Stanford
Humanist Organization, the Bridge
and, most recently, SOSA.
"I know what it is like to be
repressed," Huerta says. "I'm gay
and a member of many other
minorities. I think it is essential to
fight against any system, here or in
the world, that is repressive in na
ture."
The presence of a considerable
number of gay men and lesbians
within SOSA has been noticeable.
"We are far more sensitive to any
form of repression," Huerta says, ex
plaining the gay community's in
volvement in the protest.
"Being involved with this opens up
peoples' eyes about attitudes like
sexism, racism, classism. In a way, it
provides a means for us to teach
people about our own fight," he says.
Michael Schmitz, a senior whose
involvement in STAR led him to
SOSA, says SOSA has given him an
other focus on life at Stanford.
"In the past, academics has always
been the focus of my life. Now there
are two focuses," Schmitz says.
"Socially and recrebtionally, that
has suffered," he says. "But what has
happened is I do have a lot of friends
within the movement."
Despite such setbacks as missing
his senior formal, Schmitz says he has
not really noticed a tremendous loss
of a social life because, "this (the
SOSA movement) is as fulfilling as
the social life I had before."
Defying the sterotypical image of a
student protester, Schmitz, a would
be physician with a strong Catholic
background, finds no contradiction
among SOSA, his career goals and his

religious convictions.
"I have developed an awareness of
the condition of a majority of people
in this world. From my Catholic
upbringing, 1 think it is my responsi
bility to do as much for people as I
can. It is my life goal, and my career
comes within that," he says.
"I see a lot of issues that are linked
to the apartheid issue. You see apart
heid in South Africa, and you see that
the native Americans here are still on
reservations," he says. "Even the
laws against segregation have really
brought about no effective change."
Schmitz adds, "Apartheid is very
crucial, but it is just a part of this
whole issue."
An interesting perspective on the
protest is offered by SOSA member
Madelyne Larsen, a sophomore who
transfered here in January from Wes
leyan. She was active in the Students
Opposed to Pornography (STOP)
protest against Playboy earlier this
year, and she is a member of the
Stanford Arms Control and Disarma
ment Forum.
Because ot the smaller investment
portfolio at Wesleyan, Larsen says
the students there have a greater
chance of getting their demands met
more quickly than do students here.
In addition, she savs almost all of the

2,400 students there are aware of and
concerned about the issues surround
ing divestment.
Wesleyan is a much more
"politically conscious school," Larsen
says.
"I don't see how I can get away
from divestment. It's what I as a
white, middle class female can do for
those people there (South Africa),"
she says."l feel like I'm contributing.
I'm having an active part in what's
going on. It makes me feel strong. I
can go around and tell people, 'This is
what I believe, and I believe it
strongly.' "
But her involvement has had its
drawbacks.
"I dropped a class on Friday (May
17). The straw that broke the camel's
back was ... I spent all of last week
under a car," sl:e says, referring to
the attempt to block cars belonging to
members of the Board of Trustees
during their meeting on campus
several weeks ago.
Also a member of the Stanford
women's crew team, Larsen says she
spends 15 to 20 hours a week with
SOSA.
"I've made a lot of friends through
SOSA. It's been good for me. It's
brought me in contact with a lot of
people I want to be around," she
says. "1 feel very close to those
people. It (the car sit-in) was an in
credible experience that brought us
together."
