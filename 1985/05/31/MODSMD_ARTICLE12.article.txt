## Protesters act on convictions about equality, justice 
### PETER HAVEN Staff writer 
Perhaps the only thing members of
Stanford Out of South Africa
(SOSA) have in common is their
desire to combat apartheid with U.S.
initiative.
SOSA does not seem to draw its
support from any one interest or
minority group on campus. Rather,
the six-week old group is a sort of al
phabet soup coalition with represen
tatives from many organizations here.
Members of the Black Student
Union (BSU), the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance at Stanford (GLAS) and
Students Against Reaganism
(STAR), humanists, pacifists and
feminists have all participated in the
SOSA protest movement.
In addition to its diverse roots,
SOSA has been aided by the often
passionate support of its membership.

The question of whether this sup
port is just a spring-quarter fling or a
permanent commitment by students
to bring about social change can be
answered only with the passage of
time.
But for now, at least, there are
definitely more than a few people
willing to hurl themselves headlong
toward the goal of total divestment.
Political awareness is something
SOSA member David Troutt sees as
a fundamental aspect of the develop
ment of all individuals, not only those
associated with the movement.
"For the individual, [the protest
movement] embodies the ideal of
practice, which is the nexus between
thinking and doing," Troutt says.
"Since victory may only be one's
integrity in the end,. . . protest is ulti
mately about growing up. The
process of adulthood in this country

demands a manifestation of political
consciousness," says Troutt, editor of
The Real News, a quarterly news
journal geared toward Stanford's
black community.
Troutt, who has a white mother
and a black father, has long been in
terested in social and civil rights is
sues.
Raised in the politically active city
of New York, Troutt says he was in
troduced to a wide range of social is
sues, but one with which he became
particularly concerned was racism.
"I hate racism. I hate it deeply, and
apartheid is its symbol," he says.
There was one event during
Troutt's high school days in New
York that had a profund impact on
him and his political beliefs.
"I was working in the morning with
ghetto youths in my New York neigh
borhood. One of them asked me for a

dollar, hut I couldn't give him one.
He called me a white hoy," Troutt
says.
"Later that night, 1 went to a party
on the east side of New York, which
is very rich and very white. 1 passed a
group of drunk white guys who called
me a nigger," he says.
"The schism that erupted in my
mind on that day Seemed to crystalize
in my mind one of the ugliest diseases
I could know, and in my embodying
both worlds (black and white) it
mandated a role to play," Troutt says.
Troutt says he believes SOSA is
made up of people who really believe
in their cause and are not just hop
ping on the bandwagon.
"The movement is just too de
manding," he says."It demands a
commitment. SOSA meetings are
painfully democratic at times. On
average, they take about four hours.
We've just blown whole Sundays [in
meetings]."
He adds, "This is not a superficial
movement by students."
Along with Troutt, many in SOSA,
such as BSU Treasurer Donna An
derson, have found their academic
pursuits to be in line with their activi
ties as protesters.
"It's simply a matter of a greater
commitment," Anderson says. "1 dis
ciplined myself when I came here that
academics were a priority, but not the
only priority.
"I have been exposed to a lot of in
formation before, in terms of racism
and sexism. I've dealt a lot with these
isssues through the classes and semi
nars I've taken," says Anderson, who
is majoring in political science with an
emphasis in ethnic studies.
Anderson, who is black, says she
encountered a lot of "blatant racism"
while attending high school in Santa
Barbara County and in Derby,
Kan. <
"Fighting repression is what my life
is about. This is it." Anderson says,
explaining her involvement with
SOSA. "This is what I'll be doing
when I graduate."

SOSA member Donna Anderson speaks at the May 14 divestment forum that features Stanford trustees and
SOSA. The University "is where it (racism) should be challenged," she says, explaining that the University is
unresponsive to minority needs. "But the challenge is completely delegitimized by the University."

practice, which is the nexus between thinking and doing," says David
Troutt, a member of SOSA's liaison committee that has met with Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy regarding University divestment.
