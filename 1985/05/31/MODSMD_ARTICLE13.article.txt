In a quick and surprising turnabout, University
President Donald Kennedy yesterday placed the
entire student proposal to change the Univer
sity's investment policy on the agenda of the June
14 Board of Trustees meeting.
Last week, it appeared that Kennedy was going
to render the proposal impotent by splitting it
into pieces, allowing the trustees to escape facing
the moral imperative behind it. But now, the pro
posal, which was authored by student members of
the Commission on Investment Responsibility
(C-IR) and the Committee on Investments, will
be discussed as a whole by the Committee on In
vestments at the June board meeting.
It does not seem terribly unlikely that the
Committee on Investments will approve the pro
posal, given that it would be bad publicity indeed
if the committee were to reject the proposal
before the board ever got to see it. But the com
mittee process will hardly be a simple rubber
stamping, according to Mark Landesmann, a co
author of the proposal. "Anything that goes to
the committee receives close scrutiny. It will be
hotly discussed and debated."

It is important that this proposal come before
the trustees. The proposal is the most workable
compromise between the desires of the total
divestment advocates (including the members of
Stanford Out of South Africa) and the pragmatic
minded members of administration (including
Kennedy).
If the proposal is to be taken seriously at the
June board meeting, two things will have to hap
pen in the next two weeks.
First, the C-IR should recommend that the
board approve the proposal. Such a recommen
dation could be key, given that, according to Lan
desmann, trustees have passed the "vast
majority" of proposals recommended to them by
the C-IR.
Second, students, faculty and staff must con
centrate their efforts on lobbying the trustees so
that they will realize that this proposal is an effec
tive way to take a strong moral stand while
remaining pragmatic.
This is the best chance we've seen yet to
achieve a responsible investment policy here. To
lose this opportunity would be a grave mistake.
