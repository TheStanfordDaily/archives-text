# Why does The Daily print columns like this?
## 
### 
Tom Kearney is a senior majoring in lin
guistics. This is his final column.
Actually, I'm majoring in math and linguis
tics. They have the rest of it
uncharacteristically right. In fact, I'm —
theoretically — a graduated senior, which
means that this really is my final column.
You'll never have to read me again. (Not that
you have to read me now — I guess I should
have told you that when I started writing.
Well, too late. And since you've already
started reading this column, you might as well
finish it.)
Since this is my last column, I'm not going
to have a chance to write a lot of other
columns I had thought of. For some of them,
that's a good thing, but some of them I hate to
see go to waste. Well, they would have gone
to waste anyway, but I hate to see them go to
their graves "unwept, unhonored and un
sung." (No, that's not a quote from anything
you could possibly be expected to know.
Don't worry about it.) So I'm going to take
advantage of my final column to show you
some of them. They'll still be unhonored, but
at least they'll be sung.
So here are some of the columns I should
have written, some I wanted to write, some I
would have liked to write and some other ran
dom ones thrown in.
• On the social utility of suicide. I was think
ing of it, really I was, but my friends talked me
out of it. They agreed that it could be funny,

in a black sort of way, but what if someone
took it seriously? It would have been a spec
tacular demonstration of the power of the
press, but somebody probably would have
been mad at me for suggesting it. And 1 would
have felt kind of stupid too, I guess. So I
didn't do it.

• Summer vacation. You're going to go home
this summer and everything is going to be
ugly. You'll find that all the good jobs have
been taken by high school students and
people whose school year ended at a
reasonable time. If you live in a small town,
you'll get a job on a farm, shoveling guano out
of chicken coops. If you live in a city, you'll
work at McDonald's and wish you lived in a
small town so you could get a dignified job.
Your girlfriend or boyfriend at home,
whom you haven't seen since Christmas, has
fallen in love with someone else and doesn't

like you anymore. Your girlfriend or
boyfriend at school is going home this sum
mer and will probably fall in love with some
one else and not like you anymore. No matter
where you live, it's going to be boring and too
hot, or boring and not hot enough.
That column was too depressing even to
think very much about.
• What's hot, what's not.
Who cares?
• Apartheid. I could have written a sarcastic
column about how we should invest in South
Africa rather than divest, how human rights
should be measured on a sliding scale accord
ing to how much money the participating
humans are worth, how torture and arbitrary
arrests and shooting into crowds aren't really
so bad, how whites couldn't possibly let blacks
have any power, because if they did the whites
would be slaughtered. It would all have been
so obviously satirical that no reasonable per
son could have taken it for a serious state
ment.
But there aren't as many reasonable people
around as you might think. In fact, I'm the
only reasonable person I know. If I wrote
about that, laying on the sarcasm so thick that
even most unreasonable people would know I
wasn't serious, I would still anger a lot of
people. SOSA and the BSU and a whole
bunch of random unreasonable people would
probably send me hate mail, burn crosses on
my patio, hang me in effigy, boycott The

Daily, crucify my cat, threaten my family and
generally carry on cranky.
Now that I think of it, I wish I had written
that column.
• Jason Matherly. I thought of parodying him,
but then I thought, why bother?

A bunch of random
unreasonable people
would probably burn
crosses on my patio,
hang me in effigy and
crucify my cat.

• Gay sex in bathrooms. Sad to say, I simply
don't give a damn about this, one of the bur
ning issues of our time.
• The speech to the graduates. Or: Gosh, this
is a swell place, good luck to all of you, have a
life.
Yech.
• Star Wars.

I don't know anything about Star Wars (the
plan, that is; I know a little about "Star
Wars," the motion picture). But 1 wouldn't be
a Daily columnist if 1 allowed ignorance to
stand in the way of my having an opinion.
From what I gather, President Reagan's
proposed Star Wars defense is silly and won't
work. I'm for it, though; if we're going to
waste money (and we should: It's good for the
economy), we might as well waste it on some
thing fun. Education, social security and
cleaning up toxic wastes are all boring things
to waste money on.
• United States out of El Salvador.
Or is it Nicaragua? Or both?
Let's see; we're supporting the government
in one, and the rebels in the other, right? I re
member reading something about mining
somebody's harbors, and supporting elections
somewhere, and giving some people money to
make sure that nobody else gives them
money, and giving some people weapons to
make sure nobody else gives them weapons,
and giving some people advice to make sure
nobody else gives them advice.
Hell, I don't know. That's why I never
wrote a column about it.
• Why The Daily lets its columnists get away
with this kind of crap.
I don't know.

and linguistics. This is indeed his final
column.)
