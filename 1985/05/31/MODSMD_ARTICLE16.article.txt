Disobedience is OK
The following is an open letter to
University President Donald Kennedy
and the Stan ford community:
Why civil disobedience? In the
midst of what the University makes
out to he constructive progress in
considering divestiture, and in light
of apparently fading student interest
in the issue, why civil disobedience?
Because of a clear moral urgency
to dismantle a regime that has as its
professed doctrine racial inequality
and that uses any and all means to
oppress three-quarters of its popula
tion. Because University Treasurer
Rod Adams and Vice President for
Business and Finance William Massy
remain hard-headed opponents of
divestment, and you. President Ken
nedy, have sided with them and have

demonstrated a clear lack of respect
for the Stanford students, their
opinions and their motives. Because
Stanford refuses to commit itself to
take the lead in the beginning of the
end of the apartheid regime in South
Africa.
The members of the current civil
disobedience group, although
sparked into action by an upsurge of
ire, sustain themselves by drawing
upon undercurrents of philosophical
beliefs which run much deeper,
behind the faces of anger and sor
row.
All too often, the laws of today, in
all their rhetorical complexity, serve
not as a means to protect the rights
of the individual but as a
smokescreen of technicalities behind
which one who violates the rights of
others may hide in obscurity.

The citizen infatuated with
obeying the written rules of the law
and not with protecting other indi
viduals rights often renders himself
powerless against those violators of
human rights who hide behind the
protection of law.
We in the civil disobedience group
are committed to protecting the
rights of every individual. We have
found breaking the written law to be
the most effective means toward our
end, and have carried out our action
without encroaching upon the rights
of others.
Confronted with the anti
democratic infrastructure of the
University, we have gone to jail to
demonstrate a commitment to Stan
ford divestment and a demand that
President Kennedy and the Board of
Trustees confront head-on the issue
at hand, the issue of a free South

Africa with black majority rule.

Civil disobedience
We support the moral convictions
that led nine students to be arrested
over the issue of Stanford's invest
ments in companies doing business in
South Africa. Apartheid is a moral
abomination that creates wide
spread suffering and destroys human
lives. It deserves our strongest moral
outrage.
Some may argue that civil dis
obedience is not the wisest political
response and that it serves only to

alienate trustees and others who
might he allies in formulating a more
constructive course for the future.
However, we think that there are
times when the moral sensitivities of
individuals become passionately
concrete and override all thought of
political prudence.
At different times, people feel that
they must act on their convictions in
the hope that this witness might act
as a moral catalyst for leadership and
insight. We feel that such statements
arc an important element of moral
discourse and make a valuable con
tribution to the moral health of our
society.
