## TMU bid process balanced, fair 
### 
Some weeks ago, United Stanford Workers
Chief Steward Linda Crouse wrote a letter criticiz
ing the way the University is deciding who will
operate the food services at Tresidder. I would like
to respond to her letter and to clarify some points
because she didn't have all of her facts quite
straiuht.

VIEWPOINT

How often are decisions made? Who makes
them? How are they made?
• These decisions arc made every five years — the
length of the contract.
• The Tresidder Union Board, acting on the
recommendations of the staff and its food com
mittee. specifies what services are needed and what
matters are required, such as: quality, menu, prices,
hours, standards of cleanliness, special matters
(such as maximizing the use of students in manage
ment and staff positions), responsiveness to the
needs of those who use TMU. etc.
In making the specifications, the Union Board
uses results of market research, staff reports, data
from current operations, customer comments, in
formation gathered from periodic open forums
and. of course, its own considered judgment.
The majority of the members of the Union
Board are students, including students appointed
by the ASSU and student committee chairs, as well
as faculty and staff from the University. I serve as
an adviser along with some TMU staff, but we do
not have a vote.
• Food service operators are invited to make
proposals to operate the TMU food services as set
forth in the specifications. All who bid or make

proposals do so on an equal basis, with the obvious
exception of the current food service contractors.
They enjoy an advantage of actually having run
TMU's food services. They also have the advantage
(or peril) of everyone's actually knowing how well
they have performed.
Proposals, once received, are reviewed by an ad
hoc student/staff food contract advisory group.
The group narrows the pool and has additional
conversations with the companies with the most
promising proposals. The campus operations of
some may even be visited.
The advisory group will make its recommen
dations to the appropriate staff. Ultimately, the
decision is made by the director. Ellie Oppenhcim,

Tresidder's food opera
tions are services for fac
ulty, students and staff.

and I will review the decision as well as the process
used to make it.
This is a very time-consuming process. The food
committee, for example, has been working on this
since October. If it is to be an adequately con
sultative, thorough and fair process, it should take
time.
USWs Crouse asserted that Ellie Oppenhcim
has a conflict of interest because her husband
works for Saga, one of the college food service
firms invited to bid. That assertion is nonsense!
Oppenhcim's husband doesn't work for the part of

Saga that deals with college food services. He
works for a quite different restaurant company
which is owned by Saga hut which does not do any
business on college campuses. Even so, TMU went
to considerable effort to avoid even the appearance
of such a conflict by establishing such an open and
consultative process.
Indeed, so has the ASSU gone to the same care
to avoid such a conflict of interest. One of the
Council of Presidents members is on the food
committee and has taken very special care to dis
tance herself from the work of the ASSU-owned
Coffee House, Inc., another one of the firms that
submitted a proposal. It never occurred to any of us
to challenge the word of an ASSU president that
such distance has been kept.
Finally, USW's Crouse rewrote history a bit
when she wrote how the ASSU was chosen to oper
ate the Coffee House five years ago. ASSU's Cof
fee House, Inc. was chosen becausc it presented the
best plan for the operation of the Coffee House. It
had a sound proposal that was judged on its merits
and not, as Crouse asserts, because students
pressed for student involvement in running TMU's
food services.
Tresidder's food operations are services for fac
ulty, students and staff. They are also large and
complex businesses that must contribute their share
of the cost of operating Stanford's union. I am
confident that the campus community wants the
management and board of their union to choose
the food services on the basis of good service,
meaningful student involvement and operational
integrity.
