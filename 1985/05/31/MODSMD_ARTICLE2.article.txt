# Mosher meets with Kennedy
## 
### MARY YUH Editorial staff 
Steven Mosher, a former Stanford
doctoral candidate in anthropology,
charged the University with opening
a new line of inquiry and with taking
an inordinate amount of time to reach
a decision on his case. The charge fol
lowed a Tuesday meeting with Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy.
Mosher was dismissed from the
Anthropology Department's doctoral
program on Feb. 24, 1983, by an 11-
0 vote of the department's faculty.
The faculty said he engaged in
"illegal and seriously unethical con
duct" while in China and that he
"seriously endangered his research
subjects." In May 1984, Kennedy in
formed Mosher that he agreed with
that decision, but offered Mosher the
opportunity to supplement his record
as part of the appeal process.
According to University officials,
the purpose of Tuesday's meeting was
to clarify some ambiguities remaining
in Mosher's appeal, but after the
meeting, Mosher said the University
now appears to be investigating his
use of research funds received while
in China. He also said he is "upset
that it has taken the president of
Stanford this long to make a deci

sion" on his case.
Mosher said his attorney wrote to
Kennedy on Wednesday, asking for a
date on the decision and suggesting
that three to four weeks from now
would be an appropriate time.
Denying charges that he himself
has delayed procedures more than
once, Mosher said, "Even given the
complexity of the case, there's no jus
tification for the delay that has taken
place already."
The only delay Mosher and his le
gal counsel, the San Francisco firm of
Melvin Belli, made came in October
1983, when they requested two
months to file an appeal instead of
the usual 30 days, Mosher said.
Kennedy refused to speak with The
Daily, referring all inquiries about the
case to Bob Beyers, director of Uni
versity News Service.
After consulting with the Univer
sity Legal Office, Beyers said the
University expects a decision in ap
proximately a month.
"There was no new line of investi
gation," Beyers said, referring to
Mosher's charge that the University is
now inquiring about his use of re
search funds. "Mosher was asked

questions deriving entirely from the
existing record in his case."
Mosher said that during Tuesday's
meeting, Kennedy "spent perhaps 45
minutes on the specific use of re
search funds." Mosher said he thinks
this indicates the opening of a new
area of investigation. "I see no other
explanation for the fact that Kennedy
spent so much time discussing some
thing which has not been part of the
investigation."
Mosher received a grant from the
Hoover Institution for $1,000 and
one from the National Endowment
for the Humanities for $9,500. The
funds were "intended for the pur

chase of camera and lens and a great
deal of film" and to hire a research
assistant to photograph more than
20,000 documents, according to
Mosher.
"I accounted for those grants in
1981," Mosher said. At that time,
there were "no questions raised," he
said.
According to Mosher, the letter
sent by his attorney to Kennedy on
Wednesday also asks if there is an
allegation that Mosher misused re
search funds.
Mosher said he has been accused of
smuggling, bribery and importing se
cret documents, among other things,
but never of misusing research
money.
If such a charge is pending, the
Stanford Judicial Charter dictates

that he be informed of the matter un
der investigation; otherwise, the Uni
versity cannot investigate, according
to Mosher.
Investigating without informing
Mosher "would implicitly violate the
guidelines for student academic
procedures," he said.
Because the case is an appeal
process, Kennedy is supposed to de
termine whether or not the decision
to terminate Mosher's doctoral can
didacy is reasonable, given the previ
ously discussed facts and procedures,
Mosher said.
It is a "violation at this point ... to
move beyond these and then conduct
a new investigation," he said. Ken
nedy was "asking questions that had
not been raised by the Anthropology
Department," Mosher said.

"I don't know if this was an act of
delay or desperation or what,"
Mosher added.
The Anthropology Department's
decision to expel Mosher has been
upheld in review by the dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences,
following the unanimous recommen
dation of a three-member advisory
panel, and by the dean of Graduate
Studies and Research.
Mosher has blamed his expulsion
on a Taiwan press article he wrote,
documenting forced abortions in
China, and on "slanderous" allega
tions by his former wife, Maggie So,
according to University News Ser
vice.
However, the still-unreleased in
vestigating committee report on

which the faculty vote was based said,
"We cannot judge this act (of
publication) to be misconduct . . . be
cause we believe that Mosher" s right
to publicize what he chooses is
protected by the right to freedom of
speech," Mosher said.
Ever since his termination, Mosher
has threatened legal action. However,
he said yesterday that he is "going to
exhaust all available internal reme
dies" before resorting to external
means.
Mosher's dissertation, complete
since spring of 1982, needs three
signatures in order for him to receive
his doctorate, according to Mosher.
Since the controversy began, Mos
her has been writing books and lec
turing, he said.

search funds." Mosher said he thinks
this indicates the opening of a new
area of investigation. "I see no other
explanation for the fact that Kennedy
spent so much time discussing some
thing which has not been part of the
investigation."
Mosher received a grant from the
Hoover Institution for $1,000 and
one from the National Endowment
for the Humanities for $9,500. The
funds were "intended for the pur

chase of camera and lens and a great
deal of film" and to hire a research
assistant to photograph more than
20,000 documents, according to
Mosher.
"I accounted for those grants in
1981," Mosher said. At that time,
there were "no questions raised," he
said.
According to Mosher, the letter
sent by his attorney to Kennedy on
Wednesday also asks if there is an
allegation that Mosher misused re
search funds.
Mosher said he has been accused of
smuggling, bribery and importing se
cret documents, among other things,
but never of misusing research
money.
If such a charge is pending, the
Stanford Judicial Charter dictates

that he be informed of the matter un
der investigation; otherwise, the Uni
versity cannot investigate, according
to Mosher.
Investigating without informing
Mosher "would implicitly violate the
guidelines for student academic
procedures," he said.
Because the case is an appeal
process, Kennedy is supposed to de
termine whether or not the decision
to terminate Mosher's doctoral can
didacy is reasonable, given the previ
ously discussed facts and procedures,
Mosher said.
It is a "violation at this point ... to
move beyond these and then conduct
a new investigation," he said. Ken
nedy was "asking questions that had
not been raised by the Anthropology
Department," Mosher said.

"I don't know if this was an act of
delay or desperation or what,"
Mosher added.
The Anthropology Department's
decision to expel Mosher has been
upheld in review by the dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences,
following the unanimous recommen
dation of a three-member advisory
panel, and by the dean of Graduate
Studies and Research.
Mosher has blamed his expulsion
on a Taiwan press article he wrote,
documenting forced abortions in
China, and on "slanderous" allega
tions by his former wife, Maggie So,
according to University News Ser
vice.
However, the still-unreleased in
vestigating committee report on

which the faculty vote was based said,
"We cannot judge this act (of
publication) to be misconduct . . . be
cause we believe that Mosher" s right
to publicize what he chooses is
protected by the right to freedom of
speech," Mosher said.
Ever since his termination, Mosher
has threatened legal action. However,
he said yesterday that he is "going to
exhaust all available internal reme
dies" before resorting to external
means.
Mosher's dissertation, complete
since spring of 1982, needs three
signatures in order for him to receive
his doctorate, according to Mosher.
Since the controversy began, Mos
her has been writing books and lec
turing, he said.
Steven Mosher, a former Stanford
doctoral candidate in anthropology,
charged the University with opening
a new line of inquiry and with taking
an inordinate amount of time to reach
a decision on his case. The charge fol
lowed a Tuesday meeting with Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy.
Mosher was dismissed from the
Anthropology Department's doctoral
program on Feb. 24, 1983, by an 11-
0 vote of the department's faculty.
The faculty said he engaged in
"illegal and seriously unethical con
duct" while in China and that he
"seriously endangered his research
subjects." In May 1984, Kennedy in
formed Mosher that he agreed with
that decision, but offered Mosher the
opportunity to supplement his record
as part of the appeal process.
According to University officials,
the purpose of Tuesday's meeting was
to clarify some ambiguities remaining
in Mosher's appeal, but after the
meeting, Mosher said the University
now appears to be investigating his
use of research funds received while
in China. He also said he is "upset
that it has taken the president of
Stanford this long to make a deci

sion" on his case.
Mosher said his attorney wrote to
Kennedy on Wednesday, asking for a
date on the decision and suggesting
that three to four weeks from now
would be an appropriate time.
Denying charges that he himself
has delayed procedures more than
once, Mosher said, "Even given the
complexity of the case, there's no jus
tification for the delay that has taken
place already."
The only delay Mosher and his le
gal counsel, the San Francisco firm of
Melvin Belli, made came in October
1983, when they requested two
months to file an appeal instead of
the usual 30 days, Mosher said.
Kennedy refused to speak with The
Daily, referring all inquiries about the
case to Bob Beyers, director of Uni
versity News Service.
After consulting with the Univer
sity Legal Office, Beyers said the
University expects a decision in ap
proximately a month.
"There was no new line of investi
gation," Beyers said, referring to
Mosher's charge that the University is
now inquiring about his use of re
search funds. "Mosher was asked
