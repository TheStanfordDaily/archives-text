# Mosher meets with Kennedy

Steven Mosher, a former Stanford
doctoral candidate in anthropology,
charged the University with opening
a new line of inquiry and with taking
an inordinate amount of time to reach
a decision on his case. The charge fol
lowed a Tuesday meeting with Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy.
Mosher was dismissed from the
Anthropology Department's doctoral
program on Feb. 24, 1983, by an 11-
0 vote of the department's faculty.
The faculty said he engaged in
"illegal and seriously unethical con
duct" while in China and that he
"seriously endangered his research
subjects." In May 1984, Kennedy in
formed Mosher that he agreed with
that decision, but offered Mosher the
opportunity to supplement his record
as part of the appeal process.
According to University officials,
the purpose of Tuesday's meeting was
to clarify some ambiguities remaining
in Mosher's appeal, but after the
meeting, Mosher said the University
now appears to be investigating his
use of research funds received while
in China. He also said he is "upset
that it has taken the president of
Stanford this long to make a deci

sion" on his case.
Mosher said his attorney wrote to
Kennedy on Wednesday, asking for a
date on the decision and suggesting
that three to four weeks from now
would be an appropriate time.
Denying charges that he himself
has delayed procedures more than
once, Mosher said, "Even given the
complexity of the case, there's no jus
tification for the delay that has taken
place already."
The only delay Mosher and his le
gal counsel, the San Francisco firm of
Melvin Belli, made came in October
1983, when they requested two
months to file an appeal instead of
the usual 30 days, Mosher said.
Kennedy refused to speak with The
Daily, referring all inquiries about the
case to Bob Beyers, director of Uni
versity News Service.
After consulting with the Univer
sity Legal Office, Beyers said the
University expects a decision in ap
proximately a month.
"There was no new line of investi
gation," Beyers said, referring to
Mosher's charge that the University is
now inquiring about his use of re
search funds. "Mosher was asked
