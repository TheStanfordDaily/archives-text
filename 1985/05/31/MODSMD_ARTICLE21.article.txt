## Card set to face Miami in Omaha 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
OMAHA, Neb. — After arriving yesterday af
ternoon at Eppley Air Field here, the Stanford
baseball team gathered anxiously around the
baggage carousel, waiting for its luggage.
What was the now top-ranked Cardinal worried
about?
The Miami Hurricanes, Stanford's opponent in
tomorrow's 2 p.m. PDT (ESPN, KZSU 90.1 FM)
College World Series opener?
No.
The Oklahoma State Cowboys, the team many
consider the tournament favorite with its .342 bat
ting average?
No.
What had the Cardinal concerned was the order
in which the bags came out of the chute.
On every roadtrip, the team has a pool — the
players whose bags come up first and last win.
Pete Stanicek's No. 7 bag came up first,
while seniors Jeff Ballard and Rick Lundblade
remained winless for their careers.
Yes, this team is loose. But it is also talented, ex
perienced and determined. As Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said after Monday's 7-1 win over
Pepperdine put Stanford in the Series, "The first
time you go, you're just happy to be there. But now
that we've been there a couple of times, we want to
win it."
The Cardinal will be making its third trip to the
Series in the last four years. In both 1982 and 1983,
Stanford finished fifth, winning one game and
losing two each year. Stanford's best Series finish
came in 1967, when the Cardinal came in third.
The top hitter on that team was an All-America
first baseman named Mark Marquess.
Marquess thinks Stanford's previous appear
ances will help the team this time. "We're an expe
rienced College World Series team with Ballard,
Stanicek and (John) Verducci all having been there
twice," he said. "The key for us is to throw the ball
over the plate and play good defense."

Verducci agreed. "We have to throw it over the
plate, catch it and hit it,"he said.
If the Series comes down to who can throw
strikes and play defense, Stanford should be in
good shape. Cardinal pitchers have allowed only
3.4 walks per game — the lowest figure among the
eight tournament teams.
South Carolina Coach June Raines calls Stanford
a co-favorite with Okalahoma State because the
Cardinal is "one of the finest ballclubs
defensively."
"I really like our chances. We've got the type of
team that does well in the Series," said Ballard, to
morrow's starting pitcher. "We have offensive
depth and good defense."

Stanford certainly does have offensive depth.
Ruben Amaro has the lowest batting average of
any Cardinal regular, but at .290, he is no easy out.
Marquess can always count on offensive produc
tion from Lundblade (.402, 24 homers, 89 RBIs)
and Mark Davis (.351,13 homers, 65 RBIs), but in
last weekend's West I regional, the hot bats
belonged to John Ramos and Mike Deßenon.
Ramos, the tournament MVP, was 8-for-15 for
the weekend, including a two-run single in the
ninth inning on Saturday that beat Nebraska, 9-8.
Deßenon's 4-for-12 performance earned him a
spot on the all-tournament team. His biggest hit
also came against the Cornhuskers — a three-run,
pinch-hit homer that gave Stanford a 7-5 lead in
the seventh.
Although the team thinks it is capable of winning
the whole tournament, it knows it is in for a diffi

cult task. "Look for a lot of tough games,' Ver
ducci said. "You can pretty much throw the
rankings out."
"There're all damn good ballclubs, Lundblade
said. "There's no team you want to play in the first
round — they're all tough."
In No. 6 Miami, Stanford has definitely found a
tough first-round opponent. The Hurricanes won
the Atlantic Regional by rallying from a 9-5 deficit
in the last three innings to beat Florida, 12-9.
According to Miami Coach Ron Fraser, such
gutty performances have been the key to the Hur
ricanes' season. "We're a pesky kind of club,"he
said. ' We're always coming at you.''
This peskiness makes up for what Fraser believes
is a lack of talent. "In past years, I would have
rattled off some pretty impressive statistics," he
said. "If someone had told me in January that we'd
be here, I'd have said you're crazy."
Fraser may be poor-mouthing his team a bit.
Miami does have talent, and it certainly has some
impressive statistics. The Hurricanes' leading hitter
is third baseman Jon Leake, who is batting .348
with 54 RBIs.
With only 63 homers in 74 games, Miami doesn't
have a lot of offensive firepower. It's biggest long
ball threat is Greg Ellena, who has hit 11 homers in
only 91 at-bats.
The Hurricanes use speed to make up for what
they lack in power. Miami has stolen 217 bases this
year. The top thief is leadoff man Kelvin James,
who has stolen 45 bases in 54 attempts.
You may not see an offensive explosion from
Miami, but chances are you won't feel one from its
opponents, either. The Hurricanes' pitching staff
gives up less than one hit per inning and has a
stingy 3.76 ERA.
Against Stanford, Fraser plans to use either Stes
sen Najer (9-0, 3.12 ERA), Bob O'Brien (8-4,
4.35) or Alain Pateneude (9-2, 4.64). The Miami
skipper has decided not to use starting ace Dan


Jill Gilbert/Daily
Cardinal third baseman Ruben Amaro has the lowest batting average of
any Cardinal regular, but at .290, he's no easy out.
Davies (15-1, 2.63). Davies pitched
three innings I uesday against
Florida.
According to Fraser, reliever Ric
Raether "has been one of the keys to
our season." Raether, who picked up
the win in the comeback against the
Gators, has a 5-2 record to go along
with a 1.57 ERA and 19 saves.
Card notes
When asked by the Omaha World-

Herald to pick the series favorite, the
coaches mentioned Oklahoma State
more than any other team. Marquess
chose Arkansas. "They're the hottest
club,"he said.
South Carolina and Arkansas play
the tournament's first game today at
2 p.m. The 4 p.m. contest matches the
Cowboys and Mississippi State. After
Stanford takes on Miami tomorrow,
Arizona plays Texas at 4 p.m.

rankings out."
"There're all damn good ballclubs, Lundblade
said. "There's no team you want to play in the first
round — they're all tough."
In No. 6 Miami, Stanford has definitely found a
tough first-round opponent. The Hurricanes won
the Atlantic Regional by rallying from a 9-5 deficit
in the last three innings to beat Florida, 12-9.
According to Miami Coach Ron Fraser, such
gutty performances have been the key to the Hur
ricanes' season. "We're a pesky kind of club,"he
said. ' We're always coming at you.''
This peskiness makes up for what Fraser believes
is a lack of talent. "In past years, I would have
rattled off some pretty impressive statistics," he
said. "If someone had told me in January that we'd
be here, I'd have said you're crazy."
Fraser may be poor-mouthing his team a bit.
Miami does have talent, and it certainly has some
impressive statistics. The Hurricanes' leading hitter
is third baseman Jon Leake, who is batting .348
with 54 RBIs.
With only 63 homers in 74 games, Miami doesn't
have a lot of offensive firepower. It's biggest long
ball threat is Greg Ellena, who has hit 11 homers in
only 91 at-bats.
The Hurricanes use speed to make up for what
they lack in power. Miami has stolen 217 bases this
year. The top thief is leadoff man Kelvin James,
who has stolen 45 bases in 54 attempts.
You may not see an offensive explosion from
Miami, but chances are you won't feel one from its
opponents, either. The Hurricanes' pitching staff
gives up less than one hit per inning and has a
stingy 3.76 ERA.
Against Stanford, Fraser plans to use either Stes
sen Najer (9-0, 3.12 ERA), Bob O'Brien (8-4,
4.35) or Alain Pateneude (9-2, 4.64). The Miami
skipper has decided not to use starting ace Dan

Cardinal third baseman Ruben Amaro has the lowest batting average of
any Cardinal regular, but at .290, he's no easy out.
Davies (15-1, 2.63). Davies pitched
three innings I uesday against
Florida.
According to Fraser, reliever Ric
Raether "has been one of the keys to
our season." Raether, who picked up
the win in the comeback against the
Gators, has a 5-2 record to go along
with a 1.57 ERA and 19 saves.

When asked by the Omaha World-

Herald to pick the series favorite, the
coaches mentioned Oklahoma State
more than any other team. Marquess
chose Arkansas. "They're the hottest
club,"he said.
South Carolina and Arkansas play
the tournament's first game today at
2 p.m. The 4 p.m. contest matches the
Cowboys and Mississippi State. After
Stanford takes on Miami tomorrow,
Arizona plays Texas at 4 p.m.
In the final national poll. West 1
Regional runner-up Pepperdine is
No. 9 — the highest ranking among
teams not in the series.
OMAHA, Neb. — After arriving yesterday af
ternoon at Eppley Air Field here, the Stanford
baseball team gathered anxiously around the
baggage carousel, waiting for its luggage.
What was the now top-ranked Cardinal worried
about?
The Miami Hurricanes, Stanford's opponent in
tomorrow's 2 p.m. PDT (ESPN, KZSU 90.1 FM)
College World Series opener?
No.
The Oklahoma State Cowboys, the team many
consider the tournament favorite with its .342 bat
ting average?
No.
What had the Cardinal concerned was the order
in which the bags came out of the chute.
On every roadtrip, the team has a pool — the
players whose bags come up first and last win.
Pete Stanicek's No. 7 bag came up first,
while seniors Jeff Ballard and Rick Lundblade
remained winless for their careers.
Yes, this team is loose. But it is also talented, ex
perienced and determined. As Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said after Monday's 7-1 win over
Pepperdine put Stanford in the Series, "The first
time you go, you're just happy to be there. But now
that we've been there a couple of times, we want to
win it."
The Cardinal will be making its third trip to the
Series in the last four years. In both 1982 and 1983,
Stanford finished fifth, winning one game and
losing two each year. Stanford's best Series finish
came in 1967, when the Cardinal came in third.
The top hitter on that team was an All-America
first baseman named Mark Marquess.
Marquess thinks Stanford's previous appear
ances will help the team this time. "We're an expe
rienced College World Series team with Ballard,
Stanicek and (John) Verducci all having been there
twice," he said. "The key for us is to throw the ball
over the plate and play good defense."

Verducci agreed. "We have to throw it over the
plate, catch it and hit it,"he said.
If the Series comes down to who can throw
strikes and play defense, Stanford should be in
good shape. Cardinal pitchers have allowed only
3.4 walks per game — the lowest figure among the
eight tournament teams.
South Carolina Coach June Raines calls Stanford
a co-favorite with Okalahoma State because the
Cardinal is "one of the finest ballclubs
defensively."
"I really like our chances. We've got the type of
team that does well in the Series," said Ballard, to
morrow's starting pitcher. "We have offensive
depth and good defense."

Stanford certainly does have offensive depth.
Ruben Amaro has the lowest batting average of
any Cardinal regular, but at .290, he is no easy out.
Marquess can always count on offensive produc
tion from Lundblade (.402, 24 homers, 89 RBIs)
and Mark Davis (.351,13 homers, 65 RBIs), but in
last weekend's West I regional, the hot bats
belonged to John Ramos and Mike Deßenon.
Ramos, the tournament MVP, was 8-for-15 for
the weekend, including a two-run single in the
ninth inning on Saturday that beat Nebraska, 9-8.
Deßenon's 4-for-12 performance earned him a
spot on the all-tournament team. His biggest hit
also came against the Cornhuskers — a three-run,
pinch-hit homer that gave Stanford a 7-5 lead in
the seventh.
Although the team thinks it is capable of winning
the whole tournament, it knows it is in for a diffi

cult task. "Look for a lot of tough games,' Ver
ducci said. "You can pretty much throw the
rankings out."
"There're all damn good ballclubs, Lundblade
