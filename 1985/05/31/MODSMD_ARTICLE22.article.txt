# You'll have to go mobile to see Cardinal baseball

### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
For students unable to make the trip to Omaha, Neb.,
for the College World Series that begins this weekend,
there is some good news — they will be able to watch the
games. ESPN, the cable sports network, will carry every
game of the CWS beginning this afternoon at 2 p.m. with
the South Carolina-Arkansas contest.
The bad news is that the Stanford campus, as most
know, is not wired for cable. Neither is Palo Alto or
Menlo Park. Those wanting to watch tomorrow's first
round game between Stanford and Miami (Fla.) at 2 p.m.
will have to make a short road trip.
For those who stay on campus, KZSU-Radio (90.1 FM)
will be in Omaha for live coverage of all Stanford games.
David Fischer and Chris Fialko will handle the broadcast
ing duties.
While covering the entire Series, ESPN will carry four
of the 1 5 games on tape delay because of commitments to

the United States Football League. Neither of Stanford's
first two games will be affected.
Should Stanford win tomorrow, the Cardinal would
play the winner of tomorrow's Texas-Arizona game Tues
day at 5 p.m. If Stanford loses, it will face the loser of that
game Sunday at 5 p.m.
The nearest communities that do have cable are Red
wood City to the north and Mountain View to the south.
One Redwood City establishment that is expecting a
crowd for tomorrow's game is the Fifth Quarter, on
Woodside Road. The family restaurant has two large
screen televisions and can accommodate more than 200
customers. Pizza and burgers will be available as well as
beer and wine. Students under 21 are welcome, but will
not be allowed to purchase alcohol.
