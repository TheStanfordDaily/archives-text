# Card tracksters compete at championships
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Staff sportswriter 
As NCAA qualifying events con
tinue for the Stanford men's and
women's track teams in Austin,
lexas, so do the 20-mile-per-hour
winds and the 90-degree heat that
have combined to slow down this
year's times in many running events.
Stanford s times in events ranging
from the 400-meter hurdles up to the
10,000 meters, unfortunately, have
done little to turn any heads.
Sophomore Pam Board, coming off

hei season's best performance in the
400 hurdles at the Western Collegiate
Athletic Association championships,
may have felt the effects of difficult
conditions while running her qualify
ing heat, coming in a disappointing
3V2 seconds slower than her personal
best time.
If Board didn't point to the heat as
an adverse factor, Cardinal senior El
len Lyons at least should consider it.
Running her speciality, the 10,000
meters, Lyons could only manage

11th place in the finals, with an unof
ficial time over 36 minutes — the
point where the NCAA timers
stopped recording.
In the events where movement was
kept to a minimum, the Stanford rep
resentatives fared a little better. In
the men's hammer, Cardinal seniors
Sean Pickering and Brian Masterson,
an impressive one-two combo that
consistently produced big points for
the Stanford men, finished seventh
and eighth after the qualifying round.
Pickering threw for 218 feet, while

Masterson recorded a 214-foot
throw. Both tosses fell short of previ
ous bests.
The march of sub-personal bests
continued its steady course in the
women's discus. Karen Nickerson
reeled off a heave of 171-7, good
enough for sixth place in the qualify
ing competition.
Both Cardinal teams are looking
for strong performances out of their
high jumpers.
For the Stanford men, Brian Mar
shall, who cleared 7-3V2 earlier in the
season, will try to jump into the
NCAA finals competition today.
Freshman Lisa Bernhagen will also
try to qualify, earlier in the after
noon today. Bernhagen is the only
woman to have jumped over 6-feet in
Stanford history.
Without doubt, the strongest
remaining Cardinal hopeful for either
team is Regina Jacobs, who will run
her first race in the 1,500 meters
today. Jacobs, the school record
holder in this event, has a legitimate
shot at a top five finish, according to
Stanford Asst. Coach Dave Wollman.
The Cardial men's team also has a
1,500-meter representative in senior
Jeff Atkinson, who qualified
for the NCAAs during the final week
of the season.
The Stanford women's final hope
for NCAA team points falls in the
strong hands of shotputter Pam
Dukes, who has posted a throw of
more than 50 feet.
Last year, the Stanford women's
track team finished third in the
NCAAs and would have been a more
legitimate threat this year if not for
the onslaught of injuries that has
swept through the middle distance
lineup, claiming previous NCAA
champions such as Ceci Hopp and
Alison Wiley.
