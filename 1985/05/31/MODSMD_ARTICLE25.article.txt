EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) —
Record-setters Wayne Gretzky, Paul Cof
fey and Jari Kurri ignited Edmonton to an
8-3 rout of the Philadelphia Flyers last
night that brought the Oilers their second
consecutive Stanley Cup.
The Oilers, who won the National
Hockey League championship series in
five games and established a playoff mark
with 16 straight victories at home,
dominated the undermanned Flyers from
the outset.
It was the second consecutive year that
the Oilers had rallied from a first-game
loss to win four in a row and take the cup.
Led by the magic of Gretzky, the NHL's
brightest star, and Coffey, the game's most
prolific defenseman, the Oilers jumped to

a 4-1 lead after one period and 7-1 after
two en route to the most one-sided Cup
clinching victory in league history.
Gretzky, who was awarded the Conn
Smythe Trophy as the most valuable
player in the playoffs, had one goal and
three assists and finished the playoffs with
17 goals, 30 assists and 47 points, all
records for the 24-year-old center who
makes a living rewriting the record book.
Coffey contributed two goals and one as
sist for a total of 12 goals, 25 assists and 37
points, all marks for a defenseman.
Kurri, who got the Oilers started with a
goal at 4:54 against a shaky Bob Froese —
who replaced injured regular netminder
Pclle Lindbergh — finished the playoffs

with 19 goals, tying the record set in 1976
by Philadelphia's Reggie Leach. Kurri had
three assists Thursday night.
The frustrated Flyers' Dave Brown
sparked a brawl with 4:38 remaining when
he fought with Edmonton's Kevin McClel
land. Brad Marsh also went at it with Ed
monton's Don Jackson and referee Bryan
Lewis handed out 79 minutes in penalties
for the fisticuffs as the game was delayed
15 minutes.
The Flyers won the first game of the
finals at home, then lost the next four. As
the championship series progressed,
Philadelphia's injured list increased and, at
the end, included leading goal-scorer Tim
Kerr, top defenseman Brad McCrimmon

and Lindbergh, the NHL's winningest
goalie this season.
Edmonton goalie Grant Fuhr estab
lished yet another playoff record with his
15th postseason victory. Fuhr was the
starting and winning goalie in every Oilers'
victory this spring.
And for the second straight game, Fuhr
stopped a penalty shot. In Game 4, he
made a pad save on Ron Sutter. This time,
his sliding skate save robbed Dave Poulin,
who had been pulled to ice by Coffey
during a breakaway.
It was the fourth unsuccessful penalty
shot in Stanley Cup finals history and the
fourth time Fuhr has been victorious
during his career in such situations.
