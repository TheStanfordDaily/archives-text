# Card sailors to compete at nationals next week

The Stanford sailing team will travel to Norfolk, Va., to
compete in the Intercollegiate Yacht Racing Association
National Dinghy Championships Tuesday through next
Friday. The championships are "the main event of the
year for collegiate sailing," according to Stanford Coach
Joe Petrucci.
Sixteen collegiate teams will be competing in the cham
pionships, to be held at Old Dominion. Although Petrucci
predicts that USC, Boston University and King's Point
Service Academy will be the top three teams in the run
ning for the team title, he is quick to point out that there is
really no way to predict who the victor will be.
"There are at least 12 teams that could win the cham
pionships," Petrucci said. "Stanford, Navy, Brown,
Tulane, Texas and Charleston all have very talented
teams and could easily put a lot of pressure on the 'top
teams."
USC is considered by many to be the top contender for
the title. Sailing for the Trojans is one of the nation's most
experienced sailors, Olympian John Shadden.
According to Petrucci, the Cardinal's goal in Virginia is
to be one of the top five teams, but with the competition
as stiff as it is this year, that will take hard work and crea
tive sailing on the Cardinal's part.
"This year's championships should be more competitive
than any of the past four years," Petrucci said. "With so
many sailors coming back from Olympic campaigns, the
level of talent and experience at the championships is
going to be amazing."
Stanford will be traveling with a team of sailors that has
talent and experience of its own. With seven sailors travel
ing for the Cardinal, Petrucci says that Stanford has all
possible skipper-crew weight ranges completely covered.
"We are going to Virginia with a very versatile traveling
team that is capable of responding to any wind we might
encounter," Petrucci said.
Competing for Stanford will be Rich Bergsund, Marika
Fussganger, Tom Kuhnle, Irma Rodriguez, Dan Buck

staff, Liz Egan and Drew Gashler.
The competition will be split into two divisions (A and
B) with 16 races in each division. All 16 teams will com
pete in each race of the championships.
Petrucci said he expects to start Bergsund in the A divi
sion with Fussganger as crew. Bergsund and Fussganger,
sailing partners for more than two years, perform very
steadily together and have shown great amounts of top
notch teamwork, according to Petrucci.
"Rich and Marika have been sailing together so long
that they think alike whenever they are on the water to
gether," Petrucci said. "They complement each other per
fectly."
In the B division, the combinations of skipper and crew
that competete will depend on the wind conditions.
In somewhat strong winds, Kuhnle will most likely start
in the B division, with Rodriquez as crew.
"Kuhnle is a very steady sailor and a quick learner, but
his size is always a factor in determining whether or not he
will compete," Petrucci said."Tom is lean, but his overall
size is larger than that of the normal skipper."
In lighter winds, Buckstaff will sail for the Cardinal in
the B division, most likely with Egan as crew. Buckstaff, a
walk-on freshman, is the surprise of the year for the team,
according to Petrucci.
Also sailing for Stanford will be Gashler, whom
Petrucci plans to to use as crew in heavy weather.
Although the Cardinal is used to sailing in much heavier
winds than are expected at Norfolk next week, Petrucci is
certain that his team will be able to adjust well to any
weather it encounters.
"We do have a very 'heavy' team, compared to most,
and we are used to much windier sailing conditions, but I
know that our sailors are experienced enought to adjust to
anything," Petrucci said. "If we are lucky enough to get
some heavy winds, we will be lucky, because there are
very few sailors who can sail up to par with [us] in heavy
air."
Light to medium air is expected in Norfolk, with winds
of approximately nine knots in the early afternoon.
