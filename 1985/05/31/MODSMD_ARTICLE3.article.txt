# Senate discusses Hoover study
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior stall writer 
The Faculty Senate opened discussion yesterday
on the senate committee report issued this week on
the relation between the Stanford professoriate and
'the Hoover Institution.
I he report, consisting ol nine proposals, will be
discussed further and voted on at a special meeting
of the senate on June 6.
The problem of governance within the Hoover
Institution "is the issue to be dealt with" in building
better relations. Sociology Prof. Sanford
Dornbusch told the senate in his report. Dornbusch
is chair of the seven-member committee charged by
the senate to investigate the relations between the
University and Hoover.
The committee was created in response to
criticism of the Ward Committee report. The Ward
Committee, chaired by Political Science Prof.
Robert Ward, issued a report in November which
concluded that strengthening the ties between the
University and Hoover could result in an improve
ment of the social sciences programs here.
"The centralized governance at Hoover encour
ages the belief that their/ titution may be engaging
in political advocacy," the Dornbusch committee
report states. "Faculty observers fear that ideology
could play an improper role in decisions at
Hoover " The report outlines changes in appoint
ment procedures at Hoover that could lead to ap
proval of senior scholars at Hoover serving also as
professors who conduct research in the University.
While both Hoover and Stanford have done
"well within themselves... it is the points of inter
section of contact that have proven abrasive,"
Dornbusch said.

"We think that the problems are very deep and
the situation is very real," he continued. "We don't
believe that we (the committee) arc all-wise. . . .
We are pointing to lines of action."
Five of the nine proposals outlined address mat
ters that the committee believes could be acted on
immediately. Dornbusch stressed the importance
of the senate's not passing each proposal sepa
rately, but accepting or rejecting the proposal as a
package.
Dornbusch said the committee is not encourag
ing divorce. "We think it's a dumb idea," he said,
but he did not rule it out completely. "We think it
should be reconsidered if nothing gets done.
"The Hoover Institution would lose much more
from separation than the rest of the University," he
added.
Most of the discussion yesterday focused on the
"institutional ideology" of Hoover. Dornbusch
said there is no significant evidence of a problem of
"institutional ideology," although many faculty
members interviewed by the committee alluded to
one. He did say that there is a possibility that an
"ideological slant" or bias does exist in some pro
grams at Hoover while not in others.
Many faculty members, such as Microbiology
Prof. Leon Rosenberg, also questioned what the
advantages were in maintaining University ties with
Hoover. The committee cited the library, the
talented people at Hoover, the intellectual ex
change and the joint conferences as examples of
the advantages of Stanford-Hoover ties.
Dornbusch warned senate members not to
"think those things that [you] want will stay and
those things that [you] don't want will go." He
added, however, that "if the current situation

should be the long-term future" then the Univer
sity should not not rule out separation.
Unlike the senate's reaction to the Ward Report,
most faculty members who spoke praised the com
mittee for its thoroughness and comprehension of
the root of the problem.
The committee was able to "connect those
suspicions (about Hoover ideology) to some very
profound issues," said Law Prof. Robert Mnookin.
"The caution at the end ... is a useful cau
tion. ... I think they go to the core of your report,"
Mnookin said. The report states that "it would be
unreasonable to expect that the University will
grant Hoover members a large role in University
affairs unless Hoover allows other members of the
University a larger role in Hoover affairs. . . . Time
alone will not resolve the problems."
"I guess the most admirable thing 1 could do for
this report is to refrain from endorsing it," Ward
said. He added that the new report proposes similar
measures to what he would have suggested, if he
had been charged to do so.
Ward added that "gradualism" is the key idea
emphasized. "It is going to take time and there is
no doubt about that," he said.
"It is difficult to categorize the attitudes of the
Hoover Institution," Dornbusch said. "The
Hoover Institution is not a monolithic
structure. . . . Some members will support these
recommendations."
He also stressed that the faculty "has a key role
to play" in the implementation of the proposals.
"Faculty endorsement matters," he said.
Dornbusch also assured the faculty members that
the report "is not an expression ot
political viewpoints" through
sociological jargon. English Prof.
Bliss Carnochan. a committee mem
ber, said the entire report was agreed
upon by all committee members.
"What we agree on is what we have
written," Carnochan said.
The nine proposals can be sum
marized as follows:
• "When any proposed appointment
as a senior fellow is submitted, the
president should appoint a formally
constituted advisory committee. This
committee should be provided with
documentation comparable to that
for professorial appointments, and
have adequate time for review." The
president would have the primary re
sponsibility.
• "Hoover should redefine the ranks
of the senior fellow, senior research
fellow and research fellow. A district
category for senior scholars should be
defined." Hoover would have pri
mary responsibility.
• "The Academic Council should
review criteria for various kinds of
professorial association with depart
ments, schools and research centers
— including 'joint,' 'affiliated,'
'courtesy,' 'consulting,' 'visiting,' and
similar titles. The Academic Council
should delineate the rights and duties
associated with each term and rank.
Appointments for members of the
Hoover Institution should be consis
tent with that policy." The primary
responsibility would go to the Aca
demic Council.
• "The president, with advice from
the director of the University Libra
ries and the director of the Hoover
Institution, should appoint a commit
tee charged to find ways to reduce

barriers to communication and
cooperation between the Hoover Li
brary and the Stanford University Li
braries." The president has primary
responsibility.
• "Make joint appointments in which
the appointee has responsibilities in
both the Hoover Institution and a
school or department only under the
following conditions: Ihe appoint
ment serves long-term goals of both
units, the appointment stands on its
own merits, unaffected by considera
tions of reciprocity, and the search is
a genuine collaboration between the
units." The primary responsibility
would be with Hoover and the school
or department.
• "Make appointments of senior
scholars subject to review by the Ad
visory Board and provost prior to
submission to the president and
Board of Trustees. Give persons
reviewed favorably the rank of pro
fessor at the Hoover Institution
(research), accompanied by Aca
demic Council membership and a
continuing appointment." Primary
responsibility would be with Hoover,
the provost and the council.
• "Senior scholars should participate
more systematically in appointment
and promotion decisions concerning
senior researchers at Hoover, as well
as in decisions concerning major
aspects of the Hoover research
agenda." The primary responsibility
would be with Hoover.
• "Increase in communication and in
teraction between the Hoover Insti
tution and the rest of the University."
The president and Hoover would
have the primary responsibilities.
• "The Herbert Hoover Foundation
and the Hoover Board of Overseers
should assume only an advisory role
in the selection of the Hoover direc
tor." The Board of Trustees and
Hoover would have the primary re
sponsibilities.
