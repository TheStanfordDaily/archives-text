## Guild serves luncheons to benefit hospital 
### 
Allied Arts Guild Tearoom
95 Arbor Road at Cambridge Avenue
Menlo Park
324-2588
Hidden on Cambridge Avenue directly behind the
Stanford Children s Hospital is a small community of
buildings constructed in colonial Spanish design. Open to
the public, the collection of artists' shops and tearoom are
a California showpiece that should be visited at least once
during your time at Stanford.
The Allied Arts Guild stands on a small portion of what
was once the vast Rancho de las Pulgas land grant from
the King of Spain to the Presidio of San Francisco in the
early 1800s. In 1929, three-and-a-half acres of this prop
erty were bought by Mr. and Mrs. Garfield Merner as a site
for a crafts guild to be modeled after those in Europe.
The original barn and sheep sheds built in the early
1900s were preserved, and have since been joined by
buildings to house the shops and tearoom. The latter are
operated by the guild for the benefit of the Stanford
Children's Hospital, a world-famous center for the treat
ment of children suffering from life-threatening diseases
such as cancer and cystic fibrosis.
The rooms and gardens are exquisitely decorated with
tiles and objects of art from Spain, Tunis and Morocco.
The gardens, reminiscent of those in Granada, were
planned by Mrs. Merner and named in the Spanish man
ner: The "Cervantes Court" is the inner court, and
features a mural of Cervantes dedicating his masterpiece,
Don Quixote. The paths are paved with stones from San
Francisquito Creek, and courtyard tiles adorn walls and
benches.
Inside, wooden beams and stone floors lend to the
Spanish style, and beautiful flower arrangements
prepared by guild members add color and their own
beauty to the environment.
The members of the Allied Arts are all women who
donate at least four hours each week to the organization.
The commitment is a demanding one, for it takes time
from many busy work schedules. At one time, Stanford
women contributed their services as members of the
Junior Auxiliary. Currently there are approximately 250
active members, none of whom are Stanford students.
However, the guild hopes to attract students interested in
public service work.
The origin of the guild's work began in 1932, when the
Merner's interest in the Hospital prompted them to invite
the Palo Alto Auxiliary to maintain a lunchroom at the
Guild, with the proceeds to go to the Hospital. The mem
bers of the volunteer group began the operation of the
Allied Arts Lunch and Tearoom by preparing food in
their own homes and carrying it to the Guild to serve.
Today, food is prepared in the modern Guild kitchen on
the premises.
Members choose to either prepare or serve luncheons
and afternoon tea. The product of their dedication and

hard work is reflected in the tearoom's success; both lo
cals and tourists, enjoying the pleasant, scenic surround
ings and delicious three-course meals, are quick to make
reservations.
Luncheons feature two selections daily, one of which is
a hot entree, the other a salad. Guests can choose to sit in
one of two rooms inside or in the courtyard.
Recipes vary daily, and by calling ahead one can re
quest a listing of the week's menu. The volunteers them
selves often contribute favorite recipes, and customers
liked the menu items so well that recipe cards are now
sold in the lobby.
Approximately 270 people are seated daily. The meals,
which cost $7 per person, include a beverage, soup of

the day, fresh bread or rolls, the entree and dessert.
Luncheons are served Monday through Saturday from
noon until 2 p.m., and afternoon refreshments are
available Tuesday through Thursday from 2 to 3:30 p.m.
From February through October, the first Monday of the
month is reserved for fashion shows hosted by local stores.
Then, in November and December, breathtaking
Christmas decorations and a warm holiday spirit pervade
this tiny community, drawing record numbers of people.
Once you've finished lunch, for which you would be
wise to reserve a table in advance, you might wander
around the shops and gardens, or even request that you be
included in one of the tours.
The shops are surrounded by lawns full of flowers and

blossoming trees. Everything is delightfully groomed.
Inside the shops you'll find candles, gifts, linens, clothing,
furniture, glasswork and needlework supplies and instruc
tions.
The guild is worth visiting for its beautiful architectural
design and gardens, the delightful lunches in the tearoom,
and because the proceeds are donated to the Children's
Hospital. Both the Traditional Shop, with its fine selection
of antiques, silver, and china, and the tearoom are
operated solely for the benefit of the hospital, and the
contributions received from the organizations are sub
stantial.
