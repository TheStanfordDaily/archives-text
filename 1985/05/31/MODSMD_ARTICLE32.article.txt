Pearl's Oyster Bar
535 Ramona Street
Palo Alto
328-2722
Once you've found a parking spot,
it's free sailing at Pearl's Oyster Bar
on Ramona Street in Palo Alto.
Using Ramona's Pizzeria as a
landmark, the seafood lover can find
Pearl's two doors north in a secluded
courtyard. If you're the traditional
steak-and-potatoes eater, Pearl's is
not the place for you; however, if
you're feeling a bit adventurous, or
simply love seafood. Pearl's is a defi
nite must, or at least a definite possi
bility.
Being in the addled state of mind
that Dead Week promotes in most

Stanford students, we took a little
while to figure out that Pearl's is a
seat-yourself oyster bar. Have faith,
however, Stanfordites: the Cal
Weenie with whom 1 was dining also
had trouble with this seating concept,
and he has already finished his finals.
We opted for the bar itself, but
tables are also provided in the court
yard and inside. At 6:30 p.m., we had
no trouble finding seats, but by 7:30 a
waiting line had formed in the court
yard. Although I was told by the
proprietor that 8:30 is the time to get
the "full flavor" of Pearl's, I would
recommend to all who, like myself,
are not fond of participating in yet
another queue (isn't Maples on Reg
Day bad enough?) to make an effort

to arrive fairly early (before 7).
Another tip from a now
experienced oyster bar patron: read
the menu before sitting down in the
comfortably padded seats at the bar,
especially if your companion(s) and
you are near-sighted. In authentic
New England fashion, the day's menu
is chalked up (in multiple colors) on a
board at the single most difficult spot
to see from the bar. The choice of
food, however, makes it worth the ef
fort to read the menu.
First, the oysters. (They don't call it
an oyster bar for nothing.) There are
about seven different oyster dishes
available, all of which sound wonder
ful. Three dollars will buy three
oysters, and, yes, $6 will buy six

oysters (give or take 50 cents for the
more sophisticated dishes). Ouf man
from Cal decided on the Oysters
Rockefeller (six of them: He's a big
eater), which came on a bed of rock
salt.
Each oyster was baked, then served
on its own half-shell between a layer
of spinach and a layer of parmesan
cheese. (That's spinach on the bot
tom, cheese on top, for all you
neophytes.) "Mmmm," said Ted,
"Num. num." A generous soul, Ted
was kind enough to donate one oyster
to my palate, which found it delec
table indeed.
Despite its name. Pearl's Oyster
Bar does offer more than oysters.
Mussles, trout, snapper and fresh

cracked crab are among the
delicacies, with prices ranging from as
low as $5 to as high as $14 (for the
crab, of course).
I opted for the calamari, which was
available either in a pasta salad, or. as
I ordered, in a vegetable sautee, for
about $7. The dish came with
rice pilaf on the side, and was
quite tasty, with a trace of Chinese
flavoring in the sautee. Having
imposed myself on Ted's oysters, I
politely offered him a piece of pre
cious squid, which he devoured with
gusto. "Mmmm," said Ted, "Num.
num."
Washed down with plenty of
Beck's beer, and with a loaf of fresh
French bread, this dinner left us

feeling quite content. For those
wine lovers among us. Pearl's does
offer wine by the glass and hv the bot
tle. You can also choose from an
amazing assortment of cream sodas,
or, if you're really going yuppie, you
can always order Calistoga water. No
Cokes or Pepsis here.
All in all. Pearl's offers a fine meal
in a very friendly atmosphere. The
cheerful service creates a homey feel,
unspoiled by the occasional outburst
of noise. Pearl's Oyster Bar is cer
tainly worth a try (or two, or three)
for an enjoyable meal at a moderate
price.
