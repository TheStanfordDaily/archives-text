## Theatre Artaud's attempt to innovate kills 'Tokens' 
### AMY FRIEDMAN 
The audience waits outside plague
ridden London of 1665, while the
mood is set by wailing people inside
the "city-gate." Although the "play"
is supposed to start at 8:30 p.m.,
"Tokens, by David Schein, begins
before then as the audience mills
around outside the "city." Audience
movement is one way "Tokens" at
tempts to incorporate new trends in
theater in the familiar format of an
operetta. Every so often, the gate
opens and the crowd funnels onto the
stage. On the set, the actors thread
their way through the spectators who
are standing. As the action moves to
another part of the stage, an usher
shows the audience to bleachers
where they sit for the longest portion
ot the play. I he audience moves
twice more.
The story vaguely follows the Dunn
family as, one by one, the plague af
flicts the family members. There is
Mort, who is the first one to show the
boils associated with the Black
Death. He is married to Euwa and
has three children. One set of
grandparents lives with them. Both
the director, Robert Ernst, and the
author, David Schein, had hopes of
conveying the the beauty of death as
"a part of life." But the plot is too
thin and the songs too few to stim
ulate much emotional reaction to the
themes. Certainly, death is a theme,
and the tyranny of the Church is a
theme but neither evolve into any
thing more poetic or thought
provoking.
There are two noteworthy scenes in
a series of indistinguishable scenes.
The pivotal scene depicts the arrival

of a state-appointed nurse and
watchman to the Dunn home. The
comedic nurse to rob from the Dunn
family in the middle of the night but
Euwa catches her. In their wrath, the
family kills the nurse. The family calls
the watchman to look at the nurse
who they say has been taken ill.
Grandpa clubs the watchman and the
family escapes into the night despite
the curfew, which brings them one
step closer to fleeing the quarantined
city. They hope the countryside will
provide shelter from the encroaching
disease. The other memorable scene
depicts the death of Euwa's young
son.

Unfortunately,
the music is not
engaging.

The music is unique and has mo
ments of beautiful clarity. It blends
Renaissance folk song, modern
percussion and polyrhythmic chorus.
The lyrics tend to be witty. The dan
cing is minimal and makes for a lively
accompaniment to the songs. Al
though the music has moments of
chilling purity, the score never
develops its potential for being totally
fresh and creative; there are not
enough pieces, and to compensate for
this, several pieces are repeated. In
addition, these works are very similar
in tone and intensity.
There are excellent performances
by the cast, chorus and musicians

throughout the production. In partic
ular, the guard (Don Hart) has a
stunning voice, full and confident.
Before the audience enters the stage,
his chant from the catwalk above the
crowd is breathtaking. Karen Hott as
Euwa is a fine singer and solid actress
as well.
Unfortunately, the musical is not
engaging enough to overcome the
discomfort resulting from too much
standing and too much neck-craning.
The critics have lauded •'Tokens' for
its effective use of the immense per
formance space at Theatre Artaud.
But shuffling the spectators around
the stage seems more a gimmick than
a useful tool for integrating them into
the action of the play. There is noth
ing thought-provoking about having a
sore back, not being able to see while
standing through one third of the
show or being overwhelmed by the
stench of body odor. In spite of this,
the staging is visually quite successful
in creating the dismal setting that
must have characterized London
during the plague years. To achieve
this effect, Peter David Heth, the
production designer, relies only on
tattered hangings, scaffolding and
dim lighting in conjuction with the
bedraggled costumes and ghostly
make-up of the cast.
The show is too long and should
not have concerned itself so much
with filling space: a good idea and
commendable production gets lost in
the cumbersome devotion the
Theatre Artaud seems to place on in
novation. Tramping about the stage
does not involve the audience nearly
as much as a compelling score and/or
storyline.
