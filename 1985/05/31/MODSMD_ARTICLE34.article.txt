## Second-largest collection in the world Stanford dedicates Rodin garden 
### JOYA WESLEY Staff writer 
The Stanford Museum of Art will dedicate the Auguste
Rodin Sculpture Garden this afternoon in honor of B.
Gerald Cantor, who donated the garden's 20 sculptures.
The one-acre garden, located on the southern side of
the museum, is the second largest collection of Rodin
sculptures in the world. It is also the only garden of its
kind that will he open to the public 24 hours a day, free of
charge.
Architect Robert Mittelstadt designed the garden so
that it is divided into "courts." The monumental "Gates
of Hell" and figures derived from it will be in the east
court, sculptures that are tributes to artists will be in the
south court, and the "FJurghers of Calais" and partial fig
ures will be in the west court.
The sculptures are placed to receive maximum advan
tage of sunlight during the day and are lighted from below
at night.
Today's ceremony will consist of the showing of a film
on the casting of "The Gates of Hell" in Annenberg
Auditorium and will move to the garden itself, where
Cantor, University President Donald Kennedy, donor
Phyllis Wattis, University Trustee Linda Meier and Art
Prof. Albert Elsen will speak. A champagne reception will
follow in honor of the nearly 100 donors who made con
struction of the garden possible.
According to Elsen, curator of the collection, this gar
den's collection contains only a small percentage of the
sculptures Cantor has donated to the Stanford museum.
"He gave the museum 88 sculptures in 1974 and had
donated another 80 since that time," Elsen said.
Today's ceremony is solely to honor Cantor and the
other donors. The garden will be publicly dedicated June
22, when it will be finished.

Sculpture Garden, confers yesterday with the garden's archi-
