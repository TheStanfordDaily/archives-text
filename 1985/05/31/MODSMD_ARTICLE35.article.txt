A Hard Day's Night (1964)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
Richard Lester tries much too hard to
invent a new kind of musical comedy; the
fancy trick camerawork distracts us and
draws attention to Alun Owen's
threadbare script. But in their first movie,
the Beatles — especially Ringo — are so
effortlessly charming that the movie i=
hard to resist. From our current perspec
tive, of course, this early footage of the
Fab Four is inexpressibly touching.
Plays Tuesday with "The Girl Can't
Help It"and "The T.A.M.I. Show."
High Anxiety (1977)
Kresge Auditorium
Aficionados will have fun recognizing
bits from "Psycho." "The Birds," "The
39 Steps," "Vertigo," "North by North
west," "The Lady Vanishes,"
"Spellbound," "Marnie," "Notorious,"
"Rebecca" and "Foreign Correspon
dent," but Mel Brooks' tribute to
Hitchcock can't exactly be called a
parody — it's more like a goofy memory
collage. There is one classic sequence
based on the Psycho shower scene, an
hilarious scene in an airport, and one or
two other ideas that take off; most of it is
loud, sloppy and unimaginative. Brooks
stars with Cloris Leachman (who is very
funny for the first 10 minutes or so),
Madeline Kahn, Harvey Korman, Ron
Carey and Howard Morris; his co-writers
— Roy Clark, Rudy De Luca and Barry
Levinson — show up in bit parts.
Plays tonight at 9.
The Graduate (1967)
Memorial Auditorium
Mike Nichols' satirical comedy made
an immediate connection with young
audiences, and it has never lost it, even
though the broad revue style is dated now
and the jangling editing and Nichols' in
sistent use of close-up were always an
aesthetic assault. The major drawback to
the Calder Willingham-Buck Henry
screenplay — the one-sided, unsubtle at
tack on the bourgeois values of the older
generation — is, ironically, probably
what keeps it popular. On the other hand,
some of the dialogue has stayed
remarkably fresh, and there are three
highly commendable performances: a
full-scale one by Anne Bancroft as embit
tered, overpoweringly seductive Mrs.
Robinson, an imaginative comic one by
Dustin Hoffman as the confused hero,
Benjamin Braddock, and a small, gener
ally ignored one by Katharine Ross as
Bancroft's daughter, Elaine, whom Ben
jamin courts. Less impressive work is
done by Murray Hamilton as Mr. Robin
son, William Daniels as Mr. Braddock
and Elizabeth Wilson as Mrs. Braddock.
(No wonder the older generation gets
roasted in this picture, represented as it is
by three of the least attractive, least

believable actors in the business.) Rich
ard Dreyfuss shows up in a bit at the
rooming house (run by Norman Fell).
The songs, for anyone who has resided in
a cave for the last 18 years, are by Paul
Simon and Art Garfunkel.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 & 9:30.
Band of Outsiders (1964)
Cedar, San Francisco
"My story ends here like a dime
novel," says the narrator of Jean-Luc
Godard's film, "at a superb moment,
when everything's going right." This ex
traordinary, lyrical movie is a rhapsody
on cheap gangster melodramas: the trio
of protagonists (Claude Brasseur, Sami
Frey and Anna Karina) fantasize com
mitting a robbery in the style of cheap
detective fiction and then, astonishingly,
carry it out.The confusion of style and ac
tion is characteristically Godardian, but it
has never been so richly worked out —
not even in his landmark film,
"Breathless." Godard wrote his own
script, based on Dolores Hitchens'
"Fool's Gold," and he speaks the narra
tion, which is both humorously self
conscious and genuinely poetic. (When
his heroes enter the subway, we are told,
"They descended to the center of the
earth.") Phoptographed by Raoul
Coutard, with music by Michel Legrand.
Plays Wednesday and Thursday with
"Two or Three Things 1 Know About
Her."
The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie
(1969)
Castro, San Francisco
Each version of this material about the
reign and demise of a flamboyant teacher
at a conservative girls' school in Edin
burgh during the 1930s is modestly enter
taining: Muriel Spark's short novel. Jay

Presson Allen's play, and this film version
(adapted by Allen and directed by
Ronald Neame). Neame has taste and
that's about it — he's like an unimagina
tive George Cukor. But a delightful cast
vivifies the project: Maggie Smith as Miss
Brodie, Robert Stephens and Gordon
Jackson as her lovers, Pamela Franklin as
her most perceptive pupil, and Celia
Johnson (in perhaps her best perfor
mance) as the headmistress. There's a
knot in the very conception of this story
that won't untie, however. As written,
and certainly as played by Maggie Smith,
Miss Brodie is the funniest, most
deliriously eccentric character on the
screen, but the movie brings her down;
"Children should not be exposed to you,"
asserts the student who "assassinates"
her (i.e., sees that she loses her position),
and we're supposed to concur. It's a
troublesome twist that's built right into
Spark's novel, which at odd moments
seems to be written from the point of
view of the betrayer. Still, the movie is
mostly a lark.
Plays today with "The Paper Chase."
The Snake Pit (1948)
Castro, San Francisco
Anatole Litvak made this elaborate
melodrama about mental institutions,
based on Mary Jane Ward's popular
novel, at 20th Century-Fox, and it was
taken very seriously in its time. During
therapy sessions, the heroine, Virginia
Cunningham (Olivia De Havilland), is
given to flights of Hollywoodized
Freudian imagery — ocean drownings,
struggles to scale insurmountable walls,
lighting, etc. — that are familiar to
anyone who has seen "Spellbound."
There is some effective editing, and a
truly frightening boom shot up from the
"snake pit" — the psychotic ward — but
aside from these, and one well written.

well acted scene in which Virginia dresses
for a visit from her husband (Mark
Stevens), it's a pretty hokey movie. De
Havilland telegraphs her emotions and
gets to pump a fair amount of hysteria; in
the first 15 minutes, she has two attacks
of amnesia and a fit. With Leo Genn as
the doctor who dispenses shock treat
ments to Virginia, Celeste Holm, Glenn
Langan, Helen Craig, Leif Erickson,
Beulah Bondi, Lee Patrick, Isabel Jewell
and Ruth Donnelly. Screenplay by Frank
Portos and Milli Brand.
Plays Monday with "The Three Faces
of Eve."
American Madness (1932)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
If you want to know where Frank
Capracorn got its start, this is the movie
to look at. It came smack between two of
Capra's best (and least sentimental)
pictures, "The Miracle Woman" and
"The Bitter Tea of General Yen," both
starring Barbara Stanwyck, and it is made
with the same narrative and technical as
surance, and the same phenomenal
cameraman, Joseph Walker. Walter Hus
ton plays a banker who keeps his bank
from failing during a panic by appealing
to — what else? — the better nature of
his customers. They come through for
him, of course, and populism scores an
early victory, though perhaps a suspicious
one: A banker seems an odd choice for a
populist hero. Robert Riskin wrote the
script, and the cast includes Pat O'Brien
and Constance Cummings.
Plays Sunday with "Rain or Shine."
Sansho the Bailiff (1954)
Room Forum-12, Foothill College
On a journey through unfamiliar terri
tory in search of their banished father,
two children become separated from

their mother and are sold into slavery to
the tyrant Sansho; years later, having
escaped from his master, the boy
becomes a chieftain and seeks revenge.
This powerful film has the Mizoguchi
touch: It is brutal yet beautiful, and it
flows like a legend. One of his best films
(in a class with "Ugetsu.")
Plays tonight at 7:30.
Sunny Side Up (1929)
Castro, San Francisco
This early Fox musical, written
(screenplay and score) by the Broadway
songwriting team of De Sylva, Brown and
Henderson, is much more imaginative
and focused than almost all of the other
musicals of its period. (There were
hundreds in 1929 and 1930, before
audiences got so sick of them that theater
owners began displaying the announce
ment, "This is not a musical," on their
marquees, to attract customers.) But
you'd have to sit through some of the
other dogs of the era to understand why
this one is so much better, and really it
isn't worth it. Janet Gaynor and Charles
Farrell had one of their biggest hits in this
picture, which introduced the title song as
well as "I'm a Dreamer (Aren't We
All?)" and "If I Had a Talking Picture of
You."
Plays Tuesday with "State Fair."
Two or Three Things 1 Know About
Her (1966)
Cedar, San Francisco
Not one of Jean-Luc Godard's major
films — it's tart, charming and
provocative, but in a small way. The
female of the title is Paris, and the high
light of the movie is a lengthy close-up of
a coffee cup. (Really.)
Plays Wednesday and Thursday with
"Band of Outsiders."

Face to Face (1976)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
The knee-jerk praise for this movie on
its release proclaimed it yet another In
gmar Bergman masterpiece, and — well,
it's yet another Bergman, anyway. Actu
ally. it's a fairly loathsome movie. In this
period he was fond of showing his
audiences violence or suffering in close
up, as if by rubbing our noses in it he
were performing some noble act, offering
us The Truth. So we get Erland Joseph
son beating up Liv Ullmann in "Scenes
from a Marriage," George Segal beating
up Shirley Knight in the TV drama "The
Lie," and Lena Nyman as the retarded
sister crawling across the floor in
"Autumn Sonata." "Face to Face"
begins with one of Liv Ullmann's patients
(she plays a psychiatrist) playing with her
own naked breast and exploring her
mouth with her finger, and it moves on to
Ullmann's personal problems — rape and
a suicide attempt. Liv Ullmann is beyond
doubt one of the greatest actresses in the
world, but here and in "Autumn Sonata"
she submerges herself in the role to an
alarming degree, leaving us no reason to
watch her. With Erland Josephson, Aine
Taube and Gunnar Bjornstrand; shot by
Sven NyKVist.
Plays Monday with "After the Rehear
sal."
The Girl Can't Help It (1956)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
This musical comedy, directed by
Frank Tashlin and shot by Leon Sham
roy, has a nifty opening number that
plays with the size of the screen (the film
is in Cinemascope); and straight through
the photography (in Eastmancolor) is
bold, bright, and comically varied, like a
Rose Bowl Parade. The art director and
costume designer must have had the time
of their lives, and in the fantasy se
quences, Shamroy's palette color
coordinates with the costumes. It's a pity
the substance (a script by Tashlin and
Herbert Baker), which features Jayne
Mansfield as a would-be singing star with
no talent and Tom Ewell as her agent, is
so pathetic. Mansfield looks sensational,
but Ewell, a stage comedian (who also
got to act opposite Marilyn Monroe, in
"The Seven Year Itch"), is pinched and
dried up on the screen; everything he
does seems prefabricated. The cast in
cludes Edmond O'Brien, Henry Jones
and (briefly) Barry Gordon, a decade
before "A Thousand Clowns." (He
already acts like a miniature adult.)
There are also lots of pop acts — Julie
London, Ray Anthony, The Platters,
Eddie Cochrane, Abbey Lincoln (who
sings gospel in a red gown with a deep
decollete), and for those who care about
real rock 'n' roll. Little Richard, Fats
Domino and Gene Vincent (performing
" Be-Bop-a-Lula").
Plays Tuesday with "A Hard Day's
Night" and"The T.A.M.I. Show."
