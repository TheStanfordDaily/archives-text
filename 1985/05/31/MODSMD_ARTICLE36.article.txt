## Hammer theft sparks reward Hammer and Coffin Society offers $1,000 for ceremonial mallet 
### WILLIAM PENNEY 
Several Stanford Chaparral alumni
announced yesterday that a $1,000
reward will he given for the return of
the Hammer and Coffin Society's 80-
year-old sledge hammer that was
stolen in January, according to
Chaparral alumnus Vinnie Freda.
In addition, Freda said the police
were contacted in early March as a
result of pressure from alumni.
Chaparral members did not contact
police originally about the theft be
cause they believed it was a prank
and did not want anyone punished.
Campus police said the culprit could
be charged with grand theft, because
the axe is valued at over $600.
Freda said last night that the ham
mer has "incredible sentimental
value."
Asked if there were any suspects,
he said," We think it was The Daily."
"We've received a couple of ran
som notes indicating that the hammer
is buried in Winnemucca, Nev., but
we're not taking those seriously,"
Freda said.
Freda, a 1984 Stanford graduate
and former ASSU Council of Presi
dents member, said the "traditional
rivalry" between The Daily and The
Chaparral may be a motive in the
crime. He said he thinks The Daily
was upset over Chaparral members'
"pissing on their roof and changing
their sign to read 'The Stanford
Dairy.' "
Freda specifically accused former
Daily Editor Shirish Date of possess
ing the stolen hammer.

"1 think Shirish has it in his room,"
Freda said.
When contacted late last night for
comment. Date said he had no
knowledge of the whereabouts of the
hammer. "I don't know what he's
talking about," Date said. "Hammer?
What hammer?"
An advertisement in yesterday's
Daily offered "a final plea" for the
return of the hammer and announced
the $1,000 reward offer. The original
reward was $500, but contributions
from alumni of the Hammer and Cof
fin Society who attended Stanford in
the 19305, '40s and '50s have
doubled the size of the reward. "The
money is definitely there," Freda
said.
Ihe hammer's "sterling-silver
plated head is worth about $100 to
$200," Freda said, "and is about 80
years old." He said the handle holds
an array of sterling-siK'er rings upon
which are engraved "the names of the
initiates for the past 15 years â€”an ir
replaceable item."
In January, The Daily reported
that because other more obvious
valuables at the Chaparral office were
left untouched, and Daily staff mem
bers reacted with little surprise when
the theft was reported, the Chappie
staff reached the conclusion that the
hammer was taken by a Daily staff
member as part of the rivalry be
tween the two publications.
Freda said the Chaparral is "an 85-
year-old organization. And like the
chalice which every initiate has to
chug from, the hammer is a major
piece of our heritage."
