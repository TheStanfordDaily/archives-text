# C-IR to hear plan to divest
## Full student package on agenda 
### GREGORY WEINGARTEN Editorial staff 
University President Donald Ken
nedy has agreed to place on the
agenda of a Board of Trustees com
mittee all sections of a student pro
posal to change University invest
ment review policy, the proposal's
authors said yesterday.
Last week, Kennedy said he would
put only the first of the proposal's
four sections on the agenda of the
June meeting of the Committee on
Investments.'
Kennedy has also agreed to send
copies of the proposal, which was
drafted by student members of the
Commission on Investment Respon
sibility (C-IR) and the Committee on
Investments, to trustees so that they
will have ample time to review the
proposal before their meeting.
The first section of the student pro
posal calls for "more effective moni
toring and evaluation of performance
of companies in which Stanford holds
equity."
Specifically, the students request
three full-time staff people to evalu
ate Stanford's holdings independently
of the Treasurer s Office. The pro
posal also stipulates that a student
representative from either the ASSU
Nominations Commission or the
Commission on Investment Respon
sibility (C-IR) contribute to the selec
tion process of the staff.
The second part of the proposal
calls for total divestment of compan
ies still doing business in South Africa
by Oct. 1, 1987, if "the Group Areas
Act and other influx control laws
have not been dismantled by the
South African government."
The third part calls for University
divestment at the end of the 1985-86
school year from any company
"unwilling to actively oppose influx
control laws, to comply adequately to
Sullivan Principles, or to disclose per
tinent information" regarding its
business policy in South Africa.
The last part of the proposal
changes the voting procedure of the
C-IR so that a recommendation
would need only a majority vote,
rather than the two-thirds currently
required.
Kennedy's decision to place the
entire proposal on the Committee on
Investments' agenda followed a
meeting Wednesday with Walter
Geys, a co-author of the proposal and
a member of the committee.
Mark Landesmann, a member of
the C-IR and one of the co-authors of
the student proposal, called Ken
nedy's decision to include the full
proposal significant, saying that it
marked the "first time in the last 15
vears that the Board of Trustees has

explicitly been willing to considei a
drastic policy document that suggests
drastic changes in an investment
policy."
Landesmann expressed what he
called a "guarded skepticism" on
whether the trustees will act on the
proposal, but he added it would look
very bad if they did not.
"I'm really glad Kennedy recon
sidered his previous decision and
decided to remain open-minded,"
Landesmann said. "I'm afraid he was
embarrassed, and I think that it was
wise of him to reconsider.
"I think he changed his mind on
considering the proposal as a whole.
He would have had the power to split
the proposal. I think he consented be
cause he thought, niven the outrage

of the Stanford community last week,
it would be better to consider the pro
posal as a whole," Landesmann said.
Kennedy was unavailable for com
ment late yesterday.
Landesmann cited recent events
such as the arrests of nine students at
an Old-Union sit-in Tuesday and the
petition drive to stop donations to the
University until the trustees change
the investment policy as factors in
Kennedy's decision to include the
whole student proposal on the Com
mittee on Investments' agenda.
Geys agreed that Kennedy's action
is important.
"At least we know that [the full
proposal] will be discussed hy the
Committee on Investments, and we
can send it up to the full board for ac
tion," Geys said.
Geys said Kennedy's decision
ensures that the lull proposal will be
discussed by at least the trustee Com
mittee on Investments, which Geys
considers more powerful than the


Walter Geys
Investment plan co-author
Special Committee for Investment
Responsibility (SCIR), the other
trustee advisory committee.
Landesmann said that if Kennedy
had not accepted the tull proposal,
only the first part would have been
sent to the Committee on Invest
ments. The other parts would have
been sent to the C-IR for review and
then to the SCIR. Now the whole
proposal will be considered by the
Committee on Investments and the
SCIR — ensuring that the whole pro
posal is part of the trustees' agenda,
he said.
Geys questioned the current legal
procedures for putting an issue on the
agenda of the Committee on Invest
ments. "Is it legally appropriate that
the administration can screen to
decide whether to put things on the
agenda when a student, who is a full
voting member, cannot do the
same?" he said.
Landesmann added that the C-IR,
upon learning of Kennedy's decision,
has allotted seven hours to discuss the
proposal next week.
On June 3 and 6, the C-IR will
hold a two-hour and a five-hour
meeting, respectively. The C-IR will
vote on the proposal, deciding
whether to extend a majority or
minority recommendation of the pro
posal, according to Landesmann.

Kennedy has also agreed to send
copies of the proposal, which was
drafted by student members of the
Commission on Investment Respon
sibility (C-IR) and the Committee on
Investments, to trustees so that they
will have ample time to review the
proposal before their meeting.
The first section of the student pro
posal calls for "more effective moni
toring and evaluation of performance
of companies in which Stanford holds
equity."
Specifically, the students request
three full-time staff people to evalu
ate Stanford's holdings independently
of the Treasurer s Office. The pro
posal also stipulates that a student
representative from either the ASSU
Nominations Commission or the
Commission on Investment Respon
sibility (C-IR) contribute to the selec
tion process of the staff.
The second part of the proposal
calls for total divestment of compan
ies still doing business in South Africa
by Oct. 1, 1987, if "the Group Areas
Act and other influx control laws
have not been dismantled by the
South African government."
The third part calls for University
divestment at the end of the 1985-86
school year from any company
"unwilling to actively oppose influx
control laws, to comply adequately to
Sullivan Principles, or to disclose per
tinent information" regarding its
business policy in South Africa.
The last part of the proposal
changes the voting procedure of the
C-IR so that a recommendation
would need only a majority vote,
rather than the two-thirds currently
required.
Kennedy's decision to place the
entire proposal on the Committee on
Investments' agenda followed a
meeting Wednesday with Walter
Geys, a co-author of the proposal and
a member of the committee.
Mark Landesmann, a member of
the C-IR and one of the co-authors of
the student proposal, called Ken
nedy's decision to include the full
proposal significant, saying that it
marked the "first time in the last 15
vears that the Board of Trustees has

explicitly been willing to considei a
drastic policy document that suggests
drastic changes in an investment
policy."
Landesmann expressed what he
called a "guarded skepticism" on
whether the trustees will act on the
proposal, but he added it would look
very bad if they did not.
"I'm really glad Kennedy recon
sidered his previous decision and
decided to remain open-minded,"
Landesmann said. "I'm afraid he was
embarrassed, and I think that it was
wise of him to reconsider.
"I think he changed his mind on
considering the proposal as a whole.
He would have had the power to split
the proposal. I think he consented be
cause he thought, niven the outrage

of the Stanford community last week,
it would be better to consider the pro
posal as a whole," Landesmann said.
Kennedy was unavailable for com
ment late yesterday.
Landesmann cited recent events
such as the arrests of nine students at
an Old-Union sit-in Tuesday and the
petition drive to stop donations to the
University until the trustees change
the investment policy as factors in
Kennedy's decision to include the
whole student proposal on the Com
mittee on Investments' agenda.
Geys agreed that Kennedy's action
is important.
"At least we know that [the full
proposal] will be discussed hy the
Committee on Investments, and we
can send it up to the full board for ac
tion," Geys said.
Geys said Kennedy's decision
ensures that the lull proposal will be
discussed by at least the trustee Com
mittee on Investments, which Geys
considers more powerful than the


Walter Geys
Investment plan co-author
Special Committee for Investment
Responsibility (SCIR), the other
trustee advisory committee.
Landesmann said that if Kennedy
had not accepted the tull proposal,
only the first part would have been
sent to the Committee on Invest
ments. The other parts would have
been sent to the C-IR for review and
then to the SCIR. Now the whole
proposal will be considered by the
Committee on Investments and the
SCIR — ensuring that the whole pro
posal is part of the trustees' agenda,
he said.
Geys questioned the current legal
procedures for putting an issue on the
agenda of the Committee on Invest
ments. "Is it legally appropriate that
the administration can screen to
decide whether to put things on the
agenda when a student, who is a full
voting member, cannot do the
same?" he said.
Landesmann added that the C-IR,
upon learning of Kennedy's decision,
has allotted seven hours to discuss the
proposal next week.
On June 3 and 6, the C-IR will
hold a two-hour and a five-hour
meeting, respectively. The C-IR will
vote on the proposal, deciding
whether to extend a majority or
minority recommendation of the pro
posal, according to Landesmann.
