# SOSA gives new demands
## Group calls other student divestment proposals 'inadequate' 
### DAVID EMERSON 
Stanford Out of South Africa yesterday
issued a set of four proposals to deal with
University ownership of stock in companies
that do business in South Africa, and called
other student proposals "inadequate."
The SOSA proposals, which the student
coalition issued because members said their
previous demands had not been adequately
addressed" by the University, call for a con
crete timetable tor divestment and a
moratorium on investment in all companies
which do business with South Africa.
If these companies agree to refrain from
trading with South Africa in the future, the
moratorium would be lifted. On Oct. 1.
IMSS. the University would immediately
divest of all stock held in companies that
continue to do business in South Africa.
As its second goal, the group requests that
three full-time employees be hired to work
with the Commission on Investment
Responibility (C-IR) in order to monitor the
performance of companies in which Stan

Next, the anti-apartheid student coalition
wants to amend the University bylaws to al
low the C-IR to vote for divestment by a
simple majority instead of a two-thirds mar
gin.
Finally. SOSA calls for an "open Univer
sity investment policy" which includes the
monthly publication of Stanford's stock
portfolio transactions and disclosure of trus
tees' personal investment porfolios.
SOSA member Laura Edelstein said the
proposals were not so much a response to
the recent divestment initiative presented to
the C-IR by a group of students, but
"something which we have been working on
for a long time."
"Nevertheless, our proposal is more ap
propriate" than the other student initiative,
she said.
Coalition member David Troutt agreed.
"The C-IR proposal is inadequate. It could
easily be misconstrued as a politically accep
table policy of selective divestment using the
Sullivan Principles. To us. the Sullivan Prin
ciples are dead. SOSA wants total divest
ment."
tb<* prnim i«s "exnlorinp

several channels" in an attempt to get its
proposal on the agenda of the June 14
meeting of the Board of Trustees.
Mark Landesmann, a co-author of the
other student proposal, said SOSA's pro
posal "is not likely to be considered by the
board." Still, he said, "I like it. It has an im
portant educational function.
"It should have a subtle, but not
negligible, impact on the C-IR delibera
tions." Landesmann said.
Troutt, however, said he wants more.
"There is a moral responsibility for a pres
tigious university like Stanford to not just
divest, but to be a leading actor in the fight
against apartheid."
Until then, students will continue to put
pressure on the administration, according to
Troutt. The sit-in at the Bursar's Office,
which resulted in nine arres ~ "was not spe
cifically sponsored by SOSA, but rather the
result of individual acts of conscience. I fully
expect these acts of civil disobedience to
continue." he said.
"The University has to take a stand."'
Troutt said. "I hope with all my heart that
'hev accent our proposal "
