Soviets launch Afghan offensive
PESHAWAR, Pakistan — Soviet armored forces backed by scores of
jets and helicopter gunships are smashing their way through sparsely
armed Afghan resistance fighters and a larger force is readying a huge
offensive to seal the Pakistani border, sources said yesterday.
A Soviet action that began in Kunar Province last week is the first
stage of an offensive to close the frontier and block guerrilla convoys
bringing in arms and weapons supplies, guerrilla officials and other
sources told The Associated Press.
"It's a huge Soviet force, unusually large. It's turning into the biggest
offensive of the war," said Professor Sayed Majrooh, head of the aut
horitative and politically independent Afghan Information Center,
which monitors events inside the country.
More than 10,000 Soviet troops supported by hundreds of tanks and
armored personnel carriers and backed by jet fighter-bombers and
helicopter gunships have been thrown into the Kunar attack, according
to Western diplomatic sources, who spoke on condition they not be
identified further.
Western reporters are barred from Afghanistan and there is no way to
confirm the reports independently.
The diplomatic sources said a second, larger, Soviet force is being con
centrated in the Gardez area of Paktia Province and is expected to start a
second offensive soon. Paktia. to the south of Kunar, is anbther main
route for guerrilla convoys bringing in weapons, ammunition and
supplies.
It appears that more than 25,000 Soviet troops may be committed to
the battle, which would make it the biggest offensive of the war, Maj
rooh said. In past major offensives the Soviets have never used more
than 12,000 troops, Majrooh said.
Large columns of Soviet tanks and troops have been moving out of the
Afghan capital of Kabul in recent weeks, heading south and east towards
the Pakistani border, the diplomatic sources said. The Soviet forces have
also been concentrating large numbers of aircraft at Kabul airport and
new encampments of troops and vehicles have appeared around the city,
they said.
Soviet forces have been in Afghanistan since 1980, supporting the
country's communist government. Western intelligence estimates there
are 115,000 Soviet troops in Afghanistan fighting anti-communist Is
lamic guerrillas.
Guerrilla officials said yesterday their forces are taking heavy losses in
the Kunar valley as Soviet aircraft bomb and rocket areas in front of
their advancing armored forces.
Explosion rocks Johannesburg
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — An explosion thundered over
downtown Johannesburg last night, on the eve of Republic Day, when
most streets were nearly empty.
It was not clear if there were any casualties in the 6 p.m. blast that
shook a neighborhood of retail shops and office blocks about 500 yards
southeast of City Hall.
Glass littered the streets that were cordoned off by police, who
refused to say whether the blast was caused by a bomb. The police bomb
squad, however, was at the scene.
On Tuesday, a bomb claimed by guerrillas opposed to the white
minority government wounded 17 people in army medical administra
tion offices on the eastern fringe of midtown.
Jihad group says it killed Briton
BEIRUT, Lebanon — The Islamic Jihad terrorist group, believed to
have ties to the Islamic regime in Iran, has claimed responsibility for kil
ling a British professor and kidnapping an American and two
Frenchmen.
In a statement to a Western news agency Wednesday, the shadowy
group said it would not "let anyone rest" until Moslem extremists jailed
in Kuwait were freed and the United States and France halt what the
group said was their support for Iraq in its war against Iran.
Meanwhile, President Amin Gemayel was in Damascus, Syria —
reportedly to ask President Hafez Assad to send his army into Beirut to
stop fighting between Shiite Moslem militiamen and Palestinians.
Gemayel left shortly after his palace took at least two direct hits from
120 mm artillery shells Wednesday. The president was showered with
glass but unhurt.
A caller to a Western news agency who claimed to represent Islamic
Jihad said it killed 53-year-old Denis Hill, a professor at the American
University of Beirut. He had been missing since Monday, and was found
shot in the head.
The caller, speaking in Arabic, said Hill was killed trying to escape his
captors "who wanted to interrogate him about his suspicious activities in
Beirut." Information about the telephone call was provided to The As
sociated Press by the news agency that received the call on condition the
agency not be identified.
The caller also said Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War. had kidnapped
David Jacobsen, the American director of the university hospital, on
Tuesday, and Frenchmen Jean Paul Kauffman and Michel Seurat last
week.
It was the first claim of responsibility for the abduction of Jacobsen,
54, of Huntington Beach, Calif., and the two Frenchmen. Islamic Jihad
is believed to be a Shiite Moslem group. Shiism is a minority Moslem
sect in Lebanon, and the dominant sect in Iran.
The abduction of Jacobsen and the two Frenchmen raised to 10 the
number of prisoners Islamic Jihad claims to be holding.
The university's librarian, Peter Kilburn, 60, failed to show up for
work Dec. 3. Also being held arc Americans William Buckley. 56, a U.S.
Embassy political officer; the Rev. Benjamin Weir. 60, a Presbyterian

ated Press.
It also claims it abducted Frenchmen Marcel Fontaine, 45, vice consul
at the French Embassy, and Marcel Carton. 60, the embassy protocol of

Moslems claimed it abducted British journalist Alec Collett, 63.
Belgium bars British soccer teams
BRUSSELS, Belgium — British soccer teams will be barred from Bel
gium, a government spokesman said yesterday, and may be banished
from all of Europe because of the bloody riot blamed on Liverpool fans
at a championship game.
The official casualty toll in the Wednesday night melee before the
European cup final between Liverpool and an Italian team was 38 dead
and 375 injured.
Most of the dead were Italians. Many were crushed to death by a brick
retaining wall that collapsed when British fans broke down a barrier and
charged into an Italian section of the stands.
Britain announced it would establish a fund for the victims of the riot.
"There will be an agreement on Friday" within the government about
the Belgian ban on British teams, said Andre Collard, spokesman for In
terior Minister Charles-Ferdinand Nothomb.
Jacques Georges, head the 34-nation union of European soccer as
sociations. indicated he would seek the exclusion of British teams from
the entire continent. He said the executive committee will meet July 2 in
Geneva to discuss the matter.
He said there was no doubt that Liverpool fans began the riot, but a
special committee would study film from television camcras that had
been set up to telecast the game and caught most of the riot.
A ban on British teams would eliminate some of the great powers of
soccer from top international competitions and add new embarrassment
and shame to that already being expressed in Britain.
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain expressed "horror and
revulsion" at the behavior of Liverpool fans and said "the thugs who
destroy football (soccer)" should be given stiff prison sentences. She said
the British government would provide at least 250.000 pounds
($300,000) to the victims.
The Rome prosecutor's office said Italian officials had begun an inves
tigation that could lead to criminal charges against the rioting British
fans.

Frenchmen.
In a statement to a Western news agency Wednesday, the shadowy
group said it would not "let anyone rest" until Moslem extremists jailed
in Kuwait were freed and the United States and France halt what the
group said was their support for Iraq in its war against Iran.
Meanwhile, President Amin Gemayel was in Damascus, Syria —
reportedly to ask President Hafez Assad to send his army into Beirut to
stop fighting between Shiite Moslem militiamen and Palestinians.
Gemayel left shortly after his palace took at least two direct hits from
120 mm artillery shells Wednesday. The president was showered with
glass but unhurt.
A caller to a Western news agency who claimed to represent Islamic
Jihad said it killed 53-year-old Denis Hill, a professor at the American
University of Beirut. He had been missing since Monday, and was found
shot in the head.
The caller, speaking in Arabic, said Hill was killed trying to escape his
captors "who wanted to interrogate him about his suspicious activities in
Beirut." Information about the telephone call was provided to The As
sociated Press by the news agency that received the call on condition the
agency not be identified.
The caller also said Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War. had kidnapped
David Jacobsen, the American director of the university hospital, on
Tuesday, and Frenchmen Jean Paul Kauffman and Michel Seurat last
week.
It was the first claim of responsibility for the abduction of Jacobsen,
54, of Huntington Beach, Calif., and the two Frenchmen. Islamic Jihad
is believed to be a Shiite Moslem group. Shiism is a minority Moslem
sect in Lebanon, and the dominant sect in Iran.
The abduction of Jacobsen and the two Frenchmen raised to 10 the
number of prisoners Islamic Jihad claims to be holding.

work Dec. 3. Also being held arc Americans William Buckley. 56, a U.S.

Belgium bars British soccer teams
BRUSSELS, Belgium — British soccer teams will be barred from Bel
gium, a government spokesman said yesterday, and may be banished
from all of Europe because of the bloody riot blamed on Liverpool fans
at a championship game.
The official casualty toll in the Wednesday night melee before the
European cup final between Liverpool and an Italian team was 38 dead
and 375 injured.
Most of the dead were Italians. Many were crushed to death by a brick
retaining wall that collapsed when British fans broke down a barrier and
charged into an Italian section of the stands.
Britain announced it would establish a fund for the victims of the riot.
"There will be an agreement on Friday" within the government about
the Belgian ban on British teams, said Andre Collard, spokesman for In
terior Minister Charles-Ferdinand Nothomb.
Jacques Georges, head the 34-nation union of European soccer as
sociations. indicated he would seek the exclusion of British teams from
the entire continent. He said the executive committee will meet July 2 in
Geneva to discuss the matter.
He said there was no doubt that Liverpool fans began the riot, but a
special committee would study film from television camcras that had
been set up to telecast the game and caught most of the riot.
A ban on British teams would eliminate some of the great powers of
soccer from top international competitions and add new embarrassment
and shame to that already being expressed in Britain.
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain expressed "horror and
revulsion" at the behavior of Liverpool fans and said "the thugs who
destroy football (soccer)" should be given stiff prison sentences. She said
the British government would provide at least 250.000 pounds
($300,000) to the victims.
The Rome prosecutor's office said Italian officials had begun an inves
tigation that could lead to criminal charges against the rioting British
fans.
Soviets launch Afghan offensive
PESHAWAR, Pakistan — Soviet armored forces backed by scores of
jets and helicopter gunships are smashing their way through sparsely
armed Afghan resistance fighters and a larger force is readying a huge
offensive to seal the Pakistani border, sources said yesterday.
A Soviet action that began in Kunar Province last week is the first
stage of an offensive to close the frontier and block guerrilla convoys
bringing in arms and weapons supplies, guerrilla officials and other
sources told The Associated Press.
"It's a huge Soviet force, unusually large. It's turning into the biggest
offensive of the war," said Professor Sayed Majrooh, head of the aut
horitative and politically independent Afghan Information Center,
which monitors events inside the country.
More than 10,000 Soviet troops supported by hundreds of tanks and
armored personnel carriers and backed by jet fighter-bombers and
helicopter gunships have been thrown into the Kunar attack, according
to Western diplomatic sources, who spoke on condition they not be
identified further.
Western reporters are barred from Afghanistan and there is no way to
confirm the reports independently.
The diplomatic sources said a second, larger, Soviet force is being con
centrated in the Gardez area of Paktia Province and is expected to start a
second offensive soon. Paktia. to the south of Kunar, is anbther main
route for guerrilla convoys bringing in weapons, ammunition and
supplies.
It appears that more than 25,000 Soviet troops may be committed to
the battle, which would make it the biggest offensive of the war, Maj
rooh said. In past major offensives the Soviets have never used more
than 12,000 troops, Majrooh said.
Large columns of Soviet tanks and troops have been moving out of the
Afghan capital of Kabul in recent weeks, heading south and east towards
the Pakistani border, the diplomatic sources said. The Soviet forces have
also been concentrating large numbers of aircraft at Kabul airport and
new encampments of troops and vehicles have appeared around the city,
they said.
Soviet forces have been in Afghanistan since 1980, supporting the
country's communist government. Western intelligence estimates there
are 115,000 Soviet troops in Afghanistan fighting anti-communist Is
lamic guerrillas.
Guerrilla officials said yesterday their forces are taking heavy losses in
the Kunar valley as Soviet aircraft bomb and rocket areas in front of
their advancing armored forces.
Explosion rocks Johannesburg
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — An explosion thundered over
downtown Johannesburg last night, on the eve of Republic Day, when
most streets were nearly empty.
It was not clear if there were any casualties in the 6 p.m. blast that
shook a neighborhood of retail shops and office blocks about 500 yards
southeast of City Hall.
Glass littered the streets that were cordoned off by police, who
refused to say whether the blast was caused by a bomb. The police bomb
squad, however, was at the scene.
On Tuesday, a bomb claimed by guerrillas opposed to the white
minority government wounded 17 people in army medical administra
tion offices on the eastern fringe of midtown.
