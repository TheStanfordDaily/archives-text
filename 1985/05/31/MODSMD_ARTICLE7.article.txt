# Reagan takes tax plan to Oshkosh
## 
### 
OSHKOSH, Wis. — President Reagan, carrying
his crusade for sweeping tax changes from Vir
ginia's colonial capital to this mid-American manu
facturing community, complained yesterday the
current system is so unfair it encourages honest tax
payers to cheat. "It's time we rebelled," he
declared.
In an apparent criticism of government tax
audits, Reagan said that under the present law,
"decent citizens (are) called before the Internal
Revenue Service to answer for their income and
expenditures and show their papers and their proof
in a drama that is as common as it is demeaning."
Reagan embarked on the first of a series of out
of-town appearances to marshal public support
among working-class Americans for his package of
lower tax rates for individuals and businesses and
elimination of many deductions.
He traveled first to Williamsburg, Va., and then
to Oshkosh. Today, the president will make an ad
dress in Malvern, Pa.
As Reagan climbed onto a stage constructed on
the steps of the Winnebago County Courthouse
here, four young women stripped off their clothes
and sat bare-breasted on the shoulders of com
panions during the speech on overhauling the tax
system.
Two nude men also appeared in the audience at a
county courthouse square, and authorities said two

arrests were made.
The demonstrators waved signs in an apparent
attempt to distract the audience of about 22,000
people.
"Reagan Must Face the Naked Truth," read one
sign. "Naked Not Nuked,"' said another. Others
said, "Quit Staring — Join Us." and "Our Emperor
Has No Clothes."
Signs carried by others protested U.S. policies in
Central America.
Two of the women appeared to be nude and the
other two were topless. About halfway through
Reagan's appearance, the women returned the
ground.
But demonstrators chanted and heckled Reagan
throughout his speech, delivered from a stage con
structed on the steps of the Winnebago County
Courthouse.
The president made no mention of the disrobing,
but midway through his speech he made a crack
about the noisy protesters. "I'm going to raise their
taxes," Reagan joked, triggering a burst of ap
plause from the largely friendly crowd.
Sheriff Terry Footit said two young men were ar
rested and would be charged with either indecent
exposure or disorderly conduct. It wasn't clear
whether they were the same men who were seen in
the audience, nude and holding a protest sign aloft.
Even as Reagan launched his sales campaign, the

administration acknowledged he was prepared to
accept compromises in the package as it moves
through Congress.
Reagan, standing before Virginia's historic
House of Burgesses, denounced the current tax
code as "so rigged, so unfair, that it corrupts other
wise honest people by encouraging them to cheat.
In Oshkosh, the president portrayed his plan as
pro-family, with a near doubling of the personal ex
emption for each taxpayer and dependent to
$2,000; expansion of the Individual Retirement
Account benefits; and compression of the tax
brackets into a three-tier system of 15 percent, 25
percent and 35 percent.
Reagan said. "We want to do away with a tax
code that reflects years of lobbying efforts by pow
erful special interests. Instead, we want a tax code
for Main Street America."
As he boarded Air Force One to leave Oshkosh,
the president was asked about the topless
protesters, who were about 75 feet from the
podium.
' "I didn't see them," he said.
After a pause, he grinned and added: "1 think
I'm going to go back."
White House spokesman Larry Speakes said he
was told by Sen. Robert Kasten (R-Wis.), who was
on the platform with Reagan, that the president did
not see the women.
