# Reagan praises Hussein's offer

### 
WASHINGTON — The Reagan
administration praised Jordan's King
Hussein yesterday for offering to hold
peace talks with Israel but said it had
"major difficulties" with his call for
an international conference on the
Mideast dispute.
At the same time, the administra
tion registered its opposition to par
ticipation by the Soviet Union, as
Hussein proposed, until it
"demonstrated its willingness to play
a constructive role."
A State Department spokesman,
Edward Djerejian, said the Soviets
would have to resume diplomatic re
lations with Israel, ease restrictions
on emigration, cease "anti-Semitic
propaganda" and halt arms ship
ments to Iran and to Lebanese militia
groups to qualify.
Hussein outlined his plan for a con
ference after meeting on Wednesday
with President Reagan. It would pro
vide for negotiations between a
mixed Palestinian-Jordan delegation
and Israel under the supervision of
the five permament members of the
U.N. Security Council — the United
States, the Soviet Union, China, Brit
ain and France.
The king said he had the full sup
port of the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization and that it was prepared to
recognize Israel's rights under U.N.
Security Council resolutions 242 and
338, which were adopted after the

1967 and 1973 Mideast wars.
Secretary of State George Shultz.
in a dinner toast to Hussein on Wed
nesday night, avoided any reference
to a peace conference while praising
the king's efforts. Shultz spoke in
stead of "a supportive international
endtext" and said "we will continue
to work on resolving our differences
regarding how best to provide that
context."
Meanwhile, Hussein outlined his
call for peace talks with Israel at a
breakfast with congressional leaders.
"What the king said here was a
very forward, certainly more optimis
tic statement than I've heard in years
and years and years about the possi
bilities," said Rep. Dante Fascell (D-
Fla.), chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee.
He said Hussein made no mention
of his desire to buy U.S. arms and
that it was "too early to say" whether
Congress would go along if the ad
minstration proposed the sale of
Hawk anti-aircraft missiles or other
sophisticated weapons to Jordan.
Larry Speakes, the White House
spokesman, called Hussein's proposal
interesting and said: "We are looking
into it."
Speakes said the conference would
be considered only "in terms of
whether it would lead to direct talks
between Jordan, the Palestinians and
the Israelis."
