PENSACOLA, Fla. — Two
men convicted in the Christmas
Day bombings of an abortion cen
ter and two doctors' offices were
sentenced yesterday to 10 years
each in federal prison.
The men faced possible terms of
65 years each, and U.S. District
Judge Roger Vinson's decision
was praised by abortion opponents
supporting the men, and
denounced by a women's rights
advocate.
Vinson placed the wife of one
man and the fiancee of the other
on five years' probation.
He also ordered James Sim
mons and Matthew Goldsby, both
21, to pay $353,073 each to insur
ance companies and the two doc
tors whose offices were destroyed
by the explosions.
Damage to the offices and to an
abortion center were estimated by
government officials at $ 1 million.
Simmons and Goldsby — con
victed six weeks ago when an in
sanity defense failed — also were
sentenced to five years' probation,
beginning when their prison terms
end. They were ordered to report
to prison June 17.
For Goldsby's fiancee, Kaye
Wiggins, and Simmons' wife,
Kathren, both 19, the judge or
dered five years' probation for

convictions of conspiracy in the
bombings. The women were also
fined $5,000 each.
During the hearing, Goldsby
begged Vinson for mercy, promis
ing never to "involve myself in
such activity in the future."
The bombings destroyed the
Ladies Center, an abortion and
women's health clinic, and the
offices of gynecologists who had
performed abortions, Drs. William
Permenter and Bo Bagenholm.
Pat Jones, president of the Es
cambia County chapter of the Na
tional Organization for Women,
felt the sentences were too lenient.
Anti-abortion pickets paraded
outside the courthouse. Besides
picketing, many of the defendants'
supporters had attended prayer
meetings Wednesday night on
their behalf.
Joseph Scheidler. director of the
Chicago-based Pro-Life Action
League, applauded prison terms
he called "lenient."
Ruby Menard. Simmons'
mother, also praised the sentence.
"We don't say to blow up build
ings. The kids are going to be pun
ished for that, but when are the
grown-ups going to be punished
for murdering and killing those
babies?" Menard said.
