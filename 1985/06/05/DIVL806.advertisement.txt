GEORGE WEBSTER DOUGLAS
TO: PRESIDENT DONALD KENNEDY
Dear Sir ,
"If everyman's good were everyman's rule" how idyllic would be our
Stanford existence."
"Everyman" does not become a mathematician or a neongazer,
or electronized whiz.
Nor does he become a psychiatrist, nor a writer of the human
dilemma, nor a president of a new university on its way to becoming a
second Univ. of Berlin with its "Hegel," making history by melding
the"objective and the "subjective" pursuits of the minds of man.
Subjectively, I was thrilled with the overtones I heard in the
cockles of my heart. They were the tones of a good man, kind man. an
intelligent man. a man who put me at my ease. These are familiar i,
overtones — I heard them coming out of me. those same "harsh"
overtones, when I tried to tell my youngest daughter, Leoni, how to
tame an "assailant" who might do her harm. Speak into his highest ,
aspirations which are greater than his fears and your fears. Be brave
i and more than intelligent. No assailant no matter how demented can
overome the appeal rightly done. You don't have to be tall to win —
' Napoleon was short. De Gaulle was tall.
Thank you so much for your "verbal photograph." President
Reagan speaks into my inner world of lightness — President
i (Stanford's) Kennedy speaks into my highest intelligence. It triggers
me into being more of a person than I had courage to be in the
complex world of "subjective and objective" authority. I have not
prepared myself adequately to confront the "other side of the
mountain. Jean Kennedy — a friend of yours — showed me the 1
greatest kindness last year. Now I have heard the wondrous team in
1 action.
i Sincerely.
