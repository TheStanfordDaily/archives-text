# Senate refuses to freeze 'Star Wars'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Senate
refused yesterday to freeze spend
ing for research on "Star Wars,"
President Reagan's proposed
futuristic shield against nuclear at
tack.
The Senate rejected, 78-21, a
move by Sen. John Kerry (D-
Mass.) which basically would have
limited Star Wars spending to the
current level of $1.4 billion.
Still pending as the Senate
worked on a Pentagon spending
bill were 15 other proposals that
would give Reagan less than the
$3.7 billion he sought for the pro
gram next year.
Kerry said that even Star Wars
supporters agree the system won't
be totally effective, and added that
"any system less than 100 percent
effective renders us open to an un
acceptable level of damage" from
a Soviet strike.
But Sen. John Warner (R-Va.)
said Kerry's move "would gut the
program" and contended the re
search plan was the only reason
the Soviets had renewed arms con
trol talks.

The fight came as the legislators
tried to finish work on a bill aut
horizing most of a record $302 bil
lion Pentagon budget for next
year, an amount that would limit
defense spending increases to the
inflation rate.
Reagan has reluctantly ap
proved the figure in the Senate
bill, although he originally sought
a 5.9 percent hike beyond infla
tion.
The Democrat-controlled
House is considering an even
smaller Pentagon budget than the
Republican-led Senate and differ
ences between the two bills will be
resolved later by a conference
committee.
At least 16 amendments were
pending on Star Wars, with most
of them proposing to limit the size
and scope of the program.
Reagan originally proposed
spending $3.7 billion in fiscal 1986
for his Star Wars program, offi
cially known as the Strategic
Defense Initiative. The Pentagon
is spending $ 1.4 billion on the pro
gram this year.
