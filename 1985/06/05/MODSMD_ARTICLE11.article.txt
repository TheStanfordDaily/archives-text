Heat wave continues
ATLANTA — Southern states baked in swel
tering temperatures for a fourth consecutive day
yesterday in a heat wave blamed for one death in
Florida, record electricity consumption across
four states and a strong sellers' market for fans.
Temperatures near or above 100 degrees have
been common since Saturday in Georgia,
Florida, Alabama, South Carolina and Missis
sippi.
"I had a woman come in this morning and buy
a pool for her dog," said Paul Spivey, a manager
of a K-mart in Anderson, S.C. "She said she
found the dog in the birdbath."
The National Weather Service predicted no
immediate relief, with high temperatures and no
rain expected to continue through the week.
Thermometers at Augusta rose to 101 degrees
yesterday, three degrees above the former record
for the date that had stood since 1911. Athens
and Jacksonville, Fla., sizzled to record highs of
100. Other records yesterday included 96 at
Greer, S.C.; 97 at Mobile, Ala.; 98 at Orlando,
Fla., and 97 at Pensacola, Fla.
A 42-year-old woman died of a heat-induced
heart attack Monday in Jacksonville, her brother
quoted a doctor as saying. A police report said
rescue workers found the woman collapsed with
no blood pressure and a body temperature of 108
degrees.
There has been little relief from the heat, even
at night. Atlanta recorded its highest overnight
low temperature for any June 3 when it went
down only to 75 degrees at dawn Monday.
The heat wave is being caused by warm air
swinging around a high pressure system called a

subsidence, 150 miles west of Tampa, Fla., said
Marvin Maddox, meteorologist for the weather
service in Atlanta.
In Georgia, John Buchanan, appliances
manager at a K-mart store in Augusta, said,
"Every customer that has come in and every
phone call has been for fans," said "The air con
ditioners just aren't doing it."
Farmers in southern Alabama rigged showers
to cool cattle and hogs, and Mississippi officials
warned of possible heavy poultry losses.
In Mississippi, schools operated on shortened
schedules Monday and yesterday in Vicksburg
and Warren County, and schools in Jackson
joined them yesterday.
Outdoor training at the Parris Island Marine
Corps Training Station in Beaufort, S.C., was
stopped Monday when the temperature reached
103 degrees on its way to a high of 108.6, the
hottest spot in the state. Training resumed yes
terday after a slight drop in the temperature.
Utilities reported record demands for
electricity Monday in Florida, Mississippi, Geor
gia and Alabama.
Shultz arrives in Lisbon
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State George
Shultz flew to Lisbon, Portugal, yesterday for a
meeting of NATO foreign ministers that was
likely to be dominated by questions about
whether the administration will abrogate the un
ratified SALT II nuclear weapons treaty.
Shultz intends to use the two-day conference
to consult with the allies on the matter, and Presi
dent Reagan was expected to make a decision
later this week. He will notify Congress of his

decision Monday.
A senior administration official, who asked not
to be identified, said the spring NATO mini
sterial meeting outside of Lisbon would provide
the first real chance the administration has had to
consult with its allies over the nuclear weapons
issue.
The allies were expected to express anxiety
about any abrogation of the treaty, which Reagan
has denounced as fatally flawed.
However, even though the treaty was never ac
tually ratified, the Reagan administration has
taken the position that it would not undercut the
agreement so long as the Soviets did the same.
But the administration has repeatedly con
tended that the Soviets have seriously violated
the treaty. Although SALT II forbids deploy
ment of more than one new ICBM, the United
States maintains that Moscow is in the process of
developing and testing two new systems.
Market advances
The stock market posted a modest advance
yesterday, but a closing surge sputtered in the
final moments to leave the Dow Jones Industrial
Average a shade below the record level estab
lished only two sessions earlier.
Several transportation and utility issues were
among the gainers. Some energy issues were
lower amid continued speculation that oil prices
might fall.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
which fell 4.48 on Monday, recovered most of
that by rising 4.37 to close at 1,315.30. That was
just below last Friday's record close of 1,315.41.
