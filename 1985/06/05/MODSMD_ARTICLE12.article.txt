Duke weighs tax plan
SACRAMENTO — Gov. George Deuk
mejian said yesterday he would oppose President
Reagan's tax simplification plan if it is proven to
be unfair to Californians, hut that so far he has
seen no evidence that is the case.
The Republican governor, who has been one
of Reagan's most consistent supporters, again
stopped short of an unequivocal endorsement of
the president's income tax reform plan.
But he parted company with critics who con
tend that the provisions of Reagan's plan which
would eliminate federal income tax deductions
for state and local taxes would hurt Californians
far more than taxpayers in other states because
this state has substantially higher state and local
taxes.

That analysis is "not necessarily accurate,"
Deukmejian said, citing other provisions, such as
bigger personal deductions and lower overall
rates, which he said more than offset the loss of
deductions for state and local income, sales and
property taxes.
"If I concluded that it failed the fairness test
. . . I would certainly speak out (against it),"
Deukmejian said, adding that he will not make a
final decision until his Department of Finance
has made a thorough analysis of the plan
On other subjects in a Capitol news confer
ence, Deukmejian denied making cuts in the en
forcement of state worker protection programs
and said he still has not decided whether he will
support or oppose proposals for the University of
California to sell its stock in firms doing business
in South Africa.

Clove study approved
SACRAMENTO — The Assembly Health
Committee approved a plan yesterday to make a
scientific study of clove cigarettes to determine
whether the pungent, aromatic smokes injure the
lungs.
The panel approved A 82559 by Assemblyman
Richard Mountjoy (R-Monrovia) which the law
maker introduced on behalf of the city of Azusa.
Local officials there reported that young
people in the area smoked clove cigarettes under
the belief that the cigarettes were "herbal" and
less dangerous than tobacco-filled cigarettes.
Today's weather
Fair with highs in the 70s.
