## Basic rights concern lawyer 
### BARBARA SCHULER Senior staff writer 
Referred to as "a sort of Clarence
Darrow of the appellate court" by
one writer, attorney Leonard B.
Boudin, defender of alleged commu
nists, anti-war protesters, labor uni
onists and other political dissidents,
claims he is not political. He sounds
sincere, if not himself entirely con
vinced.
"I've never regarded myself as a
political animal. Nobody believes that
because of the kinds of clients I've
had or the kinds of articles I've writ
ten, but the truth is that I've always
thought of myself basically as an
American liberal fighting for consti
tutional principles, believing firmly in
the Bill of Rights," says Boudin, a
guest professor this quarter at Stan
ford Law School.
Since his admission to the New
York bar in 1 Boudin has spent
nearly a half century "protecting the
rights of individuals against the gov
ernment" and, in particular, defend
ing "people in their assertion of their
First and Fifth Amendment rights

'It is the left that has been oppressed in this country
historically, not the right. I have always been concerned
about governmental abuse of power, so those are the
people whom I was interested in protecting.'

before congressional committees and
grand juries," he says.
Boudin once boasted to The New
York Times that he and his law
partner, Victor Rabinowitz, had
defended more people before Sen.
Joseph McCarthy's investigations
subcommittee and the House Un-
American Activities Committee than
any other law firm. Seeing his role
primarily as one of protection,
Boudin says,"I feel that my work
has, to a tremendous extent, been a
defensive operation rather than one
that really advances the course of his
tory, the way I would have liked it to
do."
Despite this overall feeling, Boudin
acknowledges that some of his vic
tories have had a significant impact
on legal histoiy. He cites the 1958
Supreme Court case in which he se
cured the constitutional right to travel
regardless of political beliefs and as
sociations. Boudin calls the case,
brought on behalf of artist Rockwell
Kent against the State Department,

the "one clear-cut contribution to the
field of law which I'm willing to admit
is a contribution."
One of more than 20 arguments he
has made before the Supreme Court,
the case — Kent v. Dulles — ended
an unofficial decade-long ban on pass
ports to suspected communists and
their so-called fellow travelers.
Members of the 1960s New Left
following the lead of their Old Left
counterparts, turned to Boudin as
their First Amendment rights increas
ingly came under attack during both
the Johnson and Nixon administra
tions.
In 1966, when Julian Bond, then
state representative-elect, was barred
from taking his seat in the Georgia
legislature because of his vocal oppo
sition to the Vietnam War, Boudin
took Bond's case before the Supreme
Court, and won.
Boudin numbers among the most
personally satisfying cases of his long
career the defense of such Vietnam
critics as Bond, Dr. Benjamin Spock,
indicted for conspiracy to violate
Selective Service laws. Eqpah Ahmad

in the Harrisburg-Berrigan case that
charged the defendants with, among
other things, conspiracy to kidnap
Henry Kissinger, and Daniel Ellsberg
in the Pentagon Papers trial.
The Ellsberg case, probably the
most familiar of Boudin's cases in
popular memory, was thrown out of
court as the result of "improper gov
ernment conduct" that included bur
glaries and illegal wiretaps carried out
by the "plumbers" of Watergate
notoriety.
According to Boudin, "Watergate
helped us in the Ellsberg case, and we
helped the fall of President Nixon on
the Watergate issue."
A May 28, 1973, editorial in the
Nation, a weekly news magazine,
lauded Boudin for his role in the case.
"Mr. Boudin, like his uncle, the late
Louis Boudin, is a lawyer's
lawyer. . . . [His] performance at the
Ellsberg trial may well mark the high
point in a brilliant career at the bar."
But a White House memorandum
written by E. Howard Hunt, who, in

addition to his role in Watergate, was
a key CIA orchcstrator of the 1961
Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, des
cribed Boudin in less glowing terms.
His memorandum calls Boudin
"both famous and notorious for his
career-long defense of the Commu
nist Party, Castro Cuba, assorted
spies, perjurers, fellow travelers, con
spirators, agitators and violent revo
lutionaries."
The document continues: "To the
dismay of his admirers, Ellsberg, by
retaining Boudin to defend him . . .
becomes just one more client of a
man and a law firm whose dedication
over the years to the interests of our
foreign and domestic enemies has
remained unwavering and absolute."
Stanford Law Prof. Barbara Bab
cock paints a much less sinister
picture of Boudin, whom she calls
one of her "heroes."
"He has always been there
whenever there has been some kind
of unpopular cause or persecution
going on," she says."He takes a
lawyer's stance in that he represents
people who have cases that should be

made for them."
Babcock asserts that Boudin has
refused to fall prey to the fear of
many lawyers that "they'll be identi
fied with their clients, and they'll be
considered pariah themselves" for
representing political undesirables.
He "has just laid that aside and taken
on all kinds of clients," she says.
Boudin acknowledges that the
clients he has represented over the
years have colored his reputation,
particularly in the eyes of the U.S.
government. "The government will
identify, depending upon which ad
ministration is in office, anybody
representing people on the left or
governments such as Cuba and An
gola, which I've represented, with the
politics of the client. So, if it regards
the client as the enemy, it essentially
regards the lawyer as the enemy. This
was true during a long part of my life
as a lawyer," Boudin says.
While the extent of his commit
ment to protecting the constitutional
rights of political heretics has earned

him laurels from left activists and
large segments of the legal commu
nity, government officials in both
Democratic and Republican ad
ministrations have considered Boudin
a threat and alleged that he had com
munist affiliations.
"I am aware of the fact that many
people on the left and many people in
the government professed to have
thought that I was a member of the
Communist Party, or a communist,"
Boudin says.
"They were all wrong. And they
were wrong not because of any fear
on my part, because I had a very high
view of many people on the left,
whether they were communists or
not communists," Boudin says.
Rather, he explains, joining any poli
tical party did not fit with his view of
himself as "basically a professional
lawyer."
But despite such disclaimers,
Boudin was an easy target for govern
ment red-baiters. Nephew of the
famed attorney and socialist
theoretician, Louis Boudin, who hob
nobbed with Lenin, Trotsky and Rosa
Luxemburg, the younger Boudin
worked in his uncle's law office from
1936 to 1943.
In addition, as the first counsel for
the Emergency Civil Liberties Com
mittee (ECLC), he argued numerous
cases involving questions of Commu
nist Party affiliation, such as the
" right-to-travel" cases and the legal
battle for the right to receive mail
from a communist country. The
ECLC, a sort of alternative ACLU,
was formed in 1951 by journalist I.F.
Stone and others to defend people
whom the American Civil Liberties
Union considered too far to the left.
According to Boudin, the ACLU
"has been tremendously improved"
since the '40s and '50s, when Cold
War hysteria led it to "default in its
duty to protect the Bill of Rights."
Boudin's membership in the Na
tional Lawyer's Guild also provided
fodder for government attacks on
him. Although the Attorney General
was unsuccessful in attempts to regis
ter the guild as a subversive organi
zation, the guild's involvement in
litigation for members of the Com
munist Party and others on the left in
curred the wrath of some high
ranking government officials.
Boudin's affiliation with the guild, as
chair of its labor law and constitu
tional rights committees, resulted in
yet another black mark against him.
In 1956, Boudin was subpoenaed
to testify before the Hpusp Un-
American Activities Committee
(HUAC). When he stated under oath
that he was not and had never been a
member of the Communist Party, his
denial was met with disbelief.

He recalls: "The committee was
pretty shockcd because they expected
me to take the Fifth Amendment. . ..
They then announced to the press
they were sending the matter to the
Department of Justice for a possible
perjury prosecution. And that was a
period when many people were very
worried."
Although colleagues advised him
not to answer on the grounds that he
might be framed, as had so many
others, Boudin insisted on clearing
his name. "I felt that in terms of my
own practice and the better protec
tion not only of myself but of my
clients, the best thing would be to
clear the matter up publicly," he ex
plains.
Soon after the hearing, the State
Department granted Boudin the
passport for which he had earlier
sued, making him the only lawyer of
his ilk with the right to travel abroad.
He jokes about his failure to capi
talize on the situation.
"If I had been a good businessman
... I would have traveled all around
the world and been retained by all the
governments and clients who my col
leagues couldn't get to," says Boudin,
smiling. "But 1 wasn't very realistic

then, nor am I now, so I lost these
hundreds of clients."
The representation of foreign gov
ernments in their disputes with the
United States has thus far been only a
sideline for Boudin, whose firm has
represented such clients as the gov
ernments of Cuba, Angola, Chile
(under former President Allende),
British Guyana, Tanzania, Kenya
and, more recently, Greece. Until
now, most of the work on these cases
has been delegated to other partners
in the firm. But lately, at age 72,
Boudin sees his interests shifting
toward greater involvement in the
field of international law.
"First, we are not faced today with
the kind of incessant inquisitional
operations of the government that we
had. Second, intellectually, there's
something more interesting about
some of the problems that are raised
in the international field," explains
Boudin.

'The family doctor'
Although Boudin came from a
family teeming with lawyers, he says


David Kravetz/Daily
"I've always thought of myself basically as an American liberal fighting
for constitutional principles, believing firmly in the Bill of Rights," says
Leonard B. Boudin, a guest professor at the law school.
it was his uncle, Louis Boudin, who
had "the greatest influence" on his
life and the direction of his career.
"In a large sense, except that I have
not moved into his theoretical field of
socialism, I think my career has been
patterned after his," says Boudin. "I
learned labor law and constitutional
law and ways of legal thinking and
behavior toward other lawyers and
relationships with clients from Louie
Boudin."
"He had a equality that we younger,
if I can call myself younger, lawyers
don't have. He knew every aspect of
law. . . . And, of course, today, in
1985, we're all specialists. ... So,
that generation of the early 20th cen
tury was a better generation, it seems
to me. They were like the family doc
tor, and we are not family doctors
anymore," he says.
Boudin left his uncle's firm in 1943
with another junior partner, Victor
Rabinowitz, to open an office of their
own. Today, 42 years later,
Rabinowitz, Boudin, Standard,
Krinsky & Lieberman has grown to
include 16 lawyers, eight of them
partners. "I don't know of any other
small firm that's been around for that
long," says Boudin's partner,
Rabinowitz. "And there's been a lot
of change of personnel, but the two of
us are still here."
Elaborating on his praise of
Boudin, whom he calls "a brilliant
lawyer with a very active and legally
fruitful imagination," Rabinowitz
says,"He works out legal theories
and arguments in ways other lawyers
may not even consider, and he sees
things that most other lawyers don't
see." Rabinowitz laughs, "Some of
them aren't there, but enough of
them are there to make him a very
successful lawyer."
According to Rabinowitz, Boudin
excels at arguing "cases in which big
questions of policy are involved,
rather than little midgets of fact. We
rarely handle cases where the big
issue is whether the light was red or
green," he says.
He cites the Spock conspiracy trial
as an example. It raised "a big impor

tant freedom-of-speech question. It
was not a question of what leaflet
[Spock] handed out where, or even
what he was trying to say, but
whether it was legal to say it,"
Rabinowitz explains.
In journalist Peter Schrag's book
on the Pentagon Papers case, he
writes of the influence of Boudin's
view of the law on his legal style.
"There would be occasions when his
courtly absent-mindedness seemed to
verge on open disdain for the
mundane concerns of daily litiga
tion. ...
"His concern with the subtleties of
high-level legal debate, where he was
often brilliant, and his casual refer
ences to the Supreme Court cases in
which he had participated became in
themselves a kind of ideology, a view
of the law as an eminently civilized
and reasonable institution," Schrag
writes.
'The great citizens'
Boudin, a scholar as well as a
lawyer, says part of the joy of his
spring sabbatical from the practice of
law is the chance to work uninter
rupted by clients or the pressures of
litigation on research and writing law
review articles.
He also appreciates the
"congeniality of the faculty" and the
opportunities to discuss with them the
legal issues and philosophical ques
tions which so engage him. Having
taught at numerous law schools in
cluding Harvard, Yale and UC-
Berkeley, Boudin compares Stanford
Law School favorably to these other
institutions. Particularly pleased with
his colleagues, Boudin matter-of
factly states, "I happen to love law
school faculties, and this one happens
to be my favorite."
Such candid comments indicate
some measure of the charm Boudin is
said to exude in the courtroom. Aut
hors of a book on the Harrisburg-
Berrigan trial called Boudin "by far
the most entertaining attorney of the
trial." They described him
"frequently emphasiz(ing) points by
pleading poor hearing. Or if tes
timony was going particularly well for
the defense, he would amble about
the courtroom, in the jury's sight,
smiling puckishly, his thinning grey

hair askew, his spectacles pushed
atop his head."
Boudin admits that the drama of
the courtroom is one of the pleasures
of being a lawyer. He says he makes it
a point to hear oral arguments in the
Supreme Court several times a year:
"I like it both as drama and as a study
of the court,"he says.
Although he appears to be some
one consumed by his work, Boudin
does make time for tennis, jaunts on
his bicycle, chess and books. Having
grown up in what he calls "a literary
house," Boudin these days is reading

18th century British history, 19th
century novels and biographies of
lawyers and judges. He also admits to
reading suspense novels.
Born July 20, 1912, the son of
Austrian and Russian parents,
Boudin spent his childhood in Brook
lyn and his adolescent years in Rich
mond Hill, Queens. A life-long New
Yorker, he has lived in Greenwich
Village since his marriage in 1937 to
the poet Jean Roisman.
Boudin is a father of two who
lavishes on both his children words of

praise and deep respect. While Mi
chael, a former editor of the Harvard
Law Review, inherited his father's
passion for law and has become a
highly respected anti-trust lawyer in
Washington, Kathy, according to
Boudin, inherited her father's passion
for social justice and is now serving a
prison term of 20 years to life for her
involvement in activities of the
Weather Underground, a radical
splinter group of the Students for a
Democratic Society.
Living underground from March
1970 until her arrest, a fugitive on the
FBl's 10 most wanted list, Kathy was
apprehended in October 1981 for her
part in the Nyack, N.Y., Brink's rob
bery which left two policemen and a
Brink's guard dead.
Of the direction of his daughter's
politics, Boudin says,"I think I un
derstand her general life movement,
which I regard — to the extent that a
parent could be objective — as com
pletely idealistic. I've always said that
I know of nobody who is concerned
for the welfare of humanity to the ex
tent that Kathy has been."
Her early involvement in the civil
rights movement and her work with
welfare mothers in Cleveland evolved
into a more militant anti
establishment politics in the late '60s
as Vietnam War protests grew in
creasingly violent.
In a discussion of his own views on
methods of effecting social change,
Boudin mentions Joan Baez' talk at
Stanford last month. "She went back
to her theme of Ghandi and peaceful
opposition, and I suppose that that
has been my general principle, be
cause I think that naked power is not
on the side of people. It's on the side
of government, and government uses
that power.
"At the same time," Boudin says,
"I can understand the feelings of
futility, of weakness and of outrage
that people had on campuses in the
1960s and 19705."
Such feelings may well have been
behind Kathy's turn toward more
radical political tactics. While her
support for armed revolution cannot
be denied, Kathy did not carry a gun
during the Nyack robbery, nor at any
other time, according to Boudin. He
points out that Kathy "was not
(personally) responsible for the death

of anybody or the assault on
anybody." He says it has never been
proved that she was even at the shop
ping mall where the robbery took
place. This contributes to his assess
ment of her sentence as "a dreadful
one and certainly disproportionate to
what she did."
He believes the punishment doled
out to his daughter — who is in
eligible for parole until 17 years from
the date of her sentencing — was
"really due to the fact that she was re
garded as being on the left. People
have suggested — and it may be true
— that my role over the last 40 or 50
years is a factor that hurt her, in the
sense that the government couldn't
touch me, but it could touch her."
This belief of Boudin's, that his
daughter's politics unfairly influenced
her treatment, not only in the courts
but in prison as well, is reiterated as
he explains the motivations for his
life's work.
Frequently asked why he so often
represents those on the left, Boudin
says it is, in part, because these
people have come to him. But more
fundamentally, he says,"It is the left
that has been oppressed in this
country historically, not the right. I
have always been concerned about
governmental abuse of power, so
those are the people whom I was in
terested in protecting."
Boudin has no regrets about the
kinds of clients he has taken over the
years. "I regard people whom I've
represented as being all people of
good works who have really devoted
themselves to the working class and
to the welfare of the people of the
country," he explains.
"I regard all of them as the great
citizens of the country. That's why
I've had such pleasure in representing
them. I've never seen any of them do
anything or say anything harmful to
the country," confesses Boudin.
"So, I've represented varied groups
— liberal, left, a few conservatives,
but not many, 1 must admit — and
many of them have disagreed with
one another, sometimes violently.
But I think they've all been essen
tially on the right side."
Boudin pauses for a moment and
laughs. "This does make me sound
political, doesn't it? But I still don't
think I am."

Boudin sees his interests shifting
toward greater involvement in the
field of international law.
"First, we are not faced today with
the kind of incessant inquisitional
operations of the government that we
had. Second, intellectually, there's
something more interesting about
some of the problems that are raised
in the international field," explains
Boudin.

'The family doctor'
Although Boudin came from a
family teeming with lawyers, he says


David Kravetz/Daily
"I've always thought of myself basically as an American liberal fighting
for constitutional principles, believing firmly in the Bill of Rights," says
Leonard B. Boudin, a guest professor at the law school.
it was his uncle, Louis Boudin, who
had "the greatest influence" on his
life and the direction of his career.
"In a large sense, except that I have
not moved into his theoretical field of
socialism, I think my career has been
patterned after his," says Boudin. "I
learned labor law and constitutional
law and ways of legal thinking and
behavior toward other lawyers and
relationships with clients from Louie
Boudin."
"He had a equality that we younger,
if I can call myself younger, lawyers
don't have. He knew every aspect of
law. . . . And, of course, today, in
1985, we're all specialists. ... So,
that generation of the early 20th cen
tury was a better generation, it seems
to me. They were like the family doc
tor, and we are not family doctors
anymore," he says.
Boudin left his uncle's firm in 1943
with another junior partner, Victor
Rabinowitz, to open an office of their
own. Today, 42 years later,
Rabinowitz, Boudin, Standard,
Krinsky & Lieberman has grown to
include 16 lawyers, eight of them
partners. "I don't know of any other
small firm that's been around for that
long," says Boudin's partner,
Rabinowitz. "And there's been a lot
of change of personnel, but the two of
us are still here."
Elaborating on his praise of
Boudin, whom he calls "a brilliant
lawyer with a very active and legally
fruitful imagination," Rabinowitz
says,"He works out legal theories
and arguments in ways other lawyers
may not even consider, and he sees
things that most other lawyers don't
see." Rabinowitz laughs, "Some of
them aren't there, but enough of
them are there to make him a very
successful lawyer."
According to Rabinowitz, Boudin
excels at arguing "cases in which big
questions of policy are involved,
rather than little midgets of fact. We
rarely handle cases where the big
issue is whether the light was red or
green," he says.
He cites the Spock conspiracy trial
as an example. It raised "a big impor

tant freedom-of-speech question. It
was not a question of what leaflet
[Spock] handed out where, or even
what he was trying to say, but
whether it was legal to say it,"
Rabinowitz explains.
In journalist Peter Schrag's book
on the Pentagon Papers case, he
writes of the influence of Boudin's
view of the law on his legal style.
"There would be occasions when his
courtly absent-mindedness seemed to
verge on open disdain for the
mundane concerns of daily litiga
tion. ...
"His concern with the subtleties of
high-level legal debate, where he was
often brilliant, and his casual refer
ences to the Supreme Court cases in
which he had participated became in
themselves a kind of ideology, a view
of the law as an eminently civilized
and reasonable institution," Schrag
writes.
'The great citizens'
Boudin, a scholar as well as a
lawyer, says part of the joy of his
spring sabbatical from the practice of
law is the chance to work uninter
rupted by clients or the pressures of
litigation on research and writing law
review articles.
He also appreciates the
"congeniality of the faculty" and the
opportunities to discuss with them the
legal issues and philosophical ques
tions which so engage him. Having
taught at numerous law schools in
cluding Harvard, Yale and UC-
Berkeley, Boudin compares Stanford
Law School favorably to these other
institutions. Particularly pleased with
his colleagues, Boudin matter-of
factly states, "I happen to love law
school faculties, and this one happens
to be my favorite."
Such candid comments indicate
some measure of the charm Boudin is
said to exude in the courtroom. Aut
hors of a book on the Harrisburg-
Berrigan trial called Boudin "by far
the most entertaining attorney of the
trial." They described him
"frequently emphasiz(ing) points by
pleading poor hearing. Or if tes
timony was going particularly well for
the defense, he would amble about
the courtroom, in the jury's sight,
smiling puckishly, his thinning grey

hair askew, his spectacles pushed
atop his head."
Boudin admits that the drama of
the courtroom is one of the pleasures
of being a lawyer. He says he makes it
a point to hear oral arguments in the
Supreme Court several times a year:
"I like it both as drama and as a study
of the court,"he says.
Although he appears to be some
one consumed by his work, Boudin
does make time for tennis, jaunts on
his bicycle, chess and books. Having
grown up in what he calls "a literary
house," Boudin these days is reading

18th century British history, 19th
century novels and biographies of
lawyers and judges. He also admits to
reading suspense novels.
Born July 20, 1912, the son of
Austrian and Russian parents,
Boudin spent his childhood in Brook
lyn and his adolescent years in Rich
mond Hill, Queens. A life-long New
Yorker, he has lived in Greenwich
Village since his marriage in 1937 to
the poet Jean Roisman.
Boudin is a father of two who
lavishes on both his children words of

praise and deep respect. While Mi
chael, a former editor of the Harvard
Law Review, inherited his father's
passion for law and has become a
highly respected anti-trust lawyer in
Washington, Kathy, according to
Boudin, inherited her father's passion
for social justice and is now serving a
prison term of 20 years to life for her
involvement in activities of the
Weather Underground, a radical
splinter group of the Students for a
Democratic Society.
Living underground from March
1970 until her arrest, a fugitive on the
FBl's 10 most wanted list, Kathy was
apprehended in October 1981 for her
part in the Nyack, N.Y., Brink's rob
bery which left two policemen and a
Brink's guard dead.
Of the direction of his daughter's
politics, Boudin says,"I think I un
derstand her general life movement,
which I regard — to the extent that a
parent could be objective — as com
pletely idealistic. I've always said that
I know of nobody who is concerned
for the welfare of humanity to the ex
tent that Kathy has been."
Her early involvement in the civil
rights movement and her work with
welfare mothers in Cleveland evolved
into a more militant anti
establishment politics in the late '60s
as Vietnam War protests grew in
creasingly violent.
In a discussion of his own views on
methods of effecting social change,
Boudin mentions Joan Baez' talk at
Stanford last month. "She went back
to her theme of Ghandi and peaceful
opposition, and I suppose that that
has been my general principle, be
cause I think that naked power is not
on the side of people. It's on the side
of government, and government uses
that power.
"At the same time," Boudin says,
"I can understand the feelings of
futility, of weakness and of outrage
that people had on campuses in the
1960s and 19705."
Such feelings may well have been
behind Kathy's turn toward more
radical political tactics. While her
support for armed revolution cannot
be denied, Kathy did not carry a gun
during the Nyack robbery, nor at any
other time, according to Boudin. He
points out that Kathy "was not
(personally) responsible for the death

of anybody or the assault on
anybody." He says it has never been
proved that she was even at the shop
ping mall where the robbery took
place. This contributes to his assess
ment of her sentence as "a dreadful
one and certainly disproportionate to
what she did."
He believes the punishment doled
out to his daughter — who is in
eligible for parole until 17 years from
the date of her sentencing — was
"really due to the fact that she was re
garded as being on the left. People
have suggested — and it may be true
— that my role over the last 40 or 50
years is a factor that hurt her, in the
sense that the government couldn't
touch me, but it could touch her."
This belief of Boudin's, that his
daughter's politics unfairly influenced
her treatment, not only in the courts
but in prison as well, is reiterated as
he explains the motivations for his
life's work.
Frequently asked why he so often
represents those on the left, Boudin
says it is, in part, because these
people have come to him. But more
fundamentally, he says,"It is the left
that has been oppressed in this
country historically, not the right. I
have always been concerned about
governmental abuse of power, so
those are the people whom I was in
terested in protecting."
Boudin has no regrets about the
kinds of clients he has taken over the
years. "I regard people whom I've
represented as being all people of
good works who have really devoted
themselves to the working class and
to the welfare of the people of the
country," he explains.
"I regard all of them as the great
citizens of the country. That's why
I've had such pleasure in representing
them. I've never seen any of them do
anything or say anything harmful to
the country," confesses Boudin.
"So, I've represented varied groups
— liberal, left, a few conservatives,
but not many, 1 must admit — and
many of them have disagreed with
one another, sometimes violently.
But I think they've all been essen
tially on the right side."
Boudin pauses for a moment and
laughs. "This does make me sound
political, doesn't it? But I still don't
think I am."


Mark Wilson/Daily
Referred to as "a sort of Clarence
Darrow of the appellate court" by
one writer, attorney Leonard B.
Boudin, defender of alleged commu
nists, anti-war protesters, labor uni
onists and other political dissidents,
claims he is not political. He sounds
sincere, if not himself entirely con
vinced.
"I've never regarded myself as a
political animal. Nobody believes that
because of the kinds of clients I've
had or the kinds of articles I've writ
ten, but the truth is that I've always
thought of myself basically as an
American liberal fighting for consti
tutional principles, believing firmly in
the Bill of Rights," says Boudin, a
guest professor this quarter at Stan
ford Law School.
Since his admission to the New
York bar in 1 Boudin has spent
nearly a half century "protecting the
rights of individuals against the gov
ernment" and, in particular, defend
ing "people in their assertion of their
First and Fifth Amendment rights

'It is the left that has been oppressed in this country
historically, not the right. I have always been concerned
about governmental abuse of power, so those are the
people whom I was interested in protecting.'

before congressional committees and
grand juries," he says.
Boudin once boasted to The New
York Times that he and his law
partner, Victor Rabinowitz, had
defended more people before Sen.
Joseph McCarthy's investigations
subcommittee and the House Un-
American Activities Committee than
any other law firm. Seeing his role
primarily as one of protection,
Boudin says,"I feel that my work
has, to a tremendous extent, been a
defensive operation rather than one
that really advances the course of his
tory, the way I would have liked it to
do."
Despite this overall feeling, Boudin
acknowledges that some of his vic
tories have had a significant impact
on legal histoiy. He cites the 1958
Supreme Court case in which he se
cured the constitutional right to travel
regardless of political beliefs and as
sociations. Boudin calls the case,
brought on behalf of artist Rockwell
Kent against the State Department,

the "one clear-cut contribution to the
field of law which I'm willing to admit
is a contribution."
One of more than 20 arguments he
has made before the Supreme Court,
the case — Kent v. Dulles — ended
an unofficial decade-long ban on pass
ports to suspected communists and
their so-called fellow travelers.
Members of the 1960s New Left
following the lead of their Old Left
counterparts, turned to Boudin as
their First Amendment rights increas
ingly came under attack during both
the Johnson and Nixon administra
tions.
In 1966, when Julian Bond, then
state representative-elect, was barred
from taking his seat in the Georgia
legislature because of his vocal oppo
sition to the Vietnam War, Boudin
took Bond's case before the Supreme
Court, and won.
Boudin numbers among the most
personally satisfying cases of his long
career the defense of such Vietnam
critics as Bond, Dr. Benjamin Spock,
indicted for conspiracy to violate
Selective Service laws. Eqpah Ahmad

in the Harrisburg-Berrigan case that
charged the defendants with, among
other things, conspiracy to kidnap
Henry Kissinger, and Daniel Ellsberg
in the Pentagon Papers trial.
The Ellsberg case, probably the
most familiar of Boudin's cases in
popular memory, was thrown out of
court as the result of "improper gov
ernment conduct" that included bur
glaries and illegal wiretaps carried out
by the "plumbers" of Watergate
notoriety.
According to Boudin, "Watergate
helped us in the Ellsberg case, and we
helped the fall of President Nixon on
the Watergate issue."
A May 28, 1973, editorial in the
Nation, a weekly news magazine,
lauded Boudin for his role in the case.
"Mr. Boudin, like his uncle, the late
Louis Boudin, is a lawyer's
lawyer. . . . [His] performance at the
Ellsberg trial may well mark the high
point in a brilliant career at the bar."
But a White House memorandum
written by E. Howard Hunt, who, in

addition to his role in Watergate, was
a key CIA orchcstrator of the 1961
Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, des
cribed Boudin in less glowing terms.
His memorandum calls Boudin
"both famous and notorious for his
career-long defense of the Commu
nist Party, Castro Cuba, assorted
spies, perjurers, fellow travelers, con
spirators, agitators and violent revo
lutionaries."
The document continues: "To the
dismay of his admirers, Ellsberg, by
retaining Boudin to defend him . . .
becomes just one more client of a
man and a law firm whose dedication
over the years to the interests of our
foreign and domestic enemies has
remained unwavering and absolute."
Stanford Law Prof. Barbara Bab
cock paints a much less sinister
picture of Boudin, whom she calls
one of her "heroes."
"He has always been there
whenever there has been some kind
of unpopular cause or persecution
going on," she says."He takes a
lawyer's stance in that he represents
people who have cases that should be

made for them."
Babcock asserts that Boudin has
refused to fall prey to the fear of
many lawyers that "they'll be identi
fied with their clients, and they'll be
considered pariah themselves" for
representing political undesirables.
He "has just laid that aside and taken
on all kinds of clients," she says.
Boudin acknowledges that the
clients he has represented over the
years have colored his reputation,
particularly in the eyes of the U.S.
government. "The government will
identify, depending upon which ad
ministration is in office, anybody
representing people on the left or
governments such as Cuba and An
gola, which I've represented, with the
politics of the client. So, if it regards
the client as the enemy, it essentially
regards the lawyer as the enemy. This
was true during a long part of my life
as a lawyer," Boudin says.
While the extent of his commit
ment to protecting the constitutional
rights of political heretics has earned

him laurels from left activists and
large segments of the legal commu
nity, government officials in both
Democratic and Republican ad
ministrations have considered Boudin
a threat and alleged that he had com
munist affiliations.
"I am aware of the fact that many
people on the left and many people in
the government professed to have
thought that I was a member of the
Communist Party, or a communist,"
Boudin says.
"They were all wrong. And they
were wrong not because of any fear
on my part, because I had a very high
view of many people on the left,
whether they were communists or
not communists," Boudin says.
Rather, he explains, joining any poli
tical party did not fit with his view of
himself as "basically a professional
lawyer."
But despite such disclaimers,
Boudin was an easy target for govern
ment red-baiters. Nephew of the
famed attorney and socialist
theoretician, Louis Boudin, who hob
nobbed with Lenin, Trotsky and Rosa
Luxemburg, the younger Boudin
worked in his uncle's law office from
1936 to 1943.
In addition, as the first counsel for
the Emergency Civil Liberties Com
mittee (ECLC), he argued numerous
cases involving questions of Commu
nist Party affiliation, such as the
" right-to-travel" cases and the legal
battle for the right to receive mail
from a communist country. The
ECLC, a sort of alternative ACLU,
was formed in 1951 by journalist I.F.
Stone and others to defend people
whom the American Civil Liberties
Union considered too far to the left.
According to Boudin, the ACLU
"has been tremendously improved"
since the '40s and '50s, when Cold
War hysteria led it to "default in its
duty to protect the Bill of Rights."
Boudin's membership in the Na
tional Lawyer's Guild also provided
fodder for government attacks on
him. Although the Attorney General
was unsuccessful in attempts to regis
ter the guild as a subversive organi
zation, the guild's involvement in
litigation for members of the Com
munist Party and others on the left in
curred the wrath of some high
ranking government officials.
Boudin's affiliation with the guild, as
chair of its labor law and constitu
tional rights committees, resulted in
yet another black mark against him.
In 1956, Boudin was subpoenaed
to testify before the Hpusp Un-
American Activities Committee
(HUAC). When he stated under oath
that he was not and had never been a
member of the Communist Party, his
denial was met with disbelief.

He recalls: "The committee was
pretty shockcd because they expected
me to take the Fifth Amendment. . ..
They then announced to the press
they were sending the matter to the
Department of Justice for a possible
perjury prosecution. And that was a
period when many people were very
worried."
Although colleagues advised him
not to answer on the grounds that he
might be framed, as had so many
others, Boudin insisted on clearing
his name. "I felt that in terms of my
own practice and the better protec
tion not only of myself but of my
clients, the best thing would be to
clear the matter up publicly," he ex
plains.
Soon after the hearing, the State
Department granted Boudin the
passport for which he had earlier
sued, making him the only lawyer of
his ilk with the right to travel abroad.
He jokes about his failure to capi
talize on the situation.
"If I had been a good businessman
... I would have traveled all around
the world and been retained by all the
governments and clients who my col
leagues couldn't get to," says Boudin,
smiling. "But 1 wasn't very realistic

then, nor am I now, so I lost these
hundreds of clients."
The representation of foreign gov
ernments in their disputes with the
United States has thus far been only a
sideline for Boudin, whose firm has
represented such clients as the gov
ernments of Cuba, Angola, Chile
(under former President Allende),
British Guyana, Tanzania, Kenya
and, more recently, Greece. Until
now, most of the work on these cases
has been delegated to other partners
in the firm. But lately, at age 72,
Boudin sees his interests shifting
toward greater involvement in the
field of international law.
"First, we are not faced today with
the kind of incessant inquisitional
operations of the government that we
had. Second, intellectually, there's
something more interesting about
some of the problems that are raised
in the international field," explains
Boudin.

laughs. "This does make me sound
political, doesn't it? But I still don't
think I am."


Mark Wilson/Daily
Referred to as "a sort of Clarence
Darrow of the appellate court" by
one writer, attorney Leonard B.
Boudin, defender of alleged commu
nists, anti-war protesters, labor uni
onists and other political dissidents,
claims he is not political. He sounds
sincere, if not himself entirely con
vinced.
"I've never regarded myself as a
political animal. Nobody believes that
because of the kinds of clients I've
had or the kinds of articles I've writ
ten, but the truth is that I've always
thought of myself basically as an
American liberal fighting for consti
tutional principles, believing firmly in
the Bill of Rights," says Boudin, a
guest professor this quarter at Stan
ford Law School.
Since his admission to the New
York bar in 1 Boudin has spent
nearly a half century "protecting the
rights of individuals against the gov
ernment" and, in particular, defend
ing "people in their assertion of their
First and Fifth Amendment rights

'It is the left that has been oppressed in this country
historically, not the right. I have always been concerned
about governmental abuse of power, so those are the
people whom I was interested in protecting.'
— Leonard B. Boudin

before congressional committees and
grand juries," he says.
Boudin once boasted to The New
York Times that he and his law
partner, Victor Rabinowitz, had
defended more people before Sen.
Joseph McCarthy's investigations
subcommittee and the House Un-
American Activities Committee than
any other law firm. Seeing his role
primarily as one of protection,
Boudin says,"I feel that my work
has, to a tremendous extent, been a
defensive operation rather than one
that really advances the course of his
tory, the way I would have liked it to
do."
Despite this overall feeling, Boudin
acknowledges that some of his vic
tories have had a significant impact
on legal histoiy. He cites the 1958
Supreme Court case in which he se
cured the constitutional right to travel
regardless of political beliefs and as
sociations. Boudin calls the case,
brought on behalf of artist Rockwell
Kent against the State Department,

the "one clear-cut contribution to the
field of law which I'm willing to admit
is a contribution."
One of more than 20 arguments he
has made before the Supreme Court,
the case — Kent v. Dulles — ended
an unofficial decade-long ban on pass
ports to suspected communists and
their so-called fellow travelers.
Members of the 1960s New Left
following the lead of their Old Left
counterparts, turned to Boudin as
their First Amendment rights increas
ingly came under attack during both
the Johnson and Nixon administra
tions.
In 1966, when Julian Bond, then
state representative-elect, was barred
from taking his seat in the Georgia
legislature because of his vocal oppo
sition to the Vietnam War, Boudin
took Bond's case before the Supreme
Court, and won.
Boudin numbers among the most
personally satisfying cases of his long
career the defense of such Vietnam
critics as Bond, Dr. Benjamin Spock,
indicted for conspiracy to violate
Selective Service laws. Eqpah Ahmad

in the Harrisburg-Berrigan case that
charged the defendants with, among
other things, conspiracy to kidnap
Henry Kissinger, and Daniel Ellsberg
in the Pentagon Papers trial.
The Ellsberg case, probably the
most familiar of Boudin's cases in
popular memory, was thrown out of
court as the result of "improper gov
ernment conduct" that included bur
glaries and illegal wiretaps carried out
by the "plumbers" of Watergate
notoriety.
According to Boudin, "Watergate
helped us in the Ellsberg case, and we
helped the fall of President Nixon on
the Watergate issue."
A May 28, 1973, editorial in the
Nation, a weekly news magazine,
lauded Boudin for his role in the case.
"Mr. Boudin, like his uncle, the late
Louis Boudin, is a lawyer's
lawyer. . . . [His] performance at the
Ellsberg trial may well mark the high
point in a brilliant career at the bar."
But a White House memorandum
written by E. Howard Hunt, who, in

addition to his role in Watergate, was
a key CIA orchcstrator of the 1961
Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, des
cribed Boudin in less glowing terms.
His memorandum calls Boudin
"both famous and notorious for his
career-long defense of the Commu
nist Party, Castro Cuba, assorted
spies, perjurers, fellow travelers, con
spirators, agitators and violent revo
lutionaries."
The document continues: "To the
dismay of his admirers, Ellsberg, by
retaining Boudin to defend him . . .
becomes just one more client of a
man and a law firm whose dedication
over the years to the interests of our
foreign and domestic enemies has
remained unwavering and absolute."
Stanford Law Prof. Barbara Bab
cock paints a much less sinister
picture of Boudin, whom she calls
one of her "heroes."
"He has always been there
whenever there has been some kind
of unpopular cause or persecution
going on," she says."He takes a
lawyer's stance in that he represents
people who have cases that should be

made for them."
Babcock asserts that Boudin has
refused to fall prey to the fear of
many lawyers that "they'll be identi
fied with their clients, and they'll be
considered pariah themselves" for
representing political undesirables.
He "has just laid that aside and taken
on all kinds of clients," she says.
Boudin acknowledges that the
clients he has represented over the
years have colored his reputation,
particularly in the eyes of the U.S.
government. "The government will
identify, depending upon which ad
ministration is in office, anybody
representing people on the left or
governments such as Cuba and An
gola, which I've represented, with the
politics of the client. So, if it regards
the client as the enemy, it essentially
regards the lawyer as the enemy. This
was true during a long part of my life
as a lawyer," Boudin says.
While the extent of his commit
ment to protecting the constitutional
rights of political heretics has earned

him laurels from left activists and
large segments of the legal commu
nity, government officials in both
Democratic and Republican ad
ministrations have considered Boudin
a threat and alleged that he had com
munist affiliations.
"I am aware of the fact that many
people on the left and many people in
the government professed to have
thought that I was a member of the
Communist Party, or a communist,"
Boudin says.
"They were all wrong. And they
were wrong not because of any fear
on my part, because I had a very high
view of many people on the left,
whether they were communists or
not communists," Boudin says.
Rather, he explains, joining any poli
tical party did not fit with his view of
himself as "basically a professional
lawyer."
But despite such disclaimers,
Boudin was an easy target for govern
ment red-baiters. Nephew of the
famed attorney and socialist
theoretician, Louis Boudin, who hob
nobbed with Lenin, Trotsky and Rosa
Luxemburg, the younger Boudin
worked in his uncle's law office from
1936 to 1943.
In addition, as the first counsel for
the Emergency Civil Liberties Com
mittee (ECLC), he argued numerous
cases involving questions of Commu
nist Party affiliation, such as the
" right-to-travel" cases and the legal
battle for the right to receive mail
from a communist country. The
ECLC, a sort of alternative ACLU,
was formed in 1951 by journalist I.F.
Stone and others to defend people
whom the American Civil Liberties
Union considered too far to the left.
According to Boudin, the ACLU
"has been tremendously improved"
since the '40s and '50s, when Cold
War hysteria led it to "default in its
duty to protect the Bill of Rights."
Boudin's membership in the Na
tional Lawyer's Guild also provided
fodder for government attacks on
him. Although the Attorney General
was unsuccessful in attempts to regis
ter the guild as a subversive organi
zation, the guild's involvement in
litigation for members of the Com
munist Party and others on the left in
curred the wrath of some high
ranking government officials.
Boudin's affiliation with the guild, as
chair of its labor law and constitu
tional rights committees, resulted in
yet another black mark against him.
In 1956, Boudin was subpoenaed
to testify before the Hpusp Un-
American Activities Committee
(HUAC). When he stated under oath
that he was not and had never been a
member of the Communist Party, his
denial was met with disbelief.

He recalls: "The committee was
pretty shockcd because they expected
me to take the Fifth Amendment. . ..
They then announced to the press
they were sending the matter to the
Department of Justice for a possible
perjury prosecution. And that was a
period when many people were very
worried."
Although colleagues advised him
not to answer on the grounds that he
might be framed, as had so many
others, Boudin insisted on clearing
his name. "I felt that in terms of my
own practice and the better protec
tion not only of myself but of my
clients, the best thing would be to
clear the matter up publicly," he ex
plains.
Soon after the hearing, the State
Department granted Boudin the
passport for which he had earlier
sued, making him the only lawyer of
his ilk with the right to travel abroad.
He jokes about his failure to capi
talize on the situation.
"If I had been a good businessman
... I would have traveled all around
the world and been retained by all the
governments and clients who my col
leagues couldn't get to," says Boudin,
smiling. "But 1 wasn't very realistic

then, nor am I now, so I lost these
hundreds of clients."
The representation of foreign gov
ernments in their disputes with the
United States has thus far been only a
sideline for Boudin, whose firm has
represented such clients as the gov
ernments of Cuba, Angola, Chile
(under former President Allende),
British Guyana, Tanzania, Kenya
and, more recently, Greece. Until
now, most of the work on these cases
has been delegated to other partners
in the firm. But lately, at age 72,
Boudin sees his interests shifting
toward greater involvement in the
field of international law.
"First, we are not faced today with
the kind of incessant inquisitional
operations of the government that we
had. Second, intellectually, there's
something more interesting about
some of the problems that are raised
in the international field," explains
Boudin.

'The family doctor'
Although Boudin came from a
family teeming with lawyers, he says


David Kravetz/Daily
"I've always thought of myself basically as an American liberal fighting
for constitutional principles, believing firmly in the Bill of Rights," says
Leonard B. Boudin, a guest professor at the law school.
it was his uncle, Louis Boudin, who
had "the greatest influence" on his
life and the direction of his career.
"In a large sense, except that I have
not moved into his theoretical field of
socialism, I think my career has been
patterned after his," says Boudin. "I
learned labor law and constitutional
law and ways of legal thinking and
behavior toward other lawyers and
relationships with clients from Louie
Boudin."
"He had a equality that we younger,
if I can call myself younger, lawyers
don't have. He knew every aspect of
law. . . . And, of course, today, in
1985, we're all specialists. ... So,
that generation of the early 20th cen
tury was a better generation, it seems
to me. They were like the family doc
tor, and we are not family doctors
anymore," he says.
Boudin left his uncle's firm in 1943
with another junior partner, Victor
Rabinowitz, to open an office of their
own. Today, 42 years later,
Rabinowitz, Boudin, Standard,
Krinsky & Lieberman has grown to
include 16 lawyers, eight of them
partners. "I don't know of any other
small firm that's been around for that
long," says Boudin's partner,
Rabinowitz. "And there's been a lot
of change of personnel, but the two of
us are still here."
Elaborating on his praise of
Boudin, whom he calls "a brilliant
lawyer with a very active and legally
fruitful imagination," Rabinowitz
says,"He works out legal theories
and arguments in ways other lawyers
may not even consider, and he sees
things that most other lawyers don't
see." Rabinowitz laughs, "Some of
them aren't there, but enough of
them are there to make him a very
successful lawyer."
According to Rabinowitz, Boudin
excels at arguing "cases in which big
questions of policy are involved,
rather than little midgets of fact. We
rarely handle cases where the big
issue is whether the light was red or
green," he says.
He cites the Spock conspiracy trial
as an example. It raised "a big impor

tant freedom-of-speech question. It
was not a question of what leaflet
[Spock] handed out where, or even
what he was trying to say, but
whether it was legal to say it,"
Rabinowitz explains.
In journalist Peter Schrag's book
on the Pentagon Papers case, he
writes of the influence of Boudin's
view of the law on his legal style.
"There would be occasions when his
courtly absent-mindedness seemed to
verge on open disdain for the
mundane concerns of daily litiga
tion. ...
"His concern with the subtleties of
high-level legal debate, where he was
often brilliant, and his casual refer
ences to the Supreme Court cases in
which he had participated became in
themselves a kind of ideology, a view
of the law as an eminently civilized
and reasonable institution," Schrag
writes.
'The great citizens'
Boudin, a scholar as well as a
lawyer, says part of the joy of his
spring sabbatical from the practice of
law is the chance to work uninter
rupted by clients or the pressures of
litigation on research and writing law
review articles.
He also appreciates the
"congeniality of the faculty" and the
opportunities to discuss with them the
legal issues and philosophical ques
tions which so engage him. Having
taught at numerous law schools in
cluding Harvard, Yale and UC-
Berkeley, Boudin compares Stanford
Law School favorably to these other
institutions. Particularly pleased with
his colleagues, Boudin matter-of
factly states, "I happen to love law
school faculties, and this one happens
to be my favorite."
Such candid comments indicate
some measure of the charm Boudin is
said to exude in the courtroom. Aut
hors of a book on the Harrisburg-
Berrigan trial called Boudin "by far
the most entertaining attorney of the
trial." They described him
"frequently emphasiz(ing) points by
pleading poor hearing. Or if tes
timony was going particularly well for
the defense, he would amble about
the courtroom, in the jury's sight,
smiling puckishly, his thinning grey

hair askew, his spectacles pushed
atop his head."
Boudin admits that the drama of
the courtroom is one of the pleasures
of being a lawyer. He says he makes it
a point to hear oral arguments in the
Supreme Court several times a year:
"I like it both as drama and as a study
of the court,"he says.
Although he appears to be some
one consumed by his work, Boudin
does make time for tennis, jaunts on
his bicycle, chess and books. Having
grown up in what he calls "a literary
house," Boudin these days is reading

18th century British history, 19th
century novels and biographies of
lawyers and judges. He also admits to
reading suspense novels.
Born July 20, 1912, the son of
Austrian and Russian parents,
Boudin spent his childhood in Brook
lyn and his adolescent years in Rich
mond Hill, Queens. A life-long New
Yorker, he has lived in Greenwich
Village since his marriage in 1937 to
the poet Jean Roisman.
Boudin is a father of two who
lavishes on both his children words of

praise and deep respect. While Mi
chael, a former editor of the Harvard
Law Review, inherited his father's
passion for law and has become a
highly respected anti-trust lawyer in
Washington, Kathy, according to
Boudin, inherited her father's passion
for social justice and is now serving a
prison term of 20 years to life for her
involvement in activities of the
Weather Underground, a radical
splinter group of the Students for a
Democratic Society.
Living underground from March
1970 until her arrest, a fugitive on the
FBl's 10 most wanted list, Kathy was
apprehended in October 1981 for her
part in the Nyack, N.Y., Brink's rob
bery which left two policemen and a
Brink's guard dead.
Of the direction of his daughter's
politics, Boudin says,"I think I un
derstand her general life movement,
which I regard — to the extent that a
parent could be objective — as com
pletely idealistic. I've always said that
I know of nobody who is concerned
for the welfare of humanity to the ex
tent that Kathy has been."
Her early involvement in the civil
rights movement and her work with
welfare mothers in Cleveland evolved
into a more militant anti
establishment politics in the late '60s
as Vietnam War protests grew in
creasingly violent.
In a discussion of his own views on
methods of effecting social change,
Boudin mentions Joan Baez' talk at
Stanford last month. "She went back
to her theme of Ghandi and peaceful
opposition, and I suppose that that
has been my general principle, be
cause I think that naked power is not
on the side of people. It's on the side
of government, and government uses
that power.
"At the same time," Boudin says,
"I can understand the feelings of
futility, of weakness and of outrage
that people had on campuses in the
1960s and 19705."
Such feelings may well have been
behind Kathy's turn toward more
radical political tactics. While her
support for armed revolution cannot
be denied, Kathy did not carry a gun
during the Nyack robbery, nor at any
other time, according to Boudin. He
points out that Kathy "was not
(personally) responsible for the death

of anybody or the assault on
anybody." He says it has never been
proved that she was even at the shop
ping mall where the robbery took
place. This contributes to his assess
ment of her sentence as "a dreadful
one and certainly disproportionate to
what she did."
He believes the punishment doled
out to his daughter — who is in
eligible for parole until 17 years from
the date of her sentencing — was
"really due to the fact that she was re
garded as being on the left. People
have suggested — and it may be true
— that my role over the last 40 or 50
years is a factor that hurt her, in the
sense that the government couldn't
touch me, but it could touch her."
This belief of Boudin's, that his
daughter's politics unfairly influenced
her treatment, not only in the courts
but in prison as well, is reiterated as
he explains the motivations for his
life's work.
Frequently asked why he so often
represents those on the left, Boudin
says it is, in part, because these
people have come to him. But more
fundamentally, he says,"It is the left
that has been oppressed in this
country historically, not the right. I
have always been concerned about
governmental abuse of power, so
those are the people whom I was in
terested in protecting."
Boudin has no regrets about the
kinds of clients he has taken over the
years. "I regard people whom I've
represented as being all people of
good works who have really devoted
themselves to the working class and
to the welfare of the people of the
country," he explains.
"I regard all of them as the great
citizens of the country. That's why
I've had such pleasure in representing
them. I've never seen any of them do
anything or say anything harmful to
the country," confesses Boudin.
"So, I've represented varied groups
— liberal, left, a few conservatives,
but not many, 1 must admit — and
many of them have disagreed with
one another, sometimes violently.
But I think they've all been essen
tially on the right side."
Boudin pauses for a moment and
laughs. "This does make me sound
political, doesn't it? But I still don't
think I am."

now, most of the work on these cases
has been delegated to other partners
in the firm. But lately, at age 72,
Boudin sees his interests shifting
toward greater involvement in the
field of international law.
"First, we are not faced today with
the kind of incessant inquisitional
operations of the government that we
had. Second, intellectually, there's
something more interesting about
some of the problems that are raised
in the international field," explains
Boudin.

'The family doctor'
Although Boudin came from a
family teeming with lawyers, he says


David Kravetz/Daily
"I've always thought of myself basically as an American liberal fighting
for constitutional principles, believing firmly in the Bill of Rights," says
Leonard B. Boudin, a guest professor at the law school.
it was his uncle, Louis Boudin, who
had "the greatest influence" on his
life and the direction of his career.
"In a large sense, except that I have
not moved into his theoretical field of
socialism, I think my career has been
patterned after his," says Boudin. "I
learned labor law and constitutional
law and ways of legal thinking and
behavior toward other lawyers and
relationships with clients from Louie
Boudin."
"He had a equality that we younger,
if I can call myself younger, lawyers
don't have. He knew every aspect of
law. . . . And, of course, today, in
1985, we're all specialists. ... So,
that generation of the early 20th cen
tury was a better generation, it seems
to me. They were like the family doc
tor, and we are not family doctors
anymore," he says.
Boudin left his uncle's firm in 1943
with another junior partner, Victor
Rabinowitz, to open an office of their
own. Today, 42 years later,
Rabinowitz, Boudin, Standard,
Krinsky & Lieberman has grown to
include 16 lawyers, eight of them
partners. "I don't know of any other
small firm that's been around for that
long," says Boudin's partner,
Rabinowitz. "And there's been a lot
of change of personnel, but the two of
us are still here."
Elaborating on his praise of
Boudin, whom he calls "a brilliant
lawyer with a very active and legally
fruitful imagination," Rabinowitz
says,"He works out legal theories
and arguments in ways other lawyers
may not even consider, and he sees
things that most other lawyers don't
see." Rabinowitz laughs, "Some of
them aren't there, but enough of
them are there to make him a very
successful lawyer."
According to Rabinowitz, Boudin
excels at arguing "cases in which big
questions of policy are involved,
rather than little midgets of fact. We
rarely handle cases where the big
issue is whether the light was red or
green," he says.
He cites the Spock conspiracy trial
as an example. It raised "a big impor

tant freedom-of-speech question. It
was not a question of what leaflet
[Spock] handed out where, or even
what he was trying to say, but
whether it was legal to say it,"
Rabinowitz explains.
In journalist Peter Schrag's book
on the Pentagon Papers case, he
writes of the influence of Boudin's
view of the law on his legal style.
"There would be occasions when his
courtly absent-mindedness seemed to
verge on open disdain for the
mundane concerns of daily litiga
tion. ...
"His concern with the subtleties of
high-level legal debate, where he was
often brilliant, and his casual refer
ences to the Supreme Court cases in
which he had participated became in
themselves a kind of ideology, a view
of the law as an eminently civilized
and reasonable institution," Schrag
writes.
'The great citizens'
Boudin, a scholar as well as a
lawyer, says part of the joy of his
spring sabbatical from the practice of
law is the chance to work uninter
rupted by clients or the pressures of
litigation on research and writing law
review articles.
He also appreciates the
"congeniality of the faculty" and the
opportunities to discuss with them the
legal issues and philosophical ques
tions which so engage him. Having
taught at numerous law schools in
cluding Harvard, Yale and UC-
Berkeley, Boudin compares Stanford
Law School favorably to these other
institutions. Particularly pleased with
his colleagues, Boudin matter-of
factly states, "I happen to love law
school faculties, and this one happens
to be my favorite."
Such candid comments indicate
some measure of the charm Boudin is
said to exude in the courtroom. Aut
hors of a book on the Harrisburg-
Berrigan trial called Boudin "by far
the most entertaining attorney of the
trial." They described him
"frequently emphasiz(ing) points by
pleading poor hearing. Or if tes
timony was going particularly well for
the defense, he would amble about
the courtroom, in the jury's sight,
smiling puckishly, his thinning grey

hair askew, his spectacles pushed
atop his head."
Boudin admits that the drama of
the courtroom is one of the pleasures
of being a lawyer. He says he makes it
a point to hear oral arguments in the
Supreme Court several times a year:
"I like it both as drama and as a study
of the court,"he says.
Although he appears to be some
one consumed by his work, Boudin
does make time for tennis, jaunts on
his bicycle, chess and books. Having
grown up in what he calls "a literary
house," Boudin these days is reading

18th century British history, 19th
century novels and biographies of
lawyers and judges. He also admits to
reading suspense novels.
Born July 20, 1912, the son of
Austrian and Russian parents,
Boudin spent his childhood in Brook
lyn and his adolescent years in Rich
mond Hill, Queens. A life-long New
Yorker, he has lived in Greenwich
Village since his marriage in 1937 to
the poet Jean Roisman.
Boudin is a father of two who
lavishes on both his children words of

praise and deep respect. While Mi
chael, a former editor of the Harvard
Law Review, inherited his father's
passion for law and has become a
highly respected anti-trust lawyer in
Washington, Kathy, according to
Boudin, inherited her father's passion
for social justice and is now serving a
prison term of 20 years to life for her
involvement in activities of the
Weather Underground, a radical
splinter group of the Students for a
Democratic Society.
Living underground from March
1970 until her arrest, a fugitive on the
FBl's 10 most wanted list, Kathy was
apprehended in October 1981 for her
part in the Nyack, N.Y., Brink's rob
bery which left two policemen and a
Brink's guard dead.
Of the direction of his daughter's
politics, Boudin says,"I think I un
derstand her general life movement,
which I regard — to the extent that a
parent could be objective — as com
pletely idealistic. I've always said that
I know of nobody who is concerned
for the welfare of humanity to the ex
tent that Kathy has been."
Her early involvement in the civil
rights movement and her work with
welfare mothers in Cleveland evolved
into a more militant anti
establishment politics in the late '60s
as Vietnam War protests grew in
creasingly violent.
In a discussion of his own views on
methods of effecting social change,
Boudin mentions Joan Baez' talk at
Stanford last month. "She went back
to her theme of Ghandi and peaceful
opposition, and I suppose that that
has been my general principle, be
cause I think that naked power is not
on the side of people. It's on the side
of government, and government uses
that power.
"At the same time," Boudin says,
"I can understand the feelings of
futility, of weakness and of outrage
that people had on campuses in the
1960s and 19705."
Such feelings may well have been
behind Kathy's turn toward more
radical political tactics. While her
support for armed revolution cannot
be denied, Kathy did not carry a gun
during the Nyack robbery, nor at any
other time, according to Boudin. He
points out that Kathy "was not
(personally) responsible for the death

of anybody or the assault on
anybody." He says it has never been
proved that she was even at the shop
ping mall where the robbery took
place. This contributes to his assess
ment of her sentence as "a dreadful
one and certainly disproportionate to
what she did."
He believes the punishment doled
out to his daughter — who is in
eligible for parole until 17 years from
the date of her sentencing — was
"really due to the fact that she was re
garded as being on the left. People
have suggested — and it may be true
— that my role over the last 40 or 50
years is a factor that hurt her, in the
sense that the government couldn't
touch me, but it could touch her."
This belief of Boudin's, that his
daughter's politics unfairly influenced
her treatment, not only in the courts
but in prison as well, is reiterated as
he explains the motivations for his
life's work.
Frequently asked why he so often
represents those on the left, Boudin
says it is, in part, because these
people have come to him. But more
fundamentally, he says,"It is the left
that has been oppressed in this
country historically, not the right. I
have always been concerned about
governmental abuse of power, so
those are the people whom I was in
terested in protecting."
Boudin has no regrets about the
kinds of clients he has taken over the
years. "I regard people whom I've
represented as being all people of
good works who have really devoted
themselves to the working class and
to the welfare of the people of the
country," he explains.
"I regard all of them as the great
citizens of the country. That's why
I've had such pleasure in representing
them. I've never seen any of them do
anything or say anything harmful to
the country," confesses Boudin.
"So, I've represented varied groups
— liberal, left, a few conservatives,
but not many, 1 must admit — and
many of them have disagreed with
one another, sometimes violently.
But I think they've all been essen
tially on the right side."
Boudin pauses for a moment and
laughs. "This does make me sound
political, doesn't it? But I still don't
think I am."


Mark Wilson/Daily
Referred to as "a sort of Clarence
Darrow of the appellate court" by
one writer, attorney Leonard B.
Boudin, defender of alleged commu
nists, anti-war protesters, labor uni
onists and other political dissidents,
claims he is not political. He sounds
sincere, if not himself entirely con
vinced.
"I've never regarded myself as a
political animal. Nobody believes that
because of the kinds of clients I've
had or the kinds of articles I've writ
ten, but the truth is that I've always
thought of myself basically as an
American liberal fighting for consti
tutional principles, believing firmly in
the Bill of Rights," says Boudin, a
guest professor this quarter at Stan
ford Law School.
Since his admission to the New
York bar in 1 Boudin has spent
nearly a half century "protecting the
rights of individuals against the gov
ernment" and, in particular, defend
ing "people in their assertion of their
First and Fifth Amendment rights

'It is the left that has been oppressed in this country
historically, not the right. I have always been concerned
about governmental abuse of power, so those are the
people whom I was interested in protecting.'

before congressional committees and
grand juries," he says.
Boudin once boasted to The New
York Times that he and his law
partner, Victor Rabinowitz, had
defended more people before Sen.
Joseph McCarthy's investigations
subcommittee and the House Un-
American Activities Committee than
any other law firm. Seeing his role
primarily as one of protection,
Boudin says,"I feel that my work
has, to a tremendous extent, been a
defensive operation rather than one
that really advances the course of his
tory, the way I would have liked it to
do."
Despite this overall feeling, Boudin
acknowledges that some of his vic
tories have had a significant impact
on legal histoiy. He cites the 1958
Supreme Court case in which he se
cured the constitutional right to travel
regardless of political beliefs and as
sociations. Boudin calls the case,
brought on behalf of artist Rockwell
Kent against the State Department,

the "one clear-cut contribution to the
field of law which I'm willing to admit
is a contribution."
One of more than 20 arguments he
has made before the Supreme Court,
the case — Kent v. Dulles — ended
an unofficial decade-long ban on pass
ports to suspected communists and
their so-called fellow travelers.
Members of the 1960s New Left
following the lead of their Old Left
counterparts, turned to Boudin as
their First Amendment rights increas
ingly came under attack during both
the Johnson and Nixon administra
tions.
In 1966, when Julian Bond, then
state representative-elect, was barred
from taking his seat in the Georgia
legislature because of his vocal oppo
sition to the Vietnam War, Boudin
took Bond's case before the Supreme
Court, and won.
Boudin numbers among the most
personally satisfying cases of his long
career the defense of such Vietnam
critics as Bond, Dr. Benjamin Spock,
indicted for conspiracy to violate
Selective Service laws. Eqpah Ahmad

in the Harrisburg-Berrigan case that
charged the defendants with, among
other things, conspiracy to kidnap
Henry Kissinger, and Daniel Ellsberg
in the Pentagon Papers trial.
The Ellsberg case, probably the
most familiar of Boudin's cases in
popular memory, was thrown out of
court as the result of "improper gov
ernment conduct" that included bur
glaries and illegal wiretaps carried out
by the "plumbers" of Watergate
notoriety.
According to Boudin, "Watergate
helped us in the Ellsberg case, and we
helped the fall of President Nixon on
the Watergate issue."
A May 28, 1973, editorial in the
Nation, a weekly news magazine,
lauded Boudin for his role in the case.
"Mr. Boudin, like his uncle, the late
Louis Boudin, is a lawyer's
lawyer. . . . [His] performance at the
Ellsberg trial may well mark the high
point in a brilliant career at the bar."
But a White House memorandum
written by E. Howard Hunt, who, in

addition to his role in Watergate, was
a key CIA orchcstrator of the 1961
Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, des
cribed Boudin in less glowing terms.
His memorandum calls Boudin
"both famous and notorious for his
career-long defense of the Commu
nist Party, Castro Cuba, assorted
spies, perjurers, fellow travelers, con
spirators, agitators and violent revo
lutionaries."
The document continues: "To the
dismay of his admirers, Ellsberg, by
retaining Boudin to defend him . . .
becomes just one more client of a
man and a law firm whose dedication
over the years to the interests of our
foreign and domestic enemies has
remained unwavering and absolute."
Stanford Law Prof. Barbara Bab
cock paints a much less sinister
picture of Boudin, whom she calls
one of her "heroes."
"He has always been there
whenever there has been some kind
of unpopular cause or persecution
going on," she says."He takes a
lawyer's stance in that he represents
people who have cases that should be

made for them."
Babcock asserts that Boudin has
refused to fall prey to the fear of
many lawyers that "they'll be identi
fied with their clients, and they'll be
considered pariah themselves" for
representing political undesirables.
He "has just laid that aside and taken
on all kinds of clients," she says.
Boudin acknowledges that the
clients he has represented over the
years have colored his reputation,
particularly in the eyes of the U.S.
government. "The government will
identify, depending upon which ad
ministration is in office, anybody
representing people on the left or
governments such as Cuba and An
gola, which I've represented, with the
politics of the client. So, if it regards
the client as the enemy, it essentially
regards the lawyer as the enemy. This
was true during a long part of my life
as a lawyer," Boudin says.
While the extent of his commit
ment to protecting the constitutional
rights of political heretics has earned

him laurels from left activists and
large segments of the legal commu
nity, government officials in both
Democratic and Republican ad
ministrations have considered Boudin
a threat and alleged that he had com
munist affiliations.
"I am aware of the fact that many
people on the left and many people in
the government professed to have
thought that I was a member of the
Communist Party, or a communist,"
Boudin says.
"They were all wrong. And they
were wrong not because of any fear
on my part, because I had a very high
view of many people on the left,
whether they were communists or
not communists," Boudin says.
Rather, he explains, joining any poli
tical party did not fit with his view of
himself as "basically a professional
lawyer."
But despite such disclaimers,
Boudin was an easy target for govern
ment red-baiters. Nephew of the
famed attorney and socialist
theoretician, Louis Boudin, who hob
nobbed with Lenin, Trotsky and Rosa
Luxemburg, the younger Boudin
worked in his uncle's law office from
1936 to 1943.
In addition, as the first counsel for
the Emergency Civil Liberties Com
mittee (ECLC), he argued numerous
cases involving questions of Commu
nist Party affiliation, such as the
" right-to-travel" cases and the legal
battle for the right to receive mail
from a communist country. The
ECLC, a sort of alternative ACLU,
was formed in 1951 by journalist I.F.
Stone and others to defend people
whom the American Civil Liberties
Union considered too far to the left.
According to Boudin, the ACLU
"has been tremendously improved"
since the '40s and '50s, when Cold
War hysteria led it to "default in its
duty to protect the Bill of Rights."
Boudin's membership in the Na
tional Lawyer's Guild also provided
fodder for government attacks on
him. Although the Attorney General
was unsuccessful in attempts to regis
ter the guild as a subversive organi
zation, the guild's involvement in
litigation for members of the Com
munist Party and others on the left in
curred the wrath of some high
ranking government officials.
Boudin's affiliation with the guild, as
chair of its labor law and constitu
tional rights committees, resulted in
yet another black mark against him.
In 1956, Boudin was subpoenaed
to testify before the Hpusp Un-
American Activities Committee
(HUAC). When he stated under oath
that he was not and had never been a
member of the Communist Party, his
denial was met with disbelief.

He recalls: "The committee was
pretty shockcd because they expected
me to take the Fifth Amendment. . ..
They then announced to the press
they were sending the matter to the
Department of Justice for a possible
perjury prosecution. And that was a
period when many people were very
worried."
Although colleagues advised him
not to answer on the grounds that he
might be framed, as had so many
others, Boudin insisted on clearing
his name. "I felt that in terms of my
own practice and the better protec
tion not only of myself but of my
clients, the best thing would be to
clear the matter up publicly," he ex
plains.
Soon after the hearing, the State
Department granted Boudin the
passport for which he had earlier
sued, making him the only lawyer of
his ilk with the right to travel abroad.
He jokes about his failure to capi
talize on the situation.
"If I had been a good businessman
... I would have traveled all around
the world and been retained by all the
governments and clients who my col
leagues couldn't get to," says Boudin,
smiling. "But 1 wasn't very realistic

then, nor am I now, so I lost these
hundreds of clients."
The representation of foreign gov
ernments in their disputes with the
United States has thus far been only a
sideline for Boudin, whose firm has
represented such clients as the gov
ernments of Cuba, Angola, Chile
(under former President Allende),
British Guyana, Tanzania, Kenya
and, more recently, Greece. Until
now, most of the work on these cases
has been delegated to other partners
in the firm. But lately, at age 72,
Boudin sees his interests shifting
toward greater involvement in the
field of international law.
"First, we are not faced today with
the kind of incessant inquisitional
operations of the government that we

something more interesting about
some of the problems that are raised

Boudin.

But I think they've all been essen
tially on the right side."
Boudin pauses for a moment and
laughs. "This does make me sound
political, doesn't it? But I still don't
think I am."

Referred to as "a sort of Clarence
Darrow of the appellate court" by
one writer, attorney Leonard B.
Boudin, defender of alleged commu
nists, anti-war protesters, labor uni
onists and other political dissidents,
claims he is not political. He sounds
sincere, if not himself entirely con
vinced.
"I've never regarded myself as a
political animal. Nobody believes that
because of the kinds of clients I've
had or the kinds of articles I've writ
ten, but the truth is that I've always
thought of myself basically as an
American liberal fighting for consti
tutional principles, believing firmly in
the Bill of Rights," says Boudin, a
guest professor this quarter at Stan
ford Law School.
Since his admission to the New
York bar in 1 Boudin has spent
nearly a half century "protecting the
rights of individuals against the gov
ernment" and, in particular, defend
ing "people in their assertion of their
First and Fifth Amendment rights

'It is the left that has been oppressed in this country
historically, not the right. I have always been concerned
about governmental abuse of power, so those are the
people whom I was interested in protecting.'
— Leonard B. Boudin

before congressional committees and
grand juries," he says.
Boudin once boasted to The New
York Times that he and his law
partner, Victor Rabinowitz, had
defended more people before Sen.
Joseph McCarthy's investigations
subcommittee and the House Un-
American Activities Committee than
any other law firm. Seeing his role
primarily as one of protection,
Boudin says,"I feel that my work
has, to a tremendous extent, been a
defensive operation rather than one
that really advances the course of his
tory, the way I would have liked it to
do."
Despite this overall feeling, Boudin
acknowledges that some of his vic
tories have had a significant impact
on legal histoiy. He cites the 1958
Supreme Court case in which he se
cured the constitutional right to travel
regardless of political beliefs and as
sociations. Boudin calls the case,
brought on behalf of artist Rockwell
Kent against the State Department,

the "one clear-cut contribution to the
field of law which I'm willing to admit
is a contribution."
One of more than 20 arguments he
has made before the Supreme Court,
the case — Kent v. Dulles — ended
an unofficial decade-long ban on pass
ports to suspected communists and
their so-called fellow travelers.
Members of the 1960s New Left
following the lead of their Old Left
counterparts, turned to Boudin as
their First Amendment rights increas
ingly came under attack during both
the Johnson and Nixon administra
tions.
In 1966, when Julian Bond, then
state representative-elect, was barred
from taking his seat in the Georgia
legislature because of his vocal oppo
sition to the Vietnam War, Boudin
took Bond's case before the Supreme
Court, and won.
Boudin numbers among the most
personally satisfying cases of his long
career the defense of such Vietnam
critics as Bond, Dr. Benjamin Spock,
indicted for conspiracy to violate
Selective Service laws. Eqpah Ahmad

in the Harrisburg-Berrigan case that
charged the defendants with, among
other things, conspiracy to kidnap
Henry Kissinger, and Daniel Ellsberg
in the Pentagon Papers trial.
The Ellsberg case, probably the
most familiar of Boudin's cases in
popular memory, was thrown out of
court as the result of "improper gov
ernment conduct" that included bur
glaries and illegal wiretaps carried out
by the "plumbers" of Watergate
notoriety.
According to Boudin, "Watergate
helped us in the Ellsberg case, and we
helped the fall of President Nixon on
the Watergate issue."
A May 28, 1973, editorial in the
Nation, a weekly news magazine,
lauded Boudin for his role in the case.
"Mr. Boudin, like his uncle, the late
Louis Boudin, is a lawyer's
lawyer. . . . [His] performance at the
Ellsberg trial may well mark the high
point in a brilliant career at the bar."
But a White House memorandum
written by E. Howard Hunt, who, in

addition to his role in Watergate, was
a key CIA orchcstrator of the 1961
Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, des
cribed Boudin in less glowing terms.
His memorandum calls Boudin
"both famous and notorious for his
career-long defense of the Commu
nist Party, Castro Cuba, assorted
spies, perjurers, fellow travelers, con
spirators, agitators and violent revo
lutionaries."
The document continues: "To the
dismay of his admirers, Ellsberg, by
retaining Boudin to defend him . . .
becomes just one more client of a
man and a law firm whose dedication
over the years to the interests of our
foreign and domestic enemies has
remained unwavering and absolute."
Stanford Law Prof. Barbara Bab
cock paints a much less sinister
picture of Boudin, whom she calls
one of her "heroes."
"He has always been there
whenever there has been some kind
of unpopular cause or persecution
going on," she says."He takes a
lawyer's stance in that he represents
people who have cases that should be

made for them."
Babcock asserts that Boudin has
refused to fall prey to the fear of
many lawyers that "they'll be identi
fied with their clients, and they'll be
considered pariah themselves" for
representing political undesirables.
He "has just laid that aside and taken
on all kinds of clients," she says.
Boudin acknowledges that the
clients he has represented over the
years have colored his reputation,
particularly in the eyes of the U.S.
government. "The government will
identify, depending upon which ad
ministration is in office, anybody
representing people on the left or
governments such as Cuba and An
gola, which I've represented, with the
politics of the client. So, if it regards
the client as the enemy, it essentially
regards the lawyer as the enemy. This
was true during a long part of my life
as a lawyer," Boudin says.
While the extent of his commit
ment to protecting the constitutional
rights of political heretics has earned

him laurels from left activists and
large segments of the legal commu
nity, government officials in both
Democratic and Republican ad
ministrations have considered Boudin
a threat and alleged that he had com
munist affiliations.
"I am aware of the fact that many
people on the left and many people in
the government professed to have
thought that I was a member of the
Communist Party, or a communist,"
Boudin says.
"They were all wrong. And they
were wrong not because of any fear
on my part, because I had a very high
view of many people on the left,
whether they were communists or
not communists," Boudin says.
Rather, he explains, joining any poli
tical party did not fit with his view of
himself as "basically a professional
lawyer."
But despite such disclaimers,
Boudin was an easy target for govern
ment red-baiters. Nephew of the
famed attorney and socialist
theoretician, Louis Boudin, who hob
nobbed with Lenin, Trotsky and Rosa
Luxemburg, the younger Boudin
worked in his uncle's law office from
1936 to 1943.
In addition, as the first counsel for
the Emergency Civil Liberties Com
mittee (ECLC), he argued numerous
cases involving questions of Commu
nist Party affiliation, such as the
" right-to-travel" cases and the legal
battle for the right to receive mail
from a communist country. The
ECLC, a sort of alternative ACLU,
was formed in 1951 by journalist I.F.
Stone and others to defend people
whom the American Civil Liberties
Union considered too far to the left.
According to Boudin, the ACLU
"has been tremendously improved"
since the '40s and '50s, when Cold
War hysteria led it to "default in its
duty to protect the Bill of Rights."
Boudin's membership in the Na
tional Lawyer's Guild also provided
fodder for government attacks on
him. Although the Attorney General
was unsuccessful in attempts to regis
ter the guild as a subversive organi
zation, the guild's involvement in
litigation for members of the Com
munist Party and others on the left in
curred the wrath of some high
ranking government officials.
Boudin's affiliation with the guild, as
chair of its labor law and constitu
tional rights committees, resulted in
yet another black mark against him.
In 1956, Boudin was subpoenaed
to testify before the Hpusp Un-
American Activities Committee
(HUAC). When he stated under oath
that he was not and had never been a
member of the Communist Party, his
denial was met with disbelief.

He recalls: "The committee was
pretty shockcd because they expected
me to take the Fifth Amendment. . ..
They then announced to the press
they were sending the matter to the
Department of Justice for a possible
perjury prosecution. And that was a
period when many people were very
worried."
Although colleagues advised him
not to answer on the grounds that he
might be framed, as had so many
others, Boudin insisted on clearing
his name. "I felt that in terms of my
own practice and the better protec
tion not only of myself but of my
clients, the best thing would be to
clear the matter up publicly," he ex
plains.
Soon after the hearing, the State
Department granted Boudin the
passport for which he had earlier
sued, making him the only lawyer of
his ilk with the right to travel abroad.
He jokes about his failure to capi
talize on the situation.
"If I had been a good businessman
... I would have traveled all around
the world and been retained by all the
governments and clients who my col
leagues couldn't get to," says Boudin,
smiling. "But 1 wasn't very realistic

then, nor am I now, so I lost these
hundreds of clients."
The representation of foreign gov
ernments in their disputes with the
United States has thus far been only a
sideline for Boudin, whose firm has
represented such clients as the gov
ernments of Cuba, Angola, Chile
(under former President Allende),
British Guyana, Tanzania, Kenya
and, more recently, Greece. Until
now, most of the work on these cases
has been delegated to other partners
in the firm. But lately, at age 72,
Boudin sees his interests shifting
toward greater involvement in the
field of international law.
"First, we are not faced today with
the kind of incessant inquisitional
operations of the government that we
had. Second, intellectually, there's
something more interesting about
some of the problems that are raised
in the international field," explains
Boudin.

'The family doctor'
Although Boudin came from a
family teeming with lawyers, he says


David Kravetz/Daily
"I've always thought of myself basically as an American liberal fighting
for constitutional principles, believing firmly in the Bill of Rights," says
Leonard B. Boudin, a guest professor at the law school.
it was his uncle, Louis Boudin, who
had "the greatest influence" on his
life and the direction of his career.
"In a large sense, except that I have
not moved into his theoretical field of
socialism, I think my career has been
patterned after his," says Boudin. "I
learned labor law and constitutional
law and ways of legal thinking and
behavior toward other lawyers and
relationships with clients from Louie
Boudin."
"He had a equality that we younger,
if I can call myself younger, lawyers
don't have. He knew every aspect of
law. . . . And, of course, today, in
1985, we're all specialists. ... So,
that generation of the early 20th cen
tury was a better generation, it seems
to me. They were like the family doc
tor, and we are not family doctors
anymore," he says.
Boudin left his uncle's firm in 1943
with another junior partner, Victor
Rabinowitz, to open an office of their
own. Today, 42 years later,
Rabinowitz, Boudin, Standard,
Krinsky & Lieberman has grown to
include 16 lawyers, eight of them
partners. "I don't know of any other
small firm that's been around for that
long," says Boudin's partner,
Rabinowitz. "And there's been a lot
of change of personnel, but the two of
us are still here."
Elaborating on his praise of
Boudin, whom he calls "a brilliant
lawyer with a very active and legally
fruitful imagination," Rabinowitz
says,"He works out legal theories
and arguments in ways other lawyers
may not even consider, and he sees
things that most other lawyers don't
see." Rabinowitz laughs, "Some of
them aren't there, but enough of
them are there to make him a very
successful lawyer."
According to Rabinowitz, Boudin
excels at arguing "cases in which big
questions of policy are involved,
rather than little midgets of fact. We
rarely handle cases where the big
issue is whether the light was red or
green," he says.
He cites the Spock conspiracy trial
as an example. It raised "a big impor

tant freedom-of-speech question. It
was not a question of what leaflet
[Spock] handed out where, or even
what he was trying to say, but
whether it was legal to say it,"
Rabinowitz explains.
In journalist Peter Schrag's book
on the Pentagon Papers case, he
writes of the influence of Boudin's
view of the law on his legal style.
"There would be occasions when his
courtly absent-mindedness seemed to
verge on open disdain for the
mundane concerns of daily litiga
tion. ...
"His concern with the subtleties of
high-level legal debate, where he was
often brilliant, and his casual refer
ences to the Supreme Court cases in
which he had participated became in
themselves a kind of ideology, a view
of the law as an eminently civilized
and reasonable institution," Schrag
writes.
'The great citizens'
Boudin, a scholar as well as a
lawyer, says part of the joy of his
spring sabbatical from the practice of
law is the chance to work uninter
rupted by clients or the pressures of
litigation on research and writing law
review articles.
He also appreciates the
"congeniality of the faculty" and the
opportunities to discuss with them the
legal issues and philosophical ques
tions which so engage him. Having
taught at numerous law schools in
cluding Harvard, Yale and UC-
Berkeley, Boudin compares Stanford
Law School favorably to these other
institutions. Particularly pleased with
his colleagues, Boudin matter-of
factly states, "I happen to love law
school faculties, and this one happens
to be my favorite."
Such candid comments indicate
some measure of the charm Boudin is
said to exude in the courtroom. Aut
hors of a book on the Harrisburg-
Berrigan trial called Boudin "by far
the most entertaining attorney of the
trial." They described him
"frequently emphasiz(ing) points by
pleading poor hearing. Or if tes
timony was going particularly well for
the defense, he would amble about
the courtroom, in the jury's sight,
smiling puckishly, his thinning grey

hair askew, his spectacles pushed
atop his head."
Boudin admits that the drama of
the courtroom is one of the pleasures
of being a lawyer. He says he makes it
a point to hear oral arguments in the
Supreme Court several times a year:
"I like it both as drama and as a study
of the court,"he says.
Although he appears to be some
one consumed by his work, Boudin
does make time for tennis, jaunts on
his bicycle, chess and books. Having
grown up in what he calls "a literary
house," Boudin these days is reading

18th century British history, 19th
century novels and biographies of
lawyers and judges. He also admits to
reading suspense novels.
Born July 20, 1912, the son of
Austrian and Russian parents,
Boudin spent his childhood in Brook
lyn and his adolescent years in Rich
mond Hill, Queens. A life-long New
Yorker, he has lived in Greenwich
Village since his marriage in 1937 to
the poet Jean Roisman.
Boudin is a father of two who
lavishes on both his children words of

praise and deep respect. While Mi
chael, a former editor of the Harvard
Law Review, inherited his father's
passion for law and has become a
highly respected anti-trust lawyer in
Washington, Kathy, according to
Boudin, inherited her father's passion
for social justice and is now serving a
prison term of 20 years to life for her
involvement in activities of the
Weather Underground, a radical
splinter group of the Students for a
Democratic Society.
Living underground from March
1970 until her arrest, a fugitive on the
FBl's 10 most wanted list, Kathy was
apprehended in October 1981 for her
part in the Nyack, N.Y., Brink's rob
bery which left two policemen and a
Brink's guard dead.
Of the direction of his daughter's
politics, Boudin says,"I think I un
derstand her general life movement,
which I regard — to the extent that a
parent could be objective — as com
pletely idealistic. I've always said that
I know of nobody who is concerned
for the welfare of humanity to the ex
tent that Kathy has been."
Her early involvement in the civil
rights movement and her work with
welfare mothers in Cleveland evolved
into a more militant anti
establishment politics in the late '60s
as Vietnam War protests grew in
creasingly violent.
In a discussion of his own views on
methods of effecting social change,
Boudin mentions Joan Baez' talk at
Stanford last month. "She went back
to her theme of Ghandi and peaceful
opposition, and I suppose that that
has been my general principle, be
cause I think that naked power is not
on the side of people. It's on the side
of government, and government uses
that power.
"At the same time," Boudin says,
"I can understand the feelings of
futility, of weakness and of outrage
that people had on campuses in the
1960s and 19705."
Such feelings may well have been
behind Kathy's turn toward more
radical political tactics. While her
support for armed revolution cannot
be denied, Kathy did not carry a gun
during the Nyack robbery, nor at any
other time, according to Boudin. He
points out that Kathy "was not
(personally) responsible for the death

of anybody or the assault on
anybody." He says it has never been
proved that she was even at the shop
ping mall where the robbery took
place. This contributes to his assess
ment of her sentence as "a dreadful
one and certainly disproportionate to
what she did."
He believes the punishment doled
out to his daughter — who is in
eligible for parole until 17 years from
the date of her sentencing — was
"really due to the fact that she was re
garded as being on the left. People
have suggested — and it may be true
— that my role over the last 40 or 50
years is a factor that hurt her, in the
sense that the government couldn't
touch me, but it could touch her."
This belief of Boudin's, that his
daughter's politics unfairly influenced
her treatment, not only in the courts
but in prison as well, is reiterated as
he explains the motivations for his
life's work.
Frequently asked why he so often
represents those on the left, Boudin
says it is, in part, because these
people have come to him. But more
fundamentally, he says,"It is the left
that has been oppressed in this
country historically, not the right. I
have always been concerned about
governmental abuse of power, so
those are the people whom I was in
terested in protecting."
Boudin has no regrets about the
kinds of clients he has taken over the
years. "I regard people whom I've
represented as being all people of
good works who have really devoted
themselves to the working class and
to the welfare of the people of the
country," he explains.
"I regard all of them as the great
citizens of the country. That's why
I've had such pleasure in representing
them. I've never seen any of them do
anything or say anything harmful to
the country," confesses Boudin.
"So, I've represented varied groups
— liberal, left, a few conservatives,
but not many, 1 must admit — and
many of them have disagreed with
one another, sometimes violently.
But I think they've all been essen
tially on the right side."
Boudin pauses for a moment and
laughs. "This does make me sound
political, doesn't it? But I still don't
think I am."
