## Basic rights concern lawyer 
### BARBARA SCHULER Senior staff writer 
Referred to as "a sort of Clarence
Darrow of the appellate court" by
one writer, attorney Leonard B.
Boudin, defender of alleged commu
nists, anti-war protesters, labor uni
onists and other political dissidents,
claims he is not political. He sounds
sincere, if not himself entirely con
vinced.
"I've never regarded myself as a
political animal. Nobody believes that
because of the kinds of clients I've
had or the kinds of articles I've writ
ten, but the truth is that I've always
thought of myself basically as an
American liberal fighting for consti
tutional principles, believing firmly in
the Bill of Rights," says Boudin, a
guest professor this quarter at Stan
ford Law School.
Since his admission to the New
York bar in 1 Boudin has spent
nearly a half century "protecting the
rights of individuals against the gov
ernment" and, in particular, defend
ing "people in their assertion of their
First and Fifth Amendment rights

'It is the left that has been oppressed in this country
historically, not the right. I have always been concerned
about governmental abuse of power, so those are the
people whom I was interested in protecting.'

before congressional committees and
grand juries," he says.
Boudin once boasted to The New
York Times that he and his law
partner, Victor Rabinowitz, had
defended more people before Sen.
Joseph McCarthy's investigations
subcommittee and the House Un-
American Activities Committee than
any other law firm. Seeing his role
primarily as one of protection,
Boudin says,"I feel that my work
has, to a tremendous extent, been a
defensive operation rather than one
that really advances the course of his
tory, the way I would have liked it to
do."
Despite this overall feeling, Boudin
acknowledges that some of his vic
tories have had a significant impact
on legal histoiy. He cites the 1958
Supreme Court case in which he se
cured the constitutional right to travel
regardless of political beliefs and as
sociations. Boudin calls the case,
brought on behalf of artist Rockwell
Kent against the State Department,

the "one clear-cut contribution to the
field of law which I'm willing to admit
is a contribution."
One of more than 20 arguments he
has made before the Supreme Court,
the case — Kent v. Dulles — ended
an unofficial decade-long ban on pass
ports to suspected communists and
their so-called fellow travelers.
Members of the 1960s New Left
following the lead of their Old Left
counterparts, turned to Boudin as
their First Amendment rights increas
ingly came under attack during both
the Johnson and Nixon administra
tions.
In 1966, when Julian Bond, then
state representative-elect, was barred
from taking his seat in the Georgia
legislature because of his vocal oppo
sition to the Vietnam War, Boudin
took Bond's case before the Supreme
Court, and won.
Boudin numbers among the most
personally satisfying cases of his long
career the defense of such Vietnam
critics as Bond, Dr. Benjamin Spock,
indicted for conspiracy to violate
Selective Service laws. Eqpah Ahmad

in the Harrisburg-Berrigan case that
charged the defendants with, among
other things, conspiracy to kidnap
Henry Kissinger, and Daniel Ellsberg
in the Pentagon Papers trial.
The Ellsberg case, probably the
most familiar of Boudin's cases in
popular memory, was thrown out of
court as the result of "improper gov
ernment conduct" that included bur
glaries and illegal wiretaps carried out
by the "plumbers" of Watergate
notoriety.
According to Boudin, "Watergate
helped us in the Ellsberg case, and we
helped the fall of President Nixon on
the Watergate issue."
A May 28, 1973, editorial in the
Nation, a weekly news magazine,
lauded Boudin for his role in the case.
"Mr. Boudin, like his uncle, the late
Louis Boudin, is a lawyer's
lawyer. . . . [His] performance at the
Ellsberg trial may well mark the high
point in a brilliant career at the bar."
But a White House memorandum
written by E. Howard Hunt, who, in

addition to his role in Watergate, was
a key CIA orchcstrator of the 1961
Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, des
cribed Boudin in less glowing terms.
His memorandum calls Boudin
"both famous and notorious for his
career-long defense of the Commu
nist Party, Castro Cuba, assorted
spies, perjurers, fellow travelers, con
spirators, agitators and violent revo
lutionaries."
The document continues: "To the
dismay of his admirers, Ellsberg, by
retaining Boudin to defend him . . .
becomes just one more client of a
man and a law firm whose dedication
over the years to the interests of our
foreign and domestic enemies has
remained unwavering and absolute."
Stanford Law Prof. Barbara Bab
cock paints a much less sinister
picture of Boudin, whom she calls
one of her "heroes."
"He has always been there
whenever there has been some kind
of unpopular cause or persecution
going on," she says."He takes a
lawyer's stance in that he represents
people who have cases that should be

made for them."
Babcock asserts that Boudin has
refused to fall prey to the fear of
many lawyers that "they'll be identi
fied with their clients, and they'll be
considered pariah themselves" for
representing political undesirables.
He "has just laid that aside and taken
on all kinds of clients," she says.
Boudin acknowledges that the
clients he has represented over the
years have colored his reputation,
particularly in the eyes of the U.S.
government. "The government will
identify, depending upon which ad
ministration is in office, anybody
representing people on the left or
governments such as Cuba and An
gola, which I've represented, with the
politics of the client. So, if it regards
the client as the enemy, it essentially
regards the lawyer as the enemy. This
was true during a long part of my life
as a lawyer," Boudin says.
While the extent of his commit
ment to protecting the constitutional
rights of political heretics has earned

him laurels from left activists and
large segments of the legal commu
nity, government officials in both
Democratic and Republican ad
ministrations have considered Boudin
a threat and alleged that he had com
munist affiliations.
"I am aware of the fact that many
people on the left and many people in
the government professed to have
thought that I was a member of the
Communist Party, or a communist,"
Boudin says.
"They were all wrong. And they
were wrong not because of any fear
on my part, because I had a very high
view of many people on the left,
whether they were communists or
not communists," Boudin says.
Rather, he explains, joining any poli
tical party did not fit with his view of
himself as "basically a professional
lawyer."
But despite such disclaimers,
Boudin was an easy target for govern
ment red-baiters. Nephew of the
famed attorney and socialist
theoretician, Louis Boudin, who hob
nobbed with Lenin, Trotsky and Rosa
Luxemburg, the younger Boudin
worked in his uncle's law office from
1936 to 1943.
In addition, as the first counsel for
the Emergency Civil Liberties Com
mittee (ECLC), he argued numerous
cases involving questions of Commu
nist Party affiliation, such as the
" right-to-travel" cases and the legal
battle for the right to receive mail
from a communist country. The
ECLC, a sort of alternative ACLU,
was formed in 1951 by journalist I.F.
Stone and others to defend people
whom the American Civil Liberties
Union considered too far to the left.
According to Boudin, the ACLU
"has been tremendously improved"
since the '40s and '50s, when Cold
War hysteria led it to "default in its
duty to protect the Bill of Rights."
Boudin's membership in the Na
tional Lawyer's Guild also provided
fodder for government attacks on
him. Although the Attorney General
was unsuccessful in attempts to regis
ter the guild as a subversive organi
zation, the guild's involvement in
litigation for members of the Com
munist Party and others on the left in
curred the wrath of some high
ranking government officials.
Boudin's affiliation with the guild, as
chair of its labor law and constitu
tional rights committees, resulted in
yet another black mark against him.
In 1956, Boudin was subpoenaed
to testify before the Hpusp Un-
American Activities Committee
(HUAC). When he stated under oath
that he was not and had never been a
member of the Communist Party, his
denial was met with disbelief.

He recalls: "The committee was
pretty shockcd because they expected
me to take the Fifth Amendment. . ..
They then announced to the press
they were sending the matter to the
Department of Justice for a possible
perjury prosecution. And that was a
period when many people were very
worried."
Although colleagues advised him
not to answer on the grounds that he
might be framed, as had so many
others, Boudin insisted on clearing
his name. "I felt that in terms of my
own practice and the better protec
tion not only of myself but of my
clients, the best thing would be to
clear the matter up publicly," he ex
plains.
Soon after the hearing, the State
Department granted Boudin the
passport for which he had earlier
sued, making him the only lawyer of
his ilk with the right to travel abroad.
He jokes about his failure to capi
talize on the situation.
"If I had been a good businessman
... I would have traveled all around
the world and been retained by all the
governments and clients who my col
leagues couldn't get to," says Boudin,
smiling. "But 1 wasn't very realistic

then, nor am I now, so I lost these
hundreds of clients."
The representation of foreign gov
ernments in their disputes with the
United States has thus far been only a
sideline for Boudin, whose firm has
represented such clients as the gov
ernments of Cuba, Angola, Chile
(under former President Allende),
British Guyana, Tanzania, Kenya
and, more recently, Greece. Until
now, most of the work on these cases
has been delegated to other partners
in the firm. But lately, at age 72,
Boudin sees his interests shifting
toward greater involvement in the
field of international law.
"First, we are not faced today with
the kind of incessant inquisitional
operations of the government that we
had. Second, intellectually, there's
something more interesting about
some of the problems that are raised
in the international field," explains
Boudin.
