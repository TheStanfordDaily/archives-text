## The 						Stanford Daily Editor's farewell 
### 
"Cool heads will prevail."
When I first heard those words four years ago,
I didn't think much of them. They came from my
high school headmaster, who had just announced
that the newspaper I edited would not be allowed
to run a story he thought might damage the
school. Our faculty adviser, a graduate of Stan
ford and The Daily, immediately announced her
resignation. And there was the headmaster, tell
ing me that cool heads would prevail.
He couldn't be right, but he was. After a few
long discussions, we came to a compromise on
the story. The faculty adviser agreed to take back
her job that afternoon, and the headmaster, who
has since left the school, is now one of my best
friends and mentors.
"Cool heads will prevail."
I was thinking about those words again when I
became The Daily's editor in February. I talked
to a close friend, the daughter of that
headmaster. She told me that her father had
changed since leaving my high school, that he
realized now that some things are important and
some things aren't. A few days earlier, he had
walked into her sister's bedroom and had seen
the usual mess that had always made him so
angry before. This time, he had walked out,
smiling. "It just doesn't matte r ," he said.
"Cool heads will prevail."
Those words have become something of an in
spiration for me. The headmaster has gone
through a lot since he first said them to me, but
he has prevailed. The Daily and I have gone
through a lot, too, and I'd like to think that we've
prevailed.
That doesn't mean everything has gone per
fectly, for the headmaster or for me. It doesn't
mean that I haven't been angry about mistakes.
That I haven't blown up too often about missed
deadlines. That I haven't wanted to quit or
wished someone else were in charge.

But each time I've grown angry, I've known
inside — sometimes too deep inside — that
everything would eventually work out. Yes, we
made mistakes. But we tried our damnedest to
prevent them, we did our best to correct them,
and I know we learned something from them.
Best of all, we always had the knowledge that
there was a tomorrow. Tomorrow we'll do better.
Tomorrow we'll correct'any damage done today.
Tomorrow we'll put out the perfect paper. Al
ways tomorrow.
That's the frustrating thing about saying
goodbye to the editorship. Tonight's issue is the
last one for me; I won't have another Daily to
morrow.
But I will have memories. Memories of the
papers we put out, of the late nights in the back
shop and the early mornings at Denny's. Most of
all, I'll have memories of the people with whom
I've had the privilege to work. The people who
have put everything else on hold and thrown
themselves into what we do here. The people
who have realized, even when the going was at its
toughest, that we could prevail.
And now, as I finish this last paragraph, it's all
beginning to sink in a little more. This is my last
opportunity to say what I really mean; I won't get
another chance tomorrow to make today's
farewell any better. My only hope is that I will be
able to look at this tomorrow and say I did the
best I could at the time. If we can all look back at
this volume and feel that way, then I think we've
done pretty well.
