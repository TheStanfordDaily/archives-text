## Civil disobedience merits support 
### 
This letter is to express solidarity
and support for the nine Stanford stu
dents who were arrested May 28
during acts of civil disobedience to
protest Stanford's investments in
South Africa-involved firms.

VIEWPOINT

Few people outside South Africa
express sympathy or understanding
for the system of apartheid, the sys
tematic oppression and exploitation
for the black majority there; one has
to remember, however, that the inter
national sponsors of the South
African regime — i.e., the United
Kingdom in the first half of the cen
tury and the U.S. and European
states in the second half — have al
ways verbally condemned apartheid,
but have never done anything to end
it. Indeed, they have profited from
the favorable investment opportuni
ties and cheap labor, guaranteed by

repression of political and civil rights
of the black people. While verbally
condemning the South African gov
ernment, Western powers have even
allowed it to reach nuclear capability,
in spite of the agreement of non
proliferation of nuclfear weapons that
South Africa, of course, did not sign.
Therefore, outright hypocrisy is to be
expected from the political and eco
nomic establishment of Western
countries on the subject of apartheid.
We believe that only one choice is
morally and politically acceptable and
not to be procrastinated, namely the
political and economic boycott of the
present regime in South Africa and
full support to the black opposition
there, to their struggle and to the
means of struggle that they choose
(provided, of course, that those
means are rational and effective to
the aim of terminating the condition
of enslavement of the black people).
it is sometimes argued that those

who support divestment encourage a
civil war between black and white. In
reply, we need only point out that a
civil war is already going on. But
more interesting, perhaps, is the fact
that it is the strength of the South
African government, its self
confidence and its trust in the support
of Western countries that make it
impossible to reach a peaceful change
today.
We think that Stanford should fully
divest now from all companies that do
business in South Africa, because this
is a decision that is encouraged by the
black opposition in South Africa and
because we think that the moral and
political significance of such an act
largely outweigh its material eco
nomic relevance.
If the political leadership of this
university has a better strategy to
support the black movement of
liberation in South Africa, the burden

of proof is up to them. Simple
procrastination or committees to
elaborate further policies will not do
the job, however. University Presi
dent Kennedy has to understand that
it is the University, not the students,
that has to prove its credibility.
We invite all students to consider
that discussions of strategies for
divestment. We cannot let this move
ment die, if we care for decency.
We want to express our full support
and high esteem to the nine students
arrested, and we ask the University to
drop all charges against them imme
diately.
