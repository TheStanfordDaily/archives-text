# Reagan has undercut his interests
## 
### 
Reagan is busily closing off the options of
capitalism.
This is a reflection of his limited mental capacity
and his Hollywood upbringing; he fails to under
stand the delicate balances that maintain America's
place in the world and the place of Reagan's class in
America. He always reaches for a sledgehammer
solution to the problems that confront him, not re
alizing that in the long run he is undermining his
own class interests.
A good example of this is his policy in Latin
America. Sure, the United States has the physical
power to impose its will on any one of the countries
south of our border. But our continued domination
of the whole region depends on the active coopera
tion of their own ruling classes, and they are very
sensitive to the idea that Washington thinks it has
them on too short a leash.
By thrashing around like a latter-day Teddy
Roosevelt — with the Contras, Grenada, and open
support for Britain in the Falklands/Malvinas War
— Reagan has begun to create what Marxists have
long thought was impossible in Latin America —
an anti-imperialistic bourgeoisie.
While Reagan and the lapdog press have been
worried about Cuban influence in the jungles of El
Salvador, they have missed the growing influence
Castro has had all over Latin America. It's no acci
dent that at the inaugurations of the Brazilian and
Uruguayan presidents, President Ortega of
Nicaragua was greeted as a hero and George Bush
was booed. Reagan's cowboy diplomacy has fueled
anti-Americanism to the point where indigenous
socialists can no longer be excluded from the spec
trum of legitimacy.
In the economy, too, Reagan is sawing off the
limb he sits on. Giant military spending increases
went unpaid for because of the tax cuts. This got
the economy going again, in much the same way
that you could probably get a dying man back on
his feet with amphetamines. However, in neither
case do you cure the real problems, and in both
processes you create a junkie. When Reagan talks
about balancing the budget, he's joking: Taking
away the military-industrial fix would cripple the
country at this point.
Now, when the economy is beginning to show
signs of faltering. Reagan has unveiled his new "tax
simplification" plan. The plan lowers tax rates,
mainly for the upper brackets, and promises to be
"revenue neutral" because it closes some
loopholes.
Closing some loopholes is like becoming a little
bit pregnant. Reagan and his gnomes in the Trea

sury know full well that the people who took ad
vantage of the closed tax shelters are now going to
take advantage of the remaining ones, so that their
effective tax rate will plummet. Even more
blatantly than the first one, this is a tax cut for the
rich.
Which is logical, in some sense of the word. After
all, Reagan must be thinking, if it worked before,
why won't it work again? Unfortunately, there are
structural limits to the amount of games one can

tifications at intellectual
brothels like Hoover.

play with the economy. If this tax plan goes
through, we'll be seeing $300 or $400 billion dollar
deficits, and a third of our tax dollars will be going
to interest.
By treating the economy like the ultimate cam
paign commercial, Reagan has exacerbated the
existing crisis. His successor will have a difficult
time finding a way out of it.
But perhaps the most important way Reagan has
narrowed the range of possibilities for capitalism is
in the intellectual sphere. Basically. Reagan doesn't
care if academics believe the rationalizations of his
actions. You won't find a lot of Reaganites in the
Political Science Department at Stanford. Some
claim this as evidence of bias, but I think it indi
cates that to some extent the University is acting
the way it is supposed to: In the "free market" of
ideas, those that are not credible are eventually
junked.
Further symptoms of Reaganism's abandonment

of rational discourse are the fact that Reagan got
only 28 percent of the vote on this campus, the dra
matic shift to the left that can be demonstrated
during the freshman year of a Stanford class, and
the low level of thought that passes for conservative
opinion on this page.
But Reagan thinks he doesn't need the Univer
sity. To the extent that his policies require intellec
tual justifications, he can hire them at intellectual
brothels like Hoover. Reagan sees his politics as
being more dependent on public relations than on
professors.
In the short term, he's probably right. But in the
medium run, the independent university is one of
the most powerful institutions for the legitimation
of our economic system. Elite schools like Stanford
are supposed to produce the next ruling class. If its
graduates come out cynical, let alone openly radi
cal, then capitalism is in trouble.
And in the long run, I think that a class that gives
up trying to justify itself to its intellectual elite will
eventually give up trying to justify itself to a
majority of the citizenry. As rational discourse
goes, so goes democracy.
Reagan's elimination of options parallels the loss
of options in the political system as a whole. The
Democrats since John Kennedy have been
demonstrating their failure to come up with a pro
gram that is practically workable, politically viable,
and which at the same time respects the corporate
interests that are the dominant power in our social
system.
This leaves Reagan as the only alternative, a man
who blunders through the complex of problems in
herent in capitalism, trying to maintain our position
in the world through brute dominance, trying to
preserve the economy through short-run
demogoguery, and abandoning the field of intellec
tual legitimation altogether.
Chances are Reagan will be in his grave before it
all comes crashing down. But the contradictions he
amplified will remain. In Germany between the
wars, a period that I think has many striking paral
lels to our own, Rosa Luxemburg said that
humanity faced a choice between socialism and
barbarism. I think we still face the same choice.
Some kind of democratic socialism is necessary to
eliminate the irrationalities of a system of produc
tion whose sole point is the maximization of profit
for a tiny minority. The other option is the aut
horitarianism which is Reaganism's logical conclu
sion.
