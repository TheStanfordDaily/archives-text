AIDS fear?
I am amazed that people
(including The Daily Editorial
Board) attribute the decrease in
blood donations to the potential
donors' fears of catching AIDS. I
don't think that is the reason at all.
The two major factors are:
• People are "saving" their blood in
case they or a friend or relative need
it.
• Gay men are not donating. When a
person gives blood, there is now
rigorous questioning related to AIDS
exposure, such as "Do you know
anyone who has AIDS?" Since most
gay men do know AIDS victims, and
since many gay men have indeed
been exposed to AIDS, they dis
qualify themselves from donating.
A few people probably are con
cerned that they might be con
taminated by clumsy or inept tech
nicians who get needles mixed up or
who don't wash their hands between
blood donors, but I think that this
accounts for very little of the blood
donation decline.

As regular diners in Stanford
residences, we have an interest
(academic as well as gastronomic) in
the quality of the meals that are
served. We were heartened when the
University Food Service conducted a
survey, the results of which were
published at the beginning of May,
and referred to in The Daily (May
15).
We are writing to point out that

care must be taken in interpreting
the results of this survey. In the first
place, figures are reported only in
the categories most favorable to food
service; a cardinal rule of con
structive reporting is that the focus
be on those categories where im
provement or change is required. For
example, under the category "Menu
and Food — Flavoring/Seasoning," it
was reported that 24 percent
responded "excellent or good,"
whereas it would have been more to
the point to have reported that 76
percent rated it as "fair or poor" or
did not respond.
Second, on a four-point scale,
"fair" is an unfavorable rating, and
"poor" is very unfavorable. Against
this background, the fact that 35 to
39 percent of the respondents rated
"Food Quality," "Temperature" and
"Appearance" as "excellent or
good" is not at all impressive.
Third, the survey was conducted,
collected and processed by the
people involved in the program that
was under critical examination. In
such circumstances, it is always bet
ter — there is a greater guarantee of
valid results — if the evaluation is
conducted by a neutral party.
We hope the fact that food ser
vice presented only the favorable
results of the survey does not mean
that it has ignored the overwhelming
mandate for improvement the survey
data provide, and which they tried to
obscure.
