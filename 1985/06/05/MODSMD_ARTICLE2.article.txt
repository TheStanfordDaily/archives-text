# New COP pushes for big change
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
If all goes according to the plans of the incom
ing Council of Presidents, the ASSU will be oper
ating under a new constitution by the 1986-87
school year.
1 he COP yesterday began a drive to collect the
approximately 650 signatures — 5 percent of the
student body — needed by the end of the quarter
to place the constitution on a ballot within the
first 25 days of fall quarter, according to COP
member Mike Collins.
New COP members Leslie Leland, Tim Ouirk,
Andy Frisch and Collins, with the help of several
current ASSU senators, have drafted a constitu
tion which they hope to place on a ballot early
this fall for student approval. To receive adoption
by the student government, the constitution must
be passed by two-thirds of the voting student
body, Collins said.
According to Collins, the proposed constitu
tion would make "the student government a ser
vice organization, with the primary purpose of
serving students and student organizations. The
student government should follow a black-box
principle: Students go to them for assistance and
receive it. Period."
The constitution, created shortly after the
Hammer rrncf orrm
competitor by a two-to-one margin in this

spring's ASSU election, divides the senate into
two distinct bodies— the House of Laws and the
House of Funds.
The houses would meet separately on alternat
ing weeks, Collins said, and would each comprise
seven senators and a senate chair who would be
selected in a manner similar to the current sys
tem. Students would vote for two senate candi
dates, instead of the eight allowed under the cur
rent system, he added.
"One house will be composed of four under
graduates and three graduate students, the other
of three undergraduates and four graduate stu
dents," the constitution states. "All members of
the House of Funds are ex-officio members of
—the House of Luwj, and all uietabcis oi the
House of Laws are ex-officio members of the

House of Funds."
The House of Funds, Ouirk said, includes the
duties now handled by the budget and finance
committee and the appropriations committee,
while the House of Laws would handle ASSU ad
ministration and rules.
Senators would decide which house they sit in
during the first meeting of the senate-elect,
Ouirk said.
Collins said the two houses would meet to
gether "very rarely," usually on issues such as
divestmefit affecting the entire student body.
Some aspects of the current student govern
ment would not change under the new constitu-

tion, Collins said, noting that the
judicial branch and the "vast
majority" of the financial office
would not be greatly affected by the
constitution.
The powers of the COP under the
new constitution include "the right to
veto any bill or resolution passed by
either house" within 72 hours after
the adjournment of the meeting. In
addition, the COP has the power "to
submit legislation directly to the floor

of either house."
Quirk said he believes the new con
stitution would reduce the amount of
time spent bickering over budgets of
student organizations.
Collins dismissed the charges by
some that reducing the number of
senators actually hurts student repre
sentation, stating that the new consti
tution provides "more accountability
and more representation."
"They won't have a whole playpen
of alternates sitting around. 1 don't
beleive the current senate is anything
anyone would write home about,"
Collins said.

"A smaller body, without needless
back-ups, becomes — ironically — a
far better representative organization
than 40 folks constantly fighting for
'first chair, 1 " he said.
One of the more humorous
changes in the proposed constitution
is the new nickname for the ASSU —
"Fred." Quirk noted that students
would thus have to write that "they
served Fred" on resumes and job ap
plications.
Copies of the constitution are
available for inspection at the ASSU
offices in Tresidder Union, Quirk
said.
