## The
						perils of' Star Wars' research 
### 
With all the recent activity on campus about
apartheid, we have lost sight of another vital inter
national issue, the Strategic Defense Initiative
(SDI), commonly known as "Star Wars." If
deployed, a Star Wars defense system would un
dermine the fragile balance of nuclear deterrence
and move the world a giant step closer to annihila
tion. Stanford should not participate in its develop
ment.

VIEWPOINT

SDI envisages an extensive computer-controlled
multi-layered defense in space. The system would
have to detect missile launches, distinguish real
warheads trom decoys, then aim and fire accurately
from thousands of miles away. Thousands of tar
gets would be involved simultaneously, launched
by a toe determined to confound and overwhelm
the defense.
The specifics of the SDI technologies, their
virtues and vulnerabilities, are described else
where. We should not let our fascination with the
immense technical challenge of SDI sidetrack us
into a narrow discussion that you and I lack the ex
pertise to conclude. Suffice it to note that the con
sensus of qualified experts holds that SDI is not a
feasible way to protect the U.S. population.
Even among his advisers and supporters, Presi-

SDI would undermine deterrence by creating a
military advantage in initiating nuclear war.

dent Reagan is alone in claiming that SDI will
make nuclear weapons "impotent and obsolete."
Using Hitler's "Big Lie" technique, Reagan has
confidently and repeatedly fostered this deception,
largely convincing a public that understandably
yearns for an alternative to the nuclear terrorist
state.
But scientists and knowledgeable politicians
alike agree that SDI could be at most 95 percent ef
fective against ballistic missiles (and not at all
against cruise missiles). That is not enough. Five
percent of the 7,000 warheads that the Soviet

Union could launch against us is 350 nuclear war
heads, each equivalent to more than 10 Hiroshima
sized bombs. A system that leaves more than 100
million people dead is not a defense.
Privately and to Congress, administration offi
cials concede that the real goal is a defense for
missiles and command-and-control centers. A
high-tech version of the ABM system of the late
19605, SDI should be rejected for the same reasons
that ABM was. First, it would cause an accelerated
buildup of offensive missiles as each country tried
to overwhelm the other's defense. The Soviet
Union and all previous American administrations
have come to the conclusion that this would be ex
pensive and counterproductive. Second, it would

lead to an arms race in defensive weaponry. The
fruitless militarization of the earth would be ex
tended into space. Reagan has flat out refused to
consider the Soviet proposals to prevent this. Third
and most important, SDI will destabilize deter
rence.

Since any defense is only partially effective, it is
better at defeating a partial attack than a full at
tack. A Soviet planner would have two choices
during a crisis. He could launch a full attack first to
inflict maximum damage. Or, he could wait and
possibly be attacked, lose many missiles and com
mand centers, and then be able to launch only a
partial retaliation, ineffective against the defense.
The presence of the defensive system thus provides
an incentive to strike first.
Knowing this, the United States would also be
tempted to strike preemptively. Now, both sides

are deterred from attacking by the assurance that
both will be destroyed no matter which launches
tirst. SDI would undermine deterrence by creating
a military advantage in initiating nuclear war. This
vital but rather involved argument is much harder
to sell to the public than Reagan's simplistic fantasy
(though it is typical for strategists). It is imperative
not to undermine deterrence, nevertheless.
Why should the Soviets fear an American attack
as in the above scenario? Because of Reagan's
stated intention that the United States be able to
"prevail" in a nuclear war, his nuclear "war
tighting" doctrine, and because of the counterforce
weapons he has championed. These weapons in
clude the Pershing 11, Trident 11, MX and cruise

missiles, all explicitly designed to destroy Soviet
command posts and unlaunched nuclear forces.
They are to give the United States "escalation
dominance" â€” the ability to escalate to higher
levels of nuclear conflict more easily than the
Soviets can. Unfortunately, even the lower levels of
this plan entail tens of millions of deaths, and the
full plan is a recipe for early and rapid escalation to
all-out nuclear war.
The cost of this ineffective and insane Star Wars
project is to be more than a trillion dollars. In this
time of growing human need, the perverted
priorities of the administration must be changed.
But we must look not only at Washington. The
money is to be taken from the taxpayers and dis
tributed to industrial and academic researchers,
who are often glad to have funding for
"interesting" and "challenging" projects like SDI.
Stanford is involved, and in the process of becom
ing more so. To me, this work is on a par with engi
neering better gas ovens for Auschwitz. The
apocalypse is being prepared right around us, here
and now. We must not allow this ghastly work to
prosper and grow in our community.
