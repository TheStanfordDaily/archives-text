## Fond memories of Stanford 
### 
In "The Big Chill," a movie so painfully associated with
Yuppiedom by pop critics that any expression of affection
for it is tantamount to self-flagellation, there is a scene
that touched a nerve in me — a graduating senior. In it,
one of the characters looks out at her college clique 10
years after they have each gone their separate ways and
says with great sincerity, "You know, I was at my best
with all of vou."

VIEWPOINT

Those words are jarring, even pathetic, only because we
are afraid they might prove true. Up until now, for most of
us, life has gotten better and better with each passing year.
High school was great, college was even greater, and
whatever lies beyond, well, the prevailing trend says that
will be great, too. And it may well be. But nevertheless,
will we look back a decade from now and say we were at
"our best" in college?
What makes those words so unsettling? What do I fear?
Is it that 1 wasn't happy with myself in college, and I hate
to think that this is as good as it gets? Is it that the fulfill
ment of this prophecy would preclude any future personal
growth? Or is it that I recognize how hard it is going to be
to prevent those words from becoming true? Well
intentioned uncles and back-slapping friends of the family
will tell you to enjoy those college years — after all, they
are the best of your life. This, however, is not the record I
want rc-plaved on the eve of my graduation. These are the
kind of words that have me scurrying to the nearest Stan
ley Kaplan center to sign up for LSAT preparation
courses to ensure three more years on the college green.
I had the fortune and misfortune of leaving Stanford a

few weeks prior to the standard June graduation date.
Fortune, because I am working at a job in a field I have
chosen; misfortune, because I was forced to close that
chapter of my life— the so-called "best" one — six weeks
before I had expected and long before I was ready.
The time I've spent away from Stanford has given me
the opportunity to ruminate on all the time I spent there.
Memories of nights at the library bleed into those at The
Goose; days in classes are indistinguishable from weekend
roadtrips. It's one big memory packaged and stamped
"Stanford." When I think back on the four years, my
mind races from one vignette to the next, unable to focus
on a single one but instead just touching scattered high
lights along the way.
I can't pretend there weren't any bad times, but the
human memory is so selective as effectively to rewrite his
tory. It's as if I pulled no all-nighters, never got mad at my
roommates, never felt lonely on a campus of 12,000
strangers. And yet I don't think I'm betraying the truth
with these memories. Perhaps it is only the abrupt and
relatively permanent shift to a new environment that ac
counts for such feelings, but I can't help but see the past
four years through this murky window of selectivity — a
view which, I am convinced, does bear more than a slight
resemblance to reality.
It was a lonely philosopher who wrote, "Friends may
come and go, but enemies accumulate." For me, it is the
accumulation of fond memories, and of friends who made
them possible, that will stand as this school's greatest con
tribution to my education. If we were at our best, it is only
because we were with each other.
