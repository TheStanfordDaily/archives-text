Eight days after my arrest at the
Bursar's Office and five days since
my letter of May 31,1 wish to offer
the following observations on my
act of civil disobedience and its
fallout.
First, let me state that a princi
ple concern, that of returning the
issue of total divestment to the
fore in conversation on campus,
seems to have been achieved.
While students, faced with obvious

VIEWPOINT

and legitimate concerns about
final exams, are clearly devoting
most of their attention and time to
academic ends, they are nonethe
less aware of the continuing
divestment effort. My arrest plays
a part in maintaining this aware
ness, which I applaud and wish to
see continue.
Second, I desired directly and
personally to protest the Univer
sity's direct support of the Pretoria
government. Civil disobedience is
fundamentally an action of a per
sonal nature, and my decision to
participate in the occupation of
the Bursar's Office was an inde
pendent one requiring no connec
tion with any of the many organi
zations calling for total divest
ment.
There are other factors contri
buting to the utility of my act of
civil disobedience. That I was will
ing to accept arrest and imprison
ment demonstrates a depth of
commitment to change, and a
sense of urgency in seeing this
change realized thai may have
opened some eyes to the serious
ness of the current tragedy in

South Africa.
Finally, the arrests throw the
matter back into University Presi
dent Kennedy's lap and require
that he again voice his opinions on
total divestment.
Who's kidding whom? Hoping
that the protest will fade, the Uni
versity has thrown up a
smokescreen of purported
"rational discourse" in order to
maintain its true one-item agenda.
Trustee James Gaither, at the May
8 forum, made it all too clear that
this single concern is profit.
I haven't the space to provide
you in appropriate detail the argu
ments for total divestment, so I
urge you to satisfy yourself on the
matter. Kennedy and the board
are on record, and opposing view
points are widely available. Should
you then feel as I do, stand up and
be heard, in whatever fashion suits
you. There is no guarantee that
Stanford will divest, but the worth
of non-violent protest exists inde
pendent of the outcome, and it is a
certainty, given the makeup of the
board, that the University will
never divest unless significant
pressure is brought to bear by
members of the campus commu
nity. I felt, given the utility of civil
disobedience in producing some of
this pressure, that my action was
wholly justified. 1 am cheered by
my experience, and I will continue
to protest Stanford's support of
the oppression that is South
Africa. Stay through graduation
and use that time to ensure that
your voice is heard.
