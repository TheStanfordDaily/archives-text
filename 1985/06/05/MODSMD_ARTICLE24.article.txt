## Racism helps shape U.S. policy in Central America 
### 
I had a little excitement yesterday. I had to
meet the train and give the Marine guard some
mail for the States, and a Spig spit on me. I
jumped aboard and ordered him off, hut he
refused to move and attempted to draw a knife,
so I laid my pistol hutt to his head and carried
him to the door and tossed him off The train
was making about 10 miles an hour, and he
broke his arm when he fell. We sent him to
headquarters under guard. Don't know what
(hex will do to him in there.

VIEWPOINT

This account, excerpted from a letter an
American Marine stationed in Nicaragua
wrote to his family hack home, dates from
more than half a century ago. The racism it
displays was a major factor in the un
ashamedly interventionist policy this young
man was helping to carry out. Today, the atti
tude of contempt toward the "little brown
people" who populate the countries immedi
ately to our south is no longer openly ex
pressed in the public pronouncements of top
Washington officials, hut it still plays an im
portant underlying role in the formulation
and execution of U.S. policy toward Central
America.
This is not to say that racism is the
determining element in shaping this policy;
economic, strategic and ideological motives
are more central. But racism helps shape the
ways these guiding forces of U.S. foreign
policy play themselves out in Central
America, and Washington's behavior toward
the region cannot be satisfactorily explained
without taking it into account.
The feeling persists among U.S.
policymakers that the inhabitants of Central
America are fundamentally not competent to
run their nations' internal affairs, that we
know their true interests better than they
themselves do. Closely related to this notion
is the perception that Central America is a
political vacuum, the logical deduction being

that, if U.S. influence (or, more accurately,
domination) there recedes, Soviet influence
must automatically expand to fill the resultant
void.
Washington officials view Central
Americans exclusively as objects being acted
upon, as passive recipients of externally
imposed agendas. The possibility that they
might actually be capable of functioning as
dynamic actors, as the architects of their own
future, is not even deemed worthy of consid
eration. As a result of these perceptions,
genuine independence is hy definition ruled
out as a viable option for Central America,
and U.S. policymakers feel even less
obligated to maintain the appearance of
abiding by the principles of non-intervention
and self-determination in this region than
they do in other areas of the world.
Given that the people of Central America
are congenitally unfit to govern themselves,
the policymakers feel, it is only right and
proper that the United States, their "big
brother" to the north, should accept the
manifest destiny of "managing" the affairs of
the little neighbors which nature has placed in
her "backyard."
Historically, racism has manifested itself in
one of two divergent forms in U.S. interven
tion in Central America, although the two
faces of intervention are really just two sides
of the same coin. When the natives are prop
erly submissive, the "big brother" role comes
to the fore, with the United States assuming a
solicitous and benign — if patronizing, pater
nalistic and at bottom still contemptuous —
stance. But when Central Americans ungrate
fully reject Washington's tutelage. Big
Brother turns vindictive and vicious, and the
racism that has been lurking beneath the
surface all along expresses itself openly in the
form of violence.
And. because the targets of this violence
are people who are "not like us," whom we
may even subconsciously regard as less than
fullv human, this violence is not bounded bv

the same restraints that traditionally govern
hostile actions we undertake against "white"
nations. It is worth remembering that both
Japan, the only country we have used nuclear
weapons against, and Vietnam, the country
we subjected to the most intense bombing
campaign in history, were populated by non
white races.
These countries' racial composition was not
the reason for the murderous U.S. actions
toward them, but it certainly made these ac
tions easier to take. Had the projected victims
been people who "looked like us," it is certain
that Washington policymakers would have
thought longer and harder before deciding on
such drastic measures.

It is worth remembering that both Japan, the
only country we have used nuclear weapons
against, and Vietnam, the country we sub
jected to the most intense bombing campaign
in history, were populated by non-white races.

Similarly, it is hard to imagine the CIA
mining Le Havre harbor, bombing London
airport, blowing up hospitals and schools in
Sweden, or conducting a campaign of assas
sinations and terror against farmers in rural
Germany, without at least giving these moves
some serious prior consideration and doing a
bit of soul-searching; yet the decision to do all
these things to Nicaragua was apparently
made quickly, unquestioningly, almost
casually.
Because we regard life as cheap south of
the border, because we find it easier to bear
the suffering of a Nicaraguan or a Sal
vadorean than that of, sav, a Pole, we are less

disturbed by the prospect of causing
bloodshed there, and find acceptable policies
which we would reject as heinous if applied in
other, more "civilized" regions of the world.
The notion of the lower value of human life
in Central America also manifests itself in
several other ways. It would be difficult for
the Reagan administration to take such a
blatantly cynical, hypocritical position on the
issue of human rights relative to a
predominantly Anglo-Saxon area. In particu
lar, the administration would have more trou
ble getting away with the maneuver of shifting
the issue from the absolute condition of
human rights to the supposed "improvement"
in that condition if the corpses behind the

manipulated figures were white. Were this the
case, we would be seeing many more critics
point out that every human life has an im
measurable value, that the deprivation of
even a single such life is intolerable, and that
the idea that a marginal decrease in the num
ber of political murders committed by a state
makes that state worthy of our full endorse
ment is a morally repugnant one.
Also, it is striking how much attention one
American's death commands — and how
great an impact it is capable of having on U.S.
policy — relative to the innumerable Central
Americans who are being killed every day.
Some 50.000 Nicaraguans died at the hands

of the National Guard in the late 19705, but
the U.S. media sat up and took notice only
when the guard did away with one of their
own, ABC reporter Bill Stewart. Similarly,
roughly 45,000 Salvadorans have been mur
dered by their country's U.S.-supported se
curity forces and death squads in recent years,
but only when the four U.S. nuns were assas
sinated did El Salvador make the headlines.
Finally, it seems improbable that the
"culture of violence" rationalization — the
idea that "these people" have a tradition of
killing each other off anyway, so it doesn't
really matter much if we help the process
along a bit— would be as readily swallowed if
applied to populations to which we feel more
ethnically akin.
And racism still on occasion manifests itself
in subtle ways even in the realm of official dis
course. Listen to the profoundly con
temptuous terms in which Reagan routinely
refers to the Nicaraguan leadership — which,
after all, includes internationally renowned
authors, intellectuals and priests — and ask
yourself if he'd ever talk the same way about
European heads of state. The answer, of
course, is no.
Another, more blatant example is Reagan's
constant harping on the specter of brown
skinned people who will supposedly deluge
the United States if we do not obliterate all
revolutionary movements throughout the
region — a naked appeal to race prejudice in
a desperate bid to muster support for an
exceedingly unpopular policy. (And, while
we're on the subject, the Reagan administra
tion's systematic denial of political asylum to
Salvadoran and Guatemalan refugees obvi
ously has a strong racist component.)
So there can unfortunately be no doubt that
racism, which is clearly alive and well on the
domestic front, is also continuing to flourish
and play a formative role in the area of U.S.
policy toward Central America.

I had a little excitement yesterday. I had to
meet the train and give the Marine guard some
mail for the States, and a Spig spit on me. I
jumped aboard and ordered him off, hut he
refused to move and attempted to draw a knife,
so I laid my pistol hutt to his head and carried
him to the door and tossed him off The train
was making about 10 miles an hour, and he
broke his arm when he fell. We sent him to
headquarters under guard. Don't know what

VIEWPOINT

This account, excerpted from a letter an
American Marine stationed in Nicaragua
wrote to his family hack home, dates from
more than half a century ago. The racism it
displays was a major factor in the un
ashamedly interventionist policy this young
man was helping to carry out. Today, the atti
tude of contempt toward the "little brown
people" who populate the countries immedi
ately to our south is no longer openly ex
pressed in the public pronouncements of top
Washington officials, hut it still plays an im
portant underlying role in the formulation
and execution of U.S. policy toward Central
America.
This is not to say that racism is the
determining element in shaping this policy;
economic, strategic and ideological motives
are more central. But racism helps shape the
ways these guiding forces of U.S. foreign
policy play themselves out in Central
America, and Washington's behavior toward
the region cannot be satisfactorily explained
without taking it into account.
The feeling persists among U.S.
policymakers that the inhabitants of Central
America are fundamentally not competent to
run their nations' internal affairs, that we
know their true interests better than they
themselves do. Closely related to this notion
is the perception that Central America is a
political vacuum, the logical deduction being

that, if U.S. influence (or, more accurately,
domination) there recedes, Soviet influence
must automatically expand to fill the resultant
void.
Washington officials view Central
Americans exclusively as objects being acted
upon, as passive recipients of externally
imposed agendas. The possibility that they
might actually be capable of functioning as
dynamic actors, as the architects of their own
future, is not even deemed worthy of consid
eration. As a result of these perceptions,
genuine independence is hy definition ruled
out as a viable option for Central America,
and U.S. policymakers feel even less
obligated to maintain the appearance of
abiding by the principles of non-intervention
and self-determination in this region than
they do in other areas of the world.
Given that the people of Central America
are congenitally unfit to govern themselves,
the policymakers feel, it is only right and
proper that the United States, their "big
brother" to the north, should accept the
manifest destiny of "managing" the affairs of
the little neighbors which nature has placed in
her "backyard."
Historically, racism has manifested itself in
one of two divergent forms in U.S. interven
tion in Central America, although the two
faces of intervention are really just two sides
of the same coin. When the natives are prop
erly submissive, the "big brother" role comes
to the fore, with the United States assuming a
solicitous and benign — if patronizing, pater
nalistic and at bottom still contemptuous —
stance. But when Central Americans ungrate
fully reject Washington's tutelage. Big
Brother turns vindictive and vicious, and the
racism that has been lurking beneath the
surface all along expresses itself openly in the
form of violence.
And. because the targets of this violence
are people who are "not like us," whom we
may even subconsciously regard as less than
fullv human, this violence is not bounded bv

the same restraints that traditionally govern
hostile actions we undertake against "white"
nations. It is worth remembering that both
Japan, the only country we have used nuclear
weapons against, and Vietnam, the country
we subjected to the most intense bombing
campaign in history, were populated by non
white races.
These countries' racial composition was not
the reason for the murderous U.S. actions
toward them, but it certainly made these ac
tions easier to take. Had the projected victims
been people who "looked like us," it is certain
that Washington policymakers would have
thought longer and harder before deciding on
such drastic measures.

It is worth remembering that both Japan, the
only country we have used nuclear weapons
against, and Vietnam, the country we sub
jected to the most intense bombing campaign
in history, were populated by non-white races.

Similarly, it is hard to imagine the CIA
mining Le Havre harbor, bombing London
airport, blowing up hospitals and schools in
Sweden, or conducting a campaign of assas
sinations and terror against farmers in rural
Germany, without at least giving these moves
some serious prior consideration and doing a
bit of soul-searching; yet the decision to do all
these things to Nicaragua was apparently
made quickly, unquestioningly, almost
casually.
Because we regard life as cheap south of
the border, because we find it easier to bear
the suffering of a Nicaraguan or a Sal
vadorean than that of, sav, a Pole, we are less

disturbed by the prospect of causing
bloodshed there, and find acceptable policies
which we would reject as heinous if applied in
other, more "civilized" regions of the world.
The notion of the lower value of human life
in Central America also manifests itself in
several other ways. It would be difficult for
the Reagan administration to take such a
blatantly cynical, hypocritical position on the
issue of human rights relative to a
predominantly Anglo-Saxon area. In particu
lar, the administration would have more trou
ble getting away with the maneuver of shifting
the issue from the absolute condition of
human rights to the supposed "improvement"
in that condition if the corpses behind the

manipulated figures were white. Were this the
case, we would be seeing many more critics
point out that every human life has an im
measurable value, that the deprivation of
even a single such life is intolerable, and that
the idea that a marginal decrease in the num
ber of political murders committed by a state
makes that state worthy of our full endorse
ment is a morally repugnant one.
Also, it is striking how much attention one
American's death commands — and how
great an impact it is capable of having on U.S.
policy — relative to the innumerable Central
Americans who are being killed every day.
Some 50.000 Nicaraguans died at the hands

of the National Guard in the late 19705, but
the U.S. media sat up and took notice only
when the guard did away with one of their
own, ABC reporter Bill Stewart. Similarly,
roughly 45,000 Salvadorans have been mur
dered by their country's U.S.-supported se
curity forces and death squads in recent years,
but only when the four U.S. nuns were assas
sinated did El Salvador make the headlines.
Finally, it seems improbable that the
"culture of violence" rationalization — the
idea that "these people" have a tradition of
killing each other off anyway, so it doesn't
really matter much if we help the process
along a bit— would be as readily swallowed if
applied to populations to which we feel more
ethnically akin.
And racism still on occasion manifests itself
in subtle ways even in the realm of official dis
course. Listen to the profoundly con
temptuous terms in which Reagan routinely
refers to the Nicaraguan leadership — which,
after all, includes internationally renowned
authors, intellectuals and priests — and ask
yourself if he'd ever talk the same way about
European heads of state. The answer, of
