## Stanford expects 40,000 to attend Commencement 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Staff writer 
A record 40,000 people are ex
pected to attend Stanford's 96th
Commencement on June 16, accord
ing to Nan Bentley, assistant director
of University Events and Services and
coordinator of graduation.
About 4,200 students will be
graduated in the ceremony, held in
Stanford Stadium for the first time
since 1935. Graduates will receive
their diplomas in 35 individual de
partment ceremonies following Com
mencement.
Bentley said 25,000 tickets to the
Sunday morning ceremony have
already been distributed to seniors
who requested them. "That is more
than I expected," Bentley said.
"Originally, 1 thought there would be
(a total attendance of) 25,000."
Bentley said the availability of un
limited numbers of tickets and the
fame of the commencement speaker,
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, has
attracted a large crowd. Tickets for
the general public will be available
next week at the Tresidder
Ticket Office, Bentley said. All tick
ets are for unreserved general admis
sion seating and are color-coded to
indicate which entrances should be
used by the holder.
Construction of a specially built
stage designed by Asst. Art Prof.
Greg Lynch will begin inside the
stadium Monday, Bentley said.
A model showing the stadium plan is
now on display in the second-floor
lounge of the Braun Music Center.
Cuomo's address will be the last on
his schedule of 11 commencement
speeches this year, including one
today at Harvard's class
day. Despite invitations from many
public institutions, Cuomo is continu

ing his policy of speaking only at
private colleges and universities. The
Stanford commencement will also be
his only speech outside the Northeast.
Peter Quinn, Cuomo's speech
writer, told The New York l imes that
Cuomo sees this series of commence
ment addresses as direct results of
three speeches he gave outlining his
thoughts on morality and the philoso-

phy of government, including his
keynote address at the Democratic
National Convention last summer
and a later speech at the University of
Notre Dame on abortion.
In commencement addresses he
has given this year, Cuomo has
stressed the importance of individual
involvement in politics and social
concerns. Speaking to 2,021 degree
candidates at the University of

Rochester's commencement on May
12, Cuomo exhorted the students to
become involved in the political sys
tem and to make government more
fair and more responsive.
"Much of the talent here," Cuomo
told the graduates, "much of your
enormous potential, will go into the
world of business, of science, of law
or academics, and in the process bring
new strengths, new improvements to
our society. But there will probably
be no similar commitment to our po
litical process, even if just at the level
of voting or advocating. I'm afraid
we'll pay a price for this. In fact, I
think the disinterest in politics is
already affecting us negatively and
perversely."
On May 26, Cuomo urged graduat
ing students at Vassar College and
Colgate University to be concerned
about the plight of the poor in
America. Cuomo told the 565 mem
bers of Vassar's 121st graduating
class to use the knowledge they had
acquired to help society progress
while easing social ills.
"We need you to assert those
values taught here at Vassar,"
Cuomo said. "We need you to assert
those values on the mean streets
beyond these walls. Despite the glit
ter, the success and the joy surround
ing you, all is not well in the world we
live in."
A few hours later at Colgate,
Cuomo gave the 642 graduates a
similar message.
"We need people who understand
how all the parts relate, who know
that unless we infuse all our strivings
and compassion with intelligent con
cern for the common good, then we
will be just another rich and affluent
society that struts and frets its hour
on the world stage."
