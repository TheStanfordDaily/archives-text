# C-IR may get research funds
## 
### MICHAEL GOFF Editorial staff 
A high-level administrator in the
Treasurer's Office said yesterday that
University Treasurer Rod Adams
would recommend to University
President Donald Kennedy an alloca
tion of $100,000 in extra resources to
the Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility for research, according to
Mark Landesmann, a student mem
ber of the C-IR.
The recommendation stems from
the first section of a student proposal
to expand the staff and function of
the C-IR. The added resources would
be used to research the practices of
companies in Stanford's portfolio that
do business in South Africa.
Landesmann said the seven mem
bers of the commission in attendance
at yesterday's meeting demonstrated
a strong consensus in favor of the stu
dent proposal but were unable to
issue a formal recommendation with
out the necessary two-thirds majority
(eight members) present.
According to Landesmann, the
money proposed by the treasurer
would be used for case-by-case inves
tigations into the practices of com
panies in Stanford's portfolio. The
$100,000 would include allocations
for the employment of three students
on a full-time basis over the summer

and a number' of students and full
time employees during the year to
carry out the research, Landesmann
said. Specific emphasis was placed on
ensuring that the research team
would be directed and coordinated by
one of the staff members under the
C-IR rather than by the Treasurer's
Office.
In addition, money would be used
for travel expenses and the establish
ment of a computer data base accessi
ble to the Stanford community. The
data base would include disclosure of
University holdings in companies
with business interests in South
Africa, and University actions on
these companies.
Landesmann said he feels that the
treasurer's recommendation is a
"reflection of the interaction between
Kennedy and the other administra
tors," and that he is sure Kennedy
will bring up the treasurer's allocation
recommendation at this month's trus
tee meeting.
"The University is likely to act in
light of the treasurer's report," Lan
desmann said, because it is
"indicative of administrative senti
ment." To this point, Landesmann
said the treasurer "has been on the
conservative side of resource commit-
ment. I would be strongly surprised if
that report would not be accepted"
by the trustees.
Landesmann cautioned, however,
that though the recommendation may
seem like a major victory for those
calling for increased C-IR research, it
is "not in itself proof of the sincerity
of the University. The proof will be
not in the size but in the purpose of
the research committee."
In other action, the C-IR yesterday
proposed that a letter be sent to
Motorola removing the freeze on
University acquisition of its stock.
Acquisitions were frozen earlier in
the year when the Board of Trustees
voted in favor of a conditional divest
ment of University holdings in
Motorola.
