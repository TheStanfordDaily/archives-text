Dear Bug Me,
Why are Q-Tips called Q-Tips? I
can t come up with a single "Q" char
acteristic that seems right. Quick Tips?
Quiet Tips? Quit-Sticking- Your-
Finger-ln-Your-Ear Tips? 1 under
stand Kleenex - there's that cute hid
den word in the name. But Q-Tip? Is
there some Mr. or Mrs. Q-something
who invented them and is sitting
around really pissed because Joe
America never gives him or her credit
when he is cleaning out his ears?
Please reply soon - my Q-Tips are
right next to my Kleenex box. It bugs
me every morning. - Gary Christensen

You may giggle, but the saga of this
baby product brand name literally
broils with the turmoil, lust and gen
eral brouhaha of the glitzy Madison
Avenue world of advertising.
From its provocative splash into
the high-stakes market of infant care
in 1926, under the name of Baby
Gays, to its high-tech 1980s usage as
a fashion disposable eye-shadow ap
plicator, the Q-Tip has stood the
hygiene community on its extra
cotton-padded end.
The enigmatic "Q," however,
stands for quality, although 1 like
your ideas just as well, and have the
sneaking suspicion that a guy with a
name like Leo Gerstenzang might
have envisioned his invention in that
manner, and his descendants just want
to cover up the embarrassing history.
But then, Rob Bobick of

Cheeseborough-Pond's public affairs
office did admit to the Baby Gays
name and related the story of the in
vention of this indispensable dis
posable cotton swab.
Gersten/ang immigrated from
Warsaw in the early '20s and was
watching his wife wrap cotton around
little sticks while bathing their baby,
when the spirit of Horace Greeley
came upon him.
"Building a better mouse trap" was
easy, according to Sheila Rossi, who
handles the Q-Tip advertising ac
count with the Rowland Company.
Then he had to experiment with
names.
Baby Gays very shortly became
Cute Tips, but Rossi said he thought
that was "just too awful," so he fi
nally compromised with Q-Tips.
It's on the same pattern as many
well-respected terms like T-shirt, A
frame, and B-day, for those of us who
aren't very good with cake icing.
Whatever your opinion of Q-Tips,
the name isn't going to change soon.
Rossi explained that "whole offices of
lawyers would go hysterical" if some
one even suggested changing the
name to something more fitting, like
Woolly Mammoth Toothpicks, or
pufty pointers, or annoying-fuzzy
things-that-always-drop-in-the-sink.
But then, if you think of the Q-Tip
as the essence and symbol of the
modern era of Western culture, it ac
quires a certain air of primitive
justice, typifying the acronym men
tality with softly couched wit.
At less than two cents a swab,
you're complaining?
What are kiwis? Someone told me
they were a mix of banana and straw
berry. - Kristen Sken field
Bananas grow in tropical areas.
Strawberries grow in temperate zones
of the globe. Kiwis grow in New
Zealand.

In other words, I don't think they
overlap.
I tried all sorts of departments to
find an expert on this subject, hut
kiwis are evidently an area of aca
demic pursuit in which Stanford Uni
versity is gravely lacking.
1 did have a nice chat with Duke,
who works at a natural food and vita
min store in Mountain View.
According to him, kiwis have lots
of vitamin C, and farmers in Half
Moon Bay and other areas of the
state have started growing the
grenade-sized, khaki green fruit.
Duke just happened to be an
amateur bird watcher, too, and he
spent most of our conversation
describing the fuzzy, flightless kiwi

bird that is also native to New
Zealand.
Kiwi is really the Maori word for a
shrill bird call, and if you've seen the
fruit, you can maybe understand how
it could get confused with a prickly
brown wingless bird.
The kiwi's egg is the largest in the
world compared to the size of the
bird, but I could find no documenta
tion on whether it is the size or
texture or color or consistency of the
actual kiwi fruit.
My suspicion is that hard-boiled
kiwi wouldn't taste as good as ripe
kiwi, though.
Five years ago, I wrote to Bug Me to
ask why the traffic light on Palm Drive

didn 't just flash red late at night. Your
great-great-grand columnist made the
appropriate inquiries, and assured me
the matter would he attended to
"soon. '' Now, I'm not one of your
standard California instant
gratification seekers, but 1 do think
that things are a little out of hand here.
What gives? - D.R.F. and C.S.D.
It's good to know that this institu
tion has time-honored traditions.
In other words, the answer is still
"soon," according to about everyone
you'd want to talk to in the Planning,
Operations and Maintenance and
Utilities offices.
John Lerry, a facilities engineer,
said that there is a studv under wav

now to explore the benefits and costs
of rewiring the aging, 20-year-old
light system to respond to the pres
ence of cars 24 hours a day, some
thing called "vehicle actuation" (sort
of like being the best possible Honda
Prelude one can be, 1 guess).
The project should cost less than
$50,000, a sum that will not be
wasted when, in the dim quagmire of
the future, the University decides to
repave Palm Drive and replace all the
intersection gizmos at the same time.
The thing that's holding up the ve
hicle actuation is the ordering and
delivery time of a new controller,
which should arrive and be installed


within about six months time.
That was the most definite "soon"
that I got.
Jeff Sultan of Utilities said that the
improvements have "sort of been
decided."
He explained that such projects
usually merit lower priorities than
anything to do with the academic
function of the University. Of course,
when the road gets so bad that pro
fessors can't get to work, I guess that
will change.
He also remembered that a couple
years ago, the lights just flashed all
the time, but the police felt this was a
hazard because people got used to the
situation and started driving too fast
through the intersection, so it was
changed to the present, three-way,
sloth-like system (all right, I'm
editorializing, I admit it).
Who is this Marilyn Wann, and how
does she have time to do what she
does? - G.R. and T.C. in A.P.
You know, I wish I could help you
with this question, but of the 60 or so
questions I've answered during this
volume of The Daily, the research for
this last, final and closing one has
been the roughest.
I kept calling the girl, but she was
never in her room, or at least never
answered her phone. She has a

roommate, but it's almost impossible
to make out what she says through
her Chicago accent. She seemed nice,
though, and 1 think she told me to try
The Daily office number.
So I did, and various editors and
random people who happened to be
trooping by and felt !il e answering a
phone revealed to me that they don't
see her much, either.
Every once in a while they throw
her an apple, but mostly she only
scurries out at nioht to tvpe
into the terminals they leave on for
her and to occasionally leave a
lovelorn message for someone named
Archie, who is believed to be a poetic
cockroach living under a typewriter in
some backward newspaper office in a
big city, eating apple peels and being
continually harassed by an alley cat
named Mehitabel.
So the only answer I can give you is
that Bug Me is just something that
happens to a person, like paper cuts,
puberty and spring quarter at Stan
ford.
Even if you're crazy enough to
have a hankering to make them stay,
they tend to wander away on you,
only to come back when they'll
"annoy" you the most.
As for your second question, she
doesn't.
In fact, celebrating the completion
of her last Bug Me by floating some
rubber on the Lake probably sounds
pretty good to her right now.

Dear Bug Me,
Why are Q-Tips called Q-Tips? I
can t come up with a single "Q" char
acteristic that seems right. Quick Tips?
Quiet Tips? Quit-Sticking- Your-
Finger-ln-Your-Ear Tips? 1 under
stand Kleenex - there's that cute hid
den word in the name. But Q-Tip? Is
there some Mr. or Mrs. Q-something
who invented them and is sitting
around really pissed because Joe
America never gives him or her credit
when he is cleaning out his ears?
Please reply soon - my Q-Tips are
right next to my Kleenex box. It bugs
me every morning. - Gary Christensen

You may giggle, but the saga of this
baby product brand name literally
broils with the turmoil, lust and gen
eral brouhaha of the glitzy Madison
Avenue world of advertising.
From its provocative splash into
the high-stakes market of infant care
in 1926, under the name of Baby
Gays, to its high-tech 1980s usage as
a fashion disposable eye-shadow ap
plicator, the Q-Tip has stood the
hygiene community on its extra
cotton-padded end.
The enigmatic "Q," however,
stands for quality, although 1 like
your ideas just as well, and have the
sneaking suspicion that a guy with a
name like Leo Gerstenzang might
have envisioned his invention in that
manner, and his descendants just want
to cover up the embarrassing history.
But then, Rob Bobick of

Cheeseborough-Pond's public affairs
office did admit to the Baby Gays
name and related the story of the in
vention of this indispensable dis
posable cotton swab.
Gersten/ang immigrated from
Warsaw in the early '20s and was
watching his wife wrap cotton around
little sticks while bathing their baby,
when the spirit of Horace Greeley
came upon him.
"Building a better mouse trap" was
easy, according to Sheila Rossi, who
handles the Q-Tip advertising ac
count with the Rowland Company.
Then he had to experiment with
names.
Baby Gays very shortly became
Cute Tips, but Rossi said he thought
that was "just too awful," so he fi
nally compromised with Q-Tips.
It's on the same pattern as many
well-respected terms like T-shirt, A
frame, and B-day, for those of us who
aren't very good with cake icing.
Whatever your opinion of Q-Tips,
the name isn't going to change soon.
Rossi explained that "whole offices of
lawyers would go hysterical" if some
one even suggested changing the
name to something more fitting, like
Woolly Mammoth Toothpicks, or
pufty pointers, or annoying-fuzzy
things-that-always-drop-in-the-sink.
But then, if you think of the Q-Tip
as the essence and symbol of the
modern era of Western culture, it ac
quires a certain air of primitive
justice, typifying the acronym men
tality with softly couched wit.
At less than two cents a swab,
you're complaining?
What are kiwis? Someone told me
they were a mix of banana and straw
berry. - Kristen Sken field
Bananas grow in tropical areas.
Strawberries grow in temperate zones
of the globe. Kiwis grow in New
Zealand.

In other words, I don't think they
overlap.
I tried all sorts of departments to
find an expert on this subject, hut
kiwis are evidently an area of aca
demic pursuit in which Stanford Uni
versity is gravely lacking.
1 did have a nice chat with Duke,
who works at a natural food and vita
min store in Mountain View.
According to him, kiwis have lots
of vitamin C, and farmers in Half
Moon Bay and other areas of the
state have started growing the
grenade-sized, khaki green fruit.
Duke just happened to be an
amateur bird watcher, too, and he
spent most of our conversation
describing the fuzzy, flightless kiwi

bird that is also native to New
Zealand.
Kiwi is really the Maori word for a
shrill bird call, and if you've seen the
fruit, you can maybe understand how
it could get confused with a prickly
brown wingless bird.
The kiwi's egg is the largest in the
world compared to the size of the
bird, but I could find no documenta
tion on whether it is the size or
texture or color or consistency of the
actual kiwi fruit.
My suspicion is that hard-boiled
kiwi wouldn't taste as good as ripe
kiwi, though.
Five years ago, I wrote to Bug Me to
ask why the traffic light on Palm Drive

didn 't just flash red late at night. Your
great-great-grand columnist made the
appropriate inquiries, and assured me
the matter would he attended to
"soon. '' Now, I'm not one of your
standard California instant
gratification seekers, but 1 do think
that things are a little out of hand here.
What gives? - D.R.F. and C.S.D.
It's good to know that this institu
tion has time-honored traditions.
In other words, the answer is still
"soon," according to about everyone
you'd want to talk to in the Planning,
Operations and Maintenance and
Utilities offices.
John Lerry, a facilities engineer,
said that there is a studv under wav

now to explore the benefits and costs
of rewiring the aging, 20-year-old
light system to respond to the pres
ence of cars 24 hours a day, some
thing called "vehicle actuation" (sort
of like being the best possible Honda
