Super Bowl fever infected Stanford this January, as fans unable to
get tickets turned to catch some of the flavor by watching the game
on TV in the Stanford Stadium parking lot. Meanwhile, many an
area resident turned entrepreneur in attempts to cash in on the con
verging football crowds.


Playboy's April visit to campus sparked pickets and rallies in protest of the maga
zine's planned "Girls of the Pac-10" pictorial. Stanford Students Opposed to Por
nography and Women at Stanford Law planned the demonstrations and garnered
more than 1,400 signatures on petitions supporting their goals.


Sophomore Brad Muster gained 204 yards in Big Game, leading the Cardinal
to a 27-10 win over Cal. Muster gained 823 total yards en route to Stanford's
less-than-outstanding but vastly improved 5-6 record (3-5 in the Pac-10) in
Jack El way's first year as head coach.


As University President Donald Kennedy said last week, the crane may become the official
campus bird. Construction, on everything from the Center for Integrated Systems to a new
telecommunications system, continuously changed the face of campus all year.


The Concert Network brought to Stanford its first concert in two years
when the Grateful Dead played Frost last month.


Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale si

Auditorium because of rain, drew a crowd of 2,000,
