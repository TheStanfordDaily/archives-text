## Preparing for a jolt of devastation 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Staff writer 
Stanford was devastated by the
1906 earthquake.
A chimney fell through the roof at
the Encina men's dormitory, carrying
down a tier of rooms into the base
ment. One student was killed.
Many buildings in the Quad were
damaged. Memorial Church's roof
suffered extensive damage, and
nearby arches were destroyed.
The water tank at the Faculty
Clubhouse was wrecked, spilling gal
lons of water.
And 6-year-old Gaylord Stanford
(of no relation to the founders of the
small Western educational institu
tion) wet his pants out of fright.
Officials at Stanford say they aren't

sure exactly how much damage the
University would suffer if a quake of
similar size were to hit the Stanford
campus now. They say it's likely that
there would be a large amount of
destruction, and, for whatever it's
worth, the University is better
prepared than many other nearby
communities.
"If you compare us to other people
in this area, we're very prepared, but
we need to do a lot more thinking
about it," said Kent Peterson, the
University's associate vice president
of business and finance. "Even
though we live with the possibility of
being hit by a big earthquake, most
people don't think about it."
But according to Peterson, mem
bers of the University's administra

tion have started to inform a "large
number" of people here about
earthquake safety.
"But it's still not enough. There are
still a lot of people who haven't
thought about it," Peterson said.
One of the groups that tries to
promote awareness of earthquakes
here is the Earthquake Advisory
Group, a committee of faculty and
staff that works on improving
earthquake safety in hazardous envi
ronments on campus.
According to Brian O'Neill, a
health and safety specialist, there are
about 200 laboratories on campus
with potentially dangerous chemicals.
O'Neill said his office inspects the
laboratories, encouraging the people
there to perform such safety

measures as putting lips on the
shelves where chemicals are kept to
avoid spills in the case of a quake.
"We're trying to work on getting
people to better secure equipment,"
O'Neill said. "In a really bad
earthquake some labs would be too
hazardous to go into."
O'Neill said another area of con
cern is the libraries, where thousands
of books arc likely to be knocked off
shelves during an earthquake.
"The whole library system would
be trashed" in a bad earthquake,
O'Neill said.
O'Neill's office inspects various de
partments on campus and makes
recommendations as to how they can
improve safety, but he says his de
partment "is not a police force."
Kathleen Collins, a health and
safety specialist, said inspectors "try
to have discerning eyes." They try to
make sure that computer areas are
sound, that there are no potential
tripping hazards and that exits and
entrances are clear.
O'Neill said his department is
working out a plan with student radio
station K.ZSU to broadcast emer
gency information in the case of a
quake.
Besides making sure that buildings
have fire extinguishers and first aid
supplies, O'Neill said inspectors try to
assure that heavy objects are secured.
He said the University assumes
that in the case of a serious
earthquake, there will be no major
form of transportation in and out of
the area for three days. He points out
that San Francisco Airport is built on
landfill, which "has a tendency to set
tle," and that many local highways
and train tracks will be ruined.
The University, he said, has three
emergency wells and four large emer
gency generators. University Food
Service has enough food to produce
twice its normal meal load for a week,
he said.
Although it is difficult to predict
how buildings will react to a large
earthquake, the 85-year-old Old
Chemistry Building is probably the
least safe on campus, many health

and safety specialists say. The build
ing, which was severely damaged in
the 1906 earthquake and repaired
shortly thereafter using much of the
original stone, has had structural
problems.
"While it is not below any building
code, it is a building that concerns
us," said Ray Bacchetti, the vice
provost for management and director
of the University budgets. Bacchetti

said the University is trying to reduce
the use of the building by moving
classes that are held there now to
other buildings.
The primary emphasis, however,
seems to be on "awareness," and the
goal, through events like Earthquake
Awareness week every autumn, and
earthquake drills every other year, is
to make people "think about"
earthquakes.

The 1906 earthquake leveled the front entrance to the University and caused $1.2 million worth of damage.
Two people at the University were killed by the quake, which measured 8.25 on the Richter scale.

Two people at the University were killed by the quake, which measured 8.25 on the Richter scale.

Students experienced what a real earthquake could be like during an
earthquake awareness activity held last year. A major earthquake
could, among other things, cut off travel from the Bay Area for up to
three days.
Stanford was devastated by the
1906 earthquake.
A chimney fell through the roof at
the Encina men's dormitory, carrying
down a tier of rooms into the base
ment. One student was killed.
Many buildings in the Quad were
damaged. Memorial Church's roof
suffered extensive damage, and
nearby arches were destroyed.
The water tank at the Faculty
Clubhouse was wrecked, spilling gal
lons of water.
And 6-year-old Gaylord Stanford
(of no relation to the founders of the
small Western educational institu
tion) wet his pants out of fright.
Officials at Stanford say they aren't

sure exactly how much damage the
University would suffer if a quake of
similar size were to hit the Stanford
campus now. They say it's likely that
there would be a large amount of
destruction, and, for whatever it's
worth, the University is better
prepared than many other nearby
communities.
"If you compare us to other people
in this area, we're very prepared, but
we need to do a lot more thinking
about it," said Kent Peterson, the
University's associate vice president
of business and finance. "Even
though we live with the possibility of
being hit by a big earthquake, most
people don't think about it."
But according to Peterson, mem
bers of the University's administra

tion have started to inform a "large
number" of people here about
earthquake safety.
"But it's still not enough. There are
still a lot of people who haven't
thought about it," Peterson said.
One of the groups that tries to
promote awareness of earthquakes
here is the Earthquake Advisory
Group, a committee of faculty and
staff that works on improving
earthquake safety in hazardous envi
ronments on campus.
According to Brian O'Neill, a
health and safety specialist, there are
about 200 laboratories on campus
with potentially dangerous chemicals.
O'Neill said his office inspects the
laboratories, encouraging the people
there to perform such safety

measures as putting lips on the
shelves where chemicals are kept to
avoid spills in the case of a quake.
"We're trying to work on getting
people to better secure equipment,"
O'Neill said. "In a really bad
earthquake some labs would be too
hazardous to go into."
O'Neill said another area of con
cern is the libraries, where thousands
of books arc likely to be knocked off
shelves during an earthquake.
"The whole library system would
be trashed" in a bad earthquake,
O'Neill said.
O'Neill's office inspects various de
partments on campus and makes
recommendations as to how they can
improve safety, but he says his de
partment "is not a police force."
Kathleen Collins, a health and
safety specialist, said inspectors "try
to have discerning eyes." They try to
make sure that computer areas are
sound, that there are no potential
tripping hazards and that exits and
entrances are clear.
O'Neill said his department is
working out a plan with student radio
station K.ZSU to broadcast emer
gency information in the case of a
quake.
Besides making sure that buildings
have fire extinguishers and first aid
supplies, O'Neill said inspectors try to
assure that heavy objects are secured.
He said the University assumes
that in the case of a serious
earthquake, there will be no major
form of transportation in and out of
the area for three days. He points out
that San Francisco Airport is built on
landfill, which "has a tendency to set
tle," and that many local highways
and train tracks will be ruined.
The University, he said, has three
emergency wells and four large emer
gency generators. University Food
Service has enough food to produce
twice its normal meal load for a week,
he said.
Although it is difficult to predict
how buildings will react to a large
earthquake, the 85-year-old Old
Chemistry Building is probably the
least safe on campus, many health

and safety specialists say. The build
ing, which was severely damaged in
the 1906 earthquake and repaired
shortly thereafter using much of the
original stone, has had structural
problems.
"While it is not below any building
code, it is a building that concerns
us," said Ray Bacchetti, the vice
provost for management and director
of the University budgets. Bacchetti

said the University is trying to reduce
the use of the building by moving
classes that are held there now to
other buildings.
The primary emphasis, however,
seems to be on "awareness," and the
goal, through events like Earthquake
Awareness week every autumn, and
earthquake drills every other year, is
to make people "think about"
earthquakes.
