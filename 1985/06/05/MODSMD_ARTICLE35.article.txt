As the world's oil and gas reserves dwindle, coal
will necessarily play an increasingly important role
in meeting the world's energy needs. Engineers and
scientists at Stanford's High Temperature Gas
dynamics Laboratory have been conducting re
search to gain a better understanding of the actual
combustion process of coal. Coal combustion tech
nology is developing the ability to burn coal as
quickly and cleanly as possible.
"The chemical complexity of coal makes the
analysis of its combustion very difficult," said Me
chanical Engineering Prof. Charles Kruger, who
has been conducting this research. According to
Kruger, different hydrocarbon molecules in the
coal burn at different rates, depending on their
molecular weight and phase.
When solid coal is heated to temperatures at
which combustion can occur, a portion of the large
hydrocarbon molecules undergo a decomposition
called pyrolysis in which the large carbon chains
break into smaller ones. This process involves a
change of phase from solid to gas and very rapid
burning. The remaining solid portion of the coal is
called char.
Char burns at a much slower rate, as only those
molecules that are exposed to oxygen on the
surface of the particle can react, explained Kruger.
Most prior research on coal combustion has con
centrated on separately examining either the
pyrolysis stage or the char processes, said Kruger.
"Our research effort represents a sharp departure
from most previous research in that we are looking
at the entire combustion process, not just one stage
of it,"he said.
This research utilizes the High Temperature
Gasdynamics Laboratory's coal flow-tube reactor,
a specialized facility that, according to a recent

departmental report, "is designed to provide a con
trolled, known and uniform environment for the
study of coal reactivity."
Kruger described the facility. The reactor shown
in the diagram uses an argon plasma torch to pro
vide a low volume, high temperature heat source.
As the hot argon moves down the reactor, nitrogen
gas is injected to increase the flow rate. The desired
amount of oxygen is then injected through radial
injection ports. The fully mixed flow then enters
the reactor vessel homogeneous in temperature
and composition, he said.
A honeycomb disk through which the flow passes
before entering the reactor vessel ensures that the
entering gas flow is not turbulent, so that the coal
particles will fall through the reactor in straight and
readily traceable streamlines, said Kruger.
The actual reactor vessel is insulated with
ceramics and is heated to approximately the same
temperature as the hot gas to prevent heat loss in
the flow and to provide a constant temperature in
the vessel, Kruger explained. At the top of the re
actor, a coal feeder injects a precise amount of
carefully size-graded coal particles into the hot gas
flow. The injection port can be moved anywhere in
the reactor vessel to vary the amount of time that
the particles spend in the chamber, he said.
A sampling probe can similarly be moved
anywhere in the reactor to obtain samples of the
coal at any stage of its combustion. Two optical
ports in the reactor allow the combustion process to
be observed as it takes place. «■
Several methods of measuring combustion rates
are utilized, explained Kruger. The sampling probe
provides a sample of the gas which can be analyzed
for carbon oxide content. By using a mass balance
calculation based on the coal injection rate, the

amount of coal that has been oxidized at any point
in the flow can be accurately determined. Samples
of the coal particles can also be examined using a
variety of techniques to determine their physical
and chemical characteristics, he said. High speed
cameras stationed at the optical ports can also be
used to examine the combustion process.
Using this apparatus, researchers here have dis
covered that most of the combustion process gener
ally takes place more rapidly than was previously
believed. "So far, the most startling conclusion of
our research has been the discovery that most of
the carbon in each coal particle oxidizes in a much
shorter time than was previously believed," said
Kruger.
Examinations of the combustion process show
that more of the coal burns in the initial pyrolysis
stage than was previously believed, said Kruger.
High speed films of burning particles in the reactor
show that the vaporized hydrocarbons tend to burn
near the particle rather than diffusing throughout
the flow.
This increases the temperature in the vicinity of
the particle, increasing the rate at which the tem
perature dependent pyrolysis reactions can occur.
Microscopic examination of the char particles col
lected soon after injection show more cavitation,
gaps in the solid structure, than expected, giving
further evidence of pyrolysis, said Kruger.
The results of this research make possible the
design of more efficient coal combustors. "Once
the precise burning time of a type of coal is
known," said Kruger, "a combustor can be de
signed that holds the fuel for the precise time that it
requires to burn." This allows the maximum possi
ble energy to be obtained from the coal without
building an execessively large and costly combus
tor, he said.
