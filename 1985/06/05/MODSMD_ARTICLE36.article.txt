## Government to ban 'Ecstasy' 
### LISA LYNCH 
The Drug Enforcement agency will make
"Ecstasy" — the drug MDMA — illegal under an
emergency ban effective July 1, a DEA source said
last Thursday.
According to DEA spokesman Con Dougherty,
the ban classifies Ecstasy as a Schedule One Drug,
along with heroin, marijuana and LSD. Under the
Controlled Substances Act, possession or sale of
Schedule One drugs is punishable by up to 15 years
in prison and a $125,000 fine. Dougherty said that
cocaine is an example of a Schedule Two Drug; it
carries a lesser penalty because it has "some phar
macological use."
Ecstasy has been legal since 1914, when the
Merck Chemical Company patented it as a possible
appetite supressant. Acording to Harvard Psychol
ogy Prof. Lester Grinspoon, it was rediscovered in
the 1950s when the Defense Department looked at
it as a possible chemical weapon. In this way, it is
similar to LSD, which gained initial popularity in
the 1960s among the subjects of CIA chemical
warfare experiments.
The drug has been used by some psychother
apists who insist that Ecstasy — also known as
MDMA or 3,4, methylendioxymethylamphetamine
— shatters the psychological barriers that prevent
people from seeing their true selves. A synthetic
variation of oil of nutmeg, Ecstasy fosters a sense of
total harmony with the world and with other
people. Although some say it can be mildly hal
lucinogenic, Ecstasy supposedly has few of the bad
side effects of LSD or psyilocibin hallucinogens.
Authorities say that the drug — often called the
"Yuppie way of knowledge" because of the many

professionals and college students who use it — is
available in 21 states, predominantly in California,
Texas, Florida and the Northeast. An average 150-
milligram dose sells for between $8 and $20.
At Stanford, Ecstasy has become quite popular
within the last few months. Users of the drug say
they enjoy the effect of a "trip" without the side ef
fects of MDA or hallucinogens. An average
MDMA trip lasts about four hours — several hours
shorter than an MDA trip. Those who have used
both MDA and MDMA say that they are "more
relaxed" while under the influence of MDMA.
Some claim the "empathy" effect of MDMA
makes it a perfect "party drug," and often large
groups of students take it at once. They say the ab
sence of a hangover, "the jitters" and a "crash" dif
ferentiates the drug from cocaine.
Aside from its street popularity, the drug has
become increasingly popular in professional circles.
Assoc. Psychiatry Prof. David Spiegel said that
though he knew of no one at Stanford who used
MDMA for professional purposes, some colleagues
elsewhere have used the drug in counseling ses
sions.
"They claim it's an empathy drug," he said. "For
example, they would use it in a couple's counseling
sesion; they would tell a couple to come in with a
list of things they didn't like about each other, and
under the drug they would supposedly see the com
plaints in a different perspective. Their relationship
would seem more important than their problems."
Spiegel added, however, that "there are no good
controlled studies demonstrating that the drug has
this effect."
Spiegel said that MDMA's recent street

popularity is more a manifestation of "what's in
and what's out" than a sign that the drug is
relatively safe. "Look at the array of drugs that
have been popular," he said. "Everythng from bar
biturates to stimulants. It certainly isn't a result of
carefully controlled pharmacology."
Spiegel advised those who used street drugs to
remember that what people get on the street is of
ten radically different from what they think they're
getting. "For example, the heroin that is sold on the
street is often only one-tenth or one-twentieth
heroin. Many junkies die when their distributors
get a little less crooked, don't dilute the stuff so
much, and they overdose. Ethics are not a big issue
in street culture."
According to Grinspoon, the DEA ban is under
standable, in light of recent evidence. "There's an
article coming out in Science magazine next month
that says MDA in high doses causes brain damage
to rats," Grinspoon said. "Now, since we don't
know anything about the chemical effects of
MDMA, and it is a chemical cousin of MDA, that
has to be taken fairly seriously."
Grinspoon added, however: "You have to re
member two things — rats are different than
people, and the methylation process of MDMA
makes it quite a different drug than MDA."
According to Dougherty, sale of MDMA on the
streets is illegal even though it is legal to posess the
drug. "At present, most MDMA is created and dis
tributed by underground chemists," he said. "The
drug may be legal still, but it's never met with FDA
approval. Anyone who distributes or sells a non
approved drug is still subject to the constraints of
the FDA."
