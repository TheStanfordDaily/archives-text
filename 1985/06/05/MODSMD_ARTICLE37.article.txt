## A 						look at B. Gerald Cantor 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Staff writer 
The festivities at the dedication of the University's B.
Gerald Cantor Rodin Sculpture Garden Friday were in
direct contrast to the quiet, soft-spoken demeanor of B.
Gerald Cantor, the man who donated most of what is now
considered the second most important Rodin collection in
the world.
Cantor, the chairman of Cantor-Fitzgerald, a finance
company, told The Daily he has collected art "over a long
period of time and in various ways."
"I first started collecting art in 1947," he said. "I
bought a little (sculpted) hand almost six inches high. That
started me off."
All of the works Cantor has donated to the University
are from his private collection. He said he has no personal
favorites. "I can't have any favorites, because it is too dif
ficult [to choose]. If I had a favorite, why would I give it
away?" he said.
Cantor said he chose Stanford as the main beneficiary
of his collection for two reasons. "It's one of the great uni
versities in California, and it (is) fortunate enough to have
(Art Prof.) Albert Elsen along with it,"he said. "The two
together made it work."
During the ceremony, Elsen praised Cantor's "zeal to
bring the best to the most" while leading a distinctly
private life. "Mr. Cantor relishes leading a double life,"
Elsen told the crowd. "Finance is his oyster, and art the
pearl. In either life, he thinks big and is a doer."

University President Donald Kennedy echoed Elsen's
sentiments, praising Cantor's "extraordinary generosity
that has brought us to the point of completion of this gar
den and the splendid sculpture it will hold."
During his brief speech at the dedication, Cantor told
why he and his wife Iris wanted to make their collection
accessible to the public.

Cantor 'relishes leading a
double life. Finance is his
oyster, and art the pearl. In
either life, he thinks big and
is a doer.'

"Iris and I have always been aware of the meaningful
art that Rodin has provided to people of all ages and
backgrounds," he said. "We both take pride and pleasure
in the fact that this new garden will serve not just the
Stanford community, but everyone in the Bay Area and
people who visit this campus from all over the world."
