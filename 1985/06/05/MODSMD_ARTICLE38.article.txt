# Council grants sophomore a continuance
## 
### PETER HAVEN Staff writer 
A Stanford student arrested and charged with
driving under the influence of alcohol came
before ihe Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
Monday evening in the Cypress North Lounge,
where his motion for a continuance of the
hearing was granted.
Joe Anderson, a sophomore majoring in poli
tical science, told the faculty co-chair of the
SJC, Miguel Mendez, that the University had
not given him sufficient advance notice of his
hearing date.
In April, Anderson was arrested for driving
under the influence of alcohol and failing to
report damaged property after he allegedly
backed his silver BMW into some parked
bicycles in front of Florence Moore Hall.
An unidentified witness at the time reported
that Anderson left the scene without reporting
the accident and drove to the back of the Delta
Upsilon fraternity house. Police said they later
apprehended Anderson at the DU house and
gave him a breathalyzer test, which showed An
derson to be above the 0.1 percent blood
alcohol level.
He was taken to the North County Jail and
booked on charges of driving under the influ
ence and failing to report damaged property.
At Monday's hearing, Anderson, citing sec
tion 1, paragraph 1 of the Calendar of Proceed
ings of the SJC, told the council he should have
been notified of the date of his hearing at least
five days in advance.
Anderson said he was not informed of Mon
day's 7:30 p.m. hearing until Friday, May 31,
when he received a phone call at 9:45 p.m. from

Sally Cole, the University's judicial affairs offi
cer. Anderson said Cole told him thai notifica
tion of the hearing had been mailed on May 29.
On Monday, Anderson said he had not yet
received this notice.
After Anderson made his motion for a con
tinuance, Mendez called for a closed-door
meeting of the SJC, and he asked all those pres
ent — Anderson, Cole, University Bursar Jon
Erickson (Anderson's adviser), University Asst.
Staff Counsel Jennifer Westerlind and ap
proximately a dozen spectators — to leave the
room.
After this session, Mendez informed Ander
son, who had earlier waived his right to a non
public hearing, that another hearing would be
rescheduled at a "convenient date" sometime
after the end of the spring quarter.
Before learning of the SJC decision, Ander
son had said he felt the University "was trying
to railroad this through" by scheduling the
hearing for Monday.
In addition to his claim that he was given
short notice for his hearing, Anderson also told
the council that the report made by the SJC
hearing officer, Palo Alto attorney Steve Ten
nis, was "full of obvious errors" and the Univer
sity acted improperly by notifying Anderson to
appear at the hearing without first receiving
Tennis' report.
Monday, after Mendez's announcement of a
continuance, Anderson appealed to the council
to review the tapes of his May 28 meeting with
Tennis.
"I would like to enter an objection to the
report of the hearing officer," Anderson said. "I
find it to be fallacious, and if testimony is to be

. . . reviewed from the tapes made of the
hearing,... I believe that objective opinion will
agree that the way it (the testimony) is pre
sented is fallacious."
Mendez told Anderson that his appeal should
be brought up at the next hearing.
After the hearing, Anderson said the date of
notification of Monday's hearing should have
been contingent upon the day the SJC received
Tennis' report. He said members of the SJC are
not supposed to notify the defendant until they
have seen the hearing officers report.
Tennis' report was dated May 31, three days
after the meeting, Anderson said. The SJC
notice, therefore, should not have been sent any
earlier than May 31, according to Anderson.
"In order to have had five days notice for a
meeting [Monday], it would have had to
have been mailed by the 29th of May," Ander
son said of the SJC's notice of Monday's
hearing. "But of course, it is impossible to mail
something on the 29th of May if you have to
wait for the receipt of a document that is going
to be dated the 31st of May."
Cole declined to respond to Anderson's state
ment, saying she would not comment on the
case until after the next hearing.
Anderson requested the continuance because
his attorney is out of town and will not be back
for several weeks.
Anderson, who has been admitted to the
Stanford Overseas Program in Oxford for fall
quarter, said Cole urged him during her phone
call to hold the hearing on Monday, rather than
request a continuance.
"She said we should finish the case tonight

(Monday), even though the notification was im
proper; even though my counsel is not here;
even though I have not had nearly enough time
to prepare a defense, nor have I been allowed to
listen to the testimony on the tapes from the
hearing officer, which I am contesting.
"She said the reason for that was because if it
was not completed by this quarter, she would put
a hold on my PTR that would not permit me to
attend Oxford in the fall," he said.
Anderson, who may also be prosecuted in
the California court system for the April inci
dent, faces possible suspension or expulsion for
a violation of the University's Fundamental
Standard. ~

The purpose of the SJC hearing, Anderson
said, is to decide if the council thinks Anderson
did violate the Fundamental Standard and, if so,
to recommend a proper penalty to the president
of the University, who will make the final deci
sion.
"What the facts are of what happened and
what the facts of the case are are two different
things." Anderson said. "I did not damage any
bicycles, there was no traffic accident .. . and I
was not driving while under the influence of al
cohol," he said.
"In fact, the breathalyzer test happened . . .
82 minutes after I was last seen driving a car,
and my alcohol level in my blood was still on the
upswing from drinking that did not happen
before or during the driving. The facts are that I
am not guilty."
Anderson declined to elaborate any further,
saying he had been advised by his attorney not
to bring up any evidence that should be brought
up only in court.
