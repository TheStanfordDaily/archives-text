# Panel eyes costs to divest
## 
### ALLISON HARTWELL Staff writer 
Stanford could lose up to $14 million in transaction
costs if the University decides to divest of its stock in com
panies that do business in South Africa, the authors of a
Stanford study on the financial tradeoffs of divestment
said Monday.
The "biggest cost" of divestment is making the switch
to a South Africa-free portfolio, according to Blake Gross
man, a co-terminal student in economics who co
authored the study. He added that the $14 million amount
was "a little high" and that the cost could be reduced
through an "intelligent divestment strategy."
In a forum held Monday at Stanford Business School on
the ramifications of divestment, Grossman was joined by
William Sharpe, a professor of finance at the business
school and co-author of the study. Representatives from
the nation's financial community also participated in the
discussion.
According to Sharpe, transaction costs can range from
0.6 to 2.8 percent of the total investment portfolio,
depending on the amount invested. The University's in
vestments total an estimated $1 billion, and approxi
mately 1.4 percent of that could potentially be lost to
transaction costs, the study said.
But the preliminary findings show that companies not
doing business in South Africa historically perform as well
— and in some cases better — than those that do, Sharpe
said.
The performance of these companies can be partly at
tributed to the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar
and foreign trade conditions. Still, there is no dismissing

the fact that non-South Africa related investments "have
done better," Sharpe said.
"These horror stories you hear out there about getting
much fewer returns (on South African-free investments)
are unfounded," Grossman said after the forum.
Joining the forum was Patricia Dunn, vice president of
Wells Fargo Investment Advisors, who elaborated on the
transaction costs of divestment.
The most important consideration of such sales is the
price impact that trading will have on the market, Dunn
said. As demand for the stock goes down due to increased
sales, transaction costs go up dramatically as investors are
forced to take losses in stock prices. Gradual divestment
would be less costly because it would promote a "more
natural" atmosphere of trading without causing alarm, she
added.
The University could save a "substantial amount" of
transaction costs by "veiling" the stock sales of companies
doing business in South Africa as non-divestment related,
Dunn said.
Dewitt Bowman, chief investment officer of the San
Francisco Retirement Pension Fund, spoke on his organi
zation's total divestiture from companies doing business in
South Africa, initiated May 1. He said he hasn't received
any feedback from the companies from which the pension
fund has divested, but added that he has attempted to
keep all transactions "blind."
Bowman estimated that his organization has divested
from one-fourth to one-third of the $365 million it had in
vested in companies doing business in South Africa. He
said the implementation of divestiture was not the difficult
process, but that it was "difficult to predict the net effect"
of the pension fund's actions.
