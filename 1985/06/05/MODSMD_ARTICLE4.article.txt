### MARY YUH Editorial staff 
Seven of the nine students arrested last
Tuesday for civil disobedience at Old Union
were released on bail Friday night. The other
two, Joseph Mosnier and Todd Ramming,
were released last Wednesday on their own
recognizance after identifying themselves at a
county court hearing in San Jose.
The charges against the nine protesters are
trespassing and remaining in an unlawful as
sembly; both are misdemeanors. Although all
nine were booked for resisting arrest, none
was charged with that misdemeanor.
The seven, sophomores Michael Tarpey
and Wiliiam Northway. junior Mario Huerta,
seniors Jennifer Grace Grant, Caroline Paul

and David Romo and graduate student
David Magnus, had been told that if they
identified themselves, they would be released
the same day, according to Paul. At Friday's
ctfurt appearance in Palo Alto, they gave their
names to the judge, expecting to be released,
she said.
But Judge Edward Scoyen said at Friday's
court hearing that he had to check the records
and verify all the identities of the students
before he could release them, and that they
would be released Monday at the earliest.
When lawyer John Balliet objected, citing
the release of Mosnier and Ramming on the
same day they identified themselves, Scoyen
replied. "That's San Jose — this is not."
Friends of the protesters raised the $150-

per-person bail that had been set earlier by
the county sheriff, Paul said. Because bail
already had been set, the judge was obliged to
release them on bail, according to Paul. The
five men were released from Palo Alto Jail
and the two women from Elmwood Women's
Jail.
At Monday's court hearing, the seven were
taken off supervised OR, a strict term of
release, Paul said. Although the seven did not
go through the process necessary for release
under supervised OR (Own Recognizance)
because they were released on bail, Scoyen
had officially put them on supervised OR. ac
cording to Paul.
Also at the hearing, the pre-trial date for
the seven was set for next Thursday, Magnus

said. The pre-trial hearing for Mosnier and
Ramming is tomorrow.
The legal representatives for all the stu
dents have not yet been determined, although
most are expected to come from the Public
Defender's Office, Magnus said.
The three students who are not financially
eligible for a public defender must obtain
their own lawyers, said Paul.
According to University officials, the Uni
versity is not planning to press charges against
the students or to request that the charges be
dropped, because the case is now in the hands
of the Sheriff s Office.
"University policy is not to involve itself in
police matters. . . . [The University] simply
maintains a neutral stance," said Jennifer

Westerlind, the University's assistant staff
counsel.
"Once the sheriff has taken an action, it's in
the jurisdiction of the county. Ultimately, the
judge or jury makes the decision," said Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons. "It's inap
propriate to seek differential treatment for
students merely for being students."
Romo said he plans to subpoena University
President Donald Kennedy because Romo
feels there is "a direct link between Ken
nedy's decision to profit from apartheid and
my decision to oppose the University."
Romo said he plans to use the argument of
moral necessity in his defense, saying that the
breaking of minor laws is justified when done
for the sake of higher moral principles.
