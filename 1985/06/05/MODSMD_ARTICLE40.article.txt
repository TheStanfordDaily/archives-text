After repeated pleas for mercy and
a last-ditch $1,000 reward offer from
The Chaparral, an 80-year-old sledge
hammer stolen from the humor mag
azine in January has been returned.
"Yeah, the hammer's been
returned, but 1 can't tell you much
about it," said Mike Collins, a
Chaparral staffer. Collins said Vinnie
Freda, the Chaparral alumnus who
offered the reward, could have more
information on the hammer's return.
However, when The Daily contacted
Freda, he said he had no knowledge

of the hammer's status.
The silver-trimmed hammer, which
is inscribed with names of former
members of the Hammer and Coffin
Society, the group which publishes
The Chaparral, was first found mis

January.
Chaparral staff members have
accused senior Shirish Date, a former
Daily editor, of stealing the hammer.
Date has denied the accusation.
Stanford police said yesterday that
they were never called for assistance
in the case.
