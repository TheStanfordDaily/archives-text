# Student intercepts Soviet TV

In the brush beyond Governor's Corner, in a
weather-worn trailer that is home to the Stanford Ham
Radio Club, graduate student Stuart Neubarth is
watching a Soviet rocket blast into orbit.
To Neubarth, viewing Soviet missile tests, military
parades and folk dancing is becoming a daily occur
rence. The president of the radio club since 1979,
Neubarth recently devised a satellite-receiving system
that allows him to intercept Soviet television broad
casts.
"It's been a technological challenge that I hope will
be useful to other people," Neubarth says of the
pioneering effort, which recently earned him a $20,000
grant from the School of Humanities and Sciences and
could eventually provide a Soviet channel for SUNet,
the Stanford cable television system.
Neubarth. a co-terminal student in electrical engi
neering, began to lay the foundation for his satellite
receiving system when he entered Stanford in 1978. A
freshman in Serra House, he built a receiver to decode
Home Box Office broadcasts for the dorm TV set. "At
that time, HBO was the only (broadcasting) company
to use satellites," he says.
But intercepting Soviet television broadcasts was
more difficult. U.S. communications satellites are
routinely placed in geostationary orbits — high above
the equator. In contrast, Soviet satellites are positioned
in elliptical orbits that carry them over the North Pole.
"The northern regions of Siberia are too far north to
receive geostationary orbit satellites," Neubarth says.

"Satellites in elliptical orbits can see the whole North
ern Hemisphere. This makes it possible for us to pick
up Soviet broadcasts." For their own part, U.S.
satellites in geostationary orbits arc invisible to Soviet
earth receivers.
In the spring of six months alter learning of
the possibility of picking up Soviet satellite broadcasts
in the United States, Neubarth rigged up a prototype
receiver on the roof of the Durand Engineering Build
ing. With the help of equipment donated by several
local electronics companies — including a 16-foot
parabolic dish — Stanford began to receive Soviet TV.
Since then, Neubarth has developed the technology to
the point where he expects "broadcast quality" in the
near future.
Neubarth's insight into Soviet television was en
hanced by a trip on the Trans-Siberian Railroad last
year. As the train neared the Soviet city of Irkutsk,
Neubarth spotted a satellite-tracking dish.
"I headed across the country, toward the dish," he
says."The gate was open. The door was open. 1 walked
inside, and the operator was snoring loudly. I asked
him if 1 could look around, and he let me take pictures.
Spurred on by what he had seen in Irkutsk,
Neubarth returned to Stanford, where he contacted
Prof. Riehard Schupbach, chairman of the Department
of Slavic Languages and Literature. "Together, it was
deeided that Stanford definitely wanted a receiver for
Soviet TV on campus," Neubarth said.
Neubarth's company, Serra Systems, Inc., is plan
ning to market the technologies that constitute the
satellite-receiving system.
