OMAHA, Neb. — Stanford's
chances of winning the College World
Series are uncertain at best, but one
thing is for sure: the Cardinal won't
lose two games back-to-back this
year.
After suffering its worst loss of the
season Saturday, a 17-3 pounding by
Miami. Fla., Stanford came back the
next day to eliminate Arizona, 9-2.
The win was the Cardinal's fifth
against the Wildcats and 47th of the
year overall.
Although Stanford is still alive in
the Series, the Cardinal has a long
way to go if it wants to claim the na
tional championship.

Stanford must win four more
games to win the Scricv The first of
those contests is this afternoon
against Arkansas.
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
was pleased by the way his team
responded to Saturday's embarrass
ing loss. "I felt that we could come
back and play hard," he said.
"Believe it or not, I think we were
looser tonight. I was probably the one
who was a little more uptight."
Familiarity with the opponent had
something to do with the team's con
fidence. "We knew that if we played
our game the way we're capable, we
would beat them," said Rick
Lundblade, who was 2-for-2 with two
runs scored and an RBI.
"It helps to know their players,
what they can and can't do." winning
pitcher Jack McDowell said.
McDowell's performance — allow
ing nine hits and two walks with five
strikeouts — was one of his most im
pressive of the year. "1 had it all

tonight," he said. "I had a really good
forkball."
"He has good stuff, that young
man," Arizona Coach Jerry Kindall
said. "He's blossoming into a very
fine pitcher."
Wildcat starter David Carley was
pretty fine himself in the early going.
The sophomore right-hander held the
Cardinal hitless through the first
three innings, but Stanford finally got
to him in the fourth.
With one out, Lundblade singled to
center and stole second. After Mike
Deßenon struck out. Walt Harris
delivered a solid single to right
center. Center fielder Chuck Johnson
made a strong throw to the plate, but
Lundblade was able to avoid the tag
of catcher David Taylor to score the
game's first run.
A four-run Cardinal uprising in the
fifth gave McDowell all the runs he
would need. After John Verducci
walked, Pete Stanicek poked a
textbook hit-and-run single to right.

Lundblade hit what looked to be a
grand-slam, but the wind turned it
into a sacrifice fly. Deßenon's infield
single reloaded the bases. Then, on a
1-2 piteh, Harris lined a two-run
single past a diving Todd Trafton at
first, giving Stanford a 5-0 lead.
Harris' two clutch hits were a
welcome sign for the rest of the Se
ries. "A big part of our game is get
ting the big hit with two outs," he
said.
"We had to get the big hits tonight,
and we did." Marquess said.
Stanford scored four more in the
eighth, ending, for now at least, its
recent batting slump. Before Sunday,
the Cardinal had had only 19 hits in
its last three games.
With runners on second and third
and two outs, Kindall decided to walk
Lundblade intentionally. Like the

si miliar choice made by Nebraska's
John Sanders at the West I Regional,
Kindall's decision backfired.
On a 2-1 changeup from reliever
Joe Esles, Deßenon nailed a line
drive to left that no wind could have
kept in the ballpark. The grand-slam,
the fourth of Deßenon's career,
assured the Cardinal of at least one
more game this season.
Still. Kindall defended his decision.
" The grand-slam just slammed the
door on us, but Lundblade has killed
us all year," he said. "I would do it
again. The strategy was sound, but

the execution was poor."
"I've been doing really well when
they walk Rick.'" Deßenon said. "It
really pumps me up."
Marquess thought that coming
back after a blowout would be easier
than after a close game, but Kindall
refused to use his team's 2-1 loss Sat
urday to Texas as an excuse. "We
were ready," he said. "It was
McDowell who made it hard on us."
