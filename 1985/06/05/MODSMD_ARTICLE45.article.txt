# Card faces Hogs after splitting two
## Ousts Arizona after trouncing by Miami 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
OMAHA, Neb. — Stanford's
chances of winning the College World
Series are uncertain at best, but one
thing is for sure: the Cardinal won't
lose two games back-to-back this
year.
After suffering its worst loss of the
season Saturday, a 17-3 pounding by
Miami. Fla., Stanford came back the
next day to eliminate Arizona, 9-2.
The win was the Cardinal's fifth
against the Wildcats and 47th of the
year overall.
Although Stanford is still alive in
the Series, the Cardinal has a long
way to go if it wants to claim the na
tional championship.

Stanford must win four more
games to win the Scricv The first of
those contests is this afternoon
against Arkansas.
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
was pleased by the way his team
responded to Saturday's embarrass
ing loss. "I felt that we could come
back and play hard," he said.
"Believe it or not, I think we were
looser tonight. I was probably the one
who was a little more uptight."
Familiarity with the opponent had
something to do with the team's con
fidence. "We knew that if we played
our game the way we're capable, we
would beat them," said Rick
Lundblade, who was 2-for-2 with two
runs scored and an RBI.
"It helps to know their players,
what they can and can't do." winning
pitcher Jack McDowell said.
McDowell's performance — allow
ing nine hits and two walks with five
strikeouts — was one of his most im
pressive of the year. "1 had it all

tonight," he said. "I had a really good
forkball."
"He has good stuff, that young
man," Arizona Coach Jerry Kindall
said. "He's blossoming into a very
fine pitcher."
Wildcat starter David Carley was
pretty fine himself in the early going.
The sophomore right-hander held the
Cardinal hitless through the first
three innings, but Stanford finally got
to him in the fourth.
With one out, Lundblade singled to
center and stole second. After Mike
Deßenon struck out. Walt Harris
delivered a solid single to right
center. Center fielder Chuck Johnson
made a strong throw to the plate, but
Lundblade was able to avoid the tag
of catcher David Taylor to score the
game's first run.
A four-run Cardinal uprising in the
fifth gave McDowell all the runs he
would need. After John Verducci
walked, Pete Stanicek poked a
textbook hit-and-run single to right.

Onvis broueht in one nitl, •nirrmrtn
ning Jim McDonald from the Arizona

Lundblade hit what looked to be a
grand-slam, but the wind turned it
into a sacrifice fly. Deßenon's infield
single reloaded the bases. Then, on a
1-2 piteh, Harris lined a two-run
single past a diving Todd Trafton at
first, giving Stanford a 5-0 lead.
Harris' two clutch hits were a
welcome sign for the rest of the Se
ries. "A big part of our game is get
ting the big hit with two outs," he
said.
"We had to get the big hits tonight,
and we did." Marquess said.
Stanford scored four more in the
eighth, ending, for now at least, its
recent batting slump. Before Sunday,
the Cardinal had had only 19 hits in
its last three games.
With runners on second and third
and two outs, Kindall decided to walk
Lundblade intentionally. Like the

si miliar choice made by Nebraska's
John Sanders at the West I Regional,
Kindall's decision backfired.
On a 2-1 changeup from reliever
Joe Esles, Deßenon nailed a line
drive to left that no wind could have
kept in the ballpark. The grand-slam,
the fourth of Deßenon's career,
assured the Cardinal of at least one
more game this season.
Still. Kindall defended his decision.
" The grand-slam just slammed the
door on us, but Lundblade has killed
us all year," he said. "I would do it
again. The strategy was sound, but

the execution was poor."
"I've been doing really well when
they walk Rick.'" Deßenon said. "It
really pumps me up."
Marquess thought that coming
back after a blowout would be easier
than after a close game, but Kindall
refused to use his team's 2-1 loss Sat
urday to Texas as an excuse. "We
were ready," he said. "It was
McDowell who made it hard on us."

Miami, Fla.. but no one told the Cardinal about
the Hurricanes that would engulf it in the
remaining innings.
Miami set a College World Series record with
five home runs as the Hurricanes stormed to a
17-3 win. Leading Miami's assault were
Rusty Deßold and Greg Ellena. who both hit
two homers.
Deßold, 4-for-4 on the day, tied a Series
record with 11 total bases. "1 saw the ball real
well and didn't overswing," he said.
Ellena has now hit 13 homers in only 96 at
bats this year. Still, Miami Coach Ron Fraser
did not put him in the lineup until just before
game time. "I looked pretty smart, didn't I?"
Fraser said.
Ellena began the year as the Hurricanes' bul
lpen catcher, but got a chance to play when des
ignated hitter Frank Dominguez went into a
midseason slump.
"Our DH was struggling a little, so I thought
I'd shake him up by putting Ellena in," Fraser
said. "His first time up, he hit one out. Fans
started yelling at me, 'Fraser, why haven't you
been playing him?' "
Ellena was wondering why as well. Fraser is
"the wizard of college baseball," Ellena said.
"But I knew I could hit."
Even a 17-3 game can have a pivotal play,
and this one did. After Deßold's first homer
wiped out a 1-0 Stanford lead in the third, the
Cardinal put men on first and second with one
out in the fourth.
John Ramos lined a single to left, and third
base coach Dean Stotz waved Harris home from
second. Mike Fiore threw all the way to the
plate on the fly, but Harris, according to ESPN
replays, appeared to evade the tag of catcher
Julio Solis.
However, umpire Gus Steiner signaled out,
and Stanford came up empty. "That's the big
play of the game," Marquess said. "If we had
scored there, it would have been 2-1 and we
would've had runners on second and third."
Deßold's second long ball of the day put
Miami ahead 4-1 in the fourth. Both his homers
were wind-aided shots to the opposite field. Of
the second home run, he said, "I thought it was

a sacrifice fly, but I'm glad it decided to go out."
Ellena's towering shot to lett in the fifth had
no choice but to go out. The two-run blast gave
the Hurricanes a 7-1 lead and sent starter Jeff
Ballard to the dugout. Ballard was definitely
feeling the effect of his third start in nine days.
"1 haven't pitched that much in nine days this
year, but during the week, I thought 1 was
ready." he said. "My breaking ball was lazy, and
they hit my mistakes."
The onslaught continued against four
relievers. After the Cardinal had narrowed the
gap to 7-3 in the top of the sixth, the Hurricanes
put the game away with five in the bottom of the
inning.
The key blow was a tremendous three-run

homer to center by Ellena off Kevin Kunkel
that made the score 12-3.
Miami reached Ugo Collela and David Harris
for five more in the eighth. This time, it was first
baseman Chris Hart who provided the long ball,
although his three-run, wind-blown flyball to
right was similiar to Ellena's blast only on the
scoreboard.
"I think we got a real good whipping. They
outplayed us in every aspect of the game,"
Marquess said. "They put on an awesome of
fensive display. We got the ball up to them, and
they jumped on it."
"We got some breaks and got out on top of
them early," Fraser said. "They couldn't play
their game."

Miami, Fla.. but no one told the Cardinal about
the Hurricanes that would engulf it in the
remaining innings.
Miami set a College World Series record with
five home runs as the Hurricanes stormed to a
17-3 win. Leading Miami's assault were
Rusty Deßold and Greg Ellena. who both hit
two homers.
Deßold, 4-for-4 on the day, tied a Series
record with 11 total bases. "1 saw the ball real
well and didn't overswing," he said.
Ellena has now hit 13 homers in only 96 at
bats this year. Still, Miami Coach Ron Fraser
did not put him in the lineup until just before
game time. "I looked pretty smart, didn't I?"
Fraser said.
Ellena began the year as the Hurricanes' bul
lpen catcher, but got a chance to play when des
ignated hitter Frank Dominguez went into a
midseason slump.
"Our DH was struggling a little, so I thought
I'd shake him up by putting Ellena in," Fraser
said. "His first time up, he hit one out. Fans
started yelling at me, 'Fraser, why haven't you
been playing him?' "
Ellena was wondering why as well. Fraser is
"the wizard of college baseball," Ellena said.
"But I knew I could hit."
Even a 17-3 game can have a pivotal play,
and this one did. After Deßold's first homer
wiped out a 1-0 Stanford lead in the third, the
Cardinal put men on first and second with one
out in the fourth.
John Ramos lined a single to left, and third
base coach Dean Stotz waved Harris home from
second. Mike Fiore threw all the way to the
plate on the fly, but Harris, according to ESPN
replays, appeared to evade the tag of catcher
Julio Solis.
However, umpire Gus Steiner signaled out,
and Stanford came up empty. "That's the big
play of the game," Marquess said. "If we had
scored there, it would have been 2-1 and we
would've had runners on second and third."
Deßold's second long ball of the day put
Miami ahead 4-1 in the fourth. Both his homers
were wind-aided shots to the opposite field. Of
the second home run, he said, "I thought it was

a sacrifice fly, but I'm glad it decided to go out."
Ellena's towering shot to lett in the fifth had
no choice but to go out. The two-run blast gave
the Hurricanes a 7-1 lead and sent starter Jeff
Ballard to the dugout. Ballard was definitely
feeling the effect of his third start in nine days.
"1 haven't pitched that much in nine days this
year, but during the week, I thought 1 was
ready." he said. "My breaking ball was lazy, and
they hit my mistakes."
The onslaught continued against four
relievers. After the Cardinal had narrowed the
gap to 7-3 in the top of the sixth, the Hurricanes
put the game away with five in the bottom of the
inning.
The key blow was a tremendous three-run

homer to center by Ellena off Kevin Kunkel
that made the score 12-3.
Miami reached Ugo Collela and David Harris
for five more in the eighth. This time, it was first
baseman Chris Hart who provided the long ball,
although his three-run, wind-blown flyball to
right was similiar to Ellena's blast only on the
scoreboard.
"I think we got a real good whipping. They
outplayed us in every aspect of the game,"
Marquess said. "They put on an awesome of
fensive display. We got the ball up to them, and
they jumped on it."
"We got some breaks and got out on top of
them early," Fraser said. "They couldn't play
their game."

Rick Lundblade steals second base in the fourth inning of Sunday night's win over the
Wildcats.
OMAHA, Neb. — Stanford's
chances of winning the College World
Series are uncertain at best, but one
thing is for sure: the Cardinal won't
lose two games back-to-back this
year.
After suffering its worst loss of the
season Saturday, a 17-3 pounding by
Miami. Fla., Stanford came back the
next day to eliminate Arizona, 9-2.
The win was the Cardinal's fifth
against the Wildcats and 47th of the
year overall.
Although Stanford is still alive in
the Series, the Cardinal has a long
way to go if it wants to claim the na
tional championship.

Stanford must win four more
games to win the Scricv The first of
those contests is this afternoon
against Arkansas.
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
was pleased by the way his team
responded to Saturday's embarrass
ing loss. "I felt that we could come
back and play hard," he said.
"Believe it or not, I think we were
looser tonight. I was probably the one
who was a little more uptight."
Familiarity with the opponent had
something to do with the team's con
fidence. "We knew that if we played
our game the way we're capable, we
would beat them," said Rick
Lundblade, who was 2-for-2 with two
runs scored and an RBI.
"It helps to know their players,
what they can and can't do." winning
pitcher Jack McDowell said.
McDowell's performance — allow
ing nine hits and two walks with five
strikeouts — was one of his most im
pressive of the year. "1 had it all

tonight," he said. "I had a really good
forkball."
"He has good stuff, that young
man," Arizona Coach Jerry Kindall
said. "He's blossoming into a very
fine pitcher."
Wildcat starter David Carley was
pretty fine himself in the early going.
The sophomore right-hander held the
Cardinal hitless through the first
three innings, but Stanford finally got
to him in the fourth.
With one out, Lundblade singled to
center and stole second. After Mike
Deßenon struck out. Walt Harris
delivered a solid single to right
center. Center fielder Chuck Johnson
made a strong throw to the plate, but
Lundblade was able to avoid the tag
of catcher David Taylor to score the
game's first run.
A four-run Cardinal uprising in the
fifth gave McDowell all the runs he
would need. After John Verducci
walked, Pete Stanicek poked a
textbook hit-and-run single to right.
Walks to Ruben Amaro and Mark
Onvis broueht in one nitl, •nirrmrtn
ning Jim McDonald from the Arizona

Lundblade hit what looked to be a
grand-slam, but the wind turned it
into a sacrifice fly. Deßenon's infield
single reloaded the bases. Then, on a
1-2 piteh, Harris lined a two-run
single past a diving Todd Trafton at
first, giving Stanford a 5-0 lead.
Harris' two clutch hits were a
welcome sign for the rest of the Se
ries. "A big part of our game is get
ting the big hit with two outs," he
said.
"We had to get the big hits tonight,
and we did." Marquess said.
Stanford scored four more in the
eighth, ending, for now at least, its
recent batting slump. Before Sunday,
the Cardinal had had only 19 hits in
its last three games.
With runners on second and third
and two outs, Kindall decided to walk
Lundblade intentionally. Like the

si miliar choice made by Nebraska's
John Sanders at the West I Regional,
Kindall's decision backfired.
On a 2-1 changeup from reliever
Joe Esles, Deßenon nailed a line
drive to left that no wind could have
kept in the ballpark. The grand-slam,
the fourth of Deßenon's career,
assured the Cardinal of at least one
more game this season.
Still. Kindall defended his decision.
" The grand-slam just slammed the

relievers. After the Cardinal had narrowed the
gap to 7-3 in the top of the sixth, the Hurricanes
put the game away with five in the bottom of the
inning.
The key blow was a tremendous three-run

homer to center by Ellena off Kevin Kunkel
that made the score 12-3.
Miami reached Ugo Collela and David Harris
for five more in the eighth. This time, it was first
baseman Chris Hart who provided the long ball,
although his three-run, wind-blown flyball to
right was similiar to Ellena's blast only on the
scoreboard.
"I think we got a real good whipping. They
outplayed us in every aspect of the game,"
Marquess said. "They put on an awesome of
fensive display. We got the ball up to them, and
they jumped on it."
"We got some breaks and got out on top of
them early," Fraser said. "They couldn't play
their game."
