# A 						must-win game for both ballclubs
## 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
OMAHA, Neb. — After his team
eliminated Arizona on Sunday, 9-2,
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess said,
"Arizona was in a tough situation.
They played a tough, emotional game
against Texas and had to come back
and play the next day."
Today, Stanford will once again be
facing a team coming off a hard
fought loss. This time, the team will
be Arkansas, which dropped a 5-4
decision to Mississippi State last
night.
However, the Cardinal should have
a much tougher time with the Razor
backs than it did with the Wildcats.
Arkansas, ranked fourth in the final
national poll, had a 17-game winning
streak snapped by MSU.
Because of that streak. Marquess
picked the Razorbacks as the tourna
ment favorite. "They're the hottest
club right now," he said.
Included in Arkansas tear were
two wins over No. 3 Texas and a 16-2
thrashing of MSU.
The Razorbacks managed only one
run in 14 innings against South
Carolina on Friday, but eight of those
innings were against Ail-
American Mike Cook. On Monday,
Arkansas faced another Ail-
American, MSU's Jeff Brantley, but
was able to collect 11 hits.
Marquess knows that Arkansas will
present problems for his pitching
staff. Texas Coach Cliff Gustafson
"told me that they can really swing
the bats," he said. "So we know they
can hit."
First baseman Dave Patterson
leads the Razorbacks with a .372
average. He is followed by two third
team Ail-Americans, center fielder
Mike Loggins (.354, 10 HRs) and
third baseman Jeff King (.353, 16
HRs, 80 RBIs). As a team, Arkansas
is hitting .322.
Fred Farwell (11-2, 3.08 ERA) is
the ace of the Arkansas starting rota

tion, but he threw almost seven in
nings against MSU and will not be
available this afternoon. The Razor
backs will likely go with right-hander
Howard Hilton (7-1, 4.88), who
threw seven shutout innings against
South Carolina.
Tim Deitz (5-1, 1.93, 12 saves),
who has already pitched seven and
two-thirds innings in the Series, may
be available for relief duty today.
For the Cardinal, it will be either
Jeff Ballard or Rob Wassenaar on the
mound. "We will have to see how the
arms feel Wednesday morning,"
Marquess said.
In other words, if Ballard is ready,
he will get the call. However, it would
be his fourth start in the last 13 days.
Therefore, if Marquess has any
doubts about the condition of the
second-team Ail-American, Was
senaar (9-3, 5.91) will pitch for Stan
ford.
Arkansas Coach Norm Deßriyn
isn't making any outlandish predic
tions about today's game. "We're
looking forward to playing," he said.
"I think we'll play well."
The road to the championship is
still a long one for Stanford, but the
Cardinal has made a believer out of
one Pacific 10 Southern Division
rival. "I think Stanford has a good
chance," Arizona Coach Jerry Kin
dall said. "Stanford is alive and well."
Card notes
Rick Lundblade and Pete Stanicek
joined Ballard on the All-American
second team. Stanford was the only
school to have three players named to
the three teams. No other Six-Pac
players were chosen.
The crowd at Rosenblatt Stadium
can be cruel. Just ask the girl who
retrieves the foul balls as they roll off
the screen behind home plate. When
she misses one, she is nearly booed
out of the ballpark.
