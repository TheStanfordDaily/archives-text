# Stanford track excels at NCAAs

Although the Stanford men's and women's
track teams did not crack the top 20 in the over
all NCAA standings at Austin. Texas, several
Cardinal individual performers managed to
record top-10 placings.
Out of the 10 athletes that Stanford sent to
the NCAAs, five finished in the top eight in the
country, earning AIl-American status.
Heading the pack for both squads were the
field event athletes, who claimed three of the
All-American slots.
Junior discus thrower Karen Nicker son
turned in the Cardinal's best Imish, placing third
with a personal best throw ol 180.5 feet, eclips
ing her former top throw by more than two feet.
"It might have been the best throw of her
life," said Stanford Asst. Coach Dave Wollman.
who added that Nickerson's throw was against a
stubborn wind. "It got the monkey off her back.
She really performed well."
Stanford shotputter Pam Dukes, meanwhile,
did not have the same type ot consistent perfor
mance. but she nonetheless secured .i top-eight
ranking with her last throw, which her
from 12th to seventh place.
For the Cardinal men. senior Brian Master
son continued his rapid improvement, nailing
down a fourth-place finish in the hammer event.
Masterson started throwing the hammer in hi>
freshman year at Stanford, and in this season
alone, he has improved by an ama/ing 35 feet.
Wollman said
Masterson's strong showing was even niori
impressive considering thai he did not even
made the initial team flight because ot ;i flu and
had tit fly down a day later.
Sean Pickering, the other Cardinal men's
hammer thrower, just missed claiming AIl-
American honors, finishing ninth. According to
Wollman. Pickering's b.uk injuries throughout
the season hampered his ability to train .ind
practice hard.

The Cardinal's other two AIl-American per
formances came in the same event â€” the 1,500
meters.
After having recorded the fastest time in the
qualifying heats, Stanford's Rcgina Jacobs
looked as though she was well on her way to a
top finish in the finals.
Unfortunately, no one counts the qualifying
rounds. In the finals, Jacobs held the lead for a
good stretch of the race, but was later passed by
five others, eventually coming home in the sixth
position.
"Talent-wise, I think she's the best in the
country,'" Wollman said. "She just didn't quite
get it done. You can't be unhappy, though, with
becoming an AIl-American."
One Cardinal athlete who had to be happy
was Jeff Atkinson, who became the first Stan
ford men's distance runner since 1969 to
receive AIl-American honors. Wollman said
that Atkinson was a walk-on who simply
"continued to get better" with each track
season.
Cardinal high jumpers Lisa Bernhagen and
Brian Marshall, according to Wollman, per
formed well in the qualifying competition but
"never got into a good rhythm" in the finals.
Bernhagen bowed out early, missing three
times at 5'10". and Marshall could not clear
7' 1" in his three attempts.
While Wollman was pleased with the NCAA
results, he was also enthusiatic about this year's
track recruiting, which landed several high
caliber athletes, especially in the field events.
Pn>m Washington, the Stanford women's
team obtained .i javelin thrower whose top state
toss would have been good enough to garner a
tirst ,it the NC'AAs. The women's team also ac
quired a top-flight discus thrower and a shot
putter.
I he Stanford men's team picked up two
highk touted ;md much-needed sprinters from
New Nork. Moreover, the team will be
bolstered bv the addition of an excellent dccath
lete from Idaho
