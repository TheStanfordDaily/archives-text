# Econ prof. to analyze owners' books
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN Editorial staff 
Baseball fans who took "Economics of Public
Policy" from Stanford Prof. Roger Noll this winter
are probably beginning to look at their old teacher
in a new light.
Noll, who arrived at Stanford in September, has
been hired by the Major League Baseball Players
Association to analyze the financial records of the
owners of baseball's 26 teams, and the results of his
study could determine whether or not there will be
baseball in July this year.
"I don't think my role is to solve baseball's prob
lems." said Noll, who will be teaching Economics 1
this autumn. "I think my role is to establish a foun
dation on which negotiations can take place.''
Baseball's problem, in brief, is that the owners
want to impose a cap on player salaries, which have
risen by more than 600 percent since 1975. The
owners say they lost $42 million last year and
predict bankruptcy if salaries continue to rise: the
players argue that a salary cap would mean the end
of free agency .'.rid question hem much money the
owners really have lost.
I hat s where Noll comes in. Noll will spend the
next two weeks poring over the owners' financial
records, and in mid-June he will report to the
players association how much of the owners' $42
million figure is true loss and how much is only
paper-shuffling.
Me expects to find a good deal of paper-shuffling.
"Every time any sport has ever been studied, the
conclusion has always been that profits are
negative." said Noll, who received his bachelor's
degree at Cal Tech and his master's degree at Har
vard.
"Because the owners of closely held corporations
want to avoid double taxation, they tvpically
develop accounting rules that make it
so they won't show a profit," he ex
plained. "As a result, a very
profitable team ends up showing a
zero profit on the books, and a team
with a small profit ends up with a
negative figure."
Already, Noll has traced half of the
owners' estimated $42 million loss
last year to the depreciation of player

salaries, which the owners write off
on their tax returns.
If the final figure for "real loss"
that Noll comes up with is indeed that
much lower than the owners' original
statement, it could bring the two fac
tions closer together.
"It would at least narrow the range
of disagreement," he said. "When the
players come to the bargaining tables
later this month and indicate they un
derstand the owners' financial
workings, negotiations should im
prove."
