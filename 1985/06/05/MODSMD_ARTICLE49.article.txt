## Home teams, low seeds doing very well in Omaha 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
OMAHA, Neb. — Two trends are emerging here at the
College World Series.
One, it pays to be the home team.
Two, the ESPN/Collegiate Baseball pollsters may not
know what they're talking about.
In seven Series games, the home teams have won five
and outscored the visitors by a combined score of 56-30.
However, the teams that hit first are doing better than last
year, when the home teams won 14 of the 15" Series
games.
Stanford and Oklahoma State were ranked No. 1 and
No. 2, respectively, in the final national rankings, but they
lost their opening-round games by a total of 23 runs. An
unearned run was the margin of victory in No. 3 Texas' 2-
1 victory over Arizona, and No. 4 Arkansas needed 14 in
nings to subdue South Carolina. 1-0.
In the Razorbacks' win over the Gamecocks on Friday,
Arkansas' Howard Hilton dueled first-team All American
Mike Cook for seven scoreless innings. Relief ace Tim
Deitz took over for Hilton in the eighth and held South
Carolina until Fred Farwell bailed him out of trouble in
the top of the 14th.
A walk, a double by Norm Roberts and an intentional
walk loaded the bases with no outs for the Razorbacks.
Then, after failing to execute a suicide squeeze, second
baseman Keith Kerns stroked the game-winning single to
right-center.
"I knew I had to do something after the squeeze
failed," Kerns said. "I just went with the pitch."
Oklahoma State entered Friday's first-round game with
a .342 team batting average, but Mississippi State right
hander Gene Morgan held the Cowboys to three runs and
eight hits.
While Morgan was slowing down the Cowboys, his Bull
dog teammates were pounding out 12 runs and 14 hits
against six Oklahoma State pitchers.
Center fielder Dan Van Cleve and Ail-American Will
Clark paced the MSU offense with three hits each, with

Rafael Palmeiro and John Mitchell adding homers for the
Bulldogs.
The last game of the first round may also have been
most exciting. With the largest crowd of the tournament
(14,494) looking on, Texas' Greg Swindell and Arizona's
Joe Magrane hooked up in a classic pitchers' duel.
Swindell, a first-team All American, gave up only five
hits and struck out seven. Magrane, an All-Pacific 10
Southern Division choice, surrendered four hits while fan
ning eight.
The Wildcats went in front on a Gar Mill ay double in
the fourth, but the Longhorns pushed the tying run across
in the seventh with the help of two Arizona errors.
Then, in the eighth, second baseman Bill Bates drilled
an RBI double down the left-field line to give Swindell
and Texas the victory.
Oklahoma State and South Carolina was a losers' game in
every respect. The three-hour, 51-minute contest
featured five errors and 28 walks.
The Cowboys won the game. 16-11. led by Pete In
caviglia's 48th homer and outfielder Billy Smith's three
RBIs. Oklahoma State catcher Mike Day had an outing
that typified the whole contest — 1 -for-1 with four runs
scored, three RBIs and five walks.
"There's not much to say except we ran out of pitch
ing," South Carolina Coach June Raines said. "We've got
to go back to the old strike zone and get rid of the alumi
num bat if we're going to get pitching back into college
baseball."
I he most entertaining game of the tournament was the
winners' bracket game Monday night between Arkansas
and Mississippi State. In a tense, well-played contest, the
Bulldogs pulled out a 5-4 win on Clark's RBI single in the
seventh.
For the night, Clark was 3-for-4 with a home run, a
triple and tour RBIs. The homer, his 24th of the year, was
an opposite-field shot to left in the fifth.
Arkansas tagged MSU starter Jeff Brantley for 11 hits,
but could manage only four one-run innings. The Bull
dogs' All American was able to finish the game, striking
out the last two Razorbacks. The win was Brantley's 18th
of the vear.
