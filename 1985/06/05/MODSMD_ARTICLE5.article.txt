Midway through the bid evaluation
process for a five-year contract to
operate the Coffee House in Tresid
der Union, conflicting reports abound
over the status of the ASSU's pro
posal.
Daniel Rosen, night manager at the
Coffee House, said he has been told
that the ASSU will not get the con
tract. "What I've been told is that
some Coffee House people have been
informed that a decision has been
made against them." he said. Rosen
said he had been told that the original
seven bidders were narrowed down to
two finalists.
But Andrea Austin, chairwoman of
the committee charged with evaluat
ing bids, denied that any contractors
are out of the running at this point.
"We do not eliminate anybody until
the final selection. . . . Our bid
process is not necessarily based on
elimination at certain points in time."
she said.
"We have not narrowed it down to
two contractors. . . . That is an off
the-wall comment." she said.
Todd Kerr, chairman of the Coffee
House Board of Directors until last
week and co-author of the ASSU bid.
said he did not think the ASSU's bid
had been eliminated. "Never in any
formal setting have 1 heard from
Tresidder that the [Coffee House
Inc.] is not getting the bid. That's
something that has not transpired.
There's been no forma! statement at
all from Tresidder. I'm confident we
have a good shot at it." Kerr said.
The current contract for the Coffee
House ends Aue. 31, and a new con

tractor will be announced by July 1,
according to Austin.
According to Mark Thornburgh,
president of the Coffee House until
last week and a co-author of the
ASSU's bid, at an informal meet
ing student members of the Tres
idder bid team recently expressed
skepticism about the ASSU's chances
of having its contract renewed. He
refused to give specifics regarding the
meeting.
Tresidder employee Linda Crouse
cited unidentified sources within
Tresidder as saying the ASSU is "out
of the running" for a renewed con
tract.
In response to those reports. Cof
fee House employees say they are
threatening to boycott the Coffee
House if anyone other than students
operates it. The employees say they
will appeal to University President
Donald Kennedy for student owner
ship.
"If we don't get the bid, we will
stay here until Aug. 31. Then, a
boycott would go into full swing once
school started again." Rosen said.
In addition, Rosen said Coffee
House representatives hope to bring
up the matter at a previously sched
uled meeting between Kennedy and
Kerr. Rosen said 2,500 signatures
have been collected on petitions sup
porting student ownership of the Cof
fee House and said the petitions
along with a presentation emphasiz
ing the intangible benefits of student
ownership would be given to Ken
nedy at the meeting.
