# Stanford sports: a senior reminiscing
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
As any senior will attest, the past
four years of Stanford athletics have
been filled with agonies of defeat
and thrills of victory. Teams have
won and lost. Coaches have been
hired and fired. Players have been
healthy and hurt.

What's left after four years,
besides some trophies and holes in
the knees of a few uniforms, are
memories.
And there have been plenty.
Some, though, are more memorable
than others.
Remember John F.lway? The
golden boy with a golden arm. The

straight hair that always fell in his
face. The triangular, toothy grin that
said, "I can do anything, and I can
do it better than anyone else." You
got the feeling he could take on the
entire Soviet Olympic hockey team
by himself. And win. Convincingly.
In fact, former teammate Mike
Dotterer (who signed a football con
tract with the Los Angeles Raiders,
got hurt and now is in grad school)
told a story about how he and Elway
once went to Okada, the Asian
theme house, to play ping-pong.
"It was one of those deals where
the winner keeps playing," Dotterer
said. "And John comes in there and
he hasn't played ping-pong in a few
months. Forty-five minutes later
he's still on the table, beating chal
lenger after challenger."
Then there was John Elway the
quarterback. A natural. Every game
was a masterpiece in itself, except,
that is, when he played against his
father's San Jose State teams. But
oh, what an arm.
When Elway's eligibility was
spent, he still was the center of at
tention, especially on that unforget
table day in the spring of 1983. It
was the afternoon after the National
Football League- draft, and Elway
had been drafted first by the then-
Baltimore Colts. Trade me or lose
me to baseball, Elway told the Colts
management from a San Jose hotel
banquet room as dozens of cameras
clicked and hundreds of reporters
scribbled.
Elway wasn't the only great ath
lete to walk across the Quad in the

past four years. There were also bas
ketball stars like Keith Jones and
John Revelli, or baseball stars like
Eric Hardgrave and Steve Beus
chele. There were a few Olympic
swimmers and top-notch cross
country runners.
And when it came to tennis, there
were more than a few. Scott Davis,
Alycia Moulton and Elise Burgin, all
present pros, cracked winners down
the line at the Varsity Courts. So did
Linda Gates, who undoubtedly will
join her fellow alumni in the pros
next year.
Gates, easily one of the more
popular and well-liked athletes on
campus, ended her career 12 days
ago at the NCAA Women's Tennis
Championships in Oklahoma City.
Gates ended it in style, winning the
singles and doubles individual titles.
Singles and doubles.
That brought her four-year total
of NCAA first-place trophies to five
— one singles, two doubles and two

team championships. The best part
about it is that a nicer, more deserv
ing person couldn't have won them.
Aside from great people, there
were some great wins in the past
four years. In that time, Stanford
never had a winning football season,
but it did win Big Game twice, in
cluding a rousing 27-10 victory at
Berkeley this season.
There was also the 75-64 basket
ball victory over UCLA last year,
the win that was perhaps the biggest
for Stanford in 42 years, since the
Cardinal beat Dartmouth in 1942 to
win the NCAA title. It put basket
ball on the map again, as Coach Tom
Davis showed that, yes, Stanford can
have a competitive basketball team.
But there were bad memories as
well. Remembering only the good
will put you somewhere between
Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan.
Of course, there was Paul Wiggin.
The ex-Cardinal football coach had
called the three biggest days of his

life being accepted to Stanford as a
student, getting married and being
named the head football coach at his
alma mater.
Five seasons later — only one of
them a winning effort — and the
whole damn thing exploded in his
face.
Wiggin, who no matter how good
a coach he becomes will never be a
better coach than he is a person,
took a solid blow to his pride. He
took it especially hard from the Bay
Area media. He even walked out of
one of his weekly press conferences.
And his team finished 1-10.
In his final game against Califor
nia, Stanford lost. As Wiggin walked
out of the stadium and down the
path toward Encina Gym, you got
the wrenching feeling in your
stomach that he deserved more than
that.
There was also the basketball
