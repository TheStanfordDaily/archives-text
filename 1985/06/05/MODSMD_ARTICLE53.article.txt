# Clark: All-American threat
## 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
OMAHA, Neb. — There is a player who is
dominating the College World Series with both his
powerful bat and magnetic personality, and he's
not Pete Incaviglia.
True, the Oklahoma State outfielder is having a
good tournament — he is 4-for-10 with a home
run. But the star of this series so far has been Mis
sissippi State first basemen Will Clark.

In games against Oklahoma State and Arkansas,
Clark is 6-for-8. He has three singles, a double, a
triple and a homer, has scored three runs and has
driven in four more.
For the year, the 6-foot-1, 177-pound junior is
hitting .429 with 24 homers and 76 RBIs. In 1985,
Clark became the only baseball player ever to be
chosen Southeastern Conference Athlete of the
Year.

Against Arkansas on Monday, Clark personally
led MSU to the final game of the winners' bracket.
His triple off the center-field wall tied the game at
one in the third.
Then, in the fifth, he blasted a two-run opposite
field homer to left that tied the game again. Finally,
with the score now knotted 4-4, Clark slapped an
RBI single through a drawn-in infield that gave the
Bulldogs the victory.
First base was open at the time, but Arkansas
Coach Norm Deßriyn chose to pitch to Clark. "1
was real surprised," Clark said. "But that's a chal
lenge to me."
Even without his hot night at the plate, it was a
pretty good day for Clark. In the morning, the San
Francisco Giants used their first-round draft choice
— the second pick overall — to put the MSU All-
American in orange and black.
"I was so pumped before the game after learning
about the draft, i just wanted to carry that through
the game," Clark said. "This has been one of the
best days of my life."
A native of New Orleans, with Southern man
nerisms and a drawl to match, Clark is an inter
viewer's delight — candid, interesting and artic
ulate.
On Incaviglia: "Pete puts so many numbers of
the board that he has to get respect. But at the
same time, he has holes that can be pitched to."

On Oklahoma State, which MSU beat, 12-3, on
Friday: "They've got impressive offensive stuff.
But their pitching and defense are horrendous.
They have a lot of walks, and when they came in
the zone, we lit them up."
On teammate and fellow Ail-American Jeff
Brantley: "He didn't have his curveball tonight
(against Arkansas), but Brantley is a true Bulldog
and a true competitor."
On baseball: "Baseball is a negative game by na
ture. Statistics show that you're going to fail seven
out of every 10 times you come up. So when you
get into the box, you gotta forget about that and say
to yourself, 'I'm gonna beat this guy.' "
On his future: "I'm very glad to be with the
Giants. Usually, No. 2 draft picks don't go back to
college."
Last summer, Clark led the silver-medal winning
U.S. Olympic baseball team in hitting with a .429
average. Of the Olympics, he said, "You never for
get something like that. I can name all the games."
When asked whether anything could keep him at
MSU for his senior year, Clark was characteristic
ally honest. "1 don't think so," he said. "My whole
life has been dedicated to playing major league
baseball, and this is my best opportunity."
But will he be able to adjust to the wooden bats
required in the professional ranks?
"To hit a ball hard, you gotta hit it on the meat
part of the bat," Clark said. "And I excel at that."
