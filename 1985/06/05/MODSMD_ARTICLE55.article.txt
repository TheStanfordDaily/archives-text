# 'Risky Business' or 'Personal Best?' Vineberg on movies
## A 						Final Column* 
### Steve Vineberg 
Steve Vineberg, who has reviewed movies here for the last
five years (and has written more than 800 capsule reviews
for the Cinemascope page), will graduate with a doctorate
in drama this month. This summer, he will leave for
Worcester, Mass., where he will he an assistant professor at
Holy Cross.
Of all the arts, high and low, movies may well be the
most fun to write about because, in a sense, they encom
pass all the arts in one. They often derive from theater or
from literature, they are both visual and musical, and be
cause they are a bastard form, the offspring of drama and
the fine arts, they cross-reference all the others. So a film
like "Diva" suggests a piece of jazz, and a director may be
operatic (like the John Boorman of "Excalibur" or the

If there is one thing that
going to movies regularly
teaches us, it's that the damn
edest films turn out to be
terrific, and since most of
what gets released is pretty
dreadful, you'd better not
look a gift horse in the
mouth.

Taviani Brothers in "Night of the Shooting Stars'), paint
erly (Peter Weir) or even architectural (Francesco Rosi).
Movies often suggest the work of different writers —
"The Elephant Man" is Dickens and Mary Shelley, "The
Year of Living Dangerously" Conrad, "Mrs. Soffel" Dos
toevski, and there is more of "Twelfth Night" in "Yentl"
than in most productions of "Twelfth Night" — yet in
evitably, . perversely, movies resist the efforts of well
intentioned writers and directors to get literature directly
onto the screen, as "The Bostonians" shows us, and
"Swann in Love" and "Under the Volcano" and even
"Ragtime."
But movies reflect much more than just the achieve
ments of artists in other fields. They tell us where we are
and what we care about; they are historical, political and

sociological statements, whether they declare their al
liances ("Under Fire") or imply them ("Uncommon
Valor '), whether they represent the attempts of thought
ful filmmakers to understand a contemporary situation
("Blow Out") or simply cash in on a popular mood
("Places in the Heart"). Often an offensive slab of junk
like "Sudden Impact" or a slickly packaged slab of junk

like "An Officer and a Gentleman" is actually more in
formative than any number of much better movies about
the period in which these pictures were made; just as his
torians now look with amused fascination at the cheery
fake Technicolor musicals of World War II and
the xenophobic Cold War espionage thrillers, so the rural
domestic dramas with their Ma Joad matriarchs and the
jingoistic back-to-Vietnam actioners are doomed to in
famy in years to come as Reagan-era artifacts.
In the early days of the "auteur" theory — the years of
the French New Wave and the rise of American critics like

Andrew Sarris — it was fashionable to frown upon
"impure" movies, movies based on plays and novels that
stuck too close to their source, movies (usually) that
refused to obey the rules of genre. If there is one thing
that going to the movies regularly teaches us, however, it's
that the damnedest films turn out to be terrific, and since
most of what gets released is pretty dreadful, you'd better

not look a gift horse in the mouth. Robert Altman's
"Come Back to the 5 & Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy
Dean" is a word-for-word transcription of a fourth-rate
stage play, yet somehow it transcends its source and seems
to transform itself into Chekhov's "Three Sisters" — a
miracle performed by Altman and a trio of extraordinary
actresses. "Stop Making Sense" is just a filmed rock con
cert in form, but it has a more assured and adventurous
feeling for the medium of the movies than, say,
"Amadeus." "Flashdance" was allegedly "created" for
the big screen, but it shrinks to TV size while we watch.

hut Rosi's filmed opera. ' Bizet's Carmen," filled the
Palace of Fine Arts when I saw it there, and continued to
grow.
During nearly five years of reviewing movies for The
Stanford Daily, I've tried to provide a sense of what
movies can he like at their best, and what most of us settle
for most of the time. The letters I've received, the ques
tions and comments I've heard from readers at dorm func
tions and in classes, on formal and informal occasions,
have given me, I think, a fairly good idea of the range of
responses to my reviews. 1 know that my refusal to en
dorse box-office hits like "Risky Business" or" Raiders of
the Lost Ark." or "serious" Academy Award-winners
like "Chariots of Fire" or "Gandhi." is often interpreted
as perverse or deliberately provocative, and that I tend to
champion movies few people have seen ("Shoot the
Moon"), few people have liked ("Pennies from
Heaven"), or defend directors who, in a conscious and
highly verbal community such as this one, have been
accused of various political faux pas (Brian De Palma,
Paul Mazursky in "Moscow on the Hudson").
I know, too, that some readers are astonished, others
amused and still (many) others exasperated by my insis
tence on writing at such length and in such detail about a
field that most people see as nothing more than diversion
and most reviewers summarize by means of a four-star
rating system or by digging the usual superlatives and
platitudes out of their bags ("Don't miss it!," "Sure to be
nominated for an Oscar!," etc.). Well, reviewing movies is
(or should be) a creative endeavor; there's not much point
to writing about them at all if you can't expand your per
spective beyond the paltry realm of the TV reviewers or
the people in the San Francisco Chronicle who decide
which of four positions their cartoon Everyman should
take in response to the latest releases.
My responses in print to the latest films are not willfully
contrary — I really do try to call them as I see them. 1
rarely fail to have a strong gut reaction to a movie, and it's
unusual for me to change my mind between the time I
leave the theater and the time I begin to write my review.
Movies, whether they are works of art or just works of en
tertainment, mean a great deal to me, and I refuse to set
tle for sloppy seconds like "Ghostbusters" and "Terms of
Endearment" when the evidence of my eyes and ears tells
me filmmakers can do better — that they can surprise and
charm us with a picture like "Local Hero" or "Iceman."
A new movie should be new; when I watch something like
"Raiders" or "Body Heat," "An Officer and a
Gentleman" or anything by Fellini. I know I've seen it
before. And though that may sound jaded, it is my passion
for movies that prompts me to be so harsh with cheaply
derivative or cheaply manipulative ones. Panning "And
the Ship Sails On" and "Staying Alive" gave me no plea
sure, but when movies excite me or move me on the
screen, I find I can extend those feelings by writing about

them, and that the best movies provide a rich store of
ideas for criticism. So I've greatly enjoyed writing about
"The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith" (my first review for
this newspaper), "Melvin and Howard," "All Night
Long," "Blow Out," "Napoleon," "Pennies from

Brothers," "E.T.," "Come Back to the 5 & Dime, Jimmy
Dean, Jimmy Dean," "Tootsie," "Local Hero," "The
Right Stuff," "Under Fire," "Yentl," "Moscow on the
Hudson," "Iceman," "Stop Making Sense," "The Purple
Rose of Cairo" — as well as the performances of Paul

Newman in "Fort Apache, the Bronx" and "Absence ot
Malice," Diane Keaton in "Reds" and "Mrs. Sot lei."
Debra Winger in "An Officer and a Gentleman" and
"Terms of Endearment," Peter O'Toole in "My Favorite
Year," Meryl Streep in "Sophie's Choice," Sean Penn in
"Fast Times at Ridgemont High," "Bad Boys" and"The
Falcon and the Snowman," Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin
in "All of Me," Vanessa Redgrave in "The Bostonians,"
Glenda Jackson and Julie Christie in "The Return of the
Soldier" and — a special treat — Laurence Olivier in the
televised "King Lear." And there have been others as
well.
It would be regrettable to leave my job at The Daily
without thanking all my editors through these past five
years. Though 1 have been kidded mercilessly about the
size of my reviews (one editor in chief made the
memorable comment that my piece on "Reds" was longer
than the movie) and the length of my paragraphs, my
column has always run uncut, and editorial feedback has
been unfailingly encouraging since 1 wrote my first review
for this paper in And 1 would like to thank my
readers, too — those who have had kind words for my
work (and 1 am pleased to say I have been fortunate in
that regard) as well as who have been moved on oc
casion to express their fury at my opinions. The readers of
The Daily represent a remarkably intelligent community,
and it has been a privilege for me to address it; I will be
lucky indeed if I ever find another readership as stimulat
ing as this one.

During nearly five years of reviewing movies for The
Stanford Daily, I've tried to provide a sense of what
movies can he like at their best, and what most of us settle
for most of the time. The letters I've received, the ques
tions and comments I've heard from readers at dorm func
tions and in classes, on formal and informal occasions,
have given me, I think, a fairly good idea of the range of
responses to my reviews. 1 know that my refusal to en
dorse box-office hits like "Risky Business" or" Raiders of
the Lost Ark." or "serious" Academy Award-winners
like "Chariots of Fire" or "Gandhi." is often interpreted
as perverse or deliberately provocative, and that I tend to
champion movies few people have seen ("Shoot the
Moon"), few people have liked ("Pennies from
Heaven"), or defend directors who, in a conscious and
highly verbal community such as this one, have been
accused of various political faux pas (Brian De Palma,
Paul Mazursky in "Moscow on the Hudson").
I know, too, that some readers are astonished, others
amused and still (many) others exasperated by my insis
tence on writing at such length and in such detail about a
field that most people see as nothing more than diversion
and most reviewers summarize by means of a four-star
rating system or by digging the usual superlatives and
platitudes out of their bags ("Don't miss it!," "Sure to be
nominated for an Oscar!," etc.). Well, reviewing movies is
(or should be) a creative endeavor; there's not much point
to writing about them at all if you can't expand your per
spective beyond the paltry realm of the TV reviewers or
the people in the San Francisco Chronicle who decide
which of four positions their cartoon Everyman should
take in response to the latest releases.
My responses in print to the latest films are not willfully
contrary — I really do try to call them as I see them. 1
rarely fail to have a strong gut reaction to a movie, and it's
unusual for me to change my mind between the time I
leave the theater and the time I begin to write my review.
Movies, whether they are works of art or just works of en
tertainment, mean a great deal to me, and I refuse to set
tle for sloppy seconds like "Ghostbusters" and "Terms of
Endearment" when the evidence of my eyes and ears tells
me filmmakers can do better — that they can surprise and
charm us with a picture like "Local Hero" or "Iceman."
A new movie should be new; when I watch something like
"Raiders" or "Body Heat," "An Officer and a
Gentleman" or anything by Fellini. I know I've seen it
before. And though that may sound jaded, it is my passion
for movies that prompts me to be so harsh with cheaply
derivative or cheaply manipulative ones. Panning "And
the Ship Sails On" and "Staying Alive" gave me no plea
sure, but when movies excite me or move me on the
screen, I find I can extend those feelings by writing about

them, and that the best movies provide a rich store of
ideas for criticism. So I've greatly enjoyed writing about
"The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith" (my first review for
this newspaper), "Melvin and Howard," "All Night

It would be regrettable to leave my job at The Daily

years. Though 1 have been kidded mercilessly about the
size of my reviews (one editor in chief made the
memorable comment that my piece on "Reds" was longer
than the movie) and the length of my paragraphs, my
column has always run uncut, and editorial feedback has
been unfailingly encouraging since 1 wrote my first review
for this paper in And 1 would like to thank my
readers, too — those who have had kind words for my
work (and 1 am pleased to say I have been fortunate in
that regard) as well as who have been moved on oc
casion to express their fury at my opinions. The readers of
The Daily represent a remarkably intelligent community,
and it has been a privilege for me to address it; I will be
lucky indeed if I ever find another readership as stimulat

Of all the arts, high and low, movies may well be the
most fun to write about because, in a sense, they encom
pass all the arts in one. They often derive from theater or
from literature, they are both visual and musical, and be
cause they are a bastard form, the offspring of drama and
the fine arts, they cross-reference all the others. So a film
like "Diva" suggests a piece of jazz, and a director may be
operatic (like the John Boorman of "Excalibur" or the

Movies often suggest the work of different writers —
"The Elephant Man" is Dickens and Mary Shelley, "The
Year of Living Dangerously" Conrad, "Mrs. Soffel" Dos

than in most productions of "Twelfth Night" — yet in
evitably, . perversely, movies resist the efforts of well
intentioned writers and directors to get literature directly
onto the screen, as "The Bostonians" shows us, and
"Swann in Love" and "Under the Volcano" and even
"Ragtime."
But movies reflect much more than just the achieve
ments of artists in other fields. They tell us where we are
and what we care about; they are historical, political and

sociological statements, whether they declare their al
liances ("Under Fire") or imply them ("Uncommon
Valor '), whether they represent the attempts of thought
ful filmmakers to understand a contemporary situation
("Blow Out") or simply cash in on a popular mood
("Places in the Heart"). Often an offensive slab of junk
like "Sudden Impact" or a slickly packaged slab of junk

like "An Officer and a Gentleman" is actually more in
formative than any number of much better movies about
the period in which these pictures were made; just as his

fake Technicolor musicals of World War II and

miracle performed by Altman and a trio of extraordinary

Rose of Cairo" — as well as the performances of Paul

Newman in "Fort Apache, the Bronx" and "Absence ot
Malice," Diane Keaton in "Reds" and "Mrs. Sot lei."
Debra Winger in "An Officer and a Gentleman" and
"Terms of Endearment," Peter O'Toole in "My Favorite
Year," Meryl Streep in "Sophie's Choice," Sean Penn in
"Fast Times at Ridgemont High," "Bad Boys" and"The
Falcon and the Snowman," Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin
in "All of Me," Vanessa Redgrave in "The Bostonians,"
Glenda Jackson and Julie Christie in "The Return of the
Soldier" and — a special treat — Laurence Olivier in the
televised "King Lear." And there have been others as
well.
It would be regrettable to leave my job at The Daily
without thanking all my editors through these past five
years. Though 1 have been kidded mercilessly about the
size of my reviews (one editor in chief made the
memorable comment that my piece on "Reds" was longer
than the movie) and the length of my paragraphs, my
column has always run uncut, and editorial feedback has
been unfailingly encouraging since 1 wrote my first review
for this paper in And 1 would like to thank my
readers, too — those who have had kind words for my
work (and 1 am pleased to say I have been fortunate in
that regard) as well as who have been moved on oc
casion to express their fury at my opinions. The readers of
The Daily represent a remarkably intelligent community,
and it has been a privilege for me to address it; I will be
lucky indeed if I ever find another readership as stimulat
ing as this one.
