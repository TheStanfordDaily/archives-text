# ‘How the Other Half Loves' lacks pizzazz
## 
### ELAINE WANG 
The Menlo Players Guild is a sound
community theater group, hut in its
current production of Alan Ayck
bourn's "How the Other Half
Loves," its has selected a much-less
than-riveting play to devote its
energies to.
I he plot involves three couples:
Fiona Foster (Valerie Hoare) is
having an affair with Boh Phillips
(Greg Bedford). I o avoid being
found out as having spent an evening
together, Fiona tells Frank Foster
(Don Wilkins) that she was out with
Mary Featherstone (Helena
Leßovics), who is the wife of William
(Martin Lilley), who is joining
Frank's department. Fiona tells him
that Mary thinks William is having an
affair, and Frank becomes obsessed
with counseling the Featherstones,

thereby overlooking his wife's ab
sence the previous evening. He
invites the Featherstones to dinner on
Thursday.
Bob has told his wife, Teresa
(Jaqueline O'Keefe), that he was with
William, who believes Mary is having
an affair, Teresa then invites the
Featherstones to dinner on Friday.
I he stage setting allows us to see
William and Mary having dinner with
both the Phil I ipses and the Fosters si
multaneously, providing one of the
play's high points.
Through a series of miscom
munications and wrongful accusa
tions, during which William slugs Bob
(who supposedly is having an affair
with Mary), and Teresa pummels
William (for hitting Bob), the
scapegoat Featherstones are
reconciled and the real adulterers i>o

scot-free.
The play is tedious, and the curtain
call which showed all three couples
sitting in their respective pairs grin
ning at each other was antithetical to
its ending. None of these people is
happily married, not during the play
and not at its ending — because that's
what happens, the play ends but has
no confrontation or resolution.
Everyone who is accused of infidelity
can honestly deny it; the only twist is
how Frank manages to jump contin
ually to the wrong conclusion even as
he keeps suspecting his wife of having
a lover. The only people who have
practiced adultery are never directly
confronted or exposed. The energy of
the play is spent in a farcical
framework with an incredibly snide
edge to it. (In fact, the only truly funny
part of the play is offstage, when Ben
jamin, the Phillips' baby, keeps get
ting into things such as prunes,
peanut butter and honey. We laugh
unreservedly just imagining what the
kid looks like and is doing to get his
mother or father off the stage!)
There is the struggle of the British
middle class implicit in the title,
"How the Other Half Loves," and in
the relationship between Frank and
William (boss and subordinate), and
between Fiona and Teresa. When the
Featherstones arrive for dinner, Fran
comes in without his shoes; Fiona
brings them to him and he asks
William to tie his shoelaces. In a later
scene, Teresa (the working-class
type) brings her son Benjamin to the
Foster home; Fiona complains
crudely about "the squirming lump in
the hall" and the drool patches in the
rug.
Patronization runs rampant in this
play, in a way that may be illustrative
of class tension, but is hardly funny.
William bullies Mary, maintaining
that "she was nothing . . . I've done
everything for her." If Ayckbourn
meant for the audience to react to the
satire of "the system" with both
awareness and hilarity, he has failed
two reach an even balance. Adding
an inordinate amount of bathroom
jokes to the high frustration level of
the situation does not make the play

more comic; we become uninterested
in the characters and impatient with
the dialogue. This is aggravated by
the fact that the production lasts
more than two hours.
Despite the irritations inherent in
the script, however, the cast gives a
balanced and spirited show. Helena
Leßovics, especially, handled the
part of the mousy, scared Mary Feath
erstone with aplomb; her fine sense
of timing is particularly outstanding
in the scene where everyone is at the
dinner table and the Feather'stones
have to react to the Phil I ipses upstage
and the Fosters downstage. One
second, Leßovics is agitated and at
tempting to leave the Phillips' table;
at another, she is submissively listen
ing to Frank's boring stories.
The arrangement of the set
deserves credit. Both families use the
same living room and each simply
flow through without noticing the
other. Director Brian Lucas staged
this well, with only some awkward-

ness in the dining room scene, when
important reactions are not visible to
everyone in the niidience.

"How the Other Half Loves" plays
June 6-9 and 13-15 at the Burgess
Theatre in Menlo Park.
