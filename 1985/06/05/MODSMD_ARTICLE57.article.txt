# Los Lobos at the Keystone an East L.A. band succeeds
## 
### TRACY FURUTANI 
Fhe last time we saw Lo> Lobos, we were 15 seconds
away from death. They' Were signed on as a promising
local band to open for the Clash last year during the
Clash's California mini-tour. We were in the crush at the
edge of the stage, surrounded by spitting punks and pre-
Madonna clones. The pressure of the crowd supported me
so that my feet rarely touched the ground during the
whole show. When Los Lobos appeared on stage, racial
slurs and more tangible objects were hurled their way, but
they continued with their set, stony-faced and deter
mined.
I he last time we heard of Los Lobos, they were at the
Keystone, headlining the club's Super Bowl eve bash. The
business suit/martini and trendpig crowd turned out in full
force, and rumor had it that even Mick Jagger showed up.
1 lad Los Lobos, in their sudden rise to fame, gone over
to the trendpigs?
Of course not. For those who doubted that, the show at
the Keystone Saturday night laid to rest any misgivings, as
Los Lobos put on a memorable and more personable per
formance.
Fhe opening act, Dwight Yoakam and his band, did
what opening acts are supposed to do: draw people out to
the dance floor. For those who like country music (and
they seemed to be in the majority at the Keystone),
Yoakam was a fine act, doing a great many dung-kicking
songs, especially the shuttle version of Hank William's
"Jamba lay a."
By the time Los Lobos took the stage, the dance floor
was as crowded as it was at Long Beach, but this time
there were no slurs or bottles. Kicking off their set with a
high-speed "Will the Wolf Survive?" Los Lobos never
slowed down. As the audience was more respectful than
that of a year ago, the members of the band, especially the
bearded guitarist Cesar Rosas, reflected the change by
being a bit more loose. Rosas clowned with the crowd,
using exaggerated flourishes and joking with the other
members of the band. Toward the end of the program, he
accepted cowboy hats and sombreros from the audience,

distributing them to the other members of the band. Los
Lobos ended up looking like something you'd see on Ol
vera Street rather than a nationally acclaimed group.
Musically, the show had generous helpings from both of
their albums, including quite a few of their trademark
mariachi songs. Because of the band's more more relaxed
stage manner, most of the songs took on a different char
acter than they have on the albums. With Rosas' rip
roaring vocals and David Hidalgo's rollicking accordion,
the extended dance version of "Don't Worry Baby" prob
ably came closest to resurrecting Los Lobos' native East
L.A. bar and street-fair circuit, while the more soft
spoken Hidalgo made "A Matter of Time." the story of
the departure of a migrant laborer, a more touching and
personal ballad.

These performances will
surely make the trendpigs
realize that Los Lobos is not
a band that will forget its
roots.

With the able assistance of Louie Perez* drums, Conrad
Lozano's bass and Steve Berlin's sax. Hidalgo and Rosas
split the vocals, each in turn inciting the other to try and
do better. Highlights of the show included the infectiously
joyous "I Got Loaded" and the encore presentation of
Fats Domino's "I'm Gonna Be a Wheel."
As Los Lobos is already known as a hard-working
band, (they are currently winding up their "North Beach
Taxi Tour" in which they played four shows at three clubs
on two successive nights), these performances will surely
make the trendpigs realize that Los Lobos is not a band
that will forget its roots.


Steve Berlin, Conrad Lozano, David Hidalgo, Cesar Rosas and Louis Perez make up Los Lobos, veterans of
more than 10 years on the music circuit in Los Angeles.
