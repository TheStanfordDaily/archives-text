# Summer listening for the discerning ear
## 
### ANDREW CROWELL Staff writer 
Well, my dedicated readers, summer is now
upon us at long last. As we part our ways for a
temporary or perhaps permanent repose from
this bastion of higher learning, 1 hope you will
remember to stimulate your ears as well as
your minds this summer. Sure, I hope you
make some money. Of course, I hope you do
some quality, just-for-fun reading. Definitely,
I want you to do some power-relaxing. But
don't forget to do some serious listening, too!
No doubt you have all received a copy of
the School of Humanities and Sciences'
"Summer Reading 1985" booklet. Let this
article serve as a sort of musical counterpart
to the aforementioned publication, a type of
"Summer Listening 1985." Rather than rattle
off more reviews, I'd like to give you a few
previews of things to watch for that might
prove of some musical interest. Only one of
the works has been released in its entirety at
present, so I'll be forced to refrain from long
elaborations.
"Wide Awake in America" by the Irish
quartet U2 is a four-song mini-album of live
cuts and out-takes from the band's recent
"Unforgettable Fire" tour and album. "Bad"
and "A Sort of Homecoming," the two live
tracks, are well-produced and provide a
sampling of the emotion that goes into a
U2 concert. "Three Sunrises" and "Love
Comes Tumbling" are movingly uplifting
pieces in the U2 tradition which echo the
band's most recent material. "Love Comes
Tumbling" reflects a certain "Boy"ish quality
as well.

Keep your eyes open for an upcoming
recording by REM entitled "Tales from the
Reconstruction" (or something fairly close to
this.) This will be the Georgia-based groups
third full-length album, though REM has
released a smattering of singles and mini-LPs
since its "Murmur" debut. Many critics and
fans wondered how REM could follow up its
highly acclaimed first album, but last year's
"Reckoning" handily reinforced the firm
standing this group had already established

among today's best. It will be really interest
ing to see how REM follows up two fantastic
LPs.
Watch for a new Alarm album that will
probably be out this summer or early this fall.
Though "Declaration" never really gave this
English band the exposure or popularity I
think it was expecting (and deserved), the
Alarm is continuing to put out its uplifting
brand of rock. The single "Absolute Reality"
has at present received a surprising amount of

airplay and foreshadows another piece
related and perhaps more popular record.
Sure to be one of the real talks of the sum
mer is the recent formation of the group
Emerson, Lake and Powell. Though I'm not
positive that this will be the group's formal
name, no doubt many Emerson, Lake and
Palmer fans will be dusting off their T-shirts.
Since the breakup of Emerson, Lake and Pal
mer in 1977, Keith Emerson has been absent
from the rock and roll stage, though he he has

released three albums, two of which were
movie soundtracks ("Nighthawks" and
"Inferno," a yet-to-be released Italian film).
Greg Lake also pursued a solo career, releas
ing two albums and achieveing some main
stream success with his near-hit "Nuclear At
tack." Lake also replaced John Wetton for a
short while and toured with the English rock
group Asia. Now these two musicians will be
joining forces with Cozy Powell (Deep
Purple) to produce what will most assuredly
be some quite progressive rock music. Last 1
heard, the group has an album scheduled tor
release this summer, and a tour may follow.
Last, keep your ears open for any material
by a group called GTR (an abbreviation for
guitar.) Though I'm not exactly certain of the
line-up, rumor has it that Steve Howe has left
Asia and has begun rehearsing with some
former members of Kansas. Your guess is
really as good as mine at this point, but keep
checking your local music gossip/information
column for details.
Though I would not want to come across as
endorsing albums before I have even heard
them, 1 am merely hoping to tip my readers
off to what 1 think will be some of the real
happenings in the music industry in the next
few months. The above artists have produced
some quality music in the past and should be
on their way to doing more of the same.
So wherever you go this summer, and
whatever you do, remember to take some
music along. Don't merely settle for the drab
fluff that often characterizes radio today;
really challenge your ears, and don't forget to
turn it up!
