## SOS A democratically plans future 
### MARILYN WANN Staff writer 
Members of Stanford Out of South Africa
don't like to talk about SOSA. They'd rather
spend their time telling you about divestment
or apartheid.
"We always say SOSA," says member
Amanda Kemp. "If you want Stanford out of
South Africa, then you're a part of SOSA."
This urge to minimize the formal structure
of their organization seems to have kept the
fervor of their protest undiluted by bureau
cracy, but it may not provide much stability
for the long fight they're planning.
Stability, however, may not be a very high
priority. "The SOSA organization is irrele
vant," says Kemp.
"It's always a struggle to remain flexible,
not get wed to one tactic," says Steve Phillips,
chairman of the Black Student Union and an
organizer of SOSA.
So tar, the tactics that SOSA follows have
been guided by the far-reaching goals the
group set forth in its Principles of Unity,
agreed upon at the first meeting on April 22,
attended by approximately 90 people.
These principles are broader than a simple
call for total divestment, which is actually
third on the list.
The goals of SOSA are to support the
revolutionary struggle in South Africa rather
than pressuring the government, to build
solidarity with other protesters, to broaden
the progressive base on campus, to build net
works with other groups and to engage in
strictly non-violent activities.
According to member Stacey Leyton, these
principles have helped SOSA plan strategy
using the democratic process, with as much
success as the use of any other method. With
well-defined broad plans, the little details
become simple decisions rather than policy
arguments, she says.
"The biggest thing that helps us is that
people are so concerned about the movement
that they take responsibility to keep the
meetings productive," she says.
The actual work of SOSA is done by ap
proximately 10 committees formed by any
members who are interested in their specific
projects.

Kemp, a freshman with little protesting ex
perience, explains the delegation of work as
very casual. She says she once walked in late
to a coordinating committee meeting when
SOSA members were deciding who should in
troduce the forum, and because no one else
wanted to do it, she volunteered. A few days
later she was addressing about 1,000 people
in the Quad.
Kemp does see some problems with this
system. "With a large group, trying to plan
strategy, it can be a weakness.
"Democracy is inefficient, but it's fair," says
Kemp. "It takes longer to react, which hurts
us because time is of the essence."
Leyton agrees with this attitude, saying,
"The organization doesn't matter as much as
letting people know how decisions are being
made, keeping lines of communication open."
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
agrees with the importance of maintaining
discussion, although he sees SOSA from a dif
ferent perspective than do its members.
He compares SOSA's activities to his
memories of the 1977 apartheid protesters
sitting in at Old Union by outlining the usual
phases these groups pass through.
"They find a core of students and others
who share a concern, then build a coalition
focusing not on their differences but on the
issue that people can agree with," he says, ex
plaining that SOSA already has taken this
step and now is in the education and
consciousness-raising phase, during which the
issues are put before the people.
For the next step, he predicts that SOSA
will start putting pressure on those who can
make changes, after regrouping over the sum
mer and allowing some time at the start of the
year for educating a new campus commu
nity
"It's important to know what's possible,"
he cautions, referring to the nine protesters
arrested last Tuesday in the Bursar's Office.
"I don't think that incident would force the
University to divest now. It's a long process."
Phillips explains that the only thing SOSA
can use to influence the Board of Trustees is
power, which he hopes to gain with mass pres
sure.
"I don't think (the trustees) respect us," he

says. "Power persuades. No moral persuasion
or logical arguments will help. We were
respected when we turned out 1,000 people
for the forum."
Lyons responds to this by recounting that
during a dinner he attended at one of the
residences, only two of the 10 students who
sat his table were interested enough to keep
up a conversation about divestment.
"It's not a matter of government becoming
more enlightened, but of applying more pres
sure than they can stand," claims Phillips,
who hopes to rally faculty and staff into the
student movement. He estimates that SOSA
would need a majority of campus support to
be in "pretty good shape."
Nelson Mandela Free University, the sit-in
corner of the Quad, is part of the education
phase that Lyons described.
"It's a free education that you can't get
anywhere else," says Phillips, explaining its
role in SOSA strategy. "You learn how the
University is run and what motivates society."
He suggests that with this information,
Mandela students would begin to take a cer
tain point of view. "It (the information)
points out that Stanford University is run like
a South African corporation. It has minority
rule, treats workers terribly," Phillips says.
Lyons has two views on SOSA. He admits
that the board would not have put divestment
on the agenda without its actions, but also ex
plains that the issues are not as simple as
SOSA claims.
"The trouble is when one or the other
group feels it's dealing with the absolute
truth,"says Lyons. "Then someone who dis
agrees with them is only explained by two
ideas, they don't understand the issue or they
are badly misguided."
He argues that movements like SOSA don't
deal with the subtleties of possible solutions
to investment responsibility. "At what point
do you engage what tactic?" he asks. "With
that question, things get really complicated."
Phillips also does not describe the solution as
an easily defined plan, saying, "We are taking
the proposals that we put forth very seriously.
We know the University isn't going to divest
totally, but the time for the Sullivan Principles
is gone."

Steve Phillips addresses a divestment rally in the Inner Quad. "Power persuades,'' he

arguments will help."
Members of Stanford Out of South Africa
don't like to talk about SOSA. They'd rather
spend their time telling you about divestment
or apartheid.
"We always say SOSA," says member
Amanda Kemp. "If you want Stanford out of
South Africa, then you're a part of SOSA."
This urge to minimize the formal structure
of their organization seems to have kept the
fervor of their protest undiluted by bureau
cracy, but it may not provide much stability
for the long fight they're planning.
Stability, however, may not be a very high
priority. "The SOSA organization is irrele
vant," says Kemp.
"It's always a struggle to remain flexible,
not get wed to one tactic," says Steve Phillips,
chairman of the Black Student Union and an
organizer of SOSA.
So tar, the tactics that SOSA follows have
been guided by the far-reaching goals the
group set forth in its Principles of Unity,
agreed upon at the first meeting on April 22,
attended by approximately 90 people.
These principles are broader than a simple
call for total divestment, which is actually
third on the list.
The goals of SOSA are to support the
revolutionary struggle in South Africa rather
than pressuring the government, to build
solidarity with other protesters, to broaden
the progressive base on campus, to build net
works with other groups and to engage in
strictly non-violent activities.
According to member Stacey Leyton, these
principles have helped SOSA plan strategy
using the democratic process, with as much
success as the use of any other method. With
well-defined broad plans, the little details
become simple decisions rather than policy
arguments, she says.
"The biggest thing that helps us is that
people are so concerned about the movement
that they take responsibility to keep the
meetings productive," she says.
The actual work of SOSA is done by ap
proximately 10 committees formed by any
members who are interested in their specific
projects.

Kemp, a freshman with little protesting ex
perience, explains the delegation of work as
very casual. She says she once walked in late
to a coordinating committee meeting when
SOSA members were deciding who should in
troduce the forum, and because no one else
wanted to do it, she volunteered. A few days
later she was addressing about 1,000 people
in the Quad.
Kemp does see some problems with this
system. "With a large group, trying to plan
strategy, it can be a weakness.
"Democracy is inefficient, but it's fair," says
Kemp. "It takes longer to react, which hurts
us because time is of the essence."
Leyton agrees with this attitude, saying,
"The organization doesn't matter as much as
letting people know how decisions are being
made, keeping lines of communication open."
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
agrees with the importance of maintaining
discussion, although he sees SOSA from a dif
ferent perspective than do its members.
He compares SOSA's activities to his
memories of the 1977 apartheid protesters
sitting in at Old Union by outlining the usual
phases these groups pass through.
"They find a core of students and others
who share a concern, then build a coalition
focusing not on their differences but on the
issue that people can agree with," he says, ex
plaining that SOSA already has taken this
step and now is in the education and
consciousness-raising phase, during which the
issues are put before the people.
For the next step, he predicts that SOSA
will start putting pressure on those who can
make changes, after regrouping over the sum
mer and allowing some time at the start of the
year for educating a new campus commu
nity
"It's important to know what's possible,"
he cautions, referring to the nine protesters
arrested last Tuesday in the Bursar's Office.
"I don't think that incident would force the
University to divest now. It's a long process."
Phillips explains that the only thing SOSA
can use to influence the Board of Trustees is
power, which he hopes to gain with mass pres
sure.
"I don't think (the trustees) respect us," he

says. "Power persuades. No moral persuasion
or logical arguments will help. We were
respected when we turned out 1,000 people
for the forum."
Lyons responds to this by recounting that
during a dinner he attended at one of the
residences, only two of the 10 students who
sat his table were interested enough to keep
up a conversation about divestment.
"It's not a matter of government becoming
more enlightened, but of applying more pres
sure than they can stand," claims Phillips,
who hopes to rally faculty and staff into the
student movement. He estimates that SOSA
would need a majority of campus support to
be in "pretty good shape."
Nelson Mandela Free University, the sit-in
corner of the Quad, is part of the education
phase that Lyons described.
"It's a free education that you can't get
anywhere else," says Phillips, explaining its
role in SOSA strategy. "You learn how the
University is run and what motivates society."
He suggests that with this information,
Mandela students would begin to take a cer
tain point of view. "It (the information)
points out that Stanford University is run like
a South African corporation. It has minority
rule, treats workers terribly," Phillips says.
Lyons has two views on SOSA. He admits
that the board would not have put divestment
on the agenda without its actions, but also ex
plains that the issues are not as simple as
SOSA claims.
"The trouble is when one or the other
group feels it's dealing with the absolute
truth,"says Lyons. "Then someone who dis
agrees with them is only explained by two
ideas, they don't understand the issue or they
are badly misguided."
He argues that movements like SOSA don't
deal with the subtleties of possible solutions
to investment responsibility. "At what point
do you engage what tactic?" he asks. "With
that question, things get really complicated."
Phillips also does not describe the solution as
an easily defined plan, saying, "We are taking
the proposals that we put forth very seriously.
We know the University isn't going to divest
totally, but the time for the Sullivan Principles
is gone."
