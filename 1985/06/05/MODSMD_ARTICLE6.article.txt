# Rodin garden donors honored
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Staff writer 
Formal ceremonies were held
Friday afternoon to honor donors
to the B. Gerald Cantor Rodin
Sculpture Garden. The garden was
named to honor Cantor, the Los
Angeles financier who was the
project's principal benefactor.
The garden, adjacent to the
Stanford Art Museum, is the per
manent site of 20 Rodin sculptures
and the showcase for the Univer
sity's Rodin collection, the largest
and most important collection
outside of Paris.
Designed by architect Robert
Mittelstadt. the garden duplicates
the type of outdoor environment
in which Rodin displayed his
work. The benches and formal
plantings suggest the exhibition of
sculptures by Rodin in the
Bagatelle Garden of the Bois de
Boulogne in Paris.
The garden is anchored by "The
Gates of Hell," installed as a sym
bolic entrance to the B. Gerald
Cantor Rotunda within the
museum. Statues of Adam and
Eve flank "The Gates of Hell" as
Rodin intended, and the garden's
eastern court contains works made
to complement the massive
sculpture.
Continuing thematic groupings,
the southern court is devoted to
Rodin's monuments to artists, in
cluding- "The Monument to Bas
tien Lepage," raised on a pedestal
to the height preferred by the
sculptor.
The southern circular area of

the western terrace will contain
the complete monument to "The
Burghers of Calais," to be in
stalled in the near future, as well
as two enlarged heads from the
work.
The remainder of the sculptures
on the terrace are all partial fig
ures, including "Large Male
Torso," Rodin's most influential
contribution to modern sculpture.
The indoor anchor of the garden
is "The Age of Bronze," Rodin's
debut effort as a sculptor. The
work stands in the center of the B.
Gerald Cantor Rotunda of the
museum and will be visible from
the outside through huge glass
doors.
The garden will be open to the
public 24 hours a day, and a spe
cial lighting system will soon be in
stalled so nighttime visitors will be
able to view the sculptures lighted
from below — as the sculptures
were in Rodin's studio.
The dedication ceremony began
with a private screening of
"Rodin: 'The Gates of Hell.' " an
award-winning film produced by
Cantor's wife, Iris, documenting
the process of casting Rodin's
masterpiece in bronze. The film,
shown before an invitation-only
audience in Annenberg
Auditorium, gave a detailed look
at the intricacies of casting the
sculpture that now rests beside the
art museum.
The group then moved across
the Oval to the sculpture garden

where several hundred listened to
speeches while sipping champagne
and eating such delicacies as
chocolate-covered strawberries.
In his opening remarks. Art Prof.
Albert Elsen, curator of the Univer
sity's Rodin collection, told the lis
teners they should not be bothered by
the fact that the garden was not yet
completed. "As you look around you
there is good evidence that there are
still portions of this garden to be com
pleted," Elsen said. "As Rodin used
to say when people asked him when
he was going to finish 'The Gates of
Hell,' 'Are the cathedrals finished?' "
University President Donald Ken
nedy, the next speaker, thanked Can
tor and the other donors "who made
our lives more pleasant" by providing
sculptures which bring "refreshment
of the spirit."
"This garden gives us an outdoor
focus for inspiration in a part of the
campus that has long lacked it," Ken
nedy said.

Elsen then introduced Cantor, who
recounted his original vision of estab
lishing a Rodin garden at Stanford.
"In 1984, when I gave Stanford 88
sculptures by Rodin, it was with the
expectation that we would eventually
establish the largest and most impor
tant center for study of this great art
ist outside of Paris," Cantor said.
"My dream was to have a Rodin gar
den next to where the collection is
housed."
Cantor also personally thanked the
Board of Trustees and all of the
donors who "shared this vision and
brought the garden into being."
Keeping the garden open to the
public was also a prime consideration.
Cantor said. "For my part, I have al
ways believed that art must be seen
by as many as possible, and this ques
tion put my conviction to the test,"
Cantor said. "We wanted a second art
museum, one literally without walls.
We acted with the conviction that if
the people saw our trust, they would
respect and share it."
Cantor said the decision to have
the garden without walls brought an
unforeseen consequence. "Little did
we know that the Rodin garden

would appeal to a gopher who took
up residence less than 24 hours after
the lawn was put in," he joked.
"Maybe this is a good sign, and we
have built something that will attract
all creatures, great and small.
Other speakers were Phyllis Wat
tis, honorary chair of that evening s
Black and White Ball in San Fran
cisco, and Linda Meier, the Univer
sity trustee who accepted the garden
on behalf of the entire board.
In his closing remarks, Elsen
thanked architect Robert Mittelstadt
and all of the workers who built the
garden. "Rodin called an artist, any
man who loves his work.' By his defi
nition, many artists built this garden,
Elsen said.
With the girders of the yet-to-be
completed Laboratory Surge Build
ing looming behind the listeners, El
sen said he hoped the garden would
continue to exemplify the importance
of art and architecture at Stanford.
"During our next 100 years, let us
hope that this university will do for its
future architecture what the B.G.
Cantor Garden does for the tradition
of sculpture at Stanford," he said.

where several hundred listened to
speeches while sipping champagne
and eating such delicacies as
chocolate-covered strawberries.
In his opening remarks. Art Prof.
Albert Elsen, curator of the Univer
sity's Rodin collection, told the lis
teners they should not be bothered by
the fact that the garden was not yet
completed. "As you look around you
there is good evidence that there are
still portions of this garden to be com
pleted," Elsen said. "As Rodin used
to say when people asked him when
he was going to finish 'The Gates of
Hell,' 'Are the cathedrals finished?' "
University President Donald Ken
nedy, the next speaker, thanked Can
tor and the other donors "who made
our lives more pleasant" by providing
sculptures which bring "refreshment
of the spirit."
"This garden gives us an outdoor
focus for inspiration in a part of the
campus that has long lacked it," Ken
nedy said.

Elsen then introduced Cantor, who
recounted his original vision of estab
lishing a Rodin garden at Stanford.
"In 1984, when I gave Stanford 88
sculptures by Rodin, it was with the
expectation that we would eventually
establish the largest and most impor
tant center for study of this great art
ist outside of Paris," Cantor said.
"My dream was to have a Rodin gar
den next to where the collection is
housed."
Cantor also personally thanked the
Board of Trustees and all of the
donors who "shared this vision and
brought the garden into being."
Keeping the garden open to the
public was also a prime consideration.
Cantor said. "For my part, I have al
ways believed that art must be seen
by as many as possible, and this ques
tion put my conviction to the test,"
Cantor said. "We wanted a second art
museum, one literally without walls.
We acted with the conviction that if
the people saw our trust, they would
respect and share it."
Cantor said the decision to have
the garden without walls brought an
unforeseen consequence. "Little did
we know that the Rodin garden

would appeal to a gopher who took
up residence less than 24 hours after
the lawn was put in," he joked.
"Maybe this is a good sign, and we
have built something that will attract
all creatures, great and small.
Other speakers were Phyllis Wat
tis, honorary chair of that evening s
Black and White Ball in San Fran
cisco, and Linda Meier, the Univer
sity trustee who accepted the garden
on behalf of the entire board.
In his closing remarks, Elsen
thanked architect Robert Mittelstadt
and all of the workers who built the
garden. "Rodin called an artist, any
man who loves his work.' By his defi
nition, many artists built this garden,
Elsen said.
With the girders of the yet-to-be
completed Laboratory Surge Build
ing looming behind the listeners, El
sen said he hoped the garden would
continue to exemplify the importance
of art and architecture at Stanford.
"During our next 100 years, let us
hope that this university will do for its
future architecture what the B.G.
Cantor Garden does for the tradition
of sculpture at Stanford," he said.
Formal ceremonies were held
Friday afternoon to honor donors
to the B. Gerald Cantor Rodin
Sculpture Garden. The garden was
named to honor Cantor, the Los
Angeles financier who was the
project's principal benefactor.
The garden, adjacent to the
Stanford Art Museum, is the per
manent site of 20 Rodin sculptures
and the showcase for the Univer
sity's Rodin collection, the largest
and most important collection
outside of Paris.
Designed by architect Robert
Mittelstadt. the garden duplicates
the type of outdoor environment
in which Rodin displayed his
work. The benches and formal
plantings suggest the exhibition of
sculptures by Rodin in the
Bagatelle Garden of the Bois de
Boulogne in Paris.
The garden is anchored by "The
Gates of Hell," installed as a sym
bolic entrance to the B. Gerald
Cantor Rotunda within the
museum. Statues of Adam and
Eve flank "The Gates of Hell" as
Rodin intended, and the garden's
eastern court contains works made
to complement the massive
sculpture.
Continuing thematic groupings,
the southern court is devoted to
Rodin's monuments to artists, in
cluding- "The Monument to Bas
tien Lepage," raised on a pedestal
to the height preferred by the
sculptor.
The southern circular area of

the western terrace will contain
the complete monument to "The
Burghers of Calais," to be in
stalled in the near future, as well
as two enlarged heads from the
work.
The remainder of the sculptures
on the terrace are all partial fig
ures, including "Large Male
Torso," Rodin's most influential
contribution to modern sculpture.
The indoor anchor of the garden
is "The Age of Bronze," Rodin's
debut effort as a sculptor. The
work stands in the center of the B.
Gerald Cantor Rotunda of the
museum and will be visible from
the outside through huge glass
doors.
The garden will be open to the
public 24 hours a day, and a spe
cial lighting system will soon be in
stalled so nighttime visitors will be
able to view the sculptures lighted
from below — as the sculptures
were in Rodin's studio.
The dedication ceremony began
with a private screening of
"Rodin: 'The Gates of Hell.' " an
award-winning film produced by
Cantor's wife, Iris, documenting
the process of casting Rodin's
masterpiece in bronze. The film,
shown before an invitation-only
audience in Annenberg
Auditorium, gave a detailed look
at the intricacies of casting the
sculpture that now rests beside the
art museum.
The group then moved across
the Oval to the sculpture garden
