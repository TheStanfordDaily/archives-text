# Rodin garden donors honored

### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Staff writer 
Formal ceremonies were held
Friday afternoon to honor donors
to the B. Gerald Cantor Rodin
Sculpture Garden. The garden was
named to honor Cantor, the Los
Angeles financier who was the
project's principal benefactor.
The garden, adjacent to the
Stanford Art Museum, is the per
manent site of 20 Rodin sculptures
and the showcase for the Univer
sity's Rodin collection, the largest
and most important collection
outside of Paris.
Designed by architect Robert
Mittelstadt. the garden duplicates
the type of outdoor environment
in which Rodin displayed his
work. The benches and formal
plantings suggest the exhibition of
sculptures by Rodin in the
Bagatelle Garden of the Bois de
Boulogne in Paris.
The garden is anchored by "The
Gates of Hell," installed as a sym
bolic entrance to the B. Gerald
Cantor Rotunda within the
museum. Statues of Adam and
Eve flank "The Gates of Hell" as
Rodin intended, and the garden's
eastern court contains works made
to complement the massive
sculpture.
Continuing thematic groupings,
the southern court is devoted to
Rodin's monuments to artists, in
cluding- "The Monument to Bas
tien Lepage," raised on a pedestal
to the height preferred by the
sculptor.
The southern circular area of

the western terrace will contain
the complete monument to "The
Burghers of Calais," to be in
stalled in the near future, as well
as two enlarged heads from the
work.
The remainder of the sculptures
on the terrace are all partial fig
ures, including "Large Male
Torso," Rodin's most influential
contribution to modern sculpture.
The indoor anchor of the garden
is "The Age of Bronze," Rodin's
debut effort as a sculptor. The
work stands in the center of the B.
Gerald Cantor Rotunda of the
museum and will be visible from
the outside through huge glass
doors.
The garden will be open to the
public 24 hours a day, and a spe
cial lighting system will soon be in
stalled so nighttime visitors will be
able to view the sculptures lighted
from below â€” as the sculptures
were in Rodin's studio.
The dedication ceremony began
with a private screening of
"Rodin: 'The Gates of Hell.' " an
award-winning film produced by
Cantor's wife, Iris, documenting
the process of casting Rodin's
masterpiece in bronze. The film,
shown before an invitation-only
audience in Annenberg
Auditorium, gave a detailed look
at the intricacies of casting the
sculpture that now rests beside the
art museum.
The group then moved across
the Oval to the sculpture garden
