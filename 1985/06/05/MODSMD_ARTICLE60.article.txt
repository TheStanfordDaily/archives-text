## Borel's lacks the food to match great atmosphere 
### 
Borel's
2951 Campus Drive
San Mateo
341-7464
With Commencement just around
the corner, seniors are on the lookout
for nice medium-priced restaurants
where they can take their families. If
you want to avoid the Palo Alto rush
graduation weekend and need a place
close to the airport, you might con
sider Borel's in San Mateo.
A 20-minute drive from campus,
Borel's provides a nice atmosphere
perfect for family gatherings. The
two-story wood building is lined on
one side with large windows. Dusk is
the perfect time to go because the

torches inside the restaurant and the
greenery adorned with strings of
lights create a nice atmosphere.
The view of the South and East
Bay lights is fabulous and provides an
excellent vantage point from which to
show your parents the area in which
you've spent the last four years.
The food at Borel's is basic con
tinental fare with an emphasis on
seafood. The menu has appetizers
which range from oysters on the half
shell ($4.75) to baked brie ($4.50).
I ordered the pate with truffles
($3.95), and found it to be quite
flavorful. The pate was served with
thin slices of bread, sweet pickles and
onions. This appetizer is definitely
enough for two people to share. My

date had the shrimp cocktail ($5.50),
which consisted of five large shrimp
on ice. A great, spicy cocktail sauce
was served on the side.
The wine list is quite extensive,
with prices ranging from $10 to $29.
There is also an extensive selection of
wines you can purchase by the glass.
We had a moderately priced Fetzer
Chardonnay which had a nice fruity
flavor.
We happened to be at Borel's
during its New Zealand celebration.
As we walked in, we were greeted by
a huge banner which read, "It's
what's down under that counts." No.
it's not what you're thinking; it's
down under as in New Zealand.

The waiters and waitresses sported
buttons with the same slogan, and our
waitress confirmed that she had
received several comments about the
suggestive slogan.
In keeping with the theme, the spe
cials of the day were New Zealand
type dishes. The prices of the entrees
range from $9.95 for chicken dishes
to $16.95 for meat and fish combina
tions.
I had a chicken marsala, which is
served with rice pilaf or potatoes and
vegetables. The entrees also come
with a choice of green salad with fresh
blue cheese or spinach salad. Both
were very fresh, and the dressings
perfectly complemented the salad.

The chicken was fine hut not great.
The sauce had a nice flavor but was
too oiiy, and the chicken was not as
moist as it could have been.
Brad had a broiled sirloin steak
and jumbo shrimp dish. The steak
was good but not cooked as ordered.
The shrimp did not taste as fresh as
those in the shrimp cocktail.
The prices, although not cheap,
were appropriate for the quantity of
food. After our appetizers and
generous portions of salad, we were
full. The entrees are likewise very
generous.
For dessert, there is a dessert tray
which varies daily. The selection in
cluded chocolate mousse, cookies

and-cream pie and kiwi-and
strawberry torte, among other things.
We tried a new addition, a creme de
menthe parfait. Although the mint
taste was nice, the consistency wasn't
quite right. It would have been better
a little lighter, like a mousse, or as a
filling in a torte. By itself, it was
mediocre.
The service at Borel's was excel
lent. Our waitress and bus boy were
attentive without being overbearing.
All in all, Borel's was a pleasant
place to eat, but the food was disap
pointing. With so many restaurants in
the area, there are other comparably
priced places that serve better food.
