When handed the assignment to
review the Stagecoach Restaurant in
Woodside, I kind of had the feeling I
was going to some place out of the
Old West that served your typical
meat-and-potatoes, Mr. Steak-type
fare. And while the place is decorated
in a style recalling the days of
"Gunsmoke," complete with a mini
ature hanging stagecoach in the
middle of the main dining area, the
menu is quite diverse, reflecting a va
riety of tastes— albeit standard tastes
— that could please almost everyone.
After arriving at the Stagecoach, a
quick, 15-minute trip from campus,
my companion and 1 were seated
promptly for dinner. The restaurant
was rather crowded — as might be
expected for a Saturday — and the
patrons were generally older, we
being the youngest people in the
place. Our first impression was that
this was the type of restaurant you'd
take your parents to on a visit to
Stanford.
We found it refreshing to get away
from the over-trafficked, Stanford
type-crowd hangouts on HI Camino
Real, although the place showed signs
of the California-vogue restaurant,
with a few plants scattered through
out the dining area and lemon wedges
floating neatly in our water glasses.
Upon being seated, we were
quickly presented menus and a rather
extensive wine list, from which we
chose a $7.75 bottle of white wine —
1982 Grey Reisling. The wine was
chilled to a pleasing temperature and
the waitress was quick to refill our
glasses.
The wheat bread we munched on
while reading the menu — which in
cluded steak, seafood and pasta

entrees — was rather dry and bland,
reminiscent of food service loaves.
The bread, however, proved to be
one of the few weaknesses in what
was otherwise a tasty and well
prepared meal.
My companion chose the Tour
nedos Bearnaise, two medallions of
tenderloin topped with bernaise
sauce and whole mushrooms, accom
panied by a baked potato and slices of
zucchini. The dinner was served with
a choice of salad and two soups, in
cluding New England-style clam
chowder and a Mexican minestrone
— all told, a good value for $10.25.
My companion said the clam chow
der was rather plain, noting a lack of
clams and an almost-too-floury base.
The entree, however, was much more
to her liking — the meat was fresh
and cooked to order, with the sauce
enhancing the flavor without smoth
ering the taste.
The zucchini was sauteed, although
not overcooked and limp as it is
served at restaurants that simply tack
on a vegetable with the meal to fill
out the plate. The potato was likewise
baked an appropriate amount of time
and served hot, without being baked
to the point of sponge-like consis
tency.
I chose the Prawns Scampi at
$10.95, accompanied by zucchini,
rice and a bowl of the Mexican soup.
The soup was outstanding, filled
with pinto beans, rice, celery and tiny
pieces of meat — worthy of the trip
by itself. The flavor was mildly spicy,
without making one immediately
reach for a glass of water.
The shrimp — more than a half
dozen pieces — were fresh, served in
a light, garlic-flavored sauce that
doesn't make one's breath un
bearable for going out to a party af
terward. The shrimp are large enough

to make for a meal in themselves, al
though the rice was rather tasty, and
the zucchini, as noted before, was un
usually good for a restaurant
vegetable.
For dessert, we shared a piece of
chocolate-nut cheesecake and a slice
of strawberry-banana pie. The
cheesecake, a tiny sliver which could
have been larger, was firm, rich and
delicious, on a level with the

cheesecake served at Lindy's in Man
hattan. It is definitely the dessert to
choose.
The fruit pie, on the other hand,
tasted as if the recipe had been taken
off the back of a box of Jell-O. The
fruit was covered in a red,
strawberry-flavored gelatinous sub
stance that lacked any zip — a bland,
homemade dessert.
Our waitress was friendly and help

ful, although I thought she was
sometimes too quick with an
"excellent choice" remark as we se
lected from the menu, seemingly
guiding our way through the menu
the way an orientation volunteer
helps freshmen get around campus
for the first time. We suspected her
almost excessive friendliness was a
result of being informed we were
coming to review the place, although

she was equally as courteous to pa
trons at other tables.
Overall, the Stagecoach is a fine
restaurant, worth the short trip to
Woodside. It's also a great change of
pace from other Stanford-oriented
restaurants, giving one the feeling of
being far away from campus and the
bustle of El Camino.
