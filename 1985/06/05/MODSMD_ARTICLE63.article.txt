I he Story of Adele H. (1975)
U.C. Theater. Berkeley
Francois Truffaut's Dostoevskian ac
count of a woman whose passion for a
young man in every way beneath her
transcends the paltriness of the affair it
self and becomes its own raison d'etre.
Adele (Isabelle Adjani, in a great perfor
mance) in the daughter of Victor Hugo,
and her insistence on taking up with a
young English lieutenant is meant on one
level as a slap in her father's celebrated
face; the irony that escapes her is that she
ends up concocting a romantic fiction
worthy of her father's pen. Too few
people have seen this film, which is Truf
faut's best after "Jules and Jim." It has a
phenomenal screenplay, which Truffaut
co-authored with Suzanne Schiffman and
Jean (iruault, and some of the best work
Nestor Almendros, the cinematographer,
has ever done.
Plays Sunday with "A Sunday in the
Country."
Atlantic City (1981)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
The playwright John Guare has an un
usual temperament and an inclusive
comic vision: His work shows an acute
consciousness of all levels of human exis
tence that does not move into cynicism.
His screenplay for this Louis Malle film is
full of surprises. We meet Sally (Susan
Sarandon), who works at a hotel oyster
bar in Atlantic City but is training to be a
coupier; Lou (Burt Lancaster), an aging
numbers runner who takes care of bed
ridden Grace (Kate Reid), the widow of
an old friend, for whom he also provides
occasional sexual services; Sally's
estranged husband David (Robert Joy), a
cocaine dealer who travels with Sally's
space cadet kid sister Chrissie (Hollis
McLaren), a Korean foot massage spe
cialist whom he has impregnated. The
movie is an inspired grab bag in which
these wonderfully suggestive characters
form unexpected relationships and
manage to function in their individual
idiosyncratic ways despite the pressures
of the outside world and with respect,
even affection, for each other's strangely
colored, supercharged spaces. Beautifully
acted — especially by Burt Lancaster,
whose portrayal of the petty criminal who
trips into the big time caps three and a
half decades of movie acting.
Plays Monday with "My Dinner with
Andre."
Wise Blood (1980)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
John Huston's faithful adaptation of
the Flannery O'Connor novel about
Hazel Motes, preacher of the Gospel of
the Church Without Christ. The novel is a
Southern gothic burlesque; in Huston's
hands, it becomes grotesque slapstick of a
high order. The film distances the audi
ence, and it is certainly not for all tastes,
but it is well written and well directed and
the unusual cast is close to perfect. Brad
Dourif. who played Billy Bibbit in "One
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and the
creepy chauffeur in "Eyes of Laura
Mars," is Hazel; Harry Dean Stanton and
Ned Beatty play a pair of phony evan
gelists; Amy Wright is Stanton's las
civious daughter; Dan Shor is the boy
who shadows Hazel.
The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai
(1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This New Wave comic strip adventure,
with its parodic echoes of "M*A*S*H"
and "Annie Hall" and the whole catalog
of Hollywood sci-fi pictures from the
19505, is consistently funny, despite the
plot confusion and the unsuccessful ef
forts of first-time-out director W.D.
Richter to balance several dozen nar
rative and character elements. The story
plunks the Japanese-American cosmic
cool leading man Buckaroo (Peter Wel
ler, of the electric blue eyes) and his gang,
the Hong Kong Cavaliers (scientists, rock
'n' rollers and comic book supeiheroes),
in the middle of a war between the Black
I ectroids and the Red Lectroids. As evil
Dr. Lizardo, John l.ithgow sends up all
the mad scientists who ever appeared on
screen. Some of the other talented
performers (Ellen Barkin, Jeff
Goldblum, Christopher Lloyd, Lewis
Smith) get buried under piles of narrative
debris, but Richter's all-systems-go direc
tion demonstrates an appreciation of
screenwriter Earl Mac Rauch's invention,
and he collaborates with production
designer J. Michael Riva, costume desig
ner Aggie Gucrrard Rodgers, and special
visual effects supervisor Michael Fink, as
well as the usually unyielding photog
rapher Fred Koenekamp, to bring off
some nifty pop sequences and dress
parades.
Plays Friday. June 14.
Modern Romance (1981)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Albert Brooks' style of comedy in this
film is so muted that you have to lean
closely into it before you can see what is
meant to be humorous, but if you link up
with it. it's almost unceasingly funny for
the first half. ( Then it turns obnoxious.)
Brooks, who directed and co-authored
the script, plays Robert Cole, a film
editor who is breaking up with his girl
friend. Mary Harvard (Kathryn Harrold)
sort of. The best scenes, like a
quaalude routine, are like Impressionist
lonesco. James 1 Brooks, himself a com
edy writer, does a hilarious cameo as a
movie director who talks about his
crummy science-fiction epic as if it were
"Citizen Kane."
Plavs today and tomorrow with "Real
Life "
I he Ra/or's Kdge (1946)
Castro, San Francisco
Somerset Maugham's novel concerned
I young man's spiritual quest, but in Ed
mund Goulding's film version (adapted
b\ I amar Trotti) the mystical revelations
are embarrassingly Hollywoodized and
incoherent, and the hero is played by
Tyrone Power, who turns from
whomever he's talking to to gaze ear
nestly at the camera whenever he feels
the call to spout profundities. When he
says. "1 don't think I'll ever be at peace
until I make up my mind about things,"
he scrunches up his face as if he were
trying to work out a crossword puzzle in
the Sunday Times; his fiancee. Gene
Tierney. replies. "Darling, this is so unex

pected," as if he'd brought an extra guest
home for dinner. Power goes off to Paris,
where he reads voraciously and attends
lectures at the Sorbonne. though the
movie neglects to mention the title of a
single book or the kind of courses he
might be sitting in on. A defrocked priest
in a bar (Fritz Kortner) sends him to
study with a holy man in India (Cecil
Humphreys, who is about as Indian as C.
Aubrey Smith); there he wanders into the
mountains, wears heavier jackets, and
sees God. Then he returns to Paris, where
his new-found inner strength and good
ness rescue Tierney's husband (John
Payne) from migraines and nearly save
his childhood friend, now a drunken
whore (Anne Baxter, plugging away for
her Oscar). It's a long movie (two-and-a
half hours), but it spans more than a de
cade, so characters keep filling in the
narrative gaps with lines like, "Haven't
you heard? He lost everything in the
Crash." Clifton Webb plays a sybarite
who answers a party invitation on his
death bed, Herbert Marshall plays Some
rset Maugham, and Lucile Watson and
Frank Latimore have small roles. But the
only person in the picture who does any
thing that might sensibly be called acting
is Elsa Lanchester, who is on screen for
approximately a minute and a half.
Plays tomorrow with "The Rains
Came."
Valley of the Dolls (1967)
Castro, San Francisco
Barbara Parkins, Patty Duke and
Sharon Tate play pill-poppers — a
model, a singing star and a sex siren who
wants to be considered an actress — in
this risible adaptation of the Jacqueline
Susann bestselling novel. When the book
came out, people got excited about which
of the characters was supposed to be
Marilyn Monroe and which Judy Garland
and Ethel Merman; little of that gossipy
junk appeal remains when the saga is
played out on the big screen, of course,
but there are other treats instead, like a
scene in which Duke, in a sanatorium to
"dry out," sings a duet with one-time
crooner who is dying of Huntington's
chorea. (Actually, Duke has most of the
melodramatic set pieces, including a cat
fight with Susan Hayward and a drunken
screaming fit outside a movie theater.)
The movie, written by Helen Deutsch
and Dorothy Kingsley and directed by
Mark Robson. is a camp classic — try not
to sec it in a somber (or sober) mood.
The catchy theme song (which has in
coherent lyrics) is sung by Dionne War
wick.
Plays Saturday with "Peyton Place."
Kiss of Death (1947)
Castro, San Francisco
This famous film noir. skilfully directed
by Henry Hathaway, features Victor Ma
ture as a tough con who agrees to
cooperate with the assistant D.A. (Brian
Donlevy) for the sake of his long
suffering wife (Colleen Gray), who
narrates the story. Mature tries his hand
at some real acting, but Richard Wid
mark steals the picture, in the role of
Tommy Udo. the slimiest psycho ever to
slither across the screen. (The conception
of James Woods in "The Onion Field" is
possibly a tribute to the Udo character.)
In the most memorable scene, he pushes
an old lady in a wheelchair down the
stairs. Ben Hecht and Charles Ledercr
supplied the highly entertaining purple
dialogue. With Karl Maiden and Taylor
Holmes.
Plays Mondav with "Call Northside
777."

The Young Lions (1958)
Castro, San Francisco
Pretty silly stuff, but enjoyable in a
glossy, trivial way. Marlon Brando plays a
German (with blond hair), and Dean
Martin and Montgomery CI if t play
Americans who fight in World War 11,
taking time out to dally with May Britt,
Barbara Rush and Hope Lange
(respectively). Brando employs his full
reserve of romantic charm, and he has
one moment of real depth, when he talks
about how the horrors of war have al
tered him. Gift is quite appealing as a
Jew scapegoated by the other men in his
outfit during basic training (though his
scenes are a virtual replay of "From Here
to Eternity"), and Martin is appealing,
too — though one wouldn't precisely call
what he does here "acting." Edward An
halt adapted this film from a popular Ir
win Shaw novel, and Edward Dmytryk
directed.
Plays Tuesday with "Decision Before
Dawn."
Stormy Weather (1943)
Castro, San Francisco
The script (by Frederick Jackson and
Ted Koehler) and direction (Andrew
Stone) are almost criminally stupid, but
no Hollywood musical ever featured so
many marvelous black performers; ter
rible as it is as filmmaking, it's an invalua
ble piece of black cultural history. Lena
Home sings "Stormy Weather" and Fats
Waller"Ain't Misbehavin' "; Ada Brown
accompanies Waller's band on "Baby,
Baby, What Is the Matter with You?";
Cab Calloway and the amazing Nicholas
Brothers perform "Jumpin" Jive"; and
Bill Robinson, Katharine Dunham and
her dance troupe, Dooley Wilson, Eddie
"Rochester" Anderson and Flournoy
Miller show up.
Plays Saturday, June 15, with "The
Gang's All Here."
Stolen Kisses (1968)
York, San Francisco
The second of Francois Truffaut's
"Antoine Doinel" tetralogy, starring
Jean-Pierre Leaud as the youthful hero.
The movie is sweet, and some scenes stay
with you for years, but Leaud can be an
exasperating performer. And the movie is
very slight, despite its inflated reputation.
With Michel Lonsdale and two ex
quisitely beautiful actresses, Delphine
Seyrig and Claude Jade. Truffaut wrote
the screenplay with Claude de Givray and
Bernhard Revon.
Plays Monday with "Day for Night."
The Chase (1966)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
Lurid, florid movie about violence
erupting in a small, restless Texas town,
adapted by Lillian Hellman (who later
renounced the movie and said her contri
bution had been overridden by the
producer, Sam Spiegel) from a Horton
Foote novel and directed by Arthur Penn
— who was not. to put it nicely, working
at the top of his form. It's a bad movie,
but it's certainly not boring: Robert Red
ford escapes from prison, his wife (Jane
Fonda) is carrying on with his best friend
(James Fox), the unhappily married son
of a millionaire (E.G. Marshall), whose
mean, repressed assistant (Robert
Duvall) has an oversexed, philandering
wife (Janice Rule) who hangs around
with a drunken redneck crowd. Got it?
Henry Hull and Miriam Hopkins add to
the madness, and Marlon Brando, who
plays the decent, liberal sheriff (married
to Angie Dickinson), nvtkes the fatal

mistake of taking it all too seriously. (It's
not one of his subversive self-parodies,
unfortunately.) Believe it or not, this
movie is meant to be About Something
— it's a reaction to the JFK assassination,
with a full panoply of vicious Texans just
brewing to start trouble. Considering this
premise, perhaps it's just as well the
movie's so easily dismissed.
Plays Saturday with "On the
Waterfront."
The Wild One (1954)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
"This was one of the key American films
of the 19505: It isn't very good, but it has
a great deal of energy and a classic per
formance by Marlon Brando as Johnny,
the anti-establishment biker millions of
young men identified with. The obvious
equivalent among movies of the next
moviegoing generation is "Easy Rider,"
but "The Wild One" is less masochistic
and depressive, and a lot more fun. John
Paxton's script (out of Frank Rooney's
story "The Cyclists' Raid." which was in
spired by an actual incident) contains a
very famous exchange: Mary Murphy
asks Brando, "What are you rebelling
against?" and he replies, "Whaddya
got?" With a very young Lee Marvin,
Robert Keith and Jay C. Flippen. Laslo
Benedek directed.
Plays Monday with "Easy Rider."
Viva Zapata! (1952)
Castro, San Francisco
Elia Kazan's vivid direction can't save
this movie from John Steinbeck's noble
liberal platitudes, but he certainly keeps
you watching, and so does Marlon
Brando as Einiliano Zapata, the Mexican
revolutionary leader. He isn't believable
as a Mexican — and in any case, his glis
tening make-up and drooping moustache
make him look more like a Chinese sage
— but his total masculine control pro
vides a center for the role, despite Stein
beck's insistence that Zapata asked his
wife (Jean Peters) to teach him how to
read on their wedding night. Joseph
Wiseman, Anthony Ouinn, Arnold Moss,
Margo, Frank Silvera and many others
make (mostly brief) appearances.
Plays Sunday with "Wild River."
The Innocents (1961)
Castro, San Francisco
Deborah Kerr gives a stunning perfor
mance as Flenry James' acutely sensitive
governess in this adaptation (by William
Archibald and Truman Capote) of "7"hc
Turn of the Screw": She preserves the
ambiguity of the character, who is either
a woman blessed with second sight or a
repressed spinster prone to fits of hys
teria. Jack Clayton directed this
memorable, frightening film, one of the
very best of the "literary" adaptations.
Freddie Francis did the prodigious pho
tography, Wilfrid Shingleton was the art
director, and the possibly haunted
children are played to horrifying perfec
tion by Pamela Franklin and Martin Step
hens.
Plays today with "The Lodger."
Day for Night (1973)
York, San Francisco
Francois Truffaut pays homage to the
banal programmers that the film industry
doesn't turn out anymore. The wonder is
that he actually bemoans their loss; the
bits we see from the director Fernand's
picture, "Meet Pamela," don't leave us
with the impression that anything
remarkable has cone out of movies. Truf

faut plays Fernand — an unnecessarily
cute touch — and in the most self
indulgent scene, we sec Fernand as a boy
stealing "Citizen Kane" stills from a local
cinema. "Day for Night'' (the title alludes
to a filmmaking term for shooting night
scenes during the day) is inoffensive,
pleasant enough, but rather sadly un
shaped and, except for Valentina Cor
tese's performance as an aging actress,
lacking in wit. You keep wishing Comden
and Green would step in and save the
picture. With Jean-Pierre Leaud, Jac
queline Bisset and Jean-Pierre Aumont.
Plays Monday with "Stolen Kisses."
The Gang's All Here (1943)
Castro, San Francisco
In this surrealistic, over-the-edge
Busby Berkeley musical (filmed in acid
trip Technicolor), Alice Faye sings the
lovely home front ballad "No Love, No
Nothin' " (by Leo Robin and Harry War
ren) and leads the finale, "The Polka Dot
Ballet," which defies description. Then
there are Benny Goodman and His Or
chestra, Charlotte Greenwood. Phil
Baker. Eugene Pallette, James Ellison,
Edward Everett Horton and the un
believable Carmen Miranda singing "The
Lady in the Tutti Frutti Hat" under a gar
gantuan painted cornucopia of a bonnet
that parodies every mad outfit she's ever
worn. Tutti frutti is right.
Plays Saturday. June 15, with "Stormy
Weather."
Under the Volcano (1984)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
Albert Finney has some great moments
as Malcolm Lowry's alcoholic consul —
he's much funnier than you might imag
ine — but the flat, attenuated movie
eventually sinks him. "Under the Vol
cano" is reportedly director John Hus
ton's favorite novel, but even if it were
filmable (which is highly doubtful), it
would require considerably more visual
imaginativeness than he and his photog
rapher, Conrad Hall, have brought to it;
not even Lowry's terrifying, predatory
Mexico is made to look interesting. In the
crucial roles of the consul's wife and half
brother. Jacqueline Bisset and Anthony
Andrews arc so languid that you might
think (if you hadn't read the novel) that
Lowry wrote a story about a poor bastard
whose family life is so dull that he takes
quite naturally to drink to enliven his
existence a little.
Plays Tuesday with "Wise Blood."
Inserts (1976)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley, and York, San
Francisco
John Byrum wrote and directed this
movie about a has-been filmmaker
(Richard Dreyfuss) making porno
features in the '30s. The subject sounds
promising, but the results are just about
as bad as a movie can be, cxcept for the
contributions of two actresses. Veronica
Cartwright and Jessica Harper. With Boh
Hoskins and Stephen Davies.
Plays Tuesday (York) with "Sunset
Blvd." and Thursday, June 13 (U.C.),
with "The King of Comedy."
Wild River (1960)
Castro, San Francisco
A strange, messy, memorable film
about the Tennessee Valley Authority —
some of it is quite marvelous and some of
it is calamitous. Jo Van Fleet plays an
obstinate octogenarian who won't move
off her land, though the T.V.A. plans to
flood it; Montgomery Clift is the T.V.A.

man who falls in love with her grand
daughter (Lee Remick). Van Fleet's per
formance might he better if she didn't
resort to a tremolo during her big
speeches, but it's really the screenwriter,
Paul Osborn, who does her in by giving
her a conscientious New York writer's
notion of southern farmer's dialogue: "I
like thinps runnin' wild . . . I'm agin bars
of any kind ... I ain't a-goin' against na
ture, and 1 ain't a-crawlin' to the dang
guv-mint." As for Gift, he could never
pull off good liberal roles; he's a dead
spot in the center of the movie, and such
an asexual presence that you can't believe
he's slept with Lee Remick even when
the director, Klia Kazan, spells it out for
you. Lee Remick gives half of a fresh per
formance, though (until she becomes in
volved with Clift). and there are good
contributions by Albert Salmi as a local
tough and Jay C. Flippen as one of Van
Fleet's sons; James Westerfield, Frank
Overton. Barbara Loden and (briefly)
Bruce Dern are here as well. As he did in
"Baby Doll" five years earlier, Kazan
uses local non-actors in a number of bit
roles, and almost all of them are splendid.
The photographer, Ellsworth Fredericks,
is largely responsible for some of the
most lyrical moments, including an idyllic
shot of a ferry raft floating across the
river that makes it achingly clear what
these people are giving up. Based on
novels by Borden Deal and William
Bradford Hale.
Plays Sunday with "Viva Zapata!"
The King of Comedy (1983)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
Robert De Niro plays Rupert Pupkin,
autograph hound and aspiring stand-up
comic, who kidnaps a Johnny Carson
style talk show host (Jerry Lewis) and
threatens to kill him unless Rupert can
open his show that evening. Jerry Lewis
gives a perceptive, lived-in performance,
but it's Rupert who is at the core of the
film, and Robert De Niro — though he
gets all the behavioral details of his char
acter dead right — is inscrutable in the
role. As his friend Masha, a groupie who
helps him in his scheme, gangly Sandra
Bernhard shows an aggressive, original
talent, but her scenes are pointlessly
creepy. Martin Scorsese's picture, with a
script by Paul D. Zimmerman, is ob
sessive and steamed-up, but you can't tell
what triggered so much anger and bitter
ness in the filmmakers, or even at whom
it is directed. They make severe emo
tional demands on us — to no apparent
purpose, though, and with little compen
sation offered.
Plays Thursday, June 13, with
"Inserts."
Laura (1944)
Castro, San Francisco
In which Dana Andrews plays a
detective who falls in love with a corpse.
Otto Preminger did such a polished job of
directing this highly amusing thriller that
you may wonder how it is that he's
botched almost everything he's filmed
since. Gene Tierney, Vincent Price.
Judith Anderson and, in an Oscar Wit—
dean role, Clifton Webb co-star, but it's
Dana Andrews' haunted tough guy brio
that gives the film its emotional center.
Script by Jay Dratler, Samuel Wot- "
fenstein and Betty Reinhardt, based on a
Vera Caspary novel; David Raksin wrote
the famous, memorable theme song.
Plays Thursday, June 13, with "Leave
Her to Heaven."
From Here to Eternity (1953)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
One of the two or three best American
movies of the early '50s. Daniel Taradash
adapted James Jones' bestseller about
soldiers stationed at Pearl Harbor just
before the Japanese attack in 1941, and
Fred Zinnemann directed, beautifully.
The extraordinary cast includes
Montgomery Clift (giving his greatest
performance) as the sensitive bugler
Pruitt; Burt Lancaster as the sergeant in
love with his captain's wife, played by
Deborah Kerr; Frank Sinatra as mouthy,
appealing Maggio; Donna Reed as the
nightclub "hostess" (a Hays Code eup
hemism) in love with Pruitt; and Ernest
Borgnine as the evil bully in charge of the
stockade. Among the sequences movie
lovers have cherished for years are
Lancaster's first advance to Kerr; the
love scene on the beach (memorably
spoofed by Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca
on TV); the communal drunk scene that
climaxes in Maggio's death; and — most
moving of all — Pruitt's bugle tribute to
his dead buddy. The haunting melody
sung in the drunk scene is "Re-enlistment
Blues."
Plays tonight with "Bonjour Tris
tesse."
Children of Paradise (1945)
York, San Francisco
Perhaps the most beloved "art" film of
all time — at least in this country. The
setting is Paris in the early 19th century;
the characters are actors and mimes; the
theme is the relationship between life and
art. Jean-Louis Trintignant plays Baptiste
Deburau. the mime; the incomparable
beauty Arletty is Garance, whom he
adores; Pierre Brasseur is Lemaitre.
whose mistress she is; and Maria Casares
is the actress who worships Baptiste.
I hey are all splendid. Marcel Carne di
rected. and the poet Jacques Prevcrt,
( arne s frequent collaborator, wrote the
screenplay.
Plays Wednesday, June 12, with "The
Red Balloon."
Steve Vine berg (1951)
Little I heater, the Coffee House, The
Daily and various other Stanford venues
Be sure to catch this noted critic before
his long local run ends (e.g., page 24 of
today's Daily). His outrageous opinions,
pithy put-downs, powerful profundities
and long paragraphs have made him a
don t-miss, boffo-socko box office smash
and sure-fire Oscar nominee. The kind of
critic they don't make anymore, the kind
of critic you've been waiting for — and
now he s leaving. Produced by Canada,
directed by the Drama Department; art
direction was by Laurence Maslon and
Mark Wilson, and the let-well-enough
alone editing by a tag-team c-ew that in
cluded Mike Hale, Tony Kelly, Elaine
Wang, laeza Pierce and Greg Weingar
ten.
Plays through June.
