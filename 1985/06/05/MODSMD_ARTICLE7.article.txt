Beirut battle snaps brief cease-fire
BEIRUT — Christian and Moslem militiamen fought across the
Green Line dividing the capital yesterday, shattering a brief cease-fire,
and new battles were reported in the Shiite Moslem drive to overrun
Palestiriian refugee camps.
Militia leaders called a cease-fire at the Green Line in the morning
and declared the Museum Crossing open for the first time in five weeks.
But 30 minutes later, Lebanese soldiers guarding both ends of the
road threw down barbed-wire coils, blocking the crossing, as machine
guns started firing.
Residential districts in central Beirut shook as the rival factions
opened fire with tank cannon and rocket-propelled grenades.
Some 250 people have been killed since April, when the latest surge
of violence along the three-mile line that separates Christian east Beirut
and Moslem west Beirut began.
In the battle of the refugee camps, Palestinian spokesmen said guerril
las beat back three attempts by Shiite forces to push into the Chatilla
camp. The Shiites overran Beirut's Sabra camp on Friday.
The spokesmen, who spoke on condition he not be identified, said the
attackers struck from three sides of Chatilla under covering barrages
from U.S.-made tanks, mortars and machine guns.
The Palestinians engaged in hand-to-hand battles in the streets as
Shiite Amal militiamen and soldiers of the Lebanese army's overwhelm
ingly Shiite Sixth Brigade moved in, the spokesman said.
U.S. recommends envoys to Israel
JERUSALEM — The United States has given Israel the names of
seven Palestinians for consideration as possible members of a Jordanian-
Palestinian delegation to Middle East peace talks, a government official
said yesterday.
The names were submitted unofficially three weeks ago to Prime Min
ister Shimon Peres, but had not been formally approved by Jordan or the
Palestine Liberation Organization, said the Israeli official. He spoke on
condition he not be identified.
One proposed name was Abdel Hamid al-Sayegh, speaker of the
Palestine National Council, the PLO's legislative arm. The others were
three leaders from Israeli-occupied territories and three Palestinian pro
fessors living abroad, said the official.
He said Peres had not discussed the names with his coalition govern
ment because the list was not a formal proposal that required an Israeli
decision.
Peres also fears a premature discussion of specific names could ag
gravate tensions in the ruling coalition, which is divided over whether a
council member like al-Sayegh could sit at the bargaining table.
The United States and Israel refuse to deal with the PLO, which has
called for Israel's destruction. Israeli officials have differed in public
over whether members of the Palestine National Council, some of whom
are not affiliated with PLO guerrilla factions, would be acceptable as
negotiators.
Israel radio reported that U.S. Ambassador Samuel Lewis, before his
retirement last week, gave the list to Peres. A U.S. diplomatic source
said Lewis discussed names that previously had been "floated" by Pales
tinian officials, but offered no new list.
There was no immediate comment from the State Department on the
reports.
Gandhi criticizes FBI silence
NEW DELHI, India — Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi criticized the
FBI yesterday for not telling his government that the Sikh terrorists who
were planning to assassinate him also intended to blow up a nuclear
power plant in India.
In mid-May, the FBI announced that it foiled a plot to kill Gandhi
while he was in the United States, and had arrested five Sikhs. It said an
undercover agent infiltrated the Sikh gang and promised to help acquire
arms and explosives for terrorist acts.
"The FBI had been involved in giving them training for the particular
act they wanted to carry out," Gandhi said. "In certain cases, the people
who were giving this clandestine training were in touch with the FBI."
He did not elaborate, but apparently was referring to the FBI infiltra
tion.
In Washington, FBI spokesman Lane Bonner said he saw the prime
minister's statements as recognition that the FBI "successfully inter
dicted a terrorist action before it could come to fruition and before any
lives were lost. After all, that is the objective of our terrorism program,
as Director (William) Webster has stated on many occasions."
Gandhi added that "we are now satisfied" the United States will do all
it can to help combat terrorism by Sikh extremists. He spoke to Ameri
can reporters before a trip to Egypt, France, Algeria and the United
States, where he is scheduled to arrive June 11. He will have left today.
Sikhs, fighting for a homeland for the religious minority in Punjab, are
accused of assassinating Gandhi's mother, Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi, and of other violent acts.
The prime minister said the FBI had been in touch with alleged Sikh
terrorists since last November. The agency had information that the ter
rorists were planning to blow up an Indian nuclear power plant, he said,
"but we were not told anything of this."
Even if it was difficult to reveal details of the assassination plot in ad
vance, Gandhi said, "they should have told us about an attempt on our
nuclear power plant."
Belfast turns into boom town
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Downtown on a Thursday night the
streets are crowded with late-night shoppers. The restaurants and pubs
are packed. Buses roar in and out of the shopping area, carrying a con
stant flow of people.
To many, Belfast is still synonymous with Beirut and Saigon as a city
of bombs and bloodshed; today's atmosphere, however, is one of
recovery and optimism.
Gone arc the bomb-blasted facades, the deserted streets and the
armed patrols. The city center is transforming itself into a bright and
prosperous place, "bouncing back to health and strength," in the words
of its main newspaper, the Belfast Telegraph.
Officials attribute Belfast's change to a marked decrease in bombings
by the Irish Republican Army, coupled with a huge influx of aid from the
British government. While mainland British cities chafe under Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's fiscal conservatism, Belfast has received
more than $1 billion dollars in the past five years.
Between 1982 and 1984, more than 140 restaurants and fast-food
stands have opened in the city. Brian West, who owns the popular Elbow
bar on the Dublin Road, said that four years ago he wouldn't have im
agined opening shop in Belfast. Now he is completing a $500,000 exten
sion and adding a restaurant.
Most of the major department stores have undertaken major im
provements. C and A has reopened the floor it shut at the height of the
troubles. Marks and Spencer's Belfast store is the chain's second busiest
in Britain and has just doubled its floor space.
Another big boost is the Royal-Avenue-Smithfield project, a $50 mil
lion operation to tear down derelict buildings in the city center and build
a two-tiered shopping complex, department store and multi-story
parking garage.
Alleged anti-Semite tried in Canada
RED DEER. Alberta — A former social studies instructor, fired for
teaching his high school classes that a Jewish conspiracy aims to enslave
the world, is now in court fighting charges of promoting hatred among
his students.
James Keegstra, who has been testifying in his own defense for more
than a week, is trying to persuade the jury of 10 men and two women
that his teachings were true — or at least, that he had reasonable
grounds to believe them.
"The Jews are in control of the movies, the finance, the media,"
Keegstra said from the witness box in the Alberta Court of Queen's
Bench, where the trial in in its third month. "They seek one-world
domination."

"The FBI had been involved in giving them training for the particular
act they wanted to carry out," Gandhi said. "In certain cases, the people
who were giving this clandestine training were in touch with the FBI."
He did not elaborate, but apparently was referring to the FBI infiltra
tion.
In Washington, FBI spokesman Lane Bonner said he saw the prime
minister's statements as recognition that the FBI "successfully inter
dicted a terrorist action before it could come to fruition and before any
lives were lost. After all, that is the objective of our terrorism program,
as Director (William) Webster has stated on many occasions."
Gandhi added that "we are now satisfied" the United States will do all
it can to help combat terrorism by Sikh extremists. He spoke to Ameri
can reporters before a trip to Egypt, France, Algeria and the United
States, where he is scheduled to arrive June 11. He will have left today.
Sikhs, fighting for a homeland for the religious minority in Punjab, are
accused of assassinating Gandhi's mother, Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi, and of other violent acts.
The prime minister said the FBI had been in touch with alleged Sikh
terrorists since last November. The agency had information that the ter
rorists were planning to blow up an Indian nuclear power plant, he said,
"but we were not told anything of this."
Even if it was difficult to reveal details of the assassination plot in ad
vance, Gandhi said, "they should have told us about an attempt on our
nuclear power plant."
Belfast turns into boom town
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Downtown on a Thursday night the
streets are crowded with late-night shoppers. The restaurants and pubs
are packed. Buses roar in and out of the shopping area, carrying a con
stant flow of people.
To many, Belfast is still synonymous with Beirut and Saigon as a city
of bombs and bloodshed; today's atmosphere, however, is one of
recovery and optimism.
Gone arc the bomb-blasted facades, the deserted streets and the
armed patrols. The city center is transforming itself into a bright and
prosperous place, "bouncing back to health and strength," in the words
of its main newspaper, the Belfast Telegraph.
Officials attribute Belfast's change to a marked decrease in bombings
by the Irish Republican Army, coupled with a huge influx of aid from the
British government. While mainland British cities chafe under Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's fiscal conservatism, Belfast has received
more than $1 billion dollars in the past five years.
Between 1982 and 1984, more than 140 restaurants and fast-food
stands have opened in the city. Brian West, who owns the popular Elbow
bar on the Dublin Road, said that four years ago he wouldn't have im
agined opening shop in Belfast. Now he is completing a $500,000 exten
sion and adding a restaurant.
Most of the major department stores have undertaken major im
provements. C and A has reopened the floor it shut at the height of the
troubles. Marks and Spencer's Belfast store is the chain's second busiest
in Britain and has just doubled its floor space.
Another big boost is the Royal-Avenue-Smithfield project, a $50 mil
lion operation to tear down derelict buildings in the city center and build
a two-tiered shopping complex, department store and multi-story
parking garage.
Alleged anti-Semite tried in Canada
RED DEER. Alberta — A former social studies instructor, fired for
teaching his high school classes that a Jewish conspiracy aims to enslave
the world, is now in court fighting charges of promoting hatred among
his students.
James Keegstra, who has been testifying in his own defense for more
than a week, is trying to persuade the jury of 10 men and two women
that his teachings were true — or at least, that he had reasonable
grounds to believe them.
"The Jews are in control of the movies, the finance, the media,"
Keegstra said from the witness box in the Alberta Court of Queen's
Bench, where the trial in in its third month. "They seek one-world
domination."
Beirut battle snaps brief cease-fire
BEIRUT — Christian and Moslem militiamen fought across the
Green Line dividing the capital yesterday, shattering a brief cease-fire,
and new battles were reported in the Shiite Moslem drive to overrun
Palestiriian refugee camps.
Militia leaders called a cease-fire at the Green Line in the morning
and declared the Museum Crossing open for the first time in five weeks.
But 30 minutes later, Lebanese soldiers guarding both ends of the
road threw down barbed-wire coils, blocking the crossing, as machine
guns started firing.
Residential districts in central Beirut shook as the rival factions
opened fire with tank cannon and rocket-propelled grenades.
Some 250 people have been killed since April, when the latest surge
of violence along the three-mile line that separates Christian east Beirut
and Moslem west Beirut began.
In the battle of the refugee camps, Palestinian spokesmen said guerril
las beat back three attempts by Shiite forces to push into the Chatilla
camp. The Shiites overran Beirut's Sabra camp on Friday.
The spokesmen, who spoke on condition he not be identified, said the
attackers struck from three sides of Chatilla under covering barrages
from U.S.-made tanks, mortars and machine guns.
The Palestinians engaged in hand-to-hand battles in the streets as
Shiite Amal militiamen and soldiers of the Lebanese army's overwhelm
ingly Shiite Sixth Brigade moved in, the spokesman said.
U.S. recommends envoys to Israel
JERUSALEM — The United States has given Israel the names of
seven Palestinians for consideration as possible members of a Jordanian-
Palestinian delegation to Middle East peace talks, a government official
said yesterday.
The names were submitted unofficially three weeks ago to Prime Min
ister Shimon Peres, but had not been formally approved by Jordan or the
Palestine Liberation Organization, said the Israeli official. He spoke on
condition he not be identified.
One proposed name was Abdel Hamid al-Sayegh, speaker of the
Palestine National Council, the PLO's legislative arm. The others were
three leaders from Israeli-occupied territories and three Palestinian pro
fessors living abroad, said the official.
He said Peres had not discussed the names with his coalition govern
ment because the list was not a formal proposal that required an Israeli
decision.
Peres also fears a premature discussion of specific names could ag
gravate tensions in the ruling coalition, which is divided over whether a
council member like al-Sayegh could sit at the bargaining table.
The United States and Israel refuse to deal with the PLO, which has
called for Israel's destruction. Israeli officials have differed in public
over whether members of the Palestine National Council, some of whom
are not affiliated with PLO guerrilla factions, would be acceptable as
negotiators.
Israel radio reported that U.S. Ambassador Samuel Lewis, before his
retirement last week, gave the list to Peres. A U.S. diplomatic source
said Lewis discussed names that previously had been "floated" by Pales
tinian officials, but offered no new list.
There was no immediate comment from the State Department on the
reports.
Gandhi criticizes FBI silence
NEW DELHI, India — Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi criticized the
FBI yesterday for not telling his government that the Sikh terrorists who
were planning to assassinate him also intended to blow up a nuclear
power plant in India.
In mid-May, the FBI announced that it foiled a plot to kill Gandhi
while he was in the United States, and had arrested five Sikhs. It said an
undercover agent infiltrated the Sikh gang and promised to help acquire
arms and explosives for terrorist acts.
"The FBI had been involved in giving them training for the particular
act they wanted to carry out," Gandhi said. "In certain cases, the people
who were giving this clandestine training were in touch with the FBI."
