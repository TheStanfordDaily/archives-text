# Burger dissents from 6-3 decision
## Court re-affirms prayer ban 
### 
WASHINGTON — Strongly reaffirming its
1962 ban on organized prayer in public schools, the
Supreme Court yesterday outlawed daily moments
of silence if students are told they may pray during
that time.
By a 6-3 vote, the justices ruled that an Alabama
law allowing such periods for " meditation or volun
tary prayer" by public school students violated the
constitutionally required separation of church and
state.
The decision does not necessarily mean that
every state law providing for such daily moments of
silence is invalid. If the law does not mention
"prayer" — and if state legislators did not intend
the law to endorse school prayer — it is valid.
About half the states have moment-of-silence
laws, but not all of them mention prayer. For exam
ple, Arizona and Connecticut laws provide for
"silent meditation" without mentioning prayer. A
Louisiana law states that the "brief time of silent
meditation shall not be intended or identified as a
religious exercise."
Writing for the court, Justice John Paul Stevens
said, "The addition of 'or voluntary prayer' indi
cates that the state intended to characterize prayer
as a favored practice. Such an endorsement is not
consistent with the established principle that the

government must pursue a course of complete
neutrality toward religion."
The case was as politically charged as any on the
high court's docket this year. Numerous political
candidates in 1984 — including President Reagan
— called for a return of organized prayer in public
schools.
The Reagan administration, entering the Ala
bama case as a "friend of the court," told the
justices that such state laws "enhance the opportu
nity for students to include silent prayer as part of
their activities at
President Reagan favors a constitutional amend
ment that would, in effect, overturn the Supreme
Court's 1962 decision.
The 1962 ruling did not outlaw "voluntary
prayers" in public schools. As one pro-prayer adv
ocate explained, "You can hardly engage in
thought control."
The court's ruling 23 years ago drew the line at
official sponsorship of prayer sessions. Even with
out moment-of-silence laws, no state or court can
prevent any student from engaging in silent prayer.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes said he
would not comment on the ruling.
Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), another backer
of a constitutional amendment to allow school

prayer sessions, called the decision "unfortunate
and unfair."
Dan Alexander, former president of the Mobile,
Ala., County School Board and now head of a pro
prayer organization called Save Our Schools, called
the ruling a disappointment.
The ruling had its enthusiastic backers as well.
Sen. Lowell Weicker (R-Conn.) said, "The
court's decision reaffirms that, uniquely in the
United States, religion is a matter personal to each
of us and not the business of government."
Charles Sims, an American Civil Liberties Union
lawyer in New York City, praised the decision and
said its importance will transcend the school-prayer
controversy.
Joining Stevens in Tuesday's ruling were Justices
William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Harry
Blackmun and Lewis Powell. Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor agreed, in a separate opinion, that the
Alabama law was invalid.
Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justices Byron
White and William Rehnquist dissented — each
writing a separate opinion for himself.
In another decision, the court ruled 7-2 that food
stamp recipients were given adequate warning that
their benefits would be reduced or eliminated un
der 1981 Reagan administration budget cuts.
