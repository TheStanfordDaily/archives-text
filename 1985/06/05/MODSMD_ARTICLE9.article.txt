# Senate may change Reagan tax plan
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” Republican
leaders told President Reagan yester
day that Congress can pass tax
overhaul legislation this year, but
they indicated there will be changes
from the proposals he unveiled last
week.
Later, in a brief meeting with busi
ness executives, Reagan acknowl
edged his tax plan "isn't perfect . . .
but we believe that it'll work."
During the session with GOP
leaders, the chairman of the tax
writing Senate Finance Committee
indicated that he might seek lowering
the top individual tax rate to 25 per
cent instead of the 35 percent the
president proposed.
Meanwhile, the corporate execu
tives, on Capitol Hill and later at the
White House session, said the plan
has broad support, but they, too, saw
room for improvements.
"The time for tax reform is now,"
John Richman, chairman of
Dart & Kraft Inc., told the House
Ways and Means Committee. "The
public wants tax reform . . . and I am
here today to tell you that the main
stream of American business is on
your side."

Reagan addressed the executives
later at the White House as he contin
ued a sales campaign that was going
on the road for stops in Oklahoma
City, Atlanta and Birmingham, Ala.,
today and tomorrow.
The president talked with the nine
executives for about five minutes,
thanking them for their supportive
testimony at the Ways and Means
Committee and adding that he was
counting on their support in fighting
off "an army of lobbyists" who might
try to derail his tax proposals.
Earlier, Reagan had his first
meeting with Republican leaders
from the House and Senate since he
outlined proposals last week to gen
erally reduce individual and corpor
ate tax rates, change or eliminate a
variety of tax breaks and somewhat
increase the tax burdens on business.
Afterward, the legislators agreed
that action was possible this year.
Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.), the
Finance Committee chairman, said,
"I indicated to him (Reagan) I would
like to get the individual rates down
to 25 percent and hoped that at least I
could have a plan to do that that
would" not add to the budget deficit.
