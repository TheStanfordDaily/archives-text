# Commencement history
## The
						94-year tradition continues 
### TIM GRIEVE Editorial staff 
Commencement is 94 years old
this weekend. That's older than
Memorial Church. Older than
Hoover Tower. Older than "All
Right Now." Even older than
jokes about band members who
can't tackle.
For a university almost entirely
devoid of tradition, Comrpence
ment is something special. Al
though its purpose has remained
fundamentally unchanged, its
style has evolved considerably
during the first 93 years.
Stanford's first Commence
ment exercises were held in the
temporary, unfinished frame of
Roble Gym, which was decorated
with flowers and evergreens to
mask its half-finished appear
ance.
Until 1937, though. Com
mencement exercises, with a few
notable exceptions, were held in
Memorial Church. Perhaps the
most notable of those notable ex
ceptions came in 1935, when U.S.
President Herbert Hoover, a
graduate of Stanford's first class
who gained notoriety for forget
ting to take the football to the
first Big Game, attracted 15,000
people to Commencement exer
cises in Stanford Stadium.
But as the '30s moved on, Stan
ford Commencement crowds out
grew the confines of the church,
forcing the 1937 move to Frost
Amphitheatre, where Com
mencement was held until last
year.
Fifteen thousand wasn't much
for the 85,000-seat stadium in
1935, but the estimated 17,000
who packed Commencement
1983 were way too many for
Frost, which was designed to hold
only about 10,000.
Controversy surrounded the
decision to move Commencement
from Frost last year. No one
really wanted to leave Frost — a
grassy, stepped oval tucked in a
grove of trees that was somehow
a perfect way to end a Stanford
career — but most realized that
the amphitheater was too small to
hold the masses.
The decision, then, came down
to a choice between Sunken Dia
mond and the stadium. For many,
the miles of bleachers in the
stadium seemed too daunting, too
impersonal and too empty for a
typically "intimate" Stanford
Commencement, so Sunken Dia
mond won out.
That decision wasn't perman
ent, though. This year, University
President Donald Kennedy and

the senior class presidents opted
for Stanford Stadium.
The University has spent a
good part of the year designing
stages and other props to make
the stadium look less empty and
more attractive for this year's
ceremonies.
As many as 35,000 people are
expected to be on hand Sunday,
in no small part due to the
notoriety of the Commencement
speaker. New York. Gov. Mario
Cuomo.
Cuomo, one of the nation's
most popular graduation speakers
this year, is the latest in an in
creasing prestigious lineup of
Commencement speakers here.
Early Commencement adresses
were given almost exclusively by
Stanford presidents and other
University officials. But during
the last 10 years, Stanford has
drawn more nationally prominent
speakers to campus. Notable
speakers during the 1970s in
cluded Watergate Special Prose
cutor Archibald Cox in 1974 and
two U.N. ambassadors, Daniel
Patrick Moynihan in 1975 and
Andrew Young in 1979.
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
Warren Christopher, who will al
most certainly become the next
president of Stanford's Board of
Trustees, spoke to graduates in

1981. Supreme Court Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor, a Stan
ford alumnae, was the Com
mencement speaker in 1982. In
1983, Secretary of State George
Shultz, a campus resident and
Graduate School of Business pro
fessor, spoke to graduates, many
of whom wore armbands to
protests the Reagan administra
tion's actions on human rights

abroad, especially in Central
America. Last year. Rockefeller
Foundation President Richard
Lyman, Kennedy's predecessor as
University president, spoke to
graduates in Sunken Diamond.
Cuomo represents a return to
the realm of government officials
as Commencement speakers
here, a move which should come
as no surprise given Kennedy's

continuing emphasis on govern
ment and public-service work.
If Cuomo's moving speach at
the 1984 Democratic Convention
up the road in San Francisco is
any indication of the kind of per
formance he'll put on here, the
1986 Commencement speaker
will have a tough act to follow
indeed.
