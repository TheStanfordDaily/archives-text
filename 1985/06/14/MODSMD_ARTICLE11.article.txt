Due to a lack of creative impulse,
this advertisement for summer writ
ers and columnists will be
straightforward and dull.
But that is not the way your sum
mer will go if you work here.
Honest.

No sir, come in and chat with
Mark Zeigler or Jennifer Koch
about writing, and you'll also be en
listing for a summer of Daily Terror
softball, mid-evening barbeques,
and a few happy hours.

And there's no telling what
surprises Opinions Editor Marsh
McCall will bestow upon you should
you drop a sample column by The
Daily offices.
Come by and give us a try â€” you
won't be disappointed.

Sample column deadline is June 17
