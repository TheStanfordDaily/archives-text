A place not to miss while at Stanford is the newly
dedicated B. Gerald Cantor Rodin Sculpture Gar
den. The garden was named in honor of Cantor, the
Los Angeles financier who in donating or promising
all the sculptures for the garden, was the project's
prinipal benefactor.
The one-acre garden, adjacent to the Stanford
Art Museum, is now the permanent display sight of
20 Rodin sculptures and the showcase for the Uni
versity's Rodin collection. The University is the
world's second largest repository of work by Rodin
and the only major U.S. university with both a
sculpture garden and a campus-wide program of
modern sculpture, according to Art History Prof.
Albert Elsen, curator of the campus Rodin collec
tion.
Designed by architect Robert Mittelstadt, the
garden duplicates the type of outdoor environment
in which Rodin displayed his work. The garden is
connected to the B. Gerald Cantor Rotunda,
making the site an unique indoor-outdoor installa

tion of of the artist's work.
"The Gates of Hell" preside over the garden, in
stalled as a symbolic entrance to the rotunda. The
southern court contains Rodin s monuments to ar
tists, including "The Monument to Bastien Lepage"
and "Claude Lorraine," rarely seen outside Paris.
The southern circular area of the western terrace
will house the complete monument to "The Bur
ghers of Calais," which is expected to be installed in
the near future, plus two enlarged heads from the
work. In the center of the garden is "The Age of
Bronze," Rodin's first work as a sculptor.
The outdoor garden is free to the public and open
and lighted 24 hours a day, year-round. A special
lighting system is expected to be installed so that
nighttime spectators will be able to gaze at the
sculptures from t elow — as was the case in Rodin's
studio.
In accordance with Rodin's preference for ex
hibiting his work among flowers, the garden has
been fully landscaped with a plethora of flower
beds,.which will be changed seasonally.
