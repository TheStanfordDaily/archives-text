# A 						senior's look at Commencement
## 
### SANDRA BODOVITZ 
It's all right now.
For four years we've yelled
these words at football games and
at rallies. We've kissed under full
moons in the Quad as the Band
played. But come June 16, we
should be yelling "It's all over
now" instead.
Having finished my finals early,
I ve had more time than I needed
to reflect on what graduation
means. And to tell you the truth, I
still don't know.
A part of me does see it as an
ending. There's no doubt that
when the resident assistants in
Roble Hall showed their end-of
the-year slide show, there were a
lot of teary-eyed people in the
room. Of course it was mostly the
freshmen who were crying. The
seniors just sat there looking
dazed. For some, it was the first
realization that it was all coming
to a close.
For others, seeing "The
Graduate" at Sunday Night Flicks
was the turning point. For me,
that movie has never had more
meaning.
How many times have people
tried to tell you what career to
choose? Or asked you what
you're going to do? Dustin Hof
fman's response that he's just
floating along is the same answer
I've wanted to give for a long
time.
My solution is to wear a button
that says,"I don't know what I'm
going to do after I graduate." But
I sometimes even that's not
enough.

Sometimes I don't want to have
to face next year without Stanford
at all, and other times I think I'm
ready to. It reminds me of my first
day here. I approached Branner
Hall with the same mixture of
fear and anticipation with which I
now approach my future.
Fear because I'm leaving a
place I feel comfortable in, and
because I'm leaving all of the
friends I made here. Of course
that sounds sappy, but I think it's
part of graduating. You need to
look back and evaluate what
you've done here, and what
you've gained. It's your chance to
do that, and although it's
sometimes painful, it can also be
inspiring.
That's where the anticipation
part comes in. And that's why
part of me can see it as a begin
ning rather than an ending. Just
as I anticipated what Stanford
would be like, I can now an
ticipate what life away from Stan
ford will be like. But I can never
know what life without Stanford
will be because I'm taking so
much of it with me when I go.
I'm taking all the physical
things: the T-shirts, two Stanford
Daily mugs, the"I hate Cal" but
tons and, of course, my diploma.
But even more important, I'm
taking away a lot of experiences
and, believe it or not, some edu
cation.
I don't think I'd be alone if I
said academics have not always
been my first priority here. At
times it's been more important to
stay up late talking with a friend
or putting my energy into an ex
tracurricular activity.

As everyone tells you, college
is more than just academics. And
I, for one, have lived by that
credo.
It's really the experiences, of all
sorts, that are the most valuable
things I'm taking away from here.
Freshman year I was a typical
freshman. There's something
about hearing Dean Fred say that
he could've filled the class with
4.0, 1600 SAT scorers that made
me wonder what I was doing
here. In fact, a lot of freshman
year was like that: just getting my
bearings, learning when to jump
during "All Right Now" and
learning what fro yo and Mem
Chu meant.
By sophomore year I'd learned
the ropes. There are few things
better than the feeling of seeing
all your friends from freshman
year at the first all-campus party
in September. When you recog
nize more than five people in the
sea of tanned faces, you know
you've arrived. You've made it
through the initiation.
But along with knowing the
ropes come some new knots. Al
though you no longer get lost
going from your dorm to the li
brary, you start to wonder what
college is all about. Because you
no longer have to be concerned
about things like sitting through
every band at Splendor on the
Grass, more academic concerns,
like choosing a major, can lead to
what has fondly been termed
"sophomore slump."
No matter how many times you
go to Cowell and how many times
they tell you that it might be
mono â€” come back in six weeks,

there's only one sure cure for
sophomore slump: becoming a
junior.
For me, junior year was simply
a great year. By junior year
you've arrived. You've found
your niche at Stanford. So what is
there left to do besides head over
seas to make you're mark on the
rest of the world?
Stanford has been a great place
to go to school in many ways, but
one thing that has made an im
pact on everyone who has partici
pated in them are the overseas
programs. Being 3,000 miles
away from Stanford with 40 other
students is a great combination. 1
guess the thing I liked best is that
academics could really come
second without too much
rationalization. After all, even
going out for dinner was a cul
turally significant experience.
And for those of us in France, so
was wine tasting.
And that brings us to senior
year. Perhaps the most fun, the
fullest, and the most traumatic
year of all.
Senior year has meant
weekends at Sierra Camp, senior
pub nights, and late nights at the
University Creamery. It's also
meant interviews, interviews and
interviews. The job search, for
many of us, has been extensive
and exhausting. For those who
have definite plans, the problem
becomes trying to reconcile one's
life here to images of one's future.
And for those of us without defi
nite plans, the future looms large
and uncertain. But at least for me,
it's time to move on.
One thing I've learned at Stan
ford is to push myself. I've been
the happiest here when I've been
the busiest. We've all gotten a lot

out of Stanford and we've all put
a lot back into it, whether it's
been through sports or academics
or extracurricular activities.
But whether I see it as an end
or as a beginning, it's time to push
myself again. Letting go is hard.
It's hard to say good-bye, and I've
never been good at doing it. But
the time is now. And I guess "It's
all right now" after all.
