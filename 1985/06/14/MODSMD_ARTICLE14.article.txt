# 1985: Reagan, rallies, renovations
## 
### MARK LAWRKNCE 
From a fall visit by presidential
candidate Walter Mondale to a
month-long spring sit-in by stu
dents protesting University in
vestments in companies that do
business in South Africa, it was a
busy year here on The Farm.
Among the diverse news items
of this year, the Super Bowl came
to Stanford Stadium, students
voted overwhelmingly for

Mondale in the fall election
despite Ronald Reagan's
landslide victory, the University
proposed a plan to renovate
several science and engineering
buildings, the Board of Trustees
approved a site for the Ronald
Reagan Presidential Library, Sen.
Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.)
spoke at a student-organized con
ference on world hunger, and stu
dents protested a visit by a
photographer from Playboy mag
azine.
Here is a look back at these,
the top stories of this year:
Protesters call for divestment
In response to the call for a

nationwide day of protest on
April 24, a coalition of students
from various progressive campus
groups organized a rally in White
Plaza and a sit-in outside Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy's
office to protest University in
vestments in companies that do
business in South Africa.
Protesters claimed that the com
panies support the South African
government's apartheid policy by

operating in the country.
Stanford was one of more than
120 colleges across the country
that held protests, rallies and
forums on the issue of divestment
in a movement that caused many
observers to recall the protests of
the 19605.
Because of what the protesters,
a group calling itself Stanford Out
of South Africa (SOSA), felt was
insufficient action on the part of
Kennedy and the trustees, stu
dents were still sitting in and
sleeping in the Quad a month
later and are planning long-term
strategy for bringing about total
divestment of Stanford's South
Africa-related stock. During the
first few nights of the sit-in, about

250 students slept in the Quad.
Also in the course of the
protest, nine students were ar
rested on May 28 for sitting in the
Bursar's Office in Old Union
after the building closed. The stu
dents, most of whom were
released three days later, are cur
rently awaiting trial. Protesters
also risked being arrested when,
beginning on May 14, they at
tempted to prevent trustees from
leaving campus after a board
meeting. The action, which ended
two days later, followed after a
meeting at which trustees took no
action on the call for total divest
ment.
Kennedy and the trustees have
repeatedly expressed concern
about the problem of apartheid,
but say total divestment by the
University is not the proper ap
proach to the problem. Kennedy
has suggested that legislative
methods are more appropriate.
Mondale campaigns on The Farm
Calling his appearance "the
beginning of the Mondale-
Ferraro victory march," presiden
tial challenger Walter "Fritz"
Mondale made a campaign ap
pearance here on October 16 and
attacked the Reagan administra
tion for what he called its "naive
and primitive notion of national
strength."
Mondale, in his 20 minute
speech, told a loud and congested
Memorial Auditorium crowd that
Reagan is "out of touch with
reality" and "uninformed" and
"confused" on matters of foreign
policy.
The 2,000 spectators who
managed to get into the
auditorium were forced to wait
outside in the drenching rain
along with another 3,000 to 5,000
who were turned away when the
hall filled. The speech was
originally scheduled for White
Plaza, but plans had to be can
celled at the last minute because
of the rain. The crowd then had to
wait for nearly two hours while

the building was prepared for the
rally.
Once inside, the enthusiastic
crowd joined with Sen. Gary Hart
(D-Colo.) and Mondale in
criticizing Reagan for what
Mondale called Reagan's "record
of profound confusion."
"Mr. Reagan may know for
sure that he can recall a missile
after it has been launched, but it
just ain't so ... . And Mr. Presi
dent, you may think you've won
this election but it just ain't so,"
Mondale said, as the crowd
joined him in the refrain.
Stanford hosts Super Bowl XIX
On Super Sunday, January 20,
the eyes of the world were on
Stanford Stadium, the site of the
1985 championship game of the
National Football League —
Super Bowl XIX.
On the strength of the passing
of Joe Montana, the 49ers' quar
terback and the game's most
valuable player, and the 49er
defense, the San Francisco 49ers
blew out the Miami Dolphins, 38-

16, for their second Super Bowl
victory.
The game brought more than
85,000 fans, 2,800 journalists,
15,000-20,000 "hangers-on"
outside the stadium and 400 to
500 security guards to campus,
but the day went fairly smoothly,
without the disturbances that of
ten accompany events of such
magnitude, according to Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herrington.
There were no major traffic
jams and only 34 arrests — a
relatively low number. Even a
counterfeit ticket scheme, un
covered a week before the game,
caused no problems. "It went real
well. It was an easier crowd to
control than Big Game," Har
rington said.
In addition to the crowds here,
an estimated 100 million spec
tators watched the game on tele
vision.
After it was over, the devasta
tion of the area around the
stadium and criticism over Stan
ford hosting a non-academic

event that required the diversion
of so many resources, caused
Kennedy to question whether
Stanford would host another
Super Bowl. "We're going to
have to take a long look at it
before we decide it's something
we ought to repeat," he said.
Stanford votes for Mondale but
Reagan wins landslide
Despite the landslide victory of
Republican incumbent Ronald
Reagan in the November 6 elec
tions, Stanford cast its vote over
whelmingly for presidential can
didate Walter Mondale and
mainly for other Democrats in
local races.
Mondale easily took Stanford's
presidential vote with 78 percent
of the campus vote while Reagan
accumulated 49 states and 59
percent of the total vote in his
march to a second term in the
White House. Meanwhile, Edu
cation Prof. Martin Carnoy, a
local Democratic challenger for
the U.S. House of Representa
tives from the 12th congressional
district, took 63 percent of the
campus vote. Incumbent Repub
lican Ed Zschau, though, easily
defeated his rival with 64 percent
of the total vote.
Stanford also voted against
welfare cuts and against an
English-only ballot in state
referenda.
$250 million renovation plan pro
posed
In an effort to upgrade the run
down science and engineering

buildings which comprise the so
called Near West Campus, the
area west and northwest of the
Quad, the University in May an
nounced that it is looking into the
possiblity of a $250 million
renovation project. If the project
were to be carried out, it would
be the biggest single construction
project on campus since the Uni
versity was built.
Raymond Bacchetti, vice
provost for management and
director of University budgets,
cited the "slum-like quality" of
some of the buildings which cur
rently exist on the 41-acre Near
West Campus as the reason for
the proposal. He added that the
unpleasant environment may lead
to the loss of talented researchers.
The proposal, which Bacchetti
called "exploratory and
preparatory," calls for the
renovation of some buildings and
the total replacement of others to
create a more integrated and at
tractive area.
Plans require the approval of
the trustees before the concerned
departments can begin fund
raising. Officials said that if the
plan is iven basic approval they
hope to raise 20 to 40 percent of
the noney from a few principal
donors, another 20 to 30 percent
from other individuals and corpo
rations, and 5 to 10 percent from
foundations. The University
would make up the rest.
Reagan Library site approved
At their February meeting, the
trustees decided unanimously
that the Ronald Reagan Presi
dential Library, a facility which
will house President Reagan's
memoirs and government docu
ments, should be built on a site in

the foothills just west of Junipero
Serra Boulevard, a location
Reagan approved a few weeks
later.
Responding to the trustees'
decision in a March 6 letter to
Kennedy, Reagan said the site,
which is near the Center for Ad
vanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences and the Stanford Golf
Course, "is an excellent choice."
He added, "I approve the site
and look forward to the construc
tion of a library facility at Stan
ford University that will be a
valuable academic resource for
the nation and especially for the
Stanford community."
In a January 18 letter from
Presidential Counselor Edwin
Meese 111 to President of the
Board of Trustees William Kim

ball, Meese said that Reagan was
"especially concerned that if the
library is to be located on the
University campus, it be readily
accessible to undergraduate and
graduate students."
The approved site is the closest
to campus of the more than 20
possible locations considered by
the University.
Sen. Kennedy speaks on hunger
As the final event to a week
long, student-organized confer
ence on world hunger held here,
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.)
addressed a Dinkelspiel
Auditorium crowd of 800 on
April 11 and called upon the
United States to provide massive
amounts of aid to famine-stricken

nations in Africa.
Kennedy drew upon his
December trip to Ethiopia and
the Sudan, painting a grim picture
of the situation there.
"We saw mothers watching in
despair as famished children suc
cumbed to measles and
pneumonia. We saw infants too
weak even to brush the flies
drinking the moisture from their
eyes. Unless $1.5 billion more in
emergency food and relief is
supplied this year, we will begin
to see the tragedy of Ethiopia
repeated in other countries," he
said.
Kennedy added that he
believes "mercy corridors"
should be created immediately to
allow safe passage for relief con
voys in militarily sensitive parts of
Ethiopia.
Kennedy, who also hinted at
his intention to run for president
in 1988, drew the largest audi
ence of any of the speeches,
panels and performances spon
sored by the hunger conference.
Students protest Playboy photog
rapher
An April visit by a photog
rapher from Playboy shooting
pictures for the magazine's
planned "Girls of the Pac-10"
pictorial brought student
protesters out in full force.
More than 350 students atten
ded an initial White Plaza rally,
and meetings and protests contin
ued for the next week on campus
and in front of the Holiday Inn on
El Camino Real, where the
photographer was staying.
