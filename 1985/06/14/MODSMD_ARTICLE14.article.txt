# 1985: Reagan, rallies, renovations
## 
### MARK LAWRKNCE 
From a fall visit by presidential
candidate Walter Mondale to a
month-long spring sit-in by stu
dents protesting University in
vestments in companies that do
business in South Africa, it was a
busy year here on The Farm.
Among the diverse news items
of this year, the Super Bowl came
to Stanford Stadium, students
voted overwhelmingly for

Mondale in the fall election
despite Ronald Reagan's
landslide victory, the University
proposed a plan to renovate
several science and engineering
buildings, the Board of Trustees
approved a site for the Ronald
Reagan Presidential Library, Sen.
Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.)
spoke at a student-organized con
ference on world hunger, and stu
dents protested a visit by a
photographer from Playboy mag
azine.
Here is a look back at these,
the top stories of this year:
Protesters call for divestment
In response to the call for a

nationwide day of protest on
April 24, a coalition of students
from various progressive campus
groups organized a rally in White
Plaza and a sit-in outside Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy's
office to protest University in
vestments in companies that do
business in South Africa.
Protesters claimed that the com
panies support the South African
government's apartheid policy by

operating in the country.
Stanford was one of more than
120 colleges across the country
that held protests, rallies and
forums on the issue of divestment
in a movement that caused many
observers to recall the protests of
the 19605.
Because of what the protesters,
a group calling itself Stanford Out
of South Africa (SOSA), felt was
insufficient action on the part of
Kennedy and the trustees, stu
dents were still sitting in and
sleeping in the Quad a month
later and are planning long-term
strategy for bringing about total
divestment of Stanford's South
Africa-related stock. During the
first few nights of the sit-in, about

250 students slept in the Quad.
Also in the course of the
protest, nine students were ar
rested on May 28 for sitting in the
Bursar's Office in Old Union
after the building closed. The stu
dents, most of whom were
released three days later, are cur
rently awaiting trial. Protesters
also risked being arrested when,
beginning on May 14, they at
tempted to prevent trustees from
leaving campus after a board
meeting. The action, which ended
two days later, followed after a
meeting at which trustees took no
action on the call for total divest
ment.
Kennedy and the trustees have
repeatedly expressed concern
about the problem of apartheid,
but say total divestment by the
University is not the proper ap
proach to the problem. Kennedy
has suggested that legislative
methods are more appropriate.
Mondale campaigns on The Farm
Calling his appearance "the
beginning of the Mondale-
Ferraro victory march," presiden
tial challenger Walter "Fritz"
Mondale made a campaign ap
pearance here on October 16 and
attacked the Reagan administra
tion for what he called its "naive
and primitive notion of national
strength."
Mondale, in his 20 minute
speech, told a loud and congested
Memorial Auditorium crowd that
Reagan is "out of touch with
reality" and "uninformed" and
"confused" on matters of foreign
policy.
The 2,000 spectators who
managed to get into the
auditorium were forced to wait
outside in the drenching rain
along with another 3,000 to 5,000
who were turned away when the
hall filled. The speech was
originally scheduled for White
Plaza, but plans had to be can
celled at the last minute because
of the rain. The crowd then had to
wait for nearly two hours while

the building was prepared for the
rally.
Once inside, the enthusiastic
crowd joined with Sen. Gary Hart
(D-Colo.) and Mondale in
criticizing Reagan for what
Mondale called Reagan's "record
of profound confusion."
"Mr. Reagan may know for
sure that he can recall a missile
after it has been launched, but it
just ain't so ... . And Mr. Presi
dent, you may think you've won
this election but it just ain't so,"
Mondale said, as the crowd
joined him in the refrain.
Stanford hosts Super Bowl XIX
On Super Sunday, January 20,
the eyes of the world were on
Stanford Stadium, the site of the
1985 championship game of the
National Football League —
Super Bowl XIX.
On the strength of the passing
of Joe Montana, the 49ers' quar
terback and the game's most
valuable player, and the 49er
defense, the San Francisco 49ers
blew out the Miami Dolphins, 38-

16, for their second Super Bowl
victory.
The game brought more than
85,000 fans, 2,800 journalists,
15,000-20,000 "hangers-on"
outside the stadium and 400 to
500 security guards to campus,
but the day went fairly smoothly,
without the disturbances that of
ten accompany events of such
magnitude, according to Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herrington.
There were no major traffic
jams and only 34 arrests — a
relatively low number. Even a
counterfeit ticket scheme, un
covered a week before the game,
caused no problems. "It went real
well. It was an easier crowd to
control than Big Game," Har
rington said.
In addition to the crowds here,
an estimated 100 million spec
tators watched the game on tele
vision.
After it was over, the devasta
tion of the area around the
stadium and criticism over Stan
ford hosting a non-academic
