# The 						sports year in review
## Card teams suffer near misses 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
It all started way back in Sep
tember in Norman, Oklahoma.
Stanford's football team took the
field before 75,008 screaming
Oklahomans to play the
nationally-ranked Sooners.
Two minutes and four seconds
into the game, Stanford quarter
back John Paye capped a 71 -yard
drive with a touchdown pass to
tight end Greg Baty and Stanford
led' 7-0.
But that was all anyone heard
from Stanford's offense for the
rest of the afternoon, and Head
Coach Jack Elway — whose son
John threw his share of touch
down passes for Stanford and
more recently for the NFL's Den
ver Broncos — lost his Stanford
debut, 19-7.
That game alone foreshadowed
the year to come in Stanford
sports. Some ups. Some downs.
Some expected things happened.
Some unexpected things —
scoring on the opening drive
against perhaps the nation's top
team — happened.
Stanford's football team, for
example, was supposed to
struggle through yet another mur
derous schedule and have another
horrific season. The Cardinal was
1-10 the season before, and most
sports weathermen were calling
for more of the same.
But Elway, with his down
home sense of humor, his red
Stanford cap, his red Stanford
jacket and his packs — and packs
— of cigarettes, fooled them all.
The Cardinal beat the teams it
was supposed to — California and
Oregon State. It also beat the
likes of UCLA and Illinois — last
year's Rose Bowl teams — and
San Jose State — his former team
which had defeated Stanford the
three previous years.
If it wasn't for a disasterous 49-
42 loss to Washington State after
leading 35-7 and 42-14 in the
third quarter, Stanford even

would have finished with a win
ning record. As it was, Stanford
finished 5-6, and fourth-year
seniors ended their careers having
played on four losing teams.
If the football team's unex
pected course of events didn't
surpise fans, the No. 1-ranked
women's cross country team's
second-place finish at the
NCAAs did. It was the third
straight year the Cardinal women
fell a place short of the national
title.
The fall quarter disappoint
ment didn't stop with the
women's cross country team.
Both the water polo team and the
women's volleyball teams also en
tered their NCAA tournaments

seeded first. And both also
finished second.
The trend of Stanford teams
entering post-season play ranked
No. 1 and not returning home
with a NCAA championship con
tinued in winter and spring quar
ters.
The top-ranked women's ten
nis team lost only its second
match all season to Trinity
(Texas), but did it in the quarter
finals of the NCAA tournament.
The baseball team entered the
College World Series with the
No. 1 ranking, but won one game
and lost two for the third straight
time at the CWS.
However, one Cardinal team
which entered the NCAAs with

top billing bucked the trend and
brought home a national champi
onship.
Stanford's men's swimming
team won its first NCAA title
since 1967, amassing 403.5 points
and outdistancing second-place
Florida by 74. The title kept alive
a six-year streak in which Stan
ford has won at least one national
championship in a varsity sport.
Not all Stanford teams fared as
well as the men's swimmers or,
for that matter, the other five No.
1-ranked teams that fell short in
the NCAAs. There were the
men's and women's basketball
teams, for instance.
Both teams lost more games
than they won, and one of them

lost its coach after the dismal
season. Women's Coach Dotty
McCrea was asked to resign after
a 9-19 season this year and a 5-23
mark last year.
Few would argue that Stanford
had the best lineup of spring
sports in the nation. The baseball
team and both tennis teams were
ranked No. 1 at one point in the
season, and both golf teams were
also ranked.
Both tennis teams, however,
lost in the quarterfinals of the
NCAAs, the women to Trinity
and the men to Georgia. The men
weren't able to make up for their
shocking loss in the individuals,
but the women did that and more.

Team members Terry Jackson, Mike Noble and Dave Marohonic hold the coveted axe high after a Card victory in Big Game '84.
Linda Gates, a four-time Ail-
American, won the NCAA
singles title and then teamed with
Leigh Anne Eldredge to win the
doubles a few hours later.
Meanwhile, the baseball team
was in the final weekend of the
regular season. A week later,
Stanford hosted the four-team
West I Regional, a double
elimination tournament the Card
inal had to win to advance to the
CWS.
Stanford won the first game
handily over Oregon State, then
came from behind to beat Ne
braska in the second. Pepperdine
upset the Cardinal the next day,
forcing a Memorial Day rematch
between the two teams. Behind
the stellar pitching of senior Jeff
Ballard, who retired the last 20
Pepperdine batters in order,
Stanford prevailed and earned its

third trip trip to Omaha, Ne
braska in four years.
In the first game of the double
elimination series, which ended
earlier this week, Ballard wasn't
able to work his magic again, and
Stanford took a 17-3 beating
from Miami (Florida), the even
tual champion. The Cardinal
rebounded to beat Pac-10 foe
Arizona in the second game,
thanks to complete game pitching
from freshman Jack McDowell.
Against Arkansas, however,
Stanford had trouble doing much
of anything, lost 10-4, and was on
the next flight home.
The baseball team's mis
fortunes brought to five the num
ber of Stanford teams that en
tered the NCAA championships
ranked No. 1 and didn't return
home with a first-place trohpy.
But it's nothing to be ashamed
of. If being No. 1 ranked and
finishing second or third in the
NCAAs is a problem, it's a prob
lem any athletic department
would love to have.

West I Regional, a double
elimination tournament the Card
inal had to win to advance to the
CWS.
Stanford won the first game
handily over Oregon State, then
came from behind to beat Ne
braska in the second. Pepperdine
upset the Cardinal the next day,
forcing a Memorial Day rematch
between the two teams. Behind
the stellar pitching of senior Jeff
Ballard, who retired the last 20
Pepperdine batters in order,
Stanford prevailed and earned its

third trip trip to Omaha, Ne
braska in four years.
In the first game of the double
elimination series, which ended
earlier this week, Ballard wasn't
able to work his magic again, and
Stanford took a 17-3 beating
from Miami (Florida), the even
tual champion. The Cardinal
rebounded to beat Pac-10 foe
Arizona in the second game,
thanks to complete game pitching
from freshman Jack McDowell.
Against Arkansas, however,
Stanford had trouble doing much
of anything, lost 10-4, and was on
the next flight home.
The baseball team's mis
fortunes brought to five the num
ber of Stanford teams that en
tered the NCAA championships
ranked No. 1 and didn't return
home with a first-place trohpy.
But it's nothing to be ashamed
of. If being No. 1 ranked and
finishing second or third in the
NCAAs is a problem, it's a prob
lem any athletic department
would love to have.

Although Pete Stanicek successfully stopped Arkansas' Mark Jackson from reaching second base, Omaha's
Rosenblatt Field was not "Home of the Winner" for the Cardinal.
It all started way back in Sep
tember in Norman, Oklahoma.
Stanford's football team took the
field before 75,008 screaming
Oklahomans to play the
nationally-ranked Sooners.
Two minutes and four seconds
into the game, Stanford quarter
back John Paye capped a 71 -yard
drive with a touchdown pass to
tight end Greg Baty and Stanford
led' 7-0.
But that was all anyone heard
from Stanford's offense for the
rest of the afternoon, and Head
Coach Jack Elway — whose son
John threw his share of touch
down passes for Stanford and
more recently for the NFL's Den
ver Broncos — lost his Stanford
debut, 19-7.
That game alone foreshadowed
the year to come in Stanford
sports. Some ups. Some downs.
Some expected things happened.
Some unexpected things —
scoring on the opening drive
against perhaps the nation's top
team — happened.
Stanford's football team, for
example, was supposed to
struggle through yet another mur
derous schedule and have another
horrific season. The Cardinal was
1-10 the season before, and most
sports weathermen were calling
for more of the same.
But Elway, with his down
home sense of humor, his red
Stanford cap, his red Stanford
jacket and his packs — and packs
— of cigarettes, fooled them all.
The Cardinal beat the teams it
was supposed to — California and
Oregon State. It also beat the
likes of UCLA and Illinois — last
year's Rose Bowl teams — and
San Jose State — his former team
which had defeated Stanford the
three previous years.
If it wasn't for a disasterous 49-
42 loss to Washington State after
leading 35-7 and 42-14 in the
third quarter, Stanford even

would have finished with a win
ning record. As it was, Stanford
finished 5-6, and fourth-year
seniors ended their careers having
played on four losing teams.
If the football team's unex
pected course of events didn't
surpise fans, the No. 1-ranked
women's cross country team's
second-place finish at the
NCAAs did. It was the third
straight year the Cardinal women
fell a place short of the national
title.
The fall quarter disappoint
ment didn't stop with the
women's cross country team.
Both the water polo team and the
women's volleyball teams also en
tered their NCAA tournaments

seeded first. And both also
finished second.
The trend of Stanford teams
entering post-season play ranked
No. 1 and not returning home
with a NCAA championship con
tinued in winter and spring quar
ters.
The top-ranked women's ten
nis team lost only its second
match all season to Trinity
(Texas), but did it in the quarter
finals of the NCAA tournament.
The baseball team entered the
College World Series with the
No. 1 ranking, but won one game
and lost two for the third straight
time at the CWS.
However, one Cardinal team
which entered the NCAAs with

top billing bucked the trend and
brought home a national champi
onship.
Stanford's men's swimming
team won its first NCAA title
since 1967, amassing 403.5 points
and outdistancing second-place
Florida by 74. The title kept alive
a six-year streak in which Stan
ford has won at least one national
championship in a varsity sport.
Not all Stanford teams fared as
well as the men's swimmers or,
for that matter, the other five No.
1-ranked teams that fell short in
the NCAAs. There were the
men's and women's basketball
teams, for instance.
Both teams lost more games
than they won, and one of them

lost its coach after the dismal
season. Women's Coach Dotty
McCrea was asked to resign after
a 9-19 season this year and a 5-23
mark last year.
Few would argue that Stanford
had the best lineup of spring
sports in the nation. The baseball
team and both tennis teams were
ranked No. 1 at one point in the
season, and both golf teams were
also ranked.
Both tennis teams, however,
lost in the quarterfinals of the
NCAAs, the women to Trinity
and the men to Georgia. The men
weren't able to make up for their
shocking loss in the individuals,
but the women did that and more.

Team members Terry Jackson, Mike Noble and Dave Marohonic hold the coveted axe high after a Card victory in Big Game '84.
