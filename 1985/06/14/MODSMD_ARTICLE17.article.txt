# THEY SOLICITED FOR FUN!
## 
### 
The 3rd Annual Stanford Spring Telethon held
May 13th thru 19th far surpassed expectations of
both volunteer attendance and money pledged by
alumni.
The $110,000 goal set by student organizers
represented a modest 5% increase over last year's
event total. Yet, with plenty of calling time
remaining, the volunteers rolled right past the
goal. By the time the last call was completed on
Sunday afternoon, volunteer callers had received
in excess of $140,000.
More than 300 people — students, alumni, and
friends — were responsible for the overwhelming
success of this year's Spring fundraiser. Jim
Chesnutt, student Chairman of the Telethon, was
particularly pleased: "We had a great response

from students this year. A lot of different groups
were involved. The whole telethon was amazing! It
started out really well and managed to maintain
momentum all the way through. We broke goal
almost without realizing it!"
Prizes and incentives awarded at the telethon
were donated by many local merchants and
agencies. Several faculty members will be hosting
lunches for students who participated in the event.
The Office of Development wishes to thank all
those who helped make the 3rd Annual Telethon
the most successful one of its kind to date. In
particular, grateful thanks to the volunteer callers,
clerks, and other telethon helpers for the many
hours in generous support of Stanford !
