# University displays its new look
## 
### SANDRA BODOVITZ 
Since freshman year many of
the faces we've come to know at
Stanford have changed. In that
time, the processes of renovation
and acquisition have changed the
face of the University as well.
Braun Music Center
For three years students here
have been denied a through route
from Mayfield Avenue to the post
office, but with the completion of
Braun Music Center, access has
once again been restored. To date
the consensus seems to be that
the convenience was worth the
wait.
Dedicated in May of last year,
the $6 million dollar music center
occupies 23,000 square feet on
the south end of White Plaza.
The new building, which
doubles the space available to the
Music Department, houses class
rooms, administrative offices, fac
ulty areas, studio areas, rehearsal
facilities and the Music Library.
The center was partially paid
for by a gift from the Carl F.
Braun Trust of Alhambra.
The Inner Quad
There are many Stanford fresh
men who have not yet become
Stanford men or women. Due to
delays in the construction of the
Inner Quad, the tradition of kis
sing under a full moon at mid
night in the Quad was interrupted
for most of this year.
The renovation of the Inner
Quad was slowed because of rain
and scheduling conflicts among
different contractors.
The stone rosette which marks
the center of the Quad was a late
addition to the renovation plans.
A private contractor had to color
match the stones for the rosette
and cast it before he installed it in
the Inner Quad.
In addition, the oasis circles in
each corner of the Quad were
newly landscaped as part of the
renovation plans.
The renovation project was
plagued by controversy since its
conception. Art History doctoral
candidate Gerard Koskovich was
an outspoken critic of several
early renovation proposals.
Koskovich encouraged the
University to closely follow the
plans of the Inner Quad's original
architect, Frederick Law
Olmsted. Olmsted's plan men
tions specific types of plants he
considered appropriate for the
planting circles. The circles were
meant to be lush oases to contrast
with the stark paved square, Kos
kovich said.
The University received $1
million from an anonymous
donor for the renovation of the
Inner Quad.
The "Gates of Hell"
"It's one of the greatest works
in the history of art," Art History
Prof. Albert Elsen said of the
"Gates of Hell."
The bronze sculpture, acquired
as part of the Rodin sculpture
garden, stands 21 feet high, 12
feet wide, four feet deep and
weighs eight tons.
The sculpture contains approx
imately 170 figures, Elsen said,
and it represents Rodin's per
sonal vision of hell.
The work will be the center
piece of the garden, which is lo
cated next to the museum.
The "Gates of Hell" stopped at
New York's Metropolitan
Museum of Art and the National
Gallery in Washington. D.C.
before arriving here.
Several other Rodin pieces
along with the "Gates of Hell"
were donated to the University by
B.G. Cantor. The new garden will
be named after Cantor.

The Clock Tower
The new clock tower that
stands at the Engineering Corner
of the Quad may be most fondly
remembered as it stood on the
day of its dedication. As donor
William Kimball, president of the
Board of Trustees, stood cutting
the ribbon, a three foot high
Mickey Mouse smiled down at

passers-by from the top of the
tower.
"I hope it will be an opportu
nity for meeting, posing, gather
ing and conversing," University
President Donald Kennedy said
at the dedication ceremony.
The $250,000 tower was given
bv Kimball to the University to

replace the tower that used to be
adjacent to Memorial Church.
The original tower was torn down
in 1967 to expand the area of the
church.
Kimball and his wife used to
meet under the tower when they
were students here. The site was
chosen because it's close to the

original site near Memorial
Church.
Kimball said that he hoped his
gift would inspire other non
academic gifts to the University.
The clock-works from the
original tower were placed in the
new one. The largest hell is four
feet high and weighs one ton. The
bells chime every quarter hour.

Construction over the past four years has
given Stanford a new face. Additions to the
campus include (clockwise from above)
Braun Music Center, the "Gates of Hell,"
the rosette in the Inner Quad and the Clock

The $250,000 tower was given
bv Kimball to the University to

replace the tower that used to be
adjacent to Memorial Church.
The original tower was torn down
in 1967 to expand the area of the
church.
Kimball and his wife used to
meet under the tower when they
were students here. The site was
chosen because it's close to the

original site near Memorial
Church.
Kimball said that he hoped his
gift would inspire other non
academic gifts to the University.
The clock-works from the
original tower were placed in the
new one. The largest hell is four
feet high and weighs one ton. The
bells chime every quarter hour.

Construction over the past four years has
given Stanford a new face. Additions to the
campus include (clockwise from above)
Braun Music Center, the "Gates of Hell,"
the rosette in the Inner Quad and the Clock
Tower.
