# Centennial improvements planned
## 
### SANDRA BODOVITZ 
A four year fund-raising drive
aimed at earning $900 million
will mark the University's Cen
tennial.
"We're only going to be 100
years old once. That gives us an
opportunity to think about what
Stanford can do and should do,"
Provost James Rosse said.
In a preliminary report that
University President Donald
Kennedy presented to the Aca
demic Council in May, he identi
fied three areas that are targeted
for improvement.
The first area is faculty im
provement. Kennedy's report tar
gets the humanities as an area in
need of strengthening. "We need
to foster and support their work,
to assure Stanford humanists that
they have the opportunity and the
resources to perform at the limit
of their capacities as scholars and
teachers."
Kennedy also noted the demo
graphic trend that has increased
the average age of the Stanford
faculty by nearly four years in the
past decade. In order to combat
this trend, the report suggests
recruiting younger faculty mem
bers more vigorously and restruc
turing early retirement programs.

The second area of attention is
undergraduate education. "We
need to enhance the opportunity
for our undergraduates to engage
in independent study and
departmental honors work and to
receive individual instruction in
writing," the report says.
The ability of Stanford to pro
vide financial aid to all "deserving
and able students" is also an im
portant use of Centennial funds.
The third area is improving the
quality of science facilities. Ac
cording to Kennedy, the lack of
government funds for scientific
research at universities over the
past 17 years has led to a decline
in the quality of those facilities.
"At Stanford what is required is
nothing less than the most am
bitious building program since the
founding of the University," Ken
nedy's report says.
In the past Stanford has had
problems attracting donors to
give money for the construction
of capital facilities. But Kennedy
said that by convincing donors
these facilities are necessary to
maintain the high quality Stan
ford tries to maintain, it should be
possible to raise the necessary
funds.

The four-year fund raising
drive will fall in the midst of Stan
ford's six-year Cenetennial
celebration.
"Just as it took a number of
years to build this University and
open its doors, so it will take a

number of years to celebrate the
Centennial," Rosse said.
The celebration began in
March with a commemoration of
the legislative act which led to the
University's founding in Novem
ber 1885.
The University was founded by
Mr. and Mrs. Leland Stanford in
memory of their son Leland Stan
ford Jr. who died in 1884.
