# Dining in the Palo Alto area
## 
### 
Breakfast. Morning eaters are
lucky here — Palo Alto and
Menlo Park have a plethora of
good restaurants that specialize in
breakfast and lunch. First among
equals is Late for the Train (8561
Oak Grove Ave., Menlo Park,
near the train station), a folksy
place that makes great omelettes,
divine blintzes and fruit pancakes
and the usual salads and sand
wiches, plus ever-changing
desserts. If you go on a weekend,
particularly a Sunday, expect at
least a 45-minute wait; it's best, if

you can, to go for an early or late
weekday lunch, when you can of
ten be seated immediately.
Modeled along much the same
lines is Hobee's (two locations in
Palo Alto: 4224 El Camino Real,
and Town and Country Village
across El Camino from the
stadium), a family operation with
more bianches down the penin
sula. Hobee's follows more tradi
tional American breakfast lines
— sausage, eggs, ham — but isn't
lacking for fresh-squeezed juices,
fruit and other California trim
mings, and it has a truly addictive
coffee cake that comes with most
of the breakfasts. Both Hobee's
and Late for the Train set out cof
fee urns for the waiting crowds.
The Farmer's Market (448 Cali
fornia Ave., Palo Alto) has a
small menu, spotty service (semi
cafeteria style) and the ambiance
of a butcher shop, but it serves
great breakfasts (try the apple
pancakes or a ham-swiss-apple
omelette) at relatively low prices.

Finally, there's the favorite morn
ing meeting spot of Stanford
sororities: Dinah's Poolside Cof
fee Shop (4269 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto; not to be confused
with Dinah's Shack, a mediocre
restaurant next door), which
many people feel has the best
omelettes in the area.
Where the Cardinal flocks.
Stanford hangouts change from
year to year, of course, and I'm
sure the newest ones have
escaped our attention, but there
are old standards. Half the people
in Ramona's on any given
weekend night will be from Stan
ford; the Stanford crush is partic
ularly intense before and after
basketball games. Most of them
will be eating the second-best
pizza in the area, while those who
want to be different chew on
calzone or decent hamburgers.
The once-great Ramona's salad
bar maintains only a shade of its
former glory. Down the street at
the Good Earth Restaurant (185
University Ave., Palo Alto) you'll
find a different, slightly older,
Stanford crowd eating chic health
food. Of course, hangouts in the
true Stanford sense of the word
are places you go to swill beer,
and there are a couple of those:
The Dutch Goose (3567 Alameda
de las Pulgas, Menlo Park), a
functional sort of place where
there's standing room only on
Senior Pub Nights, and The Oasis
Beer Garden (241 El Camino
Real, Menlo Park), a downright
ugly place that has been witness
to untold decades of Stanford his
tory. Two things you have to
know: refer to them as "the
Goose" and"the O,"
respectively, and rest assured that
you will be carded at both es
tablishments during the evening
hours. If you like your nightlife a
bit rowdier, try St. James Infir
mary (390 Moffet Blvd., Moun
tain View) or Antonio's Nut
House (321 California Ave., Palo
Alto), places where you can get
into a fight if you try hard enough
or look enough like a Stanford
student. In recent years an at
tempt has been made to turn The
Lancashire Tavern (547 Emerson
St., Palo Alto) into a Stanford
hangout of the pub night variety,
but it doesn't seem to have fully

caught on. A morning alternative:
the brunch crowd at Hobee's.
And don't forget The New Var
sity, especially when the theater is
showing Woody Allen movies.
Why don't we pick the kind of
food we want? It's the familiar
refrain: How about Chinese?
How about Mexican? And it's
easy to fall into around here, be
cause there are more ethnic res
taurants than you can shake a
burrito or a potsticker at. Most of
them are as bad as you'd expect;
here are a few of the good ones.
Generations of Stanfordites
have fallen in love with the mu
shu pork at Chef Chu's (1067
North San Antonio Road'at El
Camino Real, Los Altos). This al
ways crowded Mandarin restau
rant prepares perfectly solid,
unexciting dishes — it's the ideal
place for large groups with
diverse tastes. The food's more

exciting at China First (675 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto), another
place with a large reputation. The
cuisine here is Szechuan/Hunan,
albeit not that spicy, and there are
great dishes on the menu; if you
go in looking like students, you
may have to put up with the
waiter sniffing at you.
On a more modest scale, there
are two worthwhile Chinese
places in Menlo Park: Yuen Yung
(639 Santa Cruz Ave.) and Su
Hong (1039 El Camino Real).
Both are eclectic, but primarily
Cantonese/Mandarin. Su Hong
has better food, Yuen Yung more
interesting decor — it looks like a

cross between a Chinese restau
rant and a fern bar.
Palo Alto lost its only really
good Mexican restaurant when
Andes Mexican Restaurant, a
Whiskey Gulch anomaly, folded
last year. Now a trip to Menlo
Park or Los Altos is required.
Estrellita (971 North San Antonio
Rd., Los Altos) isn't what it used
to be, but it still has great chiinic
hangas. There are two passable
family-style Mexican joints in
Menlo Park, La Luna Mexican
Cafe (1137 Chestnut St.) and
Caleta (1143 D Crane St.). If you
don't mind a drive, the best Latin
restaurant around is probably El
Calderon (699 El Calderon Ave.,
Mountain View), which is hidden
away in a small shopping center
and has a Mexican/Salvadoran
menu.
Places worth going for French
food. Without going into too
much detail, there are two local
French restaurants that come
close to meeting the bistro ideal
(good food, relatively low prices):
Le Pot au Feu (1149 El Camino
Real, Menlo Park) and A La
Carte Restaurant Francais (2310
El Camino Real, Palo Alto).
Somewhat more formal, but still
affordable, are Pear Williams
Restaurant Francais (150 Mid
dlefield Rd., Menlo Park, named
for its dessert specialty) and Chez
Louis (4170 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto), a Palo Alto institu
tion. Most of the other nearby
French restaurants suffer from
some combination of pretentious
ness, over-pricing, bad service
and just plain poor food.
A place to go for German food.
The only real German restaurant
we've discovered anywhere near
campus is the Black Forest Inn
(376 First St., Los Altos). Meals
are prepared rather indifferently,
but if you just have to have some
weinerschnitzel with red cabbage
and potato pancakes, this is the
place to go.
Real burritos. Rosita's Taqueria
(171 A sth Ave., Redwood City)
occupies a storefront in an uni
nviting part of Redwood City (a
town known for its uninviting
parts) and makes the only au
thentic burritos-to-go in the area.

These are big sloppy things that
cant be eaten while driving a car,
and they come in a wide selection,
including pork and beef in several
sauces, steak, chicken, sausage
and tongue. Rosita's also has a
good selection of Mexican beers
and soft drinks (you haven't lived
until you've had a Boing soda).
The best pizza within a half-hour
of Stanford. Frankie, Johnnie &
Luigi, Too (939 El Camino Real,
Mountain View) has no peer in
pizza; what it does have are 45-

to-75-minute waits on weekends,
which can fly by if enough of you
go and you drink enough while
waiting (if you look 21, you'll be
accosted by a roving cocktail
waitress the minute you sign in).
Try the fresh-tomato-and-garlic
pizza, a house specialty, or the
ever-popular stromboli or
Hawaiian, and avoid the Italian
dinners, which are often dreadful.
A distant second to FJ&L is
Ramona's (see above), which has
decent New York-style (i.e.,
heavy and spicy) pizza and
slightly shorter waits; it's also 15
minutes closer to campus.
Honorable mention goes to the
pizza with barbecue sauce (ladled
on in place of tomato sauce) at
Jose's (2275 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto).
It's 2 a.m. and I'm hungry and
nothing's open. There used to be
a wealth of place you could go at



2 a.m. (or 4 a.m. or 6 a.m.) with
the gang and be obnoxious, or
with a loved one to fortify your
self for an emotional crisis, or by
yourself to study and mainline
some caffeine. But Stickney's

Flamingo first cut back to mid
night, and then became a trendy
Yuppie restaurant; Luv's went to
24 hours on weekends only, then
became a single dance spot, and is
now Atherton Joe's, which is God
only knows what. In the old days,
going to Dennys or Lyons didn't
even cross your mind; now
they're all that's left. Closer (by
about a hundred yards) and
friendlier is Dennys (4256 El
Caminoi Real, Palo Alto), which
is 10 minutes away at two in the
morning. Dennys is also cheaper
than Lyons, and it has as good or
better food, tackier vinyl (bright
orange) and the two current all
star late-night waitresses, Sharon

and Ova. So why go to Lyons
(4298 El Camino Real, Los
Altos) at all? Because sometimes
you need a change. Lyons is
darker, the waitresses are
younger, and the meals are big
ger; if you're determined to eat a
lot of food at 4 a.m. and make
yourself really sick, there's noth
ing like a Mighty Lyon Burger.
The only competition left for

these corporate monsters is the
University Creamery (209 Uni
versity Ave., Palo Alto), which
sensed the vacuum and went to a
24-hour policy last spring. The
Creamery has pretty mediocre
greasy-spoon food, but the
milkshakes are good (they use
Bud's ice cream) and it's a lot
closer to campus (it's even within
fairly easy bicycle range).
Ice cream. We all love ice cream,
but no one can deny that the
Stanford area is drowning in the
stuff. Within a quick drive of
campus are a Haagen-Dazs
(Stanford Barn, 700 Welch Rd.),
two Bud's (125 University Ave.,

Palo Alto and 3590 Alameda de
las Pulgas, Menlo Park) and
various Swensen's and Baskin-
Robbins outlets, as well as the
Fabulous Ice Cream Machine on
University Avenue across from
the New Varsity, Blatz' Folded
Ice Cream on California Avenue
and a soon-to-open Double Rain
bow on El Camino Real in Menlo
Park. Then there are the Italian
ice cream shops: Gelato La
Romanina (1700 El Camino
Real, Menlo Park), Tempo
Gelato (2245 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto), Gelato Classico
(Emerson Street, downtown Palo
Alto), Bravo Fono (99 Stanford
Shopping Center), et al. Two or
three more have probably opened
since you started reading this. If
ice cream to you means a soda
fountain, try Edy's (73 Town &
Country Village, Palo Alto), or
one of the downtown creameries:
Peninsula Creamery (Hamilton
Avenue and Emerson Street,
Palo Alto) and University
Creamery (209 University Ave.,
Palo Alto).
Spirits in the night. There are as
many different kinds of bars as
there are drinkers, and the most
popular ones — the Goose, the
O, 42nd Street, the BBC — are
treated elsewhere in the article.
We're concerned here with the
bar as a comfortable environment
in which to drink, as opposed to a
supportive environment in which
to get drunk.
The Gatehouse (265 Lytton
Ave., Palo Alto) is a snitzy res
taurant by day and a snitzy bar by
night, and one of the nicest places
to sit around in in Palo Alto. The
bar at Mama's (379 Stanford
Shopping Center) is a bit out of
the way, but it has a certain

hushed elegance that makes it at
tractive. Henry's (482 University
Ave., Palo Alto) is hot and
crowded once the dinner custom
ers clear out, but there's no one
on the make; just lots of success
ful young Palo Altans enjoying
their success in one of their favor
ite bars. Another bar that has a
"scene," but isn't a singles bar, is
that of the New Varsity (465 Uni
versity Ave., Palo Alto). Videos
play above the bar, musicians
play in the courtyard and lots of
Paly and Gunn High punks and
assorted young people play out in
the street in front and the alley
behind. It's noisy and crowded
and uncomfortable on the
weekends, but the people
watching is great. If you're
looking for something a little
more staid, try the bar at the rear
of the London House (630
Ramona St., Palo Alto), a loving
recreation of an English pub
where you can get most any
British beer you want, pub snacks
and a game of darts.
Where to go to feel like a Yuppie.
Style is everything in a Yuppie
hangout, and Mac Arthur Park is
in one of the approved styles: big,
open, white-paneled spaces,
wood floor, brass railings
everywhere. The food ranges
from mediocre to bad (except for
the barbecued meats; be sure to
order something from the grill),
but what does it matter when you
can get potato skins and eight
wines by the glass? Another style
is represented by Waverley Place
(560 Waverley St., Palo Alto),
new to downtown Palo Alto,
which is all glass and bleached
wood and expensive (but surpris
ingly good) pastas and seafood
dishes. Along with these upstarts,

a couple of established Palo Alto
restaurants have swung with the
times: The Gatehouse, one of
Palo Alto's prettiest places to eat
and drink, is taken over by the
young come dinner hour, and
Henry's is a favorite with the local
advertising/design community
that lives off Silicon Valley.

Avoid at all costs. Sometime while
you're here someone will suggest
going to one of these restaurants.
Politely tell him/her you'd rather
undergo root canal work.
Dinah's Shack (4269 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto) is one of
those inexplicably popular restau
rants — I can see why little old
ladies go there, but why in God's
name would anyone else want to
spend upwards of $10 for a lousy
buffet and the chance to hear
"Feelings" played on the harp?
Ecco Ristorante (4290 El Camino
Real, Palo Alto), right across the
street in the Hyatt Palo Alto, may
be the worst Italian restaurant in
the world, and the green carpet
doesn't help. King Chuan (75
Town and Country Village, Palo
Alto) had, at last count, three dif
ferent laudatory Stanford Daily
reviews posted in its window.
Don't believe a word of them.


Breakfast. Morning eaters are

Menlo Park have a plethora of
good restaurants that specialize in

rants — I can see why little old
ladies go there, but why in God's
name would anyone else want to
spend upwards of $10 for a lousy
buffet and the chance to hear
"Feelings" played on the harp?
Ecco Ristorante (4290 El Camino
Real, Palo Alto), right across the
street in the Hyatt Palo Alto, may
be the worst Italian restaurant in
the world, and the green carpet
doesn't help. King Chuan (75
Town and Country Village, Palo
Alto) had, at last count, three dif
ferent laudatory Stanford Daily
reviews posted in its window.
Don't believe a word of them.


Breakfast. Morning eaters are
lucky here — Palo Alto and
Menlo Park have a plethora of
good restaurants that specialize in
breakfast and lunch. First among
equals is Late for the Train (8561
Oak Grove Ave., Menlo Park,
near the train station), a folksy
place that makes great omelettes,
divine blintzes and fruit pancakes
and the usual salads and sand
wiches, plus ever-changing
desserts. If you go on a weekend,
particularly a Sunday, expect at
least a 45-minute wait; it's best, if

you can, to go for an early or late
weekday lunch, when you can of
ten be seated immediately.
Modeled along much the same
lines is Hobee's (two locations in
Palo Alto: 4224 El Camino Real,
and Town and Country Village
across El Camino from the
stadium), a family operation with
more bianches down the penin
sula. Hobee's follows more tradi
tional American breakfast lines
— sausage, eggs, ham — but isn't
lacking for fresh-squeezed juices,
fruit and other California trim
mings, and it has a truly addictive
coffee cake that comes with most
of the breakfasts. Both Hobee's
and Late for the Train set out cof
fee urns for the waiting crowds.
The Farmer's Market (448 Cali
fornia Ave., Palo Alto) has a
small menu, spotty service (semi
cafeteria style) and the ambiance
of a butcher shop, but it serves
great breakfasts (try the apple
pancakes or a ham-swiss-apple
omelette) at relatively low prices.

Finally, there's the favorite morn
ing meeting spot of Stanford
sororities: Dinah's Poolside Cof
fee Shop (4269 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto; not to be confused
with Dinah's Shack, a mediocre
restaurant next door), which
many people feel has the best
omelettes in the area.
Where the Cardinal flocks.
Stanford hangouts change from
year to year, of course, and I'm
sure the newest ones have
escaped our attention, but there
are old standards. Half the people
in Ramona's on any given
weekend night will be from Stan
ford; the Stanford crush is partic
ularly intense before and after
basketball games. Most of them
will be eating the second-best
pizza in the area, while those who
want to be different chew on
calzone or decent hamburgers.
The once-great Ramona's salad
bar maintains only a shade of its
former glory. Down the street at
the Good Earth Restaurant (185
University Ave., Palo Alto) you'll
find a different, slightly older,
Stanford crowd eating chic health
food. Of course, hangouts in the
true Stanford sense of the word
are places you go to swill beer,
and there are a couple of those:
The Dutch Goose (3567 Alameda
de las Pulgas, Menlo Park), a
functional sort of place where
there's standing room only on
Senior Pub Nights, and The Oasis
Beer Garden (241 El Camino
Real, Menlo Park), a downright
ugly place that has been witness
to untold decades of Stanford his
tory. Two things you have to
know: refer to them as "the
Goose" and"the O,"
respectively, and rest assured that
you will be carded at both es
tablishments during the evening
hours. If you like your nightlife a
bit rowdier, try St. James Infir
mary (390 Moffet Blvd., Moun
tain View) or Antonio's Nut
House (321 California Ave., Palo
Alto), places where you can get
into a fight if you try hard enough
or look enough like a Stanford
student. In recent years an at
tempt has been made to turn The
Lancashire Tavern (547 Emerson
St., Palo Alto) into a Stanford
hangout of the pub night variety,
but it doesn't seem to have fully

caught on. A morning alternative:
the brunch crowd at Hobee's.
And don't forget The New Var
sity, especially when the theater is
showing Woody Allen movies.
Why don't we pick the kind of
food we want? It's the familiar
refrain: How about Chinese?
How about Mexican? And it's
easy to fall into around here, be
cause there are more ethnic res
taurants than you can shake a
burrito or a potsticker at. Most of
them are as bad as you'd expect;
here are a few of the good ones.
Generations of Stanfordites
have fallen in love with the mu
shu pork at Chef Chu's (1067
North San Antonio Road'at El
Camino Real, Los Altos). This al
ways crowded Mandarin restau
rant prepares perfectly solid,
unexciting dishes — it's the ideal
place for large groups with
diverse tastes. The food's more

exciting at China First (675 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto), another
place with a large reputation. The
cuisine here is Szechuan/Hunan,
albeit not that spicy, and there are
great dishes on the menu; if you
go in looking like students, you
may have to put up with the
waiter sniffing at you.
On a more modest scale, there
are two worthwhile Chinese
places in Menlo Park: Yuen Yung
(639 Santa Cruz Ave.) and Su
Hong (1039 El Camino Real).
Both are eclectic, but primarily
Cantonese/Mandarin. Su Hong
has better food, Yuen Yung more
interesting decor — it looks like a

cross between a Chinese restau
rant and a fern bar.
Palo Alto lost its only really
good Mexican restaurant when
Andes Mexican Restaurant, a
Whiskey Gulch anomaly, folded
last year. Now a trip to Menlo
Park or Los Altos is required.
Estrellita (971 North San Antonio
Rd., Los Altos) isn't what it used
to be, but it still has great chiinic
hangas. There are two passable
family-style Mexican joints in
Menlo Park, La Luna Mexican
Cafe (1137 Chestnut St.) and
Caleta (1143 D Crane St.). If you
don't mind a drive, the best Latin
restaurant around is probably El
Calderon (699 El Calderon Ave.,
Mountain View), which is hidden
away in a small shopping center
and has a Mexican/Salvadoran
menu.
Places worth going for French
food. Without going into too
much detail, there are two local
French restaurants that come
close to meeting the bistro ideal
(good food, relatively low prices):
Le Pot au Feu (1149 El Camino
Real, Menlo Park) and A La
Carte Restaurant Francais (2310
El Camino Real, Palo Alto).
Somewhat more formal, but still
affordable, are Pear Williams
Restaurant Francais (150 Mid
dlefield Rd., Menlo Park, named
for its dessert specialty) and Chez
Louis (4170 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto), a Palo Alto institu
tion. Most of the other nearby
French restaurants suffer from
some combination of pretentious
ness, over-pricing, bad service
and just plain poor food.
A place to go for German food.
The only real German restaurant
we've discovered anywhere near
campus is the Black Forest Inn
(376 First St., Los Altos). Meals
are prepared rather indifferently,
but if you just have to have some
weinerschnitzel with red cabbage
and potato pancakes, this is the
place to go.
Real burritos. Rosita's Taqueria
(171 A sth Ave., Redwood City)
occupies a storefront in an uni
nviting part of Redwood City (a
town known for its uninviting
parts) and makes the only au
thentic burritos-to-go in the area.

These are big sloppy things that
cant be eaten while driving a car,
and they come in a wide selection,
including pork and beef in several
sauces, steak, chicken, sausage
and tongue. Rosita's also has a
good selection of Mexican beers
and soft drinks (you haven't lived
until you've had a Boing soda).
The best pizza within a half-hour
of Stanford. Frankie, Johnnie &
Luigi, Too (939 El Camino Real,
Mountain View) has no peer in
pizza; what it does have are 45-

to-75-minute waits on weekends,
which can fly by if enough of you
go and you drink enough while
waiting (if you look 21, you'll be
accosted by a roving cocktail
waitress the minute you sign in).
Try the fresh-tomato-and-garlic
pizza, a house specialty, or the
ever-popular stromboli or
Hawaiian, and avoid the Italian
dinners, which are often dreadful.
A distant second to FJ&L is
Ramona's (see above), which has
decent New York-style (i.e.,
heavy and spicy) pizza and
slightly shorter waits; it's also 15
minutes closer to campus.
Honorable mention goes to the
pizza with barbecue sauce (ladled
on in place of tomato sauce) at
Jose's (2275 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto).
It's 2 a.m. and I'm hungry and
nothing's open. There used to be
a wealth of place you could go at



2 a.m. (or 4 a.m. or 6 a.m.) with
the gang and be obnoxious, or
with a loved one to fortify your
self for an emotional crisis, or by
yourself to study and mainline
some caffeine. But Stickney's

Flamingo first cut back to mid
night, and then became a trendy
Yuppie restaurant; Luv's went to
24 hours on weekends only, then
became a single dance spot, and is
now Atherton Joe's, which is God
only knows what. In the old days,
going to Dennys or Lyons didn't
even cross your mind; now
they're all that's left. Closer (by
about a hundred yards) and
friendlier is Dennys (4256 El
Caminoi Real, Palo Alto), which
is 10 minutes away at two in the
morning. Dennys is also cheaper
than Lyons, and it has as good or
better food, tackier vinyl (bright
orange) and the two current all
star late-night waitresses, Sharon

and Ova. So why go to Lyons
(4298 El Camino Real, Los
Altos) at all? Because sometimes
you need a change. Lyons is
darker, the waitresses are
younger, and the meals are big
ger; if you're determined to eat a
lot of food at 4 a.m. and make
yourself really sick, there's noth
ing like a Mighty Lyon Burger.
The only competition left for

these corporate monsters is the
University Creamery (209 Uni
versity Ave., Palo Alto), which
sensed the vacuum and went to a
24-hour policy last spring. The
Creamery has pretty mediocre
greasy-spoon food, but the
milkshakes are good (they use
Bud's ice cream) and it's a lot
closer to campus (it's even within
fairly easy bicycle range).
Ice cream. We all love ice cream,
but no one can deny that the
Stanford area is drowning in the
stuff. Within a quick drive of
campus are a Haagen-Dazs
(Stanford Barn, 700 Welch Rd.),
two Bud's (125 University Ave.,

Palo Alto and 3590 Alameda de
las Pulgas, Menlo Park) and
various Swensen's and Baskin-
Robbins outlets, as well as the
Fabulous Ice Cream Machine on
University Avenue across from
the New Varsity, Blatz' Folded
Ice Cream on California Avenue
and a soon-to-open Double Rain
bow on El Camino Real in Menlo
Park. Then there are the Italian
ice cream shops: Gelato La
Romanina (1700 El Camino
Real, Menlo Park), Tempo
Gelato (2245 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto), Gelato Classico
(Emerson Street, downtown Palo
Alto), Bravo Fono (99 Stanford
Shopping Center), et al. Two or
three more have probably opened
since you started reading this. If
ice cream to you means a soda
fountain, try Edy's (73 Town &
Country Village, Palo Alto), or
one of the downtown creameries:
Peninsula Creamery (Hamilton
Avenue and Emerson Street,
Palo Alto) and University
Creamery (209 University Ave.,
Palo Alto).
Spirits in the night. There are as
many different kinds of bars as
there are drinkers, and the most
popular ones — the Goose, the
O, 42nd Street, the BBC — are
treated elsewhere in the article.
We're concerned here with the
bar as a comfortable environment
in which to drink, as opposed to a
supportive environment in which
to get drunk.
The Gatehouse (265 Lytton
Ave., Palo Alto) is a snitzy res
taurant by day and a snitzy bar by
night, and one of the nicest places
to sit around in in Palo Alto. The
bar at Mama's (379 Stanford
Shopping Center) is a bit out of
the way, but it has a certain

hushed elegance that makes it at
tractive. Henry's (482 University
Ave., Palo Alto) is hot and
crowded once the dinner custom
ers clear out, but there's no one
on the make; just lots of success
ful young Palo Altans enjoying
their success in one of their favor
ite bars. Another bar that has a
"scene," but isn't a singles bar, is
that of the New Varsity (465 Uni
versity Ave., Palo Alto). Videos
play above the bar, musicians
play in the courtyard and lots of
Paly and Gunn High punks and
assorted young people play out in
the street in front and the alley
behind. It's noisy and crowded
and uncomfortable on the
weekends, but the people
watching is great. If you're
looking for something a little
more staid, try the bar at the rear
of the London House (630
Ramona St., Palo Alto), a loving
recreation of an English pub
where you can get most any
British beer you want, pub snacks
and a game of darts.
Where to go to feel like a Yuppie.
Style is everything in a Yuppie
hangout, and Mac Arthur Park is
in one of the approved styles: big,
open, white-paneled spaces,
wood floor, brass railings
everywhere. The food ranges
from mediocre to bad (except for
the barbecued meats; be sure to
order something from the grill),
but what does it matter when you
can get potato skins and eight
wines by the glass? Another style
is represented by Waverley Place
(560 Waverley St., Palo Alto),
new to downtown Palo Alto,
which is all glass and bleached
wood and expensive (but surpris
ingly good) pastas and seafood
dishes. Along with these upstarts,

a couple of established Palo Alto
restaurants have swung with the
times: The Gatehouse, one of
Palo Alto's prettiest places to eat
and drink, is taken over by the
young come dinner hour, and
Henry's is a favorite with the local
advertising/design community
that lives off Silicon Valley.

Avoid at all costs. Sometime while
you're here someone will suggest
going to one of these restaurants.
Politely tell him/her you'd rather
undergo root canal work.
Dinah's Shack (4269 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto) is one of
those inexplicably popular restau
rants — I can see why little old
ladies go there, but why in God's
name would anyone else want to
spend upwards of $10 for a lousy
buffet and the chance to hear
"Feelings" played on the harp?
Ecco Ristorante (4290 El Camino

be the worst Italian restaurant in
the world, and the green carpet
doesn't help. King Chuan (75

dishes. Along with these upstarts,

a couple of established Palo Alto
restaurants have swung with the
times: The Gatehouse, one of
Palo Alto's prettiest places to eat
and drink, is taken over by the
young come dinner hour, and
Henry's is a favorite with the local
advertising/design community
that lives off Silicon Valley.

Avoid at all costs. Sometime while
you're here someone will suggest
going to one of these restaurants.
Politely tell him/her you'd rather
undergo root canal work.
Dinah's Shack (4269 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto) is one of
those inexplicably popular restau
rants — I can see why little old
ladies go there, but why in God's
name would anyone else want to
spend upwards of $10 for a lousy
buffet and the chance to hear
"Feelings" played on the harp?
Ecco Ristorante (4290 El Camino
Real, Palo Alto), right across the
street in the Hyatt Palo Alto, may
be the worst Italian restaurant in
the world, and the green carpet
doesn't help. King Chuan (75
Town and Country Village, Palo
Alto) had, at last count, three dif
ferent laudatory Stanford Daily
reviews posted in its window.
Don't believe a word of them.


Breakfast. Morning eaters are
lucky here — Palo Alto and
Menlo Park have a plethora of
good restaurants that specialize in
breakfast and lunch. First among
equals is Late for the Train (8561
Oak Grove Ave., Menlo Park,
near the train station), a folksy
place that makes great omelettes,
divine blintzes and fruit pancakes
and the usual salads and sand
wiches, plus ever-changing
desserts. If you go on a weekend,
particularly a Sunday, expect at
least a 45-minute wait; it's best, if

you can, to go for an early or late
weekday lunch, when you can of
ten be seated immediately.
Modeled along much the same
lines is Hobee's (two locations in
Palo Alto: 4224 El Camino Real,
and Town and Country Village
across El Camino from the
stadium), a family operation with
more bianches down the penin
sula. Hobee's follows more tradi
tional American breakfast lines
— sausage, eggs, ham — but isn't
lacking for fresh-squeezed juices,
fruit and other California trim
mings, and it has a truly addictive
coffee cake that comes with most
of the breakfasts. Both Hobee's
and Late for the Train set out cof
fee urns for the waiting crowds.
The Farmer's Market (448 Cali
fornia Ave., Palo Alto) has a
small menu, spotty service (semi
cafeteria style) and the ambiance
of a butcher shop, but it serves
great breakfasts (try the apple
pancakes or a ham-swiss-apple
omelette) at relatively low prices.

Finally, there's the favorite morn
ing meeting spot of Stanford
sororities: Dinah's Poolside Cof
fee Shop (4269 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto; not to be confused
with Dinah's Shack, a mediocre
restaurant next door), which
many people feel has the best
omelettes in the area.
Where the Cardinal flocks.
Stanford hangouts change from
year to year, of course, and I'm
sure the newest ones have
escaped our attention, but there
are old standards. Half the people
in Ramona's on any given
weekend night will be from Stan
ford; the Stanford crush is partic
ularly intense before and after
basketball games. Most of them
will be eating the second-best
pizza in the area, while those who
want to be different chew on
calzone or decent hamburgers.
The once-great Ramona's salad
bar maintains only a shade of its
former glory. Down the street at
the Good Earth Restaurant (185
University Ave., Palo Alto) you'll
find a different, slightly older,
Stanford crowd eating chic health
food. Of course, hangouts in the
true Stanford sense of the word
are places you go to swill beer,
and there are a couple of those:
The Dutch Goose (3567 Alameda
de las Pulgas, Menlo Park), a
functional sort of place where
there's standing room only on
Senior Pub Nights, and The Oasis
Beer Garden (241 El Camino
Real, Menlo Park), a downright
ugly place that has been witness
to untold decades of Stanford his
tory. Two things you have to
know: refer to them as "the
Goose" and"the O,"
respectively, and rest assured that
you will be carded at both es
tablishments during the evening
hours. If you like your nightlife a
bit rowdier, try St. James Infir
mary (390 Moffet Blvd., Moun
tain View) or Antonio's Nut
House (321 California Ave., Palo
Alto), places where you can get
into a fight if you try hard enough
or look enough like a Stanford
student. In recent years an at
tempt has been made to turn The
Lancashire Tavern (547 Emerson
St., Palo Alto) into a Stanford
hangout of the pub night variety,
but it doesn't seem to have fully

caught on. A morning alternative:
the brunch crowd at Hobee's.
And don't forget The New Var
sity, especially when the theater is
showing Woody Allen movies.
Why don't we pick the kind of
food we want? It's the familiar
refrain: How about Chinese?
How about Mexican? And it's
easy to fall into around here, be
cause there are more ethnic res
taurants than you can shake a
burrito or a potsticker at. Most of
them are as bad as you'd expect;
here are a few of the good ones.
Generations of Stanfordites
have fallen in love with the mu
shu pork at Chef Chu's (1067
North San Antonio Road'at El
Camino Real, Los Altos). This al
ways crowded Mandarin restau
rant prepares perfectly solid,
unexciting dishes — it's the ideal
place for large groups with
diverse tastes. The food's more

exciting at China First (675 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto), another
place with a large reputation. The
cuisine here is Szechuan/Hunan,
albeit not that spicy, and there are
great dishes on the menu; if you
go in looking like students, you
may have to put up with the
waiter sniffing at you.
On a more modest scale, there
are two worthwhile Chinese
places in Menlo Park: Yuen Yung
(639 Santa Cruz Ave.) and Su
Hong (1039 El Camino Real).
Both are eclectic, but primarily
Cantonese/Mandarin. Su Hong
has better food, Yuen Yung more
interesting decor — it looks like a

cross between a Chinese restau
rant and a fern bar.
Palo Alto lost its only really
good Mexican restaurant when
Andes Mexican Restaurant, a
Whiskey Gulch anomaly, folded
last year. Now a trip to Menlo
Park or Los Altos is required.
Estrellita (971 North San Antonio
Rd., Los Altos) isn't what it used
to be, but it still has great chiinic
hangas. There are two passable
family-style Mexican joints in
Menlo Park, La Luna Mexican
Cafe (1137 Chestnut St.) and
Caleta (1143 D Crane St.). If you
don't mind a drive, the best Latin
restaurant around is probably El
Calderon (699 El Calderon Ave.,
Mountain View), which is hidden
away in a small shopping center
and has a Mexican/Salvadoran
menu.
Places worth going for French
food. Without going into too
much detail, there are two local
French restaurants that come
close to meeting the bistro ideal
(good food, relatively low prices):
Le Pot au Feu (1149 El Camino
Real, Menlo Park) and A La
Carte Restaurant Francais (2310
El Camino Real, Palo Alto).
Somewhat more formal, but still
affordable, are Pear Williams
Restaurant Francais (150 Mid
dlefield Rd., Menlo Park, named
for its dessert specialty) and Chez
Louis (4170 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto), a Palo Alto institu
tion. Most of the other nearby
French restaurants suffer from
some combination of pretentious
ness, over-pricing, bad service
and just plain poor food.
A place to go for German food.
The only real German restaurant
we've discovered anywhere near
campus is the Black Forest Inn
(376 First St., Los Altos). Meals
are prepared rather indifferently,
but if you just have to have some
weinerschnitzel with red cabbage
and potato pancakes, this is the
place to go.
Real burritos. Rosita's Taqueria
(171 A sth Ave., Redwood City)
occupies a storefront in an uni
nviting part of Redwood City (a
town known for its uninviting
parts) and makes the only au
thentic burritos-to-go in the area.

These are big sloppy things that
cant be eaten while driving a car,
and they come in a wide selection,
including pork and beef in several
sauces, steak, chicken, sausage
and tongue. Rosita's also has a
good selection of Mexican beers
and soft drinks (you haven't lived
until you've had a Boing soda).
The best pizza within a half-hour
of Stanford. Frankie, Johnnie &
Luigi, Too (939 El Camino Real,
Mountain View) has no peer in
pizza; what it does have are 45-

to-75-minute waits on weekends,
which can fly by if enough of you
go and you drink enough while
waiting (if you look 21, you'll be
accosted by a roving cocktail
waitress the minute you sign in).
Try the fresh-tomato-and-garlic
pizza, a house specialty, or the
ever-popular stromboli or
Hawaiian, and avoid the Italian
dinners, which are often dreadful.
A distant second to FJ&L is
Ramona's (see above), which has
decent New York-style (i.e.,
heavy and spicy) pizza and
slightly shorter waits; it's also 15
minutes closer to campus.
Honorable mention goes to the
pizza with barbecue sauce (ladled
on in place of tomato sauce) at
Jose's (2275 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto).
It's 2 a.m. and I'm hungry and
nothing's open. There used to be
a wealth of place you could go at



2 a.m. (or 4 a.m. or 6 a.m.) with
the gang and be obnoxious, or
with a loved one to fortify your
self for an emotional crisis, or by
yourself to study and mainline
some caffeine. But Stickney's

Flamingo first cut back to mid
night, and then became a trendy
Yuppie restaurant; Luv's went to
24 hours on weekends only, then
became a single dance spot, and is
now Atherton Joe's, which is God
only knows what. In the old days,
going to Dennys or Lyons didn't
even cross your mind; now
they're all that's left. Closer (by
about a hundred yards) and
friendlier is Dennys (4256 El
Caminoi Real, Palo Alto), which
is 10 minutes away at two in the
morning. Dennys is also cheaper
than Lyons, and it has as good or
better food, tackier vinyl (bright
orange) and the two current all
star late-night waitresses, Sharon

and Ova. So why go to Lyons
(4298 El Camino Real, Los
Altos) at all? Because sometimes
you need a change. Lyons is
darker, the waitresses are
younger, and the meals are big
ger; if you're determined to eat a
lot of food at 4 a.m. and make
yourself really sick, there's noth
ing like a Mighty Lyon Burger.
The only competition left for

these corporate monsters is the
University Creamery (209 Uni
versity Ave., Palo Alto), which
sensed the vacuum and went to a
24-hour policy last spring. The
Creamery has pretty mediocre
greasy-spoon food, but the
milkshakes are good (they use
Bud's ice cream) and it's a lot
closer to campus (it's even within
fairly easy bicycle range).
Ice cream. We all love ice cream,
but no one can deny that the
Stanford area is drowning in the
stuff. Within a quick drive of
campus are a Haagen-Dazs
(Stanford Barn, 700 Welch Rd.),
two Bud's (125 University Ave.,

Palo Alto and 3590 Alameda de
las Pulgas, Menlo Park) and
various Swensen's and Baskin-
Robbins outlets, as well as the
Fabulous Ice Cream Machine on
University Avenue across from
the New Varsity, Blatz' Folded
Ice Cream on California Avenue
and a soon-to-open Double Rain
bow on El Camino Real in Menlo
Park. Then there are the Italian
ice cream shops: Gelato La
Romanina (1700 El Camino
Real, Menlo Park), Tempo
Gelato (2245 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto), Gelato Classico
(Emerson Street, downtown Palo
Alto), Bravo Fono (99 Stanford
Shopping Center), et al. Two or
three more have probably opened
since you started reading this. If
ice cream to you means a soda
fountain, try Edy's (73 Town &
Country Village, Palo Alto), or
one of the downtown creameries:
Peninsula Creamery (Hamilton
Avenue and Emerson Street,
Palo Alto) and University
Creamery (209 University Ave.,
Palo Alto).
Spirits in the night. There are as
many different kinds of bars as
there are drinkers, and the most
popular ones — the Goose, the
O, 42nd Street, the BBC — are
treated elsewhere in the article.
We're concerned here with the
bar as a comfortable environment
in which to drink, as opposed to a
supportive environment in which
to get drunk.
The Gatehouse (265 Lytton
Ave., Palo Alto) is a snitzy res
taurant by day and a snitzy bar by
night, and one of the nicest places
to sit around in in Palo Alto. The
bar at Mama's (379 Stanford
Shopping Center) is a bit out of
the way, but it has a certain

hushed elegance that makes it at
tractive. Henry's (482 University
Ave., Palo Alto) is hot and
crowded once the dinner custom
ers clear out, but there's no one
on the make; just lots of success
ful young Palo Altans enjoying
their success in one of their favor
ite bars. Another bar that has a
"scene," but isn't a singles bar, is
that of the New Varsity (465 Uni
versity Ave., Palo Alto). Videos
play above the bar, musicians
play in the courtyard and lots of
Paly and Gunn High punks and
assorted young people play out in
the street in front and the alley
behind. It's noisy and crowded
and uncomfortable on the
weekends, but the people
watching is great. If you're
looking for something a little
more staid, try the bar at the rear
of the London House (630
Ramona St., Palo Alto), a loving
recreation of an English pub
where you can get most any
British beer you want, pub snacks
and a game of darts.
Where to go to feel like a Yuppie.
Style is everything in a Yuppie
hangout, and Mac Arthur Park is
in one of the approved styles: big,
open, white-paneled spaces,
wood floor, brass railings
everywhere. The food ranges
from mediocre to bad (except for
the barbecued meats; be sure to
order something from the grill),
but what does it matter when you
can get potato skins and eight
wines by the glass? Another style
is represented by Waverley Place
(560 Waverley St., Palo Alto),
new to downtown Palo Alto,
which is all glass and bleached
wood and expensive (but surpris
ingly good) pastas and seafood
dishes. Along with these upstarts,

a couple of established Palo Alto
restaurants have swung with the
times: The Gatehouse, one of
Palo Alto's prettiest places to eat
and drink, is taken over by the
young come dinner hour, and
Henry's is a favorite with the local
advertising/design community
that lives off Silicon Valley.

Style is everything in a Yuppie
hangout, and Mac Arthur Park is
in one of the approved styles: big,
open, white-paneled spaces,
wood floor, brass railings
everywhere. The food ranges
from mediocre to bad (except for
the barbecued meats; be sure to
order something from the grill),
but what does it matter when you
can get potato skins and eight
wines by the glass? Another style
is represented by Waverley Place
(560 Waverley St., Palo Alto),
new to downtown Palo Alto,
which is all glass and bleached
wood and expensive (but surpris
ingly good) pastas and seafood
dishes. Along with these upstarts,

a couple of established Palo Alto
restaurants have swung with the
times: The Gatehouse, one of
Palo Alto's prettiest places to eat
and drink, is taken over by the
young come dinner hour, and
Henry's is a favorite with the local
advertising/design community
that lives off Silicon Valley.

Avoid at all costs. Sometime while
you're here someone will suggest
going to one of these restaurants.
Politely tell him/her you'd rather
undergo root canal work.
Dinah's Shack (4269 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto) is one of
those inexplicably popular restau
rants — I can see why little old
ladies go there, but why in God's
name would anyone else want to
spend upwards of $10 for a lousy
buffet and the chance to hear
"Feelings" played on the harp?
Ecco Ristorante (4290 El Camino
Real, Palo Alto), right across the
street in the Hyatt Palo Alto, may
be the worst Italian restaurant in
the world, and the green carpet
doesn't help. King Chuan (75
Town and Country Village, Palo
Alto) had, at last count, three dif
ferent laudatory Stanford Daily
reviews posted in its window.
Don't believe a word of them.


Breakfast. Morning eaters are
lucky here — Palo Alto and
Menlo Park have a plethora of
good restaurants that specialize in
breakfast and lunch. First among
equals is Late for the Train (8561
Oak Grove Ave., Menlo Park,
near the train station), a folksy
place that makes great omelettes,
divine blintzes and fruit pancakes
and the usual salads and sand
wiches, plus ever-changing
desserts. If you go on a weekend,
particularly a Sunday, expect at
least a 45-minute wait; it's best, if

you can, to go for an early or late
weekday lunch, when you can of
ten be seated immediately.
Modeled along much the same
lines is Hobee's (two locations in
Palo Alto: 4224 El Camino Real,
and Town and Country Village
across El Camino from the
stadium), a family operation with
more bianches down the penin
sula. Hobee's follows more tradi
tional American breakfast lines
— sausage, eggs, ham — but isn't
lacking for fresh-squeezed juices,
fruit and other California trim
mings, and it has a truly addictive
coffee cake that comes with most
of the breakfasts. Both Hobee's
and Late for the Train set out cof
fee urns for the waiting crowds.
The Farmer's Market (448 Cali
fornia Ave., Palo Alto) has a
small menu, spotty service (semi
cafeteria style) and the ambiance
of a butcher shop, but it serves
great breakfasts (try the apple
pancakes or a ham-swiss-apple
omelette) at relatively low prices.

Finally, there's the favorite morn
ing meeting spot of Stanford
sororities: Dinah's Poolside Cof
fee Shop (4269 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto; not to be confused
with Dinah's Shack, a mediocre
restaurant next door), which
many people feel has the best
omelettes in the area.
Where the Cardinal flocks.
Stanford hangouts change from
year to year, of course, and I'm
sure the newest ones have
escaped our attention, but there
are old standards. Half the people
in Ramona's on any given
weekend night will be from Stan
ford; the Stanford crush is partic
ularly intense before and after
basketball games. Most of them
will be eating the second-best
pizza in the area, while those who
want to be different chew on
calzone or decent hamburgers.
The once-great Ramona's salad
bar maintains only a shade of its
former glory. Down the street at
the Good Earth Restaurant (185
University Ave., Palo Alto) you'll
find a different, slightly older,
Stanford crowd eating chic health
food. Of course, hangouts in the
true Stanford sense of the word
are places you go to swill beer,
and there are a couple of those:
The Dutch Goose (3567 Alameda
de las Pulgas, Menlo Park), a
functional sort of place where
there's standing room only on
Senior Pub Nights, and The Oasis
Beer Garden (241 El Camino
Real, Menlo Park), a downright
ugly place that has been witness
to untold decades of Stanford his
tory. Two things you have to
know: refer to them as "the
Goose" and"the O,"
respectively, and rest assured that
you will be carded at both es
tablishments during the evening
hours. If you like your nightlife a
bit rowdier, try St. James Infir
mary (390 Moffet Blvd., Moun
tain View) or Antonio's Nut
House (321 California Ave., Palo
Alto), places where you can get
into a fight if you try hard enough
or look enough like a Stanford
student. In recent years an at
tempt has been made to turn The
Lancashire Tavern (547 Emerson
St., Palo Alto) into a Stanford
hangout of the pub night variety,
but it doesn't seem to have fully

caught on. A morning alternative:
the brunch crowd at Hobee's.
And don't forget The New Var
sity, especially when the theater is
showing Woody Allen movies.
Why don't we pick the kind of
food we want? It's the familiar
refrain: How about Chinese?
How about Mexican? And it's
easy to fall into around here, be
cause there are more ethnic res
taurants than you can shake a
burrito or a potsticker at. Most of
them are as bad as you'd expect;
here are a few of the good ones.
Generations of Stanfordites
have fallen in love with the mu
shu pork at Chef Chu's (1067
North San Antonio Road'at El
Camino Real, Los Altos). This al
ways crowded Mandarin restau
rant prepares perfectly solid,
unexciting dishes — it's the ideal
place for large groups with
diverse tastes. The food's more

exciting at China First (675 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto), another
place with a large reputation. The
cuisine here is Szechuan/Hunan,
albeit not that spicy, and there are
great dishes on the menu; if you
go in looking like students, you
may have to put up with the
waiter sniffing at you.
On a more modest scale, there
are two worthwhile Chinese
places in Menlo Park: Yuen Yung
(639 Santa Cruz Ave.) and Su
Hong (1039 El Camino Real).
Both are eclectic, but primarily
Cantonese/Mandarin. Su Hong
has better food, Yuen Yung more
interesting decor — it looks like a

cross between a Chinese restau
rant and a fern bar.
Palo Alto lost its only really
good Mexican restaurant when
Andes Mexican Restaurant, a
Whiskey Gulch anomaly, folded
last year. Now a trip to Menlo
Park or Los Altos is required.
Estrellita (971 North San Antonio
Rd., Los Altos) isn't what it used
to be, but it still has great chiinic
hangas. There are two passable
family-style Mexican joints in
Menlo Park, La Luna Mexican
Cafe (1137 Chestnut St.) and
Caleta (1143 D Crane St.). If you
don't mind a drive, the best Latin
restaurant around is probably El
Calderon (699 El Calderon Ave.,
Mountain View), which is hidden
away in a small shopping center
and has a Mexican/Salvadoran
menu.
Places worth going for French
food. Without going into too
much detail, there are two local
French restaurants that come
close to meeting the bistro ideal
(good food, relatively low prices):
Le Pot au Feu (1149 El Camino
Real, Menlo Park) and A La
Carte Restaurant Francais (2310
El Camino Real, Palo Alto).
Somewhat more formal, but still
affordable, are Pear Williams
Restaurant Francais (150 Mid
dlefield Rd., Menlo Park, named
for its dessert specialty) and Chez
Louis (4170 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto), a Palo Alto institu
tion. Most of the other nearby
French restaurants suffer from
some combination of pretentious
ness, over-pricing, bad service
and just plain poor food.
A place to go for German food.
The only real German restaurant
we've discovered anywhere near
campus is the Black Forest Inn
(376 First St., Los Altos). Meals
are prepared rather indifferently,
but if you just have to have some
weinerschnitzel with red cabbage
and potato pancakes, this is the
place to go.
Real burritos. Rosita's Taqueria
(171 A sth Ave., Redwood City)
occupies a storefront in an uni
nviting part of Redwood City (a
town known for its uninviting
parts) and makes the only au
thentic burritos-to-go in the area.

These are big sloppy things that
cant be eaten while driving a car,
and they come in a wide selection,
including pork and beef in several
sauces, steak, chicken, sausage
and tongue. Rosita's also has a
good selection of Mexican beers
and soft drinks (you haven't lived
until you've had a Boing soda).
The best pizza within a half-hour
of Stanford. Frankie, Johnnie &
Luigi, Too (939 El Camino Real,
Mountain View) has no peer in
pizza; what it does have are 45-

to-75-minute waits on weekends,
which can fly by if enough of you
go and you drink enough while
waiting (if you look 21, you'll be
accosted by a roving cocktail
waitress the minute you sign in).
Try the fresh-tomato-and-garlic
pizza, a house specialty, or the
ever-popular stromboli or
Hawaiian, and avoid the Italian
dinners, which are often dreadful.
A distant second to FJ&L is
Ramona's (see above), which has
decent New York-style (i.e.,
heavy and spicy) pizza and
slightly shorter waits; it's also 15
minutes closer to campus.
Honorable mention goes to the
pizza with barbecue sauce (ladled
on in place of tomato sauce) at
Jose's (2275 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto).
It's 2 a.m. and I'm hungry and
nothing's open. There used to be
a wealth of place you could go at



2 a.m. (or 4 a.m. or 6 a.m.) with
the gang and be obnoxious, or
with a loved one to fortify your
self for an emotional crisis, or by
yourself to study and mainline
some caffeine. But Stickney's

Flamingo first cut back to mid
night, and then became a trendy
Yuppie restaurant; Luv's went to
24 hours on weekends only, then
became a single dance spot, and is
now Atherton Joe's, which is God
only knows what. In the old days,
going to Dennys or Lyons didn't
even cross your mind; now
they're all that's left. Closer (by
about a hundred yards) and
friendlier is Dennys (4256 El
Caminoi Real, Palo Alto), which
is 10 minutes away at two in the
morning. Dennys is also cheaper
than Lyons, and it has as good or
better food, tackier vinyl (bright
orange) and the two current all
star late-night waitresses, Sharon

and Ova. So why go to Lyons
(4298 El Camino Real, Los
Altos) at all? Because sometimes
you need a change. Lyons is
darker, the waitresses are
younger, and the meals are big
ger; if you're determined to eat a
lot of food at 4 a.m. and make
yourself really sick, there's noth
ing like a Mighty Lyon Burger.
The only competition left for

these corporate monsters is the
University Creamery (209 Uni
versity Ave., Palo Alto), which
sensed the vacuum and went to a
24-hour policy last spring. The
Creamery has pretty mediocre
greasy-spoon food, but the
milkshakes are good (they use
Bud's ice cream) and it's a lot
closer to campus (it's even within
fairly easy bicycle range).
Ice cream. We all love ice cream,
but no one can deny that the
Stanford area is drowning in the
stuff. Within a quick drive of
campus are a Haagen-Dazs
(Stanford Barn, 700 Welch Rd.),
two Bud's (125 University Ave.,

Palo Alto and 3590 Alameda de
las Pulgas, Menlo Park) and
various Swensen's and Baskin-
Robbins outlets, as well as the
Fabulous Ice Cream Machine on
University Avenue across from
the New Varsity, Blatz' Folded
Ice Cream on California Avenue
and a soon-to-open Double Rain
bow on El Camino Real in Menlo
Park. Then there are the Italian
ice cream shops: Gelato La
Romanina (1700 El Camino
Real, Menlo Park), Tempo
Gelato (2245 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto), Gelato Classico
(Emerson Street, downtown Palo
Alto), Bravo Fono (99 Stanford
Shopping Center), et al. Two or
three more have probably opened
since you started reading this. If
ice cream to you means a soda
fountain, try Edy's (73 Town &
Country Village, Palo Alto), or
one of the downtown creameries:
Peninsula Creamery (Hamilton
Avenue and Emerson Street,
Palo Alto) and University
Creamery (209 University Ave.,
Palo Alto).
Spirits in the night. There are as
many different kinds of bars as
there are drinkers, and the most
popular ones — the Goose, the
O, 42nd Street, the BBC — are
treated elsewhere in the article.
We're concerned here with the
bar as a comfortable environment
in which to drink, as opposed to a
supportive environment in which
to get drunk.
The Gatehouse (265 Lytton
Ave., Palo Alto) is a snitzy res
taurant by day and a snitzy bar by
night, and one of the nicest places
to sit around in in Palo Alto. The
bar at Mama's (379 Stanford
Shopping Center) is a bit out of
the way, but it has a certain

hushed elegance that makes it at
tractive. Henry's (482 University
Ave., Palo Alto) is hot and
crowded once the dinner custom
ers clear out, but there's no one
on the make; just lots of success
ful young Palo Altans enjoying
their success in one of their favor
ite bars. Another bar that has a
"scene," but isn't a singles bar, is
that of the New Varsity (465 Uni
versity Ave., Palo Alto). Videos
play above the bar, musicians
play in the courtyard and lots of
Paly and Gunn High punks and
assorted young people play out in
the street in front and the alley
behind. It's noisy and crowded
and uncomfortable on the
weekends, but the people
watching is great. If you're
looking for something a little
more staid, try the bar at the rear
of the London House (630
Ramona St., Palo Alto), a loving
recreation of an English pub
where you can get most any
British beer you want, pub snacks
and a game of darts.
