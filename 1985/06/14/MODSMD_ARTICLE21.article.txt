Vertigo (1958)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
Alfred Hitchcock's film has an
eerie, seductive romanticism; the
combination of a richly suggestive
narrative, Kim Novak's other
worldly beauty in the first half of the
film, the heady Bernard Herrmann
music, and the hypnotic camerawork
in the most famous sequences is ex
tremely powerful, on a pop level.
Despite what its many devotees have
said of it, the movie doesn't really
address the topics of necrophilia and
death wish (it's more Freudly than
Freudian), but you watch it with the
same fascination and impatience
with which you might read a sexy
murder mystery that keeps you
awake half the night. With James
Stewart, who has one fine scene, as
the ex-cop who falls in love with the
haunted woman he was hired to fol
low (Novak), and Barbara Bel
Geddes (who gives the best perfor
mance). Alec Coppel and Samuel
Taylor adapted the screenplay from
a novel called "D'entre les Morts"
by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Nar
cejac; Robert Burks shot it. in Tech
nicor, in and around San Francisco;
Saul Bass designed the credits and
John Ferren the dream sequence.
Plays Saturday with "Rear Win
dow."
Rambo
Palo Alto Square
When John Rambo (Sylvester
Stallone) is released from prison by
his old commander (Richard
Crenna) on the condition that he
return to Vietnam to track down
Ml As, his terse reply is a Reagan-era
classic: "Sir, do we get to win this
time?" No doubt this hit picture,
scripted by Stallone and James
Cameron and directed by George
Cosmatos, is deeply offensive —
politically moronic and ultra-racist
— but it's difficult to keep that in
mind when you're sorting through
the idiocies of the plot, which pits
Stallone against thousands of Viet
namese and Russians, headed by a
malevolent Steven Berkoff. (His
performance is among the movie's
greater offenses.) Stallone goes for
the Clint Eastwood prize, carefully
removing anything that might look
like expressiveness from his face, but
he throws it away in the final scene,
when he gives the "We vets just want
America to love us as much as we
love it" speech in a tear-choked
tremolo. You may choke, too, espe
cially when you hear Stallone's
brother Frank on the theme song
("Peace in My Life") on the end
credits. Shot by the prodigious Jack
Cardiff, who makes the movie look
much better than it deserves to.
Streetwise (1984)
Aquarius, Palo Alto
This documentary about Seattle
teenagers living off the streets con
tains the most provocative cast of
characters in months: Tiny, a 14-
year-old hooker with an eternal
toothy grin and an alcoholic mother
who is a hash joint waitress; her best
friend. Rat, who lives in an
abandoned hotel and rescues much
of hi food from a local dumpster;
DeWayne, who looks wasted and
malnourished when he visits his
father in prison; Shelley, who was
molested by her stepfather and
whose mother can't understand why
Shelley hasn't forgiven him for it.
These young people play out their
life stories unsensationally and with
some irony in this emotionally com
plex movie, which functions as an
antidote to "The Breakfast Club."
Cheryl McCall and Mary Ellen Mark
fashioned it out of their Life maga
zine article, "Stories of the Losat,"
and Martin Bell directed and
photographed.
A View to a Kill
Old Mill 6, Mountain View; l)A
Redwood 6, Redwood City
"A View to a Kill," the 15th
James Bond movie, has an unusually
clever and reasonable plot, and

Christopher Walken and Grace
Jones make a great pair of villains.
But Roger Moore is way too old for
us to believe any of his stunts, and
his leading ladies are looking more
like his daughters with each film; the
series needs a strong central charac
ter, and Moore is dead air on the
screen. Director John Glen and the
rest of the crew have done a better
job of distracting us from this central
void this time out; "A View to a
Kill" is scaled just right, and the plot
seems cleaner and the incidents less
random than usual. The climax, set
atop the Golden Gate Bridge, is ex
citing in a way that the last few
Bond's weren't; Glen sets up the
angles so we always get a sense of
great height, and the shots down the
cables instill a real vertigo. With
Tanya Roberts as the girl next door.

A Private Function
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
This English comedy of manners
transpires in a small Yorkshire town
in where the continued ration
ing of food and gasoline has lent a
new color to the class struggle: to
drive a car and serve ham and pork
at one's repast are signs of social dis
tinction, though (to a greater or les
ser degree) everyone is suffering
some deprivation or indignity. Alan
Bennett wrote this movie, which
doesn't take off right away but gets
funnier and funnier as it bounds
along, and Malcolm Mowbray di
rected it. Michael Palin (in an un
characteristically restrained
performance) plays Gilbert Chilvers,
the chiropodist who steals a pig to up
his social status, and Maggie Smith
gives a perfect comic performance as
his wile, who. Lady Macbeth-like,
eggs him on. Among the other bright
lights in the cast are Bill Paterson,
Denholm Elliott, Richard Griffiths,
Amanda Gregan, Philip Wileman
and the unforgettable Liz Smith as
Mrs. Chilvers' dotty mother. Stuart
Walker, the production designer, has
aided Mowbray considerably by sup
plying some delightful period
touches.
The Gods Must Be Crazy (1984)
Guild, Menlo Park
Do people love this picture be
cause the comedy is lowest common
denominator burlesque (really
primal — sub-Three Stooges stuff)
under the guise of political satire?
The writer-director-photographer
editor, Jamie Uys, seems to know
what he's doing when there's no one
on screen but his charming bushman
hero, Ki, and a baboon or an ele
phant, but the moment other human
beings show up his routines (and
camerawork) become so crude you'd
swear he'd never seen a movie.
Marius Weyers, as the biologist in
the Kalahari Desert who falls apart
when he's around a beautiful
woman, dominates most of the film,
and he's appalling. (It's not merely
that his timing is bad; he has no ap
parent sense of humor at all.) The
story line has something to do with
his romance with a transplanted ur
ban schoolteacher, with desperate
rebels taking hostages and with Ki's
efforts to get rid of a Coca Cola bot
tle dropped from a passing plane
onto his tribe, and which he con
siders a lunatic, burdensome gift
from the gods. (Thus the title.) The
target of Uys' satire is obvious — a
confused (mostly white) urban soci
ety.
Witness
Palo Alto Square
In the men's room of a Philadel
phia train station. Samuel Lapp
(Lukas Haas), a little Amish boy on
his first trip away from home, wit
nesses a cop's brutal murder; taken
in for questioning along with his
reluctant mother, Rachel, a young
widow (Kelly McGillis), he identifies
one of the killers — another cop. to
protect the Lapps and himself, the
detective in charge of the case. John
Book (Harrison Ford), brings the

Lapps home and hides out with
them. Peter Weir didn't select the
William Kelley-Earl Wallace script;
he replaced the director originally
signed for the project. But you
wouldn't guess that from looking at
the results; shot by John Seale,
"Witness" is a beauty. Weir's aware
ness that he has caught something
new on film in the Lancaster County
scenes is apparent in the rapt, won
drous tone of especially the early se
quences, and, in part because of the
talent of his two stars. Weir is able to
obtain an unexpected intensity in the
romance that develops between
them. However, underneath the
fairly transparent social conscience
play structure of the movie lurks an
other one — and the real (tin) heart
ot "Witness": it is a beautifully made
cops-and-robbers tale. At what point
does fine filmmaking become expert
manipulation? "Witness" straddles
the line. With Josef Sommer, Patti
Lupone and Alexander Gudonov.
Brewster's Millions
Old Mill 6. Mountain View
The idea of "Brewster's Millions"
— that someone must spend $30
million in 30 days, leaving himself
with no assets, in order to inherit a
much greater sum of money — isn't a
bad one, but it isn't a new one,
either. Richard Pryor is one of our
most hip, modern actors, and the
build-up for this movie made it look
like another "Silver Streak," with
Pryor trapped in an old, old movie
situation that suffocates him. Parts of
"Brewster's Millions" put Pryor in
the same straitjacket, and it's
depressing to watch him go through
the tired plot machinations; but
much of the screenplay (by Hershel
Weingrod and Timothy Harris) gives
Pryor just the loose, free-floating
kind of material he needs. It's his
best movie since "Live on the Sunset
Strip." Director Walter Hill's fast
paced, energizing touch works
amazingly well until the final mo
ments of this light comedy, when he
has to put across the movie's take
home moral message; the latter half
of the movie also suffers from the in
explicable absence of John Candy,
who, as Pryor's best friend and
baseball teammate, is the movie's
only other major comic force. With
Lonette McKee (in the thankless
role of the movie's social con
science), Stephen Collins and Hume
Cronyn.

Lost in America
Belmont
The first real comedy about
Yuppies has an entirely new kind of
energy, because the director-star,
Albert Brooks (who also co
authored the script, with Marcia
Johnson), doesn't make movies like
anybody else in the world. The
paradox at the heart of Brooks' style
as a comedian and as a filmmaker —
his affectless intensity — turns out to
be the perfect instrument for getting
on screen (and sending up) this new
wrinkle on the American sociocul
tural canvas. Brooks plays David
Howard, who banks on capping eight
years at a big-time advertising
agency in 1..A. with a promotion his
boss has practically promised him.
But he lands a transfer instead of the
promotion, and he explodes in his
employer's office and ends up fired.
Responding maniacally to this turn
of events. David decides that fate has
freed him and his wife Linda (Julie
Hagerty) to drop out of society, like
the heroes of his favorite movie,
"Easy Rider," so he persuades her to
quit Iter job. they liquidate all their
assets, buy a motor home and drive
off to look for America and them
selves. Brooks must have been in
spired both by Sinclair Lewis
("Babbitt") and Preston Sturgcs
("Sullivan's Travels"), but there's
something Magritte-ish about the
movie, too — it's like cinema verite
gone haywire. Not all the moments
in it pan out, and the movie takes a
sudden plunge to its ending before
we've had a chance to get used to the

Howards' new lifestyle; but it's a
delightful movie, and Brooks and
Hagerty are terrific together. With
memorable bits by Michael Greene,
Garry Marshall and Art Frankel.
Birdy (1984)
Belmont
Alan Parker's movie, which Sandy
Kroopf and Jack Behr culled from
William Wharton's novel, is good in
spite of itself. Parker focuses on the
intimate friendship of two high
school kids — Al Columbato
(Nicholas Cage), an athletic, charis
matic boy, and a strange, intense
outsider Al nicknames "Birdy"
(Matthew Modine) because of his
passionate interest in birds. The film
tells us that this camaraderie is the
only strong human connection Birdy
maintains, as his loving and empathic
relationship with the birds he keeps
and trains carries him farther and
farther away from the world he lives
in; and that despite Al's attempts to
"socialize" his pal, Al too feels
threatened by other people — the
consequence of a long-suppressed
rebellion against his tyrannical,
brutalizing father (Sandy Baron).
The story, told in a scries of Hash
backs, takes the boys to Vietnam,
which leaves both of them shattered,
Al physically. Birdy psychologically.
The screenplay is a bubbling brew of
1950s Freudianizing and '60s
depressive rhapsodizing about the
fate of the square peg in the round
hole and the impossibility of true
lyric flight in modern American soci
ety. Birdy is a cross between Rima
the Bird Girl from "Green Man
sions" and Peter Pan, and Al has
more than a trace of McMurphy
from "One Flew over the Cuckoo's
Nest." The material sounds terrible
(and it is), hut something almost
miraculous happens in director Alan
Parker's treatment of it that redeems
all the political, psychological and
metaphysical weight loaded onto its
back. He and his two leading actors
do such a superb job with the AI-
Birdy scenes that the friendship
becomes the essential theme of the
movie rather than just a useful
metaphor for all those other themes.
Shot by Michael Seresin and directed
by Parker in a "Shoot the Moon"
mood (they collaborated on that,
too), with attention to delicate
modulations of rhythm and quicksil
ver tonal shifts.
Perfect
Park, Menlo Park
Rolling Stone reporter Aaron Lat
ham wrote the script for "Perfect,"
basing it on two of his own Rolling
Stone articles (a John DeLorean in
terview and an aerobics expose), and
Rolling Stone's editor, Jann Wenner,

plays the editor of Rolling Stone —
named Mark Roth. Wenner's name
change makes about as much sense
as anything else in this movie, which
manages the curious feat of being
both confusing and predictable at the
same time. John Travolta once again
wastes his considerable talents, this
time on a combination love
story/"Absence of Malice"-style
journalism epic (both plots are un
believably sentimental); director
James Bridges' appears to have
made no attempt to tie the two plot
threads together, and the brilliant
cinematographer Gordon Willis
seems to working at the bottom of
his form here — perhaps he was
taking his revenge on the material. A
serious look at aerobics might have
served as the basis of a good movie,
but here aerobics only serves as an
editing device — whenever Bridges
needs a transition between his
various plot strands, he cuts in 30
seconds of sweating bodies. With
that great stone face. Jamie Lee
Curtis, as the aerobics queen, and
Marilu Henner and Laraine New
man as women who find love at the
gym.

The Adventures of Buckaroo
Banzai (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This New Wave comic strip ad
venture, with its parodic echoes of
"MHAfISHHfI" and "Annie Hall"
and the whole catalog of Hollywood
sci-fi pictures from the 19505, is con
sistently funny, despite the plot con
fusion and the unsuccessful efforts of
first-time-out director W.D. Richter
to balance several dozen narrative
and character elements. The story
plunks the Japanese-American cos
mic coot leading man Buckaroo
(Peter Weller, of the electric blue
eyes) and his gang, the Hong Kong
Cavaliers (scientists, rock rollers
and comic book supcrheroes), in the
middle of a war between the Black
Lectroids and the Red Lectroids. As
evil Dr. Lizardo, John Lithgow sends
up all the mad scientists who ever
appeared on screen. Some of the
other talented performers (Ellen
Barkin, Jeff Goldblum, Christopher
Lloyd, Lewis Smith) get buried un
der piles of narrative debris, but
Richter's all-systems-go direction
demonstrates an appreciation of
screenwriter Earl Mac Rauch's in
vention, and he collaborates with
production designer J. Michael Riva,
costume designer Aggie Guerrard
Rodgers. and special visual effects
supervisor Michael Fink, as well as
the usually unyielding photographer
Fred Koenekamp, to bring off some
nifty pop sequences and dress
parades.
Plays as the late show Friday.
