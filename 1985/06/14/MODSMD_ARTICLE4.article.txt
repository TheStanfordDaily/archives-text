# Cuomo to give graduation speech
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Staff writer 
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo came to
the forefront of the American political
scene after his impassioned keynote ad
dress at last summer's Democratic Na
tional Convention in San Francisco.
"We must get the American public to
look past the glitter, beyond the showman
ship, to the reality, the hard substance of
things," Cuomo told the delegates. "And
we'll do it not so much with speeches that
sound good as with speeches that are good
and sound."
As a possible future presidential candi
date and the governor of the nation's
second most populous state, Cuomo
delivers his speeches with political clout
and oratorical ability that few politicians
can rival. Drawing from his ethnic roots
and a lengthy career in public service,
Cuomo's speeches combine conservative
sounding themes of family and ethnicity
with liberal ideology on the role of govern
ment.
The youngest child of immigrants from
Salerno, Italy, Mario Matthew Cuomo of
ten uses the image of his hard-working
father, "a small man with thick calluses on
both hands," and his family's struggle to
make its neighborhood market in Queens
succeed to stress the ideals of sacrifice and
hard work.
Cuomo, who will turn 53 Saturday, was
educated at St. John's College and St.
John's Law School. While working for a
Brooklyn law firm, he became involved in
politics and considered running for the
mayor of New York City in 1973.
Although Cuomo lost a 1974 race for
lieutenant governor in the Democratic pri
mary, he was appointed secretary of state
later that year by then Gov. Hugh Carey, a
classmate of Cuomo at St. John's.
Following a 1977 defeat by Ed Koch in
the New York City mayoral race, Cuomo
was again chosen by Carey as his running

mate in their victorious gubernatorial cam
paign of 1978.
Cuomo spent the next four years build
ing his political base, culminating in his
election to governor in 1982, a campaign
which featured a victory over Koch in the
Democratic primary and the eventual
defeat of Republican Lewis E. Lehrman,
the biggest-spending candidate in New
York history.

Cuomo quickly gained fame as an inspir
ing speaker and a leading proponent of
"pragmatic liberalism" in the Democratic
Party. Because of his triumphant appear
ance at the Democratic National Conven
tion, Cuomo is also widely regarded as a
possible presidential candidate, but has yei
to indicate any future political aspirations.
Peter Quinn, Cuomo's principal speech
writer, told The New York Times that
Cuomo sees this series of commencement
addresses as direct results of three

speeches he delivered outlining his
thoughts on morality and the philosophy of
government, including his keynote address
to the Democratic National Convention
and a later speech at the University of
Notre Dame on abortion.
Cuomo found himself in the midst of po
litical turmoil following his Notre Dame
appearance. In the September 13 speech,
Cuomo, a devout Catholic, said Catholics
should lead by example rather than impose
their views on the entire nation.
Cuomo's speech drew criticism from
then Archbishop John O'Conner of New
York, who previously said a Catholic "in
good conscience can not vote for a candi
date who explicitly supports abortion."
O'Conner, recently installed as Cardinal,
had earlier criticized Democratic vice pres
idential candidate Geraidine Ferraro for
espousing a similar view.
Cuomo's Stanford address will be the
last on his schedule of 11 commencement
speeches this year, up from a total of two
last year Despite invitations from many
public institutions, Cuomo is continuing his
philosophy of speaking only at private col
leges' and universities' graduation
ceremonies. The Stanford commencement
will also be his only speech outside the
Northeast.
In commencement addresses he has
given this year, Cuomo has stressed the im
portance of individual involvement in
politics, and social concerns. Speaking to
2,021 degree candidates at the University
of Rochester s commencement on May 12,
Cuomo exhorted the students to become
involved in the political system to make it
more fair and more responsive.
"Much of the talent here," Cuomo told
the graduates, "much of your enormous
potential, will go into the world of busi
ness, of science, of law or academics, and in
the process bring new strengths, new im
provements to our society. But there will
probably be no similar commitment to our

political process, even if just at the level of
voting or advocating. I'm afraid we'll pay a
price for this. In fact, I think the disinterest
in politics is already affecting us negatively
and perversely."
On May 26, Cuomo urged graduating
students at Vassar College and Colgate
University to be concerned about the
plight of the poor in America. Cuomo told
the 565 members of Vassar's 121st
graduating class to use the knowledge they
had acquired to help society progress while
easing social ills.
"We need to assert those values taught
here at Vassar," Cuomo said. "We need
you to assert those values on the mean
streets beyond these walls. Despite the glit
ter. the success and the joy surrounding
you, all is not well in the world we live in."
A few hours later at Colgate, Cuomo
gave the 642 graduates a similar message
and then accepted an honorary Doctor of
Laws degree for government service char
acterized by "thoughtfulness and deep
humanity."
"We need people who understand how
all the parts relate, who know that unless
we infuse all of our strivings and compas
sion with intelligent concern for the com
mon good, then we will be just another rich
and affluent society that struts and frets its
hour on the world stage."
Taking the stage as the featured speaker
of Harvard's Class Day ceremony on June
5, Cuomo departed from his past com
mencement practices, telling the rain
soaked crowd that the United States is be
coming a country of "shrunken aspirations
and diminished confidence," and that
America has "changed course" for the
worse since the election of President
Reagan.
Cuomo cited the newly released Reagan
tax plan as evidence of this. "It's a great
game of winners and losers in which blind
evenhandedness is confused with equity,"
Cuomo said.

make its neighborhood market in Queens
succeed to stress the ideals of sacrifice and
hard work.
Cuomo, who will turn 53 Saturday, was
educated at St. John's College and St.
John's Law School. While working for a
Brooklyn law firm, he became involved in
politics and considered running for the
mayor of New York City in 1973.
Although Cuomo lost a 1974 race for
lieutenant governor in the Democratic pri
mary, he was appointed secretary of state
later that year by then Gov. Hugh Carey, a
classmate of Cuomo at St. John's.
Following a 1977 defeat by Ed Koch in
the New York City mayoral race, Cuomo
was again chosen by Carey as his running

mate in their victorious gubernatorial cam
paign of 1978.
Cuomo spent the next four years build
ing his political base, culminating in his
election to governor in 1982, a campaign
which featured a victory over Koch in the
Democratic primary and the eventual
defeat of Republican Lewis E. Lehrman,
the biggest-spending candidate in New
York history.

Cuomo quickly gained fame as an inspir
ing speaker and a leading proponent of
"pragmatic liberalism" in the Democratic
Party. Because of his triumphant appear
ance at the Democratic National Conven
tion, Cuomo is also widely regarded as a
possible presidential candidate, but has yei
to indicate any future political aspirations.
Peter Quinn, Cuomo's principal speech
writer, told The New York Times that
Cuomo sees this series of commencement
addresses as direct results of three

speeches he delivered outlining his
thoughts on morality and the philosophy of
government, including his keynote address
to the Democratic National Convention
and a later speech at the University of
Notre Dame on abortion.
Cuomo found himself in the midst of po
litical turmoil following his Notre Dame
appearance. In the September 13 speech,
Cuomo, a devout Catholic, said Catholics
should lead by example rather than impose
their views on the entire nation.
Cuomo's speech drew criticism from
then Archbishop John O'Conner of New
York, who previously said a Catholic "in
good conscience can not vote for a candi
date who explicitly supports abortion."
O'Conner, recently installed as Cardinal,
had earlier criticized Democratic vice pres
idential candidate Geraidine Ferraro for
espousing a similar view.
Cuomo's Stanford address will be the
last on his schedule of 11 commencement
speeches this year, up from a total of two
last year Despite invitations from many
public institutions, Cuomo is continuing his
philosophy of speaking only at private col
leges' and universities' graduation
ceremonies. The Stanford commencement
will also be his only speech outside the
Northeast.
In commencement addresses he has
given this year, Cuomo has stressed the im
portance of individual involvement in
politics, and social concerns. Speaking to
2,021 degree candidates at the University
of Rochester s commencement on May 12,
Cuomo exhorted the students to become
involved in the political system to make it
more fair and more responsive.
"Much of the talent here," Cuomo told
the graduates, "much of your enormous
potential, will go into the world of busi
ness, of science, of law or academics, and in
the process bring new strengths, new im
provements to our society. But there will
probably be no similar commitment to our

political process, even if just at the level of
voting or advocating. I'm afraid we'll pay a
price for this. In fact, I think the disinterest
in politics is already affecting us negatively
and perversely."
On May 26, Cuomo urged graduating
students at Vassar College and Colgate
University to be concerned about the
plight of the poor in America. Cuomo told
the 565 members of Vassar's 121st
graduating class to use the knowledge they
had acquired to help society progress while
easing social ills.
"We need to assert those values taught
here at Vassar," Cuomo said. "We need
you to assert those values on the mean
streets beyond these walls. Despite the glit
ter. the success and the joy surrounding
you, all is not well in the world we live in."
A few hours later at Colgate, Cuomo
gave the 642 graduates a similar message
and then accepted an honorary Doctor of
Laws degree for government service char
acterized by "thoughtfulness and deep
humanity."
"We need people who understand how
all the parts relate, who know that unless
we infuse all of our strivings and compas
sion with intelligent concern for the com
mon good, then we will be just another rich
and affluent society that struts and frets its
hour on the world stage."
Taking the stage as the featured speaker
of Harvard's Class Day ceremony on June
5, Cuomo departed from his past com
mencement practices, telling the rain
soaked crowd that the United States is be
coming a country of "shrunken aspirations
and diminished confidence," and that
America has "changed course" for the
worse since the election of President
Reagan.
Cuomo cited the newly released Reagan
tax plan as evidence of this. "It's a great
game of winners and losers in which blind
evenhandedness is confused with equity,"
Cuomo said.


Gov. Mario Cuomo
Commencement speaker
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo came to
the forefront of the American political
scene after his impassioned keynote ad
dress at last summer's Democratic Na
tional Convention in San Francisco.
"We must get the American public to
look past the glitter, beyond the showman
ship, to the reality, the hard substance of
things," Cuomo told the delegates. "And
we'll do it not so much with speeches that
sound good as with speeches that are good
and sound."
As a possible future presidential candi
date and the governor of the nation's
second most populous state, Cuomo
delivers his speeches with political clout
and oratorical ability that few politicians
can rival. Drawing from his ethnic roots
and a lengthy career in public service,
Cuomo's speeches combine conservative
sounding themes of family and ethnicity
with liberal ideology on the role of govern
ment.
The youngest child of immigrants from
Salerno, Italy, Mario Matthew Cuomo of
ten uses the image of his hard-working
father, "a small man with thick calluses on
both hands," and his family's struggle to
make its neighborhood market in Queens
succeed to stress the ideals of sacrifice and
hard work.
