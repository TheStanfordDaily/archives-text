# Sprucing up the stadium
## Commencement decor complete 
### KATHY OLMSTED 
Ticket holders will enjoy the
colorful spectacle of a gleaming
white, Victorian-style stage and
1,000 bright red banners as part
of the University's decoration of
Stanford Stadium for Commence
ment today.
The material for the decora
tions and the labor for their in
stallation will cost the University
more than $200,000, according to
Nan Bentley, assistant director of
University Events and Services.
The decorations include 1,000
red banners in the stadium
emblazoned with the University's
Centennial logo and 200 identical
banners stationed throughout
campus. The banners in the
stadium will be draped across the
bleachers on the east side.
In addition, a large, white stage
that looks like a "collection of
Victorian garden party tents,"
Bentley said, occupies the center
of the football field. The stage
was designed by Greg Lynch of
the Stanford Art Department.
Bentley said she thought the
various decorations would trans
form the appearance of the
stadium. "1 don't think it will
have an impersonal look at all,"
she said.
In addition to the Centennial
banners and the stage, the Com
mencement decorations include
color-coded banners matching
the color of the spectators' tick
ets. These banners will mark the
stadium's gates, helping visitors
to find their seats, Bentley said.
The University also put a spe
cial kind of plastic turf on parts of
the field to protect the grass from
damage.
Fortunately for the University,
the stadium recently underwent a
major renovation program in

preparation for Superbowl XIX,
held here in January. As a result,
the stadium is in prime condition.
"Everything is in better shape,"
Bentley said.
The University is also using the
safety plan drawn up for the
Super Bowl. Two ambulances and

two first-aid stations will help
meet the health needs of visitors.
Bentley said she anticipated
that heat exhaustion would be the
most common complaint. To help
spectators endure the heat, the
University is selling refreshments
and providing ice water at several

locations.
Golf carts will be available for
transporting disabled visitors, and
wheelchair access will be
available at Gate 5.
The staff at Events and
Services has been working hard to
prepare the stadium for the elab

orate ceremonies. In addition to
working on the decorations and
safety plans, Stanford staff mem
bers have drawn up detailed ar
rangements for the seating of
various groups.


Preparations for Sunday's 94th Commencement take place last Wednesday. banners are part of the decorations for the stadium.
Undergraduates will be seated
on the grassy field facing the
stage. Graduates will sit in the
lower portion of the center sec
tion of the bleachers on the west
side of the stadium.
About 4,200 graduates, 350
faculty members and 35 to 40
trustees and former trustees will
participate in the ceremonies.
The graduates will receive their
diplomas at the 35 individual de
partment ceremonies that follow
the main ceremony.
For years, the University held
its Commencement ceremonies in
Frost Amphitheatre. However,

increasing crowds forced Stanford
to move the event to the Sunken
Diamond last year.
Poor sight lines, inadequate
facilities and the tremendous
crowds expected to turn out to
hear Commencement speaker
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo
forced the move to the even big
ger stadium this year. The only
previous Commencement held in
the stadium was in 1935.
The University had distributed
30,000 tickets as of last week,
Bentley said. Students are now
allowed an unlimited number of
tickets because of the large size of
the stadium. Events and Services
expects at total of about 40,000
people to attend — about twice as
many as last year.
