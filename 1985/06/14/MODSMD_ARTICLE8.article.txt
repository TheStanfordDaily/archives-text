# Baccalaureate Saturday
## Napier to speak 
### 
The Rev. B. Davie Napier,
dean of the chapel and profes
sor of religion at Stanford from
1966 to 1972, is the featured
speaker at the University's
1985 baccalaureate service to
be held at 9 a.m. tomorrow in
Frost Amphitheater.
Approximately 6,000
people, including graduates,
their families and faculty are
expected to attend the non
denominational ceremony.
Napier is an ordained mini
ster of the United Church. He
was born in Kuling, China, in
1915, and is the son of mis
sionaries. He came to the
United States when he was 15
years old after attending
schools in both China and
Japan.
He received a bachelor of
divinity degree cum laude from
Yale in 1939 and his doctorate
in 1944. Before becoming a
member of the Stanford com
munity, he spent 17 years on
the faculty at Yale as a profes
sor of the Old Testament.
At Stanford, Napier was
known among the students for
relating the Scripture to the
politics of the late 19605. In
1971 he was among the nine
Bay Area clergymen, profes
sors and engineers, who used
non-violent civil disobedience
to prevent entry to the San
Mateo Draft Board.
Napier left Stanford in 1972
to accept the presidency of the

Pacific School of Religion in
Berkeley.
Upon his departure, then-
University President Richard
Lyman said, "Regret is hardly
an adequate word to express
my feelings about Dean
Napier's decision to leave
Stanford. In his five years here
he has responded eloquently to

the growing student search for
religious meaning and values."
"The church, for many stu
dents, has been an integral and
vital part of the total Univer
sity experience," Lyman said.
Napier left the Pacific
School of Religion in 1978 and
has since been involved with


Rev. B. Davie Napier
Bacca la u re ate speaker
