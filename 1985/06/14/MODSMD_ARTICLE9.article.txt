## Senior relics saved 
### CHARLIE GOFEN SUSAN GOODHUE 
What do tiki trunks, USA for
Africa's "We are the World" al
bum, and SAE President Gerry
Morgan's name tag from spring
rush all have in common?
All three items are included in
a colorful assortment of items
crammed into a 15 in. x 15 in. x 5
in. metal box that will be placed
under the Class of 1985's plaque
in an Inner Quad ceremony.
The time capsule will be "sunk
in" at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow, ac
cording to Senior Class President
Jim Duffey, who says he was in
charge of selecting the items that
would best represent "some of
the major events and common
themes" in the lives of members
of this year's Senior Class.
Duffey said there was no over
riding theme for the items chosen
but that all dealt with current is
sues and lifestyles.
The time capsule is meant to be
opened in 100 years, at which
time Stanford administrators will
praise Duffey and his classmates
for opting not to follow a tradi
tion of including a Domino's
pizza.
No one knows exactly when
graduating classes here began
putting time capsules under their
class plaques, but the Class of
1896 was the first to place a
plaque in the Quad. That year,
Ray Lyman Wilbur, who later
became president of the Univer
sity, and his classmates set a
plaque marked with "96" in front
of Memorial Church. (The Class
of 1895 — the first class to com
plete four years at Stanford —
returned later to dedicate its own
plaque on campus.)
According to University Ar
chivist Roxanne Nilan, the Class
of 1896 did not originate the idea
of burying objects here. She said
Jane Stanford liked to bury signif
icant items — a Bible or papers

relevant to a building's construc
tion — under cornerstones of
campus buildings.
Jane Stanford may have been a
bit less keen about burying some
of the items Duffey selected,
which included a first notification
of overdue material from Green
Library, a Super Bowl pennant, a
Chili's menu, a photo from Alpha
Sig's Exotic Erotic Ball, and a can
of new Coke.
One item not included, despite
popular demand, was a Dutch
Goose T-shirt. Duffey explained
that he was carded when trying to
enter Stanford's favorite hang
out and was unable to get in be
cause he had no ID with him.
Some of the other items in the
Class of 1 985's time capsule are:
tickets from the 1985 Big Game
and UCLA game, Viennese Ball,
Senior Formal, Graduation, and
Moscone Center Super Bowl
party; matchbooks from Com
padres and the Hard Rock Cafe;
copies of Stanford Daily stories
on the 1984 Presidential election,
the Super Bowl, the fraternity
debate, apartheid protests and
varsity sports; a tuition deferment
form; Prince's "Purple Rain" and
Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the
USA" record albums; and several
parking tickets.
Also included are: a cassette
tape of "A guided tour of Macin
tosh"; a notification of human
rights violations issued to Stan
ford trustees' cars by the student
coalition, Stanford Out of South
Africa; yellow tape from the
ever-present construction sites on
campus; Far Side and Bloom
County comic strips; a designated
driver card, a flash foto order en
velope; a campaign poster from
Walter Mondale's campus visit; a
shot glass from Senior Casino
Night; a Corona beer bottle; a
document on the University s
Centennial; and a brick from the
newlv refinished Ouad.
