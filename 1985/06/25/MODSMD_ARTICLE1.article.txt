# Bursar's Office arrests
## Student trial begins 
### JAN GOBEN Staff writer 
PALO ALTO — The first day of what looks to
be a long trial for nine Stanford students arrested
for protesting Stanford's South Africa-related in
vestments ended without any jurors being selec
ted.
The seven men and two women, many of them
members of Stanford Out of South Africa
(SOSA), were arrested May 28 after staging a sit
in to protest the University's investments in com
panies that do business with South Africa. The
nine were charged with trespassing and failing to
disperse when they remained in the Bursar's Of
fice in Old Union past closing time.
The two sides failed to agree on seating any of
the potential jurors yesterday during county
court proceedings here, nor could they concur on
when the trial will end.
Steve Nakano, the defense attorney represent
ing five of the arrested students, speculated that
the trial will last "at least one week — possibly
into next week." John Schon, the prosecuting at
torney, said, "My case will take a day," but added
that the defense's rebuttals could extend the trial.
Only six of the arrested students appeared in
court yesterday morning. The other three,
William Northway, Todd Ramming and Michael
Tarpey, were out of state. Four of the six who ap
peared in court declared they would represent
themselves, even after Judge Franklin Elia
warned that this would be "an unwise decision."
Caroline Paul and Jennifer G. Grant, among
those representing themselves, later decided to
plea no contest. Such a plea could bring the same
consequences as a guilty plea, with a maximum
sentence of one year in jail and a maximum fine
of $1,700.
"On a personal level I don't want to get side
tracked into the legal system because it's a moral
issue," Paul said, explaining her no-contest plea.
"I don't see any benefits arising out of dragging
the University through a whole trial."
After the noon recess, David Magnus, who also
had been representing himself, returned with an
attorney to represent him.

David Romo, the only remaining defendant
representing himself, said he will "appeal to the
common sense of justice rather than the legal
technicalities of the case."
The prospective jurors were questioned ex
tensively by the attorneys and Romo, and several
were dismissed because of personal feelings that
might interfere with the fairness of the trial.
One of those released from jury duty was
Thomas Binford, a Stanford computer science
professor. A woman who had participated in
anti-apartheid protests at UC-Berkeley also was
excused, as was a banker who said he owned
stock in companies doing business with South
Africa.
