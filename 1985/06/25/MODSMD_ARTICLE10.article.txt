## HENRY ORGAN Summer: time for divestment 
### 
I have followed with consider
able interest the activities on
campus concerning the
divestiture issue, activities which
have been initiated largely by stu
dents. Now, while most students
are away, I believe it important
that other members of the Uni
versity community, particularly
the staff, maintain vigil.
One theme that appears to run
through the administration's and
others' opposition to divestiture is
that it would deny sellers the op
portunity to take a stand or make
their position known to the com-

VIEWPOINT

pany in question. One did not
have to be a slaveholder to sup
port the abolition of slavery, one
does not have to be nuked to
oppose nuclear proliferation and
warfare; one does not have to be
hungry to oppose hunger; and
one does not have J\jp be sen
tenced to die to oppose capital
punishment. Thus, one does not
have to be a stockholder to
oppose apartheid and the pres
ence of U.S. companies in South
Africa.
Indeed, the Board of Trustees
of the University has a fiduciary
responsibility regarding the Uni
versity's assets. Divestiture,
however, does not necessarily
mean a financial loss. Likewise,
on the monetary aspect of this
issue, I do recall several years ago
a number of universities refusing
to accept substantial sums of
money from certain oil-producing
countries, and, in fact, one or two
universities were even persuaded
to return vast sums to those
countries when objections were
raised by faculty, alumni and
others.
The assertion has been made
from various quarters that this is a
complex issue, and that compan

ies must be evaluated on a case
by-case basis. This is not a com
plex issue. It is made complex by
those who are evasive, who do
not want to make a change, who
do not want to make a decision,
or who are supporters of apart
heid. Although this spectrum of
positions is quite wide, the posi
tions are uniform in their result —
apartheid remains intact.
Companies do not have to be
evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
Not only is the University un
equipped to take on this bur
densome, on-going task, it is un
necessary. There is only one case:
the withdrawal of all companies
from South Africa until apartheid
is destroyed. These endless and
tangential discussions and
nuances about divestiture, the
Sullivan Principles, etc., can jus
tifiably be interpreted by Pretoria
as a lack of commitment, equiv
ocation, or support.
Another parameter that has
been introduced to complicate
matters further is the timetable
for the destruction of apartheid. I
believe the wrong timetable has
been introduced. There should be
no timetable for the withdrawal
of companies from South Africa;
there should be no timetable for
the divestiture of stock in com
panies operating there.
Divestiture, or when it should oc
cur, is not a negotiable issue; it
should be now, not two years
henceforth.
In summary, the problem must
be confronted on all fronts —
companies, the government
and, yes, at Stanford. If
this consortium is in force, with
Stanford, then I can assure the
administration that our collective
statements would not be empty
ones.
