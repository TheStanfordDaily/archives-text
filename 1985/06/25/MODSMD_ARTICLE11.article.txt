## 'What else is there?' 
### 
As a student completing my
first year on The Farm, I look
back and feel no regrets about
that decision I made almost ex
actly a year ago. Stanford offers
its students endless opportunities
not only to improve their minds
but also to sharpen their various
talents and to develop themselves
as well-rounded individuals. I
couldn't have asked any more
from a university.

VIEWPOINT

During my first year here,
however, I have observed a
frightening trend among Stanford
students — a trend for students to
become so tied to their narrow
pre-professional paths and so en
veloped in the campus social life
that they become totally wrapped
up in themselves and uncon
cerned about the rest of society
and the world. Stanford students
live by the ethic "work hard, play
hard," and most adhere to that
ethic without realizing how much
more their Stanford education
could be than just working and
playing.
"What else is there?" you ask.
"Stanford students are the
leaders of tomorrow, and we don't
have time to waste." But how
many of us leaders of tomorrow

really know what's going on in
this world we're going to lead?
What is that calculus book, or
that French grammar text, or that
beer keg going to teach us about
CIA involvement in Nicaragua,
or the plight of the black South
Africans, or the bloodshed in
Lebanon, or the oppression of
our black, Asian, Hispanic, gay,
female, etc., friends right here in
our country and on our campus?
Recently a 30-minute docu
mentary depicting the effects of
apartheid on black South
Africans was shown in my dorm.
Of the approximately 700 people
in the eight-house complex, at
most a dozen people showed up.
The film was well-advertised, and
even attempts to gently prod stu
dents to come and watch the film
were met with, "I have too many
other important things to do."
Strangely enough, most of
those same people who have too
much to do to see a 30-minute
documentary about apartheid
somehow manage to find the time
to see the two-hour Sunday flick
each week. Then there were the
students who already "knew" all
there was to know about apart
heid and so didn't need to bother
seeing the film; these students ex
hibit the same mentality as those

who already "know" that black
and Hispanic people are intellec
tually inferior and that gay people
are perverts and child molestors.
The implication is that by the
time the student has reached
Stanford, he or she "knows" all
there is to know about society and
the world. Such an incident is just
one example of the many signs of
student insensitivity to issues of
national and international con
cern.
By the time we graduate, many
of us will be on our way to be
coming "the leaders of tomor
row" by virtue of our Stanford
degrees alone. But has our self
centered "work hard, play hard"
ethic prepared us to lead the
world? How can we responsibly
lead others toward creating a bet
ter world when we've been more
concerned about how messy the
Quad is than about how we can
help or even learn about the suf
fering and oppressed peoples of
the world? Stanford students cer
tainly have the energy and the po
tential to effect improvements in
our society and world, but do we
channel our energy in directions
that will ever allow us to realize
that potential?
