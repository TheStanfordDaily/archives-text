## USSR has apartheid too 
### 
There is another apartheid in the world today,
one that is equally degrading, objectionable, and il
legitimate. Like the system in South Africa, it too is
based on a subject classification â€” religion. And
similarly, the victims have restricted rights, face per
secution and live under conditions of imposed eco
nomic hardship. It exists at this moment, in the So
viet Union, and I have experienced it firsthand.
Most of you have probably not heard of Abe
Stolvar. He's iust a cheerful, 74-vear-old retiree

VIEWPOINT

living in one of the many gray apartment high rises
on the outskirts of Moscow. His wife, Gita, keeps
the tiny, one-bedroom apartment immaculate, and
the hospitality they showed me last December belies
the hardship they face every day. For Abe and Gita
are Jewish, and wish to emigrate to Israel. But be
cause of a cruel trick played more than 10 years ago
by Soviet immigration officials, Abe and his family
have been denied their wish. As Abe describes his
status, in his heavy Chicago accent, "I am a non
person."
Yes, I did say Chicago accent. Abe is an Ameri
can citizen, passport No. Z32486053. His strange
story began when his parents, both committed
socialists, brought Abe and his sister to the Soviet
Union in 1931 from America.
Ten years later Abe, his wife and their
son Michael were granted exit visas to Israel. On
June 19, 1975, after selling their apartment and

sending their possessions ahead to Israel, the
Stolyars passed through customs and took their
seats on the plane. Only minutes before takeoff, the
KGB forcibly removed the Stolyars and, on the
pretext that Abe's wife had done classified work as a
chemist, were denied emigration.
Like all those granted permission to emigrate,
Abe was stripped of his Soviet citizenship, and the
authorities have refused to recognize his American
passport. He is a "non-person." Without papers, he
cannot work, travel outside the city, and his
numerous pleas to Soviet officials go unrecognized.
His son Michael, a distinguished mathematician, is
denied work fitting his qualifications, while his
college-aged daughter is refused the library books
she needs to study art. Michael, an orthodox Jew, is
not allowed to practice his faith, and like his father
believes their situation is a result of their religion.
Recently, the Soviet officials have granted permi
sion for the Stolyars to emigrate, but Michael must
leave his Russian-born wife behind.
As I left Abe, he made only two requests. One,
that I tell people his story, and two, that I send him
the one thing he enjoyed the most growing up in
Chicago: a jar of Skippy peanut butter. I did the lat
ter immediately upon returning home, but it took
the recent SOSA protests over apartheid to
motivate me to do the former.
We cannot be lulled into thinking that systems
like apartheid are unique and exist only in South
Africa. They don't.
