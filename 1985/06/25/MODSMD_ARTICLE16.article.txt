Incoming freshman killed
A high school graduate sched
uled to enroll at Stanford this fall
was shot and killed June 12 by a
New York City police officer on
plainclothes duty, according to
The New York Times. A grand
jury has been convened to inves
tigate the shooting of Edmund
Perry, which C. Vernon Mason,
the family's attorney, calls racially
motivated.
The Perry family has received
condolences from Stanford,
Mason said. "The family is very
appreciative of that." Perry
graduated with honors from Phil
lips Exeter Academy in Exeter,
N.H., earlier this month. He at
tended Exeter for four years un
der a scholarship program for
talented students.
Now police and the victim's
family are in dispute over the cir
cumstances of the shooting.
The officer, on patrol at about
9:30 p.m., said he was knocked
down from behind by Edmund
Perry and a companion, punched
and kicked in an apparent rob
bery attempt. He said he then
pulled a pistol from an ankle
holster and fired three shots, one
of which hit Perry in the stomach.
The wounded 17-year-old died in
a hospital operating room about
three-and-one-half hours later,
The Times reported.
The suspected accomplice
escaped, the officer said, and
though the police have said
publicly that they know the iden
tity of the second person, no ar
rests have been made, Richard
Nicastro, chief of detectives for
the New York City Police De
partment, said Monday.
Nicastro said a grand jury in
vestigation of the shooting has
been underway for about a week.
Grand jury investigations follow
all iaiai shootings by police offi

cers in New York Gity.
But Mason, representing the
victim's family, was quoted by the
New York paper as saying that
the shooting was unnecessary and
was "part of a pattern of police
violence against blacks and
Hispanic people, 'particularly our
young people.' " Perry was black,
and the officer was white.
" 'Why would a young black
man, a young man clearly on his
way up, on his way in the fall to
his choice of three of the finest
colleges in the country, attempt to
rob anyone?' " The Times quoted
Mason as asking in a press confer
ence.
" 'But if he did, why was deadly
force used to stop a 17-year-old
with no criminal record and no
weapon?' " Mason said in The
Times.
Mason said yesterday that "the
investigation they (the grand
jury) are conducting and the

manner in which they are con
ducting it is racist," hut would not
offer any specifics about the
proceedings. "I am not answering
questions relative to the police in
vestigation," he said.
"He was a good citizen here on
campus," said a spokesperson
from the Exeter.
Police say witnesses exist to
substantiate the account of their
officer, but are not disclosing
names pending the results of the
grand jury investigation.
Work begins on center
Excavation began last week on
the new $8.75 million Academic
Resources Center — a building
that will house two of the Univer
sity's computing systems and
several student service offices.
According to Curt Williams,
director of facilities and project
management, the new building,
being constructed by Olson Con

struction, is expected to be com
pleted by Aug. 15, 1986.
The three-story building will
have a stucco, sandstone-colored
finish and will be capped with a
red-tile roof, Williams said. It will
be L-shaped, witfi the interior of
the L becoming a courtyard
facing Meyer Library, and the
building's west facadc will be
primarily windows, he added. The
architects for the building are
Spencer Associates of Palo Alto.
The Academic Resources Cen
ter will be the base for two com
puter systems — Low Overhead
Time Sharing (LOTS) and the In
structional Research Information
Systems (IRIS) — and will house
five existing academic service
programs — the Undergraduate
Advising Center, Undergraduate
Research Opportunities, Stanford
Overseas Studies, the Center for
Teaching and Learning and the

Extradepartmental Education
Center.
Trustees vote C-IR resources
The Board of Trustees,
meeting June 14, approved addi
tional resources for the Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility
(C-IR) to investigate the Univer
sity's South Africa-related invest
ments and asked the commission
to consider proposed changes in
guidelines for investments in
South Africa.
In other action, the board said
it was "not prepared to accept as
a premise that corporate activity
in South Africa is, in itself, prima
facie evidence of substantial so
cial injury."
Organizers of the campus
group Stanford Out of South
Africa (SOSA) have said U.S.
companies doing business in
South Africa do substantial social
harm by providing an economic
base for the white-dominated
government. On that basis the
group has sought immediate di
vestment of University holdings
in companies that do business in
South Africa.
The additional resources to in
vestigate University investments,
provided in response to a request
from the commission, will be pro
vided in the form of staff mem
bers, according to Bob Hamrdla,
assistant to the president.
The exact number of extra
staffers that will be provided is
unclear, but University President
Donald Kennedy and William
Massy, vice president for business
and finance, told University News
Service that two to four students
may work with the University
staff this summer on investment
responsibility issues and said an
additional research analyst may
be employed in the future.
The trustees also approved
changes in the C-IR's voting
rules. The C-IR, a 12-member
group of faculty, students, staff
and alumni that advises a trustee
committee on the University's in
vestment policy, may now make
recommendations with the ap

Stanford, began last week. Construction of the center, which will house Stanford's computer networks as well
as several student service offices, is scheduled to be completed in Aug. 1986.
