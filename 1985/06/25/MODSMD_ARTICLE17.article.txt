## Cuomo denies '88 candidacy 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI

Divestment, an upcoming gubernatorial elec
tion and presidential aspirations were some of the
topics addressed by New York Governor Mario
Cuomo at an informal press conference following
Commencement exercises.
After taking off "his black speaker's robe,
Cuomo, surrounded by aides and security per
sonnel, spoke to a group of about 20 reporters
after being escorted up the Stanford Stadium
ramp by University President Donald Kennedy.
Cuomo, who is up for re-election as governor
next year, denied he is planning a run for the
presidency in 1988, calling the rumors
"flattering."
"I don't discourage it, especially in California,"
Cuomo said. "It's good for my state for people in
California to speculate about a governor of New
York being a presidential candidate. I don't think
it's real, and I don't even talk about it to New
York reporters. Next year they will be no discus
sion about it."
Cuomo said winning re-election as governor is
his primary concern. "I'm focusing on the gover
norship next year," Cuomo said. "I'm getting
ready to do that, and I'm a little concerned. I'm
told the Republicans are going to spend $20 mil
lion, and I don't have anything like that."
When questioned by a writer about the validity
of a report alleging he would earn up to $500,000
at a Los Angeles fundraiser the next evening,

Cuomo responded by asking the reporter if he
was "in the media." When the reporter answered
in the affirmative, Cuomo said, "Well, you
should know enough not to believe everything
you read.
"I don't know anything about $500,000," he
added. "If anybody wants to give me money for
next year's governor's race, I will accept it. If I
walk in and somebody comes up and says, 'I want
to give you $2,500,' or $25,000,1 guarantee you, if
it's legal, I'm not going to say no. If it's legal
â€¢ and for the governor's race, I'd be delighted."
Cuomo denied that the increase from two com
mencement addresses last year to 11 this year in
dicates he is seeking national office. "I said no
to about 24 (invitations)," Cuomo said. "Why
don't you take those 24 and say, 'He said no to 24
commencements, so I guess he's not running?' "
Cuomo also discussed the issue of South
African divestment, noting that his administra
tion was "very aggressively" lobbying the New
York state legislature to pass a divestment
statute. The proposal would give companies five
years to comply with the Sullivan principles and
would then call for total divestment, Cuomo said.
When asked how his philosophy of social con
cern could be incorporated into the Democratic
Party, Cuomo was noncommittal.
"I don't know, I'm not good at party politics,"
Cuomo said. "I don't have any advice for the
party except decide what your philosophy is.'
