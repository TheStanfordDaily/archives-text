# Saga will run Coffee House
## 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Editorial staff 
Tresidder Union announced
Thursday that Saga Corpora
tion has been "awarded the con
tract for the Tresidder Memorial
Union Food Services" effective
Sept. 1, and student officials of
the Coffee House are not happy.
"I was disappointed — we all
were disappointed — that they
chose Saga," Mark Thornburgh,
1984-85 Coffee House president,
told University News Service. "I
just cannot see that Saga can
come in and do a better job," he
said later.
In addition to the Coffee
House, Tresidder food services
include: the Main Course, Corner
Pocket, Baker Street, Patio Grill,
Encina Station and Tresidder
Catering. The current contracts
expire Aug. 31, and the new food
service contracts will be for five
years.
Six other contractors submitted
bids in the competitive process:
ARA, Canteen Corporation,
Coffee House, Inc., Crepes and
Crust, Service Systems/Manning
and Servomation. The Coffee
House, Inc., owned by the ASSU,
has operated the Coffee House
since 1980. Servomation was the
former contractor for the other
Tresidder food services.
The criteria used in the bidding
process included "the ability to
meet the needs of the University
community, meaningful student
involvement, prices, quality of
service, creativity, marketing and
training programs," according to
a Tresidder news release.
Saga has "proven experience"
and "strong marketing and train
ing plans," the release said. "A

special quality is Saga's commit
ment to working with current
Coffee House employees to per
petuate the existing high level of
student involvement and the
pleasant ambiance of the Coffee
House."
In addition, the dean of student
affairs will form a task force "in
the near future" to develop a
model to "preserve significant
student involvement in all levels
of the Coffee House operation,"
the release said.
Saga officials echoed a commit
ment to student involvement in
all levels of the food service
operations. "It is our intent that it
(the Coffee House) is still going
to be student-run," said Michael
Bauccio, southwest area vice
president for Saga. The students
will be involved "in a managerial
role as well as in peripheral
roles," he added. "We feel that is
what could be of benefit to stu
dents."
Jim Connelly, director of area
sales for Saga, said student in
volvement would also apply to all
of the food service operations,
and not just to the Coffee House.
Saga would probably involve stu
dents to a greater extent than
they are now, he said. "Our com
mitment is to hire as many stu
dents as possible."
Currently, owning the Coffee
House and managing the Corner
Pocket is the extent of student in
volvement.
Connelly and Bauccio said stu
dent managers from the Coffee
House have submitted three
models for student involvement,
and said Saga would meet with
students and Tresidder in the next
three to four weeks to forge an
agreement. "We hope to work
within one of those (student
submitted models)," Connelly
said.
But student involvement will
not be enough, according to Mark
Thornburgh, co-author of the
ASSU bid and manager of the
Coffee House during 1985-86. It
is "apparent that they just want
students in an advisory position,"
he said. "Students have to have a
significant role, otherwise it is just
doing Saga's dirty work."
Thornburgh maintains that
"Students have to have the final
say" in decisions made about the
Coffee House. It would be
"insane" to let Saga have final say
in decisions about prices, wages
and fundamental changes in the
Coffee House that will occur in
the next five years when it moves
from its present location into the
old bowling alley, he said.
The Coffee House and The
Store are scheduled to move into
that space in 1986. It is currently
occupied by terminals of the Low
Overhead Time Sharing (LOTS)
computer system.
According to Daniel Rosen, a
Coffee House employee who has
been active in the fight for stu
dent control, Tresidder manage
ment wants "to change the whole
idea of the Coffee House" in the

long run.
Basically, Rosen said, there are
two proposed plans for the Coffee
House. One would leave the Cof
fee House intact but would en
large it. The other plan would
change it into "a yuppie restau
rant with table service and
upgraded food," he said.
Tresidder favors the latter plan,
which would "change it from a
student coffee house into a staff
restaurant," he added.
Having Saga make decisions
about the atmosphere, what sort
of clientele the Coffee House will
seek to attract and the general
purpose of the Coffee House will
mean "decisions which define the
place are not in student control,"
Rosen said.
Nanci Howe, assistant director
of Tresidder, said some changes
will be made when the Coffee
House moves but said Tresidder
currently has a review process for
evaluating "significant changes"
in Tresidder food services and
that would continue to be fol
lowed in the future.
In the meantime, Rosen said he
would proceed with plans to or
ganize a boycott of the Saga
owned Coffee House to try to
pressure Tresidder and Saga into
backing out of their contract and
turning the Coffee House back
over to students. Rosen said he
also plans to set up an alternative,
student-run Coffee House in the
fall. Such a place might be estab
lished in the basement of a co-op
or in the boathouse, he said.

he said. "Students have to have a
significant role, otherwise it is just
doing Saga's dirty work."
Thornburgh maintains that
"Students have to have the final
say" in decisions made about the
Coffee House. It would be
"insane" to let Saga have final say
in decisions about prices, wages
and fundamental changes in the
Coffee House that will occur in
the next five years when it moves
from its present location into the
old bowling alley, he said.
The Coffee House and The
Store are scheduled to move into
that space in 1986. It is currently
occupied by terminals of the Low
Overhead Time Sharing (LOTS)
computer system.
According to Daniel Rosen, a
Coffee House employee who has
been active in the fight for stu
dent control, Tresidder manage
ment wants "to change the whole
idea of the Coffee House" in the

long run.
Basically, Rosen said, there are
two proposed plans for the Coffee
House. One would leave the Cof
fee House intact but would en
large it. The other plan would
change it into "a yuppie restau
rant with table service and
upgraded food," he said.
Tresidder favors the latter plan,
which would "change it from a
student coffee house into a staff
restaurant," he added.
Having Saga make decisions
about the atmosphere, what sort
of clientele the Coffee House will
seek to attract and the general
purpose of the Coffee House will
mean "decisions which define the
place are not in student control,"
Rosen said.
Nanci Howe, assistant director
of Tresidder, said some changes
will be made when the Coffee
House moves but said Tresidder
currently has a review process for
evaluating "significant changes"
in Tresidder food services and
that would continue to be fol
lowed in the future.
In the meantime, Rosen said he
would proceed with plans to or
ganize a boycott of the Saga
owned Coffee House to try to
pressure Tresidder and Saga into
backing out of their contract and
turning the Coffee House back
over to students. Rosen said he
also plans to set up an alternative,
student-run Coffee House in the
fall. Such a place might be estab
lished in the basement of a co-op
or in the boathouse, he said.
Tresidder Union announced
Thursday that Saga Corpora
tion has been "awarded the con
tract for the Tresidder Memorial
Union Food Services" effective
Sept. 1, and student officials of
the Coffee House are not happy.
"I was disappointed — we all
were disappointed — that they
chose Saga," Mark Thornburgh,
1984-85 Coffee House president,
told University News Service. "I
just cannot see that Saga can
come in and do a better job," he
said later.
In addition to the Coffee
House, Tresidder food services
include: the Main Course, Corner
Pocket, Baker Street, Patio Grill,
Encina Station and Tresidder
Catering. The current contracts
expire Aug. 31, and the new food
service contracts will be for five
years.
Six other contractors submitted
bids in the competitive process:
ARA, Canteen Corporation,
Coffee House, Inc., Crepes and
Crust, Service Systems/Manning
and Servomation. The Coffee
House, Inc., owned by the ASSU,
has operated the Coffee House
since 1980. Servomation was the
former contractor for the other
Tresidder food services.
The criteria used in the bidding
process included "the ability to
meet the needs of the University
community, meaningful student
involvement, prices, quality of
service, creativity, marketing and
training programs," according to
a Tresidder news release.
Saga has "proven experience"
and "strong marketing and train
ing plans," the release said. "A

special quality is Saga's commit
ment to working with current
Coffee House employees to per
petuate the existing high level of
student involvement and the
pleasant ambiance of the Coffee
House."
In addition, the dean of student
affairs will form a task force "in
the near future" to develop a
model to "preserve significant
student involvement in all levels
of the Coffee House operation,"
the release said.
Saga officials echoed a commit
ment to student involvement in
all levels of the food service
operations. "It is our intent that it
(the Coffee House) is still going
to be student-run," said Michael
Bauccio, southwest area vice
president for Saga. The students
will be involved "in a managerial
role as well as in peripheral
roles," he added. "We feel that is
what could be of benefit to stu
dents."
Jim Connelly, director of area
sales for Saga, said student in
volvement would also apply to all
of the food service operations,
and not just to the Coffee House.
Saga would probably involve stu
dents to a greater extent than
they are now, he said. "Our com
mitment is to hire as many stu
dents as possible."
Currently, owning the Coffee
House and managing the Corner
Pocket is the extent of student in
volvement.
Connelly and Bauccio said stu
dent managers from the Coffee
House have submitted three
models for student involvement,
and said Saga would meet with
students and Tresidder in the next
three to four weeks to forge an
agreement. "We hope to work
within one of those (student
submitted models)," Connelly
said.
But student involvement will
not be enough, according to Mark
Thornburgh, co-author of the
ASSU bid and manager of the
Coffee House during 1985-86. It
is "apparent that they just want
students in an advisory position,"
he said. "Students have to have a
significant role, otherwise it is just
doing Saga's dirty work."
Thornburgh maintains that
"Students have to have the final
say" in decisions made about the
Coffee House. It would be
"insane" to let Saga have final say
in decisions about prices, wages
and fundamental changes in the
Coffee House that will occur in
the next five years when it moves
