## Yearbooks arrive, but are defective 
### REBECCA ZEIGLER Staff writer 
Stanford graduates left campus
last week with diplomas and com
mencement tassels but without a
copy of The Stanford Quad year
book.
After the United Airlines strike
caused initial transportation
delays for the 1985 Quad, the
yearbooks arrived damaged two
weeks ago. The editors dis
covered a major defect in the
cover and spine binding of the
books. If they had distributed the
copies as they were, the bindings
would have deteriorated over
time, according to staff members.
The staff attributes the prob
lem with cracked bindings to the
thick, elaborate cover developed
to celebrate the 100-year an
niversary of The Quad.
"The mistake was in the die
used to imprint the cover," reads
a statement distributed by The
Quad staff. "Not only was it too
wide for the thickness of the year
book, but also the pressure of
stamping split the material.
"There is simply no way we can
allow this book to circulate â€” al
though a few of the books are all
right, most are not. People might
be tempted to take the book,
thinking the problem is not very
serious. But over time it would
become very apparent, and a
yearbook is not something one
wants to deteriorate."
The Quad faulted Hunter

Publishing Co. and returned the
entire shipment of defective year
books to its North Carolina
offices. Mary Williams, who
handles The Quad at Hunter
Publishing, refused to comment.
However, William Hunter, vice
president of the yearbook divi
sion at Hunter, passed the blame
to the cover manufacturer,
Kingsport Press, located in
Kingsport, Tenn.
"Hunter Publishing is not re
sponsible for these complica
tions," Hunter said, claiming that
the books have been ready for
three to four weeks anjd are now
in North Carolina waiting for the
covers from Tennessee. "As soon
as they (the covers) arrive, it will
take us just one day to process
and get them in the mail."
The books will be mailed from
Hunter directly to students.
Although The Quad staff ex
pects the renewed yearbooks to
be mailed out July 15, Hunter
Publishing has set a projected
ship date of July 1.
In order to ensure that they
receive yearbooks, The Quad has
requested notification from stu
dents with addresses other than
those home addresses on file with
the University. Students can
either mail new addresses to P.O.
Box 2324, call 497-3604 or slip
them under the door of The Quad
office in the Storke Publication
Building.
