# Zschau speaks in Palo Alto

### PHIL SANDERS 
PALO ALTO â€” Dissatisfaction with Congress
man Ed Zschau's recent vote in support of aid to
Nicaraguan Contras was the dominant emotion Sat
urday in his town meeting at the Palo Alto Senior
Center.
Over 150 local residents, some carrying placards
and passing out flyers, jammed into the senior cen
ter's dining room to tell the Sunnyvale Republican
how they feel about his recent voting record.
Noting that his vote on Contra aid represents a
reversal of Zschau's previous stance on rebel aid,
one unidentified Palo Alto resident called the con
gressman's vote "a most cowardly act."
Zschau responded by saying, "If the surrounding

governments can come to an agreement about how
they are going to conduct themselves both internally
and externally, then we should not only support this,
but respect it."
Another of Zschau's stands that came under at
tack was his vote against a bill publicly condemning
the slaughter of thousands of Armenians by the
Turkish Ottoman Empire.
Zschau also addressed the situation with the
hijacked TWA airliner in Beirut, Lebanon, and the
national deficit.
Zschau warned residents to be cautious when
traveling abroad to avoid terrorist attacks and kid
nappings. "An ounce of prevention is worth a ton of
cure," he said.
