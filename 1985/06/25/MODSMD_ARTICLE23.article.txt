## Davis coaches, Koberlein plays on Pac-10 team Stanford sports roundup 
### MARK ZEIGLER Editorial staff 
For Stanford Basketball Coach Tom Davis, for
ward Earl Koberlein and nine other Pacific 10 Con
ference players, summer vacation doesn't get much
better.
Davis and Koberlein help make up a Pac-10 all
star team that left yesterday for Australia, where it
will play seven exhibition games in the next two
weeks.
The 10-man team, which features one player
from each school in the conference, opens its
Australian tour Thursday night in Newcastle against
the Australian National team. The Pac-10 all-stars
will play the national team — the same one that
finished seventh in the 1984 Olympics — twice
more before taking on four teams from the
Australian National Basketball League at various
sites around the country.
The Pac-10 squad, billed in Australia as the West
Coast All-Stars, spent last week at Stanford living in
Stern Hall and practicing in Maples Pavilion and at
Menlo College in Atherton.
"I enjoy the travel," said Davis, who has taken
college all-star teams to Yugoslavia and Romania.
"It's fun coaching because the pressures aren't what
they are during the season. It also really helps the
visibility of the league."
Each Pac-10 school chose one player for the
team. Heading the roster are Arizona State's Steve
Beck, California's Leonard Taylor and Washington
State's Joe Wallace. Beck led the Sun Devils in
scoring, Taylor was the Pac-10 Freshman of the
Year and Wallace was second in the conference in
scoring.
Joining them will be Oregon State's Darryl
Flowers, Washington's Paul Fortier, USCs Larry
Friend, Arizona's Rolf Jacobs, UCLA's Jack Haley
and Oregon's Anthony Taylor. The assistant coach
is Bob Weinhauer from Arizona State.
"We didn't get the top players from a few schools,
but we could have done a lot worse," Davis said.
"These are all good athletes, and all of them are
pretty talented."

Only two of the 10 — Haley and Jacobs — saw
limited playing time, and seven had scoring averages
in double figures this season. Friend, a 5-foot-11
point guard, averaged just 4.6 points per game but
led the Pac-10 in assists per game with 6.1.
Davis said he will use roughly the same running
and pressing style he teaches at Stanford, although it
will be simpler. "You only have five days to
prepare," he said, "so you use a scaled-down ver
sion. But on the other side, you've got pretty good
talent, so you don't need as much organization."
Since the games will be played in Australia, they
will be played under international rules — a wider
key area, a 30-second shot clock, a three-point line
and referee-less inbounds passes.
The team flew to Sydney yesterday and then
bused to Newcastle, where it will play the
Australian National Team Thursday night. The same
two teams will meet again Friday night, but up the
coast in Brisbane. They will play a third and final
exhibition June 30 in Melbourne.
In the second week of the tour, the Pac-10 All-
Stars will play against four teams from the
Australian National Basketball League — the
Coburg Giants, the Geelong Cats, the Nunawading
Spectres and the Hobart Devils.
"1 don't know about the club teams," Davis said, m
"but I've heard they're playing pretty good basket
ball down there. They'll make up for their lack of
height and speed with experience."
The only drawback, if you can call it that, is that
the seasons in Australia are exactly opposite of the
United States, and as summer begins here, winter
begins there.
Koberlein, for one, isn't complaining. He was
chosen as Stanford's representative in a closed bal
lot by his teammates.
"I've never traveled before 1 got here (to col
lege)," said Koberlein, a junior who has been to
Japan, Hawaii and now Australia while playing bas
ketball at Stanford. "I love it. All the hard work is
finally paying off."

Netters at Wimbledon
Two members of Stanford's 1985 men's and
women's tennis teams will be spending this week on
the other side of the world, in England playing at
Wimbledon.
Dan Goldie, a senior who played No. 1 for Stan
ford last season, and junior Patty Fendick take the
court today at the All-England Lawn Tennis and
Croquet Club, where Wimbledon opened yesterday.
However, Linda Gates, who ended her career at
Stanford last month by winning the NCAA singles
and doubles championships, was not issued a wild
card berth at what many consider the world's most
prestigous tennis tournament.
Women's athletics No. 2
The Stanford women's athletic program was

ranked second nationally by the Knoxville (Tenn.)
Journal last week. UCLA was rated first with 95
points, followed by Stanford with 94 and Texas with
78.5. The Knoxville Journal ranked Stanford's
men's athletic program eighth.
The newspaper chose ten sports and awarded the
schools 20 points and on down according to their
post-season ranking. Finishing atop the men's poll
was Arkansas, followed by Texas and UCLA.
Card golfers win tourneys
Two Stanford golfers won amateur tournaments
over the weekend. Senior Don Walsworth won the
Missouri State Amateur Championship and junior
Kathleen McCarthy captured the Women's Western
Amateur.
Walsworth won the Missouri title 3-and-2 in the
36 hole match-play format. Fifteen years ago, the
winner of the tournament was a fellow named Tom
Watson, a Stanford graduate.
McCarthy had an easier time winning the West
ern Amateur, as she closed out her opponent in
match play with nine holes left.

talent, so you don't need as much organization."
Since the games will be played in Australia, they
will be played under international rules — a wider
key area, a 30-second shot clock, a three-point line
and referee-less inbounds passes.
The team flew to Sydney yesterday and then
bused to Newcastle, where it will play the
Australian National Team Thursday night. The same
two teams will meet again Friday night, but up the
coast in Brisbane. They will play a third and final
exhibition June 30 in Melbourne.
In the second week of the tour, the Pac-10 All-
Stars will play against four teams from the
Australian National Basketball League — the
Coburg Giants, the Geelong Cats, the Nunawading
Spectres and the Hobart Devils.
"1 don't know about the club teams," Davis said, m
"but I've heard they're playing pretty good basket
ball down there. They'll make up for their lack of
height and speed with experience."
The only drawback, if you can call it that, is that
the seasons in Australia are exactly opposite of the
United States, and as summer begins here, winter
begins there.
Koberlein, for one, isn't complaining. He was
chosen as Stanford's representative in a closed bal
lot by his teammates.
"I've never traveled before 1 got here (to col
lege)," said Koberlein, a junior who has been to
Japan, Hawaii and now Australia while playing bas
ketball at Stanford. "I love it. All the hard work is
finally paying off."

Netters at Wimbledon
Two members of Stanford's 1985 men's and
women's tennis teams will be spending this week on
the other side of the world, in England playing at
Wimbledon.
Dan Goldie, a senior who played No. 1 for Stan
ford last season, and junior Patty Fendick take the
court today at the All-England Lawn Tennis and
Croquet Club, where Wimbledon opened yesterday.
However, Linda Gates, who ended her career at
Stanford last month by winning the NCAA singles
and doubles championships, was not issued a wild
card berth at what many consider the world's most
prestigous tennis tournament.
Women's athletics No. 2
The Stanford women's athletic program was

ranked second nationally by the Knoxville (Tenn.)
Journal last week. UCLA was rated first with 95
points, followed by Stanford with 94 and Texas with
78.5. The Knoxville Journal ranked Stanford's
men's athletic program eighth.
The newspaper chose ten sports and awarded the
schools 20 points and on down according to their
post-season ranking. Finishing atop the men's poll
was Arkansas, followed by Texas and UCLA.
Card golfers win tourneys
Two Stanford golfers won amateur tournaments
over the weekend. Senior Don Walsworth won the
Missouri State Amateur Championship and junior
Kathleen McCarthy captured the Women's Western
Amateur.
Walsworth won the Missouri title 3-and-2 in the
36 hole match-play format. Fifteen years ago, the
winner of the tournament was a fellow named Tom
Watson, a Stanford graduate.
McCarthy had an easier time winning the West
ern Amateur, as she closed out her opponent in
match play with nine holes left.
For Stanford Basketball Coach Tom Davis, for
ward Earl Koberlein and nine other Pacific 10 Con
ference players, summer vacation doesn't get much
better.
Davis and Koberlein help make up a Pac-10 all
star team that left yesterday for Australia, where it
will play seven exhibition games in the next two
weeks.
The 10-man team, which features one player
from each school in the conference, opens its
Australian tour Thursday night in Newcastle against
the Australian National team. The Pac-10 all-stars
will play the national team — the same one that
finished seventh in the 1984 Olympics — twice
more before taking on four teams from the
Australian National Basketball League at various
sites around the country.
The Pac-10 squad, billed in Australia as the West
Coast All-Stars, spent last week at Stanford living in
Stern Hall and practicing in Maples Pavilion and at
Menlo College in Atherton.
"I enjoy the travel," said Davis, who has taken
college all-star teams to Yugoslavia and Romania.
"It's fun coaching because the pressures aren't what
they are during the season. It also really helps the
visibility of the league."
Each Pac-10 school chose one player for the
team. Heading the roster are Arizona State's Steve
Beck, California's Leonard Taylor and Washington
State's Joe Wallace. Beck led the Sun Devils in
scoring, Taylor was the Pac-10 Freshman of the
Year and Wallace was second in the conference in
scoring.
Joining them will be Oregon State's Darryl
Flowers, Washington's Paul Fortier, USCs Larry
Friend, Arizona's Rolf Jacobs, UCLA's Jack Haley
and Oregon's Anthony Taylor. The assistant coach
is Bob Weinhauer from Arizona State.
"We didn't get the top players from a few schools,
but we could have done a lot worse," Davis said.
"These are all good athletes, and all of them are
pretty talented."

Only two of the 10 — Haley and Jacobs — saw
limited playing time, and seven had scoring averages
in double figures this season. Friend, a 5-foot-11
point guard, averaged just 4.6 points per game but
led the Pac-10 in assists per game with 6.1.
Davis said he will use roughly the same running
and pressing style he teaches at Stanford, although it
will be simpler. "You only have five days to
prepare," he said, "so you use a scaled-down ver
sion. But on the other side, you've got pretty good
talent, so you don't need as much organization."
Since the games will be played in Australia, they
will be played under international rules — a wider
key area, a 30-second shot clock, a three-point line
and referee-less inbounds passes.
The team flew to Sydney yesterday and then
bused to Newcastle, where it will play the
