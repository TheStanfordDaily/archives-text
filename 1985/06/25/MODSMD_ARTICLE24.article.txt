## Still ill: The Smiths play Oakland 
### PHILIP CHEN 
Attending "progressive rock" concerts
provides a great opportunity to leave the
relative sobriety of Stanford, and observe
the trendy younger segments of the popu
lation, complete with the fashionable
Thrift-Mart attire and the I-did-my-hair
just-for-the-concert look of the American
Suburban Punk (Daddy bought me the
Scirocco). Friday's concert by the En
glish group The Smiths was no exception.
The Smiths are one of the new, erudite
bands that deal quite intelligently with the
angst and misery of modern youth. James
Morrissey, known professionally as Mor
rissey, is the lyricist, singer and focal point
of the band. Though an avowed celibate,
he often sings about the ambiguities and
unhappiness of love, sometimes with an
unabashed homoerotic twist.
The evening's entertainment began in a
bizarre manner. The opening act was a

Tina Turner look-alike who danced while
mouthing the words to a Tina Turner tape
and dodging the objects thrown at her.
Then an obese Madonna imitator waltzed
on stage to the opening chords of "Like A
Virgin," but the unappreciative crowd
forced her to curtail her act. I wondered if
Bill Graham had lost his mind, or if The
Smiths were so egotistical they would not
allow a real band to open for them.
The Smiths' entrance was stunningly ef
fective. The lights went down, and the
crowd cheered in anticipation, only to be
held in suspense, in the dark, for several
endless minutes. A blinding bank of flood
lights suddenly lit up, and an accompany
ing tape of suitably powerful classical
music thundered. All four Smiths then
swept onstage and plunged into excellent,
energetic renditions of "William, It Was
Really Nothing," "Nowhere Fast," and"I
Want the One I Cant Have."

Morrissey flailed his arms, shook his
booty, and sang his heart out, gyrating
wildly all the while, the audience shower
ing him with flowers.
Unfortunately, this was the concert's
high point. The musicians were not to
blame — Mike Joyce on drums and Andy
Rourke on bass formed a proficient and
adaptable rhythm unit, playing everything
from rockabilly to funk with equal aplomb;
Johnny Marr acted the perfect guitar hero,
shy and introverted, playing excellently but
hardly showing off (no metal licks tonight),
and rarely even looking up.
However, the center of the band is Mor
rissey. His vigorous motions early in the
concert must have exhausted him, because
his singing soon lost that element which
makes a concert experience more than
merely a somewhat inaccurate replay of
the artists' recorded works. He complained
about the heat in his between-song banter,

and spent what remained of his energy
wiping the sweat from his brow. The lights
also seemed to bother him; he squinted,
and shielded his eyes with his hands and
shirt. His microphone seemed prone to
howling feedback. Still, one would think he
had encountered these problems before,
and had learned to cope with them.
The band lost the momentum built up
previously, and spent more and more time
fiddling about after each song; Morrissey
became increasingly and visibly ill
humored and petulant. He would fre
quently begin a song with a rousing kick
and an urgency in his voice, but before long
he would again be hot and irritated. His
singing remained strong and full, better
than that of some of The Smiths' record
ings, but his words lacked emotion. An ex
ception was the last song of their short (one
hour) first set, "Meat Is Murder," Morris
sey's condemnation of our carnivorous
habits and the title track to their latest
record. A screen behind the band shot
blood red and the drone of buzz saws
sounded, as Morrissey spread his arms
wide in an appeal for vegetarianism.
The first encore regained some of the old
zip, with rocking versions of
"Shakespeare's Sister," "Heaven Knows
I'm Miserable Now," and "This Charming
Man." The second encore was not as good,
and featured Morrissey's tuneless falsetto
in a terrible song, "Miserable Lie."
The concert ended as uniquely as it
started. Everyone was making for the exits,
when unexpectedly the hall lights went
dark, and the stage lights turned on. Our
four capricious lads returned to the cheers
of all, and proceeded to play an ultra
extended dance mix of "Barbarism Begins
At Home" (perhaps they considered us
barbarians and decided to lecture us).
Unpredictability is good in concerts, but
The Smiths, and Morrissey in particular,
displayed a childish, unprofessional atti
tude that I disliked. Of course, most of the
crowd couldn't care less — they happily
bopped to the beat, eyeing each other flir
tatiously, utterly unaware of what Morris
sey was singing. Oh, to be young and un
critical again.


The Smiths — Morrissey, Johnny Marr, Andy Rourke and Mike
Joyce — had an attitude that was less than professional in their

concert Friday at the Henry J. Kaiser Convention Center in Oak
land.
