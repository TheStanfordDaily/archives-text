## No breathers in Music Hall's revue 
### ELAINE WANG 
If the summer gets sluggish, try
some fast action at Music Hall's
"Dance Between the Lines," a
musical revue about jazz dancing,
dancers and putting on a show.
It's a high-paced, acrobatically
inclined performance of short vig
nettes about what show-dancers
do to continue dancing, e.g.,
waiting on tables, taking recep
tionist jobs. In fact, the Music
Hall was begun four years ago by
Ann Marie Garvin, who gathered
a group of dancers who weren't
altogether the "correct" shape,
size or look for bigger produc
tions, and gave them a place to
dance. But with a home to dance
in comes certain responsibilities.
As Stage Manager Doug Jack
tells the audience, each member
of the troupe does service jobs
before the show — tending the
bar, selling at the small boutique,
clearing plates (there is dinner
before the show), and serving
food and drinks. Minutes before
the show, the tables are cleared,
the lights dim, the three-piece
band strikes a rolling intro, and
the person who had wished you a
pleasant dinner is suddenly in

flourescent yellow tights onstage,
moving with incredible verve.
The energy is difficult to resist,
and each scene is varied and
colorful. "Jazzin' At The Office"
features human-size pencils,

rulers and crayons being tossed
and caught, and in "A Salute to
Sports Medicine" crutches are
used to swing on and off of.
There are especially fine per
formances from Evelyn Sajuela
(in all numbers) and from Jane
Chavez (in a breathtaking solo
tap sequence from "Coney Is
land"). The ensembles are often

uneven; we're always aware that
these are individual dancers with
their own styles — some more
enthused than others.
By far the most unusual bit in
"Dance Between the Lines," is in
the part entitled "Superstitions"
and subtitled "Bats." Here, the
voice-over tells us that dancers
are an intensely superstitious lot
and that rituals are crucial; the
stage is suffused with an eerie
blacklight and "bats" in black
costumes with white tracings
begin to prowl about the stage,
swinging on a bar lowered from
the ceiling.
The effect is surreal, and the
music slows down. "Bats" is dis
tinct from the rest of the vig
nettes, which tend to be brimming
over with wholesome fun, enthus
iasm and a touch of cuteness. All
the same, the company does not
know how to hold the moment.
After the exquisite pas de deux
with Melanie Lehwalder (on toe)
in "Bats," the stage is immedi
ately overrun with the rest of the
bats, and the music speeds up.
There are no breathers in this
show — not for the dancers, not

for the audience; it almost seems
as if vitality were synonymous
only with speed.
Nevertheless, at the end of the
evening we have laughed and
ahh-ed our way through two
hours. "Dance Between the
Lines" is the fruit of a wonderful
idea; it is not slick nor particularly
insightful (though there is an apt
satire on the San Francisco

Chronicle's "Little Man Critic" in
the pink section). But it's a rol
licking tribute to the fun of dan
cing, and you'll leave the theater
in a festive mood.
"Dance Between the Lines"
plays at the Music Hall Theater at
931 Larkin, San Francisco, Wed
nesday through Sunday. Perfor
mances are at 8 p.m. and dinner
starts at 6 p.m.
