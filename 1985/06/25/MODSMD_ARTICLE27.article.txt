## NCAA stiffens sanctions 
### TOM SENF Senior staff writer 
The University of San Francisco received
nationwide attention in 1981 when, following
numerous violations of NCAA rules, the school
decided to suspend its highly successful men's
basketball program. The Dons plan to reinstate
the program for the 1985-86 season.
However, after the special convention held by
the NCAA last week, schools that violate the
rules as seriously and as often as USF did will not
be suspending their programs voluntarily. They
will be forced to do so.
At a New Orleans meeting attended by repre
sentatives of 435 schools, including all 284 in Di
vision I, the NCAA approved what are easily the
harshest measures ever enacted to punish viola
tions of recruiting and.academic standards.
Because Athletic Director Andy Geiger, who
was Stanford's representative at the convention,
was unavailable for comment, there has been no
official response from the Athletic Department.
However, Recruiting Coordinator Dick James
had a few remarks.
"I personally think it's long overdue," James
said. "The people responsible for college ath
letics took it upon themselves."
A school convicted of one major infraction in a
five-year period will receive a minimum of two
years probation and a one-year exclusion from
television and postseason action.
If the school breaks the rules twice within five
years, the sport in which the violations occur will
be suspended for up to two years. Also, the
school will not be allowed to recruit athletes in
that sport during the suspension.
In addition to suspending programs, the new
penalties also include sanctions against guilty
coaches and players. Coaches caught breaking

the rules will be subject to suspension or firing,
and players who accept cash, cars or other illegal
benefits will be penalized through the loss of
eligibility.
The convention ruled that all Division I schools
report annually to the NCAA to show that enter
ing freshman athletes are academically qualified
for admission. Schools also must submit the
graduation rate of its senior athletes.
USC and Memphis State were primary targets
of the academic rulings. In the last 10 years, USC
has admitted over 300 athletes that did not meet
the school's minimum standards. The recent
graduation rate of Memphis State basketball
players is less than 10 percent.
An especially tough aspect of the repeat
offender rules is that they are retroactive. In
other words, if Florida has a repeat performance
of its 1984 incident — in which the football pro
gram was cited for over 100 infractions — before
1989, look for attendance at Gator water polo
matches to increase dramatically.
"Of all the things they did, that was the most
courageous one," James said. "Schools that have
had their hands slapped are really on that fine
line now. If they screw up again, they're in a heap
of hurt."
"I do not believe I can overstate the level of
concern that presidents and chancellors feel re
garding the integrity crisis in college athletics,"
Dr. John Ryan, president of Indiana Univer
sity and chairman of the commission, was quoted
as saying.
"People are going to become much more
accountable," James said. "Presidents are stick
ing their necks out. If you lose a football season,
that's big dollars. It will have long-term effects on
the university. The rules have a lot of teeth in
them."
