# Cuomo speaks at graduation in stadium
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
A record 30,000 spectators
endured sizzling morning temper
atures to watch Stanford's 94th
annual commencement exercises
June 16, when 4,275 graduates
added the coveted title of
"alumni" to their dockets of un
dergraduate, graduate, doctoral
and professional degrees.
The ceremony marked a return
of commencement to Stanford
Stadium after a 50-year hiatus.
The crowd, nearly twice as large
as last year's at Sunken Diamond,
listened to the presentation of
various University awards and
addresses by University President
Donald Kennedy and New York
Governor Mario Cuomo, the
featured commencement speaker.
The ceremony started precisely
at 9:30 a.m. when the graduates,
many toting cameras and sporting
shorts and beach thongs in addi
tion to the traditional black robes,
entered the stadium to the strains
of music played by a University
band.
Also notable were hundreds of

black balloons and a huge black
and yellow "Divest Now" sign,
graphic evidence of an com
mencement awareness campaign
orchestrated by Stanford Out of
South Africa (SOSA).
The half-hour procession pro
vided ample time for the
graduates to amuse themselves,
from uncorking champagne
bottles to mugging for a bevy of
photographers. Two undergradu
ates merrily tossed a football on
the track while their classmates
filed in, and many close to the
processional path bowed to Ken
nedy and Cuomo in classic Stan
ford student fashion.
In the invocation, former Dean
of the Chapel B. Davie Napier
called the graduates a "mixed
bag" that was "motivated only
You know how and headed only
You know where," drawing ap
preciative applause from the
graduates and onlookers.
Kennedy then welcomed the
audience to the ceremony and
thanked Greg Lynch and his crew
who designed the special stage

and facilities especially for this
year's event.
Kennedy invited all of the
graduates to salute their parents
and those in the stands "who
made this day possible." The
graduates quickly turned and
faced the crowd, giving them a
thunderous ovation. "We appre
ciate their faith in you," Kennedy
said, "and I appreciate their faith
in us."
In his introduction of Cuomo,
Kennedy praised New York's
governor for advocating "the
radical view that we can right
wrongs and engage in sound fiscal
practice at the same time."
During his introduction, a
champagne cork whizzed by,
prompting a nonchalant "wide
right" response from Kennedy
and laughter from the crowd.
In his address, Cuomo contin
ued the jovial tone. "How do you
manage to get so festive so early
in the morning?" he asked the
graduates. "Let me just close up
some things before we get into

the speech. If you want to shoot
those things, take your best shot
now, and then we'll get on with
the speech."
After the crowd roared its ap
proval, Cuomo added, "In New
York, they can make it to the
stage."
In a departure from his
prepared text distributed to the
media before the speech, Cuomo
then added his support to the di
vestment protest. "I'm not going
to be talking about this in the
speech," Cuomo said, "but if I
had a black balloon, I'd be
delighted to hold it up here right
now."
A student immediately brought
a balloon to him, which he tied to
the podium.
Returning to his prepared text,
Cuomo told the graduates about
the fascinating image of Stanford
and California instilled in New
York natives by Hollywood and
the movie industry. "We im
agined people in California had
wheels instead of legs," Cuomo
said. "Everybody owned a car
and left it only to play tennis."
The California "dream"

brought transplanted New
Yorkers who "flourished" and
"enriched" the state, Cuomo
said. "They all worked hard," he
continued. "Most of them
succeeded, some grew wealthy
and even famous, and a few
became so affluent and com
fortable (that) they registered as
Republicans."
Cuomo listed some of New
York's contributions to Califor
nia, such as the movie industry
and Leland Stanford, and men
tioned some of California's gifts
back — hot tubs and the pina
colada.
"Above all, from both ends of
this land, we have shared one
thing," Cuomo added. "We've
shared the dream called
America."
Cuomo cautioned the
graduates to balance the ambition
and"the demand for excellence
which has been nurtured and
refined by your education at
Stanford" with the question, "Is
this where the dream ends?"
"It can end, if you wish, at your
own doorstep if you choose,"
Cuomo said. "But I suggest to
you that there is another choice,
one that the history and tradition
of this great university you now
leave teaches very clearly."

The ceremony started precisely
at 9:30 a.m. when the graduates,
many toting cameras and sporting
shorts and beach thongs in addi
tion to the traditional black robes,
entered the stadium to the strains
of music played by a University
band.
Also notable were hundreds of

black balloons and a huge black
and yellow "Divest Now" sign,
graphic evidence of an com
mencement awareness campaign
orchestrated by Stanford Out of
South Africa (SOSA).
The half-hour procession pro
vided ample time for the
graduates to amuse themselves,
from uncorking champagne
bottles to mugging for a bevy of
photographers. Two undergradu
ates merrily tossed a football on
the track while their classmates
filed in, and many close to the
processional path bowed to Ken
nedy and Cuomo in classic Stan
ford student fashion.
In the invocation, former Dean
of the Chapel B. Davie Napier
called the graduates a "mixed
bag" that was "motivated only
You know how and headed only
You know where," drawing ap
preciative applause from the
graduates and onlookers.
Kennedy then welcomed the
audience to the ceremony and
thanked Greg Lynch and his crew
who designed the special stage

and facilities especially for this
year's event.
Kennedy invited all of the
graduates to salute their parents
and those in the stands "who
made this day possible." The
graduates quickly turned and
faced the crowd, giving them a
thunderous ovation. "We appre
ciate their faith in you," Kennedy
said, "and I appreciate their faith
in us."
In his introduction of Cuomo,
Kennedy praised New York's
governor for advocating "the
radical view that we can right
wrongs and engage in sound fiscal
practice at the same time."
During his introduction, a
champagne cork whizzed by,
prompting a nonchalant "wide
right" response from Kennedy
and laughter from the crowd.
In his address, Cuomo contin
ued the jovial tone. "How do you
manage to get so festive so early
in the morning?" he asked the
graduates. "Let me just close up
some things before we get into

the speech. If you want to shoot
those things, take your best shot
now, and then we'll get on with
the speech."
After the crowd roared its ap
proval, Cuomo added, "In New
York, they can make it to the
stage."
In a departure from his
prepared text distributed to the
media before the speech, Cuomo
then added his support to the di
vestment protest. "I'm not going
to be talking about this in the
speech," Cuomo said, "but if I
had a black balloon, I'd be
delighted to hold it up here right
now."
A student immediately brought
a balloon to him, which he tied to
the podium.
Returning to his prepared text,
Cuomo told the graduates about
the fascinating image of Stanford
and California instilled in New
York natives by Hollywood and
the movie industry. "We im
agined people in California had
wheels instead of legs," Cuomo
said. "Everybody owned a car
and left it only to play tennis."
The California "dream"

brought transplanted New
Yorkers who "flourished" and
"enriched" the state, Cuomo
said. "They all worked hard," he
continued. "Most of them
succeeded, some grew wealthy
and even famous, and a few
became so affluent and com
fortable (that) they registered as
Republicans."
Cuomo listed some of New
York's contributions to Califor
nia, such as the movie industry
and Leland Stanford, and men
tioned some of California's gifts
back — hot tubs and the pina
colada.
"Above all, from both ends of
this land, we have shared one
thing," Cuomo added. "We've
shared the dream called
America."
Cuomo cautioned the
graduates to balance the ambition
and"the demand for excellence
which has been nurtured and
refined by your education at
Stanford" with the question, "Is
this where the dream ends?"
"It can end, if you wish, at your
own doorstep if you choose,"
Cuomo said. "But I suggest to
you that there is another choice,
one that the history and tradition
of this great university you now
leave teaches very clearly."
