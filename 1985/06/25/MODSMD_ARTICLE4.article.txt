## Shuttle flight meets NASA goals 
### 
EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE â€” Discovery's
international space crew returned yesterday from a
"fantastic flight" that NASA said accomplished all
its goals, including the launch of a record three
satellites.
Officials initially feared there might have been
brake damage similar to previous landings because
Discovery's wheels sank about six inches into the
desert air strip. But an inspection showed there was
no brake damage, said Fritz Widck, NASA ground
operations manager.
NASA said the 100-ton shuttle had merely
pressed the wheels into a soft, moist spot on the
sandy runway. "There were a lot of wet spots out
there," said shuttle director Jesse Moore.
The crew of five Americans, a French test pilot
and a Saudi Arabian prince had spent seven days
circling the earth 111 times on their 2.9-million
mile journey.
They launched three communications satellites,
deployed and retrieved a scientific platform to make
an X-ray map of the Milky Way, and their ship
served as the bull's-eye for a laser in the first "Star
Wars" space shuttle test.
On earlier missions, several satellites failed to
reach their assigned orbits.

"The crew seemed to be in good shape as they left
the orbiter," Moore said. "They had a fantastic
flight that began with an on-time launch a week ago
and everything went outstanding with this flight."
Two loud sonic booms cracked the air as Dis
covery, glistening in the morning sun, descended
into Edwards.
The shuttle filled the air with dust as it touched
down on the desert runway after what Moore called
"one of the most successful missions of the shuttle
program."
But after the 100-ton craft rolled 8,100 feet to a
stop, the tires in the main landing gear had gouged
out a trench in the sand six inches deep, indicating a
repetition of the brake lockup problems that have
plagued the shuttle program.
Moore said that if the shuttle had landed on the
concrete at Kennedy Space Center in Florida and
the brakes had locked, one or more of the tires
might have blown. That happened at Kennedy on
April 17 when the brakes locked and shuttle lan
dings were diverted to California, where the wide
open desert allows more room for error, until the
brake problem is licked.
But Moore said the cause might have been a soft
area in the sand.
