SAN FRANCISCO â€” A rep
resentative of the People's
Republic of China launched the
40th anniversary celebrations for
the United Nations yesterday,
calling the United Nations "the
most important international or
ganization today."
Ling Qing, a permanent repre
sentative to the United Nations
and a member of the five-person
UN Security Council, said the
value of the organization hasn't
diminished since leaders from 50
nations met in San Francisco at
the end of World War 11, devel
oping a pact they hoped would
insure peace.
Referring to the United Na
tions' "tortuous course" in the
past four decades, Qing was still
optimistic about its potential to
help resolve international con

flicts and promote development.
He declined specific recommen
dations for changing the UN.
Responding to questions, U.S.
representative Vernon Walters,
who replaced Jeanne Kirkpatrick
about a month ago, told reporters
the United Nations has a
"definite role" to play in resolv
ing hostage crises.
. .For terrorists, it's easier to
yield to the persuasion of the sec
retary general of the United Na
tions than it is to the threats (of
the nations involved)," he said.
The anniversary program in
cludes debates about the future of
the United Nations, with discus
sions on the organization's role in
arms control, international
peacekeeping, Third World de
velopment, refugee problems and
international finance.
