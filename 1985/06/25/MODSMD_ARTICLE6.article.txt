Amal calls for warship withdrawal
BEIRUT, Lebanon — The Shiite Moslem leader who has
taken responsibility for 40 American hijack hostages added an
other condition yesterday for their release: withdrawal of U.S.
warships that have taken up positions off Lebanon.
Nabih Bern, chief of the Shiite militia Amal and Lebanon's
justice minister, also dismissed as a "political zigzag" Israel's
release of 26 Shiites and five Sunni Moslems who had been
captured in south Lebanon and held prisoner.
Berri and the hijackers demand the release of all 766 Lebanese
prisoners held by the Israelis, more than 500 of whom are said to
be Shiites, in exchange for the Americans held captive since the
hijacking of a TWA jetliner June 14.
At the airport yesterday, gunmen aboard the TWA aircraft
summoned a doctor to attend to one of the American crewmen,
but would not say which one. They said he" suffered stomach
pains.
Amal claimed that the 6th Fleet ships led by the aircraft carrier
USS Nimitz, 25 miles off the Lebanese coast, are prepared for a
"military operation." The Defense Department denied Lebanese
reports that F-14 fighters from the carrier flew over Beirut on
Saturday.
The chief of Amal's politburo, Akef Haidar, said that Amal
has not set a deadline for the release of the Lebanese held in Is
rael, but if Washington does not pressure Israel to free the men
soon, "we won't be mediators any more."
Berri said U.S. Ambassador Reginald Bartholomew
telephoned him to repeat Washington's position that it would not
publicly pressure Israel into freeing the prisoners.
Israel has said that its release of the 31 Lebanese prisoners is
not related to the hostage situation.
Bomb suspected in Air-India crash
CORK, Ireland — Suspicions grew yesterday that a bomb
planted by terrorists caused an Air-India jumbo jet with 329
people aboard to crash into the North Atlantic off the Irish coast.
Many international airports increased security after the crash.
An Air-India Boeing 747 about to leave London's Heathrow
Airport for New York on Monday was evacuated and towed to a
remote spot after the airport received an anonymous bomb
threat.
Police searched the plane for more than six hours, but found
no explosives and the flight took off 7 hours and 15 minutes late.
The Internationa! Air Transport Association, based in
Montreal, said airline security experts would meet there Friday
to review all aspects of airline security.
Sean Brady, spokesman for the Canadian Foreign Office in
Ottawa, said investigators were looking for possible links be
tween the Air-India crash and an explosion about an hour earlier
Sunday in a baggage container that had been take,n off a
Canadian Pacific airliner in Tokyo.
Ever since the Air-India plane vanished from Irish radar
screens en route from Montreal to London, experts have said the
apparent suddenness of the crash and the absence of a distress
signal point to an explosion aboard.
Three pieces of baggage were removed from the flight at
Montreal after dogs trained to sniff explosives began barking.
The luggage was found to be harmless, but the suspicion remains
that a bomb got through in a different bag.
One hundred thirty-one bodies have been recovered from
the crash site so far, and the search continues. A separate search
has failed to locate the "black box" in-flight recorder of cockpit
conversations and flight information, which could provide clues.
It is thought to be about 5,400 feet under water.
Organizations of India's Sikh minority have denied involve
ment in the Air-India crash.
The Toronto Globe and Mail said Indian officials suspected
the Air-India crash and the Canadian Pacific bomb were the
work of two Sikh fugitives wanted by the FBI in connection with
an alleged plot to kill Rajiv Gandhi, India's prime minister, when
he visited the United States earlier this month.
Bomb threat grounds Austrian jet
ROME — An Austrian jetliner was forced to return to a Rome
airport because of a bomb threat, but no explosives were found
after a two-hour search, police said late yesterday.
Airport officials said the Austrian Airlines DC-9, carrying 65
people, would be allowed to leave later for Vienna.
Flight 276, from Rome to Vienna, had taken off at 8:45 p.m.
from Leonardo da Vinci Airport. Less than a half-hour later, it
was forced to turn around after the airline's office in Vienna
received a bomb threat, said a police spokesman who declined to
be identified.
After the jet returned to Rome at 9:15 p.m., security forces
surrounded the jet, which was parked at an isolated spot far from
the main terminal building.
Police bomb squads with sophisticated explosive detectors
searched the baggage while the 60 passengers and five crew
members were escorted to a transit lounge, Peter leer of the
Austrian Airlines office at the airport told The Associated Press.
leer declined to give any details of the threat.
Police said no explosives were found.
Police quoted airlines officials as saying the bomb threat was
telephoned by a man who spoke English with a heavy foreign ac
cent.

The luggage was found to be harmless, but the suspicion remains
that a bomb got through in a different bag.
One hundred thirty-one bodies have been recovered from
the crash site so far, and the search continues. A separate search
has failed to locate the "black box" in-flight recorder of cockpit
conversations and flight information, which could provide clues.

the Air-India crash and the Canadian Pacific bomb were the
work of two Sikh fugitives wanted by the FBI in connection with
an alleged plot to kill Rajiv Gandhi, India's prime minister, when
he visited the United States earlier this month.
