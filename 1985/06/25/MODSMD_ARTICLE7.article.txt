Court upholds orders
to gag spy case lawyers
SAN FRANCISCO â€” A federal appeals court
yesterday upheld most of the gag order on
lawyers in the Richard Miller FBI spy case in Los
Angeles, saying restrictions on public statements
would protect "the integrity of the judicial
process."
By a 2-1 vote, a panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals said U.S. District Judge David
Kenyon was right to forbid most public com
ments by lawyers for each side in the upcoming
trial, though the court narrowed Kenyon's order.
The court said Kenyon's ban on statements by
lawyers on "any aspect of this case that bears

upon the merits" was too broad. Only comments
that "pose an immediate and serious threat to the
administration of justice" should be banned, the
court said. It added that statements about the
strengths and weaknesses of the other side's case
could be prohibited.
Joan Howarth, one of the American Civil
Liberties Union lawyers who represented Miller's
two attorneys in challenging the gag order, said
they would ask the full appeals court to overturn
the panel's ruling.
Miller, 48, the first FBI agent ever indicted on
such charges, is accused of conspiring with Rus
sian emigres Svetlana Ogorodnikov, 35, and her
husband, Nikolay, 52, to pass classified docu
ments to the Soviet Union.
