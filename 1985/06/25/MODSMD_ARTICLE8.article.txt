Right to die ruling delayed
MENLO PARK — A judge yesterday
demanded more medical and financial reports
before ruling who should be the legal guardian of
a, brain-injured woman whose husband seeks
court approval to let her die.
Those reports are due in San Mateo County
Superior Court Aug. 20.
Harold Pritchard says he wants authority to
have a doctor pull his 43-year-old wife's feeding
tube and conclude three futile years of round
the-clock nursing home care following a 1982 car
crash that left her permanently unconscious and
partially paralyzed.
But court-appointed attorney and retired
judge Melvin Cohn has asked the court to block
the "terminator" request that would claim the
life of Elaine Pritchard, whom he described as
"basically in good health." He wants someone
other than her husband to be her conservator.
According to Cohn, Pritchard's nurses at the
Hillhaven Convalescent Hospital report that she
smiles, cries, responds to visitors and turns
toward the window if staff tells her it's a sunny
day. Her husband says he's seen her cry, but
never smile.
In addition to updated medical reports on her,
the court has asked retired bank manager
Florence Krebbs to examine her financial situa
tion, Cohn said.
At issue is what constitutes "life support," and
whether a feeding tube qualifies.

State fouled cheese checks
LOS ANGELES — State records indicate that
inspectors failed for 2 years to properly check
cheese processing plants in Los Angeles County,
including Jalisco Mexican Products Inc., a news
paper reported yesterday.
Federal and state investigators are checking
whether raw milk was properly pasteurized at
Jalisco in Artesia, which produced cheese tainted
with listeria monocytogenes bacteria. An out
break of listeriosis has claimed 44 lives
nationwide since mid-March.
The state Department of Food and
Agriculture's Milk and Dairy Foods Control
Branch is responsible for checking pasteurizing
units at all cheese processing plants at least four
times a year, and for three sanitation inspections
yearly.
But records obtained by the Herald Examiner
showed that of six or seven cheese plants in Los
Angeles County, only one received the required
four pasteurization checks in 1983 and 1984.
At one plant, no pasteurization report was filed
to document that an inspection ever occurred in
1984 or 1985, the paper said.
The records show that only nine of 24 required
inspections were conducted at six operating
cheese plants in 1983, and last year only nine of
28 inspections were conducted at seven operating
cheese plants. Jalisco received only three inspec
tions in 1983 and 1984, the paper said.
