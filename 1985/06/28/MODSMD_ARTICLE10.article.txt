## THE
						STANFORD DAILY Saga of the ASSU 
### 
A curious thing happened at Tuesday's ASSU Senate
meeting â€” The Daily was kicked out.
This has happened before, but under more justifiable cir
cumstances. When it occurred last fall and this spring, it
was said that the ASSU could not be a competitive bidder
against other companies this spring if too many details in
the Coffee House's financial picture were disclosed.
Tuesday night, however, there was no excuse.
First, there is no plausible scenario in which the ASSU
will be submitting a bid to operate the Coffee House less
than five years from now.
In addition, in the short term, the ASSU will either be
out of the coffee house business or will be dealing with
Tresidder Union and Saga Corp. to try to retain some sort
of control over the Coffee House. In either scenario,
secrecy would not be necessary to ensure the financial suc
cess of the ASSU.
In short, the closing of Tuesday's meeting was no more
than an exercise in power for the senate chair, who closed
the meeting. At this point in time, there is no longer a com
pelling reason for the finances of the Coffee House to be
hidden from the students who subsidize it.
