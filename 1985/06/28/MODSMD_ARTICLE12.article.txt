## The 						rise and fall of common sense 
### 
Common sense n. 1. sound prudent judg
ment 2. the unreflective opinions of ordi
nary men
It is reputed that common sense, in both
senses of the word, once played a role in
the creation of our society, in bygone days

VIEWPOINT

when democracy was a daring new idea,
the West was expanding, and people were
inventing things such as wood-burning
stoves and bifocals. Our forefathers con
sidered common sense to be much like wis
dom — the product of experience acting on
a keen mind — and held it to be more gen
erally useful and reliable than the more
suspect "book learning."
With the passage of time, however, our
society became larger and more complex,
and our technology subtler and more
arcane. The areas of life in which common
sense alone could be relied upon as a guide
began to narrow — and in order to retain a
degree of control over their lives, people
were forced to specialize.
In our own time, it would appear that
common sense has seen its day. The issues
which confront us today are extremely
complex — far too complex for the
"unreflective opinions of ordinary men" to

be a reliable guide in making decisions.
Even "sound prudent judgment" has
become relatively useless without a consid
erable amount of information and spe
cialized knowledge to back it up. Ap
parently, common sense has become anti
quated and obsolete in our society. Often,
however, the things we read in the paper or
see on the news point out that common
sense is not obsolete and that we have per
haps done ourselves a great disservice in
abandoning it. Our hyperspecialization and
giddy infatuation with facts and experts has
brought us to an unprecedented level of
absurdity, and has made it all but
impossible for us to do anything about it.
Generally, it seems that the degree of
absurdity in the actions of the parts of our
society is roughly proportional to the size
of the organization acting. Hence, the most
glaring absurdities and gross deficiencies of
common sense seem to occur mainly in
business and government.
When the Air Force pays $7,000 of the
taxpayers' money for a coffee-maker on a
C-5, or when the government maintains a
stockpile of 10,000 nuclear weapons
and insists in all seriousness that our secur
ity will be threatened unless we build more,
or when the untreated emissions from
American factories sterilize lakes in

Canada, the reaction of many people is
simple disbelief. The disbelief these people
feel, for the most part, comes from the
feeling that intelligent people should know
better.
This rather vague idea of knowing better
— of common sense — plays no part, un
fortunately, in the making of decisions in
either government or business. (Whether
they play a part in the making of decisions
anywhere is sometimes doubtful.) Our
statesmen and captains of industry, true to
their times, are convinced that the
"unreflective opinions of ordinary men"
are grossly inadequate compared to the re
flective opinions of a panel of experts.
Even "sound prudent judgment" begins
to pale next to the mountains of facts and
statistics compiled by recognized authori
ties. And so they believe the statistics and
facts which allow them to tell the public
that the coffee maker on a C-5 is very spe
cial and well worth the money, that our
best hope for survival is to vastly increase
our ability to annihilate ourselves and that
there is nothing to indicate that rain which
is acidic enough to eat away limestone will
have any significant effect on the environ
ment.
Perhaps the most unfortunate result of
the death of common sense is not the

monumental absurdities foisted off as truth,
but the growing inability of the public to do
anything about the absurdities they per
ceive. Our contempt of the unreflective
opinion of ordinary men has grown so
great that one almost needs a degree in a
subject in order to be considered able to
make an intelligent decision regarding it.
This is not necessarily an attempt to sup
port unreflective or rash opinions, but it
becomes difficult to call ourselves a
democracy when the public is not consid
ered qualified to make decisions other than
the most trivial ones.
We are entering the age of the aris
tocracy of expertise. The aristocrats, those
who are informed, are becoming increas
ingly convinced that the public — if
equipped only with common sense — is not
qualified to make decisions regarding the
way in which the country is run. Even a
complaint that government or business is
not acting in the interest of the public
would become meaningless, as the unin
formed public, in the opinions of govern
ment and business, would not have access
to enough information to determine what
their interests really are.
