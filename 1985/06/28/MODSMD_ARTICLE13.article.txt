## Kennedy classified 'colored' 
### 
On Friday, May 17, the President's Office held a
ceremony to dedicate the 'New Quad.' Members of
Stanford Out of South Africa (SOSA) at the Man
dela Free University decided to stop by and lobby
for divestment.
Among the guests at the event was a couple visit
ing from South Africa. In that officially racist
country these people are classified as colored. In
South Africa, white is first class.

VIEWPOINT

In the course of our conversation, the visitors
from South Africa wanted to know if President
Kennedy was around. They had just read his state
ment on divestment. Kennedy was at that time quite
conspicuous. He was dancing with one of our mem
bers who was wearing a 'Divest Now' sign on her
back. I promptly pointed him out.
Our visitors stared at Kennedy with vivid dis
belief. I was perplexed. Then a most curious
dialogue ensued. Turning to me, the man said, "I
don't believe it — I thought he was white!"
Startled by that remark, I responded: "Of course
he is!"
Then the couple looked at each other and, nod
ding their heads in unison, said, "In South Africa he
would certainly be classified as colored."
That is how apartheid operates. People are classi
fied, re-classified, de-classified and cross-classified.
Not infrequently a family is spread right across the
categories. These are only a few of the quirks of

apartheid. Under the system, a small white minority
has arrogated to itself the right to dominate the
majority of the people with systematic repression.
That is why, for over 20 years, the United Na
tions, the Organization for African Unity, the non
aligned countries and many other progressive
countries have -roundly condemned the South
African regime. Tfiey have also determined that it
must be destroyed by weakening it internally and by
offering support to the liberation movements. Even
some western governments like Sweden offer much
material support to the liberation struggle. The
United States, however, has consistently frustrated
the numerous U.N. resolutions demanding compre
hensive sanctions. Given this record we are highly
skeptical of Sen. Edward Kennedy's (D-Mass.) ini
tiative and the attention that is being turned to it.
It is unfortunate that our rationalists have consis
tently failed to rise to this level of abstraction in
their arguments. Could it be, perhaps, that beneath
all the stoic rationalization and the appeals for pa
tience, lies a deep-seated indifference to fundamen
tal and universal human values? The choice in this
matter is not between moral urgency and rational
discourse, as University President Kennedy would
have us believe. It is between resistance and col
laboration. Stanford stands accused as a col
laborator. Does the University have the moral
courage to face up to face this truth?
