# Editorial board
## 
### 
Persons interested in becoming the at-large-member of this summer's editorial
board should present themselves at The Daily offices at noon on Monday. We
provide the food. You provide a statement (a general outline of your philosophy on
what edit board is or should be) and should come ready to answer questions posed
by staff members.
