# Rejected bid angers ASSU
## 
### CARYL LAZZARO 
The Coffee House was the
central issue during a Tuesday
night meeting of the ASSU Sen
ate that included a a 90-minute
closed-door session.
"We are extremely disturbed
that Tresidder Union and the
Dean of Student Affairs Office
have rejected the Coffee House,
Inc.'s bid to continue the Tresid
der Coffee House as a student
owned operation, and instead
have awarded the contract to an
outside food services con
glomerate," the senate said in an
offical statement issued last night.
"What Tresidder's complaints
amount to," it continues, "are
that the convenience of Tresidder
management and the profits to
be gained from retail operations
are more important than the edu
cational and service opportunities
provided by a student-run Coffee
House.
"Of course, a student-run op
eration will never be as
'professional' as one run by a
large conglomerate. Yet Stanford
rejects this same argument when
it comes to food services in
campus housing by allowing stu
dents to run co-ops, self-ops and
eating clubs rather than having an
outside contractor to do the job."
The two-page statement also
addresses the proposal from the
Student Affairs Office for a Cof
fee House Transition Task Force
that is to develop a proposal for
the operation of the Coffee
House. "The Coffee House, Inc.
and ASSU have decided only to
participate in this task force if the
charge (proposal) is modified to
include as its primary goal a
student-controlled Coffee
House," the statement read.
At Tuesday's meeting, the sen
ate also approved an alternate
charge for the task force. In the
senate charge, student control is
more clearly defined than in the
charge issued by the Student Af
fairs Office.
Also included are plans for the
membership of the task force, as
well as a request that the ASSU

be allowed to continue operation
of the Coffee House for one
month after the close of the cur
rent contract "in order to leave
open the possibility that the Cof
fee House, Inc. might be involved
in some continuing arrangement
with Saga."
The charges are intended to
provide a structure through which
representatives of the Student
Affairs Office, Tresidder Union,
Saga, the Coffee House, Inc. and
the senate can discuss a plan of
operation for the Coffee House.
These models include instances in
which Saga and an unnamed stu
dent organization work together
as owners and operators of the
Coffee House.
The Student Affairs Office's
charge specifies objectives which
include recognition of Saga as the
main food service contractor at
Tresidder and deems that the
Coffee House must "operate
within the boundaries of the
Tresidder food contract with
Saga."
That charge also calls for
"significant student involvement"
in all areas and at all levels of the
Coffee House operation. Other
considerations include high
quality in both service and prod
uct as well as financial viability.
Further differences in the
charges exist in the specifications
for membership of the task force.
The dean's charge includes two
"at-large" student members on
the task force while the senate
charge does not provide for such
at-large positions â€” instead pro
viding a heavier concentration of
representatives of the Coffee
House, Inc.
"The senate is not trying to dis
enfranchise students at-large,"
said Senate Chair Richard Biegel.
"It's just that this is a really
serious negotiating group. The
Coffee House people have the ex
pertise, and we need strong
people who can stand up to the
administrators."
"We were looking for a greater
