## Prizzi's Honor is clearly blurred 
### STEVE WARRICK 
Jack Nicholson is one of the
most respected popular actors in
American movies, and he takes a
big chance in "Prizzi's Honor."
In "Terms of Endearment" he
had the most entertaining role,
and he could relax and do a comic
turn on his own character. He was
so flamboyantly Nicholsonesque in
"The Shining," that he went over
the top with a grinning, lurching
parody of himself.
But in John Huston's new film,
based on a book by Richard Con
don, Nicholson substitutes his
familiar drawl for a neo-
Brooklynese rumble, and he
puckers his lips to make his
mouth seem smaller. He has big
bags under his eyes, and he seems
even bulkier than in "Terms."
He's still doing the famous trick
with his eyebrow, but what he
really seems to be aiming at is a
skewed Bogart imitation.
What we see on the screen, un
fortunately, is Nicholson straining
in an opaque role; it's not clear
what his character is supposed to
be in this movie, or what Nichol
son is trying to do with his part.
What he accomplishes is a parody
of Nicholson doing Bogart; it's a
terribly confining performance,
and as he keeps repeating the
same mannerisms (the bewil
dered "o-shaped" mouth, the
eyebrow arch), he shrinks on the
screen, and the plot starts churn
ing ahead without him. When a
charismatic, commanding actor
like Nicholson fades out of a
movie, the film doesn't stay long
in your memory either.
Nicholson plays Charley Par
tanna, a hitman for the Prizzi
family, a mob organization which
Charley is raised into by his
father. The movie has him getting
involved with Irene Walker
(Kathleen Turner), a freelance
assassin who is hired by the
Prizzi's for a few jobs and double
crosses them in a Vegas scam, es
caping with several hundred
thousand dollars.
The story becomes much more
convoluted, but the central con
flict of family honor versus a
romantic relationship returns in
the final scenes.
The movie tries to be a darkly
comic "Godfather," and raises
some of the same issues of male
female, family-nonfamily
relationships within the Mafia.
But the film doesn't strike a bal
ance between the serious and
comic elements; it's full of ideas
that almost work, but that don't

make the final leap back into sa
tire.
Director John Huston has
proven himself extremely com
petent with strong storylines in
such films as "The Man Who
Would Be King" and"The Mal
tese Falcon," but he can't tran
scend a weak script. He has a
straightforward style that may
contribute to his longevity as a
director; there are no "Huston
touches" that could date his tech
nique. But the stangely shifting
moods in "Prizzi's Honor" are
out of his range.
The tone of the film makes al
most schizophrenic leaps from
comedy to parody to melodrama,
with such speed that the elements
of each get mixed up and garble
the movie's meanings.
For example, in a kidnapping
Charley and Irene are pulling off
together, Irene shoots an inno
cent bystander right in the head in
close-up, and seconds later she
and Charley are making plans for
dinner that night.
There is nothing in Turner's
characterization of Irene to
ground this scene; she seems
warm and open with Charley, but
doesn't hesitate to try to kill him
later. Are we supposed to
respond to her as a callous profes
sional or as a sympathetic, love
torn heroine? Huston and Con
don (who wrote the screenplay
with Janet Roach) don't give us a
clue; what's more, we don't really
care because the film gives no
sense of urgency to her relation
ship with Charley. "Prizzi's
Honor" diffuses the different
moods by juggling them all at
once, and we lose our involve
ment with the individual situa
tions.
This is the chief fault of the
script, which rushes through the
scenes of Charley and Irene get
ting involved without showing us
what could possibly connect their
two wildly different personalities.
Charley comes across as a dull
witted lug when he's with Irene;
in a pivotal restaurant scene, they
sit facing one another, and he's
spouting hard-boiled, detective
love prose while she seems to be
staring at a spot on his forehead.
When she says she loves him, we
don't know whether to read the
scene as parody or as a mis-timed
botch, because the filmmakers
don't show us (or don't know
themselves) what they're up to.
Turner and Nicholson don't
begin to suggest the complexity of

their respective characters, and
Irene and Charley's actions aren't
grounded in the personalities we
see on the screen. We have no
reason to believe that a bright,
shrewd woman like Irene would
fall for Charley's crude come-on;
I kept thinking that she was
stringing him along to get into the
Prizzi family.
And even if she were smitten
by love, surely she would see the
problems their marriage would
cause the Prizzi organization. Yet
neither she nor Charley seem to
realize how radical their relation
ship is; a husband and wife hit
team working within the Mafia is
certainly going to create some

friction (it would be unthinkable
in the "Godfather" movies).
Huston and Condon don't deal
with most of the issues they raise;
they leap from one plot con
trivance to the next, moving
obliquely toward the final con
frontation.
Within the framework of this
movie, the straightforward
parody roles come across the
best: William Hickey overacts
wonderfully as Don Corado
Prizzi, and Anjelica Huston, as
Charley's former wife, Maerose,
generates more heat in her scenes
with Nicholson than Turner (we
can see how these two got to
gether). These characters are

clearly defined, because they
don't have to carry the baggage of
the filmmakers' serious inten
tions.
But these intentions weigh
down most of "Prizzi's Honor":
the dimly lit cinematography (by
Andrzej Bartkowiak, who also
buried "The Verdict") declares
the underlying importance and
somberness of every scene, and
seems bizzarely inappropriate for
much of the movie. This dark at
mosphere slows down the actors
and blurs their actions, just as the
screenplay blurs the characters
and their motivations. "Prizzi's
Honor" turns into haze in our im
aginations right after we see it.

don't show us (or don't know
themselves) what they're up to.
Turner and Nicholson don't
begin to suggest the complexity of

their respective characters, and
Irene and Charley's actions aren't
grounded in the personalities we
see on the screen. We have no
reason to believe that a bright,
shrewd woman like Irene would
fall for Charley's crude come-on;
I kept thinking that she was
stringing him along to get into the
Prizzi family.
And even if she were smitten
by love, surely she would see the
problems their marriage would
cause the Prizzi organization. Yet
neither she nor Charley seem to
realize how radical their relation
ship is; a husband and wife hit
team working within the Mafia is
certainly going to create some

friction (it would be unthinkable
in the "Godfather" movies).
Huston and Condon don't deal
with most of the issues they raise;
they leap from one plot con
trivance to the next, moving
obliquely toward the final con
frontation.
Within the framework of this
movie, the straightforward
parody roles come across the
best: William Hickey overacts
wonderfully as Don Corado
Prizzi, and Anjelica Huston, as
Charley's former wife, Maerose,
generates more heat in her scenes
with Nicholson than Turner (we
can see how these two got to
gether). These characters are

clearly defined, because they
don't have to carry the baggage of
the filmmakers' serious inten
tions.
But these intentions weigh
down most of "Prizzi's Honor":
the dimly lit cinematography (by
Andrzej Bartkowiak, who also
buried "The Verdict") declares
the underlying importance and
somberness of every scene, and
seems bizzarely inappropriate for
much of the movie. This dark at
mosphere slows down the actors
and blurs their actions, just as the
screenplay blurs the characters
and their motivations. "Prizzi's
Honor" turns into haze in our im
aginations right after we see it.


Kathleen Turner and Jack Nicholson in a scene from the newly released
"Prizzi's Honor."
Jack Nicholson is one of the
most respected popular actors in
American movies, and he takes a
big chance in "Prizzi's Honor."
In "Terms of Endearment" he
had the most entertaining role,
and he could relax and do a comic
turn on his own character. He was
so flamboyantly Nicholsonesque in
"The Shining," that he went over
the top with a grinning, lurching
parody of himself.
But in John Huston's new film,
based on a book by Richard Con
don, Nicholson substitutes his
familiar drawl for a neo-
Brooklynese rumble, and he
puckers his lips to make his
mouth seem smaller. He has big
bags under his eyes, and he seems
even bulkier than in "Terms."
He's still doing the famous trick
with his eyebrow, but what he
really seems to be aiming at is a
skewed Bogart imitation.
What we see on the screen, un
fortunately, is Nicholson straining
in an opaque role; it's not clear
what his character is supposed to
be in this movie, or what Nichol
son is trying to do with his part.
What he accomplishes is a parody
of Nicholson doing Bogart; it's a
terribly confining performance,
and as he keeps repeating the
same mannerisms (the bewil
dered "o-shaped" mouth, the
eyebrow arch), he shrinks on the
screen, and the plot starts churn
ing ahead without him. When a
charismatic, commanding actor
like Nicholson fades out of a
movie, the film doesn't stay long
in your memory either.
Nicholson plays Charley Par
tanna, a hitman for the Prizzi
family, a mob organization which
Charley is raised into by his
father. The movie has him getting
involved with Irene Walker
(Kathleen Turner), a freelance
assassin who is hired by the
Prizzi's for a few jobs and double
crosses them in a Vegas scam, es
caping with several hundred
thousand dollars.
The story becomes much more
convoluted, but the central con
flict of family honor versus a
romantic relationship returns in
the final scenes.
The movie tries to be a darkly
comic "Godfather," and raises
some of the same issues of male
female, family-nonfamily
relationships within the Mafia.
But the film doesn't strike a bal
ance between the serious and
comic elements; it's full of ideas
that almost work, but that don't

make the final leap back into sa
tire.
Director John Huston has
proven himself extremely com
petent with strong storylines in
such films as "The Man Who
Would Be King" and"The Mal
tese Falcon," but he can't tran
scend a weak script. He has a
straightforward style that may
contribute to his longevity as a
director; there are no "Huston
touches" that could date his tech
nique. But the stangely shifting
moods in "Prizzi's Honor" are
out of his range.
The tone of the film makes al
most schizophrenic leaps from
comedy to parody to melodrama,
with such speed that the elements
of each get mixed up and garble
the movie's meanings.
For example, in a kidnapping
Charley and Irene are pulling off
together, Irene shoots an inno
cent bystander right in the head in
close-up, and seconds later she
and Charley are making plans for
dinner that night.
There is nothing in Turner's
characterization of Irene to
ground this scene; she seems
warm and open with Charley, but
doesn't hesitate to try to kill him
later. Are we supposed to
respond to her as a callous profes
sional or as a sympathetic, love
torn heroine? Huston and Con
don (who wrote the screenplay
with Janet Roach) don't give us a
clue; what's more, we don't really
care because the film gives no
sense of urgency to her relation
ship with Charley. "Prizzi's
Honor" diffuses the different
moods by juggling them all at
once, and we lose our involve
ment with the individual situa
tions.
This is the chief fault of the
script, which rushes through the
scenes of Charley and Irene get
ting involved without showing us
what could possibly connect their
two wildly different personalities.
Charley comes across as a dull
witted lug when he's with Irene;
in a pivotal restaurant scene, they
sit facing one another, and he's
spouting hard-boiled, detective
love prose while she seems to be
staring at a spot on his forehead.
When she says she loves him, we
don't know whether to read the
scene as parody or as a mis-timed
botch, because the filmmakers
don't show us (or don't know
themselves) what they're up to.
