# Madonna: a pretty packaged product
## 
### MARSH McCALL Editorial staff 
The first point which should be
made is that "Madonnamania"
has little to do with her music. It's
not bad, it's not offensive, but it's
nothing special.
One can imagine the scenario
inside the offices of Warner Bros.
MADONNA: Hi — I'd like a
recording contract, with a possi
ble film option by the summer of
'85.
OLD EMBITTERED REC
ORD EXECUTIVE: Young
lady, do you know how
many women walk inside this of
fice each day and beg for a
recording contract?
MADONNA: But I'm differ
ent. I'm spunky, slutty, yet like a
virgin and a tease.
EXEC: Hmmm...
MADONNA: I also represent
the "new look."
EXEC: Which is?
MADONNA: Bare tummy,
white lacy bra, iron crosses,
tossled hair, coquettish glances.
And a carefully choreographed
angle of repose on my album
covers.
EXEC: I must say — I'm im
pressed. And you think you could
sell this to 13-year-old girls?
MADONNA: With your help.
I'll need lots of publicity about
how I actually shun publicity, spe
cial anti-conditioning shampoos,
and some people to write songs
for me with drum machines and
synthesizers. People will eat it up.
EXEC: By God, I think we'll
give it a try!
MADONNA: There is one

thing I should mention — I can't
sing. Not any better than your
average, boring female vocalist.
EXEC: No problem — modern
technology can do wonders!
That's a little severe, I realize.
But part of my critique of "Like a
Virgin" is an evaluation of
popular reception to Madonna's
music.
Madonna, with respect to the
songs on this album (No. 8 on the
Bilhboard charts after 30 weeks),
does some things right: The lyrics
are self-mocking, to a degree,
therefore instilling some light
headedness into what could have
been a melodramatic embarrass
ment.
Bands that don't take them
selves too seriously (with the ex
ceptions of U2 and Big Country)
usually relax listeners and thereby
become more accessible.
The success of Huey Lewis and
the News, for example, is due to
this factor. Lewis' songs are all
tried and true formulae, but the
attitude "The old boy may be
barely breathin'/ But the heart of
rock 'n roll is still beatin' " lets us
know that this band only wants to
share some fun. %
Madonna and her songwriters
tap into this vein as well; in
"Material Girl" Madonna adopts
an attitude of humorous, mock
conceit: "Boys may come and
boys may go/ And that's all right
you see/ Experience has made me
rich/ And now they're after me."
Futhermore, the major "frame
of reference" in this record — the
conflict between Madonna's ex
perienced, "tainted" persona and

her wishful "like a virgin" naivete
is rather fresh and (I admit it)
somewhat titillating: "You've got
style/ That's what all the girls say/
Satin sheets/ And luxuries so fine
... I'll show you something that
you'll really like" (Dress Me Up)
is coupled with another, more vir
ginal image: "Your love thawed
out/ What was scared and cold"
(Like a Virgin).

This is all very well as far as it
goes; every performer or group
has an image, and if the image is
carefully crafted, all the better.
The problem is that behind the
image there must be some sort of
substance — musicianship, extra
good songwriting, a new sound,
etc.
Behind "Like a Virgin" there is

a pretty, young lady with a com
petent voice and some degree of
musical and songwrting talent.
And one would think, judging
from Madonna's recent tour, in
which she performed in concert
halls the size of the Cow Palace,
that she was an extraordinary tal
ent.
She's not. She's a product of
manufacturing. She is being sold

in addition to her music — a
package deal. Again, no great sin'
if the package is worth the atten
tion. Many female vocalists in the
Bay Area sing as well or better
than Madonna, and they will
never achieve the same recogni
tion because they don't fit the
aforementioned old embittered
record executive's idea of a good

media package for public con
sumption.
As I said, "Like a Virgin" isn't
offensive, and it isn't bad. There
are some nice moments, including
better than usual vocals on the
ballad "Love Don't Live Here
Anymore" and "Shoo-Bee-
Doo," and a general feeling of
earnestness in the singles "Like a
Virgin" and "Angel."

But, as I also said, Madonna, at
least on "Like a Virgin," is noth
ing to cough up eight bucks for. I
realize it may not be quite fair to
introduce the subject of her
popularity when critiquing her
work. I guess I'm just jealous —
she makes much more money
than I do, and she has a much
cuter belly button.

aforementioned old embittered
record executive's idea of a good

media package for public con
sumption.
As I said, "Like a Virgin" isn't
offensive, and it isn't bad. There
are some nice moments, including
better than usual vocals on the
ballad "Love Don't Live Here
Anymore" and "Shoo-Bee-
Doo," and a general feeling of
earnestness in the singles "Like a
Virgin" and "Angel."

But, as I also said, Madonna, at
least on "Like a Virgin," is noth
ing to cough up eight bucks for. I
realize it may not be quite fair to
introduce the subject of her
popularity when critiquing her
work. I guess I'm just jealous —
she makes much more money
than I do, and she has a much
cuter belly button.


Madonna's "angle of repose" on her hit album "Like a Virgin."
The first point which should be
made is that "Madonnamania"
has little to do with her music. It's
not bad, it's not offensive, but it's
nothing special.
One can imagine the scenario
inside the offices of Warner Bros.
MADONNA: Hi — I'd like a
recording contract, with a possi
ble film option by the summer of
'85.
OLD EMBITTERED REC
ORD EXECUTIVE: Young
lady, do you know how
many women walk inside this of
fice each day and beg for a
recording contract?
MADONNA: But I'm differ
ent. I'm spunky, slutty, yet like a
virgin and a tease.
EXEC: Hmmm...
MADONNA: I also represent
the "new look."
EXEC: Which is?
MADONNA: Bare tummy,
white lacy bra, iron crosses,
tossled hair, coquettish glances.
And a carefully choreographed
angle of repose on my album
covers.
EXEC: I must say — I'm im
pressed. And you think you could
sell this to 13-year-old girls?
MADONNA: With your help.
I'll need lots of publicity about
how I actually shun publicity, spe
cial anti-conditioning shampoos,
and some people to write songs
for me with drum machines and
synthesizers. People will eat it up.
EXEC: By God, I think we'll
give it a try!
MADONNA: There is one

thing I should mention — I can't
sing. Not any better than your
average, boring female vocalist.
EXEC: No problem — modern
technology can do wonders!
That's a little severe, I realize.
But part of my critique of "Like a
Virgin" is an evaluation of
popular reception to Madonna's
music.
Madonna, with respect to the
songs on this album (No. 8 on the
Bilhboard charts after 30 weeks),
does some things right: The lyrics
are self-mocking, to a degree,
therefore instilling some light
headedness into what could have
been a melodramatic embarrass
ment.
Bands that don't take them
selves too seriously (with the ex
ceptions of U2 and Big Country)
usually relax listeners and thereby
become more accessible.
The success of Huey Lewis and
the News, for example, is due to
this factor. Lewis' songs are all
tried and true formulae, but the
attitude "The old boy may be
barely breathin'/ But the heart of
rock 'n roll is still beatin' " lets us
know that this band only wants to
share some fun. %
Madonna and her songwriters
tap into this vein as well; in
"Material Girl" Madonna adopts
an attitude of humorous, mock
conceit: "Boys may come and
boys may go/ And that's all right
you see/ Experience has made me
rich/ And now they're after me."
Futhermore, the major "frame
of reference" in this record — the
conflict between Madonna's ex
perienced, "tainted" persona and

her wishful "like a virgin" naivete
is rather fresh and (I admit it)
somewhat titillating: "You've got
style/ That's what all the girls say/
Satin sheets/ And luxuries so fine
... I'll show you something that
you'll really like" (Dress Me Up)
is coupled with another, more vir
ginal image: "Your love thawed
out/ What was scared and cold"
(Like a Virgin).

This is all very well as far as it
goes; every performer or group
has an image, and if the image is
carefully crafted, all the better.
The problem is that behind the
image there must be some sort of
substance — musicianship, extra
good songwriting, a new sound,
etc.
Behind "Like a Virgin" there is

a pretty, young lady with a com
petent voice and some degree of
musical and songwrting talent.
And one would think, judging
from Madonna's recent tour, in
which she performed in concert
halls the size of the Cow Palace,
that she was an extraordinary tal
ent.
She's not. She's a product of
manufacturing. She is being sold

in addition to her music — a
package deal. Again, no great sin'
if the package is worth the atten
tion. Many female vocalists in the
Bay Area sing as well or better
than Madonna, and they will
never achieve the same recogni
tion because they don't fit the
aforementioned old embittered
record executive's idea of a good

media package for public con
sumption.
