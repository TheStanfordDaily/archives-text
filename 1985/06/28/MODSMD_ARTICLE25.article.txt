### Raymond Carver 
"Where Water Comes Together
With Other Water"

Random House, 130 pp., $13.95
More expensive, but only just,
than two seats at the new Galaxy
Theatre on Van Ness Avenue in
San Francisco, Raymond Carver's
first 44 major" collection of poetry
becomes something of a bargain if
you add to the price of admission
a tub of the yellow stuff. These
are popular, readable poems;
they slide down easily with a
generous squirt of flavored corn
oil (i.e. Crystal Palace 44 butter").
A friend of mine, David Leh-

man to be exact, has a few scintil
lating lines like: "We made love
in every room of the house/ And
in the car and under stars and at
all times of day." Carver isn't al
ways this erotic. In fact, he's a
good deal more testy about ex
wives, current girls and recal
citrant daughters. But his poems
read well in bed, sitting overnight
alongside the alarm clock. They
keep well on the toilet tank in be
tween dumps. The coffee table
and the living room couch are
fine. But you know, really good

poems demand isolation, your
complete attention; these don't.
That's what I mean by popular,
readable — you can do these
poems doing something else.
As an avid reader of this space,
you recognize Raymond Carver
as a short-story writer. The dust
jacket comments make no bones
about the 44 resemblance to his fic
tion" and the 44 prose-like" diction
of these poems. Many of the
poems are incidental; they are
"little stories" about drinking,
divorce, fishing and knocking
about the house with a certain
emotional intensity. In short,
there is a quantitative difference

between Carver's poetry and
prose, not a qualitative one. Or as
they say in the breakfast cereal
commercial: "All the fiber . . .
without the bulk!"
How does Carver achieve this
economy of space, you ask. One
method frequently employed is to
treat poetry as narrative with the
wind-up cut short: the no-delivery
slider — just the stuff. "How on
my first job I worked/ under a
man named Sol. Fifty-some years
old, but / a stockboy like I was./
Had worked his way/ up to noth

ing." The reversal of a cliche
gives this pitch the spin it needs.
But Carver's attempt at poetic
economy is actually a prose im
port: his diced-up phrases con
tribute to the style of "casual
reminiscence." Sol the clerk is a
character cut short, or cut out of a
short story.
So, from a cynically quan
titative viewpoint, these poems
are often shorter short
stories. But there is at least one
qualitative consideration here:
We are to accept poetry as the
medium for observations too
personal to appear in a story with
out being tagged as "self-con
scious" or "self-revelatory." So
the poem then is the space in
which the fiction writer can be
candid, deal directly with the
bothersome incidentals of his
very own life. This idea is, of
course, a crock. But it seems to be
the mind-set from which these
poems were written. Here's the
nationally famous writer making
a go of it; fame has its cost, and all
that.
When dealing with emotional
strain, Carver will turn up the
volume on his language rather
than work that strain into the very
texture of the language itself. In a
poem about his daughter's al
coholism, he exclaims, "Oh,
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus Christ! You've
got to take hold now./ Do you
hear me? Wake up! You've got to
knock it off/ and get straight.
Clean up your act. I'm asking
you./ Okay, telling you. Sure, our
family was made/ to squander,
not collect. But turn this around
now./ You simply must — that's
all!" Why won't his daughter lis
ten? Maybe it's because Carver's
method (volume), when imported
from prose to poetry, is ineffec
tual without the attention to lang
uage which poetry as a genre
demands.
There are a few poems in which
Carver has some success at
poetry. "My Dad's Wallet" is a
fine study in which "cash" value
and "emotional" value collide
with a somber effect. "Listening"
pits the man alone against his
radio, isolation and the influx of
history, art, laughter and death.
Carver's poetry is chiefly good
reading, but only occasionally
good poetry.
