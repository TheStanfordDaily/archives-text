### Julian Barnes 
"Flaubert's Parrot"

Knopf, 190 pp., $13.95

"Flaubert's Parrot" is a trib
ute to Flaubert as a writer and
as a philosopher. It is not
purely a biography or literary
criticism, but a little of each,
combined with a fictional nar
rative to create a novel which,
while modernist in style, is
Flaubertian in ideas. It is an at
tempt to pay homage to the
great French novelist of the
nineteenth century, to present
his life and art from many dis
tinct vantage points without,
however, "betraying" Flaubert
through endless biographical
and literary interpretation and
reinterpretation.
In Flaubert's own words,
"When you write the biog
raphy of a friend, you must do
it as if you were taking revenge
for him." Julian Barnes has
indeed been a good friend to
the author of "Madame
Bovary," using the master's
own words to belittle the tradi
tional criticism (both positive
and negative) of his work and
«to warn against any attempt to
understand his work through
his life. According to Barnes,
most writers desire that no
biography be written about
them, not for fear of gossip,
but because they want their
work to stand alone.
Although Flaubert left no
instructions - regarding
biographies of his life, he did
leave particulars of his feelings
toward criticism. "How rare a
sense of literature is! You'd
think that a knowledge of lan
guages, archaeology, history,
and so on, would help. But not
in the least! Supposedly ed
ucated people are becoming
more and more inept when
dealing with art. Even what art
is escapes them. They find the
annotations more interesting
than the text. They set more
store by the crutches than the
legs."
By creating art rather than
merely picking it apart, Julian
Barnes has adhered to
Flaubert's beliefs in this
"critical novel." He uses a
number of literary devices, in

eluding a bestiary and an ex
amination paper, to get a
glimpse of Flaubert's art and
life, but, refreshingly, he does
not try to assign details of
Flaubert's art to those of his
life. In his ''examination"
chapter, Barnes sums up the
Flaubertian raison d'etre of his

ding it increasingly difficult to
distinguish Art and Life.
Everyone claims to understand
the difference, but perceptions
vary greatly. For some, Life is
rich and creamy, made accord
ing to an old peasant recipe
from nothing but natural prod
ucts, while art is a pallid com
mercial confection, consisting
mainly of artificial colorings
and flavorings. For others,
Art is the truer thing, full, bus
tling and emotionally satisfy
ing, while Life is worse than
the poorest novel: devoid of
narrative, peopled by bores
and rogues, short on wit, long
on unpleasant incidents, and
leading to a painfully predict
able denouement.
Both Flaubert and the nar
rator of this biographical novel
are of the latter type, living for
Art, despising Life. Therefore,
though Julian Barnes may have
betrayed Flaubert by writing a
type of biography, he redeems
himself and takes revenge for
Flaubert by his artistic min
gling of art and life in
"Flaubert's Parrot."
