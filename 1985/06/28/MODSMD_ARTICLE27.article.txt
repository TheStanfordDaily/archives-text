## For good food, Mr. Steak is no joke 
### 
If there's one thing I learned in the
process of this review, it is that all steak
houses are not created equal — they don't
all serve rubbery steaks, over-cooked
baked potatoes and dinner salads with a
meager portion of warm, wilted lettuce.
Mr. Steak in Campbell, approximately a
30-minute drive from the University, truly
defies the sterotyped image of steakhouses,
serving instead a wide variety of tasty beef,
chicken and seafood entrees at reasonable
prices.
The quality of food definitely comes first
at Mr. Steak, as one quickly realizes from
the rather poorly decorated establishment.
The wood paneling certainly doesn't do
much to make one feel as if he or she were
dining at an elegant restaurant. But then
again, one doesn't go to Mr. Steak to
admire the furniture or gawk at attractive
wall decorations — one travels to the res
taurant for a well-prepared, better-than
home-cooked meal.
The waiters and waitresses at Mr. Steak
are courteous and efficient — all our orders
were served precisely as we had requested
them. Our waiter was also quick to give us
the free refills on our soft drinks — another
bonus situation at Mr. Steak. It is clear —
as evidenced in part by the free refills —
that the restaurant strives to attract the
family-type crowd which is looking for a
good meal on a low budget.
Mr. Steak features seven different ap
petizers, including the standard potato
skins and deep fried mushrooms. The five
members of my party split an order of moz
zarella fried cheese sticks ($2.99) and Mr.
Steak's very own "Spud Skin Nachos"

($3.49) — a Mexican-style potato skin in
cluding taco meat, jalepenos and melted
cheddar cheese. We agreed that these
unique skins were delicious and could
easily make a complete dinner for one per-

son. The fried cheese sticks, however, left
something to be desired — the cheese was
enveloped in far too much breading and
arrived to our table only lukewarm.
Our entree selections, however, some

what rectified the failings of the cheese
sticks. The highlights included the Taco
Salad Grande ($4.95) , the Smothered
Ground Beef ($5.25) and the filet mignon
($8.95). Most complete dinners at the res-

taurant come with bread, a choice of
Ceasar style or garden salad or the soup of
the day, and a choice of potato, wild rice
and a vegetable.
The taco salad, served in a crisped tor

tilla shell — found at many a trendy, yuppy
restaurant — was full of taco meat, lettuce,
onions, tomatoes and sour cream. The
lettuce was crisp and cool, and the meat
was, as might be expected, fresh and spicily
seasoned. There was also enough meat
spread throughout the salad — unlike
some restaurants which serve palty por
tions of meat drowned in a bed of lettuce.
The taco salad is a must-try item at Mr.
Steak, especially for those who prefer a
somewhat lighter meal.
The filet mignon was prepared to the
medium-rare choice we selected and, like
the taco salad, was delicious. The only pos
sible drawback was the small size of the
piece of meat — a hungry person could
easily consume two of these tasty steaks.
While the words "smothered ground
beef' evoke images of hamburger swim
ming in a fatty gravy, Mr. Steak pleasantly
surprises the diner with a lean piece of
beef covered with sauteed mushrooms,
green peppers and onions. While the meat
was good, the french fries we ordered to
accompany the steak were extremely un
dercooked — they were a watery shade of
pale white.
The dinners were so filling that we did
not have room to indulge in a scoop of
America's favorite sherbet — rainbow.
All in all, we found Mr. Steak to be a
refreshing change from your typical steak
houses serving gristle-filled meat. Mr.
Steak should be on every steak-loving
Stanford student's list of frequented dining
establishments.
