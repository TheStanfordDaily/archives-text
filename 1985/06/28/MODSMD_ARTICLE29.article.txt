Star Wars (1977)
Memorial Auditorium, Stanford
Top-flight entertainment, made
(by George Lucas) with imagination
and great charm. This science
fiction fantasy about kidnapped prin
cesses, initiations into mystical
knighthoods, and the struggle for
supremacy between the forces of
good and evil, suggests a fusion of
Tolkien and Marvel Comics, though
Lucas' major source was clearly the
movie version of "The Wizard of
Oz." Lucas is not an artist but in
"Star Wars" he seems to have found
out how good an entertainer he can
be. With Mark Hamill, Carrie Fis
her, Alec Guinness and (best of all)
Harrison Ford.
Plays Sunday.
A View to a Kill
Old Mill 6, Mountain View
"A View to a Kill," the 15th
James Bond movie, has an un
usually clever and reasonable plot,
and Christopher Walken and Grace
Jones make a great pair of villains.
But Roger Moore is way too old for
us to believe any of his stunts, and
his leading ladies are looking more
like his daughters with each film;
the series needs a strong central
character, and Moore is dead air on
the screen. Director John Glen and
the rest of the crew have done a bet
ter job of distracting us from this
central void this time out; "A View
to a Kill" is scaled just right, and the
plot seems cleaner and the incidents
less random than usual. The climax,
set atop the Golden Gate Bridge, is
exciting in a way that the last few
Bond's weren't; Glen sets up the
angles so we always get a sense of
great height, and the shots down the
cables instill a real vertigo. With
Tanya Roberts as the girl next door.
Rambo
Palo Alto Square
When John Rambo (Sylvester

Stallone) is released from prison by
his old commander (Richard
Crenna) on the condition that he
return to Vietnam to track down
MIAs, his terse reply is a Reagan
era classic: "Sir, do we get to win
this time?" No doubt this hit
picture, scripted by Stallone and
James Cameron and directed by
George Cosmatos, is deeply offen
sive — politically moronic and
ultra-racist — but it's difficult to
keep that in mind when you're sor
ting through the idiocies of the plot,
which pits Stallone against
thousands of Vietnamese and Rus
sians, headed by a malevolent
Steven Berkoff. (His performance is
among the movie's greater offen
ses.) Stallone goes for the Clint
Eastwood prize, carefully removing
anything that might look like ex
pressiveness from his face, but he
throws it away in the final scene,
when he gives the "We vets just
want America to love us as much as
we love it" speech in a tear-choked
tremolo. You may choke, too, espe
cially when you hear Stallone's
brother Frank on the theme song
("Peace in My Life") on the end
credits. Shot by the prodigious Jack
Cardiff, who makes the movie look
much better than it deserves to.
Perfect
Park, Menlo Park
Rolling Stone reporter Aaron
Latham wrote the script for
"Perfect," basing it on two of his
own Rolling Stone articles (a John
DeLorean -interview and an
aerobics expose), and Rolling
Stone's editor, Jann Wenner, plays
the editor of Rolling Stone —
named Mark Roth. Wenner's name
change makes about as much sense
as anything else in this movie, which
manages the curious feat of being
both confusing and predictable at
the same time. John Travolta once
again wastes his considerable tal
ents, this time on a combination
love story/"Absence of Malice" -

style journalism epic (both plots are
unbelievably sentimental); director
James Bridges' appears to have
made no attempt to tie the two plot
threads together, and the brilliant
cinematographer Gordon Willis
seems to be working at the bottom
of his form here — perhaps he was
taking his revenge on the material.
A serious look at aerobics might
have served as the basis of a good
movie, but here aerobics only serves
as an editing device — whenever
Bridges needs a transition between
his various plot strands, he cuts in
30 seconds of sweating bodies. With
that great stone face, Jamie Lee
Curtis, as the aerobics queen, and
Marilu Henner and Laraine New
man as women who find love at the
gym.
The Breakfast Club
New Varsity, Palo Alto; Belmont
Theatre, Belmont
John Hughes' film bristles with
the self-importance of a movie that
thinks it has something earth
shattering to say about teenagers.
The five protagonists, stuck to
gether for eight hours in an unor
thodox Saturday detention, are an
athlete (Emilio Estevez), a juvenile
delinquent (Judd Nelson), a prom
queen (Molly Ringwald), an ec
centric (Ally Sheedy), and an 'A'
student (Anthony Michael Hall,
who takes the acting honors). In the
course of the day, they form al
liances, engage in confrontations of
various kinds, get stoned, discuss
sex, reveal their hang-ups, become
friends and pair off. Occasionally
Hughes' talent for adolescent con
versation surfaces, but most of the
dialogue is of a confessional nature,
which strands most of the actors.
The movie is heavy-handed and
pretentious, but it impresses
teenage audiences with its self
seriousness.
Plays nightly at the Belmont;
plays Sunday through Tuesday with
"The Sure Thing" at the New Var
sity.

The Gods Must Be Crazy (1984)
Guild, Menlo Park
Do people love this picture be
cause the comedy is lowest-common
denominator burlesque (really
primal — sub-Three Stooges stuff)
under the guise of political satire?
The writer-director-photographer
editor, Jamie Uys, seems to know
what he's doing when there's no one
on screen but his charming bushman
hero, Ki, and a baboon or an ele
phant, but the moment other human
beings show up his routines (and
camerawork) become so crude
you'd swear he'd never seen a
movie. Marius Weyers, as the
biologist in the Kalahari Desert who
falls apart when he's around a beau
tiful woman, dominates most of the
film, and he's appalling. (It's not
merely that his timing is bad; he has
no apparent sense of humor at all.)
The story line has something to do
with his romance with a trans
planted urban schoolteacher, with
desperate rebels taking hostages
and with Ki's efforts to get rid of a
Coca Cola bottle dropped from a
passing plane onto his tribe, and
which he considers a lunatic, bur
densome gift from the gods. (Thus
the title.) The target of Uys' satire is
obvious — a confused (mostly
white) urban society.
Nosferatu the Vampyre (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In making his version of
"Dracula," Werner Herzog was in
spired by Murnau's 1922 classic
"Nosferatu." Herzog's imagery
echoes Murnau's and in some in
stances expands on it — as in the
creepy sequence where the streets
of Bremen fill up with coffins. Klaus
Kinski gives a fascinating perfor
mance as the vampire; the scene in
which he stays all night with Lucy
(eerily beautiful Isabelle Adjani)
may be the most unusual piece of
erotica in the history of movies.
Lumpy and unevenly acted as it is
(Bruno Ganz makes a vacant Jonat
han Harker), this film contains

flashes of brilliance.
Plays Thursday with "The Com
pany of Wolves."
Stop Making Sense (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Jonathan Demme's film of the
Talking Heads' appearance at the
Pantages Theatre in Hollywood in
December '83, with a brilliant vir
tuoso performance by the lead
vocalist/songwriter David Byrne.
No rock performer since the young
Mick Jagger can have demonstrated
such an overwhelming combination
of precisely directed energy, razor
wit and versatility. With his mon
goose neck and scarecrow body, his
hair slicked back except for a furtive
patch that explodes over one eye, he
looks like a demented Walker
Evans figure, but everything he
does is funny. He never stops mock
ing himself; he can be science
fiction hero and villain, mutant,
devil and evangelist, nerd and ob
sessive, and yet remain the crown
prince of nonsense, a New Wave
Edward Lear. Demme's direction of
the film is not merely a matter of
taste and tact: He constructs the
movie the way Byrne constructed
the concert, on a theatri
cal/cinematic metaphor that peaks
in the "stop making sense" number,
"Girlfriend Is Better," when Byrne
thrusts his mike in front of a techie
creeping around on stage with a
lighting instrument and then points
the mike at the camera — at us. The
other members of the band — Jerry
Harrison, Chris Frantz, Tina
Weymouth, Bernie Worrell, Alex
Weir, Steve Scales, Ednah Holt and
Lynn Mabry — each demonstrate a
distinctive personality. Byrne wrote
most of the songs, which have dry,
sneaky word-game lyrics that
bounce off each other like billiard
balls and veer off into unanticipated
directions. An ecstatic movie, su
perbly lit by Jordan Cronenweth
(adapting the stage lighting de
signed by Byrne and Beverly Em
mons).
Plays Thursday through next
Saturday, July 6, with "Dance
Craze."
