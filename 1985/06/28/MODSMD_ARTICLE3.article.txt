# Student trial to close soon

PALO ALTO — A jury was fi
nally seated Wednesday in the
trial of the nine Stanford students
arrested for sitting in at the Bur
sar's Office on May 28.
So smoothly are things
proceeding that a swift conclusion
to the week-long trial is now in
sight. Defense attorney Steve
Nakano is hoping for a verdict by
Monday. David Romo, the only
student defending himself, said,
"I think we will have a verdict on
Friday."
Of the nine arrested, only four
appeared in court yesterday —
Romo, Mario Huerta, David
Magnus and Joseph Mosnier. Of
the five others arrested May 28
for their sit-in, two — Caroline
Paul and Jennifer G. Grant —

pleaded no contest, and three are
out of state.
Each student has been charged
with a number of misdemeanors.
The more salient ones include
failure to leave private property
after being admonished to do so,
failure to disperse, unlawful as
sembly and resisting arrest.
Much of the evidence had been
presented by the end of yester
day's session. In cross-examining
the witnesses, the attorneys went
into minute detail, attempting to
reconstitute the events of May 28
from the start of the sit-in at the
Bursar's Office at 1 p.m. to the
eventual arrests shortly after 5
p.m.
Most of the witnesses brought
to the stand yesterday were mem
bers of the Stanford Police De
partment. Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer said that on the
day of the arrests, the doors were
closed to the public at 4 p.m. so as
"not to let any student in, and
only let students out." Members
of The Daily, however, were
allowed in after that time.
Niemeyer testified that the
protesters were peaceful,
cooperative, and not abusive. He
ordered the arrest of the nine stu
dents when they remained after
having been warned of the
charges that would be brought
against them. The other members
of the Stanford police confirmed
Niemeyer's account.
The defendants will try to use
the presence of Daily reporters
after 4 p.m. as one way of disput
ing the charge of refusing to dis
perse when ordered.
California Penal Code 409
specifies that this charge applies
to "every person remaining pres
ent at the place of . . . unlawful
assembly, after the same has been
warned to disperse, except public
officers and persons assisting
them in attempting to disperse
the same." Presumably, Daily
reporters would not be among
those immune if the Bursar s of
fice had indeed been a "place of
unlawful assembly."
Romo declared that he was in
the Bursar's Office to "prevent
crime, and not to commit it." Ac
cording to Romo, the protesters
considered the Bursar's Office
a symbol of the University's in
vestments in companies doing
business in South Africa.
Romo stressed that he waated
to appeal to the "spirit of the
law" rather than its technicalities.
He noted that California Penal
Code 602n states that failure to
leave private property is a mis
demeanor when there has been
"malicious mischief," and also
that the penal code for unlawful
assembly is grouped with the
codes for lynching and inciting to
riot.
Romo estimated that he and his
fellow protesters have "a 10 per
cent chance of winning," adding,
"We already have one victory —
we have been able to educate a
jury."
