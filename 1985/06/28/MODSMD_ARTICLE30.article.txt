## Conferences brighten campus in summer 
### TRACEY BANKS Staff writer 
Summer visitors ranging from
an Australian tennis team to engi
neering executives are brought
here each summer through the ef
forts of Lois Fariello, manager of
conferences at Stanford, and her
staff at the Conference Office.
Like many other universities,
Stanford has discovered that
hosting conferences in dormitor
ies during the summer months is
an extremely profitable business.
In 10 weeks of summer confer
ences, Fariello's office earns a
gross profit of $3.5 million.
Since the first summer confer
ence in 1947, which consisted of
317 conferees in one residence
hall, the Conference Office's re
sponsibilities have grown con
siderably. This summer, Stanford
will host 163 conferences and
programs and over 12,000
people. Forty-six percent of Stan
ford facilities are utilized — most
of those that are not undergoing
summer maintenance at the time.
The profits that come from the
conferences go "right back into
the student room-and-board ac
count," Fariello said, noting that
without so much income from
summer conferences, student
living expenses would increase at
a much higher rate.
In addition, conferences pro
vide summer employment for the
regular University housing and
food service staff as well as a
number of Stanford students.
"The students (we hire) are the
backbone (of our office's suc
cess)," Fariello said. "They are
good [public relations] people,
and they know the campus."
The benefits to the Stanford
community, however, are not
only financial. The conferences
bring famous scholars together to
discuss the latest in a variety of
fields.
Fariello cites the Stanford

"name, weather and facilities" as
reasons for its success as a confer
ence site. "We don't really ad
vertise," she said. "People that
come here like it."
Fariello describes the office as
a "one-stop shopping center"
that provides room, board, trans
portation and meeting rooms for
groups that do not want to pay
hotel prices. "Other universities
kind of use us as a role model,
and we always try to help them,"
she added.
Conferences range in subject,
size and length.
The Stanford Executive Pro
gram is the premier conference of
the summer, as the Graduate
School of Business takes over
Lagunita Court for eight weeks,
wining and dining 200 of the top
executives from around the
world.
Three members of the
Australian tennis team, by con
trast, make up the smallest con
ference of the summer.
Besides the conferences and
conventions, there also are a
number of athletic camps. The
football and men's and women's
basketball coaches all run large
one-week camps. There are also
five sessions of cheerleader camps
beginning July 15 with a total of
over 1,500 girls expected to at
tend.
With an enlarged staff from
June to September, summers
usually go off smoothly, Fariello
said. However, Fariello noted
that security is an important con
cern becuase "people that
shouldn't be here are roaming
around."
In addition, there are the usual
problems that occur in all dormi
tories. Fariello says that many
conferees seem to "want to relive
their college days," observing
that "adults are not much differ
ent than Stanford students when
it comes to parties."
