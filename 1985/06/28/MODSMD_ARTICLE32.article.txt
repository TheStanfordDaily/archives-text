## Elways set up camp 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
Last summer, after having been named the Stan
ford football coach the previous December, Jack El
way inherited the Stanford Football Camp.
He brought in 50 other coaches, some Stanford
alumni who had gone on to play professionally, and
for one week taught 325 high school and junior high
school players the finer points of the game. "We
want to put on a quality camp,"he had said.
Evidently he succeeded. The camp for 10- to 18-
year-olds now hosts 525 players. The coaching staff
is up to 75, and the players seem to think it's worth
the money their parents are paying — $200 for
commuters, $275 for residents.

Sports roundup

A dozen players sat around a room in Burbank
and had little but praise for the football end of the
camp."The coaches put out a lot of effort," one
said.
The players were enthusiastic about what they
learned about football but spoke even more about
the talks on personal life, or "How we should be as
people." One player said, "They teach more than
just football."
There was also a theme that one would expect to
find at Stanford — academic excellence in addition
to athletic excellence. "They told us to be winners in
the classroom, as well as on the field," a player said.
There were also some negatives. Living in Stern
Hall — players are housed in Wilbur and Toyon
Halls as well — and eating dorm food did not thrill
anyone. Neither did the pungent smell that accom
panies late-night sprinkler operation, or a by
product of that — mosquitos.
Another negative aspect has been theft in the
dorms. Vandalism also has occurred, though as El
way said, "You get 525 guys together, and things

like that are bound to happen."
The players also said there has been "interaction"
with high school girls living in Wilbur for the sum
mer but refused to give details on the record.
The players have to get up as early as 7 a.m. for a
day that features three practice sessions. The first
two are in pads, and the third is a light workout that
emphasizes technique in areas like running and
weightlifting. A typical day also includes watching
films like San Francisco 49ers or Denver Broncos
highlights.
The Broncos film is included because El way's son
John, a former All-American at Stanford, is receiv
ing top billing with his dad on the brochures for
what is called "Football Camp with the Elways."
John also helped with Sunday's quarterback clinic
that attracted about 200 aspiring signal-callers.
Four of Elway's Denver teammates — center
Keith Bishop, quarterback Gary Kubiak, tight end
John Sawyer and tackle Dave Studdard — are on
the staff. So are former Stanford All-Americans
such as quarterback John Brodie, wide receiver
Gene Washington, offensive lineman Pat Donovan,
former athletic director Chuck Taylor, running back
Darrin Nelson and wide receiver Ken Margerum.
The camp ends today with full-scale scrimmages
in the three age-groups — the College All-Stars
(10-12), USFL (13-15) and NFL (16-18).
Another benefit of the camp for Coach Elway is
that it gives him and his staff a chance to identify
players who could one day play for the Cardinal.
"We're looking at between 30 and 40 from this
year's camp who we may be interested in for foot
ball scholarships," he said.
