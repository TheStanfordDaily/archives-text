## Experts discuss recent terrorism 
### ERIK McDERMOTT 
As the hijacking crisis in Beirut completes
its second week, the Reagan Administration
is still advocating a hard-line, no
negotiation policy as the only way of dealing
with terrorism and has threatened economic
and military sanctions against Lebanon if
the hostages are not released within a few
days.
Three experts at Stanford were asked to
evaluate the Reagan Administration's stand
and comment on the recent wave of ter
rorism in general.
Prof. Richard Roberts
History Prof. Richard Roberts, an expert
on modern African history, stresses that ter
rorism is directed less at an external target
such as the U.S., than at a domestic political
situation.
Terrorism serves to politicize domestic
politics by raising the stakes of not taking
sides, he says. Equally important, according
to Roberts, terrorism is the product of this
domestic situation. To understand terrorism
one must look beyond the motives of indi
vidual terrorists and concentrate instead on
the internal process which leads to acts of
terrorism, according to Roberts.
Prof. Hugh Marshall
Political Science Prof. Hugh Marshall
generally agrees with Prof. Roberts' views.
He points to the events of the last few years
as leading to the new wave of terrorist at
tacks against the United States, with the
crucial event being the Israeli invasion of
Lebanon in 1982. This brought the United
States, Israel's strongest supporter, into the
quagmire of the Arab-Israeli conflict, Mar
shall savs.

Strong anti-American sentiment also
developed when the United States labored
to bring the right-wing government of Amin
Gemayel, the current Maronite Christian
president of Lebanon to power. The an
tagonism toward the United States was ex
acerbated when the United States then
fought to have Gemayel sign an Israel-
Lebanon peace treaty that ridiculed
Lebanese sovereignity. According to Mar
shall, this anti-Americanism found tragic
expression in the suicide attacks of Islamic
fundamentalists.
Prof. Marshall emphasizes the rise of fun
damentalism and of the "Party of God," or
Hezbollah, in particular. Although probably
not under Ayatollah Khomeini's direct in
fluence, members of Hezbollah view
Khomeini's Iran as a model for an Islamic
state "purged" of Western influence. Anti-
American feeling is strongest among these
fundamentalists.
In sharp contrast, the Shiite militia con
trolled by Nabih Berri has much stonger
Western tendencies and is somewhat
secular. Berri himself used to live in Detroit.
Although Berri's militia is clearly domi
nant at this stage, Hezbollah's fundamen
talism is putting Berri on the defensive. For
Marshall, this is the crucial point. The
hijacking must be seen within the context of
a power struggle between Amal and Hez
bollah, with the United States as a pawn.
The Lebanese faction winning control of
the prisoners currently held by the Israelis
may be the ultimate winner of the power
struggle, Marshall says. In light of Hezbol
lah's extremism, Marshall strongly recom
mends that the prisoners be released to

Bern.
Marshall also denounces Reagan's hard
line stance as "nonsense" and points to the
great success rate of these methods in tack
ling domestic hijackings and hostage-taking.
For terrorists, "the fear of death is no
longer a deterrent and refusing to negotiate
has no deterrent power," he said.
Jim Noyse
Jim Noyse, deputy assistant secretary of
defense for Near Eastern, African and
South Asian Affairs from 1970-76, supports
negotiations. He says he suspects that
negotiations are already underway, no mat
ter how hard-line Reagan claims to be.
In addition, the Israelis were going to
release the prisoners anyway, Noyse says.
The trick now, he says, will be to do so with
out seeming to give in to the terrorists.
Noyse fully endorses releasing the prisoners,
especially since they are detained in viola
tion of international law.
Noyse also believes that the terrorists'
motives extend beyond securing the
prisoners' release. "Why did they hijack the
plane if the prisoners were going to be
released anyway?" he said.
Noyse views Reagan's threats of punitive
sanctions as being primarily designed to give
Berri some ammunition in pressing for the
hostages' release. The problem then
becomes, what happens if the threats are ac
tually carried out? The two proposed sanc
tions — closing the airport and blockading
the country — would in Noyse's opinion be
counterproductive.
"They want us to do something foolish
and provocative," he said. "We must not fall
into that trap."
