# Students react to Saga
## Express misgivings about Coffee House takeover 
### MARSH McCALL Editorial staff 
Not all Stanford students are happy with how
the Coffee House has been run this year or in
past years. However, when Tresidder Union an
nounced last week that Saga Corporation had
been awarded a contract for Tresidder food
services, which includes the Coffee House, few
students seemed pleased.
"It sucks," said senior Lisa Segre. "I don't like
the idea of a big corporation taking over the Cof
fee House.
"I also think it's a good management experi
ence for students," she said.
Saga supplies "contract food services" to ap
proximately 330 universities nationwide, and
Sept. 1 takes control of the Coffee House. The
Coffee House has been operated since 1980 by
Coffee House, Inc., a corporation owned by the
ASSU.
Jim Connelly, area sales director for Saga, said
yesterday that students will still get management
experience under Saga. "We expect to have a stu
dent board of directors participating in selecting
management. We will be very responsive to stu
dent input," he said.
The image of Saga as a large, institutionalized
food contractor has also caused many students to
fear that, as senior Bill Richards said, "The at
mosphere of the Coffee House will change.

"The Coffee House has a cultural atmosphere
to it — it's not institutionalized, and I'm 100 per
cent sure that will now change," said Richards,
who will return as a graduate student here this
fall. "Economically, perhaps it could be more ef
ficient — sweeping people in and out, making
more money — but the students like the Coffee
House the way it is. The bottom line is, what
counts? Money or the students?"
Alec Rawls, a graduate student in economics
and a Coffee House regular, echoed this view. "It
would be a tremendous loss to give up the Coffee
House," he said. "It's the only place on campus
where a grad student doesn't feel segregated
from undergraduates, who tend to monopolize
the social life on campus."
According to Connelly, the Coffee House will
undergo no physical changes under its new
owners. The Coffee House is currently scheduled
to be relocated in the old bowling alley in fall
1986, an area now occupied by terminals of the
Low Overhead Time Sharing (LOTS) computer
system.
Until then, "The Coffee House won't be physi
cally changed," Connelly said. "There won't be
any changes at all. We think the Coffee House is
excellent the way it is now, and we want to
preserve the atmosphere as much as the students
do."

Stanford students appear generally opposed to the prospect of Saga Corp. taking over the Coffee House
in September. "It sucks," said one student.
