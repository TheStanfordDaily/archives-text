## Shultz sets another condition U.S. adds 7 hostages in Beirut barter 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administration,
raising the stakes in Beirut, is insisting on the immediate
and unconditional release of all 46 Americans held
hostage in Lebanon, including the seven kidnapped prior
to the hijacking of TWA Flight 847.
Two of those seven have been held for more than a year.
Secretary of State George Shultz for the first time Wed
nesday emphatically linked demands for the freedom of
the seven to the release of the 39 hostages from the
hijacked TWA plane.
"We are working intensely on this matter, and we insist
on release of our hostages, all 46 of them, immediately
and unconditionally," he said when asked about the seven
during an appearance in San Francisco.
Vice President George Bush echoed Shultz, telling
reporters in Brussels, Belgium, yesterday, "That's always
been the (U.S.) position. Release them all."
Only Tuesday, White House spokesman Larry Speakes
had said the plight of the seven was not being addressed in
the same package as the larger group.
But Peggy Say, sister of one of the seven captives, said
yesterday it was the pressure of press coverage that has

made the U.S. government link demands for their release
with the 39 TWA hostages.
Say, sister of kidnapped Associated Press correspondent
Terry Anderson, said she was feeling very emotional be
cause for the first time she had read in the newspaper
"that George Shultz said, 'They have 46 of our people and
we want them back.' "
44 When I picked up the paper this morning, I said, 'You
did it. The media did it,' " Say said on the NBC
"Donahue" program.
Administration officials declined to publicly or privately
speculate whether linking the group of seven to the 39
could throw a monkey wrench into the sensitive
diplomatic maneuverings for release of the hijacking
hostages.
Nabih Berri, the Shiite leader who is handling negotia
tions from the hijackers' side for the release of the 39
American hostages, has said the seven are not under his
control.
Say and relatives of some of the other hostages periodi
cally voiced frustration prior to the hijacking that the ad
ministration was not doing enough to free them and that

she and other relatives had been unable to meet with
Reagan.
White House spokesmen confirmed yesterday that
Reagan had not met with any family members of the seven
previously, but that he would meet in Chicago today with
relatives of the Rev. Laurence Jenco, a Roman Catholic
priest held since Jan. 8 of this year.
Besides Anderson, 37, the AP's chief Middle East cor
respondent based in Beirut, and Jenco, 50, the five
Americans held since before the hijacking are William
Buckley, 56, U.S. Embassy political officer, kidnapped
March 16, 1984; the Rev. Benjamin Weir, 60, a Presby
terian minister, May 8, 1984; Peter Kilburn, 60, librarian
at the American University of Beirut, Dec. 3, 1984; David
Jacobsen, 54, director of the American University's hospi
tal, May 28, 1985; and Thomas Sutherland, dean of the
American University's agricultural school, June 9, 1985.
Captors of the seven are believed to be members of
radical Islamic groups.
U.S. officials have insisted they are not certain where
the Americans are being held, but that they apparently are
being held in different locations and that different groups
may be holding them.
