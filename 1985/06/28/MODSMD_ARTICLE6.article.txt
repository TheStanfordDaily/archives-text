# House approves Nicaragua troop ban
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The House voted
overwhelmingly yesterday for a Pentagon
budget bill that freezes authorized defense
spending next year and includes a ban on
the use of U.S. combat troops against the
leftist government of Nicaragua.
The bill was approved 278-106 on final
passage, ending two weeks of debate and
votes on a wide variety of national security
items, including the MX missile, "Star
Wars" research and nerve gas.
A conference committee will now at
tempt to work out differences between the
House and Senate versions of the Pentagon
bills.
The ban against troops in Nicaragua was
approved, 312-111, after four hours of
sometimes acrimonious debate during
which the specter of the Vietnam war was
often invoked by both sides.
Rep. Thomas Foley (D-Wash.) pro
posed the ban, arguing that it would only
write into law President Reagan's stated
intention not to use American soldiers to
fight the Sandinistas.

But opponents said it would unfairly tie
Reagan's hands in a time of attack against
American people and installations over
seas and that it would illegally limit the
president's constitutional role as
commander-in-chief.
The bill authorizes most of a proposed
$292 billion Pentagon budget for the fiscal
year starting Oct. 1.
That would be $10 billion less than the
defense bill approved earlier by the
Republican-run Senate, which proposed to
permit military spending to rise at the ex
pected rate of inflation. Reagan supports
the Senate plan, although he originally
sought a 5.9 percent hike beyond inflation.
Later yesterday, the House approved a
$4 billion cut in spending next year on mili
tary retirement and directed the Pentagon
to come up with reforms in a system which
has been criticized as too generous.
None of the 1.4 million people now re
ceiving retirement pay nor the 2.1 million
people now in uniform would have their
benefits reduced.

The cuts mean the Pentagon will only
put aside $14.2 billion next year for retire
ment, rather than the $18.2 billion which
had been requested. The Senate proposed
a smaller cut — $1.8 billion — in retire
ment.
•The House also gave voice-vote ap
proval to a proposal making espionage a
crime punishable by death under the Uni
form Code of Military Justice.
The measure was sponsored by Rep. Bill
McCollum (R-Fla.), who said, "I can think
of nothing that's more dramatically dem
onstrated the need for this than the Walker
case." That was a reference to the current
Navy spy case, in which four men are
charged with passing secrets to the Soviet
Union.
The Nicaraguan debate was the latest
round in the long-running fight over the
administration's Central America policy.
While Reagan has said he wouldn't use
American combat forces there, he has
strongly criticized the Sandinistas, and his
administration is openly supporting a force
of 12,000 to 15,000 Contra rebels who are

trying to overthrow the Managua govern
ment. Congress has limited U.S. aid to the
Contras.
Meanwhile, the Pentagon has conducted
a series of large-scale exercises in Hon
duras, a U.S. ally bordering Nicaragua.
Foley's proposal would ban the use of
U.S. combat troops unless a "clear and
present danger" exists to Americans or
U.S. installations.
On June 6, the Senate voted 64-31
against a proposal similar to the Foley
measure.
Shortly after the debate began, the
House voted 377-45 to approve a proposal
by Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) that the
Foley ban would not apply if Nicaragua
receives Soviet MiG jets or similar
warplanes.
Later, the House rejected, 235-186, a
proposal by Rep. Dan Burton (R-Ind.)
that would have permitted Reagan to use
combat troops if he found that Nicaragua
was aiding the leftist rebels trying to over
throw the government of neighboring El
Salvador, a U.S. ally.
