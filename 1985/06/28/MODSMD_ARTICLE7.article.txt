ANC calls for South African revolt
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — The African National
Congress yesterday called for a full-scale uprising against white
rule, urging black police and soldiers in South Africa "to turn
your guns against your masters."
"The end of apartheid is near," the guerrilla organization said
in its "call to the people," sent from ANCs office in Lusaka,
Zambia.
It was the strongest such summons ever issued by the black
nationalist group, which was formed in 1912, banned by the gov
ernment in 1960, and which abandoned its policy of non-violent
resistance the following year.
The ANC also said South African police set a trap that was re
sponsible for the hand grenade and bomb explosions that killed
eight blacks and wounded seven in townships east of Johannes
burg on Wednesday.
It said police posing as guerrillas gave grenades to inexperi
enced activists and "deliberately instructed them wrongly,"
causing the grenades to blow up in their hands.
Police headquarters in Pretoria gave a different account. It said
the grenades or bombs went off in the young men's hands as they
prepared to attack black policemen's homes in a "coordinated
terrorist attack." The wounded men were hospitalized under
police guard. News reports, said they could face charges of
sabotage or terrorism.
The multiracial South African Council of Churches rejected
the police account, saying it shared "the belief of the people (in
the townships)" that the grenade incidents "came from the side
of the authorities." The council suspended a national meeting in
Johannesburg so delegates could attend a memorial service for
grenade victims in Duduza township.
The ANC urged black soldiers and police to "earn your place
in the free South Africa that is coming by organizing to turn your
guns against your masters." The statement was sent by telex and
was issued on behalf of 250 delegates who last week attended
ANCs first members' conference since 1969.
The document followed a sharp rise in rioting and bombings.
ANC President Oliver Tambo told reporters in Lusaka on
Tuesday that the conference had vowed to intensify guerrilla war
and that more civilians were likely to die.
Last September, rioting against apartheid — the government's
racial segregation system by which 5 million whites control 22
million blacks — spread in black townships across the country.
White areas were largely unscathed, but more than 400 blacks
perished in the violence. The ANC has said blacks are making
large parts of South Africa "ungovernable."
The ANC has stepped up sabotage recently.
On Wednesday, bombs in the Transkei tribal homeland
destroyed a fuel depot, setting off a huge fire, and damaged a
power station and water line in Umtata, the capital. Two days
earlier, a mine blast damaged the Johannesburg offices of an ex
plosives firm that fired 600 workers in a labor dispute.
Dole calls for attention to air terror
MONTREAL — U.S. Transportation Secretary Elizabeth
Dole, describing air terrorism as a "burgeoning global menace,"
called yesterday for urgent international action to safeguard
world aviation.
Dole, speaking to a special meeting of the International Civil
Aviation Organization, presented a multi-pronged proposal to
fight back against a wave of airplane hijackings and bombings.
She urged the agency's governing council to urgently focus its
attention on international terrorism; monitor various countries'
investigations of recent attacks on airplanes and airports; exam
ine security practices for aircraft and cargo; and consider recom
mending "a vastly increased security program"; and call a special
session of the full 156-nation organization membership for late
summer to review progress in improving aviation security.
The agency sets standards and recommends procedures for all
aspects of civil aviation, including security at international air
ports, but individual member agencies alone have the authority
to enforce the security rules.
Finns aided Israel militia defection
TEL AVIV, Israel — A U.N. investigation has found that Fin
nish peacekeepers staged a fake attack and helped members of
an Israeli-backed militia defect to the Shiite militia Amal in south
Lebanon, U.N. sources said yesterday.
The finding is contained in a report on the June 7 incident that
prompted the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army to take
hostage 25 members of the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon. All the U.N. soldiers were released unharmed by June
15, although 21 Finns were held for eight days.
U.N. Spokesman Timur Goksel declined to comment on the
findings of the investigation headed by Col. Jean Pons, deputy
commander of the 5,700-member U.N. force.
The report was submitted to U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar and was to be officially released in New York.
Eleven militiamen, all Shiite Moslems, deserted from the
predominantly Christian South Lebanon Army with Finnish help
and were not the victims of a forcible abduction by Finnish sol
diers as claimed by militia chief Antoine Lahd, said U.N. sources
who were familiar with the reporf s findings.
But the investigation also determined that the Finns did not
coordinate their actions with U.N. headquarters.
The sources, who spoke on condition they not be identified,
said U.N. investigators determined that the Finnish commander,
V. Hakala. had been approached by the 11 militiamen.
