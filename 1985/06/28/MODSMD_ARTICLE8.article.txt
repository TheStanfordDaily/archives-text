'Animal' uses light for food
NEW ORLEANS — The discovery of a one
celled organism that uses light for food — the
first animal known to do so — could lead to un
derstanding of how light can be converted to
other energy and to new food sources, a re
searcher says.
Until Pill-Soon Song's discovery, only plants
and bacteria were known to photosynthesize — a
process in which light is changed to energy. But
Song found evidence of photosynthesis in a blue
green, trumpet-shaped protozoa called Stentor
coeruleus — a creature about as long as a thread
is wide that looks like a speck of dust in water to
the naked eye.
Song, a chemistry professor at Texas Tech, said
the discovery will help understand how light can
be changed into a useful form of energy in animal
cells, and this can be compared to the way the
same thing is done by plants and bacteria.
Song said he and other scientists at Texas Tech
made the discovery 18 months ago while studying
how Stentor backpedals to get away from light.
The interval between the discovery and the an
nouncement was spent making sure the creature
really does turn light to energy, he explained.

WASHINGTON — The federal government's
top information security cop said yesterday that
the Soviets can tap easily into business and gov
ernment telecommunications networks to get vi
tal secrets.
Walter Deeley, chief of communications secur
ity for the National Security Agency, raised the
possibility of wholesale computer raids by un
friendly forces as he defended a presidential
directive to place tighter controls on sensitive
computer and telephone systems.
But the chairman of the House Government
Operations Committee, counsel for the Ameri
can Civil Liberties Union and a representative of
industry criticized the directive as an impediment
to the free flow of unclassified information.
Under an order by President Reagan last Sep
tember, the National Security Agency began
working to place secure telephones on desks of
government officials and industry executives
dealing with the military. The agency also has
begun an effort to persuade computer manufac
turers to produce a low-cost device to guard
against unauthorized entry into the systems.
