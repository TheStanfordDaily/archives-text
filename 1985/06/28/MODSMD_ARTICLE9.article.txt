Anti-S. Africa bill passes
SACRAMENTO — The Assembly, for the
first time in six years of anti-apartheid attempts,
has approved a bill to prohibit future investments
of California state money in South Africa.
The author, Assemblywoman Maxine Waters
(D-Los Angeles), said late yesterday before the
44-24 vote, "I will stay on this issue and I will
raise the level of debate on it. . . . We can get
freedom in South Africa. We don't have to worry
about fiduciary responsibility."
Waters' opponents argued that the state
legislature was no place to discuss foreign policy,
and that others like the Afghanis who need
similar help may feel cheated. They said her bill,
A 81134, may be illegal under both state and
federal law, and that it might cost jobs in South
Africa.
Her most powerful ally, Assembly 'Speaker
Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), said, "It is im
proper (for California) to assist in maintaining"
apartheid in California, and that the bill
"responds to an identified problem."
Added Assemblywoman Teresa Hughes (D-
Los Angeles), "We've tried carrots. Now its time
for sticks."
Only Democrats voted for the bill, which
would prohibit future investments of public trust
funds, state employee pension funds and other
state money in companies that do business in
South Africa or with its government.
A staff analysis said these include the Public
Employees' Retirement Fund, the Legislator's
Retirement Fund, the Teachers Retirement
Fund, the Surplus Money Investment Fund,
moneys designated by the Pooled Money Invest
ment Board, and state treasury funds.
Only one Democrat voted against the bill.

UC apartheid foes acquitted
BERKELEY — A jury yesterday acquitted 10
protesters charged with blocking the entrance to
UC-Berkeley's Sproul Hall during April
demonstrations against the university's business
ties to South Africa.
Prosecutor Greg Bailey attributed the decision
to the judge, who instructed the jury to balance
the issue of free speech against the value of laws
against blocking entrances.
The jury, however, could not decide whether
the protesters should be convicted on charges of
resisting arrest. They were dismissed by the judge
after deliberating nine hours.
Judge Kenneth Chotiner, of the Los Angeles
Muncipal Court, had earlier tossed out charges of
trespassing on university property.
The four-week trial grew out of demonstra
tions by thousands of protesters against the uni
versity's investments in South Africa-related
businesses and financial institutions.
Gov. to veto $501 million
SACRAMENTO — Gov. George Deuk
mejian said yesterday that he is vetoing $501 mil
lion from "a little overweight" $35.3 billion state
budget sent to him by the California Legislature.
"Tomorrow I will sign into law California's
new budget, a $34 billion, 12-month plan to im
prove our children's schools, create more job op
portunities, repair and expand our roads and
highways and better protect your communities
from criminals and toxic hazards," he said.
He delivered a 10-minute statewide television
address yesterday evening that stressed the
"positive initiatives" of the budget for the fiscal
year that begins July 1.
