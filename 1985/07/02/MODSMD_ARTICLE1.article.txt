# Fire chars 1,000 acres by campus

LOS ALTOS HILLS — A massive
brush fire that raged out of control for
nearly three hours yesterday afternoon
burned an estimated 1,000 acres three
miles south of the Stanford campus,
damaging 16 houses and leaving dozens
homeless.
Police took Phillip Hummel, 36, of La
Honda, into custody late yesterday after
noon on suspicion of arson but released
him last night after questioning, according
to Palo Alto Police Dispatcher Ralph
Able. The evidence against Hummel was
entirely circumstantial, Able said.
Despite the release, Able said authori
ties are still investigating the possibility of
arson.
Aided by 100-degree temperatures and
gusting winds, the fire began around 3 p.m.
and spread quickly in an area roughly
bounded by Interstate 280, Page Mil! Road
and Arastradero Road. Parts of Palo Alto
and Los Altos Hills were burned, as well as
some acreage on undeveloped Stanford
land.
No serious injuries were reported, al
though paramedic crews treated at least
eight people for minor injuries and smoke
inhalation.
All told, the fire destroyed nine homes
and damaged seven others — many of
them valued around $500,000 — and re
quired 200 fire fighters from 11 Peninsula
and South Bay fire agencies to extinguish
it, according to Palo Alto City Clerk Ann
Besides ground crews, helicopters and
air tankers were called in to fight the fire.
The air tankers dropped fire-retardant

chemicals while the helicopters dropped
water they picked up from local swimming
pools and lakes.
"Yes, my house is gone — all of it," said
one woman, who was in tears. "It hap
pened so quickly that no one could do any
thing about it."
Fire officials, who operated from a com
mand post at the Palo Alto Hills Golf and
Country Club, refused to speculate on the
cause of the fire, although people in the
area said they heard fireworks immediately
before the blaze began to scorch the hilly,
rural area around 3 p.m.
As he was working on a home south of
Page Mill, Tom Gregory said he "heard
firecrackers around 2:30 or 3 by the horse
stables" in the hills on the other side of
Page Mill, where the fire began. "Basically,
it just started hopping," he said. "It creates
its own wind and jumps."
One man, whose house was closer to the
outbreak of the fire, said, "Our painter
(who was in the house at the time) said he
heard cherry bombs going off."
Ann Collins, a Los Altos Hills resident,
said, "We've heard something the last
couple of nights, and my husband said it
sounded like firecrackers."
Not all residents were convinced that the
fire was deliberately set. "We've had a lot
of little fires around here recently," Nancy
Fast said. "People drive up the roads here
and are careless. We've had two fires up
the street in the last week-and-a-half."
The fire, centered north of Page Mill,
jumped to the south side of the road as
winds picked up, threatening several new
homes. Residents helped firefighters put
out the sporadic blazes on the hillside with
shovels and garden hoses. Many also hosed

down their roofs and yards as a precaution.
The blaze sent smoke billowing over
Stanford and much of the Peninsula and
caused huge traffic tie-ups during evening
rush-hour on Page Mill, Alpine Road and
the southbound lanes of 1-280, where
smoke poured over the freeway.
Firemen evacuated the residential area,
and homeowners congregated on Page Mill

near 1-280. Only fire and police personnel
and members of the media were allowed in
the area, so most residents were forced to
wait for news about the fate of their homes.
Some of the homeless spent the night at a
Red Cross emergency center at Gunn High
School in Palo Alto.
