# Fire chars 1,000 acres by campus

### JOHN LIS MARK ZEIGLER Editorial staff 
LOS ALTOS HILLS — A massive
brush fire that raged out of control for
nearly three hours yesterday afternoon
burned an estimated 1,000 acres three
miles south of the Stanford campus,
damaging 16 houses and leaving dozens
homeless.
Police took Phillip Hummel, 36, of La
Honda, into custody late yesterday after
noon on suspicion of arson but released
him last night after questioning, according
to Palo Alto Police Dispatcher Ralph
Able. The evidence against Hummel was
entirely circumstantial, Able said.
Despite the release, Able said authori
ties are still investigating the possibility of
arson.
Aided by 100-degree temperatures and
gusting winds, the fire began around 3 p.m.
and spread quickly in an area roughly
bounded by Interstate 280, Page Mil! Road
and Arastradero Road. Parts of Palo Alto
and Los Altos Hills were burned, as well as
some acreage on undeveloped Stanford
land.
No serious injuries were reported, al
though paramedic crews treated at least
eight people for minor injuries and smoke
inhalation.
All told, the fire destroyed nine homes
and damaged seven others — many of
them valued around $500,000 — and re
quired 200 fire fighters from 11 Peninsula
and South Bay fire agencies to extinguish
it, according to Palo Alto City Clerk Ann
Besides ground crews, helicopters and
air tankers were called in to fight the fire.
The air tankers dropped fire-retardant

chemicals while the helicopters dropped
water they picked up from local swimming
pools and lakes.
"Yes, my house is gone — all of it," said
one woman, who was in tears. "It hap
pened so quickly that no one could do any
thing about it."
Fire officials, who operated from a com
mand post at the Palo Alto Hills Golf and
Country Club, refused to speculate on the
cause of the fire, although people in the
area said they heard fireworks immediately
before the blaze began to scorch the hilly,
rural area around 3 p.m.
As he was working on a home south of
Page Mill, Tom Gregory said he "heard
firecrackers around 2:30 or 3 by the horse
stables" in the hills on the other side of
Page Mill, where the fire began. "Basically,
it just started hopping," he said. "It creates
its own wind and jumps."
One man, whose house was closer to the
outbreak of the fire, said, "Our painter
(who was in the house at the time) said he
heard cherry bombs going off."
Ann Collins, a Los Altos Hills resident,
said, "We've heard something the last
couple of nights, and my husband said it
sounded like firecrackers."
Not all residents were convinced that the
fire was deliberately set. "We've had a lot
of little fires around here recently," Nancy
Fast said. "People drive up the roads here
and are careless. We've had two fires up
the street in the last week-and-a-half."
The fire, centered north of Page Mill,
jumped to the south side of the road as
winds picked up, threatening several new
homes. Residents helped firefighters put
out the sporadic blazes on the hillside with
shovels and garden hoses. Many also hosed

down their roofs and yards as a precaution.
The blaze sent smoke billowing over
Stanford and much of the Peninsula and
caused huge traffic tie-ups during evening
rush-hour on Page Mill, Alpine Road and
the southbound lanes of 1-280, where
smoke poured over the freeway.
Firemen evacuated the residential area,
and homeowners congregated on Page Mill

near 1-280. Only fire and police personnel
and members of the media were allowed in
the area, so most residents were forced to
wait for news about the fate of their homes.
Some of the homeless spent the night at a
Red Cross emergency center at Gunn High
School in Palo Alto.

destroyed in yesterday's blaze.
The fire was contained by 6:30
p.m., and some fire vehicles left
the area by 8. However, many
firemen expected to remain late
into the night to completely extin
guish the fire.
Electricity was out last night in
parts of Palo Alto and Los Altos
Hills as a result of the fire, the
Palo Alto Utilities Department
said. Gas mains in the immediate
fire area also were turned off.
The Associated Press reported
that about 50 school children
were temporarily stranded when
barricaded roads confined them
to Foothill Park, but a bus was
dispatched to take them home.
The children were not in danger.
Many residents of the burned
area were not at home when the
fire broke out, and heard news of
the blaze at work.
Joe Szilagyi, who had lived in
his now-burned house on Lid
dicoat Lane for 12 years, said he
was on his way home from work
when he saw the smoke. "When I
got here, it was gone," he said of
his house as he waited in line at a
roadside pay phone to call his in
surance agency. 'T walked up to
try to find any of our animals, but
I couldn't find anything."
A Canadian family, who was
here visiting, was resting from
traveling the previous day when
the fire started. "Everybody was
asleep except for the kids," said
Larry Aranas. "We loaded the
kids in the car, and my sister-in
law drove it and left me. I tried to
get what I could, but there was
too much smoke. I had to douse
myself with water."
One house ironically may have
been saved by the fire itself. The
heat from the fire evidently
opened a water faucet that sent
water spouting 15 feet high in

the fire.
"It got so hot that it burned
through the solder of that water
faucet, and the faucet thing
popped right off," Gilbert said as
he surveyed the charred remains
of his neighbor's house. "That
saved our house."
A smaller brush fire two miles
north of the main blaze also
broke out later in the afternoon. It
burned a few acres on the horse
race track of the Portola Valley
Training Center, near the back of
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center. However, firefighters
quickly brought that blaze under
control.
Some non-residents also
pitched in to fight the conflagra
tion. Sam Cochrin, 16, and Jean
Francois Bary, 17, said they saw
the fire from their house on the
east side of 1-280 and decided to
get a closer view. "We drove over
to check it out," Cochrin said.
"Then we went home and
changed clothes, and went back
to help out."
The fire was the only one yes
terday in Northern California, but
the Associated Press reported 10
others in the southern part of the
state, where temperatures soared
as high as 118 degrees. Most of
those fires were in San Diego,
Ventura and Riverside counties.
