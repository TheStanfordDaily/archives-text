In the competitive world of carbonated
beverages, grapefruit sodas are relative babies. Al
though the base for grapefruit soda, citric acid, had
been used for years (since World War II) to provide
soft drinks with a tart flavor, the first true grapefruit
soda, Squirt, was not available until 15 years
ago. Today, the market for grapefruit sodas has
blossomed into a bright field of no less than five
brands for sale in the average-sized supermarket.
Grapefruit sodas come in as many varieties as the
people who drink them. Some contain pulp; others
use artificial flavoring; still others retain only a hint
of grapefruit flavor. But this is all flummery; the key
to rating grapefruit sodas is to stick to the guidelines
rigorously and not let these extras distract you.
The guidelines ask three questions:
1. How much does it cost?
2. Can I get it cheaper somewhere else?
3. Can I peel the price sticker off in the hope of
revealing a lower price underneath?
The flavor should strike the correct balance be
tween tartness and sweetness. A good test of this is
to let a can of the soda go flat, then drink it. It
should not cause traumatic hypoglycemia.
Carbonation should be tested in a similar manner:
The soda should take more than a few hours after
opening to go flat. On the other hand, the carbonat
ing bubbles should not be of excessive size. For in
stance, bubbles the size of gallstones are right out.
Grapefruit sodas, applying the criteria above, can
be divided into three categories: Abysmal, Standard
and Exceptional.
The Abysmal soda has two distinguishing charac
teristics: the taste, which rivals a bad month of
Ripple, and the ingredients, which sound either
mildly radioactive or massively toxic to any given
chordate. (Chemists take note! You can learn some
pretty nifty polysyllabic names to drop at the next
cocktail party.) Fortunately for mankind, only one
soda fills the criteria.
Squirt (Squirt & Co., Holland, Mich., $2.79 a six
pack): The first . . . and worst. The least of this
drink's problems is overcarbonation. I mean golf
ball-size bubble city. Do not serve this if you're
trying to impress. On the other hand, it's just the
thing when that special bastard drops in. A six-pack
works as well as a dozen black roses.
The Standard soda is just that: Like a Yes album,
it is neither violently offensive nor passionately ex
citing. It is the moral equivalent of a Sunday after

noon.
Shasta (Shasta Beverages, Inc., Hay ward, Calif.,
$1.79 a six-pack): At the low end of the standard
category because of the addition of NutraSweet
which will probably turn out to cause cancer of the
datum in overfed laboratory rodents. Still is a good
buy, even if saccharine by any other name tastes as
sweet. A good thing to have when dieting friends
call.
Cragmont (Safeway Foods, Inc., Los Angeles,
Calif., 99 cents a 2-liter bottle): The Safeway house
brand, even less notable and less noticeable than

Shasta. It reminds you of a Chinese dinner in that,
five minutes after you've finished it, you cant re
member what you had.
By elimination, the Exceptional soda is not
Abysmal and is not Standard. It is finely
carbonated, tastes tart and contains real grapefruit
juice (no flavored plastic added). The bottom line is
you'd be proud to serve this with your pressed al
mond duck.
Hansen's (Hansen Hill Natural Beverages, Inc.,
La Mirada, Calif., $2.29 a six-pack): Southern Cali
fornia redeems itself. About the only offensive facet
of this soda is its ad campaign's allegation that Tim
Hansen single-handedly subsidizes Third World
economies. Hansen's is the most widely available
Exceptional soda, and success hasn't spoiled it yet.
Corr's Natural (Corr's Natural Beverages, Inc.,
Chicago, 111., $ 1.79 a six-pack): No, not Coor's. This
is a great value for your soda money; in fact, it's
fairly hard to distinguish this from Hansen's, except
that Corr's is a bit too acidic.
I am almost certain a few readers will want to slit
my throat for neglecting their personal favorites: for
this I am truly, truly sorry. Please write in if this is
the case, because a second column on this topic will
be fairly hard to write otherwise.
