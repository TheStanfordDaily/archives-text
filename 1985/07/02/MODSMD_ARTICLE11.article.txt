## Reagan defense is very offensive

(This is the first of a three-part se

Reagan administration's proposed
"Star Wars " defense system.)

VIEWPOINT

Defense Initiative (SDI) on
March 23, 1983, it captured the
imagination of the Western world
and fueled innumerable contro
versies between East and West,
North and South, and many dif
ferent groups within the United
States itself. Raging debates
touch upon all dimensions of the
Star Wars program, from its tech
nical and strategic aspects to its
economic and political implica
tions. In order to shed some light
on what the real consequences of
Star Wars will be in the short and
long term, the following conten
tions (myths) have been coun
tered by a myriad of facts which
may ultimately dampen public
enthusiasm for the Star Wars
strategy.
Myth number one: The U.S.
"strategic initiative'' is
"defensive".
rhe offensive potential of such
a space-based system is even
greater (and will be operational
sooner) than its purely
• defensive" components. The
Stockholm Institute for Peace

Research explains that a laser sys
tem being developed for ballistic
missile defense (BMD) would be
adequate for anti-satellite func
tions before it reached its full
fledged BMD stage of sophistica
tion.
In any case, the systems pro
posed for defense against ballistic
missiles are technically very
similar to those used to attack
satellites in orbit. The current
weapons, which are small and
mobile enough to be disguised as
any other air-based missile, pose
significant verification problems
for the future. With the develop
ment of these double-purpose
American attack satellites, the
distinction between offensive and
defensive systems is becoming
blurrier than ever, and the Soviets
will be forced into assuming the
worst and reacting in kind.
Such a defensive/offensive
combination would contradict the
tenets of deterrence, based on
strategic parity. Air Force Under
secretary Ed Aldridge suggests
the quest for superiority inherent
in the SDI when he explains that
"One does not have to stretch
one s imagination to see that the
nation in control of space could
control the whole world."
However, according to re
search findings of the last two
years, any nuclear exchange
would be sufficient to set off a nu
clear winter that would envelop
the whole earth.
