## The 						Keystone rocks: Greg Kihn do it 
### 
The Keystone Palo Alto was the
place to be last Saturday night, as Solu
tion, Shakes and Greg Kihn took the
stage for four hours of non-stop rock 'n'
roll.
Kihn showed little exhaustion after a
long day and a long tour, which, as he
announced when he took the stage,
found him waking up in New Jersey.
Proclaiming, "God, it's good to be back
in California," Kihn overwhelmed the
audience with new songs and old
favorites.
Bounding across the stage in a gaudy
turquoise-and-pink flowered shirt,
Kihn opened with a personal rendition
of "Jailhouse Rock" which included the
lyrics, "come on, Palo Alto, let's rock."
He maintained this level of intensity
throughout his entire performance and
appeared completely at ease for the
duration of his hour-long set.
Crowd members were the fortunate
ones when Kihn burst into a rousing
version of his hit, "I Got Lucky." This
was followed by "Don't Mess With My

Toot-toot," a song Kihn claimed to
have heard on a "Que Pasa" station
while touring in Texas.
Kihn's four band members appeared
to be enjoying themselves as much as
the crowd, which was on its feet clap
ping and dancing for much of the per
formance.
"Boys Won't Leave the Girls
Alone," a song from his new album "Cit
izen Kihn," held the crowd in rapt atten
tion, and "Jeopardy," one of his more
popular numbers, set the tone for his
finale.
And the closing song was the one
much of the audience had been waiting
for; from the first few notes of his early
hit "The Break-Up Song," Kihn cer
tainly proved to the capacity crowd that
"They don't write 'em like that
anymore."
The audience didn't let Kihn off the
stage for more than a few seconds; he
reappeared almost instantly for his first
encore. " Reunited," which included the
lyrics, "Reunited after the fall, reunited

after all," made a perfect follow-up to
the preceding song, which was dedicated
to "anyone who's ever broken up."
Patrons of the Keystone Saturday
night were treated to two opening acts
before Kihn's 11:45 p.m. entrance. Solu
tion, a young heavy metal band from
the Bay Area, was followed by Shakes.
The audience responded favorably to
the danceable rock 'n' roll of Shakes,
another Bay Area band which fre
quently appears at the Keystone.
"American Dream" and "Get Up and
Dance" were especially well done, and
Shakes' talent and stage presence were
an indication of good things to come in
their future.
The evening's performance made it
clear that rock music is still alive in the
hearts of Bay Area fans. Greg Kihn ex
emplified the feelings of the Keystone
audience with his parting comment,
"Rock 'n' roll will never die. ..."
