# San Francisco's dazzling Ring
## 
### ROBERT BLUMEN 
This June, the San Francisco
Opera completed its most am
bitious and expensive production
ever: three complete perfor
mances of Richard Wagner's
cycle "The Ring of the
Nibelung. ,, Three years in the
making and with a budget
exceeding $5 million,"The Ring"
has aroused intense excitement
locally and focused worldwide at
tention on the company.
"The Ring" is a series of four
operas based on Norse and
Teutonic legends. The story con
cerns a power struggle for control
of the world. It is often inter
preted as an allegorical tale about

the relationship between man and
nature, creation and destruction
"The Ring" was written by
Wagner over a period of 25 years,
during which it grew from the
single opera he originally envi
sioned to the massive cycle that
he finally completed. In order to
create "The Ring,'" Wagner
found it necessary to develop and
implement a new theory of opera
which unified literary, dramatic
and musical elements.
This version of "The Ring" was
conceived by Terence McEwen,
general director of the San Fran
cisco Opera, in 1980, two years
before he assumed his post. The
production, staged by Nikolaus
Lehnhoff and designed by John
Conklin, was distinguished by its
impressive sets, ambitious staging
and a notable cast of young Wag
ner singers and established stars.
The action of "The Ring" is set
in legendary time. There are
three competing powers striving
for control of the world: gods,
giants and dwarves (Nibelungs).
The gods are immortal and pow
erful but not omnipotent — they
have many human weaknesses.
The giants are strong but stupid.
The Nibelungs live in subter
ranean caverns and are expert
craftsmen.
In the first opera, "Das Rhein
gold" (The Rhine Gold), Al
berich, an ambitious Nibelung,
encounters three maidens guard
ing the Rhine gold in the river
Rhine. They tell him that
whoever bears a ring forged from

the gold may rule the world, but
the ring can only be crafted by
one who forever renounces love.
In a fit of anger, Alberich curses
love and steals the gold. He then
wields the ring and enslaves the
other Nibelungs. He intends to
use his power to rule the world.
Wotan, ruler of the gods, had
bargained with the giants to build
the castle Valhalla, from which
he too planned to rule the world.
He agreed to pay the giants with
the goddess Freia, who grows the
magic apples which make the
gods immortal. As the second
scene begins, Wotan is seen in a
dilemma. He cannot pay or the
gods will die, but he cannot break

the deal because the terms are
engraved upon his spear, tlie
source of his power. His spear
would lose its power if he broke
his promise. Counseled by the
crafty fire-spirit Loge, Wotan
convinces the giants to take Al
berich's Rhine gold in lieu of
Freia.
Wotan and Loge descend to
Alberich's cavern, cleverly steal
his treasure and return to pay off
the giants. But when Wotan
forces the ring from Alberich, Al
berich utters a curse that whoever
posesses it shall meet death and
destruction. Immediately there
after, the giant Fafner kills his
brother Fasolt in a fight over the
ring.
The central problem of "The
Ring" is now in place. Wotan
realizes that the gods are doomed
because the ring passed through
his hands. The only way to break
the curse is to return the ring to
the Rhine. However, Wotan can
not steal the ring again because
this would compound his
wrongdoing.
In the second opera, "Die
Walkure" (The Valkyrie),
Wotan's daughter Brunnhilde is
caught in a scheme of Wotan's to
regain the ring through his illegit
imate human children Siegmund
and Sieglinde. In "Siegfried,"
their son Siegfried wins the ring
for himself and wins the love of
Brunnhilde as well.
In the concluding opera
"Gotterdammerung" (Twilight of
♦he Gods), AI be rich's curse

catches up with Siegfried. Brunn
hilde, his lover, betrays him and
he is murdered by Alberich's son,
Hagen, who is trying to regain the
ring. In the final scene, Brunn
hilde reaffirms her love for the
dead hero, returns the ring to the
river and all of civilization and
Valhalla as well is consumed by
fire.
"The Ring" is so vast that it
took Wagner over 25 years to
complete. In the early 1840s, he
began to study Teutonic and
Norse mythology with the idea of
writing an opera based on that
material. By 1848, he had
finished outlining the plot.
At the time, he planned to
write a single opera, "Siegfried's
Tod" (Siegfried's Death) which
later became "Gotterdam
merung." His problem
was that the story of
Siegfried's murder required too
much background to be under
stood on its own. This back
ground would have to be inserted
in long, dull narrative passages in
which characters explained to
each other what had gone before,
for the benefit of the audience.
In 1851, he hit upon the idea of
writing "Der junge Siegfried"
(The Young Siegfried, now just
Siegfried as a prelude to fill in
the story up to the point where
"Siegfried's Tod" began. By the
time he was done writing the
script, he had decided that four
operas would be necessary to tell
the whole story.
It was also during this period
that Wagner developed his theory
of opera, which he elucidated in
several essays. Opera at the time
often consisted of a combination
of two contrasting styles. Sections
of dialogue with light musical ac
companiment developed the plot
and the drama. Distinct arias,
duets and other musical numbers
provided the musical element.
Wagner realized that he
wanted the music and the drama
in his opera to work together,
rather than alternating between
one and the other. He wanted to
unify the two styles into what is
often called "music drama"
(although Wagner called it
merely "drama").
One of the ways Wagner did
this was through the use of
"leitmotifs." These are brief mu
sical themes associated with a
particular idea or character. They
are usually introduced as solos in
the orchestra, and are then are in
terwoven and blended to produce
a complex musical texture which
conveys information to the lis
tener not contained in the script.
There are thus three levels of
meaning in a Wagner opera —
the musical, the dramatic and the
verbal.
By late 1852, Wagner had writ
ten the scripts for the entire cycle,
in the reverse of the order in
which they are performed. In the
next five years, he composed the
music up to the end of the second
act of "Siegfried," when he
stopped work on "The Ring."
Wagner did not see any way
that his project could be
produced if he did finish it. Al
ways in debt, he set aside "The
Ring" to write some operas that
could be produced more easily
and provide some income.
Revolutionary, radical, anti-
Semitic and intensely selfish,
Wagner made many enemies.
Due to his extravagant lifestyle,
he was always in debt. By 1864 he
had run out of options. He had no
money and no place to go when
18-year-old Crown Prince Lud
wig of Bavaria came to his rescue.
The prince was a passionate ad
mirer of Wagner's music. He
invited Wagner to come to his
court at Munich, reside there at

Ludwig's expense and work on
his operas. Wagner used this op
portunity to finish composing
"The Ring," which was com
pleted in 1874.
"The Ring" is without doubt
the most difficult work of opera
to produce. Wagner expanded the
traditional operatic orchestra.
This places greater demands on
the singers, who must compete
with a louder pit. Wagners vocal
parts are difficult and long. For
example, "Siegfried" lasts four
hours, with a cast of eight.
Siegfried himself is on stage for
nearly every scene, and for the
last half hour he must sing a duet
with Brunnhilde. Taking into ac
count the complexity of the
staging, there is good reason for
opera companies to avoid these
works.
General Director McEwen was
undeterred by these potential dif
ficulties. He wanted to attract
more international attention to
his company, and the best way to
do this was to attempt the ul
timate test of opera, producing a
"Ring" cycle.

He began planning it in 1980,
two years before he became gen
eral director. In 1982, he engaged
Stage Director Nikolaus
Lehnhoff. Lehnhoff was a veteran
of two other "Ring" productions,
including one directed by Richard
Wagner's grandson Weiland at
Wagner's own theater in
Bayreuth, West Germany. John
Conklin was hired to design "The
Ring." After their success in San
Francisco, Lehnhoff and Conklin
have been signed to produce a
"Ring" in Munich in 1987.
The production began in the
summer of 1983 with the perfor
mance of "Das Rheingold" and
"Die Walkure." Last summer,
"Siegfried" followed. This sum
mer, the three previous produc
tions were revived with few cast
changes, and the
"Gotterdammerung" was added.
Three complete cycles were
staged, each taking place within a
span of six days.
The production had a total
budget of $5.4 million. About

one-third of this was covered by
ticket sales. The rest had to be
raised through grants, gifts and
endowments. There is still a defi
cit.
Production of "The Ring" in
San Francisco has created intense
excitement locally and around the
world. It was sold out instantly
when tickets became available in
January, even with prices as high
as $220 for the cycle. A few
weeks before the cycle, a vigorous
market for tickets developed in
the classified sections of local
papers, with offers as high as
$400 for a set.
In order to reach a larger audi
ence, the first cycle was telecast
live across the street from the
Opera House in Louise M.
Davies Symphony Hall. Audio
and video were piped in, and En
glish subtitles were added.
A few brave opera goers lined
up hours in advance to pay $5 for
standing room tickets. These tick
ets gave them the dubious
privilege of standing through 16
hours of performance time.
Writers from as far afield as
The New York Times,
Newsweek, The New Yorker and
major European dailies were on
hand to cover "The Ring." Local
television stations flocked to
opening night to interview ticket
holders and artists.
The Grateful Dead, a rock
band based in the Bay Area,
earned a spot in San Francisco
Chronicle columnist Herb Caen's
column when they canceled two

of their own sold-out shows in or
der that band members Jerry
Garcia, Phil Lesh and Bob Weir
could attend "Ring" perfor
mances. Mayor Dianne Feinstein
offically proclaimed the month of
June "San Francisco Opera
'Ring Month."
Opera fans from throughout
the United States and the world
who were able to secure one of
the prized tickets arrived in San
Francisco for a week to see the
show. Scott Horton of the the San
Francisco Opera described "The
Ring," perhaps without exaggera
tion, as "the hottest musical ticket
in the world this year."
Before each show, the San
Francisco Opera shop was
packed. Opera goers vied to pay
$100 for porcelain "Ring plates,"
enamel boxes with "Ring" scenes
and pewter cups with opera
scenes in relief.
The production has been such a
success that McEwen has sched
uled another "Ring" for the 1990
season. Next time, there will be
four or five cycles, McEwen said.
Probably the most significant
aspects of this "Ring" were the
production and staging by
Lehnhoff and Conklin.
In the opera program Mc-
Ewen is quoted as saying, "Our
San Francisco "Ring" has been
planned as a return to roman
ticism, to color, to the kind of
majestic beauty that the music
suggests. This is not to say it will
look like something produced in
the 19th century . . . but
we have worked in the spirit of
the music and in the sense of the
words."
The costumes were for 'the
most part consistent with the

romantic/realistic thrust of the
staging. Wotan and the Valkyries
wore armor and winged helmets.
The gods wore colorful flowing
robes. Two exceptions were
Loge, who .appeared in a
19th-century business suit
carrying a newspaper, and Hagen,
who looked like a KGB agent in
his dark trenchcoat.
One of the sets that is central to
Conklin's design was not men
tioned in Wagner's original direc
tions at all. It was a terrace with a

Roman pillar at each corner and a
throne at either end. It appeared
in "Das Rheingold" almost new,
but slightly decrepit. This is due
to Lehnhoff s interpretation of
the events which took place
before the opera begins.
Each time the terrace appeared
in a later opera, it was more
decayed. By the first scene of

"Gotterdammerung," the pillars
had fallen, the thrones had
crumbled and the terrace was
covered with rubble. This il
lustrates the general theme which
runs through the cycle of the
passing of the old order with the
end of the rule of the gods.
Another element of the staging
that ran throughout the cycle was
the seasons. "Das Rheingold"
was spring; "Die Walkure," sum
mer; "Siegfried," autumn;
"Gotterdammerung," winter.

This was achieved by both setting
and lighting. In "Das Rheingold,"
green hillsides could be seen from
the terrace, and a rainbow ap
peared over Walhalla after a
thunderstorm. "Die Walkure"
was lit with predominantly bright
colors, and an evergreen ap
peared in full bloom in front of
the Valkyries' rock. "Siegfried"

was mostly brown and other
gloomy colors. Fallen leaves lit
tered the ground in the forest
scene.
was set in
a bleak winter illuminated by
harsh whites and stark grays.
Siegfried encountered the Rhine
maidens next to the ruins of a
castle, when they climbed out of a
gap in the ice which had frozen
over the surface of the Rhine.
A few of the individual scenes
were so impressive that they

deserve mention. The castle Val
halla was a massive modular com
plex with square buttresses and a
circular section on top. It was
modeled after an assortment of
real buildings. In the final scene
of "Das Rheingold," it appeared
far off on a mountaintop. After a

thunderstorm, it had moved to di
rectly behind the terrace, and it
was outlined by a rainbow. As the
music reached its majestic conclu
sion, the gods marched solemnly
up the steps to the castle, led by
Donner carrying a sword above
his head.
The head of the dragon that
Siegfried killed in Act II of
"Siegfried" was 16 feet long and
operated by a team of six with a
support crew of six more. It ap
peared high above the stage,
moving slowly like a dinosaur.
Smoke poured from its jaws.
In the final scene of
"Gotterdammerung, ,, Siegfried's
body was placed on a funeral pyre,

which was consumed by fire.
Brunnhilde leaped into the
flames, then the Rhine over
flowed onto the scene. This was
accomplished by waves of mist
billowing over the stage. As the
stage became covered in mist, the
Rhine maidens rose through it
from below. Then at the back of
the stage, which had been dark,
the sun became visible through
the clouds, illuminating Valhalla
on a distant mountain top. In the
concluding moments, Valhalla
slowly crumbled to the ground,
leaving a heap of rubble. A figure
could be seen walking amid the
wreckage. He turned toward the
audience just before the curtain
fell, and it was Loge.
The appearance of Loge in the
final scene was not scripted by
Wagner. But Lehnhoff feels that
it should have been. He has

elaborated on his interpretation
of the cycle in numerous inter
views. The opera program con
tains this remark. 44 Wagner was
trying to recreate the old German
mythology in the light of the
modern world. You could even go
one step further and say that
"The Ring' 1 represents an en
tirely realistic diagnosis of the
world in which we live today."
Along these lines, Lehnhoff has
suggested that Loge represents
Henry Kissinger; Valhalla, the
Pentagon; Alberich's gold,
uranium; Wotan, a militaristic
leader; and the Valkyries, the air
force.
In the program interview,
Lehnhoff was asked whether the
lifeless sets of "Gotter
dammerung" and the apoc
alyptic final scene represent
for him the end of the world. He

replied, "The destructive forces
of human nature become so ex
plosive in 'Gotterdammerung'
that they lead up naturally to the
final catastrophe. Mankind is
going to get devoured by the
powers of nature. The circle of
'The Ring' closes there, but has
the audience witnessed a terminal
drama, or will there be a
renewal?"
Lehnhoff argued that the end
ing "does not give you an answer
and leaves you quite purposely
alone with a question mark. At
the very end of 'Got
terdammerung,' there might
be a possible beginning, a
new Utopia or the cycle could
start all over."
So what was the reviewers re :
action to this "Ring?" I was
stunned, excited, afraid, awed
and in a few places bored. It was

visually dazzling, dramatically
captivating with a few flaws and
musically very good, but uneven.
The sets and staging were over
whelming. Conklin's design was
internally consistent and helped
to unify the complex plot. He
made ideas from the script and
the music visible, and thus easier
to grasp. The themes of decay and
decline were forcefully empha
sized by the terrace and the pass
ing seasons. Thomas Munn's im
aginative lighting was a crucial
element of the staging. Several
stage effects of intimidating diffi
culty, and a multitude of easier
ones were brought off smoothly
after a few opening night glitches.
The acting was compelling.
Peter Hoffman and Jeanine
Altmeyer as Siegmund and
Sieglinde were enthralling in the
first act of "Die Walkure." They
communicated convincingly their
growing passion, and their resent
ment of Hunding, played by the
menacing John Tomlinson.

Also especially memorable was
Thomas Stewart as The Wan
derer in "Siegfried." Stewart
projected an aura of strength and
dignity. He and Helmut Pam
puuch as Mime provided one of
the most entertaining and
amusing scenes of the entire pro
duction in Act I.
The only major weakness was
Rene Kollo as Siegfried. He sang

the part sensitively and at times
was vocally moving, but he
walked mindlessly on stage.
Edo de Waart's conducting ap
pealed to me for the most part, al
though it lacked excitement at
times. The playing of the sym
phony was acceptable; however,
the horn sections had a few bad
nights.
The singing was of thoroughly

high quality. James Morris sang a
resonant and powerful Wotan,
and Thomas Stewart followed as
a thoughtful Wanderer. Kollo
shimmered as Siegfried, and op
posite him Eva Marton emerged
as a smooth and powerful Brunn
hilde. Tomlinson as both Hun
ding and Hagen sang both roles
capably.
If you didn't get tickets or were

too busy taking final exams to at
tend "The Ring" in person, you
will have one more chance to ex
perience the majesty and power
of Wagner's music. The San Fran
cisco "Ring" will be broadcast
uncut on KKHI (95.7
FM/1550AM) on four con
secutive Saturdays commencing
July 6, at 11, 10, 10 and 9:30
a.m., respectively.
