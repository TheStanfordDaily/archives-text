# San Francisco's dazzling Ring
## 
### ROBERT BLUMEN 
This June, the San Francisco
Opera completed its most am
bitious and expensive production
ever: three complete perfor
mances of Richard Wagner's
cycle "The Ring of the
Nibelung. ,, Three years in the
making and with a budget
exceeding $5 million,"The Ring"
has aroused intense excitement
locally and focused worldwide at
tention on the company.
"The Ring" is a series of four
operas based on Norse and
Teutonic legends. The story con
cerns a power struggle for control
of the world. It is often inter
preted as an allegorical tale about

the relationship between man and
nature, creation and destruction
"The Ring" was written by
Wagner over a period of 25 years,
during which it grew from the
single opera he originally envi
sioned to the massive cycle that
he finally completed. In order to
create "The Ring,'" Wagner
found it necessary to develop and
implement a new theory of opera
which unified literary, dramatic
and musical elements.
This version of "The Ring" was
conceived by Terence McEwen,
general director of the San Fran
cisco Opera, in 1980, two years
before he assumed his post. The
production, staged by Nikolaus
Lehnhoff and designed by John
Conklin, was distinguished by its
impressive sets, ambitious staging
and a notable cast of young Wag
ner singers and established stars.
The action of "The Ring" is set
in legendary time. There are
three competing powers striving
for control of the world: gods,
giants and dwarves (Nibelungs).
The gods are immortal and pow
erful but not omnipotent — they
have many human weaknesses.
The giants are strong but stupid.
The Nibelungs live in subter
ranean caverns and are expert
craftsmen.
In the first opera, "Das Rhein
gold" (The Rhine Gold), Al
berich, an ambitious Nibelung,
encounters three maidens guard
ing the Rhine gold in the river
Rhine. They tell him that
whoever bears a ring forged from

the gold may rule the world, but
the ring can only be crafted by
one who forever renounces love.
In a fit of anger, Alberich curses
love and steals the gold. He then
wields the ring and enslaves the
other Nibelungs. He intends to
use his power to rule the world.
Wotan, ruler of the gods, had
bargained with the giants to build
the castle Valhalla, from which
he too planned to rule the world.
He agreed to pay the giants with
the goddess Freia, who grows the
magic apples which make the
gods immortal. As the second
scene begins, Wotan is seen in a
dilemma. He cannot pay or the
gods will die, but he cannot break

the deal because the terms are
engraved upon his spear, tlie
source of his power. His spear
would lose its power if he broke
his promise. Counseled by the
crafty fire-spirit Loge, Wotan
convinces the giants to take Al
berich's Rhine gold in lieu of
Freia.
Wotan and Loge descend to
Alberich's cavern, cleverly steal
his treasure and return to pay off
the giants. But when Wotan
forces the ring from Alberich, Al
berich utters a curse that whoever
posesses it shall meet death and
destruction. Immediately there
after, the giant Fafner kills his
brother Fasolt in a fight over the
ring.
The central problem of "The
Ring" is now in place. Wotan
realizes that the gods are doomed
because the ring passed through
his hands. The only way to break
the curse is to return the ring to
the Rhine. However, Wotan can
not steal the ring again because
this would compound his
wrongdoing.
In the second opera, "Die
Walkure" (The Valkyrie),
Wotan's daughter Brunnhilde is
caught in a scheme of Wotan's to
regain the ring through his illegit
imate human children Siegmund
and Sieglinde. In "Siegfried,"
their son Siegfried wins the ring
for himself and wins the love of
Brunnhilde as well.
In the concluding opera
"Gotterdammerung" (Twilight of
♦he Gods), AI be rich's curse

catches up with Siegfried. Brunn
hilde, his lover, betrays him and
he is murdered by Alberich's son,
Hagen, who is trying to regain the
ring. In the final scene, Brunn
hilde reaffirms her love for the
dead hero, returns the ring to the
river and all of civilization and
Valhalla as well is consumed by
fire.
"The Ring" is so vast that it
took Wagner over 25 years to
complete. In the early 1840s, he
began to study Teutonic and
Norse mythology with the idea of
writing an opera based on that
material. By 1848, he had
finished outlining the plot.
At the time, he planned to
write a single opera, "Siegfried's
Tod" (Siegfried's Death) which
later became "Gotterdam
merung." His problem
was that the story of
Siegfried's murder required too
much background to be under
stood on its own. This back
ground would have to be inserted
in long, dull narrative passages in
which characters explained to
each other what had gone before,
for the benefit of the audience.
In 1851, he hit upon the idea of
writing "Der junge Siegfried"
(The Young Siegfried, now just
Siegfried as a prelude to fill in
the story up to the point where
"Siegfried's Tod" began. By the
time he was done writing the
script, he had decided that four
operas would be necessary to tell
the whole story.
It was also during this period
that Wagner developed his theory
of opera, which he elucidated in
several essays. Opera at the time
often consisted of a combination
of two contrasting styles. Sections
of dialogue with light musical ac
companiment developed the plot
and the drama. Distinct arias,
duets and other musical numbers
provided the musical element.
Wagner realized that he
wanted the music and the drama
in his opera to work together,
rather than alternating between
one and the other. He wanted to
unify the two styles into what is
often called "music drama"
(although Wagner called it
merely "drama").
One of the ways Wagner did
this was through the use of
"leitmotifs." These are brief mu
sical themes associated with a
particular idea or character. They
are usually introduced as solos in
the orchestra, and are then are in
terwoven and blended to produce
a complex musical texture which
conveys information to the lis
tener not contained in the script.
There are thus three levels of
meaning in a Wagner opera —
the musical, the dramatic and the
verbal.
By late 1852, Wagner had writ
ten the scripts for the entire cycle,
in the reverse of the order in
which they are performed. In the
next five years, he composed the
music up to the end of the second
act of "Siegfried," when he
stopped work on "The Ring."
Wagner did not see any way
that his project could be
produced if he did finish it. Al
ways in debt, he set aside "The
Ring" to write some operas that
could be produced more easily
and provide some income.
Revolutionary, radical, anti-
Semitic and intensely selfish,
Wagner made many enemies.
Due to his extravagant lifestyle,
he was always in debt. By 1864 he
had run out of options. He had no
money and no place to go when
18-year-old Crown Prince Lud
wig of Bavaria came to his rescue.
The prince was a passionate ad
mirer of Wagner's music. He
invited Wagner to come to his
court at Munich, reside there at

Ludwig's expense and work on
his operas. Wagner used this op
portunity to finish composing
"The Ring," which was com
pleted in 1874.
"The Ring" is without doubt
the most difficult work of opera
to produce. Wagner expanded the
traditional operatic orchestra.
This places greater demands on
the singers, who must compete
with a louder pit. Wagners vocal
parts are difficult and long. For
example, "Siegfried" lasts four
hours, with a cast of eight.
Siegfried himself is on stage for
nearly every scene, and for the
last half hour he must sing a duet
with Brunnhilde. Taking into ac
count the complexity of the
staging, there is good reason for
opera companies to avoid these
works.
General Director McEwen was
undeterred by these potential dif
ficulties. He wanted to attract
more international attention to
his company, and the best way to
do this was to attempt the ul
timate test of opera, producing a
"Ring" cycle.

He began planning it in 1980,
two years before he became gen
eral director. In 1982, he engaged
Stage Director Nikolaus
Lehnhoff. Lehnhoff was a veteran
of two other "Ring" productions,
including one directed by Richard
Wagner's grandson Weiland at
Wagner's own theater in
Bayreuth, West Germany. John
Conklin was hired to design "The
Ring." After their success in San
Francisco, Lehnhoff and Conklin
have been signed to produce a
"Ring" in Munich in 1987.
The production began in the
summer of 1983 with the perfor
mance of "Das Rheingold" and
"Die Walkure." Last summer,
"Siegfried" followed. This sum
mer, the three previous produc
tions were revived with few cast
changes, and the
"Gotterdammerung" was added.
Three complete cycles were
staged, each taking place within a
span of six days.
The production had a total
budget of $5.4 million. About
