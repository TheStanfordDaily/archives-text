In the winter of 1974, Thomas
Albright, art critic for the San
Francisco Chronicle, delivered a
series of lectures on the evolution
of contemporary art in the Bay
Area to audiences at the San
Francisco Museum of Modern
Art. In addition to presenting
slides with commentary, he
invited Bay Area artists such as
Robert Arnesott, Joan Brown,
Wayne Theibaud and Robert Be
chtle to talk about their work and
careers.
When the lectures were con
cluded, several people suggested
that Albright gather the material
into a book. As no such survey of
the influential Bay Area art scene
had yet to find its way into print,
Albright readily acceded to this
idea. And thus began what was to
become an 11-year labor of re
search and writing. The result,
"Art in the San Francisco Bay
Area, 1945-1980: An Illustrated
History," is a comprehensive,
indeed monumental, work that
provides a detailed, definitive and
eloquent view of this region's art.
Albright remarks upon the par

ticular nature of Bay Area art in
the book's introduction: "In
keeping with the singularity of its
character and history, the San
Francisco Bay Area has
developed a distinctive and
vigorous artistic tradition. This is
not to say that Bay Area art forms
an isolated or coherent regional
'school.' San Francisco, though
often grudgingly, is part of the
United States, and the art of the
Bay Area has always been very
much an art of its time and its
place; and in any case, art is al
ways, first and foremost, the work
of individual artists. However,
drawing on the general currency
of contemporary culture at cer
tain points, and ignoring or
obstinately resisting it at others,
Bay Area artists have created a
major body of American painting
and sculpture (and photography
as well) that reflects certain
recurring attitudes."
Such attitudes — aggressive
confidence, the favoring of per
sonal vision over tradition — are
part of the legacy of Clyfford Still,
the explosive abstract expres
sionist who taught at the Califor
nia School of Fine Arts in the
years immediately following
World War 11. And it is with Still
that Albright appropriately
begins his history. "In the highly
charged atmosphere of roman
ticism and rebellion that hung in

the dark cement corridors and
claustrophobic studios of the Cal
ifornia School of Fine Arts during
the postwar years, the mood
swung between an almost religious
devotion to the idea of Art, and a
volatile, anything-goes abandon.
Students sometimes closeted
themselves all night in their
studio and spent most of the day
down the hill at Bruno's bar,
drinking wine and discussing the
prevalent topics of intellectual in
terest: existentialism, Zen, the
poetry of Dylan Thomas."
Of Still, Albright writes: "This
contradiction between absolute
freedom and absolute control was
as strong a component of Still's
personality as it was an implicit
statement in his work. In theory,
at least, Still's expression stood

for the unqualified freedom of
every artist to follow his own
path, coupled with the responsi
bility to pursue that path to its
end, to accept 'the self-discipline
necessary to the realization of his
profoundest capacity.' "
Albright follows his chapters
on the abstract expressionists
with ones on the rich, painterly
"Figurative School" of David
Park and Richard Dievenkorn;
the Beat/Funk era, when Bruce
Connor, Jess, Jay De Feo, and
George Herms created much of
their startling work; and the
photo realism of Robert Bechtle,
Richard McLean, and Jose P h
Raffael.
With a style of writing that is
both clear and jargonless,
Albright complements his

analyses of the art with shrewd
discussions of the larger ideas that
were moving society. His chapter
on 1960s Utopian art is particu
larly brilliant. "The real revolu
tion," he notes, "was the trans
formation of practically every
thing — including the notion of
revolution itself — into a mer
chandisable commodity, in the
service of an omnivorous con
sumerism. . . . Art could be ab
sorbed into the machinery of con
sumerism's crowning achieve
ment: the concept of lifestyle,
whereby people are encouraged
at once to create and consume the
ultimate consumer product, their
own personalities."
Albright knows his jazz,
politics and literature — and in
stead of getting stuck in that tired
debate between the art-as-form
and art-as-social-mover contin
gents, he gives us a picture that is
astoundedly multi-dimensional
and convincing. If it is possible to
employ the word in a wholly posi
tive sense, this is a history that
can be called "standard."
Albright, who died last year
(shortly after he completed his
book), also helped prepare the
exhibition at the Great Hall of the
Oakland Museum in which many
of the artworks discussed and
presented in the history are ap
pearing. The exhibition runs
through Aug. 18.


Sculptor Robert Arneson (above) writes that critic Thomas Albright
"managed both to carry on and make fun of a persistent theme in Bay
Area art: the creation of art as an analogue for the creation of the art
ist."
