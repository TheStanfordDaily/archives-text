## Fendick ousted from Wimbledon 
### MARK ZEIGLER Editorial staff 
Junior Patty Fendick, who played No.
1 singles at Stanford most of last season,
advanced to the third round of
Wimbledon before losing yesterday.
Two other former Stanford players suf
fered a similar fate.
Fendick, who had to wait nearly a
week to play her first match, dusted off
Melissa Brown of Scarsdale, N.Y., 6-4,
6-1 in the first round Friday, then beat
Kathleen Cummings of Richmond, Va.,
6-1, 6-3 in the second round Saturday.
Yesterday, however, she ran up
against Barbara Potter and lost 7-6, 6-
1. Also losing in the third round yester
day were Elise Burgin, who played on
Stanford's 1984 NCAA championship
women's tennis team, and Alycia Moul
ton, who played on the Cardinal's 1982
national championship squad.
Pac-10 hoopsters lose big
The Pacific 10 Conference All-Star
basketball team is probably feeling like
it has no stars after the first three out

ings of its seven-game, two-week trip to
Australia.
The Pac-10 team, coached by Stan
ford Coach Tom Davis, dropped all
three of its games against the Australian
National Team by an average of more
than 27 points. The good news,
however, is that Sunday's game, a 91-

Sports roundup

79 loss that was the closest of the three,
was the Pac-10's last against the na
tional team. The Americans now face
four different teams from the
Australian National Basketball League.
The Pac-10 appeared to have things
under control in the Thursday's opener
in Newcastle, leading 49-43 early in the
second half. But Australia suddenly
came alive and outscored the
Americans 53-20 to record a 96-69 vic
tory. California's Leonard Talyor lead
the Pac-10 with 18 points and 10
rebounds while Earl Koberlein, Stan
ford's representative on the team, had
11 points.

In game two, played in Brisbane, the
Pac-10 fared even worse, suffering a
113-80 defeat. Australia's lan Davies
lead all scorers with 31 points. For the
Pac-10, Washington State's Joe
Wallace scored a team-high 18 points,
followed by Arizona State's Steve Beck
with 16 and Koberlein with 14.
The Americans, however, lost more
than a game late in the first half when
Koberlein took an elbow in the mouth.
Koberlein was hospitalized and had two
teeth extracted before being released.
Marquess honored
Stanford Baseball Coach Mark
Marquess was named College Baseball

Stanford finished the season with a 47-
15 record and made its third trip in four
years to the College World Series.
