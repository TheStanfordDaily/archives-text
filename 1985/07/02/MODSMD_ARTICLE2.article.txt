Daily staff
The U.S. Senate last week
confirmed the nomination of
Thomas Moore, a Hoover Insti
tution senior fellow, as the
newest member of the Council
of Economic Advisors (CEA).
The CEA advises the presi
dent on economic issues,

prepares the annual Economic
Report of the President, pro
vides economic forecasts and
advises the executive office on
regulatory issues.
Moore, who was nominated
by President Reagan May 24, is
the director of the Domestic
Studies Program at Hoover. An
expert on deregulation policy
within the transportation indus
trv, Moore will assume respon

sibility for CEA recommen
dations on a variety of eco
nomic policy issues, including
transportation, banking, com
munications, welfare, health
policy, agriculture, trade and
education.
Moore will be one of two
CEA members to assist the
recently appointed chairman,
Bryl Sprinkel. Stanford
graduate student David Bizer
will serve as one of Moore's
junior staff economists, a posi
tion held by graduate students
who have completed all of their
studies except for their disserta
tion.
"I hope to bring some sense
to a lot of government pro
grams," Moore said last month
after his nomination. However,
he declined to comment further
on his aspirations for his new
job, saying, "One of the things
the council should do is not
make policy publicly."
Asked how his appointment
affects the University's reputa
tion, Moore said it is "another
sign of having good scholars
who are actually doing policy
work."
As overseer of Hoover's
Domestic Studies Program
since its inception in 1974,
Moore assisted in the program's
growth and development. Cur
rently there are four Nobel
Prize winners in economics con
nected with the program, as well
as 13 fellows of the American

Academy of Arts and Sciences
and eight members of the Na
tional Academy of Sciences.
"The council will greatly
benefit from the expertise of
Thomas Moore," said W. Glenn
Campbell, director of the
Hoover Institution. tk His schol
arship on specific micro
economic issues is widely
recognized and reflects the
depth of his research on public
policy issues."
Moore was a senior staff
economist on the CEA for
presidents Lyndon Johnson and
Richard Nixon. He was for
merly on the economics faculty
at both Carnegie Institute of
Technology and Michigan State
University. As a lecturer at
UCLA and at the Stanford
Graduate School of Business,
he taught price theory and
courses on government regula
tion.
Moore earned a doctorate in
economics and a master's from
the University of Chicago. He
also holds a bachelor's degree in
economics from George Wash
ington University.
Moore is the author of
numerous books and journal ar
ticles on the regulation of en
ergy, transportation and the en
vironment. His latest mono
graph, which is scheduled for
publication in 1986, concerns
the impact of airline deregula
tion on passengers, capital and
labor
