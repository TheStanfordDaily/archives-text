# Jury says guilty
## Bursar's Office protesters 
### ERIK McDERMOTT 
PALO ALTO — After
deliberating for about an hour, a
jury yesterday found nine Stan
ford students guilty of trespassing
and refusing to disperse —
charges stemming from their May
28 sit-in at the Bursars Office in
Old Union.
Judge Franklin Elia gave the
students the option of probation
for a period of three months, after
which time their records would be
cleared if they broke no laws.
David Romo, David Magnus,
Mario Huerta, Jennifer G. Grant,
William Northway and Michael
Tarpey all elected to be put on
probation, while Joseph Mosnier
and Caroline Paul declined the
option.
The latter two may petition to
have their records cleared after
one year.
The ninth protester, Todd
Ramming, agreed earlier to plead
no contest to the trespassing
charge. In exchange for the plea,
prosecutors dropped Ramming's
failure to disperse charge. He was
put on probation for one year,
and then his record will automati
cally be cleared.
The students were also given
jail sentences that were waived
for time already served in jail.
In arguing the case, all the at
torneys referred to the 1969
People vs. Medrano case. The
jury's instructions in that case
were that a trespass had not oc
curred if (a) the persons involved
acted in an otherwise lawful man
ner, (b) the private property in
question assumed the functional
attributes of public property, (c)

the persons were there to com
municate thoughts and ideas
relating to that property and (d)
there were no reasonable alterna
tive means of communicating
these thoughts or ideas.
In his defense, Steve Nakano,
the attorney representing five of
the arrested students, emphasized
the right to free speech
guaranteed by the First Amend
ment. "Included in that right," he
said, "is the right to symbolic
speech."
In addition, Nakano claimed
that the students' assembly was
not unlawful. If an assembly is not
unlawful, one is not guilty of
trespassing or failing to disperse.
Nakano referred to California
Penal Code 407, which specifies
that an assembly is unlawful
"whenever two or more persons
assemble ... to do an unlawful
act, or to do a lawful act in a viol
ent, boisterous or tumultuous
manner," and asked the jury to
focus on the question of intent,
claiming, "The prosecutor has not
produced any evidence that the
students intended to trespass."
He pointed to the testimony of
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer as evidence that the
students were not "violent, bois
terous or tumultuous."
Again following the structure
of the Medrano principles,
Nakano said the Bursar's Office
assumed the functional attributes
of public property, as it was open
to the general public.
He then tried to establish the
link between the Bursar's Office
and the students' pro-divestment
message. "The Bursar's Office is
the financial heart of the Univer
sity," he said. "The silent protest
and red ribbons and black
armbands relate to the Bursar's
Office."
As to the question of alterna
tive channels of communication,
Nakano pointed to the students'
"monumental efforts" for divest
ment. Nakano took the Univer
sity's failure to respond to
indicate that the protesters'
message had not been commun
icated successfully, saying,
"Communication requires two
parties — one who speaks, by
symbols, and one who listens."
David Romo, undertaking his
own defense, took a more
ideological stand, saying, "It is in
consistent for a university
founded on humanitarian
grounds to fund our education on
the system of apartheid. . . . We
were not there to commit a crime
but to prevent it. . . ."
Prosecuting attorney John
Schon proceeded to rebut most of
the defendants' arguments. He
claimed that there was no doubt
as to the students' "intent of

remaining on the property," also
saying, "the outer doors of the
Bursar's Office were closed after
4 p.m., the Bursar's Office was
not open to the general public."
Schon granted that the protesters'
message may have related to the
Bursar's Office symbolically, but
said, "There are many other
reasonable means" of communi
cation open to the students.
The jury spent little more than
an hour in reaching the verdict.
Each of the four convicted men
on hand made a closing statement
emphasizing his strong conviction
that the students had acted out of
moral necessity in light of the
moral necessity of divestiture.
Judge Elia expressed sympathy
with the protesters, saying, "I
think that I understand where
you're coming from. As far as
apartheid is concerned, I don't
think any decent civilized human
being can disagree with your arg
uments." However, he added,
"The law is very clear on the sub
ject of trespassing."
Asked if he was upset about the
decision, Mosnier responded,
"I'm not upset about the decision
per se. It's difficult for a legal sys
tem so narrowly defined to con
sider moral issues. . . . The im
mediate, practical value has been
educating a jury."
