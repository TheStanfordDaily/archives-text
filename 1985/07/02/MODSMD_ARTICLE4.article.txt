## Reagan and Carter vs. terrorism 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan undoubtedly
will be viewed by many as a hero of his first hostage
crisis, whereas Jimmy Carter still wears the scars of his
long and bitter struggle to free American captives from
Iran.
But had Jimmy Carter been president when TWA
Flight 847 was seized by hijackers last month, would the
outcome of the Beirut hostage crisis have been differ
ent?

News analysis

The apparent similarities of the two events more than
five years apart invite comparison, but the situations the
two presidents faced were quite different.
Neither was without cost.
Navy frogman Robert Stethem was murdered by the
airplane hijackers 16 hours after they seized the plane.
During that period the Reagan Administration was in
diplomatic contact with Lebanon, Algeria, Syria and
Cyprus trying unsuccessfully to steer the plane away
from Beirut.
It is unclear, however, whether U.S. actions were a
factor in slowing the arrival of the Amal militia, a delay
which the White House now says may have prompted
the hijackers to shoot Stethem.
And as the TWA hostage crisis drew to a close, seven
Americans kidnapped in Beirut over the last year were
still being held.
All 52 American hostages seized by Iran when the
U.S. Embassy in Tehran was overrun in November 1979
returned home safely more than a year later, but eight
members of an elite military team were killed in a colli
sion on a remote desert airfield in an abortive rescue at
tempt Carter ordered.
Neither the hijackers who demanded the release of
Shiite Moslem prisoners held by Israel nor the Iranians
who insisted the United States return the deposed Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi gained their stated objective
by holding the Americans hostage.
Carter said he secretly warned Iranian leaders shortly
after the embassy takeover that he would take direct

immune for months to diplomatic approaches by would
be intermediaries.
After the first day of the recent crisis, most of the
TWA hostages fell under the control of Shiite leader
Nabih Berri's militia, and Berri himself became a key
player in the drama three days after the hijacking. Most
of the 151 innocent passengers and crew were freed in
those first three days, and Berri released others for
health reasons later.
Although there remains some question about the role
Berri played — whether as a participant, conspirator,
representative or leader of the Americans' captors — he
provided a focus for U.S. diplomatic efforts and was in
contact with Reagan s national security adviser as well as
U.S. allies and neutral governments.
Syria, a powerful neighbor of Lebanon and a key
player in the struggle for power within the strife-torn
country, proved particularly influential in dealing with
Berri.
Carter also enlisted other governments' help, but
Khomeini rebuffed their diplomatic approaches.
White House officials believe Berri decided after
three or four days it was no longer in his interest to hold
the Americans. It took at least 10 months for the
Iranians to reach that same conclusion and several
months more to arrange for the Americans' release.
To gain the Americans' freedom, Carter agreed to
release more than $4 billion in Iranian funds he had or
dered frozen in U.S. banks as part of his effort to pres
sure the Tehran government to release its hostages. The
total was between one-third and one-sixth of the amount
the Iranians had demanded.
The government also issued a public statement pledg
ing to "refrain from interfering, either directly or in
directly, politically or militarily, in the internal affairs of
Iran."
On Saturday, after plans for the release of the TWA
hostages stalled over a demand for a U.S. statement of
"non-belligerency," the Reagan Administration issued a
statement reaffirming "its longstanding support for the
preservation of Lebanon, its government, its stability
and its security, and for the mitigation of the suffering of
its people."


military action against Iran if any of the hostages were
killed.
Although factional strife and the growth of private
armies has rendered the Lebanese government largely
impotent, it did not actively aid the hijackers. On the
other hand, the Iranian revolutionary government of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini openly threw its support
to the students who seized the embassy five years ago.
The hostages in Iran became the prisoners of an out
law government, isolated from most of the world and
