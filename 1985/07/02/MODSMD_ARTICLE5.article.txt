Gromyko named Soviet president
MOSCOW — Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko was elected
Soviet president yesterday at a session of the national Parlia
ment, and Eduard Shevardnadze named to replace him in the
post the 75-year-old Gromyko has held since 1957.
The election of Gromyko as president is a major departure
from the recent Kremlin practice of having the party leader also
hold the title of chief of state.
Party leader Mikhail Gorbachev, 54, nominated Gromyko at
yesterday's Parliament session, which capped two days of major
leadership changes including the ouster of one-time power con
tender Grigory Romanov from the ruling Politburo.
The Soviet news agency Tass announced that the 62-year-old
Romanov was retired on "health grounds'' at a meeting of the
party's Central Committee. Shevardnadze, party leader of Geor
gia and a Gorbachev ally, was promoted to a full member of the
ruling Politburo at the meeting.
The Kremlin shakeup was seen as another step by Gorbachev
to solidify his power following his rise to leadership of the party
in March.
Romanov's departure had been rumored for weeks. There
were reports he was in poor health and that he was in political
trouble because he opposed Gorbachev's selection as party
leader. At the time, Romanov had been considered a contender
for the post.
The Tass announcement did not include the customary expres
sion of thanks for Romanov's past service — an indication that he
is in disfavor. He had been absent from several important party
meetings recently and not seen in public since Victory Day
celebrations May 9 on Red Square.
Explosion rips Rome airport
ROME — An explosion ripped through the baggage area at
Rome's Leonardo da Vinci Airport last night, injuring 12 people,
police said.
The blast destroyed a 100-square-yard area, sending scores of
travelers fleeing in panic, witnesses said.
An airport police official who spoke on condition he not be
identified said three of the injured, all of them airport workers,
were hospitalized. Nine other people were treated for shock or
minor injuries at the scene.
Police looked through the masses of twisted wreckage, strewn
with pieces of luggage and broken glass, according to an AP pho
tographer at the scenerThe area was cordoned off immediately
after the explosion.
Italian news agencies quoted police as saying the explosion ap
peared to have originated in a suitcase. However, it was not im
mediately clear whether the bag had arrived or was destined for
an outbound plane.
Police did not say whether they thought a bomb had caused the
blast.
The police official said the blast occurred in an area run by
Alitalia, the Italian airline, through which passes incoming and
outgoing luggage from Alitalia and other airlines.
At the time of the explosion, the area was handling inbound
baggage from Lagos, Nigeria and Athens, Greece, and outgoing
luggage to New Delhi, India and Madrid, Spain, officials said.
The Rev. Franco Serfustini, the airport chaplain, said the blast
occurred in an area where baggage is collected for an Alitalia
flight to India.
Israel to free 300 Lebanese
JERUSALEM — Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said yester
day that Israel would free more than 300 of its Lebanese
prisoners within 48 hours, but that the decision was not related to
the release by Shiite Moslems of 39 Americans.
The prisoners are among 735 Lebanese, most of them Shiites,
whose release was demanded by Shiite terrorists who hijacked a
TWA jetliner June 14. The last 39 American passengers were
freed Sunday and now are in Wiesbaden, West Germany.
Israel captured the Lebanese during its withdrawal from south
Lebanon, accusing them of plotting or carrying out attacks on Is
raeli units. It freed 31 of them June 24.
Rabin said Israel had planned to release the group on June 5,
but the plans were delayed first by the kidnapping of 21 Finnish
U.N. soldiers by the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia,
then by the hijacking.
The defense minister said no timetable was set for the release
of the remaining Lebanese.
Bomb guts Americans' cars
ATHENS, Greece — A bomb exploded yesterday under an
American's car outside a hotel in which U.S. military officers are
housed, starting a fire that engulfed five vehicles, officials re
ported.
A police spokesman said a homemade device, "probably a
kind of Molotov cocktail (gasoline bomb),"' exploded beneath a
vehicle left in a public parking lot outside the Apollon Palace
Hotel in the seaside Athens suburb of Kavouri.
No organization claimed responsibility for the blast, which
started a fire that gutted three cars and seriously damaged two.
"Three of the vehicles belonged to Americans associated with
the military. It seems one of the cars involved was carrying four
tanks of propane gas. They went up in flames,, and the fire
spread." a U.S. military spokesman said.

Lebanon, accusing them of plotting or carrying out attacks on Is
raeli units. It freed 31 of them June 24.
Rabin said Israel had planned to release the group on June 5,
but the plans were delayed first by the kidnapping of 21 Finnish
U.N. soldiers by the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia,
then by the hijacking.
The defense minister said no timetable was set for the release
of the remaining Lebanese.
Bomb guts Americans' cars
ATHENS, Greece — A bomb exploded yesterday under an
American's car outside a hotel in which U.S. military officers are
housed, starting a fire that engulfed five vehicles, officials re
ported.
A police spokesman said a homemade device, "probably a
kind of Molotov cocktail (gasoline bomb),"' exploded beneath a
vehicle left in a public parking lot outside the Apollon Palace
Hotel in the seaside Athens suburb of Kavouri.
No organization claimed responsibility for the blast, which
started a fire that gutted three cars and seriously damaged two.
"Three of the vehicles belonged to Americans associated with
the military. It seems one of the cars involved was carrying four
tanks of propane gas. They went up in flames,, and the fire
spread." a U.S. military spokesman said.
