U.S. takes anti-hijack steps
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administra
tion hinted yesterday that the United States will
strike against terrorist training camps or support
bases in the Middle East, saying the Beirut
hostage crisis had created widespread support in
America "for more firmness in dealing with ter
rorism."
Meanwhile, the United States initiated "legal
action and diplomatic steps" to close the Beirut
airport to international travel, declaring the goal
was to put it "off-limits" to terrorists.
A senior State Department official said all
American passenger and cargo service to the
Lebanese capital will be halted and other govern
ments. including the Soviet Union, will be urged
to follow suit.
Relatives of seven kidnapped Americans still
held in Lebanon said yesterday they felt let down
because the kidnap victims had not been freed

along with the TWA hostages and were afraid
that talk of U.S. retaliation could bring harm to
the captives.
Court cuts parochial aid
WASHINGTON — Public school teachers
may not conduct classes in religiously affiliated
schools, the Supreme Court ruled yesterday as it
upheld strict standards for separation of church
and state.
By a bare 5-4 majority, the court dealt a major
setback to the Reagan Administration and other
advocates of expanded government support of
parochial education.
The court appeared to invalidate nationwide
the use of a federal program known as Title I to
finance education for underprivileged parochial
schoolchildren. Most of the program's $3 billion
annual budget, however, is used for public
schools and is not affected by the ruling.
