Data General hinders trade
WASHINGTON — A California company
found guilty of antitrust violations for requiring
customers to buy its computers when they pur
chased the firm's computer program
system has lost a Supreme Court appeal.
The court, over two dissenting votes, let stand
yesterday a ruling against Data General Corp.,
which was sued by Digidyne Corp. and Fairchild
Camera and Instrument Corp.
Data General was sued for refusing to sell its
NOVA operating system software unless buyers
also bought NOVA computers. A California jury
determined that Data General violated antitrust
laws by imposing the "tying" arrangement on its
customers. A federal judge, however, threw out
the verdict on grounds that the company lacked
the economic power to restrain competition.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals noted
last year that Data General's program operating
system was regarded by some witnesses at the
trial as "the best in the industry," and suggested
that the product's popularity proved that Data
General had the economic power to restrain
competition.

State combats multiple fires
SAN DIEGO — Arson was blamed yesterday
for the worst residential fire in city history, a fast
moving blaze that destroyed 63 homes and left as
many as 150 people homeless in an upper-middle
class neighborhood.
Damage from the 300-acre firestorm Sunday
was estimated at more than $6 million, but offi
cials said they wont be able give a firm figure un
til the end of the week, after a damage survey is
completed.
While Normal Heights residents picked
through the charred remains of their homes in
hopes of salvaging personal belongings,
firefighters in California and Arizona braved
searing temperatures and shifting winds as they
battled seven brush fires that had blackened
nearly 4 1,000 acres.
Hedgecock declared a city emergency Sunday
but said state emergency status, asked of Gov.
George Deukmejian, would do nothing to help
people left homeless by the fire. A state declara
tion would only provide money to repair or
replace city buildings destroyed, but no city
structures were known to have been damaged.
