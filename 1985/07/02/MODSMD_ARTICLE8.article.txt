## The
						Stanford Daily Coffee House beyond ASSU 
### 
Saga Corporation recently won a five-year contract with
Tresidder Union to operate the Coffee House, and the
ASSU is bitterly complaining that the takeover is inappro
priate and unjust.
The Coffee House should be student run, says the
ASSU. Student opinion has also run against Saga.
But these dissatisfied students, who protest the end of
student management and possible changes in the makeup
of the Coffee House, are misinformed. We agree that stu
dent management opportunities are valuable, but Tresid
der accepted the Saga bid in part because the corporation
promised continued student involvement at all levels of
decision making. The corporation intends to involve stu
dents "in a managerial as well as a peripheral role," ac
cording to a Saga spokesman.
And far from being transformed into a "pink-and-green
vinyl Sambo's pancake palace," as the Coffee House's
former president put it, Saga seems to realize that it is bet
ter business to retain the present atmosphere. A spokes
man for Saga has said, "We want to preserve the atmos
phere (of the Coffee House) as much as the students do."
To prevent any radical changes, Tresidder will still have
final say over any proposed changes â€” just as it does now.
Finally, the time is past for ASSU complaints about non
student owners. If the ASSU believed that management by
any group other than itself was wrong in principle, it should
have protested the competitive bidding process from the
beginning. Instead, the ASSU submitted a bid along with
every other company vying for management and only
protested after losing.
Saga Corporation deserves a chance to run the Coffee
House. The corporation has promised to involve students
in significant roles and to retain the present atmosphere of
the Coffee House. Students and the ASSU should channel
their energies toward making sure Saga upholds these
promises rather than instigating fruitless protests or
drawing unrealistic plans about creating an "alternative"
Coffee House.
