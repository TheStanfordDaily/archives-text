## Visiting scholar says hunted Nazi is alive in Syria 
### MARSH McCALL Editorial staff 
A visiting scholar at Stanford
has brought to light the existence
of a man believed to be the most
notorious Nazi war criminal still
alive.
Mary Felstiner, currently at
Stanford's Center for Research
on Women, has charged that
Alois Brunner, believed to be re
sponsible for the deportation of
125,000 people to death camps, is
alive and under government
protection in Syria.
Felstiner was in France con
ducting research on the immigra
tion of women refugees from
Germany when she came across
Brunner's name in historical ar
chives.
"I thought he was local Ges
tapo at first," said Felstiner. "But
I discovered he'd been posted all
over Europe." Felstiner found
that Adolf Eichmann had sent
Brunner to Austria, Greece and
France to supervise the roundup
of Jews.
"Then I learned he's still
alive," she said.
With the publicity over the
death of Josef Mengele, the
Auschwitz "Angel of Death,"
Brunner, 73, has moved to the
top of the list of wanted Nazi war
criminals. Recently, several
countries, including Austria and
West Germany, have tried to ex
tradite Brunner from Svria and
failed.

Some reports allege that Brun
ner has been under the employ of
the Syrian government. Felstiner
acknowledged a report that Brun
ner was contracted by the Syrians
to test torture equipment but
said she could not verify it."He is
under protection for some reason,
though," she said. "They know
he's wanted."
Felstiner insisted that "Alois
Brunner can't be allowed to
remain obscure. He can't be
allowed to lead a perfectly ordi
nary life. As a historian, bringing
him into the public eye is my con
tribution."
With Brunner's existence
publicized, Felstiner said, special
groups like the Simon Wiesenthal
Organization might put pressure
on the various governments to ex
tradite Brunner.
Brunner was responsible for
sending to death camps some
48,000 Jews from Austria,
43,000 from Greece and 23,000
from France. He joined the Nazi
party at 19 and the SS in 1938.
At his own request, he was
transferred to the Central Office
for Jewish emigration in Vienna.
There he set the prototype for the
deportations that were to follow.
He eventually became the most
successful Jewish deportation ex
pert. Eichmann called him "one
of my best men."
There is no chance that Brun
