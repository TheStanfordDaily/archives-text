## The
						Stanford Daily Adopt Berkeley model for Frost 
### 
"Thank you for calling the Grateful Dead hotline num
ber," said the recorded voice on the other end of the
phone. "This is a new message as of July 2. We are sorry to
inform you that the scheduled concerts at the Frost Ampit
heatre in Stanford, California, on July 27 and 28 have been
canceled due to changes at Stanford University. We are
very sorry for this inconvenience."
We are sorry too.
It is fine for the University to say that organizers from
the ASSU Concert Network were overzealous. The concert
network may also be correct in saying that Bill Graham
Presents moved too quickly in putting the concerts on the
Dead's hotline. But the bottom line is, Stanford will not
have a major concert at Frost Ampitheatre this summer.
That's a mistake.
A mistake because Frost Ampitheatre is a great place for
concerts: The acoustics are good, the grass is soft, and the
weather is nice. It is large enough that 9,500 tickets were
sold for each of the two Grateful Dead concerts held there
in mid-April. The University is simply not aggressive
enough in using this facility.
UC-Berkeley's Greek Theater provides a model for how
Frost might be better used. While Frost is being used this
summer for a few scattered concerts and for business exec
utives' picnics, the Greek Theater will host REM, ÜB4O,
Jimmy Buffett and A 1 Jarreau, among others. Judging by
past experience, this should result in "hundreds of
thousands of dollars" profit for the school, according to
David Dial of Cal Performances.
While not all would agree that this type of programming
has significant cultural benefit, Cal Performances, the uni
versity department charged with operating the Greek, will
use the profits to fund productions by dance theaters,
chamber orchestras, ballets and the like. Very few should
go unsatisfied with that broad spectrum of entertainment.
We hestitate to say it aloud, but Stanford should follow
Berkeley's example. Opening up Frost to more concerts
and other events holds potential benefit not only for stu
dent fans of popular music, but for the entire campus com
munity. The Grateful Dead, a guaranteed sellout in the
Bay Area, could have helped to open the gates of Frost
much wider — gates that remain mainly closed for now.
