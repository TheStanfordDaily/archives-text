## ASSU editorial vacuous 
### 
It is difficult to debate a void,
but I will attempt to do just that
in rebutting The Daily's editorial
of July 2, "Coffee House beyond
ASSU."
I say void because nowhere do
the editors of The Daily tell me
why the Coffee House is beyond
the ASSU. Though I carefully

failed to find a single reason why
the editors wrote that "Saga Cor
poration deserves a chance to run
the Coffee House." Perhaps the
layout folks were short on space
and cut out the regular section of
editorials which contained the
reasoned arguments upon which
intelligent opinions rest. I just
don't know. But as a Coffee
House worker and supporter I
feel I should rebut nonetheless.
Though the editorial lacks
reasoning, it is not short on
names. It calls the students who
support continued ASSU owner
ship of the Coffee House
"dissatisfied", "misinformed"
and "unrealistic." I plead guilty
to the first account. I am terribly
dissatisfied with a university that
refuses to allow its students to run
their own Coffee House and with
a student newspaper that sides
with the conglomerate.
The other two appellations
belong to The Daily. They, and
not we, are misinformed. They,
and not we, are naive. They quote
the former president of the Cof
fee House as saying that Saga
would turn the Coffee House into
a "pink-and-green vinyl Sambo's
pancake palace." We, looking at
our March 1985 Dailys (look up
the exact date yourselves) quote
the former Coffee House chair of
the board as saying "I couldn't
say that it would immediately

turn into a pink-and-green
Sambo's pancake palace, but the
fact is that now students know
they own the Coffee House, and
the philosophy of the Coffee
House is based on that." Before
The Daily calls others misin
formed, they should learn to
quote themselves correctly.
And that former chair of the
Coffee House board was being
quite realistic when he recognized
that the only way students can
retain control over the atmos
phere and management of the
Coffee House is to own the Cof
fee House. He was well informed

House.

of Tresidder's plans to remodel
the Coffee House along the lines
of Chili's in Menlo Park. He was
well-informed that the thing
Tresidder liked least about the
Coffee House was the students
who used the Coffee House as a
meeting and work place. He knew
quite well that the Coffee House
was the closest thing this univer
sity had to a student union and
that Tresidder wants to be not a
student, but a "memorial" union.
The Daily says that Saga should
be put in charge of the Coffee
House and Tresidder in charge of
Saga and the ASSU should keep
an eye over both. That is like
sending the fox to guard the
sheep and then telling the shep
herd "Don't worry. It's all right.
You just keep an eye on the fox
and your sheep will live forever."
And speaking of naivete, has The

Daily forgotten those
"unrealistic" students whose
boycott started the Coffee House
five years ago?
While we are still discussing
names let me throw in one of my
own — spongey. The Daily is act
ing like a sponge when it shame
lessly soaks up Saga's promise to
provide student involvement in
the Coffee House. Have the stu
dents provided anything less? Let
the point be made clear.
Whatever involvement Saga plans
for the student will be less than
the students presently give them
selves. No amount of involve
ment, however nonperipheral, is
equal to ownership. Imagine the
editorial which would appear if
Rupert Murdoch were to buy The
Daily and promise to involve stu
dents "in a managerial as well as
peripheral role."
Saga can give Tresidder more
money, more professional mar
keting practices and fewer stu
dents who are willing to gripe
when they feel the University is
pursuing unfair practices. Other
wise there is nothing Saga can of
fer the students that they cannot
offer themselves. Therefore we
will open a new student coffee
house, for while we lack the re
sources of a Tresidder and a Saga
we have something greater — a
desire for our own place on
campus, where students, not ad
ministrators or corporations,
decide what is good for them
selves. And in this coffee house
will be a wall. And on that wall
will be every article and editorial
The Daily has printed misinform
ing the Stanford community
about the Coffee House. And the
students will sit at their tables,
drink their coffee and read
Campus Report.
