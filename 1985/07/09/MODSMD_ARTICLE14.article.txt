## "Star Wars" myths exploded 
### 
(This is the second of a three-part
series of viewpoints dealing with
the Reagan administration's Stra
tegic Defense Initiative.)

VIEWPOINT

Myth number two: The Strate
gic Defense Initiative will mean
fewer, not more, nuclear weapons
and will render nuclear weapons
obsolete.
The development of "Star
Wars," for all the above reasons
and more, will actually boost pro
duction of ever-new, ever-more
(unpredictable) nuclear arms. At
the recent Gottingen Conference
uniting scholars from the United
States, Soviet Union and else
where, Irakli Gverdtsiteli of the
Georgian Academy of Sciences in
the Soviet Union estimated that
countermeasures to the SDI will
actually be 50 to 100 times less
expensive than SDI itself. Others
have figured that a build-up in of
fensive arms as a response to the
U.S. space shield would amount
to only about 2 percent of the
outlays proposed for "Star
Wars."
These calculations do not even
take into account the enormous
maintenance and updating costs
that the system will require. Nor
do they consider the fact that
ICBM production and the es
tablishment of ABM systems by
the Soviets are likely to be ac
celerated as a result of "Star
Wars." At any rate, if the Ameri

can strategists really believe the
above assertion, then why do they
continue to advocate the
manufacture and deployment of
offensive nuclear arms?
Myth number three: SDI will be
an effective shield for NATO and
will strengthen NATO's ability to
deter a conventional attack on
Western Europe.
Such allegations, recently made
by Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger and published in the
Daily Bulletin of the U.S. Mission
in Geneva on April 11, run
counter to military and scientific
views that a ballistic missile
defense in space would not be ef
fective against "over-the
horizon" cruise missiles,
battlefield or bomber weapons.
The propogation of myths such
as this one seem designed to as
suage European fears that "Star
Wars" would decouple the strate
gic destinies of the United States
and its NATO allies. Given
recent ambivalence on the part of
U.S. allies about the worthiness
and feasibility of the SDI, as well
as their suspicions that the Pent
agon wishes to distribute the eco
nomic burden of "Star Wars"
among its partners, official claims
such as the above seem aimed at
selling participation in the space
program to Western European
powers.
