## Coffee House hindered by Tresidder 
### 
After having read the editorial in the
July 2 edition of The Daily, and now that
the Coffee House will be officially turned
over to the Saga Corporation on Sept. 1,1,
as the current manager of the Coffee
House, need to take the responsibility and
"inform" you and perhaps some other
members of the Stanford community of
some facts that never seem to have come to
light during this entire, poorly-run process

VIEWPOINT

of bidding and the selection of a new con
tractor for the food services in Tresidder
Memorial Union. First, some historical
facts over the past five years.
1. The Coffee House has paid rent to
Tresidder as a percentage of net sales. That
percentage is almost double what the other
current contractor pays Tresidder. Due to
the inexperience of students preparing the
first bid, these students honestly believed
that by giving Tresidder 12.5 percent of
their net sales, they could still maintain
profitability and maintain low prices and
good, fair student wages.
As evidenced over the course of the first
two-and-one-half years of the contract, the
financial hardships of bearing this exorbi
tant rent figure and some mistakes by the
management staff have caused the Coffee
House, Inc. to become indebted to the
ASSU, the student employees to be paid
almost minimum wage, and the present
management to retain a pricing structure
that is higher than desired so that the CHI
may remain financially solvent and pay as
many of its obligations to creditors as pos
sible.
You might state that all this is not
Tresidder's fault and in fact favors the
argument that one of the reasons that
Tresidder did not award the contract to the
Coffee House is this lack of "management
depth and experience." I must state that

Tresidder, in all its desire to make the al
mighty buck and keep in the good graces of
the University budgetary process, gladly
took the CHI s hard-earned money from
the "inexperienced" students, knowing full
well that the rent percentage was quite a
bit out of line.
2. Another "concern" of Tresidder's is
sales and customer counts, which again
translates into "more money" for the
Tresidder coffers, which for some reason
each year seem to get drier and drier even
to the point of running a deficit for at least
the last two years. Over the last two years,
the CHI has doubled the sales at the Cof
fee House as compared to the last contrac
tor.
When the CHI took over the operation
of the Coffee House it was not a popular
place to hang out, let alone eat. The stu
dents have worked very hard to make the
Coffee House something special. Of course
Saga is not going to change anything about
the Coffee House. Why should they?
When someone has worked hard and long
to make an establishment a popular, fun
and relaxing place in which to enjoy
socializing and dining, do you think some
one else given that same operation is going
to come in and redo the place? Do you
think that Tresidder, which has seen its
sales in the Coffee House double and let
the students of CHI work their butts off to
make the Coffee House into the cleanest,
highest-quality operation in their building,
will change these qualities and in turn lost
rent money flowing in from that operation?
In a way, the answer to that last question
is yes. Tresidder believes that anyone can
run the Coffee House and provide food
and a nice, pleasant place to eat. I do not
doubt that for one minute. But what
Tresidder does not seem to realize is the
fact that the students own and operate the
Coffee House. Therefore that one factor,
that one unique characteristic makes the

Coffee House what it is today and
definitely will make it change after Sept. 1.
Saga has agreed to work with the stu
dents to retain student involvement and
that is commendable. However, I don't
think they realize, as Tresidder does not,
the difference between student control of
management and Coffee House opera
tions, and student involvement in that op
eration, but with final say and decision
being made by the contractor. I do not
believe that Saga is going to let a student
president or a board of directors made up
of a majority of students tell Saga's
manager what to do and/or have the power
to fire that manager.
I do work under these conditions, for I
report to the Coffee House president (a
student) and am hired/fired by a board of
directors comprised mostly of students. I
do not have the freedom to do as I please
as manager of the Coffee House, but must
consult and jointly make decisions with the
student management staff of the Coffee
House. The Saga manager's job is to report
to Saga headquarters and follow Saga
policies and dictates. That is one big differ
ence between the two entities. Saga has the
contract now signed with Tresidder and the
Coffee House is theirs to run as they wish,
along of course with Tresidder overseeing
the operation and approving or disapprov
ing of changes, etc.
Tresidder's main concern is money.
They have a hard time meeting their
budget. They rely heavily on income
producing areas of the building, most of
which they themselves do not operate (for
reasons that I cannot fathom), to maintain
steady growth in the non-revenue parts of
the building. They believe that a large cor
poration will practically guarantee this
continued growth so they in turn can stop
having to worry about climbing costs of
overhead and about their salaries, benefits
and working conditions.

Tresidder also has a hard time in
working and interacting with students.
There seems to be a self-serving attitude
among certain elements of Tresidder. They
feel they need to get the job done with as
little student involvement as possible, and
when the need arises for such involvement,
they hand-select students they know and
often have influence upon to help make
decisions beneficial to Tresidder. Their
contrite explanation of TMU not being a
student union but a community union is
most self-serving. I don't think the city of
Palo Alto or the county of Santa Clara
could operate a community union with all
the administrators and staff of Tresidder if
there were not one Stanford student
around. This institution is here because of
the students. I would not be working here,
The Daily would not be published, and
TMU would be an office complex for
Hewlett-Packard if Stanford students were
not here.
I have enjoyed working at the Coffee
House. Despite many frustrations working
with students, staff and Tresidder adminis
trators, I, along with the hard-working stu
dents and full-time staff, have established
the CHI on sound financial ground, and it
is operating well. We can improve in some
areas and had plans to do so. 1 have said
this many times to different people. I have
worked at the University of the Pacific, at
UC-Berkeley and now at Stanford. I must
say my experience tells me that the stu
dents here are the most hard-working, in
quisitive and motivated group of people
with whom I have had the pleasure of
working.
The customers of the Coffee House have
shown their concern and support for the
Coffee House, Inc. and will continue to do
so. It is about time Tresidder did the same.

one else given that same operation is going
to come in and redo the place? Do you
think that Tresidder, which has seen its
sales in the Coffee House double and let
the students of CHI work their butts off to
make the Coffee House into the cleanest,
highest-quality operation in their building,
will change these qualities and in turn lost
rent money flowing in from that operation?
In a way, the answer to that last question
is yes. Tresidder believes that anyone can
run the Coffee House and provide food
and a nice, pleasant place to eat. I do not
doubt that for one minute. But what
Tresidder does not seem to realize is the
fact that the students own and operate the
Coffee House. Therefore that one factor,
that one unique characteristic makes the

Coffee House what it is today and
definitely will make it change after Sept. 1.
Saga has agreed to work with the stu
dents to retain student involvement and
that is commendable. However, I don't
think they realize, as Tresidder does not,
the difference between student control of
management and Coffee House opera
tions, and student involvement in that op
eration, but with final say and decision
being made by the contractor. I do not
believe that Saga is going to let a student
president or a board of directors made up
of a majority of students tell Saga's
manager what to do and/or have the power
to fire that manager.
I do work under these conditions, for I
report to the Coffee House president (a
student) and am hired/fired by a board of
directors comprised mostly of students. I
do not have the freedom to do as I please
as manager of the Coffee House, but must
consult and jointly make decisions with the
student management staff of the Coffee
House. The Saga manager's job is to report
to Saga headquarters and follow Saga
policies and dictates. That is one big differ
ence between the two entities. Saga has the
contract now signed with Tresidder and the
Coffee House is theirs to run as they wish,
along of course with Tresidder overseeing
the operation and approving or disapprov
ing of changes, etc.
Tresidder's main concern is money.
They have a hard time meeting their
budget. They rely heavily on income
producing areas of the building, most of
which they themselves do not operate (for
reasons that I cannot fathom), to maintain
steady growth in the non-revenue parts of
the building. They believe that a large cor
poration will practically guarantee this
continued growth so they in turn can stop
having to worry about climbing costs of
overhead and about their salaries, benefits
and working conditions.

Tresidder also has a hard time in
working and interacting with students.
There seems to be a self-serving attitude
among certain elements of Tresidder. They
feel they need to get the job done with as
little student involvement as possible, and
when the need arises for such involvement,
they hand-select students they know and
often have influence upon to help make
decisions beneficial to Tresidder. Their
contrite explanation of TMU not being a
student union but a community union is
most self-serving. I don't think the city of
Palo Alto or the county of Santa Clara
could operate a community union with all
the administrators and staff of Tresidder if
there were not one Stanford student
around. This institution is here because of
the students. I would not be working here,
The Daily would not be published, and
TMU would be an office complex for
Hewlett-Packard if Stanford students were
not here.
I have enjoyed working at the Coffee
House. Despite many frustrations working
with students, staff and Tresidder adminis
trators, I, along with the hard-working stu
dents and full-time staff, have established
the CHI on sound financial ground, and it
is operating well. We can improve in some
areas and had plans to do so. 1 have said
this many times to different people. I have
worked at the University of the Pacific, at
UC-Berkeley and now at Stanford. I must
say my experience tells me that the stu
dents here are the most hard-working, in
quisitive and motivated group of people
with whom I have had the pleasure of
working.
The customers of the Coffee House have
shown their concern and support for the
Coffee House, Inc. and will continue to do
so. It is about time Tresidder did the same.

After having read the editorial in the
July 2 edition of The Daily, and now that
the Coffee House will be officially turned
over to the Saga Corporation on Sept. 1,1,
as the current manager of the Coffee
House, need to take the responsibility and
"inform" you and perhaps some other
members of the Stanford community of
some facts that never seem to have come to
light during this entire, poorly-run process

VIEWPOINT

of bidding and the selection of a new con
tractor for the food services in Tresidder
Memorial Union. First, some historical
facts over the past five years.
1. The Coffee House has paid rent to
Tresidder as a percentage of net sales. That
percentage is almost double what the other
current contractor pays Tresidder. Due to
the inexperience of students preparing the
first bid, these students honestly believed
that by giving Tresidder 12.5 percent of
their net sales, they could still maintain
profitability and maintain low prices and
good, fair student wages.
As evidenced over the course of the first
two-and-one-half years of the contract, the
financial hardships of bearing this exorbi
tant rent figure and some mistakes by the
management staff have caused the Coffee
House, Inc. to become indebted to the
ASSU, the student employees to be paid
almost minimum wage, and the present
management to retain a pricing structure
that is higher than desired so that the CHI
may remain financially solvent and pay as
many of its obligations to creditors as pos
sible.
You might state that all this is not
Tresidder's fault and in fact favors the
argument that one of the reasons that
Tresidder did not award the contract to the
Coffee House is this lack of "management
depth and experience." I must state that

Tresidder, in all its desire to make the al
mighty buck and keep in the good graces of
the University budgetary process, gladly
took the CHI s hard-earned money from
the "inexperienced" students, knowing full
well that the rent percentage was quite a
bit out of line.
2. Another "concern" of Tresidder's is
sales and customer counts, which again
translates into "more money" for the
Tresidder coffers, which for some reason
each year seem to get drier and drier even
to the point of running a deficit for at least
the last two years. Over the last two years,
the CHI has doubled the sales at the Cof
fee House as compared to the last contrac
tor.
When the CHI took over the operation
of the Coffee House it was not a popular
place to hang out, let alone eat. The stu
dents have worked very hard to make the
Coffee House something special. Of course
Saga is not going to change anything about
the Coffee House. Why should they?
When someone has worked hard and long
to make an establishment a popular, fun
and relaxing place in which to enjoy
socializing and dining, do you think some
one else given that same operation is going
to come in and redo the place? Do you

sales in the Coffee House double and let
