"Like a black hole in space or

Since the beginning of time,
many people have put forth sets
of guidelines on how people
should live. Some of these people
had divine inspiration. Others
used empirical observations to
deduce natural laws. They all had

one thing in common, though.
Each believed in the utter cor
rectness of his particular ap
proach and the utter incorrect
ness of everyone else's.
They were all wrong.
My approach is, of course, cor
rect. Not only is it correct, it is
beautiful in its simplicity. My
friend Charles will claim that he
thought of the idea first, with his
"whoever dies with the most toys,
wins" philosophy, but I find it too
vague, too unquantified.
Here is my philosophy: The
purpose of life is to die with 1 mil
lion style points.
The rules are fairly simple: For
every action you undertake (or
don't undertake) you are given a
certain number of style points.
Style points are just that — points
you deserve because a certain ac
tion (or non-action) had that flair,
that panache we call style. Style
points are not, as most people
believe, subjective: In fact, there's
a large black ledger in my office
that lists every possible action (or
inaction) for every circumstance
and the corresponding number of

style points.
Style points can be positive or
negative and come in all quanti
ties. A running total is kept of
everyone's points, but it's a good
idea to have a rough idea of how
many you have, to know when
you have enough.
A few examples of the mag
nitudes of certain actions: Minus
300 for buying the "We Are the
World" single, believing this to be
an excellent way to stop famine in
Africa; plus 300 for buying the
"We Are The World" single to
cut out celebrity heads for an in
teresting Chapparal montage. Mi
nus 200 for winning the "Puttin'
on the Hits" competition; plus
200 for winning an air-guitar
competition. Plus 10,000 for
saving Brooke Shields from
drowning and blowing the reward

money by hiring Van Halen to
play at your birthday party.
And minus 50,000 for suicide,
unless your suicide leaves you
with exactly 1 million points,
whereupon 50,000 points is im
mediately credited to your next
life's account (Hemingway is an
example).
Of course, most actions involve
the gain or loss of only a few
points; the really big scores are
received for unique experiences
and how you fare with the un
known. This is why you get about
77 years (72 if you're a male) to
play.
Try it! It's easy. And remember
— I'm not making a point on the
deal.
