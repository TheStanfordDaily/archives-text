# July concerts nixed

### MARSH McCALL Editorial staff 
Two concerts by the Grateful
Dead, scheduled for July 27 and
28 at Frost Amphitheatre, were
canceled early last" week after a
misunderstanding between the
shows' organizers.
The canceled performances,
originally to be presented by the
ASSU Concert Network in con
junction with Bill Graham
Presents, would have marked the
Grateful Dead's second series of
concert dates at Stanford in
recent months.
A recorded message on the
Grateful Dead hotline had an
nounced the upcoming concerts,
but the message was changed last
week to say the shows had been
canceled due to "changes at Stan
ford University."
Senior Patrick McCrystle,
director of the concert network,
said the confusion stemmed from
a misinterpreted conversation be
tween himself and Bill Graham
representative Bob Barsotti.
"The Grateful Dead had ex
pressed an interest in doing a
show, and I had been in contact
with Barsotti," said McCrystle. "I
agreed to get in contact with him
[last] Monday to discuss par
ticulars. He took that as a go
ahead and announced the show

on the Grateful Dead hotline."
Representatives of Bill
Graham Presents could not be
reached for comment yesterday.
McCrystle said it simply turned
out to be a "bad idea" to have a
July Grateful Dead show.
"The police were very reluc
tant," said McCrystle. "And the
University was reluctant. It would
have been inconvenient to many
special-interest groups on campus
right now to have had the show."
McCrystle added that the
Grateful Dead would have been
unable to perform at least one
of the two planned shows in any
event, due to a scheduling conflict
at Frost.
Concert network advisor
Suzanne Becker acknowledged
that both organizations were to
blame. "The enthusiasm of the
personnel at the concert network
led to a misunderstanding," she
said. "They didn't follow through
to the extent they should have.
But Bob Barsotti was premature
in putting the message on the
hotline." Becker said she doesn't
consider the incident a cancella
tion "because it was never con
firmed."

derstanding, there was only a slim

The Grateful Dead played before two sold-out crowds at Stanford's Frost Amphitheatre last spring, but the
band's two planned Frost concerts scheduled later this month have been canceled.
chance the Grateful Dead would
have been able to perform, Beck
er said, echoing McCrystle's
statement that previous schedul
ing at Frost made the original
plan improbable.
"Putting on a Grateful Dead
concert requires efforts above
and beyond the call of duty," she
said. "One a year is enough."
"If we went ahead and pushed
for a show right now, it would
jeopardize the chances for a
spring show, when more students
are here," McCrystle said. He
added that there would be no re
scheduling of the concerts for this
summer.

"The whole thing was a misun
derstanding," agreed Don Dick
son, chairman of the concert net
work advisory board. "We had
put together a highly successful
Dead concert last spring and very
badly wanted them back. We
were indicating everything was
go' to Bill Graham Presents, but
we had not signed a contract and
had not authorized ticket sales."
