# 'Top Girls' a top performance
## 
### KARY ANTHOLIS 
A character in Susan Chur
chill's "Top Girls" says,"I went
into sales because I wanted to
meet people, but I kept meeting
people who didn't want to meet
me." This line captures the spirit
of Churchill's play, which has
been held over one week and is
playi tg at the Marines Memorial
Theater in San Francisco through
Sunday.
1 he production, which has
been transplanted to the Marines
Memorial from the Eureka
I heater, competently presents

Churchill's witty and fascinating
study of ambitious women.
Marlene is a corporate climber
in a London employment agency.
She has overcome a lower-class
background and a teenage preg
nancy to become successful in a
mans world. She spouts "work
ethic ideology" and admires Mar
garet Thatcher. "Top Girls" is
about the costs of Marlene's life.
he play is fairly simple in its
ic' ological perspective. Mar
ie.ie's "success" leaves behind
th >se who are less "competent"
th n herself, who include her

older sister and illegitimate
daughter. The play's beauty lies
in the complexity of the charac
ters and in the clever, if somewhat
awkward, structure of the story.
"Top Girls" begins by placing
Marlene's life in a historical con
text. She celebrates her promo
tion to managing director by
holding a banquet attended by six
mythical women. The group in
cludes the mistress to a Japanese
emperor, a Victorian missionary,
a female pope, the obedient wife
of a Chaucerian knight and a
character from a Breughel paint
ing. Each of these figures
represents a different picture of
the thrills and costs of female
ambition in a male-dominated
world. The exchanges range from
amusing to absurd in this part of
the play called ''Marlene's
Dream."

Especially exciting is the per
formance by Joy Carlin as Pope
Joan. She tells of fooling the
church about her sex, giving birth
during one of her own papal
processions and subsequently
being stoned to death. Her
storytelling ranges from hilarious
to heartbreaking.
The characters in "Marlene's
Dream" consistently interrupt
one another, hearing only what
relates to something important in
their lives. Their compassion and
mutual support are tempered
with moments of insensitivity and
painful frankness.
All of this makes for exciting
theater. It is disturbing that the
choice of this scene as an intro
duction seems arbitrary;
however, it gives an interesting
and textured background to Mar

lene's corporate climbing, so the
awkwardness is pardonable.
The conflicts caused by Mar
lene's ambition are aptly ren
dered by Lorri Holt (Marlene),
Nancy Jones (Marlene's sister
Joyce) and Nora Heflin
(Marlene's illegitimate daughter
Angie). Marlene, who has left the
dull-witted Angie to the care of
Joyce, returns for a visit. She
presents herself to Angie as Aunt
Marlene, but the young girl has
learned the truth. Marlene
remains distant, as she does not
want to be burdened with the life
of this "stupid and lazy" child.
When Angie goes to bed, Joyce
verbally attacks Marlene for her
airs of superiority. This scene is
rather melodramatic, but it is pre
sented with wit, sophistication
and balance, qualities characteris
tic of the "Top Girls" production.
