# Chili Peppers display punk's new direction
## 
### PHIL CHEN 
•/
The Keystone Palo Alto was
packed Saturday night for a show
featuring two young bands that
have gained a sizeable following
in the progressive music scene:
Fishbone, an all-black sextet from
Los Angeles, and The Red Hot
Chili Peppers, a band produced
by George Clinton, who is widely
known for his bands Parliament,
Funkadelic and The P-Funk All
Stars.
Two bands opened, the Calm
and Dot Three. I arrived in time
to see Dot Three play a one-hour
set. Their sound was somewhat
reminiscent of Hunters and Col
lectors, a cacophonous blend of
scratchy rhythm guitar, busy
timbales and drums, and quick
bass lines, with a few horns to add
punch here and there. Basically,
they took an interesting musical
idea and beat it to death; they
wanted to show us just how
"wild" they could be, but this
soon became grating.
Fishbone hopped on stage at
about 11:15. Some band mem
bers wore bright clothes, others
wore suits; the heat forced them
all to strip to the waist before
long. Lead singer/sax player An
gelo Christopher Moore sported a
spiny haircut that complemented
well his different singing style.
Fishbone put on the most ex
uberant show I've seen in a while
— a whirlwind of jumping, strut
ting and dancing. Angelo is a very
charismatic dude, and coupled
with the rest of the band's high
energy level, he really got the au
dience moving. Fishbone's antics
were often hilarious, especially on
"Modern Industry," a song that
has received some radio airplay.
Some part of their liveliness
derived from their music, a
funky-punky-ska mixture that is
usually frantically fast and very

danceable. They also threw in
some reggae-ish numbers that
were not entirely suited to their
style but which provided a good
change of pace. They even played
a terrific parody of hardcore
punk, "Subliminal Dream." Their
lyrics are somewhat primitive but
still funny.
The Red Hot Chili Peppers ap
peared last, and it was soon ap
parent they Were out to prove
that punk's not dead but has

merely absorbed other musical
styles and undergone a slight
transformation in the process.
The band was visually pleasing —
lead singer Anthony Kiedis tied
an American flag around his
waist, and drummer Cliff Mar
tinez wore some sort of bizarre
headdress.
Unfortunately their perfor
mance was not so pleasing. Flea's
funky bass and Jack Sherman's
hardcore/heavy metal guitar riffs

completely overwhelmed Kiedis'
voice, so I couldn't hear what he
was singing. Kiedis spat a lot, and
he and Flea wasted time with
their stupid shouting between
songs. His posturing and posing
during songs lacked Fishbone's
humor; he looked like an
attention-hungry brat.
Most of their songs sounded es
sentially alike. An exception was
"Mommy, Where's Daddy,"
primarily because it wasn't as fast

as their other songs and
allowed a clearer sound to come
through. They are all proficient
musicians, but they are entirely
predictable; combined with
Kiedis' obnoxious behavior,
The Peppers' show was less than
what I had hoped to see.
However, they did possess a
raw energy that is truly what rock
is all about and seeing Fishbone's
crazed stage spectacle made the
evening memorable.


The Chili Peppers were not "red hot" at the Keystone last Saturday.
