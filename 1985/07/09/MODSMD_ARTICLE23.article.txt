# Sting gets jazzy on 'Blue Turtles'
## 
### 
He's the King of Pain, poor
guy. And he talks of Reagan and
the absurdity of war and the hor
rors of drug addiction. But Sting
wears the crown easily, and with a
little help from his friends, has
put out a new record entitled
"The Dream of the Blue
Turtles."
And politics notwithstanding,
Sting's wistful melodies and mar
velous voice make this collection
of imaginative works into an A +
album.
As Sting himself announces on
the album sleeve, to call "The
Dream of the Blue Turtles" a solo
endeavor is misleading; The
Police's lead singer and bass
player has amassed an ensemble
of virtuoso jazz musicians, among
whom sax player Branford Mar
salis (brother of the better-known
Wynton) is featured prominently.
\ wise move on Sting's part; his
'irst recording venture without
the support of fellow-Police
members Stewart Copeland and
Andy Summers is assured a jazz
ier, different sound. At the same
time, these guys, giants in their
own fields, protect Sting from the
self-indulgence he's been known
to bask in.
True, they're still his composi
tions. But Marsalis' sax, Darryl
Jones' bass and Kenny Kirkland's
keyboards make the backing
tracks to each song more than a
mere framework for the vocals.
Not that The Police are boring in
strumentalists. But this band
keeps your ears busy, with an
attention-stealing keyboard
phrase, or a between-verse bass
lick. Only drummer Omar
Hakim's playing is reminiscent of
the "Police sound." But then,
Copeland always was a jazz
oriented drummer.
In reference to the first sen
tence of this review, it has always
been difficult to reconcile a politi
cal message — or indeed any
message at all — with the medi
um of rock music; a good tune
might be altered into an embar
rassing statement of melodrama.
Punk bands such as the Dead

Kennedys do this intentionally;
the grating awkwardness of angry
politics is important in punk
music.
In other styles of music,
however, the message must be
obscured, made less bald. It's fun
to ponder whether the Beatles'
"Blackbird" is a song about civil
rights. If Paul McCartney had
sung about Malcolm X, however,
the magic and mystery would
have disappeared.
Sting, his punk days behind
him, understands this very well.
With the exceptions of
"Russians," in which the Cold War
is discussed very frankly, the
messages in"The Dream of the
Blue Turtles" are nicely obscure.
Not too obscure; the message is
always clear. But Sting gets the
idea across through a series of
images, rather than bland state
ments. It's similar to The Police —
"Ghost in the Machine" in partic

ular — but not as directed. In
"The Children's Crusade," Sting
draws a parallel between young
men lost in World War I and
those lost to drug addiction.
Rather a strange comparison, but
it works: "Pawns in the game are
not victims of chance/ Strewn on
the fields of Belgium and France/
Poppies for young men, death's
bitter trade/ All of those young
lives betrayed."
In "We Work the Black
Seam," a song about the plight of
coal miners in the nuclear age,
Sting sings "They build machines
they can't control/ and bury the
waste in a great big hole/ Power
was to become cheap and clean/
grimy faces were never seen . . .
we work the black seam together."
But it's Sting's melodic touch,
seemingly simplistic, yet delicate
and haunting, which forms the
backbone of this album and lets
him get away with borrowing

lyrics from Shakespeare and
music from Prokofiev (both ac
knowledged). His voice wanders
loosely over the instrumentation,
low and husky, occasionally high
and piercing, Police-style.
But Sting's voice has changed
in the seven years since the first
Police album "Outlandos
d'Amour" was released. He dis
plays less of his choirboy range, as
heard in Police classics such as
"Roxanne" and "Walking on the
Moon." Instead he uses the con
trol and dynamics of his middle
range to add emotion to his
words.
At Oakland's "Day on the
Green" last year The Police were
introduced as "the rock band of
the '80s." Sting seems less con
cerned with the ska/white-reggae
sound which produced this epi
thet; he knows one of the many
advantages of fame is that your
audience will always give you a

chance if you try something dif
ferent. I still think Sting is the
'80's rock musician. But perhaps
it's because he's not trying to be.
The album's single, "If you
Love Somebody, Set Them Free"
is actually the weakest song on
the record, a bland response to
"Every Breath You Take."
Other songs deserve mention: a
fun remake of "Shadows in the
Rain"; great Gothic imagery in
"Moon Over Bourbon Street,"
and the jazzy instrumental title
track.
One fault, perhaps, with "The
Dream of the Blue Turtles" is the
loose structure of the album.
Each song draws upon a different
frame of reference, a different
goal. This doesn't bother me; I
like the variety. But those who
are troubled by such things might
be bothered by the discontinuity.

At Oakland's "Day on the
Green" last year The Police were
introduced as "the rock band of
the '80s." Sting seems less con
cerned with the ska/white-reggae
sound which produced this epi
thet; he knows one of the many
advantages of fame is that your
audience will always give you a

chance if you try something dif
ferent. I still think Sting is the
'80's rock musician. But perhaps
it's because he's not trying to be.
The album's single, "If you
Love Somebody, Set Them Free"
is actually the weakest song on
the record, a bland response to
"Every Breath You Take."
Other songs deserve mention: a
fun remake of "Shadows in the
Rain"; great Gothic imagery in
"Moon Over Bourbon Street,"
and the jazzy instrumental title
track.
One fault, perhaps, with "The
Dream of the Blue Turtles" is the
loose structure of the album.
Each song draws upon a different
frame of reference, a different
goal. This doesn't bother me; I
like the variety. But those who
are troubled by such things might
be bothered by the discontinuity.

He's the King of Pain, poor
guy. And he talks of Reagan and
the absurdity of war and the hor
rors of drug addiction. But Sting
wears the crown easily, and with a
little help from his friends, has
put out a new record entitled
"The Dream of the Blue
Turtles."
And politics notwithstanding,
Sting's wistful melodies and mar
velous voice make this collection
of imaginative works into an A +
album.
As Sting himself announces on
the album sleeve, to call "The
Dream of the Blue Turtles" a solo
endeavor is misleading; The
Police's lead singer and bass
player has amassed an ensemble
of virtuoso jazz musicians, among
whom sax player Branford Mar
salis (brother of the better-known
Wynton) is featured prominently.
\ wise move on Sting's part; his
'irst recording venture without
the support of fellow-Police
members Stewart Copeland and
Andy Summers is assured a jazz
ier, different sound. At the same
time, these guys, giants in their
own fields, protect Sting from the
self-indulgence he's been known
to bask in.
True, they're still his composi
tions. But Marsalis' sax, Darryl
Jones' bass and Kenny Kirkland's
keyboards make the backing
tracks to each song more than a
mere framework for the vocals.
Not that The Police are boring in
strumentalists. But this band
keeps your ears busy, with an
attention-stealing keyboard
phrase, or a between-verse bass
lick. Only drummer Omar
Hakim's playing is reminiscent of
the "Police sound." But then,
Copeland always was a jazz
oriented drummer.
In reference to the first sen
tence of this review, it has always
been difficult to reconcile a politi
cal message — or indeed any
message at all — with the medi
um of rock music; a good tune
might be altered into an embar
rassing statement of melodrama.
Punk bands such as the Dead

Kennedys do this intentionally;
the grating awkwardness of angry
politics is important in punk
music.
In other styles of music,
however, the message must be
obscured, made less bald. It's fun
to ponder whether the Beatles'
"Blackbird" is a song about civil
rights. If Paul McCartney had
sung about Malcolm X, however,
the magic and mystery would
have disappeared.
Sting, his punk days behind
him, understands this very well.
With the exceptions of
"Russians," in which the Cold War
is discussed very frankly, the
messages in"The Dream of the
Blue Turtles" are nicely obscure.
Not too obscure; the message is
always clear. But Sting gets the
idea across through a series of
images, rather than bland state
ments. It's similar to The Police —
"Ghost in the Machine" in partic

ular — but not as directed. In
"The Children's Crusade," Sting
draws a parallel between young
men lost in World War I and
those lost to drug addiction.
Rather a strange comparison, but
it works: "Pawns in the game are
not victims of chance/ Strewn on
the fields of Belgium and France/
Poppies for young men, death's
bitter trade/ All of those young
lives betrayed."
In "We Work the Black
Seam," a song about the plight of
coal miners in the nuclear age,
Sting sings "They build machines
they can't control/ and bury the
waste in a great big hole/ Power
was to become cheap and clean/
grimy faces were never seen . . .
we work the black seam together."
But it's Sting's melodic touch,
seemingly simplistic, yet delicate
and haunting, which forms the
backbone of this album and lets
him get away with borrowing

lyrics from Shakespeare and
music from Prokofiev (both ac
knowledged). His voice wanders
loosely over the instrumentation,
low and husky, occasionally high
and piercing, Police-style.
But Sting's voice has changed
in the seven years since the first
Police album "Outlandos
d'Amour" was released. He dis
plays less of his choirboy range, as
heard in Police classics such as
"Roxanne" and "Walking on the
Moon." Instead he uses the con
trol and dynamics of his middle
range to add emotion to his
words.
At Oakland's "Day on the
Green" last year The Police were
introduced as "the rock band of
