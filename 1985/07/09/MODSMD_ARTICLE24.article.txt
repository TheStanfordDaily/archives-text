## Officials still suspect arson Costs from Los Altos Hills fire climb 
### REBECCA ZEIGLER Staff writer 
The record-breaking fire that
roared through Los Altos Hills
just three miles south of the Stan
ford campus last Monday has left
more devastation and destruction
behind it than previously thought.
Current estimates from the
Palo Alto Fire Department in
clude 15 houses destroyed — four
in Palo Alto and 11 in Los Altos
Hills — and two others with
major damage. In addition, an
unknown amount of partial
damage to other houses and
properties has been reported.
Prodded by high temperatures
and gusty winds, the fire burned
approximately 150 acres, not
1,000 acres as originally reported.
The current property damage
estimate, not including cars which
may have been damaged or
destroyed in the fire, has been set
in the $10 million range.
However, Eric Raeburn,
spokeman from the Palo Alto
Fire Department, called the esti
mate conservative. "When you
consider the value of the houses
burned alone, and then include all
of their contents, this figure
seems low," he said.
Ironically, Los Altos Hills resi
dents voted 1289 to 503 last year
against a law-requiring houses to
have fire-retardant roofs. One
fire official was quoted last week
as saying most of the houses
began burning from the roofs,
and one firefighter said, "If he
hadn't had a shake roof, this guy
would still have a house."
To battle the fire, which raged
out of control for nearly three
hours, more than 200 firefighters
from about 60 different units
were called in, as were helicopters
and air tankers.
"Multiple-alarm fires are rare
in the Palo Alto area," Raeburn
said. "For the number of units
and cities responding, this seems
to be a current record-holder."
Both the Palo Alto police and
fire departments agree that last
Monday's fire was the result of
arson. "There were two distinct
fires burning by the time anyone
got there," Raeburn said.
The fires were "too far apart to

have been started by sparks,"
Fire Captain Steve Johnson was
quoted as saying last week.
Although La Honda resident
Phillip Hummel, 36, is still under
investigation, the police depart
ment has no new leads.
"Although we know it's arson, as
of this time, we haven't been able
to locate any potential wit
nesses," said agent John Foster.
Incendiary devices, however,
have not yet been found at the
Page Mill-Arastradero site of the
fire.
The police department requests
that anyone who might have seen
suspicious cars or persons on the
1500 block of Arastradero, near
the DC Powers Lab, last Monday

between noon and 3 p.m. contact
them immediately.
Twenty-six patients were atten
ded to as a result of the fire for a
variety of minor ailments, includ
ing smoke inhalation and hys
teria. One firefighter was treated
for an ember in his eye and
shoulder strain. Another victim,
allergic to bee stings, was at
tacked by a swarm of wasps as he
escaped from the fire.
The real victims of the fire,
those who lost their homes and
possessions, 3re still suffering. On
the day of the fire, the Red Cross
set up an emergency shelter at
Gunn High School as a communi
cations center for the homeless.
By 1:30 a.m. the following morn

ing, all had been taken in by
friends and relatives.
The Red Cross is in touch with
most of the families and help of
all sorts is available. According to
Director of Social Services Nancy
Sapperstein, "There has been a
tremendous outpouring of help
from the community."
Some vacationing families have
called to temporarily offer their
homes to fire victims while they
are gone. Others have brought in
donations of blankets, linens and
clothing.
"One woman spent her Fourth
of July ironing and washing
clothes for the victims," Sap
perstein said. "It's just beautiful."
Real estate agency Hare,

Brewer, and Kelley has offered
vacant Mountain View apart
ments, furnished with rented
furniture, free of charge to
families victimized by the fire for
a few weeks.
Although most of the fire
victim families are covered by in
surance, some were harder hit
than others. One family lost their
source of income with their home
as they watched their entire horse
barn and ranch incinerate.
At this point, the Red Cross is
still looking for creative ideas and
any offers of help. "It still
remains to be determined
whether the families will rebuild
their Los Altos Hills and Palo
Alto homes," Sapperstein said.

fires burning by the time anyone
got there," Raeburn said.
The fires were "too far apart to

have been started by sparks,"
Fire Captain Steve Johnson was
quoted as saying last week.
Although La Honda resident
Phillip Hummel, 36, is still under
investigation, the police depart
ment has no new leads.
"Although we know it's arson, as
of this time, we haven't been able
to locate any potential wit
nesses," said agent John Foster.
Incendiary devices, however,
have not yet been found at the
Page Mill-Arastradero site of the
fire.
The police department requests
that anyone who might have seen
suspicious cars or persons on the
1500 block of Arastradero, near
the DC Powers Lab, last Monday

between noon and 3 p.m. contact
them immediately.
Twenty-six patients were atten
ded to as a result of the fire for a
variety of minor ailments, includ
ing smoke inhalation and hys
teria. One firefighter was treated
for an ember in his eye and
shoulder strain. Another victim,
allergic to bee stings, was at
tacked by a swarm of wasps as he
escaped from the fire.
The real victims of the fire,
those who lost their homes and
possessions, 3re still suffering. On
the day of the fire, the Red Cross
set up an emergency shelter at
Gunn High School as a communi
cations center for the homeless.
By 1:30 a.m. the following morn

ing, all had been taken in by
friends and relatives.
The Red Cross is in touch with
most of the families and help of
all sorts is available. According to
Director of Social Services Nancy
Sapperstein, "There has been a
tremendous outpouring of help
from the community."
Some vacationing families have
called to temporarily offer their
homes to fire victims while they
are gone. Others have brought in
donations of blankets, linens and
clothing.
"One woman spent her Fourth
of July ironing and washing
clothes for the victims," Sap
perstein said. "It's just beautiful."
Real estate agency Hare,

Brewer, and Kelley has offered
vacant Mountain View apart
ments, furnished with rented
furniture, free of charge to
families victimized by the fire for
a few weeks.
Although most of the fire
victim families are covered by in
surance, some were harder hit
than others. One family lost their
source of income with their home
as they watched their entire horse
barn and ranch incinerate.
At this point, the Red Cross is
still looking for creative ideas and
any offers of help. "It still
remains to be determined
whether the families will rebuild
their Los Altos Hills and Palo
Alto homes," Sapperstein said.
