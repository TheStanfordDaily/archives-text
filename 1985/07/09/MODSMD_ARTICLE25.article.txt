# High schoolers summer at the Farm

Though Stanford belongs mainly to its
undergraduates and graduates during the
academic year, in the summer it also
belongs to high school students who take
classes and live at Stanford.
In addition to regular Stanford students,
the summer session program allows high
school students, undergraduate and
graduate students from other universities
and people over 25 years old to participate
in university life for eight to ten weeks.
Kristen Harrison, summer session aca
demic advisor, said the program is
•primarily for Stanford undergraduates
and graduates." But the program's high
cost — about $2,900 for tuition, room and
board — and lack of financial aid has dis
couraged many from taking summer
classes.
Stanford's summer program is small
compared to those at universities like Har
vard and Northwestern. The summer ses
sion operates on a budget of approximately
$1.5 million, more than half of which goes
to academic departments.
There are approximately 70 high school
students this summer, 23 from California.
Students from West Germany, Korea and
the Middle East also attend the program.
Most of the students, mainly high school
juniors and seniors, live on campus in Wil
bur Hall and take University meal plans.
Each of the students has his or her own
special reason for coming to Stanford. "I
am interested in coming here (for college)
and want to make sure I like the West
Coast," said Kim Grose, a high school
junior from New York.
"I wanted to take a science class and
thought it would be fun to do it in Califor
nia," said Victoria Miller, a high school
senior from a Connecticut boarding school.
Summer session students must take a
minimum of eight academic units, which
generally allows for two classes. Harrison,
who has worked in the summer session
program for seven years, recommends that
high school students take one class which
helps them in high school and another
geared toward college. Most students take
mathematics and English classes. Last
summer, a sixth of the 90 high school
visitors took basic calculus, while nearly a
quarter took freshman English.
Several students take the Critical
Reading and Writing class offered by the
Center for Teaching and Learning. The
class, which meets four times a week, intro
duces strategies for approaching different
types of readings and aims at producing
writing which follows well-developed
guidelines. The approximately 20 students,
about 70 percent of whom are high
schoolers, read Daniel Boorstin and Lewis

Thomas, then write on them.
About 20 percent of the class consists of
foreign students. Jack Prostko, one of the
three instructors in the class, said the
foreign students "generally keep up with
the class" even though "they are not only
moving from high school to college but to
an entirely different culture."
Prostko, who just received his doctoral
degree in English from Stanford, finds it a
challenge to teach high school students. "I
am very conscious of the fact that (high
school) students need more time and
help," he said, noting that he tries new ap
proaches to enhance comprehension of the
principles being taught.
Prostko said the class is taught at a slow
rate with a "good bit of individual atten
tion" given to students. The college stu

dents are not accustomed to the slow rate
but get used to it, he added.
Mike Port, of Hamburg, West Germany,
who is taking classes to improve his En
glish, said the teaching level is beneficial
and he takes the course seriously.
Students have their choice of classes
ranging from astronomy to biology. Miller,
17, is taking a reading rate workshop and
Port a computer science class. Grose said
she is excited about her film and photogra
phy classes.
It takes little time for high school stu
dents to actively participate in class discus
sions. Prostko, who will teach at Vander
bilt University this fall, said that by the
second class the high school students
realize they can participate in class discus
sions without being hissed at.

Margaret Neff, a Stanford student taking
summer classes, said high school students
"are here because they want to learn and
are making significant contributions" in
class. Neff, a senior majoring in biology,
finds that they bring "fresh ideas" to her
general psychology class.
For many high school students, summer
session is the first time they have been
away from their families for an extended
period. Grose, 16, said "thinking about
being really far away from home was
scary."
Miller, who spent a year in France, said
she was not scared about coming to Stan
ford and thought, "at least they speak En
glish here, so it should be OK."
High school students make new friends
quickly. Miller said she did not know
anybody when she arrived here, but found
people friendly and willing to help out.
Neff, 21, said high school students have a
"double benefit" because they can talk to
students from Stanford and other univer
sities about colleges.
Inefficient time management and poor
self-discipline are problems for high school
students. College students "are supervised
less (than in high school) and must learn
how to use their time well," Prostko said.
"They must learn how to deal with self
motivation and self-discipline."
One reason may be the students' lack of
commitment to their studies. Prostko said
they are "not lazy and unconcerned" about
their work, but are "not under quite as
much psychological pressure as incoming
freshmen because they know they won't be
here in two months and will go back to
what was familiar."
Many high school students view summer
session here as a ticket for admission to
Stanford. Harrison said there is a
"tendency for people outside the Univer
sity — high school students and their par
ents — to think coming in summer is going
to improve the chances of getting into
Stanford."
Though the summer session booklet em
phatically states there is no link between
summer school and admission into Stan
ford, many are not completely convinced.
Most of Harrison's conversations with high
school students and their parents arrive at
the inevitable question: Will summer
school help in admission to Stanford?
Grose, who is aware that summer school
will not improve her chances of coming to
Stanford, said, "For me, it helps to meet
professors so that when they come across
my application out of 17,000, they will say,
'Yes, I remember her.' "
On the other hand, Miller does not think

of summer school as getting into
Stanford. "Though I am inter
ested in coming here," she said,
"I do not see summer school as an
extra advantage."
"Parents are putting an awful
lot of pressure on their kids,"
Harrison said. They think if their

children "do not get into Stan
ford, Harvard, Yale or Princeton,
life is going to be warped."
Harrison stresses to parents
that if they think summer school
will aid their child's admission
into Stanford, they are "spending
money on buying them something
that is not."
Many parents see summer
school as a new experience for
their children. Elisa Randolph,

financial assistant at Information
Technology Services, does not see
the summer session as a way for
her 16-year-old son to get into
Stanford. Randolph, who is con
sidering sending her son next
year, said the financial output is
worth the responsibility and inde
pendence students gain from
summer school.
High school students have dif
ferent expectations of summer

school. Miller, who plans to study
international business in college,
said "summer school will be fun"
and is looking forward to it.
Grose, who wants to pursue a
writing career, said "part of me
hopes I hate Stanford so that I
won't have to apply and worry
about if I get in." But, she added,
the other part hopes "I do my
best to get in."
