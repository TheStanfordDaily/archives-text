# Daily Terror Softball:
## The 						legend lives on. 
### 


Daily Terror, The Daily's very own
intramural softball team, plays its first
game tomorrow at 4 p.m. at the IM fields
next to El Camino Real. Don't be like Walt
Harris and miss out on the fun. You'll
regret it, too. Join star Terror infielder Ug
Sitrin (right) for all the festivities. Beer to
follow. Past or present staffers, their
friends and near relatives, are welcome.
And remember KZSU, you're next.
