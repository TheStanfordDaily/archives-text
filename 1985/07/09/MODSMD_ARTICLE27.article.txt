## New women's basketball coach Van Derveer settles into Stanford job 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
Two months after leaving Ohio State to
come to Stanford, Tara Van Derveer, the
new women's basketball coach, is settling
into life on the Farm. She has hired a staff
and is now running the second week of her
girl's basketball camp while dealing
with the bureaucratic details of coming to a
new program.
"I'm dealing with the paperwork," she
said. "I'm just getting organized in a new
place."
Van Derveer's main concern this week
will be the Stanford Girls' Basketball
Camp. Expanded to two weeks this year,
the camp hosted 120 girls two weeks ago,
and 80 more arrived yesterday after a one
week layoff.
"It's a small camp compared to what we
had at OSU," Van Derveer said, compar
ing it to the 460 girls who attended that
camp, "but the numbers can change
quickly."
There will be eight coaches for this ses
sion, including Stanford players Kim Mer
cer and Kami Anderson. This is the last
year players will be able to work at camps,
an NCAA-imposed rule that Van

Derveer is less than thrilled with.
"A lot of young girls as players don't get
to see women collegians as players," she
said. "They don't see women as role
models. I think it's a bad rule for us."

There is currently a similiar rule for
men's basketball to prevent athletic de
partments or athletic boosters from making
inordinately large payments to players for
working at camps.

As for the camp itself, Van Derveer said
it should be "a fun experience for the
kids." She said they play from 8:30 in the
morning to 8:30 at night with time out only
for meals. "The kids leave tired."
Individual attention is an important task
for the coaches, she said. In addition to
drills, there are two games a day, plus
three-on-three, one-on-one and free throw
tournaments. The camp is at Maples
Pavilion, while the players live at Branner
Hall for the week.
Van Derveer said the camp also helps in
recruiting by allowing her to identify po
tential collegiate players and expose them
to Stanford. "We had a couple of possible
collegiate players at our first camp," she
said.
"It's funny — a lot of the kids are excited
about just being at Stanford, being on the
campus."
Van Derveer has hired two assistants to
work full time and one to work part time
this season. Amy Tucker is the only hol
dover from her staff at Ohio State. The
other two are former Buckeye players —
June Brewer Daugherty, a former assistant
at Kent State, and Julie Plant, a former as
sistant at Capital, in Columbus, Ohio, who

will work part-time at Stanford.
"I'm really pleased with the people
we've been able to get here as assistants,"
Van Derveer said. "They have a good
knowledge of basketball — we're lucky to
have them. They made a tremendous com
mitment to me and the program. They all
gave up good jobs to come here."
Tucker and Daugherty are already on
the road recruiting, having left a month ago
to look at high schoolers at camps around
the country.
Van Derveer said she has found an
apartment in Palo Alto and begun settling
down in the area. She also had a chance to
talk with the team and meet with everyone
individually before school ended.
Van Derveer is hoping to build a follow
ing in the next few years for a team that has
gone 14-42 the past two seasons and has
drawn two-digit crowds for many of those
games.
"I don't feel there's apathy on this
campus," she said in response to an often
heard description of Stanford students.
"The first thing we have to worry about is
building a strong team."
