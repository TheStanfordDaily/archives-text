## Hoop player to transfer 
### MARK ZEIGLER Editorial staff 
While 17-year-old Boris Be
cker was surprising the tennis
world by winning the men's
singles championship at
Wimbledon, another young star
was making a name for herself in
Schenectady, N.Y.

Sports roundup

Linda Gates, who ended her
storybook collegiate career at
Stanford this may, won her first
pro singles tournament Saturday.
Not only did Gates capture the
singles title, she also teammed
with UCLA's Lynn Lewis to win
the doubles in the $10,000 tourn
ament.
The doubles victory was the
second in Gates" three tourna
ments as a professional, as she
and Leigh Anne Eldredge, a
junior at Stanford, won the
doubles at a U.S. Tennis Associa
tion tournament in Fayetteville,
N.C., last month.
Gates is presently playing in a
challenger event in Key Biscayne,
Fla., where she won three singles
qualifying matches and is now in
the main draw. The tournament
ends Saturday.
Gates won both the NCAA

singles and doubles titles this
year, the first woman to ac
complish that double since Stan
ford's Kathy Jordan did it in
1978. Like Gates, Jordan was
busy winning a doubles tourna
ment this weekend, as she and
Elizabeth Smylie of Australia
beat Martina Navratilova and
Pam Shriver to win the
Wimbledon doubles champion
ship.
Pac-10 All-Stars finally win
The Pacific 10 All-Star basket
ball team ended its two-week tour
of Australia on a winning note in
Tasmania, defeating the Hobart
Devils 101-90. However, it was
the team's only victory, and the
squad returned home yesterday
with a 1-6 record.
It was a disappointing two
weeks for Stanford Coach Tom
Davis, who coached the team,
and especially so for Stanford
senior Earl Koberlein, who
played on it. Koberlein had two
teeth extracted after being
elbowed in the mouth in the
second game and missed the rest
of the games.
Against Hobart, Arizona
State's Steve Beck led the Pac-10
with 21 points, while Washing
ton's Paul Fortier and Washing

ton State's Joe Wallace scored 20
apiece.
The Pac-10, which opened the
trip with three losses to the
Australian National team by an
average of 27 points, lost to the
Nunawading Spectres 102-89 last
Thursday. In that game, Fortier
had 18 points and a game-high 15
rebounds. Both the Hobart and
Nunawading teams are members
of the Australia National Basket
ball League.
One person on the Australia
trip who probably was not too
excited about returning home is
Arizona State Coach Bob Wein
hauer, Davis' assistant coach in
Australia.
The Phoenix Gazette quoted
unidentified sources last week as
saying that it will be "a matter of
days" before Weinhauer is fired.
Despite several highly-touted
recruiting classes, Arizona State
has suffered two straight losing
seasons, and rumors of Wein
hauer s dismissal have been circu
lating for months.
Basketball player to transfer
Stanford basketball player
Doug Wall has decided to trans
fer to Nevada-Reno, The Daily
has learned.
Wall, a 6-foot-7 forward who
still has two years of eligibility

remaining, will have to sit out a
season before he is eligilible to
play for Nevada-Reno, which in
recent years has fielded winning
basketball teams.
Wall, from Grass Valley, has
seen little action in his two
seasons at Stanford. He played a

total of 44.5 minutes in 13 games
last season, averaging 1.6 points
per game. As a freshman, Wall
played 41 minutes in 12 games,
and averaged 1.0 point per game.
Neither Wall nor Davis, who
was returning from Australia, was
available for comment.
