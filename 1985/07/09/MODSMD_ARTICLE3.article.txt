expected mourners. The Presi
dent's Office is welcoming all

Sterling served as president
from 1949 to 1968 and is gener
ally credited with establishing
Stanford as a premier academic
institution.
"In all of academic history in
this country, no university has
ever advanced so far under the
leadership of a single man,"
University President Donald
Kennedy said of Sterling.
During Sterling's presidency,
enrollment, primarily at the
graduate level, rose by 40 per
cent and the faculty expanded
170 percent to 938. These fac
ulty appointments included
what Time magazine called a
tk gold rush" of pre-eminent
scholars from Eastern univer
sities.
Under Sterling's leadership,
the University experienced a
more than tenfold increase in its

operating budget to $108 mil
lion annually, and the campus
itself changed dramatically.
By 1970, approximately
three-quarters of the Univer
sity's physical plant had been
either built or planned under his
presidency, including the medi
cal school which was previously
housed in San Francisco, the
Stanford Linear Accelerator

Center, and a major renovation
of the original Quad buildings.

major revision of the curriculum
and established five overseas
study centers in Europe.
The closing years of his
presidency were marked by a
rising tide of student activism

which culminated in the spring of
1968 with a 57-hour sit-in at Old
Union by several hundred stu
dents protesting CIA recruitment
on campus.
Declining health led Sterling to
retire in September 1968. Upon
retirement, he was appointed
chancellor for life and in 1969
was elected to the Board of Trus

tees, of which he remained a
member until 1976.
Sterling was always an excep
tional fundraiser. In response to a
matching funds offer by the Ford
Foundation in 1960, the Univer
sity embarked on the most am
bitious fundraising effort up to
that time and by 1964 had
exceeded the goal of $100 million

by $13 million.
Sterling was born on Aug. 6,
1906, in Linwood, Ontario. He
received his B.A. at the Univer
sity of Toronto and an M.A. at
the University of Alberta in 1930.
Later that year he married the
former Ann Marie Shaver.
Sterling came to Stanford in
1932 to pursue a Ph.D. in history

and received that degree in 1938.
Sterling is survived by his wife,
three children — Susan Monjauze
of Paris, Judy Morse of Pasadena
and William of San Francisco —
and six grandchildren.
The family prefers memorial
gifts to the University or the Fioli
Center in Woodside.
