# Lights go out in Wilbur Hall

### JAN GOBEN Staff writer 
Thirty students were relocated
from Wilbur Hall s Otero House
to an adjacent building over the
weekend when a major power
failure was discovered in an un
derground cable Friday after
noon.
Terry McGovern, manager of
Housing Facility Projects, said
tests completed on Friday deter
mined that the multiple power
outages Otero had been experi
encing all week were due to a
major cable failure. Yesterday af
ternoon, the 300 feet of defective
cable were found near Otero. If all
goes according to schedule, the
30-year-old wires will be replaced
today and hooked up and operat
ing by tomorrow afternoon.
Some of the students who were
moved to Madera House, next to
Otero and also in the Wilbur
complex, said the power outage
and relocation were a nuisance.

Sanjay Agrawala, a high school
senior attending Stanford's sum
mer session, said the interrup
tions were especially aggravating
because he had a midterm yester
day.
"There were at least five power
outages over a span of four days,"
he said. "That was all time lost. It
has taken at least a few hours out
of my [study time].
"I know a lot of students had
various assignments they had to
do over the long weekend, but I
don't think it really hurt anybody
very much," he continued.
Not all of the'Otero residents
relocated, however. Agrawala
said some people are still sleeping
in Otero and using the building
during daylight hours.
Andrew Mac√üride, another
Otero resident, explained that he
is remaining in the building be
cause, "I don't want to have to
move all the stuff out of my
closets and remake the beds."
