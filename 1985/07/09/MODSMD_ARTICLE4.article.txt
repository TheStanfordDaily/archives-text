## Ng fit for trial Talks about Lake murders 
### 
CALGARY, Alberta —
Charles Ng was dedared fit to
stand trial in Canada yesterday as
U.S. authorities said they would
begin proceedings to return him
to California, wtiere he is linked
to the discovery of at least nine
bodies at a remote hillside house.
Under questioning. Ng, 24,
gave police details about the dis
appearances of a number of
Californians linked to him and
survivalist Leonard Lake, accord
ing to a report from an uniden
tified law enforcement source in
yesterday's San Francisco Ex
aminer.
Investigators have unearthed
nine bodies, 40 pounds of bones,
videotapes of sexual torture and
bloody tools in and around the
house used by Lake, who com
mitted suicide in police custody
last month. Police say Ng appears
on some of the videotapes — in
cluding one in which he threatens
a terrified woman with a knife —
although his fingerprints have not
been found at the house.
During interviews with police
Sunday, Ng blamed Lake for the
death of San Francisco car dealer
Paul Cosner and for luring to the
cabin two employees of a moving
company, one of whom was
burned, the newspaper said. Ng
also said Lake brought to the
cabin the San Francisco family of
Harvey Dubs, 29, his wife
Deborah, 33, and their young son
Sean, although the source did not
say if Ng knew what happened to
them.
The former U.S. Marine ap
peared briefly in a packed court
room before Judge Hubert Oliver
granted a prosecution request for

a preliminary psychiatric ex
amination.
Several hours later, prosecutors
said government psychologists
had declared him able to stand
trial.
Ng faces Canadian charges of
attempted murder, robbery of
less than S2OO and illegal use of
firearms. He was arrested at a
Calgary department store during
an alleged shoplifting attempt in
which a security guard was shot in
the hand.
Oliver scheduled a Monday
hearing when Ng will be asked to
choose among a judge-only trial
in provincial court, a judge-only
trial in a higher court, or a jury
trial in a higher court.
Ng's attorneys, who have
promised to fight extradition, said
they would recommend a jury
trial.
In San Francisco, Claralyn
Balazs. Lake's ex-wife, has been
subpoenaed to appear tomorrow
before a grand jury, said Stan
Rozanski, one of her attorneys.
Rozanski said yesterday the sub
poena asked for a 1985 personal
calendar and some letters from
Lake.
At a news conference with Cal
ifornia and Canadian authorities,
Calgary Police Inspector Ron
Tarrant said Ng, who has a sister
in Calgary, might have been
camping in a city park for three or
four days before his arrest.
Six California investigators
arrived Sunday to question Ng.
Calaveras County Sheriff s Sgt.
Ron McFall and San Francisco
Police Inspector Edward Erdelatz
questioned him for about five
hours Sundav.
