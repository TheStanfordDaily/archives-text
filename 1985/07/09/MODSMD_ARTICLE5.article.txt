### 
Three brush fires threatened hundreds of
homes along the Central California coast as they
raced across 1,500 acres of rugged terrain, while
more than 3.000 residents of the area fled their
homes in the path of a suspected arson blaze just
south of Los Gatos, authorities said yesterday.
The fire, located about 20 miles southeast of
Stanford, destroyed at least one structure, an
abandoned cabin, said Bob Marconi, public in
formation officer for the California Department
of Forestry .
The flames had been partially contained yes
terday morning, but 90-degree temperatures and
winds up to 15 mph fueled the blaze, sending it
roaring out of control at 2 p.m. yesterday, said
Glenn Bass of the department.
Rescue workers, knocking door to door,
evacuated about 1.000 homes in Soda Springs,
Chemeketa Park, Lupin Lodge. Aldercroft
Heights and Loma Prieta, while 600 firefighters
battled to contain the fire. Bass said.
The Red Cross provided shelter at Los Gatos
High School for residents that had no other place
to go, Bass said.
Meanwhile, a grass fire in Fremont, across the
Bay from Palo Alto, burned about 200 acres just
east of the Dumbarton Bridge, said Gary Olson,
dispatcher for the Fremont Fire Department.
No structures were damaged and there were no
injuries reported, Olson said. The fire was
brought under control about three hours after it
began.
Three brush fires along the Central California
Coast were sparked by lightning on Saturday,
said Marta Witt, spokeswoman for the multi
agency task force fighting the fires.
The Rat Creek fire, about 15 miles south of
Big Sur. burned 2.600 acres in the steep, rocky
area and damaged structures, she said.
"Some structures were damaged but we're not
sure how manv or what kind." Witt said. "The

structures threatened in that area are year-round
homes, so we're concerned about that."
The fire forced the California Highway Patrol
to close Highway 1 from the San Luis Obispo
County line to Julius Pfeiffer Burns State Park,
she said. There was no indication when the high
way would reopen.
Authorities evacuated students when flames
threatened the Esalen Institute near Big Sur Hot
Springs, Witt said.
The other two blazes — the Willow and the
Gorda fires — burned out about 1,300 acres in a
mining area farther to the south, Witt said.
More than 700 firefighters battled the three
blazes with three air tankers, two helicopters and
several bulldozers. There were no serious injuries
reported.
A couple living in the coastal area threatened
by the Rat Creek fire said yesterday that they
were preparing to evacuate.
"Everybody's packing up and getting ready to
move," said Melissa Levitzky, who lives near An
derson Landing.
"The north side of the highway is in flames,"
she said in a telephone interview. "Last night
when we saw the flames we called the forest ser
vice. They said they've not been able to put it out,
so today we're going to evacuate."
The roof of Hillside Church was slightly
damaged b> a 200-acre brushfire on El Toro
peak west of Morgan Hill in Santa Clara County,
20 miles south of San Jose, authorities said.
Three firefighters suffered minor injuries. The
cause of the blaze was under investigation.
Firefighters brought a 40-acre fire under con
trol yesterday in the Igo area, about 30 miles
southwest of Redding, in temperatures near 100
degrees, said Ernie Loveless, public information
officer for the California Department of Forestry.
No structures were damaged.
