# Official says melon fertilizer misused
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO â€” Califor
nia's top agriculture official said
yesterday that he believes water
melon poisonings in California
and surrounding states were
caused by deliberate misuse of
farm chemicals, not by pesticide
residue from previous crops.
*Tm not assuming it was a car
ryover. I'm assuming it was an il
legal application," state Food and
Agriculture Director Clare Ber
ryhill said, adding that his depart
ment had received information
from informants to that effect.
The pesticide involved in the

poisonings, aldicarb. sold by the
Union Carbide Co. under the
trade name of Temik, is banned
for use on watermelon crops. But
its use has been approved for
other crops, including cotton,
which are produced in the same
area as watermelons, in many
cases by the same growers.
Aldicarb-contaminated melons
have been linked to illnesses of
more than 200 people in four
Western states and one Canadian
province.
While some growers blamed

Union Carbide for the contami
nation, saying the pesticide did
not decompose in the soil as fast
as they had been led to believe.
Berryhill said at a news confer
ence. "I'm not going to blame
Union Carbide at this juncture."
"We believe there were viola
tions of restricted materials laws,
and we think there are some
growers out there who violated
that. And I'm here to tell you
right now that I will not sleep un
til I find those growers, and I'm
going to use all the police power I
have in my power to put them

away. We cannot allow a few
growers in this state to jeopardize
our industry. We're out to find
those people." Bern hill said.
His deputy. Rex Nlagee. said
violations of pesticide laws are
misdemeanors with maximum
criminal penalties of a S 1.000 fine
and up to six months in jail. But
he said civil penalties could be
Sl5O per plant, which he said
could total "in the millions of dol
lars."
Berryhill added that other
growers who have lost their crops

because of orders to destroy
suspect fruit might also have
claims against growers who vio
lated the pesticide laws.
Dr. Kenneth Kizer. director of
the state Department of Health
Services, said 149 California il
lnesses were linked to aldicarb
poisoning and an additional 200
illnesses in 23 counties were un
der investigation.
At least 38 cases of aldicarb
poisoning have been reported in
Oregon. Washington. Alaska and
British Columbia.
