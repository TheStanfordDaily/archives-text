'Hitler Diary' schemers convicted
HAMBURG, West Germany — A Hamburg court convicted
three people yesterday of arranging the sale of the forged " Hitler
Diaries," but the judge also said Stern magazine was too easily
duped in the $3.1 million swindle.
The prosecution called it the literary hoax of the century.
Chief Judge Holger Schroeder told a packed courtroom that
the Hamburg-based, mass circulation magazine "stood naked,"
without any proof that the journals were real, as it went to press
with them in April 1983.
Historians and the public alike rushed to peek into the private
thoughts of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler as Stern began publishing
its sensation. Stern hailed the excerpts as the "journalistic scoop
of the postwar period." But experts quickly denounced the 60
volumes as crude fakes.
Stern never got back any of the $3.1 million it paid for the fake
diaries.
Convicted of fraud were former Stern reporter Gerd
Heidemann, 53, who procured the fake diaries for the magazine,
and confessed forger Konrad Kujau, 47, a dealer in Nazi
memorabilia and a handwriting expert. Edith Lieblang, 44, a
friend of Kujau, was convicted of receiving stolen property —
some of Kujau's earnings from the forgeries.
Fraud alleged in Mexican elections
HERMOSILLO, Mexico — The opposition National Action
Party yesterday charged fraud and the government party claimed
victory in national elections.
Official results from Sunday's voting are not expected for a
week, but the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI,
said returns from around the country showed the party scored a
sweeping triumph.
The balloting was for all 400 deputies in the lower house of
Congress, governors in seven of the nation's 31 states and some
municipal officials.
Here in prosperous Sonora state, beside the Arizona border,
the PRI claimed in a statement that it won a "100 percent vic
tory" in campaigns at every level, from governor to city council.
The gubernatorial races in Sonora and in Nuevo Leon, along
the Texas border, had been expected to be the most hotly con
tested.
National Action Party (PAN) organizers at the Sonora state
headquarters in Hermosillo did not concede defeat and called for
a rally to protest alleged fraud.
Six South African blacks killed
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Police said two blacks
were killed in riots yesterday and four were slain late last week
during a security sweep through Duduza township.
The deaths raised the number of blacks killed in 10 months of
violent protests against apartheid, South Africa's official policy
of racial segregation, past 400.
Gen. P.J. Coetzee, the national police commissioner, denied '
charges of police brutality.
"Allegations that policemen disguise themselves, shoot people
in cold blood and abduct others are bereft of all truth," Coetzee
said in a statement.
Newspapers quoted Duduza residents as saying plainclothes
policemen indiscriminately shot at youths during a drive against
suspected rioters in the township east of Johannesburg. The news
stories said as many as 25 youths were missing after the sweep.
Col. Leon Mellet, spokesman for Law and Order Minister
Louis le Grange, said the allegations by Duduza residents were
"upsetting, exaggerated and distorted."
National police headquarters said four blacks were killed
Friday, three when police used birdshot to scatter stone-throwing
crowds and a woman who perished when a car and a police
armored vehicle collided.
Police remained in the township yesterday. Witnesses said they
saw police patrolling in groups of eight, with one man in each
squad carrying a rifle and the others holding whips.
OPEC fails to set price controls
VIENNA, Austria — OPEC oil ministers pledged to stop
cheating on oil prices Sunday, but failed to agree on steps to prop
up sagging oil prices. Some industry analysts called the meeting a
failure.
Speaking at the end of three days of meetings, Indonesian Oil
Minister Subroto, the current OPEC president, said the 13-
nation cartel would meet again in Geneva, Switzerland, on July
22 to try to hammer out a formula that would halt declines in
world oil prices.
He said the Geneva meeting would consider a proposal to in
troduce a "floating production ceiling" that would be adjusted
seasonally to meet changes in demand for oil.
Some industry analysts said the outcome of the meeting was
unlikely to halt the erosion of oil prices that has eaten away at
OPECs wealth and influence in the past three-and-one-half
years.
Said William Randol, an analyst for the New York investment
firm of First Boston Corp., "It looks like they failed."
In a telephone interview, Randol said he expected oil prices to
fall from the current level of $26 to $28 a barrel to the low 20s in
the next two years.
But industry analyst Dan Lundberg said in Los Angeles that
the collapse in talks was merely a "recess" and any action they
take is likely to have little effect on prices at the pump.
At the close of Sunday's four-hour session, Subroto said the oil
ministers also agreed to keep the current price of $28 a barrel
and to maintain a production ceiling of 16 million barrels a day.

during a security sweep through Duduza township.
The deaths raised the number of blacks killed in 10 months of
violent protests against apartheid, South Africa's official policy
of racial segregation, past 400.
Gen. P.J. Coetzee, the national police commissioner, denied '
charges of police brutality.
"Allegations that policemen disguise themselves, shoot people
in cold blood and abduct others are bereft of all truth," Coetzee
said in a statement.
Newspapers quoted Duduza residents as saying plainclothes
policemen indiscriminately shot at youths during a drive against
suspected rioters in the township east of Johannesburg. The news
stories said as many as 25 youths were missing after the sweep.
Col. Leon Mellet, spokesman for Law and Order Minister
Louis le Grange, said the allegations by Duduza residents were
"upsetting, exaggerated and distorted."
National police headquarters said four blacks were killed
Friday, three when police used birdshot to scatter stone-throwing
crowds and a woman who perished when a car and a police
armored vehicle collided.
Police remained in the township yesterday. Witnesses said they
saw police patrolling in groups of eight, with one man in each
squad carrying a rifle and the others holding whips.
OPEC fails to set price controls
VIENNA, Austria — OPEC oil ministers pledged to stop
cheating on oil prices Sunday, but failed to agree on steps to prop
up sagging oil prices. Some industry analysts called the meeting a
failure.
Speaking at the end of three days of meetings, Indonesian Oil
Minister Subroto, the current OPEC president, said the 13-
nation cartel would meet again in Geneva, Switzerland, on July
22 to try to hammer out a formula that would halt declines in
world oil prices.
He said the Geneva meeting would consider a proposal to in
troduce a "floating production ceiling" that would be adjusted
seasonally to meet changes in demand for oil.
Some industry analysts said the outcome of the meeting was
unlikely to halt the erosion of oil prices that has eaten away at
OPECs wealth and influence in the past three-and-one-half
years.
Said William Randol, an analyst for the New York investment
firm of First Boston Corp., "It looks like they failed."
In a telephone interview, Randol said he expected oil prices to
fall from the current level of $26 to $28 a barrel to the low 20s in
the next two years.
But industry analyst Dan Lundberg said in Los Angeles that
the collapse in talks was merely a "recess" and any action they
take is likely to have little effect on prices at the pump.
At the close of Sunday's four-hour session, Subroto said the oil
ministers also agreed to keep the current price of $28 a barrel
and to maintain a production ceiling of 16 million barrels a day.
