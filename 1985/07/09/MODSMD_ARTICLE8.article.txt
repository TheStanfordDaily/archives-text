Reagan calls terrorism 'war'
WASHINGTON — President Reagan yester
day branded Iran, Libya, North Korea, Cuba and
Nicaragua as partners in a terrorist network "now
engaged in acts of war" against the United States,
and declared that America "has the right to
defend itself."
"The American people are not — I repeat not
— going to tolerate intimidation, terror and out
right acts of war against this nation and its
people," Reagan said.
"And we are especially not going to tolerate
these attacks from outlaw states run by the
strangest collection of misfits, looney tunes and
squalid criminals since the advent of the Third
Reich," Reagan vowed.
The audience of several thousand delegates to
the convention of the American Bar Association
applauded and laughed at his description of the
leaders of the "outlaw states." They also gave the
president a standing ovation when he said
Americans will always defend their country.
Reagan pointedly did not threaten any military
steps or retaliation against terrorists, saying his
purpose was to "simply state the facts about the
nature of international terrorism and affirm
America's will to resist it."

He said terrorists are trying "to cause us to
retreat, retrench, to become 'Fortress America.'
Yes, their real goal is to expel America from the
world."
"And under international law," Reagan added,
"any state which is the victim of acts of war has
the right to defend itself."
So far, there have been no retaliatory strikes
during the Reagan Administration for the many
terrorist actions directed against Americans.
Robert McFarlane, the president's national se
curity adviser, recently suggested there would be
strikes against terrorist training camps or supply
bases.
Reagan noted the hijacking of TWA Flight 847
and the killing of four American Marines in El
Salvador, but did not pinpoint blame on any
group.
The president charged that terrorists represent
"a new, international version of Murder, Inc.,"
and said their sponsors are united by "their
fanatical hatred of the United States, our people,
our way of life, our international stature."
Under reporting requirements of the Export
Administration Act of 1979, the State Depart
ment identifies Syria and South Yemen, along
with Iran, Libya and Cuba, as supporters of inter
national terrorism.
