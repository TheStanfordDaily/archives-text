Seat-belt bill goes to Senate
SACRAMENTO — A seat-belt-use bill that
would also require air bags or automatic seat
belts in future California cars moved closer to the
governor's desk yesterday after the last major
foes dropped their opposition.
The measure, A 827 by Assembly Speaker
Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), cleared the
Senate Appropriations Committee on a 6-1 vote.
It went to the full Senate.
The bill, which passed the Assembly earlier
this year in a somewhat different form, would re
quire most motorists and their passengers to use
seat belts, starting next Jan. 1.
Drivers and any passengers over age 16 could
be fined $20 or ordered to attend traffic safety
school for a first violation. The penalty for subse
quent violations would be a $50 fine. People with
a medical condition that prevents seat-belt use
would not be covered by the bill. Citations for
failure to use a seat belt could be issued only if
the motorist were stopped for another traffic
violation.
The bill would also require new private pas
senger vehicles manufactured after Sept. 1, 1989,
to have passive restraints. Generally, that means
air bags or automatic seat belts, which fasten in
place when the occupant gets into the vehicle.
The bill stems from a federal order issued last
year that requires all new cars to have passive

restraints by 1990, unless states with at least two
thirds of the nation's population mandate use of
the manual seat belts that are already in most
vehicles.
The last remaining major opponents of the bill,
the California Automobile Dealers Association
and the Motor Car Dealers Association of South
ern California, decided last week to drop their
opposition and take a neutral position, Brown
and auto industry lobbyist Loren Smith said
yesterday.
City keeps radiation vigil
CORONADO — Concern about the potential
for radiation contamination has prompted city of
ficials to regularly monitor atmospheric radiation
levels in this resort town.
The detection system relies on several Geiger
counters installed along the city's main street,
said Arch Kelley, a retired Navy captain and
police volunteer who created the system.
Coronado is believed to be the only city in the
state that regularly checks for radiation contami
nation, officials say.
Greg Yuhas, facilities protection officer at the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission in Walnut
Creek, recalled that in 1983, batches of radioac
tive steel reinforcing rods trucked into the United
States from Mexico passed undetected through
the El Paso customs station.
