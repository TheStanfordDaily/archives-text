CLINT AT THE BAT I
The Daily softballers are a
mighty crew ... full of grace,
courage, and brawn,
and never have they had a
tougher test than against the
boys from Econ.
In the seventh and down by
four, when things did not look
good,
Up stepped the mighty editor
brandishing Louisville wood.
With two strikes gone and one
to go, Econ was due to fall, for
who would think that one could
let go by a 16-inch
softball?
Across the nation reporters
respect editors who carry
clout,
but there was no joy in
Dailyville,
for Mighty Clint had just
struck out.
