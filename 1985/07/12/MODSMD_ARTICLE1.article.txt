# Stanford monitors Spacelab 2 flight

As NASA's Spacelab 2 launches aboard
the space shuttle Discovery from Cape
Canaveral, Fla., at 1:30 p.m. PDT today,
Stanford will be monitoring the progress
and the experimentation of the mission.'
Housed in the Durand Building, the
remote space shuttle science operating
center will research and test new technolo
gies and techniques on upcoming shuttle
missions.
This project, called SUNSTAR
(Stanford University Network for Space
Telescience Applications Research), is the
first facility of its kind to operate sepa
rately from a NASA center. The center will
be used to determine the feasibility of and
research the logistics of controlling future
space missions from locations outside of
NASA's Johnson Space Center in Hous
ton.
Although Stanford engineers and re
search affiliates will not be controlling mis
sion experiments from the SUNSTAR lab,
they will receive constant video and data
communications directly from the Houston
headquarters during the spaceflight.
This information will enable the lab at
Stanford to enact full-fledged simulation,
as if it were directly controlling the mis
sion. "During the shuttle missions,
SUNSTAR will carry out its research activ
ities without any interference with the
planned timeline," said Mike Wiskerchen,
senior engineering research associate for
the project. The Stanford lab will then

compare its data with that of the Johnson
Center.
"For certain science experiments, the
SUNSTAR capability will greatly enhance
the productivity of those scientists in
volved," Wiskerchen said. If the current
SUNSTAR experiment proves successful,
the next step will be a one-day simulation,
hopefully sometime this fall.
Should both these trials succeed, future
space missions could be controlled directly
by SUNSTAR, which will be connected
on-line to NASA spacelabs.
Stanford Prof. Roger Williamson has
one of his experiments, known as Vehicle
Charging and Potential (VCAP), on
Spacelab 2. This experiment will measure
the effects on space plasma when an
electron gun is discharged from the bay of
the shuttle.
VCAP additionally will test the possibil
ity of using electron beams for communica
tions in space instead of conventional radio
antennas. Stanford students and scientists
will specifically monitor the VCAP experi
ment from SUNSTAR.
"SUNSTAR will give Stanford faculty
and students the opportunity to be dealing
with aerospace experiments without
leaving Stanford," said Joel Shurkin of
University News Service. Scientists like
Williamson will no longer have to go to
Houston to monitor their shuttle experi
ments.
Perhaps the most far-reaching benefit
for Stanford of the new SUNSTAR facility
involves its unique computer-graphics sys
tem, which combines three-dimensional

animation with state-of-the-art, computer
aided design and engineering. Center stage
for this system is an 8-foot Bosch anima
tion computer, sold to Stanford at a special
rate from the West German company.
The system enables the animator to view
the interior and exterior of objects from
any angle through its 16 "windows of
transparency." The Bosch computer also
reproduces 300,000 colors and automati
cally adjusts shadows and shadings.
The most remarkable feature of this
animation system, however, is its ability to
process all of this information simultane
ously and immediately. This time factor
makes Stanford's system more cost
effective than comparable systems, such as
those which produce the special effects in

science-fiction movies.
"The control room will have one of the
most advanced graphics and video-graphics
facilities ever put together," Wiskerchen
said.
The computer-graphics system being
employed by SUNSTAR was initially pur
chased by the Stanford Radioscience and
Telecommunications Laboratory, the Stan
ford Instructional Television Network
(SITN) and Information Technology
Services (ITS). This system will later be
available both as a research and educa
tional resource to the Stanford community.
Charlene Levering, art director of ITS,
claims that the Bosch hookup will be the

"only true three-dimensional system in the
area. . . . Stanford will be a forerunner for
other universities in this area.
"It is hard to teach a concept in still im
agery. The advent of video animation is
with us," she continued. "Sharing will al

low us to make this a campus-wide facility
available to any professor."
The computer-graphics system promises
wide applications for education, television
and research. "When we complete it, it will
be one of the most versatile tools that engi
neering has ever had," Wiskerchen said.
Surgeons could realistically simulate
operations with the animation
computer, both to watch the ef
fects of their surgery from angles
unafforded in the operating room
and to provide more useful surgi
cal instruction to students.
Engineers, by putting their
designs onto the computer, could
simulate what could happen to
their creations — whether a
bridge, space station or silicon
chip — then measure the

processes and predict possible
consequences.
The quality of television and
film animation could also im
prove tremendously and decrease
in cost with similar computer
graphic systems.
On future shuttle missions,
direct data from the shuttle will
run through the graphics system
to enable scientists in the
SUNSTAR control lab to observe
space experiments as if they were
actually standing near the shuttle
in space.
