# The
						Tresidder 'swindle'
## 
### 
I realize even as I begin to write this that the
whole issue of the Coffee House contract being
awarded to Saga is probably beginning to get a little
tired. Even so, there are parts which perhaps merit
one more look. So far, the majority of student
opinion, like the majority of press, about the
takeover has been negative. Tresidder officials, not
surprisingly, has made glowing reports of the wis
dom and fairness of their decision to hand all
Tresidder Memorial Union food services over to
Saga.
What is suprising are some of the things written
about the takeover by people supposedly not on the
payroll of either Saga or Tresidder. One of these in
particular that comes to mind is a needlessly conde
scending and startlingly uninformed editorial in the
July 2 edition of The Daily entitled "Coffee House
Beyond ASSU."
The editorial seemed to be asserting that Saga
deserved a chance to run the Coffee House and that
the uproar about the takeover was coming mainly
from some disgruntled incompetents currently run
ning the Coffee House and perhaps a few power
happy student senators. The piece concluded by
advising the aforementioned malcontents to grow
up, abandon their "fruitless protests" and
"unrealistic plans to open an 'alternative' Coffee
House" and instead make sure that Saga does what
it should.
There are a few things that the authors of "Coffee
House Beyond ASSU" do not seem to understand
very clearly. For example, the editorial implied that
the protests about the Coffee House come from a
small minority of people who are closely related
with either the Coffee House or the ASSU. It might
be worthwhile here to point out that a "save the
Coffee House" petition urging Tresidder to keep
the student-run Coffee House got 2,500 signatures.
That is something like 10 percent of the Stanford
community, if you count students, faculty and staff.
The editorial also implied that students are not
competent to run a business such as the Coffee
House and that a corporation like Saga could surely
do a better job. What "Coffee House Beyond
ASSU" forgot to mention is that the Coffee House
has been turning a profit the last two years, despite
the fact that it was paying extortionate rent to
Tresidder. Or that the student-run Coffee House's
sales are twice those of the previous contractor. Or
that the Coffee House expected to be operating
completely in the black within two years.

Which brings us to the swindle. What the new
contract means, despite any promises to involve stu
dents in "all levels of decision making," is that any
say that the students may have in the operation of
Tresidder is entirely dependent upon the goodwill
of Saga and Tresidder management. Ms. Oppen
heim and Co. have been careful to point out that
TMU is a "community union" and that therefore
the students are not entitled to have any control
over what goes on there. What they have been less
eager to point out is that Stanford students shelled
out 20 percent of the cost of Tresidder.

Saga, for its part, has promised not to make any
major changes in the Coffee House. While this may
have been out of the goodness of their hearts, it is
also possible that Saga realizes that the Coffee
House does a lot of business, and they don't want to
be too quick to make a lot of random changes.
Which brings us to the other swindle.
Five years ago, the ASSU took over the then
ailing Coffee House and with a great deal of work
and sacrifice (such as a $3.50 starting salary) turned
it into a successful business. But then Saga comes
along, and out the students go. So Saga gets a place
that is already a success, and the students wind up
holding the bag to the tune of $30,000.
Whether or not any protests will prove "fruitless"
remains to be seen. The "unrealistic" plans for an
alternative Coffee House, however, do not seem so
unrealistic considering that it has already been done
successfully once before. But whatever the plans,
they would stand a much better chance if Stanford
students are not used for start-up capital for the
next conglomerate that comes onto campus.
