## SDI benefits only business

Defense Initiative.)
Myth number four: Tremen
dous civilian spinoffs will result
from the SDI research and tech
nology and will be used for the
benefit of all.

VIEWPOINT

An April 11, 1985, article in the
International Herald Tribune ad
vanced the idea that the SDI
holds the promise of "peaceful in
ventions." Through the develop
ment of "death-ray" technology,
society will supposedly benefit
from safer fruits (irradiated and
insect-free), healthier forests
(cleansed of acid rain) and inno
vative medical research ushering
in new optical instruments and
viral blood tests.
If the prospects for such scien
tific breakthroughs as a secondary
effect are so great, wouldn't the
civilian spinoffs of funds invested
directly be immeasurably
greater?
Contrary to the claim that soci
ety as a whole will reap the fruits
of SDI spending and advances,
the reality is that the revenues
that result from military contracts
accrue to the largest corporations
in American society. In 1984 the
nation's largest military contrac
tors enjoyed a 25 percent return
on equity (the measure of after
tax profitability), whereas the

average return for all other
manufacturing companies was
around 12.8 percent.
Having uncovered some of the
myths surrounding the SDI proj
ect, a few concluding questions
are in order. One of the most
piercing inquiries has been posed
by Richard Butler, the Australian
ambassador to the United Na
tions Multilateral Conference on
Disarmament, when he asked on
March 8, 1985, "If you want a
defense against ballistic missiles,
why not destroy the missiles
themselves, rather than creating a
shield with less than 100 percent
effectiveness against them?"
Or better yet, why not actually
negotiate toward arms control
and disarmament? It would be a
lot cheaper to take seriously some
of the recent Soviet and Chinese
proposals for negotiations than to
pursue the path to ever-greater
nuclear escalation. But trust and
arms talks are not as profitable
for the sector of U.S. society that
benefits from cost-plus military
contracts. Whose interest is the
SDI catering to, anyway?
Could the myths propagated in
the name of the SDI actually rep
resent false promises designed to
assuage public fears about the
possibility of a nuclear war break
ing out and destroying all life on
earth? Can we afford complicity
in such a destabilizing, inequi
table and ineffective program?
