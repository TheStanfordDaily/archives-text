## Clint turns to the cloth in 'Pale Rider' 
### DAVID ALMOND 
Clint Eastwood's newest
movie, "Pale Rider," which he
produced, directed and starred in,
concerns a group of independent
miners who have staked a small
but valuable claim in California
during the gold rush of the
1850 s.
At the beginning of the movie, a
bunch of marauders hired by a
rich, corporate miner named
LeHood raids these miners' settle
ment in an attempt to scare them
off their lucrative plot. Immedi
ately one's sympathies lie with
these humble, sincere, hard
working folk who only want to
make honest lives for themselves
and their families.
After the raid, their informal
leader, Holland Barrett (Michael
Moriarty), dispirited but not
defeated, rides into town to buy
supplies. There he encounters
more of LeHood's hoods who
beat him up until "guess who"
shows up. The mysterious
stranger makes short work of the
thugs, and a grateful Barrett
invites the stranger back to stay
with him and Sarah Wheeler
(Carrie Snodgrass) and her
daughter, Megan.
The stranger, it turns out, is not
only capable of beating up bad
guys, he is also able to perform
baptisms: Eastwood has turned

priest. From here on a series
of conflicts ensues between
LeHood's gang and the miners,
and while things go from bad to
worse for the miners, their faith in
the "preacher" (i.e. God [i.e.
Eastwood]) keeps them going.

The plot of "Pale Rider" is
fairly predictable, and at any
stage of the film one is more or
less sure how things will turn out.
Part of this predictability is simply
Eastwood's style, but it also
results from the fact that it bor
rows so much from other movies.
Elements of other westerns such
as "The Magnificent Seven,''
"The Shootist" and, especially,
"Shane" are drawn upon heavily.

More recent films like "Places in
the Heart" and "Country" also
have as their theme the conflict
between the virtuous,
independent-minded landowner
and evil big business/govern
ment.

The religious twist is new.
Having Eastwood play a
priest/gunfighter might work, ex
cept that his role as a priest is
never really developed. There are
a fair number of religious refer
ences and some interesting Chris
tian symbolism, but Eastwood, by
nature, is not much of a forgiving
soul. In fact, despite his divinity,
he drinks whiskey and at one
point makes love to Sarah.

In short, the wish to attribute a
sort of divine right to the small
settlers might be legitimate, but
making Eastwood both a gun
slinger and a man of the cloth
seems an absurd way to do it, es
pecially because his role as a

priest is almost entirely ignored.
Most of the characters and
relationships in "Pale Rider"
remain two-dimensional and un
developed. While this is not out
of the ordinary for an Eastwood
film, or for westerns in general,
the movie has a way of showing us
the development of a relationship
or character, but then cutting it
short. Barrett wishes to marry
Sarah, she accepts, and that's it.

We learn a little about them as in
dividuals, but we hardly ever get a
glimpse of what goes on between
them. Likewise, the film attempts
to examine the struggles of enter
ing womanhood that Megan ex
periences, but its treatment is
brief, naive and stereotyped.
"Pale Rider" tries to do too
much at the same time; it tries to
examine too many characters and
interactions. We are left feeling
shortchanged in a sense, wishing
that it had concentrated on one or
two solid elements rather than
having sprawled its attention to so
many.
Yet despite these criticisms, the
bulk of "Pale Rider" is good, old
fashioned western action
adventure. It is definitely
Eastwood, and although it is
more than just a westernized
"Dirty Harry," it isn't much
more. If you enjoy Clint
Eastwood films and don't mind
his attempts to create interesting
characters with depth, which most
Clint Eastwood fans probably
won't, then go see "Pale Rider."
If, however, you are at all both
ered by Eastwood's egocentricity,
films that give shallow treatment
to their characters or westerns
that are overly sentimental, then
see something else.
