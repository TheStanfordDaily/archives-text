## Supertramp, where you bound? 
### 
It was with some strong
preconceptions that I approached
the new Supertramp release,
"Brother Where You Bound."
Not only had I heard the safe but
refreshing "Cannonball" on the
radio, but I was well aware of the
fact that this is a critical album for
the now four-member British art
rock group.
The departure of Roger
Hodgson and the relative com
mercial success of his first solo
release, "The Eye Of The
Storm," left Supertramp without
an LP and in a cliche music indus
try bind. In a time when past mu
sical efforts count very little in
label executives' eyes, Rick
Davies and friends had to justify
their existence as a band. Usually
this pressure causes bands to cling
to pop trends and formulae out of
financial insecurity.
And unfortunately, this tactic
usually succeeds — in return for
selling their artistic souls, the Bill
board Beezelbub grants them a
little more time on top. They
eventually bow out with full
pockets, albeit empty con

sciences.
Thus I was pleasantly surprised
to find Supertramp rising to the
challenge of losing one of its
major vocalists, keyboardists and
songwriters. Instead of panicking
into mediocrity, the band has
used this challenge to produce
quality material.
Davies takes over the vocals,
his usual bellowing blues style
augmented with a smooth, low
growl that I'm sure was always
there but not fully realized until
now. Of course, his effeminate,
"Goodbye Stranger" whines
remain as cute and effective as
ever. John Helliwell's catchy,
pop-blues sax is pleasantly ex
ploited throughout the album to a
degree unmatched in the band's
recent years. His showcase num
ber is the upbeat "Still In Love,"
while the other members, drum
mer Bob Seibenberg and bassist
Dougie Thompson (who?),
remain faceless but competent.
The album opens with the
polished cruiser "Cannonball,"
which instigates the sax con
tagion. The fun swing tone lasts

through a reed bridge to "Still In
Love," after which the mood
changes to one of introspection —
obligatory on any comeback al
bum — with "No Inbetween."
This cut, the first to have any
significant lyrical value, refer
ences the dissension that changed
the band with a slightly bitter
resolve, but in a manner so slick
that it makes one question the
songs sincerity. Here one notices
that so far Davies has adequately
captured the essence of
Hodgson's percussive piano style.
This in itself is no great technical
feat, but essential to the success
of Supertramp remaining Super
tramp in the ears of its listeners.
The calm regret of the band's
past turmoil then crescendos into
an angry, sarcastic criticism of po
litical promises in "Better Days."
This is certainly not an original
rock ideology, but it is freshly
presented here — either despite,
or partly because of, the inclusion
of sound effects: recordings of fa
mous leaders. The juxtaposition
of their political pabulum and hot
air with the free sounds of a
jeering saxaphone releases some

thing intrinsically biting in blues
jazz, something similar to the
message of Pink Floyd's early ma
terial.
The ghost of Floyd is also res
surected when side two launches
an epic in genuine "Fool's
Overture" fashion, the "world
leader" sound effects opening this
half as they ended the first. This
new magnum opus, which Super
tramp has needed for a long time,
could very well become one of
its classics, if it is not labeled
pretentious and overbearing first.
It has all the requisites. It is the
title track ("Brother where you
bound" is also the chorus) and is
well over 16 minutes in length. It
employs the mighty David Gil
mour himself in the only area of
instrumentation that Supertramp
has ever lacked — guitar. It
progresses through discrete but
vaguely related movements, in
cluding one aleatoric, dissonant
section that makes King Crimson
seem like a predictable I-IV-V
band (well, almost). Finally, its
subject is the topic few bands can
afford not to mention — impend
ing nuclear War.

Although the lyrics match the
weight of the music in spirit and
intent, they unfortunately fail to
tell us anything new about the
condition of modern society vis
a-vis its capacity for, and appar
ent bent for, complete self
destruction. The fear of a
totalitarian alternative is clumsily
metaphored with a "red cloud"
from which "running" is the only
escape. But the song's speedy,
runaway coda leads nicely into
the slow, home-sweet-home
flavor of "Ever Open Door."
This last track is certainly the
least notable of the six, but it adds
a feeling of completeness to the
whole album, if nothing else.
All in all, the album is a well
produced and energetic, if not to
tally original, work. With
"Brother Where You Bound,"
Supertramp has passed a vital
test, demonstrating that Roger
got the short end of the stick
when he decided to call it quits
two years ago. I have a feeling
we'll be hearing more from Su
pertramp — a pleasant thought.
