## Athletic Dept. undergoes renovation 
### MARK ZEIGLER Editorial staff 
About all that was left of the
first floor of the Stanford Athletic
Department earlier this month,
was, as Assoc. Athletic Direc
tor Alan Cummings put it,"the
four supporting walls and a few
columns supporting the second
floor."
There were no desks, no
phones, no file cabinets — noth
ing but walls and columns. But by
the end of this month, the first
floor should have its desks and
phones and file cabinets back. It
also will have an entirely new
look.
The first floor is being com
pletely renovated, following in
the footsteps of a second floor
renovation a few years ago.
Though most of the same offices
will remain on the first floor, they
will be in new places and sur
rounded by new wails. They will
also all feed into one main en
trance, a two-story rotunda that
will be decorated with trophies,
plaques and other athletic
memorabilia.
For this, the Athletic Depart
ment can thank a donor who has
wished to remain anonymous and
a contractor who, as Cummings
said, "is very skilled in doing a lot
of quality work in a very short
period of time."
Probably the biggest problem
in renovating a building like the
Athletic Department doesn't in
volve the physical changes them
selves, but the time constraints.
"We had a very short time win
dow in which to work," Cum

mings said, explaining that after
the academic year ends, the de
partment has until early August
before football and other fall
sports begin preseason practice.
"We got everybody out, and we
began gutting the first floor of the
building by June 28," Cummings
continued. "And we hope to be
back in the building by Aug. 1,
and the contractor thinks we
might be back in sooner than
that."

Since the entire first floor
needed to be emptied at once,
entire offices were moved to
other locations on campus. To say
the least, the Athletic Depart
ment used all its resources when
searching for temporary office
space.
The Sports Information Office
presently is located in a room in
the ground floor of Maples
Pavilion. The accounting offices
moved upstairs to offices tempo

rarily vacated by vacationing
football coaches. The mailroom is
in the second-floor hallway. The
ticket offices are in Room 350 of
Encina Gym. And the main
offices, including those of Cum
mings and Athletic Director
Andy Geiger, are in the visiting
team's locker room in Stanford
Stadium.
The man behind the pick-up
and-go moving was Move Co
ordinator Gary Migdol, an assis

tant sports information director.
"It was kind of hectic, kind of
confusing," Migdol said of the
week-long move. "It basically in
volved getting people to move to
a temporary office with the ma
terials they'll need for the next
month."
Cummings said the reason be
hind the renovation is the need
for better use of the space in the
Athletic Department building,
constructed in the 19205.
"It's a handsome, fabulous
building from the exterior," he
said. "But like so many buildings
built in that period, there was lots
of space that's not very well used.
As we got bigger, we suffered
from this. But now we'll have nice
aesthetics and a good, functional
use of space."
The general plan for the Ath
letic Department now will be to
have the general offices on the
first floor, and coaches' offices on
the second. As one walks into the
renovated first floor, offices such
as Geiger's, the Buck Club and
the development office will be lo
cated to the right. To the left will
be the ticket, accounting and
marketing offices.
The rotunda will be in the cen
ter of the building and will extend
into the second floor. Cummings
said it will be used to "highlight
the athletic heritage at Stanford."
"With the improvement in the
use of the space, there's no ques
tion we're indebted to the
donor," Cummings said. "We
couldn't be happier with this
generous donation."
