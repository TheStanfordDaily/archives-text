## Card boasts top students 
### MARK ZEIGLER Editorial staff 
Stanford scholarship athletes
are ranked first in the Pacific 10
Conference when it comes to
academics, according to a con
fidential, Pac-10-approved sur
vey.
The survey, given to about 30
students at each Pac-10 school,
was conducted to determine how
many of the conference's athletes
would be above the newly

proposed NCAA minimun stand
ards for freshman athletes — a
700 aggregate Scholastic Apti
tude Test (SAT) score and a 2.0
grade point average (GPA).

on the SAT was above 1000 and
their median GPA was 3.69.

-44 We're pleased to be No. 1,"
Geiger told the Palo Alto
Weekly. "But the gap (between
first and last) is a monstrous
surprise. At one school, 22 of 26
athletes (surveyed) would not
have qualified (under the pro
posed NCAA regulations)."
