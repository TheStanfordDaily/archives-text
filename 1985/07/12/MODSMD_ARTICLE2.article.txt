# Challenges nuclear policy
## Johnson appeals his suit 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Editorial staff 
with wire reports
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San
Francisco heard oral arguments Wednesday on
Stanford staff member Clifford Johnson's pending
lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of
computer-controlled launching of nuclear missiles.
Johnsons suit claims that launch-on-warning ca
pability — a weapons system providing for the auto
matic launching of nuclear missiles should electronic
sensors indicate the nation is under attack — is un
constitutional. He contends that launching missiles

is tantamount to a declaration of war and that this
violates the Constitutional provision stating that
"The Congress shall have power ... to declare war"
and"The president shall be . . . commander in chief
of the armed forces."
Johnson, a manager at Information Technology
Systems, originally filed the suit against Secretary of
Defense Caspar Weinberger in 1984, but a district
court judge ruled that the suit raised military and
political issues outside the court's jurisdiction.
Johnson appealed, and Wednesday a three-judge
panel queried Claudia Brisson, Johnson s attorney,
and Asst. U.S. Attorney John Penrose for about 15
minutes each on the suit.

Penrose again raised the question of whether the
court was in a position to make a decision on the
case. He argued that the issue was a military and
diplomatic one that was not susceptible to litigation
in a court of law. In addition, launch on warning is
not a declaration of war, he said.
Judge Warrren Ferguson disagreed, saying,
"Inferentially it is."
Brisson said the suit raises constitutional ques
tions that are pertinent to the court. A president's
order to implement the system would amount to
"delegating his power to a computer . . . removing
his ability to exercise discretion," she said.
She also said the policy "is not within the control
of Congress" and "unconstitutionally surrenders
Congress' powers to declare war."
The Pentagon has denied that the United States
has a policy of launch on warning, but has refused to
say whether the technology is being developed.
Johnson said launch on warning "might be imple
mented, [but] the presumption is that it is not."
Johnson added that there exists a "very strong
threat" that launch on warning will be implemented
in the future, since the proposed "Star Wars"
missile defense system would require the system.
"I'm trying to stop that," he said.
Johnson said it was "a very favorable hearing"
because the "judges focused on the central constitu
tional issue" of whether launching missiles amounts
to a declaration of war.
Johnson said he expects the judges to issue a deci
sion in three weeks to six months.
"If they (the appellate judges) vote in my favor,
the next step is to send it back to district court for a
regular trial," Johnson said. Otherwise, the next
step would be to appeal to the Supreme Court, he
said. But if this decision goes against him, Johnson
indicated he would consider the judges' opinion
before going to the high court.
Johnson added that he was pleased by the recep
tion given his case in the Wednesday hearing. "The
clear message ... is that this is a very serious case,"
he said.
However, he remains pessimistic on the eventual
outcome, saying, "The judiciary is very reluctant to
get their feet wet on nuclear issues."
