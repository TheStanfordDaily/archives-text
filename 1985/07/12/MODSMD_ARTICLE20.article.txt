lost another.
Arizona State fired Weinhauer
earlier this week, literally hours
after he returned from Australia,
where he was Stanford Coach
Tom Davis' assistant.
In three seasons at Arizona
State, Weinhauer's teams were
plagued by two losing seasons.
Gary Close, assistant coach at
Stanford who was with him on the
Australia trip, was more
"disappointed" than "surprised"

at Weinhauer's dismissal.
"I'm not surprised â€” I'd heard
that they were thinking about it,"
Close said yesterday. "But I'm
disappointed. I think he's a good
guy and a good coach. And to be
honest, I don't think they
(Arizona State) handled the sit
uation very well."
Close, who wtfs an assistant
coach at Arizona State under Ned
Wulk from 1980-82, said Wein
hauer kept his dubious job situa
tion "mostly to himself" on the
Australia trip. "A credit to him,
he didn't let it bother him," Close
said.
