# Comp Sci major possible by 1986
## 
### JONATHAN PAUL Staff writer 
The Computer Science De
partment is designing an un
dergraduate major scheduled
to take effect by the fall of
1986.
Though the program has not
yet been formally approved,
Jim Gibbons, dean of the
School of Engineering, has
predicted that an undergradu
ate major in computer science
is "going to be an actuality/'
Nils Nilsson, chairman of the
Department of Computer Sci
ence, echoed Gibbons' com
ments, but emphasized that the
program still needs to be ap
proved by department faculty.
"The general sentiment
among the faculty is that it is
about time for Stanford to
have an undergraduate
major,"' Nilsson said, but
added that the "faculty will
want to consider the impact on
(departmental) resources . . .
and whether additional re
sources will be provided by the
University."
The tentative structure of
the proposed major will re
quire students to complete ap
proximately 85 units of course
work. However, this fall the
Computer Science Department
will move from the School of
Humanities and Sciences to the
School of Engineering. The
move will make computer sci
ence majors subject to the 20-
unit engineering breadth re

quirement, upping the pro
posed major s total of required
units to 105.
The addition of the breadth
requirement will make the
work load for the computer
science major "similar to elec
trical engineering," according
to Anil Gangoli, a graduate
student in computer science
here and a former Stanford un
dergradute.
Gangoli explained that
"people will be forced to
choose rather early" whether
or not they want to be com
puter science majors and that
the requirements "will not
leave them much freedom."
The Computer Science De
partment is also pushing for
the School of Engineering to
include psychology in its list of
courses which satisfy its science
requirement.
Both Nilsson and Gibbons
have spoken of the possibility
of offering a joint electrical en
gineering and computer sci
ence degree and feel that even
tually other joint degrees in
volving computer science
might be offered as well.
Currently, there is no formal
undergraduate computer sci
ence major. Instead many
would-be computer science
students major in logic of for
mal systems, offered by the
Philosophy Department, or
mathematical sciences, which
