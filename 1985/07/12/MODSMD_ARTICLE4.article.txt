## Los Gatos blaze Fire 60 percent controlled 
### 
LOS GATOS — The 4,500 residents who fled
their homes as wildfires approached this week
started returning to their neighborhoods yesterday
to find out if the flames — still only 60 percent con
tained — destroyed their homes.
As they did, Gov. George Deukmejian toured the
area and offered a $10,000 reward for the arrest
and conviction of the arsonist responsible for what
he called a tragic event for residents and firefighters
assigned to the blaze.
Crews had surveyed the hills for safe areas, and
seven neighborhoods were reopened by noon.
"We're not going to let people go into areas
where there is still a danger," said Jim Bliss of the
California Department of Forestry at a fire
control center in Los Gatos, about 20 miles south
east of Stanford. "We have determined areas that
are totally safe, and we are letting them go home."
Some residents were determined to get back to
their houses without waiting for permission.
One woman was arrested Wednesday when she
tried to drive her sports car back to her house on
Mozart Drive. The California Highway Patrol re

ported Donalie Schumaker, 49, was taken into cus
tody for investigation of two counts of assault and
one count of resisting an officer. CHP Sgt. Greg
Manuel said that after she was advised she couldn't
complete the trip, her car brushed an officer's leg,
and she rammed a patrol car.
Firefighters throughout Northern California took
advantage of a sudden shift in hot, dry summer
weather that aided their efforts to battle eight out
of-control fires and one other smouldering site. At
least 35 homes have been destroyed and 73,800
acres have been charred, according to state and
federal fire officials.
The Los Gatos fire, which raged into the steep
Santa Cruz mountains, was fought with the help of
six air tankers yesterday and brought 20 percent un
der control. Efforts focused on containing the fire
and keeping it away from Loma Prieta Mountain,
where Bliss said there are five-mile stretches that
would be unreachable by fire crews.
More than 1,000 fires burned over the past two
weeks in the United States and Canada.
