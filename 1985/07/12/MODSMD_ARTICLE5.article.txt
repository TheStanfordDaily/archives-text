# Senate approves bill on apartheid
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The
Senate, anxious to condemn
the "evil of apartheid," voted
80-12 last night to slap limited
sanctions on racially segre
gated South Africa.
The lopsided roll call
marked the first time the
Republican-controlled Senate
has recommended such action
against the government in
Pretoria. It amounted to a
clear statement, as well, that
President Reagan's low-key
policy of "constructive engage
ment" does not go far enough
in expressing American rejec
tion of South African racial
policies.
Approval for the bill came
after GOP conservatives ended
a four-day filibuster, and then

failed in the final hours of
debate to prevail on a series of
last-minute changes.
The House has approved
legislation containing tougher
sanctions, and the differences
between the two measures will
have to be reconciled before a
final bill is sent to Reagan.
There has been no word
from the White House on
whether Reagan would sign
any measure imposing sanc
tions.
The Senate-passed measure
would ban the export of com
puter equipment used to en
force the apartheid laws, block
bank loans to the South
African government and end
American commercial nuclear
assistance.
