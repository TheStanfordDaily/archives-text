Beirut boycott folly, envoy says
WASHINGTON — Lebanon's ambassador said yesterday that
U.S.-imposed sanctions against the Beirut airport play into the
hands of Middle East terrorist groups because the sanctions hurt
America's friends who are innocent of wrongdoing in the recent
hijacking.
Abdallah Bouhabib accused the Reagan Administration of
taking action against Lebanon because it hesitated to act against
those responsible for terrorism in the wake of the hijacking of
TWA Flight 847, during which 39 Americans were held hostage
for 17 days. He said "Lebanon is a theater" where outside forces
play out their violence and terrorist acts.
Bouhabib said Lebanon would cooperate with the United
States in trying to apprehend and interrogate suspects in the
hijacking, in which one hostage was killed. But he said Lebanese
authorities don't know the identity of the hijackers, and he
doesn't think the Americans do either.
The administration.announced after the hostages were
released that it wanted the airport closed because it had become
a haven for terrorists. It banned all American flights to Lebanon
and flights by Middle East Airlines and other aircraft from
Lebanon to the United States. U.S. officials also said they would
discourage other nations from using the Beirut airport.
There has been virtually no international support for the
American action, however, and some Arab nations are talking
about a counter-boycott against U.S. airlines. The administration
in recent days has indicated it is having second thoughts by sof
tening its criticism of Lebanon.
Kuwait bombs kill 9, injure 56
KUWAIT — Bombs exploded in two popular cafes in Kuwait
City yesterday, killing nine people and injuring 56 others, police
and witnesses said. A security official said the explosions were
caused by terrorists.
Local residents said the first blast jolted the al-Sharq seaside
cafe as families gathered on the eve of the Moslem holy day
today, and the second explosion occurred in the densely pop
ulated Salmiyeh district.
No one claimed responsibility for the bombings.
Authorities closed Kuwait International Airport to outgoing
flights and security forces sealed the areas around the two blasts
and detoured civilian traffic, witnesses said. Police cleared a
public park near the cafe, apparently for fear of more explosions.
"The cafe was crowded at the time of the explosion," said one
bystander near the al-Sharq cafe, speaking on condition he was
not named. "Whoever planted the bomb in the cafe couldn't
have picked a worse time. The blast sent chairs flying, and mut
ilated bodies and a big blood patch covered the place."
Police: Bomb sank Greenpeace ship
AUCKLAND, New Zealand — Police said yesterday that a
bomb caused the explosion that sank the Greenpeace flagship
Rainbow Warrior and killed one of its crew of conservationists.
Prime Minister David Lange said the bombing Wednesday
night was a"a major criminal act with ... terrorist overtones."
The environmentalists said they were determined to go ahead
with a four-month anti-nuclear campaign in the South Pacific and
would welcome any offer of a substitute ship from New Zealand.
Lange said his government would consider suggestions from
the public that the government send a military vessel to a French
Polynesian nuclear test site in place of Rainbow Warrior. He did
not elaborate. .
Sobbing survivors gathered at Marsden Wharf yesterday to
gaze at the badly damaged ship, joined by a steady stream of
Auckland residents offering help.
Detective Superintendent Allan Galbraith said the double ex
plosion made a 6-by-8-foot hole in the hull of the Rainbow War
rior, which the 14-year-old Greenpeace organization used in
protests of nuclear testing and dumping and the killing of whales,
seals and dolphins.
Ship's photographer Fernando Pereira was killed, and
Galbraith said investigators were treating his death as a
homicide. Twelve other people, including two Americans, were
on board during the explosions but escaped unhurt. Pereira was a
Portuguese-born Dutch citizen.
Nicaraguans run from draft
WASHINGTON — A Pennsylvania congressman said yester
day that there has been a recent surge of draft-age young men
fleeing from Nicaragua and settling in refugee camps across the
border in Honduras.
Rep. Don Ritter (R-Pa.), reporting on a just-completed visit to
Central America, said that in conversations with the refugees he
was told they were "extremely opposed to getting drafted and
were died-in-the-wool opponents to the Sandinista government
(of Nicaragua) and what it stood for."
"In fact, some of them were talking about a 20,000-person
march on Washington," Ritter said, adding that he did not know
if they were aware of the difficulties such a cross-border march
might pose.
Ritter was joined at a meeting with reporters by Rep. George
Brown (D-Calif.), who said that he came away from the trip with
less opposition than before to direct U.S. military aid to the U.S.-
backed Contra guerrillas combating Nicaragua's Sandinista gov
ernment. He said, however, that he has not firmly made up his
mind on the issue.

Nicaraguans run from draft
WASHINGTON — A Pennsylvania congressman said yester
day that there has been a recent surge of draft-age young men
fleeing from Nicaragua and settling in refugee camps across the
border in Honduras.
Rep. Don Ritter (R-Pa.), reporting on a just-completed visit to
Central America, said that in conversations with the refugees he
was told they were "extremely opposed to getting drafted and
were died-in-the-wool opponents to the Sandinista government
(of Nicaragua) and what it stood for."
"In fact, some of them were talking about a 20,000-person
march on Washington," Ritter said, adding that he did not know
if they were aware of the difficulties such a cross-border march
might pose.
Ritter was joined at a meeting with reporters by Rep. George
Brown (D-Calif.), who said that he came away from the trip with
less opposition than before to direct U.S. military aid to the U.S.-
backed Contra guerrillas combating Nicaragua's Sandinista gov
ernment. He said, however, that he has not firmly made up his
mind on the issue.
