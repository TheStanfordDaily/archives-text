CIA clerk spied for Ghana
WASHINGTON — The FBI brought
espionage charges yesterday against a relative of
the leader of Ghana and a female CIA clerk
whom he allegedly wooed into turning over
secrets about U.S. spy operations in the African
nation.
FBI Director William Webster said the alleged
spying over the past year-and-a-half was un
earthed by the CIA itself and that the CIA
cooperated in the bureau's investigation.
In court papers, the FBI said the clerk, Sharon
Scranage, 29, of King George, Va., confessed her
role during interrogation by FBI agents at CIA
headquarters Monday through Wednesday. She
was arrested yesterday morning.
The Ghanaian man, Michael Agbotui Sous
soudis, 39, was arrested Wednesday night at a
hotel in suburban Springfield, Va., where he had
been led to believe he would have another ren
dezvous with Scranage, the FBI said.
According to Justice Department sources,
Soussoudis, a married, self-employed business
consultant, and Scranage, a divorced, $22,000-a
-year clerk, became lovers in Ghana's capital of
Accra in 1983.
An FBI affidavit charged that the liaison
allowed the Ghanaians to obtain the names of
CIA agents stationed in their country and of
Ghanaian dissidents who were secretly cooperat
ing with the CIA.

'Classic Coke' to return
ATLANTA — The top officials of Coca-Cola
Co. said yesterday they are bringing back the rec
ipe that made Coke the world's most popular soft
drink because they "clearly misread" the public's
attachment to it.
They also denied that the return of the old for
mula was prompted by a failure of the 11-week
old new formula, or that the return of "Coca-
Cola Classic" had been secretly planned all
along.
Around the country, the people who bottle and
distribute Coke greeted the old new formula with
a mixture of relief, disagreement and cynicism.
The old formula for Coke, which remained
fundamentally unchanged for 99 years, was
replaced in April with a new taste which the com
pany said was "smoother, bolder and rounder."
The company said then, and the officials repeated
yesterday, that the new formula was consistently
preferred in taste tests.
But many cola drinkers rebelled. Groups
formed to lobby for the return of the old formula
and Coke received thousands of telephone calls
and letters.
On Monday, Coke's leaders decided to market
the old formula again, Goizueta said. The deci
sion was announced Wednesday.
