## The 						Stanford Daily Making a list 
### 
Lists are things that seem to follow us from birth. When
we're little, we're told there's a big guy in a red suit living
somewhere north of Winnipeg who's ''making a list and
checking it twice." In school we found we were ranked ac
cording to a number less than four called the GPA. Lists
are such a topic of controversy that an Irish brewing com
pany compiles a list of world records to settle any such ar
guments that might arise at the local pub.
But several lists in particular that we've run across this
week have caught our attention.
President Reagan, in an address to the American Bar
Association, came up with a list of five nations he termed
"a confederation of terrorist states." The lucky five: Iran,
Libya, North Korea, Cuba and Nicaragua.
What has naming this list of "outlaw states run by the
strangest collection of misfits, Looney Tunes and squalid
criminals since the advent of the Third Reich" accom
plished? Not a lot, except to have Fidel Castro call Reagan
"a madman, an imbecile, a bum." Obviously a great way to
promote world peace and harmony.
It has also created a bit of controversy. The U.S. State
Department has its own top five, one that leaves out North
Korea and Nicaragua, substituting Syria and South Yemen.
Since Syria is our buddy this week because of the hostage
drama and all, and because practically no one, including,
probably, Reagan and half the State Department, knows
where South Yemen is (it's actually more east than south of
Yemen), the switch is understandable.
The difference sort of reminds one of wire service polls
choosing the national champion of college football after the
New Year's Day bowl games. The only way to settle it
seems to be a playoff. Seed the top eight terrorist states
into the playoffs and have them attack each other.
Picture the finals: Iran vs. Libya. The winner: whoever
kills the enemy's leader. Kind of like capture the flag. They
occupy themselves attacking each other, and the world
would be rid of either Colonel Mohammar Khadafy or the
Ayatollah Khomeni. And American tourists could sleep in
safety.
There have been some other dumb lists this week.
George Gallup just released his poll of voter preferences in
the 1988 Democratic presidential race. In July 1985. Three
years, four months before the election. For the record, Sen.
Edward Kennedy leads Sen. Gary Hart and 16 other possi
ble candidates.
In case you're wondering, Vice President George Bush
led Sen. Robert Dole and former Sen. Howard Baker on
the Republican side in last week's poll. We're sure those
numbers are outdated by now, though.
And the San Francisco Chronicle yesterday printed
"Madonna at a Glance, Chronology of a Crisis," a four-day
list of the main events in the race to publish nude
photographs of the popular singer. There are five entries
for July 10, including "New York Post prints naked-from
the-waist-up picture of Madonna." Accompanying the
Chronicle story: its own naked-from-the-waist-up picture
of Madonna.
Finally, there is the starting lineup for the National
League All-Star Team. Included are Graig Nettles, the San
Diego Padres .239-hitting third baseman, and Darryl
Strawberry, the New York Mets outfielder who is batting
.221. Never mind that Montreal's Tim Wallach and St.
Louis' Jack Clark are both having better seasons. Oh well.
At least it's one list that means something. And it won't
endanger world peace.
