Most fires under control
The largest fire in the state still out of control
— a 28,780-acre blaze south of California's
scenic Big Sur — was 50 percent contained yes
terday, but U.S. Forest Service spokesman Frank
Fetsher said it probably wouldn't be contained
before today.
A dense pall of smoke hampered firefighting
efforts there, he said.
About 15 miles to the south, the Gorda fire
north of San Luis Obispo was 95 percent con
tained after burning 6,800 acres.
Elsewhere in the state, 11 fires were contained,
controlled or extinguished over the weekend.
Among those contained was the Los Gatos blaze
which scorched 13,900 acres in the Santa Cruz
mountains, sent 4,500 people fleeing and
consumed 20 houses.
The city of Ojai, 70 miles northwest of Los An
geles, threw a thank-you party for the firefighters
who kept a 116,000-acre fire out of the town of
7,000 people.
Residents offered off-duty crews the use of
swimming pools, set out mounds of ice cream and
other food for the firefighters and brought in
stand-up comedians and bands.
Ng still faces Canadian trial
CALGARY, Alberta — Charles Ng, linked by
U.S. authorities to the grisly slayings discovered
at a rural Calaveras County cabin, was refused
bail yesterday by i Canadian court.
Ng also chose a jury trial on charges he faces in
Canada, a move that is expected to keep him in
that country for at least six months.

Judge Edward Adolphe of the Provincial Court
ordered Ng to return to that court Sept. 12 for a
preliminary hearing.
If Adolphe decides the evidence warrants a
trial, Ng's lawyers said he probably will be back
in court in October to enter a plea.
Ng, who is named on California warrants
charging two counts of murder, two of kidnap
ping, three of false imprisonment and one of bur
glary, is thought by police to be the accomplice of
Leonard Lake.
Meanwhile, U.S. authorities continue to collect
evidence to justify a request to extradite Ng.
Canadian authorities have said that extradition,
once filed, could take six months.
AIDS tests urged
SAN FRANCISCO — California's top health
official urged yesterday that all donors of organs
and transplant tissues be tested for AIDS an
tibodies "before such materials are used. ,,
Kenneth Kizer, director of the state Depart
ment of Health Services, said that "all organ and
tissue transplant units, sperm banks, local health
departments . . . were sent notification of the new
guidelines today."
"Although no cases of AIDS in California have
been linked to transplanted organs or artificial in
semination, blood, semen and other body fluids
are known to harbor the AIDS virus, and these
guidelines are being issued in an effort to prevent
the occurrence of AIDS from organ-tissue
transplantations and artificial inseminations in
the future," Kizer said.
