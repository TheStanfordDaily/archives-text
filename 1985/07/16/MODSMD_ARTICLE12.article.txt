While Live Aid refreshingly showed on a broader scale
that enormous amounts of time and energy can be expended
when personal welfare is not at stake, a man spending the
same kind of painstaking hours teaches the same lesson,
but on a smaller scale.
Clifford Johnson, a manager at Stanford's Information
Technology Services (ITS), has literally spent thousands of
hours and dollars fighting for his cause, not on a stage, but
in courtroom. Johnson is suing Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger.
But he is not suing Weinberger to make money. He is
suing because he believes something is wrong with this
country's launch-on-warning capabilty, putting the deci
sion of whether or not to launch a counterattack in the
hands (rather, silicon chips) of a computer.
You can agree or disagree with Johnson's argument, that
giving computers the capability to launch missiles violates
the Constitution by removing Congress' power to declare
war and the president's role as commander in chief of the
armed forces. But you can't disagree with his investment of
personal time, money and emotion.
