# Two sides to vandalism
## 
### 
Jet lag . . . just a few days ago, I found myself be
ing typhooned upon in an out-of-the-way corner of
Japan (more on this in two weeks). Stranded in a
small town, I decided to check out the local super
market for grapefruit sodas. There were two.
Calpico Fruit (150 yen per can) Surprisingly
good, considering that the company which makes
this is the same one that produces a sweet milk solid
colloid with the viscosity and appearance of whale
semen.
Hi-Fli (150 yen per can) This soda neatly il
lustrates the saying, "If you can't read the label,
don't drink it!" Later, I found out that it contains, in
addition to grapefruit juice, seven percent alcohol
and two percent something loquaciously described
as "X." Alcohol can be dealt with, but "X" . . . I'll
let you know if I sprout a third eye or anything.
The place of vandalism in history has been a much
maligned one. The Vandals themselves were a tribe
from what is now Germany who went and sacked
Rome with a few friends of theirs (Goths, Visigoths,
Protogoths, etc.). The tradition continues today
with such acts as the hammer attack on the "Gay
Liberation" sculpture and the paint balloon deface
ment of the Olympic murals on Los Angeles
freeway walls.
But vandalism can be just as powerful a force for
good (or, at least, cool). Marcel Duchamp, a French
artist, once took a print of Da Vinci's "Mona Lisa,"
drew a moustache on her face and titled it
"LHOOQ," a fairly obscene set of initials designed
to cast aspersions on the long dead and revered Da
Vinci's sexuality.
I believe that we of the 20th century have become
enlightened enough to distinguish between these
polar forms of vandalism, and for clarity's sake, I
would like to call them "subtracti ve (or
destructive)" and "additive (or constructive)."
This distinction should be evident to the most
casual observer, whom we'll call "Paul." Let's say
Paul is passing a subtractively vandalized work of
art. He looks at it and, feeling helpless at all the
destruction, is forced to mutter, "What is the world
coming to?" and shuffle off, downcast. On the other
hand, if Paul were to pass an additively vandalized
work of art, he would have a choice: He could
chuckle at the vandal's cleverness or else remove
the additive vandalism.
To drive home the point, consider the hammer at
tack on the "Gay Liberation" sculpture. The use of
the hammer clearly identifies this incident as sub
tractive vandalism; the Vandals in Rome could not

have improved on the quality of the trashing. What
the vandal actually should have done to make the
point that he didn't appreciate the sculpture as
much as the artist intended, was to, of course, per
form a little additive vandalism.
He should've measured the dimensions of each of
the figures, gone home, made 10 or so more plaster
figures in different poses (perhaps in different
colors) and finally placed the new figures amongst
the old ones so the vandalized sculpture would now
resemble some obscure bacchanalian rite.

No area is safe from additive vandalism; it is not
limited to art. Though often the vandalism is for po
litical reasons, the best reason, of course, is to make
the victims realize that they are taking something
(art, career, life) too seriously and are thus in dan
ger of their heads exploding in a shower of self
importance.
To wit: If you, like me, were watching the "Live
Aid" broadcast for any length of time Saturday and,
like me, were sort of becoming nauseous at the MCs
calling this and that moment "one of the most
touching moments in the history of mankind" every
couple minutes — the emcees themselves being as
profound as a junior high school yearbook — and
the constant stream of propaganda pre-empting
performers, wouldn't you have appreciated it if Paul
McCartney, in the finale, decided to sing "Letter B"
instead of "Let It Be"? Or if The Who went ahead
and performed "Won't Get Food Again"? Sure you
would have.
Parody, satire and sarcasm are all forms of this
enlightened form of vandalism, and as your colum
nist, I advise you to indulge in this exercise before
you end up with a steady job and a mortgage and it's
too late. Heck, in a world where the Joe Bob Briggs
column gets canceled for being funny and Doones
bury is censored for being relevant, maybe it is too
late.

bury is censored for being relevant, maybe it is too
late.
