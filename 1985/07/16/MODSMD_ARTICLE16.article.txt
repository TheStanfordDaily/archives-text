Lost wallet returned
In a not-unaccustomed fit of
carelessness yesterday afternoon,
I left my wallet behind in a
public place on the Stanford
campus. When I went back to
search for it a couple of hours
later, it was, of course, missing.
Those who worked at lost-and
found offices all over campus
warned me to regard the money
as gone forever, to cancel the
credit cards and to entertain few
hopes of ever recovering my
identification cards. It was sen
sible advice, and I followed it.
Last week, though, the secre
tary of the Asian Languages
Department called to tell me that
the wallet had been turned in to
her — with the credit cards and
money still tucked away inside it.

Those who, like Polonius and
me, are prone to sermonizing
find it hard to resist such occa
sions which seem to affirm one's
somewhat absurd faith in human
beings. I will restrict myself to
one grateful observation: People
are marvelously unpredictable
and often kind.
Whoever turned in my wallet
neglected to leave a name, so I
would like to thank him or her
for that unpredictable act of
kindness by quoting Shake
speare's Portia: "How far that
little candle throws his
beams / So shines a good deed in
a naughty world" ("Merchant of
Venice," V, i, 90-91).
