After an appeal lasting longer
than two years. University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy has
delayed issuing a ruling regarding
the expulsion of former Stanford
doctoral candidate Steven
Mosher.
A University spokesman said
May 30 that a decision regarding
Mosher's appeal for reinstate
ment in the Anthropology De
partment's doctoral program
could be expected in approxi
mately one month.
Mosher noted that recently he
had been given a list of questions
to answer by University legal
counsel Iris Brest regarding his
activities in China, but that Brest
maintained that the questions
"weren't important" in regard to
Kennedy's impending decision.
"But on July 3," Mosher said,
"I received a letter which indi
cated that further delay would be
caused because it would take time

to'integrate the questions." "
Brest said Mosher had been in
formed that the responses to the
questions were not essential to
the deeision, but said, "The fact
that he answered them meant that
he means them to be considered."
Brest estimated that a final
decision would be issued "in a
couple of weeks."
"Kennedy is being weak
kneed," said Mosher yesterday in
regard to Kennedy's delay. "This
has lasted longer than 95 percent
of legal court cases."
When asked if further delay
will constitute grounds for legal
action, Mosher said that he and
his attorney "have to decide what
constitutes an 'unreasonable'
length of time. But this is
definitely entering the gray area
right now."
Mosher, a graduate student in
anthropology, was discharged
