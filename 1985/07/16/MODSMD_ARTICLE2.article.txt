# Kennedy delays Mosher decision
## News 
### MARSH McCALL Editorial staff 
After an appeal lasting longer
than two years. University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy has
delayed issuing a ruling regarding
the expulsion of former Stanford
doctoral candidate Steven
Mosher.
A University spokesman said
May 30 that a decision regarding
Mosher's appeal for reinstate
ment in the Anthropology De
partment's doctoral program
could be expected in approxi
mately one month.
Mosher noted that recently he
had been given a list of questions
to answer by University legal
counsel Iris Brest regarding his
activities in China, but that Brest
maintained that the questions
"weren't important" in regard to
Kennedy's impending decision.
"But on July 3," Mosher said,
"I received a letter which indi
cated that further delay would be
caused because it would take time

to'integrate the questions." "
Brest said Mosher had been in
formed that the responses to the
questions were not essential to
the deeision, but said, "The fact
that he answered them meant that
he means them to be considered."
Brest estimated that a final
decision would be issued "in a
couple of weeks."
"Kennedy is being weak
kneed," said Mosher yesterday in
regard to Kennedy's delay. "This
has lasted longer than 95 percent
of legal court cases."
When asked if further delay
will constitute grounds for legal
action, Mosher said that he and
his attorney "have to decide what
constitutes an 'unreasonable'
length of time. But this is
definitely entering the gray area
right now."
Mosher, a graduate student in
anthropology, was discharged
from his department's doctoral
program in February 1983 by an
11-0 vote of the department's
faculty. The department alleged
that Mosher had engaged in
"illegal and seriously unethical

conduct" while conducting re
search in China.
Mosher claims that he was ex
pelled because he published ma
terial embarrassing to the
Chinese government, including
evidence of government-imposed
abortions.
However, Bob Beyers, director
of University News Service,
maintains that many of the delays

have been Mosher's fault. He
cited an initial investigation con
ducted in 1982 and early 1983
after Mosher's return from China.
The report stated that the investi
gation had been slowed by
Mosher's "continuing lack of can
dor in dealing with the investigat
ing committee."
Mosher reaffirmed that legal
action is a certainty if Kennedy

rejects his appeal. ''It's a 100 per
cent certainty that I'll win,"
Mosher said. "This has been an
infringement on my academic
freedom and that sort of thing
doesn't happen in this country.
Stanford owes me a Ph.D."
Mosher's dismissal was upheld
by the dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences and by
the dean of graduate studies and

research. Kennedy, who could
not be reached for comment yes
terday, represents the last step in
the University's internal review.
Brest refused to speculate on
the possible results of legal action
on Mosher's part. She did say,
"As a general matter, the Univer
sity would not make a decision
which would be considered illegal
in a court of law."
