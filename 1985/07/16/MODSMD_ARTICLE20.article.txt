## Frost hosts Computer Music Festival 
### RONALD CHRISLEY 
Stanford's Center for Com
puter Research in Music and
Acoustics will present its fifth an
nual Computer Music Festival at
Frost Ampitheatre Thursday at
8:15 p.m.
CCRMA (pronounced "kar
ma") is directed by John Chown
ing and is considered by many to
be the finest institution of its type
in the world.
Works from CCRMA have
won numerous awards and have
been presented at international
festivals in Paris; Venice, Italy;
Berlin; Barcelona, Spain;
Cologne, West Germany; Lon
don; Tokyo; Warsaw, Poland;
and New York. Music from
CCRMA has also been recorded
on compact disc and has been
used in several films, including
"Altered States."
Doug Fulton, a graduate stu
dent in music at Stanford, has
been affiliated with CCRMA for
several years and has contributed
musically to several local produc
tions including "The Melody That
Got Lost" and "Sold Out." He is
also one of seven composers
whose pieces will be featured at
the festival.
"Ninety percent of all real,
legitimate computer music is ab
solute junk," Fulton said. "But
fortunately at CCRMA we have a
handful of composers who actu
ally are composers. They think of
something they want to hear and
try to realize that, as opposed to
ccmposers who [base their music]
on some scientific theory, like
"Gaussian Distribution" or
"Fluid Motion" that has no musi
cal worth whatsoever. It has all
the emotional impact of insurance
actuary tables."
These other, more common
composers use mathematical al
gorithms to actually compose
their pieces, which Fulton finds
musically abhorrent. He sees al
gorithms as a means to fill in
areas of music, not compose the
works themselves.
A notable exception to this is

Fulton's CCRMA colleague, Bill
Schottstaedt. "Bill is an in
credible composer," Fulton said.
"He writes these huge pieces
with floating rhythm . . . extended
harmonies and sophisticated
tonal references. He's certainly
my favorite composer. You listen
to his music and say, 'There's no
way this could be written by a
computer.' But the really
amazing thing is, a lot of it is."

The reason his algorithmic
composition is so much better
than many of his contemporaries,
Fulton said, is that he has been
working on it for years, refining
until his program writes music
like he does.
"It's very well planned out,"
Fulton said. "He knows exactly
what's going to come out before
he turns the thing on. You can't
say the computer wrote this. He
actually wrote it."
Schottstaedt has been compos
ing computer music for more than
10 years. His music has been used
in several films and will also be

performed Thursday.
Fulton pointed out that com
puter music is unfairly stig
matized as being sterile simply
because it is produced with a
computer. This is undeserved, he
said, because computers have the
potential to create at least as
much musical expression as any
other single instrument. It's just
that this potential is not often
realized.

Many computer composers
revel in the sterility and inacces
sibility of their works. But Fulton
and some of his CCRMA col
legues are creating tonal, rhyth
mic pieces that build on estab
lished music standards, expanding
them into uncharted musical ter
ritory with the creative power of
the computer.
"We seem to have a corner on
the people composing good com
puter music — they get drummed
out at the other computer music
centers. What I'm doing here, I
would never be allowed to do
anywhere else." Fulton adds,

"I'm trying to lower computer
music as much as possible, turn it
into absolute schlock
Fulton considers accessibility to
be just as important in computer
music as conventional music. Ful
ton said that he considered it silly
to write a piece that you couldn't
hum when someone asked you
what it sounded like. Fulton said
about his music, "You can't
ignore it. It's loud for one thing.

And very rhythmic."
In addition to the premieres of
new works by Fulton and Schot
tstaedt, the festival will feature
the works of visiting composers
Fred Malouf, Adolfo Nunez and
Brian Schober. These will all be
presented on prerecorded tape.
The festival will also include
live performances of David
Jaffe's "Bristlecone Concerto No.
3" for mandolin, percussion and
tape, as well as Amnon Wolman's
"Mora' for two sopranos, oboe,
percussion and tape.
"For the most part, I have trou
ble with tape and performer

pieces," Fulton said. "I can't
really believe them both. With a
live performer, you get one sort
of feeling — like a highwire act.
Will they make it or blow it? With
a tape you get none of that ten
sion, but you do get the satisfac
tion that what you are going to
hear is more or less technically
perfect."
Fulton added that with a tape,
"You feel no responsibility to the
stage. If you're listening to a tape
that you don't like, particularly in
Frost, you can lay back, go to
sleep, look at the stars, wander
around, whatever. You don't
have to concentrate your atten
tion on the front."
Fulton said about the festival in
general, "It's a fun concert, even
if the music is bad. People come
with a blanket and a picnic; they
bring their kids and let them run
around. It's like a great big
playpen . . . with a very high
fidelity system. And even though
it's loud, it doesn't hurt, because
the fidelity is so good."
Although Fulton said that he
occasionally uses visual effects,
such as slides, he said there won't
be any at the festival other than
colored lights on the trees.
Concert goers are invited to
bring a picnic dinner. They are
also encouraged to dress warmly
and bring a blanket. The gates at
Frost will open at 7 p.m.
Tickets can be purchased at the
Tresidder Ticket Office or at the
door. They are $6 general and $4
for students and seniors.
Fulton said this concert should
be the best since he's been here
"because the music's so good."
He especially encourages people
who have only heard computer
music in Dinklespiel to attend be
cause of the dramatically differ
ent environments. "If somebody
has gone to a (CCRMA) concert
in Dinklespiel and didn't like it,
then they should try again at
Frost — if not for the music, then
just for the atmosphere. Because
it is fun."

"Mora' for two sopranos, oboe,
percussion and tape.
"For the most part, I have trou
ble with tape and performer

pieces," Fulton said. "I can't
really believe them both. With a
live performer, you get one sort
of feeling — like a highwire act.
Will they make it or blow it? With
a tape you get none of that ten
sion, but you do get the satisfac
tion that what you are going to
hear is more or less technically
perfect."
Fulton added that with a tape,
"You feel no responsibility to the
stage. If you're listening to a tape
that you don't like, particularly in
Frost, you can lay back, go to
sleep, look at the stars, wander
around, whatever. You don't
have to concentrate your atten
tion on the front."
Fulton said about the festival in
general, "It's a fun concert, even
if the music is bad. People come
with a blanket and a picnic; they
bring their kids and let them run
around. It's like a great big
playpen . . . with a very high
fidelity system. And even though
it's loud, it doesn't hurt, because
the fidelity is so good."
Although Fulton said that he
occasionally uses visual effects,
such as slides, he said there won't
be any at the festival other than
colored lights on the trees.
Concert goers are invited to
bring a picnic dinner. They are
also encouraged to dress warmly
and bring a blanket. The gates at
Frost will open at 7 p.m.
Tickets can be purchased at the
Tresidder Ticket Office or at the
door. They are $6 general and $4
for students and seniors.
Fulton said this concert should
be the best since he's been here
"because the music's so good."
He especially encourages people
who have only heard computer
music in Dinklespiel to attend be
cause of the dramatically differ
ent environments. "If somebody
has gone to a (CCRMA) concert
in Dinklespiel and didn't like it,
then they should try again at
Frost — if not for the music, then
just for the atmosphere. Because
it is fun."

Stanford's Center for Com
puter Research in Music and
Acoustics will present its fifth an
nual Computer Music Festival at
Frost Ampitheatre Thursday at
8:15 p.m.
CCRMA (pronounced "kar
ma") is directed by John Chown
ing and is considered by many to
be the finest institution of its type
in the world.
Works from CCRMA have
won numerous awards and have
been presented at international
festivals in Paris; Venice, Italy;
Berlin; Barcelona, Spain;
Cologne, West Germany; Lon
don; Tokyo; Warsaw, Poland;
and New York. Music from
CCRMA has also been recorded
on compact disc and has been
used in several films, including
"Altered States."
Doug Fulton, a graduate stu
dent in music at Stanford, has
been affiliated with CCRMA for
several years and has contributed
musically to several local produc
tions including "The Melody That
Got Lost" and "Sold Out." He is
also one of seven composers
whose pieces will be featured at
the festival.
"Ninety percent of all real,
legitimate computer music is ab
solute junk," Fulton said. "But
fortunately at CCRMA we have a
handful of composers who actu
ally are composers. They think of
something they want to hear and
try to realize that, as opposed to
ccmposers who [base their music]
on some scientific theory, like
"Gaussian Distribution" or
"Fluid Motion" that has no musi
cal worth whatsoever. It has all
the emotional impact of insurance
actuary tables."
These other, more common
composers use mathematical al
gorithms to actually compose
their pieces, which Fulton finds
musically abhorrent. He sees al
gorithms as a means to fill in
areas of music, not compose the
works themselves.
A notable exception to this is

Fulton's CCRMA colleague, Bill
Schottstaedt. "Bill is an in
credible composer," Fulton said.
"He writes these huge pieces
with floating rhythm . . . extended
harmonies and sophisticated
tonal references. He's certainly
my favorite composer. You listen
to his music and say, 'There's no
way this could be written by a
computer.' But the really
amazing thing is, a lot of it is."

The reason his algorithmic
composition is so much better
than many of his contemporaries,
Fulton said, is that he has been
working on it for years, refining
until his program writes music
like he does.
"It's very well planned out,"
Fulton said. "He knows exactly
what's going to come out before
he turns the thing on. You can't
say the computer wrote this. He
actually wrote it."
Schottstaedt has been compos
ing computer music for more than
10 years. His music has been used
in several films and will also be

performed Thursday.
Fulton pointed out that com
puter music is unfairly stig
matized as being sterile simply
because it is produced with a
computer. This is undeserved, he
said, because computers have the
potential to create at least as
much musical expression as any
other single instrument. It's just
that this potential is not often
realized.

Many computer composers
revel in the sterility and inacces
sibility of their works. But Fulton
and some of his CCRMA col
legues are creating tonal, rhyth
mic pieces that build on estab
lished music standards, expanding
them into uncharted musical ter
ritory with the creative power of
the computer.
"We seem to have a corner on
the people composing good com
puter music — they get drummed
out at the other computer music
centers. What I'm doing here, I
would never be allowed to do
anywhere else." Fulton adds,

"I'm trying to lower computer
music as much as possible, turn it
into absolute schlock
Fulton considers accessibility to
be just as important in computer
music as conventional music. Ful
ton said that he considered it silly
to write a piece that you couldn't
hum when someone asked you
what it sounded like. Fulton said
about his music, "You can't
ignore it. It's loud for one thing.

And very rhythmic."
In addition to the premieres of
new works by Fulton and Schot
tstaedt, the festival will feature
the works of visiting composers
Fred Malouf, Adolfo Nunez and
Brian Schober. These will all be
presented on prerecorded tape.
The festival will also include
live performances of David
Jaffe's "Bristlecone Concerto No.
3" for mandolin, percussion and
tape, as well as Amnon Wolman's
"Mora' for two sopranos, oboe,
percussion and tape.

ble with tape and performer
