## Gentleman wouldn't set Shakespeare in 1920s 
### ELAINE WANG 
Roughly drafted into the year
1926, Shakespeare's "The Two
Gentlemen of Verona" opens the
sixth season of Valley Institute of
Theatre Arts (VITA) perfor
mances at the Paul Masson Vine
yards. The play is set in New
York and Verona, Pa. — with
script intact and sometimes em
bellished — in the era of Prohibi
tion and the Charleston.
Instead of being two gentlemen
in Verona, Italy, Valentine and
Proteus are from Pennsylvania.
Both men are sent to New York
City to seek their fortunes —
working for the mayor of the Big
Apple — with Proteus having to
leave his hometown sweetheart
(Julia) and Valentine falling in
love with a big city socialite
(Silvia, the mayor's daughter).
Proteus also falls for Silvia, and
gets Valentine kicked out of
town. Valentine joins a gangster
group — pinstripes, machine guns
and all — at the edge of town and
becomes their leader. The plot
quickens when Julia dresses in
man's garb and joins Proteus as
his valet of sorts, where she sees
him woo another. All ends well,
obviously, and the rightful lovers
are reconciled. There is a con

certed effort to establish the
mood of the Roaring Twenties
through music, vignettes under
strobe lights during scene
changes, and vernacular language
now and then. Some work better
than others. The strobe light ef
fect is an apt diversion from
people scurrying to switch the
sign for Gracie Mansion to
Verona and back, and the small
stories pantomimed in dance are
largely irrelevant to the story line,
but they catch our attention.
What doesn't always work is
when modern language is used to
round out the 1920s theme, such
as using "Daddy" or "c'mon"
when, in the verse, the other
words are more formal. Sure, the
themes of Shakespeare's plays are
classic and thus lend themselves
to adaptation to different times
and places. But during this pro
duction we sometimes wonder if
one (Director John Hertzler's
part of the script) or the other
(Shakespeare's language) might
not be anachronistic.
There are, however, funny mo
ments when the vernacular is
used to whimsical effect — as
near the end, when the mayor
pardons the outlaws and they give

him three "hip, hip, hooray"
cheers.
The first vignette is part of a
scene change; the second time
around, Proteus is the man, Silvia
the woman and Valentine the
one who tries to stop Proteus. We
see Proteus aim and shoot in slow
motion, with certain panic that
the ending has been redone, but
the dream lighting passes, and we
see Proteus prostrate and crying
over how he wronged them all.
They forgive him, and the mood
is, again, optimistic.
This departure from comedy
does not fit very well, although we
may interpret it like crazy, say, as
Proteus' visual replay of his
thoughts, which then triggers the
guilt and remorse. (I don't
know. . . .)
The theater is open-air, in ex
quisite, tranquil surroundings; in
dramatic pauses we hear crickets.
There is pre-performance wine
tasting and blankets and cushions
for rent, and the drive to the vine
yard is breathtaking. Any way
you look at it, the ambience for
an outdoor Shakespearean per
formance is all there; the compo
nents for a thoroughly solid pro
duction of "Two Gentlemen,"
however, are not.
