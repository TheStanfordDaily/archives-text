## Amy Grant: God's gift to music 
### MARK ZEIGLER Editorial staff 
Remember when you had to
take medicine you hated? Re
member how your mother
crushed the vile pills in a bowl of
applesauce so you wouldn't taste
them?
Christian rock is the same deal.
Parents not wanting the impres
sionable, virginal ears of their
young ones to listen to the Ozzy
Osbornes of the world and their
satanic over- and undertones,
now have an alternative. The kids
can have their rock 'n' roll, and
the parents can have the satisfac
tion of knowing the kids are
hearing wholesome religious
lyrics.
The applesauce is Amy Grant,
who played before a sold-out
Concord Pavilion Saturday night.
An Olivia Newton-John or Shiela
E. who goes to church, Grant
plays the processed pop that has
brought millions of teens to their
feet in the '80s. She's 24, svelte,
has a darling Southern accent and
a stage presence to match.
She's also very Christian. "I'm
Christian, and I want to sing about
it," she says."I want to communi
cate my life, my thoughts and my
Christianity creatively."
The key word there is
creatively. Acutally, innovative
might be more appropriate.
Grant has taken religious
messages, many as ancient as the
Bible itself, and combined them
with 1980s entertainment, most
of it as loud and footstomping as

Olivia, Shiela and the like.
Time magazine has called
Christian contemporary music
"one of the most interesting,
fastest-growing trends in the
music world." The statistics echo
that appraisal — in 1984 alone,
more than 15 million contem
porary Christian albums were
sold.
Grant, who Time described as
"playing hardball with the an
gels," played at the comfortable
Concord Pavilion as part of the
pavilion's 10th anniversary con
cert series. Coming later this sum
mer to the pavilion, which
features both reserved seats and a
large grass slope', are acts like
Eric Clapton, Santana, Barry
Manilow, Dire Straits and a four
day jazz festival.
Grant was playing the final
date of a week-long California
tour. Opening for her on the tour
was Philip Bailey, the former lead
singer of Earth, Wind & Fire who
has embarked upon a successful
solo career.
Bailey, whose falsetto voice has
been called EWF's "secret
weapon," has released a pair of
solo albums, the latter produced
by Phil Collins and featuring
"Easy Lover," the duet with Col
lins that topped the pop charts
earlier this year. However, you'll
find Bailey's most recent album,
entitled "The Wonders of His
Love," in the gospel section at the
record store.
Judging by Bailey's perfor
mance and his talented band, it

was surprising that he was
opening for Grant and not the
other way around. But as soon as
Grant took the stage to the
shrieks of thousands of teens, it
was no mystery why she was the
headliner.
Grant's music itself is nothing
special. Take away her lyrics and
you remove her musical appeal.
(You'd have to take her off stage
to remove the rest of her appeal.)
Her music is as unoriginal as her
applications of Christian prin
ciples to it are original.
In fact, the highlight of Grant's
show was when she left the stage
to her husband, Gary Chapman,
who plays guitar and bass in her
band, and her three backup sing
ers (or four, if you count one par
ticularly rotund singer as two). In
his wife's absence, Chapman, a
Christian rock artist himself who
earlier in the evening sang Col
lins' part in "Easy Lover" with
Bailey, first played an upbeat
tune.
Then he handed the
microphones over to the three
back-up singers, who proceeded
to bring down the pavilion with a
funky gospel tune of their own.
Then Grant returned, having
changed into a yellow-and-black,
new-wave outfit (with a matching
yellow bow no less). Unfortun
ately, however, her clothes were
the only thing to change.
But as boring and simplistic as
Grant's music is, you have to
hand it to her in all other areas.
She has a better than average

voice. She has excellent stage
presence. You won't find her
pictures in Playboy. And, above
all, she has a knack for making
people happy.
It's awfully hard to criticize
someone like Grant when
thousands of folks are on their
feet dancing and singing for two
hours straight. One usher noted
that there was no contest between
the crowd noise Saturday night
and at another pavilion rock con
cert last week. The Grant crowd
was louder.
While the crowd's noise level
was surprising, its composition
wasn't. Many of the hoards of
adolescents, most of them girls,
brought their parents along.
Nearly all of the sold-out audi
ence — entirely white with about
a half-dozen exceptions — ap
peared to be as devoutly Chris
tian as Grant.
In the break between Bailey

and Grant, one section began a
Jesus spell-out of the "Gimme a
J, gimme an E, . . nature. No
joke. And when the lights
dimmed before the main event,
the crowd began chanting "Amy,
Amy."
Probably the thing most re
sponsible for making Grant a star
of such monstrous proportions is
subtlety. Unlike many of her
gospel counterparts, Grant
doesn't hit the listener over the
head with her Christian messages,
exemplified by her latest album,
"Unguarded," which is easily her
mildest in the message depart
ment.
"Everybody wants hope,"
Grant said in a recent interview in
Rolling Stone. "It's pretty bleak
out there, pretty dark. ... So
what we're trying to do is take
Christian principles and make
them understandable."
And palatable.

Time magazine has called
Christian contemporary music
"one of the most interesting,
fastest-growing trends in the
music world." The statistics echo
that appraisal — in 1984 alone,
more than 15 million contem
porary Christian albums were
sold.
Grant, who Time described as
"playing hardball with the an
gels," played at the comfortable
Concord Pavilion as part of the
pavilion's 10th anniversary con
cert series. Coming later this sum
mer to the pavilion, which
features both reserved seats and a
large grass slope', are acts like
Eric Clapton, Santana, Barry
Manilow, Dire Straits and a four
day jazz festival.
Grant was playing the final
date of a week-long California
tour. Opening for her on the tour
was Philip Bailey, the former lead
singer of Earth, Wind & Fire who
has embarked upon a successful
solo career.
Bailey, whose falsetto voice has
been called EWF's "secret
weapon," has released a pair of
solo albums, the latter produced
by Phil Collins and featuring
"Easy Lover," the duet with Col
lins that topped the pop charts
earlier this year. However, you'll
find Bailey's most recent album,
entitled "The Wonders of His
Love," in the gospel section at the
record store.
Judging by Bailey's perfor
mance and his talented band, it

was surprising that he was
opening for Grant and not the
other way around. But as soon as
Grant took the stage to the
shrieks of thousands of teens, it
was no mystery why she was the
headliner.
Grant's music itself is nothing
special. Take away her lyrics and
you remove her musical appeal.
(You'd have to take her off stage
to remove the rest of her appeal.)
Her music is as unoriginal as her
applications of Christian prin
ciples to it are original.
In fact, the highlight of Grant's
show was when she left the stage
to her husband, Gary Chapman,
who plays guitar and bass in her
band, and her three backup sing
ers (or four, if you count one par
ticularly rotund singer as two). In
his wife's absence, Chapman, a
Christian rock artist himself who
earlier in the evening sang Col
lins' part in "Easy Lover" with
Bailey, first played an upbeat
tune.
Then he handed the
microphones over to the three
back-up singers, who proceeded
to bring down the pavilion with a
funky gospel tune of their own.
Then Grant returned, having
changed into a yellow-and-black,
new-wave outfit (with a matching
yellow bow no less). Unfortun
ately, however, her clothes were
the only thing to change.
But as boring and simplistic as
Grant's music is, you have to
hand it to her in all other areas.
She has a better than average

voice. She has excellent stage
presence. You won't find her
pictures in Playboy. And, above
all, she has a knack for making
people happy.
It's awfully hard to criticize
someone like Grant when
thousands of folks are on their
feet dancing and singing for two
hours straight. One usher noted
that there was no contest between
the crowd noise Saturday night
and at another pavilion rock con
cert last week. The Grant crowd
was louder.
While the crowd's noise level
was surprising, its composition
wasn't. Many of the hoards of
adolescents, most of them girls,
brought their parents along.
Nearly all of the sold-out audi
ence — entirely white with about
a half-dozen exceptions — ap
peared to be as devoutly Chris
tian as Grant.
In the break between Bailey

and Grant, one section began a
Jesus spell-out of the "Gimme a
J, gimme an E, . . nature. No
joke. And when the lights
dimmed before the main event,
the crowd began chanting "Amy,
Amy."
Probably the thing most re
sponsible for making Grant a star
of such monstrous proportions is
subtlety. Unlike many of her
gospel counterparts, Grant
doesn't hit the listener over the
head with her Christian messages,
exemplified by her latest album,
"Unguarded," which is easily her
mildest in the message depart
ment.
"Everybody wants hope,"
Grant said in a recent interview in
Rolling Stone. "It's pretty bleak
out there, pretty dark. ... So
what we're trying to do is take
Christian principles and make
them understandable."
And palatable.

Remember when you had to
take medicine you hated? Re
member how your mother
crushed the vile pills in a bowl of
applesauce so you wouldn't taste
them?
Christian rock is the same deal.
Parents not wanting the impres
sionable, virginal ears of their
young ones to listen to the Ozzy
Osbornes of the world and their
satanic over- and undertones,
now have an alternative. The kids
can have their rock 'n' roll, and
the parents can have the satisfac
tion of knowing the kids are
hearing wholesome religious
lyrics.
The applesauce is Amy Grant,
who played before a sold-out
Concord Pavilion Saturday night.
An Olivia Newton-John or Shiela
E. who goes to church, Grant
plays the processed pop that has
brought millions of teens to their
feet in the '80s. She's 24, svelte,
has a darling Southern accent and
a stage presence to match.
She's also very Christian. "I'm
Christian, and I want to sing about
it," she says."I want to communi
cate my life, my thoughts and my
Christianity creatively."
The key word there is
creatively. Acutally, innovative
might be more appropriate.
Grant has taken religious
messages, many as ancient as the
Bible itself, and combined them
with 1980s entertainment, most
of it as loud and footstomping as

Olivia, Shiela and the like.
Time magazine has called
Christian contemporary music
