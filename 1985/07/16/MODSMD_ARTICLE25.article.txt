"Amelia Earhart: The Final
Story"
By Vincent Loomis with Jeffrey
Ethell
Random House, 159 pp., $16.95
Amelia Earhart was, along with
Charles Lindbergh, America's
most famous pioneer flyer, and
she has become, perhaps even
more than him, a figure of myth
and mystery, the subject of in
numerable television shows,
books and crank theories. In a
recent collection of poetry,
Sharona Ben-Tov has written a
suite of poems in the voice of
Earhart that magnificently
represents the power this bold yet
shy pilot has in the imaginations
of feminist writers today.
Much of the interest in Ear
hart's life is due simply to the fact
that we never have been sure how
it ended, or even if it ended. She
disappeared, along with her
navigator, Fred Noonan, during
their round-the-world flight on
July 2, 1937. No wreckage was
found. And no explanation for
the disappearance has yet been
satisfactory.
This pithy, serious book, writ
ten by an ex-Air Force pilot who
has been researching the case for
more than 30 years, claims that
Earhart's airplane, the Electra,
crashed near the Marshall Islands
in the Pacific Ocean, and that
both she and Noonan survived,

only to be jailed in secrecy by the
Japanese, who in the process of
militarizing the islands in prepa
ration for World War 11,
believed the American flyers to
be spies. Noonan was executed;
Earhart died 14 months after her
capture of acute dysentery.

Loomis' case for this conclu
sion is made from a solid heap of
evidence, much of which has
never been presented before.
Earhart's deviation from her
flight plan is explained, for exam
ple, through painstaking correla
tion of radio transmissions, ships'

logs and heretofore unavailable
Japanese naval documents. He
has interviewed both Japanese
naval personnel and the local
natives of the Marshall Islands to
paint as clear a picture as we
probably will ever get of Ear
hart's unhappy end.
"The Final Story" is certainly
not the flashy, sensationalistic
book one might expect for such a
magnetic subject. The prose is
no-nonsense, bordering
sometimes on the flat. This style
works in Loomis' favor, however,
because if his book lacks flash, its
rigorous steadiness makes it more
convincing. One small gripe: The
author, as might befit an Air
Force officer who made two tours
of the Pacific, argues much too
stridently that the Japanese Gov
ernment ought to admit to their
illegal imprisonment of Earhart
and Noonan and its subsequent
high-level cover-up — a demand
that makes legal sense but one
which nearly 50 years after The
Electra's demise has more emo
tional than diplomatic value.
"James Rosenquist"
By Judith Goldstein
Viking Penguin, 188 pp., $45
Illustrated
With Andy Warhol and Roy
Lichtenstein, James Rosenquist
created a body of art work that
both delighted and annoyed crit

ics of the Sixties, critics who
termed such work "Pop Art." If
Rosenquist is the least famous of
these three, his technique perhaps
is the most dazzling, certainly the
most polished. Judith Goldman's
text presents a detailed — and too
ingratiating — examination of
Rosenquist's oeuvre, accompa
nied by 113 full-color illustrations
and 73 black-and-white
photographs.
Rosenquist's first serious
practice in painting came in the
years he roamed the country il
lustrating billboards; his first
painting job was a sign for He
brew National Salami on the
Manhattan side of the Brooklyn
Bridge. To be sure, Rosenquist
has never fully abandoned the
materials and subjects of his bill
board days. His canvases are of
ten huge (one painting, "F-lll,"
is 86 feet long), and he paints
them in a style of glossy high-tech
precision we've come to expect
from the finest, and/or most syn
cophantic, of Madison Avenue.
Goldman describes Rosen
quist's achievement this way: 44 He
found his visual language in parts
of ordinary things. His was a lang
uage suited to the times, to a
world about to be on the outs
with itself. It was noisy, fast, vul
gar, overlapping, public, visible: a


"Untitled," by James Rosenquist, the famous Pop artist whose huge,
glossy paintings owe much to his billboard-painting days.
world in which communication
appeared impossible. The shards
of personal imagery . . . referred
to anecdotes and events he had
once seen, thought about, or im
agined, and signaled private
feelings about sex, dreams, soci
ety, war, technology, the Midwest,
New York. . . . For Rosenquist,
fields of spaghetti, car fenders,
toothy grins, even the rose sig
nifying his name represent the vo
cabulary he found to make art.
They are the elements out of

which he forms modern pictures.
Like Jasper Johns, Rosenquist
put realism to the service of
abstraction."
For the most part, Goldman,
who also has written books on
Gene Moore and Jaspar Johns, is
an astute and lively explicator of
Rosenquist's jarring tableaux. I
think, however, that she has
tended to rely too much on
Rosenquist's own straight-faced
explanations of his craft.
She says, for example, that
whether "he was depicting blue
jeans, tire treads, or a toothpaste
smile, he rendered his blue-collar
view of American things without
mockery, with a deadpan literal

ness and a directness that sugges
ted innocence. He did not regard
commonplace things as signs of a
consumer culture. They conveyed
no moralism, transmitted no
message."
No way. There're whole boat
loads of mockery in his paintings.
Faces of women are gaudied up
by lipstick and eyeliner and then
shredded to pieces and fitted into
a design that also includes, say,
French toast, empty pop bottles
or slices of bacon.
To be fair to her, I should say
that Goldman amply
demonstrates how the
"commonplace things" in Rosen
quist's paintings do, in fact, trans

mit messages. In "Star Thief,"a
46-foot-long painting originally
commissioned by Eastern
Airlines, "mystery is endangered;
stars verge on losing their magic;
romance, if not dead, is comatose,
as if locked in a vise. The picture
offers Rosenquist's view of the
price paid for invading nature.
The sky, beneath the woman's
head, is a violent red. The
woman's neck merges into gristle
on bacon. She is mechanical, dis
posable, as processed as the food
one peels apart for breakfast."
(Eastern Airlines eventually
rejected the work — Frank Bor
man said outer space was not as
Rosenquist showed it to be, and

he, an ex-astronaut, said he ought
to know.)
It is the very slickness, the
luxuriousness, of Rosenquist's
paintings that remains their
riddle. In most of his work there
is finally no way to determine
whether the artist is advertising
(i.e., buying into) our cultural
crassness or whether he is expos
ing such crassness in a livid
outrage. Perhaps it is what
Goldman terms the "numbness
and . . . estranged silence" of
Rosenquist's paintings, vis-a-vis
this riddle, that has guaranteed
their enduring, agitating value.
