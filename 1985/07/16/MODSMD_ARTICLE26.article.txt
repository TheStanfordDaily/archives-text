## Med Center researchers make progress Reports praise new cancer treatments 
### JAMES LIN 
New results from the Stanford
Medical School show progress in
both novel and conventional ap
proaches in treating cancer, ac
cording to reports in recent issues
of Blood magazine, the New Eng
land Journal of Medicine and Sci
ence magazine.
A team of medical school doc
tors led by Dr. Ronald Levy are
studying how laboratory-made
antibodies, specifically targeted at
a patient's cancer, can help the
body to destroy tumor cells.
The published results, which
appeared in the June issue of
Blood and the June 27 issue of
the Journal, show that about half
the patients treated with the an
tibodies underwent significant
shrinkage of the tumors. One pa
tient even experienced complete
remission of the cancer.
"The important thing is that
the malignancies we are treating
are incurable by other kinds of
therapy," Dr. Mark Kaminski, a
member of the research team,
said of the antibody therapy. All
the experimental patients suf
fered from lymphoma, cancer of
the lymph glands.
Antibodies are proteins made
by the body which help the
immune system fight disease.
With normal illnesses like in
fluenza or chicken pox, the body
is able to manufacture its own an
tibodies that find and attach to
the invading virus or bacteria,
"flagging" the foreign agents for
destruction by the body's
defenses.
With cancer, however, the
body does not produce the re
quired antibodies because it does
not recognize the cancer cells as
foreign. The doctors at the medi
cal school have been able to syn
thesize antibodies to lymphoma
in the laboratory. These can then
be given to the patients and can
find and attack the cancerous
cells.
"Our hope," Kaminski said, "is
that by using these antibodies,
which react with the tumor cells,
the immune system of the host
will be activated to eliminate the
tumors that the antibodies have
attached to."
One advantage of the antibody

technique is its specificity. While
other, conventional treatments
such as radiation or chemother
apy harm healthy cells as they at
tack cancerous ones, the injected
antibodies work only on the can
cer targeted and leave the sur
rounding cells intact.
One advantage of this
specificity is that there are
relatively few side effects to the
antibody treatments. "By and
large there has been really mini
mal toxicity," Kaminski said,
citing mild chills, fever, headache
or nausea as the primary side ef
fects observed at the onset of
treatment.
Kaminski emphasized that
"these particular kinds of lym
phoma are untreatable by con
ventional means" and noted that
all but one of the 11 patients
treated had undergone extensive
prior therapy.
Although the antibodies are
now being used only with lym
phoma, the treatment could
theoretically be expanded to
other types of cancer. Kaminski
said that while the super-specific
antibodies could now only be
made for lymphoma cells, other
researchers are experimenting
with using less specific types to at
tack other types of cancer.
"The antibodies that we're
using are extremely specific,"
Kaminski said. "Others, less spe
cific, are also being used."
The experimental antibody
treatment is expected in the
future to supplement, but not
replace, other treatments. Laura
Hofstadter, from the Medical
Center News Bureau, described
the antibody treatment as
"something to use along with
conventional forms of therapy."
She listed surgery, radiation and
chemotherapy as the primary
forms used.
Kaminski also said that the an
tibody treatments might be used
to "mop up" remaining cancer
cells after chemotherapy or radia
tion.
Although the 50 percent suc
cess rate achieved in the experi
ments is encouraging, doctors are
cautious about the therapy's
future use. "There are still prob
lems that they are working on,"

Hofstadter said.
One of the major snags en
countered is that although tumor
shrinkage was experienced in half
of the patients, the tumors even
tually regrew from the remaining
cells. Responding to allegations
that the treatment might not be
useful on account of tumor
regrowth, Kaminski said that the
group was generally optimistic,
and offered possible strategies for
overcoming this problem.
"It may be necessary to use a
'cocktail' of antibodies," he said,
explaining that the different types
of antibodies might work to com
pletely eliminate the tumor and
prevent regrowth.
The antibody therapy is still
considered experimental, and it
may be years before it ever comes
into general use. Kaminski ex
plained that the research, funded
by the American Cancer Society
and the National Institutes of
Health, is extremely slow.
"It's a very time-consuming
process," he said, adding that the
time needed to create the an
tibodies for a particular cancer
patient could take from six
months to a year. It will probably
be at least two or three years, he
said, before new reports on the
progress of the treatment will be
made.
In a separate article published
in the June 28 issue of Science,
another researcher at Stanford
reported that testing of a new
anti-cancer drug reveals that it
may be less dangerous and more
effective than the drugs currently
used to fight cancer.
Dr. Branimir Sikic, assistant
professor of medicine at the
medical school, has been testing a
drug called MRA-CN on mice
with tumors and in cells from
patients with cancer of the breast
and ovary. MRA-CN is chemi
cally related to adriamyacin, a
drug commonly used in treating a
range of cancers, including breast,
lung and ovary cancer.
"It's an exciting new drug that
is very promising for clinical trials
in the future," Sikic has been
quoted as saying. "But at this
point we don't have a new drug
for patients." Clinical trials of the
drug on human patients are still at

least two years away, he added.
The significance of the drug
MRA-CN, which works by stop
ping cancer cell growth, is that it
does not have one of the major
drawbacks of adriamyacin, the
leading drug used against many
types of cancer.
Adriamyacin, when used in the
dosages necessary to treat the
cancers, can destroy heart muscle
cells, halting cancer treatments to
minimize damage to a patient's
heart.
Since MRA-CN, which seems
to have a potency up to 1,000
times greater than adriamyacin,

can be administered in very small
doses and still produce a
therapeutic effect, the risk of
damage to the heart is minimal.
Testing in mice showed that
damage to the heart occurred
only at doses many times greater
than those needed for a
therapeutic effect in humans,
Sikic said.
Sikic's lab is working with Dr.
Demitrios Papahadjopoulo and
Dr. Kate Mathay of UC-San
Francisco. Sikic stresses that it is
far too early to determine if the
drug may be valuable in fighting
cancer in humans some day.
