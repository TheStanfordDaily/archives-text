### MARK ZEIGLER Editorial staff 
Simply making the cut at the
U.S. Women's Open would have
been an impressive feat for an
amateur. But Stanford junior gol
fer Kathleen McCarthy took it a
step farther this weekend at Bal
tusrol Golf Course in Springfield,
N.J.
McCarthy finished in a four
way tie for 26th at the country's
most prestigious women's golf
tournament. She also finished
tied with Arizona State's Dana
Ammaccapane for low amateur.
On the par-72, 6,274-yard Bal
tusrol course, McCarthy recorded

a 297, nine over par, in the four
day tournament, as did Ammac
capane and two other profes
sionals, Valerie Skinner and Vicki
Fergon.
McCarthy stunned the
women's golf world Thursday
when she fired a one-under-par
71 in the tournament's opening
round, putting her one stroke off
the leaders.
But McCarthy faltered Friday
with a 79 before settling down

Saturday and Sunday with rounds
of 73 and 74. Kathy Baker won
the Open title by three strokes
with an eight-under total of 280.
With just one round to play, it
appeared as if Ammaccapane
would be the low amateur, gener
ally considered to be golfs next
up and coming star.
After three rounds, Ammac
capane led McCarthy by five
strokes, but the Arizona State
golfer bulged to a 79 in the final
round while McCarthy checked in
with her 74. Ammaccapane
bogeyed the 18th hole Sunday to
drop back into a tie with
McCarthy at 297.
McCarthy, who won the West
ern Amateur a few weeks ago,
would have won almost $3,000
had she been playing as a profes
sional this weekend.
