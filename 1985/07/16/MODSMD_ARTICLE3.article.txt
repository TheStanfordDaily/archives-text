# Says he attended football camp free
## Recruit accuses Stanford of violation News 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
A high school quarterback
from North Carolina claimed he
attended last month's football
camp run by Stanford Coach Jack
Elway without paying the $300
fee, the Los Angeles Times re
ported in its Saturday editions.
NCAA officials contacted for
comment yesterday said such an
action would have been a viola
tion of NCAA rules, but said
there was no precedent for inves
tigating a school accused solely of
this. A NCAA investigation is
considered a serious matter.
"Stanford paid for the camp for
me. I didn't have to pay anything
for the camp," Neil Williams Jr.,
who will be a senior in Charlotte,
N.C., told the Times.
Elway denied the charge to the
Times. "Whatever the kid said or

did, there's no way we're going to
go back there and tell him that he
doesn't have to pay," he said. "I
don't think a football camp

should have its reputation ruined
by some kid who isn't telling the
truth."
Tom Calder, of NCAA
Legislative Services in Shawnee

Mission, Kan., said yesterday that
there is a "back-of-the-book"
rule, Case 419, that states that "it
is not permissible for a football
camp to waive the fee for a
prospective student-athlete."
Chuck Smrt, the NCAA's assis
tant director of enforcement, said
NCAA policy was to neither con
firm nor deny that an investiga
tion is underway. "We can't com
ment on whether there is a case,"
he said yesterday.
Stanford officials were also
silent on whether an NCAA in
vestigation had begun yesterday
and on anything else related to
the matter.
When Elway and Athletic
Director Andy Geiger were
reached in Elway's office after a
late-afternoon meeting, Geiger
would only say, "We're checking
into it." He and Elwav declined

to comment further, though
Geiger said he would issue a
statement at some future time.
Williams could not be reached

last night for comment.
Tom Beckett, Stanford's assis
tant athletic director for football
operations, told the Times that a
computer list of those registered

for the camp showed that Wil
liams owed no money and had
paid none. "It was a mistake in
accounting," he told the Times.
Neil Williams Sr.. a Charlotte
attorney, told the Times, "Neil
didn't have enough money to pay.
It was his understanding that he
was not going to have to pay,
rightly or wrongly."
The Times reported that the
younger Williams has since paid
the fee.
In the two years he has been at
Stanford, Elway has expanded
the camp and said that it allows
him and his staff to identify po
tential collegiate players. "We're
looking at between 30 and 40
from this year's camp who we
may be interested in for football
scholarships," he told The Daily
