## Campus lights may have PCBs 
### MARSH McCALL Editorial staff 
Fluorescent light fixtures in
stalled in Stanford buildings may
contain toxic chemicals, the Stan
ford Department of Health and
Safety has announced.
The department warned that
fluorescent lights, if installed be
tween 1927 and 1977, may con
tain toxic polychlorinated bip
henyls (PCBs), which are
suspected to be a carcinogen in
humans.
The PCBs are not in the light
tubes themselves, but in the bal
lasts, which are separate metal
boxes mounted on top of the
lights. The department has
decided to issue the warning after
an incident last May in which a
light ballast at the Department of
Religious Studies dripped an oily
substance onto some books
beneath the fixture. Tests
revealed that the oily substance
contained 4 percent PCBs.
"It's not that big a deal, and I
don't want to sensationalize it,"
said Brian O'Neill, Stanford
health and safety specialist.
"People have this deathly fear of
PCBs that [is] not supported, for

the most part, unless there's a
fire.
"There are all kinds of materi
als on campus, especially in labs,
that are much more toxic," he
continued. O'Neill did say that
care should be taken to avoid skin
contact and ingestion of the
chemicals.
O'Neill said he had received
several calls from individuals
worried about past exposure to
the PCBs.
"A couple of people were con
cerned because they had cleaned
up drips themselves," he said. "I
told them not to worry if they
hadn't ingested it. Of course, the
lights may not have contained
PCBs at all."
Chemistry Prof. Kirk
Roberts supported O'Neill's
statements. "Very heavy skin
contact with PCB's can cause blis
tering," he said, "Bui unless you
licked the table top the stuff was
dripping on, you wouldn't be in
danger."
Roberts added that tests con
ducted with rats and mice indi
cated that humans would have to
ingest very large amounts of
PCBs to be endangered.
