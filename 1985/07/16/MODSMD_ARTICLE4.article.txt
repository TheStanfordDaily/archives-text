# Shuttle liftoff halted
## SUNSTAR project on hold

A faulty eight-inch coolant valve in
Florida will have a variety of effects on
experimenters at Stanford and at the new
SUNSTAR (Stanford University Net
work for Space Telescience Application
Research) lab.
The faulty valve caused NASA's Space
Shuttle Challenger, carrying Spacelab 2,
to abort its mission on its Cape
Canaveral. Fla., launch pad Friday after
noon just seconds before liftoff.
NASA is currently planning to
relaunch the shuttle July 29, with a four
day leeway depending on an engine check
scheduled for Sunday. The Challenger
delay will push back the shuttle launch
schedule, creating the possibility of com
bining two late-vear missions.
Because Cape Canaveral has only one
shuttle launching pad. the Challenger
delav could postpone important shuttle

plans, including a July 30 "flight readi
ness firing" for the new shuttle Atlantis.
One Stanford experiment affected by
the launch delay is the Vehicle Charging
and Potential (VCAP) experiment, in
volving Stanford researchers Peter
Banks, Rock Bush and Roger William
son. VCAP measures the effects on space
plasma when an electron gun is dis
charged from the bay of the shuttle.
Roger Williamson, a senior research
associate in the department of electrical
engineering and a central force behind
the VCAP experiment, flew back to Stan
ford from Johnson Space Center in Hous
ton after the aborted launching. He will
return to Houston when NASA officials
are confident that the shuttle is prepared
to relaunch.
"The biggest problem is that the phase
of the moon will be full rather than new,"

Equipment in the Durand Building's Spacelab 2 monitoring center will be used, but not
until the space shuttle lifts off later this month.
