# Shuttle liftoff halted
## SUNSTAR project on hold 
### REBECCA ZEIGLER Staff writer 
A faulty eight-inch coolant valve in
Florida will have a variety of effects on
experimenters at Stanford and at the new
SUNSTAR (Stanford University Net
work for Space Telescience Application
Research) lab.
The faulty valve caused NASA's Space
Shuttle Challenger, carrying Spacelab 2,
to abort its mission on its Cape
Canaveral. Fla., launch pad Friday after
noon just seconds before liftoff.
NASA is currently planning to
relaunch the shuttle July 29, with a four
day leeway depending on an engine check
scheduled for Sunday. The Challenger
delay will push back the shuttle launch
schedule, creating the possibility of com
bining two late-vear missions.
Because Cape Canaveral has only one
shuttle launching pad. the Challenger
delav could postpone important shuttle

plans, including a July 30 "flight readi
ness firing" for the new shuttle Atlantis.
One Stanford experiment affected by
the launch delay is the Vehicle Charging
and Potential (VCAP) experiment, in
volving Stanford researchers Peter
Banks, Rock Bush and Roger William
son. VCAP measures the effects on space
plasma when an electron gun is dis
charged from the bay of the shuttle.
Roger Williamson, a senior research
associate in the department of electrical
engineering and a central force behind
the VCAP experiment, flew back to Stan
ford from Johnson Space Center in Hous
ton after the aborted launching. He will
return to Houston when NASA officials
are confident that the shuttle is prepared
to relaunch.
"The biggest problem is that the phase
of the moon will be full rather than new,"


Lisa Romerein/Daily
Equipment in the Durand Building's Spacelab 2 monitoring center will be used, but not
until the space shuttle lifts off later this month.
Williamson said. "If we fly at the
time of a full moon, many aspects
of the VCAP experiment will be
compromised.
"The moon on the night side of
the earth will be up and full,
causing a higher light level for the
optical experiments," he ex
plained. "We use low-light televi
sion to look for the electron
beam, vehicle blow and other
parts of the experiment. NASA
planners are aware of the desire
for a new moon, but there are
other aspects of the problem of
scheduling that will take
priority."

The delay, however, appears to
be affecting Stanford's
SUNSTAR lab in a positive way.
"The delay is actually a bless
ing to SUNSTAR because we
were behind schedule," said Mike
Wiskerchen, senior engineering
reseach associate for the project.
"We opened up only three weeks
ago and have been hustling to
support our colleagues here at
Stanford.
"It allows us to set up better
computer communication links
between the Johnson Space Cen
ter and SUNSTAR," he contin
ued. "Since the SUNSTAR
facility is planning to test ad
vanced technology on a number
of shuttle flights over the next two
years, a week to three weeks

delay for us merely postpones the
testing."
The scientists with experiments
on board the shuttle are the most
adversely affected by Friday's
aborted mission because of the
delicate and costly nature of their
materials.
"They have to worry about
whether anything happens to the
instruments sitting in the shuttle
bay on the launchpad, which is
hazardous to say the least," Wis
kerchen said.
Senior research associate Tony
Fraser-Smith and his cohort of
student researchers, who coor
dinated the use of ground radars
with the VCAP electron-beam
firings, also are inconvenienced
by the mission s delay.
