## Doctors say Reagan's polyp was cancerous 
### 
BETHESDA, Md. — Doctors told President
Reagan yesterday he had colon cancer but that they
believe surgeons removed all the malignant tissue
before it spread to other areas of his body.
"The majority of patients in exactly the presi
dent's situation will certainly survive five years and
beyond," said Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National
Cancer Institute.
Rosenberg said he had spoken to the president
about his condition for five minutes, shortly after in
forming the first lady. Reagan's spokesman, Larry
Speakes, said Nancy Reagan "accepted the news in
a very calm fashion."
Navy Capt. Dale Oiler, Reagan's chief surgeon,
quoted the president as saying, "Well, I'm glad that
that's all out," after being informed that a micro
scopic examination of the tissue had determined the
tumor was cancerous.
Oiler also said "the president continues his super
lative recovery*' from the operation Saturday at
Bethesda Naval Hospital to remove the two-inch in
testinal tumor and a two-foot section of the colon
surrounding it.
Rosenberg told reporters at a news briefing at the
hospital, "The president has cancer." But asked if
Reagan now has cancer, the doctor said there was
"a greater than 50 percent chance that the president
now has no cancer, no cancer cells in his body and is
completely cured."
" We have no evidence that this cancer has spread,
and I think the chances are good that no spread will
take place," he said.
The doctor said there is a "greater than 50 per

cent chance" that the second most deadly form of
the disease will not recur during the 74-year-old
president's normal lifespan.
Rosenberg said he would advise the president
that after he recovers from the surgery, "There
should be no change in his activity pattern what
soever" and there is no reason for him to consider
retirement.
The findings did show, however, that the cancer
in the tumor discovered on Friday had invaded the
muscle wall of the bowel, which means doctors
caught it after it had begun to spread. That increases
the likelihood the disease will show up again in the
liver or elsewhere.
But Rosenberg said, "This tumor has not invaded
beyond the wall of the intestine,'" which would
markedly decrease his chances for long-term sur
vival.
"However, there is a chance that the tumor may
recur at some time in the future. It's less than 50
percent," the doctor said.
Reagan should have regular colon examinations
— like the one which uncovered the tumor — as
well as "regular examinations of his lungs, liver and
other body organs to assure they're in the same
healthy condition they're in today," Rosenberg said.
Because radiation and chemotherapy, the most
commonly used treatments after cancer surgery,
have not been found effective in treating colon can
cer, Reagan probably will not be given further
therapy but will be closely monitored for any sign of
recurrence, Rosenberg said.
