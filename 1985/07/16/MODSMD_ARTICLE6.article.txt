# White House calls on Court to repeal abortion ruling
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The
Reagan Administration yester
day urged the Supreme Court
to overturn its 1973 decision
legalizing abortions, arguing
that women should not have a
constitutional right to end their
pregnancies.
Justice Department lawyers
said the 1973 ruling in a case
known as Roe vs. Wade "has
proved inherently un
workable," and wrongly in
fringes on states 1 rights to limit
abortions.
At Bethesda Naval Hospital,
where President Reagan is
recovering from intestinal sur
gery, White House spokesman
Larry Speakes said the presi-'
dent had approved of the
brief s filing.
Both "pro-life" and "pro
choice" forces predicted that
the bold move will fail. The
court two years ago strongly
reaffirmed — by a 6-3 vote —
the 1973 ruling, and its mem
bership has not changed since
that 1983 ruling.
Douglas Johnson, legislative

director of the National Right
to Life Committee, called the
1973 ruling "disastrous" but
added, "I have no reason to
believe that the current Su
preme Court would overturn
the decision."
Judy Goldsmith, president
of the National Organization
for Women, called the attack
on Roe vs. Wade
"unconscionable and perfectly
predictable."
"It is a desperation tactic
that's not going to work," she
said. "It is a continuation of
the Reagan Administration's
war on women."
The government's "friend
of-the-court" brief in two
abortion cases to be studied in
the court term beginning in
October argued that the
justices should "return the law
to the condition in which it
was" before Jan. 22, 1973,
when the decision in Roe vs.
Wade was announced.
That would leave states free
to impose whatever limits they
deemed appropriate.
