# Violence rife in South African towns
## 
### 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa —
Violence swept black townships through
out this white-ruled nation, killing eight
people and injuring dozens in three days,
official and civilian sources reported yes
terday.
Police used whips, rubber bullets, tear
gas and shotguns, and crowds threw stones
and gasoline bombs in clashes in black
townships at Theunissen, Graaff Reinet,
Parys, Oueenstown and Port Elizabeth — a
560-mile swath reaching from the south
coast almost to Johannesburg.
In several cases, accounts by spokesmen
at national police headquarters in Pretoria
and by residents of the townships differed
widely and could not be reconciled. Police
reports listed 41 incidents of rioting in 20
black communities and said at least 45
blacks were arrested.
More than 10 months of rioting against
apartheid, the legalized race-separation

imposed by the white minority, have cost
the lives of about 450 blacks.
Roughly half have died in encounters
with police. The others were killed in fight
ing between rival anti-apartheid groups,
criminal assaults, and attacks on local black
officials and black policemen who are seen
as fronts for white rule.
Residents of Masizakhe township near
Graaff Reinet said police fired tear gas and
rubber bullets at houses, individuals and
groups of blacks for at least five hours yes
terday.
They said police fired on a crowd leaving
a church Sunday night, wounding more
than 20 people and killing a man.
Residents said they were afraid to take
casualties to doctors' offices because police
waited there to arrest the wounded, so they
rounded up vehicles to carry victims to
doctors as far as 155 miles away.

They said the trouble apparently arose
from a general strike and consumer
boycott called Saturday to protest the
slaying by unknown assailants of Matthew
Goniwe, a Cradock teacher whose dismis
sal caused one of the first school boycotts
in early 1984 and made him a nationwide
symbol of resistance.
A spokesman at national police
headquarters in Pretoria, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the only
report he had from Masizakhe was that
police dispersed a stone-throwing crowd
and arrested one man.
The South African Press Association
said pupils threw stones and burned down
two schools in Theunissen. It said several
were injured when police called in rein
forcements to quell the riot.
About 300 people attacked government
buildings and destroyed homes of two
black officials after a high school principal

refused to allow a meeting of the militant
Congress of South African Students, the
agency said.
Police headquarters said it had only a
report of a minor incident at Theunissen.
Residents of Tumahole, near Parys, said
about 200 people marched to the offices of
a white-run administration board to
demand rent reductions. They said houses
of former councilors were stoned and
thousands went on strike in memory of a
man from the township who died in deten
tion a year ago.
One young man and a policeman were
seriously injured, residents reported.
Police said only that they arrested three
blacks after stone-throwing incidents.
George Phake, a member of the
township Civic Association, said three
policemen's houses were burned in
Ratanda, east of Johannesburg, and one
youth was shot dead by police.
