Geldof says concert will stir world
LONDON Irish singer Bob Geldof declared he was over
whelmed by the multirnillion dollar response to the Live Aid con
cert for African famine relief, and predicted yesterday that the
response would stir world governments.
Like it's overwhelming. But it wasn't just the bands. It was
the world s day, said Geldof, leader of the Boomtown Rats, and
now a Nobel Prize nominee feted by government leaders for or
ganizing the two-continent extravaganza.
44 Pop music more than anything else expressed the emotion of
the day, and I think the message is finally, finally getting through
(to governments)," Geldof, 32, said in a telephone interview with
The Associated Press.
Geldof said a final total of the amount raised from the 16-
hour, Saturday concert by the world's top rock stars, beamed
around the globe from stadiums in London and Philadelphia,
would not be known until Thursday.
Kevin Jenden, project director for the Band Aid Trust that will
decide how the funds are spent, estimated in a British Broadcast
ing Corp. interview that the total in pledges and ticket sales
would reach about $55.6 million. That is nearly four times what
Geldof had hoped to raise. Organizers had earlier estimated the
* total would be about $70 million.
Geldof was nominated by Norwegian legislator Sissel Roen
beck for the Nobel Peace Prize and appeared delighted at the
possibility of joining the eminent lineup of past winners.
Legal action vs. hijackers begins
BEIRUT, Lebanon — A prosecutor began legal action against
the Shiite Moslem terrorists who hijacked TWA Flight 847 and
held 39 Americans for 17 days, but they were still at large and
the prosecutor said their identities were not known.
The government said a special army force would impose a
Syrian-sponsored security plan on Moslem West Beirut and the
airport this morning to clear rival militias from the area.
Kamal Hassan Aly, prime minister of Egypt, said before
leaving Cairo for the United States 44 there is a chance" that seven
Americans kidnapped in Lebanon since March 1984 will be
released if the United States lifts its boycott of the Beirut airport.
A U.S. official said he had no information on the matter and
reiterated the American refusal to make deals with terrorists.
Washington has suspended the U.S. landing rights of Lebanese
commercial airlines and asked its allies, with little success, to join
in isolating the airport until security is improved.
Vice Consul Chris English said the U.S. Embassy in Beirut has
been advising Americans to leave Lebanon because of kidnap
pings and violence. "We haven't told them in any formal way or
in a circular to leave, but routinely we advise them when we come
across them that they should leave," he said.
Suicide bomber kills 9 in Israel zone
TEL AVIV, Israel — A suicide bomber in a car bearing a Red
Cross flag blew up a checkpoint and nearby bakery at Israel's
south Lebanon security zone yesterday, killing himself and nine
other people, Israel radio and military sources reported.
They identified the victims as seven Lebanese civilians and two
members of the militia that acts as Israel's surrogate in the area.
The attack was claimed in the name of a pro-Syrian group.
The white Peugeot 504 exploded near the village of Tibnit,
about five miles north of the Israeli border, the radio and military
sources said. It was the third such attack at security-zone check
points in less than a week.
After the explosion, Lebanon's state television broadcast a
videotaped farewell message of a man identified as the suicide
driver. It said he was Hisham Abbass, 20 years old, a member of
the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, a Lebanese group allied with
Syria.
China partially closes 'open door'
PEKING, China — China's economic "open door" policy in
10 cities swung partly shut yesterday, and the nation's leader,
Deng Xiaoping, acknowledged there could be mistakes in his
reform policy.
Still apparently confident he can modernize China, Deng told
visiting Prime Minister George Chambers of Trinidad and
Tobago:
44 If we do not carry out reform and do not persevere in the
open policy, it will be impossible for us to attain our strategic ob
jective of economic development."
Hours later, the official Xinhua news agency quoted Gu Mu,
the state councilor responsible for the open-door strategy, as tel
ling a Japanese delegation that 10 of the 14 coastal cities opened
to overseas investment in April will now restrict foreign con
tracts.
It did not specify the extent of the restriction, but reported that
Gu said it was only a "temporary phenomenon." The govern
ment will give priority tfo the four cities of Shanghai, Canton,
Tianjin and Dalian, the report said.
The cities pulling back are Qinhuangdao, Yantai, Qingdao,
Lianyungang, Nantong, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Zhangjiang
and Beihai.
Deng himself approved opening the coastal areas after touring
China's original four "special economic zones'* of Shenzhen,
Shantou. Zhuhai and Xiamen in January-February 1984.
By the end of 1984 the zones had attracted $840 million in
foreign investment after five years of offering tax breaks, but
much of it was from hotels and tourism rather than sophisticated
industry as Peking had hoped.

Legal action vs. hijackers begins
BEIRUT, Lebanon — A prosecutor began legal action against
the Shiite Moslem terrorists who hijacked TWA Flight 847 and
held 39 Americans for 17 days, but they were still at large and
the prosecutor said their identities were not known.
The government said a special army force would impose a
Syrian-sponsored security plan on Moslem West Beirut and the
airport this morning to clear rival militias from the area.
Kamal Hassan Aly, prime minister of Egypt, said before
leaving Cairo for the United States 44 there is a chance" that seven
Americans kidnapped in Lebanon since March 1984 will be
released if the United States lifts its boycott of the Beirut airport.
A U.S. official said he had no information on the matter and
reiterated the American refusal to make deals with terrorists.
Washington has suspended the U.S. landing rights of Lebanese
commercial airlines and asked its allies, with little success, to join
in isolating the airport until security is improved.
Vice Consul Chris English said the U.S. Embassy in Beirut has
been advising Americans to leave Lebanon because of kidnap
pings and violence. "We haven't told them in any formal way or
in a circular to leave, but routinely we advise them when we come
across them that they should leave," he said.
Suicide bomber kills 9 in Israel zone
TEL AVIV, Israel — A suicide bomber in a car bearing a Red
Cross flag blew up a checkpoint and nearby bakery at Israel's
south Lebanon security zone yesterday, killing himself and nine
other people, Israel radio and military sources reported.
They identified the victims as seven Lebanese civilians and two
members of the militia that acts as Israel's surrogate in the area.
The attack was claimed in the name of a pro-Syrian group.
The white Peugeot 504 exploded near the village of Tibnit,
about five miles north of the Israeli border, the radio and military
sources said. It was the third such attack at security-zone check
points in less than a week.
After the explosion, Lebanon's state television broadcast a
videotaped farewell message of a man identified as the suicide
driver. It said he was Hisham Abbass, 20 years old, a member of
the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, a Lebanese group allied with
Syria.
China partially closes 'open door'
PEKING, China — China's economic "open door" policy in
10 cities swung partly shut yesterday, and the nation's leader,
Deng Xiaoping, acknowledged there could be mistakes in his
reform policy.
Still apparently confident he can modernize China, Deng told
visiting Prime Minister George Chambers of Trinidad and
Tobago:
44 If we do not carry out reform and do not persevere in the
open policy, it will be impossible for us to attain our strategic ob
jective of economic development."
Hours later, the official Xinhua news agency quoted Gu Mu,
the state councilor responsible for the open-door strategy, as tel
ling a Japanese delegation that 10 of the 14 coastal cities opened
to overseas investment in April will now restrict foreign con
tracts.
It did not specify the extent of the restriction, but reported that
Gu said it was only a "temporary phenomenon." The govern
ment will give priority tfo the four cities of Shanghai, Canton,
Tianjin and Dalian, the report said.
The cities pulling back are Qinhuangdao, Yantai, Qingdao,
Lianyungang, Nantong, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Zhangjiang
and Beihai.
Deng himself approved opening the coastal areas after touring
China's original four "special economic zones'* of Shenzhen,
Shantou. Zhuhai and Xiamen in January-February 1984.
By the end of 1984 the zones had attracted $840 million in
foreign investment after five years of offering tax breaks, but
much of it was from hotels and tourism rather than sophisticated
industry as Peking had hoped.
