Soviet spy incarcerated
LOS ANGELES — Svetlana Ogorodnikov, a
Russian emigre whose love affair with an FBI
agent led to espionage charges against her, her
husband and the agent, was sentenced yesterday
to a maximum 18-year sentence for her guilty
plea.
Ogorodnikov, who sometimes had wept during
the trial, showed no reaction as U.S. District
Judge David Kenyon announced the sentence.
She was handcuffed outside court and taken to
the Los Angeles County women's jail pending
her testimony against fired FBI agent Richard
Miller.
Ogorodnikov, 35, and her husband, Nikolay,
52, each pleaded guilty June 26 to a single count
of conspiracy to commit espionage. Nikolay
Ogorodnikov was sentenced that day to eight
years in prison after entering his plea.
An Aug. 6 trial date has been set for trial for
Miller, 48, the first FBI agent indicted on
espionage charges. Svetlana Ogorodnikov is
scheduled to be a witness.

Navy's cheap parts fail
WASHINGTON — The Navy, cracking down
on high-priced spare parts, has for the last two
months been using a cheaper maintenance tool
that is causing more damage to aircraft than the
cost of a $404 wrench that sparked a congres
sional outcry, according to Navy experts.
An internal Navy memo, sent to the Grumman
Aerospace Corp. and Navy aircraft maintenance
commands and obtained by the Associated Press,
deals with a type of specially modified socket
wrench made by Grumman for mechanics
working on the ejection seats of F-14 Tomcats,
A-6 Intruders and EA-6B Prowlers.
There are more than 850 such aircraft in the
Navy's inventory. According to the memo, the
Navy has switched to cheaper wrenches that are
causing damage to the metal plating on the firing
heads of ejection seats.
Last May, congressional investigators disclosed
the Miramar Naval Air Station outside San Diego
had been paying $404 for the Grumman
wrenches and $659 for aircraft ashtrays.
