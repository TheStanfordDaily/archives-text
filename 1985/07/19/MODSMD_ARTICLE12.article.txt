# 'We' are too careless
## 
### 
One afternoon, slightly more than a week ago, I
was attempting to get my rent check attached to the
refrigerator with a fruit-shaped magnet and make
good my escape before my landlady came out to tor
ment me. Luck had clearly abandoned me that day.
for the kitchen door opened and my landlady
swooped in, wearing purple velour coordinated
action-wear and carrying a copy of the Times
Tribune.
"Have you seen this?" she asked, thrusting the
paper in my face. Like an idiot, I said that I had not.
She then proceeded to recount the saga of the TWA
Flight 847 hostages in excruciating detail, obviously
pretty upset about the whole thing and particularly
incensed by the killing of Navy diver Robert Stet
hem. She eventually concluded that it was time that
we "go and kill us a few Shiites."
On the letters page of that selfsame issue of the
Times Tribune, another suburban lady came to a
remarkably similar conclusion. Ms. Suburbinite. of
Menlo Park, after first declaring for the record that
she would be more than willing to lay down her life
for the United States if the situation called for it.
maintained that it was vital to American security
that we go to Lebanon and show those fanatics that
they do not lightly toy with the United States of
America.
Both of these women belong in an elementary
grammar class, because they have both demon
strated a gross unfamiliarity with pronouns, espe
cially the pronoun "we." They both declared that
"we" should go overseas and start trying to kill
Shiite Moslems. I personally suspect that neither
one of them has any wish to go to Lebanon and take
a hand in the process of killing us a few Shiites.
Since the pronoun "we" includes the speaker, they
are therefore incorrect. What they should have said
is that we would like you to go to Lebanon and kill
Shiites for us.
I am reasonably certain that my landlady does not
wish to include herself in the "we" that go to
Lebanon to fight, since she would then be unable to
get $300 a month for half of a garage in Palo Alto.
And although Ms. Suburbanite, of Menlo Park, said
in her letter that she would gladly lay down her life
at the appropriate moment, I don't honestly think
she was planning on being a part of the "we" that
gets sent to Lebanon either.
It is my opinion that whenever somebody says
that they are willing to lay down their life, they have

already subconsciously calculated the probability of
someone taking them up on their offer.
It seems that many of the bigger hawks in Wash
ington think along the same lines and have the same
grammatical problems as suburban California
ladies. Georgia Republican Newt Gingrich, for ex
ample, has often expressed the opinion that it is high
time we teach those fanatics a lesson and kill them.
Representative Newt just turned 41 years old. This
means that 20 years ago, in the middle of our last
war, he was of prime age to be a participating part of
the "we" that was doing the fighting. At the time.

however, Congressman Newt decided that we
should take a draft deferment and stay in college,
instead of fighting for democracy and Sweet Baby
Jesus in Vietnam. But now that the honorable con
gressman is older, greyer and much too old to ever
see military duty, he thinks that "we" should use
force to show these lunatics that they aren't going to
be able to push us around.
Sylvester Stallone feels the same way. Until
recently, nobody realized that Stallone was a
politician, let alone one of the president's trusted
advisors. He has recommended that it is about time
that we stop acting like a bunch of wimps and go in
there and rescue our buddies and restore the dignity
of our country in the process. Twenty years ago,
however, when Sylvester was also of prime age to
take a personal hand in saving the dignity of the
United States, he had extended business to attend to
in Canada.
In a way it is almost comforting to see how. as we
get older, it will become so much easier to decide
what we should do, until we are ready to make any
sacrifice to do what we think is right. •
