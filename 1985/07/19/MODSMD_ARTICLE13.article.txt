Administration
manipulations
In late May 1985, three full
time staff people were requested
by the "comprehensive student
proposal for a stronger Univer
sity investment policy Under
this plan, those staff people
would not work under the super
vision of the Treasurer's Office,
and a student representative
from the ASSU Nominations
Commission or from the Com
mission on Investment Responsi
bility would be present during, or
contribute to, the selection
process of these staff people.
On June 14, the Trustee Com
mittee on Investments accepted
the additional resource commit
ment, but it rejected the inde
pendence of the staff people and
the hiring procedure suggested
by the students' proposal. Uni
versity President Donald Ken
nedy stated that the recruiting
would comply with normal Uni
versity procedures, in which stu
dents do not play a role. Never
theless, he emphasized the im
portance of informal cooperation
and mutual trust, saying that
students' assistance would be
highly appreciated.
I asked the Investment Re
sponsibility Task Force whether
it was reasonable for me to look
over the resumes of a consider
able pool of finalists for the re
search job, and they agreed.
But after many a day, I got
tired of waiting and called pro
gram manager Susan Termohlen.
The immediate response I got
was shocking: "I'm sorry, but
hiring decisions have been made
and your informal assistance was
not necessary." Did they really
mean "desirable?"
Susan Termohlen, Larry
Owen, University Treasurer

Rodney Adams and William
Massy, vice president for busi
ness and finance, were present
on June 14 and should have
heard the general appreciation
for some kind of informal
cooperation, although maintain
ing the University's hiring
procedures.
In her letter of July 5, Ter
mohlen acknowledged that she
should have called me prior to
making final offers and that the
administration lacked sufficient
consideration for my position.
Although gracious, the letter
reflects an unacceptable philoso
phy given the following few
points:
1. It is quite unfair and un
diplomatic to try and justify the
planned oversight of a promised
cooperation.
2. The letter makes an attempt
to prove the necessity of a quick
decision. So what? Personally, I
was waiting for days; my
cooperation wouldn't have
delayed the decisions.
3. The letter claims that the
administration preferred to hire
undergraduates, given the
"routine" nature of the research.
If I were an undergraduate, I
would feel insulted by their
assessment of my abilities as
ordinary or mediocre. As a
graduate, I think it is unfair,
uneconomic and unwise to ex
clude graduates from being con
sidered at a similar salary.
I write this letter not with the
intention of sharpening existing
differences, but with a strong
sense of duty to inform the stu
dent body about those seemingly
repetitive manipulations by the
administration, manipulations
even the majority of trustees are
not always aware of.
