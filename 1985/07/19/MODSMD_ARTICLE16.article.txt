## Ming's: half the spice at twice the price 
### 
Let's face it, you've heard of
the place. Unless you've managed
to remain totally oblivious to the
world "off campus" while at
Stanford, the name "Ming's"
should sound familiar.
A landmark and tradition in
Palo Alto since 1956, Ming's spe
cializes in Cantonese recipes from
"Old China."
The interior of the restaurant is
dimly lit, which is probably a
good idea because there is not a
great deal of decor to observe.
The walls are not cluttered with
ornate, gaudy decorations, yet
neither are they subtly and
elegantly conceived. The inside is,
in fact, comprised primarily of
muted shades of red and white.
The atmosphere of the place is
in direct contrast to the starkness
of the decor. Waiters rush busily
about, offering steaming
towelettes one moment and
checking to be sure you have
enough food the next.
While the overzealous service
was appreciated in principle, it
was a bit difficult to enjoy the
meal with all the noise, bustle and
confusion in the restaurant. The

waiters seemed rushed (at least
three waited on us), and it was
uncomfortable having them hover
nearby and watch us eat.
There is quite a variety of
dishes for the waiters to serve, as
Ming's menu is incredibly exten
sive. There are four types of
"dinner for two" and a wide se
lection of individual entrees, in
cluding 10 different chicken
dishes.

The menu's flaw, however, is
the cost of the food, which
seemed rather exorbitant — the
price paid for an appetizer at
Ming's (eggrolls at $6.75) would
entitle you to an entree at another
Chinese restaurant.
My guest and I ordered the
"small" appetizer assortment for

$9. We were talked out of the
"large" portion by our waiter,
who assured us that we had or
dered too much. It didn't appear
to be "too much" when it arrived
at our table.
Admittedly, there was a won
derful selection of eggrolls, fried
wonton, barbequed pork and
spareribs, fried prawns and
rumaki (a delicious deep-fried
combination of prawns wrapped

in bacon), but there were only
bite-sized portions of each, hardly
making it worth the price.
The least expensive dish on the
menu is the Almond Chicken at
$6.50, and prices range up to
$22.50 for the Peking Duck, but
the average entree costs approxi
mately $8 to $10.

My guest and I ordered the din
ner for two entitled "Sung,"
which wasn't bought for a song at
$13.50 a person. It included
chicken salad, Ming's beef,
chicken with water chestnuts and
snowpeas, pressed Mandarin
duck and pork fried rice.
Wanting to sample some of
Ming's seafood rather than two
poultry dishes, we requested a
substitution of prawns for the

duck. The change was not easy to
accomodate — $2.25 was added
to our bill.
The service was incredibly
quick and, although it was rushed,
there was always a continuous
stream of food. The waiters
served the portions for you, which
could be considered a courtesy or

a bit of an aggravation, depending
on your point of view.
The chicken salad made our
eyes water — probably due to the
price, as well as the spice. We had
few complaints about the quality
of the food — although the
prawns did have a distinctly
"fishy" taste.
Ming's Beef, touted on the
menu as a "Must at Ming's," was
excellent — marinated and ten
derly cooked in a special Ming's
sauce.
But nothing else stood out as
especially mouthwatering.
What did stand out was the size
of the portions, which my guest
and I both found to be much too
small. We had no problem finish
ing each dish — a first for either
one of us at a Chinese restaurant.
By the end of the evening, we
had eaten almost $50 worth of
food that wasn't quite as special
as we had anticipated. Maybe our
expectations were too high from
the beginning but, in our eyes,
Ming's didn't quite live up to it's
statuesque reputation.
