# U2 not wide awake on new album
## 
### 
David Byrne
"Music for the Knee Plays"
(ECM)
This collaboration between the
chief Talking Head (Byrne) and
Robert Wilson is the soundtrack
for the latter's "Civil Wars." As
such Byrne is freed from the
limitations which are placed upon
him by the (basically) conven
tional pop structure of the
Talking Heads (see "Little
Creatures"). To help paint the
background for this play, Byrne
was inspired by the Dirty Dozen
Brass Band of New Orleans. The
slow percussive sounds of brass
and organ dominate and pervade
the entire work. Over this bed
Byrne has composed severely
minimalist lyrics with which to
complement both the music and
the drama.
Byrne's lyrics are fascinating at
times and wildly absurdist at
other points ("In The Future"),
but at the very least interesting.
He retains the ability to take the
most mundune and minute detail
and make it's exposition seem
like a revelation ("Sound Of
Business"). Unlike the latest ef

fort by The Heads, this is not a
party album; it is great mood
music, dirgish and dank. Byrne
has created an aural landscape for
a barren future world full of
alienation and loathing. If The
Talking Heads are the "thinking
person's band," then "Knee
Plays" is the Orwellian "Speaking
in Tongues."

U2
Wide Awake in America (Island)
This four-song EP was released
as a momento for the die-hard
fans of this Irish quartet. The A
side is comprised of two live
tracks recorded on the European
leg of "The Unforgettable Fire"
tour, the B side, studio outtakes
for the album of the same name.
The live tracks definitely make
for new interpretations of these
songs. "Bad" is expanded and
driven by the intensity and pas
sion of Bono's vocal. The Edge's
swirling guitar helps propel the
song to a crescendo. Bono's emo
tion and pain are readily evident
(in concert the song was dedi
cated to a friend of Bono's who

had overdosed on heroin) and
keep it from slipping into the
maudlin. Similar to Lou Reed's
"Heroin," Nils Lofgren's
"Beggar's Day"and Neil Young's
"The Needle and the Damage
Done," "Bad" makes a signifi
cant statement. "A Sort of
Homecoming" is more reflective

Daily
album
shorts

than its studio predecessor, and
thus more effective. The song
begins very slowly until the whole
band kicks in and shows why U2
is known for excellent concerts.
The B side is interesting, but
more for fans only. "Three
Sunrises" has much the same stri
dent chords that were found on
1983's "War." There is the
trademark slashing guitar,
booming bass and even some
feedback. Still, it has the feel of a

studio jam rather than a polished
and refined effort. The same
criticism can be leveled at "Love
Comes Tumbling"; it is vaguely
funky, but meanders without di
rection or purpose. It is pleasant
but mindless. In sum, this EP will
not win over many new fans; it
will somewhat placate those
already loyal to the band. For the
same price "Under a Blood Red
Sky" is an infinitely better buy, it
also holds together as a concept.
"Wide Awake in America" seems
more like a tour book than
serious artistic statement.
C
"Tommy Boy's Greatest Beats"
(Tommy Boy)
The "Tommy Boy Megamix,"
which comprises the entirety of
the fourth side of this double al
bum, is worth the price tag alone.
Segments of practically every
song this small, independent,
New Jersey funk label has put out
have been masterfully interwoven
by the winners of the "Tommy
Boy 'Renegades Of Funk' Big
Beat Bust Out Mastermix II."
This is the definite statement on

the hip-hop scene. The rest of this
compilation is equally won
derous; Tommy Boy has always
been in the forefront of the funk
scene, and it's best and brightest
talents are ably showcased in this
arena. '
Included in the Tommy Boy
stable are Afrika Bambaata &
Soulsonic Force ("Planet Rock,"
which started the electro-pop
funk movement), Jonzun Crew
("Pack Jam"), the Force M.D.s
and Malcom X ("No Sellout") to
name just a few of the luminaries
featured here. The flaws with the
disc are two-fold; most of the
songs are edited versions, not the
full 12 inch singles. Additionally,
the producers left off both
"Unity" by Bambaata and James
Brown and "World Destruction"
by Timezone featuring Bambaata
and Johnny Rotten. Still, all the
performances are fresh and daz
zling as well as club smashes.
Don't miss this one — all the
twelve inch singles would cost a
bundle.
B
Chris Issak
"Silvertone" (Warner Bros.)
Stockton native Chris Issak
turns in a very solid and enter
taining effort with his major label
debut. Issak benefits from riding

the crest of the wave termed
"American Music." The sound
that he shapes along with his
band, Silvertone, is distinctly
reminiscent of a earlier era in
Americana. The influences of
Presley, Orbison, Holly, Williams
and Lewis are quite apparent.
Nonetheless, Issak's style comes
across as distinctive and in

dividualistic. This disc is buoyed
by a strong voice, a dark, eerie,
almost Faustian passion and a
very tight and competent band.
These songs all sound neo-fiftyish,
with hints of country and rock
abilly tossed in.
The album is impeccably
produced by Erik Jacobsen. The
density of sound at times harkens

to Phil Spector's "Wall of Sound,"
and the compositions are lis
tenable and filled with hooks (see
the first single, "Dancin' '). The
themes are often very haunting
and cry of unrequited love (''The
Lonely Ones," "Pretty Girls
Don't Cry," "Unhappiness,"
"Funeral In The Rain"). Issak s
live performances reflect the abil

ity and potential for much greater
things, and this album reinforces
this judgement. Only time (and
the record-buying public) can be
the ultimate judge, but this is a
man definitely worth a listen.

and the compositions are lis
tenable and filled with hooks (see
the first single, "Dancin' '). The
themes are often very haunting
and cry of unrequited love (''The
Lonely Ones," "Pretty Girls
Don't Cry," "Unhappiness,"
"Funeral In The Rain"). Issak s
live performances reflect the abil

ity and potential for much greater
things, and this album reinforces
this judgement. Only time (and
the record-buying public) can be
the ultimate judge, but this is a
man definitely worth a listen.

David Byrne
"Music for the Knee Plays"
(ECM)
This collaboration between the
chief Talking Head (Byrne) and
Robert Wilson is the soundtrack
for the latter's "Civil Wars." As
such Byrne is freed from the
limitations which are placed upon
him by the (basically) conven
tional pop structure of the
Talking Heads (see "Little
Creatures"). To help paint the
background for this play, Byrne
was inspired by the Dirty Dozen
Brass Band of New Orleans. The
slow percussive sounds of brass
and organ dominate and pervade
the entire work. Over this bed
Byrne has composed severely
minimalist lyrics with which to
complement both the music and
the drama.
Byrne's lyrics are fascinating at
times and wildly absurdist at
other points ("In The Future"),
but at the very least interesting.
He retains the ability to take the
most mundune and minute detail
and make it's exposition seem
like a revelation ("Sound Of
Business"). Unlike the latest ef

fort by The Heads, this is not a
party album; it is great mood
music, dirgish and dank. Byrne
has created an aural landscape for
a barren future world full of
alienation and loathing. If The
Talking Heads are the "thinking
person's band," then "Knee
Plays" is the Orwellian "Speaking
in Tongues."

U2
Wide Awake in America (Island)
This four-song EP was released
as a momento for the die-hard
fans of this Irish quartet. The A
side is comprised of two live
tracks recorded on the European
leg of "The Unforgettable Fire"
tour, the B side, studio outtakes
for the album of the same name.
The live tracks definitely make
for new interpretations of these
songs. "Bad" is expanded and
driven by the intensity and pas
sion of Bono's vocal. The Edge's
swirling guitar helps propel the
song to a crescendo. Bono's emo
tion and pain are readily evident
(in concert the song was dedi
cated to a friend of Bono's who

had overdosed on heroin) and
keep it from slipping into the
maudlin. Similar to Lou Reed's
"Heroin," Nils Lofgren's
"Beggar's Day"and Neil Young's
"The Needle and the Damage
Done," "Bad" makes a signifi
cant statement. "A Sort of
Homecoming" is more reflective

Daily
album
shorts

than its studio predecessor, and
thus more effective. The song
begins very slowly until the whole
band kicks in and shows why U2
is known for excellent concerts.
The B side is interesting, but
more for fans only. "Three
Sunrises" has much the same stri
dent chords that were found on
1983's "War." There is the
trademark slashing guitar,
booming bass and even some
feedback. Still, it has the feel of a

studio jam rather than a polished
and refined effort. The same
criticism can be leveled at "Love
Comes Tumbling"; it is vaguely
funky, but meanders without di
rection or purpose. It is pleasant
but mindless. In sum, this EP will
not win over many new fans; it
will somewhat placate those
already loyal to the band. For the
same price "Under a Blood Red
Sky" is an infinitely better buy, it
also holds together as a concept.
"Wide Awake in America" seems
more like a tour book than
serious artistic statement.
C
"Tommy Boy's Greatest Beats"
(Tommy Boy)
The "Tommy Boy Megamix,"
which comprises the entirety of
the fourth side of this double al
bum, is worth the price tag alone.
Segments of practically every
song this small, independent,
New Jersey funk label has put out
have been masterfully interwoven
by the winners of the "Tommy
Boy 'Renegades Of Funk' Big
Beat Bust Out Mastermix II."
This is the definite statement on

the hip-hop scene. The rest of this
compilation is equally won
derous; Tommy Boy has always
been in the forefront of the funk
scene, and it's best and brightest
talents are ably showcased in this
arena. '
Included in the Tommy Boy
stable are Afrika Bambaata &
Soulsonic Force ("Planet Rock,"
which started the electro-pop
funk movement), Jonzun Crew
("Pack Jam"), the Force M.D.s
and Malcom X ("No Sellout") to
name just a few of the luminaries
featured here. The flaws with the
disc are two-fold; most of the
songs are edited versions, not the
full 12 inch singles. Additionally,
the producers left off both
"Unity" by Bambaata and James
Brown and "World Destruction"
by Timezone featuring Bambaata
and Johnny Rotten. Still, all the
performances are fresh and daz
zling as well as club smashes.
Don't miss this one — all the
twelve inch singles would cost a
bundle.
B
Chris Issak
"Silvertone" (Warner Bros.)
Stockton native Chris Issak
turns in a very solid and enter
taining effort with his major label
debut. Issak benefits from riding

the crest of the wave termed
"American Music." The sound
that he shapes along with his
band, Silvertone, is distinctly
reminiscent of a earlier era in
Americana. The influences of
Presley, Orbison, Holly, Williams
and Lewis are quite apparent.
Nonetheless, Issak's style comes
across as distinctive and in

dividualistic. This disc is buoyed
by a strong voice, a dark, eerie,
almost Faustian passion and a
very tight and competent band.
These songs all sound neo-fiftyish,
with hints of country and rock
abilly tossed in.
The album is impeccably
produced by Erik Jacobsen. The
density of sound at times harkens

to Phil Spector's "Wall of Sound,"
and the compositions are lis
tenable and filled with hooks (see
the first single, "Dancin' '). The
themes are often very haunting
and cry of unrequited love (''The
Lonely Ones," "Pretty Girls
