# OMD is more than electronic noise
## 
### PHIL CHEN 
I entered the Kabuki nightclub
Tuesday night having never at
tended a concert by a synthesizer
based band, and I feared a dull
performance by a bunch of serene
young men standing behind long
black boxes and several com
puters.
However, Orchestral Manoeu
vres in the Dark came
through with a good show,
playing about 75 minutes of old
favorites culled from their four
previous albums as well as new
material from their latest record,
"Crush."
The band, known as OMD,
formed in Liverpool in 1978.
Using synthesizers and drum
machines, band founders and
high school chums Paul
Humphreys and Andrew McClus
key create music that is primarily
electronic. However, they have
acoustic instruments and McClus
key's soulful voice to add a

human touch that other synth
pop bands lack.
The band quickly established
itself on the English charts and
has done well ever since, although
they have always been a bit too
quirky and ''British" for the
American masses.
Their first set Tuesday night
began with the title track to
"Crush." Lead singer McCluskey
screwed his eyes shut and twisted
his body about in a spastic dance,
singing with an intensity that
added immeasurably to the rather
simple lyrics.
Both McCluskey and
Humphreys sang on "Secret,"
thereby exposing one of OMD's
weak points. Humphreys has a
wonderfully wistful, electronically
layered voice, but his singing style
is wooden and lifeless; he stares
at the spot lights, his face devoid
of emotion. Pacing was another
problem for the band; they
paused after every song, making

their performance seem choppy,
as if they were showcasing each
song separately instead of playing
a concert. Then, about 45
minutes into the show, the power
on stage went out, leaving all the
electronic equipment dead and
forcing the band to take a 10-
minute break.
Despite these troubles, the
music was terrific. Surprisingly
and happily, OMD brought along
some real, human brass players to
replace the synth-made sounds
often featured in their songs;
these guys had a great time shuf
fling their feet when they weren't
blasting on their horns. OMD
kept the dance beats going with
"Tesla Girls," "Enola Gay" and
"Telegraph," among others.
McCluskey was constantly ex
horting the crowd to get on their
feet and dance. Of the slower
paced tunes, "Motion and Heart"
was particularly fine, thanks to
the horns, and "White Trash"

was superb.
Two forgettable bands opened
for OMD, My Sin and The Mys
teries.
But these are minor points.
OMD proved that a band that

relies on electronic instruments in
the studio can still put on a decent
live show if they are willing to use
non-electronic instruments to
avoid the dullness of a clinically
perfect concert.


Andrew McCluskey and Paul Humphreys, members of OMD, added a
" human touch" to their concert Tuesday night at the Kabuki nightclub
in San Francisco's Japan Center.
