# ASSU Senate meeting
## Senate taps DUI jurors 
### REBECCA ZEIGLER Staff writer 
According to graduate Senate member Eric Berg,
Tuesday night's ASSU Senate meeting was "pretty
mundane."
At the the request of Sally Cole, the University's
judicial affairs officer, the senate appointed student
members to the Stanford Judicial Council (SJC) to
act as a jury in the drunk driving case of Stanford
student Joe Anderson. The SJC normally serves as
the jury in trials involving alleged violations of the
University's Fundamental Standard.
Anderson, accompanied by his girlfriend and at
torney, observed the ASSU meeting to ensure that
the jurors were chosen legitimately. Senate Chair
Richard Beigel spoke privately with Anderson after
the meeting and said Anderson was "satisfied" with
the SJC approvals.

"The senate discussed and approved some minor
procedural changes," said Council of Presidents
member Leslie Leland, noting that the schedule for
groups to apply for funding for next year was ap
proved. "But we didn't talk about the Coffee
House."
The senate also addressed, but did not make a
decision on, changing the amount of time allowed
speakers from the community during each meeting's
open forum session.
"The senate was trying to limit the amount of
time people speak in an open forum, an attempt to
shorten their meetings," Leland explained.
The next ASSU Senate meeting, rescheduled for
8 p.m. on July 30, promises to be more exciting. At
that time, final decisions about the Coffee House
and its task force will be made. The senate also
hopes to have Margaret Fidler, the assistant dean of
students, speak at the meeting.
