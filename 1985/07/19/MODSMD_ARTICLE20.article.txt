## More AIDS in sight 
### FELICIA PAIK 
Stanford Medical Center sci
entists have predicted a dismal
outlook for the spread of AIDS
(Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome).
"In San Francisco two to four
people are expected to die from
AIDS every day next year,"
wrote two Stanford doctors in
the current issue of Stanford
Medicine. "The first 7,200
cases consumed more than 1.3
million hospital days and
generated more than $1 billion
in health care costs."
In their article, Dr. Edgar
Engelman and Dr. Jeff Lifson
stress that blood banks and so
ciety in general needs to realize
the implications of the disease
and the scope of the problem.
"Nearly 10,000 cases of
AIDS have been documented,"
reported Engelman and Lifson,
a postdoctoral fellow in the pa
thology department. Engelman
is an associate professor of pa
thology and the director of the
Stanford Blood Bank.
"Reported cases doubled in all
risk groups in 1984 and are ex
pected to double again in 1985.
The true number is probably at
least three times and possibly as
many as 10 times greater."
Two years ago, the Stanford

Blood Bank became the first to
screen blood to prevent the
transmission of AIDS, although
the risk of the transmission of
the disease is relatively small,
only about one in every
100,000.
Screening blood at Stanford
was met by "negative and hos
tile" feelings from other blood
bank institutions', according to
Engelman and Lifson. The main
objection, they said, was that
"screening was unnecessary be
cause there was no proof that
AIDS was transmissible by
blood transfusion." However,
no cases of AIDS have-been re
ported among those who have
received screened blood at
Stanford.
AIDS surfaced in 1981 in the
form of a new virus called
HTLV-3 with "the relatively
acute onset of unusual and life
threatening infections or malig
nant tumors in previously
healthy individuals," Engleman
and Lifson wrote. Initially, the
disease affected four main seg
ments of the population —
homosexual men, intravenous
drug abusers, hemophiliacs and
recent Haitian immigrants.
"For the first three of these
groups, transmission of an in
fectious agent seemed likely

either through sexual contact
involving exchange of bodily
fluids, puncture of the skin with
contaminated needles or injec
tion with contaminated blood
products," the article states.
This suggestion that AIDS
could be transmitted by blood
transfusions was widely denied
at first because of the implica
tions. Since blood banks in the
U.S. are dependent on volun
teer donors, they are well aware
of their public image. A
decrease in blood donations did
occur even though it is not pos
sible to contract the disease by
donating blood.
"The highly charged atmos
phere surrounding AIDS, in
cluding the devastating fatal na
ture of the illness and the public
relations connotations of the
population groups —
homosexual men and in
travenous drug abusers — at
highest risk for transmitting the
disease constituted yet another
reason to downplay any connec
tion between blood banking and
AIDS," Engleman and Lifson
wrote.
Engelman presently sees no
real cure for AIDS in sight.
"Science has not come up with
any anti-viral drug to this day,"
he said.
