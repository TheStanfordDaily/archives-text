## Elwaysâ€™ football camp Campers say no free ride 
### MARK ZEIGLER Editorial staff 
The Stanford Athletic Department remained
silent about the possibility of an NCAA investiga
tion after a high school player said he attended
Football Coach Jack Elway's football camp last
month for free.

Sports roundup

Even if Neil Williams, who will be a senior at
West Charlotte (N.C.) High School this fall, did not
lie when he told the Los Angeles Times that
"Stanford paid for the camp for me," an NCAA
recruiting violation, it appears he would be alone in
such a claim.

In a random sampling of campers conducted this
week by The Daily, all those contacted said they had
paid their own way. In addition, none of the camp
ers contacted said he had heard of anyone else at
tending camp free.
Williams, who subsequently paid for the Football
Camp with the Elways after a call from Stanford
Athletic Director Andy Geiger, was made off-limits
to the press by his parents. However, his father, Neil
Williams Sr., did speak with The Daily on the phone
Tuesday night.
"I think it was an honest mistake," Willaims Sr.
told The Daily, referring to the football office's con
tention that his son's free ride at the week-long

camp was an accounting mix-up. "And I know of
nobody else who had camp paid for them.
"My understanding is that this is a camp,"he con
tinued. "As far as we're concerned, it was an oppor
tunity to learn something, have some fun and see
another part of the country."
Although Stanford Recruiting Coordinator Dick
James told the Times that Williams, a quarterback,
was a top prospect, Williams' father said his son had
not been heavily recruited.
"At this point, all he'll get is questionnaires and
forms to fill out," Williams Sr. said. "He'll get let
ters occasionally."
Williams Sr. said the Times interviewed his son at
the camp."The way I understand it, when he was at
camp, one of the (Stanford) staffers told him (the
Times reporter) to talk to our boy," Williams ex

plained.
"If there was a conspiracy (in granting free camp
attendance), I don't think they would potentially
point a reporter in that direction."
Most of the out-of-state campers interviewed said
they had heard about the camp through mailings
from the Stanford football office. Letters encour
aged them to attend the camp, they said, but did not
indicate that tuition would be waived.
In some better news for Stanford football, the
head coach became a grandfather and the running
back coach a father Wednesday, all with the same
baby.
