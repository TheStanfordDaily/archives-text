Stanford police are investigat
ing a strong-arm robbery at the
Law School Tuesday night.
Barbara Dray, associate dean
for development at Stanford, said
she received a sprained neck and
facial abrasions when her purse
was snatched at 7:30 p.m. in a
basement corridor of the Law
School, according to Stanford
Police Capt. Marvin Moore.
"We have a suspect that we're
working on," Moore said yester
day. "If the one suspect we have
pans out, that's good. If he
doesn't, then we'll try to find a
new one."
Moore said Dray described her
assailant as a muscular black
male, about 5-foot-10 to 6-0 tall
and weighing about 200 pounds.
According to Dray, he was clean
shaven, had short Afro-style hair
and was wearing a T-shirt, blue
jeans and tennis shoes.
A person of similar description
allegedly asked two other Law
School employees about the law
library's closing time shortly
before the robbery.
Dray received injuries to her
face and neck when the assailant
threw her to the ground, accord
ing to Moore. "It wasn't an attack
in the sexual sense, but it was an

attack on her person," Moore ex
plained. "There was no weapon
used other than physical force."
Moore said that "it's been a
while" since the last strong-arm
robbery on the central campus.
"One of the last incidents of
this type that I can remember was
during the Super Bowl (in Janu
ary)," he added. "We usually
have a couple or three of them a
vear."
