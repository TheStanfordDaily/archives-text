# Drunk driving ruling awaited
## 
### JONATHAN PAUL Staff writer 
The Stanford Judicial Council
Wednesday night voted to
proceed with a decision in the
case of a sophomore who could
face expulsion for allegedly
driving under the influence of al
cohol.
Joseph Anderson has been
charged with violating the Uni
versity's Fundamental Standard
for allegedly driving under the in
fluence of alcohol from Florence
Moore Hall to Delta Upsilon
house April 17. He faces possible
expulsion from the University if
found guilty.
The Anderson case marks the
first time that Fundamental Stan
dard charges have been filed
against a Stanford student for
driving under the influence of al
cohol.
Anderson requested a con
tinuance at the meeting, but
Wednesday's SJC vote makes a
ruling on that charge likely within
a week. The SJCs decision would
then take effect upon approval
from the President's Office,
which rarely overturns SJC
recommendations.
Anderson's attorney, Thomas
Crary, claimed that while there
have been many instances of
Stanford students being arrested
for driving while intoxicated on
campus, his client is the first ever
to be charged with academic vio
lations.
"Mr. Anderson is unfairly
being singled out as no other
[student] has been in the past for
disciplinary procedures," Crary
said.
Anderson's attorney has re
quested from the Stanford Police
Department "data relating to the
nature and number of other inci
dents where people were arrested

for drunk driving in the last five
years" in order to substantiate his
claim that the University has al
ways deferred to the courts in
cases involving drunken driving.
A council member also cited a
1981 case in which two students
were killed and a third injured in
an automobile accident on
campus. The driver was later con
victed of felony drunken driving
and manslaughter, but no Funda
mental Standard charges were
brought against him by the Uni
versity.
Anderson's attorney argued
that it is hypocritical of the Uni
versity to "look the other way at
other violations of state laws
which proscribe the use of or fur
nishing of alcohol to minors" and
then threaten to discipline his
client for qualitatively similar
conduct.
"I believe these (Stanford
Police Department) records will
show that no Stanford students
have ever been arrested in fact for
consuming alcoholic beverages
because they weren't of age by
the Stanford Police Department,"
Crary continued.
Crary then claimed the Stan
ford police axe obstructing his
ability to see these records, saying
that Police Chief Marvin Her
rington "is being uncooperative."
Crary moved to postpone the
Anderson case until Herrington
has provided the records in ques
tion and argued that his client
could not be held responsible for
the delays caused by Herrington.
"I requested these records not
yesterday or the day before in an
attempt to delay," Crary said, "I
requested the records back in
June and fully expected to have
the information by now."
Sally Cole, the University's
judicial affairs officer who pre
sented the University's case,
argued against granting the
postponement.
"I find it grandly irrelevant,"
Cole said, "how many cases there
may be on record of Stanford stu
dents arrested in the last
umpteenth years for drunken
driving on campus.
"I see no institutional interest,"
Cole continued, "I think it would
be at institutional cost to
postpone his hearing."
The council then met in private
session and unanimously decided
not to grant the postponement,
but to instead proceed "under the
assumption that no one who has
been charged with drunken
driving has (previously) been
charged with violating the Funda
mental Standard."
Anderson, who also faces crim
inal prosecution for the same inci
dent, refrained from answering
questions during the hearing since
any statements he made could
later be used against him in the
criminal proceedings, but he did
read from a prepared text.
In his prepared statement An
derson commented on the
awkwardness of his situation. He
noted that to the extent that he
exercises his Constitutional right
to remain silent in the court case,
he is constrained in his ability to
defend himself personally in SJC
hearings.
The criminal case involves the
charge of failing to report
damaged property in addition to
driving while intoxicated. A wit
ness allegedly saw Anderson back

over several bicycles when he left
Florence Moore Hall.
Anderson and all of the pas
sengers in the car, however, claim
they did not know they had
backed into the bicycles. Cole is
not citing failure to report
damaged property as a basis for
the alleged Fundamental Stan
dard violation.
"I will even grant that
(Anderson did not know about
the bicycles)," Cole said at the
hearing.
In response to the claim that,
by prosecuting Anderson for a
Fundamental Standard violation,
the University is attempting to
implement back door changes in
its disciplinary policy, Cole
replied, "I don't think it is a sub
stantial [change]."
However Cole could not cite
any Fundamental Standard cases
involving alcohol abuse which did
not center on the charge of physi
cal assault.
"Even if it were [a substantial
change]," Cole added, "there is
no obligation that we give any
notice that we are going to do
something different.
"No one in my office to date
has viewed charging Mr. Ander
son with a Fundamental Standard
violation as a gross departure
from prior Fundamental Standard
investigations."
Cole concluded, "I think
there's been a lot of confusion
about the distinctions between
the University process and the
process that goes on in the courts
where a student's misconduct is
also a violation of the law.
"The University disciplinary
process exists to respond to stu
dent misconduct with respect to
our expectations tor how people
ought to behave."

June and fully expected to have
the information by now."
Sally Cole, the University's
judicial affairs officer who pre
sented the University's case,
argued against granting the
postponement.
"I find it grandly irrelevant,"
Cole said, "how many cases there
may be on record of Stanford stu
dents arrested in the last
umpteenth years for drunken
driving on campus.
"I see no institutional interest,"
Cole continued, "I think it would
be at institutional cost to
postpone his hearing."
The council then met in private
session and unanimously decided
not to grant the postponement,
but to instead proceed "under the
assumption that no one who has
been charged with drunken
driving has (previously) been
charged with violating the Funda
mental Standard."
Anderson, who also faces crim
inal prosecution for the same inci
dent, refrained from answering
questions during the hearing since
any statements he made could
later be used against him in the
criminal proceedings, but he did
read from a prepared text.
In his prepared statement An
derson commented on the
awkwardness of his situation. He
noted that to the extent that he
exercises his Constitutional right
to remain silent in the court case,
he is constrained in his ability to
defend himself personally in SJC
hearings.
The criminal case involves the
charge of failing to report
damaged property in addition to
driving while intoxicated. A wit
ness allegedly saw Anderson back

over several bicycles when he left
Florence Moore Hall.
Anderson and all of the pas
sengers in the car, however, claim
they did not know they had
backed into the bicycles. Cole is
not citing failure to report
damaged property as a basis for
the alleged Fundamental Stan
dard violation.
"I will even grant that
(Anderson did not know about
the bicycles)," Cole said at the
hearing.
In response to the claim that,
by prosecuting Anderson for a
Fundamental Standard violation,
the University is attempting to
implement back door changes in
its disciplinary policy, Cole
replied, "I don't think it is a sub
stantial [change]."
However Cole could not cite
any Fundamental Standard cases
involving alcohol abuse which did
not center on the charge of physi
cal assault.
"Even if it were [a substantial
change]," Cole added, "there is
no obligation that we give any
notice that we are going to do
something different.
"No one in my office to date
has viewed charging Mr. Ander
son with a Fundamental Standard
violation as a gross departure
from prior Fundamental Standard
investigations."
Cole concluded, "I think
there's been a lot of confusion
about the distinctions between
the University process and the
process that goes on in the courts
where a student's misconduct is
also a violation of the law.
"The University disciplinary
process exists to respond to stu
dent misconduct with respect to
our expectations tor how people
ought to behave."
The Stanford Judicial Council
Wednesday night voted to
proceed with a decision in the
case of a sophomore who could
face expulsion for allegedly
driving under the influence of al
cohol.
Joseph Anderson has been
charged with violating the Uni
versity's Fundamental Standard
for allegedly driving under the in
fluence of alcohol from Florence
Moore Hall to Delta Upsilon
house April 17. He faces possible
expulsion from the University if
found guilty.
The Anderson case marks the
first time that Fundamental Stan
dard charges have been filed
against a Stanford student for
driving under the influence of al
cohol.
Anderson requested a con
tinuance at the meeting, but
Wednesday's SJC vote makes a
ruling on that charge likely within
a week. The SJCs decision would
then take effect upon approval
from the President's Office,
which rarely overturns SJC
recommendations.
Anderson's attorney, Thomas
Crary, claimed that while there
have been many instances of
Stanford students being arrested
for driving while intoxicated on
campus, his client is the first ever
to be charged with academic vio
lations.
"Mr. Anderson is unfairly
being singled out as no other
[student] has been in the past for
disciplinary procedures," Crary
said.
Anderson's attorney has re
quested from the Stanford Police
Department "data relating to the
nature and number of other inci
dents where people were arrested

for drunk driving in the last five
years" in order to substantiate his
claim that the University has al
ways deferred to the courts in
cases involving drunken driving.
A council member also cited a
1981 case in which two students
were killed and a third injured in
an automobile accident on
campus. The driver was later con
victed of felony drunken driving
and manslaughter, but no Funda
mental Standard charges were
brought against him by the Uni
versity.
Anderson's attorney argued
that it is hypocritical of the Uni
versity to "look the other way at
other violations of state laws
which proscribe the use of or fur
nishing of alcohol to minors" and
then threaten to discipline his
client for qualitatively similar
conduct.
"I believe these (Stanford
Police Department) records will
show that no Stanford students
have ever been arrested in fact for
consuming alcoholic beverages
because they weren't of age by
the Stanford Police Department,"
Crary continued.
Crary then claimed the Stan
ford police axe obstructing his
ability to see these records, saying
that Police Chief Marvin Her
rington "is being uncooperative."
Crary moved to postpone the
Anderson case until Herrington
has provided the records in ques
tion and argued that his client
could not be held responsible for
the delays caused by Herrington.
"I requested these records not
yesterday or the day before in an
attempt to delay," Crary said, "I
requested the records back in
June and fully expected to have
the information by now."
Sally Cole, the University's
judicial affairs officer who pre
sented the University's case,
argued against granting the
postponement.
"I find it grandly irrelevant,"
