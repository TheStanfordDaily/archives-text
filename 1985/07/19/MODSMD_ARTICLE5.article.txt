Stanford student David
Romo, found guilty last month
of trespassing and refusing to
disperse at a May 28 Bursar's
Office sit-in, said yesterday
that he will appeal his case.
"I'm going to try to file the
notice (for appeal) tomorrow
or Monday," Romo told The
Daily last night.
Romo and six other Stanford
students were put on three
month probation for the con
viction in a Palo Alto court
July 1. Judge Franklin Elia
provided that the records of
those students would be
cleared after the three months
if they broke no laws in the
meantime. The two other stu
dents found guilty elected not
to go on probation, but to peti
tion to have their records
cleared in one year.
Romo, who represented
himself at the trial last month,
said he will again represent
himself in the appeal. Romo

said he is appealing for three
reasons.
"First of all, I am going to
charge there was not sufficient
evidence because (University
President Donald) Kennedy
did not appear at the trial,"
Romo said. "Therefore, it was
not possible for the element of
agency to be proved."
Romo subpoenaed Kennedy
for the first trial, but the court
refused his request.
"The second basis (for my
appeal) is in the final instruc
tions to the jury, the judge
added a phrase to the First
Amendment," Romo contin
ued. "1 objected and the judge
brushed it aside.
"The third thing is that the
district attorney systematically
excluded all minorities from
the jury/' said Romo, who
identified himself as Hispanic.
"Why is it that a non-minority
is more objective than a
minority?"
