## Special unit tackles nuclear terrorism 
### 
LAS VEGAS, Nev. — Growing ter
rorism and the specter of an American city
held hostage by a nuclear threat are
prompting new concerns for the Nuclear
Emergency Search Team — dubbed the
nation's nuclear fire department.
Comprised of scientists, physicists and
engineers who design, build and test
America's nuclear weapons, NEST is con
sidered the nation's best shot at thwarting
the ultimate terrorist threat. Team leaders
believe the unthinkable — an American
city held hostage in a nuclear nightmare —
is just a matter of time.
"I'm very much afraid that will be the
case someday," Thomas Clark, manager of
the Department of Energy's Nevada
Operations Office, said in an interview
Wednesday. "I guess if we didn't think it
would happen, we wouldn't be so aggres
sive in our training."
Clark's office runs the nation's nuclear
testing program and manages the Las
Vegas-based NEST organization.
NEST was formed in 1974 when federal
officials, responding to a nuclear threat

against the city of Boston, botched the ef
fort. Luggage and badly-needed equip
ment ended up in one city, personnel in an
other.
Fortunately the Boston scare was a hoax.
But the bungling prompted President Ford
to order the Atomic Energy Commission
to devise a plan that could cope with future
emergencies.
The finest minds in the nuclear weapons
industry were culled from the federal
agency and the laboratories where those
weapons are designed. Their mission: to
evaluate any nuclear threat, search for a
device, disarm it, and — if all else fails —
assist in clean-up operations.
NEST has responded to more than 70
threats in the past decade. In only one inci
dent did the person involved have the abil
ity to carry out a threat. That case involved
the theft of uranium from a plant in Wil
mington, N.C., by a plant employee. The
material was recovered without incident.
Federal officials are thankful they have
not had to face the ultimate threat. But
they admit time could be running out.

"We realize all of this could change with
one incident," said Lane Bonner, an FBI
spokesman in Washington. "So we have to
maintain the vigil; we have to be able to
detect incidents before they occur. That is
the object of our terrorism program. There
is certainly increased concern because of
recent incidents."
A valid nuclear threat could come from
an individual, a group or a country, Clark
says.
By federal law any nuclear threat is for
warded to the FBI. If the threat appears
valid, recordings or copies of the message
are sent to NEST's threat assessment
group in Germantown, Md., the Emer
gency Action and Coordination Team
(EACT). The threat is evaluated to deter
mine if the person knows what he's talking
about.
If EACT decides the threat is real, a
NEST team is deployed from a hangar
across from McCarran International Air
port in Las Vegas. The call-up could be a
simple one — a handful of scientists to help
track down stolen uranium at Wilmington.

Or a 1975 incident when 40 men searched
for a nuclear device in an extortion threat
against Union Oil Co. in Los Angeles. No
device was found.
Or all of NESTs several hundred mem
bers could be called out, as was the case in
1978 when they searched across Canada
for pieces of a fallen Russian satellite in
Operation Morning Light.
NEST members have also been used to
monitor radiation during the Three Mile
Island crisis, advise authorities at the
bombing of Harvey's Resort in Stateline,
Nev., and conduct aerial searches across
Texas for cobalt-tainted Mexican steel.
Disarming a real device is one of NESTs
most disconcerting challenges.
"All of us are concerned we may have to
do it for real someday," Clark says. "If it's
an accident involving an American nuclear
weapon, we know a lot about that weapon.
But if we're looking for a terrorist nuclear
device, we know very little about it. It isn't
just finding the thing, it's figuring out what
it is.
