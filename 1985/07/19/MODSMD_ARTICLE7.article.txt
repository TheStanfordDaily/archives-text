Blacks hit apartheid with economics
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Police fired birdshot,
rubber bullets and tear gas to break up crowds of blacks stoning
patrol cars and houses in $oweto township yesterday, killing one
black man, authorities said.
Numerous clashes were reported in other black townships as
anti-apartheid violence flared anew after a few hours of relative
calm. Blacks turned to strikes and consumer boycotts in a new
show of economic.muscle aimed at white-run businesses.
In Katlehong east of Johannesburg, police arrested 122 blacks
who refused to disperse during an illegal outdoor gathering, a
police spokesman said.
Five labor disputes and consumer boycotts broke out or were
threatened around the country, including a potential miners'
strike in the gold mines, which employ more than 500,000
blacks.
After several days of bloody clashes in black townships, police
reported one more fatality as the violence ebbed. A black woman
was slain with an ax and her body was burned, apparently be
cause she broke a black consumer boycott of white-owned stores
in a small Cape Province town.
Many South African analysts believe that economic clout is the
most potent weapon for South Africa's black majority and that
strikes and consumer boycotts are likely to increase.
• In Pietermaritzburg, the Natal Province capital of 191,000
people, thousands of black workers stayed home for the day to
protest the firing of 950 black workers in nearby Howick by the
South African subsidiary of the British firm, BTR Ltd,
• In the eastern Cape Province, shopkeepers in Port Elizabeth
and Uitenhage said a black consumer boycott that began this
week was biting sharply into business, and some shops might be
forced to close down.
Black activists called a two-month boycott of white shops to
force whites to support black demands for the release of jailed
anti-apartheid leaders as well as other grievances. The two cities
have been among the hardest hit in 10 months of rioting that has
left more than 450 blacks dead.
• In Johannesburg, leaders of the black National Union of
Mineworkers said they were preparing for a possible strike of the
gold mines, which produce half of South Africa's export earnings.
U. S.: Managua supports terrorists
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — The United States has accused
Nicaragua of supporting terrorist attacks planned against U.S.
personnel in neighboring Honduras and has said it will hold
Nicaragua responsible if any are carried out, officials said yester
day.
Nicaragua's Foreign Ministry made public the text of a note
from U.S. Ambassador Harry Bergold listing the charges. The
ministry said they were "absurd" and were "proof of the state
political terrorism" of the United States.
The United States opposes the leftist Sandinista regime in
Nicaragua and supports the Contra rebels fighting to topple it. -
U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Susan Clyde confirmed that Ber
gold delivered a diplomatic note Wednesday to Saul Arana, chief
of the U.S. desk at the Foreign Ministry.
Clyde said she did not read the note made public by the
Foreign Ministry, but, "I do not have any reason to believe it is
not accurate."
"We consider it of great importance that the government of
Nicaragua understand clearly and completely that any terrorist
attack against personnel of the United States in Honduras, sup
ported by Nicaragua, would be considered the direct responsibil
ity of the government of Nicaragua and that it could count on an
appropriate reaction from the United States," the note released
by the Foreign Ministry said.
Meanwhile, the Sandinista newspaper Barricada quoted Hugo
Torres, Nicaragua's deputy defense minister, as saying 30 U.S.
Navy ships were in the Pacific Ocean near the Nicaraguan coast.
Treaty may bar Sakharov release
WASHINGTON — Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) says a top Rus
sian science official offered him an unusual explanation for why
his government will not release Soviet dissident Andrei Sak
harov: It would violate an international nuclear arms treaty.
Anatoly Aleksandrov, president of the Soviet Academy of
Sciences, made the statement during Simon's visit to the Soviet
Union last week, the senator said Wednesday.
Sakharov, a physicist who helped develop his country's atomic
bomb, has been living in internal exile in the Soviet city of Gorky
since 1980. He incurred the punishment because of his stands
against nuclear weapons and for human rights. .Sakharov
received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975.
Simon said that during his Soviet visit, he brought up the sub
ject of human rights with Aleksandrov. He said although he did
not mention Sakharov by name, Aleksandrov interjected it into
the conversation.
"He said. 'Well, of course we can't release Sakharov,'". Simon
reported.
The senator said that when he asked why not, Aleksandrov
replied, "It would be a violation of the (nuclear) non
proliferation treaty."
That treaty, signed by the United States and the Soviet Union
and dozens of other nations in the late 19605, is aimed at halting
the spread of nuclear weapons.
Simon said when he told the science academy chief that he
didn't understand how the agreement applied to Sakharov, Alek
sandrov answered, "Well, the non-proliferation treaty prevents
you from spreading information about nuclear secrets. So we
can't let him leave the country.''

U. S.: Managua supports terrorists
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — The United States has accused
Nicaragua of supporting terrorist attacks planned against U.S.
personnel in neighboring Honduras and has said it will hold
Nicaragua responsible if any are carried out, officials said yester
day.
Nicaragua's Foreign Ministry made public the text of a note
from U.S. Ambassador Harry Bergold listing the charges. The
ministry said they were "absurd" and were "proof of the state
political terrorism" of the United States.
The United States opposes the leftist Sandinista regime in
Nicaragua and supports the Contra rebels fighting to topple it. -
U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Susan Clyde confirmed that Ber
gold delivered a diplomatic note Wednesday to Saul Arana, chief
of the U.S. desk at the Foreign Ministry.
Clyde said she did not read the note made public by the
Foreign Ministry, but, "I do not have any reason to believe it is
not accurate."
"We consider it of great importance that the government of
Nicaragua understand clearly and completely that any terrorist
attack against personnel of the United States in Honduras, sup
ported by Nicaragua, would be considered the direct responsibil
ity of the government of Nicaragua and that it could count on an
appropriate reaction from the United States," the note released
by the Foreign Ministry said.
Meanwhile, the Sandinista newspaper Barricada quoted Hugo
Torres, Nicaragua's deputy defense minister, as saying 30 U.S.
Navy ships were in the Pacific Ocean near the Nicaraguan coast.
Treaty may bar Sakharov release
WASHINGTON — Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) says a top Rus
sian science official offered him an unusual explanation for why
his government will not release Soviet dissident Andrei Sak
harov: It would violate an international nuclear arms treaty.
Anatoly Aleksandrov, president of the Soviet Academy of
Sciences, made the statement during Simon's visit to the Soviet
Union last week, the senator said Wednesday.
Sakharov, a physicist who helped develop his country's atomic
bomb, has been living in internal exile in the Soviet city of Gorky
since 1980. He incurred the punishment because of his stands
against nuclear weapons and for human rights. .Sakharov
received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975.
Simon said that during his Soviet visit, he brought up the sub
ject of human rights with Aleksandrov. He said although he did
not mention Sakharov by name, Aleksandrov interjected it into
the conversation.
"He said. 'Well, of course we can't release Sakharov,'". Simon
reported.
The senator said that when he asked why not, Aleksandrov
replied, "It would be a violation of the (nuclear) non
proliferation treaty."
That treaty, signed by the United States and the Soviet Union
and dozens of other nations in the late 19605, is aimed at halting
the spread of nuclear weapons.
Simon said when he told the science academy chief that he
didn't understand how the agreement applied to Sakharov, Alek
sandrov answered, "Well, the non-proliferation treaty prevents
you from spreading information about nuclear secrets. So we
can't let him leave the country.''
