7 counties are disaster areas
SAN DIEGO — Santa Clara and San Diego
were among seven counties in California declared
federal disaster areas yesterday, a Republican
congressman said.
U.S. Rep. Bill Lowery (R-San Diego) said he
received a call from the White House yesterday
afternoon telling him that the requested disaster
status had been approved by President Reagan.
The declaration means residents whose homes
and businesses were damaged or destroyed in
recent brush fires may qualify for direct federal
aid and low-interest federal loans.
The other counties receiving the designation
were Los Angeles, Santa Cruz, San Luis Obispo,
Ventura and Monterey.
A spokeswoman for Lowery's office said
private assistance in the form of federal money is
released only in the cases where private insurance
money is exhausted or someone was under
insured.
Other forms of assistance are housing, tempo
rary shelter, unemployment money and Small
Business Administration disaster assistance.
A Federal Emergency Management Adminis
tration office will open in San Francisco within
seven days, and field teams from that office will
move to the fire-damaged sites as necessary.
Overdraft fees too high?
SAN FRANCISCO — In a victory for bank
customers, the state Supreme Court ruled yester
day that fees charged for overdrawn checking ac

counts may be illegal if they are excessive in com
parison to the bank's costs.
The court did not say what would constitute an
excessive charge, but ordered a hearing into
whether it was "unconscionable" for Crocker
National Bank to charge $6 for an overdrawn
check that allegedly cost the bank less than $1 to
process.
While a fee far exceeding costs is not necessar
ily illegal, a bank's contract with its customers
authorizing charges for bad checks is a "totally
one-sided transaction" that may make the fees
vulnerable to a consumer lawsuit, said the
opinion by Justice Allen Broussard.
"The bank has all the rights and the depositor
all the duties," Broussard said. He noted, for ex
ample, that the contract was in fine print on a
signature card, customers were given no copies of
bank regulations and the bank reserved the right
to change its fees.
"The absence of equality of bargaining power,
open negotiation, full disclosure and a contract
which fairly sets out the rights and duties of each
party demonstrates that the transaction lacks
those checks and balances which would inhibit
the charging of unconscionable fees," Broussard
said.
The suit, which had been dismissed by lower
courts, was filed by Paul Perdue of San Francisco
over a $6 fee he was charged by Crocker for an
overdrawn check in 1978. Perdue sought to rep
resent all customers subject to the fees, which are
charged by most banks.
