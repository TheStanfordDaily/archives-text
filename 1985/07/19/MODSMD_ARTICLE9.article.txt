## The
						Stanford Daily Use of moral code can be arbitrary 
### 
The Stanford Judicial Council is considering expelling
sophomore Joseph Anderson for violation of the
Fundamental Standard University regulation which
requires students to "show both within and without the
University such respect for order, morality, personal honor
and the rights of others as demanded of good citizens." An
derson faces this disciplinary action after being charged by
the Stanford Police with driving while intoxicated on
campus last spring.
Driving under the influence of alcohol is a serious of
fense, and if Anderson is found guilty in a California court
of law, he should and will be punished. The Fundamental
Standard seems applicable as well; although the code is
vague and subject to the University's interpretation, drunk
driving certainly infringes upon "the rights of others."
In this instance, though, applying the Fundamental Stan
dard represents arbitrary and unjust enforcement of this
regulation.
Countless numbers of Stanford students have been cited
for drunk driving in the past. Why, after years of these inci
dents, is the University suddenly choosing one student,
seemingly at random, upon whom to apply the Fundamen
tal Standard?
If the University has decided to "get tough" with drunk
drivers, that is a decision to be lauded. But there seems to
have been no decision, merely sudden enforcement. A
Stanford student has never been disciplined for this of
fense. If the University decides the time has come, after
60-odd years of student driving, to "crack down," then
the University should say so, publicly and loudly.
Prosecuting Anderson is unfair, in addition, because of
the hazy guidelines underlying the Fundamental Standard.
What does "within and without the University" mean?
Does a Japanese Stanford student arrested for drunk
driving in Tokyo violate the Fundamental Standard?
The University is treating both Anderson and the Funda
mental Standard (and therefore all Stanford students) in an
arbitrary and unfair manner. Let the University define its
intentions before it carries them out. â€¢
