Lamentations until 10:00 p.m. in the Old Union Clubhouse. Tisha b Av
commemorates the destruction of the first and second Temples (586 B.C.E.
and 70 C.E.), and the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492. When the
9th of Av falls on Shabbat (as this year) it is observed on the 10th. This is
because we are not allowed to fast on Shabbat except on Yom Kippur.
