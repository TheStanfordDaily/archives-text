112 IF YOU LIKE STANFORD UNIVERSITY
YOU'LL LOVE THE STANFORD FLYING CLUB
Nothing more logical than that. You come to Stanford for the concentrated,
innovative education that gives you a lead on life.
At Stanford Flying Club we offer the same kind of high-quality education that will
continue to give you the edge long after you have left the University. We can help you
learn to fly, everything from your first Solo, through all the advanced licenses including
instrument, Commerical, and the Airline Transport license. We can help you learn to
fly, for the sheer fun of it, and for the freedom of being able to travel fast and affordably
at the controls of an airplane.
Because the new training program at the Stanford Flying Club carefully integrates
the latest educational techniques and flight technologies. In flight and on the ground
you work one on one with an experienced instructor-pilot. Most students obtain their
Solo License in only 9to 18 hours of flight time. And because the Stanford Flying Club
is a non-profit organization, the rates are low. Many pilots have Learned to Fly for less
than $572. •>%
So join the Stanford Flying Club. t
Learn to fly. You'll love it.
To schedule a lesson or just to chat,
call Leslie today at 851 -2400 (1:00 to 1 %
5:30) and decide for yourself.
