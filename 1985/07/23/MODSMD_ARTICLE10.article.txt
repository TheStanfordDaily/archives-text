## The
						Stanford Daily No logical reason for baseball strike 
### 
Major league baseball players have set Aug. 6 as their
deadline for a strike unless an agreement is reached with
the owners. Should the issue not be settled by then, the
pennant races and postseason play for this season would be
in jeopardy.
Why?
Well, the players have traditionally gotten one-third of
baseball's network television contract money for their pen
sion fund. The new contract is for $1.1 billion. And now
the owners, having received their largest network deal in
history, don't want to give the players that much.
Their excuse? They're losing money. In fact, they project
that by 1988, they will lose $86 million combined, so they
need more than two-thirds of the TV money.
The owners are also concerned that the average player
salary is $329,000. That's without much doubt a lot of
money to pay an average player, so the owners also are
proposing a salary cap.
This idea lends new meaning to the word absurdity. If
the owners think that players' salaries are too high, perhaps
they shouldn't sign them to contracts for ridiculous
amounts. If their losses are so hard to take, why don't they
lower their contract offers?
It's hard to empathize with a player sitting on the bench,
earning close to a half-million dollars a year and worrying
about his pension fund. But it's also hard to feel sympathy
for an owner paying mediocre players outrageous salaries
and then asking those players to approve a cap on their
salaries because he can't control himself.
Let's face it: There's no good reason for the two sides not
to reach an agreement.
And another point: The loser in any strike will be the
fans. In August, the pennant races are just beginning to
heat up, and the playoffs and World Series loom ahead.
A strike by the fans? If the players and owners don't cut
through the rhetoric and reach an agreement, it might be
an idea whose time has come. After all, Municipal Stadium,
home of the San Jose Bees of the Class A California
League, is closer to Stanford than Candlestick Park or the
Oakland Coliseum. The tickets are cheaper. The players
are making far less than $329,000. And they'll be playing
in August.
