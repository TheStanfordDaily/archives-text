Note: Any resemblance between the houses men
tioned hereafter and any actual fraternity, living or
dead (say Sigma Xi or some house like that) is purely
coincidental.
Once upon a time, there was a mythical Southern
California college called the California Institute for
Technologists. This was a small campus with no
more than 800 undergrads and 1,000 graduate stu
dents, all tucked away in a smoggy corner (like
every corner) of li'l oF Pasadena.
Now it so happened that during the construction
of the Institute, the powers-that-be built a
set of undergraduate student residences — four
halls in all, each called a "house" with the name of
the appropriate sponsor appended thereon: Rick
etts, Dabney, Blacker and Fleming.
Each of these houses could accomodate 60 to 100
students, with the notion that every undergraduate
would be a member of one of the houses and thus
have a built-in support group. But, as the four
houses were linked into one complex, it was hoped
that there would be plenty of inter-house interac
tions such as intramural sports, parties and
friendship.
However, as the years progressed, the members
of Fleming house began to look upon their house as
more than just a residence, more than just a quarter
of the students trying to graduate from the Institute.
This collection of people in the house, they
reasoned, could not have been due to pure coinci
dence; they had a purpose, and in that purpose they
had unity.
Part of the reason this megalomanic attitude
developed was due to the rotation system of assign
ing freshmen to the houses. Each freshman would
visit each of the houses on different nights of the
first school week to experience some of the atmos
phere of the house. On the final night, she would
submit a list to the master of student houses that
contained her house preferences.
The following night, the Great Frosh Draw (or
the Great Frosh Meat Market) would take place,
with each of the house's presidents picking into the
house freshmen whom the current house members
desired.
The trouble was that Fleming kept choosing the
loudest, most opinionated and most extreme of the
freshmen, so the house as a whole became more and
more convinced of its own righteousness. This atti
tude stank in the nostrils of the other, more
moderate houses, and soon they began to break ties
with Fleming. These actions further heightened the
"Us vs. TheirT mentality already prevalent within
Fleming, and as time passed, Fleming became a resi
dential pariah.

Not that they minded — in fact, the members of
Fleming (affectionately known as "Phlegms")
reveled in their position. They acquired a cannon
for their house symbol, menacingly pointing (and
being fired, albeit with blanks) at the other houses.
Even as the Institute grew and three more student
houses were added, Fleming still remained an out
cast.
Fleming continued on its course of splendid isola
tion. Pranks committed by the other six houses
against Fleming are uncountable. The Fleming flag,
which covers a wall of their dining room and is
guarded by a sophisticated alarm, is the target of
numerous theives. The Fleming cannon (when

cigars are sometimes more than just a cigar, as
Freud would say) periodically receives a well
deserved, if a bit pinkish, paint job.
And Fleming has repaid in kind. The members of
the house set up the "Fleming Country Club"in
front of one of the main entrances to the old com
plex, preventing other houses' members access to
their own houses. Phlegms wear the house shirts (a
bright red, with a white "F' on the breast and a
white "FLEMING" across the back) to lectures and
make a show of it by sitting in the same row. When
members of another house wore a parody of the
shirt ("FAGGOT' in place of "FLEMING") and
posed in front of the country club sign, they were
kidnapped by Flems and lay bound and gagged for
four hours.
The Master of Student Houses and the other
houses took a dim view of these incidents and vi
ciously slapped Fleming's collective wrist. Of
course, justice prevails and vengence is meted out
by a just god; once they leave the Institute, Flems
become . . . scientists, engineers and CEO's of
major corporations earning lucrative salaries by
employing the same tactics they learned at the In
stitute, and they lived happily ever after.
The moral of the story is . . . damn, I've forgotten
it. It probably wasn't that important.
