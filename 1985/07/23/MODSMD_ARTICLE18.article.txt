## 'Cocoon' predictable but delightful 
### CHRIS SCHROEDER 
In today's media blitz of youth,
beauty and yuppie ideals, it is not
surprising that a movie like
"Cocoon" has been released to
embellish our summer evenings.
The discovery of a virtual foun
tain of youth in the mansion next
door by a trio of geriatric-home
wards leads the way to some mad
cap close encounters with several
extraterrestrials and rediscovered
vitality.
This latest work by director
Ron Howard bears many
similarities to several other recent
movies, including his own most
recent work, "Splash." In one
scene between a male earthling
and a female alien when her chest
begins to glow warmly to show
her affection for him, the
memories start to flow. The cut
and-dried humor of Wilford
Brimly bears a striking
resemblance to Henry Fonda in
"On Golden Pond.'" When asked
by his daughter to choose be
tween two menu options for din
ner, he immediately eliminates one
because "it makes me fart." And

in the end, the aliens arrive to
reclaim their own in a scene so
similar to "Close Encounters of
the Third Kind" that only the
spaceships have been changed to
protect Steven Spielberg.
Through the use of underwater
photography, Howard shows that
he has learned some lessons since
his experience with the mermaid
of his previous work. His use of
lighting and camera position truly
develops a surreal atmosphere
for the scenes. Another lesson he
seems to have learned is that
people like dolphins, since in no
aquatic scene are they absent.
Does he agree with Douglas
Adams that they are the only
ones on this planet with the
capacity to contact intelligent life
from outer space?
The movie is riddled with both
surprisingly fresh and boringly
predictable scenarios. At one
point the hired boat captain,
played by Steve Guttenberg,
peeps in on an unsuspecting alien,
Raquel Welch's stunning
daughter, Tahnee. She slinks out
of not only her clothing but also

her skin to reveal the marvels
which can be purchased from
George Lucas.
Elsewhere, after a goodly dose
of youth and vigor, one of the
unlikely heroes of the story, Don
Ameche, ends up doing an almost
believable break-dancing routine
on the floor of a crowded discot
heque full of polyester-clad teens
and twenties.
Later Joe (Hume Cronyn),
after a night of bowling with the
gang, decides to split off and go
catting around with a Wallgreen's
diner waitress, then is surprised to
find his wife leaving when he gets
home.
The pace of the film is like one
of its elderly heroes after a
prescribed dosage of Ex-Lax. The
plot moves steadily onward at a
gentle, melancholy rhythm. The
only action which affords any
excitement is a cliched attempt by
young David, played by Barret
Oliver, to catch his grandparents'
boat as they pull away from the
dock for a rendezvous with the
end of the movie. By this time,
though, the laxative seems to

have lost its potency. The pace
gets frightfully slow as Industrial
Light and Magic takes over to let
our heroes escape in a long, con
stipated special effect which has
been done so many times that one
wonders if it was on a special
clearance sale.
The cute antics of these

geriatric teenagers as they learn
to cope with rejuvenated sex
drives and how to fill the hours
which used to require sleep are a
breath of fresh air. But the lesson
they teach about life and death is
a little harder to inhale. As in
"Splash," the end of the film in
volves an option of assured
happiness at the cost of leaving
society forever.
Yet, this time not a single char
acter stops to weigh the choices as
they dive headlong into the un
known like so many octogenarian
lemmings. Only Bernie (Jack Gil
lford), who seems to have the best
reason to leave after the death of
his wife, decides to stay. His only
rationale for this choice is that he
can't think of what he would do
for another lifetime. Here, where
some philosophical enlighten
ment could have been offered to
the viewer, we are left with only a
predictable turn in the plot.
Overall, "Cocoon" gives one
the general euphoria of an even
ing spent reminiscing. These
lovable senior citizens are the
kind each viewer wants to adopt
as his own grandparents. If one
can ignore a few cliches and a few
unmotivated plot twists, this is
definitely a delightful way to
escape a hot summer evening in
front of the tube.


Steve (luttenberg plays a young boat captain who falls in love with an attractive extraterrestrial played by Tahnee Welch.


The stellar acting ensemble of "Cocoon" includes Wilford Brimley and
Maureen Stapleton as Ben and Mary.
