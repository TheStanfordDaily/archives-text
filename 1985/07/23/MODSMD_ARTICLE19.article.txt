## Carlin shines at the Circle Star 
### RICK DIETZ 
There are few comedians
working today who have such a
wide variety of material and
such a diverse collection of fans as
does George Carlin.
The wiry performer packed the
Circle Star Theatre Saturday
night with people of all ages,
races and personalities, including
"Weird Al" Yankovic, who sat
directly behind us. Carlin enter
tained us with a monologue rang
ing from ways to say hello and
goodbye all the way to his "those
words you can't say" skit.
But first things first. The
opening act for Carlin was a fel
low named Glen Super, who was
anything but. Super, known as
"Mr. Bullhorn" because of his
repetitious and often obnoxious
use of a megaphone, went on
stage right on time, but had most
of the audience wishing he would
have stayed in his dressing room
writing funny material. His col
lection of insults and bad songs
gave many an opportunity to
leave and buy popcorn.
Super did, however, manage to

insult a number of races and
religions, as well as the intelli
gence of those watching his 45-
minute routine. Some headline
entertainers work with a good
opening act that will get an audi
ence aroused. Carlin has obvi
ously hired an act which makes
him look better than he already
is.
After a 20-minute intermis
sion, the light dimmed, people
returned to their seats and an un
announced Carlin took the stage,
much to the delight of the eager
house.

Dressed in his usual dark, drab
clothing, it was soon evident that
Carlin was born to play the Circle
Star. The stage, which is entirely
surrounded by the crowd, was the
perfect complement to Carlin's
wandering style. His physical ap
peal benefited from having a por
tion of his audience constantly see
his outrageous facial expressions.
Carlin used the set to its full ad
vantage and gave each section of
the theater an equal amount of
play.
What Carlin did best, however,
was take everyday occurrences

that bother you and me and trans
form them into very funny
scenarios. Carlin explained to his
captive listeners how much he
loves to keep people alert. For
example, he suggested walking
into a gun shop, purchasing a rifle
and some ammunition, and then
asking the salesman for a ski
mask. "That will keep a person
on his toes," he exclaimed.
Carlin's sense of humor of
ten-times bordered on the simple
premise of just asking "Why?"
He wondered why early men,
when naming the world's
creatures, called one a "fly" but
neglected to name one a "walk."
"Seems like the first one they
would have named," Carlin pon
dered, motioning toward the
floor.
Carlin's success stemmed from
his ability to relate his humor to
those listening to him. When he
spoke about losing an item, all he
wanted to know is "where the hell
it is!" Carlin is a master at build
ing a small idea into a large and
very funny thought.
However, Carlin wasn't with
out fault. There were a few times

when he apologized for stumbling
and, on occasion, forgetting a line
of his material. There were also
instances during his show when it
seemed we may have been listen
ing to his parrot. You know, the
one which sits on his shoulder
while he's rehearsing and learns
to repeat every word exactly like
its owner. These moments,
though, had no effect on his audi
ence's applause.
It is clear that Carlin's concep
tion of reality lends to his
remarkable allure. He is a man
extremely confident in what he
says and does. His comedy con
tains such an air of truthfulness
that one wonders if Carlin might
know something the rest of us
don't.
When commenting on New
Hampshire's licence plate motto,
"Live Free or Die," and on
Idaho's motto, "Famous
Potatoes," Carlin emphasized the
broad scope of the two and asked
which is closer to America's
reality. His answer: "probably
'Famous Potatoes.' "
But then, that's George Carlin.


When people tell
him to 'have a
good one,' Car
lin's response is, 'I
already have a
good one.'
