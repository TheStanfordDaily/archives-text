### MARSH McCALL Editorial staff 
A spokesman for Bill Graham
Presents charged that the ASSU
Concert Network was responsible
for the cancellation of two Grate
ful Dead performances scheduled
for this week.
In his first Daily interview since
the cancellation of the concerts,
Bill Graham Presents promoter
Bob Barsotti said that plans for
the shows were halted because of
"lies" told by the Concert Net
work.
Barsotti said that earlier this
month Concert Network Director
Patrick McCrystle had assured
him that the University had ap
proved of plans to present the
Grateful Dead at Frost Ampit
heatre July 27 and 28.
"He told me yes," Barsotti

said, "and then he changed his
story."
The Concert Network has
maintained that a misunderstand
ing led to the printing of tickets
for the shows and caused Bill
Graham Presents to announce the
concerts on the Grateful Dead
hotline.
"Barsotti's trying to save his
butt," McCrystle said in response
to Barsotti's statements. "He's
not telling the truth. In my view
he's acted in a very irrational and
immature manner."
Barsotti claimed that during a
phone conversation McCrystle
agreed to go forward with the
shows. "I asked him 'Are you
sure you got everyone's ap
proval?' and he said 'Yeah.' Then
I asked 'So I can call the band?'
