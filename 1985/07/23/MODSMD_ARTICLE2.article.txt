# Dead concerts anger planner
## News 
### MARSH McCALL Editorial staff 
A spokesman for Bill Graham
Presents charged that the ASSU
Concert Network was responsible
for the cancellation of two Grate
ful Dead performances scheduled
for this week.
In his first Daily interview since
the cancellation of the concerts,
Bill Graham Presents promoter
Bob Barsotti said that plans for
the shows were halted because of
"lies" told by the Concert Net
work.
Barsotti said that earlier this
month Concert Network Director
Patrick McCrystle had assured
him that the University had ap
proved of plans to present the
Grateful Dead at Frost Ampit
heatre July 27 and 28.
"He told me yes," Barsotti

said, "and then he changed his
story."
The Concert Network has
maintained that a misunderstand
ing led to the printing of tickets
for the shows and caused Bill
Graham Presents to announce the
concerts on the Grateful Dead
hotline.
"Barsotti's trying to save his
butt," McCrystle said in response
to Barsotti's statements. "He's
not telling the truth. In my view
he's acted in a very irrational and
immature manner."
Barsotti claimed that during a
phone conversation McCrystle
agreed to go forward with the
shows. "I asked him 'Are you
sure you got everyone's ap
proval?' and he said 'Yeah.' Then
I asked 'So I can call the band?'
and he said 'Yeah.' "
Barsotti said he is unenthusias
tic about working with the Con
cert Network in the future be
cause "McCrystle lied" and the
Concert Network "chose to
believe him." He said the Concert

Network reimbursed Bill Graham
Presents for half the cost of print
ing the tickets for the two shows.
"They must have felt partly re
sponsible," he said.
"I couldn't imagine working
with the Concert Network right
now," Barsotti added, "And I'm
never working with McCrystle
again."

Concert Network Adviser
Suzanne Becker acknowledged
that she had authorized partial
reimbursement for the ticket
printing costs as a "goodwill
gesture," but denied the Concert
Network was at fault.
"We share the responsibility
for the mix-up," she said, "but
we're not saying Patrick lied/'
Becker added that the Concert

Network "didn't initially feel" a
reimbursement was appropriate.
Barsotti was unsure about
future plans to present the Grate
ful Dead at Stanford, ack
nowledging that although the
Concert Network had done an
"excellent" job presenting the
Grateful Dead shows last April,
new personnel had taken over
since then.

"I don't work with liars," he
said.
Becker was more optimistic
about future Dead concerts at
Stanford. "If the Grateful Dead
wants to do a show at Frost, Bill
Graham will present it," she said.
Becker added that by next spring,
the traditional time for Dead con
certs at Stanford, "Barsotti's
feelings will have diminished."
