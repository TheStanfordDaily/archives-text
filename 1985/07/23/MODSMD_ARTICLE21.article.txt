# Too much dreaming in 'Midsummer Night'
## 
### ELAINE WANG 
Here, in the midst of summer,
is a solid production of Shake
speare by the Valley Institute of
Theatre Arts. The Paul Masson
summer series continues with the
institute's "Midsummer Night's
Dream" through Aug. 9.
Barring the somewhat tedious
musical opening where dreams of
all different forms and definitions
are rendered, the show is lively
and well-wrought. The plot and
action follow the script closely,
and the players seem to be more
relaxed in this production (as
opposed to "Two Gentlemen of
Verona;' now playing in reper
tory with "Midsummer Night's
Dream").
The primary ensemble of this
production — Hermia (Joan
Langley), Demetrius (Anthony
Abate), Lysander (Bill Peck) and
Helena (Robin Nordli) — is par
ticularly enjoyable. Nordli,
playing the scorned and forward
Helena, hits her dynamic stride
right off; she is alternately

petulant, insistent, indignant and
sweet, and she taps the potential
of all her lines.
Her friends/suitors are no less
spirited, and the mix-up between
the lovers is hilarious. Abate, who
plays a roguish Demetrius deter
mined to capture Hermia's heart
(via her father's threats) and fend
off the assertive Helena, lends an
endearing enthusiasm to his part.
The other ensemble, a group of
two-bit players rehearsing the sad
tale of "Pyramus and Thisbe" in
the forest, provides the most
laughs for this production. They
not only have funny lines, but
they look comic and have a defi
nite rapport with each other. Al
Blair, who played the character
part of Launce in "Two
Gentlemen," portrays Nick Bot
tom, the principal player of this
scruffy troupe. His parts call for a
certain amount of exaggeration,
which could be easily overdone,
but Blair is comically dramatic
without being silly.
David Maier, playing both

Theseus and Oberon, has striking
presence as well as versatility in
distinguishing between his part as
Duke of Athens (Theseus) and as
the king of the forest spirits
(Oberon). As Theseus he is
majestic but remote; as Oberon
he is volatile, often vengeful, but
ultimately just.
Art Manke's Puck tends to be
less devious than one expects (I
see him as an irresponsible brat
with malicious actions, but little
evil intent) and, at times, is even
sensitive to the plight of the mis
matched lovers. It certainly
makes him more likeable, but
diminishes the dramatic impact of
having a devilish fairy.
Director Janice Hutchins paces
the production well, although it
slows considerably whenever
there are "serious" asides on
dreaming or fantasy, such as in
'the beginning and end.
This is, in most aspects, a fine
performance of Shakespeare's
"Midsummer Night's Dream,"
and worth attending.
