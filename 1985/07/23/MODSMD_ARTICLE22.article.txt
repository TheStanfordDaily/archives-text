in the Northern California Open
at Diablo Country Club in Dan
ville. And on Aug. 14, when he
turns 50, Brodie will be eligible to
play on the PGA Senior Tour.
"I've had 12 great years with
NBC," he said. "When they
learned I was thinking of trying
the pro tour, we sat down and dis
cussed it. NBC said, 'We can't
pay a guy $300,000 to $500,000 a
year to be part time.' I said,
'That's why I want to discuss it.' "
Brodie, who spent the majority
of his NBC tenure announcing
football before switching to golf,
decided he "wanted to play golf
— full time."

Brodie quarterbacked the San
Francisco 49ers after leaving Stan
ford, and tried the PGA Tour as a
pro for two winter seasons in the
late 19505, when he said he
learned that you can't do well in
golf as a part-timer.
"When you become 50 and
love to play golf, then that's the
thing to do," he said.
Brodie will play in his first
seniors event in late August in the
Shootout at Jeremy Ranch in Salt
Lake City.
