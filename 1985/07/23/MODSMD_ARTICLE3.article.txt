# City Council considers cable options
## News 
### JAN GOBEN Staff writer 
The Palo Alto City Council heard offers
from two cable television companies last
night, both of which are competing for the
right to finally provide the mid-Peninsula
with cable programming.
After more than five years of delibera
tions, only two cable companies — Cable
Communications Cooperative of Palo Alto
and City Cable Partners, Inc. — remain in
the bidding to provide service for residents
of Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Atherton, East
Palo Alto, Stanford and parts of San Mateo
County.
Representatives from the two companies
gave half-hour presentations at the council
meeting, and then answered questions
from the public. Because the council must
compare two 150-page proposals, it will
not make its final decision until Sept. 23,

City Manager Bill Zaner said.
Both cable companies would use the
services of larger corporations to manage
the cable system. Cable Co-op. has con
tracted Heritage Communications of Des
Moines, lowa, while City Cable would use
Viacom, based in Mountain View.
Both have contracted with Pacific Bell to
build the system, which would take a mini
mum of 18 months to-construct.
The major difference between the two
cable companies is their ownership
structures. Cable Co-op, as the name indi
cates, operates on a cooperative basis, with
subscribers voting on rates and services.
City Cable Partners was started by a group

of investors who plan to raise equity
through private stock placement.
Lisa Van Deusen, executive director of
Cable Co-op, said Stanford would benefit
if her company were selected because the
school could receive the full service at a
discount rate.
She said Cable Co-op also plans to work
with Stanford students on joint produc
tions and to provide internships. Cable Co
op already has Stanford professors and one
Stanford student on its advisory board, she
said.
When asked about Cable Co-op's com
petitor, Van Deusen said, "City Cable is
adding on to its Mountain View system.

They want to get more subscribers because
they're losing money."
City Cable, however, cites a lack of ex
perience among Cable Co-op personnel
and boasts lower initial rates. In an ad
vertisement in the Palo Alto Weekly, City
Cable asserts that Viacom has won
numerous awards for "excellence in local
cable programming/'
A 1983 lawsuit by another cable com
pany against Menlo Park, Palo Alto and
Atherton could result in new federal legis
lation altering who can provide cable tele
vision, what kinds of channels might be
offered, and how much the services may
cost.
Century Federal sued the three cities,
saying the First Amendment gives them the
right to provide cable television to residents
without going through Palo Alto's
lengthy franchising process.
Attorneys for the cities argued
that the process was legal and ne
cessary, and a federal judge ulti
mately dismissed the suit.
Later the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Los Angeles
ruled that free expression rights
are violated when only one cable
system is allowed in an area that
could accomodate more.
With this boost, Century
Federal filed a second lawsuit in
March in the 9th Circuit against
the cities based again on the First
Amendment.
The court has rejected an ap
peal by city officials to reconsider
its decision, and the case has been
referred to a lower court for
resolution.
