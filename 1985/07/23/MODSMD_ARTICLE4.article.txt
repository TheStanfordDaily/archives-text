# Stanford reacts to high- tech woes
## Scholars examine valley's problems

Read the headlines in a local
newspaper.
On a typical day, the odds of
finding a story chronicling what
one termed the "unprecedented
recession in high tech" are excel
lent.
For Silicon Valley's once
booming computer makers and
chip producers, these are atypical
times — many experts say the
high-tech industry is going
through its toughest period ever.
"We have gone though the big
gest crash in orders in over 10
years," the vice president of Intel
Corp., a Santa Clara-based com
puter chip manufacturer, told The
Washington Post last month.
To discover the problems un
derlying Silicon Valley's current
economic woes, a number of
Stanford experts familiar with the
high-technology industry were in-

terviewed. Contrary to the headlines, many
of them do not see Silicon Valley facing se
vere, fundamental problems, and few see
any threat of Japan gaining the upper hand
in technology.
Reports of a crisis in Silicon Valley are
"just wrong," according to Timothy Bres
nahan, associate professor of economics. "If
you qualify things a lot, that's true," he said.
While economic trends are not working
out as well as companies had hoped, "High
tech employment is growing. . . . Manufac
turing employment in Silicon Valley is 2
percent higher than it was a year ago," he
said.
Richard Reis, assistant director of the
Center for Integrated Systems (CIS), said
the industry is only in decline relative to its
past performance. Profits in the high-tech
industry are "down relative to last year, but
certainly still part of an overall climb that
began five years ago," he said. "The indus
try is still growing at an annual rate that is
still good."
Reis said companies are being forced to
lay people off because "a lot of people were
hired to deal with the demand in 1984." If,
for example, a company geared up to double
output and only realized 20 percent growth,
it would be forced to cut back, he explained.
Bresnahan breaks the current economic
slowdown in high-tech into two separate
parts — the problems of the integrated cir
cuit industry and those of the personal com
puter industry.
Within Santa Clara County, the share of
employment in the integrated circuit busi
ness is falling, he said, "in part because
demand for integrated circuits in genera! is
falling and in part because integrated cir
cuits are being manufactured outside the
United States or outside Silicon Valley."

Despite the simultaneous occurrence of
slumps in integrated circuits and personal
computers, Bresnahan said the two are not
linked. In the personal computer industry,
he said, there are no clear patterns of
decline or growth. That industry is going
through a shakeout period now, according
to him.
Reis said computer sales have leveled off
because "people are now kind of pausing to
see what the next step will be" in the devel
opment of new computers. Consumers, he
said, are now trying to find out how to use
the computers they have rather than pur
chase more, or are waiting for major tech
nological breakthroughs to hit the market.
Some commentators suggest that high
tech is in decline because, as Business Week
magazine wrote earlier this month,
"Japanese competition in semiconductors
may be proving much more severe than ex
pected."
"The Japanese have certainly had an im
pact,'' agreed Tom Heller, a professor at the
Law School who teaches international poli
tical economy.
That situation exists, say some, because of
Japan's restrictive import policies and dum
ping by Japanese firms — selling chips on
the U.S. market for less than the average
cost of production.
The Semiconductor Industry Association,
based in San Jose, has filed those charges
against Japan, and the office of the U.S.
Trade Representative is currently inves
tigating. If Japanese markets were as open
as others in the world, according to the SIA,
27,000 more jobs would be available in the
U.S. semiconductor industry, and the indus
try's profits could have been boosted as
much as 69 percent.
Do the Japanese exclude American com
panies from their markets? "No question
about it," answered Business School Prof.
Henry Rowen. "The Japanese manage.one
way or another to keep out a lot of Ameri
can products."

But, Rowen cautioned, the main impedi
ment to U.S. high-tech companies selling
more chips and computers in Japan is the
high value of the dollar on world currency
markets.
Heller said a significant portion of the
problem is "associated with different styles
of marketing" in the United States and
Japan. A number of American companies
are currently beginning long-term strategies
to sell regularly in the Japanese market, he
said. This is a "learning process that will
take time," he said, but one that "over time
should lead to substantially more penetra
tion" of the Japanese market.
Many of the recent articles on the high
tech industry have expressed concern that
the recent upsurge in Japanese high-tech
sales are related to Japan catching up with
and passing the United States in technology.
A July 5 editorial in The New York Times
announced: "The battle for the latest gener
ation of computer memory chips is over.
Japan has won."
But Heller said there is a reason why U.S.
firms have "lost" the battle for the lead in
producing 256,000-bit memory chips, those
referred to in The Times' editorial.
American firms "have devoted a great
deal of research and development to skip
ping over that stage," Heller said. American
firms are concentrating on being the first to
produce a chip capable of storing signifi
cantly more information than the 256,000-
bit chip.
"As larger scale integration becomes
reality, . . . you should see a pickup" in the
American semiconductor industry, he said.
Reis, of the CIS, said the United States
still remains technologically superior in the
world. "I think the (technological) forefront
is still right here in the back yard," he said.
The United States has things to learn from
the Japanese about manufacturing and pro
duction techniques, he added, but "We're
still, I think, quite ahead of the rest of the
world."
