The quality of Stanford re
search and Stanford graduates
will shelter the University from
the cold economic winds cur
rently blowing through Silicon
Valley, according to many Uni
versity officials.
"When there is a problem in
the Silicon Valley . . . they
(companies) tend to decrease the
number of schools they recruit at,
[but firms] inevitably continue to
want Stanford graduates," said
James Patterson, coordinator of
engineering and science counsel
ing at the Career Planning and
Placement Center (CPPC).
Patterson said majors in fields
such as electrical engineering,
computer science and math sci
ence are most in demand in the
area.
Richard Reis, assistant director
of the Center for Integrated Sys-
tems, said, "There is a drop in the number
of companies who are hiring these stu
dents, but it really only shows up in the
number of options they (students) can
identify." Reis works mainly with graduate
students.
Though many high-tech companies are
not growing as quickly as in the past, they
will continue to devote resources to
researching new technologies and develop
ing new products â€” tasks for which Stan
ford graduates are most in demand,
according to Reis.
"In the early '70s, many of these com
panies cut their research, and Japan really
passed them," he said. High-tech compan
ies learned a lesson from that experience
and, during the depths of the 1980 reces
sion, did not cut research and development
budgets, he explained.

"I don't believe it (the Silicon Valley
slowdown) is going to have a real big im
pact, but it's definitely worth monitoring,"
summed up Yolanda Morales, supervisor
of recruiting at the CPPC.
In addition to jobs, there is considerable
interaction between the Stanford faculty
and local industries. High-tech firms also
provide money for research at Stanford.
To date, though, neither chip manufac
turers nor computer companies, the two
main victims of the current decline, have
cut money for research at Stanford, ac
cording to Earl Cilley, director of the
Sponsored Projects Office, which handles
the University's research contracting.
"The chip makers are not heavy spon
sors of research at Stanford," he said. Cil
ley noted that computer makers do sponsor
research at Stanford, but said he assumed
their research work done here was
"sufficiently important" that it would not
be cut.
The recently dedicated $15 million Cen

terfor Integrated Systems (CIS) is the Uni
versity's major link to Silicon Valley.
Intended as a site for conducting research
in computer science, communications and
information science, the CIS building was
built with donations of $750,000 from 20
high-tech corporations. These sponsors
also agreed to donate $100,000 annually
for education, research and administration
at the center.
Each of the 20 can send a scientist to the
CIS for a year or more to do research.
Reis, the center's assistant director, said
interest in conducting research at the cen
ter seems to be increasing, and said he
thinks the CIS will ride out short-term eco
nomic problems. "I think they (companies)
view this as a critical long-term effort."
Richard Bennett, director of campaign
planning in the Office of Development,
said corporate donations to the University
vary with pre-tax earnings, but said the
length of time covered by corporate
budgets would prevent any effects from

being felt for about 18 months.
Bennett was optimistic about maintain
ing Stanford's "amazingly successful"
record of corporate giving over the past 10
years. "We haven't seen anything yet, and
I don't think we will."
"A lot of what's causing corporate giving
is exciting new research at Stanford," he
said. "It's an endless stream of exciting re
search, and that's attractive."
Alumni donations will probably not be
significantly impacted, he added, because
only a small percentage of all Stanford
alumni depend upon the high-tech industry
for a significant portion of their income.
Though Stanford is not being signifi
cantly affected by the current downturn,
Cilley warned that should it become a
long-term problem, Stanford will definitely
feel the impact.
"If the health of the computing industry
overall becomes very adversely affected,"
Cilley said, "clearly we're going to feel that
here at Stanford."
