## South African guerrillas see whites losing control 
### 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa— Black guer
rillas said yesterday that a state of emergency under
which the white-minority government has rounded
up hundreds of people is "an open admission . . .
that it is losing control."
The African National Congress, which carries on
its guerrilla campaign from exile, said the govern
ment's "desperate actions signify the beginning of
the end of the apartheid system."
Police reported continued scattered rioting and
said a patrol shot and killed two young blacks and
wounded five others when a mob of about 4,000
people attacked a policeman's home in the township
of Tsakane, east of Johannesburg. Another black
was killed earlier in a separate clash in nearby
Thokoza, the spokesman said.
A spokesman for the Detainees Parents' Support
Committee said as many as 200 people were ar
rested on Sunday and yesterday — 100 each in the
Johannesburg area and in eastern Cape Province.
The Eastern Province Herald said it knew of 80 to
90 detentions in the eastern Cape alone.
Police announced 113 other arrests Sunday under
South Africa's first emergency decree since the the
spread of violence that followed the 1960 Shar
peville riots. Sixty-nine people were killed in those
riots.
Police said they would have no further reports un
til today on detentions under the emergency, which
was declared Saturday and applies in 36 cities and
towns.

Nearly 500 blacks have been killed in 11 months
of violence aimed at white-minority rule, according
to private monitoring groups. Police said one man
was shot to death yesterday east of Johannesburg
when officers fired into a crowd attacking them.
Gen. Johan Coetzee, the police commissioner,
backed off a plan to censor articles about riot areas
but appealed to newspapers to "scale down infor
mation connected to the unrest." He said news
reports had fed racial strife.
Police are empowered to arrest people without
warrants, detain and interrogate suspects for 14
days, seal off areas, seize property, impose curfews
and control press reporting.
The detainees committee issued a statement
saying people in the black townships would see the
emergency as "a declaration of war."
The African National Congress, the main guer
rilla group fighting white rule, said President Pieter
Botha's emergency proclamation would spur South
Africa's blacks in the fight against white rule.
The United States did not criticize the emergency
declaration, but White House spokesman Larry
Speakes said in Washington that the apartheid sys
tem was "largely responsible for the current vio
lence."
South Africa "says it seeks to restore law and or
der, and that is understandable," Speakes said, "but
we look to the South African government to exer
cise its responsibilities in a scrupulous manner."
