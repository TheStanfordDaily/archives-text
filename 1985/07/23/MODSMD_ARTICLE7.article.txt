# NOW leader vows to energize group
## 
### 
NEW ORLEANS —
Eleanor Smeal, who won a
tough struggle for leadership of
the National Organization for
Women, is pledging to "raise a
little hell" in the battle for
abortion, the Equal Rights
Amendment and other NOW
causes.
"We've been good too
long," an exhausted but trium
phant Smeal said Sunday, a
few hours after an all-night
vote count showed her the vic
tor over incumbent Judy
Goldsmith.
"It's time really to go back
out into the streets. It's time to
organize, it's time to go to the
campuses.
"I intend to raise a little hell
with you all," she told cheering
delegates.to the annual NOW
convention. She said that effort
would include a march next
spring in Washington to
demand retention of abortion
on demand.
Smeal, 45, a former two
term president, won 839 votes

to 703 for Goldsmith.
Goldsmith issued a state
ment praising her rival as a
"proven leader who I know
will build a strong NOW and
move us quickly toward
equality." She then bade a
jaunty farewell to the
delegates, saying, "I am going
out into the world, which I
fully intend to take over."
Both women said NOW
would emerge united from the
tough leadership struggle, but
some Goldsmith supporters
made little secret of their dis
approval of Smeal's high
visibility style.
Under Goldsmith, said dele
gate Celia Barteau of
Springfield, Va., "I think
serious people have taken us
more seriously."
Efforts to protect abortion
clinics last winter against bomb
threats were quieter than
public marches, she said, but
successful. "Marches are just
getting to be a little ho-hum."
