Bomb rips airline office in Denmark
COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Bombs tore open a U.S. airline
office and damaged a synagogue and Jewish nursing home yes
terday in Copenhagen, a European capital that had previously
escaped the recent international terrorist wave.
«
Twenty-seven people were injured, at least three seriously,
authorities said. Three Americans were among those suffering
minor injuries, the U.S. Embassy reported.
Police later announced they had taken six foreigners into cus
tody for questioning in the bombings, but they did not disclose
the detainees' identities.
In Beirut, Lebanon, an anonymous telephone caller told The
Associated Press the attacks were carried out by the Shiite Mos
lem terrorist organization Islamic Jihad to avenge an Israeli raid
on a southern Lebanese village Sunday. The claim could not be
otherwise verified.
One bomb gutted the quarters of Northwest Orient Airlines
near Copenhagen's Tivoli amusement park. Northwest Orient is
the only American airline with offices in the Danish capital.
Another attack, which some bystanders said involved two
bombs, damaged the Copenhagen Synagogue and an adjacent
Jewish home for the elderly, the Meyers Minne Nursing Home,
on a narrow street near Copenhagen's 17th-century Round
Tower.
Both attacks came within minutes of each other in mid
morning, as shoppers crowded nearby streets, taking advantage
of late summer sales.
Harald Ruetz, a Northwest Orient manager, said one em
ployee and two customers were in the office at the time of the ex
plosion, which appeared to have been set off outside its plate
glass windows.
An employee of the nursing home said about seven of its resi
dents had been injured, none seriously. The other victims ap
parently were passers-by at the two sites.
Police said about half the injured were Danes and half foreig
ners. The most seriously injured victim was reported by police to
have suffered burns over 85 percent of the body.
J. H. Hasselriis, a deputy police director, told reporters six
foreigners were being questioned but had not been formally ar
rested. He declined to give their nationalities, but indicated they
came from Mediterranean countries.
The Beirut caller indicated Copenhagen was targeted precisely
because Denmark had escaped terrorist activity until now.
Jewish terrorist elements sentenced
JERUSALEM — A court yesterday sentenced three members
of an underground Jewish gang to life in prison for killing three
Palestinians, and 12 others to lesser terms for attacks on Arabs in
the occupied West Bank.
The defendants, most of whom are Jewish settlers, claimed
they acted in self-defense and said they would appeal for presi
dential pardons. Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir, leader of the
conservative Likud bloc, has recommended clemency and an
opinion poll indicated most Israelis favor it.
Defendants, their families and supporters responded with
defiant shouts and songs when the sentences were pronounced in
the heavily guarded courtroom.
Announcement of the sentences by the three-judge court
ended a 13-month trial that brought into question the govern
ment's security policies in the West Bank of the Jordan River,
which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
The three defendants sentenced to life were convicted July 10
of killing three Palestinian students and wounding 33 in a 1983
shooting spree at Islamic University in Hebron, south of
Jerusalem.
The 12 others, also convicted July 10, received sentences of
from four months to seven years in prison, plus suspended terms.
Members of the underground ring, the largest Jewish terror
group in Israel's history, won widespread sympathy for their ar
gument that the government was lax in responding to Palestinian
violence against Jews who lived in the occupied territories.
The charge of causing grievous bodily harm carries a maximum
20-year sentence, but the defendants charged with the car bom
bings were given only three years.
The lengthy trial created widespread controversy about the
settlement program that has moved 50,000 Israelis into the West
Bank in 18 years.
Public sympathy for the Jewish terrorists increased after the
government freed 1,150 Arab prisoners in exchange for three Is
raelis in May. An opinion survey in June showed that 72 percent
of Israelis questioned favored clemency for the Jews.
Korean university president fired
SEOUL, South Korea — The president of Seoul National Uni
versity was fired yesterday for refusing to expel seven students
involved in the occupation of a U.S. government library in May,
officials said.
Last week the school decided to suspend the seven students in
definitely and refused to reverse the decision. The Education
Ministry urged that the students be expelled.
Ousted president Lee Hyun-jae had said that reversing the
decision would damage the authority of the faculty.
Twenty students seized the U.S. Information Service library in
downtown Seoul May 23-26 to demand that the United States
apologize for the bloody Kwangju uprising in 1980.
Troops killed 191 protesters in quelling the Kwanju uprising.
Many students blame the United States, believing it ordered its
ally to sent the troops to Kwangju.

20-year sentence, but the defendants charged with the car bom
bings were given only three years.
The lengthy trial created widespread controversy about the
settlement program that has moved 50,000 Israelis into the West
Bank in 18 years.
Public sympathy for the Jewish terrorists increased after the
government freed 1,150 Arab prisoners in exchange for three Is
raelis in May. An opinion survey in June showed that 72 percent
of Israelis questioned favored clemency for the Jews.
Korean university president fired
SEOUL, South Korea — The president of Seoul National Uni
versity was fired yesterday for refusing to expel seven students
involved in the occupation of a U.S. government library in May,
officials said.

definitely and refused to reverse the decision. The Education
Ministry urged that the students be expelled.
Ousted president Lee Hyun-jae had said that reversing the
decision would damage the authority of the faculty.

ally to sent the troops to Kwangju.
