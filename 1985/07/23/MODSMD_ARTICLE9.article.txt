Alaska's 'Watergate' begins
JUNEAU, Alaska — The Alaska Legislature
opened a historic hearing yesterday into whether
Gov. Bill Sheffield should be impeached for al
legedly steering a lucrative state lease to a politi
cal crony and lying to a grand jury. The governor
said he was looking forward to telling his side.
The political drama, which began July 2 with
the release of a grand jury inquiry into the way a
$9.1 million state office lease was negotiated, is
being carried live on television from the state's
biggest cities to Eskimo villages. It is the first
hearing of its kind in the state's history.
Legislative leaders called a special impeach
ment session after the grand jury recommended
that they consider removing the first-term Demo
crat from office. The 15-member panel said the
millionaire hotelier "is unfit to fulfill the inherent
duties of public office."
The grand jury returned no indictments, but it
criticized Sheffield for his testimony, saying it
"reflects a lack of candor and a disrespect for the
laws of this state," a characterization Sheffield
has denied.
George Frampton, who guided the grand jury
through its deliberations, said he told the panel in
closing remarks he felt Sheffield had committed
perjury during his testimony, adding "the lying to
you is really worse, more serious than the initial
substantive offense."
Both sides hired a battery of lawyers, including
several who played roles in the Watergate inves
tigation and impeachment proceedings that led to
the resignation of President Nixon in 1974.
The panel was investigating whether Sheffield
and John Shively, his former chief of staff,
manipulated lease requirements so only one com
pany could fulfill a state contract to provide
32,000 square feet of office space in Fairbanks.
That company, Mcßirney and Associates, won
the non-competitive, 10-year lease in February.
One of the partners in the company, labor leader
Lenny Arsenault of Fairbanks, raised about
$92,000 for Sheffield during his $2 million 1982
gubernatorial campaign, the grand jury said.
Sheffield, 57, has defended the lease, contend

ing it was designed to save the state money. It was
voided earlier this month on the recommendation
of former state Attorney Gen. Norman Gorsuch,
who said it was "tainted by political favoritism."
U.S., China chiefs to meet
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, in his
first meeting with a foreign leader since undergo
ing cancer surgery, hosts Chinese President Li
Xiannian today for abbreviated talks and
ceremonies that could provide the setting for the
formal approval of a landmark nuclear coopera
tion pact.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes said
Reagan, who is recovering from the major ab
dominal surgery 10 days ago, planned to greet
the 76-year-old Chinese leader.
Asked whether the two leaders would sign a
nuclear cooperation agreement during the visit,
Speakes said "some recommendations" were in
the White House, but that the matter was still un
der review.
The spokesman said the pact was being studied
by several government agencies to see if it
complied with U.S. law involving the transfer of
materials used in the manufacture of nuclear
power plants.
The initialing of the nuclear pact was touted as
the highlight of Reagan's China trip last year.
The agreement would allow U.S. companies to
sell nuclear power equipment, including radioac
tive material, to China.
The agreement was shelved because of intelli
gence information that China may have assisted
Pakistan in its efforts to develop a nuclear weap
ons capability, though both countries denied it.
Administration officials say they now have the
necessary assurances from China that it won't
help other nations acquire a nuclear capability,
and the accord probably will receive final ap
proval during Li's visit.
A cultural exchange agreement, an education
accord and a fisheries agreement — preparing the
way for Chinese to fish in American waters —
also will be signed during Li's visit.
