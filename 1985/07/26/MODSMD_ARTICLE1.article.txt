# Ousted prof. returns for hearing
## Franklin reflects on interim years 
### MARSH McCALL Editorial staff 
Did Stanford University have the right in
1972 to dismiss H. Bruce Franklin, a
tenured English professor and radical ac
tivist, for allegedly inciting students to
commit violent acts during a protest
march?
Franklin told The Daily Wednesday that
his case against the University is as rele
vant today as it was 14 years ago, when he
and student protesters broke into the Stan
ford Computation Center that Franklin
claimed was being used to program an in
vasion of North Vietnam.
"When the apartheid movement starts to
really challenge the power of the Univer
sity," Franklin said, "then you'll see a
response like in the early '705."
Franklin, who yesterday continued his
appeal against the 1972 ruling at a court
hearing in San Jose, is being represented
by the American Civil Liberties Union,
which issued a bulletin earlier this
month describing Franklin as "the first and
only professor ever fired by the University
over expression of his political beliefs."
Franklin said the circumstances sur
rounding his dismissal were ironic because,
"My position was actually a conservative

one. 1 believe the University should be for higher
education, not a war machine."
Franklin explained that the ACLU has become
involved in the case because of the danger to free
speech his dismissal represents.
"A speech supporting democracy, Stanford Uni
versity and the President of the United States
doesn't need protection," Franklin said. "But a
speech which approaches the border of constitu
tional acceptance, which threatens those with power
and unsettles authority — that speech needs protec
tion."
In 1972, an advisory board charged Franklin with
infringing on "the rights of others in the University,
and significantly increased the risk of injury to them
and to University property." University President
Richard Lyman accepted the formal recommenda
tion of the advisory board, and Franklin was dis
missed. Then-Prof. Donald Kennedy, chairman of
the seven-member board, was one of two who dis
sented from the majority decision.
"The charge that Prof. Franklin did significantly
interfere with orderly dispersal by intentionally ur
ging and inciting students and other persons present
at the Computation Center to disregard or disobey
such orders to disperse is not one we can sustain,"
Kennedy wrote in his report to the advisory board
13 years ago.
Yesterday, Kennedy refused to comment on any
aspects of the case, fearing that a statement might
influence the court proceedings.
Franklin alleged that he was expelled for causing
an incident in which no laws were actually broken.
"There were no convictions after the rally," he said,
"The University actually admitted that no rules or
regulations had been broken. So, in effect, I was dis
missed for 'inciting' what couldn't be prosecuted.
"The University has to make some pretty
tortured arguments to get around that fact," he
added.
Franklin now teaches at Rutgers, The State Uni

versity of New Jersey. "Things are pretty different
at Rutgers," he said. "The president of the univer
sity got himself arrested at a protest in New York."
English professor David Halliburton, who shared
offices with Franklin between 1969 and 1971, said
Franklin was a "totally committed radical."
"He's a little more subdued now," Halliburton
said, "But only in manner. His ideology hasn't
changed."
Halliburton said Franklin's activism "helped
people realize Eisenhower's wisdom in warning
against the military infractions of our institutions."
For the time being, Franklin says he is happy
teaching at Rutgers, expressing enthusiasm for
"introducing intellectual thought" to his students.
Franklin is currently promoting a recently
completed book on the Vietnam war. A section of
the work on the anti-war movement is illustrated by
his White Plaza speech.
