Stanford Students Opposed to Pornography (STOP) in
tends to protest the release of the October issue of Playboy
Magazine, containing a feature called "Girls of the Pac
10,'' by inserting copies sold at The Store into envelopes
containing with anti-pornography literature.
Previously, the group attempted to persuade Tresidder
officials to remove the magazine from The Store's shelves.
To protest against Playboy and pornography is every
one's right,, but protesting in this fashion forces the
opinions of STOP members upon the campus and is wrong.
Banning the magazine denies all students the right to
choose for themselves the ideas and magazines they will
possess and consume. On an issue as complex as pornogra
phy this hardly seems like an appropriate response. We do
not profess to have all the answers on pornography, but by
attempting to ban the magazine, STOP is saying it knows
better than any Stanford student whether he or she ought
to be exposed to pornography.
Though covering Playboy with a wrapper and putting a
note in each copy is not as obvious, this action also imposes
the views of STOP upon the community. Forcing "correct"
information on those who opt to buy the magazine violates
the rights of those purchasers. If this were allowed, why
shouldn't William F. Buckley, who believes capitalism to
be the correct way, be able to insert warning fliers into the
copy of "The Marx-Engels Reader" that many freshman
buy each year? Is Buckley less correct on politics than
STOP on pornography?
We salute the efforts of STOP to inform the campus of
its views on pornography through White Plaza rallies and
campus petition drives. These are laudable actions contri
buting to the lively exchange of ideas on campus at a time
when the role of pornography in society is coming under
close scrutiny.
We certainly see how "Girls of the Pac-10" could arouse
anger in some members of the Stanford community. But
assuming that The Store sells at least some copies of
Playboy each month, all community members are not
similarly affected. Until STOP has that "right" answer, it is
not justified in imposing its views on everyone else.
