"Blackmail through violence to force political
change cannot be permitted under any circum
stances. ''
-Andries Treurnicht
While that statement sounds as though it could
have come from our president or secretary of state,
it came, in fact, from the leader of the far-right Con
servative Party of South Africa. The sentiment it ex-

presses, as well as an unspoken converse which it
implies in the case of South Africa, may be useful in
explaining some of the aspects of our foreign policy
and might illuminate why we support, and probably
will continue to support, a country like South
Africa.
It is an oversimplification to assume that our
foreign policy is merely dependent upon whether or
not a country is communist, because we do exten
sive business with several communist countries, such
as Yugoslavia, and we actively court the People's
Republic of China. Also, we are not necessarily
allied with every non-communist nation, or even
with every nation trying to fight off a communist in
surgence, such as Chad. The fundamental principle
of our foreign policy, if the Reagan Administration
can be said to have a foreign policy, seems to be
more closely related to the concept of law and or
der.
Law and order, pronounced "lawnorder" and
generally considered as a single thing, holds a par
ticularly privileged position in our society; while
perhaps not everyone is an active supporter of law
and order, few indeed are the individuals who are
willing to say outright that they oppose it.
In South Africa, the newly declared state of emer
gency gives the authorities what amounts to un
limited power to maintain law and order. In fact,
with a view to maintaining public order, the police
in South Africa may now arrest any person without
a warrant, imprison him indefinitely without a trial

and deny him access to anybody outside. They may
also search any area, vehicle or person, close any
public or private place, control all travel and censor
or prohibit press coverage.
Obviously, the government of South Africa
stands for nothing if not law and order. Law and or
der constitutes the the soul of the unspoken con
verse of Treurnicht's statement that becomes so
readily apparent in the conduct of the South African
government: Blackmail through violence to prevent
political change is acceptable.
So far the only reaction from our government
concerning South Africa's declaration of a state of
emergency has been a mild admonition to the
people in Pretoria to "exercise their responsibilities
in a scrupulous manner." This admonition was,
naturally, accompanied by a statement of the ad
ministration's continued support for the policy of
constructive engagement and opposition to any
sanctions against the government of South Africa.
At the same time that the U.S. government urges
"constructive engagement" with South Africa, even
though South Africa is now a police state, it urges
military and financial aid to the "freedom fighters"
in Nicaragua, so that they can free the people by
ousting the "totalitarian" Sandinistas.
Just as our alleged foreign policy is not simply de
termined by a country being communist or non
communist, it is neither determined by a given

country being relatively free or oppressive. Our
choice of allies in cases such as South Africa, South
Korea or the Philippines indicates that the amount
of freedom allowed by governments is not a serious
consideration.
It seems that the determining principle of our
foreign policy brings us right back to law and order.
We are prepared to tolerate whatever means are ne
cessary to prevent radical change, including violence
and oppression, but as Mr. Treurnicht said, violence
to force political change cannot be permitted.
