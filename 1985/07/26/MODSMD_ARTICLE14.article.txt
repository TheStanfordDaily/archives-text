Apartheid is cause
for not contributing
The caption on the front page
of June's Stanford Observer said
graduates carrying black flags
were "protesting South African
apartheid." Wrong. What we
were protesting was not apart
heid itself, but Stanford's com
plicity in it, through Stanford's
continuing investment in com
panies that do business in the
racist economy of South Africa.
The only other reference to
the protesters in the 12-page
paper merely mention "support
for South African divestment."
Readers who got their news only
from The Observer would have
no way of knowing that the
protest was directed against
Stanford. Perhaps the University,
which publishes The Observer, is
afraid of the protesters' call for a
boycott on contributions to Stan
ford?
This would also explain why
speakers at both Class Day and
Commencement mocked the idea
of withholding contributions as a
means of putting pressure on the
University. University President
Donald Kennedy said people

who wouldn't contribute were
"prepared to invalidate the
entire range of a great institu
tion's activity as punishment for
a single disappointment."
Well, Mr. Kennedy, Trustee
James Gaither stood up at the
divestment forum and said the
trustees felt that their principal
responsibility was to "seek the
best return from the assets that
we have." He went on to say that
"our responsibilities, not the
merits of the cause we are ad
dressing today, may well cause
the Board of Trustees to reach
different conclusions than those
that have been advocated before
me." If the "merits of the cause"
are secondary, one wonders how
the University can be persuaded
on this issue, other than through
financial pressure.
Besides, if I wanted to contrib
ute to an institution with maxi
mization of income as its highest
principle, I would contribute to
General Dynamics. Then I would
be sure that my money wouldn't
be wasted on frivolous things like
making the world a better place
in which to live.
