## Justice won't be 'lone' for long 
### 
On the second side of Lone
Justice's self-titled debut album
for Geffen Records, in the middle
of the song "Soap, Soup and
Salvation," lead singer Maria
McKee warbles an a cappella ver
sion of the old gospel hymn
44 When the Roll Is Called Up
Yonder." It's an audacious, gutsy
move, and McKee carries it off
beautifully.
Her soulful country twang is
reminiscent of the best female
country singers (Dolly Parton,
Loretta Lynn) as well as the best
rock singers (Linda Ronstadt,
Chrissy Hynde, even Cyndi
Lauper). McKee sings it in a voice
that is both world-weary and
hopeful at the same time; it's gor
geous.
It is also indicative of the bril
liance of the rest of the album.
"Soap, Soup and Salvation,"
written by McKee, describes a
rescue mission that promises
cleansing and nourishment, both
spiritual and physical. For most of
the song, the mission is a thing
separate from the singer. She is
just observing it, seemingly unaf
fected by the "faded sorts" who
listen to ". . . the heavenly music
playing" and the "tired souls
singing jubilation" who seek
"restoration."
At the end of the song, though,
McKee enters the same emo
tional domain as the down and
outs who frequent the mission.
She sings, "I just thought I heard
the choir singing my old favorite
song./ That old harmony is
familiar, though it's been so
long," and then launches into
"When the Roll Is Called "
The singer, too, is in need of
redemption and "restoration,"
and the song, raucous and rousing
until this point, becomes sublime.
The album is rife with moments
like these, and because of its easy
artistry, it is difficult to accept the
album as a debut; Lone Justice
has the feel of a group that has
been around a long time. This is
no doubt due to the great help of
Torn Petty and his keyboard

player, Benmont Tench, but there
is still something wonderful in lis
tening to a band like Lone Justice
for the first time. It's the same
excitement of discovery we get
when we listen to the amazing
debut albums of The Pretenders,
Marshall Crenshaw, R.E.M. and
others as great as these. How, we
wonder, can something so good
have remained undiscovered until
now?
McKee and her band, like
Bruce Springsteen or Christine
Kerr (Chrissy Hynde), believe
that rock and roll is something
more than a popular diversion.
Their music reaffirms rock's
power to reveal and redeem, to

be art. It can portray the beauty
and humor inherent in even the
pettiest of dreams and struggles,
and Lone Justice accomplishes
this with hard-earned grace.
Most of the songs on the album
contain moments that surprise us
with a power that goes beyond
the simple narrative. Another
song, "After the Flood," seems to
be about a rural disaster, some
thing we've seen too many recent
movies try to be about. Yet
through the power of McKee's
vocals and song writing, it
becomes clear that it is also a song
about spiritual devastation and

perhaps even romantic
heartbreak. "The land it washed
away" McKee sings, "felt like my
flesh and blood. . . ./ Life goes on,
after the flood." The song takes
on more meaning with each lis
tening. It bristles with daring and
talent, and it may just be the al
bum's best song.
The album is not, though, a col
lection of "arty," earnest, spiri
tual yearnings. Its incredible di
versity has to be taken into ac
count. The band understands that
there is another important ele
ment to rock and roll: sheer fun.
The album opens with the kicker
"East of Eden" in which McKee
tells where her love lies and also

includes a Tom Petty/Mike
Campbell song "Ways To Be
Wicked." It's a great piece of
writing by Petty and Campbell. In
it, McKee wonders why she takes
the abuse her lover is giving her,
realizes it is because she loves him
and also realizes that her lover
knows it and is using it to his own
advantage. But, she concludes, he
doesn't "... know one little thing
about love," even though he
thinks he has her all figured out.
''Don't Toss Us Away," writ
ten by Bryan Mac Lean, is the
goopiest fun to be had since
Tammy Wynette's "Stand by

Your Man." Even the exuberant,
rocking love song "Sweet, Sweet
Baby," written by McKee,
Tench and Steve Van
Zandt, who also plays lead guitar,
is wonderful. It bounces along
with McKee's soaring vocal and a
very clever counterpoint arrange
ment of the background vocalists.
On "Working Late" (reminiscent
of The Pretenders' "Thum
belina"), an at-home
housewife comes to doubt more
and more her husband's reason
for being late the later it gets. The
band's handling of the steam
engine rhythm in this song has the
assurance of true talent and
professionalism.

Perhaps, though, the most fun
is to be had with "Wait 'til We
Get Home." It reminds you of
Aretha Franklin as McKee com
plains about the lack of respect
she gets from her man when they
are out with his friends. "Wait 'til
we get home," she sings
ominously in the chorus. "I'm
savin' it up, I'm gonna let it fly."
She worries about the effect all
this screaming and hollering will
have on her man, however, and
abruptly changes her tactics.
"Don't think that I don't love
you, just because I yell a little,"
she says, and then sings the

chorus so sexily and slyly, "Wait
'til we get home" becomes a
promise of a much more intrigu
ing sort. It's a glee, sexy, burner
of a song, and the surprises
McKee springs with her voice and
the lyrics are sheer joy. This
woman not only knows how to
sing, she knows a little about life
and love as well.
Musically, the band can't help
sounding a little like Petty's
Heartbreakers, but there are cer
tainly worse crimes. In fact,
McKee, on lead guitar, Ryan
Hedgecock on guitar and back
ground vocals, Marvin Etzioni on
bass and background vocals and
Don Heffington on drums, are
joined by Tench from the Petty
band, on almost all of the songs.
Tench's playing is fine, occasion
ally great, although the honky
tonk solo on "Don't Toss Us
Away" is a little too slick to be
authentic. Jimmy lovine,
producer of previous albums by
Petty, Ronstadt and Stevie
Nicks, among others, gives
his characteristic country-rock
sheen to the album, and here it is
wonderfully welcome. Lone
Justice understands the connec
tions between country and rock
and knows how to use them.
The most important facet of
Lone Justice, though, is Maria
McKee — both her songwriting
and her voice. It is simply as
tounding in its power and
originality. It tries every available
tact to get across its characteristic
human emotions of love, lust,
hurt, suffering and hope. It turns
a simple, straightforward love
song called "You Are the Light"
into art, transcending its poten
tially sappy lyrics. McKee and the
rest of Lone Justice demonstrate
on their very first album that they
know more about rock and roll
than many bands who have been
around much longer. What they
do on their first album is impor
tant and impassioned; it is great
rock and roll.
