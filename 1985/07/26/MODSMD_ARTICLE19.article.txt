# ROUGH CUTS

Bryan Ferry
"Boys and Girls" (Warner Bros.)
As the influential and creative
force behind the 1970s avant
garde art-rockers Roxy Music,
Bryan Ferry helped forge a bold
and distinctive new style of music
known most simply as "Roxy
Music." With their piercingly
sweet saxophone and carefully
conceived notions concerning the
link between the intellect and the
feet, Roxy sculpted music into the
lush and sweeping aural
soundscapes that make their last
two albums, "Flesh and Blood"
and "Avalon," caressive ventures
into the sensual and passionate
realm of modern man's pleasures
and vices.
Ferry's latest album, "Boys and
Girls," is essentially a continua
tion of the Roxy Music style.
Songs such as "Windswept,"
"Sensation" and "A Wasteland,"
in their titles as well as their con
tent, give the album a flow and
feeling which strokes the listener
onto a plateau of gentle sensory
undulation — sound images float
in the midst of barely-awakened
awareness.
But as the last and title track
drifts through one's conscious
ness, the album finishes, and you
are left with nothing that you can
hold onto, nothing that lingers to
help bring those sensations to any
sort of lasting fulfillment of body
and soul. All that remains is the
fleeting memory of a mood, a
passion and a moment until you
once again place the needle to the
groove and let the sea of sound
sweep you away to another ride
through the unknown and known
of pleasures.

March Violets
"Natural History" (Rebirth)
The opening track of the debut
album from England's March
Violets sent me running for my
Hank Williams records, as some

cheap imitation of a Casio drum
machine shot through the
speakers, bounced off my living
room walls and went straight for
my inner sense of musical in
tegrity. The absolute horror of an
entire album side of senseless yet
programmed automation could
drive one to drink — heavily.
Some honest to God mayhem
was being generated here, and I
couldn't quite see how it all fit.
Then I remembered my old Joy
Division records and — oh my
God! — the New Order song
"Sunrise" off their latest album.
Now I remember. This is like that
cacophony they used to call In
dustrial Music.
So this is why I had been so
confused: I had forgotten the
"cutting edge" this sort of music
had forged some six or seven

years ago, for those electronic
gadgets had thrown me off the
trail of what was at the time very
powerful and provocative new
music. There was, after all, noth
ing really new happening here
with these March Violets, only
that relentless beat and those
crazy guitars. I took a long gulp of
my Hank Williams and proceeded
to pour Jack Daniels on my
turntable.

R.E.M.
"Fables of the Reconstruction"
(1.R.5.)
The latest LP from Georgia's
own R.E.M. should give their
true fans reason to rejoice in ad

dition to presenting the rest of us
with an album well worth explor
ing. "Fables Of The Reconstruc
tion" is most definitely the sound
of R.E.M. as heard on their three
previous vinyl outings, in addition
to some new noises.
The pop noodlings and
relatively straightforward
delivery of their last record,
"Reckoning," has been limited to
one funky cut, "Can't Get There
From Here," the first radio single
off the album. The rest of
"Fables" seems to have been
built more upon the classic
"Murmur" LP, with its weird
primal utterances, slow and beau
tiful ballads and crazed pop sen
sibilities. Lead singer Michael
Stipe has, for the most part, trans
formed his singing on this album
from the unintelligible to the

vaguely discernible, so that the
majority of utterances on some
songs actually have meanings in a
known language.
Nevertheless, lyrical clarity
remains firmly anchored in the
murky background of R.E.M.
goals and intentions, and we can
all sleep soundly knowing that
Mr. Stipe still does not expect us
as listeners to ferret out his literal
meaning from the morass of
hums, groans, slurs, growls,
chants, mumbles, yelps and as
sorted banter used to ever
confuse the brain and tantalize
our ears. The guitars continue to
jangle, and the hooks are still
plentiful, but there is the added
confusion of banjo, harmonica,

strings and a host of other muses
which push this album out into
previously untested waters.
This is the same R.E.M. that
drove us absolutely looney trying
to figure out the words to
"Gardening At Night" when their
first EP, "Chronic Town," came
out nearly five years ago; this is
bound to please the jaded R.E.M.
veteran in addition to providing
the uninitiated with yet another
chance to sample the acquired
and worthwhile taste that is
R.E.M.

Buckwheat Zydeco
"Turning Point" (Rounder)
Zydeco music, from which
Stanley "Buckwheat" Dural has
borrowed his performing
surname, is a genre born and bred
in the swamps and backwater
bayous of rural Louisiana. Played
in traditional French style, it is
the generationless Saturday night
dance music of the Creole people
who live between Lafayette,
La., and Houston.
Accordian, brass and wash
board combine with a driving
backbeat and electric guitar to
move the feet of grandmother as
well as children in the zydeco
dance halls of Creole country.
This is where Buckwheat formed
his lis Sont Partis Band in 1978
after spending three years playing
with the reigning "King Of
Zydeco," Clifton Chenier.
Buckwheat's vision of contem
porary zydeco music, while
remaining true to his Creole heri
tage, contains a fervid dose of
soul in addition to a basic debt to
rock 'n' roll. His latest album,
"Turning Point," is the wonderful
product of these influences in
conjunction with skilled
musicianship and faithful produc
tion work. It is one of those rare
records which successfully bridges
the gap from cultural and musical
tradition into a sound which is
truly fresh and new, with the
added bonus of danceability. If

you ever sing along to CCR or
work up a sweat to old James
Brown records, you will certainly
enjoy this foray into what is
genuinely American music.
A-
Suzanne Vega
"Suzanne Vega" (A & M)
Be forewarned, Suzanne Vega
is a classic 19705-style singer/song
writer. As cliched as that may
sound, she is not (totally)
derivative. In fact, her debut al
bum is very strong and surprising,
featuring a nimble voice, solid
sound and (occasionally) compel
ling lyrics.
Her debts to Joni Mitchell and
Janis lan are obvious. However,
like Mitchell, she seems more
inclined to take musical and vocal
risks rather than to rely merely
upon the imagery generated by
her words. She paints stark and
unusually vivid images
("Undertow," "Cracking"), and
often places herself upon an emo
tional limb through her delicate
phrasing and revealing tales.
This album is surprising in a
number of ways. Stylistically this
record would seem more appro
priate to 1975 than 1985; thus, for
fans of this genre, it will be a
pleasant relief from the Euro
syn-techno-Funk-American-pop
onslaught of the past few years.
This is an intelligent, well-crafted
album which is also adventurous
and revealing — one can only
hope for more.
B-
Grading Scale. A: Indispen
sable to any comprehensive col
lection. B: An eminently lis
tenable record which is lacking or
flawed in some significant way. C:
A record that fans of a particular
genre will find, at the most,
moderately enjoyable. D: Even
the most ardent fans will admit
that this record should never have
been made. F: Guano.
— Tony James and Dave Paulson
