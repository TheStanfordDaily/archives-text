# Appeal hearing in district court
## 
### JONATHAN PAUL Staff writer 
SAN JOSE â€” The Sixth District Court
of Appeal yesterday heard the case of H.
Bruce Franklin, a former tenured English
professor at Stanford who was fired by the
University in 1972 for allegedly "urging
and inciting students and others to disrupt
University functions. . .
Franklin, the only tenured professor
ever to be fired by the University, is chal
lenging the constitutionality of his dismis
sal.
Attorneys from the American Civil
Liberties Union, which is handling the
Franklin case, argued before an overflow
ing courtroom that the University had
agreed in its employment policies to guar
antee the Stanford faculty all the rights
enjoyed by faculty at public universities.
Franklin's attorneys also argued that his
speeches, were "neither directed to nor
likely to produce imminent lawless action,"
are therefore constitutionally
protected.
In addition, the ACLU attorneys said
Franklin, a communist and radical activist,
was fired "for his views and not his ac
tions."
"Franklin was a vocal advocate of
revolutionary changes in the distribution of
power in the University and in so
ciety," his attorneys stated in
their brief of the case. The team
of lawyers also argued that
"incitement to University mis
conduct was tolerated at Stanford
and was never deemed grounds
for any punishment at all."
The University's counsel,
David Heilbron, responded that
Franklin's actions were an "abuse
of (his) power" as a professor and
referred to "days of violence" in
his court brief. The "University
has to be able to defend itself," he
said.
In 1972, a faculty advisory
board unanimously agreed that
Franklin should be punished for a
Feb. 10, 1971, speech in White
Plaza in which he allegedly urged
protesters to shut down the Stan
ford Computation Center. The
majority said he also should be
disciplined for encouraging resis
tance to a police dispersal order
at the Computation Center the
same day and for inciting con
frontation during an Old Union
rally that night.
Franklin's 13-year odyssey
through the court system began in
August 1972 when he sued the
University for reinstatement,
back pay and damages.
In January 1978, after the
resolution of several preliminary
motions, Judge John Flaherty
overturned one of the Univer
sity's three charges against
Franklin.

After further hearings Judge
Flaherty ruled that Stanford and
not the courts should re-decide
the Franklin case based on the
remaining two charges.
On May 30, 1980, the Stanford
advisory board, which heard the
Franklin case originally, found
Franklin guilty on the two
remaining counts and again rec
ommended dismissal. The board's
findings were approved by then-
President Richard Lyman on
June 6.
Yesterday's hearing was an ap
peal of Judge Flaherty's decision
to let the remaining two counts
stand.
After being fired from Stan
ford, Franklin, an expert on the
writings of Herman Melville, was
unable to find employment for
three years. In 1974 and 1975 he
was a visiting professor at Yale
University and at Wesleyan Uni
versity in Connecticut.
Franklin has been a tenured
professor at Rutgers, The State
University of New Jersey's
Newark campus since 1975 and
has won several awards for distin
guished scholarship and teaching.
He currently serves as chairman
of the committee that oversees
appointments and promotions at
Rutgers-Newark .
After the hearing, Franklin said
he has continued his political ac
tivities at Rutgers and "has never
been in any sort of trouble."
"Stanford University," he
charged, "is even more at the
heart of the machinery of war
(than it was in the 19605), and
Rutgers isn't."
