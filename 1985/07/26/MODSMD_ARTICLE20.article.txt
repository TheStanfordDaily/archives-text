# This market is more than a fish story
## 
### 
Picture this if you can: a
crowded restaurant, the smell of
seafood in the air. Before you, a
young man is selling shrimp cock
tails and white wine to the guests
waiting to be seated. You look
around and notice photographs of
the seafaring life, new and old,
overlooking the busy little cafe. A
large chalkboard describing
''Today's Fresh Fish" catches
your eye now, and you read it,
wondering to yourself what in the
world "opaka paka" could be.
Is this Fisherman's Wharf?
Cannery Row? All good guesses,
but wrong. You are only about a
mile or so from Stanford, stand
ing in the middle of The Fish
Market — easily one of the
Peninsula's more popular seafood
restaurants. Judging from the
large number of people dining
there night after night, it is in no
danger of losing that long
standing popularity.
The Fish Market stands in such

favor because, without getting too
technical, it is a fun place to enjoy
a meal. When a restaurant makes
you feel as if you're on vacation,
it is doing something right, and
The Fish Market is definitely
doing something right.
By this time, you must be ask
ing yourself what makes this place
so enjoyable. It is what The Fish
Market doesn't have that I
noticed most. The restaurant isn't
over-decorated like some seafood
places; there are no aquariums,
no murals on the walls and no
plastic fish hanging from the
ceiling. In fact, it appears The
Fish Market has gone to great
lengths to avoid those flashy trim
mings.
From the wooden floors and
tables to the stained glass lamps
that keep the restaurant well lit
and appealing, it is obvious The
Fish Market thinks about more
than its seafood. The interior sur
roundings have a great deal to do

with the spirit of the restaurant;
The Fish Market has a nautical
charm with which few restaurants
can compete.
This charm also extends to the
extensive menus, which feature
many popular seafood dishes, as
well as some of which a fisherman
might never have heard. The res
taurant actually offers choices of
meals off two menus, one of
which lists the fresh catches of the
day. It took a while to decipher
the menu, but once we were
ready to order, our waitress was
conveniently there for us.
While I chose to begin my meal
with a combination shrimp and
crab cocktail, my partner decided
to try a small shrimp louie salad.
Both were extremely generous
with the shrimp and quite good,
although a bit expensive for ap
petizers — the salad was priced at
$3.95, and the cocktail cost
$5.25.
For variety, we decided to or
der a dinner off each menu. Since
I was more familiar with seafood
than my guest, I chose the fresh
"troll Chinook salmon," priced at
$10.90. It was a good choice —
the two boneless steaks were
more tender and better tasting
than the salmon I had in Alaska
last summer.
Each dinner came with a choice
of either rice or potatoes (au
gratin or boiled) and a choice of
homemade coleslaw, cottage
cheese or cherry tomatoes; the au
gratin potatoes were especially
delicious and complemented our
meals very well.
Being a shrimp lover, my guest
could not resist choosing a shrimp
dinner from the regular menu.
The shrimp, at $11.50, were on a
wooden skewer and advertised as
being cooked with bacon; the
combination of the two was ex

tremely palatable. There were
about 10 to 15 shrimp, which
made it a quite filling meal. If my
guest had one complaint, it was
that there was not enough bacon
for all the shrimp; however, she
managed to overlook this and ate
every bite.
While it is true that eating at
The Fish Market will satisfy a
healthy appetite, one's wallet will

also go away full. The prices on
the "fresh 1 ' menu range from $7
to $15, with most hovering
around the $10 mark; a fair price
to pay for the excellent seafood
you receive.
Oh, by the way, "opaka paka"
is a brightly colored Hawaiian
snapper.
