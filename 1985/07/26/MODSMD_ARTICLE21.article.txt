# R.E.M. better than dreaming
## 
### PHIL CHEN 
R.E.M. stands for Rapid Eye
Movement, the name for a state
in sleep in which the eyes dart
about under closed lids, as if the
sleeping person were awake; it is
associated with dreaming. It is
thus an apt name for the band
from Athens, Ga. (also home of
the B-525, among others), that
played Tuesday night at the Santa
Cruz Civic Auditorium.
The show began with strange
floodlit shadows and a thundering
tape of a train that shook the
auditorium. This led into
"Feeling Gravity's Pull," from
R.E.M.'s latest LP, "Fables of the
Reconstruction," which provided
the bulk of the concert's material.
Lead singer Michael Stipe looked

like a mild-mannered CPA in his
horn-rimmed glasses, long rain
coat and pork pie hat.
Stipe promptly wrapped him
self around the microphone and
stayed that way for much of the
night, letting go of it only to swing
about arythmically or to do his
imitation of a straitjacketed per
son trying to dance violently to
Bill Berry's massive, zonking
drumbeats. Sometimes he would
even turn his back to the audience
as he sang. His voice was strong
and expressive, though the lyrics
were often unintelligible, as they
usually are on R.E.M.'s recordings.
Pete Buck treated us to the
chiming, ephemeral guitar work
for which R.E.M. has become well
known, but he also showed us

some darker, less melodic riffs
which mark the group's newer,
more adventurous sound. Buck
split his time on stage between
strumming unobtrusively in a cor
ner and charging around stage,
kicking up his legs and shaking his
long hair.
Bassist Mills had a few
problems with his instrument
early in the show. Once these
were cleared up, however, he was
excellent; quick, yet solid, and
never skittish.
R.E.M. chose a good set of songs
from their three records, but
some of the show's highlights
were the spontaneous, folksy
mini-jams that popped up at odd
times — during Mills' bass repair,
between songs, in the encore. A

cover version of Creedence's
"Have You Ever Seen the Rain"
was beautiful, and a new song,
"Hyena," was spellbinding.
True West, a band based in
Davis, opened for R.E.M. They
played in "new American tradi
tion" — country-western-come
rock, or country western with an
added twist of rock and roll. True
West play in the same genre of
several bands recently gaining
popularity and renown — The
Long Ryders and the Dream
Syndicate, which hail from South
ern California, and Green on Red
and The Meat Puppets, originally
from Arizona.
The crowd reaction to True
West was positive, despite a per
formance that was a bit lackluster
and contained little or no interac
tion among the band members.
The second act was a band
called Three O'Clock, who gave
an inspired performance of their

neo-psychedelic/'6os pop sound.
This band is especially popular
among the high school crowd;
they have a large cult following in
the Los Angeles area which ap
pears to be spreading to Northern
California and other parts of the
country as well. This appeared
evident from the number of
fashion-oriented younger types in
attendance Tuesday night.
R.E.M. made another Bay Area
appearance last Saturday at the
Greek Theatre in Berkeley (with
the same opening bands), but
they won't be seen around here
for a while, as their tour next
takes them to Southern Califor
nia.
These talented opening bands,
combined with R.E.M.'s interest
ing, well-played music and
original, amusing stage move
ments, made for an extremely en
tertaining evening.


Pete Buck demonstrated R.E.M.'s "adventurous" sound Tuesday night at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium.


Michael Stipe hardly looks as "mild-mannered" here as in concert.
