## Labor's history 'from the inside' 
### 
"Workers: Worlds of Labor"
By Eric Hobsbawm
Pantheon Books, 369 pp., $11.95
Summer was once a time when
my friends and I would live what
we called, only half-seriously,
"real life." Summer jobs — for
one of us at McDonalds; for an
other, fruit-picking; for yet an
other, cutting up fish in a West
Coast cannery — replaced
lectures and exams and hours
spent "studying" in libraries and
coffee houses. No doubt, like
many Stanford students in this
respect, we were in the ironic po
sition of experiencing the world
of labor — of hourly wages, of
shift work, of time clocks and of
trade unions — only when on
vacation.
As a student, Eric Hobsbawm,
the leading British social his
torian, also made what he
supposed was a temporary excur
sion into the "worker's country."
In the 10th chapter of "Workers:
Worlds of Labor" he tells the
story of enlisting as a soldier in
1940 and moving from his
residence at Cambridge into his
billet in the home of a working
class family, a bare 10 minutes
walk from his college. "To cross
from the life of one class into that
of the other, even within the same
medium-sized town, was to travel
into a different and unknown
country," he says. Unlike my
friends and I, Hobsbawm never
really left that world again, for
that family's work became in
some sense his life's work. The
strength of Hobsbawm's writings
generally, and of "Workers" in

particular, is that they seem to
take his readers inside the factory
gates, rather than leaving them
stranded amidst professorial file
folders. Labor history was once
written mainly by trade union
members themselves, who in
sisted on telling their own story,
since no one else would, and who,
as part of the 19th century's

great socialist movements, were
history-makers as well as his
torians. Latter day labor history,
as Prof. Hobsbawm writes it,
manages, in its conjunction of an
academic interest in interpreting
the world with a radical commit
ment to changing it, to retain

these politicized roots.
"Workers" contains 17 essays,
written between 1964 and 1983,
examining a variety of subjects.
The essays are united by an ap
proach best characterized as his
tory from within, as opposed to
history from above: Throughout
the collection Hobsbawm charts
not the permutations of the

various "isms" (Utopian
socialism, syndicalism, Marxism,
Maoism) adopted by labor move
ments, nor the political history of
the development of workers' or
ganizations, but instead the
changing material conditions and
lifestyles of the people who create

these ideologies and practice
these politics. Through this ap
proach Hobsbawm is able to pre
sent a geography which convinces
us that workers do indeed inhabit
a different country — a proposi
tion that challenges those
politicians, usually of the right,
who point to the recent defeats of
the world's workers' parties as
testimony to the obsolescence of
class politics.
Focusing mainly on the English
working class during the period
when it was forging its own cul
ture (for Hobsbawm, this is the
period of the new unionism, 1870-
1914), Hobsbawm demonstrates
how working people made even
the trivial details of their day-to
day existence into expressions of
their independent identity. Indus
trial workers all over Europe al
tered the pre-industrial rituals to
suit their revolutionized working
conditions: Weavers sang songs
recounting their disputes with
mill managers to the tunes of
traditional folksongs; May Day
became the "workers' Easter".
The flat peaked cap, which most
North Americans have seen only
on the head of the Andy Capp
character who figures in their
comic pages, was deliberately
sported by the English working
man as a distinctive badge of his
class identity. This man and his
peers, in his passion for betting on
horse races and "football," bet
ting outside the permitted forums
of the newspaper pool or the race
course, evolved their own com
plex cash-flow system, a system
which broke their country's laws,
but which nevertheless rarely in

volved criminals: "It symbolized
a certain sense of class indepen
dence, but above all the creation
of a social space outside of the
powerful and rich."
Whereas the history of the
middle class can be written as the
history of the self-made private
individual (along the lines of
Horatio Alger), labor history can
only be the history of a self-made
class, a class that has made its way
through the world by means of a
solidarity based on the painfully
acquired knowledge that
"workers must help each other
against 'them.' "
This is not to say, however, that
readers of this book don't make
the acquaintance of some very at
tractive individuals. In fact, the
revolutionary potential of
Hobsbawm's labor history lies
partly in its granting of speech to
hitherto silenced voices. My fa
vorite workers were the Italian
parents who, in the early part of
this century, inspired by the
militant irreligion that was part
and parcel of their socialism,
refused to baptize their children
with the customary saints' names,
but instead called them
"Spartacus," "Galileo" and
"Walt Whitman." Hobsbawm
also introduces us to the miner
Herbert Smith, who, even after
attaining the presidency of the
British Miners' Federation and
the mayoralty of Barnsley (in
northern England), stubbornly
continued to wear the flat peaked
cap that was for him the insignia
of his class identity.


Hobsbawm is frank enough to acknowledge that one reason for the in
creased interest in the history of labor movements might well be that
they seem to have ground to a halt.
