## 
### 
A Stanford alumna has been
named as the backup for Sharon
Crista McAuliffe, scheduled to be
the first teacher to go into space
aboard the space shuttle next Jan
uary.
Vice President George Bush
announced last week that Bar
bara Morgan, a 1973 Stanford
graduate, will serve as
McAuliffe's backup and will go
into space if McAuliffe, for any
reason, cannot. Morgan, who
teaches second graders in McCall,
Idaho, was one of 10 finalists se
lected from 114 competitors in
the NASA Teacher in Space

Project announced by President
Reagan a year ago.
Born in Fresno, Morgan
received her degree in human bi
ology from Stanford with distinc
tion in 1973 and her teaching
credentials from the College of
Notre Dame in Belmont a year
later.
Before assuming her present
position at McCall-Donnelly
Elementary School, she taught
English and science to third
graders in Quito, Ecuador, and
remedial reading and math to In
dian reservation children in Ar
lee, Mont.
