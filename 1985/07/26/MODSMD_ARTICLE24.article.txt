# Conference has designs

The 1985 Stanford Confer
ence on Design began yesterday
morning at Annenberg
Auditorium with what Confer
ence Director Beverly Smith
called "some of the biggest
names in design."
The conference is hosted by
the Stanford Alumni Associa
tion, with the assistance of
several prominent San Fran
cisco designers. According to
Smith, the design conference "is
one of the most important con
ferences on the West Coast."
Unlike many design confer
ences, the Stanford meeting
imposes no theme on the
speakers. The topics range from
computer graphics to architec
ture to parachute aircraft
vehicles. The connection be
tween these, Smith said, is "the
process of design — how you
reach a solution as a designer."
"The history of the confer
ence is not to have a theme and
give each speaker as much
freedom as possible," said
Bruce Burdick, an industrial en
gineer with the Burdick Group
in San Francisco and a member
of the executive committee for
the conference.

In all, there will be 15
speakers and 200 to 300 con
ferees, "mostly professional
designers," according to Smith.
To attend, one has to apply
beforehand. The conference
fees amount to $350.
One of the more spectacular
topics of the conference will be
Stephen Snyder's paraplane,
which advertisements for the
conference describe as "a state
of-the-art power parachute
aircraft vehicle, enabling most
anyone who has a desire to fly
to accomplish that goal." His
aircraft is seen as a
breakthrough in aeronautical
design.
James Stockton, graphic
designer for James Stockton &
Associates in San Francisco and
a member of the executive com
mittee, said the conference has
traditionally presented topics in
aeronautical design. "We had
the Gossamer Condor people
here twice," he said, adding that
Snyder's paraplane is
"innovative and creative" and
addresses the questions of
"economic feasibility and
problem-solving."
Snyder originally was going
to fly his paraplane into the
Oval today at 8:30 a.m., but
due to complications with insur

ance, the flight was canceled.
Instead, Snyder will display his
vehicle and demonstrate that he
can build it in 15 minutes. A
brief reception will then be held
on the grass, after which Snyder
will speak at Annenberg
Auditorium.
The other speakers include
Marshall Arisman, best known
for Frozen Images, a book of
drawings influenced by
photojournalism; Deborah Suss
man and Paul Prezja, who to
gether developed the look of
the 1984 Olympic Games in
Los Angeles; Barbara Nessim, a
noted teacher, painter, curator
and writer whose primary focus
is computer-aided graphics; and
Hugh Newell Jacobsen, an ar
chitect whose buildings have
earned over 80 awards for
design.
"We have a sensational line
of speakers, perhaps the best
we've ever had," Stockton said
yesterday in his welcoming ad
dress at Annenberg Audi
torium. "
Smith said that the confer
ence will last for "three very
long days." In addition, an ex
hibition by the 1985 American
Institute for Graphic Arts will
be on display at Annenberg and
open to the public.
