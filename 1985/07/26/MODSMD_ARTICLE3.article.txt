# Release set for Sept. 8
## Streleski: I want prison 
### REBECCA ZEIGLER Staff writer 
Theodore Streleski, convicted in 1978 of mur
dering Stanford Mathematics Prof. Karel de-
Leeuw, told the Times Tribune of Palo Alto
Tuesday that he does not want to be released
from prison Sept. 8, his scheduled discharge date.
Streleski fears that he will be harassed by law
enforcement officials if he is released in Septem
ber, he told the Times Tribune from Vacaville,
where he is serving his prison sentence. The
former Stanford student said he is petitioning
state correctional officials and law enforcement
agencies to stay in prison until Aug. 19, 1986.
State authorities at the California Medical
Facility (CMF) in Vacaville view the discharge of
Streleski as no different from that of any other
prisoner in their custody.
"To our knowledge, his discharge date is set
for Sept. 8," said Bill Hartwell, correctional
counselor at the CMF in Vacaville. "Unless
something comes up before that, we will dis
charge him at that time, and he (Streleski) will go
from being a prisoner to being a civilian."
Streleski, who had been working on a doc
toral degree in mathematics at Stanford for 19
years, was convicted in 1978 of beating de Leeuw
to death with a hammer in his Math Department
office. The graduate student was convicted of
second degree murder and sentenced to eight
years in a state facility.
"What Stanford did to 19 years of my life and
what I saw them do to other students was enough
to justify murder," Streleski told the Times
Tribune. He added that under comparable cir
cumstances he would commit the crime again.
Streleski has been offered parole three times in
the last 18 months due to good behavior, but on
all three occasions he refused, citing parole re
strictions that would have forced him to live in
Orange County under close supervision of parole
officers.
"He (Streleski) interprets the penal code in his
own fashion, and I'm not going to debate that
with him," said Hartwell, who has spoken with
Streleski during his stay at Vacaville. "Unless our

attorneys find a legal reason for his continued
stay, we will release him at the time.
"After that date, we no longer have any con
trol over him. He'll be on his own. He's entitled
to the same release money as any parolee,"
Hartwell continued.
Stanford Police Capt. Marvin Moore, who was
unavailable for comment yesterday, told the
Times-Tribune Tuesday that University officials
