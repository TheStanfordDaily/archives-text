# STOP attempts to halt Playboy
## 
### BRIDGET HYLAK 
Lack of summer support isn't
slowing STOP (Stanford Students
Opposed to Pornography.
Though a Wednesday night
meeting organized by STOP
member Vanessa Poster attracted
only the press, Poster said STOP
is continuing its efforts to increase
community awareness about the
"exploitation" of pornography.
Poster is STOP's representative
on a five-member committee or
ganized last May by the Tresidder
Union Board to submit recom
mendations to the board, to de
termine guidelines for product
removal and to answer questions
such as, "Who determines what is
pornography?" and "How many
people must protest to legitimize
product removal?"
The committee has met four
times this summer and has formu
lated a set of four product selec

tion guidelines through which
retail outlets in Tresidder may
take action. Such action ranges
from providing customers with
product information to removing
a product completely.
Though not yet approved,
these guidelines appear to pro
vide STOP with a stepping stone
from which it can pursue its initial
request to Tresidder to remove
pornography from The Store in
Tresidder. The Store is the only
retail location on campus selling
Playboy.
The committee will also submit
a recommendation that each copy
of Playboy's "Girls of the Pac
-10" (Pacific 10 Conference) issue
be sold by The Store in a sealed
manila envelope to which a flier
would be attached. The flier
would address STOP's position
