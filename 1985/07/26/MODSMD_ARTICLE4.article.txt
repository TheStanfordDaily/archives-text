# STOP attempts to halt Playboy

### BRIDGET HYLAK 
Lack of summer support isn't
slowing STOP (Stanford Students
Opposed to Pornography.
Though a Wednesday night
meeting organized by STOP
member Vanessa Poster attracted
only the press, Poster said STOP
is continuing its efforts to increase
community awareness about the
"exploitation" of pornography.
Poster is STOP's representative
on a five-member committee or
ganized last May by the Tresidder
Union Board to submit recom
mendations to the board, to de
termine guidelines for product
removal and to answer questions
such as, "Who determines what is
pornography?" and "How many
people must protest to legitimize
product removal?"
The committee has met four
times this summer and has formu
lated a set of four product selec

tion guidelines through which
retail outlets in Tresidder may
take action. Such action ranges
from providing customers with
product information to removing
a product completely.
Though not yet approved,
these guidelines appear to pro
vide STOP with a stepping stone
from which it can pursue its initial
request to Tresidder to remove
pornography from The Store in
Tresidder. The Store is the only
retail location on campus selling
Playboy.
The committee will also submit
a recommendation that each copy
of Playboy's "Girls of the Pac
-10" (Pacific 10 Conference) issue
be sold by The Store in a sealed
manila envelope to which a flier
would be attached. The flier
would address STOP's position
on the implications and exploita
tion of pornography.
"The flier will serve as an edu
cational tool for people to think
about the implications of pornog
raphy, and what they're paying

for when they buy the magazine."
Poster stressed that the flier is an
"educational process, not censor
ship."
Last April's announcement of
Playboy's intent to come to
campus to interview prospects for
its October "Girls of the Pac-10"
issue led to the formation of
STOP.

STOP protests last spring in
cluded a rally in White Plaza, a
forum and picketing in front of
the Palo Alto Holiday Inn, where
Playboy staff members were
staying.
During these protests, STOP
supporters asked The Store not to
sell pornography. The Store
responded by removing Playboy

from its racks, but the magazine
was soon after returned to the
racks when higher Tresidder
management emphasized the im
portance of customer choice in its
services.
"At that point," Poster said, "I
submitted a proposal to Tresidder
to stop selling pornography in
The Store."

Poster's proposal was reviewed
at the May 15 meeting of the
Tresidder Board, at which time
the committee, comprised of four
Tresidder representatives and
Poster, was formed.
"If Tresidder takes no action,"
Poster said, "there will be a
boycott of The Store, or maybe of
Tresidder in general."
