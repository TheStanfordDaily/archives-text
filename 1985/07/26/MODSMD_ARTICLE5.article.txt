### 
A former secretary in the Stan
ford Psychology Department who
pleaded guilty in May to charges
of forgery, grand theft and em
bezzlement has been sentenced to
one year in prison.
The Santa Clara County Super
ior Court sentenced Laurie Ann
Landis to a year in the county jail
beginning Aug. 26. In addition,
Landis will be on probation for
three years and will be required
to make full restitution to the
University.
Landis was arrested in Half
Moon Bay April 30 after a Psy

chology Department internal
audit revealed irregularities total
ing nearly $6,000 in petty cash
transactions over the past year.
She was sentenced July 15.
"The sentence reinforces our
commitment to the system of in
ternal controls, which is based
upon employee integrity," said
Peter Millington, director of
Stanford's Internal Audit Depart
ment.
"This should serve to reinforce
the value system that the vast
majority of Stanford employees
follow in their daily conduct of
business," Millington added.
The audit began after Landis,
an ex-convict, intercepted a
royalty check intended for Prof.
Richard Thompson, forged his
signature and cashed the check.
Numerous phony receipts also
were submitted in the names of
several researchers over a period
of about 14 months.
The actual amount of restitu
tion to Stanford has not been es
tablished yet.
