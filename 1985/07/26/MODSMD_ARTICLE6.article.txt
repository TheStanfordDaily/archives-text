## Hudson's AIDS may dispel myths 
### 
NEW YORK â€” The news that actor
Rock Hudson has AIDS is regrettable, but
it may promote a greater public awareness
that could dispel myths and encourage dis
cussion of the disease, spokesmen for
groups involved with the illness said yester
day.
"People know of the disease, but they
don't know about the disease," said Ron
Najman of the National Gay Task Force.
Much as President Reagan's colon cancer
focused attention on that disease, Hud
son's case will probably bring more atten
tion to AIDS, and "we're hoping the
awareness will focus on the facts," he said.
If Hudson has the disease, said Richard
Dunne, executive director of the Gay
Men's Health Crisis, he could encourage
public discussion of AIDS by talking about
it openly, as Betty Ford did with breast
cancer.
But in terms of federal funding for AIDS
research, said spokeswoman Shirley Barth
at the U.S. Public Health Service, the news
should not lead to more money. "We're
doing everything we can," she said. "It
would be unfortunate if our government
was run to respond to something like that."
AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, had struck 11,871 Americans as

of yesterday, and killed half of them, ac
cording to the federal Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta. Seventy-three percent
of victims are gay or bisexual men, 17 per
cent are intravenous drug users, 1 percent
are hemophiliacs, and others fall into other

categories, according to the CDC.
The disease is spread by sexual contact,
by the sharing of contaminated needles and
the transfusion of blood or blood products.
Public fear and confusion over how the
disease spreads is one thing that might be

cleared up if the news about Hudson puts
the public spotlight on the disease, Najman
said.
Some anti-gay groups around the
country have used fear of AIDS to say that
gay people shouldn't be allowed to teach or
handle food, he said. "That's an assault on
people's constitutional rights without any
medical foundation whatsoever," he said.
Unfounded discrimination against
people with AIDS may "drive the disease
underground," discouraging some victims
from participating in research, he said.
Dunne said news like that about Hudson
will "have an even greater impact if some
one well known to the public would be
willing to sit down and talk about it
(publicly)."
AIDS is linked in the public mind to
homosexuals and drug users, the primary
risk groups, but "there's nothing inherent
in homosexuality or drug use that leads to
AIDS," he said. Heterosexual contact can
spread the AIDS virus just as homosexual
contact can, he said.
Given public ignorance about the
disease, "I think the Rock Hudson thing
could act as a catalyst" to spur public edu
cation programs by local, state and federal
authorities, he said.

"Mr. Hudson has AIDS," Yanou Collart, Paris spokeswoman for actor Rock Hudson,
told the press late yesterday afternoon. Collart said her statement earlier yesterday about
the 59-year-old actor being "cured" of the disease was "a misinterpretation."
