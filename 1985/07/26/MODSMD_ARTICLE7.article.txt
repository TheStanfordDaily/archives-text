South Africa violence continues
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Police said yesterday
they killed four blacks and wounded 16 in a riot east of Johan
nesburg. Unofficial reports said they opened fire when mourners
in a crowd of 4,000 threw stones after a funeral for riot victims.
A 16-year-old girl was reported among those killed in the
black township of Daveyton, and her grandmother was quoted as
saying it was the first such funeral the girl had attended.
Officially reported detentions in the first five days of this
white-ruled nation's state of emergency rose to 792. A spokes
man for the Detainees Parents Support Committee said informa
tion gathered from various communities indicated "many more"
were being held.
Unofficial sources said scores of teenagers were rounded up
yesterday morning in Alexandra, on the edge of Johannesburg.
Police said they could not immediately comment on the report,
but witnesses said they saw an unusually heavy presence of
police, soldiers and armored cars in the black township.
Reports from national police headquarters continued to show
a decline in the violence that began 11 months ago over black op
position to apartheid. Nearly 500 blacks have perished in the
months of riots, student and worker strikes, consumer boycotts
and protest meetings in black communities. At least 14 have died
since the emergency took effect Sunday.
Most victims were killed by police, but an increasing number
are black local officials and police slain by other blacks who see
them as willing tools of the white rulers.
Reporters for Western news organizations who went to
Daveyton, 25 miles east of Johannesburg, yesterday said police
threatened them with detention if they did not leave. Under
emergency regulations, police can bar certain categories of
people from entering a township, impose curfews and exercise
wide powers of arrest without warrants.
White business executives said yesterday that France's ban on
new investment in South Africa would not have a significant ef
fect on the economy, but would hurt France's interests and
reduce the job market for blacks.
France announced the investment ban and recalled its ambas
sador Wednesday to protest the state of emergency and
"increasing repression" of blacks. It asked the U.N. Security
Council to condemn South Africa and impose economic sanc
tions.
Bombing suspects may be executed
BEIRUT, Lebanon — A Lebanese military investigator yes
terday referred the case of the 1983 U.S. Embassy bombing in
which 63 people died to a military court and recommended the
death penalty for four suspects if convicted.
The investigator, who requested anonymity in compliance with
military regulations, identified the four, currently in detention, as
Lebanese Hussein SaleL Harb, 40, and Mahmoud Moussa
Dairaki, 42; Palestinian Mohammed Nayef Jadaa, 54; and Egyp
tian Sami Mahmoud al-Hujji, 47.
He also recommended death sentences for Harb and al-Hujji
as suspects in the car bombing of the Iraqi Embassy in West
Beirut on Jan. 15, 1981. That bombing left 48 people dead and
90 wounded.
The investigator said the four suspects were detained by
Lebanese authorities shortly after April 18, 1983, the day a
bomb-laden pickup truck exploded at the U.S. Embassy's en
trance in mostly Moslem West Beirut.
The explosion killed 63 people, including 17 Americans, and
injured 112 others, according to police.
Death penalty hurts Ng extradition
TORONTO — The capture of a California man sought
in the probe of a grisly multiple murder case has focused
attention on a 1976 extradition treaty giving Canada the right to
refuse to return a prisoner to the United States if he would face
the death penalty.
"Sheer madness! That's what it is," the tabloid Toronto Sun
said in a recent editorial.
"It's unthinkable that a fugitive suspected of grotesque killings
in the U.S. would be allowed to stay here because our politicians
felt years ago that they couldn't stomach the death penalty
anywhere," the Sun said. "Let's get rid of Charles Ng. Right
now."
Ng, 24, was captured in Calgary, Alberta, this month after an
extensive search. He has been named in a California warrant on
two counts of murder, and prosecutors are examining evidence
they say could link him to the other deaths, including people
whose bodies 6r scattered remains were found in a survivalist's
compound in Calaveras County.
After first reports that a request to extradite Ng might be
denied, letters of protest poured into the office of Justice Mini
ster John Crosbie and to Canadian newspapers.
At the initiative of then-Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, the
death penalty was abolished in Canada in 1976, even though
public opinion polls have showed a majority of Canadians in fa
vor of bringing back the noose — the method always used for ex
ecuting criminals in this country.
So far, California has not even requested extradition of Ng,
who faces attempted murder, theft and weapons charges in
Canada. The Canadian criminal cases apparently are going to be
dealt with first. The cases are expected to take several months —
if not years.
