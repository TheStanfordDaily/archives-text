Tax plan may cost billions
WASHINGTON — Congressional budget
analysts said yesterday that President Reagan's
tax plan would cost $13.5 billion more over five
years than estimated by the Treasury, and the ad
ministration said it would "move quickly to
assure revenue neutrality with further proposals
as necessary."
In a joint statement, top congressional tax
writers and Treasury Secretary James Baker said
the new findings amount to a five-year shortfall
of "less than 1 percent of the total revenue col
lected" but added that they were "concerned by
its possible perceptual impact on the drive for tax
reform."
The congressional Joint Committee on Taxa
tion staff found that the president's plan would

cost the Treasury $25.1 billion in lost revenue
over five years. The Treasury had estimated a
shortfall of $11.6 billion.
The statement, also signed by Rep. Dan Ros
tenkowski (D-Ill.) and Sen. Robert Packwood
(R-Ore.), the chairmen of the two tax-writing
committees, said that they wanted "to reaffirm
that revenue neutrality remains a firm underpin
ning of tax reform."
"We agree that revenue neutrality is by no
means out of reach and recognize that no markup
will begin in the Ways and Means Committee
without a proposal from the administration that is
revenue-neutral," the statement said.
The term "revenue-neutral" means that under
the new tax plan, the Treasury would receive the
same net amount of tax revenue as under the cur
rent system Reagan is striving to reform.
