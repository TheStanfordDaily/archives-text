Killer bees may be at large
SACRAMENTO — Officials searching more
than 400 square miles for fugitives from the first
U.S. "killer bee" colony said yesterday that they
believe at least two swarms of the dreaded insects
may be at large.
State Agriculture Director Clare Berryhill told
The Associated Press that "we're pretty well con
vinced that we have two queens and their
colonies out there and possibly more."
Berryhill said scientists believe a new
reproductive queen bee, as well as the original
queen, left the colony in rural Kern County be
cause no queens and few bees were found during

excavation of the original burrow, which was cov
ered with asphalt and doused with pesticide.
He said authorities hope to prevent the spread
of the bees, which have been depicted in disaster
movies, by expanding their search.
Officials also are halting transportation of bee
colonies in the area to protect other regions.
Berryhill, deluged with inquiries from through
out the nation, told reporters at a hastily-called
news conference earlier that 20 government in
sect specialists, using airplanes to spot nearby bee
colonies, have found no indications of African
bees so far in commercial bee hives in the area.
Authorities believe the bees may have entered
the country on oil equipment.
