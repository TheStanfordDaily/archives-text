# Dreams of Japan, Take 1
## 
### 
Insert a dream sequence here, lots of flashy special
effects, thigh, what you would expect from a trans-
Pacific flight-type fantasy. Include the protagonist, a
distracting sea of body parts, thinking about the
column he's supposed to write for next Tuesday, ex
cept that he can't write it for next Tuesday, because
he will be more than 7,000 miles from the nearest
Daily bureau.
But is he worried? Him? No. He takes a bite from
a proffered leg and mentally composes the next
column, one which he will title "Cannibalism In
Japan" in the true style of gonzo journalism, some
kind of savage look at the American dream in Japan.
Or something like that. I was standing on this sta
tion platform 14 years ago, waiting for the same ex
act train. And all I can recall now is that then they
put sugar in the milk, and they made you squat over
a porcelain hole in the ground. So my first
memorable impression of Japan was that of a
country which was slightly backward and vaguely
decadent. But now, I . . .
Who, me? I'm just some American accompanying
his cousin to her piano lesson. I'm got my Kodak
camera with my Fuji film, and I'm dying for a
McDonald's hamburger made with authentic
Australian beef. I fidget with the camera; I don't
know why I brought it along, since it's raining and
impossible to get any good shots.
I focus on the billboard on the other side of the
tracks, which exhorts, "BUY AMERICAN . . .
sponsored by the Japanese Ministry of Trade."
Someone has thoughtfully scribbled, "Buy Ameri
can what?" underneath. I don't think that anyone
in this town believes that, apart from food, America
makes any sort of superior product.
So let the bigshots consider punitive trade sanc
tions to stop Japanese goods from entering
America; this will no doubt bolster the
townspeople's faith in the Power of the West. Or to
put it another way, you can't break a few eggs with
out making an omelet.
The train arrives on time. My cousin, a high
school junior, has been talking about visiting
America. Where would you like to visit? Canada.
What about Disneyland, Yosemite and Stanford?
Naw, too full of tourists.
The ride is smooth and the rain lets up as we dis
embark. Two of her friends are waiting on the plat
form; they attend the same lesson. She introduces
me, and they giggle. My Japanese is about seventh or
eighth grade level, and though it is without the typi
cal American accent, I lack a large vocabulary,
which slows my speech.
I know what they're thinking: For a foreigner, he
kinda talks like a human. I feel like a parakeet under

their indulgent smiles.
We walk through the town, on streets narrower
than those of downtown Palo Alto. Wet asphalt
smells the same in any country. Stores' wares spill
out into the street, and we jostle our way through the
shoppers. One other thing: I'm taller than three
fourths of the people around me. Striding proudly, I
follow the girls to an imposing house. My cousin
flips the latch on the gate, and we file through a
meticulously maintained rock garden. She slides
aside the front door and yells "Hello!" At no point
have any of us knocked.
After the lesson (anywhere in the world, they're
the same), we go out for dinner. It is dark, but the
girls seem to know their way around. In a blind al
ley, we enter a small ramen noodle eatery. I look at
the street signs: "Scold and praise children other
than your own" one admonishes; "Courtesy and eti
quette are the only rules of the road" reads another.

As I slurp the final noodle, panic! The eatery does
not provide napkins. One of my cousin's friends
glances at me and holds out a sympathetic handker
chief. "Hey, thanks." English blurts out of my
mouth, and they laugh.
We walk back to the station. And then it hits me.
Women (and indeed children) walk unescorted and
fearlessly through the night. People in middle-size
towns (though not in Tokyo) leave their doors un
locked. Signs teach morality. There's the town P.A.
system, which announces the time, weather and
local calendar.
Somewhere along the line, America (even
Sinclair Lewis' small-town America) lost all this.
Forget Hunter Thompson and the American
Dream; he forgot that without a foundation, the
Dream is irrelevant. Hazard a guess: Would you and
your friends swap the VCR and the health club
membership for that Japanese kind of peace of
mind?
For me, if they ever get around to putting in flush
toilets and providing napkins in restaurants, I'm
emigrating.
