Small cars stay out
The physics (Varian) parking
lot has recently been re-striped
so the center part is now marked
for compact cars and contains
appropriately smaller spaces than
the outside part. I am writing to
ask compact-car drivers to have
the courtesy to park in the
middle section and leave the
outside sections for us larger-car
drivers. Most days about half the
spaces for larger cars are taken
by small cars.

Balloon only for fun
The lead story in Campus
Report on June 19 said that
hundreds of graduates held bal
loons "to symbolize their support
for South African divestment."
Jim Naureckas pointed out in
The Daily (July 26) that a similar

story in The Stanford Observer
was wrong because it said that
we were "protesting South
African apartheid."
All of these are wrong in my
case. Like many other graduates I
have spoken to, I carried a black
balloon into Commencement with
no political purpose in mind.
Balloons are fun and graduation
is fun, so I thought it was nice of
someone to think of putting the
two together. No one told us
what the balloons supposedly
signified.
Although I support divestment
and would have chosen to carry a
balloon anyway, I'm sure that
there are others who carried
them who would not have. I
resent being improperly used as a
statistic to support any cause,
and hope that the next time I
protest I know it. I like having
balloons put in my hand, but not
words put into my mouth.
