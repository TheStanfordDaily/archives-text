# Crowd loves what Petty has to offer
## 
### PHIL CHEN 
The Concord Pavilion, a grass
and-concrete bowl located in the
hills east of Berkeley, was the site
Saturday night of performances
by a new band, Lone Justice, and
by a group that has been around
since 1975, Tom Petty and the
Heartbreakers.
Lone Justice is a Texas-based
country-rock outfit that has
been hyped into hyperspace by
Geffen Records as rock's Next
Great Breakthrough. With
promotion like that, I was not
surprised to find myself disap
pointed in the band. Maria
McKee can certainly sing; she had
a good range and was capable of
packing real emotional punch
into her delivery. However, I
didn't care much for her screechy
little-girl voice, which always
made her sound as if she were
throwing a tantrum.
Musically, the band sounded
like many other "cowpunk"

bands: basic rock beat overlaid
with Marlboro Country guitar
riffs. Guitarists Ryan Hedgecock
and Tony Gilkyson, bassist Mar
vin Etzioni and drummer Don
Heffington worked together to
form a competent, dull unit that
never explored beyond its own
very constrained musical limits.
Lone Justice ran through al
most every song on its current LP,
including the Petty-penned
"Ways To Be Wicked." Fortun
ately for the band, the crowd was
in a terrific mood and cheered
raucously after every song; even
so, Lone Justice declined to play
an encore when its set ended.
But the crowd, an older
looking bunch (definitely not
teeny-boppers), came to see Tom
Petty and his Heartbreakers, and
from the opening chords of
"American Girl 1 ' to the last
encore an hour and 40 minutes
later, he was clearly their rock 'n'
roll hero. Every word he uttered

and every song the group played
drew an awesome response from
the crowd. When asked
them, roughly a quarter of the
crowd indicated that they had
seen his show in Berkeley the
night before.
What made this concert partic
ularly fine was Petty's true ap
preciation of their adulation; he
didn't let his status go to his head,
but remained open and easy
going, even humorous at times.
This didn't mean he was unaware
of his control over his audience;
during a song, he would often
walk to the edge of the stage, his
arms spread wide in a "How am I
doing?" position that would im
mediately send the crowd into
new fits of adoration.
Meanwhile, the Heartbreakers
were acquitting themselves rea
sonably well, sounding very
practiced on the show's mix of
hits from the band's past and
from their latest record,
"Southern Accents." To break up
the sameness of the
Heartbreakers' music, Petty
played two verses from"The
Waiting" solo before the rest of
the band joined in. Petty has mas
tered the art of singing without
moving his lower jaw; this was
heard most easily on the slower
ballads.
"Don't Come Around Here No
More," the band's latest single,
was noteworthy for both its
bizarre, Alice-in-Wonderland
visual effects and the appearance
of Dave Stewart of the Euryth
mics on rhythm guitar. Stewart
was by far the most colorful per

son on stage in his red,
psychedelic-patterned jacket;
otherwise, he added little to the
song's performance, although he
did manage to ungracefully fall
off bassist Howie Epsteins moni
tor. He later joined the
Heartbreakers for their second
encore, again with no discernable
result.
Backing up the Heartbreakers
were three horn players, who
danced, moved and gestured in
unison to hilarious effect, and two
female background vocalists. All
five stood on platforms built

around the back wings of the
stage, which inexplicably had
been decorated to look like a
Greek temple, complete with
stone steps and tall columns.
Late in the concert, several
people at the front held up an
elaborate "We Love You TP"
banner to Petty, and he took it
and wrapped it around his
shoulders. It was symbolic of the
bond between Petty and his fans,
the success of Petty's return to his
Southern-rock roots and his abil
ity to translate both into a
rousing, heartfelt performance.


Ryan Hedgecock, Don Hefffington, Maria McKee, Tony Gilkyson and
Marvin Etzioni, members of Lone Justice, were greeted by some
"raucous" cheers when they opened Saturday's concert.
