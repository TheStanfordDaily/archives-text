# Count of Monte Cristo: riveting revenge
## 
### ELAINE WANG 
Swashbuckling and vengeful
ness highlight the Paul Masson
Vineyards stage in the Valley In
stitute of Theatre Arts' (VITA)
production of "The Count of
Monte Cristo," and this is the
best of the series.
The play is steeped in history
and romance: It is France, 1815,
and the country is in civil turmoil.
Into Marseilles sails a ship piloted
by Edmund Dantes, first mate.
Before the captain had died at
sea, he had entrusted Dantes to
stop at Elba and receive a packet
from the exiled Napoleon. His
duty performed, Dantes' only
desire is to marry his fiancee,
Mercedes, who is being wooed by
her cousin, Fernand.
Meanwhile, the ship's clerk,
Danglars, is also unhappy with
Dantes getting the ship's cap
taincy; he and Fernand plot to in
form the Royalist police about
Dantes' visit to Napoleon. They
write an anonymous letter to Vil
lefort, the king's prosecutor, who
promptly arrests Dantes and in
spects the packet. It contains a
letter from Napoleon to Nortier,
Villefort's father; since having a
traitor for a father would wreck
Villefort's career, he destroys the
letter and throws Dantes into the
desolate Chateau d'lf prison.
Dantes is imprisoned for 18
years until he escapes with the
help of Father Faria, who tells

him of a great treasure on the Isle
of Monte Cristo. In 1836, Dantes
returns to France as the Count of
Monte Cristo. By then, the men
who ruined him have reached
high offices and worthy positions
in society; they do not recognize
him. Mercedes has sadly con
sented to marry Fernand, wishing
to secure a future for her son
(who is really Dantes' child).
The rest of the story is of
revenge against those who
wronged Dantes and the reunion
with his beloved. Mercedes and
their son, Albert.
Except for the cumbersome
theatrical ploy of having "ghosts"
of the dead appear onstage
seemingly all the time, this pro
duction is riveting, especially with
John Hertzler in the title role. He
plays a strong, kind character
consumed by extreme passion —
on the one hand for the woman
he loves, and on the other for ven
geance for the wrongs against
him. Hertzler is never lukewarm
or halfway in his portrayal — he is
at once dignified and mercenary
when he signals to the'audience,
"One (down and two to go)." The
next minute he is struggling with
emotion at seeing Mercedes
(Taylor Young) again, his face
registering pain, anger and a cer
tain wistfulness.
The villains aren't too shabby,
either, being played by David
Maier (Danglars; a wonderful

Oberon in "Midsummer Night's
Dream") and Anthony Abate
(Fernand; Demetrius in
"Midsummer Night's Dream").
Both are vile, but Alexander
Dumas (the author) gave them
problems of their own — Fer
nand, for instance, is not to be
blamed for loving Mercedes and
wanting to take care of her and
her son. Abate manages to seem a

loving husband and father, even
though we find out about the
degenerate ways in which he has
gained his wealth.
Perhaps the most exciting part
of the VITA production is the
swordplay, choreographed by
director J. Steven White. The ac
tion is smooth, without the
momentary hesitation before the
blades touch — the actors go all

out, and the effect is exhilarating.
The stage, too, is small and close
to the audience, intensifying the
physicality of each confrontation.

at the Paul Masson Vineyard and
plays in repertory with "Two
Gentlemen of Verona" and
