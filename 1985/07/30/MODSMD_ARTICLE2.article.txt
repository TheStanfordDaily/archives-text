# Faculty suggestions rejected by Hoover
## 
### MARSH McCALL Editorial staff 
Hoover scholars last week
flatly rejected recommendations
from a Faculty Senate commit
tee that called for changes in the
governance of the Hoover Insti
tution.
In a report released July 19, 40
senior researchers at Hoover
denied the need to implement
suggestions, which included nine
specific changes. The recommen
dations were proposed by a Fac
ulty Senate committee headed by
Sociology Prof. Sanford
Dornbusch.
Included among the senate
committee's recommended
changes were suggestion's that
"standards, ranks and
procedures" of appointment
procedures be "clarified" and
that the "Hoover Foundation
and Hoover Board of Overseers
should assume only an advisory
role in the selection of the
Hoover director."
"The Dornbusch report contri
butes to the misrepresentation of
the Institution's mission," the
scholars said. "We find that some
(of the recommendations) have
already been in place for many
years, others are not necessary,
while others would violate long
standing agreements and con
tracts concerning governance be
tween Hoover and Stanford."
On June 6, the Faculty Senate
voted 29-1 to "enthusiastically
endorse" the Dornbusch report,
stating that "governance is the
key to reduction of ideological
concerns."
The Dornbusch report, con
cerned with "those aspects of the
relation between the Hoover In
stitution and the rest of the . . .
Stanford Professoriate," said that

"Hoover's pride in its political in
fluence . . . has sometimes been
so blatantly expressed as to stim
ulate antagonism on campus."
University President Donald
Kennedy, who has praised the
Dornbusch committee for "a very
conscientious, helpful job" in
reviewing relations between the
Hoover Institution and the Uni
versity, said yesterday that
Hoover's response "is a very use
ful contribution to the discussion
. . . exactly what ought to take
place in a University."
But Hoover scholars, following
an analysis conducted in what
Hoover director Glenn Campbell
described yesterday as "a careful
and objective fashion," found
that the Dornbusch report
"contributes to the mis
representation of the Institution's
mission," and rejected all recom
mendations made by the commit
tee.
"The Dornbusch Report
accuses Hoover of stimulating an
tagonism on campus," the
Hoover scholars said. "It is not,
and has not been, our purpose to
do so. If there is antagonism, is
the offense ours or that of those
presumably antagonized? It
seems to us that the Dornbusch
Report gives vent to old an
tagonisms and encourages new
ones."
English Prof. Bliss Carnochan,
a member of the Dornbusch com
mittee, told The Daily that the
committee was concerned
with improving relations between
Hoover and the University, not
with the division of power be
tween the two institutions.
