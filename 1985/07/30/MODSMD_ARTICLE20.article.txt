# Clapton plays to knee-slapping audience
## 
### RON CHRISLEY 
I've never been a big blues fan,
so I certainly had reservations
about attending Eric Clapton's
performance at the Concord
Pavilion last Wednesday.
While waiting for credentials, I
could hear from within the un
inspiring strains of Clapton's
warm-up act, Graham Parker and
The Shot. OK, OK, it wouldn't be
fair to slam them, since I didn't ac
tually see their performance. But
let's just say that it made the
hold-up at the gate a little easier
to bear knowing that I wouldn't
have to sit through the boredom
of a set of Graham Parker music.
I began to wonder what type of
show warms up its audience with
this.
By the time I finally got inside,
found my seat and looked
around, I was getting worried. All
around me were beer-guzzling,
knee-slapping yee-ha'ers, the
loudest of all sitting directly in
front of me, whistling my ears
out. Then the lights went down,
the crowd roared, and my neigh
bor whistled even louder. Eric. A
spotlight revealed a keyboardist
playing a modern-flavored
fanfare.
When this nicely textured solo
was quickly shattered by the
twangy strains of "Livin' on Tulsa
Time," I was downright scared.
The yee-ha'ers, the country
twang and the beer all served to

leave me, a poor rock-lover, dis
oriented and afraid. I was sure
that at any instant Willie Nelson
was going to step in from the
wings to make this my private,
Grand Ol' Opry nightmare.
But after the song ended, the
shock wore off, and the crowd's
enthusiasm infected me as well.
This was Eric Clapton, the man
whose stylish licks influenced
many of rock's guitar heroes. My
first instinct was to think some
thing like, "Gee, he sure sounds
like Dave Gilmour," but then I

realized that Gilmour sounds like
him.
Clapton's modest style was the
highlight of the show. Here was
the common man's guitarist, the
archetypal young lover laying
down blues lines on his beat-up
Fender despite his parents'
misunderstanding complaints.
When Clapton made his guitar
sing, half the audience was up
there with him, air-guitaring their
hearts out. Every solo that night
was a virtual study in the pen
tatonic blues scale.

True, Clapton pays a high price
for this blues communion
innovation. But his modesty and
longevity demand respect where
his lack of variation loses it.
"I Shot the Sheriff' demon
strated Clapton's pleasant vocal
delivery. Throughout the perfor
mance, his voice was simultane
ously smooth and raspy, which
added to the down-home emo
tional appeal of his music.
Clapton's modesty as "the
reluctant frontman" climaxed
when he permitted each of his
two female back-up vocalists to
take their turn at leading the
show. The audience was dis
oriented at first, as their guitar
idol stepped out of the spotlight
to allow an unknown, extroverted
country showgirl belt out the
blues. And her gaudy style mixed
poorly with her overwhelming in
tent on performing — she was
trying too hard. But her show
manship eventually won the
crowd over, and since Clapton
had introduced her, she must be
good.
The other back-up took a dif
ferent approach to her spot in the
show — a slow, sentimental ver
sion of The Beatles' "She Loves
You." This rendition, which
could have easily been sappy and
nightclubish, was surprisingly suc
cessful. Her vocals were soothing
where her counterpart's were
powerful and raunchy. Playing on

the irony of the love triangle
created when a woman sings "she
loves you," the piece was almost
moving.
Eric perpetuated this mood
when he returned to play
"Wonderful Tonight." Other
notable tunes included a
"Badge"/"Let It Rain" medley,
the Cream classic "White Room"
and "Cocaine," which had the au
dience dancing in the aisles.
Clapton's set also included
several songs from his latest al
bum, "Behind the Sun": "Same
Old Blues," "Tangled in Love"
and "She's Waiting." But con
spicuously absent were such clas
sics as "Lay Down Sally," "After
Midnight" and "Sunshine of
Your Love." Disappointing.
The closing song was perhaps
the only reason why Clapton
toured with a keyboardist —
"Layla." After being excited by
this winner, the audience called
Clapton back for an encore of
"Forever Man," from his latest
album, and "Further Down the
Road."
Even though Clapton had
nothing to say musically that
hasn't been said many times
before, his show was enjoyable
because of his humble demeanor
and sincerity. For the audience,
Clapton could do no wrong. They
came expecting to hear the
"Same Old Blues," and he gave it
to them.

first instinct was to think some
thing like, "Gee, he sure sounds
like Dave Gilmour," but then I

realized that Gilmour sounds like
him.
Clapton's modest style was the
highlight of the show. Here was
the common man's guitarist, the
archetypal young lover laying
down blues lines on his beat-up
Fender despite his parents'
misunderstanding complaints.
When Clapton made his guitar
sing, half the audience was up
there with him, air-guitaring their
hearts out. Every solo that night
was a virtual study in the pen
tatonic blues scale.

True, Clapton pays a high price
for this blues communion
innovation. But his modesty and
longevity demand respect where
his lack of variation loses it.
"I Shot the Sheriff' demon
strated Clapton's pleasant vocal
delivery. Throughout the perfor
mance, his voice was simultane
ously smooth and raspy, which
added to the down-home emo
tional appeal of his music.
Clapton's modesty as "the
reluctant frontman" climaxed
when he permitted each of his
two female back-up vocalists to
take their turn at leading the
show. The audience was dis
oriented at first, as their guitar
idol stepped out of the spotlight
to allow an unknown, extroverted
country showgirl belt out the
blues. And her gaudy style mixed
poorly with her overwhelming in
tent on performing — she was
trying too hard. But her show
manship eventually won the
crowd over, and since Clapton
had introduced her, she must be
good.
The other back-up took a dif
ferent approach to her spot in the
show — a slow, sentimental ver
sion of The Beatles' "She Loves
You." This rendition, which
could have easily been sappy and
nightclubish, was surprisingly suc
cessful. Her vocals were soothing
where her counterpart's were
powerful and raunchy. Playing on

the irony of the love triangle
created when a woman sings "she
loves you," the piece was almost
moving.
Eric perpetuated this mood
when he returned to play
"Wonderful Tonight." Other
notable tunes included a
"Badge"/"Let It Rain" medley,
the Cream classic "White Room"
and "Cocaine," which had the au
dience dancing in the aisles.
Clapton's set also included
several songs from his latest al
bum, "Behind the Sun": "Same
Old Blues," "Tangled in Love"
and "She's Waiting." But con
spicuously absent were such clas
sics as "Lay Down Sally," "After
Midnight" and "Sunshine of
Your Love." Disappointing.
The closing song was perhaps
the only reason why Clapton
toured with a keyboardist —
"Layla." After being excited by
this winner, the audience called
Clapton back for an encore of
"Forever Man," from his latest
album, and "Further Down the
Road."
Even though Clapton had
nothing to say musically that
hasn't been said many times
before, his show was enjoyable
because of his humble demeanor
and sincerity. For the audience,
Clapton could do no wrong. They
came expecting to hear the
"Same Old Blues," and he gave it
to them.
