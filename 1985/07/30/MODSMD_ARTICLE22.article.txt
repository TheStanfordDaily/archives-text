## Shuttle problems affect Stanford

The shuttle Challenger lost
power in one of its three main
engines minutes after blasting off
yesterday from Cape Canaveral,
Ha., but the ship safely reached a
lower-than-expected orbit, and
NASA said it hoped to carry out a
full week-long science mission.
" The crew is doing fine, and we
are optimistic about achieving all
of the goals of the mission,"
shuttle director Jesse Moore told
a briefing an hour after launch,
when NASA was assured that
America's 50th manned
spaceflight was on track.
To help the 100-ton spaceplane
reach orbit, the two other main
engines burned 86 seconds longer
than normal and the astronauts
turned on two orbital manuever
ing engines.
This use of Orbital Maneuver
ing System fuel took away some
OMS fuel needed for some of the
science experiments, and Moore
said, "We're looking at allocating
the fuel to give science as much as
we can."
The lower altitude also meant
some of the science experiments

might not be carried out.
Bryan Gilcrist, a spokesman for
SUNSTAR (Stanford University
Network for Space Telescience
Applications Research), said last
night that it would be difficult to
predict the final orbit of the
shuttle, but indicated that the
"present orbit may be the final
one."
In response to questions con
cerning the fate of University
originated experiments on board
Challenger, Gilcrist said that
"various replanning efforts" were
being made.
"The experiments will still be
carried out to the greatest extent
possible," Gilcrist said. "The full
impact of the new orbit won't be
known until Friday. But while
many aspects (of the experi
ments) will be reduced, some may
even be improved. It's difficult to
say how bad the damage is."
It was the first time in the his
tory of the shuttle program such a
serious problem had developed
after liftoff, but NASA empha
sized there was no danger to the
seven-man crew or the $1.2 bil
lion orbiter.
