# Bikers cross America to feed Africa

They've faced dehydration, rat
tlesnakes and cold cans of Spaghetti-O's.
They're spending their summer visiting
places like Brush, Colo., and Washington,
D.C. Today, senior Pete Haven and
Aaron Persky, a 1985 graduate, receive
the Red Cross, er, red carpet treatment in
Chicago.
Haven and Persky, in conjunction with
the American Red Cross, are hiking
across the United States to raise money
for the American Red Cross Famine
Relief Campaign. Sunday evening, Haven
provided an update on the 3,000 mile trip
from a phone booth outside a corner
drugstore in Mendota, 111.
Haven and Persky, along with 1984
graduate Eric Wolfe, set off from White
Plaza June 24 and plan to arrive in Wash
ington Aug. 1 1 â€” three days ahead of
schedule.
But despite their speed, things have not
always gone smoothly. "Three days into
the trip, Aaron had to be rushed off to the
UC-Davis Medical Center," Haven said.
He was was treated for dehydration and
nausea before hitching a ride to catch up
with his friends.
Then, on a still, 100-degree morning
near Elko, Nev., Wolfe had to give up the
trek.
"He'd been wobbling on his bicycle,"
Haven said, and then "he said he couldn't
go on." Wolfe is now home in Indiana

and may rejoin the other two as they ride
through the state on their way to Wash
ington.
And one evening, as the remaining two
were hiking out of Wendover. Nev.,
Haven nearly rode over a rattlesnake.
The snake was lying on the shoulder of
the road, and Haven said he nearly rode
by without noticing it. But as he rode by,
the snake coiled and began rattling.
Haven managed to alert Persky, riding
behind him, and no injuries occurred.

Now the two are traveling about 80 to
90 miles each day, each carrying a 74-
pound load of gear.
Although the pair has spent $1,000
apiece of their own money on the trip,
Haven said they have raised around
$3,000 so far for Africa. However, he in
dicated that it is difficult to estimate ex
actly how much they have raised since
people send their checks directly to local
Red Cross chapters.
And when they eat, they eat a lot. "The

appetites just soar" after a day of biking,
according to Haven, who said his normal
breakfast consists of an entire box of
cereal and one quart of milk. "We eat
anything at all we can get our hands on."
The students have been receiving lots
of attention on their trip. "We've been
amazed at how friendly people have
been," Haven said.
From Reno, Nev., to Galesburg, 111.,
the two have told their story repeatedly to
anyone who will listen and to more than a
few newspapers, radio stations and televi
sion camera crews.
They were interviewed by three televi
sion stations and two newspapers in Den
ver. In Nebraska, where, according to
Haven, "all they think about is football
and cattle raising," they were greeted by
the mayor of Lincoln and the state attor
ney general.
When the trip concludes, Persky plans
to stay in Washington to look for a job.
Haven says he will visit relatives on the
East Coast before returning to his home
in Temecula to rest up for his senior year.
And how will this trip alter his outlook
on Stanford? "It will help me relax a little
bit," he said. When time gets tight and
the tests start coming in rapid succession,
"It will help me think about things and
put them in perspective," he added.
