# SOS A tries sit-in at Kennedy's office
## Police disperse protesters 
### MARK ZEIGLER Editorial staff 
A Stanford Out of South Africa protest
that began in White Plaza Friday afternoon
ended on the doorstep of the President's
Office three hours later when police
prevented protesters from entering the
building and staging a sit-in.
A portion of the crowd that gathered at
the noontime rally in White Plaza marched
to President's Donald Kennedy's office
carrying a black coffin that SOSA mem
bers said signified murdered South
Africans in the recent state of emergency
in that country.
The protesters were met outside the of
fice door in the Inner Quadrangle by two
policemen and Marlene Wine, special as
sistant to Kennedy. Kennedy was not on
campus at the time.
Amid loud chanting and singing, the
group said it wanted to bring the coffin into
Kennedy's office and sit silently there.
After some deliberation, Wine emerged
with a statement saying that only people
with appointments are allowed to enter the
President's Office.
At least four of the protesters conse
quently requested to make appointments
with Kennedy, including three students —
Caroline Paul, David Magnus and Mario

Huerta —'who were found guilty last
month for a sit-in at the Bursar's office.
Graduate student Mwesiga Baregu, who
spoke earlier at the rally, also asked for an
appointment.
"The fact that in the summer we could
gather such a large crowd is a message to
President Kennedy that we are undaunted
in our efforts," SOSA member David
Romo said last night. "We won't rest until
freedom comes to the South African
people."
Romo would not say if or when SOSA
will stage another protest this summer.
"It's best to keep the University guessing
what our next step will be," he said.
Wine said the President's Office was
aware of the SOSA rally because office
personnel had seen a flier announcing it.
Although the flier did not announce the
march to Kennedy's office, Wine said she
was not surprised when the protesters
arrived there in the early afternoon.
"It seemed as though there were about
30 protesters that came initially," Wine
said. "But in the course of the dialogue,
which lasted about 20 minutes, most of
them left."
Wine added that "as far as I know" Ken-
