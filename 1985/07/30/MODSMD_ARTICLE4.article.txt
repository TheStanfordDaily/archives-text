# Donor gives $5 million
## GSB to get new building 
### REBECCA ZEIGLER Staff writer 
A generous stock donation
from alumnus Edmund Littlefield
has enabled the Graduate School
of Business to begin fundraising
for a new $16 million classroom
and office building.
The stock, which the San Fran
cisco business executive will
donate over a period of several
years, is expected to accrue $5
million for the building project.
The Edmund W. Littlefield
Center, to be built adjacent to the
business school's existing four
story headquarters, is scheduled
to open in December 1987. Con
struction will begin in March
1986.
Additional gifts of $500,000
from both Lockheed Corp. and
the Ford Motor Co. and

$250,000 from Conoco Inc. will
help finance the project.
"Fundraising from a combination
of corporation, foundation and
individual gifts is in process now,"
said Paul Johnson, associate dean
of administration for the business
school.
"The gift from Mr. Littlefield,
along with those from Ford,
Lockheed and Conoco, are tre
mendous expressions of support
for and confidence in the school
and its mission," added Robert
Jaedicke, dean of the school of
business. "These gifts will pro
vide the momentum we need to
spark our fund-raising efforts for
the building."
Edmund Littlefield has
financially supported Stanford
over the years. In 1973 he
endowed the Edmund W. Lit

tlefield Professorship, currently
held by Accounting Prof. Charles
Horngren.
Littlefield currently chairs the
executive committee of Utah In
ternational, Inc., a San Francisco
based worldwide resources and
mining company. He received his
bachelor's degree from Stanford
in 1936 and his MBA from the
business school in 1938.
The new multi-million dollar
project is in response to a severe
need for office and expansion
space in the existing business
school building.
"In 1981 we started looking in
terms of space we had and needed
for the next decade or two,"
Johnson said. "We were some

candidates and the Career Plan
ning and Placement Office.
When remodeling proved in
adequate, the business school
hired architect William Pedersen
of Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates
to plan a possible new facility.
The architectural design of the
new building will visually link
it with the existing building, so
that the two can function as one

unit. It will allow for greater
teaching flexibility and accomo
date expansion in new areas, in
cluding microcomputers.
The ground floor of the new
facility will hold three seminar
rooms, two 45-person capacity
classrooms and some flexible
meeting space for use by a variety
of groups, including the Stanford
Board of Trustees. A sub

basement floor will be used by the
provost's office and will house
mechanical equipment.
Office space for 100 tenured
faculty and for their support staff
will comprise the second and
third floors of the complex. Red
tiled roofing, Stanford's architec
tural trademark, will top the new
building.
