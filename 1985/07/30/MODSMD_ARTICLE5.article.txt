### 
JOHANNESBURG, South
Africa — Bishop Desmond
Tutu yesterday requested an
urgent meeting with President
Pieter Botha to try to defuse
nearly a year of black rioting in
which nearly 500 blacks have
perished, but Botha refused.
Botha's office blamed a
"tight schedule" and spoke of
a possible meeting in three
weeks.
"I have tried, and I have
failed," said the Anglican bis
hop of Johannesburg after
Botha rebuffed the rare ap
proach by a recognized black
leader for talks on the crisis.
"I am very sad that the state
president, who should be
above politics, seems to be in
terested in political point
scoring," Tutu, winner of the
1984 Nobel Peace Prize, told
reporters at his Soweto home.
"Our country is in a desperate
situation, and I was seeking to
make myself available to assist
in seeking a possible way out of
the morass."
Botha meanwhile threat
ened to send home
hundreds of thousands of
foreign black workers if the
United Nations Security Coun
cil continued to consider im
posing economic sanctions
against South Africa, the
government-run radio said.
The Security Council on
Friday passed a resolution call
ing for worldwide voluntary

economic sanctions to pressure
South Africa to dismantle
apartheid, the white-minority
government's racial discrimi
nation policies.
Botha, speaking to a youth
group at Potchefstroom, near
Johannesburg, said he asked
officials to survey all of the es
timated 1.5 million foreign
workers in the country for pos
sible expulsion, according to
the broadcast.
The radio said Botha told
the youth group that "he
would not allow South Africa
to be trampled on, and he
pointed out that the country
had never used its full military
potential" to combat "the ter
rorist onslaught."
