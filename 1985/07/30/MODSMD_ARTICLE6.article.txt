# U.S. invites Soviets to monitor nuke blast
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administration
yesterday rejected a Soviet proposal for a halt in nu
clear weapons testing, but issued an unprecedented
invitation to Moscow to send experts to Nevada to
monitor an underground nuclear explosion.
The extraordinary offers came in the midst of a
recess in the stalemated nuclear arms control talks
in Geneva and appeared designed to score public
relations points for each side.
Both proposals were revealed first by the White
House.
Describing the U.S. invitation as unprecedented,
presidential spokesman Larry Speakes said, "This is
an effort to demonstrate that we would go the extra
mile in order to get some results in arms control dis
cussions. We would characterize it as a concrete step
that indicates our good faith and seriousness in ap
proaching arms control negotiations."
The official Soviet news agency Tass said the U.S.
invitation was a White House ploy to divert atten
tion from the Soviet calls for a test-ban treaty, but
did not say if the Soviets would reject the offer.
Tass also issued a statement quoting Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev as calling the arms race an
"immense threat to the future of the entire world
civilization 1 ' and saying the Soviet ban would be a
step toward forging a fuller agreement on nuclear
disarmament.
The Soviets said they would halt all nuclear test
ing unilaterally from Aug. 6 — the 40th anniversary
of the U.S. bombing of Hiroshima — until next Jan.
1, the White House said.
Soviet officials were quoted by the White House
as saying they would consider extending the ban if
the United States joined in.
Rejecting the moratorium, a senior administra
tion official said that "given the scope and scale of
Soviet modernization programs and U;S. restraint,
U.S. testing is necessary to ensure the continued
credibility and effectiveness of the U.S. nuclear
deterrent."
"I believe that the history of moratoria proposals

documents that they have been made for propaganda
purposes," the official said. "What history has
taught us about this.is that these devices invariably
are self-serving and designed to lock in areas of So
viet advantage." He said the Soviet Union sharply
accelerated its nuclear tests over the past month, ap
parently to make up for time that would be lost
during the moratorium.
The administration said there was no link be
tween the Soviet offer and the U.S. invitation for
Moscow to send a team to Nevada to monitor a
single nuclear blast at the government's test site.
Speakes said the Soviets could bring with them
any instruments they want. Monitoring a test near
ground zero would allow the Soviets to calibrate
their instruments, and thus more accurately mea
sure future U.S. nuclear explosions from afar, ac
cording to the administration official, who declined
to be identified.
The White House first announced its invitation to
the Soviet Union, and then waited about two hours
before revealing Moscow's proposal for a test
moratorium. The United States was privately in
formed by the Soviets on Sunday that they would
issue a moratorium call, the official said.
The United States did not inform the Soviets of
the American invitation until yesterday, the same
day the White House announced it.
The White House adamantly denied that the U.S.
invitation was timed to counter the Soviet proposal
and said the U.S. move would have been announced
regardless of what was done by Moscow.
It was Gorbachev's second major arms control
proposal since he came to power. In April he made
his first major arms control statement as general
secretary of the Soviet Union's Communist Party,
announcing a moratorium through Nov. 1 on
deployment of Soviet medium-range missiles in
Europe.
Both the United States and the Soviet Union des
cribed their announcements as efforts to foster the
Geneva arms talks.
