U.S., Soviet ministers to meet
HELSINKI, Finland — The Soviet Union's first new foreign
minister in three decades said yesterday that the governments of
the world must make a joint effort to ease tensions and improve
the international political climate.
Eduard Shevardnadze, 57, is here for the 10th anniversary ob
servance of the Helsinki accords on European security and
cooperation, which were negotiated in two years of meetings and
signed in 1975.
He was Communist Party leader in the Soviet republic of
Georgia until he was named July 2 to replace Andrei Gromyko,
who had been foreign minister since 1958. Gromyko became the
new Soviet president.
Shevardnadze reserved comment on his scheduled meeting
with Secretary of State George Shultz.
He said in a statement distributed at the airport: "We are con
vinced that the current tense situation in the world calls for joint
etlorts aimed at radically improving the political climate in
Europe and in international relations as a whole."
The three-day commemorative conference opens today and is
almost certain to be overshadowed by private meetings of the 35
foreign ministers, especially the session tomorrow between
Shultz and Shevardnadze.
Soviet and American officials said the two would discuss arma
ments, human rights and the summit scheduled for November
between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev.
Among Western foreign ministers with whom Shevardnadze is
expected to hold private talks are Sir Geoffrey Howe of Britain,
Francisco Fernandez Ordonez of Spain and West Germany's
Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
Shultz plans several similar meetings.
Foreign ministers of the European Common Market were or
ganizing a special meeting about the situation in South Africa,
where the government imposed a state of emergency July 21 to
curb black unrest.
UCLA to treat Hudson's ailments
PARIS, France — Movie and television star Rock Hudson,
described by an aide as "fighting for his life" against the disease
AIDS, left Paris aboard a direct flight to Los Angeles last night,
an airport source reported.
He said Hudson and an entourage of nine left from the Charles
de Gaulle Airport in a Boeing 747 on a special Air France flight,
expected to take about 12 hours.
The airport source, speaking on the condition that he not be
identified, said Hudson was flown to the airport north of Paris
aboard a helicopter.
Hudson's publicist in Los Angeles said the actor was to be
taken immediately to the medical center at UCLA and no state
ment was planned when he arrived at Los Angeles International
Airport.
"Here's a man who's fighting for his life, and a press event
there could jeopardize his life," said Dale Olson. "My major
' concern at this point is his condition and his comfort. That is the
reason he is being brought back here."
Cathy Dunn, a UCLA Medical Center spokeswoman, said
Hudson was to be admitted today "for further evaluation and
treatment for his present illness."
The French armed forces press service said a senior military
doctor specializing in AIDS research had consulted with Hud
son's doctors about whether to to take him to a military hospital
for treatment.
However, Hudson's spokeswoman, Yanou Collart, said Hud
son has not been treated for AIDS — acquired immune
deficiency syndrome — since entering American Hospital on July
21.
This refuted reports that he was being given HPA 23, an ex
perimental drug not yet available in the United States.
Interim Ugandan chief sworn in
KAMPALA, Uganda — The chief of Uganda's armed forces,
a soldier since 1940, was sworn in yesterday as interim head of
state. He said the army overthrew President Milton Obote to
bring stability, and elections will be held soon.
Lt. Gen. Tito Okello, 71, said of the coup: "Last Saturday,
July 27, was a memorable day. It was the day when Ugandans
who sacrificed their blood and their lives to displace a murderer
dictator (Idi Amin) in 1979 again took up arms against and drove
out of power yet another dictator who had caused untold suffer
ing to Uganda."
He said the purposes of the coup were "peace, stability and full
reconciliation," pledging in his brief address: "My services to you
in this capacity will be short, and you will elect a government of
your choice." He was sworn in by Saul Musoke, president of the
appeals court.
The capital was calm after two days of looting and gunfire, al
though people were seen searching in the debris of ransacked
shops for overlooked booty.
Police officers abandoned their posts Saturday but were back
on duty yesterday, helping soldiers guard such facilities as the
central bank and post office. Banks and government offices were
closed, and many shops were unable to open because of the
heavy damage inflicted by looters.
Uganda radio said earlier yesterday that Tito Okello would
form a broad-based interim government and hold elections
within a year in this central African nation. It said a prime mini
ster would be chosen to oversee the administration.
