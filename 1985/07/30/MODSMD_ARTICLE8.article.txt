CIA, ABC face lawsuit
LOS ANGELES — A political action group
filed a $170 million lawsuit yesterday alleging
that the CIA, the ABC television network and
military officials engaged in racketeering and
defamed a man who claims to be a former agent.
The Southern California chapter of Americans
for Democratic Action filed the suit in federal
court on behalf of Scott Barnes, who claims to be
a former operative whom the CIA ordered to kill
another operative in Hawaii.
The suit stems from an ABC "World News
Tonight" interview with Barnes last September in
which Barnes alleged that the CIA ordered him
to kill another operative, Ronald Rewald. Barnes
said he refused to carry out the order.
ABC eventually retracted the story, and the
ADA's suit alleges that the CIA forced the net
work to do so.
u The CIA and naval intelligence worked with
ABC to perpetrate a lie against Barnes," said
Ralph Fertig, a private lawyer representing the
ADA in the suit. "More than the money, we want
a retraction, vindication and clarification. We
want equity. We want what's fair."
The lawsuit names as defendants CIA Director
William Casey, the American Broadcasting Cos.,
ABC President of News and Sports Roone Ar
ledge, news anchorman Peter Jennings and other
ABC officials as well as Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger and Navy Secretary John
Lehman Jr.
Also named in the suit was Capitol Cities Com
munications Inc., which has filed with the Federal
Communications Commission to purchase ABC.
CIA spokeswoman Kathy Pherson in Virginia
declined last night to comment on the suit be
cause the papers had not been received by the
CIA. However, she said the CIA is on record that
Barnes never worked for the agency.
"We have said we have never been involved in

a plot to kill Ronald Rewald or any other U.S.
citizen," Pherson said.
ABC spokeswoman Elise Adde in Washington
said last night that she had not seen the lawsuit
and could not comment on any aspect of the case.
The lawsuit says the government and ABC vio
lated the Racketeering Influenced by Corrupt
Organizations Act, interfered with Barnes First
Amendment rights and conspired to defame his
character.
'Suspect' bee hive found
SACRAMENTO — A scientist looking for
more killer bees found a "very suspicious" hive
yesterday as officials pondered killing millions of
commercial honeybees to prevent the spread of
the more aggressive killer variety.
A bee specialist helping search a 400-square
mile area near Bakersfield discovered the
"suspect wild swarm ... in a steel pipe at an
abandoned oil well," said Jan Wessell, a spokes
woman for the state Department of Food and
Agriculture.
The specialist, Norman Gary, hit the pipe
with a stick, and the bees came out of the pipe "in
great numbers and persisted in following him for
200 yards," Wessell said. Gary was wearing pro
tective clothing and was not injured, the depart
ment said.
"That's a very suspicious wild hive," said state
Agriculture Director Clare Berryhill. "It showed
very aggressive behavior." Domestic honeybees,
he added, would have quieted down sooner.
Experts were conducting tests late yesterday to
determine if the latest nest contained killer bees,
Berryhill said. The pipe nest was discovered "in
very close proximity" to the site where the first
killer bees in the U.S. were found in a burrow,
some four miles west of Interstate 5 and about 60
miles northwest of Bakersfield.
