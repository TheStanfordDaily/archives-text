## The 						Stanford Daily Time for action 
### 
On one side of the world, at the bottom of a continent
they call Africa, people are being arrested. The last count
was slightly over 1,200. Many have already died.
On the other side of the world, in the so-called Land of
the Free, the president is making the final arrangements for
an extended vacation at his Santa Barbara beach house.
However, the United States has not been completely
blind to the horrors — not to mention the bloodshed — in
South Africa. Years ago, when the issue of apartheid
became "in,"the president verbally slapped the South
African government on the wrist, denouncing apartheid
with harsh words.
They called it constructive engagement. It was meant to
persuade the South Africans to abandon their apartheid
practices. It didn't, but the U.S. government chose to look
the other way, and the president went on more vacations.
Now, after the South African government has declared a
state of emergency, an excuse to arrest (and sometimes
kill) its already oppressed opposition, a Western nation has
decided to do something more. It has enacted economic
sanctions — serious, effective sanctions.
That Western nation is not the United States. It is
France.
It's bad enough that the United States, which prides itself
on being a watchdog of the world and the last bastion of
true democracy, wasn't the first nation to take substantial
action against apartheid. It's even worse that it has been
nearly a week since France announced its sanctions, and
the United States still remains inactive.
France has already beat the United States to it in this
case, but that does not mean the United States can't act.
U.S. action can still induce a following. Bringing sanctions
against the South African government can serve as an ex
ample for other Western nations, namely Britain, which
has considerable economic interests in South Africa.
And now that South African President P.W. Botha has
turned down Nobel laureate Bishop Desmond Tutu's ur
gent request for a meeting to discuss the issue, it is even
more imperative that outside forces apply pressure to the
South African government.
The key, though, is effective pressure. Harsh words are
not enough. Action, as in effective economic sanctions, is
what is needed. Constructive engagement is a synonym for
unconstructive disengagement.
Something very bad is happening on the other side of the
world, something that no longer can be ignored.
