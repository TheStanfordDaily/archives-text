Jazz up youß MORNiNq \x/rrh KZSU!_____
Here are four ways to make your morning
perfect. First, give yourself a long, lazy stretch.
Then rake a brisk shower. Drink a gloss of cool,
freshly-squeezed orange juice. And listen to
elegant music on KZSU's morning jazz shows. As
always, there won't be any commercials,
overplayed songs, and all that jazz. Just music
with subtle pizzazz. Enjoy it every weekday
morning from 7am to 10 am. i pjyj
You'll be jAzzed foR ihe rest of tNe ctay! KZSU, StanJoßcJ
