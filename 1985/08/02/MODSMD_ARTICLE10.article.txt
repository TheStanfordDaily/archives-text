Early HPA 23 dose may slow AIDS
PARIS The producers of the chemical used in actor
Rock Hudson s AIDS treatment say controlled clinical trials of
the substance, HPA 23, may start soon in the United States. But
they warn against excessive optimism.
Bob White, an AIDS victim from San Francisco who has un
dergone 10 weeks of treatment in Paris with HPA 23, says it ap
pears to have stabilized his case, though not those of some other
Americans receiving the treatment.
White, leading efforts to allow the Americans to continue
HPA 23 treatment back home, said his immune system remains
"depleted" but "I have no longer any active AIDS virus, I have
no current infection, I swim 1,000 yards a day and live in a fifth
floor walk-up."
He said, however, his treatment started within weeks of his
AIDS diagnosis in February and"it only works on early-stage
patients."
Among about 10 other Americans getting HPA 23, he said,
"some are not quite as healthy and have had infections."
Film star Hudson was treated for six weeks last year with HPA
23, his Paris spokeswoman Yannou Collart said Wednesday. But
when he returned here July 20 his condition was not considered
suitable for further treatment. He was flown back to Los Angeles
on Monday.
Dr. Yves Champey, vice president for medical and scientific
development at the government-owned chemical company
Rhone-Poulenc Sante, which makes HPA 23, said new trials will
start in France "in the coming weeks" on up to 150 patients.
"In seven to eight months we will have at least preliminary
results and some hard facts to work on" about the effect of HPA
23 at various dosages and its side effects, he told The Associated
Press on Wednesday.
Patients will be chosen for the tests "as early as possible after
diagnosis," he said. He stressed that HPA 23 is still only a chemi
cal compound and not a developed drug.
In the United States, the company's American branch, Rhone-
Poulenc Pharmaceuticals, is expected to file for Food and Drug
Administration permission for clinical trials "in three to four
weeks, maximum," Champey said.
The FDA has said it could "turn around" the application
within two weeks. Research is already under way in the United
States on other possible AIDS drugs.
Champey said it usually takes four to eight years of testing and
development to turn a compound into a drug. He said he hoped
the process could be speeded up if HPA 23 proves satisfactory.
White's brother John, a lobbyist from Sacramento, told Cham
pey Wednesday the Americans here want Rhone-Poulenc to ask
the FDA to let it supply them with HPA 23 in the United States.
White, 31, a San Francisco health planner, said in an interview
tha-t the Americans want to go home and continue a
"maintenance regime" of HPA 23, both as a scientific trial and
on humanitarian grounds.
"We are the people who have been under HPA 23 treatment
the longest, so we are valuable scientifically," he said.
India, Pakistan talks stalemated
NEW DELHI, India — India and Pakistan, who have fought
three wars since 1947, made no apparent progress toward a
peace accord in the latest talks, which ended yesterday.
A joint statement after the three days of talks said Niaz Naik,
Pakistan's foreign secretary, and his Indian counterpart, Ramesh
Bhandari, discussed New Delhi's proposal for a treaty of peace,
friendship and cooperation and Islamabad's counter-offer of a
non-aggression pact.
"Both sides sought further clarifications and agreed to con
tinue efforts aimed at the conclusion of a comprehensive treaty
between the two countries," the statement said.
India has accused Pakistan of aiding radical Sikhs in Punjab
and has expressed concern that Pakistan is close to developing a
nuclear weapon.
Islamabad maintains its nuclear program is for peaceful
purposes and that it has not helped Sikh extremists.
Japan, China sign nuclear pact
TOKYO — Japan and China signed a nuclear power coopera
tion agreement and a loan agreement for China worth $312.9
million Wednesday at the end of a two-day ministerial meeting.
Wu Xueqian, the Chinese foreign minister, and his Japanese
counterpart, Shintaro Abe, signed the agreements at the final
session of the conference, fourth in a series of high-level talks
that began in 1980.
Peking and Tokyo restored diplomatic relations in 1972 and
since have become major trading partners. Their trade volume
exceeded $13 billion in 1984.
A series of talks that began in September 1983 on an overall
nuclear agreement had progressed slowly because of China's re
luctance to allow international inspections of its nuclear plants.
China has now agreed to the inspections. The agreement pro
vides for China to allow on-site inspection by the International
Atomic Energy Agency to ensure that Japanese nuclear technol-'
ogy is used "for peaceful purposes only."
The accord marks Japan's entry into international competition
to supply China's huge nuclear energy needs. A similar agree
ment was signed last week between China and the United States.
China already had signed nuclear technology agreements with
France, West Germany, Britain, Belgium, Argentina and Brazil.
The loan agreement, to be fulfilled in Japan's fiscal 1985 end
ing March 31, 1986, is for seven economic projects.
