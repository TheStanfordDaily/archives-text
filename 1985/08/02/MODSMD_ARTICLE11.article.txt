$172 billion deficit passes
WASHINGTON — Congress reluctantly
ratified a budget with a scaled-down deficit re
duction plan last night as it rushed to begin its an
nual summer vacation.
With many lawmakers holding airplane tickets
for home, the House and Senate also adopted a
$13 billion catch-all spending bill that includes
$27 million for the Contra rebels fighting the
Sandinista government in Nicaragua. The CIA
and Pentagon would be barred from distributing
the money.
After laboring for weeks, negotiators for the
two houses agreed at midday on a $967.6 billion
budget for the next fiscal year that would
safeguard Social Security cost-of-living increases,
shun any tax increase and allow the Pentagon
budget for 1986 to grow with inflation.
The plan calls for cuts in numerous domestic
programs, including Amtrak, and provides a
freeze on Medicare payments to doctors and
most hospitals, but projects a 1986 deficit of
$172 billion.
The Democratic-controlled House adopted the
blueprint several hours later on a vote of 309-
119.
The GOP-ruled Senate quickly followed suit,
67-32, but only after Democratic Leader Robert

Byrd of West Virginia wrung public assurances
from GOP Leader Robert Dole that President
Reagan supports the plan and "will not criticize
those who vote for it."
Few if any lawmakers expressed genuine plea
sure with the plan — only relief that protracted
negotiations were over. '
The plan's $276.2 billion deficit reduction over
three years was far less than many lawmakers
originally sought, and would leave a deficit of
more than $112 billion in 1988, far above the fig
ure that Reagan inherited when he took office.
Rich escape income taxes
WASHINGTON — Almost 30,000 couples
and individuals with incomes above $250,000
paid little or no federal income tax in 1983, the
Treasury Department said yesterday. The num
ber included 3,170 who earned more than $1 mil
lion apiece.
Most of the high-income earners relied on tax
shelters, chiefly those using a partnership ar
rangement, to reduce their taxes. Other major
factors were the lower tax rate allowed capital"
gains — which are profits from the sale of assets
— and the ability to use business losses from pre
vious years to offset current-year taxes.
