Diablo's last reactor OKed
WASHINGTON — The Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, with one member dissenting over
lingering earthquake concerns, approved a full
power operating license yesterday for the second
reactor at California's Diablo Canyon nuclear
plant.
Opponents of the twin-reactor, $5.6 billion
plant on the Pacific Coast near San Luis Obispo
said they plan to ask a federal appeals court to
overturn the NRC's action.
Commission officials said the license will not
be issued until the giant Westinghouse
manufactured reactor completes a low-power
testing program, expected in about two weeks.
Commissioner James Asselstine dissented in
the 4-1 vote, saying the NRC still owes the
plant's opponents a hearing on whether a nearby
earthquake might hamper an emergency evacua
tion of the area in case of a radioactivity-releas
ing accident.
Asselstine said he also still questions whether
adequacy of various studies concluding that the
design of the plant is sufficient to withstand a
major quake. The plant, owned by Pacific Gas &
Electric Co., sits less than three miles from an
offshore earthquake fault.
George Maneatis, PG&E's executive vice pres
ident, said officials for both the utility and the
NRC have "confirmed the integrity" of all the

Unit 2 reactor's key safety systems.
The NRC approved a low-power license for
the reactor last April. But it is not scheduled to
"go criticar — begin a nuclear chain reaction —
until next Tuesday.
The first reactor began commercial operation
at 100 percent power on May 7. Since then it has
been operating at an average 91 percent capacity.
The two units together will generate electricity
for more than 2 million people.
Poison used on wild bees
LOST HILLS — Investigators armed with
spray cans of poison hunted down nests of wild
bees yesterday, while commercial beekeepers
said they feared the nation's first African "killer
bee" outbreak would cripple their industry.
State agricultural agents, acting on tips
supplied by local residents, fanned out over a 50-
mile-radius around Lost Hills, site of the June 25
discovery of an underground nest of aggressive,
African "killer bees." Authorities believe at least
two reproducing queens and their accompanying
swarms fled the nest after the oil worker who
found and reported the colony attempted un
successfully to cover it up.
Local beekeepers fear a widening infestation of
African bees could lead to the destruction of the
comercial, honey-producing hives of the more
docile domestic bees.
