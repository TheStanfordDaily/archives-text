## The 						Stanford Daily Free Opus sensibly 
### 
Around the time the issue of South Africa began to heat
up on many campuses, other parties also began pressing for
an end to the white minority regime and its apartheid
policy.
Off in Bloom County, for instance, computer genius
Oliver Wendell Jones listened to his father explain that in
South Africa "people like you and me" are denied political
rights.
Not certain that an endless list of senseless demands to
the principal of Bloom Elementary would help end apart
heid, Oliver took a different approach than, for instance,
members of Stanford Out of South Africa. After a few days
and a few hundred Domino's pizzas, he developed the
electro-photo-pigmentizer: A device that could turn a
white person's skin black.
After a few successful trials, Oliver set out to use the gun
on the white South African ambassador in Washington.
But in the course of the mission, Cutter John, a white male
adult confined to a wheelchair, and Opus, a four-year-old
penguin fond of pickled herring, were supposedly lost over
the Atlantic.
Many presume they were eaten by squid, but we have a
different theory. South Africa announced the recall of its
ambassador to Washington Tuesday. Opus has disap
peared. Coincidence? We think not.
It's a disturbing charge to make, but reliable sources tell
us the ambassador has captured Opus, and say he will at
tempt to spirit Opus back to the oppressive country in a
diplomatic pouch.
When given that information, the group Students Out of
Sense (SOS) immediately announced their plans for action.
"We will petition Berke Breathed (the strip's author)
until his eyes go bad from reading them," said one
protester. "We will march and assemble and issue demands
until the cows come home," said another.
While we wholeheartedly support Opus' return, we can
not sanction actions that would waste time at best and pos
sibly even cause harm to the strip's author.
