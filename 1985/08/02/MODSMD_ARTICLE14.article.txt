# Nuke linkage to power

It was approximately 304 centimeters in length,
71 centimeters in diameter, slightly over four tons in
weight and bore the unlikely name "Little Boy.
Forty years ago Tuesday, it was released from the
bay of an American B-29, christened Enola Gay
after the pilot's mother, and fell on Hiroshima.
Today, Hiroshima stands as a symbol for the birth
of the most frightening aspect of the nuclear age.
Through the work of groups such as Physicians for
Social Responsibility, Tuesday will be Hiroshima
Day.
A certain friend of mine, who will probably take
part in Hiroshima Day, has a button he often wears.
The button is in the shape of a mushroom cloud and
has the words "never again" written across the bot
tom. Inside the cloud are the names of places
Trinity, Hiroshima, Nagasaki. There are also names
such as Three Mile Island and Comanche Flats. To
my friend it seems perfectly logical that Hiroshima
and Three Mile Island should be on the same but
ton. It would seem that a lot of people feel that
Hiroshima and Three Mile Island, and the things
they stand for, are fundamentally similar the
latest issue of Time magazine shows the cloud rising
above Bikini Atoll on one page and the cooling tow
ers of Three Mile Island on the next.
What is generally referred to as the nuclear age
has come to us at a considerable price. The United
States alone, one of the five countries comprising
the nuclear "club," has enough weapons stockpiled
to kill millions and put the future of our species
gravely in doubt. Our nuclear power plants produce
waste that we do not seem to know what to do with,
and which will remain dangerous for thousands of
years. It is easy to see how Hiroshima and Three
Mile Island might hold equal places in someone's
mind as symbols of the peril we have created for
ourselves. But to attempt to consider nuclear power
and nuclear weapons as a single issue is to hope
lessly distort both, and equating the problems posed
by the two serves to muddle one and trivialize the
other.
Without a doubt, we would be safer without nu
clear power. We would also be safer without many
of the other products of our technology, such as
aircraft or automobiles, but we have decided that
the benefits of these technologies justify the risks
they present. Since nuclear power represents a
relatively cheap and readily available supply of the
energy we desperately need, attempting to ban nu

clear power would probably be as successful as
trying to ban automobiles and aircraft for being un
acceptably hazardous. The problems associated with
nuclear power are principally technological. For ex
ample, we need a safe method for handling and
storing spent fuel and waste, or we need to redesign
power plants so they are safer.
While it is true that a major accident in a power
plant could endanger thousands of people, an acci
dent involving the control we have over our nuclear
arsenal could kill millions, or hundreds of millions.
To try to equate the two gives the hazards of nu
clear power an aspect of hopelessness that is unwar
ranted and is useless at best, counterproductive at
worst.

The largest problems associated with nuclear
weapons are not technological; they are social — we
seem to have an innate tendency to kill one another,
and we now have unprecedented ability to do so.
To bring the threat of nuclear war down to the
level of a power plant accident is to dangerously
trivialize it. To compare Hiroshima to Three Mile
Island is to suggest that a great degree of technical
craftsmanship will solve our problems and, instead of
a new way of thinking about war and fighting, all we
really need is a sufficiently clever new weapon or
piece of technology to "remove the specter of a nu
clear holocaust" and to "make nuclear weapons im
potent and obsolete."
Finally, to compare Three Mile Island to Hiro
shima is to belittle the suffering that took place there
and is an insult to the people who lived through
Hiroshima, as well as 80,000 who died there. I hope
my friend will not wear his button on Aug. 6.
