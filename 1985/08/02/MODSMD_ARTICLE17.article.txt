STOP only informs
I am responding to The Daily
editorial of July 26 regarding
STOP (Stanford Students
Opposed to Pornography). I
would like to emphasize that in
this letter I am representing only
myself and the actions I have
been involved in this summer.
STOP has not been active since
the end of spring quarter and the
work on the Tresidder
Guidelines Committee has been
mine alone.
When the Tresidder Union
Board decided to form a
guidelines committee over the
summer to discuss issues such as
pornography and make recom
mendations, I asked to be in
cluded. On that committee, I
have met and gained respect for
people who care about their part
in the University's educational
mission, and I thank Tresidder
management for that opportu
nity.
At present The Store sells only
what it considers "soft porn." My
objection to selling any pornog
raphy was based on STOP's
opinion (and mine) that there is
a continuum between "hard" and
"soft" core pornography. They
serve to legitimize each other. If
The Store does not sell one por
nographic magazine, why should
it sell another?
But the discussions of the
guidelines committee convinced
me that simply removing pornog
raphy would not help to educate
and spark intelligent discussion
in the Stanford community re
garding the complicated issue of
pornography and its role in a
sexist society. The committee as
a whole, not STOP, decided on
the compromise (which only
concerns the Pac-10 issue of
Playboy) of enclosing each maga

zine in a manila*envelope and
affixing a flier. The committee
felt that this recommended ac
tion corresponded to its responsi
bility to promote the educational
mission of the University. The
Daily has made erroneous as
sumptions regarding this pro
posed action, especially consider
ing that STOP and The Store
would compose the flier together
and it has yet to be completed.
The intention of this proposed
action is not to "force" our
opinions onto the Stanford com
munity. Rather, we feel it is im
portant to discuss various
opinions on pornography and
various solutions to the increas
ing amount of violence portrayed
in it. Selling the magazines with
out questioning them says they
are OK. The committee recom
mended this kind of action in
stead of removing all porno
graphic magazines because this
action still allows the customer to
make a choice in product selec
tion and will open up lines of
communication and education
regarding pornography.
I object to pornography be
cause it portrays women as will
ing sexual objects and equates
violence and aggression with an
expression of normal male
sexuality. These types of gender
stereotypes are dangerous and
wrong. I am focusing on pornog
raphy because I cannot possibly
address all forms of sexism and
gender-based violence with equal
focus at all times. I hope that
whatever action Tresidder finally
decides upon will uphold prin
ciples of choice — balancing the
rights of the customer with the
rights of all women.
