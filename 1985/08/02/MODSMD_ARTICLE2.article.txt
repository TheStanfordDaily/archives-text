# SJC, court rulings
## Guilty verdict for Anderson News 
### JONATHAN PAUL 
In an undisclosed report to
University President Donald
Kennedy, the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC) recommended last
Friday that sophomore Joseph
Anderson be found guilty of
violating the Fundamental Stan
dard for driving under the influ
ence of alcohol on the night of
April 17.
The SJC's findings will be
released to the public after they
are reviewed by the President's
Office.
The Santa Clara County
Municipal Court, however, ruled
yesterday on the same incident
and found Anderson not guilty of
driving with over .10 percent
blood alcohol.
The court did find Anderson
guilty of leaving the scene of an
accident for backing over a
bicycle without informing the

owner, and sentenced him to on«
year probation, a fine of $340 am
restitution of $50 to be paid t(
the owner of the bicycle.
Sally Cole, the University'
judicial affairs officer, said the
court's decision would have no ef
feet on the University's verdict ii
the Anderson case.
"We have our own process fo
determining the facts," Cole said
adding that the University i:
"under no obligation to evaluate
it (the Anderson case) in tht
same way as the courts do."
Cole stressed that the Presi
dent's Office "will want to take
account of the penalties the cour
imposes" in determining the Uni
versity's final sentence.
The SJC's current recommen
dation is a stayed, one-quarte
suspension; 40 hours of commu
nity service work on campus; res
titution for damage to the bicycle
and possibly enrollment in an al
cohol education program.
The University will probably
drop its demand for restitution,
for instance, since the court sen
tence also calls for restitution.
In the court case, Anderson
centered his defense on the claim
that he and two friends had been
drinking shots of 80 proof whis
key at Delta Upsilon house be
tween the time he was last seen
driving a car and the time the
blood alcohol test was adminis
tered.
Anderson claimed in court that
his drinking at the DU house in
validated the test results which
found his blood alcohol level to
be above .10 percent.
Anderson, however, com
pletely omitted any reference to
his drinking at DU house in the
case he presented to the SJC
hearing officer.
Anderson, who is not a mem

ber of DU fraternity, said the fra
ternity had a "bad name with the
(University) administration" at
the time of the incident.
Anderson said he heard that
"the sole reason he was being
prosecuted (by the SJC) was be
cause he was affiliated with DU."
University policy allows four
days in which to appeal SJC
recommendations. Anderson has
asked for an extension of the time
in which to appeal.
The SJC's decision came on
Friday which gave him the
weekend, Monday and Tuesday
to appeal. Monday and Tuesday
were also the first two days of his
court trial.
Anderson's attorney, Thomas
Crary claimed that he "hardly
had a chance to look at the (SJC)
decision," but added that
"certainly there will be an appeal
to the president of the Univer
sity."
The appeal will be either a for
mal or informal request, Crary
continued, "for what we believe
would be the exercise of good
judgement on his (President Ken
nedy's) part by rejecting the
SJC's findings."
