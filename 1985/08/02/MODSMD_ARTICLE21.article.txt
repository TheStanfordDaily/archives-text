Eurythmics
"Be Yourself Tonight" (RCA)
With guest and backing musicians in
cluding Aretha Franklin, Elvis Costello,
Stevie Wonder and Tom Petty's band, the
Heartbreakers, the Eurythmics' latest LP,
"Be Yourself Tonight," is assured of coat
tail success if only because of the track
records of these diverse and well-known
artists. As it turns out, though, their names
won't be needed to assure the success of
this album.
On their fourth official Eurythmics
release, guitarist and keyboard whiz David
Stewart and vocalist Annie Lennox have
succeeded in their own right, creating a
soulful and compelling collection of songs
which truly show them to be much more
than just another synth-pop, one-or-two
hit passing fancy. Lennox's vocals are
crystalline and pure, containing that
elusive vitality that many singers strive for
but never achieve. Her duet with Ms.
Franklin on the song "Sisters Are Doin' It
For Themselves" shows her to have every
bit of the soul that Aretha has. On most of
the songs, Lennox's smooth and passionate
delivery is wonderfully complemented by
Stewart's music and production, forming a
sound that is at once stirring and complex,
funky and current. The second side is occa
sionally marred by a lack of enthusiasm (as
in "Adrian," sung with Elvis Costello), but
in the end "Be Yourself Tonight" comes
through as a solid and spirited effort, proof
that the Eurythmics are indeed a band that
is here to stay.

"The Best of Blue Note" (Blue
Note)
The Blue Note label that was founded in
1939 by Alfred Lion and Frank Wolff was
the jazz label from the mid-1940s through
1971, when Wolff died. Following this loss,
Lion left the label, and its prestige and
quality declined measurably as the bulk of
the label left for greener pastures. In 1985
though, Blue Note has been reborn and ap
pears quite healthy. Lion is back at the
helm, and major talents both new and old
are making fine recordings once again.
Stanley Jordan's " Magic Touch" is both in
novative and impressive, while the likes of
Kenny Burrell, Stanley Turrentine and
Grover Washington Jr. have turned in su
perior performances (at least as compared
to their work of late).
This is a compilation from the "golden
era" of Blue Note's history. As such it is a

who's who of jazz between 1945 and
1965 (pre-fusion). This is "straight" jazz,
basically working upon the 12-bar varia
tions from the blues and with 4/4 through
7/8 time. Here one finds bop, blues, bal
lads, hard bop, etc. The personal as
sembled are beyond measure, all the takes
are, of course, superior and of historical im
port. Among the "giants" of jazz are:
Miles Davis ("Tempus Fugit"), John
Coltrane ("Blue Train"), Art Blakey
("Moanin' "), Clifford Brown ("Cher
okee"), Thelonius Monk ("Criss

Cross"), Jimmy Smith ("Back To The
Chicken Shack") and Lee Morgan ("The
Sidewinder"). All in all, 15 classic perfor
mances. In addition, the sidemen alone are
worth the price of album — Max Roach,
Benny Golson, Joe Henderson, Sahib
Shihab, Milt Jackson, Freddie Hubbard,
Tony Williams, Ron Carter, ad nauseum.
This is not mere name-dropping for the
sake of name-dropping; these men have all
made integral and important contributions
to modern jazz, and there has been no bet
ter chronicle of those contributions than
this label and this album.

"Go-Go Crankin"' (T.T.E.D.)
Go-Go is the primary dance sound now
popular among the majority of the resi
dents of Washington, D.C., proper. It is
percussive funk, characterized by horns
and call/response vocals. This is party
music of the world-beat variation for all
races, ages and sexes. But Go-Go is more
than just a genre of music, it is a whole life
style. To quote from the liner notes, "Go-
Go has its own laws, its own enforcers, its
own politics in the city that houses the na
tion's president. It is the collective voice of

a community that history has ignored."
This album is a compilation of the
leaders of this movement. Of the six bands
featured, only Trouble Funk has had any
sort of nationwide acclaim prior to the
popularization of Go-Go.
This is a great funk album; it gets one up
and moving, the sound is novel and the
variation in artists makes sure that things
never get repetitive. Since the music comes
straight from the nation's capital, it is, of
course, somewhat politicized. The in
fluences of George Clinton, Sly Stone,
James Brown and Kurtis Blow are readily
apparent. However, the sound is not a

mere copy — it is original and inventive
and meant to get one's feet in the groove,
or to the Go-Go.
A-
Graham Parker and the Shot
"Steady Nerves" (Elektra)
One really has to feel for Graham
Parker; the man has not had the easiest of
lives — even for a rock-and-roller. From
his earliest days playing the dive clubs of
Morocco to his brilliant angry early LPs, he
has never gotten the respect and popularity
he deserves and wants from the public.
Gifted with a sharp tongue and penetrating
lyrics, he was lumped with Elvis Costello
and Joe Jackson in the early days of the
punk/new wave explosion. But Graham
was always angrier than either of his con
temporaries and seemed to be striving for
more than merely pop success. This
sparked his finest songs ("Soul On Ice,"
"You Can't Be Too Strong," "Don't Ask
Me Questions," "Mercury Poisoning").
After producing three classic albums,
"Heat Treatment," "Howlin' Wind" and
"Squeezing Out Sparks," a flawed classic
in "Stick To Me" and a live piece of cor
porate profit-taking in"The Parkerilla,"
Parker was at an impasse. He had created
s*me of the toughest, most passionate
music of the decade, had the respect and
admiration of the critics, but the accep
tance of the masses still eluded his grasp.
All this preamble leads us to his latest ef
fort. He's found a new band that sounds a
lot better than the studio professionals on
the last two efforts. A few songs bring back
the promise of his first two LPs, especially
"Break Them Down." But the songs are all
sharp and fairly appealing. Overall, this al
bum has an edge to it that the few preced
ing efforts have lacked. While this record
never reaches the zenith that "Sparks"
achieved, it is better than most of the cur
rent crop of releases. "Steady Nerves"
proves that GP hasn't lost his ability to
throttle his listener, which is very refresh
ing news.
B-
Grading Scale: A: Indispensable to any
comprehensive collection. B: An
eminently listenable record which is lack
ing or flawed in some significant way. C: A
record that fans of a particular genre will
find, at the most, moderately enjoyable. D:
Even the most ardent fans will admit that
this record should never have been made.
F: Guano.
