# Give Katrina three waves hello

It is difficult to understand the
critical reception for Katrina and
the Waves' eponymous debut al
bum on Capitol/EMI records.
They were described in these
pages a few months ago as "one
hit wonders," yet Rolling Stone
magazine fell all over itself
looking for superlatives to
describe the group and finally
settled on "the next Pretenders."
While it is true that lead singer
Katrina Leskanich's vocals at
some moments resemble
Christine Kerr's of The
Pretenders, and while it is also
true that "Walking on Sunshine,"
the smash first single, is by far the
best thing on the album, neither
of these observations would lead
one to label the band either "one
hit wonders" or "the next
Pretenders." There are enough
melodic pop hooks on the al
bum's other songs, the kind of
hooks that are too rare on top-40
radio, to dispel the first accusa
tion, and it is obvious from the
songs themselves that Katrina
and the Waves have no preten
sions toward being the next
Pretenders. The Pretenders can
stir deep, important feelings in
their listeners; Katrina and the
Waves just want them to have a
good time.
They achieve this goal espe
cially well in "Walking on Sun
shine," one of the more deserving
hits currently in the top 40. It's
also one of the few hits that the
format of top 40 does not imme
diately flatten; even though they
play it 30 times in an hour, it
retains its energy and freshness.
"Walking on Sunshine" has ob
vious debts to Motown — the
horns, the rhythm guitar, the
melody — but it doesn't have the
thinness and strain of other
groups' borrowings from
Motown, most notably Wham!
and Hall and Oates. Somehow,
Katrina and the Waves have
managed to update the Motown
sound, to make it their own. That
somehow is the beat: fast and in
fectious, recalling Iggy Pop's
"Lust for Life." True, the lyrics
are simple, verging on the banal,
but when the drums pump along,
the guitars chime, and the horns
provide counterpoint just where
they should, who cares about the
lyrics? They go perfectly with the

music, especially when Leskanich
sings "I feel alive, I feel a love, I
feel a love that's really real," her
voice becoming another instru
ment adding to the joyous noise.
Leskanich's vocals are the most
notable aspect of Katrina and the
Waves, but they are also the most
problematic. Perhaps this is
where the disagreement among
the other critics originates. At
times she does indeed sound like
Christine Kerr, especially in
"Machine Gun Smith." Unfor
tunately "Machine Gun Smith" is
the album's worst song: a boring
diatribe about someone or some
thing that is either a terrorist or a
mercenary. Leskanich only sings
on one note during the entire
song, and there are only two
chords accompanying her. That
she is able to sing the lyrics as
though they meant something
says much indeed about her
voice. On the other songs, her vo
cals are adequate, but nothing
startling or fresh. Any competent
singer could carry them off, al
though Leskanich does convey a
keen sense of humor on "Game
of Love."
The two blues numbers "Cry
for Me" and"The Sun Won't
Shine," however, need a singer
who can put the full force of her
personality behind her voice; they
need a Christine Kerr or a Janis
Joplin, and Leskanich is neither.
Her voice at times becomes an
irksome screech resembling a
higher-pitched Joan Jett, but with
one important difference: She
smiles instead of snarls.
The band's bassist is Vince De
La Cruz, who has written two
songs on the album: "Que te
Quiero" and "Mexico." The
songs are similar in that they
combine ebullient pop music with
stupid lyrics. The music is
Mexican-flavored, borrowing
heavily from "La Bamba." De La
Cruz is not the first to use those
riffs in his own songs, and he
won't be the last, especially when
they work so wonderfully each
time they are used. The songs
bounce along in spite of lyrics like
"People keep tellin' me: Don't
get on that bus./ People keep tel
lin' me that it's not like us."
The band is rounded out by
Alex Cooper on drums, who
propels each song along nicely,

but lead guitarist Kimberly Rew,
who also wrote the other eight
songs on the album, is clearly the
most talented member. De La
Cruz's songs would not work half
so well without Rew's clever pop
guitar, and his songwriting (with
the notable exception of
"Machine Gun Smith" and the
two blues numbers) provides the
album with its most exhilarating
pop moments. He may not have
the artistry of Marshall Cren
shaw, but he is an intelligent pop
craftsman. His songs at their best
have a bubbly lightness, as in
"Red Wine and Whiskey,"

"Walking on Sunshine," "Game
of Love" and "Going Down to
Liverpool." By light I do not
mean lightweight, for there is real
craft involved in making music
that sounds this good.
The inclusion of "Going Down
to Liverpool" on this album does
raise some questions, though, be
cause comparisons must in
evitably be made with the version
of this same song recorded on the
1984 Bangles album "All Over
the Place." Rew wrote the song,
but next to the Bangles' version,
Katrina and the Waves' is leaden
and plodding. The Bangles' spar

kling, sha-la-la harmonies and
their delicate, chiming guitars are
exactly what is required, and
Katrina and the Waves can only
approximate it. It makes us want
to hear the Bangles record some
of Rew's other songs. The
Bangles could not, however, ac
complish their own "Walking on
Sunshine"; the song needs en
ergy, not delicacy. "Walking on
Sunshine" is one of the few exam
ples of what top-40 radio should
be about, and for that alone,
Katrina and the Waves deserve
high praise.

The debut album of Katrina and the Waves relies on the hit song "Walking on Sunshine" for its success.
It is difficult to understand the
critical reception for Katrina and
the Waves' eponymous debut al
bum on Capitol/EMI records.
They were described in these
pages a few months ago as "one
hit wonders," yet Rolling Stone
magazine fell all over itself
looking for superlatives to
describe the group and finally
settled on "the next Pretenders."
While it is true that lead singer
Katrina Leskanich's vocals at
some moments resemble
Christine Kerr's of The
Pretenders, and while it is also
true that "Walking on Sunshine,"
the smash first single, is by far the
best thing on the album, neither
of these observations would lead
one to label the band either "one
hit wonders" or "the next
Pretenders." There are enough
melodic pop hooks on the al
bum's other songs, the kind of
hooks that are too rare on top-40
radio, to dispel the first accusa
tion, and it is obvious from the
songs themselves that Katrina
and the Waves have no preten
sions toward being the next
Pretenders. The Pretenders can
stir deep, important feelings in
their listeners; Katrina and the
Waves just want them to have a
good time.
They achieve this goal espe
cially well in "Walking on Sun
shine," one of the more deserving
hits currently in the top 40. It's
also one of the few hits that the
format of top 40 does not imme
diately flatten; even though they
play it 30 times in an hour, it
retains its energy and freshness.
"Walking on Sunshine" has ob
vious debts to Motown — the
horns, the rhythm guitar, the
melody — but it doesn't have the
thinness and strain of other
groups' borrowings from
Motown, most notably Wham!
and Hall and Oates. Somehow,
Katrina and the Waves have
managed to update the Motown
sound, to make it their own. That
somehow is the beat: fast and in
fectious, recalling Iggy Pop's
"Lust for Life." True, the lyrics
are simple, verging on the banal,
but when the drums pump along,
the guitars chime, and the horns
provide counterpoint just where
they should, who cares about the
lyrics? They go perfectly with the

music, especially when Leskanich
sings "I feel alive, I feel a love, I
feel a love that's really real," her
voice becoming another instru
ment adding to the joyous noise.
Leskanich's vocals are the most
notable aspect of Katrina and the
Waves, but they are also the most
problematic. Perhaps this is
where the disagreement among
the other critics originates. At
times she does indeed sound like
Christine Kerr, especially in
"Machine Gun Smith." Unfor
tunately "Machine Gun Smith" is
the album's worst song: a boring
diatribe about someone or some
thing that is either a terrorist or a
mercenary. Leskanich only sings
on one note during the entire
song, and there are only two
chords accompanying her. That
she is able to sing the lyrics as
though they meant something
says much indeed about her
voice. On the other songs, her vo
cals are adequate, but nothing
startling or fresh. Any competent
singer could carry them off, al
though Leskanich does convey a
keen sense of humor on "Game
of Love."
The two blues numbers "Cry
for Me" and"The Sun Won't
Shine," however, need a singer
who can put the full force of her
personality behind her voice; they
need a Christine Kerr or a Janis
Joplin, and Leskanich is neither.
Her voice at times becomes an
irksome screech resembling a
higher-pitched Joan Jett, but with
one important difference: She
smiles instead of snarls.
The band's bassist is Vince De
La Cruz, who has written two
songs on the album: "Que te
Quiero" and "Mexico." The
songs are similar in that they
combine ebullient pop music with
stupid lyrics. The music is
Mexican-flavored, borrowing
heavily from "La Bamba." De La
Cruz is not the first to use those
riffs in his own songs, and he
won't be the last, especially when
they work so wonderfully each
time they are used. The songs
bounce along in spite of lyrics like
"People keep tellin' me: Don't
get on that bus./ People keep tel
lin' me that it's not like us."
The band is rounded out by
Alex Cooper on drums, who
propels each song along nicely,

but lead guitarist Kimberly Rew,
who also wrote the other eight
songs on the album, is clearly the
most talented member. De La
Cruz's songs would not work half
so well without Rew's clever pop
guitar, and his songwriting (with
the notable exception of
"Machine Gun Smith" and the
two blues numbers) provides the
album with its most exhilarating
pop moments. He may not have
the artistry of Marshall Cren
shaw, but he is an intelligent pop
craftsman. His songs at their best
have a bubbly lightness, as in
"Red Wine and Whiskey,"

"Walking on Sunshine," "Game
of Love" and "Going Down to
Liverpool." By light I do not
mean lightweight, for there is real
craft involved in making music
that sounds this good.
The inclusion of "Going Down
to Liverpool" on this album does
raise some questions, though, be
cause comparisons must in
evitably be made with the version
of this same song recorded on the
1984 Bangles album "All Over
the Place." Rew wrote the song,
but next to the Bangles' version,
Katrina and the Waves' is leaden
and plodding. The Bangles' spar

kling, sha-la-la harmonies and
their delicate, chiming guitars are
exactly what is required, and
Katrina and the Waves can only
approximate it. It makes us want
to hear the Bangles record some
of Rew's other songs. The
Bangles could not, however, ac
complish their own "Walking on
Sunshine"; the song needs en
ergy, not delicacy. "Walking on
Sunshine" is one of the few exam
ples of what top-40 radio should
be about, and for that alone,
Katrina and the Waves deserve
high praise.
