# Kenny G lets his hair down
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Editorial staff 
Kenny Gorelick, the nice
ewish boy who plays a mean
ixophone, has let his hair grow.
Gorelick's tight curls were ap
roaching his collar when he ap
eared in San Francisco last Oc
:>ber. Saturday night, when he
layed at San Francisco's Kabuki
heater, they had conquered his
ollar and were making their way
own his back.
Kenny G, as he's known on his
lbums, must be getting his hair
one by one of those French
esigners. One of those deals
'here they take two snips of hair,
low it dry and charge you $75.
he last time Gorelick had a real
aircut, he was still probably
ating Mom's matzo ball soup.
Not only is his curly hair — the
ind you can only wear short —
)ng, it also is styled. It is pressed
own on one side and hangs in his
yes on the other. Imagine some
ne as straight-laced as Steve
jarvey with long, wild curly hair,
nd you get the picture of what
he short, skinny Gorelick —
lama's boy through and
hrough — looks like with it.
One thing that does not seem
d be affected by all of Gorelick's
ecent success, however, is his
Tusic.
Gorelick proved that Saturday
t the Kabuki. Except for the ad
lition of a few songs from his
dtest album, entitled "Gravity,"
nd a few new band members,
jorelick's Kabuki show was a
•lueprint of his sold-out perfor
nance at Wolfgang's in October.
But that was fine with the near
>acked house, which paid $15 a
■ead ($l7 on the day of the show)
o see Gorelick and his opening
ct, local jazz/fusion pianist Rod
ley Franklin. The thousand or so
t the Kabuki knew Gorelick has
. reputation for good concerts.
They weren't disappointed.
Gorelick grew up in Seattle,

where he played in his high school
jazz band. He attended the Uni
versity of Washington and
graduated Phi Beta Kappa and
magna cum laude in accounting.
But it wasn't until after gradua
tion that he got his first big musi
cal break.
Jeff Lorber, a jazz/fusion
keyboard wizard, needed a wood
wind player for his band and dis
covered Gorelick through a
mutual friend. Gorelick went on
to play with Lorber for three
years before he cut his first solo
album, called "Kenny G," in
1982. The following year, he
broke with Lorber, and two solo
albums later, he has attained a
following of his own. Needless to
say, Gorelick is no longer
referred to as "Jeff Lorber's
former sax player."
"If I had to label my music,"
Gorelick says, "I'd call it corn
temporary R & B/pop with a
strong instrumental base. I've al
ways been into R & B. That's
where my heart lies. I used to lis
ten to nothing but funk."
Indeed, Gorelick's music is on
the funky side these days, in no
small part due to his producing
partner, Kashif. The New York
based producer has brought syn
thesized, funky baselines com
plete with handclaps to Gorelick's
music, unfortunately more for the
worse than the better.
But Gorelick is undaunted in
his efforts to experiment. He is
constantly striving for a more
modern jazz/fusion sound, and so
far, no one else has equaled his
success.
Gorelick's latest innovation is a
wind-activated synthesizer called
a lyricon. It looks like a metal
recorder (remember, the foot
long wooden thing with holes
your sister used to play) with a
cord coming out of the bottom. It
is played like any other woodwind
instrument, but sounds like, well,

anything you want it to.
Gorelick first made his lyricon
sound like a full-blown sym
phony. Then he pressed a foot
pedal, and it sounded like a trum
pet. Another foot pedal and it
sounded strikingly similar to an
Eddie Van Halen guitar solo.
Unfortunately, Gorelick wasn't
able to show off his new toy any
more. One of the synthesizers
malfunctioned, and his lyricon

solo came to an abrupt conclu
sion.
Somehow, it didn't seem to
bother the folks at the Kabuki,
who enjoyed every bit of the con
cert, not to mention Gorelick's
carefree, smiles-for-everyone
stage presence.
Gorelick, who played both
soprano and alto sax Saturday
night, says he first became inter
ested in the saxophone when he

saw a sax player on The Ed Sul
livan Show on television.
"The sax player was walking
around as if the saxophone was
part of his body," Gorelick
recalls. "You can put your whole
self inside it. There's romance,
compassion and feeling in it, like
the human voice. I felt it would be
easy to express myself through
it."
That he has.


The crowd at the Kabuki Theater last Saturday responded enthusiastically to Kenny Gorelick's "smiles-for
everyone" persona.
