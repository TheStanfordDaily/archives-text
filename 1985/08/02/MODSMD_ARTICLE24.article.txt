# Move Tung Yan nearer Stanford
## 
### 
Tung Yan is not the most diffi
cult place to find, but it's not the
easiest either. Although it took
only 15 minutes to drive by
Woodside Road, it took us an
other 15 minutes to locate the
restaurant. The two people from
whom we asked directions could
do little more than point us in the
right direction. But after arriving
we were glad we made the effort.
Tung Yan is a small Chinese
restaurant tucked away on 593
Woodside, just a few blocks off El
Camino Real in Redwood City.
From the outside, Tung Yan
looks pleasant, but otherwise un
distinctive. It is the inside that
sets the mood for the brilliantly
executed meal to come.
A smiling man in a polo-style
shirt greeted us at the door and
led us into a room pleasantly
decorated with gold-framed
Chinese prints hanging on the
subtle blue walls and large, leafy
plants" that hung in the corners.
We were seated at one of many
tables for two, and immediately
the casual elegance of Tung Yan
was apparent. The air was filled
with classical music that wafted
down from hidden speakers
above. The table setting followed
the dictates of Emily Posfs eti
quette with one addition: dis
played prominently next to the
silverware was a pair of
chopsticks. The presence of £oth
chopsticks and silverware was just
one of the many courtesies ex
tended by the staff of Tung Yan.
The previous day, we had or
dered Peking Duck ($24 for two).
An hour or two after making
reservations, we received a call
from the restaurant explaining
the importance of arriving on
time to ensure the best tasting
duck possible.
Soon after we were seated, we

ordered egg rolls ($2.50) and
were handed an extensive list of
sensibly priced wines. Ten
minutes later we were served two
egg rolls stuffed with delicious
beef and vegetables.
Soon after we finished the last
bites of the egg rolls, the first of
our three courses was brought out

for our viewing — Tung Yan
serves a three-course duck dinner
for the same price charged for
Peking Duck alone at many other
Chinese restaurants. A golden
brown duck, head and all, was
proudly paraded before our eyes.
A few minutes later, the duck was
brought out again, this time sliced
and ready to be rolled and eaten.
Imagine juicy pieces of tender
duck meat rolled into a paper
thin pancake with fresh onion and
a thick, sweet hoisin sause —
that's Tung Yan's Peking Duck. It

was delicious.
The next course was a combi
nation of shredded beef, celery,
carrots and Chinese black mush
rooms known as Spicy Beef
($6.50 as an entree on the menu).
This spicy dish was the perfect
complement to a rich dish like
duck.

Our final course was Duck
Soup, a mixture of duck meat,
tofu and Chinese mushrooms in a
broth. The soup was rich and deli
cious, though a little too oily for
our tastes.
Despite the fact that we had
stuffed ourselves on Tung Yan's
large portions, we ordered
Apples Flambe (rum instead of
brandy and absolutely mouth
watering) and creamy Mango ice
cream from Tung Yan's not-so-
Chinese dessert menu. While we
ate our desserts, we flipped

through the menu. Tung Yan of
fers quite a wide variety of
Chinese foods. The menu boasts
soups such as Tung Yan Soup
(shark's fin and bird's nest combi
nation, $4.75) and Peking Soup
with bamboo shoots and sliced
chicken ($3.50); seafoods such as
Shrimps in Spicy Sauce ($7.50)

and Shanghai Style Prawns
($8.50); and poultry such as
Chicken in Imperial Sauce
($5.75). In addition, it offers
delicacies such as Peking Lamb
($9) and the Traditional Peking
Fire Pot ($12.50/ person), an as
sortment of sliced seafoods, beef,
poultry and pork in your choice of
sauce, and cooked at your table
— we're going back for this. Tung
Yan also serves everyone's favor
ite Chinese dishes: Sum Yung
Man (Y5,000), Mu Shu Pork
($5), Sweet and Sour Shrimp

($6.75), Chow Mein ($4.50 and
$5.25) and Fried Rice ($4.50).
Most of the food on Tung
Yan's menu can be conveniently
ordered as take-out, and because
all of the dishes are cooked by
Tung Yan's only chef, they are
undoubtedly as well-prepared as

those dishes eaten on the
premises.
By the time we said good-bye
to our waiter, Tung Yan's effi
cient and friendly service, quiet
atmosphere, tasty food and
reasonable prices stood out in our
minds. After leaving the restau
rant, however, we did note a area
where Tung Yan could improve
— it could move even closer to
Stanford.
