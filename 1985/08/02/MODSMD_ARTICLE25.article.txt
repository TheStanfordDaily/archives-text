## Students appear to be more religious Chapel dean calls it national trend 
### JAMES LIN 
"There's no question that for a large
number of the American people, religion is
entertainment."
Robert Hamerton-Kelly, dean of the
chapel, smiles slightly in saying this,
aware of the provocative nature of his
assertion. Sitting comfortably in the
Round Room of Memorial Church,
Hamerton-Kelly acknowledges that there
has been a revival of interest in religion,
but admits that he does not really know
why.
"I think that it has something to do with
the same forces that elected Ronald
Reagan president," he said. But, he added,
"I'm not sure what those forces are."
Attendance at church services has in
creased in the past few years, according to
Hamerton-Kelly, who cited large numbers
at Catholic Masses that are held at the
church each Sunday. Other groups on
campus are also flourishing.
"Religious organizations are of the larg
est student organizations," he said. The
Jewish B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundation
reports a growing, active community of
1,500, which includes students, faculty and
other members of the University community.
Defining and identifying a religious
revival, however, proves not to be so
simple as noticing larger numbers of Sun
day or Friday worshippers. Student Or
ganization Services in Tresidder records 16
registered student religious organizations,
from the Persian Zoroastrians Organiza
tion to the Latter Day Saints Student Asso
ciation. While some of these groups report
growth in their numbers, others may not.
Religious Studies Prof. Edwin Good
contends that the apparent phenomenon of
a religious revival is something that comes
' » .

and goes in cycles. "It's an odd thing that
seems to happen — or is perceived to hap
pen — every few years."
Good, who has been at Stanford for 28
years, does not credit the claims that Stan
ford students are returning to religion with
any unusual intensity.
"I don't see anything that persuades me
unambiguously that people are more inter
ested than they were 10 or 15 years ago,"
he said. Good added that although there
has been "terrifically high enrollments in
courses in Eastern religions," much of that
is a result of the Stanford distribution re
quirement in a non-Western civilization.
Students who take courses in religion, he
noted, are not always those who place a
high priority on religion in their personal
lives.
Students, too, are divided in their obser
vations of a possible renewal of interest in
religion on campus. While those who are
personally involved in Stanford religious
activities or groups seem to agree that stu
dents here are showing more concern with
religious matters, others on campus have
not noticed such a movement.
"I don't notice a religious revival," said
sophomore Don Williams, who empha
sized that he also did not see a lack of reli
gion on campus. Williams said he noticed
that the church services were well liked, but
said he was not aware of an overt return to
religion at Stanford.
Libby Carlson, a Fuller Seminary stu
dent who has been working with Christians
on campus for the past year, sees a definite
growth in the number of students who are
re-evaluating their attitudes toward their
faith.

Attendance at Memorial Church has been increasing lately due to an apparent rise in stu
dent interest in religion.
