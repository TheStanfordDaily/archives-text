## Students lean to humanities 
### JENNY KUAN 
The 1984 graduating class
earned more credit in the
humanities than in any other
field, according to a study just
released by Stanford research
ers.
The study, compiled by the
Registar's Office, concluded
that 28 percent of the credit
earned by the 1984 graduating
class was in the humanities.
Natural sciences was second
with 22 percent, followed by
the social sciences with 20, en
gineering with 9 percent, inter
departmental programs with 7
and earth sciences with 3.
The report also contains sta
tistics on the 10 most popular
majors. Economics, biological
sciences and human biology
tied for first, followed by En
glish, electrical engineering,
political science, history, in
dustrial engineering, interna
tional relations and psychol
ogy-
The data was compiled by
Damodharan Namboothiri, a
statistical analyst in the
Registrar's Office, in the an
nual statistical study of the cur
riculum of undergraduate
degree recipients. Namboothiri
pointed out that "although
people have been moving away
from humanities majors, the
trend of taking more
humanities credit is continu
ing.
Registrar Sally Mahoney,
who along with Herant
Katchadourian began the
studies in 1976, asserted that
there are at least two factors
that might be influencing the
statistics.

First, according to Mahoney,
the number of units for
humanities and social sciences
courses are typically greater
than the number of units given
for natural sciences and engi
neering courses. Second, Uni
versity distribution require
ments such as writing, foreign
language, Western and non-
Western culture may have al
tered the statistics in favor of
the humanites, she said.
"The intent of the study is to
improve institutional decision
making by generating a sys
tematic report of what students
are really doing in the curricu
lum," Mahoney said.
Such a retroactive look at
graduating classes reveals cur
ricular choices and patterns
that are necessary for review
ing academic programs. The
most common instance of such
program reviews is the West
ern Culture requirement,
which was first implemented
with the graduating class of
1984.
Another goal of the study is
to reveal the clientele of the
various departments and pro
grams by determining what
kinds of classes students take
outside their majors.
The study also contains in
formation on participation in
intercollegiate athletics, stop
ping out, graduate school plans
and honors achievement. For
example, the statistics indi
cated there was no correlation
between athletics participation
and graduate school applica
tion or honors distinctions.
