Petroleum products have been
detected in the soil at four sites
near Stanford underground
storage tanks. In one case, gas
odors have been detected in
ground water, according to recent
tests.
The testing comes as result of a
bill that Assemblyman Byron
Sher (D-Palo Alto) authored fol
lowing the discovery of ground
water contamination in areas of
Santa Clara County, principally
San Jose and Silicon Valley. In
December 1981, underground
tanks in south San Jose leaked
hazardous materials that con
taminated private drinking wells.
Testing on campus began in
July, in response to a county or-

dinance requiring the monitoring
of underground tanks. Jennifer
Gates, hazardous materials spe
cialist with Stanford's Depart
ment of Health and Safety, said,
"We suspect there's been a
release from the tanks, but we
don't have any analytical data yet,
so we're not sure."
Based on preliminary tests, "it
looks like" the University may
have some contaminated ground
water, according to Wane
Schneiter, spokesman for Aqua
Terra Technologies. Aqua Terra
Technologies, based in Pleasant
Hill, is checking the University's
tanks, and has discovered poten
tial problems at several sites, in
cluding the Central Energy
