# Stanford tanks may be leaking
## 
### MARSH McCALL Editorial staff 
Petroleum products have been
detected in the soil at four sites
near Stanford underground
storage tanks. In one case, gas
odors have been detected in
ground water, according to recent
tests.
The testing comes as result of a
bill that Assemblyman Byron
Sher (D-Palo Alto) authored fol
lowing the discovery of ground
water contamination in areas of
Santa Clara County, principally
San Jose and Silicon Valley. In
December 1981, underground
tanks in south San Jose leaked
hazardous materials that con
taminated private drinking wells.
Testing on campus began in
July, in response to a county or-

dinance requiring the monitoring
of underground tanks. Jennifer
Gates, hazardous materials spe
cialist with Stanford's Depart
ment of Health and Safety, said,
"We suspect there's been a
release from the tanks, but we
don't have any analytical data yet,
so we're not sure."
Based on preliminary tests, "it
looks like" the University may
have some contaminated ground
water, according to Wane
Schneiter, spokesman for Aqua
Terra Technologies. Aqua Terra
Technologies, based in Pleasant
Hill, is checking the University's
tanks, and has discovered poten
tial problems at several sites, in
cluding the Central Energy
Facility, Ginzton Laboratory and
the Mechanical Engineering
courtyard off Panama Street.
Gates emphasized that even in
cases in which ground water has
been contaminated, the chances
of drinking contaminated water
are extremely slight.
"Ground water reaches 45
feet," Gates said, "and we take
(drinking) water from 400 to 600
feet." A layer of clay lying under
neath ground water makes fur
ther contamination difficult, she
said.
"A high percentage of tested
tanks in the San Francisco region
have had leaks," Schneiter
said."The purpose of the new
regulations is to ensure that leaks

are detected and contained."
As many as 80 cases of tank
leakage have been reported in
Santa Clara County, according to
Tom Iwanura, an engineering
geologist for the Santa Clara Val
ley Water District. Iwanura spe
cifically cited spills at Intel in
Mountain View and Hewlett
Packard in Deer Creek.
"Old tanks eventually leak,"
Iwanura said. "Statistically, the
average life of a tank is eight or
nine years."
Gates said the University is
"doing things above and beyond
the call of duty," regarding test
ing of underground tanks on
campus. "We're testing closed
(abandoned) tanks," Gates said.
"That's not required."
Gates explained that, as re
quired by the county ordinance,
tanks installed in the future will
either be constructed above
ground or be "double-walled"
with a detection system after the
first wall. The soil and ground
water surrounding old tanks will
be tested with special monitoring
wells, she said.
Jill Cornwell, environmental
health specialist for Santa Clara
County, said the University has
been "very up-front" in dealing

with the tank problem. "The Uni
versity's future plans depend on
what is found," she said.
Testing, inspections and the is
suing of permits in the Palo Alto
area are being conducted by the
Palo Alto Fire Department. Act
ing Fire Inspector Rich Bauler
said the responsiblity for leaky
tanks in the Palo Alto area lies
with the owner of the tank.
Bauler said many existing tanks
belong to individuals who opted
to store their own fuel during the
oil crisis, but said the Sher bill,
coupled with the resulting county
ordinance requiring testing and
repairing of faulty tanks has con
vinced most owners that "it's not
worth the hassle."
When questioned about inci
dents of leaky tanks or ground
water contamination in the Palo
Alto area, Bauler said that spe
cific instances could not be
revealed because of possible
court litigation.
All sources, however, acknowl
edged that the Santa Clara or
dinance represents a safe and
reliable solution to the problem
of ground water contamination.
"Santa Clara County super
cedes the requirements of the
Sher Bill," Iwamura said.
