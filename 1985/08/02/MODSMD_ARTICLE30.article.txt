## Baseball strike Ueberroth to enter talks 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Commissioner Peter
Ueberroth said yesterday that he will offer his own
proposals to negotiators in an effort end the impasse
in baseball contract talks, and he urged an extension
of next Tuesday's strike deadline.
Ueberroth said his proposals would be submitted
this morning and will include a request that play
continue beyond the deadline while an effort is
made to settle the most serious issue, the owners'
contribution to the pension plan.
Ueberroth said his proposals came from sugges
tions offered by fans, private consultants and his
"own ideas."
Players have asked for a $45 million annual in
crease in the pension contribution. Ueberroth sug
gested the two sides place the $45 million difference
in escrow while a figure is negotiated for 1985.
"They could set a date, any date they agreed on,
then set a 45-day period in which to discuss the
item," Ueberroth said. "But there needs to be a
penalty. So $1 million a day would be taken out for
each day they bargain. They would be bargaining
for a lesser amount each day."
Whatever was removed from the escrow fund
would be given to amateur baseball, he said.
Ueberroth asked at the same time for owners to
"drop any discussion of a salary cap."
He also said his plan would require owners to
make any pension settlement retroactive to 1984
and to stop asking players to help solve baseball's
financial problems.

Ueberroth then said he would ask owners to
begin negotiating a pension contribution over the
next five years "from a low of a 50 percent increase
to a top of an increase of 100 percent."
In return, owners would ask some revisions in
salary arbitration, Ueberroth said. Under the com
missioner's proposal, a player would need three
rather than two years service to qualify and any ar
bitrator's award would be limited to 100 percent of
the players' current salary.
He also said his arbitration plan contained a
"superstar clause" which would allow top name
players such as Dwight Gooden or Wade Boggs to
ask for and receive any amount in arbitration.
Ueberroth said he had other proposals which
"contain a lot of detail, and I want both sides to see
them before they are released."
Ueberroth reiterated that he was acting as a
"fan's commissioner" and that he wanted to do all
that he could to prevent a strike.
With only five days left before the strike deadline,
Ueberroth said he did not come forward with a pro
posal earlier because it would have been
"detrimental to the process. These people have
been working very hard for eight months. Also, I
can't take either position. I don't believe in either of
their positions."
Bowie Kuhn, commissioner during the 1981
strike, was criticized for not getting involved in
those negotiations.
