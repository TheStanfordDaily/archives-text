SAN FRANCISCO(AP) —
A San Francisco real estate
developer said yesterday he
has an agreement with San
Francisco Giants owner Bob
Lurie to buy a majority interest
in the team — if a new down
town stadium is built.
"Between the two of us, we
have a proposal that we think
could work, but there are many
pieces out of our control," said
Peter Stocker. "If everything
came to pass according to my
best wishes, at some point in
time I would expect to be able
to acquire a controlling inter
est."
"Lurie and Stocker have
reached an agreement in prin
ciple," said team spokesman
Corey Busch. "But there is a
lot more to be worked out. The
team has not been sold."
Stocker, who heads the
* Pacific Union Co., a major real
estate developer, presented a
plan this spring for a privately
financed open-air stadium near
Rincon Hill in a bid to keep
Lurie from selling the team to
interests in another city.

His plan, which included a
hotel and a shopping mall, was
praised by Mayor Dianne
Feinstein and other city
leaders.
Stocker said he plans to raise
the $70 to $100 million needed
to build the stadium privately
and has said he will also raise
money by long-term rental of
luxury boxes and special
seating.
Stocker said his proposal
may die soon unless top city of
ficials, including Feinstein,
start backing him against
housing developers competing
for his proposed stadium site,
an 8.5 acre parcel in South
Beach. The property is owned
by Ellis Jacobs, president of
Pacific Pipe Co.
Stocker said he is in a bid
ding war against General At
lantic Corp., a developer plan
ning 841 apartments on the
property, which is valued at
$15 million to $20 million.
Stocker said he met with
Jacobs on Wednesday, but
reached no deal for the land.
