Daily Terror softball has lost three of its four in
tramural games this season, all in different ways.
The most recent loss, however, was the hardest to
swallow. Wednesday, Daily Terror didn't lose nor
mally, like last week. Nor did it lose by the 10-run
rule, as it did in the first week of the season.
It lost by forfeit. Seven players are required to

start a game. On Wednesday, only six showed up.
Besides ruining the moral integrity of the no-shows
(we won't name names, Mike, Paul, Tracy, Mike
again, Todd, Mike a third time), it also ruined The
Daily's playoff chances.
But Daily Terror still has its pride. (Pride may be
the only thing The Daily has left to play for.) And
pride, defined in Daily terms, means that a full team
shows up this Wednesday for the season finale.
