# SOSA's new demands
## 'Wine should be tried by Judicial Council' 
### MARK ZEIGLER Editorial staff 
An affiliation of SOSA (Stanford Out of South
Africa) has formed a loose coalition with two
other campus groups and yesterday released a
new set of demands on University President
Donald Kennedy and the University as a whole.
Many of the members of SOSA, which organ
ized a rally and subsequent march to Kennedy's
office last Friday, have joined with USW (United
Stanford Workers) and SCAAN (Stanford
Central America Action Network) to publish a
two-page "escalation of demands" that the coali
tion plans to give to Kennedy in one way or an
other.
The demands were issued late last night, and
no University officials could be contacted for
comment.
"We have gone on the offensive and escalated
our demands," the statement reads. "We not
only want total divestment, but also total
democracy.

"We are positive that if Stanford was a demo
cratic institution, the outcome of decisions con
cerning divestment . . . and many other issues
which affect students would be different," it con
tinues.
David Romo, a spokesman for SOSA and the
yet-to-be named coalition, said one alternative
the group is seriously considering is a silent
march beginning in White Plaza and ending at
Kennedy's office. However, Romo added that a
date for such a march has not been set, only
saying it would be "in the coming weeks."
The two-page statement released to The Daily
yesterday includes three main demands:
"immediate divestment from all companies that
do business in apartheid, . . . that the decision
making body at Stanford be composed of repre
sentative bodies of the Stanford community,
[and] . . . that volunteer faculty/student research
teams be funded by the (Stanford) administration
to go to South Africa and bring
back a report of their experi
ence."
The statement also accuses the
University administration, specif
ically Kennedy's office, of not
acting in accordance with its own
rules when dealing with the South
Africa protestors last Friday.
In addition, it calls for the Stan
ford Judicial Council to try Mar
lene Wine, special assistant to
Kennedy, for her treatment of the
protesters last Friday when they
arrived at the President's Office.
"Since Marlene Wine obvi
ously obstructed our legal move
ment, we feel she should be tried
by the Stanford Judicial Council
for breaking the University

(Fundamental) Standard."
Wine, backed by two Stanford
policemen, did not allow the
protesters entrance to the Presi
dent's Office last Friday, telling
them that only people with ap
pointments could enter. Four
Stanford students then requested
appointments, which were
granted.
However, the coalition claims
in its statement, "We students
have a right to be in a public of
fice which our tuition contributes
to."
The statement also takes a
direct shot at Kennedy, who Wine
said was not on campus during
the last week's protest.
"We feel that the president
should come out of hiding and
have the backbone to accept re
sponsibility for his decision to bar
his office from public access."
