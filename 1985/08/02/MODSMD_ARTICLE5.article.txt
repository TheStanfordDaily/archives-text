# Stanford shuttle experiments working
## News 
### REBECCA ZEIGLER Staff writer 
After a series of delays ar.d launch diffi
culties, the space shuttle Challenger is fi
nally in flight with Stanford's SUNSTAR
(Stanford University Network for Space
Telescience Applications Research) con
trol lab monitoring the Stanford experi
ments aboard.
"Other than causing us to work a little
harder in order to plan out the timeline to
coordinate facilities, there have been few
negative effects on the actual experi
ments," said Mike Wiskerchen, director of
SUNSTAR. "So far, the experiments
themselves have been very successful."
The shuttle lost power in one of its three
main booster engines after blast off Tues
day, causing a 30-minute launch delay and
a lower-than-planned orbit.
Challenger has been circling the earth in
an orbit 195 miles high, 46 miles lower
than originally planned. The lower orbit
has altered the revolution time and conse
quently has required complete resheduling.
Stanford graduate student Farhad Pezes
higi worked for about 12 hours to match

SUNSTAR's computer-aided-engineering
(CAE) machine — which displays the
ground track of the shuttle — with the new
orbit.
NASA engineers are evaluating the
amount of energy propellant left on board
the Challenger and investigating the possi
bility of raising the orbit between eight and
10 miles. A higher orbit would enhance
the data gathered by a device studying the
abundance of helium in the sun.
Yesterday morning, Peter Banks of
Stanford and Donald Gurnett of the Uni
versity of lowa held a press conference at
Johnson Space Center in Houston about
the Challenger's findings thus far. Accord
ing to Wiskerchen, "They were ecstatic
about [Tuesday] night's experiments. They
saw some things that have never been done
before."
These findings involve the VCAP
(vehicle charging and potential) experi
ment, an effort involving Stanford inves
tigators Banks and Roger Williamson. The

lenger's launch difficulties do not appear to be as bad as expected.
bolts of electron energy which
flash in the energy field of large
stars, including the sun.
The delays in the schedule have
caused the shuttle to fly during a
full moon, which translates into
more unwanted light for the Stan
ford VCAP experiment that
measures visual glows.
At 5 p.m. Tuesday, the Univer
sity of lowa's Plasma Diagnostic
Package satellite was released
from the shuttle bay simul
taneosly with the VCAP electron
beam firing. The shuttle backed
about 200 feet away from the
satellite and circled it.
"This was the first significant
contribution to the problem of
how electron beams propagate
long distances," Wiskerchen said.
"We are using the ionosphere like
a lab to generate clues to what is
happening with nature in deep
space."

Originally, the Challenger was
scheduled to make three orbits
around the lowa satellite. But be
cause of energy conservation
measures necessitated by the
engine burnout Monday, the
shuttle only orbited it twice.
"To replace the loss of the third
orbit, they developed a new,
unique experiment," Wiskerchen
said. The added experiment
allows the Challenger to investi
gate its own wake as it travels
through the ionosphere and also
during electron beam firings.
Wiskerchen compared the
shuttle's wake to that of a boat in
the water. "The only real differ
ence from water is that ions make
it react differently," he said.
"Therefore on the boundaries of
the wake come a number of dif
ferent phenomena, radio waves
and funny particle distributions."
The SUNSTAR lab, located on
the third floor of the Durand
Building, was set up to test the
possibility of having scientists
control shuttle experiments from

their home bases, rather than
journeying to a NASA facility.
Stanford, along with Utah State
University, has 14 people, most
of them graduate students, at the
Johnson Space Center in Houston
actually operating the experi
ments.
The Bosch FGS4OOO, a com
plex computer animation system
housed in the SUNSTAR lab and
shared by various Stanford
services and projects, is not being
used on this mission. "To use it
(the Bosch) as a specific engi
neering tool," Wiskerchen said,
"we must design an interface that
is computer controlled.
"It will take six to eight months
to develop the Bosch into an en
gineering research tool that can
take live data and use it to control
the animation," he continued.
"Right now it is only a television
animation tool. [To ready the
Bosch for use in future shuttle
flights] is one goal SUNSTAR
can look forward to in the
future."

Wiskerchen compared the
shuttle's wake to that of a boat in
the water. "The only real differ
ence from water is that ions make
it react differently," he said.
"Therefore on the boundaries of
the wake come a number of dif
ferent phenomena, radio waves
and funny particle distributions."
The SUNSTAR lab, located on
the third floor of the Durand
Building, was set up to test the
possibility of having scientists
control shuttle experiments from

their home bases, rather than
journeying to a NASA facility.
Stanford, along with Utah State
University, has 14 people, most
of them graduate students, at the
Johnson Space Center in Houston
actually operating the experi
ments.
The Bosch FGS4OOO, a com
plex computer animation system
housed in the SUNSTAR lab and
shared by various Stanford
services and projects, is not being
used on this mission. "To use it
(the Bosch) as a specific engi
neering tool," Wiskerchen said,
"we must design an interface that
is computer controlled.
"It will take six to eight months
to develop the Bosch into an en
gineering research tool that can
take live data and use it to control
the animation," he continued.
"Right now it is only a television
animation tool. [To ready the
Bosch for use in future shuttle
flights] is one goal SUNSTAR
can look forward to in the
future."
