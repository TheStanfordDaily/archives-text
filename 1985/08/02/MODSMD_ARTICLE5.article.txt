# Stanford shuttle experiments working

After a series of delays ar.d launch diffi
culties, the space shuttle Challenger is fi
nally in flight with Stanford's SUNSTAR
(Stanford University Network for Space
Telescience Applications Research) con
trol lab monitoring the Stanford experi
ments aboard.
"Other than causing us to work a little
harder in order to plan out the timeline to
coordinate facilities, there have been few
negative effects on the actual experi
ments," said Mike Wiskerchen, director of
SUNSTAR. "So far, the experiments
themselves have been very successful."
The shuttle lost power in one of its three
main booster engines after blast off Tues
day, causing a 30-minute launch delay and
a lower-than-planned orbit.
Challenger has been circling the earth in
an orbit 195 miles high, 46 miles lower
than originally planned. The lower orbit
has altered the revolution time and conse
quently has required complete resheduling.
Stanford graduate student Farhad Pezes
higi worked for about 12 hours to match

SUNSTAR's computer-aided-engineering
(CAE) machine — which displays the
ground track of the shuttle — with the new
orbit.
NASA engineers are evaluating the
amount of energy propellant left on board
the Challenger and investigating the possi
bility of raising the orbit between eight and
10 miles. A higher orbit would enhance
the data gathered by a device studying the
abundance of helium in the sun.
Yesterday morning, Peter Banks of
Stanford and Donald Gurnett of the Uni
versity of lowa held a press conference at
Johnson Space Center in Houston about
the Challenger's findings thus far. Accord
ing to Wiskerchen, "They were ecstatic
about [Tuesday] night's experiments. They
saw some things that have never been done
before."
These findings involve the VCAP
(vehicle charging and potential) experi
ment, an effort involving Stanford inves
tigators Banks and Roger Williamson. The
experiment duplicates on a small scale the

Things at the SUNSTAR lab are a little more cheery since the problems caused by Chal
lenger's launch difficulties do not appear to be as bad as expected.
