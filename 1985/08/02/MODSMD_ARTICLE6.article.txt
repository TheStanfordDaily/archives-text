## House votes anti-apartheid measures 
### 
WASHINGTON — The House gave overwhelm
ing approval yesterday to compromise legislation
imposing economic sanctions against the white
minority government of South Africa, but conserva
tive Republican opposition in the Senate delayed a
final vote until after a one-month congressional
recess.
The House voted 380-48 to adopt the plan, which
would ban the importation of South African gold
coins into the United States and impose other lim
ited sanctions in a bid to pressure Pretoria into al
tering discriminatory practices against the black
majority.
But the best that frustrated supporters could do in
the Senate was a 97-0 showing on a test vote, a roll
call rendered meaningless when opponents voted
with backers of the sanctions.
The congressional action unfolded in an atmos
phere of uncertainty over President Reagan's inten
tions. Reagan opposes sanctions, and while congres
sional sources said the administration had spread
the word that he would veto the measure, White
House officials said no decision had been made.
In the House, liberals and conservatives made a
joint plea urging the president to sign the measure.
But in the Senate, conservatives threatened a
filibuster, and Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) objected
three times as Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.)
sought a final vote before the beginning of the
recess.
"There is a great deal of doubt that this will help a
nation in trouble," said Sen. Malcolm Wallop. (R-
Wyo.). He denounced the measure as ' racist pan
dering and meandering in an effort to do what looks
good to the public."
The measure, written against a backdrop of a
white crackdown against majority blacks in South
Africa and rising anger in Congress, would ban the
importation of Kruggerand gold coins for sale in the
United States. It also would prohibit loans to the
South African government and block the large-scale
sale of computer materials to the Pretoria govern
ment.
The bill would limit exports of nuclear goods to
South Africa, although it would permit U.S. corpo
rations to make new investment in the country.
The measure represents a virtual repudiation of
Reagan's no-sanctions policy of "constructive en
gagement" in South Africa. At the White House,
spokesman Larry Speakes said the president would
make no decision on the measure, the product of a
House-Senate conference committee, until it
reaches his desk.
"There are a number of complaints we have
about the bill," Speakes told reporters.
Later, however, congressional sources who asked
not to be identified by name said White House aides
were signaling Reagan's intention to veto the mea
sure. Those reports drew a quick denial at the White
House.
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger also
argued against sanctions, telling The Associated
Press that the United States cannot afford "any
more enemies."
"We are not in a position to make any more
enemies as far as countries are concerned. We need
all the help, all the friends, all the alliances we can
put together," Weinberger said.
