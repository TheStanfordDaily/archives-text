JOHANNESBURG, South Africa â€”
Bishop Desmond Tutu quieted tensions
at a funeral for black riot victims yester
day, persuading police to withdraw and
angry mourners to be calm.
But the Nobel Peace Prize winner also
pledged to defy funeral restrictions
proclaimed by the white government. "I
listen to God, not any other authority,"
he said. "I will continue to speak at all
meetings, responsibly, as a minister."
National police headquarters in
Pretoria reported rioting in 10 black com
munities, with 60 people arrested in at
least 19 incidents of arson and stone
throwing Wednesday night and yesterday
morning. Witnesses said police shot and
wounded a 17-year-old youth in Soweto,
the vast black township outside Johan
nesburg, when they fired on 700 people
trying to loot a bread truck.
The restrictions that took effect Wed
nesday prohibit group and outdoor
funerals for people killed in the year of
racial unrest that has cost an estimated
500 black lives.
Witnesses said Tutu personally
imposed calm on an explosive situation in
Tumahole, a riot-torn black township
near Parys, 62 miles south of Johannes
burg. At his urging, police withdrew from
the path of the funeral procession, and he
told the 1,000 mourners: "For goodness
sake, let us stop doing things we're going
to be ashamed of!"
Police said Tutu's remarks and the fu
neral, for three youths killed in a clash
with police after another funeral two
weeks ago, did not violate the rules be
cause Tumahole is not in an emergency
area. It was held in a community hall.

Under the new restrictions, decreed
under the state of emergency put into
force July 21 in 36 towns and cities, only
ordained ministers may speak and they
may not mention politics.
Tutu said later that he would speak
next Tuesday at the funeral of riot victims
in Daveyton, a township near Johannes
burg that is in an emergency area.
Recent outdoor services have drawn as
many as 50,000 mourners. Many have
been followed by clashes between police
and angry crowds protesting apartheid,
the legalized system of race discrimina
tion South Africa's 5 million whites use to
control the voteless black majority of 24
million.
Police said two suspected guerrillas and
a black policeman were killed in a
shootout Wednesday on a road near East
London, an Indian Ocean port. The
report said two suspects and a policeman
were wounded and many weapons were
seized.
Police said they have detained 1,329
people without charge under emergency
regulations and have released 47 of them.
In Helsinki, Finland, foreign ministers
of the 10 Common Market countries
agreed to recall their ambassadors for
consultations to protest apartheid. The
foreign ministers were in Helsinki for the
10th anniversary of the Helsinki accords
on European security and cooperation.
The United States withdrew its ambas
sador June 14 to protest a South African
raid on alleged guerrilla strongholds in
neighboring Botswana. France called its
envoy home last week and banned new
French investment here.
