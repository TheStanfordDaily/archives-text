# Weinberger opposes sanctions

WASHINGTON — Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger,
asserting that the United States
cannot afford "any more
enemies," said yesterday that
economic sanctions weakening
the government of South Africa
could lead to an even worse
regime — even one as bad as
Iran.
"We are not in a position to
make any more enemies as far as
countries are concerned,"
Weinberger said in a wide
ranging interview with The Asso
ciated Press. "We need all the
help, all the friends, all the al
liances we can put together."
"I've always tried to take the
position that we certainly do not
want to do anything to perpetuate
conditions that we abhor," the
secretary said. "But we do have
to look at alternatives. And I al
ways keep going back to Iran,
where some people a few years
ago thought the shah was a very
repressive ruler and had a very
repressive regime, and paid no at
tention whatever to the alterna
ves that would flow from not
supporting him.
"And as a result, we have the
most repressive government since
the Middle Ages. And that could
have been avoided, in my
opinion."
Looking relaxed and denying
he had any plans to leave office,
Weinberger addressed reports
that Salvadoran officials had con
tradicted his claim on Wednesday
of a successful retaliatory strike
against the guerrillas who he said
were responsible for the June 19
killing of six Americans in a San
Salvador cafe.
"I think the confusion seems to
have been (the suggestion) that I
was identifying a particular per
son who pulled the trigger and
was now dead or something,"
Weinberger said. "And that was
not the case and not intended to
be.
"In this situation, this small
group of guerrillas had been lo
cated by the El Salvador regulars.
We helped them with intelli
gence. And they went in and in
the course of a sweep operation
managed to be very effective in
killing and capturing several
members of this group. And this
was the group — they're satisfied
and we're satisfied — which had
killed the Marines in San Sal
vador."
