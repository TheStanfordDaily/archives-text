# FBI arrests 6 in Iran missile scam
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Six people, including
two men from the Bay Area and an Army
officer assigned to the Pentagon, were ar
rested on charges of conspiring to export
arms to Iran in violation of a U.S. govern
ment ban on such sales, the FBI announced
yesterday.
The arrests stemmed from a bureau un
dercover operation in which an agent iden
tified as "UCA" met at various intervals
between March 11 and July 31 with several
of the principals involved in the alleged
scheme.
Among those arrested were Paul Sjek
locha, 47, of San Jose, also known as Paul
Cutter, a publisher and author of articles
on military science and technology;
George Neranchi of Los Altos; and Lt.
Col. Wayne Gillespie, 46, of Alexandria,
Va.
The FBI alleged that Gillespie had in
spected TOW anti-tank missiles destined
for Iran.
"There were over 1,300 missiles on the
shopping list. The total value, if everything
was obtained, was about $75 million," said

Dick Ross, an assistant FBI special agent in
the Tampa-Orlando, Fla., district.
In the affidavit filed in federal court in
Orlando, the FBI said agents had been told
Gillespie was assigned to the Army's
Missile Command at the Pentagon.
But Defense Department spokesman
Fred Hoffman said that was in error.
"Colonel Gillespie is a research and de
velopment coordinator in the office of the
deputy chief of staff for international pro
grams at the Army Materiel Command,"
Hoffman said.
Ray Aponte, a spokesman for the com
mand, said he could not immediately
describe Gillespie's duties or discuss what
security clearances the officer held.
Aponte also said it would take some time
to obtain Gillespie's service record with the
Army.
"This hit us very suddenly," he added.
An FBI official, declining to be identi
fied publicly, said it was not knoWh
whether there was any connection between
the alleged conspiracy to purchase arms for
Iran, revealed yesterday, and the arrests
last month of six people alleged to have

been involved with the shipment to Iran of
stolen U.S. military equipment.
"Federal investigative agencies are con
stantly alert for plots to transfer U.S. tech
nology and arms in violation of our laws,"
Webster said. "We will pursue, without
ceasing, such illegal activities to insure that
violators are brought before the bar of
justice."
The United States banned the export of
military supplies to Iran after religious fun
damentalists led by the Ayatollah Ruhol
lah Khomeini ousted the Shah of Iran in
1979.
Authorities said the alleged conspirators
intended to purchase a variety of U.S.
missiles, including the TOW, the
Sidewinder, Harpoon, Sparrow AIM-7F,
Sparrow AIM-7M and Phoenix. They also
were said to be seeking the French Exocet
missile, as well as miscellaneous parts for
the F-4 jet fighter, including 10 F-4
engines, and other military equipment,
such as a mobile hospital.
The other three arrested were identified
as:
• Fadel Fadel, 54, a Lebanese national en

gaged in the import-export business in
Calabasas, Calif.
• Farhin Sanai, 52, of Calabasas, the wife
of Fadel.
• Amir Hosseni, who has claimed to be an
official of the Iranian government.
The FBI was seeking Charles St. Clair,
50, of Granada Hills, who was believed to
be out of the United States.
In Alexandria yesterday, U.S.
Magistrate W. Curtis Sewell set bond at
$100,000 for Gillespie.
The complaint charges that the six in
tended to purchase 1,140 TOW anti-tank
missiles at a total cost of $9,120,000 and
that they would provide an aircraft to fly
the weapons and parts to Iran. A TOW
missile is a non-nuclear surface-to-surface
ballistic missile used in anti-tank warfare.
The arrests took place in California,
Florida and Virginia, apparently before
any weapons were actually sent to Iran.
The conspiracy charge carries a top
penalty of five years in prison and a
$10,000 fine.
