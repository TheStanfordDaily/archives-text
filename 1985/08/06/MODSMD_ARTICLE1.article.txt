# Playboy cover to be covered
## News 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
Tresidder Union officials have
agreed to attach a letter on the
nature of pornography to the
cover of copies of the October
issue of Playboy magazine sold at
The Store.
The action comes in the wake
of pressure from members of the
campus group Stanford Students
Opposed to Pornography (STOP)
regarding the "Girls of the Pac
-10" pictorial, which will appear in
October's Playboy. That issue is
expected at newsstands Aug. 27.
The pictorial of clothed, topless
and nude women from schools in
the Pacific 10 Conference will ac
company the magazine's annual
college football preview.
The decision to attach the let
ter, which would be signed by
Tresidder officials in conjunction
with STOP, was made by the
Tresidder Product Selection
Guidelines Committee and

released yesterday by University
News Service.
"No, I don't consider it censor
ship," said Ellie Oppenheim, the
director of Tresidder, abput the
decision.
"One of the main things for the
group (guidelines committee) was
the principle of freedom of
choice," Oppenheim said. "The
consumer should have the right to
a selection."
"I think we have an educa
tional goal as well as a service
goal."
Cesar Cervantes, manager of
The Store, said, "What we try to
do is be sensitive to the commu
nity. STOP feels strongly about
The Store selling Playboy.
"We're trying to establish
guidelines. Meanwhile, we have
to address the issue of pornogra
phy, and especially the Pac-10
issue."
