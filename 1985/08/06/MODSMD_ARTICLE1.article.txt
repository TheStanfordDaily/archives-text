# Playboy cover to be covered
## News 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
Tresidder Union officials have
agreed to attach a letter on the
nature of pornography to the
cover of copies of the October
issue of Playboy magazine sold at
The Store.
The action comes in the wake
of pressure from members of the
campus group Stanford Students
Opposed to Pornography (STOP)
regarding the "Girls of the Pac
-10" pictorial, which will appear in
October's Playboy. That issue is
expected at newsstands Aug. 27.
The pictorial of clothed, topless
and nude women from schools in
the Pacific 10 Conference will ac
company the magazine's annual
college football preview.
The decision to attach the let
ter, which would be signed by
Tresidder officials in conjunction
with STOP, was made by the
Tresidder Product Selection
Guidelines Committee and

released yesterday by University
News Service.
"No, I don't consider it censor
ship," said Ellie Oppenheim, the
director of Tresidder, abput the
decision.
"One of the main things for the
group (guidelines committee) was
the principle of freedom of
choice," Oppenheim said. "The
consumer should have the right to
a selection."
"I think we have an educa
tional goal as well as a service
goal."
Cesar Cervantes, manager of
The Store, said, "What we try to
do is be sensitive to the commu
nity. STOP feels strongly about
The Store selling Playboy.
"We're trying to establish
guidelines. Meanwhile, we have
to address the issue of pornogra
phy, and especially the Pac-10
issue."
Playboy officials could not be
reached in Chicago last night.
The controversy over the
"Girls of the Pac-10" pictorial
began in April when Playboy
photographer David Chan took
out an advertisement in The
Daily urging Stanford women
wishing to pose for the feature to
meet with him at the Palo Alto
Holiday Inn, where he stayed.
STOP organized a rally in
White Plaza and placed its own

advertisements in The Daily. It
also boycotted the Holiday Inn,
set up fake interviews with Chan,
and held forums on campus.
Graduate student Vanessa Pos
ter, a member of STOP, led the
effort to have anti-pornography
material attached to the Playboy
copies. "The intention of this pro
posed (now authorized) action is
not to force our opinions onto the
Stanford community," Poster said
in a letter to The Daily, published
Friday. . •
"Selling the magazines without
questioning them says they are
OK."
Cervantes said the decision to

attach the letter was a compro
mise to avert a protest in front of
The Store by STOP, though he
emphasized that Tresidder was not
intimidated by the possibility.
"Their last [statement] was that
if we didn't pull it, there would be
a picket line," Cervantes said.
"We wanted to see it handled in a
more educational manner.
"I told Vanessa what you don't
do is pull the magazines — that's
censorship. What you do do is at
tach a letter to the magazine."
The committee is looking for a
more general policy toward all
pornographic magazines in gen
eral. Currently, Playboy, Playgirl

and Penthouse are the only
magazines The Store sells that are
generally regarded as porno
graphic.
The Store keeps those
magazines behind the counter,
with the cover obscured except
for the magazine title. The com
mittee has also proposed perma
nently posting anti-pornography
literature near the display.
"It's up for debate right now,"
Cervantes said. "I can't commit
myself to doing it all the time."
Oppenheim said, "My sense
was that, as a general premise,
ours ought to be an educational
role, to share a broad spectrum of

views. There very possibly will be
some kind of posting."
Neither Oppenheim nor Cer
vantes said they could remember
a previous instance where The
Store had agreed to attach
literature to a magazine.
Oppenheim brought up a
related incident that occurred
when the anti-apartheid move
ment was getting under way.
"A couple of months ago, we
posted notices from the BSU
(Black Student Union) that called
for a boycott of Coke (Coca-Cola
Company) products in The Store
and the food services." she said.
