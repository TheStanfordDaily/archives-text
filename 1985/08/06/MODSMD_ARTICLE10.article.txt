Reagan had skin cancer
WASHINGTON — In his second brush with
cancer in less than a month, President Reagan
revealed yesterday that tissue removed from his
nose last week was a sun-induced skin cancer, the
most common and easily curable form of the
disease.
Reagan said no further treatment was neces
sary, but added, "I'm told I must not expose
myself to the sun anymore."
The tissue on Reagan's nose — which the pres
ident called a pimple — was removed by a der
matologist at the White House last Tuesday. The
White House did not reveal the procedure until
two days later and then refused to say whether it
had been biopsied or whether it was cancerous.
Dr. Thomas Nigra, chief of the Dermatology
Department at Washington Hospital Center and
a recognized expert in his field, said there was no
relationship between the skin cancer — known as
a "basal cell carcinoma" — and the malignant
tumor removed from the president's colon July
13.

While describing skin cancer as the most com
mon and curable form of the disease, Nigra said
the existence of the disease ''puts you at risk" in
the future. Statistically speaking, one in seven
people who have had skin cancer will get it again
within a year and a half, Nigra said. "The presi
dent needs to be watched, probably on a semi
annual basis, for newly appearing lesions."
Sheffield dismissal halted
JUNEAU, Alaska — The Alaska Senate yes
terday laid to rest a move to impeach Gov. Bill
Sheffield and gutted a resolution saying the
governor did something wrong.
The Senate signaled the impeachment issue
was dead when, without debate, it placed in the
Senate Journal a rules committee report saying
there was insufficent evidence of wrongdoing to
impeach the Democratic governor.
Sheffield, the 15th U.S. governor to undergo
impeachment proceedings, was accused of steer
ing a lease to a political supporter and lying about
it under oath.
