Here's a good excuse for a 10-minute coffee break:
Think about the 40th anniversary of the atomic bombing of
Hiroshima.
Not a very original idea this week, we realize. But we ap
plaud the fact that the national attention being given to the
devastating ending of World War II is mostly centered
around increased awareness of the social ramifications of
nuclear warfare.
Independence Day symbolizes the impending military
triumph of the colonies over British tyranny. D-Day is
remembered proudly as the timely rescueT)f France by the
conquering Americans. It doesn't take too far a stretch of
the imagination to picture our nation celebrating the
bombing of Japan as a final blow to a nation we fought
against for four bloody years in the Pacific, with fireworks
and fierce patriotic speeches.
It is good to think that even the strongest advocate of nu
clear arms would choose to commemorate this event in a
different manner.
Take the time to read accounts of Hiroshima victims that
are currently being published. Put yourself and your family
in that city, at 8:16 a.m., on Aug. 6, 1945.
The reality is this: Today, because of the terrible poten
tial of atomic weapons, nobody anywhere on earth is safe
from a repeat performance.
Today, or any day, it could just as easily be you and your
family in a similar scenario.
So sip some coffee, and think about reality. Support
community assemblage in memory of the event, its victims
and its survivors.
Nuclear war is no more terrible in deed than any conven
tional war in the past. But the end result brings new
meaning to the old lie, "Dulce et decorum est pro patria
mori."
We're glad no one celebrates that fact with fireworks.
