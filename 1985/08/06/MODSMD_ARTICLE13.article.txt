To the Director, Museum of Modern Art, East Palo
Alto:
I wish to present a proposal for an exhibition in
your gallery. The show is titled, ' The Burgland
Gallery: A Retrospective, 1980-1984' and will
outline the philosophy of the Burgland Gallery and
its sole artist
The Burgland Gallery was originally created by
Paul Burgland, the prince of the island which bears
his family name. Burgland is located in the Indian
Ocean, 350 miles southwest of Sri Lanka and is ap
proximately one-half square mile in size; its popula
tion is 69, all living in abject poverty. The principal
industries of Burgland are eggplant farming and
pig raising; as the climate is snowbound the year
round, no eggplants grow and no pigs survive, which
is why the people live in abject poverty. The young
Prince Burgland had the advantage of growing up in
the royal household, which meant he lived in mere
wretched poverty.
This condition remained until five years ago,
when the Soviet Union decided, from its intelligence
reports on the United States, that the island of
Burgland was necessary for the defense of South
Yemen. In six short months, the Burglandians had
the benefits of modern Russian technology, includ
ing a brand new international airport and some of
the worst cartographers in the Eastern hemisphere.
This aid money also allowed the bright young
Prince to apply to and be accepted by the United
States' prestigious Stanford University. But fate is
not kind. The newfound Burgland family fortune
dried up when the Soviets discovered that Burgland
is nowhere near South Yemen. The Prince was
forced to quit school and, with no money for pas
sage home, to live in a dumbwaiter in Lagunita
Court. During the days, he had large periods of free
time, so he drew.
The Prince quickly drew over 20 pictures, varying
wildly in topic and quality, from the ribald abstract
"Cosmic Egg is Thwarted by the Cosmic lUD" to
the more thoughtful portraits of "The Pep Boys:
Manny, Moe and Adolph". In despair, he resorted

to Scotch-taping them to the walls of his beloved li
brary.
Whereupon they were subsequently torched. The
Prince was devastated by the loss; the local newspa
per made the most of this story. In an interview, the
Prince uttered the words which were to fulminate
into the Burgland phiiosophy: "It's too bad. . .but I
guess you have to suffer to create art.'
This seeming resignation became the ultimate
Gallery concept: a Gallery in which anyone could
display their works and a Gallery in which anyone
could tear down any work for any reason.

This show will need no special lighting arrange
ments, nor will it need a catalogue or gallery sitters.
In fact, there are no pictures. During the installation
of the last show, the only surviving picture, "The
Many Worlds of Paul Burgland: Writer, Columnist,
Hero, Pig", was torn down by a worker who
resented pigs. In fact, during the same exhibition, an
outraged citizen, mistaking the Prince for one of his
pictures, fed the monarch-to-be into a paper shred
der.
Though the Gallery no longer has (or has ever
had) any followers, nonetheless this valuable aes
thetic concept must not be forgotten. I am truly
sorry for the brevity of this proposal, but they
insisted on including an egregious photograph of
me, which I suppose doesn't really add anything.
(The length of Tracy (grad, chem) Furutanis column
is monotonically decreasing; strangely, the amount of
white space on the op-ed page is monotonically in
creasing. But it's just a coincidence. Really.)
