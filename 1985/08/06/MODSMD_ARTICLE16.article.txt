Happy Days
I thought you might be mildly
interested in the opinions of an
old Daily staffer about life on the
Farm now, experienced currently
as a National Endowment for the
Humanities summer scholar, as
compared to undergraduate life
here 30 years ago.
Some random observations:
Biggest campus changes: The
plethora of bicycles everywhere.
Why didn't we think of that? My
first class at Stanford was an 8
a.m. MWF folk dancing class at
Roble Gym, and I lived at Bran
ner — think of all the sleep I
could have saved by cycling
across campus!
Males in the girls' dorms, and
vice versa — old Mrs. Flickinger
at Branner would never have
believed it, but it seems to work
fine, and there might even be
fewer food fights. (Please don't
ask me to explain panty-raids. I
don't remember that far back.)
Best campus changes: The
library system. This generation
would find it hard to imagine the
primitive facilities available in
such institutions as the Old
Reserved Book Room, or even
worse, the "temporary" Western
Civ. reserved book "library" that
perched behind Cubberley for
several decades. Imagine it —
libraries with no carpeting, study
carrels, copy machines, easy
chairs, Socrates, etc. On the
other hand, there was a lot of
social life possible sitting at the
long study tables in the old main
reading room (now the rare book
room in Green), scoping out who
came and went. . .
The landscaping all over
campus. This isn't a college, it's a
cross between a park and a
museum. In all kinds of places
where there used to be a few
weeds and some gravel, there is
now a flower bed or a mini-park
with some benches. And why did
it take 100 years to pave the
inner quad? Finally, it looks
great.

Things that haven't changed
much: Memorial Church — even
with Prof. Nanney still filling the
echoing space with organ music;
Branner Hall, comfortably ugly
and familiar; the arched vistas of
the Inner Quad; The Daily,
criticized (and read) by
everybody; the lovely golden
rolling hills behind campus
punctuated with live oaks and
swaths of fog; the excitement of
a good class taught by a first-rate
scholar who really makes an
effort to communicate his/her
knowledge; the overwhelming
beauty of a campus Unique in its
felicitous setting; the secret inner
feeling of wondering "How did I
get lucky enough to be here?"

Eurythmics don't
have soul
I guess Tony James and Dave
Paulson are entitled to their own
opinions about The Eurythmics
("Rough Cuts," Aug. 2), but did
they have to go so far as to claim
that Annie Lennox has "every
bit of the soul that Aretha has"?
Aretha Franklin is our greatest
soul vocalist. I suggest that James
and Paulson run down to their
favorite used record store and
buy one of Aretha's Atlantic
recordings from the '60s if they
can find one. Cue it up and listen
to the power and depth of feeling
in her voice, her exquisite timing,
the way she draws on a rich cul
tural tradition to achieve
profoundly personal expression.
The Eurythmics make good
machine music. It's appealing in
an edgy, hooky way, and you can
dance to it. Annie Lennox's
voice is metallic, as befits ma
chinery. But where Aretha soars,
Annie screeches; where Aretha
swings, Annie clanks. Do the
Eurythmics make good pop
music? Maybe. Is it soulful? Give
me a break.
