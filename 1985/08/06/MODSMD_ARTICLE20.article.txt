# 'Silverado' chokes on own dust
## 
### JOE MADER 
Lawrence Kasdan's new film
western "Silverado" has almost
everything we remember from
our favorite westerns. It's got gor
geous, sweeping, panoramic
cinematography; stirring,
thumpa-thumpa, "Heigh-ho, Sil
ver!" music; and witty, ironic,
self-possessed dialogue.
It's got heroic gunmen who
tangle with corrupt sheriffs and
their deputies; good, kind
hearted farmers who tangle with
evil cattle ranchers; and a young
boy who idolizes the good-guy
gunmen. It's even got a saloon
run by a woman named Stella. It's
got everything, in short, except
the two things it needs most:
some semblance of genuine,
human characterization and some
real reason to exist.
Kasdan apparently produced,
directed and co-wrote the movie
with his brother Mark in order to
show us how much he remembers
of the many westerns he has seen.
He has managed to come up with
a plot that throws together every
cinematic icon ever to have
shown up in a Hollywood west
ern, making no judgments as to
the relative values of the films he
has seen. "Red River," Peckin
pah's "Ride the High Country"
and "High Noon" are tossed in
alongside "Shane" and
"Oklahoma!". Watching every
Western film cliche there is
hurled pell-mell together in one
film, it becomes obvious that Kas
dan wants us to leave the theater
marvelling at how clever he is to
have brought them all together.
This seems to be the primary rea
son the film was made, and it is
not a good enough one.
The script, written by both
Kasdans, contains a plot so con
voluted that it not only serves as a
resting place for all the "classic"
western cliches, but also as a rea
son to throw together all of
Hollywood's "respected" actors
and actresses in one big hoedown.
Emmett (Scott Glenn) has just
been released from Leavenworth,
where he served five years for

shooting the chief cattle rancher
of Silverado in self-defense. (The
only crime the corrupt law of
Kasdan's West punishes is killing
in self-defense. All of the good
guys get jailed for it at one time
or another.) He's on his way to
the town of Turley to pick up his
brother Jake (Kevin Costner),
who unawares to Emmett is
awaiting his own hanging for kil
ling a man in self-defense. They
then plan to journey to Califor
nia, after stopping in Silverado to
say goodbye to their sister and
her family.

On the way Emmett
encounters Paden (Kevin Kline),
who has been left to die in the
desert, robbed of everything but
his red longjohns. They ride to
gether to Turley, where they not
only discover Jake's predicament,
but that of Mai (Danny Glover),
who is being kicked out of town
for the double crime of killing in
self-defense and being black.
After springing Jake, the three of
them are rescued from the
clutches of the posse led by
Sheriff Langston (John Cleese)
through Mai's sharpshooting.
Together, the four of them ride
to Silverado, aiding a wagon train
of farmers along the way, only to
discover the town is ruled by evil

ranchers and corrupt lawmen,
who were also once riding
partners of Paden. In a series of
skirmishes and contrivances, our
heroes, now beginning to
resemble the A-Team of the Old
West, get picked on, get mad,
clean the place up and restore
justice and order to Silverado.
Sheriff Cobb (Brian Dennehy)
and his evil-eyed deputy Tyree
(Jeff Fahey) bite the dust, and the
audience obligingly shouts
"hooray."
The movie begins with a bang,
as Emmett single-handedly kills

three men who are after him, and
there's enough wit to make you
think Kasdan might be able to
carry it off. However, it soon
becomes obvious he has little
control over the material as it
races off in countless subplots and
in a thousand directions at once.
"Silverado" is the western as
rock video: slick and dazzling on
its surface, but nothing of sub
stance or importance underneath.
It doesn't stick with the audience
that laughs and claps while watch
ing it, but has nothing worth
remembering to bring home. Kas
dan's method of advancing the
plot is to bring in Bruce
Broughton's "stirring" music
whenever possible, until it

becomes even more obnoxious
than John Williams' musical bom
basts for "Raiders of the Lost
Ark," "E.T." and "Star Wars."
Kasdan has his characters ride
along to the music, gaze at the
panoramic vistas provided by
cameraman John Bailey, and nod
at each other because he can't fig
ure out what else to do with them.
You can almost hear him asking
as he writes the script, "What do
gunmen doV Occasionally the
four heroes stop at the campfire
for some spare, witty banter, but
then the music starts again and

they're off.
The dialogue is at its worst
when Mai and Stella (Linda
Hunt), the saloon keeper, have to
speak their lines. Both of these
characters are misfits of a sort:
Mai because he's black, Stella be
cause she's a dwarf. Unfortun
ately Kasdan subscribes to the
standard good-Hollywood-liberal
dogma which states that
whenever a long suffering
minority is dealt with, the charac
ter can't be human â€” they have
to be saintly icons. Thus, Glover
as Mai has to say things like
"That ain't right. I've had enough
of what ain't right," and Hunt as
Stella has to say "Good people
are being hurt because of me. . . .

That makes me mad," and"The
world is what you make of it,"
which she has to say twice. The
other characters are icons as well,
but they don't have to utter such
dreadfully sonorous proclama
tions.
None of the actors under Kas
dan's direction seem to be in the
same movie. They are all off
doing their own thing, and none
of them relates to the others. The
only distinguishing thing about
Kevin Kline's very boring perfor
mance is that with a beard he
looks like Robin Williams. Scott
Glenn comes the closest to form
ing a real character, but he's
stifled by the script. Linda Hunt
has the only real moment of act
ing, when she realizes that Cobb
is using her to keep Paden from
helping his friends. As the puppy
like Jake, Kevin Costner is ap
pealing, but sometimes goes over
board. Jeff Goldblum has a funny
presence as Slick, who has some
kind of relationship with Mai's
sister Rae, the strikingly lovely
Lynn Whitfield. (Is it a
pimp/whore relationship? Kasdan
skirts round all of the sex in the
movie like an embarrassed
Puritan, and as a result all of the
relationships between men and
women are confused and murky.)
Brian Dennehy's Cobb is only
allowed an ice-cold smile, which
is better than the malevolent stare
of Jeff Fahey's Tyree. But surely
none of them fare as badly as
Rosanna Arquette in the
ridiculous role of Hannah, who
can only look doe-eyed as she's
passed back and forth from Em
mett to Paden.
"Silverado" has the same
weaknesses as Kasdan's other
films, "Body Heat" and"The Big
Chill." It suffers from surface
slickness and lack of an emotional
center. Kasdan has seen a lot of
movies, but has learned nothing
of characterization from them.
"Silverado" zooms and careens
crazily on screen, but it remains
flat, two-dimensional. It never
takes on a life of its own.

everything we remember from
our favorite westerns. It's got gor
geous, sweeping, panoramic
cinematography; stirring,
thumpa-thumpa, "Heigh-ho, Sil
ver!" music; and witty, ironic,
self-possessed dialogue.
It's got heroic gunmen who
tangle with corrupt sheriffs and
their deputies; good, kind
hearted farmers who tangle with
evil cattle ranchers; and a young
boy who idolizes the good-guy
gunmen. It's even got a saloon
run by a woman named Stella. It's
got everything, in short, except
the two things it needs most:
some semblance of genuine,
human characterization and some
real reason to exist.
Kasdan apparently produced,
directed and co-wrote the movie
with his brother Mark in order to
show us how much he remembers
of the many westerns he has seen.
He has managed to come up with
a plot that throws together every
cinematic icon ever to have
shown up in a Hollywood west
ern, making no judgments as to
the relative values of the films he
has seen. "Red River," Peckin
pah's "Ride the High Country"
and "High Noon" are tossed in
alongside "Shane" and
"Oklahoma!". Watching every
Western film cliche there is
hurled pell-mell together in one
film, it becomes obvious that Kas
dan wants us to leave the theater
marvelling at how clever he is to
have brought them all together.
This seems to be the primary rea
son the film was made, and it is
not a good enough one.
The script, written by both
Kasdans, contains a plot so con
voluted that it not only serves as a
resting place for all the "classic"
western cliches, but also as a rea
son to throw together all of
Hollywood's "respected" actors
and actresses in one big hoedown.
Emmett (Scott Glenn) has just
been released from Leavenworth,
where he served five years for

shooting the chief cattle rancher
of Silverado in self-defense. (The
only crime the corrupt law of
Kasdan's West punishes is killing
in self-defense. All of the good
guys get jailed for it at one time
or another.) He's on his way to
the town of Turley to pick up his
brother Jake (Kevin Costner),
who unawares to Emmett is
awaiting his own hanging for kil
ling a man in self-defense. They
then plan to journey to Califor
nia, after stopping in Silverado to
say goodbye to their sister and
her family.

On the way Emmett
encounters Paden (Kevin Kline),
who has been left to die in the
desert, robbed of everything but
his red longjohns. They ride to
gether to Turley, where they not
only discover Jake's predicament,
but that of Mai (Danny Glover),
who is being kicked out of town
for the double crime of killing in
self-defense and being black.
After springing Jake, the three of
them are rescued from the
clutches of the posse led by
Sheriff Langston (John Cleese)
through Mai's sharpshooting.
Together, the four of them ride
to Silverado, aiding a wagon train
of farmers along the way, only to
discover the town is ruled by evil

ranchers and corrupt lawmen,
who were also once riding
partners of Paden. In a series of
skirmishes and contrivances, our
heroes, now beginning to
resemble the A-Team of the Old
West, get picked on, get mad,
clean the place up and restore
justice and order to Silverado.
Sheriff Cobb (Brian Dennehy)
and his evil-eyed deputy Tyree
(Jeff Fahey) bite the dust, and the
audience obligingly shouts
"hooray."
The movie begins with a bang,
as Emmett single-handedly kills

three men who are after him, and
there's enough wit to make you
think Kasdan might be able to
carry it off. However, it soon
becomes obvious he has little
control over the material as it
races off in countless subplots and
in a thousand directions at once.
"Silverado" is the western as
rock video: slick and dazzling on
its surface, but nothing of sub
stance or importance underneath.
It doesn't stick with the audience
that laughs and claps while watch
ing it, but has nothing worth
remembering to bring home. Kas
dan's method of advancing the
plot is to bring in Bruce
Broughton's "stirring" music
whenever possible, until it

becomes even more obnoxious
than John Williams' musical bom
basts for "Raiders of the Lost
Ark," "E.T." and "Star Wars."
Kasdan has his characters ride
along to the music, gaze at the
panoramic vistas provided by
cameraman John Bailey, and nod
at each other because he can't fig
ure out what else to do with them.
You can almost hear him asking
as he writes the script, "What do
gunmen doV Occasionally the
four heroes stop at the campfire
for some spare, witty banter, but
then the music starts again and

they're off.
The dialogue is at its worst
when Mai and Stella (Linda
Hunt), the saloon keeper, have to
speak their lines. Both of these
characters are misfits of a sort:
Mai because he's black, Stella be
cause she's a dwarf. Unfortun
ately Kasdan subscribes to the
standard good-Hollywood-liberal
dogma which states that
whenever a long suffering
minority is dealt with, the charac
ter can't be human â€” they have
to be saintly icons. Thus, Glover
as Mai has to say things like
"That ain't right. I've had enough
of what ain't right," and Hunt as
Stella has to say "Good people
are being hurt because of me. . . .

That makes me mad," and"The
world is what you make of it,"
which she has to say twice. The
other characters are icons as well,
but they don't have to utter such
dreadfully sonorous proclama
tions.
None of the actors under Kas
dan's direction seem to be in the
same movie. They are all off
doing their own thing, and none
of them relates to the others. The
only distinguishing thing about
Kevin Kline's very boring perfor
mance is that with a beard he
looks like Robin Williams. Scott
Glenn comes the closest to form
ing a real character, but he's
stifled by the script. Linda Hunt
has the only real moment of act
ing, when she realizes that Cobb
is using her to keep Paden from
helping his friends. As the puppy
like Jake, Kevin Costner is ap
pealing, but sometimes goes over
board. Jeff Goldblum has a funny
presence as Slick, who has some
kind of relationship with Mai's
sister Rae, the strikingly lovely
Lynn Whitfield. (Is it a
pimp/whore relationship? Kasdan
skirts round all of the sex in the
movie like an embarrassed
Puritan, and as a result all of the
relationships between men and
women are confused and murky.)
Brian Dennehy's Cobb is only
allowed an ice-cold smile, which
is better than the malevolent stare
of Jeff Fahey's Tyree. But surely
none of them fare as badly as
Rosanna Arquette in the
ridiculous role of Hannah, who
can only look doe-eyed as she's
passed back and forth from Em
mett to Paden.
"Silverado" has the same
weaknesses as Kasdan's other
films, "Body Heat" and"The Big
Chill." It suffers from surface
slickness and lack of an emotional
center. Kasdan has seen a lot of
movies, but has learned nothing
of characterization from them.
"Silverado" zooms and careens
crazily on screen, but it remains
flat, two-dimensional. It never
takes on a life of its own.
