# Spyro Gyra gets it together at Jazz Festival
## 
### MARSH McCALL Editorial staff 
The Concord Pavilion is further
away than I remembered, and my
comrade and I arrived an hour
late. Thus we missed guitarist
Stanley Jordan, one of two
opening acts for Spyro Gyra last
Thursday evening at the Concord
Jazz Festival. Jordan, whom I had
anticipated seeing perform for the
first time since he graduated from
Gunn High School in Palo Alto,
combines strong melodic expres
sion with a unique playing tech
nique: tapping the strings of his
guitar (resting on its back) with
both hands, Eddie Van Halen
style.
But by the time I struggled up
the hill to the Pavilion, Jordan
had retired for the evening. Next
on the agenda was Lee Ritenour
and friends, an ensemble of
studio musicians who made me
wish I'd been a little later. Lee's
great triumph of the evening was
showing off what he announced
as "my new toy," a digital guitar
synthesizer which had no strings
but could make the most
interesting sounds — so interest
ing, in fact, that oP Lee felt that a
15-minute demonstration was ne
cessary. His playing throughout
the remainder of his 90-minute
set consisted of uninteresting
rhythm licks.
There was one fun moment of
musical showing off (nothing
wrong with showing off, if it's
tasteful and not too long) be
tween Ritenour and his bass
player, who played a fast slap
bass. Lee responded with his own
version, "slap guitar," creating a

unique sound that I rather liked.
Jazz is a fragile thing. On a thin
line lies artistry, virtuosity and
musical cooperation between
talented individuals. This is jazz,
and it's great to be there when it
happens.
Unfortunately, I was there, and
it didn't happen. Some famous
philosopher once said that he of
ten regretted having spoken but
never was sorry for having
remained silent. Ritenour's band
should have kept this in mind —
his sidemen played too busily
during each member's solos, as if
each was too impatient to be
heard. Instead of a smooth "give
and take" between Lee and his
band, confusion ensued. All these
guys are talented musicians, yet
one of the joys (as I said) of
seeing jazz performed is the sub
tlety — the knowledge of when to
leave open space, when to accom
pany and when to be quiet. These
musicians, all virtuosos and anx
ious to let the audience know it,
seemed interested in getting in all
their own solo time, not in the
sound of their group.
A strong criticism, I admit, but
directed toward experienced
musicians who ought to have
known better. My companion
also criticized Ritenour's group
for some of its song selection —
playing commercial "pop-jazz"
tunes such as the theme to "St.
Elsewhere."
And I hate to complain, but by
golly, on top of everything, the
mix was bad. Strings were high
and tinny; keyboards were as
well. Perhaps, to be fair, the
sound was a contributing factor

toward the confusion.
Anyway, Spyro Gyra restored
my faith in mankind somewhat.
This band, with the advantage of
being a band with many years ex
perience playing together, placed
less emphasis on fast solos and
more on craftsmanship, and thus
was far more enjoyable. Lead
guitarist Julio Fernandez, who
sounds a little like Carlos San
tana, played simple but tasty
guitar figures at the right mo
ments and shut up the rest of the
time. Keyboardist Tom Schuman,
drummer Richie Morales and
histrionic percussionist Gerardo
Velez played smoothly, thought
fully, and they played together.
Bass player Kim Stone, featured
only briefly at the close of the
show, played both standup and
electric bass flawlessly.
And the tunes were good —
melodic and structured. In most
classic jazz performances, an
opening melody is played in a
straightforward manner, reveal
ing the specific song. After that,
improvisation begins, over the
chord changes of the melody, and
usually the straight melody is
rehashed at the finale. It's not
quite that simple, I realize, but
the point is that Spyro Gyra (and
other good jazz-fusions groups)
incorporate soloing within the
makeup of the song itself, mel
ding it into the structure of the
song.
Hence compositional creativity
is blended with creativity in
musicianship, making one depen
dent on the other. I find this
blending much more interesting
as a whole and guess that it

presents a greater challenge to
the musicians themselves. And
while Spyro Gyra did this very
well Thursday night (with, mys

teriously, a much better sound
mix), Lee Ritenour's gang
couldn't even figure out whose
turn it was to show off.

their own solo time, not in the
sound of their group.
A strong criticism, I admit, but
directed toward experienced
musicians who ought to have
known better. My companion
also criticized Ritenour's group
for some of its song selection —
playing commercial "pop-jazz"
tunes such as the theme to "St.
Elsewhere."
And I hate to complain, but by
golly, on top of everything, the
mix was bad. Strings were high
and tinny; keyboards were as
well. Perhaps, to be fair, the
sound was a contributing factor

toward the confusion.
Anyway, Spyro Gyra restored
my faith in mankind somewhat.
This band, with the advantage of
being a band with many years ex
perience playing together, placed
less emphasis on fast solos and
more on craftsmanship, and thus
was far more enjoyable. Lead
guitarist Julio Fernandez, who
sounds a little like Carlos San
tana, played simple but tasty
guitar figures at the right mo
ments and shut up the rest of the
time. Keyboardist Tom Schuman,
drummer Richie Morales and
histrionic percussionist Gerardo
Velez played smoothly, thought
fully, and they played together.
Bass player Kim Stone, featured
only briefly at the close of the
show, played both standup and
electric bass flawlessly.
And the tunes were good —
melodic and structured. In most
classic jazz performances, an
opening melody is played in a
straightforward manner, reveal
ing the specific song. After that,
improvisation begins, over the
chord changes of the melody, and
usually the straight melody is
rehashed at the finale. It's not
quite that simple, I realize, but
the point is that Spyro Gyra (and
other good jazz-fusions groups)
incorporate soloing within the
makeup of the song itself, mel
ding it into the structure of the
song.
Hence compositional creativity
is blended with creativity in
musicianship, making one depen
dent on the other. I find this
blending much more interesting
as a whole and guess that it

presents a greater challenge to
the musicians themselves. And
while Spyro Gyra did this very
well Thursday night (with, mys

teriously, a much better sound
mix), Lee Ritenour's gang
couldn't even figure out whose
turn it was to show off.


Spyro Gyra placed an emphasis on craftsmanship last Thursday at the
Concord Pavilion.
