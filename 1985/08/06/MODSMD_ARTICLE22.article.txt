## Doctor discourses on mountain medicine 
### LESLIE JONCUTT 
A 24-member team led by two
physicians will climb the mountains in
Quito, Ecuador, this December in a semi
nar designed to explore the effects of high
altitude on the human body.
"The seminar is for physicians and other
health professionals with an interest in
mountain medicine," said Dr. Herb
Hultgren, one of the two mountain
medicine experts on the faculty at the Stan
ford Medical School.
Sponsored by the Palisade School of
Mountaineering in cooperation with Stan
ford, the week-long seminar will include
discussions and research on high altitude
pulmonary, cerebral and systemic edema
(excessive fluid in the tissues), mountain
sickness, cold injury (frostbite, hypother
mia) and traveler's diarrhea.
The participants will perform experi
ments on each other to test the effects of
high altitude on metabolism and heart
function, as well as other physiological
points of change.
Dr. Frank Sarnquist, associate professor
of anesthesiology (clinical) and assistant
chief of anesthesiology at the Veterans Ad
ministration Medical Center in Palo Alto,
will also be participating in the seminar.
An experienced climber who was a moun
taineering guide in the eastern Sierra
Nevada during the 19605, Sarnquist partic
ipated in a Soviet-sponsored mountaineer
ing expedition in the Soviet Union in 1974

and in 1981 climbed with the American
Medical expedition to Mt. Everest â€” the
first team to perform medical experiments
above 26,000 feet.
Hultgren, an associate professor at Stan
ford since 1967, is also a staff cardiologist
at the Palo Alto VA and chairman of the
American Alpine Club. He has spent years
researching high altitude pulmonary
edema (swelling of the lungs), publishing
reports and lecturing on his findings.
Pulmonary edema can affect anyone, in
cluding those in even the best physical con
dition, if they climb so fast that the body
cannot acclimate itself to the changes in al
titude.
Hultgren believes that early diagnosis in
creases the chance for successful recovery.
Symptoms include headache, nausea,
vomiting, low blood pressure and increased
heart rate. The climber might become dis
oriented, have respiratory problems, in
somnia, and even claim to hear bubbling
noises in the chest. Immediate treatment
should include moving the climber to a
lower altitude and administering oxygen.
Increased interest in mountain medicine
has come from the growing number of
people participating in high-altitude sports,
not necessarily climbing. As Hultgren
points out, modern travel has made it pos
sible for a wider range of the population to
get to and exercise at higher altitudes with
