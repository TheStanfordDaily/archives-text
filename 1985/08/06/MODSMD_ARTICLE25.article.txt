## Baseball strike appears imminent 
### 
NEW YORK — The two parties in
baseball's labor dispute, responding to the
pleas of Commissioner Peter Ueberroth,
agreed to hold one last meeting today in an
attempt to avert a strike set for later in the
day.
Both sides — Lee MacPhail's Player Re
lations Committee and Don Fehr's union
— confirmed last night that talks would be
held in the morning. Neither side would
divulge the time or location.
Facing a strike deadline that would begin
with tonight's games, there still appeared
to be little chance of averting the game's
second midseason walkout in four years
unless bargainers could break an impasse
on salary arbitration.
Today's session was characterized by a
spokesman for the owners, Bob Fishel, as
"an informal meeting" and not a formal re
sumption of negotiations.
Fehr, the union's acting executive direc
tor, called the impasse "a rerun of 1981"
and said the owners were about to get "the

strike they obviously wanted."
While saying the owners would not "let
this go to a strike if we can help it," Mac-
Phail said, "I can't say that I'm optimistic
at this point."
Any settlement would have to come very
early in the day in order to give players
enough time to travel to their scheduled
cities. Fehr said his union had been in
structing players to return home after last
night's games instead of reporting to the
ballparks.
Then, late last night, Ueberroth issued a
statement saying that he had asked Mac-
Phail to contact the union in an effort to
get the talks going again as soon as possi
ble.
"The fans deserve the last ounce of
everyone's energy to resolve the current
impasse," Ueberroth said through a
spokesman.
Earlier in the day, responding to a state
ment by MacPhail that the owners would
not back off their position on salary ar

bitration, Fehr said, "If nothing happens
tonight, there'll be a strike. I'll tell the
players to go home. ... In this situation,
there's not much more we can do."
The union chief said if management
"seriously wanted to resolve the issues,
there'd be a hint from them. They have a
strike that they apparently want."
Haggard and looking disheveled, Fehr
said that players had been calling all even
ing. When they call, he said, "I've got to
tell them to go home."
No formal negotiating sessions were held
yesterday.
And after meeting informally with Mac-
Phail for one-and-one-half hours yesterday
morning, Fehr said he had "become more
pessimistic" about avoiding a strike. No
further meetings were scheduled, and Bob
Fishel, acting as a spokesman for the
owners, also said prospects of a settlement
"did not look good."
That left the very real possibility that last
night's games, six in the National League

and four in the American, would be the
last, at least for a while, in a season of
record-pace attendance and record
chasing performances by some of the
game's biggest names.
As the hours sped away toward the
deadline, the New York Mets got three
home runs by Darryl Strawberry and beat
the Chicago Cubs 7-2 in sun-splashed
Wrigley Field, moving the Mets into first
place in the NL East, a half game ahead of
St. Louis. The Cardinals lost 9-1 to
Philadelphia.
Los Angeles had a comfortable lead in
the NL West, while the American League
divisions were led by Toronto in the East
and California in the West.
Frank White of the Kansas City Royals,
who were in second in the AL West, said
that if he had to sit out a strike, he would
"try to improve my golf game and continue
to be amazed why this thing isn't settled."
