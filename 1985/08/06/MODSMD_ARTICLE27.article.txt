A federal appeals court in At
lanta affirmed that Nobel Prize
winning Stanford professor
William Shockley was libeled by
an Atlanta newspaper, but upheld
the decision to award Shockley
only $1.
Shockley, unhappy with the
original $1 verdict, had appealed
the decision after a 1984 court
ruling which, while acknowledg
ing Shockley's allegation that an
Atlanta Constitution newspaper
columnist had misrepresented
Shockley's controversial views

concerning blacks and genetics,
awarded Shockley the dollar in
actual damages and nothing in
punitive damages. Shockley had
sued for $1.25 million.
Columnist Roger Witherspoon,
who is black, drew parellels be
tween Shockley's ideas and ge
netic experiments conducted in
Nazi Germany.
"The verdict is inadequate,"
said Shockley after the trial. "The
Constitution has not in any way
been punished for libel."
Shockley could not be reached
for comment.
