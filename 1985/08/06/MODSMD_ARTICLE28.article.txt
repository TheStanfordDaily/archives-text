An article in Friday's Daily in
correctly reported that the United
Stanford Workers and the Stan
ford Central America Action
Network have joined a SOSA af
filiate group in issuing new
demands on the University ad
ministration.
In addition, the story's headline

incorrectly identified SOSA
(Stanford Out of South Africa) as
the group issuing the demands.
Those associated with the
demands are only members of a
SOSA affinity group and were
not speaking for the entire SOSA
movement. The Daily regrets this
error.
David Romo said he was
merely speaking for the smaller
group and not for SOSA.
