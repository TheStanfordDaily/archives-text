# Dean delays Coffee House committee

### MARSH McCALL Editorial staff 
In a memo dated July 26, Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons postponed the
formation of a task force intended to
develop a model for student involvement
in the Saga-run Coffee House this fall.
Lyons attributed the delay to financial and
organizational problems that have beset
the Coffee House in its last months under
ASSU ownership.
Lyons, who earlier this summer pro
posed the idea of a Coffee House task
force, wrote that he intends to postpone
formation of the task force "until early in
the fall quarter."
Lyons said yesterday that "transitional
problems" in the changeover were among
reasons for his proposed delay.
"Apparently, the Coffee House is behind
in paying off some outstanding bills,"
Lyons said, "and the ASSU is concerned,
because it has to underwrite those debts."
The ASSU owns all shares in the Coffee
House, Inc. (CHI).
"Anytime you end one organization and
replace it by another, you have problems,"
Lyons said. At present there "isn't time
nor people around to work it out."

Lyons said that a lack of agreement over
the basic format of the task force, including
selection of members and proposed re
sponsibilities of the group, posed addi
tional difficulties.
"I never expected disagreement over the
matter of form," Lyons said.
"I remain committed to the idea . . . [of]
the Task Force," Lyons wrote in his memo,
addressed to representatives of the ASSU
Senate, Tresidder Union and the Coffee
House, Inc., Board, "to devise ways to
ensure significant student involvement in
the management, policy direction and op
eration of the Coffee House given the
reality that Coffee House, Inc., lost in its
bid to operate it for the next five-year per
iod."
In a memo Friday to Tresidder, CHI
President Leslie Leland said the CHI "has
delayed rent payment (to Tresidder) due to
cash flow'problems involving the end of its
contract."
"The Coffee House runs on a cash-flow
basis," Leland said yesterday."The previ
ous month is paid for by the next month."
When questioned about CHI finances,
Tresidder Director Ellie Oppenheim stated
that the Coffee House is currently $20,000

in debt to Tresidder and hasn't paid rent
since April. "They're significantly behind
in their obligations," Oppenheim said.
Leland's memo states that although the
Coffee House is behind in rent payments,
"CHI has stayed within its contractual
obligations with regard to late rent pay
ment and has acknowledged all responsi
bility for this action."
In her memo, Leland also complains that
Tresidder has purposely not paid CHI for a
recent coffee order "in retaliation for other
debts."
Oppenheim said the willingness of the
CHI to pay interest on late rent still does
not ameliorate the problem. "The contract
does spell out a late interest payment,"
Oppenheim said, "but that doesn't absolve
them of responsibility. They've been late
for a number of months."
Oppenheim acknowledged that the cost
of a small purchase of coffee, bought from
the Coffee House for Tresidder use, had
been deducted from the Coffee House
debt.
In a separate memo, also dated Friday,
Leland accused Tresidder Asst. Director
Nanci Howe of sidestepping Coffee House
management in regard to Saga's interest in

purchasing CHl's liquor license and pres
ent inventory. "This failure to communi
cate with the current CHI officers is hope
fully the last incident in what has become a
demonstration of unprofessionalism and
hypocrisy," Leland wrote.
Oppenheim yesterday denied Leland's
accusations, stating that Howe had dis
cussed the liquor license transaction with
Coffee House President Ken Sharke and
Coffee House Manager Gary Verzani.
"And they indicated 'Yes,' " Oppenheim
said.
"I'm sure they said to go ahead with
negotiations," said Leland, in response to
Oppenheim's statement, "but Tresidder
went ahead and set the price â€” about half
of what we figured out. They phoned Todd
Kerr (former chairman of the CHI board
of directors, and legal signatore of the liq
uor license contract) who's been at the
Stanford Sierra Camp since early June. He
called me up and said 'What's going on?' "
Leland said that throughout the Coffee
House transition, Tresidder "has tried to
muddy things up."
"Tresidder's supposed to be for the
benefit of the students," Leland said, "but
they're just counting the change."
