The ASSU-run Coffee House,
Inc. (CHI), has not been paying
its fair share of Tresidder Union
overhead costs, Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons said last
night.
Lyons' answer came in
response to a question asking if
the University was "looking for
more money" when it chose Saga
Corp. The 20-minute interview,
which dealt with the current con
troversy surrounding the Coffee
House, was broadcast on radio
station KZSU.
"The Coffee House has run a
deficit. The Coffee House, for ex
ample, hasn't paid their rent since
last May, and this is certainly one
of the things that is a matter of
concern," Lyons said.
Following the selection of Saga,
some CHI backers accused the
University of being more con

cerned with profits than with the
welfare and concerns of students
in their operation of the student
union.
Lyons emphasized that profits
were not a motivating factor.
"Tresidder is non-profit, . . . it's
subsidized heavily out of student
fees. The question is to strike the
proper balance.
"So the question is: 'How long
can the ASSU underwrite those
deficits and how long should stu
dents generally (underwrite the
deficits) in their fees?' "
One of the concerns, he said, of
the Tresidder committee that
opted against the CHI was, "Did
they see evidence that this (debt
situation) was getting fixed and
wouldn't occur again?"
Lyons said "strong marketing
and training plans" were impor
tant factors in Saga's favor during
the bidding process. "They . . .
historically have had a strong

record of student involvement in
their operations across the
country. . . . Most of its top man
agement . . . are people who came
to work for them as students."
Lyons said he could empathize
â€¢ with students like Daniel Rosen,
who oppose the ASSU's loss of
the Coffee House. Those oppos
ing Saga's takeover are "students
who have long felt that the Coffee
House is an important social ex
perience."
"What he (Rosen) is saying,
what I hear him saying, is: 'We
need that kind of social organiza
tion for the several dozen stu
dents who have benefitted from
that down there,' and I agree with
that."
In response to his feelings on a
boycott of the Saga-run Coffee
House, Lyons said he expected
discontent with the Coffee House
decision and said expressing it
was healthy on a university
campus.
