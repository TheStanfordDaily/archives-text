## Apple to cease South African sales 
### 
CUPERTINO â€” Apple
Computer Inc. will discontinue
sales to South Africa because
of the country's apartheid
policy, a company spokes
woman said yesterday.
Effective Oct. 31, the per
sonal computer manufacturer
will stop shipments to its South
African distributor, Base 2
Ltd., according to Pam
Miracle, public relations
manager for Apple Interna
tional.
"Like many institutions
around the world, Apple
rejects the apartheid policies of
the current government,"
Miracle said.
Asked if the Cupertino
based company's move was a
political statement, she replied,
"The action speaks for itself."
Apple has no direct invest
ment in South Africa and Base
2 has handled all its computer

business for the past six years,
according to John Floisand,
manager director of Base 2 in
Johannesburg, South Africa.
Miracle refused to disclose
any Apple sales figures in
South Africa.
Other major American com
puter companies, including
IBM, Control Data and Bur
roughs, which have large
operations in South Africa,
have recently declared their in
tention to remain in the
country while working for poli
tical, economic and social
reforms.
"Apple was quite plain that
its reasons were political,"
Floisand said. "Apple felt that,
in view of the current feelings
in the United States and recent
events (in South Africa), it did
not want to be in South Africa,
and so they are pulling out."
