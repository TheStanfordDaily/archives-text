# Apartheid foes go to trial, miners plan business boycott
## 
### 
PIETERMARITZBURG, South Africa â€” The
treason trial of 16 anti-apartheid activists began
yesterday and black miners announced an impend
ing boycott of white businesses to protest the state
of emergency.
Police reported 16 more arrests under the emer
gency imposed last month in an attempt to quell the
tide of riot and protest that has swept black cities
and townships for nearly a year, claiming 500 black
victims.
The trial of 16 leaders of the United Democratic
Front, in this city of eastern Natal province, is seen
as the most significant treason case in South Africa
since 156 activists were acquitted after a four-year
long legal contest that began in 1956.
Charges in this case range from praising Nelson
Mandela, jailed leader of the outlawed African Na
tional Congress, to making speeches that further the
aims of what the government calls the
"revolutionary alliance."
The United Democratic Front (UDF) is the main
group fighting apartheid, the institutionalized race
segregation through which South Africa's 5 million
whites control the voteless black majority of 24 mil
lion. Defendants include two of the group's three
co-presidents.

National police headquarters in Pretoria said the
new detentions brought the total arrests to 1,428
since the emergency took effect July 21, and 109
have been released. Most of those detained are in
the second and third ranks of the UDF and its 600
affiliate organizations.
In Johannesburg, the black National Union of
Mineworkers said it was preparing a boycott of
white-owned businesses to protest the emergency.
The same union announced Sunday it will call a gold
mine strike Aug. 25 that could cripple the gold
dependent economy.
A three-day day period during which President
Pieter Botha can avert the boycott by lifting the
emergency probably will be set to start today, union
spokeswoman Manoko Nchwe said.
The government ignored the threatened strike
and boycott and Louis le Grange, the law and order
minister, said detention renewal orders were signed
for hundreds of people picked up early in the emer
gency.
At the treason trial in a heavily guarded red brick
courthouse in Pietermaritzburg, defense lawyers
described the indictment as unfounded and began a
procedural battle.
