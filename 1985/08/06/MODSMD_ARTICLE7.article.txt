# Jet broke up as it got order to abort landing
## Investigation also probes wind shear role in Delta crash 
### 
GRAPEVINE, Texas — Delta
Air Lines Flight 191 already was
breaking up when air traffic con
trollers frantically warned the
pilot to abort his landing, federal
investigators said yesterday.
The voice recorder of the L
-1011 jumbo jet, which killed 133
people in Friday's crash, picked
up sounds of the airplane coming
apart, "sort of a crackling, grind
ing" sound, said National Trans
portation Safety Board member
Patrick Bursley.
Over the sound of the breakup
could be heard the frantic order
of the Dallas-Fort Worth Interna
tional Airport flight controller,
"Delta, go around!" urging the
pilot not to land, said Bursley.
An automatic device in the
cockpit also told the pilot in its
electronic voice, "Pull up! Pull
up! Pull up!" just before the
crash, he said.
. Bursley also said the flight data
recorder revealed some speed
fluctuations before the crash,
which he said must be analyzed
further. He would not speculate
on the cause of the fluctuations,
nor did he describe them.
Bursley for the first time fixed
the exact time of the crash as 4:08
p.m. PDT, based on the observa
tion of a person at the airport who
was setting aircraft clocks aboard
an airplane and witnessed the
crash.
Investigators earlier said the
jumbo jet might already have hit
the ground by the time the con
troller in the tower was able to

issue the command to "go
around."
Tape recordings made in the
tower show that just before the
crash an air traffic controller
watched as the plane emerged
from a thundershower 50 to 100
feet above the ground, authorities

said. The plane at that point may
have been bouncing after initial
impact, investigators said.
"Delta, go around!" the con
troller ordered, but Bursley said
yesterday it was unclear whether
the pilot heard.
"The controller saw the left

wing dip, the nose go down, he
saw fire, he saw the plane go
down. The plane came into con
tact with the ground north of the
freeway, and the controller ap
parently saw it after it had struck
the ground," Bursley said.
He said he did not know

whether the pilot heard the order
or tried to respond, but that the
Delta L-1011's digital flight
recorder indicated a surge in
engine power just before the
crash.
"Power is an answer in over
coming problems in flight con
trol," Bursley said. But he said in
vestigators who listened to the
voice recorder detected no alarm
by the cockpit crew.
The wide-bodied Delta jet
bounced once before hitting a car
on busy Texas Highway 114 —
killing the driver — and then
bounced several more times
before hitting a water tower,
sliding across the tarmac into a
muddy field and exploding.
Thirty-one people survived, some
suffering only minor cuts and
bruises.
Bursley said officials are inves
tigating the role of wind shear —
an abrupt change of wind direc
tion and speed — in the crash. In
struments at the airport showed
low-level wind shear in the area
minutes after the crash, but might
have missed wind shear farther
away, he said.
Clint Swazea, a Delta assistant
vice president in Atlanta, said
Saturday that he was almost cer
tain wind shear had caused the
crash.
Wind shear has been blamed in
16 airliner accidents in the past
20 years, most recently the crash
of Pan Am Flight 759 on July 9,
1982, that killed 154 people in
Kenner, La.
