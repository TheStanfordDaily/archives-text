# Shuttle hits high note on last orbit day

HOUSTON â€” Challenger's astronauts
enjoyed a "dazzling" extra day in orbit
yesterday with every instrument on board
working as planned, then started packing
for their landing today at Edwards Air
Force Base in California.
"It's the greatest pleasure to wind up
with a dazzling day like this with all the in
struments working so well," said astronaut
Loren Acton.
It was one of the few times during the
eight-day mission that all of the instru
ments in Challenger's powerful array of
solar and stellar experiments worked at
once.
The seven astronauts scrambled to take
advantage of every moment in orbit, and
astronaut Karl Henize said it was enjoy
able, but "kind of hectic."
"It's more fun than a barrel of monkeys

up here," he said.
A solar instrument that had been broken
from the beginning of the mission a week
ago suddenly turned itself on Sunday, and
the astronauts worked it hard to get as
much data as possible.
Mission commander Gordon Fullerton
and pilot Roy Bridges checked out the
equipment they will use to land Challenger
at 12:45 p.m. PDT today. They operated
navigation aids and flight control surfaces
and turned on an auxiliary power unit that
will operate hydraulic systems for the long
glide to California. Mission Control said all
of the systems checked out fine.
Mission scientist Eugene Urban said
Challenger's voyage for science, which has
been a decade in preparation, had been
"superbly successful" despite a harrowing
start.

A launch engine shut down as Chal
lenger was climbing toward orbit on July
29. The spacecraft was placed into a lower
than-expected orbit with a shortage of fuel.
The orbit was 195 miles, about 46 miles
lower than planned.
The astronauts nursed rocket propellant
and other energy supplies and were able to
develop enough of a surplus to extend the
mission by one day.
A $60 million instrument-pointing
device malfunctioned for four days,
defying seven efforts to correct a flawed
computer program. A final effort brought
the instrument under control, and the
astronauts were able to use it to aim solar
instruments at precise targets on the sun.
The astronauts gathered data for the first
time yesterday with the Solar Optical Uni
versal Polarimeter, an instrument that

failed to turn itself on for the first six days
of the mission. The instrument is designed
to study the strength and evolution of mag
netic fields in the sun.
"It's working," said astronaut John-
David Bartoe as he viewed TV images
snapped by the SOUP instrument.
Experimenters operating an infrared
telescope found that their helium-cooled
instrument was saturated with heat sources
of an unknown origin, blocking most of
their attempts to study distant star fields.
Giovanni Fazio of the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory, the principal
scientist on the experiment, said he was
disappointed that they were unable to
study star fields as hoped, but that inves
tigators were intrigued by the infrared
cloud that seems to be surrounding Chal
lenger in orbit.
