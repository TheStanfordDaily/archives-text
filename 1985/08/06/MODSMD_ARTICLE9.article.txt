Soviet space station under repair
MOSCOW — The Soviet Union said yesterday that the two
cosmonauts now aboard the Salyut-7 space station were sent
there to save the space lab, which was drifting out of control after
a total breakdown of the electrical system.
In its unusually detailed and frank report, the Communist
Party paper Pravda said Salyut-7 had been adrift for more than
three months when Vladimir Dzhanibekov and Viktor Savinykh
were launched into space aboard Soyuz T-13 on June 6.
Because radio communications with the station's onboard
computer were cut, Soviet scientists did not know what condi
tions the two cosmonauts would face, Pravda said.
When they arrived, said the paper, they found the space station
without lights, heat and electrical power, its air poisoned and un
breathable, its water supplies frozen, its batteries dead and its
propulsion engines out of order.
Dzhanibekov and Savinykh had to perform an untested
manual docking procedure when they arrived, Pravda reported.
Ground control had to decide whether to abort the mission
since the crew had only a two-week water supply and use of the
electric power from Soyuz T-13 could have stranded them in
space, Pravda said.
The two cosmonauts — who are still aboard Salyut-7 — dis
covered an electrical breakdown, Pravda said. It took them eight
days aboard the frozen space lab to repair all the damage —
caused by a faulty gauge on a chemical battery.
Pravda also explained why it took two days instead of the usual
24 hours to dock Soyuz T-13 with Salyut-7, and why the highly
experienced Dzhanibekov was sent back into space less than a
year after his previous mission.
A veteran of three other space trips, Dzhanibekov was aboard
Salyut-7 in July 1984. During that mission, he and cosmonaut
Svetlana Savistkaya left the station to repair a fuel leak that had
caused problems with Salyut-7's rocket engines in December
1983.
Pravda said a radio system that lets ground crews control the
computers aboard Salyut-7 broke down early this year. The sta
tion had been empty since October 1984.
But the Soviets faced immediate problems because it was
impossible to carry out the usual automatic docking operation,
Pravda said.
For three months, scientists worked to outfit a Soyuz capsule
with new flight controls, calculate a new flight pattern and train
Dzhanibekov and Savinykh, the article said.
On June 6, the two men blasted into orbit and headed for a
rendezvous.
On June 23, the Progress 24 cargo ship docked with Salyut-7
to bring fresh food, water, air and fuel supplies as well as two new
chemical batteries.
The Soviets have not said when the cosmonauts will return.
Korea asked to reinstate journalists
LONDON — The International Press Institute appealed to
South Korea yesterday to reinstate more than 600 journalists
barred from their profession five years ago when the country was
put under martial law.
The institute, a worldwide watchdog of news media freedom,
cabled President Chun Doo-hwan, praising South Korea's
"gradual return toward liberalization," but expressing regret that
only 28 of the estimated 700 banned journalists had been
allowed back to work.
Export law violator seeks clemency
SAN DIEGO — A delicatessen owner who admitted trying to
sell restricted radar equipment to Iran asked a federal judge yes
terday to reduce his jail term despite government allegations that
he offered to sell nuclear triggering devices to Iraq.
U.S. District Judge Earl Gilliam took Yasser Abdulrahim
"Max" Shooshtary's request under submission and is expected to
announce a decision tomorrow, assistant U.S. Attorney Lynne
Lasry said.
The sale of the triggering devices was supposed to be a "peace
plan" to end the Iran-Iraq war, federal authorities say.
, Authorities told the Los Angeles Times that the radar parts
never reached Iran and that they doubt Shooshtary or his Iranian
partner in London had access to, or that Iraq now possesses, nu
clear weapons.
Lasry described Shooshtary, 49, a resident alien with dual
citizenship in Iran and Great Britain, as a mercenary with "no
loyalty to anything."
Shooshtary pleaded guilty in May to conspiracy to violate ex
port laws in connection with the radar parts case and a mis
demeanor conviction of failing to file a federal income tax return
for 1983.
In a 10-minute hearing before Gilliam yesterday, an attorney
for Shooshtary asked for his client's two-year, two-day federal
prison term to be reduced to a single year and a day. With time
off for good behavior, such a modification could lead to Shoosh
tary's immediate release.
The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service argued yes
terday against modifying the sentence, saying it was working on
having Shooshtary deported.
Lasry characterized the peace plan as "the highest bidder gets
the bomb."

LONDON — The International Press Institute appealed to
South Korea yesterday to reinstate more than 600 journalists
barred from their profession five years ago when the country was
put under martial law.
The institute, a worldwide watchdog of news media freedom,
cabled President Chun Doo-hwan, praising South Korea's
"gradual return toward liberalization," but expressing regret that
only 28 of the estimated 700 banned journalists had been
allowed back to work.
Export law violator seeks clemency
SAN DIEGO — A delicatessen owner who admitted trying to
sell restricted radar equipment to Iran asked a federal judge yes
terday to reduce his jail term despite government allegations that
he offered to sell nuclear triggering devices to Iraq.
U.S. District Judge Earl Gilliam took Yasser Abdulrahim
"Max" Shooshtary's request under submission and is expected to
announce a decision tomorrow, assistant U.S. Attorney Lynne
Lasry said.
The sale of the triggering devices was supposed to be a "peace
plan" to end the Iran-Iraq war, federal authorities say.
, Authorities told the Los Angeles Times that the radar parts
never reached Iran and that they doubt Shooshtary or his Iranian
partner in London had access to, or that Iraq now possesses, nu
clear weapons.
Lasry described Shooshtary, 49, a resident alien with dual
citizenship in Iran and Great Britain, as a mercenary with "no
loyalty to anything."
Shooshtary pleaded guilty in May to conspiracy to violate ex
port laws in connection with the radar parts case and a mis
demeanor conviction of failing to file a federal income tax return
for 1983.
In a 10-minute hearing before Gilliam yesterday, an attorney
for Shooshtary asked for his client's two-year, two-day federal
prison term to be reduced to a single year and a day. With time
off for good behavior, such a modification could lead to Shoosh
tary's immediate release.
The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service argued yes
terday against modifying the sentence, saying it was working on
having Shooshtary deported.
Lasry characterized the peace plan as "the highest bidder gets
the bomb."
