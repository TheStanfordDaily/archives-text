# Whitworth denies new spy charges

SAN FRANCISCO â€” Retired
Navy radio man Jerry Whitworth
pleaded innocent yesterday in
federal court to 12 new charges
that he sold secret war contin
gency plans to the Soviet Union
for approximately $332,000.

The 45-year-old retired chief
petty officer is one of four men
accused of participating in a spy
ring that officials say relayed
Navy secrets to the Soviets.
Defense attorney James Larson
said that a new federal grand jury
indictment handed down Tues
day, specifying a dozen alleged
criminal violations by the career
military man, are more "narrow"
than he had expected.

"I'm saying the government's
case is weak," he said. "There is
really nothing new in the govern
ment's case."
After his arrest in June, Whit
worth pleaded innocent to
charges of conspiracy to commit
espionage and he has been held
without bail at an undisclosed jail
in the San Francisco area.
The indictments together
accused Whitworth of conspiring
with alleged spymaster John
Walker Jr., from as early as 1970,
to pass along information related
to national defense and charge
Whitworth with failure to pay
taxes on funds allegedly received
from Walker.
Walker's brother, Arthur, went
on trial this week before a judge
in Norfolk, Va. John Walker and
his son, Michael, are awaiting
trial in Baltimore.
Federal authorities have
"exaggerated" the seriousness of
military documents found in
Whitworth's home, Larson said.
Two training manuals and a top
security message guide, which the
government earlier cited as exam
ples of valuable and sensitive in
formation, were not mentioned in
the latest indictment, he added.
Larson challenged government
allegations that Whitworth vio
lated income tax laws by not
reporting or paying taxes on
money he is said to have collected
from Walker, described as a close
friend.
