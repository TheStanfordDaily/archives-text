Frankfurt bomb kills 2 Americans
FRANKFURT, West Germany — A car filled with explosives
blew up at a U.S. air base outside Frankfurt yesterday, killing two
Americans an airman and a woman civilian. Authorities said
more than 20 Americans were injured.
The Federal Criminal Office said it was seeking a dozen mem
bers of the leftist Red Army Faction terrorist group in connection
with the bombing at the Rhein-Main base.
In Washington, White House spokesman Larry Speakes said,
"Preliminary information available to us here indicates a violent,
radical group has targeted our military and other Western service
personnel, as well as innocent civilians, for acts of violence."
Kurt Rebmann, West Germany's chief federal prosecutor, said
the explosives were planted in a car with forged American Forces
license plates. The bomb went off at 7:15 a.m. ( 10:15 p.m. PDT,
Wednesday) in a parking lot as base personnel were reporting for
work.
The blast blew out scores of windows in the headquarters
building of the 435 th Tactical Airlift Wing and a nearby dor
mitory, damaged or destroyed dozens of automobiles and ripped
a hole one yard deep and two yards wide in the ground.
The U.S. military's European Command headquarters in Stut
tgart identified one of the dead as Airman Ist Class Frank Scar
ton, 20, of Woodhaven, Mich. The military said in a telex that
Scarton, a member of the 437 th Military Airlift Wing, was on
temporary duty at Rhein-Main.
The military said the second victim was a civilian woman, but
declined to further identify her pending notification of her fam
ily. West German police said she was an American.
"The circumstances of the attack point to the Red Army Fac
tion," Rebmann said of the car bomb. The terrorist gang has
been responsible for numerous attacks against North Atlantic
Treaty Organization and U.S. military facilities in West Ger
many.
Late yesterday, the West German Federal Criminal Office
released a statement naming 12 Red Army Faction members
being sought in the bombing.
Lebanese gunmen release Canadian
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Gunmen kidnapped a Canadian relief
worker in southern Lebanon yesterday, but both his organization
and the Canadian government said he was freed later in the day.
Police said Robert Burkholder, 30, of Markham,
Ontario, was seized in the Shiite Moslem market town of
Nabatiyeh by unidentified men with guns who bundled him into a
car. He works as an administrator for the South Lebanon Project
of the Mennonite Central Committee, a relief organization based
in Akron, Ohio.
Dan Zehr, executive director of the Mennonite Central Com
mittee in Winnipeg, Manitoba, told the Canadian press he had
received information that Burkholder was released later yester
day. The Canadian Foreign Office in Ottawa also said it had con
firmation of his release.
Burkholder was kidnapped hours after gunmen in Moslem
West Beirut freed Shakim Hmeidan, Lebanese operations
manager of the ABC te'evision network's Beirut bureau.
Hmeidan, abducted Saturday, was unharmed.
In Beirut and Damascus, Syria, there was no indication that
any of the seven Americans and four Frenchmen believed held
by Shiite extremists would be freed soon. The Kuwaiti newspaper
As-Siyassah reported Tuesday that release of some of those held
was imminent, but Western diplomatic sources in Damascus said
they have no indications of any impending release.
None of Lebanon's more than 20 militias claimed responsibil
ity for the abduction of Burkholder.
In Damascus, a Canadian Embassy official said earlier that the
embassy was contacting the Lebanese government and militia
leaders to secure his release.
The Canadian was the 25th foreigner kidnapped in Lebanon
since the beginning of 1984. Fourteen still are missing. Two of
the kidnap victims were found dead and the rest were released or
escaped.
Pope visits Togo on African tour
LOME, Togo — Pope John Paul II embarked on his third trip
to Africa yesterday, encouraging the continent's Christians to
hold on to the "wisdom" of their native culture while embracing
church teaching.
The first stop on his seven-nation tour was Lome, the capital of
Togo.
At the same time, he said, Africa's Roman Catholics have
reached the stage "where their faith must ripen and carry au
thentically African and authentically Christian fruit."
He apparently referred to the church's efforts to set limits on
the mixing of Christian and indigenous African customs.
Among the diplomats who greeted the pope after he arrived at
the Lome airport was North Korean Ambassador Kim Yang-
Fang. Vatican officials said it was the first such gesture ever by a
North Korean envoy.
The Vatican has no diplomatic relations with the Communist
country, which has banned Western religions.
The pope has said major objectives of the 12-day trip — his
third and longest journey to Africa — are to consolidate the
church's gains in conversion and improve relations with Mos
lems.
Christians constitute about 27 percent of Togo's 3 million
people. About one out of five Christians in Togo is Roman Cath
olic.
