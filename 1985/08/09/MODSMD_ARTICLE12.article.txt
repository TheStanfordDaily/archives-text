Alleged FBI spy too heavy
LOS ANGELES — One month before he
began a sexual affair with a Russian woman,
former FBI agent Richard Miller was censured
for being overweight and threatened with ter
mination by the FBI, a witness testified yester
day.
The deterioration of Miller's 20-year FBI
career was dissected for jurors by Patrick Mul
lany, assistant special agent in charge of the Los
Angeles FBI office.
Poring through piles of personnel records
beginning in 1964, Mullaney spoke of Miller's
promising early years in the FBI when he was
repeatedly rated as "excellent" in his work.
But by 1975 there were problems, he said. Mil
ler was rated as merely "satisfactory," and it was
noted that he was overweight.
The battle with weight would continue for the
balance of Miller's FBI career, and the records
presented by Mullaney showed the agent was
censured three times for failing to slim down.
Miller, who is 5-feet-10, weighed in at 250 in
1984 — more than 50 pounds over the FBl's rec
ommended limit of 193.
On April 20, 1984, Miller was suspended with
out pay for seven days and placed on probation
for 90 days, Mullaney said. He received a letter
from Washington warning that failure to lose
weight might lead to his termination, the witness
said.

Prosecutors have said Miller's affair with Svet
lana Ogorodnikov began May 24, 1984.
Miller was still on probation when he was ar
rested Oct. 2, 1984 and charged with spying,
Mullaney said.
Miller, 48, is the first FBI agent ever charged
with espionage.
AIDS risk factor isolated
BALTIMORE — A study of homosexual men
indicates that people who play the passive role in
anal intercourse increase their chances of becom
ing infected with the deadly AIDS virus, re
searchers say.
Dr. Frank Polk, who conducted the Johns
Hopkins University study, said the receptive role
in anal intercourse proved to be the greatest risk
factor among 30 percent of the men in the study
infected with acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, which breaks down the body's ability
to fight disease.
The active partner in anal intercourse is less
likely to become infected, he said, adding that
details of the study would be released late next
month.
The significance of the findings is that "it
allows us to target our advice with respect to risk
reduction," he said Wednesday. "Either avoid
the activity or be sure your partner wears a con
dom."
