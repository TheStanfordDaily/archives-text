More tainted melons found
SACRAMENTO — Residues of the pesticide
aldicarb sulfoxide, which sickened hundreds of
people last month who ate tainted watermelons,
has been found again on watermelons in Kern
County and on a field of young broccoli in Mon
terey County.
The California Department of Food and
Agriculture reported the compound was found in
samples taken from 80 acres of watermelons
owned by grower Tim Yaksitch. It said all the
harvested watermelons were destroyed and the
fields were plowed under.
Meanwhile, Monterey County Agricultural
Commissioner Richard Nutter said yesterday that
residues of aldicarb were discovered in a field of
immature broccoli south of King City. The crop
was about 45 days from harvest, and none of the
broccoli was sold or distributed.

Homosexual rule stands
SAN JOSE — A federal judge said yesterday
that a policy of excluding self-described
homosexuals from the United States was "facially
invalid," but refused to ban it.
U.S. District Judge Robert Aguilar refused to
issue an injunction sought by the Gay-Lesbian
Freedom Day Committee, ruling that it was too
uncertain that the Immigration and Naturaliza
tion Service would exclude homosexuals based
solely on a declaration of their homosexuality.
But Aguilar also said a "meaningful medical
examination ' was required by a 1983 decision of
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that
prohibited the INS from excluding self-described
homosexuals without an examination by a medi
cal officer.
Federal law allows exclusion of aliens because
of "psychopathic personality, sexual deviation or
a mental defect."
