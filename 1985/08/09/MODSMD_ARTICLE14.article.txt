## The
						Stanford Daily Networks shy on TV sex? 
### 
We sure feel silly. We didn't think the three major televi
sion networks had any hang-ups about sex. After all, a 1982
study indicated that the average viewer is subjected to
more than 9,000 instances of sexual situations on television
each year. We agreed with the Los Angeles Times that
ABC, NBC, and CBS all try to "jiggle" their way up the
Nielson ratings.
But we were wrong. Recently these networks have
refused to run a "controversial" public service message
aimed at reducing unintended pregnancies. It is
heartwarming to know that the networks care enough for
us to shelter us from the facts of life.
Here's how the ad goes:
Scene one: A young woman steps off a school bus and
says,"I intend to be president."
Scene two: Another young woman sitting at a home
computer says,"I intend to go back to school."
Scene three: A third young woman, very pregnant and
working over a stove, says"I intended to have a family, but
not this soon." Then an announcer adds, "Nothing changes
any intentions faster than an unintended pregnancy. Unin
tended pregnancies have risks, greater risks than any of
today's contraceptives." Then he gives a number to call for
information about birth control methods.
There are 3.5 million unwanted pregnancies every year
in the United States alone â€” one of the highest rates
among developed nations. And the networks have addi
tionally rejected the ads on the grounds that they are repel
ling. Unlike, of course, Preparation H commercials. The
networks also think its unfair to run a public message with
out "both sides being represented." That seems
reasonable, considering the Moral Majority announcement
condemning gratuitous sex that follows each episode of
"General Hospital."
We can sleep soundly tonight, secure in the knowledge
that the networks care enough to protect us like this. After
all, they're just unwanted children or abortions. And God
knows, there's nothing worse than controversy.
