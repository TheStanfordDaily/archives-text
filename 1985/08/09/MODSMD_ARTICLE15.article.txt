# Facts on Coffee House
## 
### 
It was noon, and I was standing outside the post
office. I had just reached that level of desperation
that often hits when you have not even a vague idea
of what to write and 24 hours to write it. In this state
of panic, I happened to pick up the Tuesday issue of
The Daily, and the first words I saw were: "The
ASSU-run Coffee House, Inc. (CHI) has not been
paying its fair share of overhead costs, Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons said last night." Manna
from Heaven.
The first thing that one notices when reading the
article is that Dean Lyons declined to go into detail
to support his accusation, perhaps because it is
untrue. What he did do, aside from scrupulously
avoiding saying anything (in the classic style of a
Stanford administrator), was to once again imply
that the Coffee House shows that students are in
capable of running their own business, and that the
only people who will be seriously put out by the
Saga House will be Daniel "Fidel" Rosen, and his
"several dozen" fellow malcontents.
The by-now-famous Coffee House debt has
proven to be convenient to anyone wishing to make
a case against students running a business, and Dean
Lyons did not neglect to mention it yet again in his
KZSU interview. He was also careful to point out
that the Coffee House was running three months
behind on the rent, although he did not mention
that they are paying interest to Tresidder on the
outstanding sum and are not in violation of their
contract.
The existence of the debt is hardly surprising,
considering the sad state of affairs at the Coffee
House when the students took it over, the amount
of renovation the students did, and the extortionate
rent (12.5 percent) CHI pays to Tresidder. What is
surprising is that, given all this, the students were
able to turn the Coffee House into a success and
even begin to pay off the principal of the dreaded
debt. This would seem to be such a good example of
the extraordinary competence and ability of the stu
dents in CHI that it is strange Lyons would even
mention it. Why is it so important for Tresidder and
the Student Affairs Office to convince people that
students can't run the Coffee House?
If people are led to believe that the students are
generally incapable of running the Coffee House,
then questions concerning what sort of claim the
students may have to it or whether Saga has the
right to take it over hopefully will not come up.
Questions such as these have kept both Tresidder

and the Student Affairs Office from mentioning that
the Coffee House we are familiar with, with the
raised floor areas, the three-sided counter and the
controlled lighting and acoustics was designed and
built by students. Nor has anybody, with the possi
ble exception of Daniel Rosen and company, been
particularly eager to call attention to the fact that
Saga is getting a very popular and profitable place,
when five years ago, it would have been charitable
to call it a dump.

What the dean and the people at Tresidder hope
to camouflage is the fact that the Coffee House was
made only with a considerable amount of student
effort, and that the students are now expected to
give it over into Saga's tacky hands just as it is
beginning to become profitable and pay back five
years of hard work.
Once the fact that the students have a definite, al
though possibly tenuous, claim to the Coffee House
is successfully buried beneath talk of marketing and
training programs, the only remaing obstacle is to
convince people that the Saga House won't become
an airport lounge, or — even worse — the Medical
Center Cafeteria. What the dean and Tresidder are
banking on is the relatively short memory of stu
dents as a group, due to their rapid rate of turnover.
So the Coffee House probably won't change very
much, at least not in the first year. After a couple of
years, Daniel Rosen and most of the people on the
CHI board will have graduated, the whole thing will
be pretty much forgotten, and Saga and Tresidder
can do what they will with the Coffee House. And
despite all the promises to preserve the atmosphere
of the Coffee House, Tresidder memos with terms
like "upscale," "upbeat" and "new-wave" give a
fair indication of the direction it will take.
