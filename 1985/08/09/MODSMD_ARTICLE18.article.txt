Questions on Saga
and Coffee House
Five months ago, a University
manager gave me alarming infor
mation. She said that, public
statements to the contrary, the
administration has made plans
for several years to turn over
much of campus food service to
an outside corporation, most
likely Saga. Saga is the giant food
conglomerate that is currently
taking over Tresidder's food
service including the student
Coffee House.
She said that prominent among
the officials who formulated this
plan is William Massy, vice
president of business and
finance. Under this plan, Univer
sity kitchen equipment in the
dorms will most likely be sold to
Saga,' and the kitchen space
leased for Saga's use. This plan
would be put into effect during
the summer, when most students
are gone.
I took this and other informa
tion cautiously, hoping she was
wrong. The way Saga was
brought into Tresidder, however,
supports what she said. Saga now
has a convenient stepping stone
into the dorms.
I plan to cover what workers
have to lose in another letter.
However, since students here
have much to lose from Saga
taking over, I urge the ASSU
and other groups on campus to
get to the bottom of this issue by
demanding from the administra
tion public answers to these
questions:
1) Are there plans to turn
dorm food services over to Saga?
2) What role did Massy play in
formulating these plans?

3) Does Massy own Saga
stock?
4) What donations has Saga
given to Stanford Hospital and
the University?
5) Is Tresidder Director Ellie
Oppenheim's husband vice
president of Saga's Straw Hat
division?
6) Who selected, and by what
methods, the Tresidder commit
tee that recently "made the deci
sion" to have Saga take over
Tresidder food services?
7) Finally, what do students at
Stanford Hospital, Menlo Col
lege and the University of Santa
Clara think of Saga food?
I urge students to investigate,
to protect yourselves, first, to stop
Saga at the Coffee House before
they roll into the dorms, and
second, to protest this kind of
behind-the-door decision
making.
To the administration I say it is
a crying shame that your lack of
candor and wheeling and dealing
is such an education in sleaze to
the students here.

Say again?
Your statement in the Aug. 6
editorial, "Nuclear war is no
more terrible than any conven
tional war in the past" requires
some explanation. Are you im
plying that we could rebuild our
civilization in the aftermath of a
nuclear war? If so, you are sadly
mistaken. If not, what are you
trying to say?
