Questions on Saga
and Coffee House
Five months ago, a University
manager gave me alarming infor
mation. She said that, public
statements to the contrary, the
administration has made plans
for several years to turn over
much of campus food service to
an outside corporation, most
likely Saga. Saga is the giant food
conglomerate that is currently
taking over Tresidder's food
service including the student
Coffee House.
She said that prominent among
the officials who formulated this
plan is William Massy, vice
president of business and
finance. Under this plan, Univer
sity kitchen equipment in the
dorms will most likely be sold to
Saga,' and the kitchen space
leased for Saga's use. This plan
would be put into effect during
the summer, when most students
are gone.
I took this and other informa
tion cautiously, hoping she was
wrong. The way Saga was
brought into Tresidder, however,
supports what she said. Saga now
has a convenient stepping stone
into the dorms.
I plan to cover what workers
have to lose in another letter.
However, since students here
have much to lose from Saga
taking over, I urge the ASSU
and other groups on campus to
get to the bottom of this issue by
demanding from the administra
tion public answers to these
questions:
1) Are there plans to turn
dorm food services over to Saga?
2) What role did Massy play in
formulating these plans?

3) Does Massy own Saga
stock?
4) What donations has Saga
given to Stanford Hospital and
the University?
5) Is Tresidder Director Ellie
Oppenheim's husband vice
president of Saga's Straw Hat
division?
6) Who selected, and by what
methods, the Tresidder commit
tee that recently "made the deci
sion" to have Saga take over
Tresidder food services?
7) Finally, what do students at
Stanford Hospital, Menlo Col
lege and the University of Santa
Clara think of Saga food?
I urge students to investigate,
to protect yourselves, first, to stop
Saga at the Coffee House before
they roll into the dorms, and
second, to protest this kind of
behind-the-door decision
making.
To the administration I say it is
a crying shame that your lack of
candor and wheeling and dealing
is such an education in sleaze to
the students here.

Say again?
Your statement in the Aug. 6
editorial, "Nuclear war is no
more terrible than any conven
tional war in the past" requires
some explanation. Are you im
plying that we could rebuild our
civilization in the aftermath of a
nuclear war? If so, you are sadly
mistaken. If not, what are you
trying to say?

Thanks for an interesting edi
torial on the Opus/South Africa
issue (Daily, Aug. 2). In an age
of reductionism, it is stirring,
somehow, to witness such an
attempt at synthesis.
I'd like to point out, though,
that your description of Cutter
John as "confined to a wheel
chair" is inaccurate. Readers of
Bloom County have seen Cutter

sitting on a couch, lying in the
meadow and even seducing his
ladyfriend in bed. Of course,
real-life people are not confined
to their wheelchairs either; the
chair is a tool for locomotion, not
an element of personhood.
Terms like "confined,"
"wheelchair-bound" and
"wheelchair person" are often
perceived as offensive by people
who use wheelchairs. Similarly,
people who are strongly commit
ted to a cause like the elimina
tion of apartheid may be offen
ded when their efforts and goals
are treated humorously. We
cannot always know which terms
are appropriate, and it is a good

and healthy thing for us to poke
fun at ourselves. But we must
keep in mind that our words can
carry a tremendous power, and
we should use them with care
and compassion.

'Silverado * critic
pseudo-intellectual
I recently returned to the
campus after a year away, and I
still see those unfortunate,
pseudo-intellectual movie
reviews gracing the pages of The
Daily. The Aug. 6 review of
"Silverado" is a notable addition

Since when does a movie, let
alone a western, require "some
real reason to exist"? I hope
there are a few others out there
who will admit to liking —
maybe even loving — this film,
for the simple reason that it is
damn good entertainment. Of
course there are problems with
character development, scripts
and overacting. But what western
escapes from such stuff? It's as if
Joe Mader doesn't realize that
the movie is supposed to be
kind of corny.
I get the feeling, however,
whenever I read this type of
review, that the critic has
marched into the theater with

pad and pen in hand, a mini
flashlight by which to see his
scribbles, and a big chip on his
shoulder. In short, he's ready to
prove to his readers that nothing
gets past him. Even if the movie
is fun, pleasantly corny, full of
action and well worth two hours
and a bucket of popcorn, he's
going to make sure that nobody
mistakes him for Joe Average
Fool Movie Consumer.
My advice to Daily readers:
Don't take other people's advice
. . . just go see the movie if it
looks like it would be fun — and
this one is.

sitting on a couch, lying in the
meadow and even seducing his
ladyfriend in bed. Of course,
real-life people are not confined
to their wheelchairs either; the
chair is a tool for locomotion, not
an element of personhood.
Terms like "confined,"
"wheelchair-bound" and
"wheelchair person" are often
perceived as offensive by people
who use wheelchairs. Similarly,
people who are strongly commit
ted to a cause like the elimina
tion of apartheid may be offen
ded when their efforts and goals
are treated humorously. We
cannot always know which terms
are appropriate, and it is a good

and healthy thing for us to poke
fun at ourselves. But we must
keep in mind that our words can
carry a tremendous power, and
we should use them with care

'Silverado * critic
pseudo-intellectual
I recently returned to the
campus after a year away, and I
still see those unfortunate,
pseudo-intellectual movie
reviews gracing the pages of The
Daily. The Aug. 6 review of
"Silverado" is a notable addition

Since when does a movie, let
alone a western, require "some
real reason to exist"? I hope
there are a few others out there
who will admit to liking —
maybe even loving — this film,
for the simple reason that it is
damn good entertainment. Of
course there are problems with
character development, scripts
and overacting. But what western
escapes from such stuff? It's as if
Joe Mader doesn't realize that
the movie is supposed to be
kind of corny.
I get the feeling, however,
whenever I read this type of
review, that the critic has
marched into the theater with

pad and pen in hand, a mini
flashlight by which to see his
scribbles, and a big chip on his
shoulder. In short, he's ready to
prove to his readers that nothing
gets past him. Even if the movie
is fun, pleasantly corny, full of
action and well worth two hours
and a bucket of popcorn, he's
going to make sure that nobody
mistakes him for Joe Average
Fool Movie Consumer.
My advice to Daily readers:
Don't take other people's advice
. . . just go see the movie if it
looks like it would be fun — and
this one is.

Questions on Saga
and Coffee House
Five months ago, a University
manager gave me alarming infor
mation. She said that, public
statements to the contrary, the
administration has made plans
for several years to turn over
much of campus food service to
an outside corporation, most
likely Saga. Saga is the giant food
conglomerate that is currently
taking over Tresidder's food
service including the student
Coffee House.
She said that prominent among
the officials who formulated this
plan is William Massy, vice
president of business and
finance. Under this plan, Univer
sity kitchen equipment in the
dorms will most likely be sold to
Saga,' and the kitchen space
leased for Saga's use. This plan
would be put into effect during
the summer, when most students
are gone.
I took this and other informa
tion cautiously, hoping she was
wrong. The way Saga was
brought into Tresidder, however,
supports what she said. Saga now
has a convenient stepping stone
into the dorms.
I plan to cover what workers
have to lose in another letter.
However, since students here
have much to lose from Saga
taking over, I urge the ASSU
and other groups on campus to
get to the bottom of this issue by
demanding from the administra
tion public answers to these
questions:
1) Are there plans to turn
dorm food services over to Saga?
2) What role did Massy play in
formulating these plans?

3) Does Massy own Saga
stock?
4) What donations has Saga
given to Stanford Hospital and
the University?
5) Is Tresidder Director Ellie
Oppenheim's husband vice
president of Saga's Straw Hat
division?
6) Who selected, and by what
methods, the Tresidder commit
tee that recently "made the deci
sion" to have Saga take over
Tresidder food services?
7) Finally, what do students at
Stanford Hospital, Menlo Col
lege and the University of Santa
Clara think of Saga food?
I urge students to investigate,
to protect yourselves, first, to stop
Saga at the Coffee House before
they roll into the dorms, and
second, to protest this kind of
behind-the-door decision
making.
To the administration I say it is
a crying shame that your lack of
candor and wheeling and dealing
is such an education in sleaze to
the students here.

Say again?
Your statement in the Aug. 6
editorial, "Nuclear war is no
more terrible than any conven
tional war in the past" requires
some explanation. Are you im
plying that we could rebuild our
civilization in the aftermath of a
nuclear war? If so, you are sadly
mistaken. If not, what are you
trying to say?

Wheelchairs
not confining
Thanks for an interesting edi
torial on the Opus/South Africa
issue (Daily, Aug. 2). In an age
of reductionism, it is stirring,
somehow, to witness such an
attempt at synthesis.
I'd like to point out, though,
that your description of Cutter
John as "confined to a wheel
chair" is inaccurate. Readers of
Bloom County have seen Cutter

sitting on a couch, lying in the
meadow and even seducing his
ladyfriend in bed. Of course,
real-life people are not confined
to their wheelchairs either; the
chair is a tool for locomotion, not
an element of personhood.
Terms like "confined,"
"wheelchair-bound" and
"wheelchair person" are often
perceived as offensive by people
who use wheelchairs. Similarly,
people who are strongly commit
ted to a cause like the elimina
tion of apartheid may be offen
ded when their efforts and goals
are treated humorously. We
cannot always know which terms
