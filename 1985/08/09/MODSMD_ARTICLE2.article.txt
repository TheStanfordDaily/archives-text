# USW, University begin bargaining
## 
### REBECCA ZEIGLER Staff writer 
The United Stanford Workers
(USW), representing 1,300 tech
nical, maintenance and service
workers at Stanford, brought
their contract revision proposals
before the University Wednes
day. The contract proposals, in
cluding wage increases, benefit
improvements, training opportu
nities and job security provisions,
would amend the current con
tract, which expires Aug. 31.
One-fourth of USW's bargain
ing unit is affected by these
proposals. "It's not greed on our
part," said USW President Den
nis Blake. "We're trying to cor
rect the unfairness of Stanford's
pay scales."
The USW is asking for a 10
percent base salary raise, and a

variety of other incremental wage
alterations that would increase
certain employees' salaries from
2.5 to 25 percent.
USW is proposing most of
these wage realignments on the
basis of a USW comparable worth
survey. The union contends that
USW wages should be similar to
those paid workers doing compa
rable work for other employers,
such as the University of Califor
nia, Lawrence Livermore Labs
and Santa Clara County.
"Stanford workers have been
getting up to 25 percent less than
others working for comparable
employers," Blake said.
"Stanford can afford to pay thfe
market value. You should get the
same money for doing the same
work."
Part of these wage realign
ments involve a comparable
worth proposal for the life science
and medical research technician
classifications — posts currently
dominated by women. Presently
these employees receive 10 to 25
percent less than their mainly
male counterparts in the physical
sciences.
In addition, USW is asking for
an increase in seniority-based
raises. Under the present five
step system, workers are periodi
cally awarded 5 percent pay raises
— except between steps 4 and 5,
where the raise is 2.5 percent.

USW is asking that the raise be
tween these levels be increased to
meet the 5 percent increases.
'*In the bargaining unit there
are over 300 classifications," ex
plained Douglas Dupen, director
of personnel at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center and
one of the University's three
member negotiating team. "The
union has proposed that certain
of these classifications should
receive an additional 25 percent.
We hope to find out why next
Wednesday." The next meeting
between the two groups is sched
uled for Wednesday.
The USW job security proposal
also calls on Stanford to offer
more job training opportunities
to ensure that laid-off employees
have preference over outsiders

for new job openings.
According to Blake, USW is
also currently having pension ex
perts investigate Stanford pension
structures in an effort to enact
complete divestment of USW
pension funds from companies
doing business with South Africa.
Both sides said the negotiations
will be difficult, but said they
hope that drastic measures are
avoided.
"It is early to see where the
University is coming from," said
Blake, "but I think they are
looking for more of a free hand. It
could be tough."
"Labor relations, as a rule are
difficult," said Dupren. "The
tone of negotiations so far has
been pleasant, and I hope that it
continues to work out that way."
