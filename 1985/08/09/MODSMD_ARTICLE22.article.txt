Talking Heads
"Little Creatures" (Sire)
Well, the Heads have done it again —
while avoiding pigeonholing and musical
stagnation, they have produced an
eminently listenable and lasting pop mas
terwork. This record is bound to satisfy
their fans both old and new. Comparisons
to their earlier work are justified, but they
also manage to break new ground (for
them) artistically. Their sound is more ac
cessible and warmer. The lyrics remain
somewhat quirky, of course, but the sub
jects seem more commonplace and identi
fiable (a television over a psycho killer or a
great curve). There are numbers on
domestic bliss ("Creatures of Love," "Stay
Up Late," "Perfect World"), television
("Television Man") and even odes to
women ("And She Was," "The Lady
Don't Mind"). The band sounds very loose
and comfortable, as if it were jamming
at a Fourth of July cookout.
Musically the sound has been altered
somewhat since their last studio LP
("Speaking in Tongues," 1983) and tour
("Stop Making Sense," 1984). Gone are
the drum machines, the huge entourage of
supporting players and the heavy Afro
beat sound. The influences of that period,
however, remain manifest both in the
rhythm section (especially Chris Frantz's
drumming) and in David Bryne's loose
call/response vocals. Overall, this LP seems
to be an attempt to integrate the lead Head
(Bryne) more into the group as a whole.
The results sound awfully impressive.

Fela Anikulapo Kuti
"Army Arrangement" (Celluloid)
Fela is the most popular musician ever to
have come from Nigeria, and he has
released more than 40 records internation
ally, which have sold hundreds of
thousands of copies. His fiery, uncompro
mising, revolutionary Afro-beat funk-jazz
makes Gil Scott-Heron and Pharoh
Sanders look as committed as Lionel

Ritchie by comparison. Fela's outspoken
opposition to the Obsango government has
cost him dearly: He has lost his home,
recording studio, his recording career
(perhaps), his wives, the life of his mother
and his freedom. He now rots in the in
famous Kiri prison doing five years hard
time on a trumped up currency violation
charge.
Enough history, onto the music. After a
few uneven albums of late, his latest
release is a welcome return to peak form.

This might even be the record which
breaks him in America. Bill Laswell (of
Material fame) co-produced "Army Ar
rangement" once Fela was imprisoned, and
together they break new ground. For the
first time, one hears synthesizers and syn
copated drum machines, but they comple
ment and enhance rather than distract
from the sound. Not to worry though, the
militant lyrics and slashing sax chops are as
hard hitting as ever. Egypt 80 (Fela's band)
is very tight — providing a good, solid ryth

mic punch. This three-cut LP is among
Fela's best work, creating a great groove
that is tightly focused and never meanders
thanks to Laswell. One hopes that Fela's
name will become the household word in
America that Nelson Mandela's is today,
without having to spend the equivalent
time in jail. The real question is whether
Fela will be allowed to hear this while in
jail, for as he says, "Music is the weapon."

Various Artists
"The Enigma Variations" (Enigma)
Enigma Records is a Los Angeles-based
label that has released a load of albums and
EPs from the best and the worst of L.A.'s
underground music scene during the past
three years. This two-record compilation
contains a wide-ranging assortment of the
best, a handful of throwaways and a lot of
music you just won't hear anywhere else.
The Good Stuff — Tex And The Horse
heads ("Oh Mother"), Channel 3 ("True
West"), The Leaving Trains ("Leaving
Trains"), Green On Red ("Sixteen Ways
II") and Game Theory ("24"). The Ran
dom and Bizarre Stuff— John Trubee ("A
Blind Man's Penis"), Scott Goddard
("Cowpunk"), SSQ ("Playback ') and
Screamin' Sirens ("Maniac"). Needless
Abuse — Jet Black Berries, Plasticland,
Passionnel, The Pool and Kraut.
And if you're not wearing paisley, or you
don't own a Lava Lamp, listen to it
anyway, you just might like it.
B
Koko Taylor
"Queen of the Blues" (Alligator)
Ms. Taylor's latent release on Alligator
records is ample justification of her title as
Queen of the Chicago Blues. She
dominates this record vocally and makes it
her own. Her accompanying cast is first
rate (Albert Collins, Lonnie Brooks and
Son Seals among other notables), but

Taylor is always in front and in charge.
Her sound, while "big" in the fine blues
tradition of Bessie Smith, Big Mama Thor
ton and Mahalia Jackson, is as passionate
and humorous as Millie Jackson or Donna
Summer. She is a forceful woman (and
singer) who knows how to tell her man
where he should be and what she is going
to do. "Queen of the Blues" is as satisfying
an album as she has crafted in her long
career.
Taylor turns in some show-stopping per
formances, notably on "I Cried Like A
Baby," when her passion and emotion
command everyone's attention and
respect. Throughout this album she shows
herself to be capable of shifting gears and
still romping. The Chicago blues have al
ways been capable of the boogie-woogie,
and on a few tracks Taylor engages in some
rocking stompers ("Evil," "Flamin'
Mamie," "Come To Mama"). This is a
blues record for the '80s; pro-feminist,
upbeat urban blues — Koko Taylor is a
force to be reckoned with. Steal this record
— you'll never regret it.
B +
Danny and Dusty
"The Lost Weekend" (A&M)
Consider this: You get together with
some old buddies of yours, shoot the bull
for a while and decide to pick up a few cold

ones. On the way to the liquor store, some
body gets the wild notion to fetch the
guitars and some bongos and head out to
that crazy old abandoned warehouse south
of the tracks — make it a real party.
"Better make that a few cases" some
body says,"It may be a long one." And
everyone piles into the truck and heads her
on down Main Street. Yup, it's gonna be a
long one all right. . .
Can you imagine making a living doing
this? Well, maybe you don't want To, but
Dan "Danny" Stuart (of Green On Red)
and Steve "Dusty" Wynn (of The Dream
Syndicate) seemingly manage to do just
this with their aptly titled album, "The
Lost Weekend." Maybe it wasn't quite so
spontaneous, or the party quite so raucous,
but you sure coulda fooled me. This slice-o'-
fun LP captures some good ol' boys havin'
a good ol' time gettin' a wee bit liquored
up, and shoot, ain't nuthin' wrong with
that, now is there?
And who cares if they're just L.A. boys,
and they got themselves a studio instead of
a warehouse, or even if it actually did take
longer than a weekend to complete the
party. What we got here is some good old
fashioned, cry-in-your-beer songwritin'
("Baby, We All Gotta Go Down," "The
King Of The Losers") thrown together
with some high spirited guitar an' fiddle
playin' (mostly by members of The Long
Ryders) — the makin's for a rip-roarer if I
ever did see one. And it just might be a
long one after all.
