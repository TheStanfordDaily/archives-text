Talking Heads
"Little Creatures" (Sire)
Well, the Heads have done it again —
while avoiding pigeonholing and musical
stagnation, they have produced an
eminently listenable and lasting pop mas
terwork. This record is bound to satisfy
their fans both old and new. Comparisons
to their earlier work are justified, but they
also manage to break new ground (for
them) artistically. Their sound is more ac
cessible and warmer. The lyrics remain
somewhat quirky, of course, but the sub
jects seem more commonplace and identi
fiable (a television over a psycho killer or a
great curve). There are numbers on
domestic bliss ("Creatures of Love," "Stay
Up Late," "Perfect World"), television
("Television Man") and even odes to
women ("And She Was," "The Lady
Don't Mind"). The band sounds very loose
and comfortable, as if it were jamming
at a Fourth of July cookout.
Musically the sound has been altered
somewhat since their last studio LP
("Speaking in Tongues," 1983) and tour
("Stop Making Sense," 1984). Gone are
the drum machines, the huge entourage of
supporting players and the heavy Afro
beat sound. The influences of that period,
however, remain manifest both in the
rhythm section (especially Chris Frantz's
drumming) and in David Bryne's loose
call/response vocals. Overall, this LP seems
to be an attempt to integrate the lead Head
(Bryne) more into the group as a whole.
The results sound awfully impressive.

Fela Anikulapo Kuti
"Army Arrangement" (Celluloid)
Fela is the most popular musician ever to
have come from Nigeria, and he has
released more than 40 records internation
ally, which have sold hundreds of
thousands of copies. His fiery, uncompro
mising, revolutionary Afro-beat funk-jazz
makes Gil Scott-Heron and Pharoh
Sanders look as committed as Lionel

Ritchie by comparison. Fela's outspoken
opposition to the Obsango government has
cost him dearly: He has lost his home,
recording studio, his recording career
(perhaps), his wives, the life of his mother
and his freedom. He now rots in the in
famous Kiri prison doing five years hard
time on a trumped up currency violation
charge.
Enough history, onto the music. After a
few uneven albums of late, his latest
release is a welcome return to peak form.

This might even be the record which
breaks him in America. Bill Laswell (of
Material fame) co-produced "Army Ar
rangement" once Fela was imprisoned, and
together they break new ground. For the
first time, one hears synthesizers and syn
copated drum machines, but they comple
ment and enhance rather than distract
from the sound. Not to worry though, the
militant lyrics and slashing sax chops are as
hard hitting as ever. Egypt 80 (Fela's band)
is very tight — providing a good, solid ryth

mic punch. This three-cut LP is among
Fela's best work, creating a great groove
that is tightly focused and never meanders
thanks to Laswell. One hopes that Fela's
name will become the household word in
America that Nelson Mandela's is today,
without having to spend the equivalent
time in jail. The real question is whether
Fela will be allowed to hear this while in
jail, for as he says, "Music is the weapon."

don't own a Lava Lamp, listen to it

Koko Taylor
"Queen of the Blues" (Alligator)
Ms. Taylor's latent release on Alligator
records is ample justification of her title as
Queen of the Chicago Blues. She
dominates this record vocally and makes it
her own. Her accompanying cast is first
rate (Albert Collins, Lonnie Brooks and
Son Seals among other notables), but
