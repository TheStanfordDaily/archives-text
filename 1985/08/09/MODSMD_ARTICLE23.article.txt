## ’til Tuesday: Some things can wait 
### 
Hush, hush, everybody.
America has another new band
and, of course, another debut al
bum to fill the shelves of record
stores throughout the country.
This time the band is 'til Tues
day, and its album, "Voices
Carry," has already produced one
hit and a second single scheduled
to be released this week.
The new band's "new" sound is
proving to be very popular with
the record-buying public, as
"Voices Carry" has risen to No.
23 after 14 weeks on the
charts.
Til Tuesday, however, really
does not have a fresh, distinctive
sound of its own, as lead singer
Aimee Mann manages to incor
porate just about every successful
style popular in the last five years.
Mann often sounds as if she can't
decide whether to sound tough,
like Pat Benatar, or soft and
strong like Terri Nunn, lead
singer for Berlin. At times Mann
sounds remarkably similar to
Lena Lamont, the squeaky voiced
starlet of the 1952 movie musical,
"Singin' in the Rain."
There is no doubt that Aimee
Mann carries with her a wide
range of vocal abilities. However,
she has a strange habit of playing
vocal games with her songs, as
each and every recording on the
album sounds like an experiment
in style. It is fine to experiment

with different techniques, but
when a band cuts their initial al
bum, having a set "sound" would
be to its advantage. This is where
Mann fails. She would be wise to
decide in her own mind how and
when she sounds her best. Her
cool, aching soprano is at its best
when she sings at a controlled
level. Once she begins to reach
for a little extra, the quality of her
voice suffers dramatically.
While Aimee Mann's voice
may be hard to become ac
customed to, her outstanding
songwriting talent is clearly evi
dent on "Voices Carry." 'Til
Tuesday's rich lyrics and rythmic
instrumentals almost make up for
Mann's indecision as to which
voice she wants to employ. To
gether, the music and conceptual
lyrics form a listenable new al
bum.
Combine these factors and
"Voices Carry" becomes an in
teresting, although unintentional,
concept album revolving around
affairs of the human heart —
depressing, dreary affairs of the
heart. After listening to "Voices
Carry," one cannot help but feel
sorry for poor Aimee Mann. If
her lyrics come straight out of
personal experiences with
relationships, she is leading a sad
life.
If you're feeling down and want

to listen to some uplifting music,
stay away from "Voices Carry";
listening to it might make you cry,
as 'til Tuesday is hardly walking
on sunshine. There are none of
the feelings associated with love
or happiness — everything is
pain. This can be said for the
entire album. Their single,
"Voices Carry," epitomizes this
attitude: "He wants me, but only
part of the time. He wants me, if
he can keep me in line." The new
single, "Looking over My
Shoulder," again goes to
painstaking measures to establish
the tone of misery. "No More
Crying" and "Don't Watch Me
Bleed" also display the sad

realization of love, as the titles
suggest.
The band itself, however, does
not have such a melancholy back
ground. Mann, born and raised in
Virginia, went to Boston in 1979
to attend the renowned Berklee
School of Music. After a year and
a half of studying there, however,
she left the school to pursue her
own career in music. Her first
group, The Young Snakes,
enjoyed moderate success
primarily on the East Coast, but
broke up after two years of
mediocrity.
In 1982, after fine-tuning her
songwriting skills, Mann met
London-born guitarist/vocalist

Robert Holmes, and together
they formed the nucleus of 'til
Tuesday. They were soon joined
by two former Boston under
ground musicians — drummer
Michael Hausmann and keyboard
player Joey Pesce.
Depending on what you expect,
the album will be a disappoint
ment or a pleasant surprise; 'til
Tuesday definitely has some tal
ent and perhaps a bright future
ahead of them. However, when
Aimee Mann begins to turn her
voice inside-out, it could make
most listeners turn to another al
bum.
