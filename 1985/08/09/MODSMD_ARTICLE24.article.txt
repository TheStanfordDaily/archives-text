## Top of the Mark is tops in taste 
### 
This might just be the ultimate way to
impress your date: Sipping chilled orange
juice and feasting on a tantalizing array of
culinary delights while gazing over the
breath-taking expanse of San Francisco
provides one of the most romantic scenes
imaginable.
Sunday brunch at the prestigious Top of
the Mark sounds like something a Stanford
student might contemplate wistfully, but
never actually do. Reconsider: The combi
nation of an excellent and abundant buffet,
waiters who treat you like royalty and a
panoramic view of "The City" supply an
experience not soon to be forgotten.
For those who are at least uncertain, the
restaurant is situated on the top floor of the
Mark Hopkins Inter-Continental Hotel,
located at 1 Nob Hill, San Francisco. Once
inside, you are pleasantly greeted by a red
coated doorman, and after stumbling,
mouth agape, through the the spacious,
elaborately-decorated lobby, an elevator
whisks you up to the floor above the 18 —
labelled simply "T."
Upon exiting the elevator, you will find
yourself in a small, mirrored sitting room
where a handsome man in a black tuxedo
asks your name. Keep in mind that you
need reservations for this place, and if you
are late for them, (we were by 45 minutes)
you will have to wait.
The brunch runs from 11 a.m to 3 p.m.
on Sunday only, and the parking garage
beneath the Mark Hopkins costs $4 for the
first hour, so if you're looking for a parking
place on the street, be sure to give yourself
plenty of time.
The wait for your table — and the over
heard raving of patrons going down the
elevator after their meal — is made a little
easier by the fabulous view of San Fran
cisco Bay and Alcatraz. The windows rise
from about knee-high to the ceiling and
enclose the restaurant so that it is virtually
impossible to receive a "bad" seat.

The interior of the Top of the Mark is as
tastefully designed as the hors d'oeuvre
trays were arranged. Yet another tuxedoed
man softly plays a black grand piano on a
slightly raised platform. Tables wrapped in
white tablecloths are scattered generously
apart on the luxurious carpet. And in a
spot a few steps higher than the dining
area, the buffet is spread out.
Ah, yes, the buffet. Delectable as it was,
it seemed only another piece in the jigsaw
experience of the Top of the Mark. The
puzzle was fitting perfectly, and by this
point, my guest and I virtually expected the
food to look and taste as good as it did.
The brunch is presented on four large
tables, with widely differing foods on each.
After a waiter took our orders for juice ($3
a glass), we headed for the one that con
sisted mainly of breakfast-type selections.
Filling our plates with French toast, muf
fins, blueberry and cream tarts, kiwi and
strawberry tarts, pastries, croissants and
scrumptious coconut macaroons, we
returned to our table and our view.

This is a brunch to be languished over —
it is easy to spend a few hours gazing over
the city and letting your stomach become
accustomed to all the differing tastes. The
next table we sampled consisted of every
appetizer imaginable, and quite a few that
probably defied most imaginations.
Some of the more notable selections in
cluded a shrimp and pineapple dish, crab
legs, salmon and fresh fruit salad. The
plates all looked as though they had been
created by an artist, with tiny squares of
toasted bread painstakingly covered with
various spreads, each individual slice of
ham carefully and lovingly wrapped, and
the whole display surrounded by an in
credible ice sculpture. The only hors
d'oeurve that may have been a little too
creative was one that was contained within
the gaping bellies of real fish — not terribly
appetizing for an appetizer.
Already feeling rather full, my guest and
I approached the table designated for use
with the large, dinner-sized plates. Here

were enough entrees to satisfy the diner
who craves variety.
A chef — complete with a tall, floppy
white hat — carved roast beef, and
chicken, beef and oyster dishes were pre
sented in steaming metal pans. Vegetable
combinations and several types of potatoes
were also available, providing a sharp con
trast to the foods more suited for breakfast
and also offering far too many choices to
sample at one sitting. We regretted not
being able to identify more of these main
courses, but we sampled what appealed to
us on appearance alone.
The dessert table at the Top of the Mark
is the restaurant's crowning glory. Crumbly
apple pie with cream rests beside chocolate
cake with chocolate icing, raspberry pie
competes with blueberry cream puffs and
delectable cheese cake topped with
peaches, tall glasses of pudding and fruit
display themselves temptingly, and an in
credible selection of cheeses tops the table
off. The only disappointment here was that
we weren't able to try everything in front
of us. We finally completed the meal cer
tain that we wouldn't be able to eat an
other bite for quite a while, but extremely
glad we had managed to save room for
these delicacies.
By now you must be wondering exactly
how much all this elegance and fine food
cost. We were having the same thoughts, as
the subject of the bill is kept a secret — no
menus, signs or waiters offer to let you in
on the big surprise. The check came to a
total of $53 with brunch at $19.50 a person
and beverages rounding out the bill.
Obviously this is not an experience to be
undertaken every weekend, but consider
ing the extent of the exquisite food and the
storybook setting, Top of the Mark is a
temptation not to be resisted during your
time at Stanford.
