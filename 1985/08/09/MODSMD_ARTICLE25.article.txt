SOSA members, Kennedy meet
According to a Stanford Out of South
Africa (SOSA) press release, five members
of the group met with University President
Donald Kennedy Wednesday afternoon to
discuss his stance on divestment in light of
the state of emergency in South Africa.
The appointments were arranged follow
ing a July 27 protest during which a group
of protesters was denied entrance to the
President's Office.
Kennedy was very critical of the Reagan
Administration and its foreign policy, ac
cording to the release, citing specifically
dissatisfaction with U.S. failure to follow

France's lead in isolating South Africa.
Kennedy reportedly defended his previous
stance that divestment by non-profit or
ganizations is not effective and instead
urged the students to lobby legislators to
bring about economic sanctions.
