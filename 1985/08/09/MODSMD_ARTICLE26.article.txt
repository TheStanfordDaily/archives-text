It had to happen sometime. Sophomore
Patrick McEnroe, who spent his freshman
year at Stanford answering questions about
his more famous brother, was scheduled to
play No. 1 seed John McEnroe at the
Volvo tournament in Stratton, Vt. The
pairing resulted from a random draw.

after which he opted to turn professional.
Meanwhile, in the same tournament,
senior Dan Goldie lost his second-round

Swimmers post national triumphs
Three Stanford swimmers won events at
the U.S. Long Course Championships in
Mission Viejo this week.
