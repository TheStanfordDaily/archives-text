# New campus animal research facility opens
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Editorial staff 
A new $11 million Research
Animal Facility will allow Stan
ford scientists complete control of
temperature, light and humidity
conditions during animal experi
ments, thereby permitting state
of-the-art research accuracy.
Constructed during a period of
nationwide conflict between re
searchers and animal rights
groups, the new facility offers
"the highest standards of research
. . . while ensuring that our
animals will receive the best care
obtainable," according to
Thomas Hamm, director of the
facility's Division of Laboratory
Medicine. Representatives of
local humane societies, however,
believe the new center fails to
provide adequately for the
animals it houses.
"Fortunately, most of what is
good for research is also good for
the well-being of the animals,"
Hamm was quoted as saying in a
medical center news release.
"You can't accomplish careful,
competent research on highly
stressed animals."
Animal care technicians are in
the process of moving animals,
ranging from mice and rats to
chickens and sheep, into the new
facility, which is located under
ground, with tunnels connecting
to other research areas of the
Medical Center.
Kim Sturla, director of society
services at the Penninsula
Humane Society, said yesterday
that although the facilities may be
more scientifically improved,
many animals will remain in
cramped cages.

"We need to look at ways of
creating a stimulating environ
ment for the animals," Sturla said
yesterday. "That issue always gets
brushed off too easily."
Sturla said the cages at the
facility, at least for some animals,
are too small as well as uni
nteresting to the animals.
Joanne Bloom, clinical director
of the Laboratory Medicine Divi
sion, noted that the new animal
facility was built at a time when

important research funding
groups such as the American
Heart Association and the Na
tional Institute of Health were
becoming increasingly selective
about the quality of the research
institutions they supported.
"They're very concerned with en
vironmental conditions," Bloom
said.
"The facility wasn't built as
result of pressure from animal
rights groups," Bloom said.

"They consider the new facility
irrelevent, since they prefer no
research at all. But better condi
tions may allow better grants."
Lise Giraud, a member of the
board of directors of the Palo
Alto Humane Society, yesterday
accused Hamm of ignoring the
views of animal rights groups, ec
hoing similar comments of
Sturla's that while many other
colleges (such as UC-Berkeley and
UC-Davis) allow active participation

and review by animal rights or
ganizations, Stanford has refused
to allow such a representative on
the University's Administrative
Panel for Laboratory Animal
Care. Giraud quoted Hamm as
saying that "the humane societies
have nothing to add."
But Hamm, who chairs the
panel, said earlier yesterday that
individual animal experiments are
carefully reviewed and that five of
the panel's members are "non
scientists." Hamm described the
new facility as "one of the few
animal care facilities in the
country where professional per
sonnel . . . are available round-the
clock for the care of animals," ac
cording to Medical Center News
Service.
Both Giraud and Sturla,
however, said the facility's tech
nological capabilities did not ad
dress the issue of humane treat
ment of research animals.
"We think the new facility is
state-of-the-art for research,"
Giraud said, "But it's a barren,
underground bunker for animals
to spend months, even years."
Giraud said the new center is
"totally devoid of environmental
enhancement for animals."
"What characterizes the
cages," she said, "is the ease with
which they can be cleaned."
The news release said the
facility's new projects would in
clude research on the effects that
excercise and diet have on the
aging process. Without the new
facility, the research project
would not have received all the
available grant money, according
to the news service.
