## Stanford labels shuttle mission a success 
### REBECCA ZEIGLER Staff writer 
After being riddled by launch
delays, malfunctions and a lower
than-desired orbit, the space
shuttle Challenger landed safely
at Edwards Air Force Base Tues
day afternoon, bringing spectacu
lar data to scientists at Stanford
and elsewhere.
The mission was monitored by
a group of Stanford researchers
and students in Stanford's
SUNSTAR (Stanford University
Network for Space Telescience
Applications Research) lab.
"After 14 to 16 hour shifts for
eight days, everyone's kind of
spacy now," said Stanford re
searcher Roger Williamson, who
recently returned from Johnson
Space Center in Houston where
he has been monitoring his Vehi
cle Charging and Potential
(VCAP) experiments aboard the
shuttle.
One of the primary experi
ments on the mission, involving a
Plasma Diagnostic Package
Satellite (PDP), proved very suc
cessful. While simultaneously
firing an electron beam from its
bay, the Challenger orbited the
PDP.
Scientists, including William
son, were concerned that the PDP
would fail to detect any evidence
of the electron beams. However,
the satellite recorded electron
beams propagating up to 300
meters from the shuttle.
"Now that we know that the
experiment is possible and that
the beam does propagate away
from the shuttle, the question is
how far does the beam propagate
and how does it change with dis
tance," Williamson said.
"An interesting feature of this
data was that they (electron
beams) produced electric fields
and particles in addition to the
plasma waves we expected. It
taught us a lot about the effects of

emitting an electron beam on the
environment of the space
shuttle," he said.
The experiment required firing
electron beams through the
shuttle's magnetic field to deter
mine if the PDP satellite could
detect the beams. The difficulties
of flying the shuttle this precisely
made questionable the possibility
of conducting the experiment.
"Shuttle Commander Gordan
Fullerton was able to consistently
fly the shuttle near the magnetic
field line through the PDP," said
Williamson. "On the third pass,
he flew within 19 feet, which is

very close for such a complicated
maneuver."
In order to measure electron
beam emissions farther than the
shuttle's 300 meter capacity, re
searchers both with SUNSTAR
and in Houston matched specific
points when Challenger would
come within 1,000 to 3,000
kilometers of the Dynamic Ex
plorer I satellite. Because the
shuttle and satellite were on dif
ferent orbits, researchers on
ground had to select very specific
times when the two would pass.
"We were able to meet the dif
ficult conditions four different

times, which was an unprece
dented success," said Williamson.
"There is a good possibility of de
tecting plasma wave emissions
from the Dynamic Explorer I. We
will know in a few weeks."
Through close monitoring of
the amount of electrical energy
and fuel aboard the shuttle,
NASA was able to extend the
mission an extra day. When scien
tists in Houston met every 12
hours during the flight, one of
their vital topics was the rate of
fuel consumption.
The principle limitation on the
length of a shuttle flight is using

up the "consumables," hydrogen
and oxygen, which create the
electrical energy essential for
fuel. By the fourth day of the
flight, it was apparent that
enough consumables were on
board for an extra day of orbit for
the Challenger.
During the added day, the
shuttle scientists conducted an ex
periment in conjunction with the
Optical Observatories on Maui,
Hawaii. During the night, the
space shuttle was flown at an an
gle where it was capable of direct
ing an electron beam towards
Maui.
"Nothing obvious came from
this experiment," Williamson
noted. "If there is any positive
result, it will be in more careful
analysis of the data." SUNSTAR
calculations were essential for the
Maui pass. "Throughout the
flight, SUNSTAR gave support to
and ran calculations for Houston
(Johnson Space Center)."
On Monday, the shuttle
beamed back to earth detailed
pictures of the sun's surface,
showing changes in the sun's
magnetic fields. The Solar Optical
Universal Polarimeter (SOUP), a
$60 million dollar instrument,
failed to turn on earlier during the
mission and was declared dead.
During a routine check Sunday by
a ground controller, the instru
ment came back to life.
NASA officials have spec
ulated that a jet firing Sunday had
shaken and consequently fixed
something in the SOUP instru
ment. SOUP studies the strength,
structure and evolution of mag
netic fields in the solar atmos
phere.
Now that the mission has been
completed, the next step for
SUNSTAR involves comprehen
sive data analysis, to take place
over the next year. "It's a job far
from over," noted a tired Wil
liamson. "We're just beginning."
