Stanford administrators said
they do not think a new Depart
ment of Education proposal an
nounced Tuesday to collect on
delinquent student loans will sig
nificantly affect Stanford
graduates.
Education Secretary William
Bennett said Tuesday that his de
partment is asking the IRS to
withhold tax refunds for 1 million
defaulters on federal student
loans unless they start paying
their debts.
Another 1 million borrowers
will get notices from state
agencies warning that they will be
denied federal tax refunds next
year unless they make good on
their debts. The states are acting

on loans made by state agencies
and insured by the federal gov
ernment.
Stanford loaned students $7.5
million under the federal
Guaranteed Student Loan and
$3.6 million under the National
Direct Student Loan programs
during the 1984-85 school year,
according Roberta Johnson, asso
ciate director of financial aids at
Stanford.
The University has only about
a 3 percent default rate on the
NDSL program, "one of the
smallest in the nation," Johnson
said. And, on the GSL program,
which state officials help monitor,
Johnson said she had been told
that Stanford had "one of the
lowest default rates in the state."
Johnson declined to comment
on the new plan, but said she felt
"there has been a lot of bad press
on this issue." She said she
suspected that if student loan
default rates were compared to
default rates on commercial
loans, the public might have a dif
ferent perception of the problem.
"There has been so much em
phasis on default rates," Johnson
said. "It's gotten a lot of bad
press."
Washington officials were opti
mistic about the results the new
approach would attain. "I think
it's going to be without a doubt

the most successful thing we've
ever done to recover defaulted
loans, said Richard Hastings,
director of debt collection for the
department.
"We're talking probably
hundreds of millions" of dollars,
he said.
Department officials say
former undergraduate and
graduate students have defaulted
on $3 billion in low-interest loans
subsidized by the federal govern
ment under the Guaranteed Stu
dent Loan program. Another
$1.1 billion has been defaulted in
the National Direct Student Loan
program of low-interest loans to
students through their schools.
The move was welcomed by the
National Association of Student
Financial Aid Administrators.
