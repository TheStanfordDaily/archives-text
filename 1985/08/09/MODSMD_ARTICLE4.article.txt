# Exploring the Standard

Students at Stanford are expected to show both
within and without the University such respect for
order, morality, personal honor and the rights of
others as is demanded of good citizens. Failure to
do this will be sufficient cause for removal from
the University. — The Fundamental Standard

News Analysis

While the text of the Fundamental Standard
reads like some prep school code admonishing
students to behave like ladies and gentlemen, its
practical meaning has been refined considerably
since it was authored in 1906.
Although no official announcement has yet
been made, the code may now be in the process
of being refined again: After decades of drunk
driving on campus, the Stanford Judicial Council
found sophomore Joseph Anderson guilty two
weeks ago of violating the Fundamental Stan
dard. Anderson was arrested in April for al

legedly driving on campus with too high a blood
alcohol content. This would be the first time a
student was punished under the standard for
driving under the influence of alcohol.
What is the Fundamental Standard and how is
it established? Should driving while intoxicated
be punishable under the Fundamental Standard?
Should the courts handle it? Several University
experts on the Fundamental Standard were con
sulted on these and other questions.
The wording of the Fundamental Standard "is
an outgrowth of the conditions in the early 1900s
when we were, in fact, as universities, supposed
to take care of the moral character, etc., [of stu
dents] as were the parents, so this (wording) is
outdated," commented Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons.
The Fundamental Standard is no longer used
to set a moral or ethical standard for Stanford
students, but instead is now interpreted as giving
the University the power to sup

special needs of a university.

plagarism are the two most ob
vious examples of areas in which
a university has special discipli

Instead, according to Jack
Friedenthal, a Law School profes
sor and former chairman of the
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC),
the University has relied on the
"common law" development of
the Fundamental Standard to de

Past rulings set precedents for
future cases and thereby translate
the Fundamental Standard into a

It is clear that the SJC should decide
specific cases like the Anderson case,
but should it be empowered to make
major policy changes?

mental Standard took place in the
mid-19605. During this period
the University dropped the con
cept of in loco parentis —
that the University had parental
rights and responsibilities toward
students — and developed much
of its policy regarding freedom of
political expression.
The clause in the Fundamental
Standard that gives equal empha
sis to infractions that occur "both
within and without the Univer
sity" was also voided during this
period, and it became University
policy to apply the Fundamental
Standard only to activities which
affect the University community.
Very few of the changes in the
practical meaning of the Funda
mental Standard have come
through explicit policy statements
or changes in written regulations.

mental Standard violations if the
students have already "suffered
enough" either from the incident
itself or from penalties imposed
by the court system. However, if
the University decides not to
prosecute a case, it is unclear
whether a precedent was set
declaring a certain activity to be
beyond the scope of the Funda
mental Standard or whether the
Fundamental Standard is applica
ble to the activity in question but
was just not used in this case.
An example occurred in 1981
when two students were killed in
a case of felony drunken driving
on campus. No action was taken
by the University against the
driver, making it unclear whether
the University simply felt that the
driver, who was injured in the
crash, had suffered enough or
whether drunken driving was
beyond the scope of the Funda
mental Standard.
Relying on precedents also
makes changing policy awkward.
Under a system of specific regula
tions, a new rule could be
promulgated that explicitly
changes University policy. But
under a common law system, an
old precedent may have to be
reversed, which leaves students
little guidance as to what the Fun
damental Standard really means.
Fundamental Standard inter
pretations are "interpretations of
the times, and the times change,"
Friedenthal explained. He added
that the University "might have
to make a few examples, as you
always do" when making a policy
change.

reversed this summer in the An

was due to the different goals of

courts rule on each charge sepa

matters such as the blood alcohol
level, the University likes to con

driving while intoxicated cases.
The court system's strength is its
emphasis on due process and its
ability to handle technical argu
ments. The SJCs strength is its
informality and flexibility.
Driving while intoxicated cases,
however, often rest on technical
points. Since the driving in ques
tion is not otherwise dangerous or
reckless, the whole case often
boils down to technical questions
of what was the defendant's blood
alcohol level at the time of
driving.

Perhaps the SCLC should decide the
question of whether driving while

Lyons declared.
Why does the University feel
the need to take action beyond
that of the courts?
Lyons said Stanford needs to
step in because local law enforce
ment agencies have not been able
to stop incidents of driving while
intoxicated on campus and that
University disciplinary proce
dures may be more effective in
curbing incidents of driving while
intoxicated than the courts are.

News Analysis

While the text of the Fundamental Standard
reads like some prep school code admonishing
students to behave like ladies and gentlemen, its
practical meaning has been refined considerably
since it was authored in 1906.
Although no official announcement has yet
been made, the code may now be in the process
of being refined again: After decades of drunk
driving on campus, the Stanford Judicial Council
found sophomore Joseph Anderson guilty two
weeks ago of violating the Fundamental Stan
dard. Anderson was arrested in April for al

legedly driving on campus with too high a blood
alcohol content. This would be the first time a
student was punished under the standard for
driving under the influence of alcohol.
What is the Fundamental Standard and how is
it established? Should driving while intoxicated
be punishable under the Fundamental Standard?
Should the courts handle it? Several University
experts on the Fundamental Standard were con
sulted on these and other questions.
The wording of the Fundamental Standard "is
an outgrowth of the conditions in the early 1900s
when we were, in fact, as universities, supposed
to take care of the moral character, etc., [of stu
dents] as were the parents, so this (wording) is
outdated," commented Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons.
The Fundamental Standard is no longer used
to set a moral or ethical standard for Stanford
students, but instead is now interpreted as giving
the University the power to sup
plement society's laws to meet the
special needs of a university.
Cheating on examinations and
plagarism are the two most ob
vious examples of areas in which
a university has special discipli
nary needs above those of the rest
of society.

Instead, according to Jack
Friedenthal, a Law School profes
sor and former chairman of the
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC),
the University has relied on the
"common law" development of
the Fundamental Standard to de
termine the specific meaning.
Past rulings set precedents for
future cases and thereby translate
the Fundamental Standard into a
behavioral code.
Common law development of
the Fundamental Standard gives
the University more flexibility

It is clear that the SJC should decide
specific cases like the Anderson case,
but should it be empowered to make
major policy changes?

mental Standard took place in the
mid-19605. During this period
the University dropped the con
cept of in loco parentis —
that the University had parental
rights and responsibilities toward
students — and developed much
of its policy regarding freedom of
political expression.
The clause in the Fundamental
Standard that gives equal empha
sis to infractions that occur "both
within and without the Univer
sity" was also voided during this
period, and it became University
policy to apply the Fundamental
Standard only to activities which
affect the University community.
Very few of the changes in the
practical meaning of the Funda
mental Standard have come
through explicit policy statements
or changes in written regulations.

mental Standard violations if the
students have already "suffered
enough" either from the incident
itself or from penalties imposed
by the court system. However, if
the University decides not to
prosecute a case, it is unclear
whether a precedent was set
declaring a certain activity to be
beyond the scope of the Funda
mental Standard or whether the
Fundamental Standard is applica
ble to the activity in question but
was just not used in this case.
An example occurred in 1981
when two students were killed in
a case of felony drunken driving
on campus. No action was taken
by the University against the
driver, making it unclear whether
the University simply felt that the
driver, who was injured in the
crash, had suffered enough or
whether drunken driving was
beyond the scope of the Funda
mental Standard.
Relying on precedents also
makes changing policy awkward.
Under a system of specific regula
tions, a new rule could be
promulgated that explicitly
changes University policy. But
under a common law system, an
old precedent may have to be
reversed, which leaves students
little guidance as to what the Fun
damental Standard really means.
Fundamental Standard inter
pretations are "interpretations of
the times, and the times change,"
Friedenthal explained. He added
that the University "might have
to make a few examples, as you
always do" when making a policy
change.

reversed this summer in the An

also avoids the need to write a

have the big handbook that a lot a

mented.
But using common law devel
opment also has disadvantages.
With no written behavioral regu
lations, it is difficult to know ex
actly what the rules are.
Lyons granted that "The Fun

provide much guidance any more

The Santa Clara County courts

Lyons said the difference be

was due to the different goals of
the the two tribunals. While the
courts rule on each charge sepa
rately and often stress technical
matters such as the blood alcohol
level, the University likes to con

driving while intoxicated cases.
The court system's strength is its
emphasis on due process and its
ability to handle technical argu
ments. The SJCs strength is its
informality and flexibility.
Driving while intoxicated cases,
however, often rest on technical
points. Since the driving in ques
tion is not otherwise dangerous or
reckless, the whole case often
boils down to technical questions
of what was the defendant's blood
alcohol level at the time of
driving.

Perhaps the SCLC should decide the
question of whether driving while
intoxicated properly falls within the
scope of the Fundamental Standard.

sider the incident as a whole and,
in a case like Anderson's, is more
concerned with the probable
range of his blood alcohol level
than the specific number. "The
University has its own sort of
criteria as to what is important,"
Lyons declared.
Why does the University feel
the need to take action beyond
that of the courts?
Lyons said Stanford needs to
step in because local law enforce
ment agencies have not been able
to stop incidents of driving while
intoxicated on campus and that
University disciplinary proce
dures may be more effective in
curbing incidents of driving while
intoxicated than the courts are.
Finally there is the question of
which system, the courts or the
SJC, is best suited to handle

Friedenthal argued that the
SJC certainly could prosecute
driving-while-intoxicated cases,
but left open the question of
whether they should. That is "a
question for judicial council inter
pretation," he added.
It is clear that the SJC should
decide specific cases like the An
derson case, but should it be em
powered to make major policy
changes, such as declaring driving
while intoxicated to be
punishable by the University?
Perhaps the Student Conduct
Legislative Council (SCLC), the
only University body with the au
thority "to promulgate legislation
involving disciplinary sanctions,"
should decide the question of
whether driving while intoxicated
properly falls within the scope of
the Fundamental Standard.
