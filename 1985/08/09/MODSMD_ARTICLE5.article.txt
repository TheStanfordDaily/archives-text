# Playboy calls flier 'ridiculous'
## News 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
A Playboy magazine official called a Tresidder
Union plan to attach copies of an anti-pornography
flier to copies of the October issue of Playboy
"ridiculous," as Stanford Students Opposed to Por
nography released the first draft of the flier.
"We think it's totally ridiculous," said Paul
Engleman, Playboy's director of publicity. "I think
they're trying to impose their views a little
strongly."
Under the proposal, drafted by the Tresidder
Product Selection Guidelines Committee and an
nounced Monday, all copies of the magazine on sale
in The Store would have a copy of the flier attached
to the cover.
The guidelines committee, which includes Tresid
der Director Ellie Oppenheim and Store Manager
Cesar Cervantes, decided to attach a flier to be co
written by STOP and Tresidder. The flier would be
attached to the cover with paper clips, according to
STOP member Vanessa Poster.
The October issue of Playboy, which goes on sale
Aug. 27, will contain a pictorial called "Girls of the
Pac-10," which will feature women from colleges in
the Pacific 10 Conference, including Stanford.
The pictorial will feature two women from Stan
ford, according to Engleman. Although he declined
to disclose their names, he said there will be
"autograph sessions and media interview opportu
nities for the girls in the local markets."
The session in the Bay Area would include the
women from Stanford and UC-Berkeley who ap
pear in the magazine. It would take place sometime
around the Aug. 27 release date at a yet-to-be de
termined location.

"Please consider in purchasing this magazine, you
directly support the industry it represents," the flier
opens.
"STOP (Stanford Students Opposed to Pornogra
phy) feels that Pornography is part of a sexist soci
ety and promotes dangerous gender stereotypes and
violence against women.
"In the continuum of pornography, Penthouse
and Play/girl/boy, as 'soft porn,' legitimate the exis
tence of more obviously objectionable material.
"We want to strike a balance between the civil
rights of women and customer choice by making this
product available but questioning its purpose.
"We hope that taking this action allows you to
make an educated choice and provokes constructive
discussion in the Stanford Community."
The flier would be signed by Tresidder Union and
STOP. It also has a space for comments.
Engleman contested several of STOP's accusa
tions. "For one thing, Playboy magazine has never
been found obscene in a court of law in the United
States," he said. "Pornography is a matter of
opinion. There's no legal definition."
He also disputed STOP's contention that pornog
raphy promotes violence against women. "To con
nect Playboy with crimes and violence against
women is simply unfounded," he said. "They're
putting out misinformation.
"Most of what I've read on the matter does not
support that. I pass that off as being as accurate as
teaching creationism in public schools."
Burt Joseph, Playboy's legal counsel, was un
available for comment, though Engleman said, "He
was not certain of the legality of this offhand. He
