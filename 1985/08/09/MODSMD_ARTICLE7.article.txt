## Bloodiest violence yet hits South Africa 
### 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa —
Riot and arson swept the townships around
Durban yesterday, and as at least 19 blacks
died in South Africa's bloodiest violence in
months, Indians fled fiery devastation in
their communities.
The government imposed night curfews
in the eastern Cape province, another
flashpoint, and threatened tougher action
to quell the year-long tide of violence
against white domination. At least 500
blacks have been killed.
In addition, Foreign Minister R.F. Botha
went to Vienna, Austria, for talks with
U.S. officials who want South Africa's
white rulers to talk with jailed black
leaders, not just crush dissent.
News reports said as many as 22 blacks
have been killed in the Durban rioting
since midday Wednesday. Hospitals con

firmed 19 violent deaths and said 16 were
riot victims. More than 250 people were
reported injured since Tuesday night.
Rioting persisted in the Durban
townships into last night. An official report
in the evening said police had killed two
more blacks since midday and that a black
woman was shot to death by a civilian
firing from a car that was being stoned.
The townships of the Indian Ocean port
city had been an area of calm in South
Africa's racial strife and were not among
the 36 localities put under a state of emer
gency. Riots began Tuesday in apparent
response to the murder last week of a
prominent black civil rights lawyer.
As many as 500 terrified families of eth
nic Indians fled their homes in Durban's
Inanda and Phoenix townships, parts of
which had been set afire by rioting blacks.

"They are going quite crazy, especially
in Inanda," a local reporter said. "Indian
families are rushing out carrying as many
possessions as they can."
A police source said the attacks on Indi
ans reflected 44 an age-old Indian-black
conflict. Leaders of the Natal Indian
Congress, which has long supported black
majority rule, blamed hooligan elements
taking advantage of political unrest.
Smoke rose from blazing shops, factories
and schools. It hung in a pall over Inanda.
Gangs of as many as 1,000 rock-throwing
youths rampaged through the giant black
townships of Umlazi and Kwa-Mashu,
stoning every vehicle in sight.
Police raced from riot to riot in armored
cars, spewing tear gas, birdshot and rubber
bullets into the crowds, but witnesses said
the mobs of young blacks surged on.

In Pretoria, the capital, President Pieter
Botha declared. "If necessary, we can intro
duce even stronger steps."
He said that, "if necessary," he would
extend the 19-day-old emergency to Dur
ban and the rest of Natal province. Most of
the areas in which the emergency was
imposed are near Johannesburg and in
Cape province.
The government imposed 10 p.m. to 4
a.m. curfews on black townships at four
towns and cities in the Cape, including Port
Elizabeth. The orders affected more than
400,000 blacks.
Last night's official statement brought to
14 the police count of dead since Tuesday,
and to seven the number of people police
acknowledge killing. It was not known
whether the higher hospital figures in
cluded fatalities confirmed by police.
