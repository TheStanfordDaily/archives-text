MANAGUA, Nicaragua —
An American peace group that
claimed 47 people had been
kidnapped by Nicaraguan
rebels said yesterday that they
had been freed after a day in
captivity.
The Revolutionary Demo
cratic Alliance, the rebel or
ganization accused by the
Washington-based Witness for
Peace group, has repeatedly
denied its forces abducted the
29 American peace activists and
18 local and foreign journalists.
There also has been no inde
pendent confirmation of the the
peace group's claim.
Witness for Peace spokes
woman Patricia Manning told
The Associated Press the group
arrived last night at El Castillo
after spending the day traveling
in a boat on the San Juan River,
which divides Nicaragua and
Costa Rica.
"The group arrived without
any accident and in a good
state," she said, adding she
could not learn more about the
situation because of poor radio
communications between the
group and the organization's
Managua office.
She said the group planned to
resume their trip early today to
San Carlos, a town on Lake
Nicaragua at the mouth of the
river.
On Wednesday, another Wit
ness spokeswoman, Sharon
Hostetler, said the activists had
radioed the group's Managua
office and said Nicaraguan
rebels were firing on their boat
from Costa Rica, and had or
dered them to disembark on the
Costa Rican side.
In Washington, the State De
partment said a spokesman for
the group in Nicaragua in
formed U.S. officials yesterday
they had been held by an inde
pendent anti-communist group
and not the Revolutionary
Democratic Alliance.
The group told a Costa Rican
civil guard officer they had been
stopped by 15 men who fired
guns in the air, but were "all
OK, need no medical treatment
and were well-treated," the de
partment said.
The "independent anti
communist group of
Nicaraguans" was not further
identified in a radio message
received from the freed
Americans by the Witness for
Peace office in Managua.
Earlier, Hostetler said the
group's arrival to El Castillo
had been delayed although she
did not say why.
But Radio Costa Rica quoted
the deputy director of the civil
guard, Lesmes Chaves, as
saying in the capital of San Jose
that the group's boat had
developed engine trouble.

Costa Rica has been monitoring
the group's progress from its
side of the river.
Earlier in the day, presiden
tial spokesman Armando
Varga.s said in San Jose that a
police helicopter pilot flying
over the area saw the boat
traveling in Nicaraguan waters.
He said it appeared at 12:15
p.m. PDT to be traveling peace
fully and without escort.
Vargas said the pilot spotted
the boat near Las Tiricias, a vil
lage near the mouth of the river.
He added that the president's
office had information that the
group never entered Costa
Rican territory.

Meanwhile, the Revolution
ary Democratic Alliance,
headed by Eden Pastora, issued
a statement denying any in
volvement in the alleged kid
napping.
"We categorically deny
detaining or much less kidnap
ping the members of the per
manent Christian Action for
Peace group since the area
where they were allegedly kid
napped is held by the commu
nist forces and the Revolution
ary Democratic Alliance has
never kidnapped anyone and
has returned 550 POWs to the
International Red Cross," it
said.
The statement, signed by
Eddy Sang, who commands
guerrillas in the 4th Military
Region; called the charges "a
propaganda show staged by the
Communists."
In Washington, State Depart
ment spokesman Bernard Kalb
said the Americans had been
cautioned for two years to avoid
travel in the Nicaraguan jungle.
"While the United States is not
responsible for the incident, it
will do what we can to assure
the group's safety," he said in a
statement made before there

ported release.
The Witness for Peace ac
tivists are in Nicaragua to
protest the Reagan Administra
tion's expressed support for the
rebels and to campaign for
peace between the United
States and Nicaragua, the
group's Washington office said.
Yesterday, President Reagan,
who has hailed the insurgents as
"freedom fighters," signed a
$25.4 billion foreign aid bill,
providing for a resumption of
nonlethal U.S. aid to the Con
tras.
The CIA supplied various
rebel groups with money and
weapons until last fall, when
Congress banned the provision
of weapons or training to the
rebels. Pastora has denied that
he received any U.S. aid, al
though CIA sources in Wash
ington say he did.
In the town of San Carlos,
local Sandinista authorities
gathered school children and
teachers on the docks, saying
they were to welcome the
American activist group. The
preparations began hours
before the group announced the
boat had been released.
Associated Press reporter
Filadelfo Aleman in San Carlos
said members of the Sandinista
Defense Committees — which
control the city block by block
— had told him the group was
expected yesterday, but they
refused to give details.
Pastora's Revolutionary
Democratic Alliance, known as
Contras, had warned Sunday
that the activists would be fired
on if they entered territory con
trolled by rebels.
Jose Davila, a spokesman for
the rebel group, said in a tele
phone interview from San Jose
that the alleged kidnapping was
"a show mounted by
Managua."
"We insist, the forces of
ARDE (the Spanish acronym
for the rebel group) have not
shot at nor have they detained
any person," he said.
ARDE, the second-biggest
Contra group, is made up prin
cipally of people who once
fought in the Sandinista revolu
tion, which toppled the late dic
tator Gen. Anastasio Somoza in
1979. Pastora broke with the
Sandinistas after they came to
power and adopted Marxist
policies.
Witness for Peace, which
describes itself as a "grass
roots" organization, opposes all
aid to the rebels and during the
past two years has brought
more than 1,500 people from
the United States to hold vigils
and prayer sessions in tense
areas of Nicaragua, according to
organizers, who say participants
fund their own trips.

MANAGUA, Nicaragua —
An American peace group that
claimed 47 people had been
kidnapped by Nicaraguan
rebels said yesterday that they
had been freed after a day in
captivity.
The Revolutionary Demo
cratic Alliance, the rebel or
ganization accused by the
Washington-based Witness for
Peace group, has repeatedly
denied its forces abducted the
29 American peace activists and
18 local and foreign journalists.
There also has been no inde
pendent confirmation of the the
peace group's claim.
Witness for Peace spokes
woman Patricia Manning told
The Associated Press the group
arrived last night at El Castillo
after spending the day traveling
in a boat on the San Juan River,
which divides Nicaragua and
Costa Rica.
"The group arrived without
any accident and in a good
state," she said, adding she
could not learn more about the
situation because of poor radio
communications between the
group and the organization's
Managua office.
She said the group planned to
resume their trip early today to
San Carlos, a town on Lake
Nicaragua at the mouth of the
river.
On Wednesday, another Wit
ness spokeswoman, Sharon
Hostetler, said the activists had
radioed the group's Managua
office and said Nicaraguan
rebels were firing on their boat
from Costa Rica, and had or
dered them to disembark on the
Costa Rican side.
In Washington, the State De
partment said a spokesman for
the group in Nicaragua in
formed U.S. officials yesterday
they had been held by an inde
pendent anti-communist group
and not the Revolutionary
Democratic Alliance.
The group told a Costa Rican
civil guard officer they had been
stopped by 15 men who fired
guns in the air, but were "all
OK, need no medical treatment
and were well-treated," the de
partment said.
The "independent anti
communist group of
Nicaraguans" was not further
identified in a radio message
received from the freed
Americans by the Witness for
Peace office in Managua.
Earlier, Hostetler said the
group's arrival to El Castillo
had been delayed although she
did not say why.
But Radio Costa Rica quoted
the deputy director of the civil
guard, Lesmes Chaves, as
saying in the capital of San Jose
that the group's boat had
developed engine trouble.

Costa Rica has been monitoring
the group's progress from its
side of the river.
Earlier in the day, presiden
tial spokesman Armando
Varga.s said in San Jose that a
police helicopter pilot flying
over the area saw the boat
traveling in Nicaraguan waters.
He said it appeared at 12:15
p.m. PDT to be traveling peace
fully and without escort.
Vargas said the pilot spotted
the boat near Las Tiricias, a vil
lage near the mouth of the river.
He added that the president's
office had information that the
group never entered Costa
Rican territory.

Meanwhile, the Revolution
ary Democratic Alliance,
headed by Eden Pastora, issued
a statement denying any in
volvement in the alleged kid
napping.
"We categorically deny
detaining or much less kidnap
ping the members of the per
manent Christian Action for
Peace group since the area
where they were allegedly kid
napped is held by the commu
nist forces and the Revolution
ary Democratic Alliance has
never kidnapped anyone and
has returned 550 POWs to the
International Red Cross," it
said.
The statement, signed by
Eddy Sang, who commands
guerrillas in the 4th Military
Region; called the charges "a
propaganda show staged by the
Communists."
In Washington, State Depart
ment spokesman Bernard Kalb
said the Americans had been
cautioned for two years to avoid
travel in the Nicaraguan jungle.
"While the United States is not
responsible for the incident, it
will do what we can to assure
the group's safety," he said in a
statement made before there

ported release.
The Witness for Peace ac
tivists are in Nicaragua to
protest the Reagan Administra
tion's expressed support for the
rebels and to campaign for
peace between the United
States and Nicaragua, the
group's Washington office said.
Yesterday, President Reagan,
who has hailed the insurgents as
"freedom fighters," signed a
$25.4 billion foreign aid bill,
providing for a resumption of
nonlethal U.S. aid to the Con
tras.
The CIA supplied various
rebel groups with money and
weapons until last fall, when
Congress banned the provision
of weapons or training to the
rebels. Pastora has denied that
he received any U.S. aid, al
though CIA sources in Wash
ington say he did.
In the town of San Carlos,
local Sandinista authorities
gathered school children and
teachers on the docks, saying
they were to welcome the
American activist group. The
preparations began hours
before the group announced the
boat had been released.
Associated Press reporter
Filadelfo Aleman in San Carlos
said members of the Sandinista
Defense Committees — which
control the city block by block
— had told him the group was
expected yesterday, but they
refused to give details.
Pastora's Revolutionary
Democratic Alliance, known as
Contras, had warned Sunday
that the activists would be fired
on if they entered territory con
trolled by rebels.
Jose Davila, a spokesman for
the rebel group, said in a tele
phone interview from San Jose
that the alleged kidnapping was
"a show mounted by
Managua."
"We insist, the forces of
ARDE (the Spanish acronym
for the rebel group) have not
shot at nor have they detained
any person," he said.
ARDE, the second-biggest
Contra group, is made up prin
cipally of people who once
fought in the Sandinista revolu
tion, which toppled the late dic
tator Gen. Anastasio Somoza in
1979. Pastora broke with the
Sandinistas after they came to
power and adopted Marxist
policies.
