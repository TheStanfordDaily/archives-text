# Reagan signs foreign aid bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President
Reagan signed a $25.4 billion
foreign aid bill yesterday, saying
he was "particularly pleased" it
provides for the resumption of
U.S. aid to the rebels in
Nicaragua.
But Reagan also criticized the
measure — the first such legisla
tion passed by Congress in four
years — as offering "substantial
reductions" in military assistance,
a development he termed
"disappointing."
The bill authorizes $12.7 bil
lion in foreign aid for each of the
next two years. It authorizes
foreign aid spending in scores of
developing nations around the
world, but awards the largest
amounts to Israel and Egypt.
Not since 1981 were both
houses of Congress able to agree
on foreign aid spending authority.
Attempts at passage always broke
up over policy disputes, forcing
the Reagan Administration to use
stop-gap financing measures for

foreign aid.
The bill Reagan signed into law
includes spending authority of $3
billion for Israel for each of the
two years, plus a one-time infu
sion of $1.5 billion in emergency
economic aid. Egypt will get $2.1
billion for each year plus $500
million in emergency economic
aid.
As approved by Congress late
last month, the measure froze
foreign aid spending at the levels
approved for fiscal 1985, which
ends Sept. 30. The administration
had asked for $13.2 billion for
each of the two years.
Over the two-year period, the
bill authorizes $27 million in non
lethal assistance to the Contra
guerrillas in Nicaragua, buxAtbais
both the CIA and the Defense
Department from administering
the aid.
The administration will have to
find another agency, probably the
State Department, to handle the
program.
