"MASTER
HAROLD and
the BOYS"
by Athol Fugard
Fugard weaves a tender,
humorous tale between Master
Harold, a 17 year old white boy
and two black boys, Sam and
Willie.
He delicately and subtly brings
to our attention the fact that
friendship is formed on character
independent of race, creed, or
color.
