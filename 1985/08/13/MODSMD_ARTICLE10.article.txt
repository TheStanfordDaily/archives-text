Marchers protest apartheid
WASHINGTON — Thousands of anti
apartheid demonstrators, led by mayors, actors
and union and civil rights leaders, marched to the
State Department yesterday and called on the
Reagan Administration to renounce its policy of
"constructive engagement" and impose sanctions
on South Africa.
The protesters carried 50 coffins symbolizing
South Africans killed in growing violence since
the white-minority government in Pretoria or
dered a state of emergency more than three
weeks ago.
Chanting "freedom yes, apartheid no," they
marched from the Lincoln Memorial to the State
Department, their line stretching about two
blocks down Constitution Avenue.
Among those leading the march were Mayors
Ed Koch of New York City, Marion Barry of
Washington, Ernest Morial of New Orleans and
Richard Hatcher of Gary, Ind.; the Rev. Jesse
Jackson; Coretta Scott King; NAACP Director
Benjamin Hooks; Walter Fauntroy, the District
of Columbia's congressional delegate; actors Paul
Newman and Tony Randall and singer Harry
Belafonte.
The leaders of the Free South Africa Move
ment, beginning a day of mourning and demon
stration, also urged U.S. corporations to halt all
business dealings with South Africa.
Jackson, who sought the Democratic presiden
tial nomination last year, said, "There is a large
moral force in the community coming together.

Every moral imperative used to withdraw the
Third Reich from Germany in 1945 should be
used to justify withdrawl of the Fourth Reich
from South Africa in 1985."
Gas leak alarm came late
INSTITUTE, W.Va. — Union Carbide
defended itself yesterday against criticism of its
emergency notification procedures during a
poison gas leak that injured 135 people. But
company officials conceded that workers at first
thought the leak was not a problem and delayed
notifying authorities.
The chemical involved in Sunday's leak, al
dicarb oxime, is rated on a toxicity scale in the
same class as methyl isocyanate, which killed
more than 2,000 people after it leaked at a
Carbide plant in Bhopal, India, according to a
company memo disclosed by an aide to Rep.
Henry Waxman (D-Calif.).
"The system didn't work," said Charleston
Mayor Mike Roark, who joined mayors from St.
Albans, Nitro, Dunbar and other communities in
criticizing the warning procedures.
But Carbide officials disputed the charges, with
plant manager Hank Karawan saying the plant's
alarm was activated within 60 seconds of the
leak's being discovered at 9:24 a.m. (6:24 a.m.
PDT). Kanawha County emergency officials
were not notified for 20 minutes — until 9:44
a.m.
But Emergency Broadcast System's first report
wasn't broadcast until 10:09,
