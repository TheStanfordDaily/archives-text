Three area beaches closed
SAN GREGORIO — The Coast Guard closed
three state beaches yesterday as it investigated
eight barrels that washed ashore, including one
cracked and leaking 55-gallon drum marked
"hazardous."
"We don't know if there are any others out
there," Petty Officer Kathleen Porter said.
The leaking barrel, which also was marked
"methyl alcohol," was taken with the others to an
environmental laboratory in Richmond, Petty
Officer Paul Powers said.

Pescadero, San Gregorio and Pomponio state
beaches in San Mateo County were closed as a
precaution. The eighth barrel washed up on
Ocean Beach in San Francisco, but that beach
remained open.
The Coast Guard's Marine Safety unit and the
California Department of Forestry were called to
pick up the drums and take them away for analy
sis.
Two of the drums washed up on Sunday and
five more came in yesterday, Porter said.
She said no ships alerted the Coast Guard that
they were missing any drums.
