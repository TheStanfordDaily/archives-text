## The 						Stanford Daily Enter the IRS 
### 
This spring, a local newspaper reporter wrote a story
about a Stanford student who purchased a BMW with his
financial aid money. The student later admitted he had
lied, and the newspaper retracted its story, but that a
reporter could calmly record and publish the tale illustrates
the poor public image of federal financial aid.
To some, white punks on loans are nearly as evil as those
on dope.
An announcement last week by the Department of Edu
cation may help improve the image. The department is ask
ing the Internal Revenue Service to withhold tax refunds
for the 1 million defaulters on Guaranteed Student Loans
and National Direct Student Loans, Education Secretary
William Bennett said.
The bad image is not necessarily deserved, but it would
be to the benefit of those who are or will be in college for
the image to be polished.
Student borrowers are not significantly worse at repaying
their loans than people who take out personal loans. Ac
cording to a spokesman for the Department of Education,
about 6 percent of the $50 billion loaned out in the GSL
program has been in default at one time or another. The
loan officer at a San Francisco firm specializing in personal
loans estimates the default rate on personal loans in gen
eral to be 4.5 to 5 percent.
More importantly, people will believe that the student
aid program is being "cleaned up," and this could signifi
cantly help the political image of federal financial aid. That
could be a crucial factor helping guarantee the future
availability of federal aid at a time when everyone in Wash
ington is looking for places to slice the budget.
The IRS action will not have a major impact on Stanford,
whose graduates are among the nation's best at repaying
their student loans, and it is not an unfair or unjust action
to take against the delinquent borrowers from any school.
But this action could significantly help the political image
of federal financial aid.
This may be among the least painful ways to.win contin
ued support for federal student aid.
