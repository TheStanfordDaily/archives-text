Move yourself to go again
Write a headline, get it thrown out
Three-syllable word, what's it about?
Write another, have it rejected
Legal department, someone objected
Peering eyes proof this edition
Mortal fear of litigation
Action needed is affirmative
We don't need another conservative
What's a reader supposed to do?
Go out and buy the Stanford Review!
xxxxx
You louts! (What!?)
(Never mind, go back to the tube)
What do we have for entertainment?
A couple sheep in wolves' raiments
What is the next editorial's tack, .
"Life is good" or "War is bad"?
Better still, pick the easy option
" ASSU meetings should be open"
Forget the news, forget issues
Write another edit, soft-pedal the views
Mercenary writing at its best
— Credibility is put to the test
Doesn't matter what the writer said
Just as long as he gets paid
xxxxx

So get back to work, stuff sedition
This paper's under heavy sedation
Can't move articles to logical positions
— need a gun or divine ordination
White space here, white space there
But the stylebook is followed, what do they care?
Boredom here, boredom there
Just do the crossword, what do they care?
"Responsibility . . . we're pre-professional"
The sewer is open to the confessional
Caption: "Shit hits the fan"
("Clean it up, willy a? . . . ALL RIGHT,
CHUCK!")
Consistency has been stressed
As a virtue of the local press
Hobgoblin of little minds
At least it gives 'em something to . . . minnnnnd
xxxxx

"You're a pica off on that caption!
Any requests before your execution?"
"Stop making heads alliterative,
Just goes to waste on the illiterate"
You're readin', we're writin'
But did you notice you're not smilin'?
You're readin', we're writin'
Then you're busy circular-filin'
Square pegs in round holes
In these pages, there ain't none of those
They say it's "quality," and "responsible"; well,
Is it quality or is it only . . . dull?

(Tracy Furutani (chem grad-turkey) is trying to get
taped onto Charles Cuny's door, the unequivocable
sign of columnar success. And excess, too. This sorry
attempt at satire might just be his last column.
Check back next week.)
