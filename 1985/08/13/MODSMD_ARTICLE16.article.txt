Dean inaccurate
on Coffee House
As a student concerned with
the Coffee House I would like to
respond to some of the state
ments made by Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons on K.ZSU
and reported in the Aug. 6 Daily.
1. Lyons complains that the
Coffee House has not paid its
fair share of Tresidder's over
head. This is not true. The Cof
fee House pays rent to Tresidder
as negotiated in 1980. This rent
is 12.5 percent of the Coffee
House's net earnings and has
totaled well over $400,000 to
date. For comparison, this rent
figure is substantially above what
Servomation pays to Tresidder.
If these are not sufficient funds
to cover overhead costs, it is no
one's fault but Tresidder's. They
accepted the bid. And if Lyons
responds that the Coffee House
is not netting enough cash, let me
be the first to remind him that
the Coffee House's sales con
tinue to be double what they
were before the ASSU took over
the Coffee House in 1980.
2. Lyons complains that the
Coffee House has run a deficit.
This is not true. The Coffee
House has proved to be a very
profitable operation. In 1980 the
ASSU allocated about $30,000
to establish the Coffee House.
The Coffee House has returned
to the ASSU over $15,000 in
interest payments on that money.
Had it continued operations, the
principal would most likely have
been paid off within the next 18
months. Then, unlike other stu
dent organizations, the Coffee
House would provide the ASSU
with capital to the tune of
$10,000 to $20,000 each year.
3. Lyons says the Coffee
House has not paid its rent in the
last few months. This is true.

What he does not say is that he
knows damn well that the Coffee
House fully intends to and is
fully capable of paying that rent.
Because he closed the student
Coffee House down, it has been
forced to delay rent payments
until vendor bills are paid. The
Coffee House could not continue
operations if vendors demanded
COD. So, in order to fulfill its
contractual obligations, the Cof
fee House has been forced to
delay rent payment until its final
books are tallied.
4. Lyons wonders "How long
can the ASSU underwrite these
deficits?" First, the ASSU, as I
have stated, is not underwriting
any Coffee House deficits.
Second, even if it were, what has
Lyons got to do with it? Lyons
has some gall to admit Tresidder
feels it is its business to tell the
ASSU how to run a business.
5. Lyons seems to have mis
heard me. He heard me say that
"We need [The Coffee House's]
kind of social organization for
the several dozen students who
have benefitted from that down
there." I did not say several
dozen. I said several thousand.
Last spring over 2,500 students,
faculty and staff pledged their
support for continued ownership
of the Coffee House.
6. Finally, Lyons seems ter
ribly impressed by Saga's history
of student involvement at their
other campus operations. I ap
preciate his concern. But let the
point be clear: To Lyons, student
involvement means everything
but allowing students to make
the final decisions.
Lyons said that discontent is
healthy on a university campus.
That is good. For many of us are
discontent. And we are healthy.
