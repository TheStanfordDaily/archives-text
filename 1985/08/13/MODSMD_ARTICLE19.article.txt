## You'd be fortunate to see UB4O 
### JENNIFER KOCH Editorial staff 
Some things are better left to
the imagination. ÜB4O in concert
may be one of those things.
Not to say the band didn't play
some excellent music last Satur
day at Berkeley's Greek Theatre.
It's just that they seemed
strangely out of place. With
bright streams of light flashing
across the modern stage and the
music blaring, the scene violated
expectations somehow. I had im
agined this mellow, upbeat reggae
band would offer a slice of the
Jamaican lifestyle as well as a
taste of the music, and in that
respect it was disappointing —
the performance seemed no dif
ferent from that of a popular rock
band.
ÜB4O opened with "If It Hap
pens Again," one of their more
recent hits, and followed this with
"Keep On Moving," a Bob Mar
ley tune. "Labour of Love" fans
would have appreciated this con
cert — the band played every
thing on the first side of the al
bum and a few tracks from the
second, including an incredibly
rousing version of the classic
"Red Red Wine."
On some of the songs the band
sounded a bit uninspired, lacking

a little of that vitality which is so
unmistakable in their recordings.
Obvious exceptions to this
slightly lackluster attitude were
"Cherry Oh Baby" and "Johnny
Too Bad," both of which evoked
a wave of wild dancing through
out the crowd.
Ten men were crowded onto
the stage, several taking turns
with the vocal responsibilities.
The lyrics were largely unintel
ligible, but a strong, pulsing beat
more than made up for this. The
audience appeared engrossed,
swaying rhythmically and hyp
notically to the music.
The band members addressed
their fans only occasionally, with
accents so thick it was almost as if
they were speaking another lang
uage. They did announce the
release of their new album in
England and America and
played a few songs from it. The
new material wasn't greeted with
an overly enthusiastic reception,
but "Don't Break My Heart" did
generate some healthy applause.
In fact, ÜB4O seemed to know
just what to do to win the audi
ence over — comments like "This
is our first time in Berkeley, but
we guarantee it won't be our
last," and"The grass really is

greener in America" sent up wails
from every point in the theater.
The lyrics to "Sweet Sensation"
were almost drowned out by cries
from girls in the front row, the
recipients of U840 , s warm
dedication.

The entire set lasted only an
hour, but the band was back for
an encore which included a ver
sion of "Please Don't Make Me
Cry" which seemed far superior
to the recording. ÜB4o's biggest
flaw may have have been its at

tempt to perform the remake of
Sonny and Cher's tune "I Got
You Babe," which they recorded
with Chrissie Hynde, without her
assistance — the result was dan
ceble, but did not do justice to the
song or their talent.
Yet, any imperfections in
ÜB4o's performance paled in
comparison to the mistake that
was Midnight Oil.
All seven feet of bald lead
singer Peter Garrett was writhing
on the stage, his spastic arm
movements and straight legs sug
gesting a cross between a David
Byrne clone and a traffic cop
gone crazy. This five-member
Australian band had its moment
during "The Power and the Pas
sion," but after their over
amplified version of a song called
"I Don't Want to Be the One," I
was convinced that I don't want
to be the one to ever hear that
again.
Although the outdoor theater
was freezing — the performance
would have been better appreci
ated if it had been in Jamaica —
and despite the fact that the
band's appearance was somewhat
of an insult to my preconceived
notion, the evening with ÜB4O
was most definitely a "sweet sen
sation."
