# Stanford costs top $16K; eighth highest in country
## 
### PHIL SANDERS 
College costs around the country will increase an
average of 7 percent in 1985-86, the College Board
reported Sunday.
This hike is almost double the 3.6 percent infla
tion rate in 1984 as measured by the Consumer
Price Index.
Stanford's tuition increase of 8 percent is slightly
more than the national average, but Stanford has
dropped to eighth on the list of the nation s 10 most
expensive schools, after having topped the list in
1982.
Vice Provost Raymond Bacchetti explained that
costs increase faster than inflation "because our
costs rise faster than the rate of inflation."
Bacchetti said that two-thirds of the University's
costs are for wages and salaries, which generally rise
2 to 3 percentage points faster than the CPI. He said
that Stanford tries to keep tuition costs equal to the
rise in salaries, adding, "We've been close to that
over the long run, so we're not talking about an in
creasing percentage of disposable income."
Bacchetti also stressed that financial aid tradition
ally helps the 60 percent of student families that
cannot pay the full load of Stanford's costs and that
the University is still committed to need-blind ad
missions, where students are admitted without
regard to their ability to pay.
Currently most expensive, according to the Col
lege Board, is Bennington College, a small liberal
arts college in Vermont.

The price of public education is increasing at
about the same rate as private education, but is still
a comparative bargain. For example, the total cost
for a year at UC-Berkeley is estimated to be $7,344,
less than half the cost of a year at any of the private
schools on the 10-most-expensive list.
College officials claim the rapid rate of increase in
college costs is to make up for ground lost in the
70s, when double-digit inflation eroded professors'
salaries and forced schools to postpone building
maintenance and repairs. Also, in order to compete
for top educators colleges often get into bidding
wars. Tuition increases help schools maintain their
drawing power.
Bacchetti called this the "2 percent factor,"
meaning that these costs push the University's rise
in total expenses 2 percentage points over the rise in
salaries. "We use fundraisers and other means to
not pass those expenses on through tuition," he
said, noting that the University has cut its budget in
14 of the past 17 years to keep those costs down.
The total cost — tuition, fees, books, supplies,
room, board, personal expenses and transportation
— of attending the 10 most expensive private col
leges:
1. Bennington College $17,210
