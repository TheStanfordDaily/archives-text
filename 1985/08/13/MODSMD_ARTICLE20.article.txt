# Selling out: The Tubes go commercial
## 
### MARSH McCALL Editorial staff 
The Tubes are digging their
own grave. Their last two albums,
"Love Bomb" and "In
side/Outside,'" contain the
kind of plastic, cliched funk music
that the angry, artsy young Tubes
of 10 years ago would have poked
fun at.
It began well enough. As the
seven-man ensemble walked on
stage Saturday night at the Santa
Clara County Fair and opened
with classic tunes such as "Turn
Me On" and "Sports Fans," 1
recalled exactly why it was I had
seen The Tubes several times in
the past four years: These guys
are fun.
Lead singer Fee Waybill
cavorted in his usual outrageous
costumes (most notably the char
acter of the parody
of the stereotyped acid-rock su
perstar), guitarists Bill Spooner
and Roger Steen traded carefully
crafted guitar licks, and the band
looked fresh and enthusiastic as
they pranced around, wearing

matching white robes on which
were painted enormous eyes.
After three songs Waybill an

nounced the score of the 49ers
game, and everyone cheered. So
far so good.

Unfortunately, it became time
to play the new material. It has
become trite to consider bands by
referring to how great their "old
stuff' was. "Man — those guys
used to be great, but they've sold
out." Unfortunately, the maxim
has proven true again. The title
cut from The Tubes new record,
"Love Bomb," is miserable;
"Night People," another new
song, which the band decided to
stretch to 20 minutes, is even
worse. The masses grew restless
as the new songs wore on, coming
back to life only for "White
Punks on Dope" (always a clas
sic), "She's a Beauty" (a pretty
plastic song also, but with a damn
good melody) and "Talk to Ya
Later," a song from what may be
The Tubes' greatest album,
"Completion Backwards Princi
ple."
In a BAM magazine interview
last year, Waybill said that The
Tubes were tired of being in debt.
The solution, he said, was to
postpone the art-rock creativity
and record some commercially

viable music. "Inside/Outside"
was the result, a generally bad al
bum which sold well but con
tained no element of the satiric
humor and musical excess that
made The Tubes the most inter
esting and entertaining band in
the Bay Area. And "Love Bomb"
is another misstep.
The band's musicianship Satur
day night, as usual, was excellent
— The Tubes are not great
musicians but they work together,
all seven of them, in an easy and
mature fashion, creating a very
full and exciting sound. But con
sidering most of the material they
were working with, that was as far
as it went. I hope the band's the
ory about commercial music
works out, but from the crowd
response at the Santa Clara Fair, I
gotta say it doesn't look good.
And as the evening wore on, I
was hoping that The Tubes would
afford a bit of irony by playing my
favorite Tubes song: "What do
you want from life ... To try and
be happy, while you do the nasty
things you must. .
