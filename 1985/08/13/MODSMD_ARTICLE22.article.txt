# Zasu's show is anything but the Pitts
## 
### TONY JAMES 
Let's set the record straight
about the Zasu Pitts Memorial
Orchestra. They are a cover band,
pure and simple. However, they
are a great cover band in tech
nique, execution, style and song
selection.
The band was named after a
silent movie star and is a self
proclaimed Motown revue. The
group has been playing the Bay
Area club circuit heavily for the
past year or so, hoping to break
their debut EP and soon-to-be
released album. The "Pitts" have
become quite popular among
Stanford students; there is a
devoted local following in the
front of just about every show.
This review is dedicated to these
demi-groupies.
Last Friday, "Zasu," as they
are known to intimates, played at
a small club called Ashkenaz on
San Pablo in Berkeley. This is a
great club in which to see a show,
cozy and intimate. The place
probably holds 250 people maxi
mum, maybe less, but it never
really seems packed. Subdued
lighting from Japanese paper lan
terns, peaked wooden ceilings
and tons of politically aware
posters and leaflets on the walls
make the club hip and cool.
The place exudes the air of
radicalism — the names Vietnam,
Fela, Bobby Sands, El Salvador,

Contras, Somoza, etc., grab the
attention when one surveys the
walls. The atmosphere is friendly,
much like one's neighborhood
pub.
By the time our party arrived,
there were no seats available, so
we progressed to the dance floor.
This turned out to be opportune,
for the opening act began their set
moments later.
They were a Berkeley band
aptly named Surprise; they got
the audience up and moving
about with their excellent mix of
down home soul, rhythm and
blues, fairly straight 12-bar blues
and beer-bar boogie. They had
the confidence and assurance of
headliners and marched through
an enjoyable set of covers of Wil
son Pickett, Sam Cooke and A 1
Green.
This five-piece outfit (guitar,
bass, drums, organ and sax)
jammed hard and really won the
crowd. Highlights of their set in
cluded "634-5789," "In The
Midnight Hour," "Love and
Happiness," Paul Simon's "Late
in the Evening" and a song Zasu
also covered. They are the perfect
opener for Zasu.
This left nothing save the wait
for the main attraction, and the
masses were not disappointed.
From the minute they took the
stage until the end of their two

set, 30+ song, two-and-one-half
hour workout, the party never
stopped. Zasu-mania was in full
swing.
Everyone has heard of
Motown, so the audience was as
varied as only a Berkeley crowd
can be; the youthful trendies
mixed with the straight college
kids, the aging hippies and
folkies, rising yuppies, street
people and just plain folks — all
were up and dancing.
The leader of Zasu, bassist
Stephen Ashman, although
playing with a broken wrist,
opened the show with a propell
ing version of Sly Stone's "Dance
To The Music." The mix was the
best of all the times I've seen
Zasu; their sonic sound attack
rivaled that of Go-Go. They are
the best live endorsement of Phil
Spector's Wall of Sound.
The band seemed to be in a
loose playful mood, so this show
was a particular treat for their au
dience. They hit some great highs
in both sets. "Knock on Wood"
was a bit uneven, but Kathy Ken
nedy was more than vindicated on
a dynamite version of James
Brown's "Cold Sweat." Maurice
Tami (guitar and vocals)
delivered on both "Respect
Yourself" and the set closing
"Gimme Some Lovin," which
was shortened when Ashman hit
his wrist after leaping off a bank

of speakers.
The first set was well-paced,
mixing the lighter more pop num
bers (i.e., straight Motown) with
the raunchier jamming soulful
stomps. The band was very com
fortable with the audience, even
throwing a tribute to "the Stan
ford dancers'* after a well
choreographed "Expressway."
The intermission provided a
needed chance to rest, cool off
and reflect. Zasu has been enter
taining Bay Area fans for at least
the past two years. The current
lineup includes a four-piece horn
section (trumpet, trombone and
two sax men), bass, guitar, two
keyboardists, a percussionist,
drums, glockenspiel, four female
vocalists and on occasion back up
dancers ("The Fabulous Sluts Au
Go-Go").
There are actually eight
vocalists, but the women carry the
bulk of the singing weight. The
entire band is a visual treat, bop
ping around the stage to
choreographed routines; it's a
mobile party.
The second set was even better
than the first. Keta Bill took the
lead on Aretha's "Rock Steady"
and turned in an impassioned
performance. The dynamic
"Shotgun" followed with Annette
handling the vocals; by now the
crowd was crazed. Things
became even more interesting

with an impromptu "Happy
Birthday" and the only ballad of
the evening, the title song from
"Goldfinger," impressively cov
ered by Katie Guthorn.
Maurice Tami came back for
The Young Rascals' "A Girl Like
You." Kathy Kennedy led the
band through a serious strut with
"Baby Workout," Keta cut
loose with an incendiary "Can't
Turn You Loose." Other high
lights were Guthorn on "Ain't
That Peculiar," Ashman with
Sly's beautiful "Everyday
People," and the Supremes'
"Love is Like an Itchin' in My
Heart."
On "Stand!" Ashman strolled
through the crowd via a chordless
bass. The closers of the set
"Heatwave" and "You Can't Sit
Down" were the definite anthems
for that hot, sweaty Friday in
Berkeley.
The three-song encore
delivered equally as well.
Opening with "Come See About
Me," they moved through "He's
A Rebel" and (of course)
"Shout." By the time Zasu left
the stage, the audience was ex
hausted but satisfied. Catch Zasu
at the New Varsity, if you love
Motown or dancing — your feet
will be happy. Just put on your
dancing shoes and don't forget
the rule of the night — "You
Can't Sit Down!"

with an impromptu "Happy
Birthday" and the only ballad of
the evening, the title song from
"Goldfinger," impressively cov
ered by Katie Guthorn.
Maurice Tami came back for
The Young Rascals' "A Girl Like
You." Kathy Kennedy led the
band through a serious strut with
"Baby Workout," Keta cut
loose with an incendiary "Can't
Turn You Loose." Other high
lights were Guthorn on "Ain't
That Peculiar," Ashman with
Sly's beautiful "Everyday
People," and the Supremes'
"Love is Like an Itchin' in My
Heart."
On "Stand!" Ashman strolled
through the crowd via a chordless
bass. The closers of the set
"Heatwave" and "You Can't Sit
Down" were the definite anthems
for that hot, sweaty Friday in
Berkeley.
The three-song encore
delivered equally as well.
Opening with "Come See About
Me," they moved through "He's
A Rebel" and (of course)
"Shout." By the time Zasu left
the stage, the audience was ex
hausted but satisfied. Catch Zasu
at the New Varsity, if you love
Motown or dancing — your feet
will be happy. Just put on your
dancing shoes and don't forget
the rule of the night — "You
Can't Sit Down!"
Let's set the record straight
about the Zasu Pitts Memorial
Orchestra. They are a cover band,
pure and simple. However, they
are a great cover band in tech
nique, execution, style and song
selection.
The band was named after a
silent movie star and is a self
proclaimed Motown revue. The
group has been playing the Bay
Area club circuit heavily for the
past year or so, hoping to break
their debut EP and soon-to-be
released album. The "Pitts" have
become quite popular among
Stanford students; there is a
devoted local following in the
front of just about every show.
This review is dedicated to these
demi-groupies.
Last Friday, "Zasu," as they
are known to intimates, played at
a small club called Ashkenaz on
San Pablo in Berkeley. This is a
great club in which to see a show,
cozy and intimate. The place
probably holds 250 people maxi
mum, maybe less, but it never
really seems packed. Subdued
lighting from Japanese paper lan
terns, peaked wooden ceilings
and tons of politically aware
posters and leaflets on the walls
make the club hip and cool.
The place exudes the air of
radicalism — the names Vietnam,
Fela, Bobby Sands, El Salvador,

Contras, Somoza, etc., grab the
attention when one surveys the
walls. The atmosphere is friendly,
much like one's neighborhood
pub.
By the time our party arrived,
there were no seats available, so
we progressed to the dance floor.
This turned out to be opportune,
for the opening act began their set
moments later.
They were a Berkeley band
aptly named Surprise; they got
the audience up and moving
about with their excellent mix of
down home soul, rhythm and
blues, fairly straight 12-bar blues
and beer-bar boogie. They had
the confidence and assurance of
headliners and marched through
an enjoyable set of covers of Wil
son Pickett, Sam Cooke and A 1
Green.
This five-piece outfit (guitar,
bass, drums, organ and sax)
jammed hard and really won the
crowd. Highlights of their set in
cluded "634-5789," "In The
Midnight Hour," "Love and
Happiness," Paul Simon's "Late
in the Evening" and a song Zasu
also covered. They are the perfect
opener for Zasu.
This left nothing save the wait
for the main attraction, and the
masses were not disappointed.
From the minute they took the
stage until the end of their two

set, 30+ song, two-and-one-half
hour workout, the party never
stopped. Zasu-mania was in full
swing.
Everyone has heard of
Motown, so the audience was as
varied as only a Berkeley crowd
can be; the youthful trendies
mixed with the straight college
kids, the aging hippies and
folkies, rising yuppies, street
people and just plain folks — all
were up and dancing.
The leader of Zasu, bassist
Stephen Ashman, although
playing with a broken wrist,
opened the show with a propell
ing version of Sly Stone's "Dance
To The Music." The mix was the
best of all the times I've seen
Zasu; their sonic sound attack
rivaled that of Go-Go. They are
the best live endorsement of Phil
Spector's Wall of Sound.
The band seemed to be in a
loose playful mood, so this show
was a particular treat for their au
dience. They hit some great highs
in both sets. "Knock on Wood"
was a bit uneven, but Kathy Ken
nedy was more than vindicated on
a dynamite version of James
Brown's "Cold Sweat." Maurice
Tami (guitar and vocals)
delivered on both "Respect
Yourself" and the set closing
"Gimme Some Lovin," which
was shortened when Ashman hit
his wrist after leaping off a bank

of speakers.
The first set was well-paced,
mixing the lighter more pop num
bers (i.e., straight Motown) with
the raunchier jamming soulful
stomps. The band was very com
fortable with the audience, even
throwing a tribute to "the Stan
ford dancers'* after a well
choreographed "Expressway."
The intermission provided a
needed chance to rest, cool off
and reflect. Zasu has been enter
taining Bay Area fans for at least
the past two years. The current
lineup includes a four-piece horn
section (trumpet, trombone and
two sax men), bass, guitar, two
keyboardists, a percussionist,
drums, glockenspiel, four female
vocalists and on occasion back up
dancers ("The Fabulous Sluts Au
Go-Go").
There are actually eight
vocalists, but the women carry the
bulk of the singing weight. The
entire band is a visual treat, bop
ping around the stage to
choreographed routines; it's a
mobile party.
The second set was even better
than the first. Keta Bill took the
lead on Aretha's "Rock Steady"
and turned in an impassioned
performance. The dynamic
"Shotgun" followed with Annette
handling the vocals; by now the
crowd was crazed. Things
became even more interesting

with an impromptu "Happy
Birthday" and the only ballad of
the evening, the title song from
"Goldfinger," impressively cov
ered by Katie Guthorn.
