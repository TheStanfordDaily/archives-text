# Adams sings straight from the heart

He returned to the stage again.
And again. A third and final
encore appearance brought an
end to his two-hour concert. It
also brought an end to an evening
that nobody in the sold out Con
cord Pavilion would soon forget.
After only five years of serious
performing, Bryan Adams has es
tablished himself as a premiere
entertainer. Although he's only
24 years old, Adams is one of the
best at garnering a fantastic rap
port with his fans and giving them
exactly what they want to hear.
He hasn't forgotten that he owes
his present popularity and subse
quent success to the people who
love his music, and Adams had a
great time playing to his crowd.
It's fun to watch someone enjoy
ing himself — watching Bryan
Adams perform, it is easy to see
that he loves to play his music.
Adams and his band have no
extravagant outfits or elaborately
choreographed stage show.

Adams' wholesome, "boy next
door looks and outgoing,
amiable personality fit perfectly
into his music. His brash confi
dence and love of rock 'n' roll
music quickly drew the crowd
into his performance in such a
way that the 12,000 fans all
became members of his band. On
this night, Bryan Adams could do
no wrong.
He took the stage, unan
nounced, and before a word was
spoken or a note was played, one
had a feeling this was going to be
a great concert. When Adams
yelled "Hello Concord" and
broke into "Kids Wanna Rock"
you knew this was going to be
special. "Everywhere I go, kids
wanna rock"; Adams sang this fa
vorite with a passion that set the
tone for the rest of the show. The
kids, and believe me, there were a
lot of them, were standing from
the bottom of the pavilion's
reserved seats to the top of its
grassy bank for the next two

hours. Standing and swaying,
singing and dancing — it was
quite a sight.
Granted, this wasn't a reunion
of the Beatles or Elvis rein
carnated, but Bryan Adams has
everything musical idols are made
of. His happy-go-lucky onstage
personality is so sincere that one
has a feeling he is the same off
stage. He wasn't offstage much,
to the delight of his fans.
Adams didn't spend all of his
two-hour concert showing
everybody what a marvelous per
sonality he has. He played the
better part of 20 songs, each and
every one a favorite with the au
dience. His opener "Remember,"
had many fans trying to remem
ber his first album. Not many
could. Once he was finished with
that tune, the real concert began.
It could only get better.
Adams has released four al
bums, but he found his niche in the
music industry with his last two,
"Cuts Like a Knife" and the cur
rent top seller, "Reckless." Be
cause of this, he played 16 songs
from those two releases. He
didn't clutter up his performance
with oldies (from way back in
1980) that few had ever heard.
This was a definite plus, as it en
abled the crowd to sing along and
allowed everybody the opportu
nity to become comfortable with
his choices.
Those choices included early
hits, including an inspired version
of "This Time," "Straight From
the Heart," "I'm Ready" and one
of the audience's favorites, "Cuts
Like a Knife." It appeared and
sounded as if "Cuts Like a Knife"
was performed with less vigor
than everything else. Perhaps
high anticipation and a screaming
crowd clouded my reaction to the

song that was Adams' first true
hit.
The rest of the concert was as
close to flawless as a performer
could get; every song and in
strumental was as excellent as the
last. The quality of the sound and
employment of the lighting sys
tem went without a hitch. Not
only does Adams have talent, it is
clear that he demands perfection
with all aspects of his show.
Adams also showed his superb
concentration by continuing to
sing while avoiding numerous
stage jumpers who weren't happy
with their seats in the first row.
He even managed to impart some
humor during these interruptions
by telling a guard who was busy
tackling a trespasser to "take it
easy."
Songs from "Reckless" filled

the rest of the evening's agenda.
Hits including "Run To You,"
"Somebody" and "Heaven" were
greeted with an approval that
could be heard across the bay in
San Francisco.
Adams ended his first set tel
ling his audience, "You're the best
crowd we've played for in a long
time" and ran off the stage end
ing his first set without playing his
current hit, "Summer of '69."
The audience quickly adopted the
chant "sixty-nine, sixty-nine,"
and after a few minutes, Adams
returned to acknowledge the
crowd's rythmic roar.
At this point it seemed appar
ent that Bryan Adams is destined
to fulfill the prophecy of one of
his own song titles — "The Best
Is Yet To Come."
