Fortunate Son: The Best of Dave
Mirsh

Random House, 337 pp., $9.95
An annoying strategy used too
often by rock critics: They start
off by proudly asserting their
bona fide working-class status.
Look at me, they say, I'm from
the streets! Rock music is made
for me by people like me — so
watch out! Dave Marsh's book
opens: "When I was a boy, my
family lived on East Beverly
Street in Pontiac, Michigan, in a
two-bedroom house with blue
white asphalt shingles that
cracked at the edges when a ball
was thrown against them and left
a powder like talc on fingers
rubbed across their shallow
grooves. East Beverly ascended a
slowly rising hill. At the very top,
a block and a half from our place,
Pontiac Motors Assembly Line
16 sprawled for a mile or so be
hind a fenced-in parking lot."
What does this mean? I guess
that to Dave Marsh, who is easily
rock music's most distinguished
and prolific critic, it means that
from out of the wastelands
created by capitalism and indus
try there has come an authentic,
democratic art that is by its very
nature an art of protest — a line
that is hard to argue with. But I
think that trumpeting one's
tough, earthy and natural roots
succeeds in conveying something
more insidious, something cheap
and romanticizing. For if rock
truly is a popular music, where all
you need is a radio and an instru
ment to participate in it, then this
mythicizing of the urban poor,
claiming that they are the natural
recipients of things like "drive"
and "feel," is elitist. So you end
up getting into odd arguments
with these people: I was poorer

than you were, or blacker, or
gayer, certainly more economi
cally marginal than you were.
You become rock-and-roll Jacobs
conniving for Isaac's working
class birthright, all for the pur
pose of guaranteeing for one's
writing an unstamp-outable cor
rectness in the eyes of your peers
or readers. (Needless to say, it
would contradict this view for me
to tell you how gritty and
frightening my youth was, or how
unimpeachable it has since made
my ideas about Katrina and the
Waves.)
This said, I should also say that

Marsh's working-class flag
waving doesn't mess up his essays
too much. He does say that the
Beach Boys' suburban upbringing
made it impossible for them not
to self-destruct. (The thoroughly
middle-class backgrounds of Bob
Dylan, Mick Jagger and Phil
Spector go unexamined.) And he
overpraises John Cafferty and the
Beaver Brown Band for their al
leged Springsteenesque identifi
cation with the disaster that is
New Jersey. (Cafferty's recent
hit, "It's Tough All Over," is a
model of cliche and condescen
sion.)

Otherwise, Marsh can spot bull
shit a mile away. He doesn't feel
beholden to old idols, his own or
those of other critics. So Lou
Reed, Elvis Costello, Rod
Stewart, The Band, The Doors,
even Pete Townshend, are un
compromisingly assessed in the
light of their original promise and
vision. So are Elvis Presley,
Motown's Berry Gordy and Sly
Stone. The essays in this collec
tion thus have a kind of sad,
echoic character.
On the other hand, Marsh
rightly praises Lynard Skynard
("as good a band as America
produced after Woodstock whose
redneck allegiances have kept
them from being taken as
seriously as many more half
baked but superficially serious
competitors") and James Jamer
son, the unknown bass player for
Motown who "deserves as much
credit as any instrumentalist for
changing the way rock sounds."
After Lester Bangs, Dave
Marsh, who has written books on
Bruce Springsteen, The Who, and
edited "The Book of Rock Lists"
and"The Rolling Stone Record
Guide," is rock criticism's most
impressive stylist. He manages to
be pithy, bitchy and authoritative
without sacrificing either the sub
tlety of his aesthetics or his pas
sionate affection for good-time
serious garage rock. If his rather
cranky and astringent political
ideology sometimes limits his per
ceptions, it also makes him more
interesting, hence more useful, to
argue with.
Selected Poems: 1950-1982
by Kenneth Koch
Vintage, 239 pp., $9.95
With Frank O'Hara, James
Schuyler and John Ashbery, Ken
neth Koch represents the best of

what has been called "The New
York School" of poetry. This
handsome selection brings to
gether most of Koch's best work,
some of which has been out of
print for years, into an easily
available edition. (There are,
however, no excerpts from his
two book-length, Byronesque
poems, "Ko, or a Season on
Earth" and"The Duplications.")
Koch is an exuberant, urbane
poet. There is no precious seeking
for "the perfect image" in his
work, no sense of inflated per
sonal importance, no lonely
mystical bees-give-me-secrets
hokum. If a predominant ten
dency among poets today is to
wrestle with the problems of lang
uage's efficacy, Koch does not
share this tendency. Words aren't
things, so what? They're ours,
more or less, so let's cruise. In
"Fresh Air," a riotous attack on
the academic poetry of the '50s,
he imagines "the new poem of the
twentieth century/ Which, though
influenced by Mallarme, Shelley,
Byron, and Whitman/ Plus a mil
lion other poets, is still entirely
original/ And is so exciting that it
cannot here be repeated."
Although Koch's playfulness
can sometimes become a little
arch, I find his mocking, fast
dancing tone capable of a human
sensitivity and alertness the
editors of "The American Poetry
Review" can't even dream of.
This is from an early poem, en
titled "To You": "I am crazier
than shirttails/ In the wind, when
you're near, a wind that blows
from/ The big blue sea, so shiny
so deep and so unlike us/ . . . and
I love you/ Best at dawn, when
even before I am awake the sun/
Receives me in the questions
which you always pose."

the academic poetry of the '50s,
he imagines "the new poem of the
twentieth century/ Which, though
influenced by Mallarme, Shelley,
Byron, and Whitman/ Plus a mil
lion other poets, is still entirely
original/ And is so exciting that it
cannot here be repeated."
Although Koch's playfulness
can sometimes become a little
arch, I find his mocking, fast
dancing tone capable of a human
sensitivity and alertness the
editors of "The American Poetry
Review" can't even dream of.
This is from an early poem, en
titled "To You": "I am crazier
than shirttails/ In the wind, when
you're near, a wind that blows
from/ The big blue sea, so shiny
so deep and so unlike us/ . . . and
I love you/ Best at dawn, when
even before I am awake the sun/
Receives me in the questions
which you always pose."

Fortunate Son: The Best of Dave
Mirsh

Random House, 337 pp., $9.95
An annoying strategy used too
often by rock critics: They start
off by proudly asserting their
bona fide working-class status.
Look at me, they say, I'm from
the streets! Rock music is made
for me by people like me — so
watch out! Dave Marsh's book
opens: "When I was a boy, my
family lived on East Beverly
Street in Pontiac, Michigan, in a
two-bedroom house with blue
white asphalt shingles that
cracked at the edges when a ball
was thrown against them and left
a powder like talc on fingers
rubbed across their shallow
grooves. East Beverly ascended a
slowly rising hill. At the very top,
a block and a half from our place,
Pontiac Motors Assembly Line
16 sprawled for a mile or so be
hind a fenced-in parking lot."
What does this mean? I guess
that to Dave Marsh, who is easily
rock music's most distinguished
and prolific critic, it means that
from out of the wastelands
created by capitalism and indus
try there has come an authentic,
democratic art that is by its very
nature an art of protest — a line
that is hard to argue with. But I
think that trumpeting one's
tough, earthy and natural roots
succeeds in conveying something
more insidious, something cheap
and romanticizing. For if rock
truly is a popular music, where all
you need is a radio and an instru
ment to participate in it, then this
mythicizing of the urban poor,
claiming that they are the natural
recipients of things like "drive"
and "feel," is elitist. So you end
up getting into odd arguments
with these people: I was poorer

than you were, or blacker, or
gayer, certainly more economi
cally marginal than you were.
You become rock-and-roll Jacobs
conniving for Isaac's working
class birthright, all for the pur
pose of guaranteeing for one's
writing an unstamp-outable cor
rectness in the eyes of your peers
or readers. (Needless to say, it
would contradict this view for me
to tell you how gritty and
frightening my youth was, or how
unimpeachable it has since made
my ideas about Katrina and the
Waves.)
This said, I should also say that

Marsh's working-class flag
waving doesn't mess up his essays
too much. He does say that the
Beach Boys' suburban upbringing
made it impossible for them not
to self-destruct. (The thoroughly
middle-class backgrounds of Bob
Dylan, Mick Jagger and Phil
Spector go unexamined.) And he
overpraises John Cafferty and the
Beaver Brown Band for their al
leged Springsteenesque identifi
cation with the disaster that is
New Jersey. (Cafferty's recent
hit, "It's Tough All Over," is a
model of cliche and condescen
sion.)

Otherwise, Marsh can spot bull
shit a mile away. He doesn't feel
beholden to old idols, his own or
those of other critics. So Lou
Reed, Elvis Costello, Rod
Stewart, The Band, The Doors,
even Pete Townshend, are un
compromisingly assessed in the
light of their original promise and
vision. So are Elvis Presley,
Motown's Berry Gordy and Sly
Stone. The essays in this collec
tion thus have a kind of sad,
echoic character.
On the other hand, Marsh
rightly praises Lynard Skynard
("as good a band as America
produced after Woodstock whose
redneck allegiances have kept
them from being taken as
seriously as many more half
baked but superficially serious
competitors") and James Jamer
son, the unknown bass player for
Motown who "deserves as much
credit as any instrumentalist for
changing the way rock sounds."
After Lester Bangs, Dave
Marsh, who has written books on
Bruce Springsteen, The Who, and
edited "The Book of Rock Lists"
and"The Rolling Stone Record
Guide," is rock criticism's most
impressive stylist. He manages to
be pithy, bitchy and authoritative
without sacrificing either the sub
tlety of his aesthetics or his pas
sionate affection for good-time
serious garage rock. If his rather
cranky and astringent political
ideology sometimes limits his per
ceptions, it also makes him more
interesting, hence more useful, to
argue with.
Selected Poems: 1950-1982
by Kenneth Koch
Vintage, 239 pp., $9.95
With Frank O'Hara, James
Schuyler and John Ashbery, Ken
neth Koch represents the best of

what has been called "The New
York School" of poetry. This
handsome selection brings to
gether most of Koch's best work,
some of which has been out of
print for years, into an easily
available edition. (There are,
however, no excerpts from his
two book-length, Byronesque
poems, "Ko, or a Season on
Earth" and"The Duplications.")
Koch is an exuberant, urbane
poet. There is no precious seeking
for "the perfect image" in his
work, no sense of inflated per
sonal importance, no lonely
mystical bees-give-me-secrets
hokum. If a predominant ten
dency among poets today is to
wrestle with the problems of lang
uage's efficacy, Koch does not
share this tendency. Words aren't
things, so what? They're ours,
more or less, so let's cruise. In
"Fresh Air," a riotous attack on
the academic poetry of the '50s,
he imagines "the new poem of the
