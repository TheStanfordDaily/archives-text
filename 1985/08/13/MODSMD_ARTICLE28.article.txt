### REBECCA ZEIGLER Staff writer 
Saturday began a new chapter
in a Stanford fairytale, "Once
Upon a Time in Manzanita
Park." As Paula Brazil, Class of
1984, and Scott Warner, who
graduated in June, walked down
the aisle of Stanford's Memorial
Church and exchanged their
vows Saturday, they became the
second of three Stanford pairs
who simultaneously lived in
Manzanita trailers 37X and 37Y
in 1983-84 to marry this year.
Cass Linebaugh and Jeff
McNally, who both graduated in
June, married in Palo Alto
during their senior year. And
the third pair, Mark Warren,'
Class of '84, and Melinda Zac
hary, Class of '85, are engaged
to be married in November in
Schacter, Melinda's hometown.
One by one the three couples
got together, and coincidentally
spent their junior year living five
feet apart in neighboring
trailers. "We never would have
predicted that it would have
turned out this way," Mark said.
It all began in the fall of 1981
when Jeff, Cass and Melinda all
spent their freshman year living
in Donner. Jeff and Cass were
also in the same advising group.
Cass and Melinda became
good friends and decided to
room together the next year.
When they moved in sophomore
year, they coincidentally found
Jeff and his friend Scott from
the baseball team living in the
trailer next to theirs.
The four spent a lot of time
together. Shortly thereafter, Jeff
and Cass began dating and by
spring quarter were fairly
serious about their relationship.
"Jeff and Scott would always
talk about Mark and what a dar
ling boy he was," said Melinda.
"They were right." The story of
Melinda and Mark's romance is

quite serendipitous.
"When Jeff and and Scott had
their little sisters visiting them,
they would often dump them on
me to take care of and show
around," said Melinda. "One
morning, the end of sophomore
year, I was taking them to the
airport and ran out of gas on the
freeway.
Neither Jeff nor Scott was
home, "so I called their friend
Mark, who I had never met, as a
last resort. When he arrived, the
knight in white armor with the
gas can, I fell in love with him
immediately," she continued.
Paula entered the picture as
the Manzanita resident adviser
while Cass, Melinda, Scott and
Jeff lived in the trailers their
sophomore year, and she
became a good friend of Jeffs.
AH had plans to remain in the
trailers their next year but some
didn't pull low enough draw
numbers.
Jeff persuaded Cass and
Melinda to room with Paula,
who was able to pull strings and
get the three girls and Mark into
the trailers despite their num
bers. Once again, the two
groups were coincidentally as
signed to neighboring trailers,
37X and 37Y.
"We ate all of our meals to
gether. We did the grocery
shopping together," said
Melinda. "It was more like
having a good time than going to
school," commented Mark.
"We had a 24-hour, open
door policy between the two
trailers," added Melinda. "Our
mothers would call, and we
would say 'Just a minute' and
run over to the other trailer to
find whoever it was for."
Much to the surprise of the
others, Paula and Scott soon
became the third and final
couple in the group. "Paula and
Scott never said two words to

each other first quarter," said
Melinda. "We never expected
it," added Mark. "Their per
sonalities are so different."
Cass left winter and spring
quarters to study with a Brig
ham Young University program
in London. "We were pretty
serious by then," said Jeff. "It
was hard to be apart, but really
it was good time for me to do
some thinking and concentrate
on my pre-med studies. It
strengthened our relationship."
Mark, Jeff and Scott all
played baseball during the
1982-83 season, and for various
reasons all quit the team the
next year. "We girls would listen
to the three baseball has-beens
and constantly hear about what
they would be doing if they were
playing," said Melinda laughing.
"My favorite activity was our
once-a-weeker," remembered
Mark. We would stay up until 3
a.m. or so together talking and
playing old records from the
'60s and the '705."
"The girls would always try to
impress the boys with their
domestic skills. Paula made this
great lasagne, and it grew into a
kind of competition," told
Melinda. "Cass made the
world's worst spaghetti, and I
couldn't cook at all. So we all sat
through some pretty awful
meals."
Senior year the group went
their separate ways, although
they spent time together
whenever possible. Mark had
graduated and had a job in Los
Angeles, and Melinda trans
ferred to USC to be closer to
him.
Jeff became an RAin Otero,
and Cass remained in the
trailers with two new
roommates. The pair got
married during their senior year.
Paula was working in Cupertino
while Scott finished his last year.

Just one week after they got
their bachelor's degrees this
June, Jeff in economics and Cass
in English, the newlyweds
moved to the small college town
of Bozeman in the mountains of
Montana. "Cass is from Salt
Lake City, and I'm from Bil
lings, Montana," said Jeff. "We
wanted to move closer to
home."
On July 13 Cass gave birth to
a daughter Caitlin. Jeff is en
rolled in a medical program that
has him studying at Montana
State University for one year
starting this fall and then at the
University of Washington in
Seattle for the rest of his medi
cal school education.
"Cass was a very good student
at Stanford. Right now she feels
it is important to stay home with
our child, but eventually she
might get her teaching creden
tial or maybe go to law school,"
said Jeff.
Paula, who got both her bach
elor's degree in psychology and
her master's in communication
from Stanford, and Scott, who
majored in sociology, will be
living in a condominium in
Cupertino. Scott is interviewing
for the Santa Clara police force.
Mark graduated in psychol
ogy and Melinda, a former Daily
reporter, majored in communi
cation. Mark is studying toward
his master's degree in computer
science in Sacramento. Melinda
just moved up to the
Sacramento area and is cur
rently looking for employment.
Mark and Melinda have
planned their wedding for No
vember. "All of us are definitely
going to be together again there,
even if we have to pay to fly
Cass and Jeff out here," said
Melinda. "Right now Mark and
I are saving our pennies to go
visit Jeff and Cass with the
baby."
