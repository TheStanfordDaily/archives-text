# Phone system slated for January start

The 7,000 phones that will serve the
main campus in Stanford's new $21 million
phone system should be operational by late
January, according to Michael Roberts,
director of the University's Telecommuni
cations Project. The Telecommunications
Project selected and arranged for the new
SLIOO system.
The Medical Center's approximately
6,000 phones, should be working by mid-
March, Roberts said.
Installation of the SLIOO system began
last fall and will continue into December or
January, when the main campus will begin
using the new system. The Medical Center

will switch systems later, when initial prob
lems with the system have been found and
solved. The entire system should be opera
tional by the middle of March, said
Roberts, also deputy director of Informa
tion Technology Systems.
"Most people will end up in December
or January with two phones on their desk,"
said Roberts. At that time, the new phones
will be able to reach other phones on the
new system, but will be unable to call num
bers with a 497 prefix or numbers outside
the University. On an unspecified weekend
toward the end of January, the new system
will be coupled to the trunk lines connect
ing Stanford to the outside. The same

process will occur in March for the Medical
Center. After that, the old rotary phones
will be disconnected.
Inconveniences resulting from the
change to the new system should be mini
mal or nonexistent for most of the campus,
Roberts said.
In some areas of the campus it will be
more difficult to install the new telephones,
and minor inconveniences may result.
Causes of the difficulty lie in the tricky
wiring for the older buildings. ''There's
some exotic wiring that has to be done,"
Roberts said. "After all, the campus is 100
years old.''
"A few scattered places may suffer inter

ruptions," he said, "but no one will be
without a functioning telephone.''
Purchased from Northern Telecom Cor
poration after a competitive bidding
process, the SLIOO system replaces the 13-
year-old Centrex network currently used
by Stanford. The SLIOO will serve only the
main campus and the Medical Center.
About half the $21 million cost will be
paid to Northern Telecom for supplying
the SLIOO system, the telephones and
training on the new phones. The
remainder, according to Roberts, will pay
for new cables and wiring, expansion of the
