# Pre-meds urged to take courses in liberal arts

### MARSH T. McCALL Editorial staff 
Only a broad education in the humanities will teach pre
medical students how to cope with ethical issues and to
avoid "medical solutions for social problems," according
to Ernie Young, associate dean of Stanford's Memorial
Church and senior lecturer in ethics at the Medical School.
Young, who last month told a seminar hosted by the
John S. Knight fellowships of the Department of Commu
nication that breaches of professional integrity are becom
ing "endemic," said yesterday that problems such as care
of the elderly and treatment of the mentally ill exemplify
how physicians employ "high-tech" solutions for social
health problems. One answer to this dilemma is for pre
meds to take humanities courses like literature and philos
ophy, thereby "learning how to think" and gaining experi
ence about the ethics of these social problems, Young said.
"I'd like to see someone with a good liberal arts educa
tion," said Young. "There is plenty of time for sciences."
Young said that instead of trying to assimilate ever
changing scientific facts, students should learn "to think
where to go for the facts."
"A science book from 1982 is already out of date,"
Young said, "while Dickens is still relevant." Students
who gain this liberal arts background, Young said, are bet
ter equipped to deal with ethical problems.
"We don't do much to ensure care of the elderly,"
Young said. "Often we'll pay for high-tech treatments, but
not for chronic care. This
represents a medical solution for
a social problem. It's costly and
doesn't address the problem:
How must we deal with the needs
of the elderly?"
Young teaches two courses in

ethics at the Medical School in
which he deals with met
hodologies for dealing with ethi
cal issues. The issues discussed in
clude the entire life cycle, from
birth and genetics to death.
"My second course deals with
the question 'What is it that*
makes us human beings?' It's the
answer to that question which af
fects how we deal with these is

sues."
Robert Kessler, associate pro
fessor of surgery at the Medical
Center, said yesterday that doc
tors should isolate themselves
from "dealing with moral issues."
"But med students do need to
be aware of ethical decisions,"
Kessler said, acknowledging that
a well-rounded education would
aid in this aspect.

Kessler said that older med stu
dents, who have returned to
school after pursuing other goals,
tend to "deal with patients bet
ter."
Stanford History Prof. Barton
Bernstein, who is currently
researching a book on medical et
hics, said yesterday that while an
education slanted more toward
the humanities might benefit a

pre-med student, it would take a
"tenacious" individual to do so,
given medical school require
ments.
"We should ask, 'What values
do medical schools have?' "
Bernstein said.
"The consumer should be as
well-informed as possible on
medicine and health issues,"
Young said.
