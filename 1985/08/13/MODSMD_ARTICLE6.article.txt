University President Donald Kennedy
criticized a proposal by California Assem
bly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Fran
cisco) that would, in his words, "redirect
state funds from low-income students of
exceptional ability to lower-income stu
dents of lower academic ability."
Kennedy's remarks to a Rotary Club
meeting at Canada College in Redwood
City last week came in response to the bill,
which would give Cal Grant A awards to
students meeting minimum academic
standards in order of greatest to least fin
ancial need. The current system awards the
grants in order of highest to lowest grade
point averages.
"The effect ... is to deny choice of
needy students with thesgreatest academic
potential in favor of extending choice to
lower-income students of lower academic
ability," Kennedy said.
The Cal Grant A is designed so that un
usually able students with financial need
are able to attend the college of their
choice. The Cal Grant B program is de
signed to improve the access of very poor
and minority students to college.
The Cal Grant A program awarded al
most $28 million to more than 16,000 stu
dents, including 675 students at Stanford.
The Cal Grant B program awarded almost
$9 million to 7,500 students, including 19
Stanford students.
