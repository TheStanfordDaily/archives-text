## 517 feared dead in Japanese air crash 
### 
KITA-AIKIMURA, Japan — A
Japanese jumbo jet packed with 524
people crashed in the rugged mountains of
central Japan yesterday. Seven survivors
were found in the wreckage of what is
believed to be the worst single-plane crash
ever.
Identified survivors include two
women, the 8-year-old daughter of one,
and a 12-year-old girl. All were taken by
military helicopter to a hospital in Fujioka,
25 miles east of the crash site, police said.
Hospital official Kiyomi Shinozaki said
three other survivors were to arrive at the
hospital soon, but he had no other details.
The extent of the survivors' injuries was
not known.
The Fuji Television network reported
that at least 30 bodies had been found in
the wreckage of the plane, which plowed
into a mountain ridge while trying for an
emergency landing yesterday.
Initial reports from the first Japan Self-
Defense Force teams to reach the site had
indicated there were no survivors. But
authorities later confirmed the finding of
the seven, and television pictures showed
two on stretchers, dirty, battered and
bandaged. They were identified as Hiroko
Yoshizaki, 35, and her daughter, Mikiko,
8.
Another survivor, Keiko Kawakami, 12,

was said by Fuji TV to have been rescued
from the branches of a tree. A fourth, a
woman who was originally reported as a

young boy, was identified as Yumi Ochiai,
26.
Three dozen helicopter-borne troops
made a rope descent into steep, thickly
forested mountain country this morning to
reach the wreckage of the Japan Air Lines
Boeing 747.
The jetliner, which was on a domestic
flight from Tokyo to Osaka, crashed at
about 5,000 feet. The pilot, Masami
Takahama, 49, had reported a door was
broken and said he was fighting for control
and would try an emergency landing.
JAL spokesman Geoffrey Tudor said
two Americans were on the passenger
manifest. They were identified as Edward
Anderson, believed to be 48, and Michael
Hanson, 40, both employees of Stearns
Catalytic Co. of Denver. Neil McLagan, a
Stearns vice president, confirmed Ander
son and Hanson were on the airplane.
The jetliner crashed at about 6:54 p.m.
(2:54 a.m. PDT), on the north side of
Mount Ogura, a 6,929-foot peak about 50
miles from Yokota and 70 miles northwest
of Tokyo.
The site is in a remote area in a range
known as the Japan Alps. The only roads
in the region follow river valleys that cut
through steep, densely forested moun
tainsides.
In Seattle, Boeing spokesman Bill Mel

lon said a five-member team of company
investigators would leave today for Japan.
In Washington, Ed Pinto, a Federal Avia
tion Administration spokesmen, said FAA
investigators might be sent if Japanese offi
cials requested them.
Tudor said JAL flight 123 left Tokyo's
Haneda Airport bound for Osaka carrying
509 passengers, including 12 infants, and a
crew of 15.
Tudor said that at 6:36 p.m. the plane
reported: "Rear 5 door broken, making
emergency descent."
Kyodo News Service said the plane in
formed Tokyo Air Traffic Control Center
at 6:29 p.m. that it wanted to return and
would report the reason later. This could
not immediately be confirmed.
U.S. spokesmen at Yokota Air Base, a
major American military base about 20
miles west of Tokyo, said the pilot asked
for and received permission to make an
emergency landing.
Most aircraft are loaded to capacity at
this time of year, when families tradition
ally gather at ancestral homes to pay
respects to their forebears.
JAL said the plane was a 7475R, a
Boeing model configured for large pas
senger loads on relatively short flights. The
SR stands for short range.
