Violence mounts in South Africa
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Police armed with rub
ber whips went from house to house in Kwa-Thema township
yesterday, forcing black students to go to class, while a black con
sumer boycott spread through the nation's industrial heartland.
Police and other sources reported 11 more black deaths. That
brings the unofficial toll in a year of riots to 600 dead, surpassing
the violence that began in Soweto in 1976 as South Africa's
bloodiest black uprising against white rule.
Police and soldiers surrounded Kwa-Thema township, east of
Johannesburg, yesterday morning and went from house to house
forcing students to go to schools they had been boycotting, wit
nesses said.
Students said those who refused were beaten with rubber
whips. Once at school, the pupils refused to enter classes. Police
used tear gas to disperse at least one group of loitering youths.
Young blacks have boycotted classes for months in riot
affected areas.
In Johannesburg, 32 white students from the University of the
Witwatersrand were injured and eight were arrested when police
dispersed protesters at the start of a three-day boycott. White
students in Cape Town also have boycotted classes in solidarity
with blacks.
Thousands of black workers in Pretoria heeded a three-day
general strike call from Saturday to yesterday and a consumer
boycott that is to last until Aug. 28, news reports said.
South Africa's designated ambassador, Herbert Beukes, was
back in Washington yesterday, two weeks after being recalled in
what was interpreted as an indication of displeasure with the
Reagan Administration.
Embassy spokesman Paul Coetzee said Beukes, who has not
yet been formally received by President Reagan, went home to
help prepare for last week's meeting in Austria with senior
American officials.
A researcher at the South African Institute of Race Relations,
which counts the toll of the violence, put the fatalities at 594 fol
lowing a week of riots in Durban that left 67 dead, and before
police reported six more deaths yesterday. Police have not given
a total fatality count.
The 1976 riots started in Soweto on June 16 of that year, and
575 had been killed when they ended in February 1977, accord
ing to a government report.
Factions duel on Green Line
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Militiamen battled across Beirut's
dividing line yesterday, and gunners on both sides sprayed resi
dential areas with artillery fire. At least 16 people were reported
killed and 75 wounded.
Among the wounded in the duel between Christian and Mos
lem fighters was Souha Chahin, this year's Miss Lebanon. It was
the fiercest combat in weeks in the capital, where Syria has been
trying to impose a peace plan to end Lebanon's decade of civil
war.
The latest casualties raised the known toll in the fighting since
early Saturday to at least 24 dead and 133 wounded— the high
est count since June, when 28 people were killed in an overnight
battle.
Police said militiamen fired more than 3,500 shells in 24 hours
into residential districts on both sides of the Green Line frontier
between Christian East Beirut and the Moslem districts in the
city's western and southern sectors.
Each side accused the other of shooting first, and no one ap
peared to know what set off the latest round of sectarian blood
letting.
It came at a time of political maneuvering on both sides and
demands from Moslem leaders that Lebanon's Christian presi
dent, Amin Gemayel, resign because of his failure to institute
reforms that would give Moslems an equal share of power.
Two people were killed and three seriously wounded when a
mortar round exploded on the American University campus in
Moslem West Beirut.
Pope attacks rights violations
YAOUNDE, Cameroon — Pope John Paul II made clear yes
terday that the church will speak forcefully for human rights in
Africa, and attacked race discrimination in white-ruled South
Africa for the second day in a row.
He also said birth control programs are introducing a
"powerful anti-life mentality" into developing countries.
Vatican officials said the pope wants Africans to take an ethi
cal and moral road to development rather than a purely material
one.
On the fifth day of his seven-nation tour of Africa, the pontiff
also made these points in four policy addresses here and in
Bamenda, a Christian stronghold in northwestern Cameroon:
• Christians and Moslems must resist temptations to impose their
ideologies on each other and seek to live together peacefully in
this "era of polarization."
• In his criticism of South Africa's apartheid racial policy, John
Paul also called for the independence of Namibia, which South
Africa controls against the wishes of the United Nations.
"Dignity (of a nation) presupposes above all an authentic na
tional independence," he said in a speech to President Paul Biya
and assembled diplomats. "This should be the case in all of the
countries of Africa, and I'm thinking particularly of Namibia."
Through his spokesmen, the pope expressed pleasure at Biya's
reported decision to free 55 political prisoners held since a coup
attempt in April 1984.

Among the wounded in the duel between Christian and Mos
lem fighters was Souha Chahin, this year's Miss Lebanon. It was
the fiercest combat in weeks in the capital, where Syria has been
trying to impose a peace plan to end Lebanon's decade of civil
war.
The latest casualties raised the known toll in the fighting since
early Saturday to at least 24 dead and 133 wounded— the high
est count since June, when 28 people were killed in an overnight
battle.
Police said militiamen fired more than 3,500 shells in 24 hours
into residential districts on both sides of the Green Line frontier
between Christian East Beirut and the Moslem districts in the
city's western and southern sectors.
Each side accused the other of shooting first, and no one ap
peared to know what set off the latest round of sectarian blood
letting.
It came at a time of political maneuvering on both sides and
demands from Moslem leaders that Lebanon's Christian presi
dent, Amin Gemayel, resign because of his failure to institute
reforms that would give Moslems an equal share of power.
Two people were killed and three seriously wounded when a
mortar round exploded on the American University campus in
Moslem West Beirut.
Pope attacks rights violations
YAOUNDE, Cameroon — Pope John Paul II made clear yes
terday that the church will speak forcefully for human rights in
Africa, and attacked race discrimination in white-ruled South
Africa for the second day in a row.
He also said birth control programs are introducing a
"powerful anti-life mentality" into developing countries.
Vatican officials said the pope wants Africans to take an ethi
cal and moral road to development rather than a purely material
one.
On the fifth day of his seven-nation tour of Africa, the pontiff
also made these points in four policy addresses here and in
Bamenda, a Christian stronghold in northwestern Cameroon:
• Christians and Moslems must resist temptations to impose their
ideologies on each other and seek to live together peacefully in
this "era of polarization."
• In his criticism of South Africa's apartheid racial policy, John
Paul also called for the independence of Namibia, which South
Africa controls against the wishes of the United Nations.
"Dignity (of a nation) presupposes above all an authentic na
tional independence," he said in a speech to President Paul Biya
and assembled diplomats. "This should be the case in all of the
countries of Africa, and I'm thinking particularly of Namibia."
Through his spokesmen, the pope expressed pleasure at Biya's
reported decision to free 55 political prisoners held since a coup
attempt in April 1984.
