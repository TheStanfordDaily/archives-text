# Reagan library controversy
## Behavioral center may quit Stanford 
### MARSH T. McCALL Editorial staff 
Traffic conditions brought
about by the construction of the
proposed Reagan library could
cause the Center for Advanced
Study in the Behavioral Sciences
(CASBS) to relocate to another
university, according to CASBS
representatives.
In a letter to Donald Kennedy
dated Feb. 5 and made public
Wednesday, CASBS Board
Chairman Neil Smelser and Vice
Chairman Robert Solow ex
pressed "grave doubts" concern
ing the present location of the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Li
brary, which, pending approval
by Santa Clara County, is
to be situated within a 20-acre
site in the Stanford foothills, ad
jacent to the CASBS.
The letter stated that "the con
struction period for the road,
parking lot, and library would be
one of steady noise and move
ment, and the subsequent period
would be one of continuous noise
pollution, visual distraction, and
congested traffic â€” conditions
that are as conducive to the
destruction of the center's atmos
phere as its present conditions are
conducive to its success."

Solow, a sociology professor at
UC-Berkeley, said yesterday
that although decisions regarding
construction and traffic distur
bances at the proposed library are
"too far down the road" for
meaningful comment, there is
"possibility of relocation at an
other university."
One proposed road leading to
the library would pass very close
to the center's administrative of
fice and some of the studies,
Solow explained, causing a
"disruption to the isolated atmos
phere."
CASBS Director Gardner
Lind/.ey, quoted Wednesday in a
University news release, said,
"We are optimistic about the
likelihood of working out an ar
rangement that is mutually accep
table."
However, in a second letter to
Kennedy, Lindzey wrote, "The
relatively obvious item for
negotiation is the access road. . . .
It is a dependable prediction that
if this goes between the
(Stanford) Observatory and the
center, the (CASBS) trustees will
decide to seek a new location."

The traffic, noise and distractions caused by the proposed Reagan library and its construction might cause
the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences to move to another university, CASBS officials
have told President Kennedy.
president for public affairs and
head of the Reagan Library Plan
ning Committee, said yesterday
that the key issue is simply "how
much traffic and how close to the
center."
"I don't believe the center will
have to relocate," Freelen said.
"There are alternative roads that
can be developed." Freelen said
the planning committee would
"sit down with (representatives
of) the center ,, as construction
plans were developed.
Freelen said public interest
would not be a significant factor
regarding traffic congestion in the
area, explaining that although the
library will include a "modest ex
hibition space," most mem
orabilia has been given to
President Reagan's alma mater,
Eureka College, in Dixon, 111.
The CASBS, at its present site
at Stanford since 19.54, annually
offers fellowships to some 50
"outstanding or very promising"
scholars, who conduct individual
research while enjoying
"complete freedom from other

obligations and distractions," ac
cording to a CASBS brochure.
The center, which presently in
cludes several prominent Stan
ford scholars, has its own board of
trustees and holds no formal af
filiation with the University, al
though to promote scholarly re
search Stanford has leased land to
the CASBS at artificially low
rates.
"Stanford profits from the
presence of an intellectual cen
ter," Solow explained, "but
there's no formal connection."
Although he believed the pro
posed location of the Reagan Li
brary to be "final," Solow said he
hoped access to the library would
"preserve the atmosphere of the
center, after more than 25 years
of existence."
The National Bureau of Eco
nomic Research, also located
near the proposed site, would be
affected by library traffic, unless
the planning committee "put an
other access road at the end of
Campus Drive," according to
bureau employee Rosanna
Reeves.
"If they foresee lots of visitors,
clearly there will be a problem,"
Reeves said. "They certainly
can't use the existing road."
