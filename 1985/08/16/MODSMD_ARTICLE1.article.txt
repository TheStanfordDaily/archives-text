# Reagan library controversy
## Behavioral center may quit Stanford 
### MARSH T. McCALL Editorial staff 
Traffic conditions brought
about by the construction of the
proposed Reagan library could
cause the Center for Advanced
Study in the Behavioral Sciences
(CASBS) to relocate to another
university, according to CASBS
representatives.
In a letter to Donald Kennedy
dated Feb. 5 and made public
Wednesday, CASBS Board
Chairman Neil Smelser and Vice
Chairman Robert Solow ex
pressed "grave doubts" concern
ing the present location of the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Li
brary, which, pending approval
by Santa Clara County, is
to be situated within a 20-acre
site in the Stanford foothills, ad
jacent to the CASBS.
The letter stated that "the con
struction period for the road,
parking lot, and library would be
one of steady noise and move
ment, and the subsequent period
would be one of continuous noise
pollution, visual distraction, and
congested traffic â€” conditions
that are as conducive to the
destruction of the center's atmos
phere as its present conditions are
conducive to its success."

Solow, a sociology professor at
UC-Berkeley, said yesterday
that although decisions regarding
construction and traffic distur
bances at the proposed library are
"too far down the road" for
meaningful comment, there is
"possibility of relocation at an
other university."
One proposed road leading to
the library would pass very close
to the center's administrative of
fice and some of the studies,
Solow explained, causing a
"disruption to the isolated atmos
phere."
CASBS Director Gardner
Lind/.ey, quoted Wednesday in a
University news release, said,
"We are optimistic about the
likelihood of working out an ar
rangement that is mutually accep
table."
However, in a second letter to
Kennedy, Lindzey wrote, "The
relatively obvious item for
negotiation is the access road. . . .
It is a dependable prediction that
if this goes between the
(Stanford) Observatory and the
center, the (CASBS) trustees will
decide to seek a new location."

The traffic, noise and distractions caused by the proposed Reagan library and its construction might cause
the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences to move to another university, CASBS officials
have told President Kennedy.
