Daily insensitive
to SOS A
Your Aug. 2 editorial "Free
Opus sensibly" was irresponsible
and completely unfair. Your
caricature of the activity of Stan
ford Out of South Africa
(SOSA) and, implicitly, that of
similar organizations across the
country, amounts to a surprising
lack of understanding at best.
As the spokesperson for a
freedom of expression medium,
aren't you being pretentious in
describing SOSA's work as an
"endless list of senseless
demands?" How about a respon
sible, engaged and informed
piece instead of insensitive
parody?

Zscau good only
on groundwater
Representative Ed Zschau
(R-Sunnyvale) has sent a
postcard to his constituents

noting that he is chairing a forum
on groundwater protection this
Saturday at Stanford. One can
not disagree that this is an im
portant issue that requires fur
ther action. But I wonder how
Zschau squares his concern for
our groundwater with his vote to
approve nerve-gas production, a
measure attached as a rider to
the MX missile bill.
It is not enough for some
people that our country has the
capability of destroying itself
several times over. They require
even more inhumane weapons.
Chemical, biological and radioac
tive dangers in our own environ
ment are legitimate concerns. No
other human being wants them
either, whether in peace or in
war. The philosophy that ap
proves their use on other peoples
is basically racist. No wonder
that Zschau, despite his desire
for a liberal image, also voted for
so-called "humanitarian" aid to
the Nicaraguan contras and
against sanctions on South
Africa.
