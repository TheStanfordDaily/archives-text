## ROUGH CUTS 
### 
Jerry Lee Lewis
"Milestones" (Rhino)
The Killer returns to vinyl in fine form.
This Rhino compilation has been carefully
selected with the obvious love of a true
aficionado. The tracks span the range of
Lewis' career, from his early sessions with
Sun to his most recent efforts.
No matter what the setting, there is one
undeniable fact: The Killer can cut anyone
at any song. It doesn't matter whether an
other artist wrote it or just made it popular,
Lewis is fierce competition (see "Me and
Bobby McGee," "What I'd Say," even the
traditional "When the Saints Go Marchin'
In").
As proven by his recent show at the
Circle Star, there is no way to keep this
man down. Nothing can deter this living
legend — not scandal (He married his 13-
year-old cousin in the late '505.), blacklist
ing, serious illness or age.
This double-record release is perhaps
the best representation of the body of
Lewis' work, for it manages to unite his
revelatory rock 'n' roll on Sun with his
later straight country efforts on the
Polygram label. Lewis is a brilliant and un
predictable performer, and "Milestones" does
justice to his various guises. The Killer is
destined to always be on the razor's edge
between good and evil, heaven and hell,
saint and sinner. This album proves there's
no finer place to hang out.

Van Morrison
"Live at the Grand Opera House, Belfast"
(Polydor)
This is the Van Morrison album his fans
have been waiting for for the past few

years. Previous skeptics will also enjoy this
LP because 14 Van the Man" is in rare form.
Van on an average night is a force to be
reckoned with; here on a hot night he is
literally "A Full Force Gale." His band is
superb, tight, musucular and, above all, fiery.
The bulk of this 50-minute-plus album is
gathered from his previous four studio ef
forts. In their original incarnations these
tracks were uneven at best — here they
have been reshaped, beefed up and made
to sparkle. This album proves Van to be
the undisputed master of Celtic soul and
R& B.
Van has always had a very powerful and
passionate voice, and he uses these
qualities here to excellent effect. He storms
through "Dweller on the Threshold" and
becomes tender and compassionate on
"It's All in the Game." "Haunts of An
cient Peace" demonstrates his ability to
work the gospel genre, and his soulfulness
is shown especially well in "She Gives Me
Religion."
Van proves once again that he has lost
none of his style, vision or artistic drive.
This is a tour de force performance that
should be rated as one of the top 10 al
bums of the year.
A-
ScreamirT Sirens
"Fiesta!" (Enigma)
Los Angeles' Screamin' Sirens are a
raucous, feminist, country-punk, five
woman outfit. This attempt to label the
band may be too reductionist. They sound
like a cross between the Go-Gos, the Meat
Puppets and Tammy Wynette, if one can
possibly imagine that blend of styles and
sound. Their debut is all one could want

from a first effort; it is alternatively
hilarious, rocking, playful, always surpris
ing and consistently entertaining — plus
they acknowledge their roots. These
women are rough and tough and can hang
with the boys (or beat them up, if neces
sary).
"Maniac," featured on "The Enigma
Variations" (reviewed here last week), is
but the tip of the iceberg. "The Running
Kind" and the loosely autobiographical
"Head for the Hills" (which contains a
great line for feminists: "We don't try to
understand 'em, we just round 'em up and
brand 'em") are pure delights with funny
lyrics and good beats. They even get into a
psuedo-funky groo v . on the tongue-in
cheek "Mr. T I *.y Boogie." Side one alone
might be ** *jugh to earn this record an A,
but unfortunately the second side isn't as
strong.
The majority of the tunes on the B side
are more countryish romps, which while
pleasant and listenable, fail to pack the
punch of the bouncier numbers on the first
side. "Fiesta!" is an apt title; the first side
of this record would enliven just about any
party worthy of the name. Catch them live
next time they are up north; they are
reputed to be murderous on stage.
B-
Jonathan Richman and The Modern
Lovers
"Rockin' And Romance" (Twin/Tone)
Perspective is important when talking
about Jonathan Richman because, without
the proper background and information,
you may easily mistake his current music
for naivete, youthful exuberance or even
unabashed fun.
On one hand, "Rockin' And Romance"
does contain these elements, as if this man

were an eight-year-old singer-songwriter
with a play guitar and a toy piano. But look
a bit deeper and you find the elements of
maturity and wisdom, a certain vision into
the intricacies of life and its loves.
Perspective becomes useful when you
start to actually believe this man is a pre
pubescent crooner. You have to force
yourself to the realization that this is a man
in his 30s, a man who has six or more re
corded albums to his credit, a man who was
playing electric rock 'n 1 roll more than 10
years ago (remember the classic "Road
Runner"?). He's got hair on his chest too.
So with all this perspective we can look
at this album as a kind of second (or third)
childhood for Jonathan, only this time
around he recognizes it all as childhood.
He's talking about the passions of youth
here, about Fenway Park ("The Fenway")
and his baseball idols (Walter Johnson),
about summer hang-outs ("The Beach"),
sci-fi mysteries ("The U.F.O. Man") and
bubble gum ("Chewing Gum Wrapper").
He sees them all from afar while reveling
in the pure joy of his love for them. As he
says in the opening song of the second side,
'Tm Just Beginning to Live," he is
showing his devotion to this new life in a
way that is compelling while at the same
time blissfully ignorant and wonderfully
carefree.
B +
Grading Scale: A: Indispensable to any
comprehensive collection. B: An eminently
listenable record which is lacking or flawed
in some significant way. C: A record that
fans of a particular genre will find, at the
most, moderately enjoyable. D: Even the
most ardent fans will admit that this record
should never have been made. F: Guano.

with a play guitar and a toy piano. But look
a bit deeper and you find the elements of
maturity and wisdom, a certain vision into
the intricacies of life and its loves.
Perspective becomes useful when you
start to actually believe this man is a pre
pubescent crooner. You have to force
yourself to the realization that this is a man
in his 30s, a man who has six or more re
corded albums to his credit, a man who was
playing electric rock 'n 1 roll more than 10
years ago (remember the classic "Road
Runner"?). He's got hair on his chest too.
So with all this perspective we can look
at this album as a kind of second (or third)
childhood for Jonathan, only this time
around he recognizes it all as childhood.
He's talking about the passions of youth
here, about Fenway Park ("The Fenway")
and his baseball idols (Walter Johnson),
about summer hang-outs ("The Beach"),
sci-fi mysteries ("The U.F.O. Man") and
bubble gum ("Chewing Gum Wrapper").
He sees them all from afar while reveling
in the pure joy of his love for them. As he
says in the opening song of the second side,
'Tm Just Beginning to Live," he is
showing his devotion to this new life in a
way that is compelling while at the same
time blissfully ignorant and wonderfully
carefree.
B +
Grading Scale: A: Indispensable to any
comprehensive collection. B: An eminently
listenable record which is lacking or flawed
in some significant way. C: A record that
fans of a particular genre will find, at the
most, moderately enjoyable. D: Even the
most ardent fans will admit that this record
should never have been made. F: Guano.

Jerry Lee Lewis
"Milestones" (Rhino)
The Killer returns to vinyl in fine form.
This Rhino compilation has been carefully
selected with the obvious love of a true
aficionado. The tracks span the range of
Lewis' career, from his early sessions with
Sun to his most recent efforts.
No matter what the setting, there is one
undeniable fact: The Killer can cut anyone
at any song. It doesn't matter whether an
other artist wrote it or just made it popular,
Lewis is fierce competition (see "Me and
Bobby McGee," "What I'd Say," even the
traditional "When the Saints Go Marchin'
In").
As proven by his recent show at the
Circle Star, there is no way to keep this
man down. Nothing can deter this living
legend — not scandal (He married his 13-
year-old cousin in the late '505.), blacklist
ing, serious illness or age.
This double-record release is perhaps
the best representation of the body of
Lewis' work, for it manages to unite his
revelatory rock 'n' roll on Sun with his
later straight country efforts on the
Polygram label. Lewis is a brilliant and un
predictable performer, and "Milestones" does
justice to his various guises. The Killer is
destined to always be on the razor's edge
between good and evil, heaven and hell,
saint and sinner. This album proves there's
no finer place to hang out.

Van Morrison
"Live at the Grand Opera House, Belfast"
(Polydor)
This is the Van Morrison album his fans
have been waiting for for the past few

years. Previous skeptics will also enjoy this
LP because 14 Van the Man" is in rare form.
Van on an average night is a force to be
reckoned with; here on a hot night he is
literally "A Full Force Gale." His band is
superb, tight, musucular and, above all, fiery.
The bulk of this 50-minute-plus album is
gathered from his previous four studio ef
forts. In their original incarnations these
tracks were uneven at best — here they
have been reshaped, beefed up and made
to sparkle. This album proves Van to be
the undisputed master of Celtic soul and
R& B.
Van has always had a very powerful and
passionate voice, and he uses these
qualities here to excellent effect. He storms
through "Dweller on the Threshold" and
becomes tender and compassionate on
"It's All in the Game." "Haunts of An
cient Peace" demonstrates his ability to
work the gospel genre, and his soulfulness
is shown especially well in "She Gives Me
Religion."
Van proves once again that he has lost
none of his style, vision or artistic drive.
This is a tour de force performance that
should be rated as one of the top 10 al
bums of the year.
A-
ScreamirT Sirens
"Fiesta!" (Enigma)
Los Angeles' Screamin' Sirens are a
raucous, feminist, country-punk, five
woman outfit. This attempt to label the
band may be too reductionist. They sound
like a cross between the Go-Gos, the Meat
Puppets and Tammy Wynette, if one can
possibly imagine that blend of styles and
sound. Their debut is all one could want

from a first effort; it is alternatively
hilarious, rocking, playful, always surpris
ing and consistently entertaining — plus
they acknowledge their roots. These
women are rough and tough and can hang
with the boys (or beat them up, if neces
sary).
"Maniac," featured on "The Enigma
Variations" (reviewed here last week), is
but the tip of the iceberg. "The Running
Kind" and the loosely autobiographical
"Head for the Hills" (which contains a
great line for feminists: "We don't try to
understand 'em, we just round 'em up and
brand 'em") are pure delights with funny
lyrics and good beats. They even get into a
psuedo-funky groo v . on the tongue-in
cheek "Mr. T I *.y Boogie." Side one alone
might be ** *jugh to earn this record an A,
but unfortunately the second side isn't as
strong.
The majority of the tunes on the B side
are more countryish romps, which while
pleasant and listenable, fail to pack the
punch of the bouncier numbers on the first
side. "Fiesta!" is an apt title; the first side
of this record would enliven just about any
party worthy of the name. Catch them live
next time they are up north; they are
reputed to be murderous on stage.

Jonathan Richman and The Modern
Lovers
"Rockin' And Romance" (Twin/Tone)
Perspective is important when talking
about Jonathan Richman because, without
the proper background and information,
you may easily mistake his current music
for naivete, youthful exuberance or even
unabashed fun.
On one hand, "Rockin' And Romance"
does contain these elements, as if this man

were an eight-year-old singer-songwriter
with a play guitar and a toy piano. But look
a bit deeper and you find the elements of
maturity and wisdom, a certain vision into
