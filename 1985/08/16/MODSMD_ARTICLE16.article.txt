# Applewood offers alternative pizza
## 
### 
Have you had enough of those
pizza establishments that charge
an arm and a leg for the worst
pizza you have ever eaten? Are
you ready to substitute "Gourmet
Pizzas" for food that's delivered
to your door? If you answer
"yes" to these questions, the res
taurant that should be first on
your list is right up the road.
The Applewood Inn is within
bicycling distance and is definitely
a restaurant for those prepared to
try something a little different on
their pizza. Located at 1001 El
Camino Real in Menlo Park, the
quaint little restaurant has an at
mosphere similar to an Italian
cafe and an assortment of pizzas
that will make even a pizza expert
reach back into his cookbook.
The menu is difficult to
categorize. While the owners,
Bela and Inge Kardos, boast of
their off-the-wall selection of
pizza, Applewood Inn can hardly
be called exclusively an Italian
restaurant. There are a variety of
salads, sandwiches and
hamburgers, crepes and four dif
ferent veal dishes. This is the
place to try if one can't quite
decide for what one's appetite is
yearning.
One may feel a bit uneasy upon
entering the restaurant — no one
greets the diner at the door and
there is no sign giving any instruc
tions on how to order. The feeling
of loneliness quickly dissipates

though when Mr. Kardos, the
smiling owner, issues his greeting
from behind a counter. The
Kardos' are very friendly and go
out of their way to make one feel
welcome in their restaurant.

After ordering with Mr.
Kardos, one must find one's own
seat. This can be challenging, as
this relatively small establishment
is acquiring an ever increasing
following. Once seated, the next
test is listening for one's number
— the signal to run to the counter
to get one's food.

My guest and I decided to start
our meal with a soup and salad
plate. The soup, made fresh daily,
was mushroom, served piping hot
and chock-full of mushrooms. It
had a strange taste, though, and

was a bit hard to swallow. The
salad, however, is quite good. It is
unusually large with chilled
lettuce, nice, juicy tomatoes, and
dressing served on the side.
An unexpected surprise
awaited us in the form of a bread
called langos. Langos is a superb
Hungarian garlic bread. The cir

cular slice of bread is brought to
the table warm, with a chunk of
garlic waiting to be blended in.
Make sure to rub the garlic in
while the bread is still warm so it
will absorb the flavor. At $3.75,
this combination of soup, salad
and bread is almost a meal in it
self.
Because we couldn't decide if
this was strictly a pizza place or a
restaurant specializing in Italian
cuisine, our order was out of the
ordinary, and much more than
two people should be allowed to
eat in one sitting.
Our first visit was to the Italian
side of the menu, as we ordered
the fettucine Alfredo and a ravioli
with meat sauce. Both portions
were very large and very good;
the ravioli in particular. Filled
with beef and served with a
savory meat sauce, tnis plate is
definitely recommended. Each
meal cost $5.50.
Thinking that we should also
review the pizza, we then ordered
a small, ten-inch pizza. This was a
very tough decision, as the twelve
pies on the menu did not ring a
bell with either of us. It was time
to ask for a help, and the owner
kindly filled us in on which pizzas
seemed most popular. With his
input, we finally settled on a com
bination of the two best sellers
Our pizza, consisting of the
Budapest (sauteed onion, bell
pepper, tomato and Hungarian

sausage) and the Nice (spinach,
fresh tomato, onion and ricotta
cheese) were, in a word, different.
A tongue that has grown used to
pepperoni and cheese is not quick
to accept spinach and onion on its
pizza. After bypassing that initial
reservation, I found the pizza to
be an enjoyable, if curious,
change.
Every pizza contains some in
gredients which, at first glance,
would appear better suited to an
other recipe. Somehow, toppings
such as caviar, eggs, plums and
coconut don't seem fit for a pizza.
For one not quite ready to give
his palates an experiment in taste,
Applewood Inn does offer the
opportunity to build a pizza with
a more familiar choice of top
pings. The prices are extremely
reasonable; our small, unique pie
was less than $6. Medium and
large pizzas, containing one item,
start out at $6.50 and $8.75
respectively.
When in the mood for an at
tractive restaurant with a diverse
and equitable menu, Applewood
Inn is a viable alternative. The
personal touch given by its
owners really make you feel at
home.
And the pizza will leave one re
evaluating everything one
thought one knew about this
traditional favorite.
