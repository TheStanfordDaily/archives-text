# Kiyoshi has all the right ingredients

### 
We had been planning for this
meal all week. Having heard that
this Japanese restaurant serves
excellent food — and since we
were starving — we were in a
state of eager anticipation as we
pulled into the parking lot of
Kiyoshi.
The quietly elegant interior is
in pleasant contrast to the rather
plain exterior of the restaurant,
which is located at 1328 El
Camino Real in Menlo Park.
Inside there are two intimate
rooms with an open arrangement
of tables, but screens between
some of the tables in the second
allow more privacy.
For those who wish to experi
ence a more traditional way of
dining, one can remove one's
shoes and sit on a raised platform
surrounded by wooden screens.
The whole restaurant has a very
authentic Japanese atmosphere,
from the paintings on the walls to
the Japanese music playing in the
background.
The waitresses in their tradi
tional kimonos also add to the at
mosphere while providing excel
lent service. As one walks in, she
is shown to her table by a smiling
hostess, and the waitresses are
very attentive but never over
bearing, allowing one to linger
over her meal.
Kiyoshi's selection, which in

cludes basic Japanese dishes such
as sushi, teriyaki, tempura and
sashimi, is displayed on menus
written on the pleats of elegant
wooden fans. The prices are as
appealing as the menus — the
dinners range in price from $8.95
to $16.95, and this includes a
small appetizer, soup, salad, rice
and dessert in addition to the
main course — definitely enough
to eat.
To start our meal, we ordered
Tekka Maki, a sushi of raw tuna,
and a bottle of the Japanese beer
Sapporo. Since we are both
teriyaki fans, we ordered the
teriyaki steak and tempura com
bination dinner and the teriyaki
chicken and tempura; immedi

ately after completing our order
we were brought our dinner ap
petizer and beverages.
The appetizer was small, but
artfully arranged. The Tekka
Maki followed, and at $4.50 it
was well worth the price. There
were 12 great tasting pieces, and
we didn't finish for fear of becom
ing too full for our dinner. By this
time we were congratulating our
selves on our choice of restau
rants and eagerly anticipating the
rest of the meal.
The next course was the soup,
an onion and tofu broth with
shredded cabbage to dip in it — a
challenge for our chopsticks, but
well worth the effort. (Kiyoshi
places no silverware on the table,

a fact we appreciated, but one
that may not appeal to everyone.)
The main course reflected an
attention to detail; our steak and
chicken arrived already sliced
into bite-size pieces and was deli
cious. The tempura included
shrimp (wonderful and also
available as an entree), carrots,
zucchini and other vegetables
cooked in a light batter and
served on a bamboo platter. The
whole meal, down to the salad
and rice, was excellent. When we
finally put down our chopsticks
we were as full as we could pos
sibly be.
The waitress somehow
managed to persuade us to have
the dessert that came with the

meal. We had a choice of vanilla
or green tea ice cream, tangerine
sherbert or mandarin oranges.
We chose the green tea ice cream
and the tangerine sherbert —
both were very good and pro
vided a nice finishing touch to the
meal.
At the end of the evening we
were pleasantly full and agreed
the dinner had been a complete
success. After all, what more can
you ask for than great atmos
phere, excellent food and fantas
tic service for a reasonable price?
I don't know.
It's all there at Kiyoshi.
