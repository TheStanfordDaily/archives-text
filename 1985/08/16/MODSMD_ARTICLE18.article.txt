# Knopfler trades guitar for schlock
## 
### 
Mark Knopfler, lead singer and
songwriter for Dire Straits, is one of the
greatest guitarists in the world. That is why
his new new album is so disappointing.
Why was his first album so marvelous? A
rhetorical question, because the answer is
obvious.
By using a unique two-fingered picking
style, by choosing a full, vibrant, bluesy
stratocaster sound and (most important) by
employing exquisite, delicate phrasing bet
ter than any other major rock guitarist
ever, that's how. Sure, the songs weren't
bad — romantic and corny, with an attrac
tive western "twang," but it was Knopler's
guitar that made the music. His voice, of
course, was full of emotion, yet attractively
terrible, like Ringo Starr or a young Bob
Dylan, revealing an artist who, although
guitarist first and foremost, wanted to write
and sing his own songs.
He knew, however, that people were
buying the guiter playing. In an age of syn
thesizer rock, it was wonderful to find a
guitar hero again.
But enough reminiscing.
"Brothers in Arms" is the name of the
latest effort. And the album cover is guilty
of misrepresentation because it features a
large guitar.
Mark Knopfler (and, guilty by associa
tion, keyboardists Guy Fletcher and Alan
Clark, bassist John Illsley, and drummers
Omar Hakim and Terry Williams) has got
it into his head, it appears, that he is a pop
star. With a top-40 voice, a strong synth
beat and bouncy, Huey Lewis lyrics. Here
sarcasm fails me. I can only say it's a ter
rible idea. Whatever happened to the guy
who sang that he "don't give a damn 'bout
any trumpet-playing band ... it ain't what
they call rock 'n' roll"? Sorry, guys, but this
isn't rock 'n' roll either.
"So Far Away," a cut that has received
much airplay on FM stations, is actually
not a bad tune, which is to say there's noth

ing blatantly wrong with it. Unfortunately,
there's nothing blatantly right with it
either. All the elements that made Dire
Straits a great and distinctive band are mis
sing. The sharp, perfectly clean rhythm
chops that provided the structure of clas
sic Knopfler tunes such as "Once Upon a
Time in the West," "Down to the
Waterline" and "Sultans of Swing" are
gone, replaced by a Madonna-esque
keyboard pulse. Even "Love Over Gold,"
the band's most recent record before this
new one, similarly tainted by a
Prophet-5 synthesizer, incorporates some
wonderful guitar, exemplified by the
acoustic melodies on "Telegraph Road."
You'll notice I keep straying back to old
records. Hard to avoid. Like "So Far
Away," none of the other cuts on this al
bum (the other prominent tunes are
"Money for Nothing" and the title cut
"Brothers in Arms") are offensive or
grating. They grate only in that it is almost
conceivable that Knofpler and company
can really not understand that it was
good ol' guitar rock that won the band im
mediate fans among the public and other
musicians. Knopfler, now 36 and a veteran
studio guitarist for many big names (Steely
Dan, most notably) seemed to know at one
time — he made a record, filling it with the
kind of guitar phrasing that originally put
his talents in demand.
Or perhaps he does know, and he just
doesn't care. Studio-schlock can make
anybody's voice sound at least pretty good,
and maybe he figures that's his ticket to the
top 40.
The worst thing of all is that what guitar
playing there is on "Brothers in Arms"
sounds like somebody imitating Carlos
Santana. Almost without exception, the
guitar figures follow a pre-arranged
melody line carefully worked out
beforehand, like the violins in Electric
Light Orchestra songs. It might as well be

another studio guitarist.
And all the side benefits of the first two
or three Dire Straits albums are missing as
well. First among these is the guitar work
of younger brother David Knopfler
(conspicuously missing from this and other
recent records). Another aspect is the won
derfully cliched country-western lyrics
Mark used to work into his tunes. Verses
about tired romance, despondent women,
old clothes and old feelings, are replaced
by inane lines about MTV. Some songs,

like "Why Worry" and "Brothers in
Arms" come close to this lyrical feeling.
But folks, it just ain't the same.
Most bands have to grow, change and
experiment or they become sterile (or
worse) become parodies of themselves.
But Dire Straits' appeal lay in that they
could assure people that they wouldn't
betray their roots.
Guess what happened.

studio guitarist for many big names (Steely
Dan, most notably) seemed to know at one
time — he made a record, filling it with the
kind of guitar phrasing that originally put
his talents in demand.
Or perhaps he does know, and he just
doesn't care. Studio-schlock can make
anybody's voice sound at least pretty good,
and maybe he figures that's his ticket to the
top 40.
The worst thing of all is that what guitar
playing there is on "Brothers in Arms"
sounds like somebody imitating Carlos
Santana. Almost without exception, the
guitar figures follow a pre-arranged
melody line carefully worked out
beforehand, like the violins in Electric
Light Orchestra songs. It might as well be

another studio guitarist.
And all the side benefits of the first two
or three Dire Straits albums are missing as
well. First among these is the guitar work
of younger brother David Knopfler
(conspicuously missing from this and other
recent records). Another aspect is the won
derfully cliched country-western lyrics
Mark used to work into his tunes. Verses
about tired romance, despondent women,
old clothes and old feelings, are replaced
by inane lines about MTV. Some songs,

like "Why Worry" and "Brothers in
Arms" come close to this lyrical feeling.
But folks, it just ain't the same.
Most bands have to grow, change and
experiment or they become sterile (or
worse) become parodies of themselves.
But Dire Straits' appeal lay in that they
could assure people that they wouldn't
betray their roots.
Guess what happened.
