## Football drills to start, frosh report Monday 
### 
Daily staff
The Stanford football team's season will officially
get underway when 19 freshmen scholarship players
report Monday.
Freshman practice begins Tuesday afternoon
after morning physical examinations, and two-a-day
workouts for first-year players begin Wednesday
and continue through Friday. The Cardinal varsity
players report to camp Aug. 24, and the full squad
will work out twice a day from Aug. 26 through
Sept. 7.
Players reporting with the varsity include four
junior college transfers: Tony Leiker, Guy Bunyard,
Rod Shull and Chris Young. Before those four, the
most recent transfer was Pete St. Geme in 1978, the
first time junior college players had been recruited
since the early 19705. Jack Elway, in his second year
at Stanford, often coached JC transfer players at
San Jose State, where he coached from 1979
through 1983.
Among those from last season's 5-6 team who are
not expected to see action are linebacker and most
valuable player David Wyman, who will redshirt
after suffering a serious knee injury against Arizona
last November, and safety Joe Cain, who is
academically ineligible.

The Cardinal opens its season at home against
San Jose State Sept. 14.
Card rowers on national team
A Stanford student and student-to-be who made
the national junior women's crew team earlier this
summer will compete internationally this weekend.
Sophomore Kristin Dahl and freshman-to-be
Jennifer Scotti are two of the 11-woman crew that
will row in the world junior championships this
weekend in Dresden, West Germany.
Dahl, from Greenbrae, and Scotti were selected
earlier this summer from a camp held in Seattle
after the National Women's Rowing Association
championships.
Stanford tennis coach honored
Stanford Women's Tennis Coach Frank Brennan
recently was named Northern California coach of
the year by the United States Professional Tennis
Association.
Brennan coached the Cardinal to the quarter
finals in the NCAA championship in May and to the
national title in 1984. He now is eligible for the
USPTA's national coach of the year award, which
will be announced next month.

Football season is right around the corner, but not for David Wyman,
whose knee injury will keep him off the field. Freshmen report to camp
Monday, and practice begins Tuesday afternoon.
