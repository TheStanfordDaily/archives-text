# USW awaits Stanford reply
## 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
University bargainers met with
representatives of the United
Stanford Workers in the third
round of contract negotiations
Wednesday in a session in which
the union completed its presenta
tion of its proposals.
The aim of the talks is to
negotiate a new, one-year con
tract to replace the one that
expires Aug. 31.
The University did not respond
to the USW proposals or issue its
own counter-proposals, but will
do so at next Wednesday's ses
sion, Michael Vartain, a member
of the University's negotiating
team, said yesterday.
"It was agreed that the union
would have this meeting to
describe its proposals and at the
next meeting the University
would respond, including any rel
evant counter-proposals," said
Vartain, also a University staff at
torney.
But Mary Ann Tenuto, chief
negotiator for the USW,
disagreed with Vartain. "I don't
think it was an understanding,"
she said. "It was a unilateral an
nouncement by Stanford. We had
hoped for a response yesterday,
but we didn't get it."
Tenuto said the University has
had the union's proposals for over
a month now, save for a realign
ment proposal and a minor point,
which were submitted July 31.
The union had a July 12 deadline
for submitting its proposals.
Vartain, however, said that
since the entire package wasn't
received until two weeks ago, it is
unrealistic to expect a University
response. "The second negotiat

ing session (Aug. 7) was the first
one at which we had received all
the union's proposals. That was
our first meeting at which we had
all the proposals, and the union
just finished explaining the
proposals (Wednesday)."
The first session on July 26 was
to discuss procedural matters.
Vartain said, "The University
proposed a meeting the week of
July 27 to Aug. 2, but the union
didn't want to meet."
Both sides hoped to reach an
agreement by the deadline and
discounted the possibility of a
strike. "We would request an ex
tension of the present contract,"
Tenuto said. "We would certainly
not walk out without doing every
thing else in our power."
A major USW proposal states
that union workers would be
given preference over outsiders in
hiring for open jobs.
The proposal says that
"bargaining unit workers shall be
given hiring preference over all
other candidates for open jobs"
in the unit, meaning that laid-off
bargaining unit members would
have first preference and other
members second preference for
open jobs. It also provides that
"there shall be no contracting out
of bargaining unit work, and bar
gaining unit work shall not be
performed by non-bargaining
unit people."
She said she saw no conflict be
tween student jobs and bargain
ing unit work. "Our proposal
would not be aimed at students,"
she said. "Our workers perform
more than 16 hours a week of
work. Our understanding is that
