# Couple visits 'Japanese children'
## 
### REBECCA ZEIGLER Staff writer 
For serving as the family away from home
for over 100 Japanese students visiting Stan
ford in the 19605, Howard and Jeanne Hale
were recently rewarded with a trip back to
Japan for a reunion with their "Japanese
children."
The Hales housed and planned activities for
Keio University students on social and recrea
tional summer exchange programs with Stan
ford in the early '60s. Their involvement
began quite by accident.
From 1960-61, their daughter Sally was the
secretary to the president of the student body
at Stanford and was dating Richard Anderson,
who worked for the Asian desk. Anderson
helped organize the first Stanford-Keio ex
change for the summer of 1961. Six Japanese
students came and stayed with local host
families. Sally Hale spent time with these stu
dents.
At the end of the summer, the host families
for various reasons had to relinquish their
roles while the Japanese students had two
weeks remaining in the area. "Our daughter
asked us if we could take two of the girls,"
said Mrs. Hale. "The next day the other four
showed up, so we kept them all.
"I fell in love with those kids. They were the

nicest young people, so polite. We could
hardly wait until the next summer when we
could be a host family," she continued.
The next summer, in 1962, Sally inter
cepted a cable intended for the head of the
Asian desk, who had left for the summer. Ten
Keio exchange students were on their way to
California via boat. No host families or other
living arrangements had been set up for them.
The Hales ended up running the entire pro
gram that summer, accumulating students
when families couldn't keep them or when
friends of the previous year's students arrived,
and organizing trips and activities. "We got
them a free trip to the Shakespeare Festival in
Ashland, Oregon, free tickets to Giants
games, and took them all camping for a week
at Tahoe," said Mr. Hale.
In 1963, the number of Japanese students
had risen to 27, and there simply were not
enough host families available. The students
were allowed to stay in Stanford dormitories
as long as they audited or took summer school
courses. Since that summer, the program has
become more academically oriented.
The Hales' home remained active
headquarters for the students in 1963, provid
ing a personal and social framework for many
of the students. "If you needed something or
wanted a place to meet someone, you'd go by

the Hales," says Mrs. Hale. "They'd call me
'mother Hale.' "
"I would be just starting dinner, and one of
the students would call and say that he was
lonely. So I'd say, 'Hold on, and I'll come pick
you up, and you can have dinner here with us,'
and undoubtedly four or five others would be
with him," remembered Mrs. Hale. "We fig
ure that about 120 students have stayed with
us for at least one night, some of them for up
to three months. We would tell them that for
as long as they were here, this was their
home."
At the beginning of this year, the Hales had
one of their former students, Eiichi Ishii, visit
ing them. One night he handed them a pair of
plane tickets to Japan and an invitation to
come for a reunion. "It was overwhelming,"
said Mrs. Hale, "like winning a million dollars
in a sweepstakes."
The students had pooled and collected
enough money to finance a 13-day trip to
Japan for them and had planned a very busy
schedule. They stayed in the homes of three
former students and had three large group
reunion parties planned on their behalf.
The Hales had been to Japan before and did
not want to spend their time sightseeing. "We
had no time for sightseeing and
just wanted to visit with our
friends and their families," said
Mr. Hale.
"The funny thing was that
everyone said 'Oh, you must be
tired of Japanese food,' and
would take us somewhere else to
eat. We had so much French
food, and only three Japanese
meals," said Mr. Hale.
At the large reunion, held at
the American Club in Tokyo, all
but one of the former exchange
students were present. "One stu
dent flew back from an assign
ment in France for the reunion,
and two flew back from the other
side of Japan," remarked Mrs.
Hale.
In 1962, while Mrs. Hale was
visiting Japan, the president of
Keio University officially
honored the Hales, who became
the first American family to
receive such an honor.
"I had learned a short thank
you speech in Japanese, but when
it was time to give it, I was in tears
and couldn't remember my
words, " said Mrs. Hale. "All I
could do was blubber. It was so
embarrassing."
The Hales have kept in touch
with their "Japanese children" on
and off since their stays in the
Many of the students have
visited the Hales at their Sunny
vale home.
"They (the Keio students) have
all become extremely successful.
They have lovely families," said
Mrs. Hale. "I've never been so
proud of a group of people in my
life."

secretary to the president of the student body
at Stanford and was dating Richard Anderson,
who worked for the Asian desk. Anderson
helped organize the first Stanford-Keio ex
change for the summer of 1961. Six Japanese
students came and stayed with local host
families. Sally Hale spent time with these stu
dents.
At the end of the summer, the host families
for various reasons had to relinquish their
roles while the Japanese students had two
weeks remaining in the area. "Our daughter
asked us if we could take two of the girls,"
said Mrs. Hale. "The next day the other four
showed up, so we kept them all.
"I fell in love with those kids. They were the

nicest young people, so polite. We could
hardly wait until the next summer when we
could be a host family," she continued.
The next summer, in 1962, Sally inter
cepted a cable intended for the head of the
Asian desk, who had left for the summer. Ten
Keio exchange students were on their way to
California via boat. No host families or other
living arrangements had been set up for them.
The Hales ended up running the entire pro
gram that summer, accumulating students
when families couldn't keep them or when
friends of the previous year's students arrived,
and organizing trips and activities. "We got
them a free trip to the Shakespeare Festival in
Ashland, Oregon, free tickets to Giants
games, and took them all camping for a week
at Tahoe," said Mr. Hale.
In 1963, the number of Japanese students
had risen to 27, and there simply were not
enough host families available. The students
were allowed to stay in Stanford dormitories
as long as they audited or took summer school
courses. Since that summer, the program has
become more academically oriented.
The Hales' home remained active
headquarters for the students in 1963, provid
ing a personal and social framework for many
of the students. "If you needed something or
wanted a place to meet someone, you'd go by

the Hales," says Mrs. Hale. "They'd call me
'mother Hale.' "
"I would be just starting dinner, and one of
the students would call and say that he was
lonely. So I'd say, 'Hold on, and I'll come pick
you up, and you can have dinner here with us,'
and undoubtedly four or five others would be
with him," remembered Mrs. Hale. "We fig
ure that about 120 students have stayed with
us for at least one night, some of them for up
to three months. We would tell them that for
as long as they were here, this was their
home."
At the beginning of this year, the Hales had
one of their former students, Eiichi Ishii, visit
ing them. One night he handed them a pair of
plane tickets to Japan and an invitation to
come for a reunion. "It was overwhelming,"
said Mrs. Hale, "like winning a million dollars
in a sweepstakes."
The students had pooled and collected
enough money to finance a 13-day trip to
Japan for them and had planned a very busy
schedule. They stayed in the homes of three
former students and had three large group
reunion parties planned on their behalf.
The Hales had been to Japan before and did
not want to spend their time sightseeing. "We
had no time for sightseeing and
just wanted to visit with our
friends and their families," said
Mr. Hale.
"The funny thing was that
everyone said 'Oh, you must be
tired of Japanese food,' and
would take us somewhere else to
eat. We had so much French
food, and only three Japanese
meals," said Mr. Hale.
At the large reunion, held at
the American Club in Tokyo, all
but one of the former exchange
students were present. "One stu
dent flew back from an assign
ment in France for the reunion,
and two flew back from the other
side of Japan," remarked Mrs.
Hale.
In 1962, while Mrs. Hale was
visiting Japan, the president of
Keio University officially
honored the Hales, who became
the first American family to
receive such an honor.
"I had learned a short thank
you speech in Japanese, but when
it was time to give it, I was in tears
and couldn't remember my
words, " said Mrs. Hale. "All I
could do was blubber. It was so
embarrassing."
The Hales have kept in touch
with their "Japanese children" on
and off since their stays in the
Many of the students have
visited the Hales at their Sunny
vale home.
"They (the Keio students) have
all become extremely successful.
They have lovely families," said
Mrs. Hale. "I've never been so
proud of a group of people in my
life."
