## Hospital rate increase approved

Daily staff
Stanford's Board of Hospital Directors on Wednesday
approved an overall rate increase averaging 7.9 percent,
according to Sheldon King, executive vice president and
director of the hospital.
The increase, which will take effect Sept. 1, is the small
est in 12 years, he said.
King said the price increases are higher than the general
inflation rate because the medical care market basket — a
version of the Consumer Price Index applied to the cost of
providing medical care — "is always considerably larger."
The 1984 inflation rate as measured by the Consumer
Price Index was 3.6 percent. King estimated that the price

of the medical care market basket increased slightly more
than 8 percent.
Labor, energy and general supplies were cited by King
as sources of increased costs for the hospital.
He said the hospital's rate increase would be small rela
tive to past increases due to an $8.1 million decrease in the
hospital's overhead costs this year. King attributed much
of that decrease to changes in the purchasing of supplies
and services, including volume buying in conjunction with
the University.
One of the most important components of patient
charges is the daily care rate, which varies depending on
the amount of nursing care provided. The most commonly

charged rate for a semi-private room with the
round-the-clock house staff (intern and resident) coverage
will increase from $384 to $414. The rate without house
staff service will be $388.
Rates for another common category, obstetric patients,
will be $389 with housestaff services, $363 without.
Price levels, which include daily rooming costs as well as
all medical and related services, are based on a budget of
$ 196 million. The budget — but not rate increases — must
be submitted for approval to the University Board of
Trustees, meeting as general members of the hospital on
Sept. 10.
