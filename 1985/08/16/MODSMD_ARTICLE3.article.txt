As fall quarter approaches,
students anticipate late nights,
early classes, baggy eyes, un
controllable yawns and perhaps
some untimely dozing.
The chronically sleep-starved
student might seek to cure his
zombie-like state by finding a
sleep schedule that will enhance
his wakeful energies. Students,
though, are not alone in this
quest.
At the Stanford Sleep Camp,
held at Lambda Nu, Profs.
Mary Carskadon and William
Dement head a team of re
searchers studying sleep habits
and needs. These studies exam
ine new and accepted sleep
routines through a series of on
going and short-term experi
ments.
Last summer, Carskadon and
Dement conducted a sleep
restriction study to see if the
body could adjust to having
only five hours of sleep a night.
After seven days, researchers
found their subjects were not
adjusting and, in fact, getting
cumulatively sleepier.
Most people tend to get
about eight hours of sleep a
night; however, findings indi
cate that most people experi
ence a midday "dip," finding
themselves fatigued and often
sluggish after lunch. It was
believed this dip was due to the
meal itself.
However, a study done last
summer at sleep camp dis
proved this idea. Subjects were
kept awake for 38 hours with
regular feedings every two
hours and restricted activity.
Even in this controlled environ
ment, the subjects experienced
