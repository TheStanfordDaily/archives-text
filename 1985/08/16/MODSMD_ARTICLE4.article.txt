# Update
## Botha spurns black franchise 
### 
DURBAN, South Africa —
President Pieter Botha rejected
the one-man, one-vote principle
for South Africa yesterday, and
told his party he would not lead
the country "on a road to abdica
tion and suicide."
Botha said equal voting rights
for all racial groups, including the
24 million blacks who have no
vote at all, "would lead to
domination of one over the
others, and it would lead to
chaos."
"I am not prepared to lead
white South Africans and other
minority groups on a road to ab
dication and suicide," he said.
"Destroy white South Africa and
our influence, and this country
will drift into faction strife, chaos
and poverty."
He indicated no impending
change in the "pass laws" that
restrict where blacks can live and
work.
The president also dashed
speculation that he might free
Nelson Mandela, 67, leader of the
outlawed African National
Congress guerrilla group, who has
been in prison for 21 years after
being convicted of plotting
sabotage.
Botha repeated the offer he
made in February to release Man
dela if he renounced violence,
which Mandela refuses to do, and
quoted portions of the charges
from Mandela's trial that de
scribed his purported plans for
"violent insurrection and rebel
lion."
Before Botha spoke, officials
and news media reported that

police shot and killed four blacks
and a 16-year-old boy was killed
by a hand grenade thrown into
the home of a mixed-race
politician. More than 600 people
have died in a year of violence
against white rule,
Botha addressed the conven
tion of his ruling National Party,
which has been in office since
1948 and devised the apartheid
system of race discrimination that
reserves the best of everything for
South Africa's 5 million whites.
There had been speculation
that the much-heralded speech,
which was televised internation
ally, would announce reforms in
response to the year of riots and
boycotts.
On "influx control," which
restricts rural blacks from migrat
ing to white cities where the jobs
are, Botha said, "I can only say
that the present system is
outdated and too costly," and
that a government commission
will complete a report on possible
changes soon.
Blacks say the most hated
aspect of influx control is the pass
laws requiring them to secure
special permission to work and
live near white areas.
The leader of South Africa's
largest tribe, the 6 million Zulus,
said Botha's speech disappointed
him and he found too little in it to
stem the tide of violence now
sweeping South Africa.
Chief Gatsha Buthelezi, who is
visiting Jerusalem, said he
welcomed the criticism of the pass
laws but was displeased that the
president did not propose "the

participation of black people in |
one government" and agree to
release Mandela unconditionally.
Botha said government funds
would be allocated to improving
underdeveloped black cities and
towns, where black people live in
shacks without plumbing, often a
short distance from the private
swimming pools of privileged
whites.
The president stated anew that
blacks living outside the 10 tribal
homelands "are South African
citizens and should be accom
modated within political institu

tions within the boundaries of the
Republic of South Africa." He
repeated that blacks should be
allowed to own land in urban
areas and not just lease it, as is
now the case.
But he hewed to the long-time
policy of his party that nominally
independent black homelands
"represent a material part of the
solution."
Another idea he rejected was
the concept of a fourth chamber
of Parliament for blacks. The
white Parliament runs the
country, but separate houses with

limited powers were established
last year for ethnic Indians and
people of mixed race, known here
as "coloreds."
He said South Africa's future
must be determined by negotia
tion among all its racial groups.
There are 2.8 million coloreds in
the country and 850,000 ethnic
Indians.
"Reform through process of
negotiation is not weakness.
Talking, consulting, bargaining
with all our people's leaders is not
weakness," he told the members
of his party.
