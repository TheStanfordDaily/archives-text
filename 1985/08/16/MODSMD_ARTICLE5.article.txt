# Administration offers mixed reaction

### 
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Ad
ministration publicly welcomed a speech
by South African President Pieter Botha
on apartheid yesterday as "an important
statement," but privately there was disap
pointment that it failed to signal a rapid
dismantling of segregationist laws.
A top-level administration official,
asked if it was fair to characterize the U.S.
reaction to the speech as
"disappointment," replied, "Yes."
The official, who spoke on condition that
he not be named, voiced the assessment in
Santa Barbara, where President Reagan
has been vacationing at his mountaintop
ranch.
Key members of Congress who favor im
posing mandatory economic sanctions
against South Africa said the speech pro
vided further ammunition for imposing
sanctions because it held out little hope

that South Africa's 24 million blacks will
be given political rights.
The administration had hoped Botha
would signal major changes in apartheid,
and announce an end to the state of emer
gency, giving Reagan some new arguments
for opposing economic sanctions.
A statement read to reporters by Robert
McFarlane, the president's national secur
ity adviser, said, "The South African presi
dent has made an important statement, and
we are studying it carefully. We hope that
the steps President Botha has outlined will
advance the end of apartheid."
But in an NBC interview, McFarlane
said he thought the South African govern
ment should release imprisoned black
leader Nelson Mandela. And he told Cable
News Network he was disappointed that
the state of emergency had not been lifted.
McFarlane met last week in Vienna,

Austria, with South Africa's foreign mini
ster, R.F. Botha, at which he was given a
preview of some of the changes South
Africa was considering.
But McFarlane said he interpreted
Botha's speech as calling for negotiations
on "a new constitutional structure." He
said it also recognizes the principle of par
ticipation for all South Africans in their
government.
"We look for early implementation of
those principles through a process of
negotiation between the South African
government and the leaders of South
Africa's other communities," McFarlane
said.
McFarlane spoke to reporters in Santa
Barbara, where President Reagan is
recovering from his recent cancer surgery.
He said Reagan had approved the state
ment.

Sen. Lowell Weicker (R-Conn.), a co
sponsor of sanctions legislation in the Sen
ate, said the speech was "a vacuous at
tempt to take the world's eye" off the issue
of apartheid.
"I would hope that the Senate's response
would be quick passage of the sanctions bill
and, if needs be, an override of a presiden
tial veto," Weicker said in a statement.
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.)
asserted that Botha "dashed all real hope
that the South African government is ready
to change its racist ways."
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill (D-
Mass.) said in a statement, "This is an em
barrassment for the defenders of
'constructive engagement' " — referring to
the Reagan Administration's term for its
policy of seeking to prod South Africa
toward reform without resorting to sanc
tions.
