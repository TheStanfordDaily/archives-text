Iraq claims hit on Iran oil facility
MANAMA, Bahrain — Iraq said yesterday its jet fighters
demolished Iran's main oil export terminal at Kharg Island in the
northeastern sector of the Persian Gulf.
There was no immediate comment from Iran, and the Iraqi
report could not be verified independently. But maritime ship
ping and salvage executives along the gulf said their radio
monitors had picked up reports from vessels outside the war
zone reporting unusual air activity.
Iran and Iraq have been at war since September 1980.
"Our warplanes struck at 3:15 p.m. (4:15 a.m. PDT) and
turned Kharg into wreckage," a military spokesman in Baghdad
said in an Iraqi News Agency dispatch monitored in Bahrain.
Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, contacted by
telex from Nicosia, Cyprus, said it had no knowledge of the pur
ported raid.
"One vessel radioed messages of unusual activity in the air
near the heavily fortified Kharg Island," said one marine salvage
executive, who spoke yesterday on condition he not be identified.
"But it is too early for us to say with certainty that Kharg proper
has been raided."
In Washington the report was received with skepticism at the
State Department. An official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said he doubted the terminal had been blown up,
"based on the solidarity of the defenses."
The U.S. official said there was no confirmation from Ameri
can officials in the region and"I wouldn't hold my breath"
waiting for it.
Iraq has vowed repeatedly to choke off Iran's economy by
blocking its crude-oil exports and has wrecked scores of oil
tankers and bulk carriers near Kharg and other Iranian ports on
the gulf.
Iraq says most of the hard cash in Iran's war chest comes from
oil exports.
Meanwhile, Iran said its forces shot down an "intruding" Iraqi
war plane yesterday in the northern gulf.
IRNA, the official news agency, quoted an Iranian joint staff
communique issued in Tehran as saying the Iraqi jet was shot
down by ground-to-air missiles.
There was speculation that the report, which gave no further
details, confirmed the attack on Kharg Island.
Bombs hit U.S. radio tower
MOENCHENGLADBACH, West Germany — Two bombs
exploded near an Armed Forces Radio network tower yesterday,
causing damage but no injuries, police said. It was the third at
tack against U.S. forces in a week.
Police spokesman Wolfgang Ludwig said indications are the
attack was carried out by sympathizers of the Red Army Faction,
but no one claimed responsibility.
"Damage was minimal. It (the tower) moved about three feet
from its base," said Col. Sonny Craven, head of the network. He
said the 195-foot tower was expected to be functional again "in a
couple of days."
Two "incendiary devices" were also found near the tower, in
the western city of Moenchengladbach near Duesseldorf, said
Capt. Albert Thomas, spokesman for the nearby U.S. military
community of Rheinberg. He did not elaborate.
The network, which primarily provides entertainment for U.S.
military personnel in Western Europe, went off the air in the
area, Thomas said.
Meanwhile, police said yesterday that one of West Germany's
most wanted terrorists is believed to have bought the automobile
used in last week's deadly bombing of a U.S. Air Force base.
The federal police said they had identified the likely buyer of
the Volkswagen sedan as Sigrid Sternebeck, 36, who has been
sought since 1977. She is named in an arrest warrant for involve
ment in crimes committed by the leftist Red Army Faction,
police said.
Pope pardons martyr's killer
KINSHASA, Zaire — Pope John Paul II yesterday proclaimed
a 25-year-old nun black Africa's first woman martyr of the
Roman Catholic Church, and publicly forgave the soldier who
killed her when she resisted his rape attempt.
The pope, on the eighth day of his 12-day African tour,
beatified Sister Anuarite Nengapeta before Zairean President
Mobutu Sese Seko and 60,000 people at an outdoor Mass.
Beatification is an important step toward sainthood.
The pope, referring to yesterday's church feast of the Assump
tion of the Virgin Mary, said, "On this happy occasion when we
celebrate the glory of the Virgin Mary, the church solemnly
proclaims her daughter, Mary Clementine Anuarite, as blessed, a
martyr of the the faith among you."
Diverting from his prepared text, the pope referred to
Anuarite's convicted killer, former Col. Pierre Openge Olombe,
who had asked in vain to meet the pope to express remorse.
"I myself, in the name of the whole church, forgive (him) with
all my heart," John Paul said.
Church officials said John Paul turned down Olombe's request
for a meeting, which apparently was inspired by the pope's face
to-face 1983 pardon of his would-be Turkish assassin, Mehmet
Ali Agca.
Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said Olombe was refused
because he requested the audience through a newspaper editor
who interviewed him, rather than writing to the pope. But an
other high Vatican official, who spoke on condition he not be
identified, said one factor was that Olombe was regarded as un
stable.

can officials in the region and"I wouldn't hold my breath"
waiting for it.
Iraq has vowed repeatedly to choke off Iran's economy by
blocking its crude-oil exports and has wrecked scores of oil
tankers and bulk carriers near Kharg and other Iranian ports on
the gulf.
Iraq says most of the hard cash in Iran's war chest comes from
oil exports.
Meanwhile, Iran said its forces shot down an "intruding" Iraqi
war plane yesterday in the northern gulf.
IRNA, the official news agency, quoted an Iranian joint staff
communique issued in Tehran as saying the Iraqi jet was shot
down by ground-to-air missiles.
There was speculation that the report, which gave no further
details, confirmed the attack on Kharg Island.
Bombs hit U.S. radio tower
MOENCHENGLADBACH, West Germany — Two bombs
exploded near an Armed Forces Radio network tower yesterday,
causing damage but no injuries, police said. It was the third at
tack against U.S. forces in a week.
Police spokesman Wolfgang Ludwig said indications are the
attack was carried out by sympathizers of the Red Army Faction,
but no one claimed responsibility.
"Damage was minimal. It (the tower) moved about three feet
from its base," said Col. Sonny Craven, head of the network. He
said the 195-foot tower was expected to be functional again "in a
couple of days."
Two "incendiary devices" were also found near the tower, in
the western city of Moenchengladbach near Duesseldorf, said
Capt. Albert Thomas, spokesman for the nearby U.S. military
community of Rheinberg. He did not elaborate.
The network, which primarily provides entertainment for U.S.
military personnel in Western Europe, went off the air in the
area, Thomas said.
Meanwhile, police said yesterday that one of West Germany's
most wanted terrorists is believed to have bought the automobile
used in last week's deadly bombing of a U.S. Air Force base.
The federal police said they had identified the likely buyer of
the Volkswagen sedan as Sigrid Sternebeck, 36, who has been
sought since 1977. She is named in an arrest warrant for involve
ment in crimes committed by the leftist Red Army Faction,
police said.
Pope pardons martyr's killer
KINSHASA, Zaire — Pope John Paul II yesterday proclaimed
a 25-year-old nun black Africa's first woman martyr of the
Roman Catholic Church, and publicly forgave the soldier who
killed her when she resisted his rape attempt.
The pope, on the eighth day of his 12-day African tour,
beatified Sister Anuarite Nengapeta before Zairean President
Mobutu Sese Seko and 60,000 people at an outdoor Mass.
Beatification is an important step toward sainthood.
The pope, referring to yesterday's church feast of the Assump
tion of the Virgin Mary, said, "On this happy occasion when we
celebrate the glory of the Virgin Mary, the church solemnly
proclaims her daughter, Mary Clementine Anuarite, as blessed, a
martyr of the the faith among you."
Diverting from his prepared text, the pope referred to
Anuarite's convicted killer, former Col. Pierre Openge Olombe,
who had asked in vain to meet the pope to express remorse.
"I myself, in the name of the whole church, forgive (him) with
all my heart," John Paul said.
Church officials said John Paul turned down Olombe's request
for a meeting, which apparently was inspired by the pope's face
to-face 1983 pardon of his would-be Turkish assassin, Mehmet
Ali Agca.
Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said Olombe was refused
because he requested the audience through a newspaper editor
who interviewed him, rather than writing to the pope. But an
other high Vatican official, who spoke on condition he not be
identified, said one factor was that Olombe was regarded as un
stable.
