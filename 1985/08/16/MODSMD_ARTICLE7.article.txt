AIDS vaccine elusive
WASHINGTON — The virus suspected of
causing AIDS has so many variations in its ge
netic structure that developing a preventive
vaccine against the disease may prove very diffi
cult, if it can be done at all, researchers said yes
terday.
Scientists at the National Cancer Institute said
they looked at the suspect virus found in 18
patients with AIDS or at high risk of getting the
disease, and that each isolated virus showed a dif
ferent variation in its genetic structure.
The findings, to be published today in the jour
nal Science, mean that it could be difficult to find
a common site on the viruses that can be targeted
for preventive and therapeutic measures, they
said.
To develop a vaccine, researchers say they
need to find a common protein region, preserved
in all variations of the virus, that triggers an im
munologic response.
If the body has been previously primed to
produce antibodies to this area, such as through
vaccination with the protein produced by the tar
geted genetic region, then it may be possible for
people to resist the virus when they come in con
tact with it.
Drs. Flossie Wong-Staal, Robert Gallo,
Mikulas Popovic and colleagues at the institute
also said there was no distinct viral pattern found
in patients with actual acquired disease immunity
syndrome as opposed to those with a similar im
munity disorder called AIDS-related complex or
those who were viral carriers without any disease
symptoms.
Jaw says apes from Asia
LOS ANGELES — A new analysis of a piece
of fossilized jaw from a 40-million-year-old
primate in Burma has added support to the con
troversial theory that the ancestors of apes,
monkeys and humans originated in Asia, rather
than Africa.
"We can now say that the origin of higher
primates was very probably an Asian event," said
Russell Ciochon, a paleontologist, in a telephone
interview from the anatomy department at the
State University of New York at Stony Brook.
Ciochon said his analysis of the jaw fragment
of Amphipithecus mogaungensis shows that the
animal is the earliest known higher primate. The

fragment was found by Burmese scientists in
1978.
"Amphipithecus (which means 'near ape") oc
cupies a position as the ancestor of all living
monkeys, apes and humans . . . and can be
viewed as a 'missing link' between lower and
higher primates," he said.
Other scientists disagreed with Ciochon's con
clusion that human ancestors originated in Asia.
"It's important work, there's no question about
that," said John Van Couvering, a fossil expert at
New York's American Museum of Natural His
tory. "Until last year, he might have carried the
field with his argument, but it's no longer open
and shut. There's good evidence we can still see
Africa as the [site of] the origin of higher
primates."
Van Couvering said African primate fossils
found in the Fayum region south of Cairo, Egypt,
are at least as old as those in Burma — support
ing the view the higher primates originated in
Africa.
Quotas rescission proposed
WASHINGTON — Civil rights and labor
groups yesterday sharply criticized a Reagan Ad
ministration draft proposal to abolish require
ments that businesses with government contracts
set numerical goals for hiring women and
minorities.
The draft proposal circulated on Capitol Hill
and among civil rights groups, as well as within
the administration, would rescind much of Exec
utive Order 11426, signed by President Lyndon
Johnson in 1965.
Government sources said the draft revision of
the order, which had gone virtually undisturbed
through the administrations of Richard Nixon,
Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, was prepared for
President Reagan's consideration.
At a news briefing in Santa Barbara, White
House spokesman Larry Speakes said the pro
posal had not yet been taken up by the Cabinet
Council on Domestic Policy and "therefore, it
has no standing whatsoever as administration
policy."
Speakes said Reagan has indicated many times
that he "opposes discrimination in all forms," in
cluding the practices of government contractors.
But at the same time, the spokesman said,
Reagan "opposes numerical quotas as a means
for achieving equality."
