## The 						Stanford Daily Botha falls short 
### 
Like nearly everyone else, we have condemned the cur
rent system of apartheid in South Africa and called for
change. We have also called the Reagan Administration's
current policy of constructive engagement toward that gov
ernment ineffective and insufficient.
Some events last week made us question that assessment.
National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane and other ad
ministration officials met with South African Foreign Mini
ster R.F. Botha in Vienna, Austria. There was speculation
that the talks were a prelude to a statement to be made this
week by President P.W. Botha that would announce
reforms of the present system.
While we sincerely doubted the effectiveness of con
structive engagement, these talks gave us new hope that
perhaps we were wrong, perhaps constructive engagement
could work. We didn't expect that, but we were willing to
await President Botha's speech, hoping we would have to
retract every statement we had made criticizing con
structive engagement.
We don't have to. Botha yesterday rejected the principle
of one man, one vote. He rejected changes in the "pass
laws" that restrict the movement of blacks in their own
country. He rejected freeing Nelson Mandela, the leader of
the African National Congress who has been imprisoned
for 21 years. He rejected South African citizenship for
blacks his government regards as citizens of nominally in
dependent "tribal homelands."
Botha did call for negotiations between all racial groups
to determine South Africa's future. This is a welcome step.
Negotiation is obviously preferable to violence and revolu
tion, but only if it achieves democracy in South Africa. In
light of Botha's rejections yesterday, we question whether
the current government will bargain away its privileged po
sition unless forced to do so.
We had hoped yesterday's announcement would prove
the supporters of constructive engagement right and prove
us wrong. We must now again, pragmatically, call on the
administration to increase pressure on South Africa, to ap
prove economic sanctions set to pass Congress and to
reconsider its veto in the United Nations of compulsory
sanctions against South Africa.
