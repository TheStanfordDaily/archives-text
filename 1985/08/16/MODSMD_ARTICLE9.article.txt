# '80's to SOSA: Who cares?
## 
### 
One of the things everyone seemed to be talking
about last spring was the possible return of 1960s
style student activism. Much was made of the idea
that the activities of Stanford Out of South Africa
(SOSA) might mark the beginning of this return, or
the beginnings of a change of heart in students who
were considered, for the most part, to be self
interested, materialistic and apathetic. It is just this
association with the attitudes and tactics of the 60s,
however, that doomed SOSA and led it to such a
swift and resounding defeat.
SOSA really had only one thing going against
them, at least at the outset: the average age of its
members. The youth of the overwhelming majority
of the people participating in SOSA rallies placed
them almost a full generation apart from the stu
dents of the '60s. Their background and upbringing,
and, hence , many of their attitudes, are quite differ
ent from those of a student 20 years ago. Also, most
of the protesters were somewhere between the ages
of four and 10 when the campuses of the country
suddenly became focal points of unrest, so the sort
of thing SOSA was doing was all new to them. This
unfamiliarity put them at a considerable disadvan
tage to University President Donald Kennedy and
his administration, many of whom were at Stanford
or other universities during the '60s and who, ap
parently, learned some valuable lessons about
dealing with student protests.
For somebody growing up in the '40s and '50s, se
curity was something of a given. With the possible
exception of bomb shelters and civil defense drills in
school, a child of the times could count on his soci
ety to be relatively safe and stable, just as the tradi
tional values could be counted upon to keep him
reasonably well pacified. When these children of the
'40s and '50s grew up to become the students of the
'60s, perhaps it was some combination of dissatis
faction with their society and the security associated
with it and the fact that they had little comprehen
sion of what it might be like to live in a state of anx
iety that allowed these students to forego the secure
old values and pursue more radical politics and tac
tics.
For a person growing up in the '60s and '70s, on
the other hand, a sense of security was absent. Viet
nam, Kent State, the rising divorce rate and the
sexual revolution undermined many of the tradi
tions and institutions of our society and left the child
of the '60s and '70s without anything to give him a
sense of security. The very thing that many of the

students of the '80s seem to be looking for is the se
curity they never had in their childhood. They want
careers, they want a steady supply of money and
they do not want anything associated with the '60s,
or anybody whom they perceive as an agent of ran
dom and capricious change, invading their lives.
SOSA seems to have failed to account for this dif
ference in attitude. It is tempting to write these stu
dents off as selfish pre-yuppies, but unfortunately
for SOSA, they are the mainstream, and SOSA
desperately needs mainstream support. "Marxism-
Leninism," and the chanting of slogans only serves
to alienate students who would otherwise support
the anti-apartheid movement, but who are excep
tionally wary of anything that smacks of radicalism.

Kennedy's administration, on the other hand, was
probably delighted and relieved to see that SOSA
had decided to emulate its predecessors of the '60s.
President Kennedy apparently learned in the '60s
that the quickest way to kill the momentum of a stu
dent movement is not to use force or become
outraged, but to meet it with as great a display of ut
ter indifference as possible. Few things will extin
guish the fire beneath a protester faster than the
knowledge that those people in the administration
building are not bothered by their rhetoric or their
chants or their signs, and wouldn't particularly care
if they sat out in the Quad permanently.
It was sad to see the Quad finally empty out as
SOSA withered away and died last spring. One
would hope that if they are able to recover from
their disasterous first efforts they might consider
modernizing arid changing their tactics. Plans such
as the promise to withhold any alumni donations
after graduation unless the University divests may
have been a step in the right direction. If I still tell
people that I think SOSA will fail, I can only add
that I would welcome being proven wrong.
