Preparation for
October 19 GMAT
The Program's class for the October 19 GMAT starts August 22 and offers
32 to 36 hours of instruction in weekly meetings, most of which will be held
on Tuesday or Thursday evenings on campus.
All curricular preparation, instruction, and review are carried out by a former
Stanford faculty member who has prepared students for the GMAT since
1979. Enrollment is limited to 15 students. Your work will be individually re
viewed on a weekly basis by the instructor. The median score of all students
taking the program in the 1983-84 year was 680, 98th percentile, and forty
percent of the October 1984 class was accepted by Stanford and/or Har
vard. The fee is $325.
There is still room in the class preparing students for the October 5 LSAT.
