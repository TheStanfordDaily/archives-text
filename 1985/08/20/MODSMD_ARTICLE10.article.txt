Supervisors pass SF plan
SAN FRANCISCO — A plan to shape the
future of the city's business district was
tentatively approved yesterday by the Board of
Supervisors, with a bare majority committed to
what opponents say will amount to the
"Manhattanization" of San Francisco.
The 199-page Downtown Plan zoning or
dinance passed the board 6-5, but supervisors
amended it with a "sunset clause" requiring
reassessment and approval of the plan in three
years.
The plan now goes back to the County Plan
ning Commission for hearings and will return to
the supervisors for a final vote Sept. 10.
Authored mainly by city Planning Director
Dean Macris and supported by Mayor Dianne
Feinstein, the plan holds annual office growth to
950,000 square feet.
Supervisor Richard Hongisto, an opponent of
the measure, has called it the "Manhattan Plan,"
warning that it will result in the further gentrifica
tion of the city's lower-income neighborhoods.
The plan would permit another 14.2 million
square feet of office construction by the year
2000, equivalent to about 50 medium-sized tow
ers.
Official OKs AIDS masks
SAN FRANCISCO — Nurses at a San Fran
cisco hospital who want to wear masks while
treating AIDS patients got a boost yesterday
from a top state job-safety official, who said
masks aren't needed medically but should be
allowed if nurses want them.
"As a health scientist, I wouldn't agree" that
nurses need masks to protect themselves, said Dr.
Lawrence Rose, chief of the medical section in
the state Division of Occupational Safety and
Health, at a hearing on the nurses' complaints.
Four nurses at San Francisco General Hospital

have charged job discrimination, saying they
were reprimanded and in several cases threat
ened with firing for insisting on wearing masks
while in rooms with patients suffering from ac
quired immune deficiency syndrome.
According to documents quoted by several wit
nesses, the reason for the policy was that masks
are not medically necessary and might offend
AIDS patients.
49ers, Feinstein ink pact
SAN FRANCISCO — The San Francisco
49ers and Mayor Dianne Feinstein announced an
agreement yesterday on a $30 million plan to ex
pand and renovate Candlestick Park, keeping the
world champion football team there until past the
turn of the century.
Both the 49ers and San Francisco Giants had
threatened to abandon Candlestick, which 49ers
owner Edward Deßartolo Jr. once called a
"pigsty."
The pact must be approved by the Board of Su
pervisors. It would keep the 49ers at Candlestick
until 2008, with an option to stay until 2023.
Feinstein, Supervisor Quentin Kopp and
Deßartolo were among those who signed the
agreement at a news conference before last
night's Denver Broncos-49ers game.
"It's very good for the city and very good for
the 49ers. It will help us keep a competitive team
on the field," Deßartolo said. "We will actively
promote and try to get a Super Bowl for Candles
tick."
The plan calls for 9,250 new seats, bringing the
stadium's football capacity to 71,000, but the $6
million cost of installing those seats will be paid
through a $160 surcharge on season-ticket
holders' $200 tickets.
The surcharge on season tickets was proposed
because "the general public isn't going to have to
pay so football fans can enjoy games at Candles
tick."
