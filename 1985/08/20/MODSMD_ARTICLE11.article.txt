## The 						Stanford Daily As summer sets 
### 
Ah, summer. And what a summer it was at Stanford.
Laughter, thrills, excitement — you hardly even missed
them.
Here in California one has to look at a calendar to know
when summer ends. But despite the lack of a significant
weather change, there's still an intuition, a feeling, a fra
grance to the air which suggests that the sewer leakage un
der White Plaza hasn't been fixed yet.
Summer is for beaches and sun on sunny faces and an op
portunity to distance oneself from the rat race of work or
school (not always mutually exclusive).
What, then; is the difference between summer and
summer? During summer the food is better (it's not food
service). The days are longer. Skirts are shorter.
This has been a fairly active summer, actually — the
Page Mill fire, the Coffee House saga, Stanford's involve
ment with the space shuttle, the SOSA convictions, the
Playboy flier — all sorts of keen stuff. The Daily Terror
softball team actually won for the first time in six months of
intramural competition.
For college students, summer doesn't mean what it used
to. Back when we were young we'd eagerly await the last
day of school, and when the glorious day actually arrived,
take home all our artwork in a big folder and throw it away.
Then we watched cartoons, quickly got bored and wished
for school to begin again.
Now summers become months of opportunity. Work.
Money. Resumes. More free time to worry. So now we go
to work, quickly get bored and wait for schooi to start
again.
But what if — oh no — you actually graduated in June?
Then, according to age-old tradition, you're spending the
summer in Europe with a buddy, getting in and out of tight
situations, sending your mother a postcard with an arrow
pointing toward your hotel room window and not reading
this editorial. "The pizza here is bad," you write. "Send
more money."
Many people, sad to say, feel they're missing out because
their summers aren't similar to the summers people on TV
have. Or in the movies. Or just about anywhere except
where they are. But wait — do you think Frankie and An
nette ever laughed off camera? Actually they did, but they
were on special medication.
So that's it. Our final editorial. Until the fall, when there
will be more.
