There's just a song in all the trouble and the strife
You do the walk, yeah, you do the walk of life

What is a valuable thought? Suppose you re
driving along with a friend; you're looking-for a
quick bite, so you say, "Hey, how 'bout a 'za? If he
or she replies, "Wouldn't it be weird if all Russians
were forced to wear Hawaiian shirts?" most of you
would probably respond, "My, that was a quite
valuable thought." But a few of you would continue
with your friend's line and develop it into a serious,
if ridiculous, conversation; it's all just a matter of
scope.
Some demand "Why don't you write about some
thing valuable, like South Africa?" I suppose I
could write "Botha's government should form a lim
ited partnership with a consortium of minority
leaders evolving to full black rule," but 1 won't. I
would get to the second sentence and start laughing.
Words! They're only goddamn words; they're
meant to be fun. They're meant to talk about more
basic —

SOMEBODY MUST DIE! Painfully.
Slowly. . . . THINK! USE the pathetic excuse of a
column to plan . . . get an idea yet? Better than
buying an Uzi and going door-to-door like an acid
filled Avon lady?
Yeah, much, much better; this miserable column is
a biochemist; let's look at what it knows. Consider
the virus. It's just a tiny piece of matter, a few
hundred nucleic acid (the same stuff DNA's made
of) residues surrounded by a protein coat. Nobody
knows if it's alive in the traditional sense of that
word. But it can attack living cells and penetrate cell
membranes. It can take over cells' replication ma
chinery. Thus it can make cells produce not what the
cells originally intended, but instead produce
thousands of copies of the invading virus!
Ingenious. But what does this matter to me?
Viruses, while tiny, are like computers. They have
a programmed function (attack, conquer, multiply)
and they perform it with a fair amount of efficiency.
Now the state of computer science at present is such
that scientists are trying to create an "artificial intelli
gence"; that is, simply put, a machine which can re

member an experience and can use this memory to
plan future action: it learns.
So what?
So what? You're no better than the column! Let
the virus be the machine. We can make an artificial
virus, one which is normal in every respect save one:
It can learn.
I see! A learning virus can protect a small core of
people. Suppose you infect yourself and you get the
equivalent of a bad cold. You acquire immunity to
the virus because your body builds up specific an
tibodies which will recognize the virus the second
time around and destroy it. Then I transmit the virus

to a friend, say, and the virus is a little more
knowledgable about human anatomy and immunol
ogy. So my friend's body will have a harder time
struggling against the bug, but eventually, he wins
and acquires immunity and passes it on to the next
person -
Who nearly dies. By the fourth generation, then, it
will be fatal. We can control the virus's virulence, its
deadliness, by giving the correct number of people
first generation bugs. Say, how many people do you
meet in a day?
I don't know. Since viruses are pretty tough suck
ers, they can live almost anywhere for a while. So
anything I touch or even the air I exhale contains
bugs . . . maybe 500 people then.
If we make the incubation period 24 hours, then,
after three generations . . . that's 125,000,000
people, about half the population of the United
States. Not bad for a start.
No, not bad at all! It's a SPLENDID idea! And
THAT'LL pay back EVERYONE for every
transgression against ME!
YA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA !
McCall: What's he saying? Is he supposed to be
gibbering like that?
Romerein: That biscuit's just drooling at his ter
minal. Switch him off.
Highfill (authoritatively): All right, that's it, then,
no more columns.

Who nearly dies. By the fourth generation, then, it
will be fatal. We can control the virus's virulence, its
deadliness, by giving the correct number of people
first generation bugs. Say, how many people do you
meet in a day?
I don't know. Since viruses are pretty tough suck
ers, they can live almost anywhere for a while. So
anything I touch or even the air I exhale contains
bugs . . . maybe 500 people then.
If we make the incubation period 24 hours, then,
after three generations . . . that's 125,000,000
people, about half the population of the United
States. Not bad for a start.
No, not bad at all! It's a SPLENDID idea! And
THAT'LL pay back EVERYONE for every
transgression against ME!
YA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA !
McCall: What's he saying? Is he supposed to be
gibbering like that?
Romerein: That biscuit's just drooling at his ter
minal. Switch him off.
Highfill (authoritatively): All right, that's it, then,
no more columns.
