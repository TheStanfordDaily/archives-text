Post Office closes
a little too soon
I went to the Stanford Post
Office in the afternoon of Aug.
15, to use its services. I arrived at
4:58 p.m., only to find the
"Closed" sign on, and the door
locked. As a patron was leaving,
I tried to tell the person in
charge of the door that I thought
I should still be let in at that
time, to which that person raised
his arm in the direction of the
clock tower, and proclaimed that,
since the clock had just struck 5,
and the station clock also showed
5, it was past 5 p.m. When I tried
to argue that the clock at the
clock tower is three minutes fast
with respect to Pacific Daylight
Time, as is easily verifiable, I was
rudely pushed out of the way,
almost physically threatened, at

which point I realized that it was
useless to insist.
I do not know if this instance
of closing before due time of the
Stanford Post Office, and thus
the resulting incident, results
from an official policy of its man
agement, or from the (perhaps
unconscious) desire of one of its
employees to get his kicks by
arbitrary use of the power
endowed to him. I know,
however, that in either case such
a situation is unacceptable and
that the management of the
Stanford Post Office should take
steps to prevent incidents of this
kind, which only serve to
generate unnecessary confronta
tion and aggravation, from hap
pening in the future.
