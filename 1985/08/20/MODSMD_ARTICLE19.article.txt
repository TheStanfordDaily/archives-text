# Spielberg a bit off-balance with' Goonies'
## 
### RON CHRISLEY 
After seeing "E.T.," "Raiders
of the Lost Ark," "Close
Encounters" (five times) and now
"The Goonies," I feel I'm getting
to know Steven Spielberg pretty
well.
Maybe too well.
It's as if his movie-making style
and my sense of film appreciation
are lovers that once enjoyed an
exuberant fling, but have now
become uncomfortably familiar.
Even though he is not the ac
tual director of the film, the
screenplay is Spielberg's, and his
influence obviously dominates
the film. And with "Goonies,"
Spielberg constantly tries to
arouse me with techniques that
once excited me: wide-eyed
depictions of boyhood fantasy,
thrills-and-spills chase scenes,
and almost dream-like settings.
But all this gets old after a
while — the same stock charac
ters, hokey plots, predictable
camera angles, etc. There is no
longer any spontaneity in our re
lationship. It just isn't the same to
go into a dark movie theater with
Steve anymore.
Sure, it's still fun. But it's mis
sing that spark of excitement, of
freshness.
There must be someone else,
another lover — money, fame.
That's what cheapens our rela
tionship. I used to believe that he
made movies only to please me,
but maybe while I thought this, all
he was seeing was dollar signs.
Whine, whine, whine. End of
nifty "dissatisfied lover" analogy.
But it isn't merely a preoccupa
tion with Spielberg cliches that
causes me to be almost sub
consciously disturbed by
"Goonies." It's also the film's
schizophrenia — I can't figure out
what type of movie it is supposed
to be.
This reaction is not just a film
critic's frustration with a movie
that defies categorization. I actu
ally delight in films that elude my
conceptual snares and pigeonhol
ing. It's the fact that "Goonies"
does this, not through the
legitimate channels of artistic
creativity and innovation, but
through its neurotic nature. It
leaves me disoriented, but not
wonderously so.

The term "Goonies" itself
refers to a motley bunch of
youngsters who are daringly com
peting with some criminals in the
pursuit of a legendary pirate
hoard. Gleaning this much from
the ads and trailers, and noting
that the film was supposedly in
spired by the "Pirates of the Car
ribean" ride at Disneyland (how
Spielberg can you get?), the film
appears to be a children's
comedy-adventure. Much of the
movie is indeed filled with child
ish slapstick humor and is of a
tone that appeals most to pre
adolescents.
The movie is oddly self
referential in this regard when
one of the two older girls says to
the other, "This is ridiculous. I
feel like I'm babysitting without
getting paid."
Me too, kid.
OK, OK, I can still enjoy a
kid's show. It will be light, funny
and leave me feeling refreshed,

just like Disney used to, right?
Let's put it this way: When the
film opens with the gory visual
image of a man who has hung
himself, one begins to wonder
whether this is suitable material
for young, impressionable minds.
And all is not forgiven when the
"dead" man violently awakens to
strike down a prison warden.
This fascination with "humor"
of the blackest sort is also
manifested in a young boy's dis
turbing bout with an off-balance
corpse while locked in a freezer.
Definite nightmare material.
Who's off-balance here? The
corpse, the man who created him
or the people laughing at all of
this? I say the movie is, at least.
But this is merely an extension
of the dark side of Spielberg's
playfulness that was revealed
when "Gremlins" was released. I
appreciated then, as I do now, the
freshness of such a novelty ap
pearing in a feature film. But I

resented the sneaky, irresponsible
way in which Steven tricked his
audiences into exposing them
selves to this comic grimness.
People will sense the dishonesty
in "Goonies" just as they did with
"Gremlins."
Other significant portions of
the film's humor were of dubious
taste. In one scene, one of the
Goonies, a rascal named
"Mouth," volunteers to
"interpret" for the new Spanish
maid as the mistress of the house
explains the domestic duties.
Of course, the trouble-maker
has no intention of translating
faithfully, and we see his lewd,
demeaning and threatening
"translations" in English subtitles
as the maid looks at her innocent
employer in horror. The
stereotypical character of the
maid is more disturbing than what
Mouth says, in that it calls atten
tion to the predominance of
stereotypes and stock characters

throughout the movie.
There are other instances of
questionable humor involving
fumbling with the genitals of a
"David" statuette and looking
down girls' shirts. But these need
only be mentioned to make it
clear that this is not ostensibly a
children's movie. Someone is
trying to bridge the gap between
G and R audiences to create a
larger market, but the result is
going to disappoint one or the
other age group. And it will do so
by being offensive.
Don't get me wrong — I find a
perverse delight in"The
Goonies." But I feel it's my duty
to tell you that although I enjoyed
the movie, it was in a way that it
wasn't intended to be enjoyed
and in a way few will — as an
aberration, a curiosity. Some
one's got to tell you that some
thing underhanded, almost
diabolical, is going on here.
Steven certainly won't.

appears to be a children's
comedy-adventure. Much of the
movie is indeed filled with child
ish slapstick humor and is of a
tone that appeals most to pre
adolescents.
The movie is oddly self
referential in this regard when
one of the two older girls says to
the other, "This is ridiculous. I
feel like I'm babysitting without
getting paid."
Me too, kid.
OK, OK, I can still enjoy a
kid's show. It will be light, funny
and leave me feeling refreshed,

just like Disney used to, right?
Let's put it this way: When the
film opens with the gory visual
image of a man who has hung
himself, one begins to wonder
whether this is suitable material
for young, impressionable minds.
And all is not forgiven when the
"dead" man violently awakens to
strike down a prison warden.
This fascination with "humor"
of the blackest sort is also
manifested in a young boy's dis
turbing bout with an off-balance
corpse while locked in a freezer.
Definite nightmare material.
Who's off-balance here? The
corpse, the man who created him
or the people laughing at all of
this? I say the movie is, at least.
But this is merely an extension
of the dark side of Spielberg's
playfulness that was revealed
when "Gremlins" was released. I
appreciated then, as I do now, the
freshness of such a novelty ap
pearing in a feature film. But I

resented the sneaky, irresponsible
way in which Steven tricked his
audiences into exposing them
selves to this comic grimness.
People will sense the dishonesty
in "Goonies" just as they did with
"Gremlins."
Other significant portions of
the film's humor were of dubious
taste. In one scene, one of the
Goonies, a rascal named
"Mouth," volunteers to
"interpret" for the new Spanish
maid as the mistress of the house
explains the domestic duties.
Of course, the trouble-maker
has no intention of translating
faithfully, and we see his lewd,
demeaning and threatening
"translations" in English subtitles
as the maid looks at her innocent
employer in horror. The
stereotypical character of the
maid is more disturbing than what
Mouth says, in that it calls atten
tion to the predominance of
stereotypes and stock characters

throughout the movie.
There are other instances of
questionable humor involving
fumbling with the genitals of a
"David" statuette and looking
down girls' shirts. But these need
only be mentioned to make it
clear that this is not ostensibly a
children's movie. Someone is
trying to bridge the gap between
G and R audiences to create a
larger market, but the result is
going to disappoint one or the
other age group. And it will do so
by being offensive.
Don't get me wrong — I find a
perverse delight in"The
Goonies." But I feel it's my duty
to tell you that although I enjoyed
the movie, it was in a way that it
wasn't intended to be enjoyed
and in a way few will — as an
aberration, a curiosity. Some
one's got to tell you that some
thing underhanded, almost
diabolical, is going on here.
Steven certainly won't.

After seeing "E.T.," "Raiders
of the Lost Ark," "Close
Encounters" (five times) and now
"The Goonies," I feel I'm getting
to know Steven Spielberg pretty
well.
Maybe too well.
It's as if his movie-making style
and my sense of film appreciation
are lovers that once enjoyed an
exuberant fling, but have now
become uncomfortably familiar.
Even though he is not the ac
tual director of the film, the
screenplay is Spielberg's, and his
influence obviously dominates
the film. And with "Goonies,"
Spielberg constantly tries to
arouse me with techniques that
once excited me: wide-eyed
depictions of boyhood fantasy,
thrills-and-spills chase scenes,
and almost dream-like settings.
But all this gets old after a
while — the same stock charac
ters, hokey plots, predictable
camera angles, etc. There is no
longer any spontaneity in our re
lationship. It just isn't the same to
go into a dark movie theater with
Steve anymore.
Sure, it's still fun. But it's mis
sing that spark of excitement, of
freshness.
There must be someone else,
another lover — money, fame.
That's what cheapens our rela
tionship. I used to believe that he
made movies only to please me,
but maybe while I thought this, all
he was seeing was dollar signs.
Whine, whine, whine. End of
nifty "dissatisfied lover" analogy.
But it isn't merely a preoccupa
tion with Spielberg cliches that
causes me to be almost sub
consciously disturbed by
"Goonies." It's also the film's
schizophrenia — I can't figure out
what type of movie it is supposed
to be.
This reaction is not just a film
critic's frustration with a movie
that defies categorization. I actu
ally delight in films that elude my
conceptual snares and pigeonhol
ing. It's the fact that "Goonies"
does this, not through the
legitimate channels of artistic
creativity and innovation, but
through its neurotic nature. It
leaves me disoriented, but not
wonderously so.

The term "Goonies" itself
refers to a motley bunch of
youngsters who are daringly com
peting with some criminals in the
pursuit of a legendary pirate
hoard. Gleaning this much from
the ads and trailers, and noting
that the film was supposedly in
spired by the "Pirates of the Car
ribean" ride at Disneyland (how
Spielberg can you get?), the film
appears to be a children's
comedy-adventure. Much of the
movie is indeed filled with child
ish slapstick humor and is of a
tone that appeals most to pre
adolescents.

referential in this regard when
