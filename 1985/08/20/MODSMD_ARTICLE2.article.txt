# Tours give students early look

### LESLIE JONATH 
The often overwhelming
task of deciding where to go
for a higher education might
be made easier and more
enjoyable by visiting
campuses all over the nation
with College Campus Tours.
For four days or ten days
and in a price range of $550
to $1,775, students can visit
colleges from Southern Cal
ifornia to Maine. College
Campus Tours helps stu
dents by taking them in
small groups to campuses
and encouraging direct eval
uation and value assess
ments through daily
workshops.
"Choosing a college is a
major decision and an im
portant investment," says
Pat Dever, one of the
founders of College Campus
Tours. "Another opinion
can be a positive supple
ment." As an increasing
number of qualified stu
dents seek higher education,
the choices students face
when exploring their op
tions can often prove con
fusing and difficult. Over
burdened high school coun-
selors may not provide personal
assistance necessary to help the
student make a wiser judgment.
Begun a year ago by three
former teachers who witnessed
the struggles of their own
children, Dever, Margie Arthur
and Carrol Goodell established
College Campus Tours, now
based in San Mateo. (Goodell
received her Ph.D. in education
from Stanford.) All three women
taught together 25 years ago.
"A college will put its best foot
forward in its brochure," notes
Dever, "which could be mislead

ing for a student who needs other
information."
College Campus Tours features
a ten-day trip to the East coast, a
four-day trip to Southern Califor
nia and a four-day trip to the
Northwest. While at the
campuses, students are given a
40-point evaluation form to fill
out. The forms become the basis
for the daily workshops in which
students actively discuss their
impressions and opinions.
Groups are kept to under 20
students with two counselors.
High school counselors are en
couraged to participate in the
tour, and parents are involved in
the planning.

The East coast tour includes
the larger Ivy League schools, but
also pays special attention to a
multitude of smaller institutions
such as Amherst, Ebsen, Boston
College and the Rhode Island
School of Design. Students may
arrange to see any college in a
particular area with the help of
the tour leaders. A tour of this
kind costs $1,775 with airfare in
cluded but no meals.
The Southern California tour
combines visits to several UC
campuses as well as private
schools such as Pepperdine, USC
and the Claremont Colleges. The
most recently added tour will ex
plore the colleges of the Pacific
Northwest.
