# Audience loves power of Huey Lewis
## 
### JENNIFER KOCH Editorial staff 
He is both flamboyant and shy,
provocative and innocent. He is the
epitome of contradiction in both his
actions and his songs, and somehow
Huey Lewis makes it all work.
Even his background appears in
consistent — born of affluent par
ents in prestigious Marin County,
Huey dropped out of high school
and spent years struggling to
survive. Now he has reached a pin
nacle of success and fame, and his
contrary nature has remained intact.
Huey's performance Saturday
night at Sacramento's Cal Expo
Ampitheater, the second of three
shows there that ended his tour, ex
emplified his conflicting manner:
As he and the News took the stage
they proclaimed themselves to be
an old-fashioned band — "that is,
we play the music" — and then
proceeded to introduce and incor
porate a drum machine into the
song "Bad Is Bad."
On stage, Huey alternated be
tween singing with his back to the
crowd and tensing his muscles,
spreading his legs, leaning into the
audience and belting out his lyrics.
His soft, stammering between-song
banter was in sharp contrast to his
carefree, almost cocky attitude
when he introduced some of the
band's hits: "I know you're sick of
hearing all those songs they play on
the radio all the time. Imagine how
we feel."
Songs in which the diverse lyrics
ranged from "I'm the boy next
door" to "hot lovin' every night."
And the most unusual part of
Huey's eclectic performance was
that it succeeded because of all the
contradictions, not in spite of them.
The show contained every song
the fans expected to hear, as well as
several they didn't, and irrefutably
displayed Huey at his best.

The stage came alive with yellow
and purple lights as Lewis
surprised the audience by opening
with his current hit "The Power of
Love." He followed with several
songs from his second album
"Picture This," as well as the
majority of tracks from the cele
brated "Sports" album. "Heart and
Soul," "The Heart of Rock 'n'
Roll," "This is It"and "1 Want a
New Drug" were all expected by the
adoring fans, and Huey didn't dis
appoint.
This was a wholesome type of
crowd — the kind of people who ap
preciated sincere, heart-felt songs
like "Do You Believe in Love" and
"Finally Found a Home." The kinds
Huey and his boyish charm attract
are the ones who don't make a
sound when the MC announces the
dates for New Order's concert tour,
but who go crazy when Rick
Springfield's name is mentioned.
Clean, decent folks — of all ages
— came to worship their clean,
decent, All-American rock star.
After all, this is the boy who sings
the National Anthem at baseball
games.
And Huey stepped into the hot
dogs and apple pie role with ease —
his inspired a cappella version of the
oldie "It's Alright" matched the
crowd's mood perfectly. "It's alright
to have a good time" appeared to be
the focus of the evening, as the
response to this simple tune was at
least equal to that of his chart
topping hit singles.
The power of this confident, con
tradictory performer — and perhaps
the size of his ego as well — was
most apparent when he sang the line
"but do you really love me?" and
immediately held the microphone
over the audience.
Their response was precisely what
Huey Lewis wanted to hear.
