## HP hardware hazardous 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
At least seven pieces of
Hewlett-Packard equipment sold
to Stanford have been found to
pose a possible electric shock haz
ard to users, according to Univer
sity Health and Safety.
The company mailed a notice
to the University stating that the
3497 A Data Acquisition/Control
Unit contains a rear panel with
connectors that could have a po
tential as high as 170 volts. Nor
mal household current is 120
volts.
Hewlett-Packard's records
show that seven of the 3497 A
units were sold to Stanford, but
the University doesn't know
where they are, and HPs records

may be incomplete.
"We don't know who those
seven are," said Kathleen Collins
of the University's Department of
Health and Safety. "And there
might be more that HP doesn't
know about because ordering
here isn't centralized. It's some
thing of concern."
The notice from HP also lists
the same hazard as existing for
the 3498 A extender, and system
models 3054 A, 3054 C and
3054 DL without a rack (Option
400), which contain the 3497 A
and possibly the 3498 A. None of
those models were sold to Stan
ford, according to HP.
The severity of an electrical
shock is contingent on amperage,
not potential voltage, so the

severity of a shock from the rear
panel is not clear. Chris Colona, a
product support engineer for the
3497 A at Hewlett-Packard, said,
"It's normally not going to be
dangerous."
Jean-Guy Bernard of health
and safety said, "It would prob
ably give someone a pretty good
shock."
The units can be made safe by
removing the original cover and
replacing it with a new one, to be
provided by HP. The company is
requesting that the modification
be done by the user.
Any users at Stanford who
believe they have one of the af
fected units should call Jon Mol
destad at health and safety at
497-0448.
