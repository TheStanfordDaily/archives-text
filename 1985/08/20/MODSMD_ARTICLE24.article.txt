## Ex-Card Price cut by 49ers 
### DAVE DUTCHER Staff writer 
Free agent Eric Price, a former
cornerback on the Stanford foot
ball team, was put on waivers by
the San Francisco 49ers Friday.
Price, who became a starter the
fourth game of his freshman year,
was third in tackles for the Card
inal last season with 83, 48 as
sisted and 35 unassisted. He also
tied Mark Hashimoto and Toi
Cook for the team lead with four
interceptions, sixth best in the
Pacific 10 Conference.
Price, who suffered a knee in
jury in training camp that limited
his workout time with the 49ers,
led Stanford and ranked eighth in
the Pac-10 last season with 11
pass breakups on a Cardinal
defense that ranked last in the
Pac-10 in both pass and overall
defense. Price, whose 1984
season high was nine tackles
against Arizona, had eight career
interceptions at Stanford. He was
seventh in tackles in 1983.
In other NFL training camps,

five of the six Stanford players
drafted still are with the teams
that drafted them, even though
the NFL requires its teams to
have their rosters pared to 60
today.
Former Cardinal linebacker
and defensive lineman Garin
Veris might be making the biggest
impression. Veris, who was the
48th player chosen and the 20th
in the second round, has pleased
his new employer, the New Eng
land Patriots.
Veris is "doing great," accord
ing to Patriots spokesman Mike
Loftus, who said Veris played
well in New England's 31-13 vic
tory over Kansas City Saturday
and "did a good job on the pass
rush, which is what we really need
here."
Veris was supposed to report to
the Patriots' camp July 19, but
did not agree to contract terms
until July 24 and did not practice
until July 25, Loftus said. An
other former Cardinal, offensive
lineman Doug Rogers, is on New

England's physically unable to
. perform list because of a foot in
jury. Rogers' final season at Stan
ford was in 1981.
Veris, a defensive end in the
Patriots' 3-4 defense, has been
hampered by injuries. He missed
five days because of a sprained
left ankle and three more because

of a strained left groin. Neverthe
less, he played in New England's
exhibition opener against New
Orleans Aug. 10.
Former Stanford linebacker
Tom Briehl, a fourth-round
choice of the Houston Oilers, also
has survived training camp cuts
thus far. He has joined former

Cardinal wide receiver Eric Mul
lins, who made the team last
season, and tight end Chris Dres
sel, who became an Oiler in 1983.
Another Cardinal fourth-round
selection, wide receiver Emile
Harry, appears to be faring well

New England Patriots.
in the Atlanta Falcons' camp.
Harry caught a 58-yard touch
down pass in the Falcons' 17-14
loss to Washington two weekends
ago. Atlanta has released wide
receiver Alfred Jackson, who had
been with the Falcons for eight
seasons.
Atlanta also chose Brent Mar
tin, who was Stanford's starting
center last season, in the 10th
round. Though still with the Fal
cons, Martin is suffering from a
sore back incurred last week, an
Atlanta spokesman said.
Stanford had two offensive
linemen drafted in the NFL's
sixth round, but one has been cut.
Jeff Deaton was still on the New
York Jets' roster yesterday, and
that team had already reduced its
roster to 60. Matt Moran,
however, was released Friday by
the Dallas Cowboys. Moran
would have been the second
former Cardinal on the Cowboys
— wide receiver Tony Hill is in
his eighth season with Dallas.
The Buffalo Bills released
Kevin Lamar, a rookie free agent
lineman, and Mike Tolliver, a
wide receiver who last played for
Stanford in 1983 and was cut by
Dallas last year. Other free agents
who were released are former
Cardinal defensive back Ed St.
Geme, who was in the Los An
geles Rams' camp, and Terry
Jackson, a former Stanford de
fensive lineman trying to make
San Diego's roster. Jackson was
cut yesterday as the Chargers
needed to release 12 players to
meet the 60-player limit.
Former Card golfer wins
Tim Robinson, Stanford's
leading golfer last year, won the
Northern California Golf Associ
ation Amateur championship
Sunday at Spyglass Hill.
Robinson had a 10-and-9 vie-

Tory over Dana Banke of Castro
Valley in the scheduled 36-hole
final match. Robinson shot a five
under-par 67 in the morning
round, which included chip-in
birdies at the Bth and 15th holes.
Banke won only one hole, par
ring the Bth in the afternoon
round. Robinson finished the
match on the 9th when Banke
three-putted for a six.

sixth round, but one has been cut.
Jeff Deaton was still on the New
York Jets' roster yesterday, and
that team had already reduced its
roster to 60. Matt Moran,
however, was released Friday by
the Dallas Cowboys. Moran
would have been the second
former Cardinal on the Cowboys
— wide receiver Tony Hill is in
his eighth season with Dallas.
The Buffalo Bills released
Kevin Lamar, a rookie free agent
lineman, and Mike Tolliver, a
wide receiver who last played for
Stanford in 1983 and was cut by
Dallas last year. Other free agents
who were released are former
Cardinal defensive back Ed St.
Geme, who was in the Los An
geles Rams' camp, and Terry
Jackson, a former Stanford de
fensive lineman trying to make
San Diego's roster. Jackson was
cut yesterday as the Chargers
needed to release 12 players to
meet the 60-player limit.
Former Card golfer wins
Tim Robinson, Stanford's
leading golfer last year, won the
Northern California Golf Associ
ation Amateur championship
Sunday at Spyglass Hill.
Robinson had a 10-and-9 vie-

Tory over Dana Banke of Castro
Valley in the scheduled 36-hole
final match. Robinson shot a five
under-par 67 in the morning
round, which included chip-in
birdies at the Bth and 15th holes.
Banke won only one hole, par
ring the Bth in the afternoon
round. Robinson finished the
match on the 9th when Banke
three-putted for a six.
Swimmers help break record
Two Stanford swimmers won
individual races Sunday and
combined for a world record in
the Pan l acific Games.
Junior Pablo Morales won the
100 meter butterfly in 53.692
seconds, with sophomore An
thony Moss, competing for New
Zealand, taking fourth in 54.96.
In the 200 breaststroke, senior
John Moffet won in 2:16.74, and
Stanford senior David Lundberg
was fourth in 2:22.55.
Morales and Moffet combined
efforts in the 400 medley relay
with those of Rick Carey and
Matt Biondi, and the result was a
world record 3:38.28.
In women's swimming Sunday,
Stanford's Kathy Smith was fifth
in the 200 breast with a time of
2:36.67.
In previous Pan Pacific Games
swimming, Moss won the 200
butterfly in 1:58.74, with Morales
finishing fourth in 1:59.99. Mof
fet won the 100 breast in 1:02.42,
with Lundberg third in 1:03.64.
Morales won the 200 individual
medley in 2:04.04, and sopho
more Sean Murphy finished third
in the 200 backstroke with a
2:02.35.
Incoming freshman Jenna
Johnson, a two-time Olympic
gold medalist, finished second in
the 50 freestyle with a 26.47.
Johnson, a La Habra product
considered one of the top high
school recruits, also won the 100
free in 56.36 and was a member
of 400 free relay team that won in
3:45.64.
Free agent Eric Price, a former
cornerback on the Stanford foot
ball team, was put on waivers by
the San Francisco 49ers Friday.
Price, who became a starter the
fourth game of his freshman year,
was third in tackles for the Card
inal last season with 83, 48 as
sisted and 35 unassisted. He also
tied Mark Hashimoto and Toi
Cook for the team lead with four
interceptions, sixth best in the
Pacific 10 Conference.
Price, who suffered a knee in
jury in training camp that limited
his workout time with the 49ers,
led Stanford and ranked eighth in
the Pac-10 last season with 11
pass breakups on a Cardinal
defense that ranked last in the
Pac-10 in both pass and overall
defense. Price, whose 1984
season high was nine tackles
against Arizona, had eight career
interceptions at Stanford. He was
seventh in tackles in 1983.
In other NFL training camps,

five of the six Stanford players
drafted still are with the teams
that drafted them, even though
the NFL requires its teams to
have their rosters pared to 60
today.
Former Cardinal linebacker
and defensive lineman Garin
Veris might be making the biggest
impression. Veris, who was the
48th player chosen and the 20th
in the second round, has pleased
his new employer, the New Eng
land Patriots.
Veris is "doing great," accord
ing to Patriots spokesman Mike
Loftus, who said Veris played
well in New England's 31-13 vic
tory over Kansas City Saturday
and "did a good job on the pass
rush, which is what we really need
here."
Veris was supposed to report to
the Patriots' camp July 19, but
did not agree to contract terms
until July 24 and did not practice
until July 25, Loftus said. An
other former Cardinal, offensive
lineman Doug Rogers, is on New

England's physically unable to
. perform list because of a foot in
jury. Rogers' final season at Stan
ford was in 1981.
Veris, a defensive end in the
Patriots' 3-4 defense, has been
hampered by injuries. He missed
five days because of a sprained
left ankle and three more because

of a strained left groin. Neverthe
less, he played in New England's
exhibition opener against New
Orleans Aug. 10.
Former Stanford linebacker
Tom Briehl, a fourth-round
choice of the Houston Oilers, also
has survived training camp cuts
thus far. He has joined former

Cardinal wide receiver Eric Mul
lins, who made the team last
season, and tight end Chris Dres
sel, who became an Oiler in 1983.
Another Cardinal fourth-round
selection, wide receiver Emile
Harry, appears to be faring well

in the Atlanta Falcons' camp.
Harry caught a 58-yard touch
down pass in the Falcons' 17-14
loss to Washington two weekends
ago. Atlanta has released wide
receiver Alfred Jackson, who had
been with the Falcons for eight
seasons.
Atlanta also chose Brent Mar
tin, who was Stanford's starting
center last season, in the 10th
round. Though still with the Fal
cons, Martin is suffering from a
sore back incurred last week, an
Atlanta spokesman said.
