## Ex-Card Price cut by 49ers 
### DAVE DUTCHER Staff writer 
Free agent Eric Price, a former
cornerback on the Stanford foot
ball team, was put on waivers by
the San Francisco 49ers Friday.
Price, who became a starter the
fourth game of his freshman year,
was third in tackles for the Card
inal last season with 83, 48 as
sisted and 35 unassisted. He also
tied Mark Hashimoto and Toi
Cook for the team lead with four
interceptions, sixth best in the
Pacific 10 Conference.
Price, who suffered a knee in
jury in training camp that limited
his workout time with the 49ers,
led Stanford and ranked eighth in
the Pac-10 last season with 11
pass breakups on a Cardinal
defense that ranked last in the
Pac-10 in both pass and overall
defense. Price, whose 1984
season high was nine tackles
against Arizona, had eight career
interceptions at Stanford. He was
seventh in tackles in 1983.
In other NFL training camps,

five of the six Stanford players
drafted still are with the teams
that drafted them, even though
the NFL requires its teams to
have their rosters pared to 60
today.
Former Cardinal linebacker
and defensive lineman Garin
Veris might be making the biggest
impression. Veris, who was the
48th player chosen and the 20th
in the second round, has pleased
his new employer, the New Eng
land Patriots.
Veris is "doing great," accord
ing to Patriots spokesman Mike
Loftus, who said Veris played
well in New England's 31-13 vic
tory over Kansas City Saturday
and "did a good job on the pass
rush, which is what we really need
here."
Veris was supposed to report to
the Patriots' camp July 19, but
did not agree to contract terms
until July 24 and did not practice
until July 25, Loftus said. An
other former Cardinal, offensive
lineman Doug Rogers, is on New

England's physically unable to
. perform list because of a foot in
jury. Rogers' final season at Stan
ford was in 1981.
Veris, a defensive end in the
Patriots' 3-4 defense, has been
hampered by injuries. He missed
five days because of a sprained
left ankle and three more because

of a strained left groin. Neverthe
less, he played in New England's
exhibition opener against New
Orleans Aug. 10.
Former Stanford linebacker
Tom Briehl, a fourth-round
choice of the Houston Oilers, also
has survived training camp cuts
thus far. He has joined former

Cardinal wide receiver Eric Mul
lins, who made the team last
season, and tight end Chris Dres
sel, who became an Oiler in 1983.
Another Cardinal fourth-round
selection, wide receiver Emile
Harry, appears to be faring well

New England Patriots.
