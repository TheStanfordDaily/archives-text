### CLINT HIGHFILL Editorial staff 
The Stanford Graduate School of Busi
ness (GSB) will continue to require appli
cants to its MBA program to submit scores
from the Graduate Management Admis
sion Test (GMAT), despite a decision to
the contrary announced last week by the
Harvard Graduate School of Business.
"These standardized test scores are not
helpful to us in selecting, from a pool of
highly qualified applicants, those individ
uals we judge to have the potential to
become outstanding general managers,"
said John Lynch, assistant dean and direc
tor of MBA admissions at Harvard. The
exemption will begin with the class enter
ing in the fall of 1986.
According to the Educational Testing
Service, which administers the test, more
than 700 schools around the world cur
rently use the test. "This (Harvard) is the
first major institution that discontinued the
test," said Bill Broesamle, president of the
GMAT council. Harvard was one of the
schools involved in founding the GMAT in
the early 19505, he added.
"Since outstanding general managers are
more than just test scores," Lynch said,
"we require of the applicant and of our
selves an exhaustive effort to understand
the whole person. We are interested in
what the applicant has done during the past
20 or 30 years of his or her life. We want to
know not only about academic and profes
sional accomplishments, but also personal
characteristics such as interpersonal skills,
leadership capability, integrity and ethics."
"Eliminating the GMAT will not have a
major effect on Harvard's in-depth and
highly-selective admissions process,"
Lynch said.
But Stanford has not discussed dropping
the GMAT, according to Gary Williams,

director of the MBA program at Stanford.
According to Williams, the GMAT's
quantitative and verbal scores are "an inte
gral part" of a model used to determine
whether an applicant will have academic
problems during the first year at the GSB.

The model, developed about five years
ago by a team of faculty researchers, also
uses five other variables â€” the applicant's
age, undergraduate major, business experi
ence, undergraduate grade point average
and College Excellence Score. The College
