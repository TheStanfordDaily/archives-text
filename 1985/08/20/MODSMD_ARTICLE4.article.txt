# Profs, say deficit decisions needed
## Reagan Administration to ask Congress for $2 trillion debt limit 
### MARSH T. McCALL Editorial staff 
As the Reagan Administration
seeks permission to push the na
tional debt limit to a record $2
trillion and beyond, Stanford
economists warn that serious
long-term problems may arise
from a failure to reduce the debt.
Prof. Michael Boskin, who in a
March issue of Campus Report
predicted that "we may double
the national debt by the end of
the decade," yesterday re
emphasized his assertion, stating
that although Congress has
passed "moderately responsible"
budget cuts to combat the rising
annual deficit, difficulties such as
the changing of Medicare regula
tions hamper progress.
"Congress hopes to cut the def
icit $270 billion over 3 years,"
Boskin said, "My feeling is that
we'll get only about half that."
Boskin, who has served as an
advisory consultant to many Con
gressional committees such as the
House Ways and Means Commit
tee and the Joint Economics
Committee, advocates several
proposals aimed toward lessening
the debt, including a governmen
tal budget cycle every two years
instead of annually.
"The major abuse of smaller
programs is that you can't tell
how big they're going to get the
following year," Boskin ex
plained, adding that a biennial

budget would also allow "a much
greater opportunity to re
evaluate present programs."
Boskin also advocates
"reducing the growth of Social
Security benefits, especially to the
wealthy."
"There's no reason wealthy
retirees should have their income
indexed the same way (as the
poor)," Boskin said.
Boskin pointed out that the na

tional debt is now so large that
interest payments on the figure
are superseded only by Social Se
curity/Medicare and defense
spending.
Risks incurred by a debt this
large include "continued over
valuation of dollars," making it
difficult for national industries to
compete with the prices of im
ported goods, Boskin said.
Prof. Kenneth Arrow echoed

Boskin's concern with the in
creased debt.
"The number '2 trillion' itself is
not a particularly scary thing,"
Arrow said, "but the problem
feeds on itself. A higher debt
means a higher deficit, and so
on.
"This is the first time interest
payments on the debt have been a

major part of the government
budget," Arrow said. Arrow also
acknowledged the "close link''
between the deficit and
"economic strains" of capital in
flow from abroad, echoing com
ments of other economics depart
ment faculty.
Treasury Department officials
will appear before a Senate
Finance subcommittee Sept. 10 to
ask for the increase over the cur
rent debt limit of $1,824 trillion.
The annual deficit, which con
stitutes between 5 and 6 percent
of the nation's gross national
product (GNP), this year topped
the $200 billion mark.
Prof. Steven King, while point

ing out that the fraction of the
GNP which pays for interest on
the debt is 'Mower than most
countries'," acknowledged yes
terday that eventually a tax in
crease would become necessary.
When asked to comment on
Boskin's prediction concerning
the doubling of the national debt,
Prof. John Shoven said yesterday
that while "you can interpret
numbers in many different ways,"
the forecast is "plausible."
"Our policy for the future
should be to 'get our house in or
der now,' " Shoven said, warning
that low taxes today will mean
hard times in the '90s.
"It's like that car advertise
ment," Shoven said, " 'You can
pay me now, or you can pay me
later.' "
