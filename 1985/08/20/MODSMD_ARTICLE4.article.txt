# Profs, say deficit decisions needed
## Reagan Administration to ask Congress for $2 trillion debt limit 
### MARSH T. McCALL Editorial staff 
As the Reagan Administration
seeks permission to push the na
tional debt limit to a record $2
trillion and beyond, Stanford
economists warn that serious
long-term problems may arise
from a failure to reduce the debt.
Prof. Michael Boskin, who in a
March issue of Campus Report
predicted that "we may double
the national debt by the end of
the decade," yesterday re
emphasized his assertion, stating
that although Congress has
passed "moderately responsible"
budget cuts to combat the rising
annual deficit, difficulties such as
the changing of Medicare regula
tions hamper progress.
"Congress hopes to cut the def
icit $270 billion over 3 years,"
Boskin said, "My feeling is that
we'll get only about half that."
Boskin, who has served as an
advisory consultant to many Con
gressional committees such as the
House Ways and Means Commit
tee and the Joint Economics
Committee, advocates several
proposals aimed toward lessening
the debt, including a governmen
tal budget cycle every two years
instead of annually.
"The major abuse of smaller
programs is that you can't tell
how big they're going to get the
following year," Boskin ex
plained, adding that a biennial

budget would also allow "a much
greater opportunity to re
evaluate present programs."
Boskin also advocates
"reducing the growth of Social
Security benefits, especially to the
wealthy."
"There's no reason wealthy
retirees should have their income
indexed the same way (as the
poor)," Boskin said.
Boskin pointed out that the na

tional debt is now so large that
interest payments on the figure
are superseded only by Social Se
curity/Medicare and defense
spending.
Risks incurred by a debt this
large include "continued over
valuation of dollars," making it
difficult for national industries to
compete with the prices of im
ported goods, Boskin said.
Prof. Kenneth Arrow echoed

Boskin's concern with the in
creased debt.
"The number '2 trillion' itself is
not a particularly scary thing,"
Arrow said, "but the problem
feeds on itself. A higher debt
means a higher deficit, and so
on.
"This is the first time interest
payments on the debt have been a

Prof. Michael Boskin, shown here in his office at the National Bureau for Economic Research, believes the
federal budget deficit could be reduced by making budgeting a biennial process.
