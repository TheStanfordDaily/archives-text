## South African communication gap Church leaders say Botha meeting in vain 
### 
PRETORIA, South Africa — South
African church leaders pleaded yesterday
with President Pieter Botha to dismantle
apartheid, but later said the president does
not seem to realize time is running out for
white-minority rule.
The meeting was called to discuss the ra
cial violence that has lasted nearly a year
and left more than 600 people dead.
"The two perceptions of South Africa
were so different that we hardly began to
communicate at all," said Archbishop
Denis Hurley, leader of the nation's 2.4
million Roman Catholics.
Black Anglican Bishop Desmond Tutu,
rejected last month when he asked for a
private meeting with Botha, refused to at
tend, saying the president only wanted to
meet blacks of his choosing.
Tutu, the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize win
ner, told The Associated Press by tele
phone, "When you are listening to Mr.
Botha you realize that he isn't really inter
ested in peaceful negotiation, because he is
strong militarily. . . . His people seem in

tent on bludgeoning blacks into total sub
mission."
Tutu, 53, is the best-known foe of apart
heid, the legal system of racial segregation
under which 5 million South African
whites deny the vote to 24 million blacks.
The delegation from the Roman Catho
lic, Anglican, Methodist, Presbyterian and
Congregational churches was led by Tutu's
superior, the white archbishop of Cape
Town, the Most Rev. Philip Russell. Four
of the clergymen were white, four were
black and one was of mixed-race.
At a news conference afterward, Rus
sell's delegation said they urged the repeal
of the pass laws that make it illegal for
blacks to enter white areas; urged
withdrawal of troops from riot-torn
townships and sought an end to the state
of emergency, the release of imprisoned
black leader Nelson Mandela and a na
tional convention to devise a new constitu
tion.
But, the clergymen said, Botha seemed
to believe a speech he delivered last

Thursday — in which he talked about an
undefined black "co-responsibility in
government — amounted to reform.
"I don't think there was any indication
today at all that he was hearing where we
were," said the Rev. Peter Storey, a white,
the head of the Episcopal Church in South
Africa.
Botha said the talks were frank and that
he would instruct officials to investigate the
clergymen's allegations of police brutality
under the emergency powers.
Botha met earlier with the Rev. Jerry
Falwell, founder of the conservative Moral
Majority movement in the United States.
Falwell told reporters he would launch a
campaign to prevent the U.S. Senate from
voting next month for economic sanctions
against South Africa.
"American people have not been told
the true story," said Falwell, arguing South
Africa is "making progress" and compar
ing this country favorably with black
Africa's one-party states.
Referring to tribal differences in Africa,

he said Americans "have the impression
that we have here a black-and-white situa
tion such as we have in the United States."
Storey described Falwell's view of South
Africa as ''totally inaccurate," superficial
and a "disservice to the cause of justice."
Storey said later that Falwell "hasn't the
slightest idea what is happening in the
hearts and lives and experience of the
majority of people in this nation."
As the church delegation met with
Botha, security police announced 52 more
people had been detained under the state
of emergency imposed July 21.
By police count, 212 people have been
picked up since Friday in the biggest wave
of mass arrests since the first days of the
emergency.
A total of 2,024 people have been ar
rested under the emergency laws, of whom
998 are still in detention, police said.
More than 600 people have been killed
in anti-apartheid violence since last Au
gust, according to an independent monitor
ing group.
