# Pretoria's envoy claims black vote not workable
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — South
Africa's ambassador-designate,
Herbert Beukes, said yesterday
that his country's ruling white
minority will not agree to one
man, one-vote status for blacks
because they have a different
"value system," but that blacks
nevertheless can attain political
equality.
In an interview with The Asso
ciated Press, Beukes said the gov
ernment of President Pieter
Botha has made a firm commit
ment to dismantle apartheid laws,
and "one after the other they
have fallen like dominoes."
"We are committed to political
equality, to justice and to a sys
tem that will be as fair as we can
possibly develop in that country
within that diversity that we
have," he said. "Whether we
(will) find that system, I don't
know."
He agreed that granting of poli
tical rights is the biggest remain
ing issue in South Africa and the

most fundamental to ending the
government's strict system of ra
cial segregation.
But Beukes said Americans
should not have been surprised
that Botha ruled out a one-man,

one-vote policy for South Africa's
24 million blacks, a privilege
enjoyed by the 5 million whites.
He said white South Africans
will not risk allowing black

majority rule because of fears
that their Western-oriented
"value system" would be threat
ened.
"If you want an announcement
that the government says our sys
tem will make provision for black
rule, instead of democratic rule,
then you will be disappointed,"
he said.
Asked if he thought the blacks
were incapable of democratic
rule, Beukes replied that "they do
not seem to be eager or willing to
go into that process."
Beukes said he would not
dispute that South Africa's politi
cal system has worked well for
whites but that blacks have been
shut out.
Beukes said he had no idea
what kind of system South Africa
might attain. He said it would
have to be decided in yet
unscheduled negotiations be
tween the white government and
the leaders of the black and other
communities.
