### 
CARSON CITY, Nev. â€”
Paul Laxalt, one of President
Reagan's closest friends and

advisers, announced yesterday
he would not seek re-election
to the U.S. Senate.
"I continue to feel a deep
and binding obligation to our
state, our president, to my
party and the United States

Senate. But I also feel that ob
ligation can be discharged in
ways other than remaining in
the Senate," he told a crowded
news conference.
Despite these responsibili
ties, Laxalt (R-Nev.) said there
is a ''great difference in what
one may want to do as opposed
to what one should or ought to
do."
Laxalt, who served as
Nevada governor when his
close friend Reagan was gover
nor of California, said earlier
he has made a "flat-out com
mitment" to Reagan to stay in
Washington through the end of
the president's term.
Laxalt said he could con
tinue to serve the president as
a trouble-shooter or special
ambassador even if he leaves
the U.S. Senate.
Reagan, vacationing at his
ranch near Santa Barbara, ex
pressed "sincere regret ,, at
Laxalt's decision.


Sen. Paul Laxalt
