JAL pilot tried to prevent crash
TOKYO — A preliminary transcript of the cockpit voice
recorder on JAL Flight 123, released yesterday, reveals the pilot
ordering: "Raise the nose! Raise it!" making a last-ditch attempt
to save the 524 people on board.
A top Japan Air Lines technician, meanwhile, said inves
tigators were studying a new theory that external pressure may
have caused the jumbo jet to lose its tail and plummet to earth in
the Aug. 12 crash, which only four people survived.
Also, a Japanese newspaper yesterday criticized the perfor
mance of rescue troops who took 14 hours to reach the crash site,
after a report that several passengers survived the crash but did
not live through the night.
A U.S. Forces Japan spokesman said in an interview yesterday
that the Self-Defense Force rejected offers of help from two
nearby U.S. bases.
"Hydro all out," Captain Masami Takahama said two minutes
and 17 seconds into a tape of the plane's last 32 minutes.
Without the hydraulic systems, which operate the control
surfaces used to climb, descend and change direction, the pilot
could not control the plane except with his engines.
"What's broken? Where is it?" the co-pilot or flight engineer
asked five minutes later in the transcript, translated by The Asso
ciated Press. "It's the area of the baggage room. In the back, in
the very back, I understand. That holding area has fallen."
Geoffrey Tudor, a JAL spokesman, said the baggage area
mentioned apparently is one in the very back of the cabin.
Studies on the crash's cause have centered on the plane's tail sec
tion.
An airline source here said Boeing Co. experts were discount
ing a theory that blamed the crash on cracks in a cabin pressure
bulkhead, which could have subjected the tail to a sudden rush of
pressurized air from inside the plane. He spoke on condition his
name not be used.
JAL chief 747 technician Hiroaki Kohno said a new theory
was that the plane's vertical tail fin had not been damaged by air
from inside the plane, but was struck by an unidentified force
outside.
One of the survivors, 12-year-old Keiko Kawakami, said in in
terviews from her hospital bed that she heard the voices of her
father, 8-year-old sister and others after the crash.
They were apparently trapped in wreckage and died during the
night.
The mass circulation Asahi Shimbun said yesterday, "There
are voices that strongly ask anew, 'If the rescue mission had been
there earlier . . .' "
The editorial followed a report by the Tokyo Shimbun newspa
per Friday that rescue teams had ignored reports from local resi
dents that they saw smoke on Mt. Osudaka the night of Aug. 12.
The paper said the teams erroneously kept searching for the
plane on a neighboring peak, Mt. Ogura.
Pope urges interfaith cooperation
CASABLANCA, Morocco — John Paul 11, the first pope ever
to be an official guest in an Arab nation, said yesterday that
Christians and Moslems should replace their "old habits" of war
and polemics with mutual respect.
In a world of "a thousand tensions and conflicts," the pontiff
said, "ideologies and slogans cannot satisfy you or resolve prob
lems of your life."
Casablanca was John Paul's last stop on a 12-day tour of
Africa. He celebrated Mass for Catholics, most of them French
and Spanish, and conferred with King Hassan 11, whose people
believe him to be a direct descendant of the prophet Mohammed.
He then addressed about 80,000 Moroccans at the
Mohammed V Stadium, the first time the pope has spoken to a
large crowd of Moslems.
The pope praised the tradition of tolerance in Morocco, which
he said was reflected by the presence of Jews and Christians here
since ancient times, and asserted that "dialogue between Chris
tians and Moslems is today more necessary than ever."
The Roman Catholic Church and Islam represent the two larg
est religious groups in the world.
Noting "important differences" between Christianity and
Islam, the pope said these could be accepted "with humility and
respect in mutual tolerance."
Nearly all the 23 million Moroccans are Moslems. Most of the
65,000 Christians are citizens of France and Spain, which
governed Morocco jointly until 1956.
The weather was hot and sunny. John Paul greeted the stadium
crowd in Arabic, then used French to praise the generosity of
Moslems toward the poor as "living testimony of their faith."
Another Halley's viewer launched
TOKYO — Japan's Space Agency launched a second satellite
Sunday to observe Halley's comet next March, officials of the
Institute of Space and Astronautical Science said.
The satellite was launched by a three-stage MU-3S rocket at 4
p.m. PDT from the Kagoshima Space Center in Kyushu, accord
ing to an institute official who spoke on condition he not be iden
tified.
Data from the satellite will be used to supplement information
from a sister space probe launched from Uchinoura last January.
The United States, the Soviet Union and the European Space
Association have also launched satellites to study the comet,
which swings around the sun every 76 years, most recently in
1910.
