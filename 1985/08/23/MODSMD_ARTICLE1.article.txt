# Grounds workers maintain the Farm

### JAMES LIN 
Fifty years ago, one dedicated
man, known to his colleagues as
"Harry, the perpetual motion
man," single-handedly mowed
the lawns of the Stanford campus.
Working at full speed, "Harry"
was able to cut all 200 acres of
grass twice in a single week.
In 1985 there are four such
men, who work continuously on a
vastly expanded campus to keep
the green lawns trimmed. They
are four of the 64 employees at
the Stanford Grounds Shop,
which plants, waters, prunes and
cares for the flora of the main
campus.
Steven Gale, a supervisor at the
Grounds Shop, finds the job a de
manding one.
"It gets pretty intense here
during the summer," he said.
"Standards are high." Com
mencement is a particularly busy
time, Gale said, but June's hectic
pace continues into the summer.
Gale, who supervises the
specialty crews at the grounds
shop, is responsible for the irriga
tion system and for care of the
trees on campus.
Irrigation becomes especially
important in summer, when heat
and lack of rain can mean brown
grass and withering plants. Diffi
culties arise, however, when
sprinkling times compete with
picnics and sun-worshippers.
Most watering is done between
10 p.m. and 4 a.m. by automatic
timers, but large areas such as
Frost Amphitheatre and the

lawns in front of Wilbur and Stern
arc used so often for events and
gatherings that the timers there
must be continually changed to
accomodate each event, and slip
ups sometimes occur.
Gale recalls one Wednesday
evening when sprinklers surprised
a group of people watching a
movie, each sprinkler head

pumping out 3.5 gallons of water
per minute. Champagne cocktail
parties have also been acciden
tally "rained out" in the past. !
"It's a very dynamic work envi
ronment," Gale said, noting that
he must almost constantly change
plans to accomodate the needs of
the people at Stanford.
Beyond the routine duties of

trimming and irrigation, the
grounds crews must also care for
an enormous variety of temperate
and tropical plants that flourish in
Stanford's mild climate.
"We just had four banana
shrubs transplanted," Gale said.
The shrubs, which were originally
located by the Graduate School
of Business, were threatened with

destruction by the moving of
several trailers. Tree specialists
uprooted the plants and moved
them nearer to the central parts
of campus.
Flowers, too, are under the
care of the grounds shop. Over
4,000 plants are replaced twice
each year at Stanford.
