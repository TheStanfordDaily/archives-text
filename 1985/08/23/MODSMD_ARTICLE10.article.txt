Local death 'stalker'-linked
SAN FRANCISCO — The "night stalker"
suspected of seven slayings and a terrorizing
string of brutal assaults near Los Angeles was
linked yesterday to the murder of a man found
shot to death in his home here.
Police said the L.A.-area killer is suspected of
murdering Peter Pan, 66, and trying to kill his
wife, Barbara, last weekend. The link came after
comparison of physical evidence with two cases in
the Los Angeles area that have been attributed to
the "night stalker," said Officer Linda Wittcop.
Police patrols have been increased in an effort
to arrest a suspect, she said.
Officials declined to identify which Southern
California murders were linked to the Pan killing.
Sheriffs officials said at a news conference in
Los Angeles they don't know where the killer
might be now.
All but one of the 18 rapes and assaults since

March have involved the suspect entering dark
ened homes through unlocked doors and open
windows, police have said.
Raiders hearing slated
OAKLAND — The city of Oakland has an
other chance to score in its attempt to acquire the
Los Angeles Raiders' franchise by eminent
domain.
The state Court of Appeals granted the city a
Sept. 12 hearing date to prove its; claim of
eminent domain, which usually is used to acquire
property for a public purpose.
The city filed its appeal last Oct. 26 after the
Monterey County Superior Court ruled that the
city did not have the right to acquire the Raiders
by eminent domain.
Officials say it is unlikely a final court decision
would have any impact on the playing site of the
Raiders this season, which begins Sept. 8.
