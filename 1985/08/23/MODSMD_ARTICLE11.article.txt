## The Stanford Daily Editor's farewell
### 
Westerners, as opposed to residents of the Far East, are
obsessed with the notion of the individual. According to my
Western Culture teacher, it all started with capitalism.
! And it continues today. Americans consider Ronald Reagan to
be the man running the U.S. government. This results in an odd
allocation of the blame and credit for the nation's problems and
successes. When the debt ballooned during Reagan's first years,
hÂ£ blamed his predecessor. The media was skeptical. A few years
later, when the economy was surging, Reagan personally took
credit. The media was still skeptical.
Both the media and Reagan failed to understand who was
really responsible. As for the debt, what about Reagan's advisers
and everyone from college students to senior citizens who
lobbied long and hard to preserve their federal funding?
'it is silly to say one individual swung the economy around.
Rather, it was thousands of businessmen who changed their out
look on the economy's future and invested their firms' money ac
cordingly. Or it was the thousands of consumers who opted to
buy a new house or a new car.
By the same token it would be silly for me claim sole responsi
bility for the successes of the summer Daily. Much of the credit
and blame for our great and terrible stories lies with the individ
ual writers. Thanks to the numerous writers who took the time
and made the effort to make this a better paper.
| Our editors are easier to name, and all contributed in his or her
own way. John Lis, managing editor, was a willing worker as my
right-hand man. Mark Zeigler, news editor, set the tone with his
decisions on what to cover. Kris West, wire service czar, worked
to bring you even the latest-breaking stories. Opinions Editor
Marsh McCall wrote a story in literally every issue. Entertain
ment Editor Jennifer Koch's editorial punctuality helped you
receive your paper earlier each morning. Books Editor Bob Basil
supplied some intellectual substance. Lisa Romerein supplied
consistently good feature pictures. Graphics Editors David
Andrews and Doris Mitsch, though called upon too seldom, mas
tered the art of making great maps for us.
Finally, thanks to Mike Hale, Paul Irvin and Beverly.
In evaluating the quality of this summer's Daily then, don't
simply credit me for our successes or blame Reagan for our fail
ures. This was a team effort.
