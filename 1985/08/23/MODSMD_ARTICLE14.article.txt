# Rambo — first solution
## 
### 
As this is my final column, I would like to take
this chance to offer a retraction and a humble apol
ogy. In a July 19 column I implied that Sylvester
Stallone was in Canada during the Vietnam War. I
was, however, grossly misinformed. Mr. Stallone
was not in Canada, but was actually teaching P.E. in
an all-girls school in Switzerland.
Now that the war is over, and thanks to President
Carter's blanket amnesty for draft dodgers, Mr.
Stallone is back here making himself rich and fa
mous. "Rambo, First Blood Part II," Sly's latest
movie undertaking, has become startlingly success
ful. It seems that the man who goes in to single
handedly kill upwards of 40 communists while res
cuing his buddies and restoring the dignity of his
country has hit something of a nerve in our society.
What is it that we find so appealing about
Rambo? Perhaps it is the fact that the movie
portrays the simple and quick solution in action.
Even in the promotional campaign for the movie, it
was said that the politicians wouldn't let Rambo win
the first time, which is why he's back again 20 years
later. (Politicians, apparently, are incapable of fin
ding the quick and simple solution.)
Now that Sylvester is a presidential adviser, in ad
dition to being a movie idol in some circles, ideas for
similar quick and simple solutions seem to be
proliferating. Indeed, the President Reagan has said
that the next time something like the Beirut situa
tion takes place, he "will know what to do."
Presumably, he will follow a more Ramboesque
course of action in order to bypass the wimpy and
generally ineffective negotiations and political
maneuverings, and this time, by God, we'll see some
things getting done.
In a similar vein, the president has proposed that,
instead of wasting a lot of our valuable time on
worthless and weak arms-control negotiations, we
instead pursue the quicker and more simple solution
— that is, we should try to make the weapons we
have stockpiled "impotent and obsolete," by throw
ing a trillion or so dollars at the problem and build
ing lots of space-based weapons, each one some
thing of an orbiting Rambo in its own right.
One can see how mere arms control negotiations
would pale in comparison to such a chance to usher
in an age and free people from the fear of the bomb.
Now that talk of making a "surgical strike" into
Nicaragua is finding more and more listeners, it
would only seem a matter of time before we become

wise enough to see the potential for the quick and
simple solution in foreign affairs as well. It seems
clear that most of the people in control are, for some
unknown reason, deliberately attempting to make
any real progress impossible. If things are to ever
work out the way the way they should, we will have
to do the political equivalent of single-handedly res
cuing our buddies, while taking the opportunity to
make as many commies as we can find meet (well
deserved) death.
In addition to its emerging role in determining na
tional policy, what I like to call "Rambopolitik" is
becoming more and more accepted in the private
sector as well. Last week when a group of military

school students in Santa Barbara were severely and
ruthlessly taunted by some of the locals, David
Kurtzman, a Paly High graduate and alleged Rambo
fan, decided that the quickest and most simple solu
tion would be to go and kill them. Later, when it
looked as though David and his friends would not
be able to find the people they were hoping to kill,
the quick and simple solution became obvious: find
the nearest sleeping bum and kill him instead.
David, now that he is in custody and awaiting
trial, has had some time to think a little and seems to
be regretting his decision to pursue a quick fix. He
has been saying in his letters that he is "more de
pressed than he has ever been in his whole life."
Perhaps it has suddenly become obvious to David
that pursuing the quick and simple solution does not
allow one the time to consider the possible conse
quences.
