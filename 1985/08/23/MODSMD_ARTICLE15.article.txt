Med Center
mistreats secretaries
On the afternoon of Aug. 6,1
lost my job as a medical secre
tary at the Stanford Hospital. I
was fired.
"Your behavior has become
intolerable, you are terminated,"
my supervisor, flanked by the
assistant manager of the human
resources department and two
tough-looking security guards,
informed me.
"You have 10 minutes,"
barked one of the guards, glaring
at me. "Pack up your stuff and
be out of here in 10 minutes, or
we'll carry you out."
I have worked at the hospital
since December 1980, when I
started as a part-time transcriber
in the oncology clinic. I am a *
good manuscript typist. I
graduated from Stanford in 1955
in English literature with great
distinction and was elected to Phi
Beta Kappa. I hold a master's
degree in Latin from Columbia
University. My classical educa
tion lends a special competence
to the medical field. After more
than four-and-one-half years of
experience, I feel I am well
versed in the complexities of not
only typing scientific manuscripts,
but also in preparing research
proposals for submission to the
National Institutes of Health.
I am a grandmother, and,
largely for the sake of my two
daughters and grandchild, I,
along with many friends, devote
a lot of time and energy to trying
to ensure peace on the planet so
that all our grandchildren can
become grandparents, too. *"
I believe deeply in the value of
non-violence, reconciliation and
the peaceful settlement of
disputes. Why were two security

guards summoned to throw me
out of the hospital? Whom did I
threaten? How was I regarded as
dangerous?
On Sunday, Aug. 11,1 made
the following public declaration
to the congregation of my
church:
"I want to call the attention of
everyone on this congregation to
the desperate plight of the secre
taries who work at Stanford
Medical Center.
"The working conditions for
secretaries there are appalling â€”
the women are routinely treated
as half-witted children or cattle.
Every day we are humiliated and
insulted. We are regarded simply
as the living appendage of
various office machines. We are
regarded as expendable. We are
pathetically badly paid. Th 6 at
mosphere is that of the planta
tion, the gulag, the concentration
camp.
"Uppity women who dare to
speak out against the injustice
and meanness are dealt with
swiftly and brutally. We are
made to feel ashamed of our
selves, regardless of age, educa
tion or background."
The irony of my boss' chair
manship of the hospital affirma
tive action committee constantly
impresses (and depresses) me,
but as far as affirmative action is
concerned, some are more equal
than others.
1 will conclude with a quota
tion from "Measure for Mea
sure," truly a woman's play.
Isabella remarks to the Duke:
"Justice, O royal duke!/ O
worthy prince! dishonor not
your eye/ By throwing it on any
other object/ Till you have heard
mc in my true complaint/ And
given me justice, justice, justice,
justice!" (Act V, Scene 1, 20-25)
