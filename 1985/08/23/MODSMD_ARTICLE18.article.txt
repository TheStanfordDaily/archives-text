## Bella Vista: not just a beautiful view 
### 
Most restaurants would not be
worth the drive. Most restaurants
would not be worth the expense.
But then Bella! Vista is not like
most restaurants.
Hidden away like an old suit in
a dark closet, JSella Vista is a
unique place to eat dinner.
Seemingly lost in the hills of
Woodside, this restaurant holds a
special spot in the hearts of those
who have dined there. It is one of
those places that, unless you're
rolling in money, you would be
fortunate to attend twice in a
lifetime.
What exactly sets this restau
rant apart from its competition?
Perhaps only the extensive — yet
costly — continental menu, an
obscure location, exquisite food
and a magnificent view.
Bella Vista is widely known
for a terrific panorama stretch
ing up and down the Bay
Area. The city! lights seen from
your mountain perch make for a
wonderful evening in search of
landmarks. It is highly recom
mended that one's first visit be
after the sun has set. Unfortun
ately, this is common knowledge
to those who frequent the Bella
Vista, and unless reservations are
made a day or two in advance,
one may find oneself dining else

where. One other note on
reservations: make sure to ask for
a table with a view. Otherwise,
there's the possibility you will be
seated in the Forest Room, which
has a fireplace, but no scenic
trimmings.
As the restaurant is locked
away in the woods, there is always
the chance of getting lost on the
dark and, for the most part, un
marked roads. It would be wise to
leave early, in case a wrong turn is
taken along the way. Make no
doubt about it — this is definitely
an adventure.
After a drive that seems like it
never ends, the Bella Vista res
taurant can be seen in the dis
tance. Built just off the road, it
has the appearance of an
abandoned building, save the cars
parked outside. There is no real
"lot" to speak of — just park
your car so that it doesn t block
another.
Now to enter the restaurant.
It's really rather disappointing at
first, as one walks into the not
too-classy bar — half expecting
something to scamper across the
floor.
In contrast, the dining rooms
have a clean, wholesome atmos
phere that immediately makes

one comfortable. The rooms are
warm, cozy and decorated with a
slightly European flavor, lit only
by the glow of several small lamps
placed on each table alongside a
fresh red rose. They are a little
too crowded with tables and
chairs, making it difficult to
manuever, but once you are
seated, that doesn't really seem to
matter.
Within seconds, a glass of water
and a menu are brought to your
table by your tuxedoed waiter.
Now the fun begins as, unless you
can read French or understand
the language of gourmet food, the
menu begins to look like some
thing from another planet. Real
izing that not everybody is fluent
in the French language, the waiter
then embarks on a five-minute
routine describing the specials of
the evening (in English) and
answering any questions the diner
has.
Even with your waiter's much
appreciated assistance, it will still
take some time to decipher the
menu and decide exactly what
you wish to order. The menu of
fers a wide variety of appetizers
— which are meals in themselves
— soups and salads, as well as
main course dinners. But nothing

on this menu comes cheap.
The choice of soup-du-jour or
house salad accompanies each
dinner and, on this particular
night, neither was especially
memorable. The soup was an in
teresting blend, aptly named car
rot soup. It might have been best
to leave it to the rabbits which in
habit the surrounding area.
However, for those who enjoy
soup or salad, don't despair. The
French onion soup was outstand
ing, prepared with croutons and
overflowing with cheese. Also
quite good is the warm spinach
salad that is cooked before your
eyes at the table. Topped with
generous bits of bacon and a
sharp vinegar dressing, this con
fection is not to be passed up by
spinach-salad lovers.
As mentioned earlier, the ap
petizers were much more filling
than a before-dinner-snack is ex
pected to be. The tortellini was
excellent, and the Coquilles St.
Jacques, scallops in a white wine
sauce, had me wishing I had or
dered the larger portion for din
ner as well.
After all this marvelous food,
one still can't forget about the
entrees at Bella Vista. The menu
gives the diner five categories to

choose from: seafood, veal, lamb,
chicken and beef. Take your time
and choose the dish which sounds
best to you. Don't be afraid to ask
questions; the waiter is eager to
answer any inquiries concerning
the menu.
My guest and I opted to try
meals from the beef and veal sec
tions, respectively. The filet mig
non is cooked in a sauce consist
ing of cream, brandy, shallots and
its own juice. Titled "Steak
Diane," this flaming dish is
prepared by your waiter at your
table.
The Veal Jerusalem was out
standing. Delicately cooked and
topped with a hollandaise sauce,
mushrooms and artichokes, this
plate is heartily recommended.
Finally, the issue of the check
must be considered. Face it, this is
a very expensive restaurant. Bella
Vista is one of those places you go
knowing well in advance that it is
going to cost you some money. A
lot of money. It easily falls into
that old cliche, "If you have to
ask . . ." But if you are looking
for that special place to impress,
or perhaps just a stylish place
with extraordinary cuisine, Bella
Vista will not disappoint.
