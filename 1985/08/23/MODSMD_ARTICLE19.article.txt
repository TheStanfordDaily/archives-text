# ROUGH CUTS

Red Lorry Yellow Lorry
"Talk About The Weather"( Red
Rhino)
The debut album from Red
Lorry Yellow Lorry is an
amazingly powerful and cohesive
bit of work. Of course, "bit of
work" is quite an understatement
when considering the impact of
this record upon the alternative
music scene. In the realm of the
"doom and gloom" genre, the
Lorries' (that's "the Trucks" in
Queen's English) latest long
playing effort is destined to
become a classic along the lines of
Killing Joke's first album and Joy
Division's "Unknown Pleasures."
These four chaps from across the
Atlantic will make the hairs on
your arms stand on end.
Preceded by two distinctive
EPs, "This Today" and
"Monkeys on Juice," "Talk
About The Weather" is solid
proof of the Lorries' ability to
consistently produce aggressive
music that is maximally stimulat
ing and devoid of deadening side
effects. The eight songs are burst
ing with urgency and forceful
drive. The lyrics are simple,
honest and personal. No complex
political harangues, no con
voluted stream of dreams. The
deep commanding vocals of
lyricist Chris Reed cut through
the throbbing mesh of guitars and
drums with haunting clarity. Al
though the lyric themes revolve

around emotional desperation,
loneliness and mental anguish,
the musical mood moves from the
dancy "Hollow Eyes" through
the more textured "Sometimes"
on to the relentlessness of
"Happy."
The pulsating dark atmosphere
created by the Lorries is at times
reminiscent of the Sisters of
Mercy sound. Comparisons,
however, only serve to define
loose musical boundaries within
which bands can be sloppily fitted
in and filed. "Talk About The
Weather" is an exciting, if not
simply visceral, amalgamation of
sound and fury. It is raw and un
compromising t music that
deserves a listen.
A-
Sam Cooke
"Live at the Harlem Square Club,
1963"(RCA)
This is a classic album, one
whose release is 20 years
overdue. Sam Cooke was one of
the greatest singers of the rock
*n' roll era. This is perhaps the
first piece of vinyl to due justice
to his genius.
This show was recorded shortly
before his tragic, senseless mur
der and reveals a side of the artist
previously unknown to the
masses. All of his earlier works
showed Cooke to be a romantic
songwriter possessed of an excel

lent voice, but he was a victim of
the prevailing racism of the time
and would never receive his
deserved and full acclaim.
At times Cooke has been un
fairly lumped with such polished
crooners as Richie Valens,
Johnny Mathis and Frank Sinatra.
"Harlem Square" unveils a
Cooke that was moving in the di
rection that Otis Redding, Wilson
Pickett and A 1 Green would ex
plore so successfully. Here Cooke
sweats and gets down, this is sow/,
serious and uncompromising.
He takes all his hits and
reworks them into passionate and
emotional workouts of an entirely
different order. As "Before the
Floord" did for Bob Dylan, and
"Stand in the Fire" for Warren
Zevon, "Harlem Square" allows
the freedom to transform his
older classics and reshape them in
a form more suited to his new ar
tistic direction. Ultimately,
though, this album is incredibly
depressing. Cooke's performance
is masterful, joyful — all in all ex
cellent. This makes his loss all the
more profound. Here was a man
who could have contributed as
much (if not more than) a Marvin
Gaye — unfortunately his gift was
snuffed out by a handgun.
A-
Miles Davis
"You're Under Arrest''
(Columbia)
What can one say about Miles
Davis? "The Prince of Darkness"
has created or influenced more
styles of jazz, tutored and
mentored basically all the bright
lights in recent jazz history.
Only Art Blakey and Duke El

lington have had a comparable in
fluence as bandleaders. Miles es
sentially gave birth to fusion.
After Louis Armstrong, he has
probably done more with and for
the trumpet than anyone else in
jazz. The man was already a
legend at 25.
Miles Dewey Davis is now 55,
and age hasn't slowed him a bit.
He can still cook with the best of
them (as his June Berkeley shows
attest). His latest grouping of
young lions is an aggressive group
of jazz-funk luminaries, including
John Scofield (guitar), Daryl
("The Munch") Jones (bass) and
A 1 Foster (drums). Essentially
this is the same lineup that per
formed so ably on last year's ex
cellent "Decoy."
Neither of the recent efforts are
on the level of the earlier classics,
but they still have some merits.
"Decoy" was mainly an attempt
to be cutting edge, "You're Un
der Arrest" is more pop-oriented.
Miles has always been known for
his adaptations of pop ballads,
here he elevates Cyndi Lauper's
"Time After Time" to listenable
and enjoyable status and turns in
a passable version of Michael
Jackson's "Human Nature." The
band gets to cook somewhat,
especailly on the driving "Katia."
In the final analysis this effort is
pleasant and very listenable —
still a cut above a David Sanborn
or Lee Reitnour. At least he's still
stretching himself unlike Dizzy
Gillespie. But one expects more
from Miles. When he cuts loose,
no one can touch him, but there
are only a few moments when he
does.

Toure Kunda
"Live Paris-Ziguinchor"
(Celluloid)
Just what is a Toure Kunda one
might ask? The answer is one of
the hottest outfits since Fela and
King Sunny Ade to make it big in
Africa, Europe and now
(perhaps) America. The band is
led by three brothers
and displays polyrythmic, jazzy,
multi-dimensional, world-beat
sound. The Toure brothers have
welded a number of influences: It
is very jazz, not as ovprtly politi
cal as Fela and more westernized
than King Sunny.
The album was recorded during
the group's early 1984 tour of
Senegal. The sound is rich and
full, the beat lively and invigorat
ing. The harmonies of the Toure
clan are pleasant, uplifting and
multi-layered. The groove is
funky, infectious and fully
danceable. This band is a treat,
and one hopes they will tour
America again sometime in the
near future. This is an album that
gets stronger and more enjoyable
with each listen. Give Toure
Kunda a listen and you'll be
pleasantly rewarded, j

Grading Scale: A:[ Indispen
sable to any comprehensive col
lection. B: An eminently lis
