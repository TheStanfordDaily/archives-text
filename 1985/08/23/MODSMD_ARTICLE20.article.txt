John Boorman's "The Emerald Forest"
is one of several recent movies dealing with
the various effects of modern society as it
impinges upon the territories and lives of
native peoples.
In Jamie Uys' "The Gods Must Be
Crazy," this conflict is presented in a
lighthearted, humorous way, but the film
ignores the actual disastrous effects that
cnculturation has had upon the Bushman.
Werner Herzog's "Where the Green Ants
Dream" goes to the opposite extreme and
not only depicts the ruined lives of the
aborigines in a hopeless struggle to protect
their sacred ritual sites, but also states a
powerful message about civilized man's re
lation with the earth: "You white men are
lost, you don't understand the land, you
have no sense, no direction, no purpose,"
says Miliritbi, a tribal elder.
who produced and directed
"The Emerald Forest," strikes a balance
between these two extremes; the film does
issue a strong statement about the ordeal
many tribal groups face, but it also
combines fascinating explorations into the
details of tribal life with a sense of drama
and human interaction that is rarely found.
The film is about the life of the Ameri
can engineer Bill Markham who has come
with his family to construct a dam in the
Amazon jungle. While the family is visiting
the dam site, Markham's 6-year-old son
Tommy is stolen by Amazonian Indians,
and for the next 10 years Markham spends
each summer in a grueling and seemingly
hopeless search for his lost son. He finally
comes face to face with Tommy, only to
discover that he is now called "Tomme,"
adopted son of Wanadi, chief of the
"Invisible People," and a future chief him
self.
Dismayed and disappointed, Markham
realizes that he is senarated from his son by

several thousand years of evolution. Al
though he pleads for his son to return to
civilization, Tomme s attachment to his
tribe and the forest is too great. Markham,
while disappointed, understands and
respects his son's devotion to his
tribespeople.
The story becomes more complicated
when "the Fierce People," a tribe dis
placed from their land by Markham's new
dam, steal the women of the Invisible
People and sell them to shanty-town broth
el owners in exchange for machine guns.
Tomee now seeks the aid of his natural
father in recapturing their women.
At this point the essential thematic ele
ments of the film become clear. One tribe's
contact with the outside world threatens
the existence of another. The civilized
world as it impinges on tribal territories
threatens the extinction of the Indian's
pristine, natural way of life.
Bill Markham is caught in the middle of
this struggle. The civilized world Markham
has labored so hard to create is about to
destroy his son's way of living — the
resolution of this conflict provides gripping
drama for the rest of the film.
Part of the success of the film is based on
its stunning realism. It was shot on location
in the Amazon, and the cinematography of
Philippe Rousselot (Diva) makes the
jungle come alive before us. Moreover,
before starting work on the film, Boorman
actually spent several weeks living with an
Indian tribe on the Xingu River, a tributary
to the Amazon. There he experienced
tribal life first hand and became aware of
the timeless rhythm of such an ancient way
of life. According to Boorman, their ritual
happenings are where their real lives are
played out — elaborate fantasies created in
order to challenge, appease and unify with
the spirits of the natural world. A world,
Boorman sensed, with which they are

vastly in tune.
Boorman, a veteran of more than 50
documentaries, stated,'"To tell it right, I
have to be there. I have to touch the past."

Indeed, Boorman's keen perception and
introspection into the natures and relation
ships of his characters, both human and
natural, provides a dramatic tension that is
a level above other films.
The fine cast is led by Powers Boothe as
a fearless, and intensely driven, Bill
Markham, Charlie Boorman (John's son)
as a courageous yet innocent Tommy, and
Rui Polanah as the highly spiritual and
strong leader of the Invisible People.
For Boorman, whose other films such as
"Deliverance" and "Excalibur" deal with
the complex relations between man, nature
and the spiritual world, the story of "The
Emerald Forest" must have been irresis
table. Yet, the superb acting and
cinematography would have been wasted
had it not been for Boorman's mastery of
the medium of film and his ability to con
vey so realistically all that he has come to
understand about the fascinating subject at
hand.
One walks away from the film with a
heightened awareness and sensitivity both
to the plight of the Indians and to their
pristine method of living; they are vastly in
touch with nature and their own
spirituality, and for this one feels respect, if
not reverence.

"The Emerald Forest," strikes a balance
between these two extremes; the film does
issue a strong statement about the ordeal
many tribal groups face, but it also
combines fascinating explorations into the
details of tribal life with a sense of drama
and human interaction that is rarely found.
The film is about the life of the Ameri
can engineer Bill Markham who has come
with his family to construct a dam in the
Amazon jungle. While the family is visiting
the dam site, Markham's 6-year-old son
Tommy is stolen by Amazonian Indians,
and for the next 10 years Markham spends
each summer in a grueling and seemingly
hopeless search for his lost son. He finally
comes face to face with Tommy, only to
discover that he is now called "Tomme,"
adopted son of Wanadi, chief of the
"Invisible People," and a future chief him
self.
Dismayed and disappointed, Markham
realizes that he is senarated from his son by

several thousand years of evolution. Al
though he pleads for his son to return to
civilization, Tomme s attachment to his
tribe and the forest is too great. Markham,
while disappointed, understands and
respects his son's devotion to his
tribespeople.
The story becomes more complicated
when "the Fierce People," a tribe dis
placed from their land by Markham's new
dam, steal the women of the Invisible
People and sell them to shanty-town broth
el owners in exchange for machine guns.
Tomee now seeks the aid of his natural
father in recapturing their women.
At this point the essential thematic ele
ments of the film become clear. One tribe's
contact with the outside world threatens
the existence of another. The civilized
world as it impinges on tribal territories
threatens the extinction of the Indian's
pristine, natural way of life.
Bill Markham is caught in the middle of
this struggle. The civilized world Markham
has labored so hard to create is about to
destroy his son's way of living — the
resolution of this conflict provides gripping
drama for the rest of the film.
Part of the success of the film is based on
its stunning realism. It was shot on location
in the Amazon, and the cinematography of
Philippe Rousselot (Diva) makes the
jungle come alive before us. Moreover,
before starting work on the film, Boorman
actually spent several weeks living with an
Indian tribe on the Xingu River, a tributary
to the Amazon. There he experienced
tribal life first hand and became aware of
the timeless rhythm of such an ancient way
of life. According to Boorman, their ritual
happenings are where their real lives are
played out — elaborate fantasies created in
order to challenge, appease and unify with
the spirits of the natural world. A world,
Boorman sensed, with which they are

vastly in tune.
Boorman, a veteran of more than 50
documentaries, stated,'"To tell it right, I
have to be there. I have to touch the past."

Indeed, Boorman's keen perception and
introspection into the natures and relation
ships of his characters, both human and
natural, provides a dramatic tension that is
a level above other films.
The fine cast is led by Powers Boothe as
a fearless, and intensely driven, Bill
Markham, Charlie Boorman (John's son)
as a courageous yet innocent Tommy, and
Rui Polanah as the highly spiritual and
strong leader of the Invisible People.
For Boorman, whose other films such as
"Deliverance" and "Excalibur" deal with
the complex relations between man, nature
and the spiritual world, the story of "The
Emerald Forest" must have been irresis
table. Yet, the superb acting and
cinematography would have been wasted
had it not been for Boorman's mastery of
the medium of film and his ability to con
vey so realistically all that he has come to
understand about the fascinating subject at
hand.
One walks away from the film with a
heightened awareness and sensitivity both
to the plight of the Indians and to their
pristine method of living; they are vastly in
touch with nature and their own
spirituality, and for this one feels respect, if
not reverence.
