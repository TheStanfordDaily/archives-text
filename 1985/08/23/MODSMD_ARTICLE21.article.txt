# Aretha's latest LP betrays potential
## 
### 
Aretha Franklin at her best sings like
other people talk: It's her most natural
form of communication.
Watching her sing in her videos and tele
vision appearances, and in her wonderful
bit in the movie "The Blues Brothers," she
appears to be unaware of the marvelous
things her voice is doing as it purrs, mews,
hisses, snarls and, occasionally, roars. Only
an occasional grin betrays how much fun
she's having.
This distance provides her performances
with a terrific amount of humor. In"The
Blues Brothers," she pads around the cof
fee shop in her bedroom slippers, her
apron stained with grease, her hair pinned
back, telling her clearly undermatched hus
band that he better think about what he's
trying to do to her. She's the queen of her
own coffee shop, undeniably sexy, and the
audience smiles with delight, secretly glad
they're not the people she's pushing
around.
In her best songs, like "Respect," a
clear-headed sanity co-exists with the
humor and the sexiness. She's smart, she
knows what's going on, and she knows
what needs to be done about it. Her sense
of irony will carry her through.
Unfortunately, Aretha has had trouble
lately finding a producer who can translate
these qualities onto vinyl. Her newest
record is "Who's Zoomin' Who?"
Produced by Narada Michael Walden for
Arista records, it suffers from poor
songwriting (most of the songs are co
written by Walden), and glossy but artless
production.
Many of the songs are almost good. They
all lack something, whether it be lyric-wise,
music-wise or production-wise. The one
thing the album does not lack is great vocal
work by Aretha. She sings each song, no
matter how badly written, as if it were im
portant. It may not be her fault that none
of them are, but she might exercise better
taste in her song selection.
The album begins with "Freeway of
Love," easily the LP's best song and a
whole lot of fun. Written by Walden and
Jeffery Cohen, it belongs to the rock 'n'
roll tradition of songs about cars that are
really songs about sex, something Bruce

Springsteen has elevated to an art.
The song as written is no work of art, but
backed by the Santana rhythm section,
Clarence Clemons on saxophone and a
chorus of eight background singers,
"Freeway of Love" pumps along in true
convertible-music style. Aretha gives a
sexy growl to lyrics like, "City traffic
movin' way too slow / Drop the pedal and
go .. . go . .. go."
Unfortunately, the lyrics don't go far
enough. They are tame for such a sexy
song, as if the songwriters were afraid to
create too sexy a song for Aretha (She is,
after all, the "First Lady of Soul."). This is
ridiculous, though, considering Aretha
isn't at all afraid to sound too sexy.
"Another Night," the album's second
song, is better written (by Roy Freeland
and Beppe Cantorelli) and sounds beauti
ful. It's a pain-and-heartbreak song in the
tradition of John Waite's "Missing You"
and Tom Petty's "Don't Come Around
Here No More." As Aretha tries to per
suade herself she can handle the hurt over
her wrecked love affair, one can hear the
heartbreak in her voice belying the self
assurance of the words she's singing.
With a one-two punch like these first
two songs, it might seem as if the album
would be great, but it quickly lapses into
the mediocre and worse. Aretha's cover of
the Van McCoy song "Sweet Bitter Love,"
one of the two songs Aretha produced her
self, proves that if she had produced the
whole album herself, it would have been
much worse. The song is lackluster and
syrupy, although her vocals soar through it.
(When she first sings the word "bitter" she
bites off the first syllable as if she were
choking on the pain of it all.)
The other self-produced song,
"Integrity," is also written by Aretha —
clearly a mistake. Her singing embodies
many strong emotions, but lyrics like "It
ain't been told, a woman's love as sweet as
mine / You're a star and I help you shine /
There's a good woman behind every man /
Let's go from one and revise the plan,"
make you want to groan.
This is not the only cliched expression of
feminist ideas on the album. It also con
tains Aretha's "duet" with the Eurythmics,

"Sisters are Doin' it for Themselves."
Aretha is really no more than a guest artist
on this song, so this dumb "feminist" an
them should never have been included on
this album. It's a song for people who think
feminism is reading Cosmopolitan and
doing aerobics, and it's destined to be
heard in aerobics classes everywhere.
The rest of the songs verge on the ter
rible, especially "Until You Say You Love
Me" which has lyrics like "Love's waiting
here for the giving / Like a stone."
Nowhere, though, are the shortcomings ot
the producer more evident than on the title
song. It could have been great with its
funky chorus, but producer Walden can't
give the song the kick it needs, and it
becomes slow and drawn out.

Many great black female singers of today
— Patti Laßelle, Donna Summer, Jennifer
Holliday among them — get saddled with
producers who give them a pretty, pop
sheen, as if their voices were as artless and
thin as Sheena Easton's or Olivia Newton-
John's, and Aretha is no exception. Only
Tina Turner seems to overcome it, because
the ragged edges of her powerful voice
make the crystalline production of her
songs shrink to the background.
Aretha Franklin basically nieds a
producer with good taste in songs who can
give her numbers the same punch her sing
ing gives them. She's too great a pop singer
to deserve anything less.

work by Aretha. She sings each song, no
matter how badly written, as if it were im
portant. It may not be her fault that none
of them are, but she might exercise better
taste in her song selection.
The album begins with "Freeway of
Love," easily the LP's best song and a
whole lot of fun. Written by Walden and
Jeffery Cohen, it belongs to the rock 'n'
roll tradition of songs about cars that are
really songs about sex, something Bruce

Springsteen has elevated to an art.
The song as written is no work of art, but
backed by the Santana rhythm section,
Clarence Clemons on saxophone and a
chorus of eight background singers,
"Freeway of Love" pumps along in true
convertible-music style. Aretha gives a
sexy growl to lyrics like, "City traffic
movin' way too slow / Drop the pedal and
go .. . go . .. go."
Unfortunately, the lyrics don't go far
enough. They are tame for such a sexy
song, as if the songwriters were afraid to
create too sexy a song for Aretha (She is,
after all, the "First Lady of Soul."). This is
ridiculous, though, considering Aretha
isn't at all afraid to sound too sexy.
"Another Night," the album's second
song, is better written (by Roy Freeland
and Beppe Cantorelli) and sounds beauti
ful. It's a pain-and-heartbreak song in the
tradition of John Waite's "Missing You"
and Tom Petty's "Don't Come Around
Here No More." As Aretha tries to per
suade herself she can handle the hurt over
her wrecked love affair, one can hear the
heartbreak in her voice belying the self
assurance of the words she's singing.
With a one-two punch like these first
two songs, it might seem as if the album
would be great, but it quickly lapses into
the mediocre and worse. Aretha's cover of
the Van McCoy song "Sweet Bitter Love,"
one of the two songs Aretha produced her
self, proves that if she had produced the
whole album herself, it would have been
much worse. The song is lackluster and
syrupy, although her vocals soar through it.
(When she first sings the word "bitter" she
bites off the first syllable as if she were
choking on the pain of it all.)
The other self-produced song,
"Integrity," is also written by Aretha —
clearly a mistake. Her singing embodies
many strong emotions, but lyrics like "It
ain't been told, a woman's love as sweet as
mine / You're a star and I help you shine /
There's a good woman behind every man /
Let's go from one and revise the plan,"
make you want to groan.
This is not the only cliched expression of
feminist ideas on the album. It also con
tains Aretha's "duet" with the Eurythmics,

"Sisters are Doin' it for Themselves."
Aretha is really no more than a guest artist
on this song, so this dumb "feminist" an
them should never have been included on
this album. It's a song for people who think
feminism is reading Cosmopolitan and
doing aerobics, and it's destined to be
heard in aerobics classes everywhere.
The rest of the songs verge on the ter
rible, especially "Until You Say You Love
Me" which has lyrics like "Love's waiting
here for the giving / Like a stone."
Nowhere, though, are the shortcomings ot
the producer more evident than on the title
song. It could have been great with its
funky chorus, but producer Walden can't
give the song the kick it needs, and it
becomes slow and drawn out.

Many great black female singers of today
— Patti Laßelle, Donna Summer, Jennifer
Holliday among them — get saddled with
producers who give them a pretty, pop
sheen, as if their voices were as artless and
thin as Sheena Easton's or Olivia Newton-
John's, and Aretha is no exception. Only
Tina Turner seems to overcome it, because
the ragged edges of her powerful voice
make the crystalline production of her
songs shrink to the background.
Aretha Franklin basically nieds a
producer with good taste in songs who can
give her numbers the same punch her sing
ing gives them. She's too great a pop singer
to deserve anything less.

Aretha Franklin at her best sings like
other people talk: It's her most natural
form of communication.
Watching her sing in her videos and tele
vision appearances, and in her wonderful
bit in the movie "The Blues Brothers," she
appears to be unaware of the marvelous
things her voice is doing as it purrs, mews,
hisses, snarls and, occasionally, roars. Only
an occasional grin betrays how much fun
she's having.
This distance provides her performances
with a terrific amount of humor. In"The
Blues Brothers," she pads around the cof
fee shop in her bedroom slippers, her
apron stained with grease, her hair pinned
back, telling her clearly undermatched hus
band that he better think about what he's
trying to do to her. She's the queen of her
own coffee shop, undeniably sexy, and the
audience smiles with delight, secretly glad
they're not the people she's pushing
around.
In her best songs, like "Respect," a
clear-headed sanity co-exists with the
humor and the sexiness. She's smart, she
knows what's going on, and she knows
what needs to be done about it. Her sense
of irony will carry her through.
Unfortunately, Aretha has had trouble
lately finding a producer who can translate
these qualities onto vinyl. Her newest
record is "Who's Zoomin' Who?"
Produced by Narada Michael Walden for
Arista records, it suffers from poor
songwriting (most of the songs are co
written by Walden), and glossy but artless
production.
Many of the songs are almost good. They
all lack something, whether it be lyric-wise,
music-wise or production-wise. The one
thing the album does not lack is great vocal
work by Aretha. She sings each song, no
matter how badly written, as if it were im
portant. It may not be her fault that none
of them are, but she might exercise better
