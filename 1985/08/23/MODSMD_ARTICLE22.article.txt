### BOB BASIL Editorial staff 
It is a good idea for a college
newspaper to devote a whole
page to a pop/rock band like
Katrina and the Waves, as this
paper did a few weeks ago when
Joe Mader wrote, "Give Katrina
three waves hello." Good, be
cause looking with an unsomber
seriousness at a pop band can
sometimes reveal why it is worth
loving what is mass produced for
us, or[ why we had better love at
least Some of it.
But there were spots in
Mader's more-or-less intelligent
piece that struck me as, uh, coun
terproductive. When you give a
whole page to a subject, you are
saying, I suppose, that the subject
is worth a whole page, but Mader
keeps resisting this conclusion. To
him, the Katrina and the Waves
album is at most well-crafted pop,
"verging on the banal." "Walking
on Sunshine," its biggest hit, "is
one of the few examples of what
top-40 radio should be about, and
for that alone, Katrina and the
Waves deserve high praise." The
band, he says, does not "stir deep,
important feelings in their lis
teners; Katrina and the Waves
just want them to have a good
time.";
Mader compares the Waves
unfavorably to The Pretenders
and says that lead singer Katrina
Leskanich's voice resembles
Chrissie Hynde Kerr's (a claim I
find bizarre — for Kerr's voice is
a delicate, if snarling, kind of Patti
Smith crossed with Joni Mitchell,
while Katrina's BOOMS).
Why the article stuck me with
agitation can best be found in this
line of Mader's : Songwriter Kim
berly Rew "is an intelligent pop
craftsman. His songs at their best
have a bubbly lightness, as in
'Red Wine and Whiskey,'
'Walking on Sunshine,' 'Game of
Love' and 'Going Down to Liver
pool.' "
But, in the order he gives them,
the songs deal with: two dirt-poor
lovers on the run ("We had a lot
of money, but we blew it down
the line/ We'd love to take you
out tonight but we haven't got a
dime/ gotta learn to keep moving
(shake it up)"; a woman's desper
ate hope that her lover will come
back to her (the song lets you
know he probably won't, so it's
not cheeriness you're listening to,
but manic delusion); impotence;

and unemployment with no end.
This is not bubbly.
I should confess that my zeal in
this matter is that of a convert. I
originally thought "Walking on
Sunshine" was by Wham. And
the first time a friend played the

Katrina admits in a recent interview
that 'I was a big fan of the Partridge
Family.' Songwriter Kimberly Rew is a
Cambridge graduate in love with
psychedelic music. Together with
Vince de la Cruz (bottom left) and
Alex Cooper (bottom right) they have
made magic, but who knows how long
it can last?

Waves' album for me (saying
"I've found the perfect group for
you, Bob") I thought he was
mocking me. But, upon close lis
tening, I found it impossible to as
sail the artistry of many of the
cuts.
"Going Down to Liverpool" is
probably the best song on the al

bum. The lyrics consist of two
sentences. "Hey now, where're
you going with that ÜB4O in your
hand, through this green and
pleasant land? I'm going down to
Liverpool to do nothing, all the
days of my life." A ÜB4O is the

British unemployment form.
Mader compares the Waves' ver
sion unfavorably to one done by
The Bangles: "Next to the
Bangles' version, Katrina and the
Waves' is leaden and plodding.
The Bangles' sparkling, sha-la-la
harmonies and their delicate,
chiming guitars are exactly what

is required, and Katrina and the
Waves can only approximate it."
Every single person I've played
both versions for agreed with
Mader, at first, until I exclaimed
that the song was about a man or
woman who understood that he
or she was going to be on the
dole, forever, and that the
plaintive soulfulness of Katrina's
voice and Rew's suggestion of
weeping slide guitar described
this fact more profoundly. In the
Bangles' version, the singer has a
snide, American accent, the
guitars jangle along in that ironic
power-pop mode of Dave Ed
munds or Nick Lowe, and the
man or woman on the dole
sounds like an exaggerating
young punker. In the Waves' ver
sion, we witness the voice of one
unjustly ejected from a country's
economic system, the voice of one
who will indeed probably never
work again. This is a pop song,
but it is not about perfect love, or
perfect remorseful lost love; it is,
in the space of two fabulous sen
tences, a political protest that
sacrifices none of its power to
hack political dogma. .
(Although I think Katrina's
version is more moving, The
Bangles' too is delightful, and it is
a mark of the song's brilliance
that it easily allows both musical
performances.)
One important thing the Waves do
is take the structures of conven
tional radio pop and employ them
to question, indeed attack, the
world which produced these
structures in an effort to
lobotomize us. This is great
music. And it has a tradition: Lis
ten to Chuck Berry's "I'm So
Glad to be Back in the USA."
The troubling paradox is that
such art is predicated on the
world being stupid, unfair and
ugly. In a better world we would
be forced to endure without
Picasso's Guernica or Beckett's
"Waiting for Godot." It'd be
toodle-oo for our favorite tunes
— "Dancing in the Streets,"
"Everyday People," John Len
non's "Yer Blues," Lou Reed's
"Heroin," the Stones' "Street
Fighting Man" and "You Can't
Always Get What You Want."
I value newsprint more than
acid-free paper, Big Macs more
than sushi, and radio more than
string quartets in the park; radio,
in fact, more than anything, and
corporate-controlled and

censored radio the most. The first
and less noble reason is that my
cultural roots dig into garbage;
but I prefer another reason, that
any flower that can grow out from
underneath the mound of muck
of "album-oriented radio" and
top-40 radio deserves our best
applause, especially if the corpo
rations which sponsor it don't
know they are also being sub
verted by it. There are several
such flowers on the Katrina and
the Waves album, so it is a
humongous mistake to write off
the group's stuff as merely
bearable pop fodder.
This said, I should add that I
cannot expect that Katrina and
the Waves will accomplish any
thing else of note in the future. A
friend of mine says that
"everybody has a good hit single
in 'em. One in a thousand have
two or three." This maxim cuts
both ways: We all got one, but
probably only one. To make it in
the interest of the critic for a
musician to succeed, to purchase
rock group "futures," is a kind of
exploitation — because the
musician is then viewed not as a
creator but as the critic's aesthetic
proof.
Of course we want musicians to
make good music. This is called
good will. But in fact we want
even more than that. We want
them to change our lives. Which
explains our bitterness toward the
likes of Mick Jagger or Paul
McCartney, no matter how pleas
ant their product is now. When
you define yourself as a critic of
music (a category comprised of
anybody who raps on what he or
she listens to), this activity can
become ambiguous, career- (not
art-) enhancing.
I don't know what Katrina and
the Waves will come up with on
their next albums, so I want to
conclude by passing on some of
this one's greater lyrical mo
ments. On their second single,
"Do You Want Crying?" there is:
I see your smile
it's your face...
Do you want crying?
Look, I'm crying.
Do you want crying?
You got me crying.
And from "Red Wine and
Whiskey":
thunder and lightening
down at the beach
me and my boyfriend
got five cents each.

It is a good idea for a college
newspaper to devote a whole
page to a pop/rock band like
Katrina and the Waves, as this
paper did a few weeks ago when
Joe Mader wrote, "Give Katrina
three waves hello." Good, be
cause looking with an unsomber
seriousness at a pop band can
sometimes reveal why it is worth
loving what is mass produced for
us, or[ why we had better love at
least Some of it.
But there were spots in
Mader's more-or-less intelligent
piece that struck me as, uh, coun
terproductive. When you give a
whole page to a subject, you are
saying, I suppose, that the subject
is worth a whole page, but Mader
keeps resisting this conclusion. To
him, the Katrina and the Waves
album is at most well-crafted pop,
"verging on the banal." "Walking
on Sunshine," its biggest hit, "is
one of the few examples of what
top-40 radio should be about, and
for that alone, Katrina and the
Waves deserve high praise." The
band, he says, does not "stir deep,
important feelings in their lis
teners; Katrina and the Waves
just want them to have a good
time.";
Mader compares the Waves
unfavorably to The Pretenders
and says that lead singer Katrina
Leskanich's voice resembles
Chrissie Hynde Kerr's (a claim I
find bizarre — for Kerr's voice is
a delicate, if snarling, kind of Patti
Smith crossed with Joni Mitchell,
while Katrina's BOOMS).
Why the article stuck me with
agitation can best be found in this
line of Mader's : Songwriter Kim
berly Rew "is an intelligent pop
craftsman. His songs at their best
have a bubbly lightness, as in
'Red Wine and Whiskey,'
'Walking on Sunshine,' 'Game of
Love' and 'Going Down to Liver
pool.' "
But, in the order he gives them,
the songs deal with: two dirt-poor
lovers on the run ("We had a lot
of money, but we blew it down
the line/ We'd love to take you
out tonight but we haven't got a
dime/ gotta learn to keep moving
(shake it up)"; a woman's desper
ate hope that her lover will come
back to her (the song lets you
know he probably won't, so it's
not cheeriness you're listening to,
but manic delusion); impotence;

and unemployment with no end.
This is not bubbly.
I should confess that my zeal in
this matter is that of a convert. I
originally thought "Walking on

Waves' album for me (saying
"I've found the perfect group for
you, Bob") I thought he was
mocking me. But, upon close lis
tening, I found it impossible to as
sail the artistry of many of the
cuts.
"Going Down to Liverpool" is
probably the best song on the al

bum. The lyrics consist of two
sentences. "Hey now, where're
you going with that ÜB4O in your
hand, through this green and
pleasant land? I'm going down to
Liverpool to do nothing, all the
days of my life." A ÜB4O is the

British unemployment form.
Mader compares the Waves' ver
sion unfavorably to one done by
The Bangles: "Next to the
Bangles' version, Katrina and the
Waves' is leaden and plodding.
The Bangles' sparkling, sha-la-la
harmonies and their delicate,
chiming guitars are exactly what

is required, and Katrina and the
Waves can only approximate it."
Every single person I've played
both versions for agreed with
Mader, at first, until I exclaimed
that the song was about a man or
woman who understood that he
or she was going to be on the
dole, forever, and that the
plaintive soulfulness of Katrina's
voice and Rew's suggestion of
weeping slide guitar described
this fact more profoundly. In the
Bangles' version, the singer has a
snide, American accent, the
guitars jangle along in that ironic
power-pop mode of Dave Ed
munds or Nick Lowe, and the
man or woman on the dole
sounds like an exaggerating
young punker. In the Waves' ver
sion, we witness the voice of one
unjustly ejected from a country's
economic system, the voice of one
who will indeed probably never
work again. This is a pop song,
but it is not about perfect love, or
perfect remorseful lost love; it is,
in the space of two fabulous sen
tences, a political protest that
sacrifices none of its power to
hack political dogma. .
(Although I think Katrina's
version is more moving, The
Bangles' too is delightful, and it is
a mark of the song's brilliance
that it easily allows both musical
performances.)
One important thing the Waves do
is take the structures of conven
tional radio pop and employ them
to question, indeed attack, the
world which produced these
structures in an effort to
lobotomize us. This is great
music. And it has a tradition: Lis
ten to Chuck Berry's "I'm So
Glad to be Back in the USA."
The troubling paradox is that
such art is predicated on the
world being stupid, unfair and
ugly. In a better world we would
be forced to endure without
Picasso's Guernica or Beckett's
"Waiting for Godot." It'd be
toodle-oo for our favorite tunes
— "Dancing in the Streets,"
"Everyday People," John Len
non's "Yer Blues," Lou Reed's
"Heroin," the Stones' "Street
Fighting Man" and "You Can't
Always Get What You Want."
I value newsprint more than

string quartets in the park; radio,
in fact, more than anything, and
corporate-controlled and

and less noble reason is that my
cultural roots dig into garbage;
but I prefer another reason, that
any flower that can grow out from
underneath the mound of muck
of "album-oriented radio" and
top-40 radio deserves our best
applause, especially if the corpo

know they are also being sub
verted by it. There are several
such flowers on the Katrina and
the Waves album, so it is a
humongous mistake to write off
the group's stuff as merely
bearable pop fodder.
This said, I should add that I
cannot expect that Katrina and
