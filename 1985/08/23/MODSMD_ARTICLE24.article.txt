"The Education of Gregory
McDonald"
By Gregory McDonald
Warner Books, 234 pp., $7.95
The essays in this collection
were written for the Boston

Globe during the late 1960s and
early '70s, when this country's so
called counter-culture was at its
height. They ought to make jour
nalists sick, especially those
feature writers who pride them
selves on squishing the Zeitgeist
into a phrase set off by commas.
Because Gregory McDonald, a
self-proclaimed counter
revolutionary, is the quintessen
tial journalist.
A master of the curt and preg
nant demolition, McDonald takes
on Joan Baez, Andy Warhol, Phil

Ochs, Jack Kerouac, Krish
namurti, and two dozen others
and reveals their common
fatuousness and pretension.
A good job he does; a good
hand job, too.

We are meant to see that
McDonald's education consisted
of realizing that the hallowed
teachers of the 1960s knew less
than he — a can't-fool-me, gut
right journalist — knew. So he
shows us how utterly deluded, for
example, Ochs and Baez were.
They thought they were political
forces, but they were nothing.
McDonald's method is to cozy
up to his subjects (who really
should have been warned) and
quote them at their most cryptic
or platitudinous. And then, just

so the reader feels the full mea
sure of McDonald's scorn, he
kicks his subjects through the
wicket with outright dismissals.
"Apparently (Joan Baez) felt that
if the government were truly rep
resentative of the people, it would
never commit violence, which is
truly questionable."
McDonald, suspicious of all
ideals, would prefer not to be
writing newsprint feature stories
on his subjects so much as
epitaphs on them. He can often
incorporate this preference
though. "Within minutes then, it
seemed, only a year or two, Phil
Ochs was dead, of misad
venture." "After lunch we found
a long line of young people stand
ing in the spitting rain, quietly
awaiting a two- or three-minute
personal interview with Krish
namurti. They were waiting to
talk with someone who would tell
them nothing." "Fourteen
months later, Jack Kerouac died
of a hemorrhage, in Florida."
"Ten years later, James Groppi,
no longer a priest, was employed
by the city of Milwaukee as a bus
driver."
McDonald reminds me of the
journalist in Eugene lonesco's
play, "Rhinoceros," the guy who
claims to be the only one in the
building who knows anything
while the world's going to the
rhinos. But lonesco's journalist is
one of the first to become a
rhinoceros. What McDonald
really knows is how to get that
30-minute interview with a fa
mous body, suck up to it shame
lessly, then crucify it.
In any case, McDonald has
stopped writing for the Globe and
now writes novels, as most
feature journalist Zeitgeist
-describers want to do. His most
successful ones comprise a series
of detective novels based on the
character "Fletch." A movie star
ring Chevy Chase has been
adapted from them.
Gregory McDonald has really
showed those radicals something.
No R.I.P. for him.
— Bob Basil


McDonald writes, "It is the people of the '60s, what they looked like,
what they said and did, who, what, where, how and why, that are my
souvenirs of a blown world." It's a shame he treats these people as if
they were all like Tiny Tim.
