"Wittgenstein"

Random House, 156 pp., $17.95
It is hard, in general, to be
right. It is especially hard to be
right on the subject and thought
of Ludwig Wittgenstein. So to
say outright that A.J. Ayers'
analysis of the gnomic philoso
pher of logic and language is al
most wholly wrong is not all
that damning.
People who know lit le about
philosophy often have heard of
Wittgenstein and the draconian
limits he placed on philosophy.
In the only book published in
his lifetime, "The Tractatus,"
he wrote, "My work consists of
two parts: the one presented
here plus all that I have not
written. And it is precisely this
second part that is the impor
tant one. Where many others
today are just gassing, I have
managed in my book to put
everything firmly into place by
being silent about it."
In a lecture published a dozen
years after his death in 1951,
Wittgenstein said that "the ten
dency of all men who ever tried
to talk about Ethics or Religion
was to run against the bound
aries of language. This running
against the walls of our cage is
perfectly, absolutely hopeless."
But we are also unable not to
talk about such central ques
tions of our experience, despite
the fact that what we say "does
not add to our knowledge in any
sense. But it is a document of a
tendency in the human mind
which I personally cannot help
respecting deeply, and I would
not for my life ridicule it."
Such skepticism has often had
a deleterious effect on philosop
hers who wanted their work to
do more than just show them
what they couldn't do.
Paradoxically, to many poets,
Wittgenstein is revered. Major
American writers such as Louis
Zukofsky and Robert Creeley
have, in large measure, ac
cepted Wittgenstein's view of

language. But they have been
able to create wonderful work
by reaffirming that what we can
make of language, hopeless as it
is, is more our own that a world,
a mortality, and a God beyond
our control.
This slim but fairly compre
hensive study is written by a
philosopher who was once an
acolyte of Wittgenstein, but
who now either ignores or has
forgotten the key spirit, the
generating commands, of his
ex-master's work. So we get cri
tique that is wrongheaded, but
wrongheaded in a resolute and
consistent way in which the very
misreadings help!you position
two influential modern ideas
against each other in a way a
more ingratiating book
couldn't.
Ayers, a longtime professor
of philosophy at Oxford and the
author of many books
(including the influential
"Philosophy of the Twentieth
Century"), thinks Wittgenstein
went too far.
If you employ logical analysis
rigorously enough, Ayers holds,
you can most certainly repre
sent the world or your private
feelings in a correct way. And
where Wittgenstein would
question the very validity of a
coherent, contained "self' that
thinks and acts, Aye rs cham
pions "the uniqueness of the
subject." His proof: "I am
one."
"Wittgenstein" is written in
that crisp, gentlemanly style one
would expect from an Oxford
professor — and this offers a
pleasing contrast to the stacks
of other expositions on Witt
genstein that preserve Wittgen-
difficulty while
demolishing the obsessive,
indeed poetic, beauty that
makes his work so compelling
to readers outside the bounds of
academic philosophy.
