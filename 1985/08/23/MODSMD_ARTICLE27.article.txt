McCarthy wins AI prize
John McCarthy, one of the pioneers
in the field of artificial intelligence (AI),
received the first Award for Research
Excellence at the International Joint
Conference on Artificial Intelligence
held at UCLA Wednesday.
McCarthy, professor of computer sci
ence and director of the Artificial Intel
ligence Laboratory at Stanford, is
credited with giving AI its name, with
developing the computer language LISP
(List Processing Language), used by
most American AI researchers, and with
helping found two of the three main AI
labs in the nation — Stanford's and the
one at MIT. (The third is at Carnegie-
Mellon University in Pittsburgh.)
He also invented time-sharing, which
permits one computer to do several
things simultaneously.
McCarthy is one of the leaders in the
attempts to use formal mathematical
logic to produce machines that "think,"
not merely process information. He calls
this nonmonotonic logic because it can
tolerate ambiguity, sometimes by using
incomplete information. In normal
mathematical logic, all exceptions to the
rule must be laid out in detail. •
At the meeting at UCLA, McCarthy
spoke on "The Easiest Unsolved Prob
lems of AI."

1985 MBA graduates of the Stanford
Business School than any other single
industry group, while consulting firms
attracted their lowest percentage of
graduates in recent years, the school's
annual employment survey shovys.
The percentage of June 1985 MBA
graduates who took jobs with consulting
firms dropped to 12.9 percent,| a sharp
decline from last year's 17 percent
