Attention all staffers and
friends: Volume 187 A ban
quet will be held Saturday.
Meet at The Daily at 5 p.m.
for prerevent drinks and
fun.
As for the banquet itself,
just don't ask too many
questions. It will either be
held at a Japanese restau
rant in San Francisco or at a
nice steak restaurant in the
same city. Call John or Clint
for further details or check
The Daily's front door. Half
the fun of this will be the
spontaneity. It's got to be.
The Daily will pay for a lot
of drinks and $8 of your
dinner tab. That's more
than reasonable.
Final checks for this
volume will be available
Aug. 30. If you will not be
available, the checks will be
mailed to the address ap
pearing on your checks. If
that address is incorrect,
please contact Karen on
business side. Also, last call
for W-4 forms. Karen or
John should receive all
forms by 9 a.m. Monday.
