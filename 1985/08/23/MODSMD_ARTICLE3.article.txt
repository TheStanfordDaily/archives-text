# University yet to make wage offer
## 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
The latest round of bargaining sessions between
the University and United Stanford Workers ended
Wednesday with the University still having not
made a wage proposal.
"They want to get us where the contract is expir
ing and we'll do anything to get a contract," said
Mary Ann Tenuto, USWs chief negotiator. "We're
not going to do that."
As a result, prospects for a settlement before the
current contract ends Aug. 31 are looking bleaker.
The two sides meet again next Wednesday, with a
final meeting next Friday, one day before the con
tract expires. The University did propose meetings
today and Sunday.
"We asked to meet Friday and Sunday,' 1 said
Priscilla Wheeler, the University's chief negotiator.
"They declined to meet until Wednesday."
But Tenuto said, "They knew we couldn't meet
Friday. I'm in arbitration all day and couldn't meet.
Sunday is just really short notice. A lot of people
couldn't make it."
Tenuto again emphasized that USW wants to
avoid a strike if at all possible.
The union, Local 680 of the AFL-ClO's Service
Employees International Union, proposed wage in
creases of $5.8 million, almost a 1 7 percent increase
over current wage costs for the bargaining unit. The
University cited statistics from the Bureau of Na
tional Affairs that the median wage settlement this
year has been 4 percent.
However, Tenuto said, "We know that Stanford
has given a pay raise of 5 to 10 percent to all its
other employees."
Wheeler said, "We couldn't make a strong wage
proposal because we haven't discussed our (other)
proposals and their proposal would have a tremen
dous economic impact."
Tenuto said, "They offered us
absolutely nothing and proposed
a massive takeaway of rights."
The University put forth
proposals Wednesday intended to
make qualifications and perfor
mance the determining factor in
promotions, not seniority, as the
union has proposed. The Univer
sity characterized the union's
comparable worth and pay equity
proposals as wage proposals.
Wheeler also expressed con
cern with the union's proposal
that "there shall be no contract
ing out of bargaining unit work,
and bargaining unit work shall
not be performed by non
bargaining unit people."

"For example," she said, "the
linear collider construction will
require some technician work,
which is bargaining unit work, but
it's temporary." She said it would
make no sense for the University
to hire union workers, then lay
them off when work was com
pleted.
Tenuto took issue with a Uni
versity proposal that would let the
University "be able to talk to a
worker alone without the pres
ence of the union to settle a griev
ance. That's against federal law.
They want us to give away that
right in our contract."
She was upset with the timing
of the University's proposals.
"They've had five weeks â€” they
waited to give us two days," she
said, referring to the meeting the
University proposed for today.
Wheeler said, "The most trou

bling thing is that the union took
the position that they didn't have
an obligation to bargain on the
proposals the University made on
its own."
The union maintains that "a
party desiring changes in the con
tract must give 60 days notice to
the other party."
Neither side appeared particu
larly conciliatory in its official
statement. The union character
ized the University's response as:
"Takeaways on workers' job se
curity; a refusal to improve any
benefits; a refusal to even submit
a wage proposal; and the making
of new proposals without proper
notice."
Wheeler characterized the
union's proposals as "almost un
believeable. It is difficult to imag
ine any responsible employer
agreeing to them."
