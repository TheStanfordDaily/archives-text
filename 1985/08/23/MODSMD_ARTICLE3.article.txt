# University yet to make wage offer

### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
The latest round of bargaining sessions between
the University and United Stanford Workers ended
Wednesday with the University still having not
made a wage proposal.
"They want to get us where the contract is expir
ing and we'll do anything to get a contract," said
Mary Ann Tenuto, USWs chief negotiator. "We're
not going to do that."
As a result, prospects for a settlement before the
current contract ends Aug. 31 are looking bleaker.
The two sides meet again next Wednesday, with a
final meeting next Friday, one day before the con
tract expires. The University did propose meetings
today and Sunday.
"We asked to meet Friday and Sunday,' 1 said
Priscilla Wheeler, the University's chief negotiator.
"They declined to meet until Wednesday."
But Tenuto said, "They knew we couldn't meet
Friday. I'm in arbitration all day and couldn't meet.
Sunday is just really short notice. A lot of people
couldn't make it."
Tenuto again emphasized that USW wants to
avoid a strike if at all possible.
The union, Local 680 of the AFL-ClO's Service
Employees International Union, proposed wage in
creases of $5.8 million, almost a 1 7 percent increase
over current wage costs for the bargaining unit. The
University cited statistics from the Bureau of Na
tional Affairs that the median wage settlement this
year has been 4 percent.
However, Tenuto said, "We know that Stanford
has given a pay raise of 5 to 10 percent to all its
other employees."
Wheeler said, "We couldn't make a strong wage
proposal because we haven't discussed our (other)
proposals and their proposal would have a tremen
dous economic impact."
