# Vaccine may halt infection
## Urinary tract affliction affects 50 to 80 percent of females 
### LESLIE JONATH 
Urinary tract infections, a painful affliction
contracted by 50 to 80 percent of women
sometime during their lives, may someday be
prevented, thanks to work being conducted by
Stanford researchers.
Seventy percent of the infections occur in
women between the ages of 15 and 25, ac
cording to Dr. Peter O'Hanley, assistant pro
fessor of medicine in medical microbiology at
the Medical School.
"We see at least three or four cases a day,"
said Connie Starr, of Cowell Student Health
Center. The infections are common among
women after first intercourse and after a per
iod of sexual abstinence. Cases among men
are rare and only affect men in their late
60s, when prostitis is a common problem.
Victims of the infection can suffer high
fevers, back pains, irritability and increased
need to urinate.
The findings have identified the infectious
characteristics of the E. Coli bacteria and are
essential to the development of a vaccine for
humans.
Using recombinant DNA and synthetic
peptides, the researchers discovered the ge
netic similarities of the particular strains of E.
Coli bacteria that cause urinary tract infec
tions. E. Coli bacteria are known to cause 90

percent of such infections. Reproducing the
protein separately and then injecting it into
mice proved to be an effective vaccine, ac
cording to O'Hanley, who is one of the re
searchers.
"We have enough data at this time to
proceed in trials to see if we have a human
vaccine," said O'Hanley. "We are still a year
and a half away from serious trial and approx
imately five years away from a marketable
product."
A urinary tract infection may be confined to
the bladder. In a small percentage of women
though, the kidneys also become infected,
causing pyelonephritis. This condition may re
quire hospital treatment and can lead to blood
infections and, in some instances, to kidney
failure.
Antibiotics were considered an effective
treatment against these infections until re
searchers discovered that many strains of the
bacteria were becoming resistant. O'Hanley
hopes to avoid this problem in the develop
ment of the new vaccine. He and his col
leagues are designing vaccines that induce the
immune system to produce antibodies that
would inactivate the crucial proteins on infec
tious E. Coli bacteria. These specific proteins
enable the bacteria to cause infection and
invade the kidneys.

The researchers analyzed bacteria from the
urine of women with kidney infections and
bladder infections. They compared these with
samples from women with high levels of bac
teria in their urine and with the bacteria from
the stool of disease-free women. They found
that 100 percent of the E. Coli bacteria from
women with a kidney infection produced a
protein allowing the bacteria to latch onto
tissues lining the bladder and kidneys.
"These proteins might form the basis for a
broadly cross-reactive vaccine for the preven
tion of pyelonephritis (kidney infection),"
O'Hanley said.
Until the development of the vaccine, Starr
advises women to "drink plenty of liquids,
keep in good hygiene, clean after intercourse
and (if applicable) have the size of your
diaphragm checked."
The work was conducted in the laboratories
of Drs. Gary Schoolnik and Stanley Falkow.

and medical microbiology and chief of infec
tious diseases at the Palo Alto Veterans Ad
missions Medical Center. Falkow is professor
and chairman of medical microbiology. Other

Romero, Dr. David Lark and Dr. Kenneth
Vosti, professor of medicine.
