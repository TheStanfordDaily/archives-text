Assault investigation inactive^
The investigation of a July 16 strong-arm robbery
at the Law School is "inactive pending further
leads," said Capt. Raoul Niemeyer of the Stanford
police yesterday. "We were never able to put to
gether a composite . . . with the limited information
we have."
On July 19 The Daily reported that Barbara
Dray, associate dean for development at Stanford,
suffered a sprained neck and facial abrasions when
her purse was snatched at 7:30 p.m. July 16, in the
basement corridor of the Law School.
According to Stanford Police Capt. Marvin
Moore, Dray described her assailant as a muscular
black male, about 5-foot-10 to 6-0 tall and weighing
about 200 pounds, clean shaven, with short Afro
style hair, wearing a T-shirt, blue jeans and tennis
shoes. "It wasn't an attack in the sexual sense,"
Moore said, "but it was an attack on her person.
There was no weapon used other than physical
force."

Yearbook delayed again
The Stanford Quad may finally arrive in"the next
couple of weeks," said Photo Editor Norm Barnes,
after a third delay in late July, when the die that
stamps the covers broke.
The first delay, reported in mid-June, occurred'.
when the die struck the cover too hard and
destroyed the binding. Then in early July, the covers
"melted in the trucks" as they were being
transported from a subcontractor to Hunter
Publishing in North Carolina, said Barnes. "The
people were really stupid."
Hunter Publishing disclaims responsibility, pass
ing the blame to the cover manufacturer, Kingsport
Press in Tennessee.
Those who bought their yearbooks already will
receive them directly from North Carolina; Quad
staff will also be selling copies during registration
this fall. According to Barnes, a fall delivery is
planned for next year's book, which will include
Commencement.
