# Playboy uncovered
## 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
The Store at Tresidder Union altered its
original plans to attach a flier to copies of
the October issue of Playboy magazine as
Playboy released advance copies of the
issue to the media Wednesday.
The issue contains a pictorial called
"Girls of the Pac-10," which features
photographs of women from Pacific 10
Conference schools. Two women from
Stanford are featured, though both elected
not to have their real names appear in the
magazine.
The Store backed off from its proposal
to attach a flier co-written by Tresidder of
ficials and members of the student group
Stanford Students Opposed to Pornogra
phy to the cover of the magazine. T he
Store will instead have the fliers available
next to the counter for anyone wishing to
take one.
"We thought it best to put the literature
next to the register," Store Manager Cesar
Cervantes said. "That way, anyone who
wants to pick up the literature can. It
makes it available to everyone, not just the
people who purchase the magazine."
Threats of legal action did not force The
Store's hand, Cervantes said. "We didn't
want to infringe on Playboy's right not to
have anything attached to their magazine.
There wasn't going to be any legal action.
Playboy assured us of that."
The two Stanford women are identified
as C.C. Shanahan and Ramona Turner,
neither of which is a real name. Playboy
was given their real names, and Elaine Fox
of Playboy's publicity department said,
"We verified every name with the
registrar." v
Shanahan is photographed sitting next to
a bicycle wearing a blue Stanford T-shirt,
shorts, socks and running shoes. She is
holding a copy of Prof. Philip Zimbardo's
Psychology 1 textbook, "Psychology and
Life."
Turner is shown wearing a blue T-shirt
slipping off her shoulder â€” and nothing
else. Fox characterized the picture as a
nude shot. She is reclining around pillows
and a computer* apparently in her dorm
room.
Both are expected to appear at Playboy's
interview and autograph sessions next
week in the Bay Area, along with models
from UC-Berkeley. The first of those is
Tuesday at Waldenbooks on Shattuck Av
enue in Berkeley. The only session sched
uled on the Peninsula is Thursday at Tower
Book and Record on San Antonio Road in
Mountain View.
The October issue of Playboy is sched
uled to go on sale Tuesday. The Store is the
only outlet on campus that sells Playboy.
There are no plans to picket The Store
when the magazine goes on sale, according
to STOP member Vanessa Poster.
