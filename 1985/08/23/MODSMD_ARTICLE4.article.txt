# Playboy uncovered
## 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
The Store at Tresidder Union altered its
original plans to attach a flier to copies of
the October issue of Playboy magazine as
Playboy released advance copies of the
issue to the media Wednesday.
The issue contains a pictorial called
"Girls of the Pac-10," which features
photographs of women from Pacific 10
Conference schools. Two women from
Stanford are featured, though both elected
not to have their real names appear in the
magazine.
The Store backed off from its proposal
to attach a flier co-written by Tresidder of
ficials and members of the student group
Stanford Students Opposed to Pornogra
phy to the cover of the magazine. T he
Store will instead have the fliers available
next to the counter for anyone wishing to
take one.
"We thought it best to put the literature
next to the register," Store Manager Cesar
Cervantes said. "That way, anyone who
wants to pick up the literature can. It
makes it available to everyone, not just the
people who purchase the magazine."
Threats of legal action did not force The
Store's hand, Cervantes said. "We didn't
want to infringe on Playboy's right not to
have anything attached to their magazine.
There wasn't going to be any legal action.
Playboy assured us of that."
The two Stanford women are identified
as C.C. Shanahan and Ramona Turner,
neither of which is a real name. Playboy
