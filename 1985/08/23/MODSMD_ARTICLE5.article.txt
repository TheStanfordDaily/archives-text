# Group to monitor classes
## Accuracy in Academia fights 'brainwashing' 
### MARSH T. McCALL Editorial staff 
Left-wing Stanford professors may
soon have their classes monitored by a
new conservative group whose goal is to
end Marxist "misinformation and disin
formation" in classrooms that is
"brainwashing" America's youth.
Scholars and civil rights activists have
sharply criticized Accuracy in Academia
(AIA), which plans to begin monitoring
selected classes in September, saying the
group threatens academic freedom.
Malcolm Lawrence, president of the
organization, told The Daily that pro
testing academics are "paranoid."
"We consider classrooms to be open
forums," Lawrence said, "These
premature comments by faculty are
ridiculous. What are they afraid of?"
Lawrence explained that the group,
conceived two months ago but only ac
tive since last week, plans to use students
and alumni to monitor certain classes
and "ask probing questions," then pass
the information on to the organization
for publication in a group newsletter.
"We don't plan to ask for removal of
professors," Lawrence said. "At most
we will put articles in our newsletter and
student newspapers."
Executive director Les Csorba ex
plained that the monitoring process will
be conducted by volunteers who contact

the organization.
"Students will sit in on the classes,"
Csorba said Wednesday, "and if they
hear outrageous or false information,
we'll find out if it's correct, and (if the
report is correct) we'll talk to the profes
sor."

Csorba said the purpose of AIA is to
"balance" students' exposure to new
ideas. "Evidence suggests the perspec
tive is not balanced," Csorba said, citing
an example in which an unnamed profes
sor at a large state university told hisstu

dents that there is "more injustice in
America than there was in Nazi Ger
many."
Although the group has only been in
existence a short time, Csorba said it has
already received "hundreds of letters
from students who have witnessed in
doctrination by professors."
Political Science Prof. Hubert Mar
shall, who yesterday described the
group's activities as "a pain in the neck,"
was unimpressed by the amount of stu
dents response.
"I have no doubt they've received
'hundreds of letters,' " Marshall said.
" There are 240 million people in the na
tion."
Marshall, while describing AIA as "a
reincarnation of the McCarthy era, de
signed to intimidate faculty members"
doubted that the group's anti-Marxist
tactics would prove effective at Stanford.
"The University is not easily in
timidated," Marshall said.
Marshall added that he feels the
group's search for misinformation in the
classroom will be a waste of time.
"11 a professor begins using innac
curate information, some students will
challenge him," Marshall said.
Prof. John Manley was more adamant.
"That's all we need," he said Wednes
day, "a radical-right truth squad running
