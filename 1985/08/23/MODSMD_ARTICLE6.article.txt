## 54 of 137 die in jet takeoff accident 
### 
MANCHESTER, England — An engine exploded on a
British Airtours plane as it sped down the runway on
takeoff yesterday and flames swiftly engulfed the Boeing
737, killing 54 people. Eighty-three survived the inferno
and the panic of, the escape.
As the pilot brought the plane to a halt at the edge of
the runway, passengers leaped to the tarmac and stewards
flung people down escape chutes in the desperate minutes
before flames overtook them, survivors said.
The plane stopped about 300 yards from an airport fire
station and firemen reached the jet in minutes. Gil
Thompson, airport manager, said, however, that a severed
fuel line may have doused the twin-jet aircraft with fuel,
and that "it theri became really a towering inferno."
The plane was taking 131 package-tour passengers and
six crew members to Corfu in the Greek islands.
Survivor Keith Middleton, 21, of Liverpool, said that as
flames spread, ''everyone was screaming and shouting.
They were diving out of their seats, and everyone was
pushing. People* were falling onto the floor and getting
trampled on."
Prime Ministei" Margaret Thatcher flew to this industrial
city in northwest England at the end of her holiday in
Austria. She vieWed the wreckage and spent 75 minutes

comforting survivors.
Fifteen survivors were held at Manchester's Wythen
shawe Hospital, mainly for burns. The rest were released
after treatment for minor injuries and shock.
The Manchester Airport Authority said the jet was
roaring down the runway at about 100 mph just after 7
a.m., when the pilot radioed he had a problem with the
engine on his left wing.
Thompson said the pilot aborted the takeoff and
stopped the plane within 30 to 40 seconds, turning it into a
taxiway near an airport fire station. He said within minutes
seven fire engines were spewing foam onto the plane, but
still the fire raged out of control, billowing into the pas
senger compartment.
The airport authority said the first two firemen to enter
the plane were blown back to the ground by a second ex
plosion, later attributed to oxygen tanks exploding in the
rear of the aircraft.
Thompson said accident investigators believed the ex
plosion occurred in the engine's compression chamber. He
said the chamber is under great pressure during takeoff
"and for some unexplainable reason exploded."
"Parts of that (the engine debris) then went through the
wing, which of course has the fuel tanks," he said. "Once it

was ruptured, the fuel then saturated the total fuselage at
the rear."
The Civil Aviation Authority sent crash investigators
who searched the runway for clues to what caused the port
engine to explode. They said they had recovered the cock
pit voice recorder and two flight data recorders from the
burned tail section.
David Long, a spokesman for Pratt and Whitney
Aircraft in East Hartford, Conn., said it was too early to
tell what had occurred.
"It was our engines on that plane, JTAD-15," he said.
"We have a team over there participating in the investiga
tion with British authorities and the airline to analyze the
data to see what did happen."
He said the engine model has been in use since the early
1970s and has a very high reliability record.
"The people who got the worst of it were in the rear of
the plane," David Ashworth, another survivor who sat at
the front of the plane, said. "They got the worst of the
flames and the smoke and were trapped.
Four hours after it began, airport authorities announced
that all bodies had been removed from the charred
wreckage and the final death toll was 54.
