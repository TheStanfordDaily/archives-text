# Protests threatened as miners delay strike

### 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa â€”
The Rev. Allan Boesak, a fiery anti
apartheid leader who is president of the
World Alliance of Reformed Churches,
said yesterday that a protest would be held
in South Africa in a few days that would
"turn this country on its head."
He refused to disclose details to
reporters at a rally near Cape Town,
saying, "Restrain yourselves. Wait for that
moment which will come, and history will
record and the vVorld and the government
will know that all generations have come
together in one expression of our deter
mination to be free."
Boesak is a minister in the Dutch

Reformed Church and is of mixed race.
He said the protest would involve stu
dents, teachers and workers. That
prompted speculation the plan called for a
major act of civil disobedience by the
United Democratic Front alliance, in
which Boesak is a major figure. 1
South Africa's 150,000-member black
miners' union yesterday also delayed a'
strike over pay in the white-run country's
crucial gold and coal industries, and anti
apartheid riots flared in 14 black
townships.
Police reported the deaths of three
blacks in the scattered rioting, and also said
a black man who was arrested on drug

charges Aug. 14 was found dead in his cell.
He was at least the 11th black to die in
police custody in the past two years.
Police Commissioner Gen. Johan Coet
zee announced a ban on memorial services
marking the first anniversary of black
rioting that broke out last August. More
than 600 blacks have died in the continuing
unrest.
The number of activists imprisoned
without charge or access to lawyers in
South Africa's month-old state of emer
gency rose to more than 1,000 for the first
time in two weeks.
The National Union of Mineworkers
postponed for one week a strike scheduled

to start Sunday. The action was planned at
29 gold and coal mines that employ
230,000 black workers. Although union
membership is about 150,000, union offi
cials have said they expect non-members to
join a strike.
Gold and coal mines employ about
500,000 workers nationwide. Many of the
miners come from neighboring countries.
President Pieter Botha has threatened to
expel them in his campaign against racial
unrest.
The union estimates the average black
miner's pay is the equivalent of $175 a
month, compared with $1,000 for white
miners.
