U.S. insists Soviets used spy dust
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administration yesterday
brushed aside the Soviet Union's denial that it has used a chemi
cal agent to track American diplomats in Moscow, and rejected
any suggestion that the United States was trying to sabotage the
upcoming superpower summit.
"The evidence is there," State Department spokesman Charles
Redman insisted when asked about the Soviet rejection of the
charges made Wednesday. The tracing chemical allegedly was in
tended to monitor contacts between the diplomats and Soviet
citizens.
At the same time, Redman confirmed that the United States
had denied permission for three members of the Soviet consulate
in San Francisco to travel to nearby Daly City for a U.S.-Soviet
volleyball match at the Cow Palace.
Daly City is closed to Soviet officials, and Redman said no ex
ceptions will be made until Moscow makes good on its promise to
allow American officials to travel to off-limits areas in the Soviet
Union.
On the "spy dust" issue, the official Soviet news agency Tass
said yesterday that the Kremlin "resolutely rejects the absurd in
ventions that some chemical substances are being used against
personnel of U.S. establishments in the Soviet Union."
It was the first Soviet media acknowledgement of the U.S. ac
cusations that the Soviets have dramatically increased use of the
chemical compound, identified by the State Department as
NPPD, or nitrophenylpentadienal, and said to be a potential
cause of cancer.
Tass asserted the U.S. claims were made as part of a
"slanderous campaign against the Soviet Union, to poison the at
mosphere in relations between our two countries and to fan hos
tility toward Soviet people "
Victor Isakov, the No, 3 ranking official at the Soviet embassy
in Washington, went to the State Department yesterday to
deliver a verbal and written rebuttal to the U.S. accusations, ac
cording to a U.S. official who spoke on condition that he not be
identified.
Redman categorically rejected any suggestion of a relationship
between the timing of the announcement and the propaganda
war being waged by the United States and Soviet Union in ad
vance of the Nov. 19-20 summit between President Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Geneva. And he said normal
U.S.-Soviet contacts were continuing, such as Agriculture Secre
tary John Block's visit to Moscow, which begins today.
Koreas set first civilian exchange
PANMUNJOM, Korea — South and North Korea reached
agreement yesterday on plans for their first exchange of civilian
visitors since the peninsula was divided 40 years ago. The agree
ment raised hope of reunion for long-separated Korean families.
The visits will take place Sept 20 to 23, according to South
Korean Red Cross officials.
South Korean chief negotiator Song Yong-dae said each side
will send 50 civilians, most from the South Korean capital of
Seoul or the northern capital of Pyongyang, to the other side's
capital. Each side also will send 50 artists, 30 reporters, 20 guides
and the president of its Red Cross, Song said.
The agreement was reached at the third working-level meeting
of the two countries' Red Cross officials in the truce village of
Panmunjom, the officials said.
The exchange plan first was proposed in Red Cross talks in
Seoul in May.
Song said the exchange would give "a bright signal to reunion
of displaced family members."
An estimated 10 million Koreans are said to have been
separated from their families when the peninsula was divided
into Soviet and American zones of occupation after the occupy
ing Japanese army surrendered at the end of World War 11. The
division was perpetuated in the truce that ended the 1950-53
Korean War between Chinese- and Soviet-backed troops from
the North and U.N.-backed troops from the South.
