It's better to know what they're
like before you move in.
Livingtogether with someone for the first
time can be an "educational" experience.
And living with a long distance company
isn't any different. Because some companies
may not give you all the services you're used to
getting from AT&T.
For instance, with some companies you have
to spend a certain amount before you qualify for
their special volume discounts. With some
others, voice quality may vary.
But when you choose AT&T, there won't be
any surprises when you move in. You'll get the
same high-quality, trouble-free service you're
used to.
With calls that sound as close as next door.
Guaranteed 60% and 40% discounts off our Da}
Rate—so you can talk during the times you can
relax. Immediate credit for wrong numbers.
Operator assistance and collect calling.
So when you're asked to choose a long dis
tance company, choose AT&T. Because whether
you're into Mozart or metal, quality is the one
thing everyone can agree on.
