Comments
With second team All-PCAA
tackle Danny Clark not playing, the
interior defensive burden will rest
with Woadard, who led the Spartan
front line in tackles. Impeding his
path will be Coffie, a first-year
starter who has yet to play a down.
Walker, the Spartans' top rusher
and receiver, also leads the team in
scoring. Last year, his fumble in the
final minute cost San Jose State a
shot at a game-winning field goal
against Stanford. Soderlund, who
recovered Walker's fumble, is prob
ably the Cardinal's best defensive
player and will be given the chore of
stopping Walker up the middle.
Gilcrest, injured last year, has
re-claimed his starting role from his
sophomore year. In the two games
thus far, Gilcrest has recorded two
interceptions. He will be tested by
James, who will play for the first
time without deep-threat Emile
Harry on the other side.
Ranked 21st in total offense in
1983, Carlson returns after being
sidelined by an injury. Descibed as
"extremely intelligent" by Spartan
Head Coach Claude Gilbert,
Carlson possesses a strong arm
that will need solid protection.
"He's not a scrambler," admitted
Gilbert. Carlson will face a Cardinal
secondary which has improved its
questionable speed.
A battle of inexperience. Filling
in for two-year starter John
Aimonetti, considered as one of the
top lineman in the PCAA this
season, Barnard will confront first
string newcomer Lortie.
A two-year starter, Clark has
already begun the season well, with
two interceptions in the first two
games returning one for a touch
down. His afternoon will be kept
busy trying to stop the Cardinal's
All-American candidate Paye, who
will throw short, deep and often.
Allen, an excellent athlete, also
doubles as second string quarter
back and may decide to ignore his
assigned duty.
