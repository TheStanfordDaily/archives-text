# Stanford Edges SJS In a Close Shave
## September 22,1984 
### 
Coming off an impressive vic
tory over defending Big 10
champion Illinois, Stanford didn't
figure to have too much trouble
before the 70,426 fans at Stan
ford Stadium. It did.
The Cardinal appeared to have
matters well in hand when quar
terback John Paye snuck over
from a yard out to give Stanford
a 21-10 with only 1:28 left in the
first half.
However, a scant one minute
and two seconds later, the Card
inal lead had been trimmed to
three points. Spartan quarter
back Bob Frasco, who riddled
the Stanford defense for 333

the Cardinal deep into Spartan
territory. Then, using perfect
blocks from left guard Matt
Moran and wide receiver Jeff
James, Thomas Henley raced
into the end zone from 17 yards
out, putting Stanford ahead with
1:14 to go.
But Frasco wasn't through
with the Stanford defense yet,
quickly moving the Spartans to
the Cardinal 25, easily within the
range of kicker Luis Comesana.
"It was a horror story % for
me and the rest of the defense,"
Stanford linebacker Matt Soder
lund said. "We had a lot of mental
errors and we were not very ag
gressive."

yards, fired an 11-yard touch
down pass to Keith McDonald
and then completed a two-point
conversion to Rich Harbison.
In the second half, Frasco
continued his assault on the
Stanford secondary. His one
yard quarterback sneak put the
Spartans ahead 27-21 with eight
seconds left in the third quarter.
With only 3:19 remaining and
San Jose State still clinging to its
six-point lead, Stanford took
posession on its own 9-yard line.

With its back to the wall, the
Cardinal defense did get aggres
sive. Only 27 seconds remained
when tackle Garin Veris knocked
the ball loose from tailback
Randy Walker. Soderlund
pounced on the fumble, giving
Stanford a hard-fought victory.
For Cardinal Coach Jack El
way, it was the fourth con
secutive win in the Stanford-San
Jose State series. Elway had
beaten the Cardinal the previous
three years as the Spartan
coach. The victory extended
Stanford's advantage in the se
ries to 33-7-1.

It was a horror story for me and the
rest of the defense. We had a lot of
mental errors and we were not very
aggressive.
