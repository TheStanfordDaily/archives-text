# Is David Sweeney The Right Foot?

### PABLO MORALES 
A place-kicker isn't supposed to
knock heads with 270-pound
linemen. He also doesn't have to be
concerned with building strength by
lifting incredible amounts of weight.
In fact, a place-kicker is usually ex
empt from most of the normal,
everyday rigors that have become
rites of passage for most football
players.
Instead, he practices kicking
footballs through metal uprights.
Doesn't exactly sound too taxing,
does it?
But if you think those little
sidewinders have it easy, you're

wrong. His highly-specialized train
ing regimen puts him in unenviable
stead with those same linemen who
make a habit out of knocking heads
and lifting incredible amounts of
weight.
Constant verbal harassment from
those 100 pounds his superior is, in
most cases, worse than any back
breaking drill devised for the
practice gridiron.
David Sweeney, five-foot-11,
172-pound place-kicker for the
Stanford varsity football team stoi
cally calls such abuse "standard
treatment" for those assigned the
task of place-kicking.

The task itself appears basic
enough. It takes a little more than a
second to complete. But with 270-
pound linemen stomping about,
seemingly forgetful of the fact that
the kicker is not trained to knock
heads with them, it's anything but
easy.
However, no one made it look
easier at Stanford than Mark Har
mon. During his career on The
Farm, Harmon amassed 252 points,
including 50 field goals both
school records.
"I've definitely got big shoes to
filj," said sophomore Sweeney,
"but I can't be too preoccupied with
what someone else did. All I should
be concerned with is David
Sweeney's abilities. I can't let that
(Harmon's records) distract me."
On any given field-goal attempt,
there's plenty to distract a place
kicker: screaming crowds, yelling
players, on-rushing linemen, faulty
snaps, nervousness. The pressure
to concentrate is made more in
tense when condensed to a mere
second, when snap, hold, step, and
foot-placement have to be perfect.
It takes a level head, especially
when the game is on the line.
"Ideally, concentration should be
constant throughout," said
Sweeney. "I should approach a
first-quarter attempt the same way
as one late in the fourth with the
game on the line."
Level-headed? Better believe it.
With a slight southern drawl and
an easy-going demeanor, Sweeney
exudes an air of poise and confi
dence attributes rarely found in
those with such limited experience,
but which are vital for success in
the pressure-filled world of place
kicking.

Unlike many of his counterparts
who balance the pressure of their
position with eccentric behavior,
Sweeney remains level-headed in
his approach toward life on and off
the field. An economics major,
Sweeney enjoys golf and raquetball,
and has played piano for 13 years.
He has a wide range of musical
tastes: anywhere from the classical
Mozart to new wave groups such as
The Judys.
All this sounds pretty ordinary,
but there's nothing ordinary about
the way he kicks the football.
The coaching staff has set his
range at 55 yards, a distance easily
comparable with many in the pro
fessional ranks. This week he has
booted a pair of 52-yarders, and as
a junior at Highland Park High
School in Dallas, Texas, he con
nected on a 49-yard effort. Along
with place-kicking, Sweeney will
also handle the kick-off and short

rangel punting chores for the Card
inal this season.
There's no doubt that Sweeney
has a powerful leg, but it's
relatively untested in game situa
tions. Despite his inexperience,
Sweeney is perfectly aware of his
role on the team, even though he
usually works by himself.
"I usually get harassed about my
size and the kind of work I have to
do during practice, but that's OK,"
said Sweeney. "I know my role on
this team, and nothing will make me
feel any different."
Then he said with a smile, "The
joking around, well, that's standard
operational procedure. I think it's
their way of letting me know that
I'm part of this team. I'm sure they
wouldn't want to kick footballs all
practice long any more than I would
want to knock heads day after day."
Level-headed? You better
believe it.

Luckily, when deciding to perform a sideline concert, David
Sweeney chose to bring his saxophone. Another instrument he
plays well the piano would have been a little more difficult
to get on the field.

"I've definitely got big shoes to fill," Stanford place-kicker David
Sweeney said. The shoes to which Sweeney was referring
belong to this man, all-time Stanford scoring leader Mark Harmon.
