Teddy Taylor, a Spartan junior
college transfer and second-string
nose guard, gingerly rested his sub
stantial laurels on the trainer's table
and pondered the importance of this
week's game against the Cardinal.
"I'm kind of new around here,"
he said. "But since I've been here, the
Stanford game is what most every
one around here has been looking
forward to and talking about."
And in the last few years, the
Spartans have had a lot to discuss.
Witness San Jose State's 3-1 record
over Stanford in the last four con
tests, their previous three-game
win streak halted last year by a late
fourth quarter miscue that probably
cost them number four.
Indeed, the Spartans, perennial
powerhouses in the Pacific Confer
ence Athletic Association, have
earned the reputation as Pac-10
giant-slayers. No one in the Pac-10
takes them lightly. Problem is, San
Jose State does not take Stanford
lightly it's their biggest game of
the season.
"The coaches didn't have to say
much this week. We didn't need any
pep talks," explained junior Spartan
cornerback Stacey Gilcrest. 'When
we play Stanford, everyone gets
fired up on their own."

As any Cardinal supporter will at
test to, Stanford already has its
traditional game and rival carved in
the primitive form of a bear, not a
Spartan. Yet, the blue and yellow of
further south still see red when
they consider their traditional ad
versary.
Playing the Cardinal provides San
Jose State the opportunity to shine
in front 70,000 people, almost al
ways the largest crowd of their
season. What's more, it gives them
the chance "to claim the bragging
rights of Northern California", as
Spartan defensive end Wayne
Woodard put it.
"Definitely a big game for us
here. It's for the pride of the Bay
Area," continued Woodard. "It is
kind of interesting to play against
the coaches that recruited you."
One such coach is Stanford's
mentor, Jack Elway, the former
Spartan head coach. According to
San Jose State's sports director
Lawrence Fan, much of the San
Jose State fan interest "was
generated by the concurrent suc
cess of Jack Elway and John Elway"
when the two stood on opposite
sides of the field.
Now the senior Elway and
talented quarterback John Paye
reign at Stanford; nonetheless, the

Spartan intensity still burns,
sometimes accompanied by
nicatine.
"Last year before the Stanford
game, F walked by the coach's
room, and I saw coach Gilbert sit
ting by himself," said Gilcrest, who
sat out last year's game due to an
injury. "I've never seen him so ner
vous, sitting there, smoking a
cigerette. I didn't even know he
smoked."
Big crowds, Jack Elway, possibly
the Wave it all lends itself to the
Spartan-Stanford football rivalry,
but perhaps the biggest attraction
for San Jose State fans and players
alike is seeing the Cardinal
defeated, soundly if possible.
The Spartans, it seems, carry
somewhat of a chip on their
shoulder, viewing Stanford as a
spoiled school of opulence and
snobbish attitudes.
"We're a low budget ball club,
don't have the same luxuries. We
have guys just getting by," Gilcrest
said. "It's sort of like the rich kid in
the neighborhood, everyone wants
to beat up the rich kid."
Woodard echoed similiar senti
ments. "People at San Jose feel that
Stanford has its nose up in the air. I
think Stanford students don't feel

that San Jose State is up at the
same level, academically or
economically. It's the little guy on
the block against the big guy," he
said.
No matter who has the more
lunch money, Saturday's game
should keep with one football tradi
tion that has developed between
the two teams excitement. Even
Spartan Head Coach Claude Gil
bert, addressing past Cardinal and
Spartan confrontations, admitted,

"It's difficult to coach when you
want to watch as a fan. Fanatical ef
forts on both sides.
"I remenber when we sacked
John Elway four times in a row.
Football just doesn't get much more
exciting," Gilbert added emphati
cally.
By the end of the afternoon,
don't be surprised to see a little guy
trying to be a bully. He should be
the one as fierce and stubborn as a
bear.
