# Band Does Summer Review

(As you may have guessed, this article was written by
a member of the Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band.)
Gold and red leaves were dropping like bricks
from the trees that line my street. I discarded my
crippled umbrella in the direction of the neighbor's
cat and escaped cranial damage byway of a passing
garbage truck. It was obviously fall that time
each year that coaches warm up their teams, ven
dors heat up their hot dogs, and drum majors strike
up their bands.
Well, most drum majors, that is.
The other drum major, Andy Switky, fearing nei
ther divine nor University retribution, takes the op
portunity to festoon himself with all but the ordinary
and charge off to Stanford Stadium with the one and
only, truly incomparable Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity Marching Band in hot pursuit. No striking
this band. Not that the Band doesn't strike.

So here it is, ladies and gentlemen, a quick glance
at a couple of the summer's most kicked around
news stories.
Join us for the adventure of a lifetime as we
review the discovery of the Titanic by Band frogman
Edward M_. Beaux. We'll take you deep below the
Atlantic for a gala musical in the grand tradition of
Esther Williams.
Journey back to the U.S.A. with us as we disclose
Band White House correspondent Ed M'Bo's bold
and informative report on our president's summer
afflictions. Let the truth be known!
The Band is ready to dazzle the collegiate football
world with madcap musical mayhem. Let the dreary
suburban lanes of Palo Alto beware, as rock 'n' roll
fills the air and the Band is released like seething
bacteria into that veritable petri dish known as Stan
ford Stadium.
