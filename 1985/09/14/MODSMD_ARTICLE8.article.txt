# Cardinal Kicks Off '85 Against Spartans
## 
### TOM SENF 
The Stanford Cardinal begins a
new season today, taking on South
Bay rival San Jose State before an
expected crowd of 70,000 at Stan
ford Stadium.
The key word in that sentence is
new. As in:
A new offensive line.
New wide receivers.
A new defensive line.
A new secondary.
And even a new offense.
On the offensive line, four mem
bers of the 1984 unit are gone,
three of whom were drafted by the
N.F.L. Only right tackle John Barns
remains. The situation up front
became even worse when Kevin
Payne, who was slated to start at
left guard, was lost for the season
with a knee injury.
Besides Barns, Stanford's offen
sive linemen have started a
combined total of one game cen
ter Kurt Josephson in 1983 against
Arizona State. Because sop
homores Rob Coffin and Andy
Sinclair were redshirted last year,
neither has played a down for the
Cardinal. Right guard Tom Nye has
seen some action as a backup.
However, Barns doesn't believe
his linemates' inexperience will be a
problem. "I don't think it's going to
be as big a factor as everyone
says," he said. "We're going to get
better as we go along."
Getting better as things go along
is also the plan for the wide
receivers. Jeff James, whose 18
catches averaged more than 17
yards, is a definite starter, but the
other wideout slot is anything but
certain. The competitors include
Carl Morris, Henry Green and
Chris Chapman, among others.
Morris is the starter now, but he
by no means has the job locked up.
"We want one of them to rise above
the others," Elway said. "If that
doesn't happen, it means one of two
things either we've got a good
group or we've got nothing."

Stanford may have question
marks on the line and at receiver,
but there is no such uncertainty at
either quarterback or running back.
Both positions are well-stocked
with talent.
The Cardinal attack will be run by
junior signal-caller John Paye. Last
year, Paye was leading the Pacific
10 Conference in passing and total
offense when he was sidelined for
four games with a broken finger.
Another finger injury kept him out
of a fifth game.
Calling last year "a fluke", Paye
is healthy and ready to go. "Both
fingers are healed," he said. "We're
getting tired of watching the other
college teams play."
Running back is the deepest posi
tion on the team. Fullback Brad
Muster was the leading freshman
rusher in the nation last year,
averaging 91.4 yards per game. His
823 yards led Stanford by a wide
margin.
Muster also paced the Cardinal in
receiving with 31 catches. "I think if
he wanted to play at wide receiver,
he'd be our best wide receiver," El
way said.
Tailback Thomas Henley is also a
multi-talented performer. He was
third on the team in both rushing
and receiving in 1984. Ten of his 22
receptions came in a 34-19 Stanford
win against Illinois, earning him
Sports Illustrated Offensive Player
of-the-Week honors.
"He's equal to any athlete on the
entire team," Elway said. "He has
great speed and can catch the foot
ball."
To take full advantage of his
quarterback's ability and his running
backs' versatility, Elway has
devised a new offensive formation
that the Cardinal is expected to use
occasionally today. It involves two
wide receivers, three running
backs and no tight ends.
It is a short passing game called
the 90 Series. The two halfbacks
line up a yard behind and a yard

outside the tackles, leaving only the
fullback in the backfield. In addition
to the basic short passes, Stanford
will run sweeps, counters and
screens from the formation.
The success of the 90 Series will
depend on the ability of Paye and
his receivers to read defenses and
make adjustments in their routes.
In this respect, it is very similar to
the run-and-shoot offense that
Mouse Davis used effectively at
Portland State and in the U.S.F.L.
Davis also brought the run-and
shoot to Cal during the Roger
Theder years, but the Bears didn't
have the talent to execute the of
fense properly:
The 90 Series has many advan
tages. It will give Paye at least four

and sometimes five targets to
choose from on every pass play. It
will allow Elway to use tailback
Kevin Scott as well as Henley.
Scott, the second leading Cardinal
rusher in 1984, has improved his
receiving dramatically this fall.
The quick passes will also take
some of the pressure off the offen
sive line. Paye will be taking a lot of
short drops, meaning that the
linemen will not have to sustain
their blocks as long as they would if
Paye were throwing longer drop
back passes.
Finally, the 90 Series should
enable the Cardinal to move the ball
down the field steadily in small
chunks. "We have to have a consis
tent routine second-and-five,
third-and-four," Paye said. "We
have to stay away from penalties
and third-and-ten situations where
we need the big play."
Defensively, Stanford has only
three returning starters, none on
the defensive line. Only nose guard
Eric Volta has significant experi
ence. Still, there is cause for op
timism.
"I'm more enthused about the
defensive line than I was in the
spring," Elway said. "(Left tackle)
Sean Scheller has size, speed and
quickness. He should be an out
standing defensive tackle."
The right side of the Cardinal line
will be anchored by junior tackle Joe
Lortie. Elway is also hoping for
contributions from two promising
freshmen, Ray Huckestein and Tim
Roggeman.
Unlike the two lines, which were
solid units decimated by graduation,
the secondary was Stanford's most
consistent weakness last season.
The Cardinal pass defense was the
worst in the Pac-10 last year,- sur

rendering 227.2 yards per game
through the air.
Elway believes that a year of ex
perience with his defensive system
should improve the secondary.
"They should be more solid and
more familiar with our coverages
and overall defensive scheme," he
said.
Increased speed has been a high
priority with the Cardinal defensive
backs this year. Cornerbacks Toi
Cook and Walt Harris have lowered
their times in the 40-yard dash to
4.5 seconds, with safeties Mark
Hashimoto and Brad Humphreys
cutting theirs to 4.7 seconds.
"Our main thrust is to get more
quickness in the defense," Elway
said. "I've always found it difficult
to coach speed."
In his team's opener two weeks
ago at Berkeley, San Jose State
Coach Claude Gilbert found it diffi
cult to coach anything, as the Spar
tans were dominated in every
phase of the game. The result was
a 48-21 loss to the Bears.
"There were some strange
forces working against us," Gilbert
said. "We were tired, sluggish,
slow. It was awful."
San Jose State bounced back last
week to trounce New Mexico State
32-3, but Gilbert, who was Elway's
defensive coordinator before the
Stanford coach came north, wasn't
completely satisfied. "We played
better against New Mexico State,
but we're still searching for the de
fensive play we're accustomed to,"
he said.
Elway hopes the search contin
ues after today. "I enjoyed my five
years coaching there, and I have a
high regard for San Jose State Uni
versity," he said. "But I have no
reservations as to who should win
this football game."

The formation for the 90 Series, Stanford's version of the run-and-shoot offense.


Jill Gilbert/Daily
More than a punishing runner, Stanford fullback Brad Muster is also a capable receiver. His 31
catches led the Cardinal last season. Muster's versatility is typical of the Stanford running backs,
a quality Coach Jack Elway intends to take full advantage of this year.
The Stanford Cardinal begins a
new season today, taking on South
Bay rival San Jose State before an
expected crowd of 70,000 at Stan
ford Stadium.
The key word in that sentence is
new. As in:
A new offensive line.
New wide receivers.
A new defensive line.
A new secondary.
And even a new offense.
On the offensive line, four mem
bers of the 1984 unit are gone,
three of whom were drafted by the
N.F.L. Only right tackle John Barns
remains. The situation up front
became even worse when Kevin
Payne, who was slated to start at
left guard, was lost for the season
with a knee injury.
Besides Barns, Stanford's offen
sive linemen have started a
combined total of one game cen
ter Kurt Josephson in 1983 against
Arizona State. Because sop
homores Rob Coffin and Andy
Sinclair were redshirted last year,
neither has played a down for the
Cardinal. Right guard Tom Nye has
seen some action as a backup.
However, Barns doesn't believe
his linemates' inexperience will be a
problem. "I don't think it's going to
be as big a factor as everyone
says," he said. "We're going to get
better as we go along."
Getting better as things go along
is also the plan for the wide
receivers. Jeff James, whose 18
catches averaged more than 17
yards, is a definite starter, but the
other wideout slot is anything but
certain. The competitors include
Carl Morris, Henry Green and
Chris Chapman, among others.
Morris is the starter now, but he
by no means has the job locked up.
"We want one of them to rise above
the others," Elway said. "If that
doesn't happen, it means one of two
things either we've got a good
group or we've got nothing."

Stanford may have question
marks on the line and at receiver,
but there is no such uncertainty at
either quarterback or running back.
Both positions are well-stocked
with talent.
The Cardinal attack will be run by
junior signal-caller John Paye. Last
year, Paye was leading the Pacific
10 Conference in passing and total
offense when he was sidelined for
four games with a broken finger.
Another finger injury kept him out
of a fifth game.
Calling last year "a fluke", Paye
is healthy and ready to go. "Both
fingers are healed," he said. "We're
getting tired of watching the other
college teams play."
Running back is the deepest posi
tion on the team. Fullback Brad
Muster was the leading freshman
rusher in the nation last year,
averaging 91.4 yards per game. His
823 yards led Stanford by a wide
margin.
Muster also paced the Cardinal in
receiving with 31 catches. "I think if
he wanted to play at wide receiver,
he'd be our best wide receiver," El
way said.
Tailback Thomas Henley is also a
multi-talented performer. He was
third on the team in both rushing
and receiving in 1984. Ten of his 22
receptions came in a 34-19 Stanford
win against Illinois, earning him
Sports Illustrated Offensive Player
of-the-Week honors.
"He's equal to any athlete on the
entire team," Elway said. "He has
great speed and can catch the foot
ball."
To take full advantage of his
quarterback's ability and his running
backs' versatility, Elway has
devised a new offensive formation
that the Cardinal is expected to use
occasionally today. It involves two
wide receivers, three running
backs and no tight ends.
It is a short passing game called
the 90 Series. The two halfbacks
line up a yard behind and a yard

outside the tackles, leaving only the
fullback in the backfield. In addition
to the basic short passes, Stanford
will run sweeps, counters and
screens from the formation.
The success of the 90 Series will
depend on the ability of Paye and
his receivers to read defenses and
make adjustments in their routes.
In this respect, it is very similar to
the run-and-shoot offense that
Mouse Davis used effectively at
Portland State and in the U.S.F.L.
Davis also brought the run-and
shoot to Cal during the Roger
Theder years, but the Bears didn't
have the talent to execute the of
fense properly:
The 90 Series has many advan
tages. It will give Paye at least four

and sometimes five targets to
choose from on every pass play. It
will allow Elway to use tailback
Kevin Scott as well as Henley.
Scott, the second leading Cardinal
rusher in 1984, has improved his
receiving dramatically this fall.
The quick passes will also take
some of the pressure off the offen
sive line. Paye will be taking a lot of
short drops, meaning that the
linemen will not have to sustain
their blocks as long as they would if
Paye were throwing longer drop
back passes.
Finally, the 90 Series should
enable the Cardinal to move the ball
down the field steadily in small
chunks. "We have to have a consis
tent routine second-and-five,
third-and-four," Paye said. "We
have to stay away from penalties
and third-and-ten situations where
we need the big play."
Defensively, Stanford has only
three returning starters, none on
the defensive line. Only nose guard
Eric Volta has significant experi
ence. Still, there is cause for op
timism.
"I'm more enthused about the
defensive line than I was in the
spring," Elway said. "(Left tackle)
Sean Scheller has size, speed and
quickness. He should be an out
standing defensive tackle."
The right side of the Cardinal line
will be anchored by junior tackle Joe
Lortie. Elway is also hoping for
contributions from two promising
freshmen, Ray Huckestein and Tim
Roggeman.
Unlike the two lines, which were
solid units decimated by graduation,
the secondary was Stanford's most
consistent weakness last season.
The Cardinal pass defense was the
worst in the Pac-10 last year,- sur

rendering 227.2 yards per game
through the air.
Elway believes that a year of ex
perience with his defensive system
should improve the secondary.
"They should be more solid and
more familiar with our coverages
and overall defensive scheme," he
said.
Increased speed has been a high
priority with the Cardinal defensive
backs this year. Cornerbacks Toi
Cook and Walt Harris have lowered
their times in the 40-yard dash to
4.5 seconds, with safeties Mark
Hashimoto and Brad Humphreys
cutting theirs to 4.7 seconds.
