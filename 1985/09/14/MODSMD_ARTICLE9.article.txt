# Year in Review
## The 						Second Elway Era Begins 
### TOM SENF 
Did Stanford have a good football season in
1984?
The answer to that question depends on
whether one is a pessimist or an optimist.
A pessimist would argue that Stanford's 5-
6 record was the Cardinal's fourth con
secutive losing campaign and that only nar
row wins against San Jose State and lowly
Oregon State kept that mark from being
worse. Also, Stanford finished 3-5 in the
Pacific 10 Conference, tied for seventh place
with Oregon.
However, an optimist would point out that
the five Cardinal wins represent a 400 per
cent increase in victories over the previous
season, when Stanford went 1-10. The Card
inal's four : game improvement was tied for
fifth best in the nation. Had Stanford not
blown a 28-point lead against Washington
State, it would have had a winning season.
Finally, in terms of total winning
percentage, the Cardinal was up against the
toughest schedule in the Pac-10 and the
seventh toughest in the nation.
Oklahoma 19, Stanford 7
The "Jack Elway Era" began with a bang as
the Cardinal shocked the crowd of 75,008 at
Memorial Stadium in Norman by driving 71
yards in nine plays to take a 7-0 lead just 2:04
into the game. John Paye connected with
tight end Greg Baty on a 7-yard scoring toss.
Unfortunately, that was all the scoring
Stanford did for the day, as the Oklahoma
defense, led by Ail-Americans Kevin Murphy
and Tony Casillas, dominated the remainder
of the game.
After the Sooners took a 13-7 lead with
four seconds left in the first half, the Cardinal
defense held the vaunted Oklahoma wishbone
to two field goals the rest of the way.

Stanford 34, Illinois 19
The home opener against the defending
Big 10 champion was probably Stanford's
most impressive outing of the year. Mark
Harmon's 57-yard field goal on the final play
of the first half gave the Cardinal a 24-13 lead.
The Illini never got any closer.
The Stanford offense rolled for 427 yards,
led by Paye and tailback Thomas Henley.
Paye threw for 295 yards and two touch
downs, while Henley caught 10 passes for
151 yards and added 51 yards rushing. Hen
ley's performance earned him Sports Il
lustrated Offensive Player-of-the-Week
honors.
Stanford 28, San Jose State 27
Before a crowd of 70,426 at Stanford
Stadium, the Cardinal pulled out a thrilling
last-minute win over the determined Spar
tans.
With 3:19 left, San Jose State led 27-21.
But Stanford needed only 2:05 to drive 91
yards, scoring on a 17-yard run by Henley.
The Spartans then drove to the Cardinal 25,
but linebacker Matt Soderlund recovered a
Randy Walker fumble with 27 seconds left to
pull it out for Stanford.
Arizona State 28, Stanford 10
There was bad news, and there was worse
news on this late September day at Stanford
Stadium.
The bad news was that the Cardinal was
thoroughly beaten by the Sun Bevils in its
Pac-10 opener.
The worse news was that Paye was lost
for four games when he broke his right index
finger on the first play of the final quarter.
Throwing to wide receiver Emile Harry,

Paye hit his hand on the helmet of ASU's
Tom Gerber. Paye did lead Stanford to a
touchdown on the drive, but he was unable to
finish the game.
Stanford 23, UCLA 21
With Paye out, Stanford appeared to be in
for a long day at the Rose Bowl, but the
defense and a freshman fullback named Brad
Muster emerged to lead the Cardinal to the
win.
A 22-yard touchdown pass from quarter
back Fred Buckley to Jeff James gave Stan
ford a 20-0 lead, but the Cardinal had to hang
on as the Bruins stormed back in the second
half to draw within two.
The game marked the debut of Muster,
who ran for 82 yards. By the end of the year,
he had been named to the All Pac-10 Second
Team. "Brian Morris started against Okla
homa, then he had an ankle injury," Muster
said. "Then Kaulana Park ran in there and
had knee problems. By UCLA, I was the only
guy left."
Washington 37, Stanford 15
A combination of early turnovers and the
second-ranked Huskies proved to be too
much for the Cardinal, as it suffered its only
real blowout of the year.
After taking a 3-0 lead in the first quarter,
Stanford gave the ball away five times before
halftime. By the intermission, Washington
had put the game away with 27 unanswered
points.
Washington State 49, Stanford 42

After its most lopsided loss of the season,
Stanford was handed its most disappointing.
Only 33,000 saw the home team squander a
28-point lead that's right, a 28-point lead
in the final 20 minutes of play.

The Cardinal took a 28-7 advantage into
the locker room at halftime when Chris
Weber recovered a blocked Cougar punt in
the end zone. Then, only 1:15 into the third
quarter, Kevin Scott scored to put Stanford
ahead by four touchdowns.
WSU scored to make the score 35-14, but
a 70-yard touchdown run by Scott put the
game seemingly out of reach. Then Rueben
Mayes took over.
The Cougar halfback, who ran for 216
yards, reached the Cardinal end zone four
times in the next 18 minutes. His final trip
across the goal line, a 22-yard run with three
minutes left, capped the amazing comeback.
Stanford 28, Oregon State 21
After spotting the Beavers a 21-point first
quarter lead, the Cardinal roared back a la
Washington State to record the win.
With 7:35 remaining in the game, Stan
ford's Mike Noble nailed OSU quarterback
Rickey Greene in the Beaver end zone for a
safety, putting the Cardinal ahead 22-21.
On the ground, Muster singlehandedly out
gained the Beavers by 109 yards, 137 to 28,
but Stanford needed a game-saving intercep
tion in the final seconds by Eric Price to seal
the victory.
use 20, Stanford 11
To get Stanford Stadium ready for Super
Bowl XIX the following January, this game
was played under the lights. On the field, the
Trojans turned out the lights on the Cardinal
offense, stopping Muster on a fourth down
play from the one yard line that would have
put Stanford ahead in the third quarter.
Paye returned to the Cardinal lineup, but
he misfired on all four of his pass attempts
before being forced back to the sidelines by
another injured finger on his throwing hand.

"I still think about the way we ran right over their asses," Stanford tackle John
Barns said of the 1984 Big Game. No doubt his teammates and the Stanford
fans will remember it for quite some time as well.

No, Mike, you're not dreaming the scoreboard really reads Washington State
49, Stanford 42. About an hour earlier, the score had been 42-14 Stanford. The
Cougars' incredible rally cost the Cardinal a winning season.
Arizona 28, Stanford 14
A quarterback sack is a fairly
usual occurrence in a football game,
but a punter sack is anything but
commonplace. Yet that's what hap
pened to Stanford on this night in
Tucson not once, not twice, but
three times.
On three different occasions,
punter Doug Robison was tackled
before he could get the ball away,
resulting in 10 rather cheap points
for the Wildcats.

Stanford 27, California 10
The 87th Big Game was a sweet
one for Stanford, as the Cardinal
brought the Axe back to the Farm
after a three-year absence with a
convincing victory.
The second half was dominated
by the Cardinal defense and running
game. While two Toi Cook inter
ceptions throttled the Bear attack,
Stanford's veteran offensive line
ripped huge holes in the Cal
defense. The result was 322 yards
rushing, 204 by Muster and another
102 by Henley.
"I still think about the way we ran
right over their asses," tackle John
Barns said.
