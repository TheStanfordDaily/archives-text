STANFORD MEMORIAL CHURCH
Welcomes You
"Human life at all times needs to be nourished by the dimension of experience called 'spiritual.' Our need for friendship
based on caring and mutual trust, for a sense of significance in our life and work, is always pressing. Many who seek
meaning in wealth, technological achievement and professional standing are lonely and empty.
"The Church in the University addresses its message to this experience of spiritual need. It argues that there is a solid
satisfaction and a rest for the restless heart — in God, who may be trusted and should be worshipped. The Church
contends that a recovery of this relationship with God is the one sure remedy for the boredom and emptiness of our times,
the strongest base for developing integrated individual identity and caring human community."
Robert Hamer ton-Kelly > Dean
