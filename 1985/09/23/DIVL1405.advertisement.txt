INTRODUCTORY
DECISION ANALYSIS
• — EES 31
This course is intended to transform the way participants conceive of decision
making and to empower them to make important decisions in their personal
and professional lives. Decision analysis has grown over the last two decades
from a mathematical theory to a powerful professional discipline used by
virtually every industry and profession. Formerly available only to graduate
students, the course content has been redesigned to eliminate the need for a
calculus or probability prerequisite by reformulating rather than watering down
the methods of analysis.
• This course meets the undergraduate distribution requirement in Area B,
Technology and Applied Science.
• 3 units, TTh 11:00-12:15, McCullough 134, Professor R. Howard
• For more information, call 497-4168 or stop by Terman 306.

So come by Old Union 306 for all your academic concerns
... before you lose that direction!
