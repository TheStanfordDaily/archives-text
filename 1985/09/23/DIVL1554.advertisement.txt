FULFILLS AREA 6, 7, 8 DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS
This sequence is intended for undergraduates not majoring in engineering, the
natural sciences, or mathematics. It seeks to convey a better understanding of the
character and interrelationships of technology, mathematics and science, enhance
ability to think quantitatively, and build confidence and skills necessary to treat
quantitative questions that confront people intending to comprehend and influence
contemporary society. It covers a large amount of material, moves rapidly, and builds
understanding of concepts and styles of thought rather than developing the type of
skills needed by the practitioner.
The sequence was taught last year for the first time and was extremely successful.
Students seeking to fulfill distribution requirements must take the entire sequence in
order, although not necessarily in the same year. Information on the sequence is
available either form the instructors, or in the V.T.S.S. proram office in building 370.
