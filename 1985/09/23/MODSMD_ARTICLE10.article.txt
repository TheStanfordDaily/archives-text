## Student Must Buy Degree 
### 
Receiving a degree from a
school as reputable as Stanford is
quite an achievement. At least
that's what I thought until I
recently received a letter from the
Graduate Program Office insisting
that, although I had satisfied all the
academic requirements for a
master's degree and paid the full
tuition for every course I had
taken, an obscure and rather arbi
trary requirement necessitated
that I dish out $1,650 if I expected
to graduate in three weeks.
I was, in effect, being pressured
to buy my degree.
I entered Stanford in the fall of
1984 as a graduate student in the
Physics Department. During my
first quarter, I arranged with my
department to pursue a course of
study that would lead to a master's
degree after one year. My course
load was nine units per quarter for
four quarters, and, after complet
ing the 36 units, I was to receive
my master's in September 1985.
I survived all the course work
and was ready to graduate when,
just three weeks before the sched
uled conferral of my degree, the
Graduate Program Office dropped
me a little note saying that I owed
Stanford $1,650 and had better pay
up if I wanted my little piece of

paper. I thought that this surely
must have been some kind of
mistake since I had already paid
the tuition for the 36 units I had
taken toward my degree. But
when I checked it out, the charge
turned out to be no joke. Ap
parently, to obtain a masters
degree from Stanford, one must
satisfy what is called the
"residency requirement." The
people in the Graduate Program
Office claimed that the require
ment was clearly spelled out in the
literature and that, until I forked
over the $1,650, I had failed to
satisfy it. This requirement was so
clearly spelled out, as a matter of
fact, that my department ap
parently knew nothing about it!
The residency requirement does
exist. I found it in a little brochure
after poring over the literature that
evening. It states: "The residence
(tuition) requirement is at least
three quarters of full-time study in
the Graduate Division at Stanford."
What it does not state is what is
really meant by full tuition. I had
paid tuition for four quarters of
what this same brochure earlier
describes as a full-time program —
nine units of graduate coursework
plus research and teaching duties,
the standard load for graduate
physics students. When I re
inquired about this at the Graduate
Program Office, they claimed that,
in spite of what my department

stipulates, Stanford considers
full-time study to be that which is
covered by 12 units of tuition.
Still I was confused. Full tuition
for three quarters should then
cover 36 units. For four quarters I
had paid nine units worth of tuition.
Shouldn't the 36 units I paid for
satisfy the so-called residency
requirement? The reply was once
again "No." In spite of what a
rational human might think, nine
units of tuition per quarter does
not cost three quarters of 12 units
of tuition per quarter. It costs less.
So by spreading my 36 units over
four quarters instead of three, I
had unwittingly saved $1,650 — the
money that Stanford now wants
before they give me a diploma
certifying that I have completed 36
units of coursework that I have
already paid for!
Apparently, the residency re
quirement sets a minimum dollar
amount that the University will
accept before graduating you. I am
afraid, however, that, if they want
me to buy my degree, they will
have to forget it. I know in my own
mind that I have accomplished (and
paid for) a challenging course of
study. If it were just a diploma I
wanted, I Would order one from
the back of a matchbook cover and
save a few bucks.
