## Playboy Is Not Really Porn 
### 
Several points need to be made regarding the
anti-Playboy protest on the Stanford campus.
First, Playboy and similar magazines are not
"pornographic," not even by the faintest stretch
of the imagination.
Pornography, as defined by the courts, in
volves depicting sexual action between a man

VIEWPOINT

and a woman. (Certain "unnatural" acts may also
be considered pornographic)."Cheesecake,"
"nudity" and "adult material" — we may use any
of these terms to describe magazines like
Playboy. And we may like them or dislike them.
But to call them "pornographic" is a misuse of
the term. This is demonstrated by the fact that
pornography is illegal. Playboy would hardly fall
into this catagory.
Furthermore, these anti-Playboy protesters
are degrading women — the thousands of intelli
gent women who have freely chosen to pose for
Playboy and similar magazines. These
magazines are also read by thousands, and pos
sibly millions, of women, and many of the major
editors are women. What right do these
protesters have to assume that they have a spe
cial "pipeline" to the truth, enabling them to
think for these thousands of "poor, misguided
women" who work for and read these
magazines? The protesters' attitude is totally in
sulting and degrading to their "sisters."
A major assumption underlying these protests
is that women are forced to pose for magazines

like Playboy. In an age when women have en
tered every field — from construction worker to
Supreme Court justice — this assumption is
laughably misguided. Female Stanford
graduates, among the privileged elite of the
earth, have succeeded in all occupational and
personal areas, and they will continue to do so in
the future. To claim that these women are
forced into narrow or lowly work of any nature is
totally ludicrous. The amount of money these
women receive for posing is not enough to make
a small dent in one year's tuition at Stanford. So
they pose for basically one reason — they enjoy
doing it and are proud of their feminine beauty.

What right do these protesters have to assume that
they have a special 'pipeline' to the truth?

the anti-Playboy protesters also conveniently
ignore the major national magazines featuring
naked men.Playgirl, among others, is well estab
lished and read by millions of women. Magazines
featuring naked men are acceptable to the
protesters, while magazines featuring naked
women are unacceptable. This suggests that
these protesters have serious problems toward
women and their bodies.
Fortunately, in contrast to the apparent goals
of the protesters, we live in a pluralistic soci
ety. On every newsstand there are magazines for
business women, magazines such as Ms.,

magazines for housewives, as well as the male
"beefcake" magazines mentioned above. These
magazines express the multiple aspects of a
woman's nature. Fixation on only one of these
aspects by these anti-Playboy protesters seems
to imply serious psychological problems.
Greasiest of all. finally, is the attitude of the
Stanford campus store management. They self
righteously distribute anti-Playboy literature
along with each copy of the magazine they sell. If
the magazine is so terrible, why don't they
simply stop selling it? This would obviously be
unprofitable. So here we see the ultimate hypoc
risy. This should not be confused with freedom

of the press, where there is an obligation to pres
ent all sides of an issue. Business management,
apart from the profit motive, is in no way
obligated to sell anything that they find objec
tionable.
Overall, the plight of these anti-Playboy
protesters is not as hopeless as it may seem.
Following a simple three-step formula may even
tually allow them to rejoin the ranks of
reasonable, civilized society. The formula is as
follows: 1) stop squawking, 2)try to learn some
thing, 3)develop the ability to think.
