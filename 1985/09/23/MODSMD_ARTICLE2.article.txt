Negotiations between the University and the
Jnited Stanford Workers (USW), underway
ince August, have not resulted in "agreement
in any substantive issues," according to Univer
ity Negotiator Priscilla Wheeler.
The previous contract expired Aug. 31.
According to Wheeler, "the real focus of all
lis disagreement" is a dispute over the Univer
ity's right to contract out bargaining-unit work.
The University has proposed a relaxation of
le language in paragraph 94 of the former con
"act, which limits the University's use of non
argaining-unit employees.
An educational institution such as Stanford
annot function with the same strict job descrip

tions present in auto factories, Wheeler said.
The recent decline in research grants also
necessitates that the University have more
flexibility in management, she said.
According to Wheeler, revising paragraph 94
could also prevent unnecessary lay-offs of union
workers.
However, the union plans to "stand firm on
the job security issue," according to USW Chief
Negotiator Mary Ann Tenuto. Tenuto said she
feels the University's position on the matter is an
attempt to take away union members' rights by
drasticouv weakening the union's power.
"They're trying to accomplish this year what
they couldn't accomplish a year ago," Tenuto
said, citing workers' 782 to 424 vote in favor of
union representation last year.
The union's demands also include a general

wage increase of eight percent of current salary
or $168, whichever is greater, along with three
other wage proposals that target specific bar
gaining unit divisions.
These consist of adjustments in the promotion
scale, a realignment of wages for those Stanford
employees earning 15 percent or more below
the Bay Area average and a comparable worth
plan to make the salary of the biological tech
nicians in the medical center — mostly women
— equal to those of other campus and SLAC
technicians. USW is also pushing for medical
coverage for dependents and a divestment of its
pension funds from companies doing business in
South Africa. All of USW's wage proposals are
for one year.
