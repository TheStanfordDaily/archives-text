# Labor Negotiations Stagnate
## 
### JOYA WESLEY Senior staff writer 
Negotiations between the University and the
Jnited Stanford Workers (USW), underway
ince August, have not resulted in "agreement
in any substantive issues," according to Univer
ity Negotiator Priscilla Wheeler.
The previous contract expired Aug. 31.
According to Wheeler, "the real focus of all
lis disagreement" is a dispute over the Univer
ity's right to contract out bargaining-unit work.
The University has proposed a relaxation of
le language in paragraph 94 of the former con
"act, which limits the University's use of non
argaining-unit employees.
An educational institution such as Stanford
annot function with the same strict job descrip

tions present in auto factories, Wheeler said.
The recent decline in research grants also
necessitates that the University have more
flexibility in management, she said.
According to Wheeler, revising paragraph 94
could also prevent unnecessary lay-offs of union
workers.
However, the union plans to "stand firm on
the job security issue," according to USW Chief
Negotiator Mary Ann Tenuto. Tenuto said she
feels the University's position on the matter is an
attempt to take away union members' rights by
drasticouv weakening the union's power.
"They're trying to accomplish this year what
they couldn't accomplish a year ago," Tenuto
said, citing workers' 782 to 424 vote in favor of
union representation last year.
The union's demands also include a general

wage increase of eight percent of current salary
or $168, whichever is greater, along with three
other wage proposals that target specific bar
gaining unit divisions.
These consist of adjustments in the promotion
scale, a realignment of wages for those Stanford
employees earning 15 percent or more below
the Bay Area average and a comparable worth
plan to make the salary of the biological tech
nicians in the medical center — mostly women
— equal to those of other campus and SLAC
technicians. USW is also pushing for medical
coverage for dependents and a divestment of its
pension funds from companies doing business in
South Africa. All of USW's wage proposals are
for one year.
Stanford's wage offer, made
Sept. 19, is a three-year proposal
with increases of three percent in
the first year and two percent in
each of the following years.
Wheeler maintains that the delay of
the wage offer was due to the eco
nomic impact of the other un
resolved proposals along with the
belief that negotiations after con
tract expiration would be more pro
ductive.
The expired contract is still being
honored, in compliance with labor
laws, but the University has
stopped deducting union dues from
workers' paychecks and the no
stike clause is no longer in effect.
USW took a strike authorization
vote Sept. 17 that enables union of
ficials to seek strike sanctions from
its two Central Labor Councils and
from the Service Employees Inter
national Union (SEIU). USW still
says it wants to avoid a strike.
In 1982, USW workers did stike
as the result of a stalemate caused
by a similar chain of events. The
bargaining, conducted under the di
rection of a federal mediator, found
both sides unwilling to compromise.
The strike lasted 30 days and was

the longest in Stanford history.
The strike ended when the union
voted to accept a University pro
posal that differed little from its ini
tial offer. Many union members
though unhappy with the contract,
voted to accept it because of per
sonal economic hardship caused by
the strike.
USW says it has "learned a lot
since the 1982 strike."
USW refused Wheeler's request
to bring a federal mediator into the
negotiations, citing the University's
failure to make a wage offer as its
reason. Following the wage offer,
made during an on-campus
negotiating session on Sept. 19, the
union made counter-proposals
which reduced its demands to their
current level. USW's earlier wage
proposal called for a 10 percent
across-the-board increase.
According to USW Chief
Negotiator Mary Ann Tenuto, talks
are still at the beginning since Stan
ford has just made its wage offer.
She adds that USW is willing to
make further concessions.
"Both sides have a lot of room for
compromise, but we're not getting
anywhere with Stanford," she said.
Wheeler agrees with Tenuto that
there is "a long way to go." She
also believes negotiations can

quickly "change dramatically,''
either for the better or for the
worse.
The next meeting between the
two parties is scheduled for Wed
nesday when, according to Tenuto,
it will be "Stanford's turn 1 ' to make
a move.
