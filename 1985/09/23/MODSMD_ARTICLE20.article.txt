Saga to operate Coffee House
June 20 — Tresidder Union an
nounced that Saga Corp. has been
awarded the contract for the
Tresidder Memorial Union Food
Services effective Sept. 1, and stu
dent officials of the Coffee House
are not happy.
Michael Bauccio, southwest area
vice president for Saga, said stu
dents will be involved "in -a
managerial role as well as in periph
eral roles" under Saga.
According to Jim Connelly, area
sales director for Saga, the Coffee

House will undergo no physical
changes under its new owners, at
least until it moves into the old
bowling alley. That area, now occu
pied by terminals of the Low Over
head Time Sharing (LOTS) com
puter system, is scheduled to be
available for the Coffee House by
fall 1986.
"We think the Coffee House is
excellent the way it is now," Con
nelly said, "and we want to
preserve the atmosphere as much
as students do."
However, Coffee House officials
and ASSU members were not
pleased with the announcement.
Mark Thornburgh, 1984-85 Coffee

House president, said he was disap
pointed. "I just cannot see that
Saga can come in and do a better
job," he said.
Former Coffee House employee
Daniel Rosen said he will proceed
with plans to organize a boycott of
the Saga-run Coffee House and to
establish an alternative, student
run coffee house. He said leaving
Saga in charge of critical Coffee
House policy decisions is too dan
gerous.
Tresidder, in offering Saga the
Coffee House contract, report
edly stipulated that the company
work closely with students. A task
force is currently being formed by

the Dean of Student Affairs Office
to investigate alternative models
for student involvement.
Store backs down on Playboy
Aug. 27 — The October issue of
Playboy magazine, containing a
feature called "Girls of the Pac-10,"
went on sale at The Store in
Tresidder Union without an anti
pornography flier attached to the
cover.
The Store instead opted to hand
out the flier to purchasers of the
magazine. The flier was co-written
by Tresidder officials and the stu
dent group Stanford Students
Opposed to Pornography (STOP).
The feature included
photographs of two Stanford stu
dents, both of whom used fake
names. Sophomore "C.C.
Shanahan" opened the pictorial,
fully clothed in a Stanford T-shirt
and shorts. Senior "Romona
Turner" wore only a blue, un
buttoned shirt.
The introduction to the article as
sailed the efforts by STOP last
spring to prevent Playboy from
photographing Stanford students.
The group had planned a boycott of
The Store if it sold the October
issue of Playboy, but later com
promised and agreed to the flier.
Protesters found guilty
PALO ALTO, July 1 — After a
four-day trial, a jury found six Stan
ford students guilty of trespassing
and refusing to disperse — charges
stemming from their May 28 sit-in
at the Bursar's Office in Old Union.
The three other protesters,
Jennifer G. Grant, Caroline Paul
and Todd Ramming had earlier
pleaded no contest to the charges.
All nine students involved in the

protest received jail sentences that
were waived for time already
served in jail.
Judge Franklin Elia also gave
eight of the students the option of
going on probation for three months
and having their records automati
cally cleared if they broke no laws.
Grant, Mario Huerta, David

Magnus, William Northway, Davi
Romo and Michael Tarpey all ai

after one year.
