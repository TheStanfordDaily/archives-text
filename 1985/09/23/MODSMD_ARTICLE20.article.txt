are not happy.
Michael Bauccio, southwest area
vice president for Saga, said stu
dents will be involved "in -a
managerial role as well as in periph
eral roles" under Saga.
According to Jim Connelly, area
sales director for Saga, the Coffee

House will undergo no physical
changes under its new owners, at
least until it moves into the old
bowling alley. That area, now occu
pied by terminals of the Low Over
head Time Sharing (LOTS) com
puter system, is scheduled to be
available for the Coffee House by
fall 1986.
"We think the Coffee House is
excellent the way it is now," Con

However, Coffee House officials
and ASSU members were not
pleased with the announcement.

Saga can come in and do a better
job," he said.
Former Coffee House employee
Daniel Rosen said he will proceed
with plans to organize a boycott of
the Saga-run Coffee House and to
establish an alternative, student
run coffee house. He said leaving
Saga in charge of critical Coffee
House policy decisions is too dan
gerous.
Tresidder, in offering Saga the
Coffee House contract, report
edly stipulated that the company
work closely with students. A task
force is currently being formed by

the Dean of Student Affairs Office
to investigate alternative models
for student involvement.
Store backs down on Playboy
Aug. 27 — The October issue of
Playboy magazine, containing a
feature called "Girls of the Pac-10,"
went on sale at The Store in
Tresidder Union without an anti
pornography flier attached to the
cover.
The Store instead opted to hand
out the flier to purchasers of the
magazine. The flier was co-written
by Tresidder officials and the stu
dent group Stanford Students
Opposed to Pornography (STOP).
The feature included
photographs of two Stanford stu
dents, both of whom used fake
names. Sophomore "C.C.
Shanahan" opened the pictorial,
fully clothed in a Stanford T-shirt
and shorts. Senior "Romona
Turner" wore only a blue, un
buttoned shirt.
The introduction to the article as

spring to prevent Playboy from
photographing Stanford students.
The group had planned a boycott of
The Store if it sold the October
issue of Playboy, but later com
promised and agreed to the flier.
Protesters found guilty
PALO ALTO, July 1 — After a
four-day trial, a jury found six Stan
ford students guilty of trespassing
and refusing to disperse — charges
stemming from their May 28 sit-in
at the Bursar's Office in Old Union.
The three other protesters,
Jennifer G. Grant, Caroline Paul
and Todd Ramming had earlier
pleaded no contest to the charges.
All nine students involved in the

protest received jail sentences that
were waived for time already
served in jail.
Judge Franklin Elia also gave
eight of the students the option of
going on probation for three months
and having their records automati

Dead shows called off
July 9 — Two concerts by the
Grateful Dead, scheduled for July
27 and 28 at Krost Ampitheatre,
were canceled early last week after
an apparent misunderstanding be
tween show organizers.
Senior Patrick McCrystle, direc
tor of the Concert Network, said the
shows were only scheduled in the
first place because of a misin
terpreted conversation between
himself and Bob Barsotti of Bill
Graham Presents.
"The Grateful Dead had ex
pressed an interest in doing a show,
and 1 had been in contact with Bar
sotti," said McCrystle. "I agreed to
get in contact with him ... to dis
cuss particulars. He took that as a
go-ahead and announced the show
on the Grateful Dead hotline."
McCrystle said the concerts
could not be held due to scheduling
conflicts at Frost and reluctance on
the part of the Stanford police and
University administrators.
Promoter Barsotti said plans for

the shows were halted because of
"lies" told by Concert Network
Director Patrick McCrystle. "He
(McCrystle) told me yes," Barsotti
said, "and then he changed his
story."
As for future concerts, Barsotti
acknowledged that the Concert
Network had done an "excellent"
job presenting two Grateful Dead
shows last April, but said new per
sonnel had taken over since then. "I
couldn't imagine working with the
Concert Network right now," he
said. "And I'm never working with
McCrystle again."
Football team faces charge
A high school quarterback from
North Carolina claimed he attended
a late-June football camp run by
Stanford Coach Jack Elway without

paying the $300 fee, the Los An
geles Times reported in its July 13
editions.
NCAA officials said such an ac
tion would be a violation of NCAA
rules, but said there was no preced
ent for investigating a school
accused solely of this.
"Stanford paid for the camp for
me. I didn't have to pay anything for
the camp," Neil Williams Jr., who
will be a senior in Charlotte, N.C.,
told the Times.
Elway denied the charge.
"Whatever the kid said or did,
there's no way we're going to go
back there and tell him that he
doesn't have to pay," he told the
Times.
Williams has since paid the fee.
Even if Williams did not lie, it ap
pears he would be alone in such a

claim. In a random sampling of
campers conducted by The Daily,
all those contacted said they paid
their own way. In addition, none of
the campers contacted said he had
heard of anyone else attending
camp free.
Tom Beckett, Stanford's assis
tant director of athletics for football
operations, who is recruiting Wil
liams, told the Times that a com
puter list of those registered for the
camp showed that Williams owed no
money and had paid none. "It was a
mistake in accounting," he said.

June 20 — Tresidder Union an

awarded the contract for the
Tresidder Memorial Union Food

Michael Bauccio, southwest area

According to Jim Connelly, area
sales director for Saga, the Coffee

House will undergo no physical

least until it moves into the old
bowling alley. That area, now occu

available for the Coffee House by
fall 1986.
"We think the Coffee House is
excellent the way it is now," Con

However, Coffee House officials
and ASSU members were not
pleased with the announcement.
Mark Thornburgh, 1984-85 Coffee

House president, said he was disap

Saga can come in and do a better
job," he said.
Former Coffee House employee
Daniel Rosen said he will proceed
with plans to organize a boycott of
the Saga-run Coffee House and to
establish an alternative, student
run coffee house. He said leaving
Saga in charge of critical Coffee
House policy decisions is too dan

Tresidder, in offering Saga the

Store backs down on Playboy
Aug. 27 — The October issue of
Playboy magazine, containing a
feature called "Girls of the Pac-10,"
went on sale at The Store in
Tresidder Union without an anti

cover.
The Store instead opted to hand
out the flier to purchasers of the
magazine. The flier was co-written
by Tresidder officials and the stu

Opposed to Pornography (STOP).
The feature included
photographs of two Stanford stu
dents, both of whom used fake
names. Sophomore "C.C.
Shanahan" opened the pictorial,
fully clothed in a Stanford T-shirt
and shorts. Senior "Romona

PALO ALTO, July 1 — After a

Dead shows called off
July 9 — Two concerts by the
Grateful Dead, scheduled for July
27 and 28 at Krost Ampitheatre,
were canceled early last week after
an apparent misunderstanding be
tween show organizers.
Senior Patrick McCrystle, direc
tor of the Concert Network, said the
shows were only scheduled in the
first place because of a misin
terpreted conversation between
himself and Bob Barsotti of Bill
Graham Presents.
"The Grateful Dead had ex
pressed an interest in doing a show,
and 1 had been in contact with Bar
sotti," said McCrystle. "I agreed to
get in contact with him ... to dis
cuss particulars. He took that as a
go-ahead and announced the show
on the Grateful Dead hotline."
McCrystle said the concerts
could not be held due to scheduling
conflicts at Frost and reluctance on
the part of the Stanford police and
University administrators.
Promoter Barsotti said plans for

the shows were halted because of
"lies" told by Concert Network
Director Patrick McCrystle. "He
(McCrystle) told me yes," Barsotti
said, "and then he changed his
story."
As for future concerts, Barsotti
acknowledged that the Concert
Network had done an "excellent"
job presenting two Grateful Dead
shows last April, but said new per
sonnel had taken over since then. "I
couldn't imagine working with the
Concert Network right now," he
said. "And I'm never working with
McCrystle again."
Football team faces charge
A high school quarterback from
North Carolina claimed he attended
a late-June football camp run by
Stanford Coach Jack Elway without

paying the $300 fee, the Los An
geles Times reported in its July 13
editions.
NCAA officials said such an ac
tion would be a violation of NCAA
rules, but said there was no preced
ent for investigating a school
accused solely of this.
"Stanford paid for the camp for
me. I didn't have to pay anything for
the camp," Neil Williams Jr., who
will be a senior in Charlotte, N.C.,
told the Times.
Elway denied the charge.
"Whatever the kid said or did,
there's no way we're going to go
back there and tell him that he
doesn't have to pay," he told the
Times.
Williams has since paid the fee.
Even if Williams did not lie, it ap
