## SLE Faces Change Leadership new; course same 
### MARILYN WANN Editorial staff 
In this year's issue of "Approaching Stanford," a
student trying to describe the experience of
Structured Liberal Education (called SLE and
pronounced "slee") was quoted as saying, "You
spend the first five days at Stanfoid getting ori
ented, and then you go to your first SLE lecture and
get disoriented."
That's a feeling certain people in this unique
Western Culture track don't want to discourage,
people like the new SLE director, Larry Ryan; SLE
Prof, and Resident Fellow Andy Sims; and Steve
Fuller, the new program coordinator.
Ryan inherited the task of running what he calls
the most successful residential education pro-

gram on campus when Director and RF Mark Man
call left the program to be director of Stanford's
campus in Haifa, Israel. Fuller assumed the position
of Jon Reider, who accepted a position in the Admis
sions Office.
SLE remains the only 9-unit per quarter Western
Culture track, and the only one to require its stu
dents to live in the same dorm, sit on the floor
through 12 hours of classes and discussion sections
a week and submit rough drafts to tutors who are
upperclassmen.
"In six years, the student may forget the content
of this course, but we want a tolerance of ambiguity
to remain," said Sims, who outlined the SLE's
theme this year as the transfer of idea into action
and the intellectual's social responsibility.
Ryan listed the subjects slated for discussion
within this broad topic as education, myth, love and
wisdom.
Ryan and Sims are not newcomers to the pro
gram in general, but just to their positions. Ryan has
helped teach and plan the program since its begin
nings, and the new RF has led sections for seven
years.

Even Fuller was a SLE student in 1978-79 and
knows the program and its aims well. "I was raised
in SLE myself," he said.
According to the new management, all the tradi
tions that were instituted when SLE began in 1972
under a Carnegie Foundation Grant will be main
tained and coupled with some improvements.
"SLE is now intensive and comprehensive, but
the students also make a commitment for more,"
said Ryan. "I may scare them with the fact that SLE
is very demanding."
Former SLE student and tutor Greg Watkins said
he hopes the program will maintain or even increase
its rigor.
"A course like SLE is only good if it's rigorous,"
he explained, saying that SLE in the past has had a
negative tradition of not demanding enough from its
students.
"Now they have a chance to make some improve
ments because of the mix-up in people," Watkins
said.
Fuller plans to help in this respect by
"institutionalizing" the rough draft and establishing a
firm deadline for such drafts â€” as firm as if they were
final papers. In the past, due dates were arranged
casually between the tutor and the student.
Fuller's plans extend to sections, where students
will be expected to base discussion more on the text
and less on chatty, and often broad, generalizations,
as was the tendency in the past, he said.
Fuller said he hopes that his enthusiasm and non
traditional teaching methods will convince, rather
than coerce, the students to meet the demanding
SLE requirements.
"I want to make students motivated to learn with
out forcing them," he said.
One project Fuller will start is the SLE Players,
which will present a dramatic work each quarter,
beginning with "Lysistrata" this quarter, followed
by Machiavelli's "Mandragola," and ending the year
with Bertolt Brecht's "The Exception and the
Rule."
Fuller also said he hopes his background in Ger
man Thought and Studies, with two degrees in
these areas and a doctorate in progress, should help
him to enliven the third quarter, wliich deals heavily
with writings of this culture.
Others worry that the tradition established by
Mancall will be hard to continue without his pres
ence.
"Since SLE was founded by Mark, a lot of what
SLE was came from his energy, his interest in the
students, even his politics," said Nancy Henry, the
live-in tutor this year for Paloma, one of the three
wings of Florence Moore Hall (including Alondra and
Gavilan) that house freshmen who take the course.
However, Henry expressed no fears that the new
personnel would not be able to keep up the stand
ards he set.
Reider joked that the Catholic Church survived
the death of St. Paul, so SLE will continue after
Mancall's departure.
Ryan will certainly provide a new personality for
the position of SLE director. "I don't agree with
Mark about some things, say, that Marxism is the in-

evitable end of society," he
said with a smile.
''He added an eccentric
tone to the course," Fuller
remembered, saying that this
factor, as well as his knowl
edge of culture, would cer
tainly be hard to replace.
Ryan does admit that he
isn't sure whether the course
will change or not. He credits
the democratic review the
curriculum undergoes each
quarter in staff meetings with
the seven section leaders and
23 tutors as one reason the
course has stayed successful
this long.
Reider is optimistic about
SLE's future. "It's like boot
camp in the army. Nothing is
so powerful in impact," he
said.
Sims attributed this effect
to the community of the SLE
dorms and to the presence of
staff members who eat meals
with the students.
"I do some of my best
teaching over lunch or in my
apartment," she explained.

Sims and the others would
probably agree with
Heraclitus who said that there
is nothing permanent in the
world except change, but
they might exclude SLE.
