# Remembering Paul Flory, 1910-1985
## A
						colleague and friend on Stanford's 1974 Nobel laureate 
### 
•10S Lerman, a Hertz Fellow in
. Applied Physical Sciences, wrote
to following in tribute to emeritus
Chemistry Prof. Paul Flory, who
died of a heart attack Sept. 8 at his
home m Big Sur. A memorial ser
vice to winner of the 1974
tfobel Prize in Chemistry, will be
fuld today at 4 p. m. in Memorial
Church.)
My picture of Paul will always be
of him behind his large work area, a
desk in front, the easel jauntily
tilted at the side, and his plentiful
supply of books arrayed behind
Jim. The first impression on enter
ng the room was that of light.
True, the room was well lit, but so
jre many others. What struck me
was an undefinable combination of
many things. . . The art work
jong the wall included a moder
ieSque flash of color without classi
:al shape, and a picture of the
icean, most beloved by him. A few
3ther odds and ends were scattered
jbout the place. Oh yes, at the end
jf the wall, in a small glass frame, in
so obscure a corner that I missed it
he first few times I was in his of
ice, was the award given to him in
1974 by the Nobel Committee for
lis work in chemistry.
It was always a bit of a surprise
or me to see it hanging there, for
hough Paul took great professional
)ride in his work, he so understated
lis own accomplishments. As he
>aid in the introduction to his Nobel
ecture, "These advances are the
ruits of effoi ts of many dedicated
nvestigators working in laborato
ies spread around the world. In a
/ery real sense, I am before you on
his occasion as their representa
it
ive.
It must be said that Paul Flory
vas among the greatest scientists
)f this century, and can rightfully be
:alled the father of modern polymer
science. It is considered a postulate
hat the best and most individual
vork of physical scientists is done
vhen they are young, in their 20s
ind 30s. Yet after three quarters of
i century, Paul was still writing
>apers alone; indeed, some have
said his most recent work was as
mportant as anything he had done
lefore.
That is saying a lot. For the his
ory of the development of polymer
Jiemistry, as a science, and not as
i random excercise in alchemy, is a
listory of Paul Flory's papers,
fore than anyone else, he brought
)rder to an unruly subject, which
las since proved to be of supreme
mportance in all facets of our con
emporary world — scientific, in
lustrial and biomedical.
He seemed always to be decades
ihead of everyone else. Though
nany of the advances of polymer
science came from the continual in
sights he provided, he was far more
han a theoretician. He spent many
'ears in industry, was a member of
he development team that made
lylon, and later did much work on

synthetic rubber. The breadth of
his work was such that it recently
took four persons, each with a dif
ferent technical specialty, to edit a
three-volume edition of the

Yet Paul had a modesty of the
present — he lived in the present
for the future. What was done was
done. What had been written, said
or performed in the past was in the
past. He was aware, supremely
aware, of the passage of each
second, and his eyes seemed to see
his surroundings with a clarity and a
precision beautiful to share. Per
haps this was the real source of the
light I always felt when entering his
work area.
• • •
I always felt welcome in his of
fice, discussing whatever concerns
or business I felt important that
day. This generosity of his time
was but a small metaphor for the
compassion and generosity Paul
gave to people all over the world,
even those he never met.
After winning the Nobel Prize,
Paul felt an obligation to use the
fame and public exposure for some
social good. After discussion with
his wife, Emily, the Florys chose to
spend much of their time on these
human rights issues.
Lord knows, Paul had alterna
tives — his continuing scientific
work, consulting for the industries
he helped establish, and spending
time with his many friends about
the world. He was superbly dis
ciplined in mind, memory and body.
He was always so well organized
that he had a response and turn
around time for work measured in
hours to days. Paul pushed himself
on a schedule of travel, talks, re
search and writing that would have
put a much younger man to shame.
I know. I tried to keep up with him
on a couple of joint projects.
And whenever he could, he
would retire for a few days to his
mountain top home in Big Sur,
"Flory's Mountain," a place with no
telephone where he would chop his
own wood and draw his own water.
And think. . . .
One of the things that salves the
pain, that makes the loss of Paul a
bit more bearable, is a voice that
has taken up residency in the back
of my mind. It speaks with a gruff
laugh so much like Paul's: " Let's
stop talking, and get back to work."
• • •
My own work with Paul for the
past eight years centered on issues
involving human rights, interna
tional science exchange, and limit
ing the transfer of science and
technology that can be abused by
totalitarian regimes.
Paul Flory had no tolerance for
totalitarianism in any form, color or
parity. Right or left, he would fight
it. He had little love of politics or

politicians, publicity or newspeople.
Yet continuously for those eight
years, Paul offered himself for
press conferences on human rights
issues, especially representing the
Western scientific community on
behalf of Soviet physicists Andrei
Sakharov, Yuri Orlov, Anatoly
Scharansky, and their fellow im
prisoned scientists in Eastern
Europe.
His concentration on Eastern
Europe was not arbitrary. In those
countries, the science exchange
process is under tight political con
trol, and many scientists are
routinely persecuted. Because of
the Soviet's interest in Western sci
ence and technology, Paul and
other scientists felt their actions
could play a larger role in support
ing the basic freedoms necessary
for the conduct of science.
Paul looked at freedom as the
dynamo for positive social change.
He looked at science as the
epitome, the distillation, of this so
cial process. Science was a social
act that required the freedoms of
thought, communication and travel.
In a divided world, Paul felt that sci
entific cooperation — without politi
cal regulation — was a crucial
avenue to peace. He would often
ask: if a country silenced or at
tempted to silence its seekers after
natural truth, which is something
we all share, and must by nature it
self agree on, then what hope have
we that that country will work
towards an understanding with
foreigners for peace and coopera
tion?
• • •
Make no mistake — Paul Flory
was a strong believer in those sci
entific exchanges, from which could
come progress in peace as well as
science. (In his Nobel Prize
autobiographical sketch, he pays
tribute to Soviet scientists for
laying the groundwork for some of
the work for which he was receiv
ing the Nobel Prize.) But his was a
belief in true science exchange, un
fettered by the political control of
totalitarian regimes.
It was in 1978 with great reluc
tance, but with a strong moral con
viction that 9,000 scientists across
the world voluntarily withdrew
their scientific cooperation with the
Soviets. This was in response to
the imprisonments of the Orlov,
Scharansky and (later) Andrei Sak
harov. Paul was one of the leaders
and principle spokesman for these
9,000. This "boycott" or
"moratorium on scientific coopera
tion" as it was called was (and is)
unprecedented in the history of in
ternational science.
This group became known as
SOS, or Scientists for Sakharov,
Orlov and Scharansky, and grew to
become involved in a variety of
human rights cases around the
world. It continues to be one of the
most "activist" groups of scientists

in human rights. It is SOS which
Paul was most closely identified
with, as a founder, activist and
spokesman, and it is here that
Paul's philosphies of political action
are most embodied.
Later he was asked to be a mem
ber of the U.S. delegation to a
review conference of the Helsinki
Accord, the 1975 agreement on se
curity and cooperation in Europe.
Paul joined delegations from East
and West in negotiations devoted to
issues of international scientific
cooperation. The Soviet delegation
insisted that human rights and sci
entific cooperation were completely
unrelated. It was largely Paul's
leadership that welded the Western
scientists-delegates into a coherent
group. They demanded without
compromise and unprecedently
received (on paper only, alas) So
viet recognition and guarantees of
human rights and freedoms as a ne
cessary basis for improvements in
international scientific cooperation.
This was a unique accomplishment.
At no other of the secondary
meetings of the Helsinki process
did even a mention of human rights
appear in the final document.
• • •
Paul continued to be at the van
guard of scientists seeking to insure
a meaningful scientific exchange
without political regulation. He and
many colleagues sought to couple
any resumption of exchange agree
ments with the Soviets to a series
of guarantees, safeguards and
verification procedures.
As he and other Nobel laureates
wrote recently in a letter to Science
magazine,"Exchange agreements
between the National Academies
(of Science) were partially
suspended in 1980 when the ero
sion of human rights was dramati
cally underscored by Sakharov's
exile, without trial, to Gorky. . . .
What, then, has changed in the past
five years to explain the about-face
from the moral stance of 1980?
Have human rights for scientists in
the U.S.S.R. shown improvement?
Satcharov is a representative sym
bol for scores of others; his situa
tion is worsened. . . . Many new
arrests of scientists have come to
the attention of the (National
Academy Human Rights) Commit
tee. ... if anything has changed, it
has been for the worse."
He continued in this letter,
showing how this position is not
contradictory to the necessity of
continuing discussions on arms con
trol: "Despite the absence of many
exchange protocols these five years
past, interaction on matters con
cerning catastrophic world dangers
has continued. Such issues as arms
control and nuclear winder tran
scend in importance the more nor
mal activities in science, and we
applaud the continuing discussions
on these topics. Why then, one
wonders, the haste in getting back

to doing business as usual?"
Paul was unequivocal about the
truth — he would disregard how
speaking out or acting upon the
truth would effect him personally or
politically. He saw the truth and he
spoke it — as a child would point
out that the emperor had no (moral)
clothes. He was always willing to
embarrass a tyrant, principally by
calling attention to things which
more polite, more "diplomatic" per
sons would politely and diplomati
cally ignore.
He would talk about what was
and what should be and the practical
decisions people needed to make to
bridge that gap. And upon his
words were built his works. There
were press conferences, vigils at
embassies. He even offered himself

as a hostage to the Soviet Union,
guaranteeing the "good" behavior
of Sakharov's wife, Yelena Bonner,
if she would be released from
confinement and allowed to take
badly needed medical care in the
West.
I have been involved with human
rights work for 10 years. But I have
met no one else with such purity
and vision of the truth, and the wil
lingness and ability to act upon it.
Those of us who knew Paul,
know him still for his continuing
gifts to our lives.
Most of us, in a moment of quiet
honesty, would admit to our
replacability in this world. In his
own modest way, Paul Flory would
have said this about himself. The
rest of us know otherwise.
