Emeritus Prof. Paul Flory,
winner of the 1974 Nobel Prize
in Chemistry, died of a massive
heart attack Sept. 8 at his house
in Big Sur. He was 75.
A pioneer in the field of
polymer chemistry, Flory
divided his time between running
two research teams at Stanford
and working with groups aimed
at promoting and defending the
rights of "dissident" scientists in
the Soviet Union and the Eas
tern bloc.
He was born on June 19, 1910
in Sterling, 111. His father was a
clergyman-educator; his mother,
a schoolteacher. Both were the
first of their families of record to
have attended college.
After graduating from
Manchester College in 1931,
Flory entered Ohio State Uni
versity, where his interests
turned to physical chemistry,
particularly photochemistry and
spectroscopy. He completed his
Ph.D. three years later and
joined the Central Research De
partment of the DuPont Com
pany, were he was assigned to

the small group headed by
Wallace Carothers, inventor of
nylon and neoprene. Through his
association with Carothers,
Flory began to investigate the
fundumentals of polymerization
and polymeric substances.
With the outbreak of World
War II and the urgency of re
search and development on syn
thetic rubber, supply of which
was imperiled, Flory returned to
industry, first at the Esso (now
Exxon) Laboratories of the Stan
dard Oil Development Company
(1940-43) and later at the Re
search Laboratory of the
Goodyear Tire and Rubber Com
pany (1943-48).
After a stint at Cornell Univer
sity, Flory accepted the J.G.
Jackson-C.J. Wood Professor
ship in Chemistry at Stanford in
1957, where he went on to win
almost every major award in sci
ence and chemistry, including
the Cresson Medal of the
Franklin Institute, the Priestley
Medal of the American Chemical
Society, and the National Medal
of Science.
