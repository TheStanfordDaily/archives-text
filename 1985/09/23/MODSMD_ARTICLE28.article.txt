## SECTION II Cardinal Collapses in Second Half at Oregon Stanford Gets an F 
### 
EUGENE, Ore. — It was hard
0 be down on the Stanford football
earn this season after its 41-7
ipening victory over San Jose
State. Brad Muster scored four
ouchdowns. John Paye threw for
!83 yards. The defense held the
Spartans to minus-31 yards rush
ng-
Yet the pessimists talked all
yeek about how San Jose was not
1 real test. It was like a true-false
juiz in Mick 001. Anyone could
>ass.
Saturday's 45-28 loss to Oregon
vas more like the first midterm in
51 — without cheat cards.
Vnd the Cardinal graded out with an
\ despite picking up some partial
:redit.
For the first 25 minutes, an A
seemed a sure thing. It looked like
i highlight film in the making. Paye
vas on his way to a 19-of-24 perfor
nance with 197 yards in the first

half. Muster had 47 yards rushing
and 75 receiving.
And the defense was a virtual
swarm of white jerseys every time
the Ducks tried to run or throw
short. There were enough gang
tackles for it to seem like East L.A.
The outside linebackers and the
secondary made the Oregon sweep

more strung out than Bloom
County's Bill the Cat before his
cocaine rehab program. The hell
with the "Killer B's"; this was "The
Swarm."
Then things started to resemble
a bad horror movie. Lew Barnes,
Oregon's senior flanker who ranks

among the Pac-10's best, began to
take the Stanford secondary deep.
He set up the first Duck touch
down, then made "a questionable
end-zone catch for the second. Jeff
James fumbled on the kickoff. The
tackling went bad. Bingo: 21-14
Oregon.
Then it really fell apart. Muster
fumbled four times. Paye had three
passes intercepted. The offensive
line allowed Paye to get sacked
three times and left him running
away from blitzes a whole lot more.
And the defense broke down more
than a bunch of high school girls
watching "Brian's Song."
What happened?
"We just had a few breakdowns.
They came up with some big plays,
and we got down on ourselves a
little," linebacker Matt Soderlund
said.


bregon's blitzes — from linebackers and defensive backs —
lorced Stanford quarterback John Paye to hurry many of his

throws. Three of Paye's tosses were stolen by the Ducks. In all,
the Cardinal turned the ball over seven times.

"It doesn't matter if they blitz or
not. We should expect it," Paye
said. "That's what good teams do.
When they blitz, you make your big
play."
The Card rolled up 560 yards,
but only 28 points. Some teams
would outscore their basketball
teams with that kind of offense. "I
guarantee you that if we don't make
those turnovers, we win the
game," Paye said.
There is cause for optimism
here. The offense looked good
when it wasn't putting the ball on
the ground or missing the blitz.
This team will score a lot of points.
It just has to score more than the
opposition.
