# Ducks roar back 45-28; Cherry rambles for 227

EUGENE, Ore. — Stanford
Coach Jack Elway went through
only two cigarettes during the
press conference that followed his
team's 45-28 loss to Oregon here
Saturday, and it wasn't because he
was relaxed. It was because the
meeting was so brief. There just
wasn't very much to say about a
loss like this.
"It's a human game, and we were
human today in terms of turn
overs," Elway said to the members
of the media crowded together on
the concrete stairs outside Stan
ford's closed, quiet locker room.
He took another drag off cigarette
No. 2. "We had a 14-point lead and
could have added to it. We took our
selves out of it early."
That was about the size of it.
After building a 14-0 advantage in
the first 25 minutes of play, the
Cardinal simply fell apart. The
Ducks (2-1) banged in three
demoralizing touchdowns in the last
five minutes of the second quarter,
and blitzed Stanford into the brand
new OmniTurf of Autzen Stadium
throughout the second half to ruin
the Cardinal's Pacific-10 Confer
ence debut.
And Stanford was, as Elway
kindly put it, human. The Cardinal
turned the ball over six times Satur
day and racked up eight costly
penalties. Two offensive penalties
killed drives in Oregon territory and
three defensive no-nos gave the
Ducks crucial first downs.
"(The penalties) really hurt us,"
said Stanford quarterback John
Paye, who connected on 31 of his
47 passes for three touchdowns and
a career high 408 yards, but threw
three interceptions. "I look at

penalties the same way as turn
overs — the good teams avoid
them. How many times did we punt
the ball, twice?" He shook his head.
"We stopped ourselves."
Actually, the Cardinal punted five
times, but the point remains. Stan
ford piled up more net yards than
the Ducks (560 to 514), made more
first downs (27 to 23), controlled
the ball longer (32:15 to 27:45) —
and lost by 17 points. That
shouldn't happen.
There were plenty of excuses, if
the Cardinal players wanted to use
them. The team had a couple of
low-intensity practices Monday and
Tuesday following its 41-7 romp
over squeezably soft San Jose State
last weekend. They spent this
week moving from their pre-season
rooms in Toyon to student housing.
Then the flight to Eugene on Friday
was an hour late, cancelling the
planned afternoon practice on the
unfamiliar sand-based OmniTurf of
Autzen Stadium.
And the game was Oregon's
home opener, before 33,494 green
and-gold clad fans doing the Wave
around the stadium and quacking on
plastic yellow kazoos. There were
excuses, but Elway avoided them.
"Give credit to Oregon, they
played really well," he said. "They
played nickel and blitzed, went to a
4-2 line and stunted, and we didn't
pick it up. That's my job."
Up until, the last five minutes of
the first half, Stanford seemed to be
on its way to an easy win. Paye
marched the Cardinal into Oregon
territory on each of its first four
possessions, and put the ball into
the end zone twice. After the
opening drive was stymied by a
holding penalty on the Ducks' 35-
