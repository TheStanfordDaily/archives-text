# Ducks roar back 45-28; Cherry rambles for 227
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
EUGENE, Ore. — Stanford
Coach Jack Elway went through
only two cigarettes during the
press conference that followed his
team's 45-28 loss to Oregon here
Saturday, and it wasn't because he
was relaxed. It was because the
meeting was so brief. There just
wasn't very much to say about a
loss like this.
"It's a human game, and we were
human today in terms of turn
overs," Elway said to the members
of the media crowded together on
the concrete stairs outside Stan
ford's closed, quiet locker room.
He took another drag off cigarette
No. 2. "We had a 14-point lead and
could have added to it. We took our
selves out of it early."
That was about the size of it.
After building a 14-0 advantage in
the first 25 minutes of play, the
Cardinal simply fell apart. The
Ducks (2-1) banged in three
demoralizing touchdowns in the last
five minutes of the second quarter,
and blitzed Stanford into the brand
new OmniTurf of Autzen Stadium
throughout the second half to ruin
the Cardinal's Pacific-10 Confer
ence debut.
And Stanford was, as Elway
kindly put it, human. The Cardinal
turned the ball over six times Satur
day and racked up eight costly
penalties. Two offensive penalties
killed drives in Oregon territory and
three defensive no-nos gave the
Ducks crucial first downs.
"(The penalties) really hurt us,"
said Stanford quarterback John
Paye, who connected on 31 of his
47 passes for three touchdowns and
a career high 408 yards, but threw
three interceptions. "I look at

penalties the same way as turn
overs — the good teams avoid
them. How many times did we punt
the ball, twice?" He shook his head.
"We stopped ourselves."
Actually, the Cardinal punted five
times, but the point remains. Stan
ford piled up more net yards than
the Ducks (560 to 514), made more
first downs (27 to 23), controlled
the ball longer (32:15 to 27:45) —
and lost by 17 points. That
shouldn't happen.
There were plenty of excuses, if
the Cardinal players wanted to use
them. The team had a couple of
low-intensity practices Monday and
Tuesday following its 41-7 romp
over squeezably soft San Jose State
last weekend. They spent this
week moving from their pre-season
rooms in Toyon to student housing.
Then the flight to Eugene on Friday
was an hour late, cancelling the
planned afternoon practice on the
unfamiliar sand-based OmniTurf of
Autzen Stadium.
And the game was Oregon's
home opener, before 33,494 green
and-gold clad fans doing the Wave
around the stadium and quacking on
plastic yellow kazoos. There were
excuses, but Elway avoided them.
"Give credit to Oregon, they
played really well," he said. "They
played nickel and blitzed, went to a
4-2 line and stunted, and we didn't
pick it up. That's my job."
Up until, the last five minutes of
the first half, Stanford seemed to be
on its way to an easy win. Paye
marched the Cardinal into Oregon
territory on each of its first four
possessions, and put the ball into
the end zone twice. After the
opening drive was stymied by a
holding penalty on the Ducks' 35-
rard-line, Stanford drove 72 yards on eight plays for
he game's first score, a four-yeard pass from Paye to
ight end Greg Baty.
The Cardinal got another opportunity right after
hat, when cornerback Walt Harris recovered a fumble
ly Oregon punter Mike Preacher on the Ducks' 39.
"hey squandered it, however, when running back Brad
luster fumbled on the ensuing drive. Muster ran up
iome of the best statistics of his career Saturday — 14
atches for 169 yards and 129 yards rushing — but he
Iropped the ball four times, losing two of them to Duck
lefenders.
Oregon's offense continued to play as if it was
vaiting for a wake-up call, however. Duck quarterback
Miller tried to force a pass to heavily covered
unning back Tony Cherry, and Stanford safety Brad
lumphreys easily picked it off.
This time, the Cardinal converted, moving the ball
>4 yards and scoring on a 20-yard touchdown pass
rom Paye to Muster. Stanford seemed well on its way
0 a 2-0 record, and Oregon seemed eager to get back
nto the locker room.
That all changed with five minutes to go in the half,
vhen the Ducks got their first decent field position of
he game on safety Anthony Newman's interception of
1 Paye pass at midfield. A flurry of points ensued.
Biff. Miller to All-Conference receiver Lew Barnes
or 36 yards. Miller sneaks over for a touchdown three
ilays later.
Boom. Miller to Barnes on the right sideline for 32
r ards to the Stanford 30. Miller to Barnes into double
:overage for another touchdown.
Bam. Stanford's Jeff James is stripped of the ball on
he kickoff return. With 35 seconds left in the half,
Cherry bounces off a stacked line and rolls left for a 21-
rard touchdown run.
Just like that, the score ballooned to 21-14, and
Oregon had firm control of the game. Every time Stan
ford threatened to move back on top in the second half,

the Ducks came through with a big play to keep that
precious momentum.
On Oregon's first possession of the third quarter,
Cherry kept the surge going, ripping off runs of 18 and
20 yards that could have gone all the way if Harris had
not made a couple of key open-field tackles. The Duck
drive stalled at the Stanford 36, and kicker Dean Otto
came out to try for his first collegiate field goal.
It was a very costly play for the Cardinal. Otto
missed to the right on the 53-yard attempt, but Harris
fell into him for a roughing the kicker call and an auto
matic first down for the Ducks. As Harris went down,
he stuck out his arms to break his fall, landed hard on
the OmniTurf and dislocated his left elbow, tearing the
ligaments badly.
Stanford trainer Dr. Don Bunce quickly returned the
elbow to its socket before the swelling began, a move
that will probably shorten the duration of the •injury.
But Harris will still be out of action for at least three
weeks, and the ligaments will not heal for four to six
weeks.
After Otto hit a 53-yarder to make the score 24-14,
Stanford drove 75 yards in 12 plays — 11 of which
were runs — to close the gap to three. Muster and tail
back Thomas Henley plowed and danced, respectively,
down the field for five minutes until Muster bulled four
yards to the goal line, fumbled the ball and watched
Baty fall on it for six points.
The fourth quarter began with the score still 24-21,
and with the Ducks pinioned on their own seven-yard
line. At last, however, Oregon began to test the area
of the field they had left alone for most of the third
quarter — the left cornerback spot vacated by Harris
and manned by sophomore Bruce Richardson.
On second and five, Richardson went into deep
double coverage on wide receiver Scott Holman, and
tight end Eric Elliot curled underneath for a 30-yard
pickup. A play later, Holman beat Richardson for a 27-
yard reception. Holman then caught another in Rich

ardson's area for 12 yards, and fullback Kevin Willhite
grabbed one in the left flat and raced 18 yards for a
touchdown to cap the drive.
Stanford was down, but it still wasn't finished. After
an exchange of punts, Paye took a first-down snap,
saw the ever-present Oregon blitzers converging on
him and hit Muster crossing the middle of the field,
Muster tucked the ball in and motored down the right
sideline, breaking two open-field tackles and spinning
into the endzone for a 69-yard TD that made the score
31-28.
"The blitz is a make-or-break play," Paye said after
ward. "If a team blitzes us, we have to make them pay
for it. We only did that once today, on Muster's play.
"If we had better reads, or spectacular catches, we
would have had the big play more often," he continued.
"But we didn't do it. That's what the good teams do."
The lift that the Cardinal got out of Muster's score
lasted all of eight-seconds. That's how long it took
Cherry to bust over left tackle on the Ducks' first play
from scrimmage and streak 80 yards — over Harris'
old position — for the touchdown that effectively
ended the game.
Oregon intercepted a Paye pass on Stanford's next
possession and Cherry scooted for an insurance touch

down on a 22-yard run — capping off his 227-yar
formance. But the shock of Cherry's virtua
touched ramble from his own 20-yard-line was

was relaxed. It was because the
meeting was so brief. There just
wasn't very much to say about a
loss like this.
"It's a human game, and we were
human today in terms of turn
overs," Elway said to the members
of the media crowded together on
the concrete stairs outside Stan
ford's closed, quiet locker room.
He took another drag off cigarette
No. 2. "We had a 14-point lead and
could have added to it. We took our
selves out of it early."
That was about the size of it.
After building a 14-0 advantage in
the first 25 minutes of play, the
Cardinal simply fell apart. The
Ducks (2-1) banged in three
demoralizing touchdowns in the last
five minutes of the second quarter,
and blitzed Stanford into the brand
new OmniTurf of Autzen Stadium
throughout the second half to ruin
the Cardinal's Pacific-10 Confer
ence debut.
And Stanford was, as Elway
kindly put it, human. The Cardinal
turned the ball over six times Satur
day and racked up eight costly
penalties. Two offensive penalties
killed drives in Oregon territory and
three defensive no-nos gave the
Ducks crucial first downs.
"(The penalties) really hurt us,"
said Stanford quarterback John
Paye, who connected on 31 of his
47 passes for three touchdowns and
a career high 408 yards, but threw
three interceptions. "I look at

penalties the same way as turn
overs — the good teams avoid
them. How many times did we punt
the ball, twice?" He shook his head.
"We stopped ourselves."
Actually, the Cardinal punted five
times, but the point remains. Stan
ford piled up more net yards than
the Ducks (560 to 514), made more
first downs (27 to 23), controlled
the ball longer (32:15 to 27:45) —
and lost by 17 points. That
shouldn't happen.
There were plenty of excuses, if
the Cardinal players wanted to use
them. The team had a couple of
low-intensity practices Monday and
Tuesday following its 41-7 romp
over squeezably soft San Jose State
last weekend. They spent this
week moving from their pre-season
rooms in Toyon to student housing.
Then the flight to Eugene on Friday
was an hour late, cancelling the
planned afternoon practice on the
unfamiliar sand-based OmniTurf of
Autzen Stadium.
And the game was Oregon's
home opener, before 33,494 green
and-gold clad fans doing the Wave
around the stadium and quacking on
plastic yellow kazoos. There were
excuses, but Elway avoided them.
"Give credit to Oregon, they
played really well," he said. "They
played nickel and blitzed, went to a
4-2 line and stunted, and we didn't
pick it up. That's my job."
Up until, the last five minutes of
the first half, Stanford seemed to be
on its way to an easy win. Paye
marched the Cardinal into Oregon
territory on each of its first four
possessions, and put the ball into
the end zone twice. After the
opening drive was stymied by a
holding penalty on the Ducks' 35-
rard-line, Stanford drove 72 yards on eight plays for
he game's first score, a four-yeard pass from Paye to
ight end Greg Baty.
The Cardinal got another opportunity right after
hat, when cornerback Walt Harris recovered a fumble
ly Oregon punter Mike Preacher on the Ducks' 39.
"hey squandered it, however, when running back Brad
luster fumbled on the ensuing drive. Muster ran up
iome of the best statistics of his career Saturday — 14
atches for 169 yards and 129 yards rushing — but he
Iropped the ball four times, losing two of them to Duck
lefenders.
Oregon's offense continued to play as if it was
vaiting for a wake-up call, however. Duck quarterback
Miller tried to force a pass to heavily covered
unning back Tony Cherry, and Stanford safety Brad
lumphreys easily picked it off.
This time, the Cardinal converted, moving the ball
>4 yards and scoring on a 20-yard touchdown pass
rom Paye to Muster. Stanford seemed well on its way
0 a 2-0 record, and Oregon seemed eager to get back
nto the locker room.
That all changed with five minutes to go in the half,
vhen the Ducks got their first decent field position of
he game on safety Anthony Newman's interception of
1 Paye pass at midfield. A flurry of points ensued.
Biff. Miller to All-Conference receiver Lew Barnes
or 36 yards. Miller sneaks over for a touchdown three
ilays later.
Boom. Miller to Barnes on the right sideline for 32
r ards to the Stanford 30. Miller to Barnes into double
:overage for another touchdown.
Bam. Stanford's Jeff James is stripped of the ball on
he kickoff return. With 35 seconds left in the half,
Cherry bounces off a stacked line and rolls left for a 21-
rard touchdown run.
Just like that, the score ballooned to 21-14, and
Oregon had firm control of the game. Every time Stan
ford threatened to move back on top in the second half,

the Ducks came through with a big play to keep that
precious momentum.
On Oregon's first possession of the third quarter,
Cherry kept the surge going, ripping off runs of 18 and
20 yards that could have gone all the way if Harris had
not made a couple of key open-field tackles. The Duck
drive stalled at the Stanford 36, and kicker Dean Otto
came out to try for his first collegiate field goal.
It was a very costly play for the Cardinal. Otto
missed to the right on the 53-yard attempt, but Harris
fell into him for a roughing the kicker call and an auto
matic first down for the Ducks. As Harris went down,
he stuck out his arms to break his fall, landed hard on
the OmniTurf and dislocated his left elbow, tearing the
ligaments badly.
Stanford trainer Dr. Don Bunce quickly returned the
elbow to its socket before the swelling began, a move
that will probably shorten the duration of the •injury.
But Harris will still be out of action for at least three
weeks, and the ligaments will not heal for four to six
weeks.
After Otto hit a 53-yarder to make the score 24-14,
Stanford drove 75 yards in 12 plays — 11 of which
were runs — to close the gap to three. Muster and tail
back Thomas Henley plowed and danced, respectively,
down the field for five minutes until Muster bulled four
yards to the goal line, fumbled the ball and watched
Baty fall on it for six points.
The fourth quarter began with the score still 24-21,
and with the Ducks pinioned on their own seven-yard
line. At last, however, Oregon began to test the area
of the field they had left alone for most of the third
quarter — the left cornerback spot vacated by Harris
and manned by sophomore Bruce Richardson.
On second and five, Richardson went into deep
double coverage on wide receiver Scott Holman, and
tight end Eric Elliot curled underneath for a 30-yard
pickup. A play later, Holman beat Richardson for a 27-
yard reception. Holman then caught another in Rich

ardson's area for 12 yards, and fullback Kevin Willhite
grabbed one in the left flat and raced 18 yards for a
touchdown to cap the drive.
Stanford was down, but it still wasn't finished. After
an exchange of punts, Paye took a first-down snap,
saw the ever-present Oregon blitzers converging on
him and hit Muster crossing the middle of the field,
Muster tucked the ball in and motored down the right
sideline, breaking two open-field tackles and spinning
into the endzone for a 69-yard TD that made the score
31-28.
"The blitz is a make-or-break play," Paye said after
ward. "If a team blitzes us, we have to make them pay
for it. We only did that once today, on Muster's play.
"If we had better reads, or spectacular catches, we
would have had the big play more often," he continued.
"But we didn't do it. That's what the good teams do."
The lift that the Cardinal got out of Muster's score
lasted all of eight-seconds. That's how long it took
Cherry to bust over left tackle on the Ducks' first play
from scrimmage and streak 80 yards — over Harris'
old position — for the touchdown that effectively
ended the game.
Oregon intercepted a Paye pass on Stanford's next
possession and Cherry scooted for an insurance touch

down on a 22-yard run — capping off his 227-yar
formance. But the shock of Cherry's virtua
touched ramble from his own 20-yard-line was

of the media crowded together on
the concrete stairs outside Stan
ford's closed, quiet locker room.
He took another drag off cigarette
No. 2. "We had a 14-point lead and
could have added to it. We took our
selves out of it early."
That was about the size of it.
After building a 14-0 advantage in
the first 25 minutes of play, the
Cardinal simply fell apart. The
Ducks (2-1) banged in three
demoralizing touchdowns in the last
five minutes of the second quarter,
and blitzed Stanford into the brand
new OmniTurf of Autzen Stadium
throughout the second half to ruin
the Cardinal's Pacific-10 Confer
ence debut.
And Stanford was, as Elway
kindly put it, human. The Cardinal
turned the ball over six times Satur
day and racked up eight costly
penalties. Two offensive penalties
killed drives in Oregon territory and
three defensive no-nos gave the
Ducks crucial first downs.
"(The penalties) really hurt us,"
said Stanford quarterback John
Paye, who connected on 31 of his
47 passes for three touchdowns and
a career high 408 yards, but threw
three interceptions. "I look at

penalties the same way as turn
overs — the good teams avoid
them. How many times did we punt
the ball, twice?" He shook his head.
"We stopped ourselves."
Actually, the Cardinal punted five
times, but the point remains. Stan
ford piled up more net yards than
the Ducks (560 to 514), made more
first downs (27 to 23), controlled
the ball longer (32:15 to 27:45) —
and lost by 17 points. That
shouldn't happen.
There were plenty of excuses, if
the Cardinal players wanted to use
them. The team had a couple of
low-intensity practices Monday and
Tuesday following its 41-7 romp
over squeezably soft San Jose State
last weekend. They spent this
week moving from their pre-season
rooms in Toyon to student housing.
Then the flight to Eugene on Friday
was an hour late, cancelling the
planned afternoon practice on the
unfamiliar sand-based OmniTurf of
Autzen Stadium.
And the game was Oregon's
home opener, before 33,494 green
and-gold clad fans doing the Wave
around the stadium and quacking on
plastic yellow kazoos. There were
excuses, but Elway avoided them.
"Give credit to Oregon, they
played really well," he said. "They
played nickel and blitzed, went to a
4-2 line and stunted, and we didn't
pick it up. That's my job."
Up until, the last five minutes of
the first half, Stanford seemed to be
on its way to an easy win. Paye
marched the Cardinal into Oregon
territory on each of its first four
possessions, and put the ball into
the end zone twice. After the
opening drive was stymied by a
holding penalty on the Ducks' 35-
rard-line, Stanford drove 72 yards on eight plays for
he game's first score, a four-yeard pass from Paye to
ight end Greg Baty.
The Cardinal got another opportunity right after
hat, when cornerback Walt Harris recovered a fumble
ly Oregon punter Mike Preacher on the Ducks' 39.
"hey squandered it, however, when running back Brad
luster fumbled on the ensuing drive. Muster ran up
iome of the best statistics of his career Saturday — 14
atches for 169 yards and 129 yards rushing — but he
Iropped the ball four times, losing two of them to Duck
lefenders.
Oregon's offense continued to play as if it was
vaiting for a wake-up call, however. Duck quarterback
Miller tried to force a pass to heavily covered
unning back Tony Cherry, and Stanford safety Brad
lumphreys easily picked it off.
This time, the Cardinal converted, moving the ball
>4 yards and scoring on a 20-yard touchdown pass
rom Paye to Muster. Stanford seemed well on its way
0 a 2-0 record, and Oregon seemed eager to get back
nto the locker room.
That all changed with five minutes to go in the half,
vhen the Ducks got their first decent field position of
he game on safety Anthony Newman's interception of
1 Paye pass at midfield. A flurry of points ensued.
Biff. Miller to All-Conference receiver Lew Barnes
or 36 yards. Miller sneaks over for a touchdown three
ilays later.
Boom. Miller to Barnes on the right sideline for 32
r ards to the Stanford 30. Miller to Barnes into double
:overage for another touchdown.
Bam. Stanford's Jeff James is stripped of the ball on
he kickoff return. With 35 seconds left in the half,
Cherry bounces off a stacked line and rolls left for a 21-
rard touchdown run.
Just like that, the score ballooned to 21-14, and
Oregon had firm control of the game. Every time Stan
ford threatened to move back on top in the second half,

the Ducks came through with a big play to keep that
precious momentum.
On Oregon's first possession of the third quarter,
Cherry kept the surge going, ripping off runs of 18 and
20 yards that could have gone all the way if Harris had
not made a couple of key open-field tackles. The Duck
drive stalled at the Stanford 36, and kicker Dean Otto
came out to try for his first collegiate field goal.
It was a very costly play for the Cardinal. Otto
missed to the right on the 53-yard attempt, but Harris
fell into him for a roughing the kicker call and an auto
matic first down for the Ducks. As Harris went down,
he stuck out his arms to break his fall, landed hard on
the OmniTurf and dislocated his left elbow, tearing the
ligaments badly.
Stanford trainer Dr. Don Bunce quickly returned the
elbow to its socket before the swelling began, a move
that will probably shorten the duration of the •injury.
But Harris will still be out of action for at least three
weeks, and the ligaments will not heal for four to six
weeks.
After Otto hit a 53-yarder to make the score 24-14,
Stanford drove 75 yards in 12 plays — 11 of which
were runs — to close the gap to three. Muster and tail
back Thomas Henley plowed and danced, respectively,
down the field for five minutes until Muster bulled four
yards to the goal line, fumbled the ball and watched
Baty fall on it for six points.
The fourth quarter began with the score still 24-21,
and with the Ducks pinioned on their own seven-yard
line. At last, however, Oregon began to test the area
of the field they had left alone for most of the third
quarter — the left cornerback spot vacated by Harris
and manned by sophomore Bruce Richardson.
On second and five, Richardson went into deep
double coverage on wide receiver Scott Holman, and
tight end Eric Elliot curled underneath for a 30-yard
pickup. A play later, Holman beat Richardson for a 27-
yard reception. Holman then caught another in Rich

Early reports indicate that he'll be out for at least three weeks.
ardson's area for 12 yards, and fullback Kevin Willhite
grabbed one in the left flat and raced 18 yards for a
touchdown to cap the drive.
Stanford was down, but it still wasn't finished. After
an exchange of punts, Paye took a first-down snap,
saw the ever-present Oregon blitzers converging on
him and hit Muster crossing the middle of the field,
Muster tucked the ball in and motored down the right
sideline, breaking two open-field tackles and spinning
into the endzone for a 69-yard TD that made the score
31-28.
"The blitz is a make-or-break play," Paye said after
ward. "If a team blitzes us, we have to make them pay
for it. We only did that once today, on Muster's play.
"If we had better reads, or spectacular catches, we
would have had the big play more often," he continued.
"But we didn't do it. That's what the good teams do."
The lift that the Cardinal got out of Muster's score
lasted all of eight-seconds. That's how long it took
Cherry to bust over left tackle on the Ducks' first play
from scrimmage and streak 80 yards — over Harris'
old position — for the touchdown that effectively
ended the game.
Oregon intercepted a Paye pass on Stanford's next
possession and Cherry scooted for an insurance touch

down on a 22-yard run — capping off his 227-yar
formance. But the shock of Cherry's virtua
touched ramble from his own 20-yard-line was

nothing came of it.
Card notes
One other Stanford player was injured be
Harris. Left guard Andy Sinclair aggravated
ankle sprain on the Cardinal's first possession an
replaced by John Zentner. Sinclair returned fg
play later in the game, but the ankle forced himl
the sidelines.
Tailback Kevin Scott made his first appear®
the season in the fourth quarter of Saturday's
complete with goggles to protect the bruised ii
suffered in the pre-season. He will apparently be
for next week's game against Texas.
Speaking of injuries, All-Conference linel
Dave Wyman is definitely sitting out this seas
preparing to return next year. The knee injury 1
fered in the Arizona game last year was the sam
of thing that happened to Harris' arm Saturd
Wyman's tibia came out of its socket, ripping a
