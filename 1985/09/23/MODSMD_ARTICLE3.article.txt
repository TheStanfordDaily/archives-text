### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial Staff 
The California State Court of Ap
peal Friday upheld the University's
1972 firing of Associate Prof. H.
Bruce Franklin for his activity in the
campus movement against the Viet
nam War, calling his behavior in a
series ol 1971 protests "an ex
hortation to disruptive action."
Franklin, now a tenured English
professor at Rutgers University in
New Jersey, could not be reached
for comment.
However, Iris Brest, a Univer
sity attorney involved in the case,
said that Franklin could now appeal
to the California Supreme Court if
the court is willing to accept his
case.
Stanford dismissed Franklin, a
committed radical activist, on Jan.
5, 1972 because of his zealous in
volvement in a campus protest
against the Vietnam war.
The University alleged that on
Feb. 10, 1971 Franklin urged stu
dents to occupy a campus building
and disobey police.
In August 1972, Franklin and the
American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) filed suit seeking Franklin's
reinstatement, claiming that his dis
missal was unconstitutional, that
the University regulations authoriz
ing his firing were unconstitution
ally vague and that he had not com
mitted any crime.
An ACLU bulletin issued in July
1985 called Franklin "the first and
only professor ever fired by
(Stanford) over expression of his
political beliefs."
However a report issued Friday
by the appeals court stated, "It is
clear that the constitutional
freedom to speak does not license a
teacher to substantially disrupt and
interfere with the normal opera
tions of his or her employer. . . .

Expressive conduct which may not
justify criminal or civil liability may
be the subject of employer dis
cipline."
In early 1971, Franklin was in
volved in many campus rallies,
marches and meetings protesting
the Vietnam war and Stanford's role

in U.S. involvement. On Feb. 10,
he made the final speech in a White
Plaza rally and urged students to
occupy and shut down the Univer
sity Computation Center, where a
war simulation research program
was being conducted by the Stan
ford Research Institute for the
benefit of the military.
When a University administrator
was informed of the impending oc
cupation, he ordered the building
closed and locked. Following
Franklin's speech, however, more
than 100 demonstrators marched to
the center and forced their way into
the building. The computer power
system was cut and the center suf
fered damages totaling $800, ac
cording to the court document.
Franklin did not join the
protesters inside the building, but
