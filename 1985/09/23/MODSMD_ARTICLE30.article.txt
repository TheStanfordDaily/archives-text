# Spikers Take Tourney
## Card women retain winning ways 
### ROB GRAHAM Editorial staff 
Some things just never change. The sun rises; it
sets. The Stanford women's volleyball team wins.
And wins big.
The team won again this weekend. What's new?
The women, ranked No. 2 nationally, swept
through a four-team field to capture first prize at the
Spartan Shops Invitational in San Jose. In so doing,
they upped their overall record to 7-0.
But it wasn't easy. Co-coach Fred Sturm, whose
team finished second in the country last year behind
UCLA, expected a tough test in San Jose. Afterall,
each of the four teams on hand was ranked in the na
tion's top six.
And he got just what he bargained for.
The Cardinal was tested and tested early. No. 6
Colorado State took Stanford to five sets Saturday

before relenting. At one point, the Rams held an 8-1
advantage in the fifth set.
"I feel more fortunate than lucky about that one,"
Sturm said. "All I can say is we played our best at
the crucial times."
Things didn't get any easier for Stanford after
Colorado. The Cardinal's next foe, No. 5 Nebraska
stretched the Cardinal to four tough sets 14-16, 15-
13, 21-19, 15-11.
Stanford met the host school, San Jose State, in
the championship game, and as if the two previous
squeakers weren't enough, the Spartans forced the
already winded Cardinal into another five set mara
thon. In the end, though, Stanford nipped the Spar
tans 3-15, 15-12, 15-8, 11-15, 15-5.
Afterward, Sturm reflected on his team's play:
"In many ways we struggled during the tournament.
But toward the end, we struggled less.
