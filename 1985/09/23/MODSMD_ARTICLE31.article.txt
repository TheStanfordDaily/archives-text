# Bad Bounces Help Bruins Win
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Editorial staff 
Even soccer balls sometimes bounce in
strange ways. Stanford's women's soccer team,
now 2-3-1, had to learn that lesson the hard way
yesterday, as it fell to visiting UCLA, 2-0.
Things were routine enough for the first 75
ninutes. Neither the Cardinal nor the visiting
bruins could record a goal. Just another day in
ne sun at a Stanford soccer game.
And with both sides starting to show fatigue,
io spectator could have expected the fireworks
hat were to come. But come they did.
All of a sudden, everything went just a little
laywire. Thirty-four minutes into the second
stanza, lightning, like a message from above,
struck. And the Stanford side scattered.
Bruin Pam England's shot from the top of the
[oalie's box deflected squarely off the cross-bar.
he ball ricocheted just feet in front of the wide
>pen Stanford net. There the ball lay, asking to
booted. A surprised Bruin player was the
>eneficiary of the godsend.
UCLA' s junior striker Jamie Queen coolly
licked the ball into the undefended net for an
>ut-of-the-blue Bruin goal.
"That first goal, the one off the crossbar,"
ienior fullback Carol Berryman said, "was a real
ucky one. I don't know what really happened."
The fluke score broke open what had been a

tough defensive game, and sent the Cardinal
reeling. With the Stanford offense struggling to
muster anything at all, UCLA's 1-0 lead seemed
almost insurmountable.
But the blessed Bruins had another miracle
left, just for good measure. Scarcely three
minutes later, Stanford was stung again.
England, who was credited with an assist on
the Bruins' first score, somehow emerged with
the ball from a wild melee in front of the Stanford
net. With only the Cardinal goalkeeper between
herself and pay dirt, England lofted a shot into
the upper-right corner of the goal. UCLA 2,
Stanford 0.
"It was garbage," Berryman said, speaking of
the second Bruin score. "We were caught stand
ing. It was just one of those lapses."
Stanford's two lapses, however, were enough
to send Stanford home a loser.
"I think we played them evenly most of the
game," Berryman said. "We played sound
defense for 89 minutes."
Games in this league, though, last a full 90
minutes. The Cardinal's one minute lunch break
proved costly. The lapses, teamed with some
pretty strange bounces, spelled defeat.
"I was pleased with the way we played them,"
Stanford's Coach Helen Keohane said, "It could
have gone either way. We had a lot of nice
chances, but we couldn't take advantage of them

like we should. We just have to get the breaks
and the bounces."
In the second half, the Stanford players
seemed to be weary. Despite repeated exhorta
tions like "Every ball is your ball" from the Stan
ford bench, Bruin women were more often than
not the first to pick up a loose ball.
"They had some fast people that could outrun
us," Keohane said. "Besides this was there first
game and our sixth. They were a little more
fresh. Games and injuries do take their toll."
After yesterday's debacle, the women's
season mark stands at 2-3-1. Previously, Stan
ford fell to San Fransisco State 1-0, and to UC-
Santa Barbara 5-0. The Card tied Westmont Col
lege 0-0, and downed both UC-Davis and Brig
ham Young University at 3-0.
In explaining her team's travails, Keohane
pointed to the Cardinal's relative youth (Stanford
returns only seven upper-classmen) compared
to last year's squad.
"We have a lot of freshmen and sophomores,
and it takes time to learn to play together,"
Keohane said. "The enthusiasm is there, but we
still have to build a confidence that we are a good
team."
Berryman echoed Keohane's remarks.
"We've been pretty erratic. We've had moments
of brilliance, but at times we're a little confused
out there. We have plenty of talent, but it takes
time to get it all together."

Even though the Cardinal women booted the ball well all day
they never could get it in the net and dropped a 2-0 decision to
visiting UCLA.
