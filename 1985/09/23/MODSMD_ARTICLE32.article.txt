### 
LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) â€” Michael Spinks
ade boxing history Saturday night by outpoint
g previously unbeaten Larry Holmes to
;come the first light-heavyweight champion to
in the heavyweight title.
Spinks' unamimous 15-round decision ruined
e 35-year-old Holmes' attempt to tie Rocky
arciano's record of 49 victories without a loss.
Spinks, who weighed 200 pounds, 25 over the
[ht-heavyweight class limit, threw punches in
irries and never let Holmes get him in serious
ouble throughout the fight. In doing so, he did
hat nine previous light-heavyweight champions
former champions couldn't do in the
avyweight division.
A full house in an 11,192 seat outdoor arena at
e Riveria Hotel and Casino let out a wild roar
the decision was announced making Spinks
e International Boxing Federation champion,
iane Holmes sat quietly weeping beneath her
isband's corner.
Judges Dave Moretti and Harold Lederman
ich scored it 143-142 for the 29-year-old
>inks. Judge Lawrence Wallace scored it 145
2 for Spinks.
The AP favored Holmes 144-141.
Immediately after the bout, Holmes, saying he
ad nothing to prove," said he wouldn't fight
;ain.
Spinks, 6 foot-2, seemed to waste a lot of
ne moving back and forth in several rounds,
it the judges obviously thought he did enough.
When he did elect to fight, Spinks threw more
inches than Holmes and did land several of
em. Holmes, looking every bit his 35 years,
ver really got into his rhythm, but he did score
>11 with jabs and was effective to the body.

Following the major upset Holmes said
quietly, "I had my time."
The defeat came in his 22nd world title bout.
Now he will not become the second heavyweight
champion to retire undefeated.
Holmes pressed throughout but didn't throw
his right hand as much as his corner wanted him
to. When he did throw it, it was often to the
body.
Spinks threw a lot of jabs and never allowed
Holmes to trap him except on two or three occa
sions. One of them was in the 15th round when
Holmes shook Spinks with a left-right and right
left along the ropes, but Spinks escaped.
"He threw more effective punches," Moretti
said of Spinks.
"Michael used very, very good ring general
ship," said Lederman. "Michael was the ring
general.
"1 had it even going into the 15th and Michael
won the 15th."
Spinks did land a couple of good flurries after
Holmes shook him early in the round.
Of the added weight, Spinks said, "I didn't
lose any speed, 1 was hitting faster at the end
than the beginning."
Neither fighter was ever close to going down
and neither was marked badly.
Spinks did complain on several occasions that
Holmes was thumbing him with the left hand.
The victory for the undisputed light
heavyweight champion gave him a 28-0 record
with 19 knockouts and earned him a permanent
place in boxing legend.
The younger brother of former heavyweight
champion Spinks did what some of the

great fighters in the light-heavyweight division
could not do. Men like Georges Carpentier, Billy
Conn, Archie Moore and Bob Foster.
Spinks, a 6-1 underdog, also avenged his
brother's three-round knockout loss to Holmes
in 1981.
Spinks' victory came on the 30th anniversary
of Marciano's ninth-round knockout of Moore in
what was Marciano's last fight.
Holmes had said before the fight that he
wanted to run his record to 50-0 before the year
was out and then retire.
"1 want to close the book by the end of the
year," said Holmes.
Michael Spinks closed the book for him Satur
day night.
"I'm the champ, I'm the champ," shouted
Spinks in the ring.
Then he also said: "This was dedicated to the
love I lost, wherever she may be."
He was referring to his 4-year-old daughter
who died in an auto crash four months before
Spinks became the undisputed light-heavyweight
champion with a 15-round decision over Dwight
Muhammad Qawi on March 18, 1983.
When he signed for the fight for wliich he got
$900,000 plus $100,000 in expenses, he said: "I
want glory from this, I'll get glory from this."
Micb'iel Spinks, who will have to give up the
light-heavyweight crown if he wants to keep the
more prestigious and lucrative heavyweight title,
got his glory.
Holmes got $3 million plus $500,000 in ex
penses for the fight. It was not enough of a
payoff for what has to be an extremely disap
pointing defeat.
