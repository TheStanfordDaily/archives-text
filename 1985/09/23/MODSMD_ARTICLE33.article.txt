BALTIMORE (AP) â€” Billy
Martin, the embattled New York
Yankees' manager, suffered a
broken right arm in a fight with
pitcher Ed Whitson early yester
day at a Baltimore hotel.
Martin held an impromptu
news conference when he re
potted to Memorial Stadium for
yesterday's game against the
Baltimore Orioles with his arm in
a cast and a sling. Whitson, who
reportedly suffered a cut lip, had
been sent home.
"1 think it happened when he
kicked me," Martin said of the
broken tilnn bono in the forearm.
"Me kicked me once in the groin,
and once in the arm."
The latest in a series of brawls
involving the fiery Martin was
described by a security guard at
the Cross Keys Inn as "one of
the most brutal fights I've ever
seen."
Members of the Yankees'
traveling party said the brawl
started in the same hotel bar
where Martin was involved in a
shoving match with a patron
Friday night.
Players and members of the

media tried to break up the fis
ticuffs. But onlookers said the
fight continued each time Whit
son broke free, and continued
into the hotel lobby and the
parking lot, finally ending with a
shouting match on the third floor
of the hotel, where they yelled
and cursed loudly at each other.
Martin contended that he
became involved after trying to
act as a peacemaker in a budding
fight between Whitson and an
unidentified patron.
"I was sitting at the end of the
bar, talking with (infielder) Dale
Berra and his wife, and Whitson
was in a booth," Martin said. "A
guy told me, 'You'd better get
over there, Whitson's in trouble.'
"Dale and I went over," Mar
tin said, "and he had a guy
straightened up, like he was
going to belt him. 1 told him,
'Hey, don't get in trouble . . .
you don't need it.'
"I don't know what he said,
but he turned on me and went
crazy," Martin said. "He kicked
tne a couple of times."
