# Stanford Does Swimmingly in Irvine And Justifies its National Ranking
## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford water polo team
jumped into the ISBS season with a
splash, winning the University of
California-Irvine Tournament held
this past weekend in Irvine.
The Cardinal came out of the
tournament with six victories,
defeating Irvine in the final match
11-7, and outscoring its opponents
65-37 overall. Stanford's victory
hardly comes as surprise, at least
not if one looks to the pre-season
rankings that place the Cardinal in
the No. 1 spot on the charts.
"Everyone played well through
out the tournament and 1 think their
play is a very good indication that
we deserve our No.l ranking,"
Coach Dante Dettamanti said. "In
previous years, most of the time,
the team that won this tournament
also won the NCAAs."
The Cardinal started of the
tournament on Friday with a 12-7
victory over the USC "B" team.
Freshman Jeff Oeding led Stanford
with four goals.

Stanford went on to defeat the
University of Pacific that same day
13-5, led by junior Craig Klass' four
goals.
The Cardinal win streak contin
ued on Saturday as Stanford
downed Pepperdine 12-5, and USC
11-8.
On Sunday, the Cardinal faced off
with the N0.2-ranked UCLA
Bruins. The match proved to be the
first close game of the tournament
for Stanford, as the Bruins opened
up a 5-4 lead with less than two
minutes remaining in the match.
Junior Jamie Velez evened out
the score for the Cardinal with 1
minute and 53 seconds remaining,
and Klass scored the winning goal
with 53 seconds remaining to give
Stanford the victory that allowed it
to enter the final.
A Stanford victory was much less
in doubt in the tournament finale
against Irvine, as the Card opened
up a 10-5 lead in the third quarter.
Irvine added two goals in the final
quarter hut the Cardinal added one
of its own to win the match 11-7,
and the tournament.
"1 think we got better with each

game throughout the tournament,"
Dettamanti said. "Our best game of
the weekend, by far, was Sunday's
final.''
Stanford's leading scorers during
the tournament were Klass (16),
David Imbernino (10), Velez (7),
Matt Tingler (6) and Marvin Mouc
hawar (5).
After seeing his team in action
during the tournament, Dettamanti
seems confident about his team's
ability to have a winning season.
"We played very well
defensively. We were driving well
and our play in the hole was very
consistent," Dettamanti said. "To
beat the No. 2 team in the final by
four goals is quite a feat."
If the Cardinal's tournament vic
tory is any indication, Dettamanti's
hopes for an NCAA title this year
may become reality.
"This is probably the second
best team I have coached while at
Stanford," Dettamanti said. Ac
cording to the coach, his best team
was the 1981 squad that finished
the season with a 31-0 record and a
NCAA title.

"This team has been together for
two years now, and they're really
starting to know each other better
and play better together, which is
typical for a good team. We're start
ing to know each other's moves and
tendencies and play together so
much better," Dettamanti said.
The Cardinal is returning eight of
its top scorers from last year's
team that won the Pacific-10 title —
and finished second in the nation in
the NCAAs.
The team's only area of concern
may be the it's defense, where the
graduation of goalie Steve Moyer
leaves a huge void to fill. Sopho
more Obi Greenman and freshman
Todd Kemp will both be battling for
the starting goalie position this
year.
The Cardinal will play its first
non-tournament matches of the
season this weekend as it travels to
Fresno State on Friday (3 p.m.),
and to HOP (11 p.m.) and UC-
Davis (3 p.m.) on Saturday.
The team's first home matches
will be played during the Northern
California Tournament, October 4-
5 at DeGuerre Pool.
