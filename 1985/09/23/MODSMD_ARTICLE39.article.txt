# Muster, Cherry Match Up

### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
Just over a year ago, the names
Jrad Muster and Tony Cherry
neant nothing to the college foot
mil world, and not much more than
hat to their own coaches.
At the beginning of fall practice in
1984, Muster and Cherry were a

Well, that's exactly what hap

surprised observers by gaining 58
rards on only five carries. The next

line times for 94 yards and
eturned a kickoff 66 yards to set

By the end of the season, Cherry

surpassing senior standout Kevin
dcCall, and he was the leading
cickoff returner in the Pacific-10
Conference. He gained 569 yards

1 whopping 6.5 yards per carry.
Vith those flashy numbers, Cherry
-ated as a preseason honors candi
iate for 1985.
I Muster emerged a little later in
■he year, but his debut season was
■10 less spectacular. After Stanford
fcoach Jack Elway lost Marshall Dil
lard to injury, he tried out Brian
and Kaulana Park at fullback
lefore turning to Muster in the

season's fifth game, against UCLA.
Muster came off the bench to
gain 82 yards on 24 carries and play
a major role in Stanford's stunning
23-20 upset of the defending Rose
Bowl champions. He started the
last six games of the season, and,
incredibly, wound up leading the
Cardinal in both rushing and receiv
ing. He gained 823 yards on 184
carries, caught 31 passes for 228
yards, and was named to the All-
Conference second team after the
season.
The two backs met on the
gridiron for the first time Saturday
in Oregon's 45-28 win over Stan
ford — and they lived up to almost
every expectation that their fans
had of them. Cherry, in his first
home appearance of 1985, had the
best day of his major college
career. He ripped apart the Stan

ford defense for 227 yards and
three touchdowns on 27 rushes, in
cluding an 80-yard TD jaunt in the
fourth quarter, and caught six
passes for 33 yards.
Muster's performance was just
as impressive as Cherry's in every
area but one — he fumbled four
times and lost two of them. The
Stanford fullback had a career-best
14 catches out of the backfield for
169 yards and two touchdowns, and
carried the ball 21 times for 129
yards, but the loss and the fumbles
took the sweetness out of the stats
for him.
"Everybody was saying 'Forget
about it (fumbling), we'll get it
back," he said afterwards. "They
were right, I should have tried to
forget about it. I don't have any

Cherry didn't have to offer any
excuses, just some thanks. "The
offensive line dug down deep in
their hearts and did a great job," he
said. "They were baffled in the first
part of the game — they didn't
know what they could and couldn't
do. After that, they started to dom
inate."

"I was confident going into the
game," he continued. "I knew no
one had run on them yzt. And 14
points is pretty much nothing for us
to overcome." Outside of the
similarity of their success stories,
Muster and Cherry have very little
in common. Cherry is a darting run
ner with average hands who is
listed at 5-foot-8, 184 pounds, but
looks closer to 5-6 in person.
Muster is a big, bruising back (6-3,
215 pounds) with enough speed and
hand coordination to be a wide
