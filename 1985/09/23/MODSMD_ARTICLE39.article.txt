# Muster, Cherry Match Up
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
Just over a year ago, the names
Jrad Muster and Tony Cherry
neant nothing to the college foot
mil world, and not much more than
hat to their own coaches.
At the beginning of fall practice in
1984, Muster and Cherry were a
>air of relative nobodies, a redshirt
reshman and a redshirt junior
juried deep in the backfield depth
:harts at Stanford and Oregon,
espectively. They were among the
ow-stringers, the guys who have
:lean uniforms after home games
tnd don't make the traveling squads
or road trips.
The only chance they had of get
ing playing time in 1984 was if all
he backs rated ahead of them failed
0 do the job expected of them.
Well, that's exactly what hap
jened. Injuries to Oregon's tail
jacks jumped Cherry into the
second-string slot before last year's
>pener against Long Beach State.
}iven the chance to play, he
surprised observers by gaining 58
rards on only five carries. The next
veek, against Colorado, he carried
line times for 94 yards and
eturned a kickoff 66 yards to set
ip a touchdown.
By the end of the season, Cherry
vas Oregon's leading rusher,
surpassing senior standout Kevin
dcCall, and he was the leading
cickoff returner in the Pacific-10
Conference. He gained 569 yards
>n only 87 rushes, leaving him with
1 whopping 6.5 yards per carry.
Vith those flashy numbers, Cherry
-ated as a preseason honors candi
iate for 1985.
I Muster emerged a little later in
■he year, but his debut season was
■10 less spectacular. After Stanford
fcoach Jack Elway lost Marshall Dil
lard to injury, he tried out Brian
and Kaulana Park at fullback
lefore turning to Muster in the

season's fifth game, against UCLA.
Muster came off the bench to
gain 82 yards on 24 carries and play
a major role in Stanford's stunning
23-20 upset of the defending Rose
Bowl champions. He started the
last six games of the season, and,
incredibly, wound up leading the
Cardinal in both rushing and receiv
ing. He gained 823 yards on 184
carries, caught 31 passes for 228
yards, and was named to the All-
Conference second team after the
season.
The two backs met on the
gridiron for the first time Saturday
in Oregon's 45-28 win over Stan
ford — and they lived up to almost
every expectation that their fans
had of them. Cherry, in his first
home appearance of 1985, had the
best day of his major college
career. He ripped apart the Stan

ford defense for 227 yards and
three touchdowns on 27 rushes, in
cluding an 80-yard TD jaunt in the
fourth quarter, and caught six
passes for 33 yards.
Muster's performance was just
as impressive as Cherry's in every
area but one — he fumbled four
times and lost two of them. The
Stanford fullback had a career-best
14 catches out of the backfield for
169 yards and two touchdowns, and
carried the ball 21 times for 129
yards, but the loss and the fumbles
took the sweetness out of the stats
for him.
"Everybody was saying 'Forget
about it (fumbling), we'll get it
back," he said afterwards. "They
were right, I should have tried to
forget about it. I don't have any

Like Stanford's Brad Muster, Oregon scat-back Tony Cherry
enjoyed a big afternoon. He juked and darted his way for 227
yards rushing.
