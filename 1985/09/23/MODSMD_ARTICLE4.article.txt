# Registration by Computer Expected by Winter
## 
### MARY YUH Editorial staff 
For approximately 250 students in the
Ichool of Earth Sciences participating in a
est of a computer-aided system, the
fegistration crush at Maples is a thing of the
Ipast.
J These students have already registered
by mail, and during the regular registration
jdays they will simply pay tuition and Offer
feedback on the experiment. Within two
[weeks, like everyone else, they must turn
nn their study lists.
If the test is successful, traditional
JPermits-To- Register will be eliminated by
(winter quarter, and students will be mailed
ja registration agreement sometime in late
(November, according to Registrar Sally
Mahoney and Asst. Registrar Bob
Thompson. Students must sign the agree

ment, indicating that the information on the
form is correct, that they are registering
for winter quarter and that they agree to
pay the tuition.
"We'll know in the next month if the pro
cedure is ready for winter (quarter),"
Mahoney said. "We only want to do it when
we're fully confident because we know that
even if we're confident, there are bound to
be hitches. We want to eliminate as many
problems as possible before we involve the
entire student body."
The new registration procedure is made
possible by the continued development of
the Network for Student Information (NSI),
a joint venture of several offices, including
the registrar, the controller, the dean of
graduate studies, financial aids, undergrad
uate ; dvising, the dean of student affairs,
undergraduate admissions and Information
Technology Services.

The new procedure holds several advan
tages, according to Mahoney and
Thompson.
Because records in the Graduate Awards
Office, the Financial Aids Office and the
Bursar's Office are now electronically
linked, students can be presented with "net
bills" that apply financial aid directly to their
accounts. The net bottom line will repre
sent what must be paid out of pocket by the
student.
The net bill eliminates the need for stu
dents to pick up their financial aid from one
line in Maples and hand it back to the Uni
versity in another line as they pay their tui
tion. Also, fewer graduate students should
have to stand in fee-adjustment lines, as
their individual tuition assessments will be
known from the beginning.
"Basically we're letting our students do
the walking for us now," said Mahoney.

"Over time we can abandon the Maples
ritual of standing in lines."
In addition, course reservation arrange
ments can be handled in ways more tailored
to the advising programs of the schools and
of the Undergraduate Advising Office.
Another advantage is that students may
eventually be able to register for more than
one quarter at a time, although they will be
billed at each term rather than once for all
the quarters. This will be especially helpful
to students overseas and for medical stu
dents on hospital assignments, Mahoney
said.
The procedure will "put the focus on
registering in advance of the term,"
Mahoney said. Students may eventually be
able to advance register in May for the com
ing autumn quarter, she said. It will also be
possible to annul registration before the
term starts without any penalty.

Mahoney emphasized that "all of this is
quite dependent on the mails . . . and on
having very accurate student addresses."
The assumption is that the information in
the University's data base is correct unless
it is corrected by the student, according to
Thompson.
Thompson said he expects that students
will be more diligent than in the past about
reporting correct mailing addresses since
the information will be a necessary link in
the registration procedure. He noted that
most seniors who needed to receive infor
mation about graduation were quicker to
correct their mailing addresses than other
undergraduates.
The new procedure is not expected to be
more costly than the current one. Rather, a
cost benefit is expected as the procedure
reduces the budget base of the par
ticipating departments and
in a more orderly financial process
as the flow of money is facilitated,

according to Thompson.
Mahoney expressed some con
cern about the fate of what she
called "the Stanford fair" of tables
and displays set up by student or
ganizations outside Maples during
registration. When the Maples ritual
is abandoned, these organizations

must find another place to solid
student interest at the beginning!
each quarter.
Although Mahoney said she h
no definite plans for an alternatj
site, she suggested White Plaza as
possible alternative because of j
central location.
