# Reach Out: How To Phone for Less
## 
### SYDNEY SMITH Editorial staff 
Joe Stanford is cool. He goes to a famous
university. He knows a lot. He can handle
himself in almost every situation, from
catching a football to aceing that final he
didn't study for. But when it comes to
choosing a long distance phone company,
Joe finds himself lost in a mass of advertis
ing gimmicks, fast-talking salesmen and
confusing paperwork.
Nor can Joe ignore this situation; if he
does, Pacific Bell will automatically give his
long distance account to AT&T. And when
mom and dad find out, they will call Joe and
say, "Joe, are you stupid? You're spending
too much money on long distance phone
calls." What is Joe to do?
In its application for local phone service,
Pacific Bell lists the names and toll-free
phone numbers of long-distance carriers in
the Stanford area. After hours of phone
calls, lengthy questions and lengthier
answers, Joe Stanford will find that there
exist more attractive alternatives to letting
Pacific Bell choose AT&T for him.
The bigwig of the long distance carriers,
AT&T seems to have enough faith in its
popularity to charge higher rates than any
Dther company. AT&T charges in one
minute increments, which means that a cal
er may be charged for up to one minute
ifter hanging up the phone. There is no
minimum balance or service charge at
AT&T, except for calls made with an
a\T&T calling card, which have surcharges
S)f $1.05 for calls to areas over 22 miles
feway.
Unlike many other long distance carri
ers, however, AT&T does offer a special
Calling package, called the "Reach-Out
America Plan." Students subscribing to this
plan garner substantial savings on out-of-
Btate calls made between 11 p.m. and 8
i.m. Monday through Thursday and from
11 p.m. Friday to 5 p.m. Sunday. The first
lour of out-of-state calls costs $9.45 per
month under this plan, with each additional
lour costing $8.25.
According to a salesman at SBS Skyline,

an AT&T competitor, this rate computes to
16.6 cents per minute, which is 0.6 cents
higher than the SBS rate. AT&T does,
however, discount the $8.25 hourly rate by
15 percent for all calls placed during the
Sunday time period.
If out-of-state calls are placed between 5
p.m. and 11 p.m. Monday through Friday
under the "Reach-Out" plan, the rate jumps
$1.40 per hour to $10.85 for the first hour
and to $9.65 for each additional hour.
According to a newly instituted policy,

customers in the 415 area code will have
"equal access" to all long distance carriers,
Touch-tone phones will not be required,
nor will the time-consuming dialing of
access codes.
Although the alternatives to AT&T vary
in rates and charges, all are alike in their
policy of no service charges (except in as
sociation with calling cards).
One of the least expensive alternatives
to AT&T (with ITT as a close competitor)
is SBS Skyline. Like AT&T, SBS charges

in one-minute intervals. Just for choosing
SBS Skyline as a long distance carrier, the
customer will receive a $24 long distance
credit. SBS also offers a calling card, with a
one-time charge of $20 for processing fees.
ITT also runs on one-minute intervals
and offers a volume discount of 2 to 10 per
cent on all monthly bills over $15. Although
ITT does offer a calling card, interested
students should call ITT to inquire about
possible card surcharges.
Another alternative to AT&T is the

American Network Savenet company. Ac
cording to a salesman for this company,
American Network's flat rates are 20 to 40
percent lower than AT&T rates. Also,
American Network charges in six-second
intervals, as opposed to the more common
one-minute intervals, which may make a
small difference on shorter calls. American
Network does not offer a calling card, but
does offer a 1-800 number alternative that
even the American Network salesman con
sidered "ineffective." American Network is
unique among carriers in requiring a mini
mum of $130 in long distance calls per
month to qualify as a customer.
Roommates could, of course, subscribe un
der one name to meet the minimum bill re
quirements.
Though GTE Sprint Communications is
perhaps the best-known carrier besides
AT&T, Sprint's rates are slightly higher.
Like AT&T, SBS and ITT, Sprint runs on
one-minute intervals. Sprint does offer
volume dialing discounts comparable to
those offered by ITT. "Volume dialing"
provides 3 percent daytime discounts, 8
percent evening discounts, and 9 percent
discounts at night and on weekends — if the
customer's long distance bill runs higher
than $19.95 in one month. As for calling
cards, Sprint claims a 40 to 70 percent dis
count off AT&T surcharges and charges no
extra fee for receiving the card.
U.S. Telephone Inc. has rates almost
identical rates to Sprint's. Unlike Sprint,
U.S. Telephone runs on six-second inter
vals, but offers no volume discount, since
the carrier claims a "24-hour discount
rate." Compared to Sprint, however, U.S.
Telephone's calling card is no discount,
with a 50 to 90 cent surcharge on each call
made with the card.;
Another big name in long distance carri
ers, MCI has about the third highest rates
of the carriers in this survey. Like
Sprint, MCI runs on one-minute intervals,
and offers a 2 to 9 percent volume discount
if the customer spends over $20 per month
on long distance calls. MCI does offer a call-

ing card, which can be used when
placing calls to certain locations in
Canada and the United States, has a
surcharge of $0.55 on each call.
Besides using the calling card, MCI
customers wishing to place a long
distance call from a remote location
have the option of using the "950-
1022" number, at a surcharge of
$0.55 per call, or the "800" num
ber, at a surcharge of $1.05 per
call.
Allnet Dial Service surprisingly
offers regular rates that are higher
than any other carrier, including
AT&T. Allnet does offer six
second interval billing and substan
tial volume discounts. Besides a
volume discount of 2.5 percent day
time, 7.25 percent evenings and
5.25 percent on nights and
weekends for any monthly bill over
$20, Allnet offers two hours of free
calling during holidays. Although Al
lnet does not have calling cards, the
customer can use an "800" number
for out-of-state calls.
Even with all the hype of volume
discounts and super-low rates, stu
dents may find themselves with
long distance bills beyond their cash
on hand.

one-time charge of $20 for processing fees.
ITT also runs on one-minute intervals
and offers a volume discount of 2 to 10 per
cent on all monthly bills over $15. Although
ITT does offer a calling card, interested
students should call ITT to inquire about
possible card surcharges.
Another alternative to AT&T is the

American Network Savenet company. Ac
cording to a salesman for this company,
American Network's flat rates are 20 to 40
percent lower than AT&T rates. Also,
American Network charges in six-second
intervals, as opposed to the more common
one-minute intervals, which may make a
small difference on shorter calls. American
Network does not offer a calling card, but
does offer a 1-800 number alternative that
even the American Network salesman con
sidered "ineffective." American Network is
unique among carriers in requiring a mini
mum of $130 in long distance calls per
month to qualify as a customer.
Roommates could, of course, subscribe un
der one name to meet the minimum bill re
quirements.
Though GTE Sprint Communications is
perhaps the best-known carrier besides
AT&T, Sprint's rates are slightly higher.
Like AT&T, SBS and ITT, Sprint runs on
one-minute intervals. Sprint does offer
volume dialing discounts comparable to
those offered by ITT. "Volume dialing"
provides 3 percent daytime discounts, 8
percent evening discounts, and 9 percent
discounts at night and on weekends — if the
customer's long distance bill runs higher
than $19.95 in one month. As for calling
cards, Sprint claims a 40 to 70 percent dis
count off AT&T surcharges and charges no
extra fee for receiving the card.
U.S. Telephone Inc. has rates almost
identical rates to Sprint's. Unlike Sprint,
U.S. Telephone runs on six-second inter
vals, but offers no volume discount, since
the carrier claims a "24-hour discount
rate." Compared to Sprint, however, U.S.
Telephone's calling card is no discount,
with a 50 to 90 cent surcharge on each call
made with the card.;
Another big name in long distance carri
ers, MCI has about the third highest rates
of the carriers in this survey. Like
Sprint, MCI runs on one-minute intervals,
and offers a 2 to 9 percent volume discount
if the customer spends over $20 per month
on long distance calls. MCI does offer a call-

ing card, which can be used when
placing calls to certain locations in
Canada and the United States, has a
surcharge of $0.55 on each call.
Besides using the calling card, MCI
customers wishing to place a long
distance call from a remote location
have the option of using the "950-
1022" number, at a surcharge of
$0.55 per call, or the "800" num
ber, at a surcharge of $1.05 per
call.
Allnet Dial Service surprisingly
offers regular rates that are higher
than any other carrier, including
AT&T. Allnet does offer six
second interval billing and substan
tial volume discounts. Besides a
volume discount of 2.5 percent day
time, 7.25 percent evenings and
5.25 percent on nights and
weekends for any monthly bill over
$20, Allnet offers two hours of free
calling during holidays. Although Al
lnet does not have calling cards, the
customer can use an "800" number
for out-of-state calls.
Even with all the hype of volume
discounts and super-low rates, stu
dents may find themselves with
long distance bills beyond their cash
on hand.
Joe Stanford is cool. He goes to a famous
university. He knows a lot. He can handle
himself in almost every situation, from
catching a football to aceing that final he
didn't study for. But when it comes to
choosing a long distance phone company,
Joe finds himself lost in a mass of advertis
ing gimmicks, fast-talking salesmen and
confusing paperwork.
Nor can Joe ignore this situation; if he
does, Pacific Bell will automatically give his
long distance account to AT&T. And when
mom and dad find out, they will call Joe and
say, "Joe, are you stupid? You're spending
too much money on long distance phone
calls." What is Joe to do?
In its application for local phone service,
Pacific Bell lists the names and toll-free
phone numbers of long-distance carriers in
the Stanford area. After hours of phone
calls, lengthy questions and lengthier
answers, Joe Stanford will find that there
exist more attractive alternatives to letting
Pacific Bell choose AT&T for him.
The bigwig of the long distance carriers,
AT&T seems to have enough faith in its
popularity to charge higher rates than any
Dther company. AT&T charges in one
minute increments, which means that a cal
er may be charged for up to one minute
ifter hanging up the phone. There is no
minimum balance or service charge at
AT&T, except for calls made with an
a\T&T calling card, which have surcharges
S)f $1.05 for calls to areas over 22 miles
feway.
Unlike many other long distance carri
ers, however, AT&T does offer a special
Calling package, called the "Reach-Out
America Plan." Students subscribing to this
plan garner substantial savings on out-of-
Btate calls made between 11 p.m. and 8
i.m. Monday through Thursday and from
11 p.m. Friday to 5 p.m. Sunday. The first
lour of out-of-state calls costs $9.45 per
month under this plan, with each additional
lour costing $8.25.
According to a salesman at SBS Skyline,

an AT&T competitor, this rate computes to
16.6 cents per minute, which is 0.6 cents
higher than the SBS rate. AT&T does,
however, discount the $8.25 hourly rate by
15 percent for all calls placed during the
Sunday time period.
If out-of-state calls are placed between 5
p.m. and 11 p.m. Monday through Friday
under the "Reach-Out" plan, the rate jumps
$1.40 per hour to $10.85 for the first hour
and to $9.65 for each additional hour.
According to a newly instituted policy,

customers in the 415 area code will have
"equal access" to all long distance carriers,
Touch-tone phones will not be required,
nor will the time-consuming dialing of
access codes.
Although the alternatives to AT&T vary
in rates and charges, all are alike in their
policy of no service charges (except in as
sociation with calling cards).
One of the least expensive alternatives
to AT&T (with ITT as a close competitor)
is SBS Skyline. Like AT&T, SBS charges

in one-minute intervals. Just for choosing
SBS Skyline as a long distance carrier, the
customer will receive a $24 long distance
credit. SBS also offers a calling card, with a
one-time charge of $20 for processing fees.
ITT also runs on one-minute intervals
and offers a volume discount of 2 to 10 per
cent on all monthly bills over $15. Although
