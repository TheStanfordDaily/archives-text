The written word is like
a sand castle. All the words,
like grains of sand,
are already there, waiting
to be shaped into beauty
by the hands of
the skilled craftsman.

The builder labors many
hours to create the finished
piece, a piece which is
an extension of himself \ and
which will be inevitably
swept into nothing
by the flow of time.
