# NEW COURSE HIGHLIGHTS

Non-Western Culture Courses
Political Science 21-22 (same as Anthropology
21-22 and History 21-22), "The World Outside the
West," is a new course sequence that has been
specially developed to provide a non-western
perspective on contact between European nations
and East Asia, West Africa, and Mexico. Enrollment
in either course satisfies Area Five, enrollment in
both courses satisfies Areas Five and Three.
The Department of Religious Studies has ex
panded its course offerings that fulfill the non-
Western culture requirement. Reliqious Studies 18,
a new course on Zen Buddhism, will be offered in
Winter Quarter: Religious Studies 1.D., "Religions of
the East," will offer additional sections and provide
an optional discussion section for one additional unit
of credit. (Area Three).
Courses designated as non-Western tend to
have limited enrollments and to be very heavily
subscribed. So students are advised to plan
ahead and to take their non-Western courses as
early as possible In their Stanford years.
VTSS 51-52-53:
Nature of Technology,
Mathematics, and Science
(Same as Physics 16-17-18)
This new sequence for non-science majors satis
fies Areas Six, Seven and Eight of the Distribution
Requirements if you complete the three-course
sequence. Professors James Adams (Engineering),
Alexander Fetter (Physics), and Robert Osserman
(Mathematics) are the instructors.
The course assumes only high-school-level
mathematical competence.
Additional information is available in the VTSS
program office (Building 370).
Computer Science
The 105 A course will have less of a programming
emphasis and more emphasis on topics of interest
to humanities students.

106 is a two-quarter sequence entitled "Intro
duction to Software Engineering." 106 A has a
stronger software engineering perspective. 1068 is
a new course that shows more advanced software
engineering techniques. 1068 replaces 107. Either
105 A or 106 A alone satisfies the Area 8 distribution
requirement. A new course, 106 X, is an accelerated
version of 106 A & B that covers basic software en
gineering techniques more quickly. 106 X has been
designed for students who want a one-quarter pre
requisite to 108 and who can handle a faster-paced
course.
108, our course in the fundamentals of computer
science, is now expanded into a three-quarter
sequence, 5 units per quarter.
A final note: an undergraduate computer science
major may be in place by the 1986-87 school year.
Students interested in preparing themselves for the
major should consider taking the new 108 sequence
which has prerequisites of 106 x or 1068 or the old
107.
Introductory History Seminars
The Introductory History Seminars are designed
to introduce the undergraduate major or prospective
major to the processes of historical investigation
and intepretation by which archival material be
comes narrative description and explanation, and by
which interpretation itself becomes open to disag
reement and revision.
The Introductory Seminars have limited enroll
ment, so students are required to sign up in ad
vanced with the professor.
Introductory Seminars offered in 1985-86 are:
Autumn
565: Women in the American West (Pascoe)
41S: Aspects of* Modern Britain (Stansky)
51S: Power and Imagination in the :d4u 6
325: Politics and Spectacle in France and Eng
land, 1600-1789 (Bryant)
Winter
525: Making of the Constitution (Rakove)
535: Progressivism and Social Conflict (Ethington)
795: Mexico as Intellectual Creation (Bowser)

Spring
425: Early Modern London: The Creation of a New
Urban Culture (Seaver)
78S-.Spanish America as Non-Western Culture
(Bowser)
16S: Society of Renaissance Florence (Brown)
Linguistics
The Linguistics major has been restructured to
provide a solid intellectual core on which to build a
number of specializations, the most popular of which
include Linguistics and Cognitive Science, Compu
tational Linguistics, Sociolinguistics, and Speech
Production and Perception.
Many courses have been rethought (all have new
numbers). Entirely new courses include L6ON Lan
guage past and present (Kipanky, Autumn), on
change and diversity, language as a window on pre
history and implications for language policy in mul
tilingual societies; LIOON, Universals and typology of
language (Ferguson, Winter), on characteristics of
human language as evidenced by a comparison of
the world s languages.

Special Language Program
New advanced courses in Arabic and American
Sign Langauge will be offered by the Special Lan
guage Program if enrollment permits. Beginning and
intermediate courses in some twenty langauges are
also available. Visit 381 A Math Corner for a com
plete listing.
International Relations
IR 196, "Research and Writing Seminar," is a new
course recommended for majors who wish to im
prove their research and writing skills. It will be
especially useful for current and future honors thesis
candidates. The course will emphasize the funda
mentals of research design and examine major
types of research methods in International Rela
tions.
The course will be given for three units in Autumn
Quarter.

American Studies
American Studies encourages students to design
a new course on a subject not concerned by current
offerings. Course developement is expected to take
place during Winter Quarter so that the course can
be offered during Spring Quarter. Students may
earn credit for their work. Funds for firms, honoraria
or speicla projects associated with the course are
also available.
New courses include American Studies 179, "In
troduction to American Law" taught by Professor
Lawrence Friedman (Autumn), American Studies
51, "American Culture Since the 1850's" taught by
Richard Gillam, visiting professor of history (Winter),
and American Studies 222, "America in Vietnam"
taught by Professor Jack Rakove who will become
the new chairman of American Studies (Spring).
Physics
New courses include:
Phys 145 Physics of Nuclear Weapons
Phys 167 Essential General Relativity
Phys 168 History of Modern Physics
Phys 169 Experimentation in
20th Century Physics
English
Two new research opportunities have been
added to the English Department's curriculum. First,
the Department now allows students to write a five
unit follow-up paper based on material covered in
class. The student must have successfully com
pleted the class and have the consent of the in
structor. Second, the Department provides an op
portunity for students to integrate materials from two
or three classes having a clear thematic or historical
relationship by writing one large-scale paper. The
classes should be taken either simultaneously or
consecutively and the student should have the con
sent of the instructor.
For more information about either of these
changes, consult the Stanford University Bulletin or
call Martin Evans (497-3817).
