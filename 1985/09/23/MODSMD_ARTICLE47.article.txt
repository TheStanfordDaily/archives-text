McFarlane Sees Arms Accord
WASHINGTON — A senior White House official predicted yester
day that the United States and Soviet Union would reach "some kind
of arms agreement" within a year.
Robert McFarlane, President Reagan's assistant for national se
curity affairs, said he believed the agreement would include elements
governing strategic defense, reductions of offensive nuclear weap
ons and limits on other nations' ability to obtain nuclear weapons.
McFarlane's comments followed by one day the president's warn
ing against "false hopes" in connection with his planned summit con
ference with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
The Reagan Administration is privately developing the positions it
will present when Reagan and Gorbachev meet Nov. 19-20 in
Geneva at the same time that it is publicly maneuvering for interna
tional support in presenting its views on arms control and the overall
state of U.S.-Soviet relations.
Last week, the Pentagon released a report publicizing Soviet ef
forts to obtain U.S. weapons and high technology, and officials sug
gested limiting the number of Soviet citizens working in the United
States to the number of Americans working in the Soviet Union.
On this subject, McFarlane said the United States was reviewing
its practice of hiring Soviet mechanics and maintenance workers at
its embassy in Moscow and predicted that "there'll be some
changes."
Approximately 950 Soviet citizens work in the United States and
about 320 Americans are employed in the Soviet Union. In addition,
the U.S. Embassy in Moscow employs about 200 Soviets, although
the Soviet Union's diplomatic installations here hire no Americans,
the State Department says.
McFarlane, speaking on the ABC News program "This Week with
David Brinkley," disputed the Soviet contention that it has
abandoned work on a space-defense system and said the Soviets
have "the most advanced SDI (Strategic Defense Initiative) on the
face of the Earth." SDI is the official name for the proposed U.S.
space-based defense system popularly known as "Star Wars."
McFarlane added: "The president's position is (that) both of us can
gain by the integration of non-nuclear defense into our forces and
getting rid of our nuclear weapons." However, he acknowledged,
there was no certainty that a "Star Wars" system, if developed,
would not involve nuclear weapons, or that it would lead to the aboli
tion of all nuclear offensive systems.
To the suggestion that years of stalemate in arms control efforts
would follow continued Soviet insistence that the United States drop
its work on the Strategic Defense Initiative, McFarlane responded:
"There is a very good prospect that there will be some kind of
arms agreement in the next year's time."
He said the components of such an agreement could not be
defined, but that certain elements could already be seen:
• "The Soviets believe very strongly in strategic defense. They have
an enormous investment in it. So, there's going to be some kind of
strategic defense on both sides."
•At the same time, taking "their public statements at face value,"
the Soviets "have said they want to reduce offensive systems," so
"we . . . will define . . . what mix of offense and defense serves the
security interests of us all."
• And the Soviets have a "self-interest" in making sure that addi
tional nations do not obtain nuclear weapons.
Defending the Reagan administration's insistence on proceeding
with the five-year, $26 billion Strategic Defense Initiative research
project, McFarlane said, "We have to have some military means of
compensating for (the Soviet) advantage."
South Africa Ends Angola Raid
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — After a week-long, cross
border raid into Angola, South African forces yesterday returned to
their bases in Namibia, claiming to have killed 15 black guerrillas of
the South-West Africa People's Organization, captured 54 others and
driven several hundred more away from the border area, disrupting
a planned offensive.
Maj. Gen. George Meiring, commander of the South African
forces, said in a statement in Windhoek, the capital of Namibia (also
called South-West Africa), that the 500-man South African task force
had suffered no casualties in nine skirmishes with the guerrillas. The
SWAPO guerrillas have been fighting nearly 20 years in an effort to
gain independence for the South African-administered territory.
The U.N. Security Council on Friday unanimously condemned the
South African operation, calling for the troops' immediate
withdrawal. The United States strongly criticized the incursion as
adding to the instability of the region and as further undermining
negotiations on Namibian independence.
Meanwhile, the Angolan Defense Ministry in Luanda claimed that
South Africa's real intention was to deflect an offensive by Angolan
forces, their largest in a decade-long civil war against right-wing
rebels of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
The insurgents have had considerable South African support for
many years.
The Namibian rebels for years have used Angola, just to the north
of their homeland, as a base area for mounting attacks on the South
African administrators of Namibia.
China Selects 64 Young Leaders
PEKING — A special conference of the Chinese Communist
Party selected yesterday 64 relatively young new members for the
party Central Committee, a majority of them supporters of Chinese
Leader Deng Xiaoping's economic reform program.
The newly promoted members will replace veteran Communist
Party officials who retired last week. Their elevation apparently
gives Deng a solid bloc of support on the Central Committee for his
ongoing effort to introduce market reforms and to reduce the role of
central planning in China's socialist economy.
The official New China News Agency reported that new members
have an average age of 50.1 years and that 76 percent of them have
had some form of college education. Overall, only 4 percent of the 40
million members of the Chinese Communist Party have a college
education.
"The succession from the old to the new in the party's central
leadership aims at keeping the party's cause in full bloom, meeting
the demand of increasingly heavy tasks and organizationally guaran
teeing the continuity of the party's principles and policies," the news
agency said
The news agency added that the new Central Committee mem
bers were elected "by secret ballot" but provided no further details
of the selection process.
The Central Committee, which includes more than 300 full and al
ternate members, will meet later this week to choose new members
for the Politburo, the 25-member group that sets policy for the
party.
