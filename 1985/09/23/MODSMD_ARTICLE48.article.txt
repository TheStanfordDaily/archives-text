# Mexican Nightmare Continues
## 
### 
MEXICO CITY — Defying the
odds, rescue workers dug deep into
crumbled buildings yesterday,
searching for trapped survivors still
hanging onto life under the debris
four days after Mexico City's devas
tating earthquake.
Mayor Ramon Aguirre estimated
at 2,000 the number of victims
pinned in the rubble of the capital's
collapsed structures, most of them
given up for dead by now. But
firefighters and other rescue
workers reported occasional con
tacts with victims who continued to
show signs of life.
A specially trained disaster unit
of French firefighters, in the van
guard of an international relief effort
now estimated at $2 billion, began
working in the rubble using
ultrasensitive audio detection
equipment.
As aid from abroad flowed in,
there were reports from Washing
ton that the International Monetary
Fund, which had cut off lending to
Mexico on the day of the
earthquake, was considering ex
tending up to $400 million in emer
gency credits.
Aguirre reported that more than
1,600 bodies have been pulled from
the city's wreckage in addition to
the 2,000 he estimated were still
buried in debris. Unofficial death
toll estimates were sharply higher.
U.S. Ambassador John Gavin said
Saturday that the final count could
rise to 10,000 oi even 20,000.
Rescue workers interviewed at
several collapsed buildings said no
organized attempt has been made
to gather estimates of the number

of persons trapped at each site.
This led to speculation that more
victims and bodies lie pinned
beneath the rubble than the
Mexican government has tallied up
so far.
Interior Minister Manuel Bartlett
Diaz told Mexican reporters that he
and President Miguel de la Madrid
have received reports of relatively
light damage in the states of Jalisco,
Colima, Michoacan, Guerrero and
Mexico. Although several dozen
persons were reported killed
outside the capital, Mexico City suf
fered by far the highest casualties
and damages of the 34 states and
one federal district, he said.
The international aid flowing into
this stricken city included two
British army helicopters and a
Hercules transport with lifting and
cutting gear from a base in nearby
Belize; two Israeli army teams en
route with rubble-clearing and res
cue equipment developed for use in
Lebanon, and a U.S. Air Force C
-141 carrying water pumps, power
saws, generators and other equip
ment.
Red Cross and government
workers set up supply centers for
the thousands of families still camp
ing out in the streets, afraid to
return to damaged apartments or
left without housing by the tremor.
Food and blankets, much of it
donated, were distributed at the
centers for families with nowhere
to go.
Police reported that some looting
took place during the night. But
these incidents appeared scattered
in a city with streets full of shat

tered store windows and apartment
buildings gaping open. Police and
soldiers closed off many of the
hardest hit areas, allowing passage
only to officials or residents.
The major part of the city
survived intact. Devastating
damage was wrought on a few
populous neighborhoods, but the
quake struck with almost finicky
precision. While about half of the
tourist area known as the Zona
Rosa was shut down, waterless and
dark, on the other side of Niza
Street, which runs through it, res
taurants and boutiques were open
for business.
The southern portion of the city,

which is generally greener, &
populated, and the favored plan
residence of artists and iniet
tuals, was unscathed.
While the earthquakes!
struck twice in less than 48 ht
last week were catastrophic, {<
only added to the urban nightr.
of a long-suffering city, which,
gether with its suburbs, harbor
population of 17 million.
According to Mayor Ran
Aguirre Beltran's prelimiit
report on the quake damage, al
800 residential and office build
were destroyed or were so bi
damaged that they must
demolished.
