# France Admits Sinking Peace Ship
## 
### 
PARIS — The French government admitted
responsibility yesterday for the July 10 sinking of
the Greenpeace protest ship Rainbow Warrior in
Auckland, New Zealand.
Premier Laurent Fabius said French secret
service agents acting under orders had sunk the
ship. His brief statement follows the resignation
Friday of Defense Minister Charles Hernu and
the dismissal of France's external intelligence
chief, Vice Admiral Pierre Lacoste.
Hernu had steadily denied ordering the sinking
of the ship, which was destroyed by explosives,
killing a photographer for the ecology group on
board.
Two French agents, who at first had identified
themselves as a married Swiss couple carrying
Swiss passports, were arrested by New Zealand
investigators in connection with the sinking.
They are still in custody.

Fabius made the statement in his office in the
presence of new Defense Minister Paul Quiles,
whose investigative efforts brought the truth of
France's responsibility in the sinking to light.
Fabius said French President Francois Mitter
rand was informed immediately of the "harsh
truth,"and he identified the agents as members
of the government's external security service.
He announced a reorganization of the service
and said the government would name a new chief
of the agency Wednesday.
Fabius also said the government has agreed to
a call by opposition political parties for the set
ting up of a parliamentary commission of inquiry.
The French premier did not name the individ
ual who gave the order for the sinking of the
Rainbow Warrior, which had been due to take
part in an action to protest against French nu

clear tests in the South Pacific.
A report issued only last month by the govt«
ment's own investigator, Bernard Trie
declared that the French government had b
blameless in the bombing of the ship, saying
agents accused of the bombing were acting
their own.
The report was greeted with widespread!
belief in France and derision abroad. Tricot la
acknowledged that he could have been mislf
by military officers.
Fabius cautioned Sunday against blaming o?
cers acting under orders.
The scandal seriously embarrassed Mitt :
rand's Socialist government, jeopardized its n
tions with the French military and undermil
the country's credibility abroad, according
French commentators.
