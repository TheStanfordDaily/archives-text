# Freed Killer Draws Interest, Fear
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
"1 have no intention of killing
kgain," convicted killer Theodore
ptreleski told reporters as he
walked free from the Correc
:ional Medical Facility at Vacaville
m Sept. 8. "On the other hand," he
continued, "I cannot predict the
uture. I murdered before."
Streleski, 49, served seven
fears and 20 days in prison for
)ludgeoning Stanford Mathematics
J rof. Karel deLeeuw to death with
i hammer in 1978. He has never
•xpressed any remorse over the
laying, and he has never promised
e will not return to the Stanford
ampus to kill again.
A doct oral candidate in Stanford's
• Mathematics Department for 19
•ears, Streleski has said the faculty
)ere thwarted his attempts at ob
aining a degree. He said he killed
ieLeeuw to protest Stanford's
reatment of graduate students.
In a prison interview just before
us release, Streleski said his
rime, and the media attention it
cceived, succeeded in publicizing

the plight of graduate students who
have been treated unfairly at Stan
ford.
"I judged correctly that the
notoriety would bring press
coverage," he said. "People may
make a value judgment about me or
the validity of my judgment, but still
I think I'm getting some message
out there. So it worked to that ex
tent."
Streleski said expressing
remorse would undermine his
cause.
"If I committed a murder to
criticize Stanford, if I express
remorse, I just throw my whole ar
gument in the wastebasket," he
said. "I feel regret. Not remorse.
Regret as I see the tragic impact on
people. I'm sorry. But if I had it to
do over again, I'd do it the same
way."
When asked whether he could
rule out the possibility of killing
again, Streleski hedged, saying he
foresees "no immediate, or long
term, necessity for it . . . but in
theory, if someone treated me like
Stanford did, I could conceive of kil
ling."

Concern on campus
Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington has said that if Streleski
appears on campus, he will be ar
rested for trespassing.
The trespass law applies to the
University because it is a private in
stitution located on private prop
erty, Herrington said. The law can
be activated only by a property
owner, though, meaning that police
could not arrest Streleski on
campus without receiving a request
to do so. Herrington said the re
quest to ban Streleski from campus
came from University President
Donald Kennedy.
Streleski said at a press confer
ence after his release on Sept. 8
that he does not plan to return to
Stanford. "If I change my mind," he
said, "I still won't go there without
prior public notice."
Herrington said he thinks
Streleski will keep his word and
stay away from Stanford. "When
(Streleski) says things, he usually
follows through on them," Her
rington said.
Yet campus police appear to be

taking a number of precautionary
measures. "A number of people (in
the police department) are involved
in different things," Herrington
said.
Hernngton refused to discuss
specific police activities concerning
Streleski, but said there is a "police
presence" around the math building
in the Quad, which is where
Streleski killed deLeeuw. "We are
watching the area ... to be aware
of who's around there," he said.
In addition, Herrington said he
met with a group of staff and faculty
members from the Math Depart
ment two days before Streleski's
release "to tell them what we
planned to do." Herrington told the
group — and he offers the advice
for everyone at Stanford — that
anyone who sees Streleski on
campus or is contacted by him
should notify the police immedi
ately.
The Math Department has
declined to comment on Streleski's
release, referring all media in
quiries to the Stanford police.
