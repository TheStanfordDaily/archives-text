# Freed Killer Draws Interest, Fear
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
"1 have no intention of killing
kgain," convicted killer Theodore
ptreleski told reporters as he
walked free from the Correc
:ional Medical Facility at Vacaville
m Sept. 8. "On the other hand," he
continued, "I cannot predict the
uture. I murdered before."
Streleski, 49, served seven
fears and 20 days in prison for
)ludgeoning Stanford Mathematics
J rof. Karel deLeeuw to death with
i hammer in 1978. He has never
•xpressed any remorse over the
laying, and he has never promised
e will not return to the Stanford
ampus to kill again.
A doct oral candidate in Stanford's
• Mathematics Department for 19
•ears, Streleski has said the faculty
)ere thwarted his attempts at ob
aining a degree. He said he killed
ieLeeuw to protest Stanford's
reatment of graduate students.
In a prison interview just before
us release, Streleski said his
rime, and the media attention it
cceived, succeeded in publicizing

the plight of graduate students who
have been treated unfairly at Stan
ford.
"I judged correctly that the
notoriety would bring press
coverage," he said. "People may
make a value judgment about me or
the validity of my judgment, but still
I think I'm getting some message
out there. So it worked to that ex
tent."
Streleski said expressing
remorse would undermine his
cause.
"If I committed a murder to
criticize Stanford, if I express
remorse, I just throw my whole ar
gument in the wastebasket," he
said. "I feel regret. Not remorse.
Regret as I see the tragic impact on
people. I'm sorry. But if I had it to
do over again, I'd do it the same
way."
When asked whether he could
rule out the possibility of killing
again, Streleski hedged, saying he
foresees "no immediate, or long
term, necessity for it . . . but in
theory, if someone treated me like
Stanford did, I could conceive of kil
ling."

Concern on campus
Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington has said that if Streleski
appears on campus, he will be ar
rested for trespassing.
The trespass law applies to the
University because it is a private in
stitution located on private prop
erty, Herrington said. The law can
be activated only by a property
owner, though, meaning that police
could not arrest Streleski on
campus without receiving a request
to do so. Herrington said the re
quest to ban Streleski from campus
came from University President
Donald Kennedy.
Streleski said at a press confer
ence after his release on Sept. 8
that he does not plan to return to
Stanford. "If I change my mind," he
said, "I still won't go there without
prior public notice."
Herrington said he thinks
Streleski will keep his word and
stay away from Stanford. "When
(Streleski) says things, he usually
follows through on them," Her
rington said.
Yet campus police appear to be

taking a number of precautionary
measures. "A number of people (in
the police department) are involved
in different things," Herrington
said.
Hernngton refused to discuss
specific police activities concerning
Streleski, but said there is a "police
presence" around the math building
in the Quad, which is where
Streleski killed deLeeuw. "We are
watching the area ... to be aware
of who's around there," he said.
In addition, Herrington said he
met with a group of staff and faculty
members from the Math Depart
ment two days before Streleski's
release "to tell them what we
planned to do." Herrington told the
group — and he offers the advice
for everyone at Stanford — that
anyone who sees Streleski on
campus or is contacted by him
should notify the police immedi
ately.
The Math Department has
declined to comment on Streleski's
release, referring all media in
quiries to the Stanford police.
When asked whether Streleski's
release from prison caused a great
deal of fear among the mathematics
faculty, Herrington said no, but
noted that "there is a level of con
cern because of the statements that
have been made."
State legislation
The California Senate and As
sembly recently adopted legislation
that would bar Streleski from ap
pearing on campus, once he is in
formed that he cannot trespass on
Stanford grounds. Gov. George
Deukmejian has until the end of the
month to sign the bill, and according
to a spokesman in his office, "every
indication is that he will" sign it.
The legislation, Senate Bill 677,
would prohibit any felon convicted
of a violent crime from trespassing
on property on which that crime
was committed.
"We think it will clarify our posi
tion vis-a-vis Mr. Streleski and can
be used in other cases by victims of
violent crime," said Herrington.
The bill, sponsored by Sen.
Robert Presley (D-Riverside), a
former under-sheriff of Riverside
County who has introduced several
bills on criminal justice in California,
was already in the works but was
reworded and introduced quickly to
cover Streleski immediately. Pres
ley's bill was the result, in part, of
conversations between Stanford of
ficials and the State Attorney Gen
eral's Office, according to Bob
Holmes, a staff consultant in Pres
ley's office.
The legislation would apply "in
any situation wit!* private property
open to the public," such as stores
and churches, Holmes said.
Backup victims
On Aug. 18, 1978, Streleski
walked into deLeeuw's office,
pulled a two-pound hammer out of a
flight bag and bludgeoned the pro
fessor to death. He then placed a
plastic bag over deLeeuw's head,
taped a notecard to his office door
reading, "No appointments today
— family emergency," and exited
quietly.
According to Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer, the officer
who worked on the case, Streleski
turned himself in to Stanford police
later that evening.
"I believe he said, 'I think you
may have been looking for me,' "
Niemeyer said.
Streleski testified at his 1979 trial
that he had lined up more than one
possible victim from the Math De
partment faculty. He said his

"backup candidate" would have
been Prof. David Gilbarg, who is
still a member of the Stanford fac
ulty.
At the trial, Streleski maintained
a "diminished-capacity" defense.
After a psychiatrist testified that
Streleski was a "paranoid psy
chotic" at the time of the killing, he
was found guilty by a jury of
second-degree murder.
His eight-year sentence was the
maximum then allowed by the law
for that conviction. Three months
later, the California legislature
adopted the Briggs initiative, a new
sentencing statute under which
Streleski could have received 15
years to life imprisonment.
Streleski came up for parole
three times in the last 18 months,
but opted each time to serve his full
sentence rather than leave prison
with the parole stipulation that he
not return to Stanford or its sur
rounding counties. His eight-year
sentence was shortened to seven
due good behavior, and on Sept.
8, he was unconditionally dis
charged.
Lt. Joe McGrath, a spokesman at
the Correctional Medical Facility at
Vacaville, said Streleski left prison
with about $300 and the few items
of clothing he had brought in seven
years ago. "He left no forwarding
address and no next of kin to be
notified,"McGrath said. "We've had
to mark his mail 'Return to
Sender.' "
Streleski, a certified electrical
engineer with a bachelor's degree
in engineering physics from the
University of Illinois, has said he
hopes to find work in the

electronics field in the San Fra
cisco area. He expects no help fro
family or friends. He is divore
and corresponds with no one, ]i
eluding his mother.
Although he has said in manyi
terviews that he has no intention
returning to Stanford, he .old
reporter from KGO-TV that 1
might come back to use one of tl
campus libraries.
Media attention
The television media
jumped at the chance to display til
6-foot-4, bearded and long-hairec
forthright killer. In the last ti
weeks, Streleski has expressed ti<
views on NBC-TV's "Today" aili
"Donahue" shows and KGO-TV?
"AM San Francisco."
When contacted, Sita deLeewj
widow of the math professor, sai
she was very upset at the media a!
tention Streleski was receiving, j
"I think it's an insult to my famij
to make a celebrity out of him," sfcj
said. "He is being treated like
hero. NBC paid for his hotel. He
being treated to lunch. The nei
thing we will probably see ha
doing on TV is endorsing orang
juice."
Herrington noted, "It's upsettin
that a criminal like him has acces
to the media as if he's someone iri
portant and has something impoi
tant to say." But Herrington adde
that the media exposure has been
plus because it has made the publi
aware of Streleski's appearance an
what he has to say, and"the gee
eral public should understand tN
way the system works."
