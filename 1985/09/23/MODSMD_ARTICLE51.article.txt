Cost of Gasoline Falls
LOS ANGELES — Retail gasoline prices
continued an 11-week slide by falling another
two-thirds of a cent per gallon in the last two
weeks, but may rise by 6 cents a gallon by
year's end, an oil industry analyst said yester
day.
The Iraq-Iran war, rising crude oil prices,
fall and winter demand for heating oil and the
cost of reducing the lead content of leaded gas
all could contribute to a 6-cent-per-gallon in
crease, said analyst Dan Lundberg, who sur
veys some 17,000 gas stations nationwide

every two weeks.
The latest survey found the average retail
price of all grades of gas, both self- and full
serve, has fallen for the 11th consecutive
week to $1,214 (per gallon), from $1,240 last
July 5," Lundberg said.
Blast Linked to Gas
SAN FRANCISCO — The blast that
wrecked the oil tanker Puerto Rican last Octo
ber off the Northern California coast probably
was caused by hydrogen gas, the Coast Guard
reported yesterday, and "was not caused by

sabotage or foul play." One man died in the
accident.
After an investigation of nearly 11 months, 3
Coast Guard announcement said experts were
unable to establish "with certainty' what
caused the early-morning explosion aboard the
632-foot vessel, a few hours after leaving San
Francisco Bay.
Falling Tree Fells Two
Two tourists were killed Saturday and
seven others seriously injured when a 25-foot
oak branch crashed down on an open-air tra®
at Yosemite National Park.
