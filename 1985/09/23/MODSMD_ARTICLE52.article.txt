Orientation '85

4. The Student Body
They're of every type and size,
They're clever, bright and wise.
From athletes to engineers,
They're bound to have a great four years.
We're so glad you new ones came,
Without the students, the Farm just
wouldn't be the same!

1. Hoo Tow
Stanford's very
own skyscraper
â€” Hoover Tower.
From it you can
get the best view
of the campus

short of an aerial
view. And no,
you are not
looking out onto
the world's larg
est Mexican res
taurant.

3. Ihe Axe
It's virtually a legend. The
symbol of victory over Cal.
They got it right in the neck,
where they deserved it. We
have it now, and they can
kiss it. It's locked up safe
and sound until after Big
| Game . . . when it will be
I locked up by Stanford again,
\ of course.

2. Don and
Jeanne Kennedy
Ma and Pa of the Farm. An
utterly polished pres. He is
smooth, smiley, friendly,
slick (notice the tux). . .and
also swift. Catch him (if you
can) running the Dish at 6:30
a.m., and he'll be glad to
have you join him.
