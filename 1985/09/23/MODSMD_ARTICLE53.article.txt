Not everyone gets a chance to meet the president. But you will if you attend the reception for all
new students at the home of President and Mrs. Kennedy from 3:30 to 5 p.m. on Sept. 24. The
Kennedy's live at 623 Mirada.

Waiting in lines on Registration Day in Maples Pavilion may be a letdown after fun-filled Frosh Or
