### BETH KLEID 
There may be a prize goat
breeder, a Venezualen bullfighter
or an Olympic -oarswoman among
the freshmen who comprise the
Class of '89. But there will
definitely be no one from Maine.
Maine; no. Argentina, Kuwait,
the People's Republic of China,
Switzerland and Zimbabwe; yes. In
addition to these foreign countries,
Washington D.C. and every other
state in the union (besides Maine)
will be represented by the fresh
man class.
Former Dean of Admissions
Fred Hargadon's freshman classes
were popularly known to be
"great." However, Dean of Admis
sions Jean Fetter's first crop of
frosh on the Farm may prove to be
even greater.
This year more applicants than
ever were denied admission to
Stanford, and that's because more
than ever applied. The credentials
of those who did not receive admis
sion were impressively high.
Who applied? 17,652 young men
and women from 4,767 secondary
schools — both record numbers,
according to a recent Office of Ad

missions' report. Of the total appli
cant group, 58 percent were men
and 42 percent were women. Ap
proximately 2,800 of the applicants
had 4.0 grade averages (an increase
of 18 percent over the applicants of
1984), and more than 2,000 appli
cants had combined SAT scores
above 1400 (an increase of 36 per
cent over 1984).

Who got in? 2,506 of the appli
cants (14 percent). Who will be on
the Farm today for Frosh Orienta
tion? 1,539 of those offered admis
sion (a 61 percent yield). The 967
prospective freshmen who got into
Stanford, but chose to attend an
other school, chose Ivy League col
leges in 50 percent of the cases.
Their most popular choice? Hint:
It's in the state of Massachusetts.
Of those who made the "right "
choice, 53 percent are men and 47
percent are women. The class in

cludes 19 percent students who
come from black, Chicano or native
American backgrounds — there is a
slight increase over last year's class
in the percentage of students from
each of these groups.
Californians make up 38 percent
of the Class of '89 — continuing the
trend of decreasing enrollment

ingtonians, Texans and

entire class represents 1,046 sec
ondary schools, the largest number
in Stanford's history.
As for transfers, 129 of 500 were
offered admission, and 105 will at
tend Stanford. 60 percent are men,
40 percent are women, and they
come to the Farm from 72 different
institutions across America. A

group of 17 transfers represents
foreign countries.
1985's freshmen are a diverse
and talented group. When describ
ing themselves with single ad
jectives in applications for admis
sion to the Farm, prospective
freshmen used quite creative epit
hets. Examples are: "Call me pi
quant, spicy, or pleasantly disturb
ing like Creole cooking and the
ideas in underground newspapers. I
stir up people and their ideas — not
inciting them to riot, mind you, but
at least I get them to think;" And
"Bunyanesque is a descriptive ad
jective for me. What I lack in size
and notoriety ... I make up in per
serverance, courage and intelli
gence."
If the freshman class is anything
as diverse as their adjectives, then
Fetter has met her goals for her
first class of freshmen. As she said
in a Campus Report interview last
spring, "We are committed to ad
mitting a class of Stanford students
that does not discriminate by religi
ous ar ethnic background. In short,
we seek a class that brings aca
demic excellence, personal
achievement and diversity in the
broadest sense."

and her staff's labors when she runs into members of her first
class of freshmen on the Farm this year.
