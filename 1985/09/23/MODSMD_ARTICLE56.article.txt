# Today's Activism Hearkens to an Earlier Era
## 
### 
Following an era of political turmoil in the late '60s and early 70s,
Stanford seemed to experience a period of relative student apathy.
But political activism at the University has undergone a resurgence
in the past year that in some respects recalls an earlier time in Stan
ford's history.
When Playboy magazine announced last spring it was doing a spe
cial October issue, "Girls of the Pac-10," Stanford students formed
the group STOP — Stanford Opposed to Pornography. Members
picketed the hotel where Playboy photographer David Chan was
conducting interviews for prospective models and have continued
protesting the issue through the summer, requesting that a letter be
placed on the covers of the magazines sold at The Store in Tresidder
Union.
Stanford Out of South Africa (SOSA) was formed last year by stu
dents, faculty and staff dedicated to ending the apartheid system in
South Africa. SOSA and other campus groups have organized rallies,
sit-ins and teach-ins with the goal of forcing Stanford administrators
to divest of Stanford's stockholdings in companies doing business in
South Africa.
Further demonstrations were sparked last spring by President
Reagan's proposed aid to the contra rebels in Nicaragua. White Plaza
served as a "burial ground" for several students lying near
"gravestones" they had fashioned to symbolize those killed in the
Nicaraguan conflict.
Use of nonviolent protest is not new to Stanford. From 1965 to
well into the 70s, students and faculty staged protest rallies against
the United States' involvement in Vietnam, the draft, government
research performed at Stanford and ROTC classes given here. But
unlike today, violence was also a means employed by the Stanford
demonstrators.
Protesters successfully ended the ROTC program on campus in
1970, but only after scrawling graffiti across campus, breaking win
dows, ransacking offices and completely destroying the building in
which classes were given. Much of the destruction was inflicted in
April 1970 when Stanford joined students across the nation in a
week-long anti-war boycott of classes. A 1970 University study esti
mated that "the cost of violence and disruption at Stanford"
amounted to almost $500,000.
By this time, many in the Stanford community called for an end to
the violence and destruction and urged a more constructive solution.
Such counter protests, coupled with the United States' withdrawal
from Vietnam, marked the end of an era of violent protest.
