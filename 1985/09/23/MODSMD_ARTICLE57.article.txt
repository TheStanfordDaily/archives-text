# Some of You May Have Lofty Ideals
## 
### 
Lofts are a fairly recent invention
that have become increasingly
popular in the past 10 years or so.
The dorm with the most lofts each
year is usually Toyon Hall, due to
its cathedralesque ceilings that tend
to give loftless residents the
"closing-in-walls" feeling.
"So how do I build my own loft?"
you ask.
The basic ingredients of a one
story, single bed loft are:
• a 4xB sheet of plywood at least
3/8-inch thick (fiber board is heavy
and cumbersome);
• 4x4 posts cut to the desired
height;
• 2x4 or 2x6 boards to support the
plywood, and Ix 4 or 2x4 boards to
use as cross-bracing to prevent
sway;

• joist hangers;
• nails (or wood screws) and lag
bolts;
• a carpet to finish off the platform.
The first thing to build is the
frame to support the platform.
There are two basic frames from
which to choose: (1) a frame of
2x4s with outside dimensions of 4xB
feet, or (2) a 2x6 or 2xB outer
frame with inside dimensions of 4xB
feet.
The advantage of the second one
is that the plywood may be set
inside the outer frame, leaving a
rim around the platform that not
only keeps the mattress from
sliding off but precludes the use of
nails to anchor the plywood to the
frame. This saves set-up and tear
down time.

For both frames, cut the corners
so the shorter 2x4s fit inside the
long ones. The nicest and easiest
way to secure the outside corners,
though slightly more expensive, is
to use lag bolts (which can be found
at any hardware store).

At each end of the long boards
drill two holes into the face. Make
the diameter of the holes smaller
than that of the bolt. Make sure the
lag bolts are long enough to extend
into the end of the shorter boards
and provide a strong joint.

The next step for both frames is
to install joists at 20-inch intervals
to support the platform. Be sure to
leave at least four inches clear at
each end for the loft legs.
Joists are usually 2x4s supported
by joist hangers anchored to the
long boards of the frame. The joists
must provide a level surface for the
plywood platform.
For a 2x4 outer frame (1), make
sure the joist hangers are nailed in
so that the inner 2x4 joists will fit
flush with the top of the frame.
First, measure and mark the posi
tion of the joist hangers with a small
2x4 block.
Now cut the 2x4 joists to fit
snugly within the outer frame, res
ting on the joist hangers. As long as
the corners are secure, the joists
need not be nailed.
On frames with top-flush joists
(1), plywood platforms must be
nailed or screwed down. For a loft
with a wide outer frame (2), the
plywood platform may be set on top
of the joists inside the frame.
Next, the legs must be installed

and braced. Use 4x4 posts. Set
them inside the frame at the cor
ners. with the top of the posts on
the same level as the joists. You
can lean the platform against the
wall for this step.
Drill holes for at least two lag
bolts per leg, or use at least four
16-penny nails.
Braces should run diagonally
from the top of one leg to the bot
tom of the opposite leg. From the
long side, use a 2x4 for the diagonal
brace; on the end, a Ix 4 is fine.
If you want built-in shelves, cut a
2x4 or 2x6 to fit between the legs
and nail or bolt it in. This will also
give added support.
For a ladder, cut several blocks
of equal length for stairs (the wider
the nicer). Cut two more 2x4s for
ladder uprights (avoid splintery
wood) and mark off steps at regular
intervals. The ladder can be nailed
together since it's small enough to
store.
Now your loft should be ready to
sand, stain, carpet and enjoy.
