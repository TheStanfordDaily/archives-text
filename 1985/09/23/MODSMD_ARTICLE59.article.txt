When David Starr Jordan arrived
at Stanford in the summer of 1891
to be the University's first presi
dent, he found the countryside
enthralling:
"The Santa Clara Valley," he
wrote in his autobiography,
"extends southward 50 miles and
more from near the head of San
Francisco Bay. Bounding it on the
southwest rises . . . the Sierra de
la Santa Cruz — 'a misty camp of
mountains pitched tumul
tuously.'. . .
"Immediately behind the Univer
sity estate and forming its higher
background is the wooded Sierra
Morena, its cloak of redwood, oak
and madrono diversified by thickets
of chemisal. . . .
"On the east, opposing the green
ridges of the Holy Cross, stretches
the long, relatively barren and tree
less Sierra del Monte Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30 miles
south of San Francisco, its favor
able climate assured by its situation
between bay and ocean, its
meadows patterned with ancient
oaks, Senator and Mrs. Leland
Stanford established their univer

sity on the site of their suburban
home, Palo Alto.
The first parcel, bought in 1876,
consisted of 650 acres along San
Francisquito Creek, and subse
quent purchases ran the total to
8,250 acres.
The whole of the Stanfords' land
was given to the University in the
1885 Grant of Endowment with the
stipulation that it should never be
sold.
To this land, Sen. Stanford
brought Francis Walker, president
of Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology, and the prominent
landscape architect, Frederick Law
Olmsted, in the summer of 1886.
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the foothills
of the ranch, so as to take advan
tage of the magnificent view of the
bay, but they finally decided to
drive in a stake in the grainfields
below, at a point that marks one
corner of the Inner Quadrangle.
The senator felt the flat site was
more practical for later expansion.

The old clock tower stood behind Memorial Church. You won't
find it there anymore. In the early '70s it became infested with
termites and was taken down before it fell down.

The new clock tower was dedicated in 1983. The money for it
was donated by an alumni couple in honor of their engagement,
which took place while they stood in front of the original tower.
Although the new tower's appearance is modern, the actual
clock was made with the original equipment from the clock in
the old location.
concept for the grounds and the
buildings, but it remained for the
young Boston architect, Charles
Allerton Coolidge, to develop this
concept in the style of his late men
tor, Henry Hobbs Richardson, con
sidered the most eminent architect
of his time.
The style is called Richardsonian
Romanesque, and it follows the
European Romanesque, which is
characterized by rectilinear stone
buildings joined by covered arcades
formed of successive half-circle
arches supported by short columns
with decorated capitals.
The Inner Quad of 12 classroom
buildings — with the central place
reserved for the future Memorial
Church — and three engineering
buildings, Encina Hall for men and
Roble Hall for women, were ready
for the University's opening on Oc
tober 1, 1891.
"These long corridors with their
stately pillars," Jordan said at the
dedication, "will have their part in
the students' training. Each stone
in the quadrangle shall teach its les
son of grace and genuineness."
President Andrew D. White of
Cornell pronounced the Stanford
buildings the most beautiful college
architecture in America.
But just before five on the morn
ing of April 18, 1906, the ground
beneath Stanford's new buildings
shook for 45 seconds. The great
earthquake killed two men on
campus and caused millions of dol
lars of damage.
The ponderous church tower,
with its clocks, chimes and spire,
crashed into the chancel of
Memorial Church, and the concus
sion blew out the front wall. The
rose window and the huge Venetian
mosaic of the Sermon on the Mount
that had graced the facade lay as
rubble in the Inner Quad.
Memorial Arch, the central
structure of the Outer Quad — 100
feet high and decorated with a
frieze depicting the march of
civilization — was damaged beyond

repair. So were a library and gym
nasium that were just short of com
pletion. None of these were
replaced.
Reconstruction cost more than
$2 million. Classes were dismissed
until the fall. Seniors in what has
come to be known as "The
Earthquake Class" were voted
their degrees in May.
It was a setback, but only a tem
porary one, for the young univer
sity quickly rebuilt, pursuing a
construction project that was begun
in 1886 and that has continued up to
the present.
The construction has taken place
on approximately 5,000 acres
reserved by the Board of Trustees
for educational uses. This is the
heartland of the Stanford land, com
prised for the most part of the
central portion running from El
Camino Real to the back boundary
in the foothills.
The areas designated for light lie
in the open land, including the arbo
retum, golf course and the foothill
lands used for space-probing an
tennae and research in nuclear
physics and biological sciences.
The inner and outer quads oc
cupy 17 acres at the heart of the
academic area. The Inner Quad's
12 classroom buildings, two of
which are now used by the presi
dent and his staff, date from the
time the University opened in 1891,
while the Outer Quad was com
pleted in 1903, the same year that
Memorial Church was dedicated.
Buildings in the Outer Quad are
being brought up to earthquake
proof standards by an "inside-out"
process of construction to preserve
the sandstone exterior.
The church represents the Stan
fords' deep religious faith, though
they were followers of no particular
denomination. In the Founding
Grant, they directed the trustees
"to have taught in the University
the immortality of the soul, the
existence of an all-wise and
benevolent Creator, and that
obedience to His laws is the highest
duty of man."
To serve the widest needs of the

campus community, they decreed
that the church and the University
were to be nonsectarian and at no
time tied to any particular
denomination.
In the original plans, the central
site now occupied by the church
was reserved for it, though con
struction was deferred. When

Sen. Stanford died in 1893, his
widow determined that the church
would be built as a memorial to him.
Mrs. Stanford chose the final
designs for windows and mosaics,
traveling to Italy to approve the
mosaic sketches, and obtaining
papal permission to copy the Roselli
fresco of the "Last Supper" in the

Sistine Chapel.
The Venetian mosaics that cover
the interior walls are largely Old
Testament, depicting the history of
redemption. The largest mosaic,
however, occupies most of the
facade of the church and, with 47
figures, depicts the Sermon on the
Mount.

After the earthquake of 1906, the
structure was completely dis
mantled and rebuilt around a steel
framework. Another set of mosaics
was brought from Venice, but the
80-foot spire, housing clocks and
chimes, was never rebuilt.

Now you see it, now you don't. The Earthquake of 1906 did serious damage to a then very new Stanford campus.
The campus landmark, 285-foot
Hoover Tower, was dedicated at
the University's 50th anniversary in
1941. The tower and the adjoining
Lou Henry Hoover Building
(opened in 1967) house the vast
documentary collections of the
Hoover Institution on War, Revolu
tion and Peace — millions of items
that include books, documents,
files, manuscripts, diaries,
pamphlets, posters, maps and
photos. The Herbert Hoover
Memorial Building, completed in
1978, honors the former presi
dent's humanitarian works.
Herbert Hoover started the li
brary collection during World War I
when he headed the Commission
for Relief in Belgium. Struck with
the thought that his relief work
placed him in a position to docu
ment the war, Hoover shipped
crates of material to the library at
Stanford, his alma mater, and laid
the literary foundation of the
Hoover Institution.
At the 1941 ceremony, Hoover
said: "The purpose of this institu
tion is to promote peace. Its

records stand as a challenge to
those who promote war. They
should attract those who search for
peace."
The institution has more material
on communism than can be found
anywhere outside the Soviet Union.
It has more data on Mussolini than
can be found in Italy. It also prob
ably has the most complete record
on Hitler and the Nazi movement
extant.
With these resources, the institu
tion serves as a center for advanced
study and research on problems of
social, political and economic
change in the 20th century.
Across from Hoover Tower sits
Memorial Hall (Auditorium), dedi
cated in 1937. Built primarily
through student contributions as a
memorial to Stanford students and
faculty slain in World War I, the
auditorium also contains in the
foyer plaques honoring the Stanford
dead of World War 11. The main
auditorium seats 1,700 and the
Little Theater seats 200.
Just south of the Quad is White
Memorial Plaza, a 200,000-square
foot landscaped area donated to the
Univerity by Mr. and Mrs.
Raymond Wliite in memory of their
sons. The focal point of the plaza is

a tall, free-form fountain executed
in bronze by San Francisco sculptor
Aristides Demetrios.
Bordered by the bookstore, post
office, Tresidder Memorial Union,

the music building and the Old
Union — which contains several
student services — the plaza is a
campus crossroads.
The Stanford School of Medicine

moved from San Francisco into its
quarters in 1959. The $21 million
structure consists of three sections
— the hospital, the outpatient
clinics and the teaching laboratories
and classrooms.
The Stanford Law School has
been housed in Crown Quadrangle
since September 1975, when Presi
dent Ford dedicated the $11.9 mil
lion facility. The school consists of
four buildings: the Robert Crown
Library, which can seat the entire
law student body at the same time;
Frederick I. Richman Hall, which
contains the classrooms and moot
court; the James Irvine Gallery,
which contains the faculty and stu
dent meeting rooms and lounges;
and 600-person Kresge
Auditorium.
Behind the central campus, the
University operates its science
"farms," the oldest of which is the
Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve.
Rising steeply from Searsville
Lake, the 735-acre preserve con
tains a unique association of rock
ledges and outcroppings, oak
dotted savannahs, chaparral, red
woods, streams and pools. The
preserve is used regularly for
teaching.
The Radioscience Laboratory

conducts at its antenna farm one of
the most productive and varied pro
grams of ionospheric and inter
planetary radio investigation. Its
scientists made the first radar con
tact with the sun.
The most spectacular of the an
tennae, the 70-ton, 150-foot
diameter steel and aluminum
"Dish," has explored the sun,
planets and interplanetary gases by
means of a radar beam.
The Stanford Linar Accelerator
Center (SLAC) operates a two
mile-long atom smasher on 460
acres along Sand Hill Road. The
$114 million machine, financed by
the Atomic Energy Commission
and completed in 1966, fires the
electron down a straight, slender
tube rather than whirling protons in
circles, as most atom smashers do.
The machine develops an energy of
20 billion electron volts.
In the last 20 years, the Univer
sity has raised some $325 million to
pay for new campus facilities and
improvements, including campus
landmarks such as Maples Pavilion,
Meyer Library, the Green Library
annex, the Terman Engineering
Center, the Mudd Chemistry Build
ing, the Center for Integrated Sys
tems and Braun Music Center.

The Venetian mosaics that cover
the interior walls are largely Old
Testament, depicting the history of
redemption. The largest mosaic,
however, occupies most of the
facade of the church and, with 47
figures, depicts the Sermon on the
Mount.

After the earthquake of 1906, the
structure was completely dis
mantled and rebuilt around a steel
framework. Another set of mosaics
was brought from Venice, but the
80-foot spire, housing clocks and
chimes, was never rebuilt.

Now you see it, now you don't. The Earthquake of 1906 did serious damage to a then very new Stanford campus.
The campus landmark, 285-foot
Hoover Tower, was dedicated at
the University's 50th anniversary in
1941. The tower and the adjoining
Lou Henry Hoover Building
(opened in 1967) house the vast
documentary collections of the
Hoover Institution on War, Revolu
tion and Peace — millions of items
that include books, documents,
files, manuscripts, diaries,
pamphlets, posters, maps and
photos. The Herbert Hoover
Memorial Building, completed in
1978, honors the former presi
dent's humanitarian works.
Herbert Hoover started the li
brary collection during World War I
when he headed the Commission
for Relief in Belgium. Struck with
the thought that his relief work
placed him in a position to docu
ment the war, Hoover shipped
crates of material to the library at
Stanford, his alma mater, and laid
the literary foundation of the
Hoover Institution.
At the 1941 ceremony, Hoover
said: "The purpose of this institu
tion is to promote peace. Its

records stand as a challenge to
those who promote war. They
should attract those who search for
peace."
The institution has more material
on communism than can be found
anywhere outside the Soviet Union.
It has more data on Mussolini than
can be found in Italy. It also prob
ably has the most complete record
on Hitler and the Nazi movement
extant.
With these resources, the institu
tion serves as a center for advanced
study and research on problems of
social, political and economic
change in the 20th century.
Across from Hoover Tower sits
Memorial Hall (Auditorium), dedi
cated in 1937. Built primarily
through student contributions as a
memorial to Stanford students and
faculty slain in World War I, the
auditorium also contains in the
foyer plaques honoring the Stanford
dead of World War 11. The main
auditorium seats 1,700 and the
Little Theater seats 200.
Just south of the Quad is White
Memorial Plaza, a 200,000-square
foot landscaped area donated to the
Univerity by Mr. and Mrs.
Raymond Wliite in memory of their
sons. The focal point of the plaza is

a tall, free-form fountain executed
in bronze by San Francisco sculptor
Aristides Demetrios.
Bordered by the bookstore, post
office, Tresidder Memorial Union,

the music building and the Old
Union — which contains several
student services — the plaza is a
campus crossroads.
The Stanford School of Medicine

moved from San Francisco into its
quarters in 1959. The $21 million
structure consists of three sections
— the hospital, the outpatient
clinics and the teaching laboratories
and classrooms.
The Stanford Law School has
been housed in Crown Quadrangle
since September 1975, when Presi
dent Ford dedicated the $11.9 mil
lion facility. The school consists of
four buildings: the Robert Crown
Library, which can seat the entire
law student body at the same time;
Frederick I. Richman Hall, which
contains the classrooms and moot
court; the James Irvine Gallery,
which contains the faculty and stu
dent meeting rooms and lounges;
and 600-person Kresge
Auditorium.
Behind the central campus, the
University operates its science
"farms," the oldest of which is the
Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve.
Rising steeply from Searsville
Lake, the 735-acre preserve con
tains a unique association of rock
ledges and outcroppings, oak
dotted savannahs, chaparral, red
woods, streams and pools. The
preserve is used regularly for
teaching.
The Radioscience Laboratory

conducts at its antenna farm one of
the most productive and varied pro
grams of ionospheric and inter
planetary radio investigation. Its
scientists made the first radar con
tact with the sun.
The most spectacular of the an
tennae, the 70-ton, 150-foot
diameter steel and aluminum
"Dish," has explored the sun,
planets and interplanetary gases by
means of a radar beam.
The Stanford Linar Accelerator
Center (SLAC) operates a two
mile-long atom smasher on 460
acres along Sand Hill Road. The
$114 million machine, financed by
the Atomic Energy Commission
and completed in 1966, fires the
electron down a straight, slender
tube rather than whirling protons in
circles, as most atom smashers do.
The machine develops an energy of
20 billion electron volts.
In the last 20 years, the Univer
sity has raised some $325 million to
pay for new campus facilities and
improvements, including campus
landmarks such as Maples Pavilion,
Meyer Library, the Green Library
annex, the Terman Engineering
Center, the Mudd Chemistry Build
ing, the Center for Integrated Sys

When David Starr Jordan arrived
at Stanford in the summer of 1891
to be the University's first presi
dent, he found the countryside
enthralling:
"The Santa Clara Valley," he
wrote in his autobiography,
"extends southward 50 miles and
more from near the head of San
Francisco Bay. Bounding it on the
southwest rises . . . the Sierra de
la Santa Cruz — 'a misty camp of
mountains pitched tumul
tuously.'. . .
"Immediately behind the Univer
sity estate and forming its higher
background is the wooded Sierra
Morena, its cloak of redwood, oak
and madrono diversified by thickets
of chemisal. . . .
"On the east, opposing the green
ridges of the Holy Cross, stretches
the long, relatively barren and tree
less Sierra del Monte Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30 miles
south of San Francisco, its favor
able climate assured by its situation
between bay and ocean, its
meadows patterned with ancient
oaks, Senator and Mrs. Leland
Stanford established their univer

sity on the site of their suburban
home, Palo Alto.
The first parcel, bought in 1876,
consisted of 650 acres along San
Francisquito Creek, and subse
quent purchases ran the total to
8,250 acres.
The whole of the Stanfords' land
was given to the University in the
1885 Grant of Endowment with the
stipulation that it should never be
sold.
To this land, Sen. Stanford
brought Francis Walker, president
of Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology, and the prominent
landscape architect, Frederick Law
Olmsted, in the summer of 1886.
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the foothills
of the ranch, so as to take advan
tage of the magnificent view of the
bay, but they finally decided to
drive in a stake in the grainfields
below, at a point that marks one
corner of the Inner Quadrangle.
The senator felt the flat site was
more practical for later expansion.
Olmsted worked out the general


The old clock tower stood behind Memorial Church. You won't
find it there anymore. In the early '70s it became infested with
termites and was taken down before it fell down.


Art Streiber/Daily
The new clock tower was dedicated in 1983. The money for it
was donated by an alumni couple in honor of their engagement,
which took place while they stood in front of the original tower.
Although the new tower's appearance is modern, the actual
clock was made with the original equipment from the clock in
the old location.
concept for the grounds and the
buildings, but it remained for the
young Boston architect, Charles
Allerton Coolidge, to develop this
concept in the style of his late men
tor, Henry Hobbs Richardson, con
sidered the most eminent architect
of his time.
The style is called Richardsonian
Romanesque, and it follows the
European Romanesque, which is
characterized by rectilinear stone
buildings joined by covered arcades
formed of successive half-circle
arches supported by short columns
with decorated capitals.
The Inner Quad of 12 classroom
buildings — with the central place
reserved for the future Memorial
Church — and three engineering
buildings, Encina Hall for men and
Roble Hall for women, were ready
for the University's opening on Oc
tober 1, 1891.
"These long corridors with their
stately pillars," Jordan said at the
dedication, "will have their part in
the students' training. Each stone
in the quadrangle shall teach its les
son of grace and genuineness."
President Andrew D. White of
Cornell pronounced the Stanford
buildings the most beautiful college
architecture in America.
But just before five on the morn
ing of April 18, 1906, the ground
beneath Stanford's new buildings
shook for 45 seconds. The great
earthquake killed two men on
campus and caused millions of dol
lars of damage.
The ponderous church tower,
with its clocks, chimes and spire,
crashed into the chancel of
Memorial Church, and the concus
sion blew out the front wall. The
rose window and the huge Venetian
mosaic of the Sermon on the Mount
that had graced the facade lay as
rubble in the Inner Quad.
Memorial Arch, the central
structure of the Outer Quad — 100
feet high and decorated with a
frieze depicting the march of
civilization — was damaged beyond

repair. So were a library and gym
nasium that were just short of com
pletion. None of these were
replaced.
Reconstruction cost more than
$2 million. Classes were dismissed
until the fall. Seniors in what has
come to be known as "The
Earthquake Class" were voted
their degrees in May.
It was a setback, but only a tem
porary one, for the young univer
sity quickly rebuilt, pursuing a
construction project that was begun
in 1886 and that has continued up to
the present.
The construction has taken place
on approximately 5,000 acres
reserved by the Board of Trustees
for educational uses. This is the
heartland of the Stanford land, com
prised for the most part of the
central portion running from El
Camino Real to the back boundary
in the foothills.
The areas designated for light lie
in the open land, including the arbo
retum, golf course and the foothill
lands used for space-probing an
tennae and research in nuclear
physics and biological sciences.
The inner and outer quads oc
cupy 17 acres at the heart of the
academic area. The Inner Quad's
12 classroom buildings, two of
which are now used by the presi
dent and his staff, date from the
time the University opened in 1891,
while the Outer Quad was com
pleted in 1903, the same year that
Memorial Church was dedicated.
Buildings in the Outer Quad are
being brought up to earthquake
proof standards by an "inside-out"
process of construction to preserve
the sandstone exterior.
The church represents the Stan
fords' deep religious faith, though
they were followers of no particular
denomination. In the Founding
Grant, they directed the trustees
"to have taught in the University
the immortality of the soul, the
existence of an all-wise and
benevolent Creator, and that
obedience to His laws is the highest
duty of man."
To serve the widest needs of the

campus community, they decreed
that the church and the University
were to be nonsectarian and at no
time tied to any particular
denomination.
In the original plans, the central
site now occupied by the church
was reserved for it, though con
struction was deferred. When

Sen. Stanford died in 1893, his
widow determined that the church
would be built as a memorial to him.
Mrs. Stanford chose the final
designs for windows and mosaics,
traveling to Italy to approve the
mosaic sketches, and obtaining
papal permission to copy the Roselli
fresco of the "Last Supper" in the

Sistine Chapel.
The Venetian mosaics that cover

between bay and ocean, its

Stanford established their univer

home, Palo Alto.
The first parcel, bought in 1876,
consisted of 650 acres along San
Francisquito Creek, and subse

8,250 acres.
The whole of the Stanfords' land
was given to the University in the
1885 Grant of Endowment with the
stipulation that it should never be
sold.
To this land, Sen. Stanford
brought Francis Walker, president
of Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology, and the prominent
landscape architect, Frederick Law
Olmsted, in the summer of 1886.
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the foothills
of the ranch, so as to take advan

bay, but they finally decided to
drive in a stake in the grainfields

The old clock tower stood behind Memorial Church. You won't
find it there anymore. In the early '70s it became infested with
termites and was taken down before it fell down.

The new clock tower was dedicated in 1983. The money for it
was donated by an alumni couple in honor of their engagement,
which took place while they stood in front of the original tower.
Although the new tower's appearance is modern, the actual
clock was made with the original equipment from the clock in
the old location.
concept for the grounds and the
buildings, but it remained for the
young Boston architect, Charles
Allerton Coolidge, to develop this
concept in the style of his late men
tor, Henry Hobbs Richardson, con
sidered the most eminent architect
of his time.
The style is called Richardsonian
Romanesque, and it follows the
European Romanesque, which is
characterized by rectilinear stone
buildings joined by covered arcades
formed of successive half-circle
arches supported by short columns
with decorated capitals.
The Inner Quad of 12 classroom
buildings — with the central place
reserved for the future Memorial
Church — and three engineering
buildings, Encina Hall for men and
Roble Hall for women, were ready
for the University's opening on Oc
tober 1, 1891.
"These long corridors with their
stately pillars," Jordan said at the
dedication, "will have their part in
the students' training. Each stone
in the quadrangle shall teach its les
son of grace and genuineness."
President Andrew D. White of
Cornell pronounced the Stanford
buildings the most beautiful college
architecture in America.
But just before five on the morn
ing of April 18, 1906, the ground
beneath Stanford's new buildings
shook for 45 seconds. The great
earthquake killed two men on
campus and caused millions of dol
lars of damage.
The ponderous church tower,
with its clocks, chimes and spire,
crashed into the chancel of
Memorial Church, and the concus
sion blew out the front wall. The
rose window and the huge Venetian
mosaic of the Sermon on the Mount
that had graced the facade lay as
rubble in the Inner Quad.
Memorial Arch, the central
structure of the Outer Quad — 100
feet high and decorated with a
frieze depicting the march of
civilization — was damaged beyond

repair. So were a library and gym
nasium that were just short of com
pletion. None of these were
replaced.
Reconstruction cost more than
$2 million. Classes were dismissed
until the fall. Seniors in what has
come to be known as "The
Earthquake Class" were voted
their degrees in May.
It was a setback, but only a tem
porary one, for the young univer
sity quickly rebuilt, pursuing a
construction project that was begun
in 1886 and that has continued up to
the present.
The construction has taken place
on approximately 5,000 acres
reserved by the Board of Trustees
for educational uses. This is the
heartland of the Stanford land, com
prised for the most part of the
central portion running from El
Camino Real to the back boundary
in the foothills.
The areas designated for light lie
in the open land, including the arbo
retum, golf course and the foothill
lands used for space-probing an
tennae and research in nuclear
physics and biological sciences.
The inner and outer quads oc
cupy 17 acres at the heart of the
academic area. The Inner Quad's
12 classroom buildings, two of
which are now used by the presi
dent and his staff, date from the
time the University opened in 1891,
while the Outer Quad was com
pleted in 1903, the same year that
Memorial Church was dedicated.
Buildings in the Outer Quad are
being brought up to earthquake
proof standards by an "inside-out"
process of construction to preserve
the sandstone exterior.
The church represents the Stan
fords' deep religious faith, though
they were followers of no particular
denomination. In the Founding
Grant, they directed the trustees
"to have taught in the University
the immortality of the soul, the
existence of an all-wise and
benevolent Creator, and that
obedience to His laws is the highest
duty of man."
To serve the widest needs of the

campus community, they decreed
that the church and the University
were to be nonsectarian and at no
time tied to any particular
denomination.
In the original plans, the central
site now occupied by the church
was reserved for it, though con
struction was deferred. When

Sen. Stanford died in 1893, his
widow determined that the church
would be built as a memorial to him.
Mrs. Stanford chose the final
designs for windows and mosaics,
traveling to Italy to approve the
mosaic sketches, and obtaining
papal permission to copy the Roselli
fresco of the "Last Supper" in the

Sistine Chapel.
The Venetian mosaics that cover
the interior walls are largely Old
Testament, depicting the history of
redemption. The largest mosaic,
however, occupies most of the
facade of the church and, with 47
figures, depicts the Sermon on the
Mount.

After the earthquake of 1906, the
structure was completely dis
mantled and rebuilt around a steel
framework. Another set of mosaics
was brought from Venice, but the
80-foot spire, housing clocks and
chimes, was never rebuilt.

Now you see it, now you don't. The Earthquake of 1906 did serious damage to a then very new Stanford campus.
The campus landmark, 285-foot
Hoover Tower, was dedicated at
the University's 50th anniversary in
1941. The tower and the adjoining
Lou Henry Hoover Building
(opened in 1967) house the vast
documentary collections of the
Hoover Institution on War, Revolu
tion and Peace — millions of items
that include books, documents,
files, manuscripts, diaries,
pamphlets, posters, maps and
photos. The Herbert Hoover
Memorial Building, completed in
1978, honors the former presi
dent's humanitarian works.
Herbert Hoover started the li
brary collection during World War I
when he headed the Commission
for Relief in Belgium. Struck with
the thought that his relief work
placed him in a position to docu
ment the war, Hoover shipped
crates of material to the library at
Stanford, his alma mater, and laid
the literary foundation of the
Hoover Institution.
At the 1941 ceremony, Hoover
said: "The purpose of this institu
tion is to promote peace. Its

records stand as a challenge to
those who promote war. They
should attract those who search for
peace."
The institution has more material
on communism than can be found
anywhere outside the Soviet Union.
It has more data on Mussolini than
can be found in Italy. It also prob
ably has the most complete record
on Hitler and the Nazi movement
extant.
With these resources, the institu
tion serves as a center for advanced
study and research on problems of
social, political and economic
change in the 20th century.
Across from Hoover Tower sits
Memorial Hall (Auditorium), dedi
cated in 1937. Built primarily
through student contributions as a
memorial to Stanford students and
faculty slain in World War I, the
auditorium also contains in the
foyer plaques honoring the Stanford
dead of World War 11. The main
auditorium seats 1,700 and the
Little Theater seats 200.
Just south of the Quad is White
Memorial Plaza, a 200,000-square
foot landscaped area donated to the
Univerity by Mr. and Mrs.
Raymond Wliite in memory of their
sons. The focal point of the plaza is

a tall, free-form fountain executed
in bronze by San Francisco sculptor
Aristides Demetrios.
Bordered by the bookstore, post
office, Tresidder Memorial Union,

the music building and the Old
Union — which contains several
student services — the plaza is a
campus crossroads.
The Stanford School of Medicine

moved from San Francisco into its
quarters in 1959. The $21 million
structure consists of three sections
— the hospital, the outpatient
clinics and the teaching laboratories
and classrooms.
The Stanford Law School has
been housed in Crown Quadrangle
since September 1975, when Presi
dent Ford dedicated the $11.9 mil
lion facility. The school consists of
four buildings: the Robert Crown
Library, which can seat the entire
law student body at the same time;
Frederick I. Richman Hall, which
contains the classrooms and moot
court; the James Irvine Gallery,
which contains the faculty and stu
dent meeting rooms and lounges;
and 600-person Kresge
Auditorium.
Behind the central campus, the
University operates its science
"farms," the oldest of which is the
Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve.
Rising steeply from Searsville
Lake, the 735-acre preserve con
tains a unique association of rock
ledges and outcroppings, oak
dotted savannahs, chaparral, red
woods, streams and pools. The
preserve is used regularly for
teaching.
The Radioscience Laboratory

conducts at its antenna farm one of
the most productive and varied pro
grams of ionospheric and inter
planetary radio investigation. Its
scientists made the first radar con
tact with the sun.
The most spectacular of the an
tennae, the 70-ton, 150-foot
diameter steel and aluminum
"Dish," has explored the sun,
planets and interplanetary gases by
means of a radar beam.
The Stanford Linar Accelerator
Center (SLAC) operates a two
mile-long atom smasher on 460
acres along Sand Hill Road. The
$114 million machine, financed by
the Atomic Energy Commission
and completed in 1966, fires the
electron down a straight, slender
tube rather than whirling protons in
circles, as most atom smashers do.
The machine develops an energy of
20 billion electron volts.
In the last 20 years, the Univer
sity has raised some $325 million to
pay for new campus facilities and
improvements, including campus
landmarks such as Maples Pavilion,
Meyer Library, the Green Library
annex, the Terman Engineering
Center, the Mudd Chemistry Build
ing, the Center for Integrated Sys
tems and Braun Music Center.

When David Starr Jordan arrived
at Stanford in the summer of 1891
to be the University's first presi
dent, he found the countryside
enthralling:
"The Santa Clara Valley," he
wrote in his autobiography,
"extends southward 50 miles and
more from near the head of San
Francisco Bay. Bounding it on the
southwest rises . . . the Sierra de
la Santa Cruz — 'a misty camp of
mountains pitched tumul

background is the wooded Sierra
Morena, its cloak of redwood, oak
and madrono diversified by thickets
of chemisal. . . .
