When David Starr Jordan arrived
at Stanford in the summer of 1891
to be the University's first presi
dent, he found the countryside
enthralling:
"The Santa Clara Valley," he
wrote in his autobiography,
"extends southward 50 miles and
more from near the head of San
Francisco Bay. Bounding it on the
southwest rises . . . the Sierra de
la Santa Cruz â€” 'a misty camp of
mountains pitched tumul
tuously.'. . .
"Immediately behind the Univer
sity estate and forming its higher
background is the wooded Sierra
Morena, its cloak of redwood, oak
and madrono diversified by thickets
of chemisal. . . .
"On the east, opposing the green
ridges of the Holy Cross, stretches
the long, relatively barren and tree
less Sierra del Monte Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30 miles
south of San Francisco, its favor

between bay and ocean, its
meadows patterned with ancient
oaks, Senator and Mrs. Leland
Stanford established their univer

sity on the site of their suburban
home, Palo Alto.
The first parcel, bought in 1876,
consisted of 650 acres along San
Francisquito Creek, and subse
quent purchases ran the total to
8,250 acres.
The whole of the Stanfords' land
was given to the University in the
1885 Grant of Endowment with the
stipulation that it should never be
sold.
To this land, Sen. Stanford
brought Francis Walker, president
of Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology, and the prominent
landscape architect, Frederick Law
Olmsted, in the summer of 1886.
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the foothills
of the ranch, so as to take advan
tage of the magnificent view of the
bay, but they finally decided to
drive in a stake in the grainfields
below, at a point that marks one
corner of the Inner Quadrangle.
The senator felt the flat site was
more practical for later expansion.

The old clock tower stood behind Memorial Church. You won't
find it there anymore. In the early '70s it became infested with
termites and was taken down before it fell down.

The new clock tower was dedicated in 1983. The money for it
was donated by an alumni couple in honor of their engagement,
which took place while they stood in front of the original tower.
Although the new tower's appearance is modern, the actual
clock was made with the original equipment from the clock in
the old location.
