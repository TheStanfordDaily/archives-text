# Sure-fire Tips To Safe Living On the Campus
## 
### 
Thefts, assaults and burglaries can become an
unfortunate part of your Stanford experience â€”
especially if you're not careful.
But a recent publication from the Special
Services Unit of the University's Department of
Public Safety aims to change all that.
The Stanford Farm Almanac is a compilation
of previous publications concerning safety and
security. Compiled and revised each year by the
students who make up the Special Services
Unit, the Almanac contains information on
dialing 911 for emergencies, using safety
services like escorts from Stanford United for
Rape Elimination, engraving your valuables in
order to deter theft, dealing with peeping toms
and intruders in the bathroom, and securing
your room before leaving for vacations. The
booklet also contains the Suggested Travel
Routes map.
The Almanac is available at Old Union, Meyer
and Green libraries and the Tresidder Informa
tion Desk. For more information on safety and
security at Stanford, call the Special Services
Unit at 497-9633.
