# An omniscient overseer
## Orientation Guru 
### ALLISON HARTWELL 
For six fun-filled days, students new to Stanford
have the opportunity to participate in the wonderful
phenomenon of orientation. But who is responsible for
organizing the facts, fairs, food and fun for frosh?
This year's freshman orientation coordinator is Allan
Leung. He was chosen as the coordinator last winter.
Finding the notification letter of his position was
"certainly good news to start (winter quarter) finals
with,'" he says.
His experience as an orientation volunteer last year
made him consider applying for the position this year.
As orientation coordinator, Leung supervises all
freshman orientation activities along with Keith Ar
chuleta, orientation adviser and assistant director of
the Row. Together they have planned every facet of
orientation, from the moment the freshman step off the
plane to registration. Leung also has 82 freshman ori
entation volunteers under his tutelage.
Leung says preparations for orientation started early
spring quarter and continued through the summer.
Last minute details, such as "making sure the
sprinklers are kept off," have been keeping Leung
busy the last few days before orientation. In addition to
planning orientation, Leung is a summer RA.
"I'm really excited to see everything set in motion,"
Leung said. Planning something on such a large scale
and as fun as orientation has been great learning exper

ience, he says.
According to Leung, the highlight of freshman orien
tation should be Noche Tropical, or tropical night, a
dance in the Inner Quad held Saturday night. Appropri
ate dress and mood is required. Lessons in the Samba,
Hula and Reggae will be given and movies will be
shown.

According to Leung, the high
light of freshman orientation
should be Noche Tropical,
or tropical night, a dance in
the Inner Quad held Saturday
night.

Leung's responsibilities don't end September 24
with registration, he still has evaluations and filing to
do. When asked if he would be coordinator again, he
answers "no," because he wants to be an RA next year
and it is difficult to do both. Leung is a junior this year
majoring in electrical engineering.
