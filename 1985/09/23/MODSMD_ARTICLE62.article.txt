5. Campus Art
You may think you're walking around a large-scale
outdoor art museum. No, it's just the Stanford
campus, but the art work is first class. Miro did the
bird in front of Annenberg, Calder did the creature
in front of the Law School and Rodin is all over the
place. Rodin's Balzac 'dropped' in for a temporary
visit last spring. Trivia fact: if Balzac gained the
freshman 10 he would weigh 3,010 lbs.

7. 'Gaieties'
The best kept secret on
the Farm. Be prepared to
be surprised by both
what the ending is and
who is in it. We won't
spoil it here because
even we don't know.
This show is the
definitive spoof on the
weenies. A perfect pre-
Rally, pre-Big Game
psyche-up.

9. Outdoor Concerts at Frost
A chance to sport your shades and
soak up the sun while you rock-out
and mingle with mellow students and
even mellower groupies of such bands
as The Grateful Dead.

6. The Flicks
An institution. The thing to do on a
Sunday night — even if you have tons
of work to do. Correction: especially if
you have tons of work to do — like
during Dead Week. And don't forget to
bring your scrap paper.

8. The Classical Arts
Sure, it's a farm, but it's no cultural
wasteland. You can get culture-fixes
right on the grounds. Famous dance
companies, vocal and instrumental
groups regularly come through. And
don't miss performances by Stanford's
own Symphony Orchestra and Choir.
