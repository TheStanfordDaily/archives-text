# Local nightclub news
## Come to the Cabaret, Old Chum... 
### 
San Francisco's nightclubs, even more than Herb
Caen and the Zodiac Killer, distinguish this city from
every inhabited community outside of New York State
lines. The City has more nightclubs than LA — a city
with eight times as many inhabitants.
Of course it is difficult to find one's way around when
one doesn't always know where to go. Here, then, is a
guide to local hot spots worth frequenting.
The Keystone Palo Alto is the club most folks
know about. It's not the cheapest club, or the biggest,

or the friendliest, or the one with
the best sound (Lord no!). But it is
nearby, and that means a lot to a
mostly bicycle-bound audience jus
tifiably uneasy about traversing the
wilds of San Mateo on a stray
SamTrans 7F or facing the Tender
loin district without an easy escape
route.
But location doth not a nightclub
make, and the Keystone is not a
nightclub, so don't let anyone tell
you differently. A nightclub has en
tertainment but also gives you an
atmosphere and a chance to con
verse. The Keystone Palo Alto
does not exactly fail in these goals;
rather, it blatantly refuses to at
tempt reaching them.
Consequently, the selection of
bands is like that of a small concert
arena — country bumpkins one
night, multigenarian blues/jazz ar
tists the next, rapid and rabid
lobotomy rock the next (of both the
heavy metal and punk varieties).
For the latter, be especially
forewarned: Palo Alto punk rockers
are a singularly ridiculous bunch.
Despite the kids with skinny ties
borrowed from their fathers and the
lineups of family Buicks outside the
Keystone dropping off Skip and
Cindy for Punk Nite Out, the danc
ing inside can often resemble a
cross between leapfrog and Roller
ball. If you are wary of the hazards,
though, the Keystone is always a
good guess in the spontaneous
"let's go to a show" rallies common
in dorms around the end of a quar
ter.
If, on the other hand, you enjoy
the hazards and want to go out of
your way to create them, then the
Mabuhay Gardens is waiting for

you with open safety pins. Five or
six years after the fact, punk music
seems to have settled its feud with
(and acknowledged its debt to)
heavy metal. Perhaps in deference
to this newly discovered patrimony
(or perhaps to the sacred cash cow
of the concert-going public), punk
clubs often have "metal nights" and
everyday audiences these days

definitely have more of an axle
grease aura around them, which is
actually perfect for the Mabuhay
Gardens. While the Keystone acts
like a small arena, the Fab Mab is
more like a slightly oversized ga
rage, with brick walls and a self
consciously dangerous air about it.
The bands have the best names
in the Bay Area, though certainly

not top tonal quality. Still thriving as
a Polynesian restaurant by
day/leatherette cave by night, the
club is best for those who under
stand the colossal joke taking place
six or seven nights a week. That's
entertainment.
Roosting at the mouth of Broad
way, the Fab Mab also serves as an
introduction to the North Beach

area of the City, where most of the
real nightclubs (i.e., the ones that
advertise) reside. Right across the
street from the Mab is The Stone,
owned by the same folks who dis
pense entertainment at the
Keystone Palo Alto. The Stone is
sort of a hybrid; it has the physical
qualities of its immediate neighbor
but the music selection of the
Keystone, a decidedly pop flavor.
If you go down Broadway a few
blocks (negotiating your way past
the massage parlors and Carol
Doda) and turn onto Columbus,
you'll eventually pass Wolfgang's,

the physical successor to the
Boarding House (901 Columbus)
and the spiritual heir to the Old Wal
dorf as Bill Graham's Home for
Acts That Can't Sell Out the
Coliseum. Amazingly enough, few
of the many sins of the father are
visited upon the latest offspring;
the sound is decent, the stage and
lighting very good, and there's even

a balcony for those who really don't
go to clubs to see the band. The
only.caveats to the clubber are
well-known to Waldorf denizens:
Beware the chairs (bicycle seats
with legs), the drink minimum (the
"Calistoga with Orange Flavor"
tastes like it should have the word
"Agent" in its title somewhere) and
the food (Chicken Lollipops?
McPutrid).
Better chairs and bigger shows
can be found at the other Graham
venue, the Kabuki Nightclub at
the Japan Center near Geary
Street. Located significantly west
of North Beach, the Kabuki none
theless has even more traditional
nightclub aesthetics; it's big and
flashy, like the nightclubs in 1930s
musicals, with lots of tables for the
Nicholas Brothers to dance across.
It's a little bit odd to see Greg Kihn
play in a place that should have
Billie Holliday, but it's still a roomy,
nice club. The videos in the lobby
help as well, as does the Japantown
Bowling Alley across the street
(open until 4 a.m. on Wednesdays
and Thursdays and 24 hours a day
weekends).
If you accept the above three ele
ments — music, rock video and
bowling — as a sort of a holy trinity
of night-on-the-town experiences,
then the Park Bowl on Haight
Street was designed with you in
mind. Located a couple of blocks
away from the I-Beam, one of the
more elaborate dance clubs on the
scene (forget the bands — the
stage is a show in itself), the Park
Bowl is your basic, well-mannered
direct-from-Muncie, Ind., bowling
alley during the week.
But on Friday and Saturday
nights, the lights go down, the
volume goes up and a 12-foot video
screen descends and hovers over
the center lanes. It, and satellite
TV sets around the alley, show
rock videos and the like while the
paying customers ($6 cover charge
for admission and about two hours



of tenpinning) take their turns at
the line and dance back to their
seats. There's a bar, too, for the
athletically inclined. As a concept,
the Park Bowl is fascinating; it in
spires the kind of never-there-but
nostalgic-anyway sigh that you only
hear outside old drive-in hamburger
stands and Broadway revivals.
Moreover, the darn thing works;
it's a lot of fun, and you very rarely
get a chance to think what a stupid
game bowling is. If nightdubbing is
the art of distraction, the Park Bowl
on Friday and Saturday nights
should be bronzed.
Don't think of this nightdubbing
guide as more than a series of
press-box tracer shells, however;
you're going to have to make the
rounds yourself. In your search,
you'll probably find clubs off the
beaten path, and certainly ones not
mentioned here. The North Beach
area has most of the big clubs, for
example, but there's a better vari
ety of acts south of Market Street
around the China Basin (where the
Giants want to insert a new domed
baseball stadium, provided South
ern Padfic can be persuaded not to
build an entire corporate Atlantis on
the same land). The only problem
with this area is that most of the
"dubs" are converted warehouses,
with few comforts and even fewer
ways of finding out about perfor
mances. If you can learn your way
around there, you'll be in an "in
crowd" that's so in, no one knows
it's there.
In any case, there are some
relatively hard-and-fast (as opposed
to soft-and-slow) rules about finding
a particular roost for your night-owl
habits.
Rule No. 1 of nightclub choosery
specifically prohibits parties of the
first part from following only high
fame quotient stars. High-fame
quotient stars usually end up in
stadiums, with high-boredom
quotient warm-up acts — you must
remember that nightclubs depend
on medium-small entertainers.
"Medium-small" generally has to
do only with album sales, however,
as does the "high-fame quotient" —
the point is that you ought not wait
all year for your favorite group.
They'll sell out anyway, if they play
in a nightclub, so what true club

bers ought to do is experiment with
their ears.
And you should know in advance
that Rule No. 2 is not for a great
many people. It requires that you
admit the existence of a flaw. Yet it
is important, and we should shed
our misconceptions eventually. So
remember this — despite the
popularity of component stereo
systems with multi-colored dials
and switches, most of humanity is
unable to tell a good sound system
from a Dixie cup on a string. It fol
lows from this fact that although
sound systems vary in nightclubs,
to most people it doesn't really mat
ter.
Consider an example. The
Great American Music Hall on
O'Farrell Street has definite acous
tic drawbacks, despite its habit of
featuring high-quality acoustic
musicians. But did you ever hear

anyone complain about it? The
beautiful gold-leaf interior at the
Hall can sometimes send a trumpet
solo into an ear at a disconcerting
moment. But it simply doesn't need
perfect acoustics, because there
are very few perfect ears.
Those so blessed can find what
they need at nearly every jazz club.
(One of the best, the Keystone
Korner, on Vallejo in North Beach,
closed a while back due to some
disagreements with the IRS. Its
successor seems to be Kimball's,
on Grove Street, which generally
books Bay Area jazz types like Jes
sica Williams and Joe Henderson,
along with national figures.) Jazz
places are frequented by people
who demand near-perfect acoustics
— they have it because they need
it, but other places don't.
So that's Rule 2, to be noted es
pecially by rock fans.
