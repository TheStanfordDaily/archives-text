Stanford is something of a movie
buffs paradise. At the best of
times, there are seven or eight film
series operating simultaneously on
campus, as well as a colorful selec
tion of revivals at the downtown
revival house, the New Varsity
(there used to be four revival
houses within five blocks of each
other downtown, but three went

out of business within the past
year), and first-run foreign and
domestic pictures on 15 screens in
eight local theaters. Newly arrived
movie addicts will find their needs
tended to in the following locations:
On Campus
ASSU Sunday Flicks: This is the
most popular film series on campus
— not because it is assembled with
especially good taste, but because
it includes very recent releases and
provides a party-like atmosphere
akin to that of midnight screenings
of "The Rocky Horror Picture
Show." Most people have a great
time, though those who prefer to
see the screen behind the barrage

of paper planes and hear the
soundtrack over the gleefully im
provised commentary may seek
elsewhere. Because the Sunday
Flicks draw such a large crowd,
they screen twice in Memorial
Auditorium (Sunday evenings, of
course).

Stanford Film Society: Though
this series is run by a small, dedi
cated group of undergraduates, it is
drawn up in connection with the
Film Aesthetics and Film History
courses offered in the Communica
tion Department in the fall and win
ter, respectively. (Occasionally

there will be a spring series as well,
but that is rare.) Attendance is
compulsory for students enrolled in
these courses, but the movies — a
highly varied mixture of American
and foreign films, silents and talkies
— are open to everyone. These
pictures are almost always terrific.

German Film Series: This irreg
ular series is sponsored by Haus
Mitteleuropa, where it is shown.
The movies cover a wide spectrum
of German film. Classics like "M"
and "Metropolis" often pop up, as
well as examples of contemporary
German cinema and relatively

obscure entries. It's impossible to
predict if and when the German
Film Series will happen; keep an
eye out for flyers around campus.
Law School Film Society: Like
the publicity surrounding this se
ries, the choice of movies varies
greatly according to who is in
charge of it from term to term. It's

generally an agreeable, nostalgic
collection of Hollywood classics like
"Little Women," "The Big Sleep"
and "Bringing Up Baby," and it
draws affectionate, fairly quiet
audiences. Friday nights in Kresge
Auditorium.
Great Directors Film Series:
The most esoteric movies in town
— this is a series for diehard movie
goers. The selection depends on
the tastes of the two or three
people who operate it, but the em
phasis is generally placed on foreign
films, particularly by highly experi
mental directors whose work would
be unlikely to turn up even in most
revival theaters.

Chaparral Film Series: The
Chaparral supports itself largely
through these movies, so the list al
ways includes a number of sure-fire
successes (Woody Allen, Monty
Python and soft-core porn movies,
for example). By the same token,
the existence of the series is tied to
the Chaparral's economic health
during any given quarter. Because
of the balance between recent and
older releases, the selection of
films is usually fairly decent, and it
includes a few really pleasant
surprises. Saturday evenings.
Off Campus
New Varsity: Located on Univer
sity Avenue between Waverley and
Cowper Streets, the New Varsity
is a nearly ideal repertory cinema.
Double bills (and occasionally triple
bills) change every two or three
days, and they offer not only recent
films (often hot off the first-run
screens) but also American and
foreign classics, some not often
revived. If a relatively unpublicized
movie opens in San Francisco and
fails to show up first-run in Palo
Alto, chances are it will surface at
the New Varsity within six or eight
months. The seats are slightly rick
ety and uncomfortable, but the Var
sity's patrons don't seem to mind
very much. The building also
houses an indoor-outdoor cafe
restaurant where locals often gat
her in the evenings for coffee,
dessert and live music in the court
yard. Recently, a shift in emphasis
toward live music on the main stage
has cut down on the number of
movies shown. On weekends, the

Varsity is one of the primary hang
outs for Palo Alto's disillusioned
youth; you may have to fight your
way through crowds of mods and
punkers to get inside.
Aquarius: The Aquarius, on
Emerson between University and
Lytton, has two small cinemas that
show mostly foreign films, with the
occasional "small" American
feature. Recent showings have in
cluded "Mac Arthur's Children,"
Satyajit Ray's "The Home and the
World" and"The Emerald Forest."
Since it is one of Palo Alto's major
claims to culture, it is nearly always
crowded on Friday and Saturday
nights; the Palo Alto moviegoing
crowd tends to adopt certain
movies that open at the Aquarius —
"El Norte" or "Carmen," for in
stance — and keeps them playing
there for months. It's your basic
(essential) university theater.
Stanford: The final point of the
downtown triangle of theaters is
the Stanford, an authentic old
movie palace (University Avenue
between Emerson and Ramona
Streets) that has opened and closed
four or five times in the last two
years under various managements.
It seems fairly secure now as part
of the Renaissance Rialto chain,
showing big-budget, first-run Holly
wood movies.
Fine Arts: On California Avenue,
just east of El Camino — in the
midst of the nicest commercial area
in Palo Alto — the Fine Arts is a
fairly nice theater, known in the
past for grabbing hold of movies it
could show for months and months
— "La Cage aux Folles" played for

more than a year. Lately the turn
over has been more rapid.
Palo Alto Square: These twin
theaters take up the bottom floor of
a very bland-looking office building
at the corner of El Camino and Page
Mill Road. They draw mostly high
school kids, because they tend to
show popular films like "Footloose"
and "Indiana Jones and the Temple
of Doom." But they are undeniably
comfortable and convenient (if you
have a car).
Guild, Park: These are Menlo
Park's two movie theaters. (There
used to be a third, the Menlo, but it
closed years ago and its space was
absorbed by an expanding Chinese
restaurant.) They are located a few
blocks from each other on El
Camino. Each offers first-run
movies of all kinds. They are pleas
ant theaters, and pretty reliable
with regard to programming —
generally speaking, at least one of
them is offering a film worth seeing
at any given time.
Old Mill 6: The bane of a
moviegoer's existence — you can't
avoid seeing films here: Since there
are six screens, two or three new
pictures arrive each week.
Besides, the bargain-price twilight
shows are very seductive. But the
screens are tiny, the theater is al
ways crowded, and you move from
line to line until you feel you're
being processed. Furthermore, it's
an offensively ugly environment in
which to see movies — the theater
looks vaguely like a video arcade.
But if you must, you must. Located
in the Old Mill Shopping Mall off San
Antonio Road, near the San Antonio
Shopping Center.
