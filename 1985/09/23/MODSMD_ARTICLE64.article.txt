Stanford is something of a movie
buffs paradise. At the best of
times, there are seven or eight film
series operating simultaneously on
campus, as well as a colorful selec
tion of revivals at the downtown
revival house, the New Varsity
(there used to be four revival
houses within five blocks of each
other downtown, but three went

out of business within the past
year), and first-run foreign and
domestic pictures on 15 screens in
eight local theaters. Newly arrived
movie addicts will find their needs
tended to in the following locations:
On Campus
ASSU Sunday Flicks: This is the
most popular film series on campus
— not because it is assembled with
especially good taste, but because
it includes very recent releases and
provides a party-like atmosphere
akin to that of midnight screenings
of "The Rocky Horror Picture
Show." Most people have a great
time, though those who prefer to
see the screen behind the barrage

of paper planes and hear the
soundtrack over the gleefully im
provised commentary may seek
elsewhere. Because the Sunday
Flicks draw such a large crowd,
they screen twice in Memorial
Auditorium (Sunday evenings, of
course).

Stanford Film Society: Though
this series is run by a small, dedi
cated group of undergraduates, it is
drawn up in connection with the
Film Aesthetics and Film History
courses offered in the Communica
tion Department in the fall and win
ter, respectively. (Occasionally

there will be a spring series as well,
but that is rare.) Attendance is
compulsory for students enrolled in
these courses, but the movies — a
highly varied mixture of American
and foreign films, silents and talkies
— are open to everyone. These
pictures are almost always terrific.

German Film Series: This irreg
ular series is sponsored by Haus
Mitteleuropa, where it is shown.
The movies cover a wide spectrum
of German film. Classics like "M"
and "Metropolis" often pop up, as
well as examples of contemporary
German cinema and relatively

obscure entries. It's impossible to
predict if and when the German
Film Series will happen; keep an
eye out for flyers around campus.
Law School Film Society: Like
the publicity surrounding this se
ries, the choice of movies varies
greatly according to who is in
charge of it from term to term. It's

generally an agreeable, nostalgic
collection of Hollywood classics like
"Little Women," "The Big Sleep"
and "Bringing Up Baby," and it
draws affectionate, fairly quiet
audiences. Friday nights in Kresge

Great Directors Film Series:
The most esoteric movies in town
— this is a series for diehard movie
goers. The selection depends on
the tastes of the two or three
people who operate it, but the em
phasis is generally placed on foreign
films, particularly by highly experi
mental directors whose work would
be unlikely to turn up even in most
revival theaters.
