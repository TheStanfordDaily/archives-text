# Shakespeare, Beckett and O'Neill: Thespians Make the Stage Come Alive

What museums are to Florence, the theater is
to San Francisco.
No matter how much people talk about San
Francisco opera, or the City's nightclubs, it is
the area's hundreds of theater groups that
validate San Francisco's claim to West Coast cul
tural supremacy.
The most important activity takes place in the
many small theater groups scattered around San
Francisco and Berkeley; the following account
starts closer to home, covering the campus and
area theater first, then moving to the city's
major groups, and finally arriving at the smaller
venues.
The Stanford Drama Department
presents a major play each quarter, with produc
tions usually taking place in the Little Theatre
behind Memorial Auditorium. The productions
are directed and designed by members of the de
partment, but cast auditions are open to the
public, and students from fields other than drama
are often cast.
In addition to the major productions, the de
partment sponsors Graduate Directing
Workshops, "no frills" productions directed by
the department's graduate students. These are
held at The Nitery, in the Old Union, and there is
no admission charge. No titles have been an
nounced for this year; watch for posters or ad
vertisements in The Daily.
There are several successful, ongoing,
student-run producing companies on campus.
Chief among these is Rams Head, which

produces "Gaieties," a comedy revue, during
the Big Game week in the fall, and a major musi
cal production each spring. Both "Gaieties" and
the musical are put on in Memorial Auditorium.
The group also produces a program of one-act
plays written by students. The Company is a
smaller group, with a production schedule less
cut-and-dried than Rams Head's; individual initia
tive counts for more in determining what plays
are produced and when. The Company's produc
tions vary greatly in scope, ranging in recent
years from the elaborate stagings of "Hair" and
"Jesus Christ Superstar" to a traveling troupe
that went from dorm to dorm doing "The Fantas
ticks" in lounges.
The Black Performing Arts Group and the
Asian American Theatre Project also do
plays, usually concentrating their efforts on
spring quarter. Five years ago the AATP put on
the first performance anywhere of David Henry
Hwang's FOB, a play which was later produced
by Joseph Papp in New York to critical acclaim.
All of the student production companies rely,
of course, on student ability in all areas: perfor
mance, direction, set and lighting, costume work
and promotion. Announcements regarding audi
tions and support positions appear in The Daily
and in flyers posted around campus.
Spring quarter is the great season for dorm
productions. Most of the larger dorms, and even
some of the smaller ones, put on plays in the
spring. The repertoire is drawn mainly from
Broadway, either comedies ("You're a Good

Man, Charlie Brown"; "The Best Little
Whorehouse in Texas") or musicals
("Oklahoma"; "Grease"). Occasionally some
thing a bit more cerebral is attempted. Over the
years, some dorms have gained a reputation for
the lavishness of their productions; Toyon,
Lagunita and Branner are famous in this regard.
In San Francisco, the American Conser
vatory Theater, or ACT, ranks with the
Guthries Theatre in Minneapolis as one of the
country's best regional theaters. Its presence in
the Geary Theatre, at 450 Geary in the City,
makes Geary Street the heart of the theater dis
trict. No company in the Bay Area, or even on
the West Coast (outside of Shakespearean fes
tival groups) can rival the ACT in performance,
facilities or reputation. The ACT is an arch
conservative company: they go heavy on the
classics, and the modern (meaning 1920) plays
they do perform tend to be of the sparkling
British wit (Noel Coward) or the folksy-
American ("I Remember Mama," "Ah! Wilder
ness") kind. But they are nearly always a joy to
watch, because no one puts polish on a produc
tion these days like the ACT.
The big money in San Francisco theater is tied
up in Carole Shorenstein's two "Best of Broad
way" series. "Best of Broadway" plays in three
different theatres: the Golden Gate, 25 Taylor
St.; the Orpheum, 1192 Market St.; and the
Currant, 445 Geary St. (next door to the


Stanford students Polly Firestone and Awetu Simesso starred
in last year's Drama Department production of Moliere's great
classic, the comedy-drama "Tartuffe."
