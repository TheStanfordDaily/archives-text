# Tomes and Texts To Buy or Browse
## 
### 
Between California Avenue, in
Palo Alto, and Santa Cruz Avenue,
in Menlo Park, there are nearly 30
different stores that sell only, or
primarily, books. In addition, a
number of other establishments —
thrift shops, consignment shops,
outdoor stores, etc. — keep books
on hand. Any attempt to cover
them all would be overwhelming.
The place to start, of course, is
on campus. The Stanford
Bookstore is both more than, and
less than, a good bookstore. More,
because half of its floor space is
given over to office, art and engi
neering supplies, clothing, candy
and cookies, stationery, cards and
hundreds of items that say
"Stanford." The bookstore also
stocks textbooks (upstairs), cashes
checks (on Saturdays), orders art
prints and does a plethora of other
things most bookstores won't.
If you are looking for something
specific, the selection is very good
in most areas (particularly art his
tory and literary criticism), but the
atmosphere in the front of the
store, where the books are
shelved, is such as to force you to
find the book you want quickly and
leave. The lighting is unpleasant,
and there is no seating of any kind;
the rows of often-crowded check
out lines make the store resemble
nothing so much as a supermarket.
It's a good place to find a book
(they will also order anything in
print), but it ranks low as a place for
looking at books.
The campus is bracketed by the
area's two best "new book"
bookstores. To the southeast, and
slightly closer, is Printers Inc.
(310 California Ave.). Printers Inc.
is relatively new (it was started by
five former Kepler's employees)
and has quickly become the most
popular place around, largely on the
strength of its expresso bar and
artsy/literary ambiance. Printers
Inc. calls itself "the literary
bookstore," and most nights the

store is full of professors of En
glish, local artists types, a few real
writers and a lot of people trying
hard to look like they belong.
Another drawback is the lack of
ventilation — Printers Inc. is a hot
place if you're more than 10 feet
from the door. Atmospheric condi
tions aside, however, Printers Inc.,
is a good store, well-stocked in
most areas (both hard- and soft
cover), especially strong in
children's books and fiction, with
lots of chair s scattered around and
nice carpeting (a rarity). Last, and
best, is the magazine selection.
Scattered around the front of the
store are hundreds of periodicals,
everything from "Arizona High
ways" to "Die Zeit," and also the
area's best selection of scholarly
and literary journals.
Northwest of campus, along El
Camino Real in Menlo Park, lies
Kepler's. Kepler's is a local
landmark, having been a focus of
"radical" activity in the '60s. The
store has moved with the times; its
image is now compsed of equal
parts of environmental awareness,
small-scale technology advocacy,
and championship of small and
avant-garde presses.
The main bragging point at
Kepler's, as far as books go, is its
claim to be the biggest paperback
bookstore around. This may be
ture — you can find almost anything
there — but the sterile, shopping
mall feel of the store's new building
(it moved a couple of years ago and
discourages browsing). The old
store didn't have the carpeting or
stained shelves of a Printers Inc.,
but its sheer size made it a nice
place to browse — there were any
number of nooks and crannies to
lose yourself in.
One feature that has been carried
over is an alcove with chairs and
tables where no one bothers you
while you read and a copier bearing
a sign that asks you not to break the
spines of the books you xerox.

Kepler's has a magazine selection
second only to Printers Inc. among
local bookstores, and a section
devoted to small press publications.
Both stores are open late most
nights.
Several other "new book" stores
deserve mention. There are three
very different stores in downtown
Palo Alto: Shirley Cobb (452 Uni
versity Ave.), Stacey's (219 Uni
versity Ave.), and Plowshare
Community Booksellers (162
University Ave.). Shirley Cobb is
the epitome of the small-scale, per
sonalized bookstore. It stocks only
hardcover, and the selection is

aimed at affluent, educated subur
banites. This makes it a bit expen
sive, but browsing is fun, and it's a
wonderful place to shop for a gift.
Stacey's began strictly as a medi
cal/technical store but has ex
panded into most of the general
areas. The technical areas still
seem to be the store's strength
Plowshare was founded about 13
years ago by a group of Stanford
graduates, and is very community
oriented; it's the place to go for
news of environmental, anti-nuclear
or any "counter-culture" happen
ings. It is, at the same time, an ex
cellent small paperback store, with

a good selection of fiction and a
children's alcove; the back room is
reserved for the sections of Eas
tern religions, homesteading, etc.
Behind Macy's, in the Stanford
Shopping Center, you'll find Books
Inc., a hard-cover/soft-cover store
notable for its paperback mystery
and science fiction stocks and its
remainder talbes and shelves. In
the Old Mill Shopping Center, off
San Antonio Road in Mountain
View, is Upstart Crow & Co.
This bookstore/cafe has little in the
way of books, but if you have to be
in the Old Mill, it's not a bad place to
get a cup of coffee.
A number of stores cater to par
ticular needs. The most common of
this type is the religious bookstore.
My favorite bookstore name in the
area used to be that of the One
Way Bookstore (320 California
Ave.), a Christian shop that closed
three years ago. Still in business
are The Angelus (779 Santa Cruz
Ave., Menlo Park) and the East-
West Bookshop (1170 El Camino,
Menlo Park), which is heavily into
the mystic. The most interesting
store of this type I've found is
Minerva Books (1027 Alma
Street, Palo Alto), a small but very
attractive store with interesting se
lections in mythology and all
religions and without the self
conscious "mysticism" of other
stores like itself.
A distant relative of the religious
bookstore is the science fiction and
fantasy bookstore. Comics and
Comix in downtown Palo Alto (515
Cowper St.) has lots of comic
books, San Francisco paperbacks,
posters and magazines; its stock
runs toward sadistic Rorn, and the
clientel appears to be mostly high
school age. Future Fantasy
(2033 El Camino, Palo Alto) is
smaller, but more serious.
For Slavophiles, Szwede Slavic
Books (2233 El Camino, Palo Alto)
is one of the finest Russian and Eas
tern European bookstores outside

of Paris or New York, featuring
traditional titles as well as hard-to
find items, plus immigrant
newspapers like Novoye Russkoye
Slovo. Szwede also stocks a wide
range of maps, dictionaries and
grammar textbooks, making this an
ideal stopping place for Slavic lang
uage students of all levels. The
shop's owners are delighted to en
tertain questions.
If you're interested in used
books, for economy's or collecting's
sake, you will want to go to
Berkeley as often as possible.
Having said that, I must admit that
there are a couple of stores around
here that nearly match up, the dif
ferences being mainly of size rather
than quality.
For collectors, the two most im
portant stores in this area are
Chimaera Books & Records and
Wessex Used Books &
Records. Wessex, located near the
corner of El Camino and Santa Cruz
in Menlo Park, is strictly a used
book store. The stock is mostly
hard-cover, and the specialty is
modern fiction. Wessex is a small
store (two rooms), and outside of
fiction its selection is rather
skimpy. But there are enough
novels to keep you browsing for
hours, and the prices are very
reasonable, as first editions go.
Chimaera is another story. The
store takes up most of the two
story house on the corner of Kipling
and Lytton, in downtown Palo Alto.
After all this, there is still one un
resolved issue: Where you should
go to buy The Sunday New York
Times? The closest place is The
Store at Tresidder Union; the
store gets the paper late and sells
out early. Better is Printers Inc.,
where you can read the paper over
a cup of French roast, assuming
you can find an empty table. Best,
however, is Mac's Smoke Shop
(534 Emerson St.), half a block
form the Good Earth Restaurant in
downtown Palo Alto.

wonderful place to shop for a gift.
Stacey's began strictly as a medi
cal/technical store but has ex
panded into most of the general
areas. The technical areas still
seem to be the store's strength
Plowshare was founded about 13
years ago by a group of Stanford
graduates, and is very community
oriented; it's the place to go for
news of environmental, anti-nuclear
or any "counter-culture" happen
ings. It is, at the same time, an ex
cellent small paperback store, with

a good selection of fiction and a
children's alcove; the back room is
reserved for the sections of Eas
tern religions, homesteading, etc.
Behind Macy's, in the Stanford
Shopping Center, you'll find Books
Inc., a hard-cover/soft-cover store
notable for its paperback mystery
and science fiction stocks and its
remainder talbes and shelves. In
the Old Mill Shopping Center, off
San Antonio Road in Mountain
View, is Upstart Crow & Co.
This bookstore/cafe has little in the
way of books, but if you have to be
in the Old Mill, it's not a bad place to
get a cup of coffee.
A number of stores cater to par
ticular needs. The most common of
this type is the religious bookstore.
My favorite bookstore name in the
area used to be that of the One
Way Bookstore (320 California
Ave.), a Christian shop that closed
three years ago. Still in business
are The Angelus (779 Santa Cruz
Ave., Menlo Park) and the East-
West Bookshop (1170 El Camino,
Menlo Park), which is heavily into
the mystic. The most interesting
store of this type I've found is
Minerva Books (1027 Alma
Street, Palo Alto), a small but very
attractive store with interesting se
lections in mythology and all
religions and without the self
conscious "mysticism" of other
stores like itself.
A distant relative of the religious
bookstore is the science fiction and
fantasy bookstore. Comics and
Comix in downtown Palo Alto (515
Cowper St.) has lots of comic
books, San Francisco paperbacks,
posters and magazines; its stock
runs toward sadistic Rorn, and the
clientel appears to be mostly high
school age. Future Fantasy
(2033 El Camino, Palo Alto) is
smaller, but more serious.
For Slavophiles, Szwede Slavic
Books (2233 El Camino, Palo Alto)
is one of the finest Russian and Eas
tern European bookstores outside

of Paris or New York, featuring
traditional titles as well as hard-to
find items, plus immigrant
newspapers like Novoye Russkoye
Slovo. Szwede also stocks a wide
range of maps, dictionaries and
grammar textbooks, making this an
ideal stopping place for Slavic lang
uage students of all levels. The
shop's owners are delighted to en
tertain questions.
If you're interested in used
books, for economy's or collecting's
sake, you will want to go to
Berkeley as often as possible.
Having said that, I must admit that
there are a couple of stores around
here that nearly match up, the dif
ferences being mainly of size rather
than quality.
For collectors, the two most im
portant stores in this area are
Chimaera Books & Records and
Wessex Used Books &
Records. Wessex, located near the
corner of El Camino and Santa Cruz
in Menlo Park, is strictly a used
book store. The stock is mostly
hard-cover, and the specialty is
modern fiction. Wessex is a small
store (two rooms), and outside of
fiction its selection is rather
skimpy. But there are enough
novels to keep you browsing for
hours, and the prices are very
reasonable, as first editions go.
Chimaera is another story. The
store takes up most of the two
story house on the corner of Kipling
and Lytton, in downtown Palo Alto.
After all this, there is still one un
resolved issue: Where you should
go to buy The Sunday New York
Times? The closest place is The
Store at Tresidder Union; the
store gets the paper late and sells
out early. Better is Printers Inc.,
where you can read the paper over
a cup of French roast, assuming
you can find an empty table. Best,
however, is Mac's Smoke Shop
(534 Emerson St.), half a block
form the Good Earth Restaurant in
downtown Palo Alto.

Between California Avenue, in
Palo Alto, and Santa Cruz Avenue,
in Menlo Park, there are nearly 30
different stores that sell only, or
primarily, books. In addition, a
number of other establishments —
thrift shops, consignment shops,
outdoor stores, etc. — keep books
on hand. Any attempt to cover
them all would be overwhelming.
The place to start, of course, is
on campus. The Stanford
Bookstore is both more than, and
less than, a good bookstore. More,
because half of its floor space is
given over to office, art and engi
neering supplies, clothing, candy
and cookies, stationery, cards and
hundreds of items that say
"Stanford." The bookstore also
stocks textbooks (upstairs), cashes
checks (on Saturdays), orders art
prints and does a plethora of other
things most bookstores won't.
If you are looking for something
specific, the selection is very good
in most areas (particularly art his
tory and literary criticism), but the
atmosphere in the front of the
store, where the books are
shelved, is such as to force you to
find the book you want quickly and
leave. The lighting is unpleasant,
and there is no seating of any kind;
the rows of often-crowded check
out lines make the store resemble
nothing so much as a supermarket.
It's a good place to find a book
(they will also order anything in
print), but it ranks low as a place for
looking at books.
The campus is bracketed by the
area's two best "new book"
bookstores. To the southeast, and
slightly closer, is Printers Inc.
(310 California Ave.). Printers Inc.
is relatively new (it was started by
five former Kepler's employees)
and has quickly become the most
popular place around, largely on the
strength of its expresso bar and
artsy/literary ambiance. Printers
Inc. calls itself "the literary
bookstore," and most nights the

store is full of professors of En
glish, local artists types, a few real
writers and a lot of people trying
hard to look like they belong.
Another drawback is the lack of
ventilation — Printers Inc. is a hot
place if you're more than 10 feet
from the door. Atmospheric condi
tions aside, however, Printers Inc.,
is a good store, well-stocked in
most areas (both hard- and soft
cover), especially strong in
children's books and fiction, with
lots of chair s scattered around and
nice carpeting (a rarity). Last, and
best, is the magazine selection.
Scattered around the front of the
store are hundreds of periodicals,
everything from "Arizona High
ways" to "Die Zeit," and also the
area's best selection of scholarly
and literary journals.
Northwest of campus, along El
Camino Real in Menlo Park, lies
Kepler's. Kepler's is a local
landmark, having been a focus of
"radical" activity in the '60s. The
store has moved with the times; its
image is now compsed of equal
parts of environmental awareness,
small-scale technology advocacy,
and championship of small and
avant-garde presses.
The main bragging point at
Kepler's, as far as books go, is its
claim to be the biggest paperback
bookstore around. This may be
ture — you can find almost anything
there — but the sterile, shopping
mall feel of the store's new building
(it moved a couple of years ago and
discourages browsing). The old
store didn't have the carpeting or
stained shelves of a Printers Inc.,
but its sheer size made it a nice
place to browse — there were any
number of nooks and crannies to
lose yourself in.
One feature that has been carried
over is an alcove with chairs and
tables where no one bothers you
while you read and a copier bearing
a sign that asks you not to break the
spines of the books you xerox.

Kepler's has a magazine selection
second only to Printers Inc. among
local bookstores, and a section
devoted to small press publications.
Both stores are open late most
nights.
Several other "new book" stores
deserve mention. There are three
very different stores in downtown
Palo Alto: Shirley Cobb (452 Uni
versity Ave.), Stacey's (219 Uni
versity Ave.), and Plowshare
Community Booksellers (162
University Ave.). Shirley Cobb is
the epitome of the small-scale, per
sonalized bookstore. It stocks only
hardcover, and the selection is

aimed at affluent, educated subur
banites. This makes it a bit expen
sive, but browsing is fun, and it's a
wonderful place to shop for a gift.
Stacey's began strictly as a medi
cal/technical store but has ex
panded into most of the general
areas. The technical areas still
