# It's Almost Like The Louvre

Keeping track of Bay Area art — what is being done,
and what is being exhibited — is the hardest job of all
for the culture hound. Outside of a few major
museums, art is the least publicized aspect of the local
cultural life. Adding to the problem is the number of
small galleries, especially in San Francisco, many of
which stage consistently important exhibits that last a
month or less and that you won't know about unless
you seek them out. Because of the vast number of
places in the area that exhibit art, the following account
is destined to be highly arbitrary, covering but a few of
the more important venues.
The Stanford Art Department maintains both the
Stanford Museum of Art and the Stanford Art
Gallery. The museum's permanent collection is a
marvelous resource for students; all periods of
European art are represented, and there are rooms
devoted to Greek and Roman, Asian and Oceanic art as
well. There is a large gallery devoted to Stanford fam
ily memorabilia. The museum's main claim to fame is
its renowned Rodin collection, which is housed in a
special rotunda within the museum and newly con
structed outdoor garden west of the building; the cen
terpiece of the garden is a full-sized casting of "The
Gates of Hell." The museum's upstairs balconies, and
the Meidel Room, hold special exhibits.
The Stanford Gallery, amid the Graduate School of
Business, Hoover Tower and the Art and History
buildings, holds rotating exhibits throughout the year,
including the annual show of work by candidates for the
Master of Fine Arts degree. The Gallery building also
houses the Gallery Bookshop, which sells art books,
cards and posters.
A number of other places on campus hang exhibits
more or less regularly. STARTS (Student Arts at Stan
ford) puts on monthly exhibits in the Coffee House,
mainly of student photography, and in the upstairs
lobby of Tresidder Union. The Bechtel International
Center puts on exhibits with international, often Third
World, themes.
San Francisco is home to four major museums, three
of which are under common management. These
three, the "Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco," are
the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum and the
Asian Art Museum (both in the same building in
Golden Gate Park) and the California Palace of the
Legion of Honor (Lincoln Park). The de Young's col
lection, which encompasses Western art from the
Greeks and Romans to early 20th-century European
and American, isn't particularly noteworthy (i.e., one
visit is pnnnoM hut the museum plays host to many of

the top national traveling shows — in recent years San
Francisco money has brought the Tut, Alexander,
Shanghai, etc. — to the de Young. The Asian Art
Museum has one of the best permanent collections in
its field in the country; unfortunately, there isn't
enough room on the walls for more than a fraction of it.
The collection is constantly rotated. The Palace of the
Legion of Honor collection is composed entirely of
French art, from medieval tapestries to a room of im
pressionists and post-impressionists. In the basement
of the Legion is the museum's graphic arts depart
ment, which puts up rotating exhibits of prints and
drawings. The Legion also draws big-name temporary
exhibits — the Phillips collection and the Dresden ex
hibit have been there in recent years.
The fourth of San Francisco's big museums is the
rather small Museum of Modern Art (Van Ness and
McAllister, in the Civic Center). The MOMA can't
pretend to be a catalogue of 20th-century art, like its
namesake in New York; in fact, its permanent collec
tion is surprisingly meager. It has its strengths,
however, especially its vast photography holdings (too
little of which are ever hung) and a room of monumen
tal paintings by local abstract expressionist Clyfford
Still. MOMA, like the Fine Arts Museums, draws big
traveling exhibits all the time (San Francisco probably
draws more of these than any American city outside
New York).
Across the bay, the Oakland Museum (1000 Oak
St., near Lake Merritt and the Lake Merritt BART sta
tion) is worth a visit if only for the building itself, an
award-winning concrete pile with roof-top gardens, de
signed by Kevin Roche. The museum is officially The
Museum of California and has galleries devoted to Cali
fornia art, history and natural sciences.
Also worth seeing is the University Art Museum
at the University of California at Berkeley (2626
Bancroft Way). The museum owes its existence, and a
large part of its collection and initial funding, to German
painter Hans Hoffman. Hoffman spend the second
world war as a refugee at the Berkeley campus, and as
a show of gratitude gave a group of his canvases and a
large sum of money to the university so that it could
build a museum. His large, abstract paintings are still
the museum's centerpiece.
By far the liveliest part of San Francisco's art world
is the scads of galleries scattered around town. The
good ones may be hard to find (if you can tell from the
street that something is a gallery, it probably isn't
worth a visit), but a little searching pays off.
