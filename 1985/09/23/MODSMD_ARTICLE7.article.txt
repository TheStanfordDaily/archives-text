# Trustees Favor Unity With Hoover
## Sept. 10 report acknowledges Very real difficulties' in University-Hoover relations 
### DAVID RISSER Editorial staff 
The Stanford Board of Trustees will work to
forge a "systematically cooperative relationship"
between the Hoover Institution and the Univer
sity in order to maximize potential benefits from
Hoover's "extraordinary resources of scholar
ship," according to the board's Committee on
the Hoover Institution.
At its Sept. 10 meeting, the board endorsed
and adopted a report from the committee that
says a "will toward achieving such a relationship
exists in Hoover and in all segments of the Uni
versity. "
In the search for "informed answers in the
area of the policy sciences," Stanford's role will
"depend in significant measure on how effec
tively the relationship between Hoover and the
rest of the University is developed," the trustee
committee said.

But the committee also recognizes "the very
real difficulties that exist at present in the rela
tionship," according to its report.
There is ongoing friction between some Uni
versity departments and Hoover regarding the
selection of Hoover fellows to teach in the de
partments. In addition, some faculty members
question the institution's very presence on the
Stanford campus and Stanford support of an in
stitution that is nationally regarded as a conser
vative think tank.
The trustee committee was formed in 1983 as
a result of the disputes. Frank Tatum, a San
Francisco attorney, is chairman of the commit
tee, which includes Board of Trustees President
Warren Christopher and University President
Donald Kennedy.
The trustees say they want to relieve the dif
ferences for the benefit of both institutions.
"Stanford with Hoover, operating in a
cooperative relationship, has the potential to

make most significant contributions to re scan;
on the crucial domestic and international polk
issues of our times," the/said.
The committee praised the 1985 annual repor
of the Overseers of the Hoover Institution fo
also appreciating the importance of a successhi
relationship between Hoover and the University
The Hoover Board of Overseers, whic
issued the report, is appointed by the Board o
Trustees.
University Provost James Rosse said tfo
overseers' report "highlights a growing record |
achievement and a high level of accomplishment
at Hoover.
Rosse, however, found some "snags" in th
overseers' report, including its failure to not
that the University will contribute 29 percent c
Hoover's estimated $12 million budget for 1985
86.
