# Tried and True Traditions

### 
Puzzling over that row of bronze numbered plaques in front of Memorial
Church? Those plaques, set in the tiles of the Quad since 1892, conceal
one of the few remaining Stanford traditions.
Each graduating class over the years has interred a time capsule con
taining the memorabilia of its short era at Stanford — everything from
armbands to the "Saturday Night Fever" soundtrack, from Lacoste shirts
to punk rock paraphernalia. The capsules are to be opened, one per year,
starting with the University's centennial in 1992.
But other Stanford traditions have not stood the test of time so well and
like many collegiate whims have gone the way of panty raids and streaking.
Some conventions out of the Stanford archives that freshmen need not
learn, but may enjoy reading about, include:
• Only seniors may wear corduroy pants.
• No freshmen men are allowed on the Row.
• No smoking in the Quad.
• No women on the steps of the Law building (which is now the Political
Science Dept.).
• No corsages at Stanford dances except the Senior Ball.
• Candy or flowers are a must for women subjected to the indignity of
being locked out after dormitory closing hours.
• No men allowed in women's dorms except in social rooms.
• No women allowed alone in men's dorms, fraternities or off campus.
• An annual Hello Day in the fall when everyone must say hello to every
one else.
• And last but not least, the traditional Big Game bonfire has been forever
extinguished.
The demise of many of these traditions came with women's liberation
and the sexual revolution of the '60s. Others just faded into a past that held
such scriptures more dearly.
However, freshmen must still be on their guard for one tradition which
is still going strong. As iegend has it, in fact, one cannot truly be called a
Stanford man or woman until one has been kissed in the middle of the Quad
at midnight during a full moon by a senior. Bring a bottle of champagne and
do it up right — you'll be in good company.
