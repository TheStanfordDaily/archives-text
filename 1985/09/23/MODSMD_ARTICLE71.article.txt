# Scaling up How They Make Music on the Farm
## 
### KURT JOHNSON 
The Stanford student interested
in music does not have to look far to
find a group to match his interests.
There are campus groups in cham
ber music, symphony, chorus, band
and about 10 other offerings.
Auditions for all music groups will
take place on Monday and Tuesday,
Sept. 24 and 25, and are not
restricted to music majors. A num
ber of the performing groups are
open to the community — the
Chorus, directed by Bill Ramsey;
the Church Choir, directed by
Gregory Wait; both the Symphony
and Chamber orchestras, directed
by Andor Toth; and Alea 11, the en
semble for new music, directed by
Paul Nahay. Other groups normally
restricted to Stanford students are
the Chorale; Glee Club; Marching,
Symphonic and Jazz Bands; Early
Music Siiigers; and the Renaissance
Wind Band.
All performing groups with the
exception of the chorus receive one
unit of credit each quarter. The
chorus members receive two units
because they perform each Sunday
in Memorial Church.
The Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity Marching Band meets at the
Band Shak. Try-outs for the Band
are Monday and Tuesday Sept 24
and 25 7 /» sign up at the Band Shak.
Audition schedules for all per

forming groups are available at the
Music Department, the Tresidder
information desk and in the dorms.
Students who want to join a
smaller group for chamber music
can receive instruction from a
member of the Music Department.
Individual chamber groups receive
one unit of credit. Stephen Har
rison, cellist in the Stanford String

Stanford Quartet, from violinist

the cost of lessons by applying for a
Music Guild Scholarship, good for
$100 each quarter off the price of
lessons.

in Braun Hall next to the post of-

Braun Music Center, just completed last
year, has increased student involvement
in the Music Department and made life

certs each year by the Music De
partment. There are over 100 con
certs each year that feature Stan
ford performers and ensembles.
