11. Stanford
Football and
Big Game.
It's the second year of
the second Elway Era
here, and the Card is
getting its defenses up
for its exciting season.
And the even more
exciting culmination of
that season — Big
Game. Need we say
more? Yes: Beat Cal.

10. Stanford
Hoops
The Cardinal is on the
line to take a shot at
improving its record.
Steve Brown is back
after recovering from an
injury, and combined
with the likes of Andy
Fischer and Keith
Ramee the hoopsters
should be able to dunk
quite a few of their foes.

13. The Card in the Water
It's a pool full of Olympians — Pablo Morales, JohnMoffet, Jeff Kostoff. Last
year the men won the NCAA championships. The women are also in the
swim of things with Libby Kinkead, Susan Rapp and Marybeth Linzmeier.

14. The Tree and The Band
Those merry monsters of madcap melody, those
irresistible imps of irreverency . . . the truly
incomparable Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Hand. And don't forget the tree — it looks
like a dancing green mutation, but it's a much
beloved mascot.

12. Stanford
Tennis
Does the name John
McEnroe sound familiar?
Excellence in Stanford
tennis is a revered
tradition. This year both
the men and the women
will try for smashing
finishes to their seasons
at the NCAAs.

15. Club Sports j
Ever seen a cricket game? Or a synchronized swim
meet? Add crew, lacrosse, rugby, badminton,
sailing, karate and over 30 sports to the list and the
sum total equals Stanford Club Sports. Fun to play.
Fun to watch.
