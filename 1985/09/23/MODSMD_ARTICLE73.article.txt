# A
						New Chapter To Begin for the Card

As the professional baseball season draws to a
close, a couple of important streaks will continue.
For the 40th straight season the Chicago Cubs will
not win a pennant, and for the 31st straight season
neither will the Cleveland Indians.
So what, you may ask, do these streaks of futility
have to do with the Stanford basketball team and a
college basketball season that is still several months
away?
Well, as for how Stanford will perform on the
hardwood, very little. But when you talk about
streaks of futility, not even the the Cubs and the In
dians measure up to the Cardinal. If there's one sure
bet in sports, it's that the 1985-86 season will mark
the 44th season in which Stanford will not receive a

post-season tournament bid.
Stanford is predicted to come in ninth in the
Pacific 10 Conference this season. Last season, it
was predicted to finish ninth as well, but fooled all
the experts and finished 10th (or last, for those of
you who don't know what the 10 in Pac-10 means)
with a 3-15 record in the conference and a 11-17
record overall. %
With some simple subtraction, even freshmen
who have trouble figuring out the map in the Time
Schedule will realize that the Cardinal was 8-2 in its
non-conference schedule. From that you might
come to the conclusion that the Pac-10 is a tough
conference for basketball.
That's not really a bad conclusion on face value.

Senior Steve Brown is set to return from his 84-85 redshirt year â€” his left leg's stress
fracture has healed. In 83-84 Brown's shooting average was 10.9 per game.
