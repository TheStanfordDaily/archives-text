# Elway's Second Year
## 
### TOM SENF Young. Improved. Deep 
These are the words used most
often when describing the 1985
Stanford football team. However,
as the Cardinal faces another diffi
cult schedule — last year's slate
was the seventh toughest in the na
tion — words like young, improved
and deep can easily become eu
phemisms for inexperienced, out
manned and mediocre.
In Jack Elway's first year at the
helm, Stanford posted a respec
table 5-6 record, a vast improve
ment over the 1-10 nightmare the
Cardinal endured under Paul Wiggin
in 1983. Stanford would have had
its first winning mark since 1980
had it not blown a 28-point lead
against Washington State in the
season's seventh game.
According to Elway, fall practice
has been a success. "Our camp has
gone extremely well," he said.

"When this team came back, it was
as well conditioned as any I've ever
been associated with, which proved
to me that football means a lot to
them."
Unfortunately, the Cardinal will
not be able to survive in the rugged
Pacific-10 Conference on attitude
and conditioning alone. The team
has serious question marks on both
lines and in the secondary. In all,
only nine starters — six on offense,
three on defense — return.
Four members of the 1984 offen
sive line are gone, three of whom
were drafted by the N.F.L. Only

senior right tackle John Barns
remains. The situation up front
became even worse when Kevin
Payne, who was slated to start at
left guard, was lost for the season
with a knee injury.
Still, the team is confident that
left tackle Robbie Coffin, left guard
Andy Sinclair, center Kurt Joseph
son and right guard Tom Nye will
be able to get the job done.
"In scrimmages I've had time to
throw," quarterback John Paye
said. "I feel comfortable working
with them."
Barns doesn't believe his
linemates' inexperience will be a
problem. "1 don't think it's going to
be as big a factor as everyone says.
We're going to get better as we go
along."
Stanford has an equal number of
experienced offensive and defen
sive linemen — one. Nose guard
Eric Volta is the only returnee
among the Cardinal's top six 1984

defensive linemen.
However, there is cause for op
timism. "I'm more enthused about
the defensive line than I was in the
spring," Elway said. "(Left tackle)
Sean Scheller has size, speed and
quickness. He should be an out
standing defensive tackle."
The right side of the Cardinal line
will be anchored by junior tackle Joe
Lortie. Elway is also hoping for
contributions from two promising
freshman, Ray Huckestein and Tim
Roggeman.
Unlike the two lines, which were
solid units decimated by graduation,

the secondary was Stanford's most
consistent weakness last season.
The Cardinal pass defense was the
worst in the Pac-10 last year, sur
rendering 227.2 yards per flame
through the air.
Left cornerback Toi Cook is the
secondary's lone returning starter.
Elway calls Cook, who had two in
terceptions in hist year's Hig Game,
"our most improved defensive
back."
The right corner is manned by
senior Walt Harris, with Brad
Humphreys and Mark Hashimoto
starting at safety. Hashimoto tied
Cook for the team lead in intercep
tions last year with four.
Elway believes that a year of ex
perience with his defensive system
should improve the secondary.
"They should be more solid and
more familiar with our coverages
and overall defensive scheme," he
said.
Increased speed has been a high

priority with the Cardinal defensive
backs this year. Cook and Harris
have lowered their times in the 40-
yard dash to 4.5 seconds, with Hash
imoto and Humphreys cutting
theirs to 4.7 seconds.
"Our main thrust is to get more
quickness in the defense," Elway
said. "I've always found it difficult
to coach speed."
If the offensive line jells, Stanford
will move the ball. The Cardinal has
talent and depth at all the skill posi
tions, especially at quarterback and

Junior John Paye rises above the rest. The quarterback, last season a Pac-10 leader in passing
and offense, is ready to call signals again for the Card after outstanding performances in pre
season camp.
