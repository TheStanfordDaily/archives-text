Experience is aplenty, but the Stanford men's soccer
team will face a tough 1985 schedule.
Spearheading Stanford's charge will be Giancarlo Fer
ruzzi, the team scoring leader the past two seasons.
Also, keep an eye on these seniors: Angel Vazquez,
second-team All PSC player Rob West and the Rafalovich
brothers, Todd and Tom. Alan Branson and Tom Austin
will battle to start at goalie.
