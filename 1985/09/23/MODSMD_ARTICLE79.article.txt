# Tear Down the Fields With Your Friends
## IM sure that IMs are IMmensely fun 
### CLAY CALVERT 
Watching a Cardinal football game
on a Saturday afternoon or a bas
ketball victory over a Pacific-10
power definitely is an exciting part
of life at Stanford. And something
inside each of us watching a game
from the stands, especially those
who played on a high school team,
makes one want to jump up and join
in the game.
Well, take heart, fellow
frustrated high school jocks. Intra
mural sports at Stanford are big.
Very big. And it's quite likely that
the sport you played in high school
is offered on the Farm. You can also
try your hand at something new,
perhaps ultimate frisbee or inner
tube water polo, both offered in the
spring.
More than 6,000 students partici
pate in intramurals at some point in
the school year, either in individual
sports such as tennis or in a team
activity like football. Nearly all
freshman teams are dorm-oriented,
as RAs organize sigh-ups for the
various sports at house meetings.
Most of the fraternities approach
IMs with a zeal surpassed only by
the fervor exerted in their partying.
To determine the overall cham
pion, points are awarded based on a
team's finish in each sport. The
captain of the winning team is pre
sented with a trophy symbolic of
the accomplishment at the first
home game of the season the fol
lowing fall.
During fall, the big IM sport at
Stanford is seven-man, two-hand
touch football. There are approxi
mately 25 football leagues, each

containing six teams. The sport,
played at both an A and B level, also
includes coed and women's teams,
with the coed version being particu
larly popular among freshmen.
Four-played volleyball is another
popular fall activity on the Farm.
Even if you're not from the beaches
of Southern California or have
never seen a volleyball game other
than those during the 1984 Olym
pics, give this sport a try. Your
roommates just might think you're
some kind of athletic deity if you
sacrifice your body while diving for
a ball.
Other fall sports include ping
pong, billiards and three-on-three
basketball.
During the winter, men's and
women's five-on-five basketball
dominates the IM scene. Not only
does this sport offer the greatest
number of leagues, but it is also one
of the most competitive games at
the University. This is your oppor
tunity to play on the hardwood of
Maples Pavilion, presenting a
chance to emulate your favorite
NBA players. Games take place in
the evening, allowing you to take
out your aggressions in a controlled
environment after a frustrating day.
For those of you who don't like
team sports, try something fairly
individual, such as IM tennis. The
IM tournaments really do provide a
taste of competitiveness some
where other than the classroom.
There are singles, doubles and
mixed doubles at A and B levels.
Just plavhing on the courts where
John McEnroe once stroked kind of
inspires you to play well.
