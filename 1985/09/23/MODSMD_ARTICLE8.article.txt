# Orientation Breathes Life Into Stanford
## 
### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff 
Calling orientation activities an "annual breath of
life " University President Donald Kennedy Thursday
greeted the incoming Class of 1989 with a speech that
raised the "heterogeneity" of Stanford and dis
couraged new freshmen and transfers from disrupting
that quality by failing to question authority.
Kennedy opened his speech with accolades for the
intellectual and spiritual freshness he said the group of
1535 freshmen and 104 transfers will bring to the Uni
versity. He warned that the maintenance of this fresh
ness is dependent on the extent to which the incoming
•lass, by raising "difficult issues," is willing to challenge
ts assumptions, and the assumptions of the University
immunity as well.
"You are here to change us just as we are here to
•hange you," he said. "Reflect on the qualities that
nought you here and on the value of the ideas that
ame from them. Question authority, but with the
, en tle curiosity that is even harder to answer than in
lignation? Question authority even when it wears a
:weed jacket."
In a short speech at the end of the welcoming cere
mony, Mike Collins, a member of the Council of Presi
ients, referred back to Kennedy's exhortation and
-aid, "I occasionally like to tell myself I'm a radical, and
. . it's right here in the speech, two words that I
hought were just going to be great, and Mr. Kennedy
night think I was really horrible and stuff. I was going
:o say: 'Question authority.' This man said it! And I'm
>oing to go away tonight instead of feeling like, 'Boy, I
eally told those people how,' feeling like, 'If Don Ken
ledy is going to tell you to question authority, that's a
lamn good sign.' "
Kennedy reflected on the role of the Stanford com
■nunity in "tending the commons" of moral and social
yell-being. He told the audience that the "Stanford
spirit" amounts to more "than merely saying hello to
strangers on campus."
"It includes respect for the disparate views of
jthers," he said. "It extends to a concern for the
reedom to raise difficult subjects and thereby to im
jrove the quality of dinner table conversations and

other forms of discourse. It includes pride of place, a
sense of responsibility for the quality of life we share,
and for the cleanliness and beauty and physical in
tegrity of all its parts."
Kennedy repeatedly made the point in his address
that "difficult issues" are frequently the source of ten
sion in places where intellectual "commerce" is fos
tered. While he emphasized that "the open discussion
of a wide range of ideas about which there are strongly
held views is the essence of what a university commu
nity is all about," he warned against letting
"disagreement" over principles and ideas lead to
"alienation."
"We must feel free to raise the tough issues without
embarrassment and with the faith that personal regard
can withstand honest differences of opinion," Kennedy
said. "That can only happen if we register those differ
ences without animosity, without special claim to moral
superiority."
Kennedy noted that the nature of the Stanford com
munity is such that disagreements over issues are
bound to arise.
"How does a community like ours manage, amidst
such differences, an existence that is both free and
graceful?" he asked. "Primarily, we manage through an
institutional tradition that holds freedom of expression
in very high esteem and goes to great lengths to
preserve and protect it."
If Stanford students lose their commitment to that
tradition, "either we shall become a place in which hos
tility and accusation replace mutual respect and
decency, or we shall fall into a polite but unnatural
silence in which important issues simply don't get
raised," Kennedy said.
Mentioning the case of a Stanford freshman who was
profiled in a national newspaper supplement, Kennedy
took the opportunity to lob a shot at Harvard. On Sept.
1, the supplement "Parade" did a feature on Kathryn
Pearson, a Santa Rosa native who said she chose Stan
ford because "my first love is the violin," and because a
Stanford music instructor told her "that if I decided to
go (to Stanford), I would have the use of a Stradivarius
that Stanford has in its collection."
Pearson added, "None of the other universities of
fered me a Stradivarius for practice and play."

Kennedy observed with amusement that the article
led Harvard President Derek Bok to tell incoming Har
vard freshmen, "If it's to be a war of artifacts, we will
bury (Stanford)." Bok quipped that he would place a
Rembrandt etching from Harvard's collections in each
dormitory room.
Kennedy had the last word on Thursday, noting that
Bok is a 1951 graduate of Stanford.
Preceding Kennedy's address, Dean of Admissions
Jean Fetter noted that admitting the Class of 1989 was
her "freshman year" assignment. She said that the
number of applicants seeking admission to Stanford
rose by 13 percent this year.
Of the 17,660 applicants, according to Fetter, more
than 2,000 had combined SAT scores above 1400, and

nearly 2,800 had straight-A transcripts. "You are dis
tinct individuals, uncommon young men and women,
each about to contribute in many different ways to the
excellence and diversity of the University," Fetter told
the eager-eyed freshmen.
She went on to quote some of the letters applicants
sent to her office, including one that read:
"I feel that the Stanford Office of Admissions should
know that I'm pale, have brown hair, and am fairly
sickly looking. I have been told that everyone at Stan
ford is tanned, blond and healthy looking, so I'm hoping
to get in as part of a minority quota."
Fetter said that this year's applicants came from
