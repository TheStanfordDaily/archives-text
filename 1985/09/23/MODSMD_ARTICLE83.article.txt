Stanford has won eight of the last 10 Pac-fO champion
ships and 84 percent of its matches. More importantly, this
season's players have been together for awhile.
"This team has been together for two years now,"
Coach Dante Dettamanti said. "They're really starting to
know each other better and play better together, which is
typical for a good team. We're starting to know each
other's moves and tendencies and play together so much
better."
