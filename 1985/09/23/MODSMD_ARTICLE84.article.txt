On the women's soccer field, youth will be the Cardinal's
trademark.
Of 25 players, only four seniors will provide leadership
as Stanford seeks to improve on its first-season 7-7
record.
The schedule the Cardinal faces, though, will not help.
Stanford will square off against five teams that finished na
tionally ranked last season.
Four-year starter Carol Berryman will lead the Cardinal's
attempt to rebound from the loss of Susan Moore, whose
11 goals, four assists and 26 points were team highs.
