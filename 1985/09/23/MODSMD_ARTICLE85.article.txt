The Stanford men's cross country team will be looking to
use its returning experience to break onto the national
scene.
The Stanford women will be trying to improve on their
successful past three seasons, when they finished second
in the nation.
Leading the charge for the elusive national champion
ship will be senior captain Regina Jacobs, seniors Alison
Wiley and Michelle Mason, junior Cory Schubert and soph
omore Christa Curtin.
