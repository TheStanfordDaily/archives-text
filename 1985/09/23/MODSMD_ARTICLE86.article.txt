# Born to Run 'Round the Rolling Hills
## 
### 
Every day at Stanford, hundreds
of students, professors, administra
tors and other local residents take
to the running trails that thread
through campus and the surround
ing foothills.
The central campus and its en
virons boast some of the most
varied and challenging runs in the
Bay Area. For starters, there are
two Par Courses on campus, one
starting near Angell Field, the other
near Roble Hall. Each consists of a
series of fitness exercises stag
gered over a two-mile course.
The Lake Lagunita Run
covers about 1.5 miles. Run toward
the lake on Lagunita Drive, keeping
the parking lot and the Bechtel In
ternational Center on your left.
Cross Lomita Drive and run up a
short hill to the Boathouse. Take a
left onto the path between the
Lambda Nu house and the lake.
Follow the path all the way around
the lake until you cross a small
creek. Run along the fence until you
hit the pathway around the lake.
Return to the Boathouse.
University President Donald
Kennedy welcomes running
partners to Run the Dish (a
path that passes a dish-shaped radio
satellite receiver in the hills behind
campus) with him early each nor
ning. Meet behind Hoover House,
where Santa Ynez Street deadends
into Cabrillo Avenue. Call Ken
nedy's office to find out what time

the runners are meeting.
If you prefer solitude on the long
run, take Campus Drive until it hits
Junipero Serra Boulevard, enter
the fenced area, and head for the
Dish on your own. The upward
sloping road to the Dish diverges at
one point: the right fork is a gentler
and longer slope to the top of the
grade. Take a sharp turn to the left
at the to of the hill and run along the
ridge for about a mile or so.
Proceed down the hill, always
bearing to the right. At the bottom
of the hill, cross Junipero Serra and
run down Frenchman's Road to
Mayfield Avenue. Turn left of
Mayfield and return to Campus
Drive to complete the five-mile
course.
To begin the 11-mile Arastradero
Loop, start down Campus Drive
past Wilbur Field. Turn right on
Bowdoin Street. Turn right again
on Stanford Avenue and follow it
until you cross Junipero Serra.
Turn left on Junipero Serra and fol
low it until you reach Old Page Mill
Road. Take a right on Page Mill and
run along it until you cross
Arastradero Road. Turn Right and
follow Arastradero out about two
miles until you reach the "Zott's,"
or Alpine Inn, intersection on
Alpine Road. Turn right and follow
Alpine back past the Ladera Shop
ping Center. Turn right onto
Junipero Serra. Follow Junipero
Serra back past the lake.
