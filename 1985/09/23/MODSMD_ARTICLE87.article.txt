# How I survived...
## The 						Band: In a Word, Ubiquitous 
### MARILYN WANN 
(To get a different view of last year's Big Game be
tween Stanford and the University of California at
Berkeley, then-Daily staff writer Marilyn Wann joined
the Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band.
The following is an account of her week-long stint in the
Band, culminating in Cal's 27-10 defeat to the Card
inal. Wann is currently The Daily's features editor.)

Reader alert! I'm giving fair warning. It's time for
yet another Big Game story rehashing all those tradi
tional axioms, attacks and rude acts.
Some of you probably won't read any further. After
all, Cal students have once again earned the proud
name of weenie and the turkey mortality rate is soaring
like no flightless bird ever could without a gutbusting
holiday in the wings.
So for the discerning reader who has stayed with me
this far into the third paragraph, I'm offering a cash
reward. (Ha! Got your hopes up, no?)
The prize isn't a trip for two to sunny South Dakota
or the Amana Radarange behind door number three but
something rare and precious, something akin to knowl
edge of the great mysteries of life — like the real
meanings behind those obscure Stanford acronyms,
the true color of Cyndi Lauper's hair and the number of
Cliff s Notes consumed by the average freshman each
quarter.
Listen my readers and you shall hear the eyewitness
account of life in the Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band as told by a daring outsider who
tempted fate and returned after a week in the musical
underworld (i.e., the Band Shak) with a normally func
tioning liver.
All right, so it was me. Everything but the heroic
parts are still true, though. I joined the Band and am
willing to tell all. But before I recount the week's
revelry, I need to leave a note for my editors. You
night want to look away for this part; it could get em
barrassing.
(Don't think I've had a mental melt-down just be
cause some of my spelling don't conform with ... a
moment of respectful silence ... the AP Stylebook.
When in the Band, one does not leave messy letters
like "s" dangling at the end of works when the superior
life form, "z" exists; and one uses a "c" only under
duress. Examples are: "I beat way big drumz!" and
"We crashed at the Shak.")

It's OK; you can look now.
My first experience with the Band was SMUT.
(Yeah, it shocked me, too.)
Actually, SMUT stands for Stanford Marching Unit
Thinkers, a name for the high-level planning meetings
that formulate each pre-game show.
I got to the Band Shak about 20 minutes before the
weekly hour of music rehearsal was scheduled to din
out like a flock of fog horns roosting in a sound-proofed
bread box.
My idea was to absorb some color, maybe get a few
details about the Band's environment.
My color receptors are still undergoing pastel treat
ment to rejuvenate my overloaded fluorescent nodes.
The Shak's main room is a mural in musical mess.
The centerpiece is a psychedelic piano with silvery,
reflecting mylar siding and lavender-green stripes and
dots. It rises out of institutional-orange carpeting cov
ered with old sheet music, assymetrical mouth pieces
and foot-wide, tasteless ties.
Under the generous spattering of neon hair color
spray, a ream of suggestive freeway signs hang
precariously plastered to almost any flat surface,
proclaiming messages like, "If you have sick pigs at

home or brought sick or dead pigs for diagnosis please
do not enter this swine barn."
Later, a musician told me that the main characteris
tic of a Band member is his inability to pass a sign with
out wondering how it would look in the Shak.
During my guided tour with Band public relations
man Ed Gresser, I began to distinguish between walls
and floor a little better.
The most interesting stop was Michelob Terrace,
the command center of the Band and storage space for
a canon, a sedan chair, a wheelchair and two pet rats.
When asked, "Why do you keep rats?" someone
said, "Doesn't everyone?" and another voice quipped,
"They're fun to feed beer to."
This inspired another serious musician to offer one
little furry critter a nibble of Drum Major Jim Kohn's
moustache wax which he uses on his hair.
The nest, which is a loft/attic above all the other
rooms, is noted for the bottle target, which is visible
from the floor below and would be an ample source for
glass recycling projects.
"Someone cleans out all the bottles every few
years," said Gresser with a shrug and down the ladder
I went.
Having completed my tourist duties I was promoted

to the post of mugwump, a Band term for the semi
crucial Band members who play cymbal or cowbell.
Because 1 looked musical, or maybe just good at
banging things with a stick, Drum Section Leader Den
nis Ryan entrusted me with a two-toned cowbell.
I assumed that I could choose which note to use. Ac
tually, the odds of one of my two notes matching some
one else at any point in the music were pretty good, I
figured.
After an hour of music rehearsal, Band Manager
Scott Gode announced staff members for next year, in
cluding new Drum Major Andy Switky and introduced a
new verse to the classic Dirty Golden Bear song. The
Band "rehydrated" for the prescribed amount of time
and began to SMUT.
I was wondering why many Band members wore
layers of T-shirts until I witnessed SMUT's rituals.
People with an idea for a show are required to pres
ent it on a blackboard in Michelob Terrace for the as
sembled SMUT participants who, of course, can run up
and tear off the presenter's sacrificial shirt in worship
of Big Face, a crazed happy face painted on the Band
room floor and the subject of a running joke.
For some strange reason, I didn't seem to come up
with any funny plans that night.
SMUT was just the first in a week of activities that
proved the axiom, "Your life is Band. Band is your
life." Altogether, the group staggered through nine
rallies, four practices and Big Game itself, all without
needing to call the paramedics, All State or E.F. Hut
ton.
When the Band rallied at my dorm on Thursday night
I had regained partial hearing, and I think I was devel
oping callouses on my eardrums. My adjustment to the
Band way of life was irreversibly underway, and I was
eager to hop down on the Flo Mo roof and rock out.
I didn't have my cowbells with me so I became des
ignated Coors carrier for a drummer, tagging along
when my section decided to beat matching cadence
down an echoing Paloma stairwell at full stadium
volume.
After that, it seemed that one rally ran into another,
separated only by the raucous cheers on the Band
buses.
I came to when we stepped onto the soft-as-
Charmin Astroturf, and I suddenly needed to remem

ber my position in the pre-game show.
There were too many distractions to worry about
that triviality, though.
A panoramic view of dot-sized fans swarming up to a
baby-blue sky, the jingling of keys in a eulogy to the Cal
Band and my untied shoelace were all legitimate con
cerns.
But run on the field I did, swooping in crazy arcs
with my arms in World War I dogfight formation, and
yes, coming to a perfect one point landing on my por
tion of the "F" in DEFENSE/DEFICIT.
My Jekyll-like transformation entered its final phase
during the game as I banged my cowbells on to new
volumes, screamed cheers I didn't even know and
gloated inwardly over all the mortals in the stands who
would never get within orange-throwing range of the
30-yard line I trampled.
Speaking of oranges, there's some Weenie out there
who owes me one washing of my white overalls.
My first thought when I got hit was that the drum
mer next to me was being sloppy with his stick, until I
looked down at my leg and saw the gory orange
wound.
I freaked way big, to use Band jargon. For the next
two songs I was scanning the Cal crowd for funnelators
or whimpering courageous lines to myself. "No, I'll be

all right. You go on and take the Axe without me. It's
just a little citrus wound. So what if I can never mug
wump again?"
I made it through the game, although there were
other casualties. The drum section's "coffin, " a drum
case carrying its supply of rehvdrators, was comman
deered by a few thirsty stadium police.
The Band makes many such sacrifices. This year
was more draining than most according to Kohn be
cause there were nine shows to SMUT rather than the
usual six or seven.
Bass drummer Arne Lang-Ree felt the effects of this
extra load by wearing out two pairs of leather batting
practice gloves in a season pounding out the beat that
is politely called the metronome of the Band.
(It's a metronome that could wake up Palo Alto on a
clear day from the Shak.)
After the final playing of "All Right Now," the season
was over and the Band prepared for its culminating cat
hartic ritual... the Grovel.
Band members Groveled — that is destroyed — all
unprotected Band Shak debris including an old
refrigerator, a brick wall built specifically for the
Grovel mayhem and a window that looked too much
like an innocent bystander.
Some Band members flee the Grovel annually; I
liked the two minutes of it that I watched before duck
ing a brick and riding my dented bike home.
How could they leave the campus quiet and idyllic for
a year without this final act of irreverence?

and foot-wide, tasteless ties.
Under the generous spattering of neon hair color
spray, a ream of suggestive freeway signs hang
precariously plastered to almost any flat surface,
proclaiming messages like, "If you have sick pigs at

home or brought sick or dead pigs for diagnosis please
do not enter this swine barn."
Later, a musician told me that the main characteris
tic of a Band member is his inability to pass a sign with
out wondering how it would look in the Shak.
During my guided tour with Band public relations
man Ed Gresser, I began to distinguish between walls
and floor a little better.
The most interesting stop was Michelob Terrace,
the command center of the Band and storage space for
a canon, a sedan chair, a wheelchair and two pet rats.
When asked, "Why do you keep rats?" someone
said, "Doesn't everyone?" and another voice quipped,
"They're fun to feed beer to."
This inspired another serious musician to offer one
little furry critter a nibble of Drum Major Jim Kohn's
moustache wax which he uses on his hair.
The nest, which is a loft/attic above all the other
rooms, is noted for the bottle target, which is visible
from the floor below and would be an ample source for
glass recycling projects.
"Someone cleans out all the bottles every few
years," said Gresser with a shrug and down the ladder
I went.
Having completed my tourist duties I was promoted

to the post of mugwump, a Band term for the semi
crucial Band members who play cymbal or cowbell.
Because 1 looked musical, or maybe just good at
banging things with a stick, Drum Section Leader Den
nis Ryan entrusted me with a two-toned cowbell.
I assumed that I could choose which note to use. Ac
tually, the odds of one of my two notes matching some
one else at any point in the music were pretty good, I
figured.
After an hour of music rehearsal, Band Manager
Scott Gode announced staff members for next year, in
cluding new Drum Major Andy Switky and introduced a
new verse to the classic Dirty Golden Bear song. The
Band "rehydrated" for the prescribed amount of time
and began to SMUT.
I was wondering why many Band members wore
layers of T-shirts until I witnessed SMUT's rituals.
People with an idea for a show are required to pres
ent it on a blackboard in Michelob Terrace for the as
sembled SMUT participants who, of course, can run up
and tear off the presenter's sacrificial shirt in worship
of Big Face, a crazed happy face painted on the Band
room floor and the subject of a running joke.
For some strange reason, I didn't seem to come up
with any funny plans that night.
SMUT was just the first in a week of activities that
proved the axiom, "Your life is Band. Band is your
life." Altogether, the group staggered through nine
rallies, four practices and Big Game itself, all without
needing to call the paramedics, All State or E.F. Hut
ton.
When the Band rallied at my dorm on Thursday night
I had regained partial hearing, and I think I was devel
oping callouses on my eardrums. My adjustment to the
Band way of life was irreversibly underway, and I was
eager to hop down on the Flo Mo roof and rock out.
I didn't have my cowbells with me so I became des
ignated Coors carrier for a drummer, tagging along
when my section decided to beat matching cadence
down an echoing Paloma stairwell at full stadium
volume.
After that, it seemed that one rally ran into another,
separated only by the raucous cheers on the Band
buses.
I came to when we stepped onto the soft-as-
Charmin Astroturf, and I suddenly needed to remem

ber my position in the pre-game show.
There were too many distractions to worry about
that triviality, though.
A panoramic view of dot-sized fans swarming up to a
baby-blue sky, the jingling of keys in a eulogy to the Cal
Band and my untied shoelace were all legitimate con
cerns.
But run on the field I did, swooping in crazy arcs
with my arms in World War I dogfight formation, and
yes, coming to a perfect one point landing on my por
tion of the "F" in DEFENSE/DEFICIT.
My Jekyll-like transformation entered its final phase
during the game as I banged my cowbells on to new
volumes, screamed cheers I didn't even know and
gloated inwardly over all the mortals in the stands who
would never get within orange-throwing range of the
30-yard line I trampled.
Speaking of oranges, there's some Weenie out there
who owes me one washing of my white overalls.
My first thought when I got hit was that the drum
mer next to me was being sloppy with his stick, until I
looked down at my leg and saw the gory orange
wound.
I freaked way big, to use Band jargon. For the next
two songs I was scanning the Cal crowd for funnelators
or whimpering courageous lines to myself. "No, I'll be

all right. You go on and take the Axe without me. It's
just a little citrus wound. So what if I can never mug
wump again?"
I made it through the game, although there were
other casualties. The drum section's "coffin, " a drum
case carrying its supply of rehvdrators, was comman
deered by a few thirsty stadium police.
The Band makes many such sacrifices. This year
was more draining than most according to Kohn be
cause there were nine shows to SMUT rather than the
usual six or seven.
Bass drummer Arne Lang-Ree felt the effects of this
extra load by wearing out two pairs of leather batting
practice gloves in a season pounding out the beat that
is politely called the metronome of the Band.
(It's a metronome that could wake up Palo Alto on a
clear day from the Shak.)
After the final playing of "All Right Now," the season
was over and the Band prepared for its culminating cat
hartic ritual... the Grovel.
Band members Groveled — that is destroyed — all
unprotected Band Shak debris including an old
refrigerator, a brick wall built specifically for the
Grovel mayhem and a window that looked too much
like an innocent bystander.
Some Band members flee the Grovel annually; I
liked the two minutes of it that I watched before duck
ing a brick and riding my dented bike home.
How could they leave the campus quiet and idyllic for
a year without this final act of irreverence?

(To get a different view of last year's Big Game be
tween Stanford and the University of California at
Berkeley, then-Daily staff writer Marilyn Wann joined
the Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band.
The following is an account of her week-long stint in the
Band, culminating in Cal's 27-10 defeat to the Card
inal. Wann is currently The Daily's features editor.)

Reader alert! I'm giving fair warning. It's time for
yet another Big Game story rehashing all those tradi
tional axioms, attacks and rude acts.
Some of you probably won't read any further. After
all, Cal students have once again earned the proud
name of weenie and the turkey mortality rate is soaring
like no flightless bird ever could without a gutbusting
holiday in the wings.
So for the discerning reader who has stayed with me
this far into the third paragraph, I'm offering a cash
reward. (Ha! Got your hopes up, no?)
The prize isn't a trip for two to sunny South Dakota
or the Amana Radarange behind door number three but
something rare and precious, something akin to knowl
edge of the great mysteries of life — like the real
meanings behind those obscure Stanford acronyms,
the true color of Cyndi Lauper's hair and the number of
Cliff s Notes consumed by the average freshman each
quarter.
Listen my readers and you shall hear the eyewitness
account of life in the Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band as told by a daring outsider who
tempted fate and returned after a week in the musical
underworld (i.e., the Band Shak) with a normally func
tioning liver.
All right, so it was me. Everything but the heroic
parts are still true, though. I joined the Band and am
willing to tell all. But before I recount the week's
revelry, I need to leave a note for my editors. You
night want to look away for this part; it could get em
barrassing.
(Don't think I've had a mental melt-down just be
cause some of my spelling don't conform with ... a
moment of respectful silence ... the AP Stylebook.
When in the Band, one does not leave messy letters
like "s" dangling at the end of works when the superior
life form, "z" exists; and one uses a "c" only under
duress. Examples are: "I beat way big drumz!" and
"We crashed at the Shak.")

It's OK; you can look now.
My first experience with the Band was SMUT.
(Yeah, it shocked me, too.)
Actually, SMUT stands for Stanford Marching Unit
Thinkers, a name for the high-level planning meetings
that formulate each pre-game show.
I got to the Band Shak about 20 minutes before the
weekly hour of music rehearsal was scheduled to din
out like a flock of fog horns roosting in a sound-proofed
bread box.
My idea was to absorb some color, maybe get a few
details about the Band's environment.
My color receptors are still undergoing pastel treat
ment to rejuvenate my overloaded fluorescent nodes.
The Shak's main room is a mural in musical mess.
The centerpiece is a psychedelic piano with silvery,
reflecting mylar siding and lavender-green stripes and
dots. It rises out of institutional-orange carpeting cov
ered with old sheet music, assymetrical mouth pieces
and foot-wide, tasteless ties.
Under the generous spattering of neon hair color
spray, a ream of suggestive freeway signs hang
precariously plastered to almost any flat surface,

home or brought sick or dead pigs for diagnosis please
do not enter this swine barn."

I didn't have my cowbells with me so I became des
ignated Coors carrier for a drummer, tagging along
when my section decided to beat matching cadence
down an echoing Paloma stairwell at full stadium
volume.
After that, it seemed that one rally ran into another,
separated only by the raucous cheers on the Band
buses.
I came to when we stepped onto the soft-as-
Charmin Astroturf, and I suddenly needed to remem

ber my position in the pre-game show.
There were too many distractions to worry about
that triviality, though.
A panoramic view of dot-sized fans swarming up to a
baby-blue sky, the jingling of keys in a eulogy to the Cal
Band and my untied shoelace were all legitimate con
cerns.
But run on the field I did, swooping in crazy arcs
with my arms in World War I dogfight formation, and
yes, coming to a perfect one point landing on my por
tion of the "F" in DEFENSE/DEFICIT.
My Jekyll-like transformation entered its final phase
during the game as I banged my cowbells on to new
volumes, screamed cheers I didn't even know and
gloated inwardly over all the mortals in the stands who
would never get within orange-throwing range of the
30-yard line I trampled.
Speaking of oranges, there's some Weenie out there
who owes me one washing of my white overalls.
My first thought when I got hit was that the drum
mer next to me was being sloppy with his stick, until I
looked down at my leg and saw the gory orange
wound.
I freaked way big, to use Band jargon. For the next
two songs I was scanning the Cal crowd for funnelators
or whimpering courageous lines to myself. "No, I'll be

all right. You go on and take the Axe without me. It's
just a little citrus wound. So what if I can never mug
wump again?"
I made it through the game, although there were
other casualties. The drum section's "coffin, " a drum
case carrying its supply of rehvdrators, was comman
deered by a few thirsty stadium police.
The Band makes many such sacrifices. This year
was more draining than most according to Kohn be
cause there were nine shows to SMUT rather than the
usual six or seven.
Bass drummer Arne Lang-Ree felt the effects of this
extra load by wearing out two pairs of leather batting
practice gloves in a season pounding out the beat that
is politely called the metronome of the Band.
(It's a metronome that could wake up Palo Alto on a
clear day from the Shak.)
After the final playing of "All Right Now," the season
was over and the Band prepared for its culminating cat
hartic ritual... the Grovel.
Band members Groveled — that is destroyed — all
unprotected Band Shak debris including an old
refrigerator, a brick wall built specifically for the
Grovel mayhem and a window that looked too much
like an innocent bystander.
Some Band members flee the Grovel annually; I
liked the two minutes of it that I watched before duck
ing a brick and riding my dented bike home.
How could they leave the campus quiet and idyllic for
a year without this final act of irreverence?
