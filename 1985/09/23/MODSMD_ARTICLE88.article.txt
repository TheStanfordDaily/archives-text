I NK STANFORD DAILY

Monday. September 23, 1985

16. Bagging
Rays
No Dorothy, this is not
Kansas. This is California —
the land of bronzed beauties.
Some stereotypes never die.
It you sport the savage tan,
well then, you have arrived.
And your friends at that
school in Boston will cringe
when you come home
Christmas Break looking like
you've been to St. Tropez
No, you'll tell them, it was
just Wilbur Beach.

20. Lake Lag
In the fall it's a muddy ditch,
but in the spring it
transforms magically into a
tranquil lake. Perfect for
taking walks around, taking
picnics to. Sailing and
windsurfing are must-tries.

51
A Class Act
Ten classes that bring applause every time.
I
Food Glorious Food
True confessions of a restaurant addict.
WW if
57
I City Heat
I Where to go ;ind what to do for a hot time in the city

18. The |
Bicycle

The way to get around
campus. There are more of
them here than Mr. Schwinn
ever dreamed of. Your bike
is your constant companion.
Some students have been
known to name theirs . . .
Wally the Raleigh? Try to
keep it in one piece; some
say you are destined to three
collisions in four years here.

19. The
Domino's Man
If he/she isn't here within 30
minutes of your call, then
you may win a free pizza.
But more likely than not,
he/she will arrive on time,
carrying the aroma of sizzling
cheese and pepperoni.
Abbondanza!

17. FroYo at the CoPo
Not just another Stanford acronym — it's a way of life.
This stuff is great; even better with crunchy toppings. A
perfect study break. Favorite flavors are chocolate,
peanut butter, mocha, berry.
