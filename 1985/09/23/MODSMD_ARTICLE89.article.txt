# Get Psyched for 10 Raved About Classes
## 
### 
Your academic adviser may tell you to fill your eight
area requirements quickly, and you may decide instead
to delve immediately into your own particular area of
study.
But whatever classes you opt to take, do not over
look the 10 courses on the following list. Most are uni
versally popular. All are unique and memorable.
Psychology 001: General Psychology. Philip
Zimbardo. One of the most popular courses on
campus, this introductory class is particularly
renowned for its innovative grading policy — and Zim
bardo's mass hypnosis demonstrations.
Art 001: Introduction to Art. Lorenz Eitner.
This topical introductory course is a popular fall quarter
class. History and appreciation of architecture,
sculpture and painting is stressed, and students intend
ing to enroll in any other art history courses should
plan to take this one first.
Political Science 35: How Nations Deal With
Each Other. Stephen Krasner. For the ambitious
student new to Stanford, this political science course is
an excellent choice. The subject of world politics is ex

amined through a variety of approaches, including
realism, idealism, Marxism and bureaucratic politics.
Krasner is bold and provocative with his comments,
making this a no-miss class — albeit with a good deal of
work.
Civil Engineering 170: Environment, Science
and Technology. Gil Masters. A tremendously
popular, non-technical introduction to the causes and
effects of environmental pollution. The course covers
issues such as over-population and food distribution
that prospective international relations and political sci
ence majors might enjoy studying from a scientific per
spective.
English 173: Shakespeare. Ronald Rebholz.
Even if you took Shakespeare in high school, this class
is worth a repeat performance. Rebholz has earned a
reputation as a colorful and opinionated lecturer who
brings new insight to your understanding of the Bard.
Shakespeare courses covering different plays are of
fered each quarter, with Rebholz teaching only one of
them per year. Readings of selected scenes are sched
uled at the end of each week. Take this class even if
you've read some of the plays before.

Political Science 001: Major Issues of American
Public Policy. Hubert Marshall. Marshall's
dynamic lecturing style, his insights on the Vietnam
War and his accessibility combine to make this a "must"
class. Be prepared to do lots of reading, including a
large amount of Alexis de Tocqueville. But also be
prepared to learn a great deal about poverty,
monopolies, foreign policy and the distribution of
power in American politics and the economy.
Sociology 109: The Criminal Law and the Crim
inal System. John Kaplan. Kaplan's casual wit and
the course's interesting subject matter make this a fa
vorite. When Newsweek On Campus included Crim
Law in its list of the nation's top "micks," or easy
courses, Kaplan offered an angry response, and the
class became a controversial one overnight. Granted,
the lecture notes, fairly light reading load and multiple
choice tests do not hurt, but there's a lot of learning to
be had in a fascinating area.
Values, Technology and Society 101: Contem
porary Technological Society. Donald Jordan.
This course is an interdisciplinary survey of social, cul
tural and values issues concerning society of the '80s.

The section discussions about issues — ones you might
not have even realized were worth discussing — such as
test tube babies, the Concorde jet and snowmobiles —
are particularly enlightening. The reading load is
average, but more time-consuming is the preparation
for a 10-minute speech as part of a debate.
Athletics, Physical Education and Recreation
56: Windsurfing. Joseph Petrucci. Spring quarter
at Stanford is the time to get outside and experience af
ternoons on Lake Lag. What better way to do it than
California style? Many students here would tell you not
to leave the Farm without learning how to windsurf.
The only problem is that there are more than 5,000 un
dergraduates here and lots of them want to learn to sail
on a surfboard, so sign up early if you want to become a
Stanford cliche.
Political Science 138 A: Arms Control and Dis
armament. Coit Blacker and John Lewis. This
course, taught by interdisciplinary faculty and en
livened by guest lecturers from Washington, is com
prehensive and thought-provoking, although you will
probably spend not a few hours memorizing military
facts and acronyms.
