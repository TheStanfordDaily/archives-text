## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Editor's Welcome 
### 
The mayor of my home town, Denver's Federico
Pena, kicked off his successful 1983 campaign with a
challenge many Coloradans have since taken to
heart: "Imagine a great city."
It wasn't that Pena, a veteran of Colorado politics
and longtime Denver resident, thought his city was
such a bad place. On the contrary, he had staked
much of his personal and political career on his affec
tion for Colorado and its people.
But no matter how good Denver was, Pena
believed it could be better — if only he could give
people, especially those new to the community, a
chance to bring out the best in themselves.
On an admittedly different scale, but with much
the same spirit, I challenge this university to imag
ine a great independent student newspaper.
"Independent" because The Daily is just that — a
private corporation where more than 100 writers,
editors, photographers and advertising representa
tives have discovered that the freedom to do things
your own way is what keeps this 93-year-old institu
tion alive.
"Students" because that's who we are, and who
we try to serve. As students, our time at Stanford is
limited, which makes it that much more valuable. So
if you feel you'd like to make a contribution to The
Daily — whether that contribution be 50 minutes or
50 hours a week — there's a place for you here.
Students have been known to swap stories about
the silly mistakes The Daily has made over the
years. Many of those stories are funny, and some of
them are true. What's not so funny is to watch the

same people complain about The Daily year after
year, while doing nothing to make it better. A stu
dent newspaper is for all the students. If you don't
like something we're doing, if you think you could do
it better, come over and help, or at least give us
your ideas. I can't promise your help will put an end
to silly mistakes. I can promise you'll enjoy working
here, and that your work, at its very best, will lend
something good to the life of a community we
cherish.
The morning after Federico Pena's election, the
citizens of Denver awoke to the same problems of
the day before. But as with all new beginnings,
there was a sense of opportunity — a chance to
channel the creativity and enthusiasm of an entire
city to the building of something that could make us
proud. And maybe that city, that Denver, would still
have crime and traffic jams and air pollution, just like
any other city. But it would be our city, and we
could make of it what we wanted. And when the
dust settled, the beauty of the good things we
created ana tried to create would be a reflection of
us and of no one else.
The Daily can be a great student newspaper, be
cause The Daily — like everything great about Stan
ford — is you. We're ready to go forward. Whether
or not we will is up to you.
