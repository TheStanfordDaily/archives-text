" There's nowhere like
Berzerkeley!' " students of the
University of California at Berkeley
exclaim laughingly as they weave
their way down Telegraph Avenue.
By almost any measure,
Berkeley's reputation is well
known — and well-deserved. The
streets, including Telegraph, the
city's central thoroughfare, are
painted with a certain amount of
"human color," some of it psyc
hedelic.
For starters, the "Red Man" can
be seen virtually any day parading
through the Berkeley streets,
dressed from head to toe in a vi
brant shade of scarlet, carrying on
his back a stuffed puppet the size of
an infant.
"Crazy William" is rumored to
have been a philosophy graduate
student who "went over the edge."
He painted his clothes and face with
dollar-size red polka dots and now
camps out on Telegraph, making
faces at people and drawing atten
tion to himself any way he can.
"You have to be normal to stand
out at Berkeley," many freshman
are told, and despite the large stu
dent population, some undoubtedly
find this the case.
Berkeley is still a mecca for poli
tical demonstrators and activists.
Few causes seem to go unnoticed.
Supporters of everything — from the
nuclear freeze to complete divest
ment of UC investments from com
panies that do business in South
Africa — establish themselves in
Sproul Plaza, the focal point of the

Cal campus. During the late morn
ing and early afternoon, it is difficult
to cross this stretch of pavement
without being asked to sign any
number of political petitions.
Although many of those new to
the area may find this process in
timidating, the majority of students
tend to develop "defense tactics" to
ward off the more adamant demon
strators. Clutching textbooks and
notepads, students can be seen
with heads bent and eyes focused
firmly on the ground in front of
them as they stride quickly through
a crowd of petition-bearing ac
tivists.
The majority of those persons of
ten considered "unusual" are
probably harmless, provided they
are not provoked. Just to make
sure, residents offer visiting out
siders a safety tip:
Whatever you do or see, always
avoid eye contact!
Eat the Weenies
For all their faults, there is at
least one thing Berkeley residents
do right: make good food. Since the
arrival of Alice Waters, the owner
of the world-famous Chez Pan
nisse, Berkeley has blossomed with
quality eateries of every shape and
ethnic origin.
Some claim Berkeley's good eats
can be traced to all those '60s radi
cals who realized at some point that
they had to make a living; years of
preparing organic food finally came
in handy. Whether or not this is ac

tually the source of the local cuisine
revolution, fresh ingredients and an
innovative attitude are common to
every respected restaurant in the
area.
Even if you only stay in Berkeley
long enough to want to go home,
you are going to have to eat at
some time.
If you want to risk going to one of
the student hangouts, try Kip's or
Larry Blakes, both within a few
blocks of Sproul Plaza. For a stu
dent bar check into Henry's or
Spatz.
From Morning 'til Evening
Going out to breakfast has
become an art in the land of the

Golden Bear. Places like Bette's
Ocean View Diner and the Butter
cup Bakery serve complete break
fasts with various omelettes and
high-quality pastries. And, if you
have the time to sit down, you
might try Ramona's, but remember
that this restaurant has no connec
tions to its Palo Alto namesake.
The brunch menu includes egg
specialties, including Eggs Benedict
($6.50). Less expensive are
omelettes, which start at $3.75 and
are served with homefries and your
choice of bread or pastry. If you
want authentic Chicago-style pizza
and it's after 11:30 a.m., you're in
luck. Ramona's has an original rec
ipe that is its claim to fame.
Lunch and dinner open up a

who!? range of possibilities. If you
like Mexican food and places with
atmosphere, Carlos Murphy's »£
conveniently located right off the
freeway at the Emeryville exit, just
as you approach Berkeley. Carlos
Murphy's has a beautiful view of the
Bay and San Francisco and takes its
name from its theme; it's an Irish-
Mexican cafe. The decor and menu
reflect this zany idea. About one
third of the restaurant is devoted to
an extremely active bar.
King Tsin is possibly the oldest
and most successful of Berkeley's
Chinese restaurants. Don't be
fooled by the snazzy facade; that
just went up about three years ago.
The same man has stood at the reg
ister for years, and yes, he really

does use the abacus on the counter
to check his addition. King Tsin is
on Solano Avenue, among many
other Eastern restaurants; if you
can't get a table right away, you
have plenty of other choices within
walking distance.
Coffee Break
In the home city of Peets Coffee,
cafes abound. Cafe Roma, the old
standby on College and Durant, is
being challenged by the up-and
coming Old Blue Cafe, which also
features dessert. There are out
door tables at both places, so
you're never too far from Red Man
and Crazy William.
