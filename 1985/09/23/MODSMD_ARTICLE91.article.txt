# Eat, Drink, Be Merry — off the Farm
## Local restaurants can cure dorm food blues Farm Away From Farm 
### 
Stanford hangouts change from
year to year, of course, and I'm
sure the newest ones have escaped
my attention, but there are old
standards. Half the people in
Ramona's (541 Ramona St., Palo
Alto) on any given weekend night
will be from Stanford: the Stanford
crush is particularly intense before
and after basketball games. Most of
them will be eating the second-best
pizza in the area — I'll tell you about
the best a little later — while those
who want to be different chew on
calzone or decent hamburgers. The
once-great Ramona's salad bar
maintains only a shade of its former
glory. Down the street at the Good
Earth Restaurant (185 University
Ave., Palo Alto) you'll find a differ

ent, slightly older, Stanford crowd
eating chic health food. Of course,
hangouts in the true Stanford sense
of the word are places you go to
swill beer, and there are a couple of
those: The Dutch Goose (3567
Alameda deals Pulgas, Menlo
Park), a functional sort of place
where there's standing room only
on Senior Pub Nights, and The
Oasts Beer Garden (241 El Camino
Real, Menlo Park), a downright
ugly place that has been witness to
untold decades of Stanford history.
Two things you have to know: refer
to them as "the Goose" and"the 0"
respectively: and rest assured that
you will be carded at both establish
ments. If you like your nightlife a bit
rowdier, try St. James Infirmary
(390 Moffet Blvd., Mountain View)
or Antonio's Nut House (321 Cali
fornia Ave., Palo Alto), places
where you can get into a fight if you
try hard enough. In recent years an
attempt has been made to turn The
Lancashire Tavern (547 Emerson

St., Palo Alto) into a Stanford hang
out of the pub night variety, but it
doesn't seem to have fully caught
on. A morning alternative: the

brunch crowd at
Hobee's. And
don't forget the
New Varsity, (456
University Ave.,
Palo Alto), espe
cially when the
theater is showing
Woody Allen
movies.
Frank ie,
Johnnie & Luigi
Too (939 El
Camino Real,
Mountain View)
has no peer in
pizza; what it
does have are 45-
minute-to-an-hour

waits on weekends, which can fly
by if enough of you go and if you
drink enough while waiting (if you
look 21. you'll be accosted by a

roving cocktail waitress the minute
you sign in). Try the fresh-tomato
and-garlic pizza, a house specialty,
and avoid the Italian dinners, which

are often dread
ful. Ramona's is a
distant second to
FJ&L, followed
by the pizza with
barbecue sauce
(ladled on in place
of tomato sauce)
at Jose's (2275 El
Camino Real, Palo
Alto).
This may not
seem like a rele
vant category for
The Daily, but
I've seen more
than my share of
students (MBA
and otherwise) in

these places:
42nd, Street (518 Bryant St., Palo
Alto, in the alley between Bryant
and Ramona) is either a dream

come true or a nightmare made
real, depending on your point of
view. It's an expensively tacky
meat market with great sight lines,
where you'll find a variety of
hunters: tables of frightened
looking Stanford students, Palo
Alto nouveau riche and lots of sec
retaries. The action is much more
serious at the British Bankers Club
(1090 El Camino Real, Menlo
Park), which draws an older, richer
crowd (it goes in and out of fashion
as a business school hangout) to its
fake Edwardian digs. Coming on
strong in recent years has been
Mac Arthur Park (27 University
Ave., Palo Alto, next to the train
station), a favorite of young profes
sional types. Style is everything in a
yuppie hangout, and Mac Arthur
Park has one of the approved
styles: big, open, white-painted
spaces, wood floor, railings
everywhere. The food ranges from
mediocre to bad (be sure to order
something from the grill), but what

does it matter when you can get
potato skins and eight wines by the
glass? Another style is represented
by Waverley Place (560 Waveriey
St., Palo Alto), relatively new to
downtown Palo Alto, which is all
glass and bleached wood and ex
pensive (but surprisingly good)
pastas and seafood dishes. You can
get a young Lafite Rothschild or
Chateau Petrus, but there won't be
anything worth drinking for under
$20. Along with these upstarts, a
couple of established Palo Alto res
taurants have swung with the
times: The Gatehouse (265 Lytton
Ave.), one of Palo Alto's prettiest
places to eat and drink, is taken
over by the young after the dinner
hour, and Henry's (482 University
Ave.) is a favorite with the local ad
vertising/design community that
lives off Silicon Valley. There's also
Chili's Hamburger Grill & Bar
(700 El Camino Real, Menlo Park).

Toasts
Of
The
Town
I'm concerned here with the bar
as a comfortable environment in
which to drink, as opposed to a sup
portive environment in which to get
drunk (or find your soulmate).
The Gatehouse (265 Lytton Ave.,
Palo Alto) is a snitzy restaurant by
day and a snitzy bar by night, and
one of the nicest places to sit
around in Palo Alto. The bar at
Mama's (379 Stanford Shopping
Center) is a bit out of the way, but
it has a certain hushed elegance
that makes it attractive. Henry's
(482 University Ave., Palo Alto) is
hot and crowded once the dinner
customers clear out, but there's no
one on the make; just lots of suc
cessful young Palo Altans hanging
out in one of their favorite bars. An
other bar that has a "scene, " but
isn't quite a singles bar, is that of
the New Varsity (456 University

Ave., Palo Alto). Videos play above
the bar, musicians play in the court
yard, and lots of Paly High blondes
and assorted Palo Alto punks hang
around out front. It's noisy and
crowded and uncomfortable on the
weekends, but the people watching
is great. If you're looking for some
thing a little more staid, try the bar
at the rear of the London House
(630 Ramona St., Palo Alto), a
loving re-creation of an English pub
where you can get most any British
beer you want, pub snacks and a
game of darts.
Candles
And
Bay
Lights
Everyone has his own idea of the
perfect surroundings in which to let
love flower, but each of the follow
ing places is romantic in its own
way. Bella Vista (13451 Skyline
Blvd., Woodside) has, as you might
expect, a gorgeous view; it nestles
in the redwoods atop the Skyline
ridge, and if you're lucky you'll get a
candlelit table by the window that
looks out over the bay. Tuxedoed

waiters and picturesque locals in
Jaguars complete the picture. St.
Michael's Alley (800 Emerson St.,
Palo Alto) is a little crowded and a
little noisy, but it has an air of so
phistication unusual in Palo Alto, to
go with its eclectic continental
menu (you'll eat as well here as
anywhere in town). Sundance Mine

Company (1921 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto) isn't to everyone's taste;
it has an unimaginative steak-and
seafood menu, it's overpriced, and
it takes itself awfully seriously. But
we're talking atmosphere here, and
if you're in the right feeling-like-an
adult mood, Sundance, with its
state-of-the-art green/brown

wood/cut-glass interior, has it to
burn. And many a Stanford couple
holds fond memories of Flea Street
Cafe (3607 Alameda de las Pulgas,
Menlo Park, two doors from the
Dutch Goose) a low-key little place
with excellent avant-veggie food.
Without going into too much
detail, there are two local French

restaurants that come close to
meeting the bistro ideal (good food,
relatively low prices); Le Pot au
Feu (1149 El Camino Real. Menlo
Park) and A La Carte Restaurant
Francois (2310 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto). Somewhat more formal,
but still affordable, are Pear Wil
liams Restaurant Francais (150
Middlefield Road, Menlo Park) and
Chez Louis (4170 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto). Most of the other
nearby French restaurants suffer
from some combination of preten
tiousness, over-pricing, bad service
and just plain poor food.
Chinese,
Mexican,
German,
Japanese
It's the familiar refrain: How about
Chinese? How about Mexican? And
it's easy to fall into around here, be
cause there are more ethnic restau
rants than you can shake a burrito
or a potsticker at. Most of them are
bad as you'd expect; here are a few
of the good ones:

Generations of Stanfordites have
fallen in love with the mu shu pork
at Chef Chu's (1067 North San An
tonio Road at El Camino Real, Los
Altos). This always crowded Man
darin restaurant prepares perfectly
solid, unexciting dishes — it's the

ideal place for large groups with
diverse tastes. The food's more ex
citing at China First (675 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto), another
place with a large reputation. The
cuisine here is Szechwan/Hunan, al
beit not that spicy, and there are
great dishes on the menu; if you go
in looking like students, you may
have to put up with the waiter sniff
ing at you.
On a more modest scale, there
are two worthwhile Chinese places
in Menlo Park: Yuen Yung (639
Santa Cruz Ave.) and Su Hong
(1039 El Camino Real). Both are

eclectic, but primarily Can
tonese/Mandarin. Su Hong has bet
ter food, Yuen Yung more interest
ing decor — it looks like a cross be
tween a Chinese restaurant and a
fern bar.
Just blocks away from the center
of Northern California's illicit
wholesale drug trade is an excellent
Mexican restaurant, La Fortuna
(3180 Middlefield Road, Redwood
City). Around the corner is Rosita's

Taqueria (171 A sth Ave., Red
wood City), which has the best bur
ritos around. Estrellita (971 North
San Antonio Road, Los Altos) isn't
what it used to be, but it still has
great chimichangas. There are two
passable family-type Mexican joints
in Menlo Park: La Luna Mexican
Cafe (137 Chestnut St.) and Caleta
(1143 D Crane St.). If you don't
mind a drive, the best Latin restau
rant around is probably El Calderon
(699 El Calderon Ave., Mountain
View), which is hidden away in a
small shopping center and has a
Mexican/Salvadoran menu.

The only German restaurant
anywhere near campus is the Black
Forest Inn (376 First St., Los
Altos). Meals are prepared rather
indifferently, but if you just have to
have some weinerschnitzel with red
cabbage and potato pancakes, this
is the place to go.
Fuki-sushi (4119 El Camino
Real, Palo Alto) has both a sushi bar
and a robata bar, and is a swank,
full-service Japanese restaurant to
boot. An hour at the sushi bar will
cost you what you've always heard
sushi costs. Ten-ichi Tempura (925
El Camino Real, Menlo Park) isn't
as fancy, but the sushi is just as
good and a fair bit cheaper.
Breakfast
Out
Of
Bed
Morning eaters are lucky here —
Palo Alto and Menlo Park have a
plethora of good restaurants that
specialize in breakfast and lunch.
First among equals is Late for the
Train (561 Oak Grove Ave., Menlo
Park, near the train station), a
folksy place that makes great
omelettes, divine blintzes and fruit
pancakes and the usual salads and
sandwiches, plus ever-changing
desserts. If you go on a weekend,
particularly a Sunday, expect at
least a 45-minute wait; it's best, if
you can, to go for an early or late
weekday lunch, when you are often
seated immediately. Modeled along
much the same lines is Hobee's
Haven (442 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto, in Town and Country Village),
a family operation with more
branches down the peninsula.
Hobee's follows more traditional
American breakfast lines — sausage,
eggs, ham — but isn't lacking for
fresh-squeezed juices, fruit and
other California trimmings, and it
has a truly addictive coffee cake
that comes with most of the break
fasts. The Farmer's Market (448
California Ave., Palo Alto) has a
small menu, spotty service (semi
cafeteria style) and the ambiance of
a butcher shop, but it serves great
breakfasts (try the apple pancakes

or a ham-swiss-apple omelette) at
amazingly low prices. (The latter
isn't always true on weekends
when you may find yourself order
ing a "brunch" at inflated prices.)
Finally, there's the favorite morn
ing meeting spot of Stanford
sororities: Dinah's Poolside Coffee
Shop (4269 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto; not to be confused with
Dinah's Shack, a mediocre restau
rant next door), which many people
feel has the best omelettes in the
area.
Quiche
And
California
Chic
After fondue and before pesto,
there was quiche. The Perfect Rec
ipe (76 Stanford Shopping Center)
still serves forgotten victim of the
gourmet wars, along with cutesy
sandwiches and good coffee; a dif
ferent quiche is served every day,
and you can count on a flakey crust
and perfect consistency. They don't
serve white wine, but you can still
dig your clogs out of the closet and
pretend Stanford is a shoo-in for a
bowl game (which last happened at
about the height of the quiche
craze).
There are no restaurants in the
vicinity of campus that could be
called innovative, but there are
some with Berkeley-gourmet trap
pings. Fresco (3398 El Camino
Real, Palo Alto) is a corporate ver
sion of the California ideal (it's run
by the Mac Arthur Park/Prego/Ciao
combine), serving pastas and grilled
fish cooked with various combina
tions of sun-dried tomatos, basil
and red peppers, along with
composed salads and the obligatory
grilled meats (lamb and steak). It's
a pleasant, reasonably priced place
with perfectly well-prepared, but
boring, food. Smaller and chicer is
Theo's (546 University Ave., Palo
Alto), which has a more conserva
tive, steakhouse type of menu but a
better wine list (wine being the all
important item in this type of res
taurant).

In
Search
Of
Barbecue
The true barbecue experience is
unavailable in this area; the nearest

worthwhile sauce is in South San
Francisco. Mac Arthur Park has
decent ribs (the ribs are one of the
few things worth eating there) cov
ered with a tame, ketchup
dominated sauce. If you want real
barbecue ambiance, thought, go to
Goldie's Oakwood Bar-B-Que
(1940 C University Ave., East Palo
Alto — bear left before the freeway),
a storefront operation in Whiskey
Gulch. Goldie's confronts the public
with a bare, whitewashed room
holding two formica tables and a
cooler. In the far wall there's a hole
through which you order your pork
or beef ribs, chicken or links. You
can get an order or a sandwich
(about half the size of an order).
Both will come with white bread
wrapped in plastic and your choice
of baked beans or coleslaw. The
sauce here is the real thing, but it's

awfully mild; there's no reason not
to order it hot.
From
Sea
And
Streams
The Fish Market (3150 El Camino
Real, Palo Alto) has long been Palo
Alto's most popular spot for
seafood, and it generally deserves
to be. It was way ahead of the
mesquite-grill, fresh-special game,
and the high school kids who do the
grilling get it right most of the time.
There's also friendly, informal ser
vice from an army of T-shirt-clad
young waitresses. The lines can be
long on weekends, but there's an
outdoor patio, drinks while you
wait, and an oyster-seafood cocktail
bar to help pass the time. Scott's
Seafood Bar & Grill (2300 East
Bayshore at Embarcadero, Palo
Alto) has given The Fish Market a
run for its money since opening five
years ago, but it's attractive mainly
as a place to be seen; the fish is
overcooked about half the time, the
service can be shoddy, and the
prices are way out of line.
Battle
Of
The
Burgers
Kirk's (361 California Ave., Palo
Alto) has great hamburgers, but
they're not for the faint-hearted.
Ask for your steakburger well-done
if you don't want it raw. The
burgers at Kirk's are cooked over a
charcoal grill while you wait; there's
nothing else to eat but potato chips
and some packaged salads, but this
is a small point when you're getting
one of the last real hamburgers. A
close second in the hamburger
derby is the Alpine. Beer Garden
(3915 Alpine Road, Portola Valley),
also known as the Alpine Inn or as
Rosotti's or, most commonly, as
Zott's.


Stanford hangouts change from
year to year, of course, and I'm
sure the newest ones have escaped
my attention, but there are old
standards. Half the people in
Ramona's (541 Ramona St., Palo
Alto) on any given weekend night

a butcher shop, but it serves great
breakfasts (try the apple pancakes

or a ham-swiss-apple omelette) at
amazingly low prices. (The latter
isn't always true on weekends
when you may find yourself order
ing a "brunch" at inflated prices.)
Finally, there's the favorite morn
ing meeting spot of Stanford
sororities: Dinah's Poolside Coffee
Shop (4269 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto; not to be confused with
Dinah's Shack, a mediocre restau
rant next door), which many people
feel has the best omelettes in the
area.
Quiche
And
California
Chic
After fondue and before pesto,
there was quiche. The Perfect Rec
ipe (76 Stanford Shopping Center)
still serves forgotten victim of the
gourmet wars, along with cutesy
sandwiches and good coffee; a dif
ferent quiche is served every day,
and you can count on a flakey crust
and perfect consistency. They don't
serve white wine, but you can still
dig your clogs out of the closet and
pretend Stanford is a shoo-in for a
bowl game (which last happened at
about the height of the quiche
craze).
There are no restaurants in the
vicinity of campus that could be
called innovative, but there are
some with Berkeley-gourmet trap
pings. Fresco (3398 El Camino
Real, Palo Alto) is a corporate ver
sion of the California ideal (it's run
by the Mac Arthur Park/Prego/Ciao
combine), serving pastas and grilled
fish cooked with various combina
tions of sun-dried tomatos, basil
and red peppers, along with
composed salads and the obligatory
grilled meats (lamb and steak). It's
a pleasant, reasonably priced place
with perfectly well-prepared, but
boring, food. Smaller and chicer is
Theo's (546 University Ave., Palo
Alto), which has a more conserva
tive, steakhouse type of menu but a
better wine list (wine being the all
important item in this type of res
taurant).

In
Search
Of
Barbecue
The true barbecue experience is
unavailable in this area; the nearest

worthwhile sauce is in South San
Francisco. Mac Arthur Park has
decent ribs (the ribs are one of the
few things worth eating there) cov
ered with a tame, ketchup
dominated sauce. If you want real
barbecue ambiance, thought, go to
Goldie's Oakwood Bar-B-Que
(1940 C University Ave., East Palo
Alto — bear left before the freeway),
a storefront operation in Whiskey
Gulch. Goldie's confronts the public
with a bare, whitewashed room
holding two formica tables and a
cooler. In the far wall there's a hole
through which you order your pork
or beef ribs, chicken or links. You
can get an order or a sandwich
(about half the size of an order).
Both will come with white bread
wrapped in plastic and your choice
of baked beans or coleslaw. The
sauce here is the real thing, but it's

awfully mild; there's no reason not
to order it hot.
From
Sea
And
Streams
The Fish Market (3150 El Camino
Real, Palo Alto) has long been Palo
Alto's most popular spot for
seafood, and it generally deserves
to be. It was way ahead of the
mesquite-grill, fresh-special game,
and the high school kids who do the
grilling get it right most of the time.
There's also friendly, informal ser
vice from an army of T-shirt-clad
young waitresses. The lines can be
long on weekends, but there's an
outdoor patio, drinks while you
wait, and an oyster-seafood cocktail
bar to help pass the time. Scott's
Seafood Bar & Grill (2300 East
Bayshore at Embarcadero, Palo
Alto) has given The Fish Market a
run for its money since opening five
years ago, but it's attractive mainly
as a place to be seen; the fish is
overcooked about half the time, the
service can be shoddy, and the
prices are way out of line.
Battle
Of
The
Burgers
Kirk's (361 California Ave., Palo
Alto) has great hamburgers, but
they're not for the faint-hearted.
Ask for your steakburger well-done
if you don't want it raw. The
burgers at Kirk's are cooked over a
charcoal grill while you wait; there's
nothing else to eat but potato chips
and some packaged salads, but this
is a small point when you're getting
one of the last real hamburgers. A
close second in the hamburger
derby is the Alpine. Beer Garden
(3915 Alpine Road, Portola Valley),
also known as the Alpine Inn or as
Rosotti's or, most commonly, as
Zott's.


Stanford hangouts change from
year to year, of course, and I'm
sure the newest ones have escaped
my attention, but there are old
standards. Half the people in
Ramona's (541 Ramona St., Palo
Alto) on any given weekend night
will be from Stanford: the Stanford
crush is particularly intense before
and after basketball games. Most of
them will be eating the second-best
pizza in the area — I'll tell you about
the best a little later — while those
who want to be different chew on
calzone or decent hamburgers. The
once-great Ramona's salad bar
maintains only a shade of its former
glory. Down the street at the Good
Earth Restaurant (185 University
Ave., Palo Alto) you'll find a differ

ent, slightly older, Stanford crowd
eating chic health food. Of course,
hangouts in the true Stanford sense
of the word are places you go to
swill beer, and there are a couple of
those: The Dutch Goose (3567
Alameda deals Pulgas, Menlo
Park), a functional sort of place
where there's standing room only
on Senior Pub Nights, and The
Oasts Beer Garden (241 El Camino
Real, Menlo Park), a downright
ugly place that has been witness to
untold decades of Stanford history.
Two things you have to know: refer
to them as "the Goose" and"the 0"
respectively: and rest assured that
you will be carded at both establish
ments. If you like your nightlife a bit
rowdier, try St. James Infirmary
(390 Moffet Blvd., Mountain View)
or Antonio's Nut House (321 Cali
fornia Ave., Palo Alto), places
where you can get into a fight if you
try hard enough. In recent years an
attempt has been made to turn The
Lancashire Tavern (547 Emerson

St., Palo Alto) into a Stanford hang
out of the pub night variety, but it
doesn't seem to have fully caught
on. A morning alternative: the

brunch crowd at
Hobee's. And
don't forget the
New Varsity, (456
University Ave.,
Palo Alto), espe
cially when the
theater is showing
Woody Allen
movies.
Frank ie,
Johnnie & Luigi
Too (939 El
Camino Real,
Mountain View)
has no peer in
pizza; what it
does have are 45-
minute-to-an-hour

waits on weekends, which can fly
by if enough of you go and if you
drink enough while waiting (if you
look 21. you'll be accosted by a

roving cocktail waitress the minute
you sign in). Try the fresh-tomato
and-garlic pizza, a house specialty,
and avoid the Italian dinners, which

are often dread
ful. Ramona's is a
distant second to
FJ&L, followed
by the pizza with
barbecue sauce
(ladled on in place
of tomato sauce)
at Jose's (2275 El
Camino Real, Palo
Alto).
This may not
seem like a rele
vant category for
The Daily, but
I've seen more
than my share of
students (MBA
and otherwise) in

these places:
42nd, Street (518 Bryant St., Palo
Alto, in the alley between Bryant
and Ramona) is either a dream

come true or a nightmare made
real, depending on your point of
view. It's an expensively tacky
meat market with great sight lines,
where you'll find a variety of
hunters: tables of frightened
looking Stanford students, Palo
Alto nouveau riche and lots of sec
retaries. The action is much more
serious at the British Bankers Club
(1090 El Camino Real, Menlo
Park), which draws an older, richer
crowd (it goes in and out of fashion
as a business school hangout) to its
fake Edwardian digs. Coming on
strong in recent years has been
Mac Arthur Park (27 University
Ave., Palo Alto, next to the train
station), a favorite of young profes
sional types. Style is everything in a
yuppie hangout, and Mac Arthur
Park has one of the approved
styles: big, open, white-painted
spaces, wood floor, railings
everywhere. The food ranges from
mediocre to bad (be sure to order
something from the grill), but what

does it matter when you can get
potato skins and eight wines by the
glass? Another style is represented
by Waverley Place (560 Waveriey
St., Palo Alto), relatively new to
downtown Palo Alto, which is all
glass and bleached wood and ex
pensive (but surprisingly good)
pastas and seafood dishes. You can
get a young Lafite Rothschild or
Chateau Petrus, but there won't be
anything worth drinking for under
$20. Along with these upstarts, a
couple of established Palo Alto res
taurants have swung with the
times: The Gatehouse (265 Lytton
Ave.), one of Palo Alto's prettiest
places to eat and drink, is taken
over by the young after the dinner
hour, and Henry's (482 University
Ave.) is a favorite with the local ad
vertising/design community that
lives off Silicon Valley. There's also
Chili's Hamburger Grill & Bar
(700 El Camino Real, Menlo Park).

Toasts
Of
The
Town
I'm concerned here with the bar
as a comfortable environment in
which to drink, as opposed to a sup
portive environment in which to get
drunk (or find your soulmate).
The Gatehouse (265 Lytton Ave.,
Palo Alto) is a snitzy restaurant by
day and a snitzy bar by night, and
one of the nicest places to sit
around in Palo Alto. The bar at
Mama's (379 Stanford Shopping
Center) is a bit out of the way, but
it has a certain hushed elegance
that makes it attractive. Henry's
(482 University Ave., Palo Alto) is
hot and crowded once the dinner
customers clear out, but there's no
one on the make; just lots of suc
cessful young Palo Altans hanging
out in one of their favorite bars. An
other bar that has a "scene, " but
isn't quite a singles bar, is that of
the New Varsity (456 University

Ave., Palo Alto). Videos play above
the bar, musicians play in the court
yard, and lots of Paly High blondes
and assorted Palo Alto punks hang
around out front. It's noisy and
crowded and uncomfortable on the
weekends, but the people watching
is great. If you're looking for some
thing a little more staid, try the bar
at the rear of the London House
(630 Ramona St., Palo Alto), a
loving re-creation of an English pub
where you can get most any British
beer you want, pub snacks and a
game of darts.
Candles
And
Bay
Lights
Everyone has his own idea of the
perfect surroundings in which to let
love flower, but each of the follow
ing places is romantic in its own
way. Bella Vista (13451 Skyline
Blvd., Woodside) has, as you might
expect, a gorgeous view; it nestles
in the redwoods atop the Skyline
ridge, and if you're lucky you'll get a
candlelit table by the window that
looks out over the bay. Tuxedoed

waiters and picturesque locals in
Jaguars complete the picture. St.
Michael's Alley (800 Emerson St.,
Palo Alto) is a little crowded and a
little noisy, but it has an air of so
phistication unusual in Palo Alto, to
go with its eclectic continental
menu (you'll eat as well here as
anywhere in town). Sundance Mine

Company (1921 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto) isn't to everyone's taste;
it has an unimaginative steak-and
seafood menu, it's overpriced, and
it takes itself awfully seriously. But
we're talking atmosphere here, and
if you're in the right feeling-like-an
adult mood, Sundance, with its
state-of-the-art green/brown

wood/cut-glass interior, has it to
burn. And many a Stanford couple
holds fond memories of Flea Street
Cafe (3607 Alameda de las Pulgas,
Menlo Park, two doors from the
Dutch Goose) a low-key little place
with excellent avant-veggie food.
Without going into too much
detail, there are two local French

restaurants that come close to
meeting the bistro ideal (good food,
relatively low prices); Le Pot au
Feu (1149 El Camino Real. Menlo
Park) and A La Carte Restaurant
Francois (2310 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto). Somewhat more formal,
but still affordable, are Pear Wil
liams Restaurant Francais (150
Middlefield Road, Menlo Park) and
Chez Louis (4170 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto). Most of the other
nearby French restaurants suffer
from some combination of preten
tiousness, over-pricing, bad service
and just plain poor food.
Chinese,
Mexican,
German,
Japanese
It's the familiar refrain: How about
Chinese? How about Mexican? And
it's easy to fall into around here, be
cause there are more ethnic restau
rants than you can shake a burrito
or a potsticker at. Most of them are
bad as you'd expect; here are a few
of the good ones:

Generations of Stanfordites have
fallen in love with the mu shu pork
at Chef Chu's (1067 North San An
tonio Road at El Camino Real, Los
Altos). This always crowded Man
darin restaurant prepares perfectly
solid, unexciting dishes — it's the

ideal place for large groups with
diverse tastes. The food's more ex
citing at China First (675 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto), another
place with a large reputation. The
cuisine here is Szechwan/Hunan, al
beit not that spicy, and there are
great dishes on the menu; if you go
in looking like students, you may
have to put up with the waiter sniff
ing at you.
On a more modest scale, there
are two worthwhile Chinese places
in Menlo Park: Yuen Yung (639
Santa Cruz Ave.) and Su Hong
(1039 El Camino Real). Both are

eclectic, but primarily Can
tonese/Mandarin. Su Hong has bet
ter food, Yuen Yung more interest
ing decor — it looks like a cross be
tween a Chinese restaurant and a
fern bar.
Just blocks away from the center
of Northern California's illicit
wholesale drug trade is an excellent
Mexican restaurant, La Fortuna
(3180 Middlefield Road, Redwood
City). Around the corner is Rosita's

Taqueria (171 A sth Ave., Red
wood City), which has the best bur
ritos around. Estrellita (971 North
San Antonio Road, Los Altos) isn't
what it used to be, but it still has
great chimichangas. There are two
passable family-type Mexican joints
in Menlo Park: La Luna Mexican
Cafe (137 Chestnut St.) and Caleta
(1143 D Crane St.). If you don't
mind a drive, the best Latin restau
rant around is probably El Calderon
(699 El Calderon Ave., Mountain
View), which is hidden away in a
small shopping center and has a
Mexican/Salvadoran menu.

The only German restaurant
anywhere near campus is the Black
Forest Inn (376 First St., Los
Altos). Meals are prepared rather
indifferently, but if you just have to
have some weinerschnitzel with red
cabbage and potato pancakes, this
is the place to go.
Fuki-sushi (4119 El Camino
Real, Palo Alto) has both a sushi bar
and a robata bar, and is a swank,
full-service Japanese restaurant to
boot. An hour at the sushi bar will
cost you what you've always heard
sushi costs. Ten-ichi Tempura (925
El Camino Real, Menlo Park) isn't
as fancy, but the sushi is just as
good and a fair bit cheaper.
Breakfast
Out
Of
Bed
Morning eaters are lucky here —
Palo Alto and Menlo Park have a
plethora of good restaurants that
specialize in breakfast and lunch.
First among equals is Late for the
Train (561 Oak Grove Ave., Menlo
Park, near the train station), a
folksy place that makes great
omelettes, divine blintzes and fruit
pancakes and the usual salads and
sandwiches, plus ever-changing
desserts. If you go on a weekend,
particularly a Sunday, expect at
least a 45-minute wait; it's best, if
you can, to go for an early or late
weekday lunch, when you are often
seated immediately. Modeled along
much the same lines is Hobee's
Haven (442 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto, in Town and Country Village),
a family operation with more
branches down the peninsula.
Hobee's follows more traditional
American breakfast lines — sausage,
eggs, ham — but isn't lacking for
fresh-squeezed juices, fruit and
other California trimmings, and it
has a truly addictive coffee cake
that comes with most of the break
fasts. The Farmer's Market (448
California Ave., Palo Alto) has a
small menu, spotty service (semi
cafeteria style) and the ambiance of
a butcher shop, but it serves great
breakfasts (try the apple pancakes

or a ham-swiss-apple omelette) at
amazingly low prices. (The latter
isn't always true on weekends
when you may find yourself order
ing a "brunch" at inflated prices.)
Finally, there's the favorite morn
ing meeting spot of Stanford
sororities: Dinah's Poolside Coffee
Shop (4269 El Camino Real, Palo

Dinah's Shack, a mediocre restau
rant next door), which many people

Francois (2310 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto). Somewhat more formal,
but still affordable, are Pear Wil
liams Restaurant Francais (150
Middlefield Road, Menlo Park) and
Chez Louis (4170 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto). Most of the other
nearby French restaurants suffer
from some combination of preten
tiousness, over-pricing, bad service
and just plain poor food.
Chinese,
Mexican,
German,
Japanese
It's the familiar refrain: How about
Chinese? How about Mexican? And
it's easy to fall into around here, be
cause there are more ethnic restau
rants than you can shake a burrito
or a potsticker at. Most of them are
bad as you'd expect; here are a few
of the good ones:

Generations of Stanfordites have
fallen in love with the mu shu pork
at Chef Chu's (1067 North San An
tonio Road at El Camino Real, Los
Altos). This always crowded Man
darin restaurant prepares perfectly
solid, unexciting dishes — it's the

ideal place for large groups with
diverse tastes. The food's more ex
citing at China First (675 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto), another
place with a large reputation. The
cuisine here is Szechwan/Hunan, al
beit not that spicy, and there are
great dishes on the menu; if you go
in looking like students, you may
have to put up with the waiter sniff
ing at you.
On a more modest scale, there
are two worthwhile Chinese places
in Menlo Park: Yuen Yung (639
Santa Cruz Ave.) and Su Hong
(1039 El Camino Real). Both are

eclectic, but primarily Can
tonese/Mandarin. Su Hong has bet
ter food, Yuen Yung more interest
ing decor — it looks like a cross be
tween a Chinese restaurant and a
fern bar.
Just blocks away from the center
of Northern California's illicit
wholesale drug trade is an excellent
Mexican restaurant, La Fortuna
(3180 Middlefield Road, Redwood
City). Around the corner is Rosita's

Taqueria (171 A sth Ave., Red
wood City), which has the best bur
ritos around. Estrellita (971 North
San Antonio Road, Los Altos) isn't
what it used to be, but it still has
great chimichangas. There are two
passable family-type Mexican joints
in Menlo Park: La Luna Mexican
Cafe (137 Chestnut St.) and Caleta
(1143 D Crane St.). If you don't
mind a drive, the best Latin restau
rant around is probably El Calderon
(699 El Calderon Ave., Mountain
View), which is hidden away in a
small shopping center and has a
Mexican/Salvadoran menu.

The only German restaurant
anywhere near campus is the Black
Forest Inn (376 First St., Los
Altos). Meals are prepared rather
indifferently, but if you just have to
have some weinerschnitzel with red
cabbage and potato pancakes, this
is the place to go.
Fuki-sushi (4119 El Camino
Real, Palo Alto) has both a sushi bar
and a robata bar, and is a swank,
full-service Japanese restaurant to
boot. An hour at the sushi bar will
cost you what you've always heard
sushi costs. Ten-ichi Tempura (925
El Camino Real, Menlo Park) isn't
as fancy, but the sushi is just as
good and a fair bit cheaper.
Breakfast
Out
Of
Bed
Morning eaters are lucky here —
Palo Alto and Menlo Park have a
plethora of good restaurants that
specialize in breakfast and lunch.
First among equals is Late for the
Train (561 Oak Grove Ave., Menlo
Park, near the train station), a
folksy place that makes great
omelettes, divine blintzes and fruit
pancakes and the usual salads and
sandwiches, plus ever-changing
desserts. If you go on a weekend,
particularly a Sunday, expect at
least a 45-minute wait; it's best, if
you can, to go for an early or late
weekday lunch, when you are often
seated immediately. Modeled along
much the same lines is Hobee's
Haven (442 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto, in Town and Country Village),
a family operation with more
branches down the peninsula.
Hobee's follows more traditional
American breakfast lines — sausage,
eggs, ham — but isn't lacking for
fresh-squeezed juices, fruit and
other California trimmings, and it
has a truly addictive coffee cake
that comes with most of the break
fasts. The Farmer's Market (448
California Ave., Palo Alto) has a
small menu, spotty service (semi
cafeteria style) and the ambiance of
a butcher shop, but it serves great
breakfasts (try the apple pancakes

or a ham-swiss-apple omelette) at
amazingly low prices. (The latter
isn't always true on weekends
when you may find yourself order
ing a "brunch" at inflated prices.)
Finally, there's the favorite morn
ing meeting spot of Stanford
sororities: Dinah's Poolside Coffee
Shop (4269 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto; not to be confused with
Dinah's Shack, a mediocre restau
rant next door), which many people
feel has the best omelettes in the
area.
Quiche
And
California
Chic
After fondue and before pesto,
there was quiche. The Perfect Rec
ipe (76 Stanford Shopping Center)
still serves forgotten victim of the
gourmet wars, along with cutesy
sandwiches and good coffee; a dif
ferent quiche is served every day,
and you can count on a flakey crust
and perfect consistency. They don't
serve white wine, but you can still
dig your clogs out of the closet and
pretend Stanford is a shoo-in for a
bowl game (which last happened at
about the height of the quiche
craze).
There are no restaurants in the
vicinity of campus that could be
called innovative, but there are
some with Berkeley-gourmet trap
pings. Fresco (3398 El Camino
Real, Palo Alto) is a corporate ver
sion of the California ideal (it's run
by the Mac Arthur Park/Prego/Ciao
combine), serving pastas and grilled
fish cooked with various combina
tions of sun-dried tomatos, basil
and red peppers, along with
composed salads and the obligatory
grilled meats (lamb and steak). It's
a pleasant, reasonably priced place
with perfectly well-prepared, but
boring, food. Smaller and chicer is
Theo's (546 University Ave., Palo
Alto), which has a more conserva
tive, steakhouse type of menu but a
better wine list (wine being the all
important item in this type of res
taurant).

In
Search
Of
Barbecue
The true barbecue experience is
unavailable in this area; the nearest

worthwhile sauce is in South San
Francisco. Mac Arthur Park has
decent ribs (the ribs are one of the
few things worth eating there) cov
ered with a tame, ketchup
dominated sauce. If you want real
barbecue ambiance, thought, go to
Goldie's Oakwood Bar-B-Que
(1940 C University Ave., East Palo
Alto — bear left before the freeway),
a storefront operation in Whiskey
Gulch. Goldie's confronts the public
with a bare, whitewashed room
holding two formica tables and a
cooler. In the far wall there's a hole
through which you order your pork
or beef ribs, chicken or links. You
can get an order or a sandwich
(about half the size of an order).
Both will come with white bread
wrapped in plastic and your choice
of baked beans or coleslaw. The
sauce here is the real thing, but it's

awfully mild; there's no reason not
to order it hot.
From
Sea
And
Streams
The Fish Market (3150 El Camino
Real, Palo Alto) has long been Palo
Alto's most popular spot for
seafood, and it generally deserves
to be. It was way ahead of the
mesquite-grill, fresh-special game,
and the high school kids who do the
grilling get it right most of the time.
There's also friendly, informal ser
vice from an army of T-shirt-clad
young waitresses. The lines can be
long on weekends, but there's an
outdoor patio, drinks while you
wait, and an oyster-seafood cocktail
bar to help pass the time. Scott's
Seafood Bar & Grill (2300 East
Bayshore at Embarcadero, Palo
Alto) has given The Fish Market a
run for its money since opening five
years ago, but it's attractive mainly
as a place to be seen; the fish is
overcooked about half the time, the
service can be shoddy, and the
prices are way out of line.
Battle
Of
The
Burgers
Kirk's (361 California Ave., Palo
Alto) has great hamburgers, but
they're not for the faint-hearted.
Ask for your steakburger well-done
if you don't want it raw. The
burgers at Kirk's are cooked over a
charcoal grill while you wait; there's
nothing else to eat but potato chips
and some packaged salads, but this
is a small point when you're getting
one of the last real hamburgers. A
close second in the hamburger
derby is the Alpine. Beer Garden
(3915 Alpine Road, Portola Valley),
also known as the Alpine Inn or as
Rosotti's or, most commonly, as
Zott's.


Stanford hangouts change from
year to year, of course, and I'm
sure the newest ones have escaped
my attention, but there are old
standards. Half the people in
Ramona's (541 Ramona St., Palo
Alto) on any given weekend night
will be from Stanford: the Stanford
crush is particularly intense before
and after basketball games. Most of
them will be eating the second-best
pizza in the area — I'll tell you about
the best a little later — while those
who want to be different chew on
calzone or decent hamburgers. The
once-great Ramona's salad bar
maintains only a shade of its former
glory. Down the street at the Good
Earth Restaurant (185 University
Ave., Palo Alto) you'll find a differ

ent, slightly older, Stanford crowd
eating chic health food. Of course,
hangouts in the true Stanford sense
of the word are places you go to
swill beer, and there are a couple of
those: The Dutch Goose (3567
Alameda deals Pulgas, Menlo
Park), a functional sort of place
where there's standing room only
on Senior Pub Nights, and The
Oasts Beer Garden (241 El Camino
Real, Menlo Park), a downright
ugly place that has been witness to
untold decades of Stanford history.
Two things you have to know: refer
to them as "the Goose" and"the 0"
respectively: and rest assured that
you will be carded at both establish
ments. If you like your nightlife a bit
rowdier, try St. James Infirmary
(390 Moffet Blvd., Mountain View)
or Antonio's Nut House (321 Cali
fornia Ave., Palo Alto), places
where you can get into a fight if you
try hard enough. In recent years an
attempt has been made to turn The
Lancashire Tavern (547 Emerson

St., Palo Alto) into a Stanford hang
out of the pub night variety, but it
doesn't seem to have fully caught
on. A morning alternative: the

brunch crowd at
Hobee's. And
don't forget the
New Varsity, (456
University Ave.,
Palo Alto), espe
cially when the
theater is showing
Woody Allen
movies.
Frank ie,
Johnnie & Luigi
Too (939 El
Camino Real,
Mountain View)
has no peer in
pizza; what it
does have are 45-
minute-to-an-hour

waits on weekends, which can fly
by if enough of you go and if you
drink enough while waiting (if you
look 21. you'll be accosted by a

roving cocktail waitress the minute
you sign in). Try the fresh-tomato
and-garlic pizza, a house specialty,
and avoid the Italian dinners, which

are often dread
ful. Ramona's is a
distant second to
FJ&L, followed
by the pizza with
barbecue sauce
(ladled on in place
of tomato sauce)
at Jose's (2275 El
Camino Real, Palo
Alto).
This may not
seem like a rele
vant category for
The Daily, but
I've seen more
than my share of
students (MBA
and otherwise) in

these places:
42nd, Street (518 Bryant St., Palo
Alto, in the alley between Bryant
and Ramona) is either a dream

come true or a nightmare made
real, depending on your point of
view. It's an expensively tacky
meat market with great sight lines,
where you'll find a variety of
hunters: tables of frightened
looking Stanford students, Palo
Alto nouveau riche and lots of sec
retaries. The action is much more
serious at the British Bankers Club
(1090 El Camino Real, Menlo
Park), which draws an older, richer
crowd (it goes in and out of fashion
as a business school hangout) to its
fake Edwardian digs. Coming on
strong in recent years has been
Mac Arthur Park (27 University
Ave., Palo Alto, next to the train
station), a favorite of young profes
sional types. Style is everything in a
yuppie hangout, and Mac Arthur
Park has one of the approved
styles: big, open, white-painted
spaces, wood floor, railings
everywhere. The food ranges from
mediocre to bad (be sure to order
something from the grill), but what

does it matter when you can get
potato skins and eight wines by the
glass? Another style is represented
by Waverley Place (560 Waveriey
St., Palo Alto), relatively new to
downtown Palo Alto, which is all
glass and bleached wood and ex
pensive (but surprisingly good)
pastas and seafood dishes. You can
get a young Lafite Rothschild or
Chateau Petrus, but there won't be
anything worth drinking for under
$20. Along with these upstarts, a
couple of established Palo Alto res
taurants have swung with the
times: The Gatehouse (265 Lytton
Ave.), one of Palo Alto's prettiest
places to eat and drink, is taken
over by the young after the dinner
hour, and Henry's (482 University
Ave.) is a favorite with the local ad
vertising/design community that
lives off Silicon Valley. There's also
Chili's Hamburger Grill & Bar
(700 El Camino Real, Menlo Park).

Toasts
Of
The
Town
I'm concerned here with the bar
as a comfortable environment in
which to drink, as opposed to a sup
portive environment in which to get
drunk (or find your soulmate).
The Gatehouse (265 Lytton Ave.,
Palo Alto) is a snitzy restaurant by
day and a snitzy bar by night, and
one of the nicest places to sit
around in Palo Alto. The bar at
Mama's (379 Stanford Shopping
Center) is a bit out of the way, but
it has a certain hushed elegance
that makes it attractive. Henry's
(482 University Ave., Palo Alto) is
hot and crowded once the dinner
customers clear out, but there's no
one on the make; just lots of suc
cessful young Palo Altans hanging
out in one of their favorite bars. An
other bar that has a "scene, " but
isn't quite a singles bar, is that of
the New Varsity (456 University

Ave., Palo Alto). Videos play above
the bar, musicians play in the court
yard, and lots of Paly High blondes
and assorted Palo Alto punks hang
around out front. It's noisy and
crowded and uncomfortable on the
weekends, but the people watching
is great. If you're looking for some
thing a little more staid, try the bar
at the rear of the London House
(630 Ramona St., Palo Alto), a
loving re-creation of an English pub
where you can get most any British
beer you want, pub snacks and a
game of darts.
Candles
And
Bay
Lights
Everyone has his own idea of the
perfect surroundings in which to let
love flower, but each of the follow
ing places is romantic in its own
way. Bella Vista (13451 Skyline
Blvd., Woodside) has, as you might
expect, a gorgeous view; it nestles
in the redwoods atop the Skyline
ridge, and if you're lucky you'll get a
candlelit table by the window that
looks out over the bay. Tuxedoed

waiters and picturesque locals in
Jaguars complete the picture. St.
Michael's Alley (800 Emerson St.,
Palo Alto) is a little crowded and a
little noisy, but it has an air of so
phistication unusual in Palo Alto, to
go with its eclectic continental
menu (you'll eat as well here as
anywhere in town). Sundance Mine

Company (1921 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto) isn't to everyone's taste;
it has an unimaginative steak-and
seafood menu, it's overpriced, and
it takes itself awfully seriously. But
we're talking atmosphere here, and
if you're in the right feeling-like-an
adult mood, Sundance, with its
state-of-the-art green/brown

wood/cut-glass interior, has it to
burn. And many a Stanford couple
holds fond memories of Flea Street
Cafe (3607 Alameda de las Pulgas,
Menlo Park, two doors from the
Dutch Goose) a low-key little place
with excellent avant-veggie food.
Without going into too much
detail, there are two local French

restaurants that come close to
meeting the bistro ideal (good food,
relatively low prices); Le Pot au
Feu (1149 El Camino Real. Menlo
Park) and A La Carte Restaurant
Francois (2310 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto). Somewhat more formal,
but still affordable, are Pear Wil
liams Restaurant Francais (150
Middlefield Road, Menlo Park) and
Chez Louis (4170 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto). Most of the other
nearby French restaurants suffer
from some combination of preten

and just plain poor food.

fake Edwardian digs. Coming on
strong in recent years has been
Mac Arthur Park (27 University
Ave., Palo Alto, next to the train
station), a favorite of young profes
sional types. Style is everything in a
yuppie hangout, and Mac Arthur
Park has one of the approved
styles: big, open, white-painted
spaces, wood floor, railings
everywhere. The food ranges from
mediocre to bad (be sure to order
something from the grill), but what

does it matter when you can get
potato skins and eight wines by the
glass? Another style is represented
by Waverley Place (560 Waveriey
St., Palo Alto), relatively new to
downtown Palo Alto, which is all
glass and bleached wood and ex
pensive (but surprisingly good)
pastas and seafood dishes. You can
get a young Lafite Rothschild or
Chateau Petrus, but there won't be
anything worth drinking for under
$20. Along with these upstarts, a
couple of established Palo Alto res
taurants have swung with the
times: The Gatehouse (265 Lytton
Ave.), one of Palo Alto's prettiest
places to eat and drink, is taken
over by the young after the dinner
hour, and Henry's (482 University
Ave.) is a favorite with the local ad
vertising/design community that
lives off Silicon Valley. There's also
Chili's Hamburger Grill & Bar
(700 El Camino Real, Menlo Park).

Toasts
Of
The
Town
I'm concerned here with the bar
as a comfortable environment in
which to drink, as opposed to a sup
portive environment in which to get
drunk (or find your soulmate).
The Gatehouse (265 Lytton Ave.,
Palo Alto) is a snitzy restaurant by
day and a snitzy bar by night, and
one of the nicest places to sit
around in Palo Alto. The bar at
Mama's (379 Stanford Shopping
Center) is a bit out of the way, but
it has a certain hushed elegance
that makes it attractive. Henry's
(482 University Ave., Palo Alto) is
hot and crowded once the dinner
customers clear out, but there's no
one on the make; just lots of suc
cessful young Palo Altans hanging
out in one of their favorite bars. An
other bar that has a "scene, " but
isn't quite a singles bar, is that of
the New Varsity (456 University

Ave., Palo Alto). Videos play above
the bar, musicians play in the court
yard, and lots of Paly High blondes
and assorted Palo Alto punks hang
around out front. It's noisy and
crowded and uncomfortable on the
weekends, but the people watching
is great. If you're looking for some
thing a little more staid, try the bar
at the rear of the London House
(630 Ramona St., Palo Alto), a
loving re-creation of an English pub
where you can get most any British
beer you want, pub snacks and a
game of darts.
Candles
And
Bay
Lights
Everyone has his own idea of the
perfect surroundings in which to let
love flower, but each of the follow
ing places is romantic in its own
way. Bella Vista (13451 Skyline
Blvd., Woodside) has, as you might
expect, a gorgeous view; it nestles
in the redwoods atop the Skyline
ridge, and if you're lucky you'll get a
candlelit table by the window that
looks out over the bay. Tuxedoed

waiters and picturesque locals in
Jaguars complete the picture. St.
Michael's Alley (800 Emerson St.,
Palo Alto) is a little crowded and a
little noisy, but it has an air of so
phistication unusual in Palo Alto, to
go with its eclectic continental
menu (you'll eat as well here as
anywhere in town). Sundance Mine

Company (1921 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto) isn't to everyone's taste;
it has an unimaginative steak-and
seafood menu, it's overpriced, and
it takes itself awfully seriously. But
we're talking atmosphere here, and
if you're in the right feeling-like-an
adult mood, Sundance, with its
state-of-the-art green/brown

wood/cut-glass interior, has it to
burn. And many a Stanford couple
holds fond memories of Flea Street
Cafe (3607 Alameda de las Pulgas,
Menlo Park, two doors from the
Dutch Goose) a low-key little place
with excellent avant-veggie food.
Without going into too much
detail, there are two local French

restaurants that come close to
meeting the bistro ideal (good food,
relatively low prices); Le Pot au
Feu (1149 El Camino Real. Menlo
Park) and A La Carte Restaurant
Francois (2310 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto). Somewhat more formal,
but still affordable, are Pear Wil
liams Restaurant Francais (150
Middlefield Road, Menlo Park) and
Chez Louis (4170 El Camino Real,
Palo Alto). Most of the other
nearby French restaurants suffer
from some combination of preten
tiousness, over-pricing, bad service
and just plain poor food.
Chinese,
Mexican,
German,
Japanese
It's the familiar refrain: How about
Chinese? How about Mexican? And
it's easy to fall into around here, be
cause there are more ethnic restau
rants than you can shake a burrito
or a potsticker at. Most of them are
bad as you'd expect; here are a few
of the good ones:

Generations of Stanfordites have
fallen in love with the mu shu pork
at Chef Chu's (1067 North San An
tonio Road at El Camino Real, Los
Altos). This always crowded Man
darin restaurant prepares perfectly
solid, unexciting dishes — it's the

ideal place for large groups with
diverse tastes. The food's more ex
citing at China First (675 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto), another
place with a large reputation. The
cuisine here is Szechwan/Hunan, al
beit not that spicy, and there are
great dishes on the menu; if you go
in looking like students, you may
have to put up with the waiter sniff
ing at you.
On a more modest scale, there
are two worthwhile Chinese places
in Menlo Park: Yuen Yung (639
Santa Cruz Ave.) and Su Hong
(1039 El Camino Real). Both are

eclectic, but primarily Can
tonese/Mandarin. Su Hong has bet
ter food, Yuen Yung more interest
ing decor — it looks like a cross be
tween a Chinese restaurant and a
fern bar.
Just blocks away from the center
of Northern California's illicit
wholesale drug trade is an excellent
Mexican restaurant, La Fortuna
(3180 Middlefield Road, Redwood
City). Around the corner is Rosita's

Taqueria (171 A sth Ave., Red
wood City), which has the best bur
ritos around. Estrellita (971 North
San Antonio Road, Los Altos) isn't
what it used to be, but it still has
great chimichangas. There are two
passable family-type Mexican joints
in Menlo Park: La Luna Mexican
Cafe (137 Chestnut St.) and Caleta
(1143 D Crane St.). If you don't
mind a drive, the best Latin restau
rant around is probably El Calderon
(699 El Calderon Ave., Mountain
View), which is hidden away in a
small shopping center and has a
Mexican/Salvadoran menu.

The only German restaurant
anywhere near campus is the Black
Forest Inn (376 First St., Los
Altos). Meals are prepared rather
indifferently, but if you just have to
have some weinerschnitzel with red
cabbage and potato pancakes, this
is the place to go.
Fuki-sushi (4119 El Camino
Real, Palo Alto) has both a sushi bar
and a robata bar, and is a swank,
full-service Japanese restaurant to
boot. An hour at the sushi bar will
cost you what you've always heard
sushi costs. Ten-ichi Tempura (925
El Camino Real, Menlo Park) isn't
as fancy, but the sushi is just as
good and a fair bit cheaper.
Breakfast
Out
Of
Bed
Morning eaters are lucky here —
Palo Alto and Menlo Park have a
plethora of good restaurants that
specialize in breakfast and lunch.
First among equals is Late for the
Train (561 Oak Grove Ave., Menlo
Park, near the train station), a
folksy place that makes great
omelettes, divine blintzes and fruit
pancakes and the usual salads and
sandwiches, plus ever-changing
desserts. If you go on a weekend,
particularly a Sunday, expect at
least a 45-minute wait; it's best, if
you can, to go for an early or late
weekday lunch, when you are often
seated immediately. Modeled along
much the same lines is Hobee's
Haven (442 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto, in Town and Country Village),
a family operation with more
branches down the peninsula.
Hobee's follows more traditional
American breakfast lines — sausage,
eggs, ham — but isn't lacking for
fresh-squeezed juices, fruit and
other California trimmings, and it
has a truly addictive coffee cake
that comes with most of the break
fasts. The Farmer's Market (448
California Ave., Palo Alto) has a
small menu, spotty service (semi
cafeteria style) and the ambiance of
a butcher shop, but it serves great
breakfasts (try the apple pancakes

or a ham-swiss-apple omelette) at
amazingly low prices. (The latter
isn't always true on weekends
when you may find yourself order
ing a "brunch" at inflated prices.)
Finally, there's the favorite morn
ing meeting spot of Stanford
sororities: Dinah's Poolside Coffee
Shop (4269 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto; not to be confused with
Dinah's Shack, a mediocre restau
rant next door), which many people
feel has the best omelettes in the
area.
Quiche
And
California
Chic
After fondue and before pesto,
there was quiche. The Perfect Rec
ipe (76 Stanford Shopping Center)
still serves forgotten victim of the
gourmet wars, along with cutesy
sandwiches and good coffee; a dif
ferent quiche is served every day,
and you can count on a flakey crust
and perfect consistency. They don't
serve white wine, but you can still
dig your clogs out of the closet and
pretend Stanford is a shoo-in for a
bowl game (which last happened at
about the height of the quiche
craze).
There are no restaurants in the
vicinity of campus that could be
called innovative, but there are
some with Berkeley-gourmet trap
pings. Fresco (3398 El Camino
Real, Palo Alto) is a corporate ver
sion of the California ideal (it's run
by the Mac Arthur Park/Prego/Ciao
combine), serving pastas and grilled
fish cooked with various combina
tions of sun-dried tomatos, basil
and red peppers, along with
composed salads and the obligatory
grilled meats (lamb and steak). It's
a pleasant, reasonably priced place
with perfectly well-prepared, but
boring, food. Smaller and chicer is
Theo's (546 University Ave., Palo
Alto), which has a more conserva
tive, steakhouse type of menu but a
better wine list (wine being the all
important item in this type of res
taurant).

In
Search
Of
Barbecue
The true barbecue experience is
unavailable in this area; the nearest

worthwhile sauce is in South San
Francisco. Mac Arthur Park has
decent ribs (the ribs are one of the
few things worth eating there) cov
ered with a tame, ketchup
dominated sauce. If you want real
barbecue ambiance, thought, go to
Goldie's Oakwood Bar-B-Que
(1940 C University Ave., East Palo
Alto — bear left before the freeway),
a storefront operation in Whiskey
Gulch. Goldie's confronts the public
with a bare, whitewashed room
holding two formica tables and a
cooler. In the far wall there's a hole
through which you order your pork
or beef ribs, chicken or links. You
can get an order or a sandwich
(about half the size of an order).
Both will come with white bread
wrapped in plastic and your choice
of baked beans or coleslaw. The
sauce here is the real thing, but it's

awfully mild; there's no reason not
to order it hot.
From
Sea
And
Streams
The Fish Market (3150 El Camino
Real, Palo Alto) has long been Palo
Alto's most popular spot for
seafood, and it generally deserves
to be. It was way ahead of the
mesquite-grill, fresh-special game,
and the high school kids who do the
grilling get it right most of the time.
There's also friendly, informal ser
vice from an army of T-shirt-clad
young waitresses. The lines can be
long on weekends, but there's an
outdoor patio, drinks while you
wait, and an oyster-seafood cocktail
bar to help pass the time. Scott's
Seafood Bar & Grill (2300 East
Bayshore at Embarcadero, Palo
Alto) has given The Fish Market a
run for its money since opening five
years ago, but it's attractive mainly
as a place to be seen; the fish is
overcooked about half the time, the
service can be shoddy, and the
prices are way out of line.
Battle
Of
The
Burgers
Kirk's (361 California Ave., Palo
Alto) has great hamburgers, but
they're not for the faint-hearted.
Ask for your steakburger well-done
if you don't want it raw. The
burgers at Kirk's are cooked over a
charcoal grill while you wait; there's
nothing else to eat but potato chips
and some packaged salads, but this
is a small point when you're getting
one of the last real hamburgers. A
close second in the hamburger
derby is the Alpine. Beer Garden
(3915 Alpine Road, Portola Valley),
also known as the Alpine Inn or as
Rosotti's or, most commonly, as
Zott's.


Stanford hangouts change from
year to year, of course, and I'm
sure the newest ones have escaped
my attention, but there are old
standards. Half the people in
Ramona's (541 Ramona St., Palo
Alto) on any given weekend night
will be from Stanford: the Stanford
crush is particularly intense before
and after basketball games. Most of
them will be eating the second-best
pizza in the area — I'll tell you about
the best a little later — while those
who want to be different chew on
calzone or decent hamburgers. The
once-great Ramona's salad bar
maintains only a shade of its former
glory. Down the street at the Good
Earth Restaurant (185 University
Ave., Palo Alto) you'll find a differ

ent, slightly older, Stanford crowd
eating chic health food. Of course,
hangouts in the true Stanford sense
of the word are places you go to
swill beer, and there are a couple of
those: The Dutch Goose (3567
Alameda deals Pulgas, Menlo
Park), a functional sort of place
where there's standing room only
on Senior Pub Nights, and The
Oasts Beer Garden (241 El Camino
Real, Menlo Park), a downright
ugly place that has been witness to
untold decades of Stanford history.
Two things you have to know: refer
to them as "the Goose" and"the 0"
respectively: and rest assured that
you will be carded at both establish
ments. If you like your nightlife a bit
rowdier, try St. James Infirmary
(390 Moffet Blvd., Mountain View)
or Antonio's Nut House (321 Cali
fornia Ave., Palo Alto), places
where you can get into a fight if you
try hard enough. In recent years an
attempt has been made to turn The
Lancashire Tavern (547 Emerson

St., Palo Alto) into a Stanford hang
out of the pub night variety, but it
doesn't seem to have fully caught
on. A morning alternative: the

brunch crowd at
Hobee's. And
don't forget the
New Varsity, (456
University Ave.,
Palo Alto), espe
cially when the
theater is showing
Woody Allen
movies.
Frank ie,
Johnnie & Luigi
Too (939 El
Camino Real,
Mountain View)
has no peer in
pizza; what it
does have are 45-
minute-to-an-hour

waits on weekends, which can fly
by if enough of you go and if you
drink enough while waiting (if you
look 21. you'll be accosted by a

roving cocktail waitress the minute
you sign in). Try the fresh-tomato
and-garlic pizza, a house specialty,
and avoid the Italian dinners, which

are often dread
ful. Ramona's is a
distant second to
FJ&L, followed
by the pizza with
barbecue sauce
(ladled on in place
of tomato sauce)
at Jose's (2275 El
Camino Real, Palo
Alto).
This may not
seem like a rele
vant category for
The Daily, but
I've seen more
than my share of
students (MBA
and otherwise) in

these places:
42nd, Street (518 Bryant St., Palo
Alto, in the alley between Bryant
and Ramona) is either a dream

come true or a nightmare made
real, depending on your point of
view. It's an expensively tacky
meat market with great sight lines,
where you'll find a variety of
hunters: tables of frightened
looking Stanford students, Palo
Alto nouveau riche and lots of sec
retaries. The action is much more
serious at the British Bankers Club
(1090 El Camino Real, Menlo
Park), which draws an older, richer
crowd (it goes in and out of fashion
as a business school hangout) to its
fake Edwardian digs. Coming on
strong in recent years has been
Mac Arthur Park (27 University
Ave., Palo Alto, next to the train
station), a favorite of young profes
sional types. Style is everything in a

Of
The
Burgers
Kirk's (361 California Ave., Palo
Alto) has great hamburgers, but
they're not for the faint-hearted.
Ask for your steakburger well-done
if you don't want it raw. The
burgers at Kirk's are cooked over a
charcoal grill while you wait; there's
nothing else to eat but potato chips
and some packaged salads, but this
is a small point when you're getting
one of the last real hamburgers. A
close second in the hamburger
derby is the Alpine. Beer Garden
(3915 Alpine Road, Portola Valley),
also known as the Alpine Inn or as
Rosotti's or, most commonly, as
Zott's.
