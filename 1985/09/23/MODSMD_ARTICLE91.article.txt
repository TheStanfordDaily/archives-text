# Eat, Drink, Be Merry — off the Farm

Stanford hangouts change from
year to year, of course, and I'm
sure the newest ones have escaped
my attention, but there are old
standards. Half the people in
Ramona's (541 Ramona St., Palo
Alto) on any given weekend night
will be from Stanford: the Stanford
crush is particularly intense before
and after basketball games. Most of
them will be eating the second-best
pizza in the area — I'll tell you about
the best a little later — while those
who want to be different chew on
calzone or decent hamburgers. The
once-great Ramona's salad bar
maintains only a shade of its former
glory. Down the street at the Good
Earth Restaurant (185 University
Ave., Palo Alto) you'll find a differ

ent, slightly older, Stanford crowd
eating chic health food. Of course,
hangouts in the true Stanford sense
of the word are places you go to
swill beer, and there are a couple of
those: The Dutch Goose (3567
Alameda deals Pulgas, Menlo
Park), a functional sort of place
where there's standing room only
on Senior Pub Nights, and The
Oasts Beer Garden (241 El Camino
Real, Menlo Park), a downright
ugly place that has been witness to
untold decades of Stanford history.
Two things you have to know: refer
to them as "the Goose" and"the 0"
respectively: and rest assured that
you will be carded at both establish
ments. If you like your nightlife a bit
rowdier, try St. James Infirmary
(390 Moffet Blvd., Mountain View)
or Antonio's Nut House (321 Cali
fornia Ave., Palo Alto), places
where you can get into a fight if you
try hard enough. In recent years an
attempt has been made to turn The
Lancashire Tavern (547 Emerson

St., Palo Alto) into a Stanford hang
out of the pub night variety, but it
doesn't seem to have fully caught
on. A morning alternative: the

brunch crowd at
Hobee's. And
don't forget the
New Varsity, (456
University Ave.,
Palo Alto), espe
cially when the
theater is showing
Woody Allen
movies.
Frank ie,
Johnnie & Luigi
Too (939 El
Camino Real,
Mountain View)
has no peer in
pizza; what it
does have are 45-
minute-to-an-hour

waits on weekends, which can fly
by if enough of you go and if you
drink enough while waiting (if you
look 21. you'll be accosted by a

roving cocktail waitress the minute
you sign in). Try the fresh-tomato
and-garlic pizza, a house specialty,
and avoid the Italian dinners, which

are often dread
ful. Ramona's is a
distant second to
FJ&L, followed
by the pizza with
barbecue sauce
(ladled on in place
of tomato sauce)
at Jose's (2275 El
Camino Real, Palo
Alto).
This may not
seem like a rele
vant category for
The Daily, but
I've seen more
than my share of
students (MBA
and otherwise) in

these places:
42nd, Street (518 Bryant St., Palo
Alto, in the alley between Bryant
and Ramona) is either a dream

come true or a nightmare made
real, depending on your point of
view. It's an expensively tacky
meat market with great sight lines,
where you'll find a variety of
hunters: tables of frightened
looking Stanford students, Palo
Alto nouveau riche and lots of sec
retaries. The action is much more
serious at the British Bankers Club
(1090 El Camino Real, Menlo
Park), which draws an older, richer
crowd (it goes in and out of fashion
as a business school hangout) to its
fake Edwardian digs. Coming on
strong in recent years has been
Mac Arthur Park (27 University
Ave., Palo Alto, next to the train
station), a favorite of young profes
sional types. Style is everything in a
yuppie hangout, and Mac Arthur
Park has one of the approved
styles: big, open, white-painted
spaces, wood floor, railings
everywhere. The food ranges from
mediocre to bad (be sure to order
something from the grill), but what

does it matter when you can get
potato skins and eight wines by the
glass? Another style is represented
by Waverley Place (560 Waveriey
St., Palo Alto), relatively new to
downtown Palo Alto, which is all
glass and bleached wood and ex
pensive (but surprisingly good)
pastas and seafood dishes. You can
get a young Lafite Rothschild or
Chateau Petrus, but there won't be
anything worth drinking for under
$20. Along with these upstarts, a
couple of established Palo Alto res
taurants have swung with the
times: The Gatehouse (265 Lytton
Ave.), one of Palo Alto's prettiest
places to eat and drink, is taken
over by the young after the dinner
hour, and Henry's (482 University
Ave.) is a favorite with the local ad
vertising/design community that
lives off Silicon Valley. There's also
Chili's Hamburger Grill & Bar
(700 El Camino Real, Menlo Park).
