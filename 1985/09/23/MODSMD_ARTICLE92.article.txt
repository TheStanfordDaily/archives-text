# 21. The Daily
## 
### 
Why is The Daily one of the 21
things that make Stanford terrific ?
Just ask Beth. . .


She'll tell you that the Daily beats out "All My Children."


In fact, she prefers it
over and above
all other major
newspapers.

Yes, The Daily is a real winner. It's not just a
newspaper â€” it's a game. And you wouldn't
want to miss the next round.


And that it beats out People Magazine.


And so does
her friend
the burgher.


Beth thinks the Daily is worth fighting for.
