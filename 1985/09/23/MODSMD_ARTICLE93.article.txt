# Mad For The City
## 
### 
A Stanford education is incom
plete without visiting some of the
more popular tourist spots in the
City. Listed below are San Fran
cisco's most famous attractions.
Just remember: No matter how
hot it gets here, it's probably con
siderably cooler in San Francisco,
so dress warmly.
And take a camera.
Alcatraz — Known as "The
Rock," Alcatraz claims most of its
fame from the time it was a Devil's
Island-style federal penitentiary
that housed such notable criminals
as "The Bird Man" and A 1 Capone.
The island also has been used as a
fortification, a U.S. military prison,
an Army disciplinary barracks and a
Native American stronghold. The
National Park Service conducts
two-hour tours from the
waterfront, but be warned that this
is one of the City's most popular at
tractions. Reservations are hard to
secure.
Cable Cars — It's been a couple
years since they have been operat
ing after an 18-month hiatus, and
they're running smoothly. To many
San Franciscans, the cars are more
than a means of transportation:
they're a way of life.
Bank of America World
Headquarters — The Bank of
America complex occupies an
entire downtown block, complete
with a formal plaza dominated by a
black granite sculpture known lo
cally as "The Banker's Heart."
Completed in 1969, thousands of
movie-goers witnessed an early
demise of the Bank of America
building in the movie, "The Tower
ing Inferno."
California Palace of the Le
gion of Honor — The Palace,
perched close to Land's End in the
western part of the City, houses an
extensive collection of Rodin
bronzes, including "The Thinker."
The Cannery — A defunct Del
Monte cannery transformed into a
galleria of shops and restaurants,
The Cannery continues the
Ghiradelli tradition of urban
redevelopment. Mimes and
musicians perform regularly in the
complex's square.
Chinatown — A long-time resi
dent of Hong Kong once said that
San Francisco's Chinatown
reminded him of home — the rush
hour traffic jams on the main
thoroughfare, Grant Avenue,
rivaled any bicycle or automobile

tie-up a Chinese a city could
muster. But Grant Avenue also of
fers a kaleidoscope of Asian
delights — dim sum bars, restau
rants, pharmacies displaying
pickled snake, people inspecting
the Chinese cabbage in front of
grocery stores while pressed ducks
hang in the windows. The streets
radiating out from Grant Avenue
house one of the largest Chinese
populations outside of China and af
ford plenty of opportunities for ex
ploring.
Civic Center — After the 1906
earthquake and fire, city planners
wanted to remake San Francisco
into a modern Athens. The Civic
Center is only a small part of the
elaborate complex planned. San
Franciscans boast that City Hall,
with its ornamented dome, gar
goyled finials and marble
balustrade, is the finest example of
French Romanesque architecture
outside of Europe. The elaborate
federal and state office buildings,
Civic Auditorium, Brooks Exhibit
Hall, Public Library and Performing
Art Center echo this traditional
theme. The glass and concrete
Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall is
a modern departure.
Coit Tower/Telegraph Hill —
The Bohemian section of San Fran
cisco, the circuitous streets and
cliff-hanging houses of Telegraph
Hill, has been inhabited by succes
sive generations of flower children,
artists and literati. The upper area
around Coit Tower, a monument to
the the City's early volunteer
firefighters, has developed into a
patchwork of posh apartments.
Ferry Building — In the days
before rush-hour traffic clogged the
Bay and Golden Gate Bridges, the
ferry building annually processed
more than 50 million commuters
from the East Bay and Marin
County. Today, a Bay Bridge ap
proach obscures this monument at
the foot of Market Street. Although
the Golden Gate Ferry operates
out of its south side, most of the
building is now used as office space.
Fisherman's Wharf — Salty
fishermen, seagulls and the pungent
smell of freshly cleaned fish once
dominated San Francisco's wharf.
Although the nearby slips still berth
trawlers, the surrounding wharf
area has been taken over by wax
museums, carnival-type rides and
tourist shops. Yet the 19th century
museum ship Balclutha harks back

to old days, and some of the City's
best restaurants are still to be
found along "The Wharf."
Fort Point — this three-tiered
brick fort at one time held vigil over
the Golden Gate against invaders.
Now dwarfed by the Golden Gate
Bridge, the building has been made
a national historic site. Tours are
conducted between 10 a.m. and 5
p.m.
49 Mile Drive — This half-day
tour is a planned drive through the
most famous landmarks of the City.
An excellent introduction to San
Francisco, the route starts on Van
Ness Avenue at the Civic Center
and is clearly marked by blue and
white seagull signs.
George R. Moscone Conven
tion Center — A $126 million af
firmation that San Francisco is
indeed a tourist town. The site of
the 1984 Democratic National Con
vention, Moscone Center houses an
exhibit hall, 41 meeting rooms, a
ballroom and a special events
theater. The facility is named after
the late mayor of San Francisco,
who was assassinated by then San
Francisco Supervisor Dan White.
Ghiradelli Square — Here is
where 19th-century laborers once
made chocolate, packaged spices
and wove fine woolens. Twentieth
century visitors to Ghiradelli
Square now browse in the Mustard
Building, watch street performers
in the plaza next to the Woolen
Building and buy Ghiradelli
(pronounced Gear-ar-dely) choco
late in the old Chocolate Building.
The brick buildings of the old fac
tory were restored in 1962, setting
an example for urban reclamation all
over the world.
Golden Gate Bridge — Visitors
are sometimes disappointed to dis
cover the bridge is not so-named
because it is painted gold but be
cause the sun sets in the Golden
Gate ... but not always. The Gate
is often "socked in" by fog, to the
dismay of tourists dressed for Cali
fornia sun.
Japan Town/Center — Japan
Center and the revitalized Japan
Town join to create a mecca for the
thousands of Japanese businessmen
and tourists who visit San Francisco
each year. The complex of hotels,
theaters, shops and restaurants of
fer some of the best saimen
noodles and electronic goods this
side of the Pacific.
Lombard Street — This twister
descends Russian Hill from Hyde
Street, with 10 hairpin turns in a
single block. Constructed, some
say, by a mischievous city planner,
the street now terrifies student
drivers.
Mission Delores — Father
Junipero Serra founded this mission
in 1776 as part of Spain's coloniza
tion effort in the New World.
During his lifetime, this Franciscan
missionary started a whole chain of
missions stretching along El
Camino Real — "The King's High
way" — all the way to Baja, Califor
nia.
Nob Hill — The exclusive
Commonwealth Club, the lavish
Fairmont Hotel, the Huntington
Hotel, four-star restaurant Alexis
and apartments with rents as spec

tacular as their views. All these at
tract San Francisco's glitterati to
Nob Hill, one of the City's most ele
gant spots.
Old Mint — Though it was
phased out of operation in 1937, the
Old Mint was revamped and
reopened as a museum in 1973. Its
exhibits include period rooms, a
pyramid of gold bars, Old West ar
tifacts, the mint's Special Coins and
Metals Division and monetary
treasures of all kinds.
The Palace of Fine Arts —
Created as the diadem of the 1915
Pacific Exposition, a central
rotunda embracing a Corinthian
colonnade ornamented with freizes
and statuary constitute the Palace.
By the 19505, these original plaster
structures had been reduced to
ruins by the wind's sweeping
through the Golden Gate. During
the '60s, a sentimental movement
mobilized to have the monument
restored in pre-cast concrete. The
supporting buildings now house the
Exploratorium, a "hands-on" sci
ence museum.
Pier 39 — Pier 39 surrounds its
mall of shops and restaurants with

the trappings of a turn-of-the
century street scene. Built on a
1,000-foot-long pier, the mall offers
sweeping views of the Bay and the
City.
Polk Street — In the pre
supermarket era, this avenue once
supported a posh shopping district
catering to the well-to-do residents
of Russian Hill and Nob Hill. Bath
houses and gay activists have since
supplanted the fur-coated
housewives and chic shops. Though
the shops have changed with the
local tastes and demands, many fas
hionable boutiques and gourmet
restaurants still line Polk Street.
Transamerica Pyramid — The
tallest building in the San Francisco
skyline, the 48 stories of the
Pyramid slant skyward to form an
unusual "skysaving" wedge. This
design, a company symbol for the
Transamerica Corporation, and the
building's juxtaposition with the
low-rise Jackson Square, caused
considerable controversy.
Twin Peaks — A cliche necking
and drinking hangout Friday and
Saturday nights, Twin Peaks offers

an intoxicating vista of the Bay Area
from the Marin headlands to the
Santa Clara Valley. During the day,
a drive around the figure-eight road
that collars the peaks is an excellent
way to get your bearings on a first
trip.
Union Square — This is San
Francisco's Fifth Avenue. Some of
the City's most swank shops and
hotels — I. Magnin's (complete
with a marble-paneled, gold
fixtured bathroom), Saks Fifth Ave
nue, the Hotel St. Francis,
Elizabeth Arden's — front the
square or the nearby streets.
Washington Square — School
girls coming out of confession in the
adjacent Church of Saints Peter and
Paul, grandfathers feeding the
pigeons and hucksters from the
red-light district on the nearby
Broadway all circulate through the
piazza of San Francisco's "Little
Italy," the North Beach District.
After gorging on pasta in one of the
excellent area cafes, visit Washing
ton Square to digest your meal and
soak up some of the local color.

Sitting majestically on Telegraph Hill, Coit Tower serves as a symbol of San Francisco. Climb to
the top to see a breathtaking view of the City.
A Stanford education is incom
plete without visiting some of the
more popular tourist spots in the
City. Listed below are San Fran
cisco's most famous attractions.
Just remember: No matter how
hot it gets here, it's probably con
siderably cooler in San Francisco,
so dress warmly.
And take a camera.
Alcatraz — Known as "The
Rock," Alcatraz claims most of its
fame from the time it was a Devil's
Island-style federal penitentiary
that housed such notable criminals
as "The Bird Man" and A 1 Capone.
The island also has been used as a
fortification, a U.S. military prison,
an Army disciplinary barracks and a
Native American stronghold. The
National Park Service conducts
two-hour tours from the
waterfront, but be warned that this
is one of the City's most popular at
tractions. Reservations are hard to
secure.
Cable Cars — It's been a couple
years since they have been operat
ing after an 18-month hiatus, and
they're running smoothly. To many
San Franciscans, the cars are more
than a means of transportation:
they're a way of life.
Bank of America World
Headquarters — The Bank of
America complex occupies an
entire downtown block, complete
with a formal plaza dominated by a
black granite sculpture known lo
cally as "The Banker's Heart."
Completed in 1969, thousands of
movie-goers witnessed an early
demise of the Bank of America
building in the movie, "The Tower
ing Inferno."
California Palace of the Le
gion of Honor — The Palace,
perched close to Land's End in the
western part of the City, houses an
extensive collection of Rodin
bronzes, including "The Thinker."
The Cannery — A defunct Del
Monte cannery transformed into a
galleria of shops and restaurants,
The Cannery continues the
Ghiradelli tradition of urban
redevelopment. Mimes and
musicians perform regularly in the
complex's square.
Chinatown — A long-time resi
dent of Hong Kong once said that
San Francisco's Chinatown
reminded him of home — the rush
hour traffic jams on the main
thoroughfare, Grant Avenue,
rivaled any bicycle or automobile

tie-up a Chinese a city could
muster. But Grant Avenue also of
fers a kaleidoscope of Asian
delights — dim sum bars, restau
rants, pharmacies displaying
pickled snake, people inspecting
the Chinese cabbage in front of
grocery stores while pressed ducks
hang in the windows. The streets
radiating out from Grant Avenue
house one of the largest Chinese
populations outside of China and af
ford plenty of opportunities for ex
ploring.
Civic Center — After the 1906
earthquake and fire, city planners
wanted to remake San Francisco
into a modern Athens. The Civic
Center is only a small part of the
elaborate complex planned. San
Franciscans boast that City Hall,
with its ornamented dome, gar
goyled finials and marble
balustrade, is the finest example of
French Romanesque architecture
outside of Europe. The elaborate
federal and state office buildings,
Civic Auditorium, Brooks Exhibit
Hall, Public Library and Performing
Art Center echo this traditional
theme. The glass and concrete
Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall is
a modern departure.
Coit Tower/Telegraph Hill —
The Bohemian section of San Fran
cisco, the circuitous streets and
cliff-hanging houses of Telegraph
Hill, has been inhabited by succes
sive generations of flower children,
artists and literati. The upper area
around Coit Tower, a monument to
the the City's early volunteer
firefighters, has developed into a
patchwork of posh apartments.
Ferry Building — In the days
before rush-hour traffic clogged the
Bay and Golden Gate Bridges, the
ferry building annually processed
more than 50 million commuters
from the East Bay and Marin
County. Today, a Bay Bridge ap
proach obscures this monument at
the foot of Market Street. Although
the Golden Gate Ferry operates
out of its south side, most of the
building is now used as office space.
Fisherman's Wharf — Salty
fishermen, seagulls and the pungent
smell of freshly cleaned fish once
dominated San Francisco's wharf.
Although the nearby slips still berth
trawlers, the surrounding wharf
area has been taken over by wax
museums, carnival-type rides and
tourist shops. Yet the 19th century
museum ship Balclutha harks back

to old days, and some of the City's
best restaurants are still to be
found along "The Wharf."
Fort Point — this three-tiered
brick fort at one time held vigil over
the Golden Gate against invaders.
Now dwarfed by the Golden Gate
Bridge, the building has been made
a national historic site. Tours are
conducted between 10 a.m. and 5
p.m.
49 Mile Drive — This half-day
tour is a planned drive through the
most famous landmarks of the City.
An excellent introduction to San
Francisco, the route starts on Van
Ness Avenue at the Civic Center
and is clearly marked by blue and
white seagull signs.
George R. Moscone Conven
tion Center — A $126 million af
firmation that San Francisco is
indeed a tourist town. The site of
the 1984 Democratic National Con
vention, Moscone Center houses an
exhibit hall, 41 meeting rooms, a
ballroom and a special events
theater. The facility is named after
the late mayor of San Francisco,
who was assassinated by then San
Francisco Supervisor Dan White.
Ghiradelli Square — Here is
where 19th-century laborers once
made chocolate, packaged spices
and wove fine woolens. Twentieth
century visitors to Ghiradelli
Square now browse in the Mustard
Building, watch street performers
in the plaza next to the Woolen
Building and buy Ghiradelli
(pronounced Gear-ar-dely) choco
late in the old Chocolate Building.
The brick buildings of the old fac
tory were restored in 1962, setting
an example for urban reclamation all
over the world.
Golden Gate Bridge — Visitors
are sometimes disappointed to dis
cover the bridge is not so-named
because it is painted gold but be
cause the sun sets in the Golden
Gate ... but not always. The Gate
is often "socked in" by fog, to the
dismay of tourists dressed for Cali
fornia sun.
Japan Town/Center — Japan
Center and the revitalized Japan
Town join to create a mecca for the
thousands of Japanese businessmen
and tourists who visit San Francisco
each year. The complex of hotels,
theaters, shops and restaurants of
fer some of the best saimen
noodles and electronic goods this
side of the Pacific.
Lombard Street — This twister
descends Russian Hill from Hyde
Street, with 10 hairpin turns in a
single block. Constructed, some
say, by a mischievous city planner,
the street now terrifies student
drivers.
Mission Delores — Father
Junipero Serra founded this mission
in 1776 as part of Spain's coloniza
tion effort in the New World.
During his lifetime, this Franciscan
missionary started a whole chain of
missions stretching along El
Camino Real — "The King's High
way" — all the way to Baja, Califor
nia.
Nob Hill — The exclusive
Commonwealth Club, the lavish
Fairmont Hotel, the Huntington
Hotel, four-star restaurant Alexis
and apartments with rents as spec

tacular as their views. All these at
tract San Francisco's glitterati to
Nob Hill, one of the City's most ele
gant spots.
Old Mint — Though it was
phased out of operation in 1937, the
Old Mint was revamped and
reopened as a museum in 1973. Its
exhibits include period rooms, a
pyramid of gold bars, Old West ar
tifacts, the mint's Special Coins and
Metals Division and monetary
treasures of all kinds.
The Palace of Fine Arts —
Created as the diadem of the 1915
Pacific Exposition, a central
rotunda embracing a Corinthian
colonnade ornamented with freizes
and statuary constitute the Palace.
By the 19505, these original plaster
structures had been reduced to
ruins by the wind's sweeping
through the Golden Gate. During
the '60s, a sentimental movement
mobilized to have the monument
restored in pre-cast concrete. The
supporting buildings now house the
Exploratorium, a "hands-on" sci
ence museum.
Pier 39 — Pier 39 surrounds its
mall of shops and restaurants with

the trappings of a turn-of-the
century street scene. Built on a
1,000-foot-long pier, the mall offers
sweeping views of the Bay and the
City.
Polk Street — In the pre
supermarket era, this avenue once
supported a posh shopping district
catering to the well-to-do residents
of Russian Hill and Nob Hill. Bath
houses and gay activists have since
supplanted the fur-coated
housewives and chic shops. Though
the shops have changed with the
local tastes and demands, many fas
hionable boutiques and gourmet
restaurants still line Polk Street.
Transamerica Pyramid — The
tallest building in the San Francisco
skyline, the 48 stories of the
Pyramid slant skyward to form an
unusual "skysaving" wedge. This
design, a company symbol for the
Transamerica Corporation, and the
building's juxtaposition with the
low-rise Jackson Square, caused
considerable controversy.
Twin Peaks — A cliche necking
and drinking hangout Friday and
Saturday nights, Twin Peaks offers

an intoxicating vista of the Bay Area
from the Marin headlands to the
Santa Clara Valley. During the day,
a drive around the figure-eight road
that collars the peaks is an excellent
way to get your bearings on a first
trip.
Union Square — This is San
Francisco's Fifth Avenue. Some of
the City's most swank shops and
hotels — I. Magnin's (complete
with a marble-paneled, gold
fixtured bathroom), Saks Fifth Ave
nue, the Hotel St. Francis,
Elizabeth Arden's — front the
square or the nearby streets.
Washington Square — School
girls coming out of confession in the
adjacent Church of Saints Peter and
Paul, grandfathers feeding the
pigeons and hucksters from the
red-light district on the nearby
Broadway all circulate through the
piazza of San Francisco's "Little
Italy," the North Beach District.
After gorging on pasta in one of the
excellent area cafes, visit Washing
ton Square to digest your meal and
soak up some of the local color.

square or the nearby streets.
Washington Square — School
girls coming out of confession in the
adjacent Church of Saints Peter and
Paul, grandfathers feeding the
pigeons and hucksters from the
red-light district on the nearby
Broadway all circulate through the
piazza of San Francisco's "Little
Italy," the North Beach District.
After gorging on pasta in one of the
excellent area cafes, visit Washing
ton Square to digest your meal and
soak up some of the local color.

Sitting majestically on Telegraph Hill, Coit Tower serves as a symbol of San Francisco. Climb to
the top to see a breathtaking view of the City.
A Stanford education is incom
plete without visiting some of the
more popular tourist spots in the
City. Listed below are San Fran
cisco's most famous attractions.
Just remember: No matter how
hot it gets here, it's probably con
siderably cooler in San Francisco,
so dress warmly.
And take a camera.
Alcatraz — Known as "The
Rock," Alcatraz claims most of its
fame from the time it was a Devil's
Island-style federal penitentiary
that housed such notable criminals
as "The Bird Man" and A 1 Capone.
The island also has been used as a
fortification, a U.S. military prison,
an Army disciplinary barracks and a
Native American stronghold. The
National Park Service conducts
two-hour tours from the
waterfront, but be warned that this
is one of the City's most popular at
tractions. Reservations are hard to
secure.
Cable Cars — It's been a couple
years since they have been operat
ing after an 18-month hiatus, and
they're running smoothly. To many
San Franciscans, the cars are more
than a means of transportation:
they're a way of life.
Bank of America World
Headquarters — The Bank of
America complex occupies an
entire downtown block, complete
with a formal plaza dominated by a
black granite sculpture known lo
cally as "The Banker's Heart."
Completed in 1969, thousands of
movie-goers witnessed an early
demise of the Bank of America
building in the movie, "The Tower
ing Inferno."
California Palace of the Le
gion of Honor — The Palace,
perched close to Land's End in the
western part of the City, houses an
extensive collection of Rodin
bronzes, including "The Thinker."
The Cannery — A defunct Del
Monte cannery transformed into a
galleria of shops and restaurants,
The Cannery continues the
Ghiradelli tradition of urban
redevelopment. Mimes and
musicians perform regularly in the
complex's square.
Chinatown — A long-time resi
dent of Hong Kong once said that
San Francisco's Chinatown
reminded him of home — the rush
hour traffic jams on the main
thoroughfare, Grant Avenue,
rivaled any bicycle or automobile

tie-up a Chinese a city could
muster. But Grant Avenue also of
fers a kaleidoscope of Asian
delights — dim sum bars, restau
rants, pharmacies displaying
pickled snake, people inspecting
the Chinese cabbage in front of
grocery stores while pressed ducks
hang in the windows. The streets
radiating out from Grant Avenue
house one of the largest Chinese
populations outside of China and af
ford plenty of opportunities for ex
ploring.
Civic Center — After the 1906
earthquake and fire, city planners
wanted to remake San Francisco
into a modern Athens. The Civic
Center is only a small part of the
elaborate complex planned. San
Franciscans boast that City Hall,
with its ornamented dome, gar
goyled finials and marble
balustrade, is the finest example of
French Romanesque architecture
outside of Europe. The elaborate
federal and state office buildings,
Civic Auditorium, Brooks Exhibit
Hall, Public Library and Performing
Art Center echo this traditional
theme. The glass and concrete
Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall is
a modern departure.
Coit Tower/Telegraph Hill —
The Bohemian section of San Fran
cisco, the circuitous streets and
cliff-hanging houses of Telegraph
Hill, has been inhabited by succes
sive generations of flower children,
artists and literati. The upper area
around Coit Tower, a monument to
the the City's early volunteer
firefighters, has developed into a
patchwork of posh apartments.
Ferry Building — In the days
before rush-hour traffic clogged the
Bay and Golden Gate Bridges, the
ferry building annually processed
more than 50 million commuters
from the East Bay and Marin
County. Today, a Bay Bridge ap
proach obscures this monument at
the foot of Market Street. Although
the Golden Gate Ferry operates
out of its south side, most of the
building is now used as office space.
Fisherman's Wharf — Salty
fishermen, seagulls and the pungent
smell of freshly cleaned fish once
dominated San Francisco's wharf.
Although the nearby slips still berth
trawlers, the surrounding wharf
area has been taken over by wax
museums, carnival-type rides and
tourist shops. Yet the 19th century
museum ship Balclutha harks back

to old days, and some of the City's
best restaurants are still to be
found along "The Wharf."
Fort Point — this three-tiered
brick fort at one time held vigil over
the Golden Gate against invaders.
Now dwarfed by the Golden Gate
Bridge, the building has been made
a national historic site. Tours are
conducted between 10 a.m. and 5
p.m.
49 Mile Drive — This half-day
tour is a planned drive through the
most famous landmarks of the City.
An excellent introduction to San
Francisco, the route starts on Van
Ness Avenue at the Civic Center
and is clearly marked by blue and
white seagull signs.
George R. Moscone Conven
tion Center — A $126 million af
firmation that San Francisco is
indeed a tourist town. The site of
the 1984 Democratic National Con
vention, Moscone Center houses an
exhibit hall, 41 meeting rooms, a
ballroom and a special events
theater. The facility is named after
the late mayor of San Francisco,
who was assassinated by then San
Francisco Supervisor Dan White.
Ghiradelli Square — Here is
where 19th-century laborers once
made chocolate, packaged spices
and wove fine woolens. Twentieth
century visitors to Ghiradelli
Square now browse in the Mustard
Building, watch street performers
in the plaza next to the Woolen
Building and buy Ghiradelli
(pronounced Gear-ar-dely) choco
late in the old Chocolate Building.
The brick buildings of the old fac
tory were restored in 1962, setting
an example for urban reclamation all
over the world.
Golden Gate Bridge — Visitors
are sometimes disappointed to dis
cover the bridge is not so-named
because it is painted gold but be
cause the sun sets in the Golden
Gate ... but not always. The Gate
is often "socked in" by fog, to the
dismay of tourists dressed for Cali
fornia sun.
Japan Town/Center — Japan
Center and the revitalized Japan
Town join to create a mecca for the
thousands of Japanese businessmen
and tourists who visit San Francisco
each year. The complex of hotels,
theaters, shops and restaurants of
fer some of the best saimen
noodles and electronic goods this
side of the Pacific.
Lombard Street — This twister
descends Russian Hill from Hyde
Street, with 10 hairpin turns in a
single block. Constructed, some
say, by a mischievous city planner,
the street now terrifies student
drivers.
Mission Delores — Father
Junipero Serra founded this mission
in 1776 as part of Spain's coloniza
tion effort in the New World.
During his lifetime, this Franciscan
missionary started a whole chain of
missions stretching along El
Camino Real — "The King's High
way" — all the way to Baja, Califor
nia.
Nob Hill — The exclusive
Commonwealth Club, the lavish
Fairmont Hotel, the Huntington
Hotel, four-star restaurant Alexis
and apartments with rents as spec

tacular as their views. All these at
tract San Francisco's glitterati to
Nob Hill, one of the City's most ele
gant spots.
Old Mint — Though it was
phased out of operation in 1937, the
Old Mint was revamped and
reopened as a museum in 1973. Its
exhibits include period rooms, a
pyramid of gold bars, Old West ar
tifacts, the mint's Special Coins and
Metals Division and monetary
treasures of all kinds.
The Palace of Fine Arts —
Created as the diadem of the 1915
Pacific Exposition, a central
rotunda embracing a Corinthian
colonnade ornamented with freizes
and statuary constitute the Palace.
By the 19505, these original plaster
structures had been reduced to
ruins by the wind's sweeping
through the Golden Gate. During
the '60s, a sentimental movement
mobilized to have the monument
restored in pre-cast concrete. The
supporting buildings now house the
Exploratorium, a "hands-on" sci
ence museum.
Pier 39 — Pier 39 surrounds its
mall of shops and restaurants with

the trappings of a turn-of-the
century street scene. Built on a
1,000-foot-long pier, the mall offers
sweeping views of the Bay and the
City.
Polk Street — In the pre
supermarket era, this avenue once
supported a posh shopping district
catering to the well-to-do residents
of Russian Hill and Nob Hill. Bath
houses and gay activists have since
supplanted the fur-coated
housewives and chic shops. Though
the shops have changed with the
local tastes and demands, many fas
hionable boutiques and gourmet
restaurants still line Polk Street.
Transamerica Pyramid — The
tallest building in the San Francisco
skyline, the 48 stories of the
Pyramid slant skyward to form an
unusual "skysaving" wedge. This
design, a company symbol for the
Transamerica Corporation, and the
building's juxtaposition with the
low-rise Jackson Square, caused
considerable controversy.
Twin Peaks — A cliche necking
and drinking hangout Friday and
Saturday nights, Twin Peaks offers

an intoxicating vista of the Bay Area
from the Marin headlands to the
Santa Clara Valley. During the day,
a drive around the figure-eight road
that collars the peaks is an excellent
way to get your bearings on a first
trip.
Union Square — This is San
Francisco's Fifth Avenue. Some of
the City's most swank shops and
hotels — I. Magnin's (complete
with a marble-paneled, gold
fixtured bathroom), Saks Fifth Ave
nue, the Hotel St. Francis,
Elizabeth Arden's — front the
square or the nearby streets.
Washington Square — School
girls coming out of confession in the
adjacent Church of Saints Peter and
Paul, grandfathers feeding the
pigeons and hucksters from the
red-light district on the nearby
Broadway all circulate through the
piazza of San Francisco's "Little
Italy," the North Beach District.
After gorging on pasta in one of the
excellent area cafes, visit Washing
ton Square to digest your meal and
soak up some of the local color.
