# Leave the Driving to Them
## 
### 
As your horizons extend beyond the Farm and
even beyond Palo Alto they reach northward to
San Francisco. The perfect day in the City forms
in your mind, but you quickly dismiss the idea
since you, like many of us, have no wheels.
Suddenly San Francisco seems very far away,
much farther than when you were deciding
whether to come to Stanford and you read in the
pre-enrollment propaganda that said "San Fran
cisco is 35 miles to the north and offers the urban
pleasures of theaters, galleries, restaurants and
an extensive shopping district."
If you feel your desire to travel north stifled by
your lack of a car, you'll be happy to know that
there are other inexpensive and convenient
ways to get there.
The most easily accessible transportation to
the City is the SamTrans bus that departs from
the El Camino Real bus stop across from the
Stanford Shopping Center. From there, the 7F
bus line follows Highway 101 which, although not
the most scenic route, costs only $1.45 each
way.
Buses begin the hourly trip to San Francisco
at 5:17 a.m. on weekdays and at 7:07 a.m. on
weekends. After 8:37 a.m. buses run every half
hour until 6:07 p.m., when they return to hourly
departures with the last bus leaving at 12:05
a.m.
The travel time by bus is nearly twice that of
driving, but the hour and one-half passes more
quickly if shared with a book, Walkman or friend.
Be prepared to stand if you ride during com
muter hours.
When you arrive at the downtown stop Eighth
and Mission (near the Civic Center) or First and
Mission, the City aura hits you and the image of
the long bus ride quickly fades. Don't forget that
the last bus back to Palo Alto leaves First and
Mission at 12:49 a.m. and that the south-bound
buses leave from Seventh and Mission instead of
Eighth.
Earlier, the homeward bound 7F buses leave

every 30 minutes until 3:18 p.m., when they
start leaving once an hour. At 5:59 p.m. they
return to 30 minute intervals.
If you really want to "get into" the Bay Area
commuting scene, you may want to consider
taking BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) into the
City. But since the closest BART station to
Stanford is in Daly City, using Bart first entails
finding transportation to Daly City — about 20
miles north of campus on Interstate 280.
Beginning at 6:00 a.m., the 5L SamTrans bus
line leaves the Palo Alto Southern Pacific railway
station every 20-30 minutes and stops at the
Daly City Bart Station. The trip costs less than a
dollar, but the stop-and-go route takes about an
hour and a half.
One practical advantage of using BART is that
it offers special bicycle permits including tempo
rary, one-time passes. But since neither the bus
nor the train allows bikes, you need to hitch a
ride with your bike to Daly City. If your bike col
lapses at the frame, you don't need a special per
mit to take it on BART.
BART, with its space-age appearance and
automation — replete with machines that sell
tickets that whiz through slots and magically
open gates — is the pride of the Bay Area.
Boarding for the 20-minute ride is self
explanatory, as well-lit signs mark the way. The
price varies on your precise destination.
The seven downtown stations are all under
ground and centrally located: Four along Market
Street, two on Mission Street and one near San
Francisco City College at Geneva and San Jose
Streets.
BART runs every 15-20 minutes from 6 a.m.
until midnight Monday through Saturday and
from 9 a.m. until midnight on Sundays. BART is
still fairly new and promises a swift and comfort
able entry to downtown.
If buses make you sick and you think BART is
too robotic, there is always the train. The
CalTrain leaves from the Southern Pacific Depot
off University Avenue — a short bike ride from

campus. Don't forget to lock your bike securely
before abandoning it for the day, or you may end
up walking home.
The train is more expensive than the other
methods of transport, with a one-way ticket cos
ting $3.20 and a round trip $6.40, but it tends to
be more comfortable and roomy than the bus.
After a smattering of dawn departures, the
train's schedule eases into what vaguely
resembles hourly departures from 8:26 a.m. un
til 10:26 p.m., with a few extra trips thrown in.
The downtown stop is at Fourth and Townsend,
fairly far from centers of interest, but along the
city bus routes.
The combined network of cable cars, the mini
metro and regular buses make up the City's
transportation system — better know as MUNI.
Along such routes, MUNI can get you from
your depot (no matter which transportation you
choose) to within a short walk of anywhere you
want to go in the City. Rides start at 35 cents
each, but if you ask for a transfer ticket when
you embark, you can change buses without
repaying. If you arrive by BART, remember to
pick up your two free transfers, which allow you
free MUNI rides to and from the BART station.
Pick them up before you exit the fare gates.
Some of the mini metro can be boarded under
ground, beneath BART, while the other buses
are on street level. Don't forget to bring exact
change.
Whatever mode of transportation you choose,
always call to check fares and schedules before
you leave. San Francisco is a lot of fun most of
the time, but not when you're stuck there at 4
a.m. with no way home. These numbers should
keep you out of that sort of trouble.

departures with the last bus leaving at 12:05
a.m.
The travel time by bus is nearly twice that of
driving, but the hour and one-half passes more
quickly if shared with a book, Walkman or friend.
Be prepared to stand if you ride during com
muter hours.
When you arrive at the downtown stop Eighth
and Mission (near the Civic Center) or First and
Mission, the City aura hits you and the image of
the long bus ride quickly fades. Don't forget that
the last bus back to Palo Alto leaves First and
Mission at 12:49 a.m. and that the south-bound
buses leave from Seventh and Mission instead of
Eighth.
Earlier, the homeward bound 7F buses leave

every 30 minutes until 3:18 p.m., when they
start leaving once an hour. At 5:59 p.m. they
return to 30 minute intervals.
If you really want to "get into" the Bay Area
commuting scene, you may want to consider
taking BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) into the
City. But since the closest BART station to
Stanford is in Daly City, using Bart first entails
finding transportation to Daly City — about 20
miles north of campus on Interstate 280.
Beginning at 6:00 a.m., the 5L SamTrans bus
line leaves the Palo Alto Southern Pacific railway
station every 20-30 minutes and stops at the
Daly City Bart Station. The trip costs less than a
dollar, but the stop-and-go route takes about an
hour and a half.
One practical advantage of using BART is that
it offers special bicycle permits including tempo
rary, one-time passes. But since neither the bus
nor the train allows bikes, you need to hitch a
ride with your bike to Daly City. If your bike col
lapses at the frame, you don't need a special per
mit to take it on BART.
BART, with its space-age appearance and
automation — replete with machines that sell
tickets that whiz through slots and magically
open gates — is the pride of the Bay Area.
Boarding for the 20-minute ride is self
explanatory, as well-lit signs mark the way. The
price varies on your precise destination.
The seven downtown stations are all under
ground and centrally located: Four along Market
Street, two on Mission Street and one near San
Francisco City College at Geneva and San Jose
Streets.
BART runs every 15-20 minutes from 6 a.m.
until midnight Monday through Saturday and
from 9 a.m. until midnight on Sundays. BART is
still fairly new and promises a swift and comfort
able entry to downtown.
If buses make you sick and you think BART is
too robotic, there is always the train. The
CalTrain leaves from the Southern Pacific Depot
off University Avenue — a short bike ride from

campus. Don't forget to lock your bike securely
before abandoning it for the day, or you may end
up walking home.
The train is more expensive than the other
methods of transport, with a one-way ticket cos
ting $3.20 and a round trip $6.40, but it tends to
be more comfortable and roomy than the bus.
After a smattering of dawn departures, the
train's schedule eases into what vaguely
resembles hourly departures from 8:26 a.m. un
til 10:26 p.m., with a few extra trips thrown in.
The downtown stop is at Fourth and Townsend,
fairly far from centers of interest, but along the
city bus routes.
The combined network of cable cars, the mini
metro and regular buses make up the City's
transportation system — better know as MUNI.
Along such routes, MUNI can get you from
your depot (no matter which transportation you
choose) to within a short walk of anywhere you
want to go in the City. Rides start at 35 cents
each, but if you ask for a transfer ticket when
you embark, you can change buses without
repaying. If you arrive by BART, remember to
pick up your two free transfers, which allow you
free MUNI rides to and from the BART station.
Pick them up before you exit the fare gates.
Some of the mini metro can be boarded under
ground, beneath BART, while the other buses
are on street level. Don't forget to bring exact
change.
Whatever mode of transportation you choose,
always call to check fares and schedules before
you leave. San Francisco is a lot of fun most of
the time, but not when you're stuck there at 4
a.m. with no way home. These numbers should
keep you out of that sort of trouble.

Cable cars are truly a San Francisco treat. A ride on one lets
you see the sights — while it gets you to where you want to go
in the City.
As your horizons extend beyond the Farm and
even beyond Palo Alto they reach northward to
San Francisco. The perfect day in the City forms
in your mind, but you quickly dismiss the idea
since you, like many of us, have no wheels.
Suddenly San Francisco seems very far away,
much farther than when you were deciding
whether to come to Stanford and you read in the
pre-enrollment propaganda that said "San Fran
cisco is 35 miles to the north and offers the urban
pleasures of theaters, galleries, restaurants and
an extensive shopping district."
If you feel your desire to travel north stifled by
your lack of a car, you'll be happy to know that
there are other inexpensive and convenient
ways to get there.
The most easily accessible transportation to
the City is the SamTrans bus that departs from
the El Camino Real bus stop across from the
Stanford Shopping Center. From there, the 7F
bus line follows Highway 101 which, although not
the most scenic route, costs only $1.45 each
way.
Buses begin the hourly trip to San Francisco
at 5:17 a.m. on weekdays and at 7:07 a.m. on
weekends. After 8:37 a.m. buses run every half
hour until 6:07 p.m., when they return to hourly
departures with the last bus leaving at 12:05
a.m.
The travel time by bus is nearly twice that of
