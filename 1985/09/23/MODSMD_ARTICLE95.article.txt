# University Libraries... 'A Home Away From Home'
## 
### 
During your first week on
campus, you'll be so busy meeting
your roommates and new friends,
going to orientation activities,
buying books and worrying about
classes that you probably won't get
around to taking the 20-minute
guided tour of Meyer Undergradu
ate Library.
But sooner or later you will prob
ably wander there and ask an array
of questions about using libraries on
campus. This article, a brief over
view of the libraries available to stu
dents here, should provide you with
an introduction to what may prove
to be your favorite refuge from the
noise and constant activity of your
dormitory.
Eleven University libraries and
six coordinate libraries present stu

dents with a vast store of informa
tion, including manuscripts, maps,
sound recordings, periodicals,
microtexts, photographs, govern
ment documents and more than 4.5
million books.
About half of all library staffers
here work at Green Library. Green
contains a general reference ser
vice, the University Archives, the
Current Periodicals and Microtexts
room, the government documents
collection, the Central Map collec
tion, a section called Special Collec
tions and the main research
collection of the University libra
ries.
In Special Collections, students
can examine such diverse materials
as Shakespeare's folios and the per

sonal correspondence of John Stein
beck.
Green is one of the more modern
libraries here (the East Wing was
completed in 1980). Students must
show identification to gain entry.
Inside Green Library are lock
ers, study carrels, countless
shelves of books and incredibly
comfortable chairs. Since Green
has more space than all the other li
braries on campus, there is usually
a good chance of finding a free
semi-isolated desk or chair at which
to do serious studying.
Meyer Undergraduate Library,
known by the pseudo-acronym
UGLY, contains language laborato
ries, audio-visual services, a

periodicals room, a file containing
copies of midterm and final exams
for various courses, lockers and
carrels — and it is the only place one
can obtain reserve readings as
signed for undergraduate classes.
Meyer also has several Copicard
copying machines, electric and
manual typewriters and personal
computers for student use.
Undergraduates tend to favor
Meyer over other libraries because
the reserve reading and most of
their friends are always there. As a
result of the wild throngs that pop
ulate the three study floors and
Meyer's collection of the loudest
pieces of furniture ever assembled
under one roof, Meyer is much

noisier than nearby Green Library.
The Art and Architecture Li
brary, in the Nathan Cummings Art
Building, contains books on art and
architectural history, paintings, a
special Chinese art collection and
interesting graphic art.
The Frederic M. Falconer Biol
ogy Library, on the third floor of
Herrin Hall in the Biological
Sciences Center, holds various ma
terials on botany, zoology and ex
perimental fields of biology.
The Swain Library of Chemistry,
in Room One of the old Chemistry
Building, has numerous books on
chemistry and materials about the
chemical and petroleum industries.
The Cubberley Library of Educa
tion on the second floor of the Edu
cation building offers books,
documents, periodicals, pamphlets,
microforms, dissertations and other
materials on education.

The Branner Earth Sciences Li
brary, on the second floor of the
Mitchell Earth Sciences Building,
has materials on geology, geo
physics, mineral and petroleum engi
neering, geological maps, U.S.
Geological Survey topographical
sheets, a stunning mineral collec
tion and a more powerful air coolant
system than is found in most
refrigerators.
The Engineering Library, in Ter
man Engineering Center, has an
enormous collection of books on en
gineering. The Guggenheim Space
Sciences Library contains collec
tions on aeronautics and
astronautics, radio science and
electrical engineering.
The Mathematical and Computer
Science Library, in Room 384 of the
Quad, has books on math, statistics
and computer theory and applica
tion.

The grass always looks Greener on the other side. While daydreaming in Green, you can stare
out the window to this view of Meyer Library.
