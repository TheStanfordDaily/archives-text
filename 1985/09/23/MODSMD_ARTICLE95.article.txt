# University Libraries... 'A Home Away From Home'
## 
### 
During your first week on
campus, you'll be so busy meeting
your roommates and new friends,
going to orientation activities,
buying books and worrying about
classes that you probably won't get
around to taking the 20-minute
guided tour of Meyer Undergradu
ate Library.
But sooner or later you will prob

of questions about using libraries on
campus. This article, a brief over
view of the libraries available to stu

an introduction to what may prove
to be your favorite refuge from the
noise and constant activity of your
dormitory.
Eleven University libraries and
six coordinate libraries present stu

sound recordings, periodicals,
microtexts, photographs, govern

million books.
About half of all library staffers
here work at Green Library. Green
contains a general reference ser
vice, the University Archives, the
Current Periodicals and Microtexts
room, the government documents
collection, the Central Map collec

tions and the main research
collection of the University libra

In Special Collections, students
can examine such diverse materials
as Shakespeare's folios and the per

sonal correspondence of John Stein
beck.
Green is one of the more modern
libraries here (the East Wing was
completed in 1980). Students must
show identification to gain entry.
Inside Green Library are lock
ers, study carrels, countless
shelves of books and incredibly
comfortable chairs. Since Green
has more space than all the other li
braries on campus, there is usually
a good chance of finding a free
semi-isolated desk or chair at which
to do serious studying.

Caught in the act... . Sometimes libraries are more conducive to sleep than study. But spacious
Green Library is such a pleasant place to do research and study, why would one want to sleep?
Ask this student if you see him.
