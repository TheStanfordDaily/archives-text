# Bechtel International Center
## From Far Away 
### 
It may be easy for new students to cycle past the
white stucco walls and French windows of the Bechtel
International Center without realizing the wealth of in
formation inside. But the I-Center, located at the inter
section of Mayfield Avenue, is well worth a visit.
New foreign graduate students are especially en
couraged to visit the I-center during orientation week.
The center has planned an elaborate schedule of
events including lectures, tours and dinners for foreign
students and their spouses. The orientation will help
the foreign student become familiar with daily life at on
the Farm — and life in America in general.
Aside from social programs, the center serves an
important educational role. A full-time staff, with the
help of volunteers, provide counseling services to
foreign students, helping them with all immediate
needs such as buying a bicycle or used car or getting
the proper license and insurance.
While the center enables foreign students and
scholars to receive the most from their stay in the
United States, I-Center Director Lee Zeigler said that
it is also valuable for U.S. students. "It is important to

encourage American students who have an interest in
international activities to get acquainted with the I-
Center and become involved, whether to make travel
plans, to practice another language or to form
friendships with people from other countries."
The center has an Overseas Resource Center
(ORC) on the second floor which houses information on
study abroud programs, international travel, employ
ment abroad and international scholarships. The center
also contains many resouces on travel in the United
States.
Zeigler said that working at the center has its
rewards because the visiting students are so bright.
"They are the future leaders in their fields. Those
foreign students that decide to stay in the United
States contribute to our country."
The I-Center is open daily to students and the Stan
ford community. There are informal English classes,
discussion groups on topics of international interest,
lectures and forums, monthly art exhibitions and ex
cursions. Specific schedules of events are listed in The
Daily's "Once Around the Quad."
