# Monterey Bay Beckons to Marine Buffs
## 
### CATHY JANUS 
With the reputation of the Mon
terey Bay Aquarium firmly estab
lished a year after its opening, the
towns of Pacific Grove and Mon
terey have yet another attraction to
offer locals and tourists. Especially
on weekends and holidays, the
crowds are enormous. People line
up for blocks, waiting patiently to
inspect the marvels of bay area
marine life presented with spectac
ular explanations and exhibits.
The recent weather has been
ideal for visiting the area. In addi
tion to the aquarium, Monterey
County is famous for Cannery Row,
Fisherman's Wharf, Stanford's Hop
kins Marine Station, beautiful golf
courses and the coastal shorelines.
The myriad of natural and man
made experiences awaiting visitors
is a wonder to behold.
Passing Fort Ord as you drive
toward Monterey and Carmel, the
scenery changes from rolling dunes
of sand and the blue bay to lush
green forests surrounding the
ocean. To reach Pacific Grove and
Monterey, an ideal route is High
way 68, which winds down to the
ocean and follows the coastline to
Ocean View Boulevard. Once you
reach the coastline, you will be
drawn to the crashing waves and
gulls and seals sunning on the
rocks. Parking along the road is an
option, but it becomes somewhat of
a problem on sunny afternoons
when picnickers and hikers all head
for the beaches. However, once
you find parking everything is
within walking distance, so you
won't have to search anymore.
If you haven't visited the area
previously, you may want to drive
down Highway 17 before going to
the Aquarium and Cannery Row.
Famous around the world, the high
way winds through the forest and
offers breathtaking views of the
coastline, occasional glimpses of

deer and other wildlife, some of the
most beautiful golf courses in the
world and both contemporary and
historic architectural masterpieces
nestled in the hills and along the
coast.
Back at Ocean View Boulevard,
there are a number of things to do.
Cannery Row is crowded with a va
riety of malls offering a range of
goods, including antiques, clothing,
hand-carved furniture and art work,
and a number of restaurants and
delis. There are also a couple of
wine-tasting rooms offering
samples of wines produced in Mon
terey. And if you want more than a
sip, you can buy a bottle and then
stop by the bakery for some fresh
bread or a deli for the other
makings of a picnic. Then take the
path back through town and con
tinue along it as it edges the coast.
Numerous benches and even a park
with picnic tables provide the per
fect setting for a picnic.
As darkness descends on the
town, the streets empty quickly
and the weather turns crisp and
cold. Once the shops and other at
tractions close, there is little to do
except to go out to dinner or a
movie. However, the variety of
restaurants are such that you can
make an evening of simply choosing
which one to try. Having spent the
day appreciating the marine life of
the bay area, it seems only appro
priate to select a restaurant serving
fresh seafood, and what better one
than the Whaling Station Inn Res
taurant? Located one block above
Ocean View Boulevard at 763 Wave
Street, this cozy timbered inn is a
perfect choice.
Upon entering the dimly lit res
taurant through the bar area, the
maitre d' exclaimed his delight at an
additional two guests. We arrived at
7 p.m., but the restaurant did not
fill up until 9. However, it was a
Sunday evening, and reservations
are recommended on Friday and

Saturdays. The number to call is
(408) 373-3778.
In the middle of our table sat a
Castroville artichoke with a special
mayonnaise vinaigrette sauce. This
delicious appetizer accompanies all
meals and was a special treat. Also
included with dinner are daily made
soups, local fresh seasonal
vegetables, salads and bread and
butter. Wines are served by the
bottle, half bottle and glass.
Evening specials are featured in
addition to the regular menu. That
evening the fresh fish included sal
mon, kahala and swordfish barbe
cued over mesquite charcoal. Fresh
abalone was also on the menu that

evening and was in competition
with live Maine lobster as the most
expensive item on the menu at
$24.95. The waiter was enthusias
tic about both of these entrees, and
judging by the number of customers
wearing lobster-decorated bibs, the
lobster certainly seems a popular
selection.
The specialty soup of the house
is a spicy chicken curry with
sprmkles of coconut on top. The
other choice is conventional chicken
soupâ€”a good choice if you don't like
curry. The waiter took our order
and informed us that salads would
be served following the entrees. In
addition to fresh fish and seafood,

pasta, lamb, venison and steaks are
also prepared.
We ordered the abalone and
lobster; our mouths fell open when
the waiter presented the lobster. It
was a bright red, enormous and ex
tremely tender and succulent. The
abalone paled in comparison, al
though it was also delicious. Both
were surrounded by fresh spinach,
cauliflower and carrots.
The waiter returned twice with
clean plates to collect the body of
the lobster. After the entree a salad
or dessert hardly seemed neces
sary. The salads, we were told,
were not any ordinary greens. This
evening's choice was a spinach

salad with sesame dressing or a
Chinese cabbage salad.
Dinner was not over yet,
however. The waiter returned to
our table with the dessert tray,
which displayed an assortment of
cheese cakes, a custard eclair,
Bavarian pudding, white chocolate
mousse, a rum chocolate truffle and
cannoli. All desserts, prepared
fresh daily, cost $3.50. The selec
tion and preparation of the meals,
as well as the attentive and friendly
service, are flawless at the Whaling
Station Inn. An evening spent at
this restaurant is a perfect way to
end an enjoyable day exploring
Monterey.
