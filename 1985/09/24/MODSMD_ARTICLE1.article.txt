# Bug Hinders Registration
## 
### MARY YUH Editorial staff 
Registration staffers realized
yesterday morning that the com
puterized course reservation sys
tem in Maples Pavilion was mal
functioning, according to Marick
Payton, data administrator for Net
work Information Services.
The difficulty has been overcome
and the system is expected to oper
ate satisfactorily today, Payton
said.
The system, a new software
package called PRISM, appeared to
be functioning smoothly until about
9:30 when it became evident that
"course reservation entries were
not being properly recorded into
the database," Payton explained.
A back-up manual system was
then implemented and remained in
operation throughout the day, ac
cording to Payton, who said he ex
pects the bug in PRISM to be cor
rected in the near future. The sys
tem should be able to tolerate a
number of terminals on one ac
count, he explained. "Right now,
we are working around the bug."
Because the course reservation
information provided by students
was in a form readily transferable
from the computer system to the
manual system, Payton said he
believes the first come, first serve
priority for reserving courses was
maintained.
The problem seemed to arise
from the fact that all the computer
terminals used in the course
reservation system were working
on one computer account, Payton
mm if! - -JLLL.4fchauld»'t have been a
problem," he added.
There appears to be a bug in the
software that causes system failure

when there are about nine or more
terminals on the same account, ex
plained Payton.
After the malfunction was discov
ered, staff and technicians created
19 more accounts, intending to use
one terminal per account, Payton
said.
However, they were reluctant to
use the entire system before tests
assured them that the one-account
one-terminal plan was a workable
solution, and only part of the sys
tem used for the remainder of the
day, according to Payton.
Using six terminals, "Western
Civilization and English (course
reservations) continued to operate
on the computer system," Payton
said.
After registration ended yester
day, approximately 30 workers
tested the system and around 7:30
p.m. established that the one
account-one-terminal solution was
workable, Payton said.
The course reservation informa
tion acquired manually was entered
into the database yesterday by
registration staffers — a task that
began in the evening and lasted late
into the night.
PRISM is a software package
that allows many categories of data
to be treated similarly, creating a
standardized, easy-to-use database
system that is useful for offices that
need to handle diverse types of
data, according to Payton.
The University currently stores
over 30 categories of data with
PRISM, including student directory
data, The Store's purchasing data
and hazardous chemical data. The
software has been found useful for
the University President's Office
and for the Bechtel International
Center, Payton said.
