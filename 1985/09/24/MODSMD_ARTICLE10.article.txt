## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Terrorism in Auckland 
### 
After months of denial, the French government
Sunday finally confessed to sinking the flagship of
the environmentalist group Greenpeace, the Rain
bow Warrior. For a government to admit to an act of
terrorism may serve justice, but it is hardly
honorable. In this case, only the efforts of New
Zealand to uncover the truth behind the Rainbow
Warrior debacle reflect a genuine concern for the
law.
It is now known that two French intelligence
agents planted the bombs that sunk the 160-foot
Rainbow Warrior at dockside in Auckland, New
Zealand, killing a Greenpeace photographer. That
the explosions occured on July 10, just before the
Rainbow Warrior was scheduled to take part in a
"peace flotilla" in protest of French nuclear testing
on the South Pacific island ofMururoa, was no coin
cidence, despite earlier efforts by French govern
ment sources to show otherwise.
The officials in President Francois Mitterrand's
administration who planned the Rainbow Warrior
bombing may have seen legitimate reasons in

protecting the security of France's nuclear re
search, but their methods were abhorrent, reduced
to the level of the terrorists whom Western govern
ments repeatedly condemn.
Such "state terrorism" can only serve to justify
the actions of the "real," fanatical terrorist groups
and promote a general sense of lawlessness in an
already violent world. If the legitimizing labels like
"Western government," "state security" and
"intelligence" are removed from the actions of the
French intelligence, there is no difference between
its activity and that of the terrorists who hijacked
the TWA plane in Beirut earlier in the summer. The
French cannot justify condemning a terrorist bomb
ing on the Champs Elysee if it is itself guilty of a
similar action.
In contrast to France, New Zealand pursued a re
sponsible, thorough investigation of the bombing,
continuing to muckrake and question "transparent"
French excuses throughout the two-and-a-half
months. At least New Zealand upheld the standards
to which all reasonable nations supposedly belong.
