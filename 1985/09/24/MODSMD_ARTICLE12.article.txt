## Sandinistas Endanger Democracy 
### 
Drastic changes characterized my freshman
year, a rather difficult one. I felt a lot of frustra
tion as I moved from Costa Rica, a small under
developed nation, to a complex, highly competi
tive society like the United States. Fortunately,
the experience opened my mind. For instance,
the college atmosphere forced me to review in a
more critical way those political views I had pre
viously acquired.

centrations. In those reunions, I learned a great
deal about the main concerns of Costa Ricans.
Like voters in any other electoral process, my
compatriots worry about the state of the eco
nomy, the lack of popular housing, allegations of
governmental corruption and other issues.
However, I noticed that a particular preoccupa
tion has significantly captured the people's atten
tion. Nowadays, most Costa Ricans fear that the
Sandanista government in neighboring Nicaragua
represents a threat to our democratic institu
tions.
While authoritarian military regimes took con
trol of most Latin American countries in the past
four decades, Costa Rica dissolved the armed
forces and invested its resources in develop
ment, health and education. Yet Costa Ricans

VIEWPOINT

As a Central American, I logically pay close at
tention to the events which take place in that
convulsive region. In the United States, quite a
few students share my interest. Nevertheless, a
significant number of those persons seem con
cerned only about the future that awaits
Nicaragua and El Salvador. The neglect that
many individuals show toward a democracy like
Costa Rica worries me. For this reason, last
summer I decided to spend a considerable
amount of time studying the problems that
threaten the political stability of my homeland.
In Costa Rica, voters express themselves in
general elections every four years. In February
1986, Costa Ricans will elect representitives at
the presidential, legislative and municipal levels.
During my vacation, I worked for the National
Liberation Party (PLN), one of the strongest po
litical forces in the country. I volunteered for two
reasons. First, I consider the PLN candidate to
the presidency of the republic one of the best
qualified politicians we have ever had. Second,
the position gave me the opportunity to observe
critically the political mechanisms that enable our
democracy to survive in the midst of the social,
economic and military turmoil that plagues
Central America.
As a member of a special commission within
the party, I participated in several PLN con

never ignored the conditions of hardship in which
many of the residents of surrounding countries
lived. Consequently, when in the late 70s the
Sandinista guerrillas requested assistance in
overthrowing dictator Anastasio Somoza, the
citizens of Costa Rica enthusiastically gave ma
terial and moral support to the insurgents.
Somoza's fall created a lot of expectations, and
Costa Ricans in particular hoped that the Sandi
nistas would truly implement their promises to
establish a pluralistic government. Unfortun
ately, the dream of democracy for our neighbors
soon became a sour nightmare.
Since 1979, the Sandinistas have taken steps

to reproduce Fidel Castro's revolutionary model
in Nicaragua. Initially, the Sandinista Front of
National Liberation consolidated its position with
the purge of the voices of dissent from the ad
ministration. Simultaneously, the new rulers
launched a massive propaganda campaign to dis
tract international attention from the totalitarian
policies that the regime began to implement.
Furthermore, the Nicaraguans witnessed the
suffocation of the private sector and the institu
tion of the an omnipresent military establishment
that, among other things, operates a censorship
office. Inevitably, the structural changes that the
Sandinistas introduced have had negative politi
cal and economic repercussions in the rest of the
Central American community.

satellite intimidates a pacific nation like Costa
Rica because Marxist-Leninist regimes consider
the proliferation of leftist revolutions a national
goal. The virtues of our political system might
not suffice to placate the impetus of the commu
nist expansionist moves unless we can minimize
the impact of the subversive cells that currently
infiltrate our democratic institutions. In this diffi
cult time, Costa Rica definitely needs support
from abroad. Our present situation represents
an opportunity for those people who claim to
stand for democracy to translate their words into
concrete actions.
