USW Demands
Job Security
In yesterday's Daily there was
an article on the negotiations be
tween the United Stanford
Workers (USW) and the Stanford
administration. In that article ad
ministration negotiator Priscilla
Wheeler states that the administra
tion proposals "could (also)
prevent unnecessary lay-offs of
union workers."
In the Sept. 18 issue of the
Campus Report she said "we have
made absolutely no proposals at all
to change any practices in this (job
security) area." We believe these
statements are totally false and
would like the community to judge
for itself. The current contract
says:
Work regularly and customarily
performed by workers shall not be
performed by individuals not in the
bargaining unit to the extent that it
directly results in a worker's layoff
or removal to a lower classifica
tion. If any such incident occurs
the worker shall be compensated
for any loss in regular pay.
This is known as "Paragraph
94." The administration's proposal
is to delete this paragraph and
replace it with language which
allows the union to discuss and
hear "the rationale" for the layoff.
The administration is proposing:
The union and the University
agree that the Joint Committee on
University Union Concerns shall
serve as the appropriate forum to
discuss the utilization by the Uni
versity of contract labor, service
contracts and temporary
employees in carrying out work
regularly and customarily per
formed by workers. At such dis
cussions the University, to the
extent that it is able, ivill provide

the rationale for those utilizations.
How could this proposal prevent
layoffs? Wheeler herself told USW
workers that the administration's
proposal would mean that any
union worker could be laid-off and
replaced with outside contractors
or non-union workers.
All of this raises the issue of the
administration's intentions and
Wheeler's credibility. We can only
assume that they are misrep
resenting their proposals to
strip USW workers of any job se
curity because they feel their posi
tion is morally indefensible. On this
they are right.

US Must Stop
Aiding Israel
If President Reagan is serious
about ending Middle East ter
rorism, he should give three or
four billion a year to the Pales
tinians as compensation for the
homes and land taken from them
by the Zionist invaders. Our gov
ernment is playing with disaster by
creating hostility among hundreds
of millions of Moslems. If we
stopped supporting Zionists, it
might create a little goodwill
among the Moslems and the Arabs.
Certainly these people cannot be
blamed for using the same tactics
America and the Zionists have
used against them for forty years.
If they are behaving like barbarians
as Rabbi Reagan says, they
learned the method from America
and the Zionists. Even American
Jews are becoming alienated from
their Zionist kin by the actions of
the latter.
