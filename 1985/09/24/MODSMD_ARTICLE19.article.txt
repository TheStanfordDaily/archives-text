# Bug Me: The Answer to Your Trivia
## 
### ANDREW McCLUNG 
Now as registration is winding to a close
and you, readers, are resting your already
weary and frustrated eyes on this very
newsprint, 1 hasten to bid you a warm and
refreshing welcome.
For those of you who are the celebrated
and newly arrived frosh, transfers and
graduate students, some introductory in
formation about this column may prove use
ful, and this first barrage of verbiage will
therefore attempt to clarify the purpose and
workings of Bug Me.
For those who, with a sense of grave for
boding, have begun to recognize that my
writing will hew closely to the stylistic in
anities of previous Bug Me writers, please
either bear with me for this week or else go
ahead and turn the page, if you are really
that sort of person.
Bug Me is, most importantly, your
column; it is written exclusively for you,
the reader. It is your forum for getting an
answer to any of those little nagging ques
tions that perpetually, relentlessly follow
you around and ruin your outlook on life as
you become convinced that no one, but no
one, can answer them.
Well relax. I can.
All you have to do is this: a) think of a
question, or preferably, dredge up one of
those that are working day and night to
destroy you mentally; b) write it down and
send it in to me via some suitable medium,
such as the form provided on page seven; and
c) wait for the interminable amount of time
to elapse while I get around to answering it.
Any question of any type is fair game, but
most questions in the past have concerned
either historical facts about Stanford, minor
local problems and complaints that require
some troubleshooting, and miscellaneous

trivia of the most esoteric sort.
To be totally honest, 1 generally refrain
from killing myself to answer some of the
more obscure historical questions. It's not
anything like an ironclad policy, mind you,
but questions like, "Where were all of the
original Stanford family bathrooms located
relative to the modern campus?" might
wind up getting put on the back burner for
awhile.

Such a statement, of course, in no way
compromises my earlier promise about this
being your column, and yours alone. But I
should confess that really choice trivia is
something I savor.
For example, the following are questions
that people in the past have actually sent in,
and which were zealously answered by the
contemporary columnist.
Why was Stern built in its "ugly barracks"
style?
What is the maximum velocity attainable
by a common housefly?
How old is Barbara Walters?

What is the name of Dudley Do-right's
horse?
Is it true that McDonald's shakes do not
contain milk but are made primarily of pe
troleum by-products?
How does one go about obtaining a live
predacious diving beetle?
Why is the vanishing of the Riemann-
Christoffel tensor a necessary and sufficient

A brand-new bug reveals the technology behind
beeping book store doors, the philosophical
ramifications of conservation and more. A new
installment each week. Tune in and get the facts
on the great issues of our time — Dudley
Do-right's horse's name, the maximum velocity
of the common housefly, even Barbara Walters'
age.

condition for the existence of flat space
time?
Let me state at the outset that questions
like the last one will automatically be an
swered with utmost promptness and tire
less effort. Really.
In fact, if one of you out there wants to
ask it again, I will answer it better than it
was answered way back when.
Science trivia, far from being trivial, is
taken very seriously by some of us who at
the same time are busy failing all of our
technical classes.
And now that the format of the column

has been clarified, anyone who is still
reading this can discover the answers to a
couple of questions left over from last year.
Dear Sirs: What is the nature of those
white Formica rectangles on the Stanford
Bookstore checkout counters? You know, the
ones that the person operating the cash regis
ter (or check register, actually) rubs the
spines of books against for no apparent rea
son? - anonymous

According to one of the ladies who works
at the Customer Service counter, that
easily-cleaned, plastic plate is merely a
cover for a device that is designed to com
bat theft.
Evidently, every book in the Stanford
Bookstore inventory has a strip of magnetic
tape running the length of its spine; left
alone this tape would cause a measurable
disturbance in the electric field generated
by two metal bars mounted in the door
jambs of bookstore exits.
Such a disturbance would trigger an
alarm and some bad person would get put in

a big dungeon for a long time.
To avoid this, one has the option of
paying for the book, at which juncture the
kindly cashier vigorously applies the spine
of the book to the Formica plate.
The device under the plate generates an
electric field which realigns the magnetic
particles in the tape into some configuration
suitable for getting the book through the
exit without triggering the alarm.
Here again is electromagnetism at work
for you, ensuring that crime does not pay,
and causing your Walkman to make
bookstore authorities think you are a
shoplifter.
Dear Sirs: Given that most materials that
can be and are recycled are more or less nat
ural substances (viz., paper, glass and alu
minum), wouldn't they, if just dumped
somewhere, eventually decay and be reab
sorbed into nature? Hence, does
"conservation" truly conserve any matter, or
does it only speed up the rate at which matter
is re-used? - anonymous
Since this seems like a philosophical
question, I will take the liberty of philosop
hizing.
Most of what you say is technically true,
but speeding up the rate of re-use turns out
to be a pretty important function of conser
vation.
Of the three substances listed, paper
decays most rapidly, but even that takes a
while in human terms (as the stacks of old
Dailys decomposing soggily throughout
winter quarter attest).
Glass and aluminum that are just dumped
are even more annoyingly stable; they last
for thousands of years if recycled only by
nature.
The stability of these things would not be
a problem but for the fact that we humans

churn them out in such huge quanti
ties, There is less reason to fear
running out of trees and sand and
bauxite than there is to fear the ac
cumulation of all of the processed
items, so the advantage of recycling
is not that it conserves matter, but
litter.
Conserve more, waste less, and
avoid having to find new places to
stow trash all the time.
So ASSU Recycling and the other
agencies do us a favor, since they
help whittle the trash problem
down to one of stashing all of the
things that can't be conveniently
recycled, such as most plastics and
toxic chemicals and nuclear wastes.
These are big enough problems
by themselves for now, so there
does not seem to be much point in
seeing how well we can test the
four-color map theorem by cover
ing each state with a different kind
of used Coke can.
Conservation also saves energy,
since it is easier to melt and re-form
an old can than to extract the alumi
num from its ores.
This is handy, since more energy
saved equates to less energy that
has to be extracted from coal and
plutonium.

A brand-new bug reveals the technology behind

ramifications of conservation and more. A new
installment each week. Tune in and get the facts

condition for the existence of flat space
time?
Let me state at the outset that questions
like the last one will automatically be an
swered with utmost promptness and tire
less effort. Really.
In fact, if one of you out there wants to
ask it again, I will answer it better than it
was answered way back when.
Science trivia, far from being trivial, is
taken very seriously by some of us who at
the same time are busy failing all of our
technical classes.
And now that the format of the column

has been clarified, anyone who is still
reading this can discover the answers to a
couple of questions left over from last year.
Dear Sirs: What is the nature of those
white Formica rectangles on the Stanford
Bookstore checkout counters? You know, the
ones that the person operating the cash regis
ter (or check register, actually) rubs the
spines of books against for no apparent rea
son? - anonymous

According to one of the ladies who works
at the Customer Service counter, that
easily-cleaned, plastic plate is merely a
cover for a device that is designed to com
bat theft.
Evidently, every book in the Stanford
Bookstore inventory has a strip of magnetic
tape running the length of its spine; left
alone this tape would cause a measurable
disturbance in the electric field generated
by two metal bars mounted in the door
jambs of bookstore exits.
Such a disturbance would trigger an
alarm and some bad person would get put in

a big dungeon for a long time.
To avoid this, one has the option of
paying for the book, at which juncture the
kindly cashier vigorously applies the spine
of the book to the Formica plate.
The device under the plate generates an
electric field which realigns the magnetic
particles in the tape into some configuration
suitable for getting the book through the
exit without triggering the alarm.
Here again is electromagnetism at work
for you, ensuring that crime does not pay,
and causing your Walkman to make
bookstore authorities think you are a
shoplifter.
Dear Sirs: Given that most materials that
can be and are recycled are more or less nat
ural substances (viz., paper, glass and alu
minum), wouldn't they, if just dumped
somewhere, eventually decay and be reab
sorbed into nature? Hence, does
"conservation" truly conserve any matter, or
does it only speed up the rate at which matter
is re-used? - anonymous
Since this seems like a philosophical
question, I will take the liberty of philosop
hizing.
Most of what you say is technically true,
but speeding up the rate of re-use turns out
to be a pretty important function of conser
vation.
Of the three substances listed, paper
decays most rapidly, but even that takes a
while in human terms (as the stacks of old
Dailys decomposing soggily throughout
winter quarter attest).
Glass and aluminum that are just dumped
are even more annoyingly stable; they last
for thousands of years if recycled only by
nature.
The stability of these things would not be
a problem but for the fact that we humans

churn them out in such huge quanti
ties, There is less reason to fear
running out of trees and sand and
bauxite than there is to fear the ac
cumulation of all of the processed
items, so the advantage of recycling
is not that it conserves matter, but
litter.
Conserve more, waste less, and
avoid having to find new places to
stow trash all the time.
So ASSU Recycling and the other
agencies do us a favor, since they
help whittle the trash problem
down to one of stashing all of the
things that can't be conveniently
recycled, such as most plastics and
toxic chemicals and nuclear wastes.
These are big enough problems
by themselves for now, so there
does not seem to be much point in
seeing how well we can test the
four-color map theorem by cover
ing each state with a different kind
of used Coke can.
Conservation also saves energy,
since it is easier to melt and re-form
an old can than to extract the alumi
num from its ores.
This is handy, since more energy
saved equates to less energy that
has to be extracted from coal and
plutonium.
Now as registration is winding to a close
and you, readers, are resting your already
weary and frustrated eyes on this very
newsprint, 1 hasten to bid you a warm and
refreshing welcome.
For those of you who are the celebrated
and newly arrived frosh, transfers and
graduate students, some introductory in
formation about this column may prove use
ful, and this first barrage of verbiage will
therefore attempt to clarify the purpose and
workings of Bug Me.
For those who, with a sense of grave for
boding, have begun to recognize that my
writing will hew closely to the stylistic in
anities of previous Bug Me writers, please
either bear with me for this week or else go
ahead and turn the page, if you are really
that sort of person.
Bug Me is, most importantly, your
column; it is written exclusively for you,
the reader. It is your forum for getting an
answer to any of those little nagging ques
tions that perpetually, relentlessly follow
you around and ruin your outlook on life as
you become convinced that no one, but no
one, can answer them.
Well relax. I can.
All you have to do is this: a) think of a
question, or preferably, dredge up one of
those that are working day and night to
destroy you mentally; b) write it down and
send it in to me via some suitable medium,
such as the form provided on page seven; and
c) wait for the interminable amount of time
to elapse while I get around to answering it.
Any question of any type is fair game, but
most questions in the past have concerned
either historical facts about Stanford, minor
local problems and complaints that require
some troubleshooting, and miscellaneous

trivia of the most esoteric sort.
To be totally honest, 1 generally refrain
from killing myself to answer some of the
more obscure historical questions. It's not
anything like an ironclad policy, mind you,
but questions like, "Where were all of the
original Stanford family bathrooms located
relative to the modern campus?" might
wind up getting put on the back burner for
awhile.

Such a statement, of course, in no way
compromises my earlier promise about this
being your column, and yours alone. But I
should confess that really choice trivia is
something I savor.
For example, the following are questions
that people in the past have actually sent in,
and which were zealously answered by the
contemporary columnist.
Why was Stern built in its "ugly barracks"
style?
What is the maximum velocity attainable
by a common housefly?
How old is Barbara Walters?

What is the name of Dudley Do-right's
horse?
Is it true that McDonald's shakes do not
contain milk but are made primarily of pe
troleum by-products?
How does one go about obtaining a live
predacious diving beetle?

Christoffel tensor a necessary and sufficient
