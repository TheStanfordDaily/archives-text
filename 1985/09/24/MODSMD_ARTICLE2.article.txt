# ASSU kicks off funny season
## COP Releases 'Story Book' 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
In an effort to spark new interest in the ASSU,
the Council of Presidents (COP) has published a
new, humorous version of the annual student
government information pamphlet.
"The Student Government Story Book." dis
tributed in information packets to all freshmen, is
filled with a series of amusing vignettes describ
ing various ASSU agencies and services.
"It has as much to do with student govern
ment as the former (pamphlet), only it's not bone
dry." said COP member Mike Collins, adding
that past pamphlets were "distressingly dull"
publications that "nobody was reading."
"Traditionally, they (COP members) re-issue
the same pamphlet." Collins said.
Produced for approximately $1,000, the 3.000
copies of the pamphlet are specifically targeted
at the incoming freshmen class, according to
Collins.
"If it gets people to come here and ask ques
tions and actually get involved, then I feel it's
worth every penny." he said.
According to Senate Chair Carey White, fund
ing for the project is an annual line item in the
ASSU budget, with the COP responsible for the
pamphlet's publication during the summer.
"The theory (behind this year's pamphlet) was
radically different." White said, adding that "it

may become a trend to do it in an amusing for
mat. For a first effort it wasn't a bad try.
"People are going to want to take these," he
said. "They're dying laughing by the time they're
through reading it."
However, White noted that while "the concept
is very good," future editions probably would
contain more factual information about the
ASSU.
Collins said that while students might not pick
up as many factual details from the new
pamphlet, "At least, if they do read it, I hope
they'll enjoy it.
"People that love or hate the pamphlet, either
way, should get involved by going out for editor

of the ASSU News or through the activities of
the Publication Board, overriding the activities of
my cronies and myself," Collins said.
Immediate response to the publication has
been positive, Collins said. "Almost all of the re
action I've gotten has been extremely suppor
tive. . . . the freshmen like it a lot." He noted
that approximately 30 freshmen showed up yes
terday at the ASSU for an informational meeting.
"Just the fact that people are talking about this
pamphlet is an amazing victory," Collins said,
adding that University administrators have re
quested copies of the publication.
Anne Marie Krogh, a Branner freshmen,
called the pamphlet "very creative. . . . You
want to read more to find out what they're
talking about."
Among the stories in the pamphlet is one de
scribing the election process and powers of the
COP. The story compares the selection of the
executive branch of the ASSU to "the tribal
people of ancient Bumbleduggie" who "would dip
the fallow end of a sapling from the towering
Gunga tree in the blood of a sapphire-black viper
— a particularly nasty venom — and gently poke
each male in the village who was old enough to
walk and slow enough to catch; gently, yes, but
with enough gumption to break the skin nicely."
Another excerpt simply defines the operations
of the Publications Board: "Funds all campus liq
uor establishments."
