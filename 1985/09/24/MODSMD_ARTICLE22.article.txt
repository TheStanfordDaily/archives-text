# Adjectives Don't Apply to This Form
## 
### MARILYN WANN Editorial staff 
"What's your adjective?
It was the best frat party question since
astrology gave us "What's your sign?" But
the Admissions Office's revised application
for next year's freshmen will put an end to
all that.
"Frankly we got bored reading them,"
admitted Sarah Voshall, assistant director
of admissions about all the "determineds,"
"independents" and "motivateds" that have
crossed her desk.
She denied that people who chose these
more conventional descriptions were dis
criminated against particularly in favor of
other, more "heliocentric" or "piquant" ap
plicants.
Admissions changes the two questions
that are designed to reveal personality
every few years.
In the past, applicants have been asked
to describe what they would discuss if they
wrote a book or their most important life
experiences.
And now for the big scoop. Get ready to
write home to your little siblings.
This year's applications will ask high
&~hool seniors to choose something to
h -nor on a national holiday and who they
would spend a day with, given a choice of
any figure from history.
The staff started working on these new
questions last May and just took delivery of
the printed applications a week ago.
The process of deciding what to ask
prospective freshmen in order to gain in
sight on their views of themselves started
at a staff retreat brainstorming session.
The former director of transfer admis

sions suggested jokingly at the end of one
long day that they ask applicants which po
sition they would choose in a formation of
migrating geese.
In the eyes of some, the Stanford admis
sions process has a reputation for making
arbritary choices as it is.
"Before 1 applied, 1 heard that they
would put everyone's applications in a
manila file folder and toss them down a
flight of stairs and then accept all those that

go the farthest," said one sophomore. "1
guess my folder was aerodynamically
sound anyway."
Actually, the questions that were chosen
were tested first in an advanced freshman
writing class in Otero House by English lec
turer Dennis Matthies, the Otero resident
fellow.
They wrote essays on three sample
questions and spent two class sessions dis
cussing what makes an application question

strong or weak.
He said that they defined the ideal ques
tion as one that has no right or wrong an
swer, is broad enough that anybody should
have something to respond to it that isn't
faked and one that allows room for risk
taking and creativity.
In his opinion, the traditional adjective
question doesn't meet these criteria. "It
forces you to talk about yourself in an artifi
cial way," he said.
He said this practice was valuable to his

class of about a dozen students because
they would be able to write stronger
resumes, cover letters and interview-type
applications.
Voshall said that the questions are care
fully worded to avoid any California catch
words or even American dialect that would
create a bias against foreign students.
The purpose of all the questions used,
whether those asked in the past or those
prepared for this year, is to show the appli
cant's ability to express themselves well
and to communicate an idea with meaningful
content.
It's not supposed to be a test ot vocabu
lary, she explained. The particular adjective
applicants chose was not as important as
their explanation of it.
Of course, some adjectives become
overused.
Voshall remembered that the first appli
cant to simply type the word "concise" in
the middle of the blank space left for the es
say was noteworthy.
After that, she said it just wasn't as im
pressive.
"The adjective was used to try to initiate
a response," she added in defense, though.
There were certainly people who could
still think of fresh twists on the old adjective
theme, she remembered.
One girl wrote her description of herself
as "reflective" in mirror image and included
a sheet of silvery mylar with her applica
tion, the better to read it with.
Another change in this year's application
is the inclusion of a viewbook of Stanford
scenes in the preliminary applications that
are in the mail right now.
The adjective may be gone, but there'll
be a whole new class of freshmen who can
ask, "What's your holiday?"
