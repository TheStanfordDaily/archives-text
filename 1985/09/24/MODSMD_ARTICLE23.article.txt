## Babenco's 'Spider Woman' Weaves Tangled Web of Fact and Fantasy 
### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff 
At first, the sight of couples in love walking hand in
hand out of the theater after seeing "Kiss of the Spider
Woman seemed somehow not to jibe with the vision of
alienation painted in the film. But the line that
separates visions from realities not all that clear-cut
anyway. And that line is what director Hector Babenco
("I'ixote ) dissects in this movie with great skill.
Adapted from Manuel Puig's novel, Leonard
Schrader s screenplay portrays the evolution of a sym
biotic relationship between two Brazilian prison cell
mates.
Disparate methods of dealing with the horror of
being in prison are at odds in the cell that provides the
setting for most of the film. By extension, the story
becomes a fascinating portrait of the diffusion of normal
boundaries ol reality and sexuality that can occur in iso
lated environments.
Valentin Arregui (Raul Julia), a figure in a Marxist in
surgents' movement incarcerated for unspecified
"political" crimes, maintains a veneer of sanity by
leading a deliberately ascetic existence. He spouts
revolutionary doctrine at every opportunity to con
vince himself that lying on a bare bed in an already bar
ren cell is worth the agony it exacerbates. A "real
man in his estimation is someone who "doesn't take
any crap from anybody,' who devotes himself unflinch
ingly and exclusively to the cause of changing the world
and eliminating all elements of oppression in society.
Luis Molina (William Hurt) lies on the opposite end of
the spectrum. Sweeping like a dancer around his half of
the cell, his walls festooned with photographs of
movies starlets of the 40s and curlicue cloud designs,
his bed canopied with faded women's garments, his
body adorned with a flowery robe, Molina's life in
prison is a menagerie of fantasy and mist. Ihs means of
coping with the reality of his homosexuality and his im
prisonment (he has been charged, as Socrates of old
was, with "corrupting the morals of a minor") is to
relive the storylines and the ambiances of old films he
recalls seeing, lie becomes the wistful, romantic
heroine of a World War II flick who is torn between
proving her love to a Nazi officer and betraying her
native France.
One of the problematic parts of "Spider Woman" is
the methodical way in which Babenco incorporates
"footage" from this propaganda flick into the prison

scenes themselves. The footage is intended to be a
piece of charming, even laughable melodrama, and the
actors in the footage wring every bit of camp from their
roles that they can.
Sonia Braga plays the cabaret singer/heroine Hurt's
character identifies with. Her performance, given the
innate limitations of her character, is merely interest
ing. The moon eyes she feigns, the swoons she slips
into and the impassioned intonations she breathes are
all part and parcel of the Aryan lushness the "footage"
of Molina's mental flick is intended to convey.
The film's intent is to portray the way dependencies
crop up between people in situations of privation and
fear. The femininity that belongs to Molina eventually
turns from being a sin to being a virtue, at least in the
cell that the two men share. By the same token, the
rabid devotion to principle that haunts Arregui, a char
acteristic at first loathed by his cellmate, eventually
teaches him a mortal lesson in possessing and standing
up for faith.
Perhaps it is too much to expect the film to avoid
taking the side of either character in the telling of this
give and take of traits and habits. For the most part,
the film successfully maintains the integrity it starts out
with, by turns switching the role of dependency back
and forth between the two men.
But the footage calls Molina's character into question
in a way that seems to give the film's moral victory to
Arregui. We are manipulated into seeing the footage of
the Nazi film that means so much to Molina as no more
than pap. The question we are forced to ask, like Ar
regui does, is why Molina bases so much of his exis
tence on remembering such an insignificant film; per
haps it is a prison survival mechanism, perhaps not. In
any case, the end of the film leaves us on Arregui's side
instead of Molina's, and that is not an acceptable sym
pathy to exact in a situation where the implied purpose
of the film is to illustrate the flaws of both characters
equally. Arregui comes out looking like a saint, if not in
fact, then in metaphor.
At the same time, there is a fluctuation in the film
between politicization and romanticization that does
not always work. The shift between film and footage is
a problem in the screenplay that caused even the au
thor of the novel from which the film is adapted to
throw up his hands in disgust. According to an article
published in the San Francisco Examiner. Manuel Puig
worked with Babenco and Schrader on the content of
the footage until he saw the way it was going, and then
he left the project in a huff.

Perhaps it is too much to expect the film to avoid
taking the side of either character in the telling of this
give and take of traits and habits. For the most part,
the film successfully maintains the integrity it starts out
with, by turns switching the role of dependency back
and forth between the two men.
But the footage calls Molina's character into question
in a way that seems to give the film's moral victory to
Arregui. We are manipulated into seeing the footage of
the Nazi film that means so much to Molina as no more
than pap. The question we are forced to ask, like Ar
regui does, is why Molina bases so much of his exis
tence on remembering such an insignificant film; per
haps it is a prison survival mechanism, perhaps not. In
any case, the end of the film leaves us on Arregui's side
instead of Molina's, and that is not an acceptable sym
pathy to exact in a situation where the implied purpose
of the film is to illustrate the flaws of both characters
equally. Arregui comes out looking like a saint, if not in
fact, then in metaphor.
At the same time, there is a fluctuation in the film
between politicization and romanticization that does
not always work. The shift between film and footage is
a problem in the screenplay that caused even the au
thor of the novel from which the film is adapted to
throw up his hands in disgust. According to an article
published in the San Francisco Examiner. Manuel Puig
worked with Babenco and Schrader on the content of
the footage until he saw the way it was going, and then
he left the project in a huff.
