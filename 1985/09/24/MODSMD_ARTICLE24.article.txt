# Revolution Rocks 'Home and the World'
## 
### STEVE WARRICK 
In "The Home and the World"
("Ghare-Baire"), the movie by ac
claimed Indian filmmaker Satyajit
Ray, personal revolution in the lives
of the characters mirrors a national
uprising against British cultural im
perialism in Bengal.
Satyajit Ray uses his characters
and their private dialogues to illus
trate the differing factions and prin
ciples of the Swadeshi movement, a
revolution attempting to restrict
the sale of foreign goods in Bengal.
Satyajit Ray's characters hold
beliefs that are reflected in the
rhythms of their speech and their
expressions; they live their convic
tions. As these convictions take
hold in Bimala Choudhury
(Swatilekha Chatterjee), her intel
lectual emancipation becomes
Satyajit Ray's illustration of the tur
moil going on in the Bengal estate
of her maharajah husband, Nikhil
(Victor Baneijee).
The film is essentially a three
character play, and its events are
precipitated by the Western
influenced, liberal Nikhil's efforts to
educate his reticent, sheltered
wife. He hopes to free her from the
comfortable but stifling environ
ment of her purdah, the station she
holds in her husband's household.
Though Bimala is content with
her traditional position, Nikhil's
desire to have not just a wife, but
an intellectual companion, brings
him to introduce her to his fiery, ag
gressively charismatic friend, San
dip (Soumitra Chatterjee), a leader
of the Swadeshi movement. San
dip's revolutionary rhetoric inspires
her to his cause, though Nikhil
balks at the revolution's methods
and goals.

Bimala's intellectual awakening is
Satyajit Ray's primary focus in the
movie; he uses her as an illustration
of traditional India changing with
the influences of the Western
world, yet avoids turning her into
an icon.
But Sandip's fervor is enor
mously attractive, particularly in re
lation to the passive intellectualism
of Nikhil. Bimala's eyes light up
when Sandip speaks, she can't get

this kind of impassioned conviction
from her husband. When she
hesitates to see Sandip, it is not her
education or intuition that warns
her away; rather, her adherence to
traditional roles binds her to her
purdah.
The conflicts between intuition
and education, tradition and revolu
tion set up resonating ironies in the
film that Satyajit Ray's quiet, un

obtrusive direction casually under
scores. Both Nikhil and Sandip
revere Bimala, yet neither fully un
derstands her or wins her over to
his cause. Her learning and instinct
come into play in unexpected ways.
And Sandip's preference for English
cigarettes, or Nikhil's own attempts
at marketing Swadeshi produce
keep us reevaluating the charac
ters' motivations. We pick up on the

ironies in the characters' lives be
cause Satyajit Ray's camera doesn't
cut away from the actors; they
carry out whole dialogues or
speeches and their conversations
form and end naturally. We get to
see every expression and hear
every word, and they tell their own
story.
Though the characters often talk
about personal affairs and beliefs,

they're always talking about issues
that relate to the whole of India, is
sues that affect both the home and
the world.
There are scenes where the
ideas repeat themselves, and
Satyajit Ray's literal style drags
through these stretches. But the
characters are never less than com
pelling, and display varying degrees
of depth. Nikhil is the most enig
matic, for his desire to see Bimala
interpret the issues of the revolu
tion for herself seems increasingly
irrational as Sandip's control over
her and Nikhil's estate increases.
Victor Banerjee radiates an al
most mystical intelligence in this
role; he commands our respect

even while we watch him
precipitate the destruction of his
world. His belief that intuition and
understanding will guide his wife is
not completely justified in the
movie, but her intellectual develop
ment is so important to Nikhil that
he is willing to sacrifice everything
he possesses, including his relation
ship with her, to permit it. He and
Bimala are risky characters; it
would be easy for them to fade into
abstractions. But their relationship
and its expansion into a metaphor
for the needs of a delicate, deeply
traditional culture like India's, are
beautifully handled. They bespeak
Satyajit Ray's artistic understanding
and love for his country.

movie, but her intellectual develop
ment is so important to Nikhil that
he is willing to sacrifice everything
he possesses, including his relation
ship with her, to permit it. He and
Bimala are risky characters; it
would be easy for them to fade into
abstractions. But their relationship
and its expansion into a metaphor
for the needs of a delicate, deeply
traditional culture like India's, are
beautifully handled. They bespeak
Satyajit Ray's artistic understanding
and love for his country.


Victims of personal and political revolution in Bengal, Bimala (Swatilekha Chatterjee) and Nikhil
(Victor Banerjee) console one another in "Home and the World."
