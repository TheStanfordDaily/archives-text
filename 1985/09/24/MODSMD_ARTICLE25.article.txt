# Delectable Delights Highlight Thiebaud's Work

Try to conjure up the image of a
hot fudge sundae, a caramel
candy apple or a piece of lemon
chiffon pie; if you've been craving
something sweet, but won't in
dulge, treat yourself to a trip to the
exhibit of works by Wayne
Thiebaud at the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art. His paint
ings of pies, deli counters and ice
cream concoctions are better than
any reality you could buy in one of
Palo Alto's many food shops.
Creating an oil painting more ap
pealing than the actual object is
Thiebaud's main objective. The
result is a series of paintings that
not only look real, but also capture
the essence of the object painted.
As one critic observed, "By some
alchemy . . . Thiebaud does not
seem to be working with oil paint at
all, but with a substance composed
of flour, albumen, butter, and
sugar." Whether it is a still life, a
portrait, or one of his more recent
cityscapes, Thiebaud's work con
tinuously explores the basic
elements of painting: composition,
color, scale and the transforming
effect of light on objects. His work
derives its force and subtlety from
his mastery of color and light, and
at the same time demonstrates his
fascination with structure and
manipulation of paint.
Mass produced foodstuffs make
up the largest portion of Thiebaud's
still lifes that the curator, Karen
Tsujimoto, has reproduced in her
exhibit.
Thiebaud said that once, when he
was window-shopping, he was

seized with the desire to paint the
items he saw in the elaborate dis
plays. Since that day in the early
19605, he began to produce the
sensuously textured paintings of
frosted confections and delicates
sen foods that make your mouth
water. By representing the mass
marketed pinball machines, teddy
bears and apple pies, Thiebaud has
been able to explore an original field
that is uniquely American. He has
also afforded the opportunity to ex
plore many formalistic concerns by

playing with the geometric shapes
of triangular pie slices and circular
soup bowls. Sometimes, when you
stare at his still lifes long enough,
you forget that the painting
portrays four neatly made club
sandwiches, and instead only see a
series of triangles on an elliptical
platter.
Through the medium of simple
shaped still lifes, Thiebaud has also
experimented with the spatial ori
entation of his images; how a paint
ing can be made to suggest deep
space, flatness, or any degree in

between. "Valentine Cakes" for ex
ample shows four small white cakes
low on the canvas, the two rear
ones placed against each other to
suggest the sensation of physical
pressure. Four years later,
Thiebaud did a similar work
("California Cakes"), but this time
five cakes are lined up one behind
the other like cadets filed for target
practice. In these and other works,
Thiebaud investigates the impor
tance of the entire picture plane in
cluding objects, negative space, and
edges as in "Pastel Scatter."
One of the most alluring aspects
of Thiebaud's art is how he manip
ulates paint to create textures that
look invitingly like the substance of
the image. In "Cake Window," the
paint almost drips frosting, and
"Dark Candy Apples" oozes melted
caramel. The thickly painted sub
jects stand out by contrasting with
heavy smooth backdrops. But
Thiebaud saves his works from
being overly heavy and dull by in
fusing them with the tremendous
energy that radiates from alternat
ing hot and cool colors. He also
gives them life by playing with light,
and because his subjects represent
the serially produced products of
contemporary America, Thiebaud
evokes the effect of the white fluo
rescent light that is indigenous to
this society.
Because Thiebaud concentrated
largely on consumer imagery, crit
ics began to identify him as a pop
artist. This label disagreed with
Thiebaud who says he is motivated
by different concern. "I see myself
as a traditional painter. I'm very
much interested in the concept of

realism and . . . inquiry' into what
tradition of realism is all about."
In 1963, Thiebaud increasingly
turned his attention to the figure,
partly in reaction to being identified
with the pop movement. He sees
figure painting as "the most impor
tant study there is and the most
challenging and the most difficult."
The San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art has included many of
these works in its show as well. He
poses his figures against stark
backgrounds and paints them as he
does a still life. As a result, you get
the feeling that these people are
also arranged in a window display
and could be bought if the price
were right. Only does the sketch
"Mallery Ann" reveal any compas
sion and subjective tenderness for
the subject.
Two rooms of the exhibit are
devoted to Thiebaud's landscapes,
both rural and urban, which are his
most recent creations. In these
paintings, Thiebaud continues his
preoccupation with the arrange
ment of space: "I'm not just inter
ested in the pictorial aspects of the
landscape — see a pretty place and
try to paint it — but in some way to
manage it, manipulate it or see
what I can turn it into."
Although his rural scenes lack
the concise intensity of his still lifes,
the cityscapes of steep San Fran
cisco streets are dramatic and ex
citing. Thiebaud establishes
different positions of perspective
for the viewer: up, down, close-up,
helicopter view, worm's-eye view.
By confusing the reading of space
and by combining several different
perspectives, Thiebaud succeeds in

disorienting you so that you are im
mediately reminded of just how it
feels to drive around the pitched
angles of San Francisco's dizzying
streets.
Despite the multiple-point per
spective and radically forshortened
forms, Thiebaud prevails in creat
ing a realistic experience for the

viewer.
Thiebaud's landscapes and figure
paintings are interesting, but his
still lifes are a pure delight to the
eye. These manufactured articles
and delectable concoctions alone
are worth a trip to the City. The
show is open through Nov. 10 and
deserves a look.
