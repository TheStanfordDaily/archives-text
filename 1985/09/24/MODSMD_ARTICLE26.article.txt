# Showmanship and Talent: Key to Manilow's Longevity
## 
### JENNIFER KOCH Editorial staff 
You remember this guy â€” he caused quite a sensa
tion a few years back with his syrupy love songs and an
obnoxious tune about a showgirl named Lola. But you
lost track of him or you lost interest; your music taste
broadened from the ballads you used to sing along with
in junior high. What you may not have realized is that
the musical talent of Barry Manilow has broadened
also. In this lOth-year anniversary of his first hit
"Mandy," Manilow has released a jazzy, 19405-era al
bum, starred in the first musical produced for televi
sion and traversed the country with his "Cobacabana"
tour.
For those of you who weren't fortunate enough to
spend your summer on or around the Peninsula, in the
past few months the Concord Pavilion has hosted such
acts as Bryan Adams, Eric Clapton, Tom Petty, Amy
Grant and Stanley Jordan. The Manilow concert ex
travaganza hit the Bay Area in early September, cour
tesy of the Concord.
You didn't necessarily have to be a native Northern
Californian to attend the Manilow concert; some of
those in attendance traveled from as far as Michigan,
Florida, England and Australia to watch their idol per
form. The Concord Pavilion sports a large, grassy em
bankment perfect for the blankets and picnics of the
many concert goers. It also has spacious seating area,
and this is where Barry Manilow's fan club spread out
zoom lenses and elaborate photo albums.
The majority of the audience consisted of women be
tween the ages of 20 and 40. To be honest, there were
more than a few men in attendance. And as Manilow
himself suggested, perhaps they were "dragged
along."
From the opening strains of Manilow's elaborately
produced stage show, from the second he flashed his
enormous blue eyes and from the moment he burst
forth with his first song, you could almost understand
why this man still appeals so strongly to so many.
His love of entertaining is unmistakable; his energy
on stage is overwhelming. When he invited a teenage

girl to the stage to sing "Can't Smile Without You," it
was impossible to tell which of the two was having the
better time. He made no attempt to hide his delight at
the screams and moans that his soulful expressions
elicited from the crowd.
Manilow's show almost resembled a series of skits.
With each song came a set change, costume change,
mood change and a change of character. Manilow's
costume adjustments ranged from a brilliant blue blazer
to a waiter's uniform to an elegant white tuxedo. His
music matched the diversity of his appearance. He
sang the old favorite "Weekend in New England" in a
soft, wistful tone while perched on a piano stool, and

shortly afterwards donned black leather and mirrored
glasses to bitterly spit out the lyrics to "Some Kind of
Friend."
At one point the stage was designed as a dusky,
smoky bar, complete with band members lazily leaning
on tables, sipping drinks. This setting included a neon
sign advertising "Paradise Cafe," the title of Manilow's
latest album, and he played the scene to its fullest,
singing several tracks in a dreamy, whispery voice.
More than a few audience members were swaying to
"When October Goes," entranced by the soulful
melody and the mood of quiet desperation emanating
from the slow, soft lyrics.
Barry Manilow can sing, no doubt about it. And there
is no question that he has mastered the art of songwrit
ing. But perhaps what Manilow does best is act, for his
live performances allow him to showcase his energy,
his versatility and his personality. And maybe, just
maybe, it is that quality that keeps his fans faithful con
cert after concert, year after year.
