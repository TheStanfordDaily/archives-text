## Men's Golf 13th at Invite 
### ROB GRAHAM Editorial staff 
The Stanford men's golf team, in
Lake Geneva, Wis. this weekend to
begin its fall campaign at the three
day Americana Resort Classic, was
slow out of the gates — in more
ways than one.
For one, the squad's play at the
Invitational was less than spectacu
lar. The Cardinal finished near the
middle of the pack, in 13th place
among the 24 teams on hand.
To make matters worse, the play
on each of the tournament's three
days was agonizingly slow — giving
the Cardinal golfers plenty of time
to brood between bad shots.
"It took six hours to play 18
holes," .Stanford Coach Tim Schaaf
said, talking about Saturday's first
round. "That could have accounted
for the field's high scores. It's just
very hard to play when it's so
slow."
Saturday must have seemed es
pecially slow for the Cardinal gol
fers. The four top Stanford men
needed 319 strokes to finish the
7,258 yard, par 72 Americana
Resort Golf Course. That first
round hacking placed the Cardinal in
16th place, 19 shots distant from
front-running Northwestern.
Things quickened a bit in Sun
day's second round; play took a
scant five-and-a-half hours. And
with the faster pace, Stanford's
sticks began to click.
The Cardinal fired the day's third
best team round, 303, and moved
up three spots to 13th place.
Stanford's charge was led by Don
Walsworth's two-under-par 70. "We
improved on the strength of Don's

round," Schaaf said. "Don was the
only one who really had a fine after
noon."
After Sunday's success, Schaaf
spoke with optimism: "We didn't
play that well, we just had one good
round.
"Still, everybody was a lot more
comfortable today. If we play well
tomorrow (Monday), we could
finish in the top five in the field."
As it turned out, Schaafs team
didn't play well in Monday's final
round. In fact they bogged down
again. The 18 holes must have
seemed like an eternity.
The men duck-hooked and sliced
their way to a collective 314. That
round was just good enough to keep
the Cardinal in 13th place, but didn't
draw any smiles or compliments
from Schaaf.
"We had problems with consis
tency," Schaaf said. "It was a poor
early season effort. . . I didn't ex
pect us to play this badly."
The Cardinal ended 29 shots
back of team champion Miami
(Fla.), which posted a three-day
total of 907. Florida Southern
finished three strokes back in
second place.
Still, Schaaf remained hopeful:
"There are things wrong with this
team that will work themselves out
— and in short order."
Schaaf was referring to what
might be a temporary leadership
and experience void within the
Cardinal ranks. Three of last year's
top six players: Tim Robinson,
Scott Erickson and Doug
Thompson, graduated.
That left the Cardinal with only a
pair of players familiar with NCAA

Despite their smooth swings, the Cardinal played ragged golf.
They could manage only a 13th place finish at the 54-hole
Americana Classic in Lake Geneva, Wis.

Cole Thompson and the rest of the Stanford golf team watched
in agony this weekend as putts missed, drives hooked and
scores balooned.
caliber golf: Walsworth and Carl
Wagner. Relative newcomers to the
top six, like Rich Marik, Jon Dickey
and Cole Thompson, are being
asked to take over.
"It's a talented team, but there
are voids in experience," Schaaf
said. "Guys are starting to adjust to
their new leadership roles."
If someone could lead by
practice, Walsworth would be
Schaaf s man.
Walsworth was, in the words of
Schaaf, "the lone bright spot this
weekend." The senior from Mar
celine, Mo., recorded rounds of 76,
70 and 75 to finish third among indi
viduals. Virginia's Jeff Putnam
played par golf, 216, to capture the
individual side.
Schaaf saw that relative inexperi
ence as a factor. "Maybe we
weren't as ready as we could have
been,"he said, "but after all, it is
our first tournament."
