# Card Soccer Comes Home
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO 
Led by the stingy goaltending of Tom Austin and
the goal-scoring of seniors Hob West and Cassio Con
ceicao, the Stanford men's soccer team concluded its
East Coast road trip Sunday with an impressive 2-0
victory over the Boston College Eagles.
The win gave the Cardinal an even 1-1-1 record on
the swing. Earlier in the week Stanford played Brown
University to a 0-0 tie and lost to the University of
Connecticut 3-1.
For much of the Brown and Connecticut games,
the Stanford offense struggled. But on Sunday, the
Cardinal offense began to find the net. West struck
early, scoring just five and a half minutes into the
game.
As it turned out, the goal was all that Austin, Stan
ford's junior keeper, and his defense would need.
Austin recorded eleven saves on the day to blank
the Eagles. The goalie has now given up only six
goals in nine games and leads the Pacific Soccer Con
ference in shutouts with five.
For good measure, midfielder Conceicao added an
insurance goal midway through the second half to se
cure the victory for the Cardinal.
Before embarking on the Eastern tour, Sam Koch,
Stanford's second-year head coach, discussed the
road trip's significance. "The trip back to the East

Coast could determine the season," he said. "It's im
portant we come back with a good feeling."
And Stanford's players are indeed feeling good.
"We basically outplayed them and adjusted well to the
artificial surface," Cardinal midfielder Tom Rafalovich
said. 'We played like it was our homefield instead of

theirs."
The way the team played this week should give it
confidence going into its Pacific Soccer Conference
schedule, according to Rafalovich. "This is the best
soccer I've seen Stanford play in the four years I've
been here," Rafalovich said.

On Friday, the Cardinal club visited the best team
it has seen this year in the form of Connecticut, the
country's ninth-ranked squad. The Cardinal was
greeted by some long range firepower. The Huskies
scored three times and each was a shot from over
twenty yards out.
Stanford did play well, however, and had several
golden scoring oppurtunities go astray. They just
couldn't convert.
It wasn't until twenty-four minutes remained in the
game that the Cardinal finallv scored. Midfielder Dave
Daniels beat Connecticut's goalkeeper Andy Pan
tason with a low, sharp shot to the left hand corner of
the goal.
The goal broke Pantason's streak of 501 con
secutive minutes without allowing a score.
Lack of scoring has been a problem early in the
season for Stanford, but now the offense seems to be
coming around.
All week the Cardinal attack had good ball move
ment and created numerous scoring opportunities.
But the ball just would not go in until the Boston Col
lege contest.
Koch and his players hope the B.C. signals that the
Stanford offense has gelled and that the Cardinal will
start putting points on the board. "That's what we
have to do," Rafalovich said, pointing to the game
with the Eagles.
Stanford, now 3-4-2 overall, next travels south Sat
urday to take on Cal Poly San Luis Obispo at 7:30
p.m.
If Koch's prophecy — that Eastern road trip would
make or break the Cardinal — means anything, and if
talented seniors Angel Vazquez, West, and Tom and
Todd Rafalovich can score more frequently, Stanford
could challenge for the Pacific Soccer Conference
title.

Stanford found goals hard to come by all weekend, especially when foes' legs blocked the
way. Despite the obstacles, the Cardinal kicked and clawed its way to a 1-1-1 record for the
