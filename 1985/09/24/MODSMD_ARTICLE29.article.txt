# Cal tonight, Texas Friday
## Stanford To Face Tough Tests 
### PETER HAVEN Editorial staff 
Most Stanford volleyball fans
probably wince when they see the
kind of schedule the Stanford
women's volleyball team has this
year. But Co-coach Don Shaw is
not like most kind of fans.
Shaw looks at his team's
schedule — which not only includes
such perennial conference power
houses as UCLA, USC. Arizona
and Arizona State, but also includes
the likes of San Jose State. Hawaii.
Colorado State. Nebraska, the Uni
versity of the Pacific. Western Mic
higan and Texas — and he says his
squad will benefit from it.
Tonight's match against Cal at
Berkeley represents perhaps the
closest thing to a bye the Cardinal
will experience in awhile. And even
Coach Shaw concedes that he
doesn't "know that much about
Cal."
Last weekend. Stanford survived
unscathed in the Spartan Shops In
vitational. where they beat No. 5
Nebraska. N0.6 Colorado State and

N0.4 San Jose State, in a thrilling
final match.
This Friday, the N0.3 ranked
Texas Longhorns come to the
Farm, and from there "it only gets
worse," according to Shaw.
"We make our own schedule,"
Shaw said. "We play everybody in
our conference twice, and then we
try to schedule the toughest teams
we can play against."
"It helps us gain more experi
ence. If we do make it to the
playoffs, we will have played vir
tually everybody before." he said.
Does it sound like a trial by fire?
"It's a trial by fire," says Shaw.
Actually, when Shaw refers to a
trial by fire, he is not talking about
his schedule — though he could be
— but rather about the heavy bur
den he is placing on the shoulders of
his younger players.
In 1984, Stanford was every
one's pick to make it to the NCAA
Final Four, and they did just that.
The Cardinal finished the season
with a 20-5 record and the N0.2
ranking behind conference rival
UCLA.
It was the best season ever for a

women's volleyball team at Stan
ford, and it marked one step in the
women's climb to the top of the na
tional rankings. That climb began in
1980, when the team finished N0.9
overall. In between, the Cardinal
rose to fifth (1981), fourth (1982)
and then third (1983).
Graduation took a heavy toll on
last year's squad, however. Though
1984's collegiate Player of the
Year, Kim Oden, returns for her
senior campaign this year, Co
coaches Shaw and Fred Strum have
been forced to start three sop
homores and a freshman in 1985.
"They still have a ways to go,"
Shaw said of his younger players.
"It's not easy to make the jump
from high school to college. It takes
time just to learn our system. You
go through a state of confusion . . .
just before you get it."
Freshman Brook Binley was just
one of Stanford's players who had
to grow up fast.

At this early stage in the season, the Cardinal women's volleyball team is setting up to make an
other drive at the NCAA championships
(then ranked No. 11) because an
other relative youngster, sopho
more setter Wendi Rush, went
down to injury. The match was
played in front of 3,634 partisan
Western Michigan fans.
"It was our opening game,"
Shaw said. "Everyone's a little
rusty, and there are all those
opening game jitters."
Binley performed well enough,
however, to help her team to a
straight-set 15-7, 16-14, 15-9
win. She started the next game
against Illinois State as well, an
other straight-sets victory.
In addition to Binley, Shaw has
gotten good performances from
another freshman, Amy Hayes;
super-sophs Rush, Nancy Reno
and Teresa Smith; juniors Brooke
Hahner and Barbara Fontana, a
team leader. And of course, there
is Oden in her final year.
The women's volleyball media

guide calls it"the nucleus of one
of the toughest teams in col
legiate volleyball," and already
the Card women have climbed to
the No. 2 ranking in the Tachikara
PoU.
"It's a long way away," Shaw
cautions when the conversation
turns to a possible NCAA champi
onship. "It's a really long, long
season. Everyone expects us to
do well. Our goal is just to get to
the Final Four. That's the really
tough part."
The Tachikara is a coaches poll
which is generally considered the
most accurate in women's college
volleyball, Shaw said. Though he
is one of the 47 coaches who
make up the Tachikara, Shaw
doesn't agree with the poll's fin
dings with regards to Stanford's
ranking.
"We're not playing that well
right now," Shaw insists. "I don't
really feel we're the No. 2 team in
the country right now. We have a
lot of work to do."
