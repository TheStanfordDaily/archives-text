SEATTLE (AP) — Eric Dickerson returned to Na
tional Football League play with a splash Last night,
rushing for three touchdowns as the Los Angeles
Rams stopped the Seattle Seahawks 35-24.
Dickerson, the two-time NFL rushing champion
back for his third pro season after a 47-day contract
holdout, scored on runs of 1, 2 and 15 yards while
gaining 150 yards on 31 carries to help the Rams im
prove their record to 3-0. The Seahawks dropped to 2-
1.
The Rams exploded for two touchdowns — on a 19-
yard pass from quarterback Dieter Brock to Bobby
Duckworth and Dickerson's 2-yard run — in the first
2:03 of the second half after a 7-7 halftime deadlock.
The Rams took the second-half kickoff and moved 80
yards in five plays, with Brock finding Duckworth in
the left corner of the end zone with just 1:46 gone in
the second half.
Seattle's Randall Morris fumbled the kickoff and

Mark Jerue recovered the ball on the Seattle 2-yard
line. Dickerson scored on the next play for a 21-7 Los
Angeles lead.
The Seahawks came back to within 21-17 on a 26-
yard field goal by Norm Johnson and a 3-yard scoring
pass from Dave Krieg to rookie Danny Greene. But
the Rams then went 80 yards in six plays to put the
game out of reach. Dickerson opened the drive with a
43-yard run and finished it with a 15-yard run with 3:33
left.
The Rams' final touchdown came on the fifth Seattle
turnover of the game on Johnnie Johnson's 27-yard
return of an intercepted Krieg pass with 1:45 to go.
The Rams pressured Krieg throughout and sacked him
seven times, including three by defensive end Doug
Reed, for 61 yards.
Reserve quarterback Gale Gilbert threw 37 yards to
Daryl Turner for the final Seattle touchdown with 28
seconds to play.
