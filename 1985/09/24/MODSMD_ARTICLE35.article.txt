# WHAT'S NEW IN UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION?
## 
### 
Innovative Academic Courses (lAC)
This newly organized office, under the direction of
Professor Jack Winkler (Classics), encourages ex
perimentation and alternative approaches to learn
ing through the Stanford Workshops on Political and
Social Issues (SWOPSI), the Freshman-
Sophomore Seminar Program, and Undergraduate
Special Courses.
1. SWOPSI sponsors workshops that combine
academic analysis of contemporary issues with
community action projects.
2. Freshman-Sophomore Seminars bring to
gether small groups of students to study under the
guidance of a faculty member, usually a professor in
a graduate department or professional school.
3. Undergraduate special courses offer experi
mental and interdisciplinary classes which are not
offered in regular departments and programs.
Information on course offerings and enrollment
procedures for all three types of courses is available
in 590-A, Old Union.
Students are encouraged to initiate workshops,
teach special courses, and organized public events.
Call Andre Burnett or Barbara Jurin-Reid at 497-
4305 for specific information.
Research Grants
Undergraduate Research Opportunities (URO)
now offers two forms of funding to support under
graduate research projects.
Firestone Major Grants for Extended Research
are available on a competitive basis to students
whose research projects extend over a minimum of
three quarters (often, but not always, as honors
projects). The annual competition held in the spring
can award as many as 25 grants of up to $2,500
each to students in any discipline. In addition, the
faculty sponsor of each major grant winner receives
a $1,000 unrestricted professional account. Ex
penses which may be covered by grants include
chemicals, laboratory supplies, travel, subject fees,
photocopying, telephone calls, and postage. Grant
funds may not be used for salary or tuition.
Small Grants for Research Expenses are availa
ble for small projects or as seed money for larger
ones. The maximum grant is $500 in each round of
awards. Small grants are available during autumn
and spring quarters. Rules concerning eligible ex
penses are the same as for the Firestone grants.
Faculty sponsorship is required for all grants. For
further information on application procedures and to
see samples of previous winning applications, con
tact Laura Selznick at the URO office, 590-A Old
Union or call 497-3828.

Undergraduate Advising Center
(UAC)
Formerly known as the Academic Information
Center (AIC), Room 306 Old Union is now the Un
dergraduate Advising Center (UAC) under the di
rection of Audrey Bernfield. The new name reflects
the UAC's commitment to advising undergraduates
about the academic choices they make while
studying at Stanford. Such activities as the Majors
Event and the new mentor network for women in
science and engineering are now coordinated by the
UAC.
As before, UAC advisors provide individualized
help with academic planning and organize programs
and workshops for groups of students with similar
interests and problems. The UAC also continues to
serve as a centralized source of information. Stop
by the third floor of the Old Union or call 497-2426 to
become acquainted with the new services of the
UAC.
On-cadi Advising for
Computing Resources
Kathy Thoelecke, the On-Call Advisor for com
puting resources, is available to answer your ques
tions about a range of computer-related offerings at
Stanford. She can assist you with the selection of
Computer Science courses and with setting long
term goals for your computer education. Call 497-

Union.
Humanities Advising at the
Humanities Center
