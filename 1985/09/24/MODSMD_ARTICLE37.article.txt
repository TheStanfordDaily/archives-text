First Lady Views Quake Damage
MEXICO CITY — First Lady Nancy Reagan, on a goodwill visit to
this shattered city, yesterday presented a check for $1 million to aid
in its reconstruction to President and Mrs. Miguel de la Madrid.
She also presented President de la Madrid with a letter from Pres
ident Reagan, which said, in part, "The resiliency of your citizens is
truly extraordinary. We stand ready to assist you and the Mexican
people as you undertake this heroic effort to relieve the misery
wrought by the earthquake."
The money came from the Agency for International Develop
ment's disaster assistance fund.
The purpose of her trip was to see the devastation first-hand and
report to the president. At the end of Mrs. Reagan's four-hour visit
to this city she spoke briefly at the airport, telling reporters, "The
whole day was emotional, but it's wonderful because we're all
working together. The two countries working together is nice.
"It was a very emotional experience to see the devastation. I don't
think anybody can realize what it is till you've seen it. I have tremen
dous admiration for the Mexican people and what they are doing to
help themselves. It is wonderful to see these countries work to
gether."
As Mexico City residents returned to work and resumed their usual
routines yesterday, the government wrestled with the question of
whether to avert the spread of diSease by demolishing buildings that
might yet hold trapped survivors of Mexico City's devastating
earthquakes.
Growing concern that decaying corpses might spread disease
throughout the city was pushing officials toward a decision that would
likely spell death for undiscovered survivors. Before giving the order
to blow up some of the nearly 600 buildings destroyed or damaged by
last week's quakes, officials decided to let 50 specially trained dogs
from the United States, West Germany, France, Switzerland and
other countries explore the ruins for signs of life. The dogs can
detect the scent of human flesh.
"We are still looking, stone by stone" for survivors, said Alberto
Melendez, a borough official in Venustiano Carranza, a battered sec
tion of the city.
But Navy Secretary Miguel Angel Gomez, who is in charge of ex
cavation of the hard-hit Juarez Avenue area, cautioned that the dan
ger of an epidemic grows greater evei y Hay from the decomposing
bodies still trapped in the rubble. "One must remember it's been
more than four days," he said.
The government solicited private and corporate donations for a
national rebuilding fund. The quakes are estimated to have caused
billions of dollars in damage to Mexico, whose economy is in reces
sion and laboring under a $96 billion foreign debt.
New Zealand Decries Sinking
WELLINGTON, New Zealand — An angry New Zealand Prime
Minister David Lange accused France of "a sordid act of interna
tional, state-backed terrorism" yesterday over the sinking of the
Greenpeace vessel Rainbow Warrior.
Lange also indicated he expected "millions of dollars compensa
tion" now that France had admitted ft was responsible for the attack
on the ship at Auckland, New Zealand, on July 10. One person was
killed when the ship exploded.
In Paris, new French Defense Minister Paul Quiles said his initial
investigations showed many files on the affair had been destroyed.
He ordered an immediate inquiry as soon as he took over Saturday
following the resignation of his predecessor, Charles Hernu.
Speaking in Wellington, Lange said New Zealand had begun
proceedings to seek full compensation for invasion of New Zealand's
sovereignty, the loss of the vessel and the man who died, a photog
rapher.
But perhaps the biggest claim would be for the cost of the investi
gation, which turned into the biggest police probe in New Zealand's
history.
Lange said New Zealand still wants to know exactly who in the
French governmernt ordered the bombing, and had a right to expect
action would be taken against those responsible.
"The idea that acting under orders of a foreign power gives
anyone a licence to execute criminal acts in another country with im
punity and remain inviolate from prosecution or sanction is, of
course, quite absurd," Lange said.
"If this became the state of affairs which governs the international
relationships between countries, there would be sheer anarchy."
A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said Prime Minister
Laurent Fabius, who acknowledged French responsibility for the
sinking of the Greenpeace ship, had sent a message to New Zealand
Prime Minister David Lange saying he was "distressed" by the
diplomatic consequences of the "Greenpeace affair." The Socialist
government now finds itself with a choice of being accused either of
participation in a coverup or of incompetence in failing to control its
secret services.
Soviets to Offer 40 Percent Cut
WASHINGTON — Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
is expected to offer a 40 percent cut in offensive nuclear weapons
when he details the Kremlin's latest arms offer during a meeting with
Secretary of State George Shultz, a knowledgeable congressional
source predicted yesterday.
Shevardnadze, at the session with Shultz Wednesday at the United
Nations, is also expected to propose a limit of 60 percent on how
much of a nation's nuclear force can be concentrated in land-based
missiles, said the source, who spoke on the condition he not be iden
tified.
The remainder of the nuclear arsenal would be divided between
submarine-based missiles and bombers.
South Africa May Move Zulus
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Despite recent promises by
the South African government that no more blacks would be forcibly
resettled, a government commission recommended yesterday that
42,000 Zulus be moved out of their traditional homes to make way
for whites.
Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi. leader of South Africa's 6 mil
lion Zulus and chief minister of the Kwazulu tribal homeland, immedi
ately rejected the proposals for reshaping and expanding Kwazulu as
a formula for extending apartheid. South Africa's system of racial
separation and minority white rule.
Buthelezi, noting that the government has pledged several times
this year to end its forced resettlement of blacks, said: "It is tragic
that the commission pursues its now-outdated mandate as though we
were still living in an earlier era. This is finalizing a prescription for
disaster."
Meanwhile, in the continuing civil unrest, six more deaths were
reported yesterday. Three of the victims were black policemen.
