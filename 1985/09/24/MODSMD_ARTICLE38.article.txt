# Schultz Attacks Soviets at UN
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS —' Secretary of State
George Shultz, addressing the opening session
of the U.N. General Assembly, accused the So
viet Union and its allies yesterday of colonialism,
tyranny, propaganda and religious persecution.
But he said the United States would "more
than match" any Soviet gesture of goodwill at the
forthcoming summit in Geneva.
Shultz attacked Soviet foreign policy from Af
ghanistan to Central America, chided Moscow on
human rights abuses at home and contended that
the Soviets are blocking progress on arms con
trol.
His speech contained no new proposals. It
was intended as a rebuttal to what Washington
considers a Soviet propaganda offensive in ad
vance of the Nov. 19-20 meeting of President
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
was to reply today when he addresses the Gen
eral Assembly. Shevardnadze was in New York
yesterday but was not present for Shultz'
speech.
Shultz and Shevardnadze are scheduled to talk
privately tomorrow in New York and the Soviet
foreign minister plans to meet the president at
the White House on Friday to put the finishing
touches on plans for the Reagan-Gorbachev
meeting.
"The United States and the Soviet Union now
have an historic opportunity to reduce the risk of
war," Shultz said. "President Reagan looks for
ward to his meeting with General Secretary Gor

bachev in November. . . Soviet acts of good
faith and willingness to reach fair agreements will
be more than matched on the American side."
In contrast to White House efforts to avoid
raising expectations for the summit, Shultz said
the United States hopes for a "productive

meeting" that will advance relations between the
two countries across the board.
He said Moscow is to blame for East-West
tension and for the lack of progress at U.S.-
Soviet arms negotiations in Geneva.
"We have offered trade-offs and made clear
our readiness to take account of legitimate So
viet concerns," he said. "Progress at Geneva
has been slow. Thus far, the Soviet Union has
not negotiated with the responsiveness that the
talks require."
Responding to Soviet charges that U.S. "Star
Wars" research program is the main sticking
point in the negotiations, Shult2 said that Mos
cow's military space program is older and more
comprehensive than Washington's.
"The Soviet leaders know full well their own
efforts in these fields," he said. "Their
propaganda about American programs is
blatantly one-sided and not to be taken
seriously."
As for the U.S. plan for a space-based defense
system, Shultz said, "Our goal is not to achieve
superiority but to add to the security of both
sides."
The annual American and Soviet presentations
at the start of the U.N. session traditionally set
the terms for East-West relations in the coming
months. This year, with the first U.S.-Soviet
summit since former President Jimmy Carter
met with the late Leonid F3rezhnev in 1979 less
than two months away, the speeches take on
added significance.

criticized the Soviet Union but vowed to
attempt an accord at November's summit
