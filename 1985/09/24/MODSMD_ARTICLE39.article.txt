# SAT Scores Continue Steady Rise
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Average
scores on the Scholastic Aptitude
Test rose for the fourth year in a
row and marked the largest single
year gain in 22 years, the College
Board announced yesterday in New
York.
Minority students led the surge,
with Mexican-American and Puerto
Rican students posting the highest
gains, and Asian students still
leading the nation in math scores.
Despite the rises, black students
lagged more than 100 points behind
whites in both reading and math
categories. Fewer blacks took the
test this year than last year, which
experts suggested reflects the fact
that fewer blacks are entering col
lege. —
The improvements this year ran
across all categories, for both men
and women and in almost every
geographic area. But the scores are
still a combined total of 74 points
behind the all-time high of 1963,
when math scores were 502 and

verbal was 478. After that year,
SAT scores began to slide.
Education Secretary William
Bennett and College Board Presi
dent George Hanford immediately
cited the higher test scores as proof
that the nation's educational reform
movement has taken root in class
rooms across the country.
Nationally, verbal scores jumped
five points, to 431, while math
scores climbed four points, to 475.
State-by-state comparisons of
SAT scores are somewhat artificial,
since in some states — Mississippi,
for example — only 3 percent of the
eligible high school seniors both
ered to take it, and they were the
best and the brightest of that poor
state's struggling school system.
With so few Mississippi students
taking the test, they scored an un
usually high 489 on verbal and 528
on math.
Also, the SAT test is voluntary,
usually taken by about a million
college-bound students each year.

Its results can at best only be used
to track the changes in academic
performance over the years of
those college-bound students who
choose to take it.
Still, the SAT test has taken on a
kind of symbolic significance as a
barometer of America's educational
system. When the scores hit rock
bottom in 1980, the cry came for a
massive overhaul of the public
school system and the launching of
an educational reform revolution.
Now, the progress of that move
ment is most often measured in
terms of how much SAT scores
have improved.
President Reagan last year set a
goal of stopping the decline from
1963's high in SAT scores by 1990.
This year's good news of the
higher scores is coupled with other,
more sobering statistics. Almost
2,000 fewer black students this
year chose to take the SAT test —
the nation's most widely used
college-entrance examination — in

dicating that black college enroll
ment for the upcoming year could
continue to fall.
Also, the blacks who did take the
test, while posting significant gains,
still trailed far behind white test
takers. Blacks scored an average of
346 on the verbal portion and 376
on math; whites scored 449 verbal
and 491 on math.
Other minority groups, while
posting gains, still lagged behind
white students. For example,
Puerto Ricans scored 368 on verbal
— a 10-point gain over 1984 — but
still trailed white students by 81
points. Mexican-Americans scored
383 on verbal, a six-point gain, but
that left them 67 points behind
whites.
One minority group — Asians —
scored substantially above all other
groups including whites. Asians
averaged 518 on the math test to
491 for whites; Asians ranked
second among ethnic groups on the
verbal test, scoring 404.
