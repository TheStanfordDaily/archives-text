Reagan for Free Trade
WASHINGTON — Hoping to head off
protectionist sentiment in Congress, Presi
dent Reagan yesterday promised to veto any
bills "that I believe will harm economic growth,
cause loss of jobs and diminish international
trade."
But his warning, coupled with Sunday's an
nouncement of a new determination by the
United States and its allies to drive down the
exchange value of the dollar, failed to persuade
members of Congress to alter their plans for
action to restrict imports.
Reagan vowed to safeguard American indus
tries and said he will cooperate with Congress
in toughening trade laws to prevent the
"dumping" of foreign goods in the United
States at less than the cost of production. But
his veto threat marked the first time he has
delivered an unequivocal personal warning to

Congress, which seems poised to rush
through passage of restrictive legislation.
The president cautioned that protectionist
measures would drive up prices and invite
retaliation by U.S. trading partners, wiping out
jobs in this country. "We would lose markets
... we would lose jobs, and we would lose our
prosperity," he said.
Presser Linked to Mob
WASHINGTON — Mafia families in
Chicago, Cleveland and New York played
central roles in the selection of Teamsters
Union President Jackie Presser and his im
mediate predecessor, Roy Williams, a Mafia
underboss-turned-informant has told the FBI.
In statements that provide an unusually
detailed account of mob involvement in the
scandal-plagued union's internal politics, An

gelo Lonardo said that he and alleged mob
financier Milton Rockman traveled between
the three cities to line up Mafia support for the
two men.
Stocks Soar
NEW YORK — Stocks soared to their best
gain in three months Monday after the dollar
tumbled against other major currencies in
worldwide foreign exchange.
The dollar's slide — its worst one-day loss
since being devalued in 1973 — was triggered
by the announcement Sunday that the United
States, Britain, West Germany, France and
Japan would jointly try to lower the dollar's
value.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
17 points in the opening 30 minutes, finished
with a 18.37-point gain at 1,316.31 — its best
showing since climbing 24.75 points June 21.
