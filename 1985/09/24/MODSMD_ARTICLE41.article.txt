Workfare Launched
LOS ANGELES — An unprecedented alli
ance between liberals and conservatives has
launched a California work-for-welfare pro
gram that many experts expect to become
standard nationwide.
The "workfare" program, which proponents
say will save $100 million in its first year, re
quires able-bodied welfare recipients to work
or risk losing benefits. The Democratic
controlled legislature passed the bill over
whelmingly Sept. 14, and a spokesman for Re
publican Gov. George Deukmejian said he will
sign it tomorrow.
Objections from welfare-rights advocates
have been eased or overcome by unique provi
sions providing job training and child care for
recipients and exempting parents with children
under age 7. Experts say those elements will
turn workfare into a key platform plank for
Democrats weary of the "pro-welfare" label

and bring the idea to other communities, in
cluding Washington.
Some welfare officials remain opposed to
forcing jobs on poor parents with children of
any age. Opponents of the California plan have
questioned whether taxpayers will continue to
provide enough money for effective job train
ing and child care. But the objections have
failed to mute the enthusiasm of workfare sup
porters celebrating a remarkable political tri
umph.
Murdoch Engulfs Fox
LOS ANGELES — Publishing magnate
Rupert Murdoch, who bought half of 20th Cen
tury Fox Film Corp. six months ago for $250

The sale by Denver oil man Marvin Davis

was the latest in a series of shuffles by major
entertainment operations.
The agreement announced yesterday was
between News America Holdings Inc., a sub
sidiary of Murdoch's News Corp., and a Davis
family company, TCF Holdings Inc.

ber offering to remodel Hedgecock's home at
cost.
