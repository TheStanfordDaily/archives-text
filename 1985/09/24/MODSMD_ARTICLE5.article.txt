## Soviet psychiatrist center of controversy 
### MARK BEYREIS Staff writer 
Four Soviet members of the Interna
tional Physicians for the Prevention of Nu
clear War (IPPNW) visited the University
yesterday for a series of programs and
meetings they said were designed to fur
ther the cause of arms control.
Sponsored and organized by the
Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR),
a group autonomous from IPPNW, the
event was one of several stops for the So
viet physicians, part of a larger group sent
by the IPPNW. The other members are
currently touring in the eastern United
States.

"The object is to get additional informa
tion on activities of PSR and establish new
contacts," said Academician Leonid Iliyin,
head of the delegation and vice-president of
the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences, as
he described his goals for the visit in a
press conference yesterday afternoon.
But in a round table discussion that took
place last night at Fairchild Auditorium, a
number of the questions from the floor ad
dressed one of the delegate's connections
with the Soviet's alleged use of psychiatry
for political purposes.
That delegate, Marat Vartanyan, deputy
director of the Soviet Center for Mental
Health, was lying when he claimed the So
viet Union was not guilty of abuses of psy

chiatry', according to Vladimir Bukovsky, a
Stanford graduate student who has written
books on the practice of psychiatry in the
Soviet Union. Vartanyan is a generally
recognized spokesman for the Soviet Union
on the subject of mental health.
Other members of the group include:
Academician Simon Khechinashville, dean
of the Tibilisi Institute for Medical Post-
Graduate Education; and Prof. Galina
Savelyeva, head of the Department of
Obstetrics and Gynecology, Second Medi
cal Institute of Moscow. All the members
