Gifts
Gifts to the University during the
fiscal year that ended Aug- 31
totaled a record $125 million, ac
cording to Board of Trustees Presi
dent Warren Christopher.
The total for the previous year
was $112 million.
Bequests and gifts from individ
uals and corporations all set new
records. Included in the corporate
total of $36.5 million were gifts of
equipment, mostly computers,
worth $13.1 million.
The Stanford Annual Fund
received $14 million from alumni,
parents and friends, also a record.
During the year, the fund success
fully completed a three-year chal
lenge program that earned $2 mil
lion in matching funds from the
James Irvine Foundation. Almost
44,000 donors made gifts to the
fund during the year.
"Donors continue to support
Stanford generously," Christopher
said. "The University is extremely
grateful to all who sustain its mis
sions of teaching, research and ser
vice."

Engineering fund
J. Reid Anderson, founder of
Verbatim Corp., and his wife,
Folly, have given the School of En
gineering $750,000 to support inno
vative teaching and research.
Income from this fund will be
used to help support research in
opto-electronics by Electrical Engi
neering Prof. Joseph Goodman,
among other projects, according to
Prof. James Gibbons, dean of the
school.
Holder of 30 U.S. patents, An
derson served as chairman of Ver
batim until its acquisition last May
by Eastman Kodak.
He and his wife live in Los Altos,
but neither attended Stanford.
"Having been in the Bay Area for
27 years, we feel that Stanford is
part of us. We're happy to support
the very fine School of Engineering
and Dean Gibbons' programs," An
derson said.
New microbiology chair
Dr. Hugh McDevitt, Joseph D.
Grant professor of medical
microbiology and medicine, has

been appointed chairman of the de
partment of medical microbiology at
the Stanford School of Medicine,
Dean David Korn announced.
The appointment will be effective
Jan. 1, 1986.
McDevitt, 55, noted for his work
on the genetic control of the
immune system, has been on the
Stanford faculty since 1966. He will
succeed Dr. Stanley Falkow, pro
fessor of microbiology, who served
as chairman since 1981.
Falkow, widely recognized for
his work on the application of
modern concepts and technologies
of molecular biology to problems of
human infection and development of
vaccines, will return to full-time
teaching and research.
Medical microbiology is one of
three basic science departments in
the medical school with a system of
rotating chairmanships, Korn said.
Business
Two Stanford Business School
faculty members, William Beaver
and Jeffrey Pfeffer, have been ap
pointed to endowed professorships,
Dean Robert Jaedicke announced.

Beaver was named the Joan E.
Horngren Professor of Accounting,
the first professorship in University
history to be endowed by a current
faculty member.
Beaver is nationally recognized
for his pioneering research on how
accounting information in corporate
financial statements affects security
prices. His current research deals
with a study of the financial report
ing of banks and its connection with
the structure of share prices.
Pfeffer, who was named the
Thomas D. Dee II Professor of Or
ganizational Behavior, has achieved
wide recognition for his fundamen
tal research that examines the
relationships between the structure
and behavior of organizations and
the characteristics of their environ
ment.
His recent research has focused
on the demography of organiza
tions, including its effects on turn
over in top management groups.
English
Diane Middlebrook, poet, critic
and professor of English, has been

Jessie T. VVatkins professorship, ef

Middlebrook, whose research
centers on modern poetry, has
taught at Stanford since 1966. She
served as director of the Center for
Research on Women from 1977 to
1979 and has devoted much of her
work over the past several years to
women's writing and feminist
literary theory.

nier, English, and Carla Shatz,

neurobiology, members-at-large;

First Ph. I)
The School of Earth Sciences has
received a unique gift: the diploma
presented to geologist George Hall
Ashley at Stanford Commencement
in 1894, the first doctorate of phil
osophy degree ever awarded by the
University.
Damaged by fire, but still
readable, the diploma was pre
sented to Dean Allan Cox and Prof.
James C. Ingle, chairman of the Ge
ology Department, by Ashley's
granddaughter, Helen Ross Stan
ley.
Ingle plans to have the document
restored.
Ashley had a distinguished career
culminating in his appointment as
Pennsylvania state geologist. Be
tween 1910 and 1944, he was in
cluded among the 1,000 leading
American scientists in six editions
of American Men of Science.
ity extended their invitation, ac
cording to PSR.
Vartanyan said he could
"guarantee as a psychiatrist" that no
one mentally healthy had been insti
tutionalized in a mental hospital. "I
am convinced of that fact," he
added.
The World Psychiatric Asssocia
tion (WPA) in the past has
denounced the alledged abuses in
the Soviet Union.
Vartanyan claimed the WPA was
politically motivated in its criticism
of the Soviet Union. The Soviet
Union withdrew from the WPA last
year because of this politicization,
according to Vartanyan.
According to Bukovsky, a few
dozen inmates of Soviet mental in
stitutions, including Bukovsky him
self, have come to the west, been

examined by Western doctors and
declared sane.
Bukovsky, who was held in con
centration camps for 12 years, also
said Vartanyan had diagnosed dissi
dent Leoni Plushch as being insane
and that Plushch later would be
declared sane by Western psychia
trists.
Bukovsky, who is involved in
neuroscience research here, also
criticized the PSR for "giving Var
tanyan a platform from which to
speak."
Gary Lapid, former president of
the local chapter of the PSR,
responded to criticism that the PSR
should not meet with Vartanyan,
saying, "I can't see how not getting
to know one another is going to
help."
Lapid said there were many
areas of conflict between the two
superpowers but that they should
attempt "to get to the truth . . .
(to) what is accurate."

Dr. Judith Murphy, currently co
president of the local PSR chapter,
also said the PSR should not refuse
to meet with Vartanyan.
"As best as we know, (abuse of
psychiatry) does go on, but if we sit
down and talk, we are more likely
to grow together (on the subject of
arms control)," she said.
Bukovsky disagreed with
Murphy. "I think it's the wrong ap
proach. We will not get peace by
being nice to them. It has never
happened before," he said.
He claimed the PSR "played into
(Soviet) hands" by accepting Var
tanyan as a member of the panel.
Just before yesterday's news
conference, Lapid protested
reporters' addressing of the issue
of Vartanyan's presence. "You're
coming in here looking for trouble
and end up making it,"he said.
Members of the Soviet delega
tion also protested the raising of the
psychiatry issue at the press con

ference.
"You're not interested in the
truth. You're just interested in har
ming our relationship just to save
your young life," Vartanyan told
The Daily when the validity of his
presence was contested.
When the subject of Vartanyan's
presence came up in the evening's
round table discussion, Murphy
said, "1 do not accept nor approve
of what goes on (in the Soviet
Union)."
She added that the two super
powers could not rely on trust but
that there were issues, including the
proposed Test Ban Treaty, which
she said could be verified by cur
rent surveillance techniques.
Murphy found both good and bad
in the round table discussion that
featured the four Soviets and Lapid,
Murphy and Coit Blacker, associate
director of the Center for Interna
tional Security and Arms Control.
"Tonight was not what I hoped it

would be," she said. It was not as
candid an exchange as they had
hoped, she added.
On the other hand, Murphy cited
the fact that the panel "generated
activity and got people thinking" as
a benefit.
"The goal was to present the
reality of the Soviet people. What
we got was the reality of the Soviet
official. Some may find it annoying,
but we have to live and deal with
it," she added.
During the section when panel
members posed questions to one
another, Iliyin noted a competitive
ness between the superpowers in
the area of nuclear weapons.
"Remember who started the
arms race. Who built the first
atomic bomb or the first nuclear
submarine?" he asked.
"We have to react to challenges
by your Administration after five or
six years. So it is a competition," he
added.
