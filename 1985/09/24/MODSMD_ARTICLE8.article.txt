# Oval's Ears Beautified in Project
## 
### LIZ EGAN Staff writer 
Work is now under way on a proj
ect to beautify the Oval's "ears" â€”
the two buffer areas separating the
Oval from the Graduate School of
Business on the east and Herrin
Hall and the Old Chemistry Building
on the west.
After an earlier anonymous gift
funded improvements for the Oval
itself, the University began consid
ering plans for other ways to en
hance the main entrance to the
campus, according to Judy Chan,

associate director of planning.
The three-acre ears will undergo
changes designed to "refine them
without making them elaborate,"
Chan said. The improved areas will
complement, not compete with, the
more formal Oval, she added.
Reaction to the improvements
has been mixed. David Northway, a
senior in art design, said the im
provements will make "an impres
sive entrance to the University."
But one professor walking along the
Oval said, "The less they do, the
better." He did not wish to be iden
tified.
The beautification project was in

spired by a donation from Harry and
Norma Le Claire of Atherton, who
noticed that the Oval's ears did not
match the splendor of the inner
Oval, which is a large grassy area
with flowers and paths. "It was
Stanford's front yard and it looked
like a mess," said Harry Le Claire.
Le Claire, a Stanford alumnus, is
chairman and founder of TAB Prod
ucts of Palo Alto.
Berkeley landscape architect
Ortha Zebroski, the University con
tractor for the work, said "the ears
offer privacy and seclusion, near at
hand, to those who seek these en
vironmental attributes." And by

"cleaning up" the ears, the whole
entrance area will be a "spiffier
place," she said.
In addition to approximately 60
Coast Live Oaks growing in the
buffers, the west ear contains
several olive trees and a memorial
grove of redwoods planted in 1915.
The wild grasses in both ears grow
to about three feet, but tend to dry
out in the spring, posing a fire haz
ard.
The improvement project in
cludes an "experimental feeding to
reduce the height of the annual
grasses that come up everywhere,
and to introduce a mixture of low

grasses and wildflowers that will
survive and perpetuate without ir
rigation," said Zebroski.
The project also calls for planting
more oaks, regrading the slopes
and planting a ring of three-foot
shrubs around the perimeter of
each ear. "The idea is to maintain
an informal green look all around,"
Zebroski said.
According to construction
manager Don Hoppe, the grass,
shrubs and flowers will not be seen
for a few months, but the dirt foot
paths have already been upgraded
to asphalt. Some benches may be
added later, Chan said.

Freccero dies
Diane Freccero, a dancer and
teaching associate in the Physical
Education Department, died Sunday
from internal cancer. Memorial
services will be held Thursday at 5
p.m. in Memorial Church. In lieu of
flowers, the family would like
friends to send donations to the
American Cancer Society.
