OPPORTUNITIES for
ACADEMIC PEER TUTORING
Sophomores, juniros and seniors who want to become
paid academic peer tutors please contact the Center
for Teaching and Learning immediately. We
particularly need people in math and the sciences, but
welcome tutors in all academic fields. Undergraduate
tutors must register for and take a 1 unit, pass/no credit
course unless they have already done so, in which
case they simply need to come by the CTL office to be
reinstated. Please come to:
