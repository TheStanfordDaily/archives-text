# Twenty-three Face Cheating Charge
## 
### DAVID EMERSON Staff writer 
Twenty-three students who took Psychology 001
last spring are currently under University scrutiny for
allegedly cheating on one or more exams, sparking the
single largest investigation of University Honor Code
violations in Stanford history.
The students, who were among 744 enrolled in Prof.
Philip Zimbardo's popular class, were identified
through comparisons of their computer-graded

Scantron answer sheets.
The names of the 23 have not been released, in ac
cordance with University policy.
The first indication that cheating may have occured
came in the form of about a half dozen anonymous com
plaints to Mary Parpel, the only graduate teaching as
sistant assigned to the course. Then, after receiving an
unsigned letter from a student upset that she was
working hard and only getting a B while others were
doing as well or better through cheating, Zimbardo
read the letter out loud to the whole class with the
warning that any cheating would be dealt with "as

harshly as we know how."
"I assumed that would be the end of it," Zimbardo
said.
As Parpel was collecting test packets in Kresge
Auditorium from the final make-up session of the quar
ter, however, a student entered the lobby and handed
the TA two Scantrons, signed by two different stu
dents.
Although Zimbardo had forbidden tests to be taken
outside of Kresge due to the earlier reports of cheat
ing, the student claimed to be ignorant of the prohibi
tion.

Suspicious, Parpel checked both Scantrons and
found thein to have identical answers. Further investi
gation revealed that the students lived at the same ad
dress.
"I felt outraged, both as a teacher and a graduate
student," Parpel told University News Service. "It
was obvious that the student had gone home, looked
up the answers and returned."
From there, the investigation widened.
Working over the summer, Paipel and Rose McDer-
mott, an undergraduate teaching
assistant, reviewed the 7,000
Scantrons used by the class.
When sorted into separate piles
for each of the 744 students in the
class, Parpel found that tests sup
posedly taken by the same student
varied significantly in handwriting
and test scores.
"Scantrons are like finger
prints," she said. "Some make light
marks, others very dark. Each per
son has quite an individual style."
In one case, a group of three stu
dents were found to have exactly
the same answers — correct and
incorrect — on a test.
Parpel terms the discovery "a
really painful experience."
"Twenty-three people is not a
huge proportion of the class, but 1
don't think that's everybody who
cheated," she said. In addition to
the 23 students now being inves
tigated, Parpel said that a few
others seemed suspicious, but that
the evidence was not as conclusive.
The list of possible code of
fenders was turned over to Sally
Cole, the University judicial affairs
officer.
Cole says she is "in the process
of looking into the charges" and will
not comment on them directly until
she has completed her investiga
tion. Her job is to determine
whether the evidence supports the
complaint and, if so, to lodge formal
charges with the Office of Student
Affairs.
She plans to personally interview
each of the students involved and
says she has "no idea" how long the

investigation will take.
If she decides to charge a stu
dent. the case will be referred to
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons, who will notify the student
of the charges and inform the stu
dent of available options.
If charged, a student can: admit
guilt and request the dean or the
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC) to
recommend penalties; admit the
facts of the case but deny that they
constitute a violation of the honor
code — in which case the SJC inter
prets the code: or contest the facts
— in which case the facts will be
determined by an independent
hearing officer appointed by the
University and then referred to the
SJC.
The SJC, which consists ot three
student and three faculty members
appointed by the University presi
dent, decides the case and recom
mends what punishment — if any
— is appropriate.
President Donald Kennedy then
has the option to accept or reject
the recommendation.
In the past, incidents of individual
cheating on a single test have been
punished by a grade of no credit in
the class and suspension from the
University for a quarter, according
to Lyons.
Incidents of multiple cheating
have been punished with suspen
sions of as much as two years.
Zimbardo, who declined further
comment last night, told University
News Service earlier yesterday
that the whole incident is "very
distressing. It demeans the course.
It means that a stupid grade is more
important than the integrity of the
student, the department or the Uni
versity."

not comment on them directly until
she has completed her investiga
tion. Her job is to determine
whether the evidence supports the
complaint and, if so, to lodge formal
charges with the Office of Student
Affairs.
She plans to personally interview
each of the students involved and
says she has "no idea" how long the

investigation will take.
If she decides to charge a stu
dent. the case will be referred to
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons, who will notify the student
of the charges and inform the stu
dent of available options.
If charged, a student can: admit
guilt and request the dean or the
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC) to
recommend penalties; admit the
facts of the case but deny that they
constitute a violation of the honor
code — in which case the SJC inter
prets the code: or contest the facts
— in which case the facts will be
determined by an independent
hearing officer appointed by the
University and then referred to the
SJC.
The SJC, which consists ot three
student and three faculty members
appointed by the University presi
dent, decides the case and recom
mends what punishment — if any
— is appropriate.
President Donald Kennedy then
has the option to accept or reject
the recommendation.
In the past, incidents of individual
cheating on a single test have been
punished by a grade of no credit in
the class and suspension from the
University for a quarter, according
to Lyons.
Incidents of multiple cheating
have been punished with suspen
sions of as much as two years.
Zimbardo, who declined further
comment last night, told University
News Service earlier yesterday
that the whole incident is "very
distressing. It demeans the course.
It means that a stupid grade is more
important than the integrity of the
student, the department or the Uni
versity."
