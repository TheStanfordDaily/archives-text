# Twenty-three Face Cheating Charge

### DAVID EMERSON Staff writer 
Twenty-three students who took Psychology 001
last spring are currently under University scrutiny for
allegedly cheating on one or more exams, sparking the
single largest investigation of University Honor Code
violations in Stanford history.
The students, who were among 744 enrolled in Prof.
Philip Zimbardo's popular class, were identified
through comparisons of their computer-graded

Scantron answer sheets.
The names of the 23 have not been released, in ac
cordance with University policy.
The first indication that cheating may have occured
came in the form of about a half dozen anonymous com
plaints to Mary Parpel, the only graduate teaching as
sistant assigned to the course. Then, after receiving an
unsigned letter from a student upset that she was
working hard and only getting a B while others were
doing as well or better through cheating, Zimbardo
read the letter out loud to the whole class with the
warning that any cheating would be dealt with "as

harshly as we know how."
"I assumed that would be the end of it," Zimbardo
said.
As Parpel was collecting test packets in Kresge
Auditorium from the final make-up session of the quar
ter, however, a student entered the lobby and handed
the TA two Scantrons, signed by two different stu
dents.
Although Zimbardo had forbidden tests to be taken
outside of Kresge due to the earlier reports of cheat
ing, the student claimed to be ignorant of the prohibi
tion.

Suspicious, Parpel checked both Scantrons and
found thein to have identical answers. Further investi
gation revealed that the students lived at the same ad
dress.
"I felt outraged, both as a teacher and a graduate
student," Parpel told University News Service. "It
was obvious that the student had gone home, looked
up the answers and returned."
From there, the investigation widened.
