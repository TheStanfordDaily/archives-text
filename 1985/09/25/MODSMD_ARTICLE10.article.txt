There were lines on the mirror.
There were lines on her face.
They pretended not to notice.
They were caught in the race . . .
Life in the fast lane.
"Life in the Fast Lane," The Eagles
The Eagles definitely did not have Stanford
registration in mind when they linked lines with the
fast life. Fortunately though, for those of us who
spent multiple hours standing in lines at Memorial
Auditorium and Maples Pavilion, a faster life may
soon be available.
Speed, in the form of registration by mail, should
be here by winter quarter, and it's about time. Ac
cording to Asst. Registrar Bob Thompson, the cur
rent stand-in-lots-of-lines registration system has
been around at least since World War 11.
In that time, Stanford has become the heart of
Silicon Valley, the home of enough complex equip
ment to monitor a space shuttle flight and generally
one of the world's centers for technological innova
tion. The proposed registration system, now being
tested in the School of Earth Sciences, finally
applies some of that intellectual progress to the
problem of registration at Stanford.
The key to the new registration system is the
Network for Student Information. NSI, which has
been under construction for one-and-one-half years,

is a computerized information pool joining offices
ranging from the Undergraduate Admissions Office
to the dean of graduate studies. It will enable one
person at a computer terminal to call up a student's
status, her financial aid information and her aca
demic standing, among other things.
According to Thompson, the development of the
system has been awaiting the arrival of "good" tech
nology that would insure a database that is both ac
curate and secure. Evidently that technology is now
here, and it creates numerous advantages.
In addition to saving the time of students who for
merly stood in line, it will save the time of adminis
trators who now shuffle things like PTRs. No more
standing in one line for financial aid vouchers and
then in another line to apply that to your bill.
The speed with which the new registration sys
tem is implemented depends upon how well it func
tions during registration for the School of Earth
Sciences, where its bugs are being worked out.
Thompson says the preliminary results are encour
aging. "Overall, it (registration at earth sciences)
seems ... to have gone very smoothly," he said
yesterday.
Eliminating the lines at Maples and Mem Aud is an
appealing idea, and we thank those who are helping
make it possible. With any luck, those lines will join
World War II by winter quarter â€” comfortably
settled in the annals of history.
