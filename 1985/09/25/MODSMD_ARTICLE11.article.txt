## Unfair Regulations Limit AT & T 
### 
The article to which I refer in this letter was pub
lished in the Monday, Sept. 23 issue with a title of
"Reach Out: How To Phone for Less."
I have objections to the following sentence from this
article: "The bigwig of the long distance carriers,
AT&T seems to have enough faith in its popularity to
charge higher rates than any other company."
First of all, the phrases "bigwig of the long distance
carriers" and "enough faith in its popularity ..." com
municate to me a distinct anti-AT&T tone which I do
not believe belongs in a non-editorial article.

VIEWPOINT

Secondly, AT&T is not charging higher rates due to
confidence in its popularity or even greed. It is doing
so because of government regulations. At this point in
time, AT&T is closely regulated by government com
missions, while other long distance carriers are given
relatively free reign. AT&T has repeatedly submitted
requests to those commissions for rate reductions —
only to have them denied. When these requests have
been granted, they have been granted on a delayed
time schedule with smaller reductions than requested
by AT&T.
It is well known that AT&T has been subsidizing
local service with overpriced long distance service for
years, and they are now trying to remedy that — but
the government won't let them! (Three cheers for gov
ernment intervention.) AT&T has also been forced to
continue service to all areas of the country, while
others take only the cream.
In addition, AT&T must make public their plans for
rate reductions and any new service offerings — some
thing MCI, Sprint, etc. don't have to do. How many
companies would have gone out of business if they had
to announce new products six months to a year in ad
vance? This gives the other companies just enough
time to "come up with" a new service or rate reduction
"just before" or "just a little better than" AT&T's.
What it amounts to is government-run, industrial


espionage against AT&T.
When you consider all of this and the fact that
AT&T has a far superior quality of service, it seems to
me that AT&T should be commended for a job well
done rather than being berated for being a "bigwig" and
for being audacious enough to charge higher prices.
