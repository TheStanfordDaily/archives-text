I sympathize with Tom Fan
tacone's consternation concerning
the graduate school's residency
requirements, i.e., its tuition re
quirements. As a master's student,
he has been confronted with a
situation that undergraduates do
not face and that Ph. D. candidates
accept as a matter of course.
Stanford University does indeed
impose entirely separate fiscal and
academic standards of progress on
its graduate students. Not only
must graduate students satisfy the
requirements put forth by their
departments, they must also pur
chase their credentials from the
graduate school by paying a certain
minimum fee, sometimes in a lump
sum. Similar fiscal requirements
pervade most of this nation's
graduate schools. I know this to be
true because I have attended more
than a few of these institutions.
This state of affairs makes it seem
unlikely to me that Fantacone's
protests will bear fruit.
However, Fantacone's confusion
and disillusionment are indicative of
another very important issue. The
graduate school is not a school by
any stretch of the imagination. It is
an accounting operation whose
academic responsibilities and ca
pacities are nil. Unfortunately, the
graduate school persists in main
taining the pretense that it is
something other than a hive of
bookkeepers. This pretense is
probably meant to deflect
criticisms of exactly the type
leveled by Fantacone, i.e., that
academic degrees should be
accessed by satisfying purely aca
demic requirements rather than by
meeting fiscal standards.
Fantacone has suffered pain and
frustration for committing the
crime of expecting the graduate
school to be what it pretends to
be. The language in which the
graduate school couches its opera

tions has exceeded the bounds of
euphemism. The Stanford graduate
school and its officers are expertly
engaged in a deliberate, sanc
tioned, institutionalized program of
deception designed to obscure the
fiscal nature of the standards of
progress to which the University
subscribes. And I, like Fantacone,
am tired of watching them go un
challenged.

I do not wish to respond to the
ravings of O.L. Brannaman of
Sacramento. I do, however, wish
to recommend to the opinion page
editors of The Daily that they
exercise a little editorial discretion
in publishing letters, especially in
publishing letters from persons
outside of the Stanford community.
It is my belief that editors should
ask themselves whether letters (or
columns) submitted for publication
will educate readers or elucidate
issues in any significant way.
As a student here, I am inter
ested in what thoughtful students,
faculty and staff have to say on
various issues. Had Mr. or Ms.
Brannaman said something intelli
gent about U.S. policy in the
Mideast, instead of ranting about
"Rabbi Reagan," I might have
learned something. Were Mr. or
Ms. Brannaman a member of the
Stanford community, I would, at
least, have learned about the anger
borne by someone on campus. As
it is, however, I only learned that
there's an irrational person in
Sacramento who probably couldn't
get his opinions published closer to
home.
I suggest that The Stanford
Daily has better uses for its
valuable editorial space.

I realize that you guys have
been on vacation, but after reading
your orientation issue (Sept.

out to lunch! Your article "Tomes

Shirley Cobb's Bookstore and the
Plowshare on University Avenue.
Both bookstores have been out of
business since last spring, and
unfortunately no comparable stores
have replaced them. Does anyone
check out recycled stories over
there?
