## Department Introduces Novel Class Stanford Moves Up with Canadian Literature 
### BOB BASIL 
Canada ought to be hard to miss,
it's so big. But according to two
Canadian graduate students here,
hardly anyone in the States pays
close attention to Canada's
literature. So this quarter Katie
Trumpener and Deidre Lynch are
team-teaching a course entitled
"Canadian Literature: Women's
Writing."
"We got to Stanford," they say,
"and were surprised that there was
so little emphasis in the English De
partment's course offerings on
literature that didn't originate either
in England or the United States.
And we realized that if any
Canadian literature ever was to be
taught we would have to do it our
selves."
The class, sponsored by Prof.
Barbara Gelpi of the English De
partment and registered in both
the English and Feminist Studies
Departments as Ad Hoc Seminar
195, meets on Mondays and Wed
nesdays at 11 a.m. Undergradu
ates, graduates and auditors are all
welcome.
"This is the first time a course
like this has been taught at Stan
ford," Trumpener points out. "The

course really originated in a castle
in-the-air conversation Deidre and I
had about a 'dream syllabus' — and
in a sort of literary homesickness
for the authors we'd read while still
in Canada but whom no one here
had heard of.
"To the many people who asked,
'Is there a Canadian literature?' we
replied with an emphatic 'Yes, let
me lend you the books,' " Trum
pener says.
"One of the most exciting things

about Canadian literature," says
Lynch, "is its energy. So much is
being published, so many new
voices are being heard, recording
experiences that have remained un
recorded until now."
Canadian literature, say Trum
pener and Lynch, lacks the unifying
myths of American culture, so the
literary environment is far more
pluralistic.
"Ethnic writers form the main
stream," Lynch says, "because no

one is Canadian in any other sense
except 'ethnic Canadian.' "
Why the focus on women writ
ers? "The longer we were here,
the more we realized that women in
America do not dominate the
literary world. But in Canada they
do. Probably the most well-known
and most widely read authors in
Canada today are Margaret At
wood, Alice Munro, Margaret
Laurence, Mavis Gallant, Anne
Hebert and Marie-Claire Blais,"
says Lynch.
Why do women writers especially
speak for and to Canada? Trum
pener, who has published some of
her own poetry in an anthology of
Canadian writers, answers that
"The lack of an indigenous tradition
has been in many ways liberating.
Writers choose their own models,
models more congenial to women."
Lynch and Trumpener believe
that team-teaching their subject
makes perfect sense; Canadian
literature is so new that there can't
be a single point of view.
"We hope that we will only need
to supply background — this is a
discussion class. We aren't preach
ing to the converted. We hope
people will immerse themselves in
the literature."


"The Journal of Susanna Moodie," a book of poems by Mar
garet Atwood, and"The Double Hook" by Sheila Watson, are
two books featured in the new Canadian literature course.
