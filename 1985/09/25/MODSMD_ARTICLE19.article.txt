A Poem by Katie Trumpener
And as she sat sewing, and looked up to watch the snow fall, she pricked her
finger with the needle and three drops of blood fell into the snow.
Mathilda to Mary to Lida to Zoe to Effie, Klysta,
mother to daughter, linking loops, the chain stitch
of generations, sewing a genealogy, sewing
at a long sampler, their needles rising and falling
in time. Each girl wearing her maiden name,
ten years old, waiting to be married.
Their needles flash dimly in the light:
they sit by windows which look onto fields
and they sew the numbers from one to ten,
unending alphabets. All the girls in turn
are orphaned: Mathilda's mother dead
in the massacre, Mary's mother dead in smallpox,
Lida's mother dead in childbed.
One by one they each sew Jesus
and the woman at the well and slowly
the copied pattern shifts in its careful stitching
over and over till KJysta sews a lover's pair:
the couple stands by a wishing well,
Jesus holds the woman's hand,
doves fly through all the cutwork spaces.
Mathilda, Mary, Lida, Zoe, waiting
for their sons and daughters,
dropsy and tuberculosis, criss and cross,
cross, cross, stitch by stitch they sew their names,
waiting for husbands, forming the letters
to someday thread scarlet onto the linen
of their first wedded night: Effie sews
an E, then crosses for the long curve,
the encircling arm of the letter C.
Before her girl is ten years old,
Effie will hold hands with Jesus.
Klysta teaches herself the stitches.
Dove after dove she sews sailing to heaven.
