# Holiday Conflict Resolved
## 
### MARY MCDEVITT Staff writer 
Today classes start on the most solemn day of
the Jewish calendar, Yom Kippur, and many Jewish
students are upset. But the University will modify its
academic calendar in the future to avoid conflicts with
either Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur, Registrar Sally
Mahoney announced Monday.
Mahoney said in a memo to the Stanford community
that a revision will be made in autumn 1998 when the
religious holidays and the University's quarter calendar
again conflict. The Jewish High Holy Days will not con
flict with the Law School's autumn semester in this
century, she said.
The registrar's office is allowing students who are
staying home to observe Yom Kippur to register late
without penalty and has requested that "limited enroll
mcm" classes use the second class meeting to
compose the roster of enrolled students.
Some faculty members have canceled their classes
today and many Jewish worshippers are not attending
school in order to observe Yom Kippur, which began at
sundown yesterday and ends at sundown today.
"There is a very large number of Jewish students
and faculty who are observant, and (attending classes
on Yom Kippur) is offensive to them," said Professor
Joel Beinin, who canceled today's session of his Middle
East history class.
"I think it puts students in an unfair situation, forced
to choose between their education and their religion,"
agreed Humanities and Sciences lecturer Amy Sims. "I
think the University is a little bit insensitive. . .The
University wouldn't consider starting classes on
Christmas Eve, for example."
The Hillel Foundation, a B'nai B'rith organization for
Jewish students on campus, sent letters to all profes
sors requesting that they cancel their classes today.
"Students who want to observe Yom Kippur cannot
go to classes," said junior Mike Tuchin, co-chairman of
the Israel Action Committee.
Worshippers are not allowed to write, turn lights on
and off, drive a car or ride a bike, Tuchin said.
"We're supposed to pray and fast all day long," Tuc
hin said. "This is the holiest day of the year.
"The calendar is unfair, especially since (today) is
the first day of classes," he said."
The original requests to alter the University calen
dar by one day to avoid the conflict in future years
were made by seven faculty members to University
President Donald Kennedy in August.
