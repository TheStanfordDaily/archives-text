## CIS Focuses on Cleanliness 10,500 square feet for sub-micron research 
### NIKO SCHIFF Editorial Staff 
Stanford's Center for Integrated
Systems (CIS) is a $15 million
state of the art research laboratory
and office complex designed to
bring together the talents and inter
ests of University and industrial re
searchers.
The center bridges the gap be
tween industry and the University
with its joint membership of
Ph.D.s, graduate students and in
dustry experts who all work to
gether in the building's confines.
Twenty of the largest semi
conductor manufacturers in the
United States each provided
$750,000 for the construction of the
center, said Jim Burke, facilities co
ordinator. The center was also
funded with the assistance of the
federal government, which entered
the partnership with Stanford and
the corporations.
Drawing these three groups to
gether is helping to fight the costs
of the Very Large Scale Integration
(VLSI) research done at the center,
explained Burke.
The thrust of the center's re
search is to improve ways to
store, retrieve and communicate
knowledge. The VLSI research in

volves finding ways to place a large
number of small circuits onto a com
puter chip. One of the major goals
in the VLSI research is to place
more than a million integrated ele
ments on a one square centimeter
silicon chip while developing appli
cations on systems that would
make use of such devices.
The current capabilities of VLSI
research allow for about 100,000
circuits on a single square centime
ter chip. The goal of the VLSI re
searchers is to extend this to one to
ten million circuits. The main ad
vantages of this change are
decreased costs and increased ca
pabilities per chip.
Along with the VLSI research
being conducted in the CIS labs, ad
vanced research into computer
aided design (CAD) and processing
is being pursued.
One senior scientist from each
participating company conducts re
search in conjuction with the CIS
faculty and staff, said Burke. The
participation of these senior scien
tists from the business sector helps
focus CIS research on the actual
needs of industry and keeps Stan
ford researchers up to date on in
dustry's rapidly changing needs.
"Many of these companies have

received licenses from Stanford to
use technology developed in our
laboratories," Burke added.
CIS is also affiliated with other
non-sponsor companies.
The silicon wafers that hold com
puter chips are also being improved
upon. The 2-3 inch wafers that are
currently in use are hoped to be ex
panded to an 4 inch length, ex
plained Burke.
Research into computer interface
simulation and robotics are also
among the projects pursued at CIS.
The facility is most exceptional,
however, for its state of the art
cleaning systems that provide an
environment conducive to the re
search needs of such a sensitive
technology as VLSI research. This
high tech assembly of systems in
cludes microcontamination con
trols, toxic gas vaults and systems
for ultra-pure water and gas, ex
plained Burke.
The sensitivity of this research is
apparent when the size of circuitry
involved is considered, explained
one graduate student. The circuitry
now in use is near one micron,
about one hundredth the width of a
human hair.

and shielded from vibrations.
