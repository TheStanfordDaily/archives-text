## CIS Focuses on Cleanliness 10,500 square feet for sub-micron research 
### NIKO SCHIFF Editorial Staff 
Stanford's Center for Integrated
Systems (CIS) is a $15 million
state of the art research laboratory
and office complex designed to
bring together the talents and inter
ests of University and industrial re
searchers.
The center bridges the gap be
tween industry and the University
with its joint membership of
Ph.D.s, graduate students and in
dustry experts who all work to
gether in the building's confines.
Twenty of the largest semi
conductor manufacturers in the
United States each provided
$750,000 for the construction of the
center, said Jim Burke, facilities co
ordinator. The center was also
funded with the assistance of the
federal government, which entered
the partnership with Stanford and
the corporations.
Drawing these three groups to
gether is helping to fight the costs
of the Very Large Scale Integration
(VLSI) research done at the center,
explained Burke.
The thrust of the center's re
search is to improve ways to
store, retrieve and communicate
knowledge. The VLSI research in

volves finding ways to place a large
number of small circuits onto a com
puter chip. One of the major goals
in the VLSI research is to place
more than a million integrated ele
ments on a one square centimeter
silicon chip while developing appli
cations on systems that would
make use of such devices.
The current capabilities of VLSI
research allow for about 100,000
circuits on a single square centime
ter chip. The goal of the VLSI re
searchers is to extend this to one to
ten million circuits. The main ad
vantages of this change are
decreased costs and increased ca
pabilities per chip.
Along with the VLSI research
being conducted in the CIS labs, ad
vanced research into computer
aided design (CAD) and processing
is being pursued.
One senior scientist from each
participating company conducts re
search in conjuction with the CIS
faculty and staff, said Burke. The
participation of these senior scien
tists from the business sector helps
focus CIS research on the actual
needs of industry and keeps Stan
ford researchers up to date on in
dustry's rapidly changing needs.
"Many of these companies have

received licenses from Stanford to
use technology developed in our
laboratories," Burke added.
CIS is also affiliated with other
non-sponsor companies.
The silicon wafers that hold com
puter chips are also being improved
upon. The 2-3 inch wafers that are
currently in use are hoped to be ex
panded to an 4 inch length, ex
plained Burke.
Research into computer interface
simulation and robotics are also
among the projects pursued at CIS.
The facility is most exceptional,
however, for its state of the art
cleaning systems that provide an
environment conducive to the re
search needs of such a sensitive
technology as VLSI research. This
high tech assembly of systems in
cludes microcontamination con
trols, toxic gas vaults and systems
for ultra-pure water and gas, ex
plained Burke.
The sensitivity of this research is
apparent when the size of circuitry
involved is considered, explained
one graduate student. The circuitry
now in use is near one micron,
about one hundredth the width of a
human hair.


The Center for Integrated Studies (CIS), shown in this cutaway drawing, is completely dust free
and shielded from vibrations.
One of the aims of the CIS facility
is to achieve 0.5 micron technol
ogy. Submicron circuitry has to be
worked with in exceptionally clean
environments, however, as any
particulate on a chip could cause
serious circuit flaws.
The center of the CIS facility
contains the 10,500 square feet of
the "clean room" â€” a dust-free,
highly regulated research labora
tory where scientists are able to
conduct research into these sub
micron structures.
The clean room houses the labo
ratory and the "fast turnaround
line." The fast turnaround line will
provide VLSI chips with a short
"turnaround" time decreasing the
production time per chip. The fast
turnaround line will also serve as a

test bed for new processes and
devices.
The laboratory provides an envi
ronment for all kinds of research
into integrated circuit fabrication,
said Burke.
The main lab is structurally iso
lated from the building to eliminate
vibration, said Burke, who pointed
out the seams running around the
lab space on all floors of the CIS
building.
Not only is the "clean room"
structurally separated, but the
building is organized such that each
area represents a stratified level of
protection against vibrations or
contaminants, explained Burke.
The heavy machinery is all
outside the lab portion and toward
one side of the building, further iso
lating the lab space furthest from it.
Even the office space has a system
of microcontaminant control. The
matted rubber floor in the building's
entrance hall is designed to remove

dirt from shoes, and the carpet in
the office space is a special low
static dissipated carpet that helps
prevent changes on computer disks
that could lead to error due to
static, explained Burke.
The safety precautions are up to
date with the standard codes and in
many cases exceeding them and
setting standards a few steps far
ther.
The goal is to maintain integrity
within the system particularly in all
utilities for microcontamination,
said Burke.
"The introduction of particulate
and any form of microcontamination
in laboratory processing is of pri
mary concern due to the detrimen
tal effects upon the quality and yield
of advanced sub-micron devices.
Therefore, specification and selec
tion of architectual and interior
components were of major impor
tance," said Burke.

The "clean room" is segregated
into sepai ate research areas by me
chanical chases known as
"fingerwalls." The fingerwallks
separate each area in the lab and
contain service areas for the distri
bution and future connection points
of the main utilities for future lab
equipment, said Burke.
The entire CIS facility is set up to
accommodate further expansion
and research, explained Burke.
There is a large moving area for
removing large outmoded equip
ment from the ground floor of the
building. There is also a wall built
with the intention of removal for an
annex to be built later.
The laboratory ceiling is an im
pressive engineering accomplish
ment with its Highly Efficient Par
ticulate Air (HEPA) filtration units
which provide a clean air flow that
meets and exceeds standard codes,
said Burke.
