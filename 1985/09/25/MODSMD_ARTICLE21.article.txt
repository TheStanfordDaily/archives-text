# THE 						ASSU NEWS DEBUTS
## Headline rhymes, Lexiconists Say 
### 
Hi. Welcome to the ASSU News. This is our page.
We bought it. Cost a pretty penny, too. But it's ours,
every other week. And we can do anything we want on
it. Watch — rat's ass. See? Wow.
Veah, we could write rat's ass again and again and
again. And again. But we're not going to. Because we
have more important things to do. Because we're the
ASSU. We're going to introduce you to our wonderful
and frightening world. Shhhh. Be very, very quiet.
Follow me.

BE A C.O.P. GROUPIE
The C.O.P. gets to hire two interns. What do C.O.P. interns do? Hell, we
don't know. But we'll think of something. Something.. . exciting. Anyhow, they
get $ 190 a month. Stop by the C.O.P. office and pick up an application by
September 3()th. Or don't.
EDIT THIS
Ever watch Johnny Carson's monologues and think. "I can write better
jokes than that?" Me neither. But that doesn't matter. You can still become the
editor of the ASSU News. Sort of like a small Tim Greive.
If you can read, write, and figure out what to do with big, empty white
spaces at the bottom of the page, you can do the job.
Yeah, there's a salary.
WANNA BE ON A COMMITTEE?
A committee to develop the program for new single graduate student
housing needs members, especially single graduate students. Most of the
committee's work will be done this quarter, but it will continue to meet through
winter, spring, and beyond(l). Apply to the Nominations Committee in the
ASSU offices.
WANTED: A Senate Text Manager
"Text?" you ask innocently. "You mean the Senate is putting out too many
papers & documents?"
Yep. Reams of'em. Cartons of cryptic jargon.
But we won't ask you to do too much of it. An ancient, deeply-buried
yearning calls us to our paperwork and fulfillment of our destinies. We just need
some help sometimes.
You get: $ 190.00/ month.
A spot in our scenic office overlooking the pay lot.
You have to: Help out 7-8 hours/week.
Type about 60 wpm.
Put up with Carey & Ed.
If nothing else, think of the opportunities for embezzlement. Contact Carey
in the Senate office, 497-4331.

Banned in Britain: The new ASSL pamphlet might well have
