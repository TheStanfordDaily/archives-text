# ANYONE WANT A MILLION DOLLARS?
## 
### 
It's like this. The ASSU has a million
dollars and no imagination! So any registered
student group that has a good idea t and needs a
million dollars, should apply for money from
the ASSU. All you have to do is fill out a couple
hundred forms and answer some intimate
questions.
Student publications apply to the Pub
Board; all other groups go to the Program
Board. Applications can be picked up at the
ASSU Business Office. If you have any
questions, see Brett Monello, Pub Board
director, or Eugene Chen, Program Board
director. They both hold office hours in the
ASSU offices in Tresidder Union, but 1 don't
know where they are yet.
Deadlines for fall applications are
Tuesday, October 8, and Tuesday, November
5, by 4:00 pm. Don't be late. The Senate
decides on Board recommendations on
Tuesday, October 22, and Tuesday, November
19. If your group needs a million dollars for
events happening before October 22, notify the
Board director a week before the event and
apply by October 8.
Long-term funding for 1986-7 is decided
winter quarter. The deadline for applying is
January 24, 1986, but don't worry, there will be
plenty of publicity about it before then. Good
luck.
