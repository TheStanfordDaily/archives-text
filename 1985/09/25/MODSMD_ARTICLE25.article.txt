# Student Invents 'Ultrafast' Photodetector
## 
### PAT LIN Editorial staff 
Adnah Kostenbauder, a doctoral
candidate in electrical engineering,
has invented an ultrafast
photodetector, which may one day
find wide application in fiber optics
communications. For his invention,
he was recently awarded a New
port Research Award by Newport
Corp. and the Optical Society of
America.
The award provides $8,000 in
fellowship support plus an additional
$4,000 for equipment. Five winners
are selected each year for the
prize.
The applications of ultrafast
photodetectors are primarily in the
transmission of iarge quantities of
information. "People have been in
terested in sending data at very
high rates, especially with fiber op
tics and perhaps also with
satellites," said Anthony Siegman,
professor of electrical engineering
and Kostenbauder's adviser.
In order to use light to send large
amounts of data at high speed, one
needs very short light pulses and
therefore very fast photodetectors,
according to Siegman.
The quantity of information that
can be transmitted with light is
theoretically very great because
light has a very wide bandwidth of
frequencies. A good stereo, Sieg

man explained, might have a
bandwidth of between 20 and
20,000 cycles per second and this
contains sufficient information to
reproduce sound with high fidelity.
A TV channel would transmit more
information and might use a
bandwidth of six megahertz or six
million cycles per second.
Light, in theory, has a bandwidth
that is at least many million times
that of a TV channel, and therefore
ought to be able to transmit
tremendously large volumes of in
formation. According to Siegman,
light may have the potential for
sending ten million bits of informa
tion in a second.
However, in order to realize the
potential of light pulses, certain
technical problems must be
overcome. Specifically, one must
find a way to generate very rapid
pulses and to receive them.
Kostenbauder's device, along
with currently available ultrafast
photodetectors, addresses the lat
ter problem. At present, there are
two types of ultrafast photodetec
tors. One type employs radiation
damaged crystals or amorphous
materials while the other type uses
a very small diode in a large electric
field, said Kostenbauder.
According to Siegman, there are
fundamental limits to the ability of
existing photodetectors to measure
the intensity of light with fine time
resolution. He said that the

available photodetectors are "either
very small or very inefficient."
Kostenbauder's device, in com
parison, is not hampered by these
limitations because it employs a
novel idea. Because of the different
approach, Kostenbauder's
photodetector has the potential for
being much faster than existing
devices.
The design of the photodetector
was "strictly Adnah's idea," Sieg
man said. One day, out of the
blue, Kostenbauder "came up
with the unusual concept of using
very fast diffusion of electrons" to
drive the photodetector.
"Usually, one thinks of diffusion
as a slow process," said Siegman.
Common examples are a drop of ink
spreading out slowly in a glass of
water or a bit of perfume slowly dif
fusing throughout a room.
The diffusion in Kostenbauder's
device is different than the kinds of
diffusion most people are familiar
with. The instrument uses a semi
conductor which generates
"electron-hole pairs" when struck
by light. In other words, electrons
in the semi-conductor are excited
by light to higher energy levels, and
a "hole" is left in the lower energy
level. The high-energy electrons
then diffuse away very quickly
toward a diode and create a current
that can be detected.
