## Texas Tackle Eyes 'Horns 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
When Stanford's offense takes the field for Satur
day's nationally televised game against the Univer
sity of Texas, Longhorn fans will probably take
more than a passing glance at the Cardinal's right
tackle, senior John Barns.
For one thing, he's awfully hard to miss — at 6-
foot-7, 285 pounds, Barns is Stanford's largest
player. When the linemen get into their stances, big
No. 74 looks like a bookend sticking up in the air,
holding the rest of the line steady.
But the 10,0(X) Texas backers expected for Sat
urday's game and the thousands more watching on
television have another reason to be interested in
Barns, or J. 8., as he is known by teammates. Big
John Barns was born and bred in Dallas, where he
earned state-wide recognition as an offensive
lineman at Highland Park High School. He attracted
the serious attention of nearly every school in the
state of Texas.
Barns, like Cardinal kicker David Sweeney
(Dallas) and defensive back Chris Young (Wharton),
is a prodigal son. Without a doubt, the Texans who
pleaded with J.B. to stay at home will be keeping
their eyes upon him when he lines up against the
'Horns.
And for J. 8., that's no big deal. "I'm approaching
this as just another game," he said after practice
yesterday afternoon. "Or just another big game,

really. This would be a huge win for us if we win."
Barns has no real problem with a conflict of inter
est against the Longhorns. lie was never much of a
Texas fan to begin with.
"Being in Dallas, 1 was always an SMU fan and a
Cowboys fan," he said. "I lived within walking dis
tance of the SMU fields, and I used to go down and
watch them practice all the time when 1 was a
kid. ... 1 like to see Texas do well in the rankings,
but I'm not reallv a fan."

A few years back, however, Texas was a fan of
Barns. After leading Highland Park to the state
semi-finals and a 13-1 record in his senior year,
Barns was voted an All-American by the National
Coaches Association and Parade Magazine, and he
was named the Most Valuable Offensive Lineman in
Texas.
And for months, his phone rang off the hook. J.B.
got the all-but-complete Southwestern Conference

recruiting treatment —• everything but the car.
"I was exposed to some heavy recruiting." he ad
mitted. "But they only offer things to the guys they
think will accept. 1 didn't get any of those kinds of of
fers, but I've heard a lot of stories."
Barns seriously considered Southern Methodist
and Baylor before deciding on Stanford. "It wasn't
negative things about those schools. It was all the
positive aspects of Stanford," he said. "Stanford just
has so much more to offer me academically. "
And Barns has offered the Cardinal a lot athleti
cally. He has been a starter at right tackle since the
third game of the 1983 season, a string of 22 con
secutive games. He is the sell-described "old man"
on a line that lost four starters to graduation last
year, and is now manned by athletes with very little
playing time under their belts.
"1 guess they look to me for a little experience, "
he said. "But we all work together real well. We've
been pretty dominating on the line so far."
The television exposure in Saturday's game will
be a motivating factor for Barns, but not because of
the possibility that pro scouts will be watching.
"I hadn't even thought of that," he said. "It's
more important to me that the bowl people are
seeing us."
Card notes
The kickoff time for Saturday's game has been
moved up nine minutes, to 12:41 p.m. in order to
accomodate CBS-TV. Whatever you say, guys. The
broadcast will be handled by Brent Musberger and
Ara Parseghian.
