# Card Clobbers Hapless Bears In Three Sets
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Editorial Staff 
It's an old coach's cliche that no
opponent should be taken lightly.
Like many cliches, this one isn't
quite right.
Stanford's women's volleyball
team took California lightly last
night in Berkeley and still came
home a winner. So much for
cliches. The Cardinal out-classed
the Golden Bears 15-10, 16-14, 15-
9.
Afterward, Cardinal Co-coach
Don Shaw, whose team now sports
an 8-0 overall mark and is ranked
second in the nation, must have felt
like a bully who had just punched a
kid wearing glasses — rotten.
And so, he was charitable in his
post-game assessment: "They're
not quite ready yet," he said.
"They're in the middle of rebuilding
a program that was in shambles."
Co-coaches Shaw and Fred Stum
were so confident going into last
night's game that they shuffled the
Cardinal lineup. For the first time in
her two-year Stanford career,
junior outside hitter Brooke Hahner
found her name on the lineup card.
She replaced seven-game starter
Amy Hayes.
"We tried to make a little
change," Shaw said about the
Hahner-Hayes switch. "We hadn't
been playing really well, so we
thought an adjustment might shake
things up. The two (Hahner and
Hayes) will probably alternate."
Fair enough.

But the Stanford braintrust, ever
sure of certain victory, went fur
ther. They dared — say it isn't so
— to think about resting senior Kim
Oden, who has been nursing a leg
injury. "We were thinking of sitting
Oden out of this one," Shaw said.
Rest Kim Oden? The three-time
First-Team All-American and last
year's College Player of the Year?
The same player who, in Shaw's
words, "has done just about every
thing there is to be done on the vol
leyball court?"
Yes, Shaw thought about resting
the same Kim Oden. Now, how
seriously could Stanford have taken
host California? Probably not very.
As it turned out, Oden did play,
and she even started. What's more,
she contributed mightily to Stan
ford's Cakewalk. She recorded 15
kills and 5 blocks for the night.
"We played well enough to win ...
very well in spots," Shaw said. "We
let them get some runs on us, espe
cially in the second set when they
overcame our 9-7 lead with a run of
five, but we were pretty much in
control throughout.
"There really isn't very much to
say. Nothing really stood out."
With the tough part of his team's
schedule still to come, it is likely
that Shaw won't have the luxury of
changing lineups and resting Oden.
Friday night's contest against No. 3
Texas promises to challenge No. 2
Stanford.
"We're going to have our hands
full with that one," Shaw said.
