# Drug Tests for '86?
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) â€” Baseball Commissioner
Peter Ueberroth yesterday asked major league
players to voluntarily submit to drug testing. The
players' union responded that the action may be un
lawful and indicated it would tell players to ignore
the request.
At a news conference, Ueberroth said he had
designated a representative from each club's man
agement to deliver letters to every major league
player. The letters ask players to submit to
urinalyses three times a year beginning in 1986.
Ueberroth said he had asked for responses to the
letters by Friday.
At the same time, Ueberroth said he had decided
to postpone any punitive action against seven
players who testified in the federal drug trial in
Pittsburgh of Philadelphia caterer Curtis Strong.
"Baseball is on trial," Ueberroth said, "and it has
suffered public humiliation in the last few weeks, not
to anybody's surprise, least of all to mine. I've
wrestled with what to do as commissioner."
Ueberroth said the program would be similar to
one already being used to test minor leaguers and
non-playing major league personnel. Tests would be
done without notice, but would always be conducted
in the player's clubhouse. They would be conducted

by medical people, and he said there would be no
punitive steps taken against players who tested
positively,
"Anyone with a positive test would receive im
mediate, continued testing and treatment," the
commissioner said. "He would get counseling and
help appropriate to the individual."
He said baseball's winter leagues, with the excep
tion of Venezuela, have joined the program.
Venezuela was excluded because "they have severe
penalties, and we will have no penalties," (Jeberroth
said.
Don Fehr criticizes plea
The acting executive director of the players
union, Don Fehr, called Ueberroth's action "a plain,
old-fashioned attempt not to bargain ... but to
bypass the union."
The early indication was that players were favor
ing Ueberroth's proposal, with a hitch. The New
York Mets voted unanimously in favor of the plan,
subject to details being worked out with the Major
League Players Association.
