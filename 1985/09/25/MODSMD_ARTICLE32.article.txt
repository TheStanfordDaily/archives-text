EL SEGUNDO (AP) — Quarterback Jim
Plunkett of the Los Angeles Haiders will undergo
arthroscopic surgery on his left shoulder, ac
cording to a spokesman for the National Football
League team.
The spokesman said yesterday that the sur
gery would be performed by Dr. Robert Rosen
feld last night or early this morning at Cedars-
Sinai Medical Center. He added that the
timetable for Plunkett remains the same — the
37-year-old quarterback will be sidelined for at
least six weeks.
The right-handed Plunkett, in his 15th NFL
season, suffered a dislocation of his left shoulder
early in the fourth quarter of the Raiders' game
against the San Francisco 49ers Sunday.
Plunkett was injured when sacked by 275-
pound San Francisco defensive lineman Jeff
Stover. The 49ers, who led 27-3 at the time

Plunkett was injured, wound up winning 34-10.
The Raiders placed Plunkett on their injured
reserve list Monday. Taking his place on the
club's roster will be rookie running back Steve
Strachan, who was re-signed and will be used on
special teams.
Strachan, an llth-round draft choice from
Boston College, was cut after the Raiders' third
preseason game last month. Strachan, 22,
gained 41 yards on 12 carries in three preseason
games.
"We needed to get somebody who can help us,
even if it's only on special teams," said Coach
Tom Flores of the Raiders.
Rosenfeld, the Raiders' orthopedic surgeon,
had Plunkett hospitalized immediately following
the injury and scheduled an arthrogram and
other tests to further determine the extent of
the separation and possible ligament damage.
Th#» separation occurred in Plunkett's non

throwing shoulder, but he had previously suf
fered three separations and a torn rotator cuff in
the shoulder.
"It's literally wired down so well that the ball
and-socket were the only things that could go,"
Plunkett said from his hospital bed at Cedars-
Sinai Medical Center.
Ironically, Plunkett was off to one of his best
starts in recent seasons. Through three games,
he had completed nearly 70 percent of his passes
(71 of 103) for 803 yards, with three touchdowns
and three interceptions. His passing efficiency
rating of 89.6 was among the NFL leaders.
Marc Wilson will start in Plunkett's place Sun
day when the Raiders, who are 1-2, travel to
face the New England Patriots, who are 2-1.
Rookie Rusty Hilger, a sixth-round draft choice
from Oklahoma State, will serve as Wilson's
backup.
