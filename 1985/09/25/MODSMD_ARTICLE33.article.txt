# Tigers Foil Niekro's Bid
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) â€” The
frustration for Phil Niekro and the
New York Yankees continues.
Last night, the Detroit Tigers
routed Niekro and the Yankees 9-1
and once again denied him his 300 th
career victory.
And after the Tigers had finished
pounding Niekro, the 46-year-old
knuckleballer apparently decided to
do some pounding of his own.
Niekro, one of the most mild
mannered players in baseball,
slammed a bat into a metal pay tele
phone on the way to the Yankees'
locker room, smashing the bat and
putting a severe dent in the call
box.

It was about all Niekro could do
after failing for the third time to win
his 300 th game.
"What I probably feel the worst
about is all of the people who have
been coming to see me," he said
following the game after quiet dis
appointment had replaced his
anger.
"All of the miles, the airline tick
ets and the hotels, that's what I feel
bad about."
Niekro admitted that not as many
people had made the trip to watch
last night's attempt as had seen his
two earlier losing efforts.
In those losses in Detroit and to
Toronto at home, Niekro had

pitched complete games. This time,
it wasn't so pretty.
After pitching a 1-2-3 first inning,
Niekro gave up a three-run homer
to John Grubb in the second inning.
As Grubb circled the bases, Niekro
walked toward the plate, picked up
Grubb's bat and threw it toward the
Detroit dugout on the third-base
side.
"I can sympathize with him,"
Grubb said. "I know he wants to
win it."
In the third inning, Grubb hit a
two-run double that capped another
three-run outburst.
A two-run homer by Lance Par
rish knocked out Niekro with no
outs in the fifth.

"I basically stunk the pitcher's
mound up," he said. "It was a ter
rible exhibition of pitching."
Niekro's next start is scheduled
to come Sunday at Yankee Stadium
against Baltimore.
Meanwhile, the other pitcher
who started for a New York team
last night, left-hander Sid Fernan
dez, hurled a two-hitter as the Mets
beat the Philadelphia Phillies 7-1
last night and held their ground
against the frontrunning St. Louis
Cardinals in the National League
East.
The Mets remained three games
back of the Cardinals, who beat Pit
tsburgh 5-4 last night.
