France Assails Press Leaks
PARIS — The French government, which has conceded that its
agents, acting under orders, had blown up the Greenpeace protest
ship, yesterday brought its first charges in the case. In an apparent
attempt to put a stop to damaging newspaper revelations about the
affair, the Defense Ministry charged three army men with leaking se
cret information about the episode to the press.
The government of President Francois Mitterrand, which has
been rocked by the Greenpeace scandal and apparent cover-up, has
thus far not brought charges against anyone involved in ordering or
carrying out the attack which sunk the vessel and killed a photogra
pher.
Justice officials said that the three military men, who include two
members of the secret services, were placed under house arrest.
They are accused of jeopardizing national security by revealing infor
mation about the sinking of the vessel, the Rainbow Warrior, by
French agents in New Zealand's territorial waters July 10.
The attempt to plug the leaks underlined the important role played
by the French press in revealing how the Rainbow Warrior was
sabotaged by the French secret services which then attempted to
cover up the operation. After rejecting allegations of French involve
ment for two months, the government conceded Sunday that the
Greenpeace ship had been sunk by French agents acting under or
ders. The ship was preparing to sail to Mururoa Atoll in the South
Pacific to protest French nuclear tests there.
Epidemics Unlikely in Mexico
MEXICO CITY — Mexican and international health experts said
yesterday that the risk of major epidemic diseases arising from last
week's earthquake was low.
They did say, however, that there was a great risk of increased
gastrointestinal illnesses because of bad water, spoiled food and lack
of sanitation facilities following the quake.
Doctors said that it was unlikely anyone would contract tetanus or
typhoid, even if they came into direct contact with the decomposing
bodies.
Noting a recent five-inch headline in a local newspaper that read
"Peste," or pestilence, Luis Zeballos, a doctor with the Pan Ameri
can Health Organization, said, "Inevitably after an earthquake there
are rumors of an outbreak of epidemics. It is natural anxiety. . . .
But in a situation like this of tension, collective psychosis and col
lective pain, you are playing with the mental health of the public."
The municipality has reported at least 4,160 confirmed dead in the
earthquake that registered 7.8 on the Richter scale and an after
shock 36 hours later that registered 7.3. Police have estimated that
at least 1,000 more may still be buried in the hundreds of collapsed
buildings. Authorities have been anxious to clear away the debris to
reduce risk of infection.
China Ends Leadership Change
PEKING — The Chinese Communist Party completed its leader
ship reshuffle yesterday by approving a 22-member Politburo that in
cludes six new members — all of them supporters of China's top
leader, Deng Xiaoping, and none of them military officers.
The Politburo appointments were announced after a brief meeting
of 330 full and alternate members of the party's new Central Com
mittee. They are the final step in a series of actions in which Deng
has replaced aging revolutionaries with younger administrators and
technocrats at the highest levels of the Communist Party.
The effect has been to leave the People's Liberation Army,
China's fighting force of more than 3 million soldiers, with less influ
ence over Communist Party affairs in China than at any other time
since the Communist takeover in 1949. Deng has been seeking for
years to create a professional army divorced from politics.
The new Politburo appointees include the two men whom Deng
and his top aides, Communist Party General Secretary Hu Yaobang
and Premier Zhao Ziyang, hope will take over China's highest
ranking leadership posts within two or three years.
One of them is Hu Qili, 56, the urbane permanent secretary of the
party secretariat and protege of Hu Yaobang (who is no relation).
The other is Li Peng, 57, the adopted son of the late Premier Chou
En-lai and a Soviet-trained engineer and energy specialist.
Study Questions Star Wars
WASHINGTON — President Reagan's vision of an effective shield
against a Soviet nuclear attack "does not appear feasible" without
cooperation from the Russians, including agreed reductions in offen
sive nuclear weapons, according to a study released yesterday by
the congressional Office of Technology Assessment (OTA).
"Assured survival of the U.S. population appears impossible to
achieve if the Soviets are determined to deny it to us," the OTA
said, because of inherent advantages that offense would have over
defense in a nuclear war.
The detailed study, which was done by OTA's staff aided by an ad
visory panel of supporters and opponents of the president's Strategic
Defense Initiative research program, warned that without a
negotiated agreement on the introduction of new defensive systems,
the two superpowers "might easily suspect the other of attempting
to gain a military advantage" and institute a new arms race in both of
fensive and defensive weapons.
The Soviet Union has thus far expressed adamant opposition to
the idea of a negotiated agreement to introduce new defensive sys
tems. although, according to the Reagan Administration, it is also
conducting active research on defensive technologies.
U.S. security would increase, the study said, if it proves feasible
to build a defensive system that would protect population centers
and American missile fields but only if an agreement with the Soviets
could be reached to coordinate weapons reductions and the introduc
tion of defensive systems. However, the study notes, "no one has as
yet specified in any detail just how such an arms-control agreement
could be formulated."
The study noted "the inherent paradox" that the Administration
plans to continue development of SDI even without Moscow's
cooperation, while at the same time recognizing that an agreement
with the Soviets would be necessary if the long-term SDI goal is to
be met.
I he study takes issue with some past beliefs of both supporters
and opponents of the Administration programs. For example, the
study maintains that current Soviet ballistic missile-defense technol
ogy probably does not exceed our own," but adds that because
there is an ABM site around Moscow, the Soviets "are almost cer
tainly better equipped in the near term to deploy a large-scale
'traditional' (landbased ABM) system than we are."
I*he OTA panel was made up of defense specialists as diverse as
Reagan Administration consultant Colin Gray and former Defense
Secretary Robert McNamara.
