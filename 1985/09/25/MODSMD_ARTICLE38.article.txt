# Soviet Attacks Star Wars Plan
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS — Soviet Foreign Mini
ster Eduard Shevardnadze charged yesterday
that the American "Star Wars" program is an ill
advised attempt "to gain military superiority in
the nuclear age" and proposed a "Star Peace"
concept of international space cooperation as an
alternative.
Shevardnadze, addressing the U.N. General
Assembly, said Moscow is "convinced" that the
Nov. 19-20 U.S.-Soviet summit meeting should
focus on the central issues of nuclear arms con
trol, including the space-arms issue where the
two nations seem to be at loggerheads.
The Soviet diplomat's spokesman, Vladimir
Lomeiko, declined to confirm reports that
Shevardnadve is bringing to the Reagan Adminis
tration new Soviet proposals for large-scale
offensive-weapons reductions, conditional on
U.S. restrictions on its Strategic Defense Initia
tive (SDI) program, popularly known as Star
Wars.
Shevardnadze said in his speech that "the So
viet delegation has brought to the current round
of the (Geneva) negotiations substantial, large
scale and far-reaching proposals," but he did not
say whether they had yet been presented.
Pesident Reagan, speaking in Knoxville,
Tenn., said, "We've received no offer either
here or ... in Geneva." A State Department
spokesman called Shevardnadze's remarks "an

indication" the Soviets will bring new proposals
to Geneva but said none had been received.
Shevardnadze's statement, his heavy empha
sis on the dangers of an "arms race in outer
space" and his enthusiastic references to Soviet
arms-control initiatives did nothing to dampen
the widespread speculation.
Shevardnadze is to meet here today with Sec
retary of State George Shultz, who sat in the
General Assembly chamber taking copious notes
while his counterpart spoke. The Soviet is to
meet Reagan at the White House Friday.
Shevardnadze, however, did not show up for
Shultz' address here Monday, an omission that
the Soviet official's spokesman attributed yester
day to "personal circumstances" that he did not
explain.
Like Shultz' address Monday, Shevardnadze
had little good to say yesterday about the other
nuclear superpower except for a single para
graph expressing the desire for progress at the
Geneva meeting of Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev.
Shevardnadze, who succeeded the veteran
Andrei Gromyko in July, absolved his country
from responsibility for the arms race, the Cold
War and Third World conflicts, and blamed the
United States and its allies for "the current criti
cal state of international relations."

His greatest emphasis was in the outer space
area, and here Shevardnadze and his aides dis
played the public-relations consciousness that
has become increasingly prominent in Soviet
diplomacy.
The catchy "Star Peace" slogan was attached
to proposals Shevardnadze sent to the United
Nations on Aug. 18, with little public notice.
The plan involves renunciation of the
militarization of space, including research to that
end, creation of a "world space organization" to
explore the heavens on behalf of mankind and an
"international space conference" to plan
cooperation among nations with space-research
capability.
Shevardnadze devoted much time in his ad
dress to what he called "the sinister plans of Star
Wars" and the basis for Soviet opposition.
Describing the current strategic situation in
volving the threat of mutual annihilation as
"strategic equilibrium," he said a space-based
anti-missile shield was destabilizing and could
provide its possessor with the ability to deliver a
"first disarming nuclear strike."
Yet this is precisely the thrust of the new U.S.
military programs, already under way or about to
be launched, he charged. He said that "our
country will not permit military superiority over
itself."
