# Retail Prices Rise Only 0.2 Percent

### 
WASHINGTON — Retail prices
rose only 0.2 percent in August for
the fourth consecutive month, a
pace that could keep the year's in
flation rate well below 4 percent,
the government announced yester
day.
Inflation continued to be held in
check by lower food and energy
prices, only in part offset by higher
prices for housing and medical care,
the Department of Labor said in its
monthly report on consumer
prices. So far in 1985, inflation has
run at an annual rate of 3.3 percent

— which, if sustained, would mark
the lowest such increase since
1967.
At the same time, the Depart
ment of Commerce offered another
piece of evidence that the economy
began a modest pickup during the
summer when it reported that a
surge in big-ticket defense orders
pushed durable goods orders ahead
by a healthy 3.4 percent last month.
Last week it forecast third-quarter
growth at a 2.8 percent annual rate,
an unspectacular pace but an im
provement over the glacial growth

recorded earlier this year.
Economists reviewing the day's
reports were particularly encour
aged by the lengthening record of
low inflation, saying that for many
months no economic fundamental
has changed that would reignite in
flationary expectations.
Since 1980, the soaring dollar has
been a key factor in taming what
had become endemic inflation. But
economists seem to agree that a
weaker dollar will be felt only
gradually in the prices of imports —
and, therefore, later on in the

prices of U.S.-made goods.
Meanwhile, economists also said
they felt the 3.4 percent increase in
durable goods last month was the
minimum needed to keep the eco
nomy moving on its modest growth
track. But without the huge 12.5
percent leap in the defense compo
nent, the Department of Com
merce noted, the rise would have
been a far more modest 2.5 per
cent.
Much of the remaining increase
was fueled by a big jump in trans
portation equipment.
