# Kennedy Raps Research Plan
## Rule Could Force Classified Study 
### 
University President Donald
Kennedy yesterday branded a De
partment of Energy (DOE) move to
classify university work as
"outlandish."
If a new government proposal is
approved, DOE contractors like the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
could be required to accept classi
fied work, which would violate the
University's long-standing policy
that prohibits secret research at
Stanford.
Kennedy said the proposal, of
fered in the Federal Register as a
"clarification" of exisiting rules, is
actually a "fundamental policy
change of the greatest impor
tance."
The proposed guidelines would
require DOE contractors to accept
"any work assignments which fall
within the general scope of the con
tract for work of a national defense
nature, whether such work is clas
sified or unclassified."
Kennedy said that such a change
should be "thoroughly debated at
the highest levels, both within DOE
and the scientific community."
Kennedy complained that the
guidelines would violate Stanford's
policy against classified research.
Kennedy said other DOE contrac
tors have similar research policies.
"Stanford University's policies,
like those of several other academic
operating and management contrac

tors of the DOE, specifically
prohibit the conduct of classified re
search at the University," he said.
"The DOE ought not, with the
mere stroke of the pen, attempt to
negate fundamental academic
policies dealing with openness in re
search," Kennedy said.
"Such a requirement would
prevent universities such as Stan
ford, whose linear accelerator cen
ter is one of the leading high-energy
physics laboratories of the world,
from continuing to contribute to this
nation's scientific leadership," he
said, adding that such a policy
would not be in the national inter
est.
Requiring contractors to accept
any work deemed by DOE "to fall
within the genera! scope of the con
tract" is "an unwarranted intrusion
into the scientific process," he said.
"Attempts by DOE to dictate
specific work assignments without
the prior agreement of the par
ticipating scientists infringes re
searchers' academic freedom and is
bound to be unproductive."
The 30-day comment period for
the proposal expires today. Ken
nedy called the length of the com
ment period "wholly inadequate."
His views were expressed in a
letter to Pamela Boiling of the DOE
Procurement Policy Branch in
Washington, D.C.
