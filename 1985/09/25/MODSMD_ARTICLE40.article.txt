Marriott Buys HoJo
Howard Johnson Co., the struggling hotel
and restaurant chain known for its orange roof
tops and ice cream parlors, was acquired yes
terday by Marriott Corp. and Prime Motor
Inns in a two-step deal for $314 million cash.
Marriott bought the Quincy, Mass.-based
Howard Johnson from its British owner, Im
perial Group of London, but then simultane
ously agreed to sell a substantial portion of the
company for $235 million to Prime Motor Inns,
a major Howard Johnson licensee in Fairfield,
N.J. The acquisition catapults Prime Motor
Inns from a chain of 63 motels into one of the
nation's largest lodging companies.
At one point as many as four companies
were bidding for the 60-year-old Howard
Johnson chain, industry analysts said. Bet
hesda, Md.-based Marriott, considered the
most likely purchaser, had pulled out of
negotiations with Imperial Group in June, only
to return during the summer with a winning
bid.
Superfund Work Done
WASHINGTON — The Senate completed
work yesterday on a bill that would expand
funding of the federal government's Superfund
hazardous waste cleanup program to $7.5 bil
lion — a fivefold increase — and key senators
predicted easy passage when a final vote on
the measure is taken tomorrow.
A final vote on the bill, which envisions a
five-year extension of the Superfund program,
had been expected yesterday but was delayed
because the Senate, which lacks the constitu

tional authority to initiate tax measures, must
go through the procedural hurdle of finding a
House-passed tax bill on which to attach the
bin.
Sen. Robert Stafford (R-Vt.), the measure's
sponsor, predicted a "substantial majority" of
the Senate would back the bill tomorrow. A
crucial test of support came last week, when
79 senators voted against an amendment that
would have reduced the funding of the five
year-old program to $5.7 billion.
Crash Cause Sought
WASHINGTON — Federal aviation officials
said yesterday that faulty ground equipment
was probably not responsible for the crash of a
Henson Airlines commuter flight Monday that
killed 14 persons and said they are investigat
ing whether mechanical failure or pilot error
caused the accident.
"He could have crashed while making the
approach or by turning the wrong way on an
aborted attempt at landing," said Brad Dunbar,
a spokesman for the National Transportation
Safety Board. "So far, we have no evidence of
engine failure."
Stocks Tumble
NEW YORK — Stock prices abandoned
their brief rally and tumbled over a wide front
in sluggish trading yesterday.
Blue-chip and technology issues, which
paced the market's strong advance in the pre
vious session, were among those hardest hit.
Still, the Dow Jones average of 30 in
dustrials managed a 4.81-point gain to

1,321.12, thanks to a spectacular rise by one
of its components, General Foods.
Tax Plan Interest Sags
ATHENS, Tenn. — President Reagan tried
again yesterday to revive lagging public inter
est in his tax overhaul proposal, but a new
Washington Post-ABC News poll indicates the
president's efforts so far have not been suc
cessful.
And in part reflecting the lack of public pres
sure for overhaul of the tax code, Senate
Republicans, meeting in a closed caucus, voted
overwhelmingly against attempting to pass tax
revision this year if it means remaining in ses
sion through December to do so.
But the Democratic House is continuing its
efforts on the package, where passage this
year is still predicted. The Ways and Means
Committee is scheduled to begin substantive
work on the plan tomorrow although the com
mittee staff is having difficulty producing
promised alternatives to Reagan's proposal.
In Tennessee, on one of a series of tax revi
sion promotion trips Reagan has given since
Labor Day, the president warned that the eco
nomy is likely to turn sour unless the tax pro
posal is approved.
"Tax reform is a drama with heroes and vil
lains and a damsel in distress," Reagan said to
a flag-waving crowd of several thousand in the
county courthouse square here. "The heroes
are the citizens across this country who are
asking for tax justice. The villains are the spe
cial interest — the 'I got mine' gang. And the
damsel in distress? A lass named Endless Eco
nomic Growth, who's tied to the tracks and
struggling to break free."
