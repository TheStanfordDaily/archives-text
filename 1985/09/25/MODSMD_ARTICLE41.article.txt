Calif. Quake Expected
LOS ANGELES — The earthquakes that
ravaged Mexico City last week reinforce the
belief that Southern California will be struck by
a catastrophic, great quake within 20 to 50
years, geologists said yesterday.
California's 1983 earthquake response plan
said a great quake on the southern San
Andreas Fault "is a virtual certainty within the
next 30 years" and could kill 30,000 people,
seriously injure up to 100,000 others and
cause up to $15 billion in property damage.
More recently, geologists have said such a
quake, measuring 8 or more on the Richter
scale, is almost certain along the southern San
Andreas within 20 to 50 years, or that the
chance of such a temblor is anywhere from 5
percent down to 2 percent in any single year.

Defense Rests in Trial
SAN DIEGO — The defense in Mayor
Roger Hedgecock's retrial on conspiracy and
perjury charges rested yesterday without call
ing a single witness, a move that shocked the
crowded courtroom.
The surprise move by defense lawyer Oscar
Goodman came about 15 minutes after Deputy
District Attorney Charles Wickersham rested
the prosecution's case. The state called 62
witnesses during 18 days of testimony.
Sex Suspect on Trial
REDWOOD CITY — A lumber mill
worker accused of imprisoning a hitchhiker in a
wooden box and using her as a sex slave for

seven years went on trial yesterday with the
victim and his wife ready to testify against him.
A jury was being chosen to decide whether
Cameron Hooker, 31, is guilty of 17 felonies
including kidnap, torture, sodomy and rape.
He is accused of kidnapping the woman,
then 20, at knifepoint and forcing her to sleep
in a homemade box and take part in bizarre sex
acts.
Video to Aid Search
SAN FRANCISCO — The likenesses of
missing children began flashing on video
screens in California hotels, airports, train sta
tions and shopping malls yesterday as part of
the corporate effort to return the children to
their parents.
