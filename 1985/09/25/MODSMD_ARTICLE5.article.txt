# Ham Operators Aid in Earthquake

### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial Staff 
When a killer earthquake knocked out
telephone lines in Mexico City last week,
members of the Stanford Ham Radio
Club sprung into action, relaying infor
mation to 17 Stanford students and com
munity members concerned for the
safety of their friends and family in the
stricken region.
On Thursday, when the first of two
major quakes struck, visiting Prof.

Henry Makler, a member of the club,
began using his amateur radio to contact
Mexican authorities to determine the
well-being of one of his friends.
Soon, other club members realized
that they could use their radios to help
other community members get word
about their friends and relatives in
Mexico City and the other smaller cities
heavily damaged in the two quakes.
Although their efforts were hampered
Friday by heavy radio traffic and poor at
mospheric conditions, the club members
eventually were able to tell six Stanford

students that their families had survived
the disaster.
The procedure to contact relatives
was complicated. First, club members
obtained a list of Mexican students from
the Bechtel International Center. The
club members then called Mexican
operators, who were in turn able to
make local calls to determine the safety
of those people in question. The
Mexican operators then called the Stan
ford operators to tell them the good
news.
Once they confirmed the well-being of

all Stanford relatives, the club members
had hoped to make similar contacts for
the local Red Cross chapter and area
residents. However, transmitting condi
tions were unfavorable, and the effort
had to be postponed, according to Mak
ler.
Makler said that a shortage of radio
operators has limited the club's opera
tions, but added that it may still serve
the Red Cross.
