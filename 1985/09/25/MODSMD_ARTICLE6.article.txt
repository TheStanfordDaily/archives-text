# Stanford's Women in Playboy Speak Up
## 
### JOHN LIS Senior staff writer 
When Playboy photographer
David Chan visited Stanford in April
to shoot "Girls of the Pac-10," he
didn't find hordes of women waiting
to be pictured in his publication.
What Chan found were large
numbers of women and men who
turned out to protest his visit. The
student group Stanford Students
Opposed to Pornography (STOP)
picketed Chan's hotel, circulated an
anti-pornography petition and
rallied in White Plaza.
Women in STOP also made ap
pointments with Chan, trying to tie
up his schedule and make it difficult
for women to pose. The group also
threatened to boycott The Store in
Tresidder Union if it sold copies of
the October issue of the magazine,
which contains the pictorial.
The Store is selling copies of the
issue, and is handing purchasers a
flier written by STOP and Tresid
der officials. And, despite the ef
forts of STOP. Stanford women did
pose for Playboy. Two of them ap

ycdi in the issue, whicti went on
sale Aug. 27.
Sophomore C.C. Shanahan and
senior Romona Turner are the only-
Stanford representatives among
the 25 women from schools in the
Pacific 10 Conference who posed.
Both Stanford women used
assumed names. Shanahan ap
peared fully clothed, wearing a blue
Stanford T-shirt, white shorts,
socks and tennis shoes and holding
a copy of "Psychology and Life."
Turner is wearing only a blue shirt
— entirely unbuttoned.
When the issue came out last
month. Shanahan, Turner and three
of the five women from UC-
Berkeley who posed made appear
ances on television, radio and at
•bookstores in the Bay Area to
promote sales of the magazine.
The first of the in-person ses
sions was at Waldenbooks in
Berkeley the day the magazine
came out. A sign with a half-dozen
mug shots was posted near the
store entrance: "Come and meet
them in person. Playboy's Girls of

tober Playboy, prepares to register for fall quarter.
the Pac-10. Ask them to autograph your copy of the
October Playboy."
Several dozen people crowded the entrance. Almost
all were men. Magazine sales went briskly, and the
models signed away, trying to personalize the
autographs on their pictures. A few women had copies
autographed for their husbands. One father bought a

copy tor his son. "Wish I had a dad like that," an on
looker remarked.
Despite the advance publicity, sales at The Store
aren't breaking any records. Store Manager Cesar
Cervantes said less than 120 copies have been sold in
nearly a month. Average Playboy sales are around 100
copies per month.
Cervantes said The Store will sell the issue until the
end of this month. "You have to keep in mind that most
students didn't hear about the issue. We've decided to
hold copies so people would get a chance to see what
we're doing."
Cervantes said no one has reacted strongly to being
handed a copy of the flier with the magazine, but com
ments on the issue have been going "50-50," with half
the respondents supporting the flier and half "against
us telling them what to read."
Shanahan and Turner seem as divided on why they
posed as the public is on the sale of the magazine.
"I did this for my portfolio," said Shanahan, who
hopes to go into modeling after graduation. "It's just
another tear sheet, more publicity."
"I wanted to have fun," Turner said. "You know,
girls just want to have fun. It was really enjoyable."
The two disagreed with the anti-pornography dem
onstrators, but held no grudges. "They're entitled to
their opinion. I don't think it's any of their business, but
if they want to do it, fine," said Shanahan.
"1 don't want to upset them," Tamer said. "I per
fectly respect their opinion."
Playboy was not so kind. "During our latest search
for coed beauty, protesters picketed hotels where
Playboy photographers were interviewing prospective
models," the introduction to the feature reads. "Some
people tried to tie up hotel switchboards by phoning in
for fake appointments. Others pushed computer

printed handbills under hotel doors to warn guests of
what was going on down the hall. The most pompous
circulated rhetoric-laden petitions."
The petition that STOP circulated in April stated in
part that "While not the most heinous of pornog
raphers, Playboy reinforces sex stereotypes by
portraying women as sexual objects and thus furthers
inequality in our society."
STOP member Vanessa Poster said earlier this
summer that the group would sponsor another forum

on pornography and would invite Shanahan or Turner
to speak. Both said that they were not interested.
Shanahan said most of her friends didn't know she
would appear in the magazine, but her parents were
supportive. "They're real cool," she said. "It's differ
ent because I'm dressed."
Turner said her friends knew, but her parents didn't.
"My friends — they all love it. My parents — I don't
think they know. It's not like I murdered anyone. I
don't want my parents deciding what my morals should
be. I'm 24 years old."

"I did this for my portfolio," said Shanahan, who
hopes to go into modeling after graduation. "It's just
another tear sheet, more publicity."
"I wanted to have fun," Turner said. "You know,
girls just want to have fun. It was really enjoyable."
The two disagreed with the anti-pornography dem
onstrators, but held no grudges. "They're entitled to
their opinion. I don't think it's any of their business, but
if they want to do it, fine," said Shanahan.
"1 don't want to upset them," Tamer said. "I per
fectly respect their opinion."
Playboy was not so kind. "During our latest search
for coed beauty, protesters picketed hotels where
Playboy photographers were interviewing prospective
models," the introduction to the feature reads. "Some
people tried to tie up hotel switchboards by phoning in
for fake appointments. Others pushed computer

printed handbills under hotel doors to warn guests of
what was going on down the hall. The most pompous
circulated rhetoric-laden petitions."
The petition that STOP circulated in April stated in
part that "While not the most heinous of pornog
raphers, Playboy reinforces sex stereotypes by
portraying women as sexual objects and thus furthers
inequality in our society."
STOP member Vanessa Poster said earlier this
summer that the group would sponsor another forum

on pornography and would invite Shanahan or Turner
to speak. Both said that they were not interested.
Shanahan said most of her friends didn't know she
would appear in the magazine, but her parents were
supportive. "They're real cool," she said. "It's differ
ent because I'm dressed."
Turner said her friends knew, but her parents didn't.
"My friends — they all love it. My parents — I don't
think they know. It's not like I murdered anyone. I
don't want my parents deciding what my morals should
be. I'm 24 years old."

Stanford Students Opposed to Pornography (STOP): "Playboy reinforces sex stereotypes by
portraying women as sexual objects and thus furthers inequality in our society."
When Playboy photographer
David Chan visited Stanford in April
to shoot "Girls of the Pac-10," he
didn't find hordes of women waiting
to be pictured in his publication.
What Chan found were large
numbers of women and men who
turned out to protest his visit. The
student group Stanford Students
Opposed to Pornography (STOP)
picketed Chan's hotel, circulated an
anti-pornography petition and
rallied in White Plaza.
Women in STOP also made ap
pointments with Chan, trying to tie
up his schedule and make it difficult
for women to pose. The group also
threatened to boycott The Store in
Tresidder Union if it sold copies of
the October issue of the magazine,
which contains the pictorial.
The Store is selling copies of the
issue, and is handing purchasers a
flier written by STOP and Tresid
der officials. And, despite the ef
forts of STOP. Stanford women did
pose for Playboy. Two of them ap

ycdi in the issue, whicti went on
sale Aug. 27.
Sophomore C.C. Shanahan and
senior Romona Turner are the only-
Stanford representatives among
the 25 women from schools in the
Pacific 10 Conference who posed.
Both Stanford women used
assumed names. Shanahan ap
peared fully clothed, wearing a blue
Stanford T-shirt, white shorts,
socks and tennis shoes and holding
a copy of "Psychology and Life."
Turner is wearing only a blue shirt
— entirely unbuttoned.
When the issue came out last
month. Shanahan, Turner and three
of the five women from UC-
Berkeley who posed made appear
ances on television, radio and at
•bookstores in the Bay Area to
promote sales of the magazine.
The first of the in-person ses
sions was at Waldenbooks in
Berkeley the day the magazine
came out. A sign with a half-dozen
mug shots was posted near the
store entrance: "Come and meet
them in person. Playboy's Girls of

tober Playboy, prepares to register for fall quarter.
the Pac-10. Ask them to autograph your copy of the
October Playboy."
Several dozen people crowded the entrance. Almost
all were men. Magazine sales went briskly, and the
models signed away, trying to personalize the
autographs on their pictures. A few women had copies
autographed for their husbands. One father bought a

copy tor his son. "Wish I had a dad like that," an on
looker remarked.
Despite the advance publicity, sales at The Store
aren't breaking any records. Store Manager Cesar
Cervantes said less than 120 copies have been sold in
nearly a month. Average Playboy sales are around 100
copies per month.
Cervantes said The Store will sell the issue until the
end of this month. "You have to keep in mind that most
students didn't hear about the issue. We've decided to
hold copies so people would get a chance to see what
we're doing."
Cervantes said no one has reacted strongly to being
handed a copy of the flier with the magazine, but com
ments on the issue have been going "50-50," with half
the respondents supporting the flier and half "against
us telling them what to read."
Shanahan and Turner seem as divided on why they
posed as the public is on the sale of the magazine.
"I did this for my portfolio," said Shanahan, who
hopes to go into modeling after graduation. "It's just
