# Chace To Set Centennial Goals
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
English Prof. William Chace will
help set priorities and goals for the
I Diversity's centennial fund-raising
campaign as vice provost for aca
demic planning and development, a
newly created position he assumed
this month.
In his new role, Chace will focus
on "determining what the Centen
nial Campaign should aim to achieve
and which priorities we deem likely
to draw donor support," he said.
The fund-raising campaign, tied
to the University's 100 th birthday,
will provide money for improve
ments in education, the well-being
and strength of the faculty and the
development of the Near-West
Campus. Chace will decide which of
the many projects submitted to the
Provost's Office for funding will get
"priority treatment."
Chace said he does not see a con
flict between his work and that of
Henry Riggs, the University's vice
president for development. Chace

will work primarily within the Uni
versity, while Riggs focuses on
outside donors.
In addition, Chace said he has
"great admiration" for Riggs and
that the two share a g(x>d rapport.
Chace views his job as an oppor
tunity to help strengthen the
humanities at Stanford. "We owe it
to ourselves and to the future that
the humanities are as strong as the
natural sciences and social sciences
at Stanford," he said.
Although he has been in his new
post for less than a month, Chace
has gained a good deal of experi
ence with the Centennial Cam
paign. He has briefed and updated
the Hoard of Trustees on what the
provost views as campus priorities
and has participated in a two-day
retreat for the University's top ad
ministrators.
Chace, however, said he sees
himself as a faculty member first
and an administrator second,
stressing that the new post is a half
time position.
Neither Chace nor Provost
James Rosse, who appointed

Chace, are certain how long the
new position will last.
"So far it is working marvelously
well," Rosse said.
Rosse described Chace as a man
who "generates excitement."

"He is quick, warm, has a tre
mendous sense of humor and (is) a
great person to represent the Stan
ford faculty," Rosse said.
A former associate dean in the
School of Humanities and Sciences,
Chace won the dean's award for ex
cellence in teaching in 1977.
Chace said that development ac
tivities have been a part of his work
for some time, an interest that has
taken him all over the country. He
is "very happy to be involved in its
(Stanford's) birthday celebration"
and hopes that other faculty mem
bers realize that they, too, can be
"very active and helpful" in the up
coming events.
Chace's notoriety extends
beyond the Stanford perimeter, as
well. A noted literary critic, he
edited "James Joyce: A Collection
of Critical Essays," and wrote "The
Political Identities of Ezra Pound"
and "T.S. Eliot and Lionel Trilling:
Criticisms and Politics." He most
recently completed a textbook, "An
Introduction to Literature," written
with Peter Collier and published
this year.
