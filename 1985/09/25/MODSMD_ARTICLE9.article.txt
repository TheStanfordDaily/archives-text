# Sophs Convocate
## 
### ANDREW PATZMAN Editorial Staff 
Members of the Class of '88 gath
ered yesterday afternoon at Frost
Ampitheatre for the annual Sopho
more Convocation. Ushering in the
new school year, the returning sop
homores munched on box lunches
and mingled with old friends as The
Band, the Mendicants and the Fleet
Street singers provided musical en
tertainment. The sophomores then
heard speeches addressing prob
lems of the sophomore year.
University President Donald
Kennedy highlighted the
ceremonies by announcing the
recipients of this year's Presidential
Awards for Academic Excellence in
the Freshman Year. Martin
Kozdrowicki, one of 29 recipients,
attributed his success to studying
hard, yet maintained that he tried
"never to let studying get in the
way of a good time."
Carolyn Lougee, associate dean
of humanities and sciences and a
Western Culture history instruc
tor, opened the speeches by calling
upon "the survivors of History I and
all of the Class of 1988" to
"celebrate the renewal of the Stan
ford community after four months
of separation."
She reminded the students that,
as sophomores, they would face
greater responsibility and more

"freedom to choose" than they had
as freshmen.
Offering a "student's perspec
tive," senior Susan Rice told the as
sembled sophomores that "while
freshmen may ride the wave of con
venient group identification, the
sophomore year is the year of the
individual." Rice, a history major
and Marshall Fellowship recipient,
emphasized that the sophomore
year is "a time of questioning, ex
ploration and self-evaluation."
"We came here to learn and to
grow," Rice said, "not to finalize a
half-baked conception of ourselves
as a high school senior."
"Sophomore slump is largely a
myth," observed Rice. "Being a
sophomore can be far more fulfilling
than our ignorant meanderings
through freshman year."
Kennedy, in a short speech,
advised sophomores to develop an
"accountability to themselves."
Once the freshman "fury of adjust
ment" is over, Kennedy said, a stu
dent eventually comes to the
realization that "what he is running
is not, after all, a sprint, but a kind
of distance race in which you had
better get some sense of pace."
Kennedy spoke reassuringly of
the perennial sophomore headache:
choosing a major. "The college
major will not have very much rela
tionship at all to what you 'do with
your life,' " he said.
