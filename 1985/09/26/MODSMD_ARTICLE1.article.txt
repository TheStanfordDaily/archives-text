# Coffee House Saga Continues
## 
### LISA LYNCH Staff writer 
Protests against the Saga-run Coffee House began in
earnest yesterday when boycotting students offered a
new variation on the businessman's lunch — the "non
corporate" lunch, at a booth on the Coffee House patio.
The booth was the idea of the Student Union Com
mittee, a group hoping for the reinstatement of Coffee
House, Inc., the student corporation that ran the Cof
fee House until Tresidder management gave the con
tract for the operation to Saga, a national food service
chain, in June.
The boycott, and tomorrow's "Volunteer Rock for a
Student-Run Coffee House," is evidence of the
growing tensions between Coffee House, Inc., the cor
poration now without a coffee house, and the Saga
facility, which has been abandoned by the old staff and
much of its former clientele.
Daniel Rosen, one of the boycott's leaders and a
former CHI employee, said the boycott events will
help make students aware of the present situation —
and also will show Tresidder management that Coffee
House, Inc. has solid suppport.
"They think there's just a small group of us making
all this noise," Rosen said. "But they're dead wrong."
In addition to running the boycott, the Student Union
Committee is looking for an alternative location for a
student coffee house and considering sub-contracting
the Coffee House from Saga. But a location isn't easy
to find, Saga doesn't seem willing to relinquish control
of the Coffee House, and Rosen and others feel that
"financial pressure" may be the one thing Tresidder
management understands.
Coffee House, Inc. came into existence when the
management of the Coffee House was turned over to
the ASSU. Initially student-run and student-built, the
Coffee House was run for a time by TDS, a private
contractor that ran all Tresidder food services between
1973 and 1980. Following a one-year student boycott
of Tresidder services in 1979, Servomation took over
Tresidder food services, and the ASSU won the right
to run the Coffee House as an independent contractor.
In June, Saga was given the right to run all food
services in Tresidder, and the ASSU lost control of the
Coffee House. As of Sept. 1, CHI became a corpora
tion without a coffee house.
Exactly why Coffee House, Inc. lost the bid and the
Coffee House is a matter of opinion. According to
Rosen and the Student Union Committee, students
lost control over the Coffee House because they
"never had any real power. Tresidder controlled the

money," and when Tresidder management realized
that the Coffee House was a financially lucrative
venture, "It gave the Coffee House to a corporation
which by its very nature could never run a coffee
house."
Tresidder officials, on the other hand, say the CHI
Coffee House was successful in the first few years of
its operation, but that it was ineffectively managed at
the time of June's contract negotiations. A Tresidder
press release admits that initially, "Coffee House, Inc.
brought a good understanding of student needs and
student involvement to the operation" and increased
drastically both the quality of the service and the num
ber of customers.
But Tresidder officials say the Coffee House has
been troubled in recent years by "a lack of depth in
management," ineffective menu and service changes
and a cumbersome managerial decision-making
process.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons, who has
stated in the past that he was "delighted at the choice
of Saga," said that he "did not see that the (CHI)
managers recognized the problems in the Coffee
House."
He agreed that the Coffee House had improved im
mediately after the CHI takeover, but said that he felt
there had been a decline in both management and ser

vice. "It's not clear to me that the students who ran the
Coffee House cooperative could have continued, even
if we had given them the bid," he explained.
Council of Presidents member Leslie Leland, the
present CHI president, admitted that the Coffee
House had problems, but said CHI — and Tresidder —
knew the problems were not insoluble.
"We knew there were problems," she said, "and we
wanted to fix them. The problem is, Tresidder wanted
to fix them for us."
Rosen agreed that the Coffee House faced difficul
ties. "Because of the location, we were somewhat
damned from the beginning," he said. "On the one
hand, it was a great, dark, intimate atmosphere, but
we also had no kitchen and a bad traffic pattern."
Despite the problems, Rosen said, a student-run
coffee house inevitably has a greater commitment to
service.
"The students, of course, have a different goal than
Saga does," Rosen said. "We want to break even — I
mean, we never wanted to lose money on the Coffee
House, but we weren't in it for a profit. We were out to
serve the students as the students wanted to be
served."
Rosen cited as an example of Saga's emphasis on

profit over service the Coffee
House's new opening time. Previ
ously opening at 8:30 a.m., the Cof
fee House now opens at 10 a.m.
"I mean, Saga feels they have
Baker Street open, and people who
want coffee can go buy it there. We
feel, if there are people who want
to sit in the Coffee House in the
morning instead of Tresidder, then
the place should be open — even if
it costs a couple hundred dollars a
year."
Rosen insisted that the student
run Coffee House was financially
solvent. "Our grosses have been
steady," he said.
The effects of the takeover seem
as muddled as the reasons behind
it. Physically, the Coffee House
hasn't changed a whole lot. Some
posters have been peeled off the
walls, a few potted plants have
gone home, and the legendary
music collection has been reclaimed
by myriad owners. But the student

built tables, benches and railings
are still there, a STARTS exhibit
hangs on the walls, and the smell of
coffee is everywhere.
Really, there are only two things
missing from the new Coffee House
— the old staff and the Coffee
House clientele.
Saga's Tresidder Services Direc
tor, Sue Tatam, said the CHI Cof
fee House staff resigned en masse
after the Saga takeover, although
all employees were given the option
of staying. The regular clientele of
the Coffee House — what Lyons
has termed the "Coffee House
club" — largely has joined in the
protest and boycott.
Rosen and others insist that the
staff and the regular clientele
created an irreplaceable atmos
phere in the Coffee House.
Therefore, the Student Union
Committee hopes to begin a new
student-run Coffee House else
where on campus or somehow con
tract with Saga to regain control.
"We're looking into a few places
right now, but there aren't a lot of
options," Rosen said. He men

tioned that some students had con
sidered holding "coffee house
nights" at the Bechtel I-Center,
just as the originators of the Coffee
House had done in 1966.
When asked if it would be possi
ble for Coffee House, Inc. to rel
ocate, Nanci Howe, assistant direc
tor of Tresidder, said, "There
really isn't interest in having an
other ongoing food service on
campus. If that's what Coffee
House, Inc. is interested in now,
there's certainly a process they can
go through.
"However, there's a concern
about the financial impact of addi
tional food sales ... the University
community isn't growing, you
know. Also, the University sub
sidizes all food service operations;
that would be one more thing to
subsidize."
To regain student control of the
present Coffee House, CHI would
have to contract with Saga. Accord
ing to Howe, there are three ways
a student group could reach an
agreement with Saga. "First of all,
they could sub-contract under

Saga, which would mean Saga
would have final authority.
Secondly, students could be hired
by Saga as consultants. Lastly, they
could enter into partnership with
Saga; there would be stock and
each would have a number of
shares."
Howe said that whoever runs the
Coffee House would ultimately
have to follow the guidelines of the
Tresidder/Saga contract.
She said that she does not think
the boycott will affect the Coffee
House finances as much as it Vill af
fect regular student users. "I would
hate to think that students who
enjoyed using the Coffee House
feel that they could not do so now,"
she explained.
She added she did not know if the
University would take legal action
against protesters who have set up
a boycott booth on the Coffee
House patio.
"It depends on what they actually
do," she said. "There is a Univer
sity policy on food sales on campus.
We encourage short-term,
programming-related food sales —
for example, the Spring Faire —
but I don't know what will happen if
they plan a long-term booth."
Though CHI did get the Coffee
House contract after the last one
year boycott, the situation is differ
ent this time; instead of an ailing
Coffee House with a contract due to
expire, the Saga-run facility is
newly managed and untried — and
Saga has control over the Coffee
House for at least two years.

According to Howe, the Saga
contract is a two-year contract with
a three-year renewable option,
which means that either Saga or
Tresidder can back out after two
years. Tatam said, however, "Saga
intends to honor the five-year con
tract. "
Whether Saga will — or can —
re-create the Coffee House atmos
phere remains to be seen. "There
will be no major changes right
now," said Tatam. She explained
that student managers have been
moved from the Patio Grill into the
Coffee House, student salaries
have been raised 20 percent, and
there have been some minor menu

changes.
According to Howe, the Coffee
House likely will be relocated within
the next few years, and with the
new location will probably come
major changes. "We hope to rel
ocate to LOTS II (the former
bowling alley)," she said. "That will
give us about 100 new seats, and
we'll finally be able to put in a
kitchen."
But COP member Leland said
she fears Saga and Tresidder man
agement will transform the Coffee
House into a "yuppie" sit-down res
taurant with table service.
"They think the students actually
want this," she said.

new variation on the businessman's lunch — the "non
corporate" lunch, at a booth on the Coffee House patio.
The booth was the idea of the Student Union Com
mittee, a group hoping for the reinstatement of Coffee
House, Inc., the student corporation that ran the Cof
fee House until Tresidder management gave the con
tract for the operation to Saga, a national food service
chain, in June.
The boycott, and tomorrow's "Volunteer Rock for a
Student-Run Coffee House," is evidence of the
growing tensions between Coffee House, Inc., the cor
poration now without a coffee house, and the Saga
facility, which has been abandoned by the old staff and
much of its former clientele.
Daniel Rosen, one of the boycott's leaders and a
former CHI employee, said the boycott events will
help make students aware of the present situation —
and also will show Tresidder management that Coffee
House, Inc. has solid suppport.
"They think there's just a small group of us making
all this noise," Rosen said. "But they're dead wrong."
In addition to running the boycott, the Student Union
Committee is looking for an alternative location for a
student coffee house and considering sub-contracting
the Coffee House from Saga. But a location isn't easy
to find, Saga doesn't seem willing to relinquish control
of the Coffee House, and Rosen and others feel that
"financial pressure" may be the one thing Tresidder
management understands.
Coffee House, Inc. came into existence when the
management of the Coffee House was turned over to
the ASSU. Initially student-run and student-built, the
Coffee House was run for a time by TDS, a private
contractor that ran all Tresidder food services between
1973 and 1980. Following a one-year student boycott
of Tresidder services in 1979, Servomation took over
Tresidder food services, and the ASSU won the right
to run the Coffee House as an independent contractor.
In June, Saga was given the right to run all food
services in Tresidder, and the ASSU lost control of the
Coffee House. As of Sept. 1, CHI became a corpora
tion without a coffee house.
Exactly why Coffee House, Inc. lost the bid and the
Coffee House is a matter of opinion. According to
Rosen and the Student Union Committee, students
lost control over the Coffee House because they
"never had any real power. Tresidder controlled the

money," and when Tresidder management realized
that the Coffee House was a financially lucrative
venture, "It gave the Coffee House to a corporation
which by its very nature could never run a coffee
house."
Tresidder officials, on the other hand, say the CHI
Coffee House was successful in the first few years of
its operation, but that it was ineffectively managed at
the time of June's contract negotiations. A Tresidder
press release admits that initially, "Coffee House, Inc.
brought a good understanding of student needs and
student involvement to the operation" and increased
drastically both the quality of the service and the num
ber of customers.
But Tresidder officials say the Coffee House has
been troubled in recent years by "a lack of depth in
management," ineffective menu and service changes
and a cumbersome managerial decision-making
process.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons, who has
stated in the past that he was "delighted at the choice
of Saga," said that he "did not see that the (CHI)
managers recognized the problems in the Coffee
House."
He agreed that the Coffee House had improved im
mediately after the CHI takeover, but said that he felt
there had been a decline in both management and ser

vice. "It's not clear to me that the students who ran the
Coffee House cooperative could have continued, even
if we had given them the bid," he explained.
Council of Presidents member Leslie Leland, the
present CHI president, admitted that the Coffee
House had problems, but said CHI — and Tresidder —
knew the problems were not insoluble.
"We knew there were problems," she said, "and we
wanted to fix them. The problem is, Tresidder wanted
to fix them for us."
Rosen agreed that the Coffee House faced difficul
ties. "Because of the location, we were somewhat
damned from the beginning," he said. "On the one
hand, it was a great, dark, intimate atmosphere, but
we also had no kitchen and a bad traffic pattern."
Despite the problems, Rosen said, a student-run
coffee house inevitably has a greater commitment to
service.
"The students, of course, have a different goal than
Saga does," Rosen said. "We want to break even — I
mean, we never wanted to lose money on the Coffee
House, but we weren't in it for a profit. We were out to
serve the students as the students wanted to be
served."
Rosen cited as an example of Saga's emphasis on

profit over service the Coffee
House's new opening time. Previ
ously opening at 8:30 a.m., the Cof
fee House now opens at 10 a.m.
"I mean, Saga feels they have
Baker Street open, and people who
want coffee can go buy it there. We
feel, if there are people who want
to sit in the Coffee House in the
morning instead of Tresidder, then
the place should be open — even if
it costs a couple hundred dollars a
year."
Rosen insisted that the student
run Coffee House was financially
solvent. "Our grosses have been
steady," he said.
The effects of the takeover seem
as muddled as the reasons behind
it. Physically, the Coffee House
hasn't changed a whole lot. Some
posters have been peeled off the
walls, a few potted plants have
gone home, and the legendary
music collection has been reclaimed
by myriad owners. But the student

built tables, benches and railings
are still there, a STARTS exhibit
hangs on the walls, and the smell of
coffee is everywhere.
Really, there are only two things
missing from the new Coffee House
— the old staff and the Coffee
House clientele.
Saga's Tresidder Services Direc
tor, Sue Tatam, said the CHI Cof
fee House staff resigned en masse
after the Saga takeover, although
all employees were given the option
of staying. The regular clientele of
the Coffee House — what Lyons
has termed the "Coffee House
club" — largely has joined in the
protest and boycott.
Rosen and others insist that the
staff and the regular clientele
created an irreplaceable atmos
phere in the Coffee House.
Therefore, the Student Union
Committee hopes to begin a new
student-run Coffee House else
where on campus or somehow con
tract with Saga to regain control.
"We're looking into a few places
right now, but there aren't a lot of
options," Rosen said. He men

tioned that some students had con
sidered holding "coffee house
nights" at the Bechtel I-Center,
just as the originators of the Coffee
House had done in 1966.
When asked if it would be possi
ble for Coffee House, Inc. to rel
ocate, Nanci Howe, assistant direc
tor of Tresidder, said, "There
really isn't interest in having an
other ongoing food service on
campus. If that's what Coffee
House, Inc. is interested in now,
there's certainly a process they can
go through.
"However, there's a concern
about the financial impact of addi
tional food sales ... the University
community isn't growing, you
know. Also, the University sub
sidizes all food service operations;
that would be one more thing to
subsidize."
To regain student control of the
present Coffee House, CHI would
have to contract with Saga. Accord
ing to Howe, there are three ways
a student group could reach an
agreement with Saga. "First of all,
they could sub-contract under

Saga, which would mean Saga
would have final authority.
Secondly, students could be hired
by Saga as consultants. Lastly, they
could enter into partnership with
Saga; there would be stock and
each would have a number of
shares."
Howe said that whoever runs the
Coffee House would ultimately
have to follow the guidelines of the
Tresidder/Saga contract.
She said that she does not think
the boycott will affect the Coffee
House finances as much as it Vill af
fect regular student users. "I would
hate to think that students who
enjoyed using the Coffee House
feel that they could not do so now,"
she explained.
She added she did not know if the
University would take legal action
against protesters who have set up
a boycott booth on the Coffee
House patio.
"It depends on what they actually
do," she said. "There is a Univer
sity policy on food sales on campus.
We encourage short-term,
programming-related food sales —
for example, the Spring Faire —
but I don't know what will happen if
they plan a long-term booth."
Though CHI did get the Coffee
House contract after the last one
year boycott, the situation is differ
ent this time; instead of an ailing
Coffee House with a contract due to
expire, the Saga-run facility is
newly managed and untried — and
Saga has control over the Coffee
House for at least two years.

According to Howe, the Saga
contract is a two-year contract with
a three-year renewable option,
which means that either Saga or
Tresidder can back out after two
years. Tatam said, however, "Saga
intends to honor the five-year con
tract. "
Whether Saga will — or can —
re-create the Coffee House atmos
phere remains to be seen. "There
will be no major changes right
now," said Tatam. She explained
that student managers have been
moved from the Patio Grill into the
Coffee House, student salaries
have been raised 20 percent, and
there have been some minor menu

changes.
According to Howe, the Coffee
House likely will be relocated within
the next few years, and with the
new location will probably come
major changes. "We hope to rel
ocate to LOTS II (the former
bowling alley)," she said. "That will
give us about 100 new seats, and
we'll finally be able to put in a
kitchen."
But COP member Leland said
she fears Saga and Tresidder man
agement will transform the Coffee
House into a "yuppie" sit-down res
taurant with table service.
"They think the students actually
want this," she said.

corporate" lunch, at a booth on the Coffee House patio.
The booth was the idea of the Student Union Com
mittee, a group hoping for the reinstatement of Coffee
House, Inc., the student corporation that ran the Cof
fee House until Tresidder management gave the con
tract for the operation to Saga, a national food service
chain, in June.
The boycott, and tomorrow's "Volunteer Rock for a
Student-Run Coffee House," is evidence of the
growing tensions between Coffee House, Inc., the cor
poration now without a coffee house, and the Saga
facility, which has been abandoned by the old staff and
much of its former clientele.
Daniel Rosen, one of the boycott's leaders and a
former CHI employee, said the boycott events will
help make students aware of the present situation —
and also will show Tresidder management that Coffee
House, Inc. has solid suppport.
"They think there's just a small group of us making
all this noise," Rosen said. "But they're dead wrong."
In addition to running the boycott, the Student Union
Committee is looking for an alternative location for a
student coffee house and considering sub-contracting
the Coffee House from Saga. But a location isn't easy
to find, Saga doesn't seem willing to relinquish control
of the Coffee House, and Rosen and others feel that
"financial pressure" may be the one thing Tresidder
management understands.
Coffee House, Inc. came into existence when the
management of the Coffee House was turned over to
the ASSU. Initially student-run and student-built, the
Coffee House was run for a time by TDS, a private
contractor that ran all Tresidder food services between
1973 and 1980. Following a one-year student boycott
of Tresidder services in 1979, Servomation took over
Tresidder food services, and the ASSU won the right
to run the Coffee House as an independent contractor.
In June, Saga was given the right to run all food
services in Tresidder, and the ASSU lost control of the
Coffee House. As of Sept. 1, CHI became a corpora
tion without a coffee house.
Exactly why Coffee House, Inc. lost the bid and the
Coffee House is a matter of opinion. According to
Rosen and the Student Union Committee, students
lost control over the Coffee House because they
"never had any real power. Tresidder controlled the

money," and when Tresidder management realized
that the Coffee House was a financially lucrative
venture, "It gave the Coffee House to a corporation
which by its very nature could never run a coffee
house."
Tresidder officials, on the other hand, say the CHI
Coffee House was successful in the first few years of
its operation, but that it was ineffectively managed at
the time of June's contract negotiations. A Tresidder
press release admits that initially, "Coffee House, Inc.
brought a good understanding of student needs and
student involvement to the operation" and increased
drastically both the quality of the service and the num
ber of customers.
But Tresidder officials say the Coffee House has
been troubled in recent years by "a lack of depth in
management," ineffective menu and service changes
and a cumbersome managerial decision-making
process.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons, who has
stated in the past that he was "delighted at the choice
of Saga," said that he "did not see that the (CHI)
managers recognized the problems in the Coffee
House."
He agreed that the Coffee House had improved im
mediately after the CHI takeover, but said that he felt
there had been a decline in both management and ser

vice. "It's not clear to me that the students who ran the
Coffee House cooperative could have continued, even
if we had given them the bid," he explained.
Council of Presidents member Leslie Leland, the
present CHI president, admitted that the Coffee
House had problems, but said CHI — and Tresidder —
knew the problems were not insoluble.
"We knew there were problems," she said, "and we
wanted to fix them. The problem is, Tresidder wanted
to fix them for us."
Rosen agreed that the Coffee House faced difficul
ties. "Because of the location, we were somewhat
damned from the beginning," he said. "On the one
hand, it was a great, dark, intimate atmosphere, but
we also had no kitchen and a bad traffic pattern."
Despite the problems, Rosen said, a student-run
coffee house inevitably has a greater commitment to
service.
"The students, of course, have a different goal than
Saga does," Rosen said. "We want to break even — I
mean, we never wanted to lose money on the Coffee
House, but we weren't in it for a profit. We were out to
serve the students as the students wanted to be
served."
Rosen cited as an example of Saga's emphasis on

profit over service the Coffee
House's new opening time. Previ
ously opening at 8:30 a.m., the Cof
fee House now opens at 10 a.m.
"I mean, Saga feels they have
Baker Street open, and people who
want coffee can go buy it there. We
feel, if there are people who want
to sit in the Coffee House in the
morning instead of Tresidder, then
the place should be open — even if
it costs a couple hundred dollars a
year."
Rosen insisted that the student
run Coffee House was financially
solvent. "Our grosses have been
steady," he said.
The effects of the takeover seem
as muddled as the reasons behind
it. Physically, the Coffee House
hasn't changed a whole lot. Some
posters have been peeled off the
walls, a few potted plants have
gone home, and the legendary
music collection has been reclaimed
by myriad owners. But the student

built tables, benches and railings
are still there, a STARTS exhibit
hangs on the walls, and the smell of
coffee is everywhere.
Really, there are only two things
missing from the new Coffee House
— the old staff and the Coffee
House clientele.
Saga's Tresidder Services Direc
tor, Sue Tatam, said the CHI Cof
fee House staff resigned en masse
after the Saga takeover, although
all employees were given the option
of staying. The regular clientele of
the Coffee House — what Lyons
has termed the "Coffee House
club" — largely has joined in the
protest and boycott.
Rosen and others insist that the
staff and the regular clientele
created an irreplaceable atmos
phere in the Coffee House.
Therefore, the Student Union
Committee hopes to begin a new
student-run Coffee House else
where on campus or somehow con
tract with Saga to regain control.
"We're looking into a few places
right now, but there aren't a lot of
options," Rosen said. He men

tioned that some students had con
sidered holding "coffee house
nights" at the Bechtel I-Center,
just as the originators of the Coffee
House had done in 1966.
When asked if it would be possi
ble for Coffee House, Inc. to rel
ocate, Nanci Howe, assistant direc
tor of Tresidder, said, "There
really isn't interest in having an
other ongoing food service on
campus. If that's what Coffee
House, Inc. is interested in now,
there's certainly a process they can
go through.
"However, there's a concern
about the financial impact of addi
tional food sales ... the University
community isn't growing, you
know. Also, the University sub
sidizes all food service operations;
that would be one more thing to
subsidize."
To regain student control of the
present Coffee House, CHI would
have to contract with Saga. Accord
ing to Howe, there are three ways
a student group could reach an
agreement with Saga. "First of all,
they could sub-contract under

Saga, which would mean Saga
would have final authority.
Secondly, students could be hired
by Saga as consultants. Lastly, they
could enter into partnership with
Saga; there would be stock and
each would have a number of
shares."
Howe said that whoever runs the
Coffee House would ultimately
have to follow the guidelines of the
Tresidder/Saga contract.
She said that she does not think
the boycott will affect the Coffee
House finances as much as it Vill af
fect regular student users. "I would
hate to think that students who
enjoyed using the Coffee House
feel that they could not do so now,"
she explained.
She added she did not know if the
University would take legal action
against protesters who have set up
a boycott booth on the Coffee
House patio.
"It depends on what they actually
do," she said. "There is a Univer
sity policy on food sales on campus.
We encourage short-term,
programming-related food sales —
for example, the Spring Faire —
but I don't know what will happen if
they plan a long-term booth."
Though CHI did get the Coffee
House contract after the last one
year boycott, the situation is differ
ent this time; instead of an ailing
Coffee House with a contract due to
expire, the Saga-run facility is
newly managed and untried — and
Saga has control over the Coffee
House for at least two years.

According to Howe, the Saga
contract is a two-year contract with
a three-year renewable option,
which means that either Saga or
Tresidder can back out after two
years. Tatam said, however, "Saga
intends to honor the five-year con
tract. "
Whether Saga will — or can —
re-create the Coffee House atmos
phere remains to be seen. "There
will be no major changes right
now," said Tatam. She explained
that student managers have been
moved from the Patio Grill into the
Coffee House, student salaries
have been raised 20 percent, and
there have been some minor menu

changes.
According to Howe, the Coffee
House likely will be relocated within
the next few years, and with the
new location will probably come
major changes. "We hope to rel
ocate to LOTS II (the former
bowling alley)," she said. "That will
give us about 100 new seats, and
we'll finally be able to put in a
kitchen."
But COP member Leland said
she fears Saga and Tresidder man
agement will transform the Coffee
House into a "yuppie" sit-down res
taurant with table service.
"They think the students actually
want this," she said.
