# Coffee House Saga Continues
## 
### LISA LYNCH Staff writer 
Protests against the Saga-run Coffee House began in
earnest yesterday when boycotting students offered a
new variation on the businessman's lunch — the "non
corporate" lunch, at a booth on the Coffee House patio.
The booth was the idea of the Student Union Com
mittee, a group hoping for the reinstatement of Coffee
House, Inc., the student corporation that ran the Cof
fee House until Tresidder management gave the con
tract for the operation to Saga, a national food service
chain, in June.
The boycott, and tomorrow's "Volunteer Rock for a
Student-Run Coffee House," is evidence of the
growing tensions between Coffee House, Inc., the cor
poration now without a coffee house, and the Saga
facility, which has been abandoned by the old staff and
much of its former clientele.
Daniel Rosen, one of the boycott's leaders and a
former CHI employee, said the boycott events will
help make students aware of the present situation —
and also will show Tresidder management that Coffee
House, Inc. has solid suppport.
"They think there's just a small group of us making
all this noise," Rosen said. "But they're dead wrong."
In addition to running the boycott, the Student Union
Committee is looking for an alternative location for a
student coffee house and considering sub-contracting
the Coffee House from Saga. But a location isn't easy
to find, Saga doesn't seem willing to relinquish control
of the Coffee House, and Rosen and others feel that
"financial pressure" may be the one thing Tresidder
management understands.
Coffee House, Inc. came into existence when the
management of the Coffee House was turned over to
the ASSU. Initially student-run and student-built, the
Coffee House was run for a time by TDS, a private
contractor that ran all Tresidder food services between
1973 and 1980. Following a one-year student boycott
of Tresidder services in 1979, Servomation took over
Tresidder food services, and the ASSU won the right
to run the Coffee House as an independent contractor.
In June, Saga was given the right to run all food
services in Tresidder, and the ASSU lost control of the
Coffee House. As of Sept. 1, CHI became a corpora
tion without a coffee house.
Exactly why Coffee House, Inc. lost the bid and the
Coffee House is a matter of opinion. According to
Rosen and the Student Union Committee, students
lost control over the Coffee House because they
"never had any real power. Tresidder controlled the

money," and when Tresidder management realized
that the Coffee House was a financially lucrative
venture, "It gave the Coffee House to a corporation
which by its very nature could never run a coffee
house."
Tresidder officials, on the other hand, say the CHI
Coffee House was successful in the first few years of
its operation, but that it was ineffectively managed at
the time of June's contract negotiations. A Tresidder
press release admits that initially, "Coffee House, Inc.
brought a good understanding of student needs and
student involvement to the operation" and increased
drastically both the quality of the service and the num
ber of customers.
But Tresidder officials say the Coffee House has
been troubled in recent years by "a lack of depth in
management," ineffective menu and service changes
and a cumbersome managerial decision-making
process.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons, who has
stated in the past that he was "delighted at the choice
of Saga," said that he "did not see that the (CHI)
managers recognized the problems in the Coffee
House."
He agreed that the Coffee House had improved im
mediately after the CHI takeover, but said that he felt
there had been a decline in both management and ser

vice. "It's not clear to me that the students who ran the
Coffee House cooperative could have continued, even
if we had given them the bid," he explained.
Council of Presidents member Leslie Leland, the
present CHI president, admitted that the Coffee
House had problems, but said CHI — and Tresidder —
knew the problems were not insoluble.
"We knew there were problems," she said, "and we
wanted to fix them. The problem is, Tresidder wanted
to fix them for us."
Rosen agreed that the Coffee House faced difficul
ties. "Because of the location, we were somewhat
damned from the beginning," he said. "On the one
hand, it was a great, dark, intimate atmosphere, but
we also had no kitchen and a bad traffic pattern."
Despite the problems, Rosen said, a student-run
coffee house inevitably has a greater commitment to
service.
"The students, of course, have a different goal than
Saga does," Rosen said. "We want to break even — I
mean, we never wanted to lose money on the Coffee
House, but we weren't in it for a profit. We were out to
serve the students as the students wanted to be
served."
Rosen cited as an example of Saga's emphasis on
