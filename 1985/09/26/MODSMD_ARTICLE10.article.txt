## Responsible Cable TV Needed 
### 
This letter concerns Palo Alto's choice of a cable
television operator to serve our multi-city area. Very
soon we will all be paying a cable operator for the tele
vision channels it will select, and we should be very
concerned about what kinds of programs are going to
be available to us.
Will we have a choice of only "Charlie's Angels,"
"The A Team," "Cagney & Lacey," "Bleepers,
Bloopers, and Blunders" and "Wheel of Fortune?" Or
will be able to choose programs that we can learn
something from?

VIEWPOINT

It looks like we're going to get HBO, Showtime,
sports networks and other entertainments as optional
packages; but what about the basic service selection of
channels? Will there be nothing informative, politically
unusual or just plain useful on the basic channels? Will
we, as cable subscribers, be able to watch only junk
entertainment television, or will we be able to look out
into the real world and make important discoveries
about our communities, our families, our political sys
tem or our government?
News programs only do part of the job. Our chief
concern should not be average, everyday TV enter
tainment, or even "premium" channels — that is not
representative of the good that can come from televi
sion. Instead, we need a full range of public access and
local public service programming, the sort of program
ming that opens up new vistas of knowledge and
awareness for children, adults, politicians,
homemakers, educators and professionals — for
anyone who wants to profit from seeing how things
really are. This is extremely important.
We must remember that television is both an enter
tainment medium and an educational medium. The
little-mentioned truth is that all too many Americans
derive their views of political and social landscapes
from what they see when they watch entertainment
television. Any cable operator that decides to devote
95 percent of its channels to entertainment fits right
into the normal pattern of entertainment-only televi
sion watching.
Palo Alto and the nation still face the problem of
watching too much "junk" television. How much longer
are we going to allow junk television to be a major influ
ence in our lives? We must admit that television

viewers deserve as broad a selection of materials that
convey images of reality as possible. The Palo Alto
City Council must choose the cable operator that will
offer a much wider range of useful, educational, docu
mentary, self-help, political, social analysis, charity,
news and service programming than is normally
available from most cable operators in this country.
We cannot overstress the importance of choosing a
cable operator that offers not just two or three access
and public service channels but more than that, prob
ably four to six channels. That number might be suffici
ent to ensure that all reasonably qualified persons are
granted time to cablecast their publicly useful material
across the system. It might be enough channels to air
all available important, non-frivolous programs, includ
ing programs produced in neighboring cities such as
San Francisco or even programs originating in foreign
countries.
The need for channel space in order to accommodate
non-entertainment programming may expand exponen
tially as the types and varieties of such programming
multiply and are distributed more widely.
Who is to say that home video recorders will not
eventually increase dramatically the quantity of inter
esting, home-produced documentaries, human interest
specials and how-to features that may be sent out on
the cable? How difficult is it for an average person to
convey more than a simple public service announce
ment or "free speech message" on regular broadcast
television?
The answer is: It is considerably difficult. Do we
dare allow a cable operator to do the same thing and
lock up almost all of its available channels for entertain
ment?
Now is the time to try to open up the television
medium by channeling a significant portion of cable en
tertainment's abundant revenues toward opening up
more of the real world for the thousands and thousands
of television viewers, young and old, who spend so
much of their time watching television.
Television is a powerful, persuasive force, not just in
middle America, but in Palo Alto as well. Please call or
write to the city council and tell them to choose the
operator that will provide the most non-entertainment
television.
