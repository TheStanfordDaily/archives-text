Why Stanford could not have
started its classes one day later
and therefore avoided having the
first day of classes on Yom Kip
pur is a question which has gone\e
through my mind several times.
It is ironic that a school such as
Stanford, which stresses ethnic
backgrounds, chooses to disregard
religious ones. Yom Kippur is the
holiest day of the year for Jewish
people. Jews all over the world fast
for attonement for a period of 24
hours, consuming neither food nor
water. No work is supposed to be
done, and the most vigorous activ
ity is the walk to services.
By forcing Jewish professors and
students to choose between at
tending classes or attending
services, Stanford is displaying a
callousness not exhibited in its
catalogues. It is inconsiderate and
tasteless to start classes on Yom
Kippur.
Other institutions, such as
Princeton and Harvard, did not
have classes on Rosh Hashana (a
Jewish holiday that precedes Yom
Kippur). By not having the first
day of classes on Rosh Hashana,
Jewish professors were able to tell
their classes that they would not
meet, and students were able to
notify their teachers (in advance)
of their absence. Although Stan
ford compares itself constantly to
Harvard, in this situation it cer
tainly did not measure up to Har
vard.
The first day of classes might be
insignificant to most people, with
only syllabi handed out. But by
having classes on Yom Kippur,
Stanford is making a statement of
disregard to its Jewish community

— a statement which, in the
future, it will hopefully change.

Yet another academic year is
upon us and many of us are most
likely searching for interesting
courses, new hobbies and maybe
even innovative ways to further
the ageless art of procrastination.
Your time is extremely precious
and should be used to its fullest
potential. There are many opportu
nities that the Stanford community
has to offer, but there are also
many things you can offer it in
return.
There are numerous community
service organizations on campus in
need of active participation by our
student body. Educate yourself to
the various options. Only you
know how to best use your time,
serve your community and help
yourself by helping others. Give it
some thought. Your time and effort
can make a difference.

Letters Should

The new year has The Daily off
to a disappointing start. Your first
two issues carried the "opinions"
of an anti-Semite from Sacramento
(0. L. Brannaman, who referred to
"Rabbi Reagan") and a misogynist
from San Jose (D. Costa, who tells
people concerned about pornogra
phy to "stop squawking").
It is an entirely mistaken con-

ception of the role of the free
press to deny space to informed
and responsible opinion in order to
print the abusive letters of every
lunatic who clamors for attention.
This is not to protest against
opinions I disagree with; it is a
protest against an editorial practice
that cannot distinguish between a
reasoned argument and an inflam
matory tirade. The Daily is not
Hustler; it is not even Soldier of
Fortune. It is a university newspa
per, and as such it should share in
the mission of a university; to
inform and educate. May we hope
for more responsible editorial guid
ance as the new academic year
unfolds?
