## Keeton To Run Food Service 
### CHRIS FIALKO 
The food at Stanford's dining
halls may not taste different than
last year, but give new Director of
Food Service Jim Keeton some
time, and he says he hopes to make
eating on campus a more
pleasurable experience.
Today is only the fourth day on
the job for Keeton, who was chosen
to fill the post vacated by the retir
ing Maxine Anderson. Don't expect
the food to become immediately
more delectable.
"Right now I'm just touring the
campus and becoming familiar with
the facilities and employees,"
Keeton said. "I'm still trying to
learn names."
The names and figures of
Keeton's career and education so
far point to ample experience in the
food service business.
Keeton attended the State Uni
versity of New York, Rochester In
stitute of Technology, Syracuse
University and Empire State Col
lege, obtaining a degree in hotel
and restaurant management and
completing courses in accounting,
marketing, human relations and
labor relations.
For the last seven years Keeton
was director of Auxiliary Campus
Enterprises and Services (ACES)
at State University College in
Alfred, New York.
The students there weren't com
plaining about eggplant stack-ups.
During his tenure at Alfred State,
Keeton developed and managed a
$4 million budget, negotiated labor
contracts and redesigned meal
plans.
He also implemented a previ
ously untested computer system
for managing the plans.
Furthermore, under Keeton's di

rection, ACES won several national
university food service awards.
The company captured first prizes
for best residence hall dining stan
dard menu and best special event, a
"M.A.S.H. bash."
But at the moment, Keeton has
no special plans for Stanford.
"First of all I'm evaluating the
present system," he said. "It's
going to take some time."
Keeton will spend most of his
time on his biggest challenge — im
proving the meals at Stern Hall, he
said.
Food service is tentatively plan
ning some renovations for Stern
next summer, and preliminary
drawings for equipment improve
ments are in the works, according
to the new director.
Keeton would also like to see
some changes in the physical
aspects of the dining rooms at
Stern.
"I'm a firm believer that a com
fortable and pleasing dining atmos
phere adds immensely to the enjoy
ment of a meal," Keeton said.
While remodeling may make
eating more comfortable, the only
way to make the food taste better is
to change the way it is prepared, he
admitted.
"All food service food throughout
the campus is uniformly ordered
from the same companies," Keeton
explained. "The difference in the
taste of food between dorms must
be due to chef and equipment incon
sistencies."
The director hopes that new food
preparation machines will help im
prove Stern food next year.
In addition, an a la carte plan
similar to the one now in effect at
Sterling Quad is under considera
tion as food service plans Stern's

redevelopment.
"I'd like to talk to the faculty
members who dine at our
facilities," Keeton said. "Another
thing I'm interested in is the way in
which food service can work with
Stanford's Residential Education
program."
Like the Class of '89, Keeton is
in his first year of work at Stanford.
Also like them, he said he would
need to learn his way around
campus.
"I'm interested in as much feed
back as possible," Keeton con
cluded.
