Study Says Law School
Really Is Maddening
Its finally official. A new study presented at the an
nual meeting of the American Psychological Associa
tion shows that law students tend to be less stable
mentally than the average population.
In order to be a good adversary, you might need to
be suspicious of everybody or obsessively hardworking
or very anxious and hyped," said Andrew Benjamin,
who is a lawyer and a psychologist at the University of
Washington Medical School in Seattle.
The research conducted on 706 pre-law students at
the University of Arizona, which is thought to be typi
cal of many law schools, shows increasing depression
from first to third-year students, slacking off two years
into legal practice.
In general the study indicated that anywhere from 17
to 40 percent of law students feel much more hostility,
paranoia and alienation once they enter law school.
"As soon as students hit law school, these symptom
levels become significantiy elevated," Benjamin said.
"The distress levels stayed the same throughout law
school, except by the third year depression was
worse."
He cautioned that he didn't want to make it sound
like all lawyers are psychopaths, but widespread use of
the same tests have found that only 2 percent of the
general population would have such significant
symptoms, he said.
Berkeley Loses Brothel
The "best little whorehouse in Berkeley" as some
neighbors called it, was shut down by police in the
course of a high speed chase early this month.
Police pulled over Mark Kermoyan, 26, of Walnut
Creek, for speeding, and discovered by radio that he
was wanted for a felony drug charge and two mis
demeanors in Contra Costa County.
Meanwhile, Kermoyan fled to Maros Palace of
Domination, a California Street bordello that catered to
1,500 customers with sado-masochistic sexual ap
petites for the past decade, reported The Daily Califor
nian.
Police said they found him on the second floor of the
six-room/torture chamber house that was stocked with
15 boxes of whips, chains, uniforms, tables, harnesses
and masks.
The Daily Cal article didn't mention any connection
between Kermoyan and either the house or the two
women that police arrested on charges of prostitution.
Neighbors weren't surprised by the raid though.
"There were guys going in there every day," said
resident Jesse James, 74. "We were expecting it (the
raid). All of us eventually got to get busted."
Someone should make a musical out of the story.

Texans Get The Pill
Planned Parenthood opened a new office near the
University of Texas campus this year because the offi
cial student health center is so swamped that appoint
ments for gynecological exams are being made up to a
month in advance.
"We were looking for a location which would be con
venient for our clients," said Larry Brownsteen,
Planned Parenthood director. "Riverside (the area
around the new clinic) has a high number of students
living in the area, and the shuttle bus route there adds
to the convenience."
He claims his center can schedule the students
within one or two days, charging only minimal fees for
"top quality care."
If the student has had a recent Pap test, the student
health center will renew a prescription for birth control
pills, and it can be filled at the student pharmacy.
San Jose State ROTC
Comes Under Attack
San Jose State ROTC officials were just following or
ders when they refused to let homosexuals take part in
two summer camp courses.
After all, the Academic Senate approved the practice
by a narrow margin last May, and even the U.S.
Defense Department doesn't allow homosexuals to be
in the armed forces.
But the ACLU and SJSU's Gay and Lesbian Alliance
seem to object. The ACLU is even considering filing a
class action suit on behalf of the group.
GALA Adviser Wiggsy Sivertsen contacted the
ACLU and is optimistic about their chances.
"The ACLU is very interested," Sivertsen said.
"We're past the first stage. Meanwhile we are going to
continue to ask the university not to give credit to
classes that homosexuals can't get into."
This has been an issue on the San Jose campus since
it was discovered that although the ROTC claimed to
admit all students regardless of sexual preference, in
actuality, students who answered yes when asked on
the application if they were homosexual, were indeed
denied admission.
The senate did pass two measures making it illegal
to circulate forms that require students to disclose
their sexual preferences and censoring any information
about stipends or awards, sometimes denied because
of this preference, from university publications.
Uncle Sam only wants you if you fit his image.

Selling Banned Books
San Jose State University's Bookstore recently con
ducted an informal study of the principle that if you tell
people not to do something you increase the likelihood
of them doing it.
Nancy McMahon, the Spartan Shops general
manager wasn't surprised at the successful turnout for
"Banned Books Week" earlier this month.
This is the fourth year that students have flocked to
buy books that some people deemed offensive as far
back as 387 B.C.
Planners had a long list of titles to stock up on, in
cluding the Bible, "The Adventures of Huckleberry
Finn" and"The Joy of Sex."
McMahon said the majority of complaints over

literary works, which ultimately leads to censorship,
stem from such concerns as sex, violence, obscenity
and "objectional language."
The event wasn't supposed to spark extreme reac
tions, but a tolerance for different ideas.
According to "Censored!," the official resource book
for the event, the freedom to choose and to express
one's opinion is the message "Banned Book Week" at
tempts to convey.
"Our position is that we're not going to take a posi
tion," McMahon said. "People can choose what they
want to read themselves. We can't make that choice for
them. That's what this week is all about."
"We've had quite a few supportive comments," she
said.
Just think how much reading would be done for
classes if all the textbooks were once considered un
suitable material for minors or others to read.

Domination, a California Street bordello that catered to
1,500 customers with sado-masochistic sexual ap
petites for the past decade, reported The Daily Califor
nian.
Police said they found him on the second floor of the
six-room/torture chamber house that was stocked with
15 boxes of whips, chains, uniforms, tables, harnesses
and masks.
The Daily Cal article didn't mention any connection
between Kermoyan and either the house or the two
women that police arrested on charges of prostitution.
Neighbors weren't surprised by the raid though.
"There were guys going in there every day," said
resident Jesse James, 74. "We were expecting it (the
raid). All of us eventually got to get busted."
Someone should make a musical out of the story.

Texans Get The Pill
Planned Parenthood opened a new office near the
University of Texas campus this year because the offi
cial student health center is so swamped that appoint
ments for gynecological exams are being made up to a
month in advance.
"We were looking for a location which would be con
venient for our clients," said Larry Brownsteen,
Planned Parenthood director. "Riverside (the area
around the new clinic) has a high number of students
living in the area, and the shuttle bus route there adds
to the convenience."
He claims his center can schedule the students
within one or two days, charging only minimal fees for
"top quality care."
If the student has had a recent Pap test, the student
health center will renew a prescription for birth control
pills, and it can be filled at the student pharmacy.
San Jose State ROTC
Comes Under Attack
San Jose State ROTC officials were just following or
ders when they refused to let homosexuals take part in
two summer camp courses.
After all, the Academic Senate approved the practice
by a narrow margin last May, and even the U.S.
Defense Department doesn't allow homosexuals to be
in the armed forces.
But the ACLU and SJSU's Gay and Lesbian Alliance
seem to object. The ACLU is even considering filing a
class action suit on behalf of the group.
GALA Adviser Wiggsy Sivertsen contacted the
ACLU and is optimistic about their chances.
"The ACLU is very interested," Sivertsen said.
"We're past the first stage. Meanwhile we are going to
continue to ask the university not to give credit to
classes that homosexuals can't get into."
This has been an issue on the San Jose campus since
it was discovered that although the ROTC claimed to
admit all students regardless of sexual preference, in
actuality, students who answered yes when asked on
the application if they were homosexual, were indeed
denied admission.
The senate did pass two measures making it illegal
to circulate forms that require students to disclose
their sexual preferences and censoring any information
about stipends or awards, sometimes denied because
of this preference, from university publications.
Uncle Sam only wants you if you fit his image.

Selling Banned Books
San Jose State University's Bookstore recently con
ducted an informal study of the principle that if you tell
people not to do something you increase the likelihood
of them doing it.
Nancy McMahon, the Spartan Shops general
manager wasn't surprised at the successful turnout for
"Banned Books Week" earlier this month.
This is the fourth year that students have flocked to
buy books that some people deemed offensive as far
back as 387 B.C.
Planners had a long list of titles to stock up on, in
cluding the Bible, "The Adventures of Huckleberry
Finn" and"The Joy of Sex."
McMahon said the majority of complaints over

literary works, which ultimately leads to censorship,
stem from such concerns as sex, violence, obscenity
and "objectional language."
The event wasn't supposed to spark extreme reac
tions, but a tolerance for different ideas.
According to "Censored!," the official resource book
for the event, the freedom to choose and to express
one's opinion is the message "Banned Book Week" at
tempts to convey.
"Our position is that we're not going to take a posi
tion," McMahon said. "People can choose what they
want to read themselves. We can't make that choice for
them. That's what this week is all about."
"We've had quite a few supportive comments," she
said.
Just think how much reading would be done for
classes if all the textbooks were once considered un
suitable material for minors or others to read.

Study Says Law School
Really Is Maddening
Its finally official. A new study presented at the an
nual meeting of the American Psychological Associa
tion shows that law students tend to be less stable
mentally than the average population.
In order to be a good adversary, you might need to
be suspicious of everybody or obsessively hardworking
or very anxious and hyped," said Andrew Benjamin,
who is a lawyer and a psychologist at the University of
Washington Medical School in Seattle.
The research conducted on 706 pre-law students at
the University of Arizona, which is thought to be typi
cal of many law schools, shows increasing depression
from first to third-year students, slacking off two years
into legal practice.
In general the study indicated that anywhere from 17
to 40 percent of law students feel much more hostility,
paranoia and alienation once they enter law school.
"As soon as students hit law school, these symptom
levels become significantiy elevated," Benjamin said.
"The distress levels stayed the same throughout law
school, except by the third year depression was
worse."
He cautioned that he didn't want to make it sound
like all lawyers are psychopaths, but widespread use of
the same tests have found that only 2 percent of the
general population would have such significant
symptoms, he said.
Berkeley Loses Brothel
The "best little whorehouse in Berkeley" as some
neighbors called it, was shut down by police in the
course of a high speed chase early this month.
Police pulled over Mark Kermoyan, 26, of Walnut
Creek, for speeding, and discovered by radio that he
was wanted for a felony drug charge and two mis
demeanors in Contra Costa County.
Meanwhile, Kermoyan fled to Maros Palace of
Domination, a California Street bordello that catered to
1,500 customers with sado-masochistic sexual ap
petites for the past decade, reported The Daily Califor
nian.

and masks.
