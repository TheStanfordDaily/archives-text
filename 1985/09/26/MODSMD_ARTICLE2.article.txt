# Labor Talks
## Job security focus 
### MARK BEYREIS Staff writer 
Bargaining teams for the University and United
Stanford Workers (USW) discussed the latest
proposals in ongoing labor negotiations yesterday, and
the union's chief negotiator said job security as
surances will have to be a key part of any new agree
ment.
The talks were the first between the University and
the union since the University's initial wage offer on
Sept. 19.
University negotiators have said they want written
into the contract the right to determine whether a job
should be performed by an outside contractor, but
Mary Ann Tenudo, the union's chief negotiator, said
she fears the consequences of such a move.
"What we've heard is that they might contract out
food service in the dorms," Tenudo said. "All we want
to do is make sure that they (the outside contractor
employees) have the same wages, hours, benefits and
working benefits including representation (that current
union members have)," Tenudo said.
However, University negotiator Priscilla Wheeler
said the University historically has had the right to
make contracting decisions, and now wants to put that
right into the contract.
An example of the outside contracting issue is job
shoppers at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC). Job shoppers are technical and maintenance
workers who are employed by an outside firm that the
University has commissioned to supply temporary
workers. Local 680 wants these temporaries to
become permanent employees with union representa
tion.
Wheeler has charged that "many of the union's
proposals are aimed at increasing union membership."
"Our purpose isn't only union membership," Tenudo
countered, adding that unionized workers at SLAC
perceive that management is passing them over in fa
vor of temporary employees for more complex work.
The unionized workers fear that they might be laid off,
she said.
Tenudo said the use of outside contractors began in
1977 and that the "condition has worsened."
At yesterday's meeting, the two sides also dis
cussed the union's proposed wage increase that would
mean a 13.5 percent increase in the University's over
all labor costs, which are presently $33.5 million,
Wheeler said. The union is demanding individual salary
increases from 10.5 percent to 23 percent.
Wheeler said increases in pension
benefits that the union is also
seeking would mean an even more
substantial increase in University
costs, but Tenudo said the overall
labor cost increase would be only
one to two percent.
The negotiators also discussed
additional aspects of the job secur
ity question, including a controver
sial proposed change in a portion of
the present contract.
The disputed portion in the pres
ent contract states that "work reg
ularly and customarily performed
by workers shall not be performed
by individuals not in the bargaining
unit to the extent that it directly
results in a worker's layoff or
removal to a lower classification. If
any such incident occurs the
worker shall be compensated for
any loss in regular pay."
The union wants to expand this
portion to make it impossible for
the University to lay off a union

member if the job he performed still
exists, Wheeler said.
She said that because the Uni
versity depends upon research
grants that are subject to reduction,
it needs to reserve the right to
make "operational and budgeting
decisions."
Wheeler gave the example of a
director who, faced with a reduced
research grant, might choose to cut
costs by laying off a glassware
washer and assigning the duty to a
lab assistant. Under the union's
proposal, the research director
would not be able to make that
choice.
Each side has criticized the other
in its handling of the negotiations.
Wheeler said the union "has
spent a lot of time trying to drum up
support," and suggested that union
leaders focus more on the actual
negotiations.
On the other side, Tenudo
accused the University of
"misrepresenting" to the Stanford
community the union's proposals.
