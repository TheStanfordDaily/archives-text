# Labor Talks
## Job security focus 
### MARK BEYREIS Staff writer 
Bargaining teams for the University and United
Stanford Workers (USW) discussed the latest
proposals in ongoing labor negotiations yesterday, and
the union's chief negotiator said job security as
surances will have to be a key part of any new agree
ment.
The talks were the first between the University and
the union since the University's initial wage offer on
Sept. 19.
University negotiators have said they want written
into the contract the right to determine whether a job
should be performed by an outside contractor, but
Mary Ann Tenudo, the union's chief negotiator, said
she fears the consequences of such a move.
"What we've heard is that they might contract out
food service in the dorms," Tenudo said. "All we want
to do is make sure that they (the outside contractor
employees) have the same wages, hours, benefits and
working benefits including representation (that current
union members have)," Tenudo said.
However, University negotiator Priscilla Wheeler
said the University historically has had the right to
make contracting decisions, and now wants to put that
right into the contract.
An example of the outside contracting issue is job
shoppers at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC). Job shoppers are technical and maintenance
workers who are employed by an outside firm that the
University has commissioned to supply temporary
workers. Local 680 wants these temporaries to
become permanent employees with union representa
tion.
Wheeler has charged that "many of the union's
proposals are aimed at increasing union membership."
"Our purpose isn't only union membership," Tenudo
countered, adding that unionized workers at SLAC
perceive that management is passing them over in fa
vor of temporary employees for more complex work.
The unionized workers fear that they might be laid off,
she said.
Tenudo said the use of outside contractors began in
1977 and that the "condition has worsened."
At yesterday's meeting, the two sides also dis
cussed the union's proposed wage increase that would
mean a 13.5 percent increase in the University's over
all labor costs, which are presently $33.5 million,
Wheeler said. The union is demanding individual salary
increases from 10.5 percent to 23 percent.
