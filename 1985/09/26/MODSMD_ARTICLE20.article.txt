## Akiyoshi's Tadpoles Tame SF Jazz Scene 
### CHRIS HAQQ 
Sunday night the Great American
Music Hall echoed to a "March of
the Tadpoles" — Toshiko
Akiyoshi's jazz tadpoles, to be ex
act.
In a quiet voice that contrasted
with the garish surroundings,
Akiyoshi explained that her march
ing tadpoles are not the sort that
breathe, swim or even turn into
daddy or mommy frogs. Rather,
tadpoles is the literal translation of
the Japanese word for musical
notes, otamajakushi.
But using the word march in con
nection with Akiyoshi's
otamajakushi does not do justice to
the electrifying sounds produced.
Instead of rigid marches, the audi
ence was treated to exciting upbeat
swing tunes, impressionistic
modern compositions and sensitive
ballads.
The Toshiko Akiyoshi Jazz Or
chestra is well-known in the Asian
and American music communities.
The band's innovative style, com
bining Eastern and Western musical
elements, has earned them first
place in the reader polls of several

national jazz magazines, among
them Downbeat.
The opening chart, "Strive for
Jive," showed the audience the rea
son for such popularity. Lyrical
melodic phrases emphasized by
bass trombone and other brass
shots initiated a long night of foot
stomping and head bopping.
The band seems to have largely
eliminated the stiffness and for
mality that seems to arise from col
lecting so many great soloists in
one band. Akiyoshi's arrangements
seem to paradoxically synchronize
all players while creating the illusion
that each is grooving along in a
private bop world.
For all this praise however, the
band was not completely coor
dinated due to the astonishing in
sensitivity of the trumpet section.
In several pieces, the trumpets lost
all sense of reasonable dynamic
level, making the audience strain to
hear fantastic saxophone and
trombone solo work.
Still, the upbeat sections of all
charts had many fans oscillating in
their chairs. If the audience wasn't
known to be under the influence of
some heavy blues, a neurologist
would have had a field day.

After "Strive for Jive," many
notable charts were played. The
evening's most exciting solo work
came from lead tenor player Lew
Tabackin, who is Akiyoshi's hus
band.
In "Chasing After Love," it was
easy to see the musical communica
tion taking place between husband
and wife. A spirited Tabackin solo
occupied eight breathtaking
minutes of this composition. His
heavy metal bebop style,
punctuated by an innovative use of
wails, grunts and overtones, stim
ulated and delighted the audience.
Another highlight of the evening
was "Notorious Tourist From the
East." The composition of
"Notorious Tourist" was provoked
by incidents that occurred when
Akiyoshi and her sister visited
Tijuana. There they found that an
invasion of Japanese tourists had
led Mexicans to treat the Japanese
as they do Americans.
Another of Akiyoshi's cultural
commentaries was expressed in a
suite entitled "Two Faces of a Na
tion." The composer, who did not
speak much about other charts, ex
plained that she was touched by the
warmth and gentleness of German
women in places like Frieburg,
Regensburg and Mayen.
The paradox of how this ap
parently carefree nation could have
been party to the tragic inhumanity
of the Holocaust was expressed ef
fectively by the use of Japanese noh
voices (a sort of painful moaning to

those who do not comprehend the
Japanese language). They added a
haunting, eerie feel to the listener's
experience.
When swing charts like "Opus
Zero" came along, many in the audi
ence wished a dance floor had been
set up. Staff at the Music Hall in
formed me that for some engage
ments, a dance floor is in fact ar
ranged, but we had to be content
with muscle spasms in our seats.
One of the really intriguing prop
erties of the Great American Music
Hall is the cosmopolitan crowd.
There were many in all age groups
— from late teens to well past re
tirement. Minors are welcome at
the club, although they request that
no children under six attend for
reasons of noise.
There were some opportunities
to rap with others at nearby tables,
but people seemed to be at the club
for the music, rather than to meet
others.
Another property, albeit a less
tasteful one, is the Music Hall's
decor. It can only be described as
"sleazy" baroque. In this fantasti
cally overdecorated building, gig
gling gold cherubim preside over
eloquent marble colonnades. This is
the perfect club to hang out at if you
haven't enough cash to buy many
drinks. With the effect of this decor,
you needn't guzzle screwdrivers to
feel dizzy.
One of the buildings in old San
Francisco to be rebuilt after the

1905 earthquake, the Music Hall is
now host to an eclectic group of
jazz, rock and blues artists.
Things weren't always this way
however. According to sound and
lighting technicians, conversation
with old timers reveals a seedy his
tory at 859 O'Farrell.
The original establishment went

by the name of Bonzo's Cafe and
was described as "a dancing spot
where men took women who
weren't their wives.''
Overall, the Great American
Music Hall is a great place to catch
some jazz or blues, and a refresh
ing, if tastelessly decorated, change
from the usual musical forums.


Toshiko Akiyoshi Jazz Orchestra merges Eastern and Western
influences into innovative jazz in its new album, "March of the
Tadpoles." The group appeared at the Great American Music
Hall in San Francisco Sunday.
