Rating scale: one to five stars,
with five being the best

First of all, welcome back. We at
the Institute d' Picks d' KZSU hope
you enjoyed your summer. Now on
with the show. Roll 'em.
You might have noticed upon
turning on your stereo that the
Stanford experience is now enor
mously incomplete. The Quake,
that bastion of progressive rock for
the '80s, is gone, replaced by
KKCY, The City. If you're tired of
boycotting the Coffee House and
Hewlett-Packard, boycott The City
for a while. Ahhh, activism.
Anyway, the void created by this
situation has left we pickers in an
incredibly powerful position. Like it
or not, it's just us and KZSU for you
semi-alternative types of guys and
gals. We hope to live up to our new
found responsibility. But we prob
ably won't.
So anyway, onto the summer
recap. (Or, what to read if you
couldn't get MTV.)
Orchestral Manoevres in the
Dark — "Crush"
Yet another album by the ever
so-inventive OMD, pioneers of art
to which one can dance. The group
has veered somewhat from its jour
ney to commercial success which
began with "Junk Culture," instead
concentrating on a diversity of style

and sound that makes its albums
much more fun and interesting to
listen to. Nevertheless, the band
managed to get "So In Love" onto
mass radio.
Oh, well. But even the over
success of an otherwise good single
has not diminished OMD's capacity
for turning unconventional, uncon
nected sounds and technological
wizardry into very cool music. Best
yet, Crush's catchy melodies are
the same way-too-simple-to-be-

true chords that any first year
pianist could play. The talent that
makes normal guys, sounds and
structures into special music is still
there, blowing away the
overdressed, multicolored-hair,
sci-fi, new wave set hands down. If
progressive rock ever makes it to
mainstream radio without losing all

of its kick, it'll be because of bands
like this.
Sting — "The Dream of the
Blue Turtles"
Actually, even other Bay Area
stations have got around to over
playing at least two singles off this.
Surprise, surprise. Those radio sta
tions always could pick a longshot.
It's okay, though, the rest of us can
listen without worry because
Sting's first "solo" project is tons
better than the average superstar's
ego project (examples: Mick Jag
ger, Roger Daltrey, David Lee
Roth).
While Sting has written a whole
slew of the same Police-type songs,
they're arranged jazzily and played
by the tightest bunch of backing
musicians outside of New South
Wales.
Lyrics are as intelligent and
thought provoking as always, and

Sting's vocals are better than ever.
Song styles range from the jazz-pop
of "Shadows" to the reggae-pop of
"Seventh Wave" to the pop-pop of
"Fortress." The group covers them
all with professionalism and
elegance. Face it — there's simply
nothing wrong with this album.
Talking Heads — "Little
Creatures"
☆☆☆☆
Time for the analogy of the
week. Talking Heads went from
semi-basic rock arrangements to
the complex post-African arrange
ments that made them famous, and
now seem to be going back. So
we'd have to call this album Talking
Heads Classic.
The group has returned some
what to their earlier stripped-down
format, discarding the wild in
strumental embellishments that
characterized New Talking Heads.
Fans of the old Heads seem to

prefer TH Classic for its ease of lis
tening and sense of complacence,
while new TH fans dislike the
pseudo-artsy lyrics and similarity
among songs. The group seems
content to enjoy both aspects of its
sound, having released a film which
successfully balances ample por
tions of each.
What the album lacks in adven
turousness is made up in its sense
of comfort and good musicianship
throughout. Overall, the group

seems happier, healthier and more
self-confident — a la Bowie's "Let's
Dance." But just as with Bowie,
what originally made the group so
unique was its quirky nervousness
and experimental nature; we don't
mind slowing down with the Talking
Heads, just as long as they don't
slow down for long.

The Untouchables — "Wild
Child"
The Untouchables are a hip Los
Angeles dance band with a loyal cult
following there. Their sound is
derived from the former Spe
cials/English Beat sound, with
enough of a mix of mod, rap and pop
to appeal to most anyone.
Though their (only) style does
get tiresome by the middle of the
album, it's still a collection of at
least five great singles and is
definitely recommended as Stan
ford's official Hip-'n'-Happenin'
Party Album '85-'B6.
There are two sets of Un
touchables here: the fast, driving,
dance-while-you-still-can Un
touchables, and the slower, reggae
accented, dance-because-it'd-be
fun Untouchables. Both are just fine
with us. Hey, most bands take 10
years to even perfect one style, let
alone two. (Let alone two that
people like.)
So don't get left behind. Dance
up a storm. There's no commercial
radio station anymore to push this
enough to make it popular. You're
on your own. Don't let us down.
— John Wallin
and Telford Work
