## Test Steroids, Not Cocaine 
### 
The recent cocaine trial in Pit
tsburgh, in which several major
league baseball players testified,
has again raised the issue of drug
use in sports.
According to Commissioner
Peter Ueberroth, baseball "has
suffered public humiliation" after
it was revealed that players like
Dale Berra, Keith Hernandez
and Joaquin Andujar regularly
purchased and used cocaine.
Ueberroth is pushing for vo
luntary drug testing among
major league players. Failure to
do so would mean "the start of a

decade in which baseball is
synonymous with drugs."
Several questions come with
this proposal:
• Should baseball be more con
cerned with the use of drugs like
amphetamines, which are
supposed to improve perfor
mance and benefit users, than
those like cocaine, which hinder
performance and benefit non
users?
• Is occasional, recreational use
of cocaine of more concern than
chronic abuse of legal drugs like
alcohol?
• Should athletes be singled out
for drug testing while other
professionals like doctors and
lawyers continue to use cocaine,
with probably a more detrimen
tal effect on society?
• Does drug testing invade
players' privacy?
Players have testified that
cocaine use has hurt their play.
Yet use of amphetamines like
"greenies" and "red juice" would
seem to be more of a threat to
the game. These are used to im
prove performance. If they do,
players who refrain from drug
use would seem to be at a dis
tinct disadvantage.
This is a case much like the
use of steroids in football, where
linemen have said they used
anabolic steroids to improve
their strength faster than they
could be only lifting weights.
The Olympic Games test ath
letes for use of these sub
stances. It seems that if baseball
has an interest in testing
players, testing for am
phetamines and steroids is more
justifiable than testing for
cocaine.
Cocaine is an illegal drug, so
when players are found to use
the drug it certainly tarnishes
their image. Yet, should recrea
tional use of cocaine that doesn't
affect a player's performance
concern baseball?
An analogy here: Babe Ruth,
the most famous player of his
time, was known to frequently
drink alcohol (though
sportswriters often covered for
his hangovers with stories of
how he had eaten too much).
During the 19205, alcohol was il
legal, yet no one spoke of how

Ruth's drug use tarnished the
game.
If cocaine is affecting a
player's performance, baseball
may have a legitimate interest in
his use. If his use of the drug is
not problematic or otherwise
noticeable, it is questionable
what interest is served in un
covering that use.
If baseball is concerned about
the players, drug use by players
in their private lives should not
cause as much concern as alco
hol abuse that spills over and af
fects on-field performance. Use
is not a problem; abuse is a prob
lem. ✓
Cocaine use has become
widespread in our society today,
especially among young profes
sionals. Baseball players are in
cluded in that category. It might
be argued that cocaine use by
surgeons and judges is more of a
concern than its use by a relative
handful of athletes.
Drug testing for baseball
players solely to detect the use
of cocaine is a bad idea. No inter
est of the sport is served, save
to shine its image as a "family
game."
Not that baseball should turn
its head to the problem. Players
should be informed about drug
use and its potential dangers.
Any player discovered suffering
from drug abuse should be
referred to treatment.
If a player's performace
deteriorates because of drug
use, his teammates and coaches
should be the first to notice. A
player's poor performance will
affect them most. Mandatory
testing is no substitute for indi
viduals looking out for each
other.
Testing for drugs that en
hance performance, though, may
be a necessary step. Research
into the extent of amphetamine
use needs to be undertaken.
That should be Ueberroth's next
task.

anabolic steroids to improve
their strength faster than they
could be only lifting weights.
The Olympic Games test ath
letes for use of these sub
stances. It seems that if baseball
has an interest in testing
players, testing for am
phetamines and steroids is more
justifiable than testing for
cocaine.
Cocaine is an illegal drug, so
when players are found to use
the drug it certainly tarnishes
their image. Yet, should recrea
tional use of cocaine that doesn't
affect a player's performance
concern baseball?
An analogy here: Babe Ruth,
the most famous player of his
time, was known to frequently
drink alcohol (though
sportswriters often covered for
his hangovers with stories of
how he had eaten too much).
During the 19205, alcohol was il
legal, yet no one spoke of how

Ruth's drug use tarnished the
game.
If cocaine is affecting a
player's performance, baseball
may have a legitimate interest in
his use. If his use of the drug is
not problematic or otherwise
noticeable, it is questionable
what interest is served in un
covering that use.
If baseball is concerned about
the players, drug use by players
in their private lives should not
cause as much concern as alco
hol abuse that spills over and af
fects on-field performance. Use
is not a problem; abuse is a prob
lem. ✓
Cocaine use has become
widespread in our society today,
especially among young profes
sionals. Baseball players are in
cluded in that category. It might
be argued that cocaine use by
surgeons and judges is more of a
concern than its use by a relative
handful of athletes.
Drug testing for baseball
players solely to detect the use
of cocaine is a bad idea. No inter
est of the sport is served, save
to shine its image as a "family
game."
Not that baseball should turn
its head to the problem. Players
should be informed about drug
use and its potential dangers.
Any player discovered suffering
from drug abuse should be
referred to treatment.
If a player's performace
deteriorates because of drug
use, his teammates and coaches
should be the first to notice. A
player's poor performance will
affect them most. Mandatory
testing is no substitute for indi
viduals looking out for each
other.
Testing for drugs that en
hance performance, though, may
be a necessary step. Research
into the extent of amphetamine
use needs to be undertaken.
That should be Ueberroth's next
task.

Looking ahead
Saturday's football game here
against Texas should be one for
those who like to see a lot of
points on the board. The Long
horns rolled for 433 yards, in
cluding 343 on the ground, in
defeating Missouri last week.
The Cardinal gave up 512 at
Oregon.
On the other side, the Card
inal ran and threw for 560 yards
last week."
