# Raiders Shuffle Quarterbacks
## 
### 
MANHATTAN BEACH (AP) â€” While things haven't
exactly gone as planned so far this year for Coach Tom
Flores of the Los Angeles Raiders, he made it clear
yesterday that he's not about to call it a season.
"There are 13 league games to go, we're not out of
anything yet," Flores said at his weekly meeting with
reporters. "But we have to bounce back.
"We're without our No. 1 quarterback (Jim
Plunkett). We're going to wait a few days to decide
whether there will be surgery. It's a tremendous blow
to us, but we have to go on and we will go on with
(quarterbacks) Marc Wilson and Rusty Hilger."
The right-handed Plunkett suffered a dislocated left
shoulder early in the fourth quarter of Sunday's 34-10
loss to the defending Super Bowl champion San Fran
cisco 49ers.
The setback was the second convincing loss in a row
for the Raiders, leaving them 1-2 entering this Sun
day's National Football League game at New England
against the Patriots, who are 2-1.
"This is an important week for us, obviously,"
Flores said. "We'd like to get back on the winning
track."
Plunkett, 37, underwent arthroscopic surgery Tues
day. Flores' mention of surgery was a reference to the
possibility that a major operation might be required on
Plunkett's shoulder.
Whether surgery is required or not, Flores left no

doubt that he didn't expect Plunkett to be available in
about six weeks, as had been predicted after Sunday's
game and repeated Monday and early Tuesday.
Dr. Robert Rosenfeld, who performed Tuesday's
arthroscopic surgery as a diagnostic measure, was
quoted in Wednesday's Los Angeles Herald Examiner
as saying it would probably be 10 weeks before
Plunkett is ready to play.
"Six weeks doesn't seem realistic," Flores said. "Jim
is in the hospital and will remain there until they make a
decision. The guy's in pain, he's very down. I think
we'll have a better feeling (if surgery will be necessary)
in a few days." Wilson, 28 and in his sixth profes
sional season, has had an up-and-down career since the
Raiders made him a first-round draft choice in 1980. He
started 10 games and played most of another after
Plunkett was injured last season.
Wilson was booed on several occasions last year and
booed again after replacing Plunkett Sunday.
"The pressure is always going to be on the quarter
back," Flores said. "There's no way you can get away
from that. He (Wilson) has got to be able to handle that.
He's been around long enough, he's had this challenge
before. He's got to face it, he's got no choice."
Flores called Hilger "a very promising rookie who
has excellent potential." Hilger was the Raiders' sixth
round draft choice this year.
