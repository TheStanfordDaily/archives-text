# Union Challenges Ueberroth
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — The Major
League Baseball Players Associa
tion said yesterday that Commis
sioner Peter Ueberroth "has yet to
supply any evidence to support his
claim" that the minor leagues are
virtually drug free because of his
drug-testing program.
Ueberroth, in a news conference
Tuesday, said he had asked all
major leaguers — in letters sent
through club ownership or
managers — to participate volun
tarily in a testing program next
season. And on NBC's "Today"
show yesterday, Ueberroth called
testing in the minors a deterrent to
drug use.
"Even before we started, the use
of drugs went down dramatically,"
Ueberroth said. "As soon as testing
was in all the minor leagues — and
we did it without publicity, inciden
tally — the use of drugs just vir
tually vanished. ... As soon as we
do that in the major leagues, the
same thing is going to happen.
"I made the proposal to the union
on May 8, 1985. It's the same pro
posal. And it worked in the minor
leagues," Ueberroth said. "I had
the power to put it in the minor
leagues, and it worked."
Don Fehr, the union's acting ex
ecutive director, responded Tues
day to Ueberroth's news confer
ence by saying the commissioner
was illegally trying to bypass the
union and negotiate directly with
the players.
In his letter, Ueberroth asked
the players to respond by tomor
row on whether they would submit
to urinalysis three times a year
starting with the 1986 season.
"It doesn't need to be unani
mous," Ueberroth said yesterday.

"I'm just saying let's stand up and
say that there's no more drugs in
baseball. And we'll have to prove it.
If we say it, it's one thing.
Secondly, we have to prove it."
Generally, the players' response
has been that they agree something
has to be done, but that the com
missioner should be working
through the union. The New York
Yankees, Los Angeles Dodgers,
Milwaukee Brewers, Atlanta
Braves and a number of other
teams refused to vote on Ueber
roth's idea.
"Our stand at the moment is that
we're not going to respond ... be
cause we are not aware of the cir
cumstances that surround the test
ing, the implications of it, the con
sequences of it," said Bruce

Benedict, the Braves' player repre
sentative.
Jury considers second trial
The second federal court jury in
as many weeks yesterday
deliberated the fate of a Pennsylva
nia man charged with selling
cocaine to major league baseball
players.
Robert "Rav" McCue, 38, of sub
urban Upper St. Clair, former con
troller for the Easter Seal Society
of Allegheny County and a part
time tavern disc jockey, awaited
word from a U.S. District Court
jury of 10 women and two men on
13 federal charges of dealing
cocaine.
The key witnesses against

McCue were former Pittsburgh
Pirates infielder Dale Berra, son of
Hall of Famer Yogi Berra now with
the New York Yankees, and former
Pirates outfielder John Milner, now
retired in suburban Pittsburgh.
Berra and Milner, who both ad
mitted using cocaine while with the
Pirates, testified under federal
grants of immunity.
Berra said he purchased cocaine
from McCue on four occasions, and
Milner said he bought the narcotic
from McCue on nine occasions be
tween June 1983 and January 1985.
Cohill said such witnesses could
be considered "competant," but
their "testimony must be examined
with greater care."
He said the jury must decide if
the witnesses' testimony "may be
colored to further the witnesses'
own interests."
Seven major league players, in
cluding Berra and Milner, testified
against Curtis Strong, another
Philadelphia man convicted on drug
charges, during his highly
publicized, three-week trial on the
same floor of the U.S. Courthouse
in downtown Pittsburgh.
During the government's closing
arguments against McCue on Tues
day, Assistant U.S. Attorney Elliot
McLain said Berra and Milner
"acted shamefully" and "tainted
baseball" by frequently purchasing
and using drugs while playing for
the Pirates.
McCue's attorney, John Nick
oloff, questioned the players'
credibility in his closing argument.
McCue and Strong were among
seven Pennsylvania men indicted
May 31 by a federal grand jury in
vestigating drug use among major
league baseball players.


Peter Ueberroth has pointed to drugs as a "menace" to
baseball. Players, though, and their union, fear that his drug
testing proposal is a menace to collective bargaining.
