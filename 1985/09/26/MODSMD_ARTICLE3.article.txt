# No Bomb Charges Sought
## 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
Stanford police said Tuesday they do not plan
to press criminal charges against a student who
said he left explosives on a Mirrielees patio over
the summer.
On Sunday, a Mirrielees resident found the
components necessary to build a bomb strewn
about a patio at the campus residence, prompt
ing an evacuation of a small area for two hours.
Police initially feared that the explosives may
have been left with malicious intent, but Tuesday
night Joseph Breckenridge, an undergraduate
majoring in economics, told police that he simply
forgot about the explosives after taking them to
Mirrielees to show friends, according to a police
spokesman.
Breckenridge obtained the explosives — a
gel-like substance, blasting caps, and a detonator

— while working for an oil exploration firm in
Wyoming and Utah during fall quarter last year,
according to Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Niemeyer said his department will check with
federal authorities about the legality of
transporting explosives across state lines and
will then turn the case over to the dean of stu
dent affairs.
Keeping explosives in a campus residence is a
violation of University policy.
Niemeyer said criminal charges against Breck
enridge are unlikely because "There are no
reasons to believe he had anything untoward in
mind." Breckenridge has no criminal record,
Niemeyer said.
Breckenridge reported to police after reading
newspaper accounts of the discovery of the ex
plosive. "He basically came forward to make a
statement to clear up the matter," Niemeyer
said.
Breckenridge was unavailable for comment.
