Slush Fund Bankrolled Sinking
PARIS — The sinking of Greenpeace's flagship by the French se
cret service (DGSE) was financed with funds provided by the prime
minister's office, informed sources said yesterday.
As it unravels details of the July 10 attack on the Rainbow Warrior
in New Zealand's Auckland harbor from leaks provided by DGSE in
siders, the French press has focused attention on how Operation
Greenpeace, which reportedly cost around two million francs
($250,000), was financed.
The fund is said to involve "DGSE special funds," automatically
paid on a monthly basis to the DGSE to complement its normal
credits, which are drawn from the Defense Ministry budget, as well
as "government special funds" made available to the secret service
for what are known as "occasional spending."
Sources close to the prime minister's office said that in the case of
Operation Greenpeace, "government special funds" were used, and
they outlined the process of negotiation involved.
DGSE chief Adm. Pierre Lacoste, who was fired last week, sent a
request for the funds along with an outline of the to Presi
dent Francois Mitterrand's military adviser, who was then Gen. Jean
Saulnier.
Saulnier was quoted as saying that he endorsed the operation,
which in his words, was solely "aimed at increasing intelligence
gathering" on the ecologist group's activities.
Analysts said the key question was whether top political decision
makers in the presidential Elysee Palace and the prime minister's of
fice intervened in the decision or whether it was left to lower-ranking
technocrats.
Sources at the presidential palace refused to comment on the
issue, and aides of former French premiers said this was a taboo
question.
On Sunday, Fabius admitted that DGSE agents acting under or
ders blew up the Rainbow Warrior in Auckland as it prepared to lead
a protest flotilla into France's nuclear testing site at Mururoa.
Rome Bomb Hits British Office
ROME — A time bomb exploded in a British Airways office in
downtown Rome yesterday, shattering windows within hundreds of
yards and injuring at least 15 persons, some of them seriously, police
said.
They said a Palestinian from a refugee camp in Beirut was ar
rested immediately after the attack, the second terrorist bombing in
downtown Rome in 10 days.
On Sept. 16, 39 persons were injured when three grenades burst
in a crowded street cafe in Rome's Via Veneto. The Moslem
Socialists Organisation in Beirut claimed responsibility and said it
would carry out other attacks in Italy, Britain and Spain.
After yesterday's attack, 15 Italians were treated in three local
hospitals. One of them, Raffaella Leopardo, 33, was in critical condi
tion with severe leg burns, a police spokesman said.
Several cars were damaged by the blast, which occurred on Via
Bissolati, only a few hundred yards from the Cafe de Paris, the site
of the grenade attack ten days ago.
In a letter claiming responsibility for the cafe attack, the Moslem
Socialists Organization, a group believed responsible for attacks in
Beirut and Madrid, had called Rome a center of U.S. and Zionist in
telligence activities.
The spokesman did not connect yesterday's bombing with the ear
lier attack.
Palestinians Raid Israeli Yacht
NICOSIA, Cyprus — Three gunmen overpowered a yacht at a
Larnaca marina in southern Cyprus yesterday and killed its three Is
raeli occupants before surrendering to authorities, police said.
The attackers, two of them Palestinians, seized the boat with a
round of gunfire in the early morning hours and took the Israelis
hostage, demanding the release of about 20 Palestinians, police said.
The Palestinians were arrested by the Israeli navy last month
aboard the chartered Cypriot yacht Gada while sailing toward the
Lebanese city of Sidon. Israeli authorities said the guerrillas had
planned terrorist attacks against Israeli targets.
Cypriot police sealed off the harbor after gunfire was heard and
began 10-hour negotiations with the gunmen from behind boats
moored nearby.
The Palestinians, armed with Soviet-made Kalishnikov rifles, pis
tols and hand grenades, shot the woman to death and then killed the
two men after holding them hostage.
The gunmen, whose identities were unknown, named a deadline
of 9 a.m. and demanded to be taken to Larnaca airport and flown to
an unknown destination in exchange for the release of the Israeli
men.
The Cypriot Foreign Ministry tried to contact Palestine Liberation
Organization leader Yasser Arafat, but a PLO representative said
the gunmen were not members of the PLO and refused a request to
mediate.
Egypt's ambassador to Cyprus, Mahmoud Kamal Rifaat, tried in
vain to negotiate with the gunmen. The two Palestinians demanded
to speak to the French ambassador, but he was not on the island.
As the gunmens' demands were still unmet two hours after the
deadline expired, the attackers shot the two hostages dead and sur
rendered about three hours later.
Hong Kong Holding Elections
HONG KONG — Today the people of Hong Kong will choose, for
the first time, 24 of the 56 members of the colony's Legislative
Council. The election is meant to be the beginning step in a gradual
transition toward representative government.
The balloting will be held exactly one year after the day, on Sept.
26, 1984, when British and Chinese officials initialed an agreement
paving the way for the return of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty
in 1997. In it, China made the vague promise that for 50 years after
1997, Hong Kong's government "shall enjoy a high degree of
autonomy."
On the one hand, Hong Kong is belatedly following the path of
revolution blazed by the American colonies in 1776. Its increasingly
affluent Chinese middle-class is beginning to take over political
power from Britain. Colonial government is giving way to self-rule.
On the other hand, Hong Kong is also witnessing the first stirrings
of a different sort of political revolution, the kind experienced by
China itself in 1949. Officials of the Chinese Communist Party are
moving into Hong Kong and trying to learn as much about it as they
can, preparing for the day, 12 years from now, when Hong Kong will
be under the control of China.

hospitals. One of them, Raffaella Leopardo, 33, was in critical condi
tion with severe leg burns, a police spokesman said.
Several cars were damaged by the blast, which occurred on Via
Bissolati, only a few hundred yards from the Cafe de Paris, the site
of the grenade attack ten days ago.
In a letter claiming responsibility for the cafe attack, the Moslem
Socialists Organization, a group believed responsible for attacks in
Beirut and Madrid, had called Rome a center of U.S. and Zionist in
telligence activities.
The spokesman did not connect yesterday's bombing with the ear
lier attack.
Palestinians Raid Israeli Yacht
NICOSIA, Cyprus — Three gunmen overpowered a yacht at a
Larnaca marina in southern Cyprus yesterday and killed its three Is
raeli occupants before surrendering to authorities, police said.
The attackers, two of them Palestinians, seized the boat with a
round of gunfire in the early morning hours and took the Israelis
hostage, demanding the release of about 20 Palestinians, police said.
The Palestinians were arrested by the Israeli navy last month
aboard the chartered Cypriot yacht Gada while sailing toward the
Lebanese city of Sidon. Israeli authorities said the guerrillas had
planned terrorist attacks against Israeli targets.
Cypriot police sealed off the harbor after gunfire was heard and
began 10-hour negotiations with the gunmen from behind boats
moored nearby.
The Palestinians, armed with Soviet-made Kalishnikov rifles, pis
tols and hand grenades, shot the woman to death and then killed the
two men after holding them hostage.
The gunmen, whose identities were unknown, named a deadline
of 9 a.m. and demanded to be taken to Larnaca airport and flown to
an unknown destination in exchange for the release of the Israeli
men.
The Cypriot Foreign Ministry tried to contact Palestine Liberation
Organization leader Yasser Arafat, but a PLO representative said
the gunmen were not members of the PLO and refused a request to
mediate.
Egypt's ambassador to Cyprus, Mahmoud Kamal Rifaat, tried in
vain to negotiate with the gunmen. The two Palestinians demanded
to speak to the French ambassador, but he was not on the island.
As the gunmens' demands were still unmet two hours after the
deadline expired, the attackers shot the two hostages dead and sur
rendered about three hours later.
Hong Kong Holding Elections
HONG KONG — Today the people of Hong Kong will choose, for
the first time, 24 of the 56 members of the colony's Legislative
Council. The election is meant to be the beginning step in a gradual
transition toward representative government.
The balloting will be held exactly one year after the day, on Sept.
26, 1984, when British and Chinese officials initialed an agreement
paving the way for the return of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty
in 1997. In it, China made the vague promise that for 50 years after
1997, Hong Kong's government "shall enjoy a high degree of
autonomy."
On the one hand, Hong Kong is belatedly following the path of
revolution blazed by the American colonies in 1776. Its increasingly
affluent Chinese middle-class is beginning to take over political
power from Britain. Colonial government is giving way to self-rule.
On the other hand, Hong Kong is also witnessing the first stirrings
of a different sort of political revolution, the kind experienced by
China itself in 1949. Officials of the Chinese Communist Party are
moving into Hong Kong and trying to learn as much about it as they
can, preparing for the day, 12 years from now, when Hong Kong will
be under the control of China.
Slush Fund Bankrolled Sinking
PARIS — The sinking of Greenpeace's flagship by the French se
cret service (DGSE) was financed with funds provided by the prime
minister's office, informed sources said yesterday.
As it unravels details of the July 10 attack on the Rainbow Warrior
in New Zealand's Auckland harbor from leaks provided by DGSE in
siders, the French press has focused attention on how Operation
Greenpeace, which reportedly cost around two million francs
($250,000), was financed.
The fund is said to involve "DGSE special funds," automatically
paid on a monthly basis to the DGSE to complement its normal
credits, which are drawn from the Defense Ministry budget, as well
as "government special funds" made available to the secret service
for what are known as "occasional spending."
Sources close to the prime minister's office said that in the case of
Operation Greenpeace, "government special funds" were used, and
they outlined the process of negotiation involved.
DGSE chief Adm. Pierre Lacoste, who was fired last week, sent a
request for the funds along with an outline of the to Presi
dent Francois Mitterrand's military adviser, who was then Gen. Jean
Saulnier.
Saulnier was quoted as saying that he endorsed the operation,
which in his words, was solely "aimed at increasing intelligence
gathering" on the ecologist group's activities.
Analysts said the key question was whether top political decision
makers in the presidential Elysee Palace and the prime minister's of
fice intervened in the decision or whether it was left to lower-ranking
technocrats.
Sources at the presidential palace refused to comment on the
issue, and aides of former French premiers said this was a taboo
question.
On Sunday, Fabius admitted that DGSE agents acting under or
ders blew up the Rainbow Warrior in Auckland as it prepared to lead
a protest flotilla into France's nuclear testing site at Mururoa.
Rome Bomb Hits British Office
ROME — A time bomb exploded in a British Airways office in
downtown Rome yesterday, shattering windows within hundreds of
yards and injuring at least 15 persons, some of them seriously, police
said.
They said a Palestinian from a refugee camp in Beirut was ar
rested immediately after the attack, the second terrorist bombing in
downtown Rome in 10 days.
On Sept. 16, 39 persons were injured when three grenades burst
in a crowded street cafe in Rome's Via Veneto. The Moslem
Socialists Organisation in Beirut claimed responsibility and said it
would carry out other attacks in Italy, Britain and Spain.
After yesterday's attack, 15 Italians were treated in three local
hospitals. One of them, Raffaella Leopardo, 33, was in critical condi
tion with severe leg burns, a police spokesman said.
