### 
UNITED NATIONS â€” George Shultz and
Eduard Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign mini
ster; met for more than four hours yesterday,
but the secretary of state said they did not reach
agreement on any of the issues discussed.
Both had indicated they were optimistic
before the meeting.
The two leaders met for four hours and 20
minutes at the Soviet U.N. Mission. It was the
first of several sessions regarded as crucial to a
successful summit Nov. 19-20 in Geneva, Swit
zerland, between President Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
Shultz said the Soviets did not reveal any new
proposal that could break the impasse in the
arms control talks now under way in Geneva. He
said the discussion focused on "security issues,
most particularly those being discussed by our
negotiators in Geneva.
"We agreed we were looking for points of con
tact in our positions and areas of common under
standing. We did not reach an agreement on any
of these items. But we certainly did discuss each
other's positions with great care," Shultz told
reporters.
He said the talks had been "most worthwhile"
and had been conducted in an "easy and frank at
mosphere.
"There was no particular new proposals put
on the table," he said.
Shevardnadze spoke to reporters after Shultz
and said he agreed with the secretary's assess

ment of the talks. "It was an interesting, frank
and useful meeting," he said.
The Soviet foreign minister noted that he will
meet Reagan in Washington tomorrow. He is ex
pected to see Shultz again on Saturday.
"There are quite a lot of things to do" before
the November summit, Shevardnadze said. He
declined to take any questions from reporters.
While the two apparently did not agree on any
outstanding issues, they dearly made an effort to
emphasize that they got along well in the talks,

which ran 20 minutes longer than scheduled.
They shook hands and smiled broadly at one
another, both before and after stepping to
microphones on the sidewalk in front of the mis
sion; and each listened patiently as the other ad
dressed reporters.
Before the discussion, Shevardnadze told
Shultz, "I'm sorry," for not attending a U.N.
General Assembly meeting Monday where the
U.S. secretary of state spoke. The Soviet
foreign minister said his schedule was too full.
