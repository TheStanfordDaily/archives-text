# Hurricane Menaces Atlantic Coast
## 
### 
Hurricane Gloria, at times pack
ing winds of more than 150 mph,
yesterday turned into the mightiest
storm tracked across the open At
lantic in more than 30 years. The
storm was moving northwest on a
path that could take it across Cape
Hatteras, N.C., or aim it toward
eastern Long Island and the New
England states of Rhode Island and
Massachusetts.
Last night, Gloria measured 300
miles across and was located about
500 miles south-southeast of Cape
Hatteras, moving at 15 mph and
forcing the evacuation of some is
lands along North Carolina's Outer
Banks.
In the Norfolk, Va., area, all
Navy ships were ordered to leave
for safe anchorages in the
Chesapeake Bay or at sea. Navy
pilots made plans to fly aircraft to
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in
Dayton, Ohio, for refuge, officials
said.
A hurricane watch was posted
from Charleston, S.C., to Cape
Henry, Va., although forecasters
said they expect Gloria to turn to

the northeast and possibly bring
Gloria ashore in New England.
"Anyone who lives along the
East Coast should pay close atten
tion to this storm," said Neil Frank,
director of the National Hurricane
Center outside Miami. "This is a
dangerous hurricane and people
from the Carolinas to New England
should closely monitor the progress
of this storm."
Mark Zimmer, of the National
Hurricane Center, rated Gloria a

"strong" Category 4 storm based
on a scale* of 1 to 5; for a brief time
Wednesday morning, Gloria
reached winds of 156 mph that put
it in Category 5.
"The only Category 5 storms to
hit the United States in this century
were Camille in 1969 and the 1935
hurricane that tore up the Florida
Keys so bad they had to rebuild the
railroad," Zimmer said. "What we
want to emphasize about Gloria is
that it's a very dangerous hur
ricane, regardless of whether it's a
4 or a 5.
"The winds may vary from 145 to
155 miles an hour but if you get hit
with those winds you're not going
to notice the difference," he said.
Hurricane watchers said Hur
ricane Gloria had a large, well
defined eye at least 12 miles across
that suggested it carried stronger
and more damaging winds than
most tropical storms.
One weather expert pointed out
that Gloria has been gathering
strength in the warm waters of the
south Atlantic for a longer period
than most tropical storms.

Forecasters were reluctant last
night to predict where Gloria would
touch land or what direction the
storm would take. Although warn
ings for the Bahamas were lifted at
noon, forecasters said Hurricane
Gloria did not make an expected
turn to the northeast, making their
job of predicting that turn more dif
ficult than it already was.
"This storm is now embedded in
the prevailing steering winds that
dominate the East Coast this time
of year," said Richard Anthes of the
National Center for Atmospheric
Research and author of a book on
hurricanes.
"Those steering winds are south
to southwest, which means they
should soon carry the storm on a
north-to-northeast path that takes
it very close to the coastal states of
New England," he said.
Anthes said Gloria comes as
something of a surprise to hur
ricane watchers, who have seen
hurricanes move away from the At
lantic states to the states bordering
the Gulf of Mexico.
