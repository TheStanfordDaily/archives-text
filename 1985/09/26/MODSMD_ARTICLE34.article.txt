Bennett Assails
Bilingual Education
WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of Edu
cation William Bennett said the government's
bilingual education program has failed and
should be changed to put more emphasis on
teaching foreign students English.
Schools have been spending too much time
and too many resources to teach in Spanish
and other foreign languages, he said in a
speech prepared for delivery today in New
York City before the Association for a Better
New York. The text was made available in ad
vance.
Bennett charged that "after sound begin
nings" in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act of
1965, the federal policies governing bilingual
education "went astray. . . .Too many children

have failed to become fluent in English."
Federal civil rights officials in the 1970s
began pressuring school districts to teach stu
dents with limited English in their native
tongue and until 1984 forbade schools from
using the funds for classes that relied soley on
intensive English instruction.
"After 17 years of federal involvement, and
after $1.7 billion of federal funding, we have no
evidence that the children whom we sought to
help that the children who deserve our help —
have benefited," Bennett said.
9 Klansmen Arrested
WASHINGTON — Nine Ku Klux Klan
members have been charged in a year-long
spree of cross burnings and shooting incidents
aimed at both blacks and whites in North
Carolina, federal authorities said yesterday.

Among those named in the 20-count indict
ment, issued by a federal grand jury in Ashe
ville, N.C., were Jerry Suits and his wife,
Mary, the .titan and queen kleagle of the white
supremacist group's Iredell County, N.C.,
branch, and Tony Earp, leader of the klan in
Alexander County, N.C.
Stocks Continue Drop
NEW YORK — Stocks took their cue from
one of the market's bellweather issues, IBM,
and skidded to another broad loss yesterday.
Other technology stocks also tumbled, as
did paper, oil, telephone, drug and insurance
stocks.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
dropped 9.07 to 1,312.05, and the loss would
have been worse except that one of its compo
nents, General Foods, extended its takeover
related rally.
