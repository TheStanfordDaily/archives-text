Defector in San Jose
SAN JOSE — A leading Czechoslovakian
sports scientist who defected with the help of
U.S. Olympic hammer thrower Ed Burke
arrived here with his family yesterday night,
saying "America promises me a possibility to
better use my abilities."
Ladislav Pataki, 38, his wife Gisela, 36, and
their daughter, Noemi, 16, landed here after
flying from Rome, where U.S. Embassy offi
cials gave him the go-ahead to come to the
United States.
Pataki, who developed scientific training
programs for track and field athletes, will stay
with another Czechoslovakian defector, Jena
Hubacz, in her Almaden Valley home for a
short time. The family will then move to an
anonymously donated townhouse in Los
Gatos, near Burke's home.

Pataki said he decided to come to America
three years ago because "American promises
me a possibility to better use my abilities and
those of my daughter and my wife ... If I
work hard here, and I learn, I will be a suc
cess."
Burke said Pataki is writing a book on his
ideas on athletic training, and added that he ex
pects Pataki will help America's Olympic ef
forts.
Lottery Start Foiled
LOS ANGELES — Plans for a glitzy,
daylong kickoff celebration Oct. 3 of the na
tion's biggest lottery — featuring everything
from Chinese lion dancers to Steve Allen —
were upstaged by a renegade San Francisco
grocer yesterday, who defied regulations and
sold more than 1,500 instant "scratch-off' tick-

ets before California officials revoked his
license.
"I broke the rules. ... I love it. ... I feel
30 years younger," said crusty market owner
Steve Stephan, 50, operator of Smitty's Mar
ket.
"I'm concerned that someone didn't follow
the rules which we made very clear to all of the
retailers," said lottery director Mark Michalko.
"We at the lottery had some concerns that
some might try to sell out of schedule, but we
made it clear that there would have to be some
penalties."
Because of the gun-jumping, an expensive,
four-city opening day extravaganza repleat
with marching bands, jugglers, mimes, uni
cyclists, fireworks and a laser show now will
have to celebrate the second day of ticket
sales in the state, "at least at that location," la
mented Michalko.
