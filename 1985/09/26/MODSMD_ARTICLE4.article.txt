There will be "no more splinters"
for the spectators in the Stanford
Stadium, according to Andy Geiger,
Stanford athletic director.
This summer, 9,000 aluminum
bleachers replaced the old wooden
ones located underneath the press
box on the north side.
"It's just part of a whole series of
changes to take place over the next
10 to 12 years," said Geiger. By
periodically converting the bleac
hers, the entire stadium, which
holds over 85,000 people, will
eventually have aluminum seats.
Other improvements made to the
stadium this summer include a new

surface for the track around the
field and a new sound system.
Finances for all these changes
come from interest earned on the
Sydney C. De Guerre Fund, a gift
of over $1 million made to the Uni
versity in 1972. The fund stipulates
that it be used only on improve
ments for existing major sports
facilities.
During the 63 years the stadium
has existed, the wooden benches
have been replaced as needed, but
"wood wears out," said Geiger.
With wooden benches soon to be
a thing of the past, Kevin Payne, a
senior in applied earth sciences and
Stanford football team member,
hopes to see "more people come to
root us on."
