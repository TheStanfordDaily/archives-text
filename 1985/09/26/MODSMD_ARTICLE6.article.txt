# 'The Zoo' Aims To Attract Students
## 
### JOYA WESLEY Senior staff writer 
"This is distributed control," says The Wreck,
a KZSU disc jockey.
This can also be called chaos if you're a dis
satisfied KZSU listener.
But this is about to change.
Prior to the assumption of power by KZSU's
current management, the number one listener
complaint was a lack of consistency. Listeners
grumbled because they never knew what to ex
pect "The Zoo" to play from one hour to the
next. Their response to the situation was to
switch the dial to more predictable radio sta
tions.
The result has been a very small KZSU lis
tenership. Although there are no demographic
reports with the exact size of the audience, staff
ers half-jokingly place it at about 20 diehards.
To combat its bad reputation and subsequent
lack of popularity, KZSU is now focusing its ef
forts on "tightening up its format," according to
Station Manager Laura Hernandez.
"We're going to have a certain genre of music
offered across the board at certain times of the
day," said Hernandez.
WTiat this means is that the station will play
only one type of music during prescribed time
blocks. For example, from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m.
every day, KZSU will play jazz only.

This way, according to DJ John Hamilton, a lis
tener will know that if she turns her radio to
KZSU at 9:35 in the morning, she will hear jazz,
not reggae, not classical, not mainstream or any
of the other types of music the station offers
during different time blocks.
In addition to the new, more structured for
mat, KZSU will continue to offer such features
as Stanford game broadcasts (its most popular
feature), The Farm Report, Zoo Review, Music
Meals and Palo Alto City Council meetings.
The station will also continue to cater to its
special interests such as Grateful Dead fans
who, incidentally, contributed "a dispropor
tionate amount" of money to last year's first

KZSU fund-raiser.
A new special interest is the group of KQAK
listeners who suddenly found themselves with
out a radio station in July. The Wreck, who
already played "Quake"-style, now calls his
radio show "SPQR," which stands for Stanford
Post Quake Radio.
They hope this combination of efforts will
succeed in building a larger Stanford audience for
KZSU.
Although KZSU claims to have listeners as far
away as San Francisco, they are few and far be
tween.
This format restructuring will also change the
show selection policy. Formerly, seniority was
the determining factor.
DJs who had been with the station the longest
could pretty much choose the shows they
wanted. Now, DJs will be assigned time slots ac
cording to what they're willing to play.
Although DJs will no longer have a free choice
of time slots, they will still have considerable
freedom during their shifts.
There are relatively few things a DJ must do
during his or her show. Among these are two
public service announcements per hour and the
legal identification, "KZSU Stanford," at the
beginning of each hour.
To get records from record companies, DJs
must also keep a playlist that shows that at least

three new cuts are being played
each hour. They send these lists to
record companies that in turn send
new records.
Outside of these musts, DJs are
primarily concerned with what goes
out over the air.
Such things as foul language can

cause the station to lose its license,
so the management has to be care
ful about who it puts on the air.
The first Wednesday of every
quarter the station holds an organi
zational meeting to recruit new
people. Usually, there are plenty of
prospective DJs, but discouragingly
few people volunteer to do the
other jobs necessary that keep the
station going. Other positions
available are news and

sportscasters, news writers and
production people whose jobs in
clude making public service tapes
and other recorded broadcast ma
terial.
Since there are so few of these
"other people" and even fewer
around at any one time, a DJ's time
on the air can become lonely.
The Wreck summed it up in a
response to a telephone call.
"No . . . there's nobody here,"

he said. "There's never anybody
here."
This emptiness contributes to
the desolation (perhaps too strong
a word) of the station's basement
facilities beneath Memorial
Auditorium.
Many different elements help
create a special sort of hole-in-the
ground atmosphere here: Concrete
floors that someone has tried to
warm with mis-matched, assorted
rugs. Also, gray concrete walls in
terspersed with noise-muffling cork
and sound-proof glass.
The facilities consist of two
studios, a conference room for in
terviews, a production room, a
news room, an engineering depart
ment and various other nooks and
crannies.
But last year's $60,000 ASSU fee
assessment will not improve the
facilities: That money is earmarked
for new equipment.
The first thing to go will be the
board in the main studio that looks
like something from a '50s movie.
Though it is old, it still works ex

cept for one unpredictable cueing
button, according to The Wreck.
Chief Engineer Mark Lawrence,
who is alleged to have "built the
station," has the responsibility of
repairing any equipment that stops
functioning properly.
Despite the solitude and the hec
tic nature of controlling all the
details involved in broadcasting a
radio show which makes The Wreck
such a wreck, DJ is still the most
sought after position.
This is not because an abundance
of Stanford students plan such
careers, but because of the glamour
of the position.
Few KZSU staff people work
there for experience pertinent to
their future careers. The Wreck,
for example, is an electrical engi
neering major.

"I do this for attention," he said
frankly.
"Most of the people are down
here because they love music,"
Hernandez said. In contrast, some
college stations, such as WHUR at
Howard University, enjoy a great
deal of popularity.
WHUR's nightly 7 p.m.-12 a.m.
show, "Quiet Storm," dominates
the airwaves in all of Washington,
D.C. Quiet Storm DJ Melvin
Lindsey received a $1 million dollar
contract to take his show to station
WKYS, according to Stanford fresh
man Kevin Anderson.
KZSU Program Director Tony
James expressed optimism about
the station's plan.
"Hopefully this will make the sta
tion more responsive to the Stan
ford community," he said.
