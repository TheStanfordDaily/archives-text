# 'The Zoo' Aims To Attract Students

"This is distributed control," says The Wreck,
a KZSU disc jockey.
This can also be called chaos if you're a dis
satisfied KZSU listener.
But this is about to change.
Prior to the assumption of power by KZSU's
current management, the number one listener
complaint was a lack of consistency. Listeners
grumbled because they never knew what to ex
pect "The Zoo" to play from one hour to the
next. Their response to the situation was to
switch the dial to more predictable radio sta
tions.
The result has been a very small KZSU lis
tenership. Although there are no demographic
reports with the exact size of the audience, staff
ers half-jokingly place it at about 20 diehards.
To combat its bad reputation and subsequent
lack of popularity, KZSU is now focusing its ef
forts on "tightening up its format," according to
Station Manager Laura Hernandez.
"We're going to have a certain genre of music
offered across the board at certain times of the
day," said Hernandez.
WTiat this means is that the station will play
only one type of music during prescribed time
blocks. For example, from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m.
every day, KZSU will play jazz only.

This way, according to DJ John Hamilton, a lis
tener will know that if she turns her radio to
KZSU at 9:35 in the morning, she will hear jazz,
not reggae, not classical, not mainstream or any
of the other types of music the station offers
during different time blocks.
In addition to the new, more structured for
mat, KZSU will continue to offer such features
as Stanford game broadcasts (its most popular
feature), The Farm Report, Zoo Review, Music
Meals and Palo Alto City Council meetings.
The station will also continue to cater to its
special interests such as Grateful Dead fans
who, incidentally, contributed "a dispropor
tionate amount" of money to last year's first

KZSU fund-raiser.
A new special interest is the group of KQAK
listeners who suddenly found themselves with
out a radio station in July. The Wreck, who
already played "Quake"-style, now calls his
radio show "SPQR," which stands for Stanford
Post Quake Radio.
They hope this combination of efforts will
succeed in building a larger Stanford audience for
KZSU.
Although KZSU claims to have listeners as far
away as San Francisco, they are few and far be
tween.
This format restructuring will also change the
show selection policy. Formerly, seniority was
the determining factor.
DJs who had been with the station the longest
could pretty much choose the shows they
wanted. Now, DJs will be assigned time slots ac
cording to what they're willing to play.
Although DJs will no longer have a free choice
of time slots, they will still have considerable
freedom during their shifts.
There are relatively few things a DJ must do
during his or her show. Among these are two
public service announcements per hour and the
legal identification, "KZSU Stanford," at the
beginning of each hour.
To get records from record companies, DJs
must also keep a playlist that shows that at least
