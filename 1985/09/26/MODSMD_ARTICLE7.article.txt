# PO Boxes for Students
## 
### DAVID EMERSON 
Working to end a longstanding shortage of
on-campus post office boxes, several Univer
sity departments, in cooperation with the
Stanford Post Office, have implemented a new
system for assigning students' boxes for the
current school year.
The new guidelines, developed jointly last
year by Residential Education, the Registrar's
Office and the University's Mail and Delivery
Service, give priority to students living in
residences without mail delivery, then to up
perclassmen.
Under the plan, the University rents boxes
from the Stanford Post Office as they become
available, and then uses its priorities to assign
them to students. P.O. box applications were
included in the undergraduate summer mailing.
As a result, all applications received from
upperclassmen who live in dorms without mail
delivery resulted in box assignments. The rest
of the boxes were assigned to freshmen on a
space available basis. No students from dorms
with mailing addresses were considered for
the boxes.
As of this week, about 300 frosh remain
without boxes, but according to Joan Kruse,
operations manager for the mail and delivery
service, the administration "hopes to have
them all filled by the end of November." This

would be a significant improvement over last
year, when some freshmen received their mail
from their dorm office into June due to their in
ability to gain a P.O. box.
Asst. Registrar Gloria Garing says the
shortage of boxes is not due to an insufficient
number having been built, but rather to the
fact that "a lot of local companies like to have a
Stanford mailing address." Also, many stu
dents who live in a dorm with mail delivery
elect to retain their boxes, she added.
Once a box has been rented, a customer has
renewal privileges as long as it is desired. Pre
viously, when boxes became available they
were rented by the post office on a first come,
first serve basis.
"We are trying to encourage students who
live in deliverable dorms to give up their
boxes," says Residential Education official
Elizabeth Hiyama. Flyers were put in all boxes
last year asking owners to not renew them if
they had an alternate mailing address.
Of the approximately 6,700 post office
boxes available at the Stanford branch, about
1,000 have so far been rented by the Univer
sity for priority assignment. The University
hopes to up this percentage by continuing to
acquire available boxes.
Kruse says the program's goal for the next
three to five years is to "be able to rent a box
to any Stanford person who wants one,"
regardless of their housing or class standing.
