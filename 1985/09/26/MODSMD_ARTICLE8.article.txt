Most Stanford students will endure a
few years of off-campus hassle and ex
pense in exchange for a diploma.
But for an alarming number of
prospective Stanford professors facing
the prospect of a far more permanent
commitment, trying to find a suitable
home in Silicon Valley seems like an or
deal to be avoided at all costs, even if it
does mean giving up a chance to teach
at a top-flight university in sunny Cali
fornia.
"I would say that it is perfectly fair to
call this a major threat to the quality of
academic life at Stanford," said Robin
Hamill, director of real estate programs
and lands management for the Univer
sity.
Hamill, whose office is responsible
for overseeing "the most extensive,
complicated, costly and intricate" fac
ulty housing program of any university
in the country, claims that between five
and 10 of the 90 or so prospective staff
members recruited each year are lost
on account of dissatisfaction with the
local housing situation.
"And the ones that we lose tend to
be senior faculty at the peak of their
careers," said Hamill. "This is just

when their publications are the
strongest and they are really well
known in their fields. We tend to lose
the people that we really want the
most."
As a result of this persistent prob
lem, the Board of Trustees recently
authorized an additional $6 million for
the University's mortgage coinvest
ment (COIN) program, one of four fac
ulty housing assistance programs ad
ministered by Hamill's office.
Under the original terms of COIN,
qualified faculty could borrow as much
as 50 percent of the purchase price of a
home at greatly reduced interest rates.
A set of new parameters for COIN is
currently being developed.
In conjunction with COIN, Stanford
also maintains a separate down pay
ment assistance program (DPAP), a
housing allowance program (HAP) and
a partial deferment plan of interest
rates in the secondary mortgage mar
ket known as the 10/30 program — all
geared to help faculty deal with the
greatly inflated cost of local housing.
Hamill stressed that these measures
were not conceived as any kind of fac
ulty bribe but merely as a reaction
against what might otherwise prove to
be a disastrous situation for the Univer
sity.

"In a lot of cases, if faculty recruits
didn't know these programs existed,
they wouldn't agree to come here in a
million years," said Hamill. "But with
our programs the average professor is
able to buy twice as much house as he
or she could afford without them."
In some circumstances, however,
even twice as much may not be
enough.
Jeremy Cohen, an assistant profes
sor in the Department of Communica
tion, receives aid from two of the four
programs, but still needs support from
his parents in order to afford local
housing.
"At the level of assistant professor,
people just don't have the money to af
ford a down payment in Silicon Valley
even with help from the University,"
Cohen said.
Cohen believes that attracting assis
tant professors to Stanford in the
future might prove to be one of the big
gest problems yet to be faced on ac
count of the housing crunch, a point
that is not lost on Hamill.
"Some of them are just out of
graduate school and they still have
debts they have to pay off," said
Hamill. "We think that we will eventu
ally have to do a lot more building in or
der to solve the problem."
