Energy is best channeled into constructive path
ways, whether it is energy born from a sense that
justice has not been served or from a desire to
change unwanted situations.
The Student Union Committee's boycott of the
Coffee House now run by Saga Corp. is not a con
structive use of the energy that comes from both
these sources.
The boycott, if widely supported, would register
student anger over the loss of a student-run coffee
house.
But the likelihood that it will force Tresidder and
Saga to dissolve their contract (one that took effect
this month and is designed to last at least two years)
and hand the Coffee House back to the student or
ganization, Coffee House Inc., is negligible. So
negligible as to be non-existent.
In that light, the boycott is reduced to a symbolic
gesture that makes it look as if students refuse to
make the best of a situation. Sour grapes, in other
words.

If students want to again own the Coffee House,
their energy should be directed toward owning one,
not merely pouting over one they don't have.
The committee's ideas for setting up an alterna
tive, student-run coffee house or for subcontracting
the Coffee House from Saga are more worthy of
student energy than the boycott.
The need for a hangout on campus is evident, at
least from a student's perspective. One that is stu
dent run would be more personal than one operated
by an outside company and would also provide a
sense of pride and community. "Our place," rather
than "the corporation's place."
Correctly or not, the Coffee House is now the
corporation's place. And whether or not it operates
the Coffee House well, a boycott is not the most ef
ficient method to develop a gathering place for stu
dents.
Students desiring a coffee house should help
create a new one.
