MICRODISC NEWS
Microdisc is Stanford's microcomputer discount purchase
plan for eligible faculty, students, and staff. Currently
offered are selected products from Apple, IBM, and
Hewlett-Packard. See below for a description of a recent
policy change and summaries of recent changes to the
various product lists.
Please note that prices quoted in the following descriptions
do not include handling fee, sales tax, or shipping.
GENERAL POLICIES:
Effective September 1, 1985, although each purchase is
still assessed a 5% handling fee, the $25 minimum has
been eliminated.
APPLE PRODUCT LIST:
Until October 31, the 512K Macintosh, Imagewriter printer,
external disk drive, and Macintosh carrying case will be
