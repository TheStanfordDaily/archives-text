# Senate Praises Sterling

### JOYA WESLEY Senior staff writer 
In its first meeting of the school year, the Faculty
Senate yesterday approved a memorial resolution for
John Ewart Wallace Sterling and extended three doc
toral programs.
J.E. Wallace Sterling, former chancellor and presi
dent of the University, died July 1. Among his con
tributions to Stanford, according to resolution author
Kenneth Arrow, professor of economics, were his im
provements in financial aid to students and an increase
in faculty incentives, which aided in the fulfillment of his
goal of increasing the quality of both students and fac
ulty at Stanford.
When Sterling arrived at Stanford, the University
was "marked by promise and problems," according to
the resolution. When he left, the University was on
firm financial footing and had a high rank in scholarly
reputation.
The senate adopted the resolution in the customary
manner with a standing moment of silence.
Upon the unanimous recommendation of the Com
mittee on Graduate Studies (C-GS), the senate also
voted unanimously for the five-year extension of the
doctoral programs in Modern Thought and Literature,
Comparative Literature, and Humanities Special Pro
grams.
All doctoral programs must be reviewed every five
years in order to retain their authority to nominate stu
dents for doctoral degrees. The C-GS recommen
dations were based upon written evidence and discus
sion with the chairs and leading professors of the pro
grams.
During his report, University President Donald Ken
nedy thanked the Dean of Student Affairs Office, the
faculty and the various academic departments for "a
very successful Freshman Orientation."
Kennedy also made a few general comments on the
ongoing negotiations between the University and the
United Stanford Workers.
"We want the best outcome for all parties and we
think that all possible speed is necessary to secure that
outcome," he said.
He also said that it is a slow process and that more
specific commentary is best left to those doing the ac
tual negotiating.
Kennedy commented briefly on academic author
ship, campus arrests and the University research
policy.
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz asked Kennedy to
respond to Rebholz' allegation that the Hoover Institu
tion is an organization with a political mission and in so
being "should not be a part of this or any other univer
sity." He went on to say that the Reagan Foundation,
the organization responsible for the soon-to-be-built
Reagan Library complex, seeks to become a clone of
Hoover.
Kennedy disagreed "about as thoroughly as one can"
with that view.
Provost James Rosse, during his report, spoke of the
Board of Trustees plan to renew the Co-Investment
Plan for faculty housing. This plan aims to help in the
recruitment and retention of quality faculty members.
Rosse also informed the senate of the resignation of
Michael Atkin, dean of the School of Education. Atkin
has agreed to remain in his position until the end of this
academic year, at which time a new dean will be ap
. pointed.
