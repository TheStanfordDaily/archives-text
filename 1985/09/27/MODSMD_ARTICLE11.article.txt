They will make the trip from the ranch to the
Farm, and they will do it in a big way.
Just the way most things are done in Texas — on
a large scale. Big 10-gallon hats, big pick-up trucks,
big meaty barbeque ribs, big bowls of down-home
chili, big oil wells, larger-than-life TV serials . . .
big hearts.
Don't forget big football teams, and even bigger
groups of die-hard fans. It is said that 10,000 Tex
ans will leave the Lone Star State for the Golden
State this weekend. Whole University of Texas fra
ternities are heading for San Francisco Airport on
special-deal 4 a.m. flights.
And when the Texans arrive at Stanford Stadium
tomorrow, they will witness not only the Longhorns
versus the Cardinal on the football field. There will
be another spectacle. Possibly an even bigger one
— and certainly a more fundamental one. It will be
the clash between what makes Texas Texas and
what makes California California.
It will be the clash of the grandest of stereotypes,
the most famous of fads and the trendiest of trends.
It will be the contest between the two states that
are most heavily supported by cliches, and virtually
form their identities because of them.
Texans are a breed apart. So are Californians.
Very distinct breeds. Those struggling with identity
crisis may be all of the Texans at Stanford — caught
between the two ideologies. But they solve this
problem by forming a Texans-at-Stanford Club,
which gives them a place to share chili recipes and
an outlet for their hunting stories.
While Fred Akers' 'Horns grovel with Jack El
way's Card on the gridiron, the hunters will meet
the windsurfers, green-lensed Ray Bans will meet
Vaurnets, Lone Star Beer will meet California
Coolers . . . Tex-Mex will meet California Cuisine.

Local caterers are having a field day with this one.
Texas tailgater parties will be well stocked with
chili, tortilla chips and picante sauce, pecan pies
. . .and beef. All kinds of beef — Texans love it.
From regular ground beef to roasted buffalo meat.
In fact, the Texas Longhorns' first official mascot, a
calf named Bevo I, had a fatal end to his career. He
was branded and served as steak at a Texas-A & M
get-together.
Stanford students may say no thank you to the
beef, even if it is a portion of Bevo XII, the Long
horn's current mascot. They're all vegetarians,
right? Yes, they'll eat greens, but eat their beloved
"Tree" mascot? Never.
But's there is no harm in sharing fads; expanding
one's horizons. Stanford fans are having some of
their own chili cook-offs, Texas style. And Texans
may want to try vegetable pates, California cheeses
and wines.
Indeed, food-styles and life-styles are different in
the two states. As are football game watching styles
— Texans typically go to games on "dates" — it's a
tragedy if you don't have one. They will "look one
million percent, all made-up," while Cardinal fans
will come in big groups, clad in shorts and Stanford
T-shirts. Very laid-back, of course.
As one Stanford student from Texas testifies, the
Texas fans actually watch the game, while Stanford
students just go for a good time — to see the Band
and their friends in the crowd.
If the Texans look up from the game for awhile,
and the Cardinal fans look past their friends to all the
people sporting cowboy boots, the stereotypes will
become quite clear-cut, and it will be fun to watch
them at work.
Don't worry, you probably won't be surprised by
what you see.
