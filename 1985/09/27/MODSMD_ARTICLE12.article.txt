## Ethnic Dorms Misjudged 
### 
This letter is in response to the recent publicity in
area newspapers concerning a study on Stanford's eth
nic theme houses conducted by John Bunzei, one of
Reagan's many pet appointees from the Hoover Insti
tution. As the staff of Casa Zapata, Stanford's Chicano
theme house, we take great exception to several of the
comments and assumptions expressed by Bunzei in his
study. While we will not argue with the statistical
results, it is clear to us that Bunzei operates from a

VIEWPOINT

pre-conceived bias against ethnic theme houses. This
is evident in the overly simplistic methodology of the
study, clearly designed to produce certain desired
results, and in Bunzel's inability, or refusal, to ex
plore the many complex factors which may have in
fluenced the study's results.
In using a group of "randomly selected" seniors for
his research sample, Bunzel was merely seeking an af
firmation and legitimization of the common campus
stereotype of ethnic theme houses. It is not news to
anyone that a large proportion of Stanford's
predominantly white, middle and upper class popula
tion believe that ethnic theme houses increase
"feelings of separation between minority students and
whites." Many people felt that way 10 years ago when
the theme houses were first established.
What Bunzel fails to consider is that ethnic theme
houses make up a very small percentage of Stanford's
housing accommodations, and consequently "most"

This gathering of people of
color does not preclude par
ticipation by white students.
That is a decision made by
the white students them
selves.

seniors in a random sample probably have never lived
in an ethnic theme house, never have taken the initia
tive to choose to live in one and never even have atten
ded a program sponsored by a theme house. Thus,
"most" seniors' knowledge of theme houses is limited
to stereotypes tossed about campus.
Furthermore, it is these stereotypes which might
account in large part for the decline in the percentage
of freshmen who choose to live in theme houses. The
tragedy of stereotypes is that they travel much farther
and faster than the truth. The reality of the Stanford
grapevine across the country is that most frosh have
heard about theme houses, sometimes favorably from
those who have lived in them and sometimes un
favorably from those spouting rumors, before they
ever arrive at Stanford. Our suspicions that this rumor
spreading has occurred have been confirmed by both
our own experiences and by the apprehensive attitudes
expressed by many arriving freshmen. This ap
prehension, however, is quickly replaced by a feeling
of comeraderie and pride in the house. As an example,
I'm a Resident Assitant in Casa Zapata this year, back
for my third year as a white student there. Back in my
hometown of Missoula, Montana, before I ever arrived

at Stanford for my freshman year, I was told by an
older Stanford student that Zapata was a "bad" place to
live. He had never been there and had no rationale for
his statement. Fortunately it did not affect my expecta
tions, and, as a white student, my experiences at
Zapata have been enriching and rewarding.
It seems that whenever people of color choose not
to disappear into the white culture, participate only in
predominantly white activities and adopt the values of
the dominant white population, the immediate conclu
sion is that the minority population has "segregated it
self. " Students from Casa Zapata often go to programs
in predominantly white houses, not to mention the fact
that almost any activity outside of the house, including
classes, is done among a predominantly white popula
tion. Few white students from outside of Casa Zapata,
however, make the effort to come to events in the
dorm, even though the programs are widely publicized.
The cultural elitism of many white students at Stanford
leads them to believe that black culture is only for
blacks, Chicano culture is only for Chicanos, while
white culture ought to before everyone.
Bunzei and other University personnel have
criticized ethinic residents of theme houses for wanting
to live in "racial comfort." From their position within
the dominant racial group, these officials fail to recog
nize that the majority of dorms on the Stanford campus
are what might be termed "white" theme houses. Fur
thermore, the distaste with which many white students
regard the prospect of living in an ethnic theme house
is clearly an expression of their desire to live in "racial
comfort," white racial comfort. Ironically, this attitude
on the part of white students is never questioned, but
is rather legitimized though "studies" such as that done
by Bunzei. And why is it that the existence of fraterni
ties, which are all male and predominantly, if not exclu
sively white, is never questioned? For years, fraterni
ties have been housed in racial and social comfort in
some of the finest houses on campus, while ethnic
theme houses have struggled for a right to exist in the
oldest dorms.
In reality, it is not the minority students who have
separated themselves from white students. It is rather
that a large part of the white population at Stanford
refuses to participate in this effort at cross-cultural
education. Such mixed education will never be
achieved by immersing one or two minority students in
every dorm on campus. The tyranny of the majority
will always suppress the full expression of racial or cul
tural differences. A certain critical, mass of racial
minority students is necessary for the expression of
collective cultural activity. This gathering of people of
color does not preclude participation by white stu
dents. That is a decision that has been made by the
white students themselves.
Lastly, we would like to dispel a few of the most
popular myths about our house. Only 40 percent of the
students in Casa Zapata are Chicano. Much of our en
ergy as a staff is devoted to actively encouraging non-
Chicano students to help plan and to participate in
house activities. Any non-Chicano students that feel
"left out" are those that have rejected repeated invita
tions to become involved.
Zapata is a house where fun and educational pro
gramming are stressed equally and are equally suc
cessful. There are many durable friendships formed in
Zapata and many of those are interracial. The reality of
Zapata, a characteristic displayed year after year, is
that it is a dorm where residents take pride in their
house and truly care for one another. We invite Mr.
Bunzei to join us for dinner one night and experience
that which he criticizes.

the theme houses were first established.

housing accommodations, and consequently "most"

seniors in a random sample probably have never lived
in an ethnic theme house, never have taken the initia
tive to choose to live in one and never even have atten
ded a program sponsored by a theme house. Thus,
"most" seniors' knowledge of theme houses is limited
to stereotypes tossed about campus.
Furthermore, it is these stereotypes which might
account in large part for the decline in the percentage
of freshmen who choose to live in theme houses. The
tragedy of stereotypes is that they travel much farther
and faster than the truth. The reality of the Stanford
grapevine across the country is that most frosh have
heard about theme houses, sometimes favorably from
those who have lived in them and sometimes un
favorably from those spouting rumors, before they
ever arrive at Stanford. Our suspicions that this rumor
spreading has occurred have been confirmed by both
our own experiences and by the apprehensive attitudes
expressed by many arriving freshmen. This ap
prehension, however, is quickly replaced by a feeling
of comeraderie and pride in the house. As an example,
I'm a Resident Assitant in Casa Zapata this year, back
for my third year as a white student there. Back in my
hometown of Missoula, Montana, before I ever arrived

at Stanford for my freshman year, I was told by an
older Stanford student that Zapata was a "bad" place to
live. He had never been there and had no rationale for
his statement. Fortunately it did not affect my expecta
tions, and, as a white student, my experiences at
Zapata have been enriching and rewarding.
It seems that whenever people of color choose not
to disappear into the white culture, participate only in
predominantly white activities and adopt the values of
the dominant white population, the immediate conclu
sion is that the minority population has "segregated it
self. " Students from Casa Zapata often go to programs
in predominantly white houses, not to mention the fact
that almost any activity outside of the house, including
classes, is done among a predominantly white popula
tion. Few white students from outside of Casa Zapata,
however, make the effort to come to events in the
dorm, even though the programs are widely publicized.
The cultural elitism of many white students at Stanford
leads them to believe that black culture is only for
blacks, Chicano culture is only for Chicanos, while
white culture ought to before everyone.
Bunzei and other University personnel have
criticized ethinic residents of theme houses for wanting
to live in "racial comfort." From their position within
the dominant racial group, these officials fail to recog
nize that the majority of dorms on the Stanford campus
are what might be termed "white" theme houses. Fur
thermore, the distaste with which many white students
regard the prospect of living in an ethnic theme house
is clearly an expression of their desire to live in "racial
comfort," white racial comfort. Ironically, this attitude
on the part of white students is never questioned, but
is rather legitimized though "studies" such as that done
by Bunzei. And why is it that the existence of fraterni
ties, which are all male and predominantly, if not exclu
sively white, is never questioned? For years, fraterni
ties have been housed in racial and social comfort in
some of the finest houses on campus, while ethnic
theme houses have struggled for a right to exist in the
oldest dorms.
In reality, it is not the minority students who have
separated themselves from white students. It is rather
that a large part of the white population at Stanford
refuses to participate in this effort at cross-cultural
education. Such mixed education will never be
achieved by immersing one or two minority students in
every dorm on campus. The tyranny of the majority
will always suppress the full expression of racial or cul
tural differences. A certain critical, mass of racial
minority students is necessary for the expression of
collective cultural activity. This gathering of people of
color does not preclude participation by white stu
dents. That is a decision that has been made by the
white students themselves.
Lastly, we would like to dispel a few of the most
popular myths about our house. Only 40 percent of the
students in Casa Zapata are Chicano. Much of our en
ergy as a staff is devoted to actively encouraging non-
Chicano students to help plan and to participate in
house activities. Any non-Chicano students that feel
"left out" are those that have rejected repeated invita
tions to become involved.
Zapata is a house where fun and educational pro
gramming are stressed equally and are equally suc
cessful. There are many durable friendships formed in
Zapata and many of those are interracial. The reality of
Zapata, a characteristic displayed year after year, is
that it is a dorm where residents take pride in their
house and truly care for one another. We invite Mr.
Bunzei to join us for dinner one night and experience
that which he criticizes.

This letter is in response to the recent publicity in
area newspapers concerning a study on Stanford's eth
nic theme houses conducted by John Bunzei, one of
Reagan's many pet appointees from the Hoover Insti
tution. As the staff of Casa Zapata, Stanford's Chicano
theme house, we take great exception to several of the
comments and assumptions expressed by Bunzei in his
study. While we will not argue with the statistical
results, it is clear to us that Bunzei operates from a

VIEWPOINT

pre-conceived bias against ethnic theme houses. This
is evident in the overly simplistic methodology of the
study, clearly designed to produce certain desired
results, and in Bunzel's inability, or refusal, to ex
plore the many complex factors which may have in
fluenced the study's results.
In using a group of "randomly selected" seniors for
his research sample, Bunzel was merely seeking an af
firmation and legitimization of the common campus
stereotype of ethnic theme houses. It is not news to
anyone that a large proportion of Stanford's
predominantly white, middle and upper class popula
tion believe that ethnic theme houses increase
"feelings of separation between minority students and
whites." Many people felt that way 10 years ago when
the theme houses were first established.

houses make up a very small percentage of Stanford's
