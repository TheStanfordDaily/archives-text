## Israel Acts in Defense 
### 
O.L. Brannaman's letter, "U.S.
Must Stop Aiding Israel" (Tuesday,
Sept. 24) was a senseless tirade
that showed a total lack of knowl
edge regarding the events and un
derpinnings of the situation in the
Middle East.
First of all, contrary to what Mr.
Brannaman asserts, "homes and
land" were not taken from Pales
tinians by "Zionist invaders." Most

VIEWPOINT

displaced Palestinians left
voluntarily when Palestine was
partitioned in 1948 after the Arab
leaders promised to "drive the
Zionists into the sea" as soon as the
Zionists had left. Palestinians were
publically warned to leave until the
area was "purged" of Jews, at
which point they could return and
have not only have their land back,
but also that of the Jews. Upon this
urging, most Palestinians
voluntarily left Israel. They were
not forcibly removed.
To educate Brannaman in his
tory: According to the Bible, the
area known as Israel belonged to
the Jews during ancient times. The
name of the area was changed to
Palestine by the occupying Romans
after a series of Jewish uprisings
protesting restrictions on religious
worship. In the 19205, when the
British controlled the land, Lord
Balfour promised to return a por
tion of the land to the Jews, and, in
1948, Palestine was partitioned.
Eighty-five percent of Palestine
was set aside as a Palestinian
homeland to be known as Jordan;
the other 15 percent (smaller than
New Jersey in total area) was set
aside for the establishment of a
Jewish homeland.

The reason America supports
"the Zionists," Mr. Brannaman, is
that Israel is the only democracy in
the area. In Israel, people of any
faith — even Arabs — may worship
according to their desires. Such is
not the case in the Arab nations of
the area. As for the true aggressors
in the region, various consortiums
of Arab nations attempted to
destroy Israel in 1948, during the
19605, and even in an attack during
the most holy Jewish holiday of the
year, Yom Kippur, in 1973. It is
ironic that your misguided letter ap
peared on the eve that same holiday
12 years later.

It has been Arab
terrorists who have
killed Israeli men,
women and
children over the
past 40 years.
President Reagan
is correct to label
them 'barbarians.'

It is quite unclear what "tactics"
have been used by "America and
the Zionists" for 40 years against
the Palestinians, as your letter
asserts. Israel has faced the threat
of elimination, from all sides, since
its birth. This has forced it to re
quire all citizens, including women,

to serve time in the military. Fur
thermore, this threat has neces
sitated that Israel maintain a mili
tary budget of approximately 25
percent of its gross national product
— an even higher percentage than,
that of the Reagan Administration,
which so often falls prey to
criticism.
Consequently, your solution to
ending terrorism in the Middle East
would not work, as Israel is not the
only target of the Arab terrorists
there. In fact, the worst act of ter
rorism America has faced came not
in Israel but in Lebanon, where the
Palestine Liberation Organization
has created a divided and destroyed
nation since 1975 and where Mos
lem fanatics carry out their terrorist
acts against Christians and other
Moslems. It was an Arab terrorist
who destroyed the US military bar
racks, killing hundreds of
Americans. And it has been Arab
terrorists who have killed Israeli
men, women and children consis
tently over the past 40 years. Pres
ident Reagan is correct to label
them "barbarians."
It seems extremely ridiculous to
require the only Jewish nation in the
area to allocate land for any dis
placed Palestinians. A more
reasonable solution would be for
one of the scores of Arab nations in
the region to welcome its brethren
or to set aside land for a Palestinian
homeland. How about using the
country created to be a Palestinian
homeland —Jordan? To continue to
expect Israel to further compro
mise its security by tendering more
land is either an anti-Semetic atti
tude based on Israel's Jewish found
ing or a warped sense of equity.
