## Barracks Made Beautiful: A Student's Guide to Dorm Decor 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
Dirty white walls, rubber-coated beds, industrial
style desks and a cold, cold floor.
If you moved into Stern, Wilbur, Florence Moore,
Toyon, Roble, Lagunita, Crothers or Branner last
week, those words sound pretty familiar. The Univer
sity has outfitted you with the latest in institutional fur
nishings.
Sturdy? Yes. Functional? You bet. Comfortable?
Maybe. Pretty? No way.
But it doesn't have to stay that way.
The splendor of Governor's Corner may be out of
your reach, but with a little cash and a lot of creativity,
you can make your new-found home a bit more livable
— and maybe even lovable.
From the Bottom Up
If you're stuck in one of the few remaining campus
residences without carpeting, your first stop should be

at a rug remnant store. These stores obtain odd-sized
carpet scraps, mostly leftovers from major business
renovations or just discontinued styles, and sell them
for much less than their original per-yard cost. What is
a scrap to General Motors is a wall-to-wall size carpet
for the rest of us, so dorm-room-size "scraps" are
plentiful.
You can expect to pay anywhere from almost noth
ing to $75 for a rug remnant, depending on the quality
of the rug and the store from which you buy it.
Shelf Life
The second big improvement for the dorm room
with "Architectural Digest" aspirations is shelving. You
can buy pre-made, unfinished, particle-board book
shelves for about $25 at local stores, but that's prob
ably not the best way to go about this.
Rather, head for a hardware and lumber store —
Hubbard & Johnson seems to be the Stanford favorite
— and buy some shelf-size wood and some garden
stepping-stone cinder blocks. Stack the boards on the
blocks and you have a home entertainment center, a
plant showcase, a bookcase or at least someplace to
dump all the stuff that you don't know what to do with.
What's more, these are cheaper than pre-made
shelves, you can re-arrange them into just about any
configuration when you're bored of your first set-up,
and they're a whole lot easier to store or transport than
the pre-made variety.
A word of warning: Don't try to attach your shelves
to the walls. Residential Education knows where you
live, and will send you a bill for any nail holes you leave
behind.
Against the Wall
Traditionally, the University has been understanding
when students object to the lovely off-white shade of
most dorm rooms. In most cases, if you go to your
dorm office and plead your case, you will be supplied
with University-approved paint in one of several inof

fensive colors. Don't try painting your room with unap
proved paint — they'll hunt you down over the sum
mer, and you'll pay.
Another no-no is gluing cork onto the walls. Sure,
you might think it looks better, but the University
doesn't. The cork is nearly impossible to get off the
walls, and if you don't do it yourself, the University will

charge you for the time it takes work crews to take it
off for you.
You can, however, jazz up the walls in other, less
costly ways.
Try covering your wall with butcher paper —

This room, although admirable in its ability to
withstand earthquakes without noticeable
damage, lacks the aesthetic touch.

Remodeled and refurbished, this cozy dwelling sports a series of attractive (and rather inexpen
sive) art prints and a clever shelving arrangement for the portable stereos.
