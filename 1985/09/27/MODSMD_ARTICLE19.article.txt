## Barracks Made Beautiful: A Student's Guide to Dorm Decor 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
Dirty white walls, rubber-coated beds, industrial
style desks and a cold, cold floor.
If you moved into Stern, Wilbur, Florence Moore,
Toyon, Roble, Lagunita, Crothers or Branner last
week, those words sound pretty familiar. The Univer
sity has outfitted you with the latest in institutional fur
nishings.
Sturdy? Yes. Functional? You bet. Comfortable?
Maybe. Pretty? No way.
But it doesn't have to stay that way.
The splendor of Governor's Corner may be out of
your reach, but with a little cash and a lot of creativity,
you can make your new-found home a bit more livable
— and maybe even lovable.
From the Bottom Up
If you're stuck in one of the few remaining campus
residences without carpeting, your first stop should be

at a rug remnant store. These stores obtain odd-sized
carpet scraps, mostly leftovers from major business
renovations or just discontinued styles, and sell them
for much less than their original per-yard cost. What is
a scrap to General Motors is a wall-to-wall size carpet
for the rest of us, so dorm-room-size "scraps" are
plentiful.
You can expect to pay anywhere from almost noth
ing to $75 for a rug remnant, depending on the quality
of the rug and the store from which you buy it.
Shelf Life
The second big improvement for the dorm room
with "Architectural Digest" aspirations is shelving. You
can buy pre-made, unfinished, particle-board book
shelves for about $25 at local stores, but that's prob
ably not the best way to go about this.
Rather, head for a hardware and lumber store —
Hubbard & Johnson seems to be the Stanford favorite
— and buy some shelf-size wood and some garden
stepping-stone cinder blocks. Stack the boards on the
blocks and you have a home entertainment center, a
plant showcase, a bookcase or at least someplace to
dump all the stuff that you don't know what to do with.
What's more, these are cheaper than pre-made
shelves, you can re-arrange them into just about any
configuration when you're bored of your first set-up,
and they're a whole lot easier to store or transport than
the pre-made variety.
A word of warning: Don't try to attach your shelves
to the walls. Residential Education knows where you
live, and will send you a bill for any nail holes you leave
behind.
Against the Wall
Traditionally, the University has been understanding
when students object to the lovely off-white shade of
most dorm rooms. In most cases, if you go to your
dorm office and plead your case, you will be supplied
with University-approved paint in one of several inof

fensive colors. Don't try painting your room with unap
proved paint — they'll hunt you down over the sum
mer, and you'll pay.
Another no-no is gluing cork onto the walls. Sure,
you might think it looks better, but the University
doesn't. The cork is nearly impossible to get off the
walls, and if you don't do it yourself, the University will

charge you for the time it takes work crews to take it
off for you.
You can, however, jazz up the walls in other, less
costly ways.
Try covering your wall with butcher paper —

available in several colors at Stanford Bookstore — and
go wild with grafitti. When you're tired of what you've
written, tear down the butcher paper and start over.
If you re into things a little more tame, you can al
ways go the poster routine. Now that Tower Records
has bumped its poster shop to make way for another
video rentals place, tracking down that 24" x 36" David
Lee Roth poster you ve always wanted could be tough.
But with perseverance, anything can happen. Comix
and Comix has been known to carry superhero
posters, the local stationery stores are big with the
unicorn-and-rainbows set, the bookstore has a little bit
of everything, the store at the Art Gallery offers artsy
prints and Movie Memories downtown has posters
from just about every film ever made, although the
prices are often steep and the posters are often
creased.
If you re into bigger-bucks art, there are a couple of
places at the shopping center that where you can lay
down $200 or more for a deluxe signed edition of
something or other.
Green With Envy
Plants are a good way to make your place seem a
little friendlier and help get the old carbon dioxide and
oxygen moving. A few times a year you can buy
houseplants right in front of Tresidder, but better buys
are to be found at hardware and garden stores.
You should be able to find an easy-to-care-for potted
job with green leaves and the whole bit for about $5,

but you could spend a lot more, too, if you're so in
clined. An indoor tree would be nice, but that will set
you back about $50 or so.
Pillow Talk
If a desk chair isn't your idea of the ultimate in
seating comfort, you're in luck. The last time we
checked, huge lean-against-the-wall-and-collapse pil
lows were available at the San Jose Flea Market for
about $20 each.
If pillows are a little too laid-back for you, real
couches and overstuffed chairs are usually available at
Goodwill on El Camino, and you can sometimes get
them for as little as $25. Import stores like Cost Plus
on El Camino sometimes offer good buys on
lightweight rattan furniture like those obnoxious
peacock chairs you probably had your high school
graduation picture taken in.
Of course, you may not have room for such luxuries
unless you loft your bed, which brings us to our next
item.
Lofting is a complicated, difficult and expensive un
dertaking, but it can effectively double the size of a
room with a tall-enough ceiling. There are loft-building
instructions in The Daily's Orientation issue, and the
folks at Hubbard and Johnson are usually pretty patient
with all-thumbs junior carpenters.
Plan on spending as much as $100 for a sturdy, free
standing loft, which is the only kind the University will
let you build anyway. And check with your dorm office
before you build to see what specific regulations might
apply to your residence.
With these general hints in mind, you should be able
to make even the worst University housing a place you
can call home.

peacock chairs you probably had your high school
graduation picture taken in.
Of course, you may not have room for such luxuries
unless you loft your bed, which brings us to our next
item.
Lofting is a complicated, difficult and expensive un
dertaking, but it can effectively double the size of a
room with a tall-enough ceiling. There are loft-building
instructions in The Daily's Orientation issue, and the
folks at Hubbard and Johnson are usually pretty patient
with all-thumbs junior carpenters.
Plan on spending as much as $100 for a sturdy, free
standing loft, which is the only kind the University will
let you build anyway. And check with your dorm office
before you build to see what specific regulations might
apply to your residence.
With these general hints in mind, you should be able
to make even the worst University housing a place you
can call home.
Dirty white walls, rubber-coated beds, industrial
style desks and a cold, cold floor.
If you moved into Stern, Wilbur, Florence Moore,
Toyon, Roble, Lagunita, Crothers or Branner last
week, those words sound pretty familiar. The Univer
sity has outfitted you with the latest in institutional fur
nishings.
Sturdy? Yes. Functional? You bet. Comfortable?
Maybe. Pretty? No way.
But it doesn't have to stay that way.
The splendor of Governor's Corner may be out of
your reach, but with a little cash and a lot of creativity,
you can make your new-found home a bit more livable
— and maybe even lovable.
From the Bottom Up
If you're stuck in one of the few remaining campus
residences without carpeting, your first stop should be

at a rug remnant store. These stores obtain odd-sized
carpet scraps, mostly leftovers from major business
renovations or just discontinued styles, and sell them
for much less than their original per-yard cost. What is
a scrap to General Motors is a wall-to-wall size carpet
for the rest of us, so dorm-room-size "scraps" are
plentiful.
You can expect to pay anywhere from almost noth
ing to $75 for a rug remnant, depending on the quality
of the rug and the store from which you buy it.
Shelf Life
The second big improvement for the dorm room
with "Architectural Digest" aspirations is shelving. You
can buy pre-made, unfinished, particle-board book
shelves for about $25 at local stores, but that's prob
ably not the best way to go about this.
Rather, head for a hardware and lumber store —
Hubbard & Johnson seems to be the Stanford favorite
— and buy some shelf-size wood and some garden
stepping-stone cinder blocks. Stack the boards on the
blocks and you have a home entertainment center, a
plant showcase, a bookcase or at least someplace to
dump all the stuff that you don't know what to do with.
What's more, these are cheaper than pre-made
shelves, you can re-arrange them into just about any
configuration when you're bored of your first set-up,
and they're a whole lot easier to store or transport than
the pre-made variety.
A word of warning: Don't try to attach your shelves
to the walls. Residential Education knows where you
live, and will send you a bill for any nail holes you leave
behind.
Against the Wall
Traditionally, the University has been understanding
when students object to the lovely off-white shade of
most dorm rooms. In most cases, if you go to your
dorm office and plead your case, you will be supplied
with University-approved paint in one of several inof

fensive colors. Don't try painting your room with unap
proved paint — they'll hunt you down over the sum
mer, and you'll pay.
Another no-no is gluing cork onto the walls. Sure,
you might think it looks better, but the University
doesn't. The cork is nearly impossible to get off the
walls, and if you don't do it yourself, the University will

charge you for the time it takes work crews to take it
off for you.
You can, however, jazz up the walls in other, less
costly ways.
Try covering your wall with butcher paper —

available in several colors at Stanford Bookstore — and
go wild with grafitti. When you're tired of what you've
written, tear down the butcher paper and start over.
If you re into things a little more tame, you can al
ways go the poster routine. Now that Tower Records
has bumped its poster shop to make way for another
video rentals place, tracking down that 24" x 36" David
Lee Roth poster you ve always wanted could be tough.
But with perseverance, anything can happen. Comix
and Comix has been known to carry superhero
posters, the local stationery stores are big with the
unicorn-and-rainbows set, the bookstore has a little bit
of everything, the store at the Art Gallery offers artsy
prints and Movie Memories downtown has posters
from just about every film ever made, although the
prices are often steep and the posters are often
creased.
If you re into bigger-bucks art, there are a couple of
places at the shopping center that where you can lay
down $200 or more for a deluxe signed edition of
something or other.
Green With Envy
Plants are a good way to make your place seem a
little friendlier and help get the old carbon dioxide and
oxygen moving. A few times a year you can buy
houseplants right in front of Tresidder, but better buys
are to be found at hardware and garden stores.
You should be able to find an easy-to-care-for potted
job with green leaves and the whole bit for about $5,

but you could spend a lot more, too, if you're so in
clined. An indoor tree would be nice, but that will set
you back about $50 or so.
Pillow Talk
If a desk chair isn't your idea of the ultimate in
seating comfort, you're in luck. The last time we
checked, huge lean-against-the-wall-and-collapse pil
lows were available at the San Jose Flea Market for
about $20 each.
If pillows are a little too laid-back for you, real
couches and overstuffed chairs are usually available at
Goodwill on El Camino, and you can sometimes get
them for as little as $25. Import stores like Cost Plus
on El Camino sometimes offer good buys on
lightweight rattan furniture like those obnoxious
peacock chairs you probably had your high school
graduation picture taken in.
