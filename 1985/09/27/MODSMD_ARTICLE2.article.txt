# ASSU Hears USW
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
Tresidder Union operations and the on
going negotiations between the University
and United Stanford Workers (USW)
dominated discussion during a meeting of the
ASSU Senate last evening.
Responding to an invitation to speak before
the senate, David Stephens, chairperson of
the USW negotiating team, blasted the Uni
versity for attempting to split workers from
the Stanford community and misrepresenting
union positions and demands.
"I will state very strongly that the workers
are part of the University community," Step
hens said. "The administration is trying to
portray the union and the workers as trying
to limit the right of students to work."
The union proposals will not endanger stu
dent employees at any level, Stephens said.
"We don't perceive students as a threat. We
perceive the University's hiring of temporary
workers as a threat."
Stephens also accused the administration
of "misrepresenting" union positions in

Campus Report, the University's weekly
newspaper.
"Our positions are not represented (in that
publication) faithfully," Stephens said.
Stephens also accused the administration
of attempting to rekindle its efforts to bust
the union despite member approval of the
union's actions and the failure of University
attempted legal roadblocks.
And the University pays little attention to
the "human and social" cost paid by workers,
Stephens charged.
"We think the University can afford to pay
its long-term workers what they're due,"
Stephens said.
The University's failure to "bargain in good
faith" is a direct attempt to promote a strike,
he said, although he insisted young union
members are trying to avoid that conse
quence despite the "urgency" of the situa
tion.
"The workers feel nervous without a con
tract," Stephens said, "but what we're trying
to do is prevent a strike."

The ASSU Senate holds its first meeting of the school year last night.
The continuing saga involving the
Coffee House also got some atten
tion last night.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons defended the "fair process"
through which Saga Corporation
won the contractual right to run the
Coffee House in Tresidder Union.
It was "the same process that
made it possible for Coffee House,
Inc. to win the bid five years ago
and to not win this time around,"
Lyons said.
He added that he was
"disappointed" by not having a
student-run establishment but
preferred the results of "fair" com
petition.

The creation of a broad-based
task force, Lyons said, indicated
the University's desire to preserve
the "essence" of the Coffee House
in the future.
When questioned by Graduate
Senator Jim DeLaHunt as to
whether Tresidder Union was be
coming little more than a "White
Plaza shopping center" with busi
ness connections, Lyons defended
the awarding of contracts to Wells
Fargo Bank and American Express
Travel Service.
"I think the loss of the Coffee
House represents the demise of the
last portion of a student union that
exists at Stanford," DeLaHunt said.
Lyons stressed that Tresidder
was as much a "community" as

"student" facility as well as a place
hampered by space constraints.
"Like it or not," Lyons said,
"we're stuck with a building that is
not as functional as many good col
lege unions I know."
Athos Kasapi, a member of the
Student Union Committee, outlined
plans to create an alternative to the
Saga-controlled Coffee House and
accused Tresidder Union adminis
trators of attempting to derail ef
forts to secure a new location.
"Tresidder Union has been op
posing us all the way," Kasapi said.
Last night's meeting also marked
the official end of the" long and
tumultuous career of Graduate
Senator Jim McGrath, who resigned
to pursue outside employment.
