# ASSU Hears USW
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
Tresidder Union operations and the on
going negotiations between the University
and United Stanford Workers (USW)
dominated discussion during a meeting of the
ASSU Senate last evening.
Responding to an invitation to speak before
the senate, David Stephens, chairperson of
the USW negotiating team, blasted the Uni
versity for attempting to split workers from
the Stanford community and misrepresenting
union positions and demands.
"I will state very strongly that the workers
are part of the University community," Step
hens said. "The administration is trying to
portray the union and the workers as trying
to limit the right of students to work."
The union proposals will not endanger stu
dent employees at any level, Stephens said.
"We don't perceive students as a threat. We
perceive the University's hiring of temporary
workers as a threat."
Stephens also accused the administration
of "misrepresenting" union positions in

Campus Report, the University's weekly
newspaper.
"Our positions are not represented (in that
publication) faithfully," Stephens said.
Stephens also accused the administration
of attempting to rekindle its efforts to bust
the union despite member approval of the
union's actions and the failure of University
attempted legal roadblocks.
And the University pays little attention to
the "human and social" cost paid by workers,
Stephens charged.
"We think the University can afford to pay
its long-term workers what they're due,"
Stephens said.
The University's failure to "bargain in good
faith" is a direct attempt to promote a strike,
he said, although he insisted young union
members are trying to avoid that conse
quence despite the "urgency" of the situa
tion.
"The workers feel nervous without a con
tract," Stephens said, "but what we're trying
to do is prevent a strike."
