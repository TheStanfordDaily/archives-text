## 'Jagged Edge' Carves Elusive Plot of Intrigue 
### GREG WATKINS 
Put simply, "Jagged Edge" is a well-made mystery
thriller. Complete control commands nearly every
aspect of this tight, unassuming production. The
result: a psychologically intriguing movie which pulls
the willing viewer into the pleasant, metered flow of its
plot.
Jeff Bridges stars as newspaper publisher and editor
Jack Forrester, charged with the gruesome murders of
his beautiful, wealthy wife and her maid. The victims
die of multiple stab wounds inflicted with what appears
to be a hunting knife, the kind with a serrated, jagged
edge.
District Attorney Thomas Krasny, recently under
attack in the editorial pages of Forrester's newspaper,
passionately pursues the conviction of his adversary. It is
clear from the beginning that Krasny is driven more by
the political ramifications of a successful prosecution
than by a concern for truth or justice.
Finally, Glenn Close ("Big Chill") plays Forrester's
defense attorney Teddy Barnes, one of the newspa
per's corporate lawyers and formerly a fellow prosecu
tor of Krasny. Forrester persuades Barnes to return
to the world of criminal law, a world that she had at one
time renounced forever, repulsed by its tendencies to
ethical compromise and its vulnerability to the self
serving.

With these three strands, screenwriter Joe
Eszterhas creates a tightly woven drama of mystery
and suspense, a true thriller brought to the screen un
der the clean, clear direction of Richard Marquand
("Return of the Jedi").
The "mystery" in the movie lies solely in the truth
behind Forrester's self-proclaimed innocence. Not only
is that question convincingly left open until the end, but
the movie equally convinces the audiences of different
truths at every step of its progression.
The viewer's search for truth parallels that of Teddy
Barnes. She demands that she remain convinced of
Forrester's innocence throughout the course of the
trial and that he be entirely truthful in his dealings with
her.
Indeed, the success of the psychological drama rests
in part on the viewer's identification with Barnes. To
insure that attachment, the character played by Close
is almost overdone. Barnes is the ideal "woman of the
'80s": independent, loving mother of two, successful
career woman for whom ethical principles come first
. . . in all, it's sometimes too much.
Yet the natural warmth and charisma of Close in it
self sufficientiy creates a positive bond between char
acter and audience. Her affection for Forrester and her
utter distaste for Krasny become ours as we are led
through the dramatic series of conflicting intuitions and
realizations.
Jeff Bridges compliments the depth and personability

of Close's character with the strictly two-dimensional,
and therefore elusive, Forrester; he is as easily a
"monstrous ice-man" as a sincere, warm-hearted hus
band and businessman.
But don't go to "Jagged Edge" expecting a
Hitchcock, as the billing "psychological-mystery
thriller" might suggest. There is nothing brilliant or
even remarkable in its directing, nothing disturbing or
thought-provoking about its plot. For "Jagged Edge" is
the psychological thriller in the era of Lucas' and Spiel
bergs, an era in which the movie has replaced the
amusement park, with its focus on pure effect of every
sort. And just as the movies of today's great directors
are so visually effective, "Jagged Edge" is psychologi
cally effective and nothing more.

It is not surprising then that in the pursuit of pure ef
fect, this film comes out devoid of content. The in
tegrity of our system of justice and of those who make
it work serve as the cultural and dramatic context of
the movie; but context is not content. The movie's
presentation of our system of justice, however accu
rate it may be, serves only as a reference for the
viewer's adoption of sympathies and antipathies. Aside
from providing a fictional case-in-point, "Edge" makes
no comment about such a difficult issue.
"Jagged Edge" will be a respectable success for
reasons indicative of the state of popular American
film. And whatever your opinion of that may be, what
"Jagged Edge" sets out to do is done well. If you want
a bit of pure diversion, don't miss "Jagged Edge."
