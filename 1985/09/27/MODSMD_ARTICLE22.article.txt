# Golden West Dims in VITA Production
## 
### ELAINE WANG 
The Valley Institute of Theatre
Arts (VITA) extends its season
with David Belasco's "The Girl of
the Golden West," not, perhaps,
the happiest choice for a talented
regional troupe.
Set in the California gold rush
days of the 1850s, "The Girl of the
Golden West" is dreadfully sappy.
The spirited and good "Girl" runs
the Polka Saloon as well as the
"academy," where the mining men
are taught to read and write. The
boys, with names like Sonora Slim
and Trinidad Joe, adore her. Sheriff
Jack Ranee pursues her hand in
marriage, but she hangs onto her
vision of the gentleman she once
passed on her trip to Monterey.
That gentleman, Dick Johnson, is
also the road agent Ramirez,
eagerly sought by bounty hunters
and Wells Fargo. He stops into
town intending to rob the saloon,
but falls in love instead. Ramirez
and the Girl rekindle their old, brief
flame, and when he is shot and
wounded, she plays Sheriff Ranee
three hands of poker to determine
his fate. She wins and nurses him to
health, but later, he is recaptured.
The jealous sheriff can't wait to
hang Ramirez, but permits a final
meeting between him and the Girl,

during which she pours out her
feelings for him. The speech is
heard by the boys, who force the
sheriff to let the road agent go free.
If this play were a parody of the
Western, then perhaps it might
pack more punch. Unfortunately,
it's not. Belasco is serious about
the dialogue, and even about the in
sipid moralizing that crops up now
and then. For example, when
everyone refuses to sing "My
Country 'Tis of Thee" the Indi
ans, Billy Jackrabbit and Wowkle
stand and sing it through.
The play, however, has this pro
duction to partially redeem it. Some
of the parts are wrung for all of
their comic potential. William Leslie
Howard plays Billy Jackrabbit, the
Indian in the camp, who says little
and pilfers much anytime he can.
While the most inane conversa
tions go on between the boys, Jack
rabbit steals the audience's atten
tion by sneaking cigars and booze,
then trying to balance bottles and
cups on his corner table.
John Noah Hertzler, so mes
merizing as the Count of Monte
Cristo (an earlier VITA offering),
has perhaps the flattest lines. He
succeeds in looking worldly and
bored, reduced to urgent repeti
tions of "I love you" to the Girl.
In contrast, Taylor Young as
Minnie Smith, alias the Girl, is

overly exuberant. Her part is
overdone, or seems that way be
cause everyone else seems so
deadpan. The Girl is excitable;
feisty. Young is suitably giddy and
ultimately endearing, but it takes a
couple of acts.
David Maier, as the sheriff, has
the most commanding presence in
this production. He is brooding and
rowdy, with a dark energy that isn't

present in any of the other charac
ters.
As usual, VITA picks the appro
priate outdoor setting, this time
Saratoga's Sanborn Park. The
wood stage is rustic and close to
the audience; blankets, cushions
and refreshments are dispensed
from an old barn. If only ... if only
they had picked a better play with
which to recall the Golden West.


Taylor Young plays the "Girl" in the Valley Institute of Theatre
Arts' production of "The Girl of the Golden West." The show
runs through Oct. 13 at the Sanborn Skyline Park, Saratoga.


The patrons of the Polka Saloon play poker to decide a man's
fate in VITA's fall production of "The Girl of the Golden West."
The play, written by Dave Belasco, is directed by Art Manke.
