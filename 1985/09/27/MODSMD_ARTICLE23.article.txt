# Summer Movie Review

### STEVE WARRICK 
Year of the Dragon
"Year of the Dragon" has one of the most stupidly
offensive screenplays in recent memory. Oliver Stone
was responsible for the script of "Scarface" and he also
heaped on the horror in "Midnight Express." This time
Stone and co-writer and director Michael Cimino have
dredged up every macho/racist/sexist cliche from the
Dirty Harry pictures on down and piled them on one
character: Stan White (Mickey Rourke).
White is "the most decorated cop in New York." He
was decorated for service in Vietnam, and now he sees
the corruption in Chinatown as another Vietnam, a war
he has personally vowed to win. Of course, this means
splitting up his marriage, slapping around his girlfriend
and approaching everyone as either an enemy or an ob
stacle in his path of holy vengeance.
Other critics have seen in Stan White the personal
obsessions of Cimino, the director still trying to
overcome the one movie whose title is now
synonymous with "debacle" in film history: "Heaven's
Gate." It's not difficult to see Cimino trying to wring
every ounce of martyrdom out of White.
In the role of the chief villain, drug czar Joey Tai,
John Lone ("Ice Man") walks away with the picture; he
alone seems above the frenetic hyperbole of every
scene.
But poor Mickey Rourke is right down in the mo
rass. After his wife is strangled and stabbed to death
before his very eyes, after he and his girlfriend Tracey
Tzu (played with aggressive incompetence by model
Ariane) have been repeatedly shot at, and after dozens
of bodies have been blown apart all over the screen,
what is White's reaction when he finds out Tracey has
been raped? He says, "They've gone too far this time."
And this time, it is Michael Cimino who has gone too
far.
Silverado
"Silverado" is Lawrence Kasdan's bid to resurrect
the Western. Unfortunately, he seems to have no idea
what direciors like Sam Peckinpah and Robert Altman

did to revolutionize the genre in the '60s and 70s. Like
Kasdan's earlier movie, "Body Heat," "Silverado" is
aimed at a young movie audience that hasn't seen the
classics.
"Silverado" is the most uninspired product yet from
the Kasdan factory. There are lots of dusty, panoramic
shots of horses and riders against big country, right out
of Marlboro ads. And of course all the heroes have
great aim and are fun-loving but noble. Yet audiences
are applauding this pap like it is a great Western, and
the reason may be that the actors are those that we
have loved from previous roles.
Can any movie with Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn,
Danny Glover, Linda Hunt, John Cleese and Jeff
Goldblum be uninvolving? Kasdan pulls it off, by put
ting these shining performers in straight-jacket
stereotypes and juggling them around so each appear
ance seems like a cameo with only a few lines of
dialogue.
I can't think of one thing I liked about the movie. The
big shootout at the end drags on and on, and the final
confrontation between Kline and the chief bad guy
(played by Brian Dennehy) is the standard face-off in an

inexplicably deserted main street. Surely Kasdan could
have put a twist on this tired old chestnut of an ending.
With this film and "Pale Rider," the classic Western
may have just died of old age.
Back to the Future
Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale have a huge hit with
their summer comedy "Back to the Future," and no
one is more deserving than these two. This
writer/director/producer team made three movies in
the late '70s: "I Wanna Hold Your Hand," "1941"
(which they wrote for Steven Speilberg), and "Used
Cars." Each of these was a step forward into a com
pletely original comic sensibility.
"Used Cars" remains their summit achievement; its
distinctive blend of slapstick and satire merges the
screwball comedy routines of an earlier generation of
American filmmakers (Hawks, Sturges et al.) with
modern speed, vulgarity and cynicism.
"Used Cars" creates a nasty P.T. Barnum-inspired
world polarized into swindlers and suckers and as a
completely realized comic vision, it goes too far for
some people. Some friends of mine who hated it
accused it of being too offensively seedy.

"Back to the Future" plays it safer, and in doing so,
gives Zemeckis and Gale the only thing they have
lacked: commercial success.
Amazingly, they have achieved this without sacrific
ing their artistic integrity. At a time when hit comedies
are indifferently scripted, like the multi-million dollar
star vehicles "Ghostbusters" and "Beverly Hills Cop,"
Zemeckis and Gale's ingenious plot mechanisms and
witty dialogue may raise the standards by which mass
audiences judge movies. For these two writers ap
proach comedy as invention; they start with a simple
premise and expand upon it in unexpected yet wholly
logical ways.
"Back to the Future" involves going back to see
what your parents were like as teenagers. From there
Zemeckis and Gale spin off satiric cross-references be
tween the values of American culture in the '80s and
those in the '50s.
They save their best punch line for last; the cult of
the teenage consumer that started in the '50s comes
full circle for Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), who gets
back to the present and finds his parents and siblings
transformed into a Yuppie dream family. The joke is al
most subliminal because Zemeckis and Gale don't rub
our noses in our shallow materialism (the way they did
in "Used Cars'). In a post-Reagan era, this "happy"
ending may have more bite.
These filmmakers set up gags like no one else; they
ave payoffs throughout the movie, and get
progressively wilder and more hyperbolic. The jokes
all play off the comparison of past and present cultures.
In this cinematic whirligig, the characters don't get
much beyond the second dimension, but all the actors
are adept at broad physical comedy.
So "Back to the Future" really represents a step
back for Zemeckis and Gale. I hope it gives them the
commercial credibility to go even futher; as it stands, it
still tops my list of summertime entertainments.
Compromising Positions
Its a relief to see a small, funky adult comedy appear
at the end of the summer, particularly when it's full of

actors who look like they're really having a good time.
And why not? "Compromising Positions" has the kind
of loose, free-floating screenplay (by Susan Isaacs,
from her book) that gives actors natural dialogue
rhythms.
The plot is a standard Secret-Lives-of-Suburan-
Housewives mystery. Yet the performers make it spe
cial. Susan Sarandon is Judith Singer, a bored
housewife with no secret life who starts asking her
neighbors questions about the murder of the lecherous
local dentist. Dr. Bruce Fleckstein Qoe Mantegna).
The fun is in watching Judith push herself into the
confrontations with others who have something to
hide; her adventurousness has been squashed by her
years of marriage, and she's flexing old, underused
muscles (she used to be an investigative journalist).
Sarandon has such a warm, upfront screen personality
that she draws us right into the ocassionally tired situ
ations.
The other actors sketch their personalities with a
few, distinctive lines of dialogue, yet they're fully
drawn and fun to be with. Isaacs and director Frank
Perry keep the whole thing from becoming too sordid
or silly, and avoid the pitfalls of the somewhat redun
dant plot by springing fresh characters on us until the
very end.
The only slip up is the development of Judith's hus
band, played by Edward Herrmann. He's stuck with a
godawful I-need-a-dutiful-wife speech, and there's no
way for his scenes to work after that. It's like Sarandon
and the rest of the movie are in a different world; she
doesn't belong with this man.
