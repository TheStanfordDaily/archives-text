# DIVERSIONS
## MacArthur Park Provides a Superb Synergy of Tastes 
### MARTY KORMAN Staff writer 
We arrived at the lofty, barnlike
structure, and a valet parked my
car. We dined on the delicate and
devoured the hearty. With the aid of
the crayons set before us, we il
lustrated our thoughts on paper
placemats while sipping fine Califor
nia wine. And Mac Arthur Park is
just that kind of restaurant; an
American paradox, as it were.
Eating out on a Monday night, we
neither expected to dine with many
others, nor did we in fact. Or did
we? Although the restaurant was
crowded, it is designed in such a
way that one does not feel
crowded. In the airy and well-lit

PARK

room we were alone at our table for
two, and could dine intimately even
in the midst of such a crowd.
Our waitress arrived tableside
with a cordial and efficient air, and
took our cocktail order. Hand-held
terminals are used to speed orders
instantaneously to bar or kitchen.
These radio terminals give a feeling
of impersonal technology, and seem

to be in a paradoxical contrast to
the building's white-washed but
nonetheless rustic interior.
The drinks arrived, and I was
pleasantly surprised to find that the
grapefruit juice in my "Greyhound"
was freshly squeezed.
We scanned the newly-revised
menu, and found a wide array of ap
petizers, salads, soups and
entrees. For starters, the artichoke
with homemade mayonnaise, onion
strings, cold-grilled tuna, grilled
pusilla peppers and ceviche all
sounded particularly appealing,
while the potato skins presented an
omnipresent alternative. Marc
chose the tuna and I the peppers;
we decided to split the ceviche.
Besides onion soup, a soup du
jour is offered. I opted for that
night's special of New England
clam chowder.
Upon choosing an entree, we had
two decisions to make. First was
the decision between fish, game or
meat. Three varieties of fresh fish
are offered daily as well as live
lobster, grilled shrimp and catfish.
As far as game goes, duck, hen and
rabbit are among the alternatives,
each prepared in its own way with a
special sauce to complement its
natural flavor. Various steaks,
chicken dishes and of course ribs
round out the rest of the menu.
After choosing the sort of animal
we wished to consume, we had to
decide between those dishes that

are oakwood-smoked before being
cooked, and those that are simply
charbroiled over mesquite wood.
Marc ordered the smoked and
charbroiled rib-and-chicken combo,
while my order of Petaluma duck
was zapped to the kitchen.
Although the wine list consisted
only of California wines, it was ex
tensive and well-prepared. Upon
recommendation from our
waitress, we selected a Jordan
Cabernet Sauvignon, 1981.
The tuna and peppers arrived,
and both were aesthetically
prepared. The tuna was lightly

grilled, but was still red and had a
raw consistently, like that of sas
himi. The accompanying tangerine
mustard sauce had a touch of dill,
was very fine, and provided for an
interesting taste sensation when
combined with the nearly raw fish.
The peppers were hot and had a
sauce of three cheeses, one of
which was bleu. At first the strong
taste of the cheese and the heat of
the peppers were overpowering,
but in retrospect, the taste was
unique and quite satisfying.
Next we sampled the ceviche
and New England clam chowder.

Ceviche is a Mexican dish made
from a variety of white fish cured in
lime juice: ours was served with
endive and kiwi fruit. The taste was
plain, for it was not as tangy as we
would have liked it to be.
The chowder was delicate, and
as such was not nearly as hearty as
I had expected. Yellow in color, it
was buttery, and was more like a
French cream of clam than a New
England chowder. Nonetheless,
the soup was exquisite.
Just before main courses arrived,
the waitress tied a bib around
Marc's neck in preparation for his

charbroiled feast. Marc's hearty
portions of ribs and chicken and my
duck then arrived. The ribs were
served with unskinned shoe-string
potatoes that were just crispy
enough, and a side of cole slaw.
The taste was very smokey, and
the meats were embellished with a
relatively mild sauce. A bottle of
tangier sauce accompanied the
dish.
My half-duck was smoked and
served with the skin and the bones
intact. It was divine by itself, and
even better when dipped into the
Lingonberry sauce provided.
The Cabernet was smooth and
surprisingly light. Despite its age,
the taste was complex and
developed. It served as an excel
lent complement to the whole meal
â€” I recommend it highly.
For dessert, we chose Judy's
Mud Pie. "Judy" placed a wedge of
coffee ice cream on top of an oreo
cookie crust, and topped this con
coction with hot fudge and peanuts.
Judy may be decadent, but her pie
is a fantasy!
Not every dish in our meal was
perfect, but by combining diverse
tastes and textures with a unique
environment, Mac Arthur Park
creates a dining experience that is
greater than the sum of its culinary
parts. It is a great place to go with
family and friends to dine in the
"Nouveau American" style.
