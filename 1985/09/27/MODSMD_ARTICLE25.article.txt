# Taste Some Texas Near the Farm

Beat the Texans at their own
game. An evening of Tex-Mex
cuisine at Armadillo Willy's BBQ in
Los Altos will get anyone fired up
for tomorrow's game against the
Longhorns.
The soft pink interior offers a
pleasant refuge from the hectic cor
ner of San Antonio and El Camino
Real. The white-raftered ceiling
coupled with abundant potted cacti
presents a stark, desert-like ap
pearance. Even the jukebox,
playing old Conway Twitty and
Crystal Gayle hits, fits into this
scene.
Margarita machines seem to be a
la mode these days, but Willy's con
coction possesses a potency all its
own. It could be the Cuervo Gold
. . . In addition to margaritas,
Willy's serves sangria, wine and
beer.
To accompany our drinks, we
chose the Nachos ($4.25), smot
hered with beans, cheese,
guacamole, sour cream, salsa and

jalepenos (or maybe it was a double
order of the jalepenos). Willy's also
offers Cadillac Nachos ($5.95), the
same dish topped with bits of Fajita
steak. Our tastebuds were piqued
by then.
We switched to Corona Extra,
one of the several imported beers
on the menu. And with the beer,
who could pass up the Willy's Chili
($3.25)? "No beans about it,"
claims the menu. "Real Texas chili,
cooked the only way Willy would
have it â€” with lots of fresh ground
chuck." But "lots" may be an exag
geration. It's a tasty version of chili,
but definitely lacks a hearty consis
tency. With the chili came a good
old-fashioned corn muffin.
' We also sampled the fresh
guacamole salad ($3.95). This
would be more appropriately placed
with the appetizers as it consisted
of only a sprinkling of lettuce. The
mound of tangy guacamole was
very attractively surrounded with
freshly-cut tomatoes and tortilla
chips.
For an entree Liz decided to try
Willy's special Smoked Pork
Spareribs ($6.95). The meaty ribs
were accompanied by K.C.'s Mas
terpiece Barbecue Sauce, imported

from Kansas City. Perhaps that is
too far to go for a sauce which is not
overly spectacular.

Other barbeque platters include
sliced sirloin, chicken and a combi
nation plate. Willy's beans, corn
bread and potato salad or cole slaw
are offered with these dishes.
Beth selected the chicken Fajitas
A 1 Carbon ($6.95), which is also
available with steak. Soft flour tor
tillas and all the taco fixings are
supplied so diners can roll their
own. Although the chicken may
have been on the dry side, the

abundance of condiments that came
with the dish made the soft tacos
very flavorful.
Armadillo Willy's also features
barbeque sandwiches and a wide
variety of hamburgers ($3.50-
$4.50). From sneaking glances at
nearby tables the portions appeared
to be more than ample. The popular
Just Cut Fries ($1.20) also looked
particularly enticing in their big bas
kets.
And now .... dessert. Allow us
to quote directly from the menu:
"Don't Leave Armadillo Willy's Un
til You've Tried .... Our Famous
Homemade Sweet Potato Pecan
Pie with whipped cream $2.25
(yum)." Circumstances prevailed,
however, causing a pie crust
shortage. The shortage has now re
solved, so let us know how it
tastes.
Armadillo Willy's offers excellent
service, a pleasant ambiance (even
a fire burning in the stone fireplace
in the winter) and tasty Tex-Mex
fare. It is open for lunch and dinner,
and all items on the menu can be or
dered to take home.
So, treat your Texan buddies to a
down-home meal this weekend.
