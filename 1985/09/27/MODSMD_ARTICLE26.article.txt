# Chili Cook-off Warms Up Fans
## 
### SYDNEY SMITH Editorial staff 
Stanfordites await with great anticipation the Texas
invasion this weekend that will fill the campus with
hordes of Longhorn fans, Longhorn penants and Long
horn cheers.
And chili.
In fact, Stanford and Texas will actually unite Satur
day (heaven forbid!) in a celebration of that great food
that is generally considered to originate from Texas —
chili.
Sponsored by the Stanford Athletics Department
and Chili's Restaurant, the First Annual Chili Cook-off
will be held at the Stanford football practice field next
to De Guerre Pool.
Between 8 and 11 a.m. on that fateful day (the
Texans will be nervous), at least 10 teams will sweat
over huge vats of their own special recipes, creating
"the best chili in the world" (there's no accounting for
the human ego).
At 11 a.m., the real blood and guts come in, when se
lected judges will taste the chili to decide which really
is the best in the world (or on the Farm). Among these
important personages will preside The Daily's own
sport editors, Rob Graham and Peter Haven; Chuck
Hildebrand, a sports colunist for the Times Tribune;
and the athletic director of the Texas team.
Three categories will be considered during the
judging: best chili, best costume and best spirit.

After the lucky winners are announced, the Leland
Stanford Junior University Marching Band will play for
the winners and losers alike, to show Texas what we
can do with our instruments.
And what happens to the chili? It goes to anyboy
who wants to sample and, of course, anybody who

wants to buy the world's best chili — all 10 recipes of it.
Come and get it while the getting is good.
And after you have tasted the world's best chili, you
can go see the Cardinal and the Longhorn fight it out on
the field. They may make the best chili, but we'll see
who makes the best quarterback.
