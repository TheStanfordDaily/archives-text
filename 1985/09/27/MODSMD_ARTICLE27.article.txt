## Q & A Time for Spikers 
### ROBERT GRAHAM Editorial Staff 
The second-ranked Stanford women's volley
ball team doesn't quite know what to expect
from the University of Texas in tonight's match
that begins at 7:30 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
And that should be a cause for concern.
First, it's disturbing enough that the Cardinal
can t practice and plan against a certain style of
play. They just don't know what's in store.
Second, and far more troubling, is that Stan
ford does know one thing about Texas — they're
good. Very good.
"We really don't know that much about them,"
Wendi Rush, Stanford's sophomore setter, said
of the N0.6 Longhorns. "But it's going to be a
really good, tough game."
"I've heard nothing but good things about
them," senior Kim Oden said.
But beyond second-hand, hearsay reports,
there isn't much to report about the visitors.
Stanford Co-coach Fred Sturm could only
scratch his head in wonderment, too. "This is a
case where we know next to nothing about the

competition," he said. "We do know they're dan
gerous.
"And we do know that this is part of their trip
to size up West Coast competition," Sturm con
tinued. "They are a legitimate Final Four team."
Sturm could only speculate about the
Longhorns: "The typical Texas team is very
strong at the net. They usually field a strong hit
ting and blocking team."
But that's years past. "From what we've
heard, they've worked hard on their backcourt
game."
If Texas' work has paid off and the visitors
have indeed found a backcourt game to comple
ment their net play, then Stanford will likely have
its hands full.
In any case, the Stanford coaching staff
couldn't shape a game plan to fit the mysterious
Longhorns. "We'll just have to work on controll
ing the ball on our side of the net," Sturm said,
"and not worry so much about what they're
doing. We'll work on our execution. Besides
we'll learn about them during the match."
"As long as we play our game," Oden said,
"we'll be all right."
Rush agreed. "I guess we feel confident going
into the match. If we execute and stick to the

basics, we'll do fine."
That's a big if. Stanford players were not too
thrilled by their play in last weekend's San Jose
Shops Invitational — even though they won. The
Cardinal, last year's NCAA runner-up, was
taken to five sets by both Colorado State and San
Jose State.
"I'm surprised we won that one," Rush said.
"We shouldn't have won — fate must have been
on our side. Our passing was terrible. You would
have thought we were on the floor together for
the first time."
It sure wasn't their first time together, but it
was darn close.
There are three new faces, Nancy Reno,
Teresa Smith and Amy Hayes, in the six-woman
Stanford starting lineup. That makes for at least
three unanswered questions.
"There are a lot of uncertainties out there,"
Rush said. "It just takes time and playing to
gether."
Tonight one of the biggest of those
"uncertainties" will be the Longhorns' play.
They're good, but how good? Big, but how big?
Just like the many lingering questions about the
Stanford team, those questions will be answered
— in time.

It will take another combined effort by Kim Oden and Barbara
Fontana if the Card is to topple N0.6 Texas tonight. Stanford
comes in ranked N0.2.
