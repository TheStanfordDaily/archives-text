# Big Game Now?
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
It's only September, and it's
only a non-conference game, but
tomorrow's 12:42 p.m. clash be
tween Stanford and Texas in Stan
ford Stadium is an extremely im
portant one for the Cardinal foot
ball team.
Why? The biggest reason is
television. CBS-TV will beam the
game into households throughout
the Southwest and the East
Coast, exposing the young, explo
sive, high-scoring Cardinal team
to millions of curious viewers, not
the least of which will be bowl
scouts in search of a product they
can sell to advertisers.
Stanford is just such a product.
The Cardinal has averaged 33.5
points in its first two games while
surrendering an average of 26,
which is perfect for television.
And it features a pair of players —
John Paye and Brad Muster —
who are ready to be hyped wildly
on a national level.
If the Cardinal can pull off an up
set over the Longhorns and look
good doing it, it could conceivably
go 5-3 over the rest of the season,
finish 7-4 and go to a minor bowl.
If it loses to Texas, however,
Stanford would face the nearly
impossible task of going 6-2
against its tough Pacific 10 Con
ference rivals, and it wouldn't
have the same appeal to the bowl
people.
Tomorrow's game will also be
important from the standpoint of
the Cardinal's momentum. Stan
ford is coming off a downer of a
loss to the Ducks in Oregon, and
needs to do well in its first appear
ance before the student body in

order to regain the confidence it
had after its opening romp over
San Jose State.
All right, we know why the
Cardinal has to win. Now, how is it
going to win?
The Longhorns have just what
the doctor didn't order for the
belabored Stanford defense — a
potent rushing attack. In their
opening-game 21-17 win over
Missouri last week, the 'Horns
ripped the Tiger defense for 343
yards on the ground, led by the
112-yard performance of redshirt

freshman tailback Charles Hunter.
That spells trouble for a Card
inal defense that gave up 248
yards on the ground to Oregon
last week. The inexperienced de
fensive line of Sean Scheller, Eric
Volta and Joe Lortie will have to
slow the charge of the imposing
Longhorn line — led by center
Gene "The Coke Machine" Chil
ton — or Hunter and company
could be spending the afternoon in
the Stanford secondary.
Stanford Coach Jack Elway was
impressed by what he saw in the

films of Texas' first game. "In my
mind, that's an awesome running
game," he said. "And I do think
that Missouri is a good defensive
team. Texas has a lot of confi
dence in their people and evi
dently a lot of depth."
You can say that again. Long
horn Coach Fred Akers used 55
players in the first quarter alone
against Missouri, and continually
shuffled the players in his back
field. Senior Todd Dodge and
junior Bret Stafford split the quar
terbacking duties, and Hunter,

Anthony Byerly, Darron Norris
and Eric Metcalf — son of former
St. Louis Cardinals star Terry
Metcalf — all saw a lot of time at
running back.
Part of the reason for the fre
quent shakeups is that Texas is in
the midst of what Akers calls
"another rebuilding year," and he
is taking a look at all of his
available talent. The Longhorns
are a young team, with six fresh
men that have seen action


Offensive workhorse Brad Muster will have to carry another
big load for Stanford tomorrow. Due to CBS-TV's national
coverage of the game, a possible bowl bid could be on the

line for the Card. Bowl officials and fans across the country
will be tuning in to see the high powered Stanford offense in
action.
already, and were picked to
finish anywhere from fifth to
seventh in the Southwestern
Conference in preseason polls.
"I don't disagree with where
we were rated," Akers said. "I
understand it. We have talent,
but we haven't had the chance to
prove it."
The Longhorns' defense will
have a big chance to prove itself
tomorrow, against a Stanford of
fense that ranks first in the Pac
-10. The star of the defense is
right linebacker Ty Allert, whom
Akers calls "one of the best ones
in the country." Allert and
friends will be faced with the dif
ficult job of reading the tricky
multiple-set offense employed
by Elway, holding Muster to
fewer than the 250 total yards
per game he has averaged so far

and shutting down Paye, the
Pac-10 passing leader.
Akers had plenty to say about
Paye, but was silent when it
came to Muster. "I think Paye is
among the best football players
in the country," he said. "He's
got more than just ability. He's
got the confidence that comes
with being a top football player."
And Muster? The nation's
leader in receptions per game?
The workhorse who has carried
the ball 45 times, caught it 25
times and scored six touch
downs? In two games?
No comment. Muster, like
most of the Stanford team, is vir
tually unheard of outside of the
Pac-10.
If nothing else, you can expect
that to change after tomorrow.
And if Stanford wins, and if the
bowl scouts like what they see,
and if the Cardinal keeps playing
well. . • who knows?
Card notes
Except for cornerback Walt
Harris, out with a dislocated el
bow, no Stanford starter will miss
tomorrow's game. Offensive
guards Andy Sinclair and Tom
Nye have been bothered by ankle
problems, but they will play.
After eight years of coaching at
Texas, Akers sports a record of
20-0 during the month of Septem
ber.
Jeff Ward, the kicker who
earned the nickname "Emergency"
by saving Texas from defeat in a
number of games over the past two
years, had a terrible opener. He
missed field goals of 36, 44 and 60
yards.
The San Francisco 49ers showed
up at Stanford yesterday to practice
on the enclosed field behind Maples
Pavilion. Apparently, their own

practice field was a mess.
The kickoff time, as was noted in
the first paragraph, is now 12:42
p.m. That's a change from 12:41,
which was a change from 12:50.
Make your plans accordingly.
