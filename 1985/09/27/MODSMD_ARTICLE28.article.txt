# Big Game Now?
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
It's only September, and it's
only a non-conference game, but
tomorrow's 12:42 p.m. clash be
tween Stanford and Texas in Stan
ford Stadium is an extremely im
portant one for the Cardinal foot
ball team.
Why? The biggest reason is
television. CBS-TV will beam the
game into households throughout
the Southwest and the East
Coast, exposing the young, explo
sive, high-scoring Cardinal team
to millions of curious viewers, not
the least of which will be bowl
scouts in search of a product they
can sell to advertisers.
Stanford is just such a product.
The Cardinal has averaged 33.5
points in its first two games while
surrendering an average of 26,
which is perfect for television.
And it features a pair of players —
John Paye and Brad Muster —
who are ready to be hyped wildly
on a national level.
If the Cardinal can pull off an up
set over the Longhorns and look
good doing it, it could conceivably
go 5-3 over the rest of the season,
finish 7-4 and go to a minor bowl.
If it loses to Texas, however,
Stanford would face the nearly
impossible task of going 6-2
against its tough Pacific 10 Con
ference rivals, and it wouldn't
have the same appeal to the bowl
people.
Tomorrow's game will also be
important from the standpoint of
the Cardinal's momentum. Stan
ford is coming off a downer of a
loss to the Ducks in Oregon, and
needs to do well in its first appear
ance before the student body in

order to regain the confidence it
had after its opening romp over
San Jose State.
All right, we know why the
Cardinal has to win. Now, how is it
going to win?
The Longhorns have just what
the doctor didn't order for the
belabored Stanford defense — a
potent rushing attack. In their
opening-game 21-17 win over
Missouri last week, the 'Horns
ripped the Tiger defense for 343
yards on the ground, led by the
112-yard performance of redshirt

freshman tailback Charles Hunter.
That spells trouble for a Card
inal defense that gave up 248
yards on the ground to Oregon
last week. The inexperienced de
fensive line of Sean Scheller, Eric
Volta and Joe Lortie will have to
slow the charge of the imposing
Longhorn line — led by center
Gene "The Coke Machine" Chil
ton — or Hunter and company
could be spending the afternoon in
the Stanford secondary.
Stanford Coach Jack Elway was
impressed by what he saw in the

films of Texas' first game. "In my
mind, that's an awesome running
game," he said. "And I do think
that Missouri is a good defensive
team. Texas has a lot of confi
dence in their people and evi
dently a lot of depth."
You can say that again. Long
horn Coach Fred Akers used 55
players in the first quarter alone
against Missouri, and continually
shuffled the players in his back
field. Senior Todd Dodge and
junior Bret Stafford split the quar
terbacking duties, and Hunter,

Anthony Byerly, Darron Norris
and Eric Metcalf — son of former
St. Louis Cardinals star Terry
Metcalf — all saw a lot of time at
running back.
Part of the reason for the fre
quent shakeups is that Texas is in
the midst of what Akers calls
"another rebuilding year," and he
is taking a look at all of his
available talent. The Longhorns
are a young team, with six fresh
men that have seen action


Offensive workhorse Brad Muster will have to carry another
big load for Stanford tomorrow. Due to CBS-TV's national
coverage of the game, a possible bowl bid could be on the

Jill Gilbert/Daily file
line for the Card. Bowl officials and fans across the country
will be tuning in to see the high powered Stanford offense in
action.
