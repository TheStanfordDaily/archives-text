# Another Cardinal Road Trip
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
Compared to last week's grueling
East Coast road trip, the Stanford
men's soccer team's swing down to
Cal-Poly San Luis Obispo tomorrow
should be a breeze. At least they
won't have to travel as far.
"We're still suffering from a little
jet lag," Cardinal Head Coach Sam
Koch admits. "But we'll be ready to
play our type of game Saturday
night." Although Cal-Poly sports
a 2-3-1 record, the Mustangs are
comming off a 2-0 victory over UC-
Irvine and may give Stanford some
stiff competition. Koch's team
enters the game 3-4-2 overall
record.
"Last year they played us tough
here," explains Koch. "You have to
remember that most of the teams
we play . . . want to beat us. We're
their big game."
Stanford won that game 3-2. But
this year the game will be on Cal-
Poly's home field. In addition, the
Mustangs return their top scorer
from last year's squad, junior
midfielder Jeff Meyer.
"He's their best player," Koch
said. "We'll be marking him and one
of their forwards."
That forward is sophomore Pat
Dwyer. The young striker leads
Cal-Poly in scoring this year with
two goals.
Stanford will be bringing in some
of its own firepower. Seniors Rob
West, Tom Rafalovich and Angel
Vazquez lead an offense which is
just coming around.
"We had trouble scoring early in
the season," Koch said. "But the
last two games back East finally got
us rolling. We're working in practice
to open up the offense more."
Stanford's attack will be boosted
by the return of forward Giancarlo
