# Fraternities Hit With Res Ed Ire
## Letter cites Orientation violations 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
In a strongly worded letter
delivered Tuesday to the president
of Stanford's Interfraternity Coun
cil, Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Norm Robinson requested an im
mediate IFC investigation into six
possible violations of University
policies, two of which concerned in
trusions on freshmen during Orien
tation last week.
"The 1985-86 academic year has
not yet begun and I fear that frater
nities' behavior is picking up where
it left off last year," Robinson wrote
to IFC President Don Galles.
"Frankly, that is not acceptable."
The University has taken several
steps to ensure that upperclass
men, particularly members of
housed fraternities, leave freshmen
alone for the duration of Orienta
tion.
"It was made clear last year that
the University would no longer
tolerate activities which interfere
with the programs and events of
Orientation," Robinson wrote in his
letter. "All of this was discussed
with fraternity representatives last
year and I had hoped that the
message would have been com
municated clearly and forcefully to
the next generation of fraternity
leaders and members. That ap
pears not to be the case."
Robinson cited two fraternities
that distributed party fliers during
Orientation ir< dormitories where
freshmen reside.
"Fliers obviously aimed at fresh
men advertised a party at the Beta
(Theta Pi) House and were dis

tributed on tables in at least Stern
and Wilbur on Thursday, Sept. 19,
the day on which the freshmen
arrived," Robinson wrote in the let
ter.
The party flier, a Macintosh crea
tion, included the slogans, "Get ori
ented, then come to Betas," and
"Listen to your RA, then come
anyway!"
Robinson wrote, "During the
past academic year, serious ques
tions were raised about the ability
of Beta Theta Pi to control its
events and to develop mechanisms
that would ensure that such control
would be in place. Where was the
group leadership on this?"
In addition to the Betas, the
Kappa Alpha fraternity was cited by
Robinson for interfering with Orien
tation.
Robinson wrote in his letter that
the KA fraternity distributed fliers
Sept. 19 at two residences —
Roble and Lagunita — that house
freshmen. Both dormitories house
upperclassmen as well as fresh
men. In addition, Robinson wrote,
"On Friday evening, the night of
the KA party, students from Kappa
Alpha disrupted the all-Florence
Moore frosh party urging students
to leave Flo Mo and go to the KA
House, where beer was readily
available."
On Sept. 17, Diana Conklin, as
sistant dean of Student Affairs, sent
a letter to all self-ops on the Row,
including Stanford's 12 housed fra
ternities, warning them not to in
terfere with Orientation. Conklin
said examples of interference in
