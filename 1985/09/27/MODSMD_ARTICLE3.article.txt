# Fraternities Hit With Res Ed Ire
## Letter cites Orientation violations 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
In a strongly worded letter
delivered Tuesday to the president
of Stanford's Interfraternity Coun
cil, Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Norm Robinson requested an im
mediate IFC investigation into six
possible violations of University
policies, two of which concerned in
trusions on freshmen during Orien
tation last week.
"The 1985-86 academic year has
not yet begun and I fear that frater
nities' behavior is picking up where
it left off last year," Robinson wrote
to IFC President Don Galles.
"Frankly, that is not acceptable."
The University has taken several
steps to ensure that upperclass
men, particularly members of
housed fraternities, leave freshmen
alone for the duration of Orienta
tion.
"It was made clear last year that
the University would no longer
tolerate activities which interfere
with the programs and events of
Orientation," Robinson wrote in his
letter. "All of this was discussed
with fraternity representatives last
year and I had hoped that the
message would have been com
municated clearly and forcefully to
the next generation of fraternity
leaders and members. That ap
pears not to be the case."
Robinson cited two fraternities
that distributed party fliers during
Orientation ir< dormitories where
freshmen reside.
"Fliers obviously aimed at fresh
men advertised a party at the Beta
(Theta Pi) House and were dis

tributed on tables in at least Stern
and Wilbur on Thursday, Sept. 19,
the day on which the freshmen
arrived," Robinson wrote in the let
ter.
The party flier, a Macintosh crea
tion, included the slogans, "Get ori
ented, then come to Betas," and
"Listen to your RA, then come
anyway!"
Robinson wrote, "During the
past academic year, serious ques
tions were raised about the ability
of Beta Theta Pi to control its
events and to develop mechanisms
that would ensure that such control
would be in place. Where was the
group leadership on this?"
In addition to the Betas, the
Kappa Alpha fraternity was cited by
Robinson for interfering with Orien
tation.
Robinson wrote in his letter that
the KA fraternity distributed fliers
Sept. 19 at two residences —
Roble and Lagunita — that house
freshmen. Both dormitories house
upperclassmen as well as fresh
men. In addition, Robinson wrote,
"On Friday evening, the night of
the KA party, students from Kappa
Alpha disrupted the all-Florence
Moore frosh party urging students
to leave Flo Mo and go to the KA
House, where beer was readily
available."
On Sept. 17, Diana Conklin, as
sistant dean of Student Affairs, sent
a letter to all self-ops on the Row,
including Stanford's 12 housed fra
ternities, warning them not to in
terfere with Orientation. Conklin
said examples of interference in
eluded "engaging new students in
activities, either by going to see
them or by inviting them to events
at your house . . . taking kegs to
houses where freshmen live and to
Orientation activities, directing
party invitations specifically toward
freshmen and timing parties in
such a way that they conflict with
in-house activities planned for new
students by the RAs and RFs of
their houses."
Robinson noted in his letter that
in addition to Conklin's letter, the
fraternities were cautioned by
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano not to interfere with Orien
tation.
Pisano, who assumed the new
administrative position June 1, said
yesterday that he was upset by the
fraternity violations. "I don't under
stand why the freshmen need to be
targeted as a group for (Orientation
Week) parties," he said.
"Freshmen Orientation is just
that — it's for freshmen," he con
tinued. "Any interference is bad."
Pisano said he considers the vio
lations serious, but noted, "I don't
think it's a setback for the entire
year."

IFC President Galles, asked
whether he considered the viola
tions significant, said, "Certainly,"
adding that he was most concerned
with the actions of the Beta Theta
Pi fraternity. He noted, however,
that the cases of interference with
Orientation were isolated incidents
that need to be stopped but not a
"major disruption of Orientation"
effected by the entire fraternity
system.
Galles, a member of the Delta
Kappa Epsilon (Deke) fraternity,
said the IFC will discuss the viola
tions in an executive committee
meeting today and a full IFC
meeting next week. Robinson re
quested a report on the IFC investi
gation by Oct. 4, and Galles said
that report, including recommen
dations for "retribution or action to
be taken," will be delivered on
time.
And Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons addressed the six inci
dents before the ASSU Senate last
night.
While Stanford has not seen "the
kind of 'hell-raising' behavioral is
sues that were troublesome to
many schools," Lyons said the six
incidents leave him "afraid and very
troubled that behavioral issues are
really going to get into the way of
the long-range liability of the frater
nal organizations."

But "as far as we can see, it's
only a few residential fraternities"
that "seem to have the ability . . .
to really be their own worst
enemies," Lyons said.
The following are the four other
fraternity violations listed by Robin
son:
• "Two students, from different
residential fraternities, broke a
door at Toyon Hall on Tuesday,
Sept. 17.
• "On Wednesday, Sept. 18, the
police arrested a resident of the
Theta Delt House for taking a chair
from the Arroyo Lounge.
• "A large sign from a campus con
struction project was stolen, and
subsequently returned only after a
police officer visited the Sigma Chi
House.
• "On Monday, Sept. 23, police
visited the (Sigma Alpha Epsilon)
House three times between 11:30
p.m. and 1:30 a.m. to ask that the
music at a very large party be
turned down. They received no
cooperation and had to unplug the
stereos themselves."
In an interview yesterday, Rob
inson said, "It looks like it will
either be a very long year or a very
short year for fraternities."
