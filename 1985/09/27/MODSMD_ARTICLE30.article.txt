# Card field hockey
## Not Just a Bunch of Fruits 
### MARK SMOYER 
Despite the fact that the coach's
office is covered with tin foil, and
despite the fact that each player is
nicknamed after a vegetable, spice
or piece of fruit, field hockey at
Stanford is no joking matter.
Tomorrow the team, which is
picked to win the Northern Pacific
Conference, will start its NorPac
season with some serious competi
tion at the University of the Pacific
in Stockton.
The Card, whose record is 1-2,
is hoping to improve on its current
No. 19 national ranking with the
release of next week's poll.
Stanford's first three matches,
which took place in Norfolk, Vir
ginia last week, pitted the Cardinal
against three other highly ranked
squads, including No.l Old
Dominion. The Lady Monarchs

squeezed out their toughest win of
the young season with a 4-2 victory
over the Card. For most of the
game, Stanford managed to main
tain a 2-2 tie.
First year Head Coach Sheryl
Johnson, assistant coach last year
and a member of the 1984 U.S.
Olympic team, spoke with cautious
confidence about tomorrow's game.
Johnson, citing a 1-0 loss to UOP
during pre-season, said the Card
inal must play "our game ... a
more aggressive game" than in the
previous match.
And what is "our game"?
"Real balanced," Johnson said.
No one woman scores all the
goals for this team. The offense
evolves from the center play of
senior co-captain Karen "Celery"
Chamberlain and junior Andi
"Acorn" Wolpert. Both Chamber
lain and Wolpert were West
Regional All-America and All-

NorPac last year. Their job is to
control the ball at midfield and
direct it up to the forwards in
scoring positon through a passing
stressed offense, Johnson said.
A strong defense will do their
best to keep frosh goalkeeper
Karen "Huckleberry" Jones bored
in the cage. Quarterbacking the
defense will be senior sweeper and
co-captain Suzanne "Plum" Doi.
Both Jones and freshman Laura
"Banzo" (as in garbanzo) Gartland
called Doi "the backbone" of the de
fensive corps.
Last year, the Cardinal field
hockey team finished No. 14 in the
polls, missing by two places a berth
in the NCAA playoffs. Assessing
the future for this year's squad, Doi
said the team has "a very good
chance" of making the playoffs.
"We're an experienced team. We
work well together. We enjoy each
other."
