## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff writer 
A national No. 1 ranking, a 6-0 record and a champi
onship in last weekend's UC-Irvine Tournament may
not guarantee victories this weekend for the Stanford
water polo team, but the talent of the team will cer
tainly be a big help, according to Coach Dante Detta
manti.
"I am very pleased with the way the team is
progressing," Dettamanti said. "After our performance
last weekend I feel the team is exactly where it should
be at this point in the season, or even a little better.
Entering this weekend's matches, I couldn't ask for
more."
The Cardinal will be on the road all weekend, com
peting against Fresno State today at 3 p.m. and at the
University of Pacific (11 a.m.) and UC-Davis (3 p.m.)
tomorrow.
Although all of the matches will be non-conference,
this weekend's competition will nonetheless be very
important in determining the Cardinal's ability to main
tain its No. 1 ranking.
Stanford played all three teams last season, defeat
ing UOP twice (11-5, 7-6) and UC-Davis once (15-1).
In the three-match Stanford-Fresno series, the Card

inal came out on top twice (4-3 and 7-6) and lost once
(7-4).
According to Dettamanti, Fresno will most likely be
the toughest competition the team faces this weekend.
Fresno has a history of causing trouble for the Cardinal,
and Dettamanti is prepared for nothing less than that
today.
Fresno closed out the 1984 season with a 16-6-2
record overall and placed third in the Pacific Coast Ath
letic Association Championships.
The Bulldogs will be led this year by second team
All-American John Diepersloot and goalie Steve
Coupland.
So far this season the Cardinal has been paced by a
very balanced offensive attack. Juniors Craig Klass and
David Imbernino lead the ranks with 16 and 10 goals,
respectively, followed by Jamie Velez with seven and
Matt Tingler, Erich Fisher and Marvin Mouchawar with
five each.
Stanford's freshmen have also been proving them
selves to be well adjusted for collegiate play. Jeff
Oeding scored four goals in last weekend's tournament
and Andrew Lawson added two.
Stanford students will get their first chance to watch
the No. 1 polo team in action next weekend as the
Cardinal hosts the Northern Cal Tournament October
4-5.
