# TCU Football Under Fire
## Recruiting Probe Goes On 
### 
FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) â€”
The probe into the Texas Christian
University recruiting scandal con
tinued yesterday as the NCAA in
vestigator met with a school
booster and tried to glean more in
formation from reluctant football
players suspended for taking cash.
Dick Lowe, the Fort Worth oil
man and TCU alumnus who ad
mitted making cash payments to
several players, said yesterday he
had a brief and "amicable" meeting
with investigator Bob Minnix.
But Lowe declined to discuss
details of their talk, saying Minnix
had asked him to keep it confiden
tial.
He said Minnix gave no indication
on what kind of punishment the
school could expect from its
players' admitted violations of
NCAA rules.

"lt was a very amicable meeting.
He was very courteous," Lowe
said.
David Berst, the NCAA's direc
tor of enforcement in Kansas City,
declined to say how long Minnix
would be in Fort Worth conducting
the inquiry.
"I'm simply not willing to get into
the details of any of our investiga
tions," he said. "Self-disclosure is a
mitigating factor in determining
what action to take. But I am not in
a position to speculate on what may
happen in this njatter."
The TCU players who admitted
taking money turned themselves in
to coach Jim Wacker, who
suspended them from the team.
The school reported the situation to
the NCAA.
Berst did say, however, that
some recent published reports of a

request by the Internal Revenue
Service for information from the
NCAA about wealthy school
boosters is not directly tied to the
TCU probe.
"There has been a preliminary
meeting about whether there was
any possibility of our office
cooperating with IRS officials in
their interests. But that meeting
occurred some four to six months
ago and has nothing to do with any
particular investigation at all,"
Berst said.
The IRS has expressed an inter
est in finding out whether wealthy
school supporters are taking illegal
tax deductions by reporting their
payments to athletes as charitable
contributions.
Berst said no decision has been
made about making such confiden

tial NCAA information available to
the IRS.
Lowe said he isn't worried about
any trouble from the IRS because
he never claimed his payments as
deductions.
"To claim them as deductions,
you have to keep records," he said.
According to published reports,
the players were worried about the
future of their athletic scholarships,
which university officials have said
they can keep despite being
dropped from the team.
The players who were
suspended are running back Ken
neth Davis, linebacker Gearld
Taylor, defensive end Gary Spann,
defensive tackle Darron Turner,
safety Egypt Allen, defensive back
Marvin Foster and tight end Ron
Zell Brewer.
