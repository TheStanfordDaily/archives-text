# USC, UCLA Running More
## 
### 
From the Associated Press
Running is the key word for 13th-ranked UCLA and No. 18 South
ern Cal as they open their Pacific-10 Conference college football
schedules tomorrow against Washington and Arizona State,
respectively.
UCLA ran 64 times in its 34-16 win over San Diego State last
week. It was the most times the Bruins have rushed the ball since
they ran it 91 times against Oregon in 1979, and the trend should
continue.
In addition to its running attack, the Bruins, 2-0-1, have an aerial
threat for the game in Seattle. UCLA Coach Terry Donahue has
named senior David Norrie as his starter after he performed well
against San Diego State.
Washington is 1-2 going into its conference opener, but the
Huskies are coming off a strong 29-12 win over Houston in which
Coach Don James went with five new starters.
Freshman tailback Vince Weathersby rushed 22 times for 99 yards
and one touchdown in his first start to spark Washington's running
game against Houston. Weathersby also had seven receptions for 37
yards.
Meanwhile, Southern Cal Coach Ted Tollner is concerned about
his team's running game as the Trojans, 1-1, go into tomorow night's
game against Arizona State at Tempe, Ariz.
After Southern Cal's non-conference win over Illinois, the Trojans
gained only 153 yards on the ground in a 20-13 upset loss to Baylor
last week.
Quarterback Sean Salisbury accounted for 21 net yards and had
the longest run for his team, a 15-yard jaunt.
"The run blocking was sporadic," Tollner said early this week.
"That's very disappointing because that is the strength of our team.
We can't afford to be sporadic with our run."
Tollner is looking for strong performances this week from tail
backs Fred Crutcher and Ryan Knight, who run behind an offensive
line that averages 6-foot-5 and 270 pounds.
Arizona State, at 1-1, opened up its passing game last week and
gave Pacific a 27-0 drubbing. Quarterback Jeff Van Raaphorst com
pleted 18 of 27 pass attempts for 267 yards and two touchdowns. It
was the eighth consecutive time
Van Raaphorst passed for more
than 200 yards.
Arizona State tailback Darryl
Clack, who sat out the second half
of the Pacific game with a strained
knee, is expected to return at full
speed for the Sun Devils' confer
ence opener against the Trojans.
And Southern Cal may have diffi
culty putting points on the board.
The Sun Devils have not allowed a
touchdown pass in the first two
games. And they've gone the last
seven quarters without allowing a

touchdown.
Meanwhile undefeated Arizona,
3-0 overall and 2-0 in the Pac-10,
will square off against Colorado in
Tucson, Ariz., in a non-league
game Saturday. Arizona has relied
heavily on the toe of place-kicker
Max Zendejas for its wins.
Washington State will meet fifth
ranked Ohio State in Columbus,
Ohio; Oregon will take the field
against No. 16 Nebraska in Lincoln,
Neb., and Oregon State will take on
Grambling in Shreveport, La., in
other games involving Pac-10
teams. California is idle.
Even though it is still too early to
call it, four contenders have already
emerged in the race for the Pac

10's Most Valuable Player Award,
an honor that was shared by former
Stanford quarterback John Elway
and UCLA signal-caller Tom Ram
sey in 1982.
The four are Stanford's Brad
Muster and John Paye, WSU's Mark
Rypien and OSU's Reggie Bynum.
On the Farm, Muster has
managed to lead the Pac-10 in all
purpose running. He also is second
in receptions, receiving yardage
and scoring. He and teammate John
Paye are two reasons Stanford is at
the top of the total offense stats in
the conference.
Paye is first in total offense and
passing, just nosing out WSU's
Rypien on both accounts.

Rypien, in his own, is also second
in the league in passing efficiency
with a 169.8 ranking. He is behind
Salisbury of USC (154.2) and ahead
of Paye (145.4).
Finally, OSU's Reggie Bynum
leads the league in receptions (28),
receiving yardage (406) and points
scored (42).
Ironically, the four men play for
teams with a combined 4-5 record.
In Pacific Coast Athletic Associa
tion play, Long Beach State, 1-2
overall and 0-1 in league action, will
meet Nevada-Las Vegas, 1-2 over
all and 0-1 in the league, in Las
Vegas, Nev., and Utah State, 2-1
overall and 2-0 in conference play,
will face Pacific, 1-2.

Tollner is looking for strong performances this week from tail
backs Fred Crutcher and Ryan Knight, who run behind an offensive
line that averages 6-foot-5 and 270 pounds.
Arizona State, at 1-1, opened up its passing game last week and
gave Pacific a 27-0 drubbing. Quarterback Jeff Van Raaphorst com
pleted 18 of 27 pass attempts for 267 yards and two touchdowns. It
was the eighth consecutive time
Van Raaphorst passed for more
than 200 yards.
Arizona State tailback Darryl
Clack, who sat out the second half
of the Pacific game with a strained
knee, is expected to return at full
speed for the Sun Devils' confer
ence opener against the Trojans.
And Southern Cal may have diffi
culty putting points on the board.
The Sun Devils have not allowed a
touchdown pass in the first two
games. And they've gone the last
seven quarters without allowing a

touchdown.
Meanwhile undefeated Arizona,
3-0 overall and 2-0 in the Pac-10,
will square off against Colorado in
Tucson, Ariz., in a non-league
game Saturday. Arizona has relied
heavily on the toe of place-kicker
Max Zendejas for its wins.
Washington State will meet fifth
ranked Ohio State in Columbus,
Ohio; Oregon will take the field
against No. 16 Nebraska in Lincoln,
Neb., and Oregon State will take on
Grambling in Shreveport, La., in
other games involving Pac-10
teams. California is idle.
Even though it is still too early to
call it, four contenders have already
emerged in the race for the Pac

10's Most Valuable Player Award,
an honor that was shared by former
Stanford quarterback John Elway
and UCLA signal-caller Tom Ram
sey in 1982.
The four are Stanford's Brad
Muster and John Paye, WSU's Mark
Rypien and OSU's Reggie Bynum.
On the Farm, Muster has
managed to lead the Pac-10 in all
purpose running. He also is second
in receptions, receiving yardage
and scoring. He and teammate John
Paye are two reasons Stanford is at
the top of the total offense stats in
the conference.
Paye is first in total offense and
passing, just nosing out WSU's
Rypien on both accounts.

Rypien, in his own, is also second
in the league in passing efficiency
with a 169.8 ranking. He is behind
Salisbury of USC (154.2) and ahead
of Paye (145.4).
Finally, OSU's Reggie Bynum
leads the league in receptions (28),
receiving yardage (406) and points
scored (42).
Ironically, the four men play for
teams with a combined 4-5 record.
In Pacific Coast Athletic Associa
tion play, Long Beach State, 1-2
overall and 0-1 in league action, will
meet Nevada-Las Vegas, 1-2 over
all and 0-1 in the league, in Las
Vegas, Nev., and Utah State, 2-1
overall and 2-0 in conference play,
will face Pacific, 1-2.
