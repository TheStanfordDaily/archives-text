Running is the key word for 13th-ranked UCLA and No. 18 South
ern Cal as they open their Pacific-10 Conference college football
schedules tomorrow against Washington and Arizona State,
respectively.
UCLA ran 64 times in its 34-16 win over San Diego State last
week. It was the most times the Bruins have rushed the ball since
they ran it 91 times against Oregon in 1979, and the trend should
continue.
In addition to its running attack, the Bruins, 2-0-1, have an aerial
threat for the game in Seattle. UCLA Coach Terry Donahue has
named senior David Norrie as his starter after he performed well
against San Diego State.
Washington is 1-2 going into its conference opener, but the
Huskies are coming off a strong 29-12 win over Houston in which
Coach Don James went with five new starters.
Freshman tailback Vince Weathersby rushed 22 times for 99 yards
and one touchdown in his first start to spark Washington's running
game against Houston. Weathersby also had seven receptions for 37
yards.
Meanwhile, Southern Cal Coach Ted Tollner is concerned about
his team's running game as the Trojans, 1-1, go into tomorow night's
game against Arizona State at Tempe, Ariz.
After Southern Cal's non-conference win over Illinois, the Trojans
gained only 153 yards on the ground in a 20-13 upset loss to Baylor
last week.
Quarterback Sean Salisbury accounted for 21 net yards and had
the longest run for his team, a 15-yard jaunt.
"The run blocking was sporadic," Tollner said early this week.
"That's very disappointing because that is the strength of our team.
We can't afford to be sporadic with our run."
Tollner is looking for strong performances this week from tail
backs Fred Crutcher and Ryan Knight, who run behind an offensive
line that averages 6-foot-5 and 270 pounds.
Arizona State, at 1-1, opened up its passing game last week and
gave Pacific a 27-0 drubbing. Quarterback Jeff Van Raaphorst com
pleted 18 of 27 pass attempts for 267 yards and two touchdowns. It
