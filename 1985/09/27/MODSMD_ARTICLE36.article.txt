Soviet With KGB Ties Defects
WASHINGTON — A Soviet diplomat who reportedly was a senior
officer of the KGB intelligence service has defected to the United
States after disappearing while on a trip to Rome last month, U.S. in
telligence and diplomatic sources said yesterday.
The sources confirmed reports that Vitaly Dzhurtchenko, who
held the rank of counselor with the Soviet Foreign Minis try, has been
cooperating with the Central Intelligence Agency since shortly after
his disappearance Aug. 1.
The sources also said he is understood to have been a KGB official
or at least familiar with KGB operations in such areas as Western
Europe and Latin America. The sources were unable to say where
Dzhurtchenko is.
They also declined to speculate about what effects his potential in
formation might have on Soviet intelligence activities, and they
professed no knowledge of speculation that his disappearance might
have triggered the recent rash of other defections between East and
West.
Dzhurtchenko, who went to Rome in late July, vanished after os
tensibly going to see Vatican museums. His disappearance went
largely unnoticed in this country.
Reagan Seeks Concrete Proposal
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administration yesterday called
upon Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze to bring
"concrete" proposals for arms reductions to the White House tomor
row, and a senior official said President Reagan would be
"disappointed" if Shevardnadze fails to do so.
Robert McFarlane, the president's national security affairs advi
ser, briefed reporters yesterday on the Shevardnadze-Reagan
encounter. "We surely would welcome a concrete proposal that
would be put forward in the spirit of give and take," McFarlane said.
But he indicated no give in the Administration's insistence that it
will go ahead with active research on a missile defense system for
mally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) and commonly
called "Star Wars."
Congressional sources quoting Soviet officials have said they ex
pect Shevardnadze to propose a 40 percent reduction in the nuclear
arsenals of both the United States and the Soviet Union in return for
"significant" limitations on the SDI that would prevent it from
growing beyond the stage of fundamental research.
Sikhs Score Dramatic Win
NEW DELHI, India — The Sikh party Akali Dal scored a dramatic
victory over the Congress-I of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in yes
terday's election in the Punjab, winning the right to form a govern
ment in the state, official returns showed this morning.
It was the first outright victory ever for the Akali Dal, which
represents moderate Sikh forces in the troubled Punjab, the scene of
more than four years of bloody conflict sparked by Sikh extremists
who want an independent homeland for India's 15 million Sikhs.
Still-incomplete returns indicate that the Akali Dal won at least 70
of the 117 seats in the State Assembly and a majority of the state's
13 contested seats in Parliament. In previous elections, the Akali Dal
had never won more than 58 assembly seats.
Sikhs outnumber Hindus in Punjab, and normally account for 55
percent to 60 percent of the vote, but election analysts said yester
day night that according to computer studies, many Hindus broke
with precedent and voted for Akali Dal candidates.
Despite the poor showing by the Congress-I, the outcome was
something of a victory for Gandhi, too, for the Akali Dal had sup
ported the Punjab peace agreement that Gandhi signed in July with
the Akali Dal leader Sant Harchand Singh Longowal. Longowal was
assassinated by Sikh terrorists in August.
Sikh extremists in Punjab, India's richest agricultural state,
promptly called for a boycott of the election. But their call was
ignored as more than 60 percent of the state's 10 million-plus voters
flocked to the polls Wednesday in a defiant assertion of Indian
democracy. <
Canada Seeks Trade Agreement
TORONTO — Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, putting
forth the most important proposal of his young government, 'told
Parliament yesterday that he has asked President Reagan to open
negotiations on a free trade agreement between the two nations.
The statement climaxed lengthy consideration by Mulroney and
his ruling Progressive Conservative Party over how to enhance
trade between the two nations, which is expected to reach $150 bil
lion this year, and to guarantee access for Canadian goods to the
American market.
It also started a process that is expected to generate intensive
debate in Canada. Free trade has always been a controversial issue
here.
Earlier free trade proposals have been rejected, and the politicians
who advanced them have usually been defeated at the polls in the
face of opposition arguments that free trade would bind Canada too
tightly to decisions made in the United States.
Canada's present trade relationship with the United States is
based on multilateral rules laid down under the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade, plus a variety of bilateral agreements.
Aquino Murder Trial Ends
MANILA, Philippines — The special court trying the 26 accused in
the murder of Benigno Aquino Jr. ended the trial yesterday and said
it would announce its verdict by January.
The three-judge panel decided to end the proceedings after
prosecutors gave up a last chance to rebut defense witnesses and
evidence, claiming it was a "futile exercise."
The presiding justice, Manuel Pamaran, gave prosecution and
defense lawyers 20 days to submit their summary of evidence.
The court, called the Sandiganbayan, for the past seven months
has heard arguemnts for and against the accused, 17 of whom were
named by a fact-finding board as principals. Armed forces chief Gen.
Fabian Ver, a relative of and top aide to President Ferdinand Marcos,
was one of eight defendants named as accessories.
Gen. Ver and his co-defendants, including Manila Police Chief
Prospero Olivas, are almost certain to be exonerated, following re
jection by the special court of the only available evidence against
them.
