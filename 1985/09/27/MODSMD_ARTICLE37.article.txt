# 200,000 flee as Gloria Storms In
## 
### 
More than 200,000 beach dwellers fled their
houses in North Carolina, Virginia and Maryland
yesterday as Hurricane Gloria moved toward the
coast, packing sustained winds of 130 mph. The
storm's leading edge was threatening to touch
land early today between Morehead City and
Cape Hatteras, N.C., but hurricane warnings
extended from Little River Inlet, S.C., north to
Plymouth, Mass.
Tides and winds surged dramatically and
heavy rain pelted the Maryland and Virginia
coastlines. In Ocean City, Md., last night, resi
dents of high-rise, ocean-front buildings were
asked to take shelter inland. Rehoboth Beach
and other Sussex County, Del., communities
along the coast were also being evacuated.
Virginia Gov. Charles Robb declared a state of
emergency for his state's Tidewater region and
inland areas that could be flooded. Evacuations
were under way in the low-lying areas of Nor
folk, Virginia Beach, Chesapeake and
Portsmouth.
Director Neil Frank, of the National Hurricane
Center near Miami, described Gloria as "a strong
and dangerous storm."
Robert Muller, chief meteorologist at the Na
tional Weather Service Forecasting Center at the
Raleigh-Durham Airport, said, "If this storm
continues on this track, we're looking at another
Hazel." The 1954 hurricane killed 95 people with
a 17-foot tidal surge and 115 mph winds along
the North Carolina coast.

As Hurricane Gloria moved along the coast
yesterday, forecasters stressed they could not
pinpoint where the storm would hit hardest.
"The highest probability right now is that the
storm will touch down on the Carolina coast, but
if it doesn't, it has nowhere else to go but further
north, anywhere from Ocean City, Md., in the

south to New York City and eastern Long Island
to the north," said one forecaster, who asked
not to be identified.
What worried forecasters most about Gloria
was its size and the extent of its strongest
winds. The storm covered a region of the Atlan
tic the size of the Gulf of Mexico. Its hurricane
force winds — in excess of 75 mph — extend at
least 150 miles from the center of the storm on
the east and northeast side, unusually large for a
hurricane.
"On Wednesday, the storm had a 10-mile-wide
eye," Frank said. "Today, the eye has spread
out to about 25 miles, which means the arms (of
the strongest wind) spiraling out of that eye are
spread out, too." Last night, the leading edge of
the hurricane was about 200 miles south of Cape
Hatteras, and it appeared that Gloria's leading
edge would strike eastern North Carolina about
8 a.m. today.
Yesterday, however, the hurricane turned to
the north from its previous north-by-northwest
track and the possibility existed that Gloria could
veer again, moving on a track toward Long Is
land, N.Y., as it crossed colder water and picked
up speed from its southwesterly steering winds.
Late Thursday, gale-force winds fed by the
hurricane were whipping up the seas along the
North Carolina coast. Making matters worse was
the moon, which was almost full yesterday and
causing tides to rise at a time when the storm
was pushing out 6-foot surges.
