# Saudis To Purchase British Arms
## 
### 
LONDON â€” Saudi Arabia yes
terday initialed an agreement to
purchase 132 British-made combat
jets and trainers in a multibillion dol
lar arms package that British
Defense Minister Michael Heseltine
called "the largest export negotia
tions this country has ever con
cluded."
The agreement, signed here by
Heseltine and Saudi Defense Mini
ster Prince Sultan Bin Abdul Aziz,
is worth at least $4.5 billion. British
Aerospace, the principal manufac

turer, said yesterday that 25,000 to
30,000 jobs had been saved on
aircraft production lines.
The order is significantly larger
than anticipated and includes 72
Tornado combat jets and 60 Hawk
and PC-9 trainers. In last-minute
negotiations concluded this week,
the Saudis asked for another 24
Tornados in the "air defense" con
figuration to be added to 48 Tor
nado ground-attack planes originally
discussed.
The inclusion of the additional

aircraft indicated that the Saudis
have dropped all plans to buy U.S.-
made F-15 fighters for the for
seeable future. Officials said here
yesterday they were not even sure
if the Saudis could absorb all the
British planes, which are scheduled
for delivery between next year and
1989.
The early delivery dates mean
that Britain will have to delay com
pletion of its own Royal Air Force
modernization program, since two
Tornado squadrons currently in

production for the RAF will now
comprise the first delivery of about
20 planes to the Saudis.
"The important thing is that this
is an extremely important export
opportunity," said British Aero
space Corp. Chairman Austin
Pearce, "and that means more jobs
in this country."
In recent high-level exchanges,
the White House informed the
Saudis that it would not object
should they decide to look else
where for the planes.
