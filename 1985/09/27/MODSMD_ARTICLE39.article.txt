Farm Subsidies Kept
WASHINGTON — The Democratic
controlled House, with help from Republican
defectors, handed the Administration major
setbacks yesterday by defeating floor efforts
to scale down dairy and sugar price-support
sections of a new farm bill.
The Administration had joined with con
sumer advocates in a lobbying effort to revamp
both the dairy and sugar provisions of the
Agriculture Committee's bill, but each was
defeated by surprisingly large margins on roll
call votes.
Agriculture Secretary John Block called the
votes "regrettable." He said, "To perpetuate
current policies that have clearly failed, is a
tragedy. American farmers are the biggest
losers in today's House action."
House Curbs Imports
WASHINGTON — The House Ways and
Means Committee yesterday ignored Presi
dent Reagan's efforts to forestall protectionist
legislation and approved a bill that would curtail
textile imports by as much as 40 percent. The
bill is being pushed by a strong labor
management coalition from the textile and ap
parel industry.
The Reagan Administration has indicated it
will veto the textile measure or any bill to
which it is attached, even if it means rejecting
legislation the White House eagerly seeks.
The bill would affect 12 major exporting

countries — all Third World nations, largely in
Asia. The three leading exporting nations are
Taiwan, Korea and Hong Kong. Textiles from
Western Europe and Canada will not be
touched despite recent increases in shipments
of clothing from those countries.
Senate OKs Superfund
WASHINGTON — Despite the threat of a
White House veto over funding provisions, the
Senate voted 86 to 13 yesterday to expand the
Superfund toxic-waste cleanup program nearly
fivefold and levy a new tax on manufactured
goods to pay for it.
Its passage, however, was quickly criticized
by environmental lobbyists, who contend it is
inadequately funded and includes major
retreats from the current law's strict stand
ards of liability for toxic pollution.
Earlier this week, lawmakers narrowly
rejected one of the bill's most controversial
provisions, an experimental project to com
pensate victims of exposure to toxic contami
nation for their medical expenses. The Admin
istration and industry groups strongly opposed
the provision, fearing it would lead to an open
ended entitlement program.
AIDS Projects Funded
WASHINGTON — The nation's top public
health officials yesterday asked Congress for
an additional $70 million in AIDS funding for

fiscal 1986, primarily for research into new
drug therapies and the development of a
vaccine.
Researchers have said that a successful
AIDS treatment must both prevent the virus
from reproducing in human cells and must
restore the impaired immune system. At least
six anti-viral drugs are being studied.
In a related story from Hollywood, actress
Elizabeth Taylor announced the formation yes
terday of a national AIDS foundation to solicit
private donations and funnel the money to re
searchers hunting for a cure to the deadly
virus.
Taylor, who will serve as national chairman
of the Los Angeles-based American Founda
tion for AIDS Research, said it "will emerge as
the national organization to support research
with the staying power to attract adequate
financing and resources from the private sec
tor ."
Announcement of the new foundation, which
has been described by its proponents as an
AIDS equivalent of the American Cancer Soci
ety, came at a press conference in West Holly
wood. ,
Stocks Finish Mixed
NEW YORK — Stocks posted mixed results
in moderate trading yesterday, with the
broader market failing to move ahead with
blue-chip and oil issues.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
rose 8.74 to 1,320.79, recovering most of its
9.07-point loss from the previous session.
