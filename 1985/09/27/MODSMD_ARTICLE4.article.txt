# Warning on drinking games
## University Thumps 'Quarters' 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
"Quarters" may soon mean money,
"Thumper" may soon mean bunny, and
"Cardinal Puff' may soon be only a
mixed-up memory from a Sunday school
class if Residential Education has its
way.
The popular drinking games are the
latest targets in the department's on
going battle against alcohol abuse among
students. Beginning this year, Residen
tial Education is instructing resident as
sistants to try to curb all forms of com
petitive drinking in on-campus
residences.
Alice Supton, assistant dean of Resi
dential Education, said she sees the

move as a simple application of existing
University alcohol policy to drinking
games like "Quarters," in which players
try to bounce a coin off a table top and
into a beer-filled cup. If a player
succeeds in sinking the coin, he may
force another player to "chug" the con
tents of the cup.
Because drinking games necessarily
focus on drinking, they are by their very
nature inconsistent with University
policy, which requires that alcohol "not
be the focus" of an event, Supton said.
Under the new guidelines, printed in
the latest version of the RA handbook on
alcohol and drug use, RAs are asked to
explain to students the dangers of drink
ing games, to ask students to stop drink
ing games already in progress and to

refrain from playing the games them
selves.
Supton stressed, however, that RAs
"are not expected to take the quarters
out of the students' hands," biit merely
to request that students stop playing
games in progress and then report any
refusals to the appropriate resident fel
low.
"The decision, as always at Stanford,
is in the hands of the student," Supton
said. But, she added, "the student is
urged to make responsible choices."
The RA handbook, prepared by Resi
dential Education, states that drinking
games are dangerous because they
make players overly susceptible to peer
pressure and because they often force
players to drink large amounts of alcohol

in a short period of time.
In recent years, Residential Education
has stepped up its battle against alcohol
abuse, first requring that equally attrac
tive alternatives to alcohol be served at
campus functions, then prohibiting alco
hol at University-sponsored freshman
orientation events and finally asking
local liquor stores to refrain from
delivering to under-age students.
The department has also encouraged
groups to de-emphasize alcohol in other
ways, especially by using non-alcoholic
euphemisms like "Picnics" for
"Tailgaters" and "Blender Smoothie
Study Breaks" for "Daiquiri Parties."
Residential Education officials have
said, however, that they have no plans
to ban alcohol completely in residences.
