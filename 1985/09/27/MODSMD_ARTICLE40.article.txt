Deuk Signs Workfare
SACRAMENTO — Flanked by legislators of
both parties, Gov. George Deukmejian yester
day signed legislation to require able-bodied
welfare recipients to look for work, join a job
training program or take public service jobs to
keep their grants.
The "workfare" plan, which will be phased
in over five years, will affect an estimated
175,000 of California's 2.3 million welfare
recipients — mostly mothers on Aid to
Families with Dependent Children whose
children are between six and 18 years of age.
At a crowded bill-signing ceremony in his of
fice, Deukmejian described the legislation as a
"historic plan to free thousands of California
welfare recipients from the vicious cycle of
welfare dependency."
The workfare bill, AB2580 by Assmblymen

Ernest Konnyu (R-Cupertino) and Art Agnos
(D-San Francisco) was a top priority of the Re
publican governor.
It received final approval from the
Democrat-controlled legislature in the closing
hours of the 1985 session two weeks ago in a
compromise linking workfare to substantial in
creases in state child care funds.
Final approval came on lopsided bipartisan
majorities of 32-2 in the Senate and 59-8 in the
Assembly with a handful of liberal Democrats
condemning it as a slave-labor or just a pro
gram to harass recipients.
Workfare, also known as the "GAIN" plan
("Greater Avenues for Independence"), re
quires AFDC recipients to agree to look for
jobs in return for benefits. It includes job coun
seling, placement services, vocational training
and educational programs.

School Fee Ruling
SAN FRANCISCO — In a victory for subur
ban school districts, the State Supreme Court
yesterday ruled unanimously that developers
whose projects contribute to school over
crowding can be charged fees to build new
schools.
The school fee decision reversed lower
court rulings as well as a 1979 opinion by then-
Attorney General George Deukmejian and up
held charges of $1,000 per single-family home
and $500 per unit for other dwellings, imposed
on developers in 1978 by the Grossmont
Union High School District near San Diego.
The fees were to pay for construction of
permanent school buildings officials said were
needed in the growing suburban area.
