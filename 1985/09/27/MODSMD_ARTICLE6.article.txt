# Shakespeare Discusses South Africa

### C.R. DOUGLAS 
Is the study of archaic authors
relevant to life in the 20th century?
Many a student, trudging his way
through another poem of chivalric
love and hoping that sleep comes
before the last stanza, surely has
asked himself the above question.
In agreeing that the question is a
legitimate one, English Prof. Ron
Rebholz, Stanford's leading Shake
spearean expert, contends that
works such as Shakespeare's
"challenge us to think about our
world in different ways." In addi
tion, Rebholz says that authors like
Shakespeare show us that we are a
part of an ongoing tradition.
"There is a direct continuity be
tween Shakespeare's romantic love
and today's version of romantic
love," according to Rebholz.
Though many students fail to
make the connection between
Shakespeare's writings and life
today, Rebholz believes that Shake
speare addresses many questions
of universal interest.
One of these questions contained
in Shakespeare's "Hamlet" speaks

of the "divinity that shapes us all."
This idea that there is some force
beyond ourselves which controls
and influences our actions is, ac
cording to Rebholz, an important
issue in the lives of many students.
These students may be able to gain
an additional understanding of this
issue by approaching it through the
eyes of Shakespeare.
Shakespeare also addresses the
concept of power. Rebholz notes,
"Shakespeare's attitude toward
power seems very much like Mac
hiavelli's, which is like the attitude
of most people of power today."
Rebholz says he concurs with
Shakespeare and Machiavelli that
politicians manipulate people in
order to retain power.
In addition to the connections in
Shakespeare's works to the world
of today, Rebholz says,
"Shakespeare remains relevant be
cause of his genius, and we should
study works of genius of whatever
period."
Asked to speculate about Shake
speare's view of today's society,
Rebholz eagerly surmises that

English Prof. Ron Rebholz contends that Shakespeare speaks
to today's world as powerfully as he did to Elizabethan society.
Shakespeare would probably be
opposed to abortion since the
playwright had strong ties with
the Anglican and Catholic
churches.
Rebholz also says that Shake
speare would be astonished with
the language of today and prob
ably would not even understand
it.
About the nuclear situation of
today, Rebholz adds, "he would
be appalled by the weaponry. He
was even appalled by the weap
ons of his time and the transition
from sword to cannon warfare."
In reference to the practice of
apartheid in South Africa, Reb
holz is confident that Shakespeare
would regard the society divided
by race as "morally repugnant."
Rebholz infers this conclusion
from the way Shakespeare
portrayed mistreatment of Jews
by Christians in "The Merchant of
Venice."
Rebholz says that Shake
speare, in overview, would per
ceive modern society as having
"gone insane."

Rebholz upholds that Shake
speare's works, unlike those of
traditional philosophy and theol
ogy, are more interesting and
powerful since they draw the
reader into a fictional world
through the eyes of the charac
ters.
"Statements of theology and
philosophy strike me as barren,"

says Rebholz.
In hopes of inviting more stu
dents into the fictional world
created by the Shakespeare
genius, Ron Rebholz will be
teaching his course on Shake
speare winter quarter. The
course, entitled simply
"Shakespeare," is registered as
English 1738.
