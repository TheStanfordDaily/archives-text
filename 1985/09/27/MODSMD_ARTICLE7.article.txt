# Government Goes After Student Loan 'Deadbeats'
## 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
The U. S. Department of Education has escalated
its war against student-loan defaulters by warning 2
million "deadbeats" that their 1985 income tax
refunds will be withheld if they don't pay off their
delinquent student loans.
Under the plan, the government hopes to recover
between $50 million and $250 million of an estimated
$5 billion worth of seriously delinquent loans.
During the past several weeks, state and federal
agencies have mailed letters to delinquent recipients
of Federal Insured Student Loans, National Direct
Student Loans and Guaranteed Student Loans,
warning them they have 60 days to make arrange
ments to pay off their debts.
If a defaulter does not contact the appropriate
agency within 60 days, the Department of Eudcation
will forward his name to the Internal Revenue Ser
vice, which will then deduct the amount of outstand
ing loans from 1985 federal income tax returns. If
the amount owed is greater than the 1985 tax
refund, the IRS will withhold future refunds as well.
Education Secretary William Bennett has hailed
the plan as a "major step which should show loan
defaulters that we are dead serious about collecting

these debts to the American taxpayers," while
Robert Huff, Stanford's financial aid director, calls
the program a necessary evil.
"They've been pretty much compelled to take ac
tion because the default rate is just too high on a
nationwide basis," Huff said.
In light of budget cuts and concern for the soaring
federal deficit, the government must collect on
these loans if federal financial aid programs are to be
continued, Huff said. Congress will reconsider all
federal financial aid programs when the three-year
authorization cycle for the programs begins again in
1986.
Huff said Stanford students have a good record of
paying back both government and University loans.
About 3 percent of former Stanford students default
on their state-guaranteed loans, and just under 4
percent fail to repay their University loans, he said.
A Department of Education spokesman said there
are no figures to indicate an exact national default
rate, but that it is probably much higher than Stan
ford's.
Huff attributed Stanford's low default rate to
"first-rate" collection procedures, good pre-loan
counseling and a feeling among former students that
a Stanford education is something worth paying for.
