# Trouble-shooting for Branner Frosh
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
As registration approached ear
lier this week, the number of fresh
men knocking on Steve Long's door
in Branner Hall increased by the
hour. Each had particular questions
about academics or registration
procedures, and Long patiently an
swered every seemingly insur
mountable frosh problem.
Long is a live-in academic coord
inator, a new position at the Uni
versity conceived by Long himself
to help the academic needs of un
dergraduate students.
A a past Branner resident assis
tant (RA) who graduated from the
University in 1983 and is now a
non-matriculated graduate student
preparing for medical school, Long
said he first developed the idea of a
residence-based academic coordin
ator one night last year in Meyer Li
brary.
"Socially, Branner was making
great strides . . . but academically
we were still back in the Stone
Ages," Long said, pointing out that
the job of keeping track of the aca-

demic needs of each student in the
dorm was "such an immense job"
for the RAs who have "so many
other responsibilities."
"RAs barely have enough time to
salvage their own academic situa
tion," he said, noting that RAs
spend a great deal of time on per
sonal counseling, handling
roommate conflicts and organizing
extracurricular activities.
"The RAs were really able to
catch only the chronically failing
student, and we were missing the
students who were just sort of
hanging in there, getting Bs and
Cs," Long said. "There were a lot
of students who needed help and a
lot of resources which were
available, but the two were not
meeting one another somehow."
Sensing the need for someone to
fill the void between the academic
wants of the students and the
capacity of the University's advising
system, Long took his idea to Ken
nell Jackson, Branner's resident fel
low.
Jackson liked what he heard and
helped Long make his idea a reality,
working with the director of Under
graduate Advising, Audrey

Bernfield, and Alice Supton, assis
tant dean of Student Affairs for
Residential Education. In addition,
Long called on Carolyn Lougee, as
sociate dean of Humanities and
Sciences, hoping to get the assis
tance of someone outside the

spectre of residential education.
It was not until mid-summer,
however, that Long received a let
ter from Lougee notifying him of his
appointment to the position of aca
demic coordinator.
Lougee said the idea to establish
such a position had been considered
for several years.

"My idea was sort of a catalyst to
get people moving," Long said,
noting that positions similar to that
of a live-in academic coordinator
already exist at Princeton Univer
sity.
The experimental project here,
sponsored by the Department of
Humanities and Sciences, is on a
one-year trial period, although
Lougee noted that "we might do
this on a permanent basis" if the
project is a success.
According to the letter Long
received from Lougee, the role of
the academic coordinator is "that of
facilitator and liaison: helping stu
dents find and use any tutoring re
sources they may need, guiding
them in making good use of their
advisers."
One of Long's primary tasks is to
keep in touch with advisers
and advising associates, making
sure they regularly attend dinner in
Branner with their advisees. Even
with such weekly and bi-weekly
meetings scheduled throughout the
year, Long believes it is imperative
to have a live-in academic
facilitator.
"You can only get so much from

being here once a week. The pulse
of the dorm is felt much easier by
living here," he said.
Another job Long has undertaken
is to organize in-residence tutorial
programs in courses such as
Chemistry 31 and Calculus 19. In
both cases a tutor is available for
two hours once a week, with stu
dents allowed to sign up for 20-
minute one-on-one sessions.
Long said the primary emphasis
on tutoring is in biology and
chemistry.
"We had to start somewhere, and
somewhere small and specific, an
area where we thought the greatest
need was," he said. Long noted
that students in science-oriented
courses frequently experience the
most academic difficulty, citing
comments from students them
selves and actual grades.
Long conducted his own tutoring
in Branner last year, working with
students in Chemistry 35. At first,
only three or four students atten
ded his tutorials, but the number
steadily increased throughout the
year, reaching its peak when ap
proximately 25 freshmen showed

up for a review session for the final
exam.
Long passed out surveys at the
conclusion of his tutoring sessions
and received numerous favorable
responses, some of which were
passed on to Lougee when Long
made his initial proposal.
In addition to tutorials, two sec
tions of Chemistry 31 are offered at
Branner this fall, as well as three
Western Culture classes. Long has
also helped organize a dorm-based
computer course teaching students
to use the DEC Rainbow personal
computers in Branner's library.
Long also has recruited Kirk
Roberts to serve as the dorm's
chemistry resource person, a posi
tion that involves adressing fresh
men advisers on how to spot poten
tial problems that advisees might be
having in chemistry. Roberts will
also be available to speak with stu
dents about their individual needs.
If all goes well this year for Long,
and his program is given a favorable
evaluation by the Department of
Humanities and Sciences, he hopes
to turn over the position to some
one else next year.

both cases a tutor is available for
two hours once a week, with stu
dents allowed to sign up for 20-
minute one-on-one sessions.
Long said the primary emphasis
on tutoring is in biology and
chemistry.
"We had to start somewhere, and
somewhere small and specific, an
area where we thought the greatest
need was," he said. Long noted
that students in science-oriented
courses frequently experience the
most academic difficulty, citing
comments from students them
selves and actual grades.
Long conducted his own tutoring
in Branner last year, working with
students in Chemistry 35. At first,
only three or four students atten
ded his tutorials, but the number
steadily increased throughout the
year, reaching its peak when ap
proximately 25 freshmen showed

up for a review session for the final
exam.
Long passed out surveys at the
conclusion of his tutoring sessions
and received numerous favorable
responses, some of which were
passed on to Lougee when Long
made his initial proposal.
In addition to tutorials, two sec
tions of Chemistry 31 are offered at
Branner this fall, as well as three
Western Culture classes. Long has
also helped organize a dorm-based
computer course teaching students
to use the DEC Rainbow personal
computers in Branner's library.
Long also has recruited Kirk
Roberts to serve as the dorm's
chemistry resource person, a posi
tion that involves adressing fresh
men advisers on how to spot poten
tial problems that advisees might be
having in chemistry. Roberts will
also be available to speak with stu
dents about their individual needs.
If all goes well this year for Long,
and his program is given a favorable
evaluation by the Department of
Humanities and Sciences, he hopes
to turn over the position to some
one else next year.

As registration approached ear
lier this week, the number of fresh
men knocking on Steve Long's door
in Branner Hall increased by the
hour. Each had particular questions
about academics or registration
procedures, and Long patiently an
swered every seemingly insur
mountable frosh problem.
Long is a live-in academic coord
inator, a new position at the Uni
versity conceived by Long himself
to help the academic needs of un
dergraduate students.
A a past Branner resident assis
tant (RA) who graduated from the
University in 1983 and is now a
non-matriculated graduate student
preparing for medical school, Long
said he first developed the idea of a
residence-based academic coordin
ator one night last year in Meyer Li
brary.
"Socially, Branner was making
great strides . . . but academically
we were still back in the Stone
Ages," Long said, pointing out that
the job of keeping track of the aca-

demic needs of each student in the
dorm was "such an immense job"
for the RAs who have "so many
other responsibilities."
"RAs barely have enough time to
salvage their own academic situa
tion," he said, noting that RAs
spend a great deal of time on per
sonal counseling, handling
roommate conflicts and organizing
extracurricular activities.
"The RAs were really able to
catch only the chronically failing
student, and we were missing the
students who were just sort of
hanging in there, getting Bs and
Cs," Long said. "There were a lot
of students who needed help and a
lot of resources which were
available, but the two were not
meeting one another somehow."
Sensing the need for someone to
fill the void between the academic
wants of the students and the
capacity of the University's advising
system, Long took his idea to Ken
nell Jackson, Branner's resident fel
low.
Jackson liked what he heard and
helped Long make his idea a reality,
working with the director of Under
graduate Advising, Audrey

Bernfield, and Alice Supton, assis
tant dean of Student Affairs for
Residential Education. In addition,
Long called on Carolyn Lougee, as
sociate dean of Humanities and
Sciences, hoping to get the assis
tance of someone outside the

spectre of residential education.
It was not until mid-summer,
however, that Long received a let
ter from Lougee notifying him of his
appointment to the position of aca
demic coordinator.
Lougee said the idea to establish
such a position had been considered
for several years.

"My idea was sort of a catalyst to
get people moving," Long said,
noting that positions similar to that
of a live-in academic coordinator
already exist at Princeton Univer
sity.
The experimental project here,
sponsored by the Department of
Humanities and Sciences, is on a
one-year trial period, although
Lougee noted that "we might do
this on a permanent basis" if the
project is a success.
According to the letter Long
received from Lougee, the role of
the academic coordinator is "that of
facilitator and liaison: helping stu
dents find and use any tutoring re
sources they may need, guiding
them in making good use of their
advisers."
One of Long's primary tasks is to
keep in touch with advisers
and advising associates, making
sure they regularly attend dinner in
Branner with their advisees. Even
with such weekly and bi-weekly
meetings scheduled throughout the
year, Long believes it is imperative
to have a live-in academic
facilitator.
"You can only get so much from

being here once a week. The pulse
of the dorm is felt much easier by
living here," he said.
Another job Long has undertaken
is to organize in-residence tutorial
programs in courses such as
Chemistry 31 and Calculus 19. In
both cases a tutor is available for
two hours once a week, with stu
dents allowed to sign up for 20-
minute one-on-one sessions.
Long said the primary emphasis

chemistry.
