In 92 years of football, Texas has played 890 games.
Stanford, meanwhile, has had 870 contests in its 89
seasons on the gridiron.
Today's nationally-televised game is the first be
tween the two teams.
Although it was scheduled by his predecessor, Joe
Ruetz, the game has at least one supporter in current
Stanford Athletic Director Andy Geiger. "I would have
scheduled this game anyway," he said. "I like it. We
have some good series with Texas in a lot of sports. "
With eight slots in the schedule filled by Pacific 10
opponents and another taken by traditional rival San
Jose State, only two spaces remain for other non
conference games. Geiger, in his seventh year as ath
letic director, has filled out the Cardinal schedule for
the rest of this century.
During the 1990'5, Stanford will play Notre Dame
every year except two. In those two seasons, the
Cardinal will be taking on you guessed it Texas
instead.
Geiger likes the idea of scheduling schools with
similar academic and athletic standards. "It makes a

great intersectional rivalry," he said. "It puts like en
tities together, and it's also financially rewarding."
Stanford has always had a masochistic streak in its
scheduling. The Cardinal's non-conference slate in-,
eludes at least one national power almost every year.
In recent years, Stanford has played such titans as
Oklahoma, Ilinois, Ohio State hnd Boston College.
"Our people enjoy a challenge," Geiger said. "If we
were playing the Little Sisters of the Poor every week,
it probably wouldn't be too exciting."
However, Geiger plans to make things easier on
Jack Elway's crew in the future. Stanford has two
home-and-home series with San Diego State and an
other with Colorado in the next five years. Although
the Aztecs and the Buffaloes are not exactly the Little
Sisters of the Poor, they are not exactly a threat to win
the national championship either.
'We're not gonna play 100 percent tough games,"
Geiger said. "Our conference is tough enough.
Sometimes people don't realize that when you play
Washington, USC, UCLA and Arizona State as regular
conference entities, there aren't too many weeks off.
We're probably too ambitious in our non-conference
scheduling."
But at Stanford, what's wrong with a little ambition?
