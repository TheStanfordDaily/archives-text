# Band Ready For TV Appearance
## 
### 
Today is a special day. The
game is going to be on TV.
Pleasing television executives is
our specialty.
Led by maniacal drum major
Andy Switky, the Incomparable s
will start an investigation into
"Things From Texas" with a
tribute to the good old U.S.A.
and the venerable Stanford Axe.
Then the Band, accompanied
by the Dollies and the Tree, will
scatter like confused pigeons
into what has surely become one
of the biggest erections on the
modern Texas flatlands: the oil
derrick. Except oil, like many
other things, "Don't Come
Easy".
Texans just love to square
dance. Now the Band is going to

try it. But this is a "Safety
Dance".
Ever wonder what a flattened
armadillo might look like? Listen
to "Squeeze Box," and you'll
see.
Finally, who can forget the
Texas Chainsaw Massacre?
Right "Down to the Bone".
Halftime is very topical.
Everyone knows computer whiz
Steve Jobs. Is he "Workin' for a
Livin' "? And how did "Evil
Ways" affect Apple as a whole?
IBM had its trouble too.
"Don't You Worry 'Bout a
Thing", an 1.0. U. will handle it.
HP was hip. But 'What Is
Hip"? Or is that "Dip" now?
Hmmm, this could be bad.
