# Has the Rose of Texas Faded?
## Longhorns picked to finish fifth in SWC 
### PABLO MORALES Staff sportswriter 
Historically, football at the Uni
versity of Texas is synonymous
with supremacy. The Longhorns'
list of accomplishments testifies to
this dominance: 22 Southwest Con
ference titles, three national cham
pionships (1963, '69 and '7O), one of
the longest winning streaks on
record (30 games 1968-70), a
winning percentage of .726 since
1893 and 31 bowl appearances.
However, a recent stretch of
mediocrity has left many wondering
if supremacy is a word saved only
for a glorious past. Case in point:
the 1984 Longhorns.
After climbing to a 6-0-1 mid
season record and a number one
national ranking, UT fell 7 /s and
hard. The Longhorns were branded
by four of their last five opponents,
including a humiliating 37-12 home
loss to the hated Texas A&M
Aggies and a 55-17 shellacking at
the hands of lowa in the Freedom
Bowl.
It seems as though the
Longhorns have fallen victim to na
tional parity, and steady now
parity within their own conference.
Teams like the Aggies, Houston
Cougars and Baylor Bears, previ

ously UT doormats, are starting to
give the Longhorns fits.
UT fans, especially alumni, are
getting edgy. They are suffering
from the same disease that has
stricken the ever-loyal 49er Faith
ful. Faithful-itis, a rather recent
phenomenon, strikes unsuspecting
fans who aren't used to seeing their
teams do poorly, causing them to
grumble and groan when play
doesn't match enormous expecta
tions.
Now those of us who still re
member those dismal 49er seasons
are immune from this illness, sort
of like chicken pox, but UT fans
aren't used to seeing their team do
poorly ever. Slight groans and
grumbles are beginning to be heard
in the distance.
These are sounds in today's
precarious world of collegiate
coaching that would make most
coaches feel like they're on the
chopping block. Most coaches, that
is.
Not Fred Akers.
"Sometimes we hear things from
uninformed sources," said Akers,
the Texas coach. "Besides, I don't
coach for fans.
"I tell everybody the same thing I
tell my players: You can be suc
cessful in pleasing a million people,
but if you don't strive for personal

satisfaction, you'll never be happy
or successful. My assistant
coaches, my players and I feel we
have the responsibility to strive for
a common, team goal. When we do
that, we think our fans will be
happy."
Most Longhorn fans are happy
with Akers. How could they be un
happy with a winner? Akers has
sported a .773 winning percentage
while at Texas, and five of his eight
teams have reached final top-10
rankings.
An Austin American-Stateman
sportswriter attributes most, if not
all, of the grumbling to unhappy
alumni who despise losing, espe
cially to the Aggies on home turf.
He also pointed to an incident last
season that involved an unruly
player Akers neglected to dis
cipline. After UT began its losing
skid, the story surfaced.
The writer felt that had Texas
continued to win, nobody would
have said a thing about the incident.
It was just an avenue for a few
over-zealous alumni to vent their
frustrations during an uncommon
Longhorn losing streak rather than
an actual case of team disintegra
tion.

Although he has a career winning percentage of .773, Texas
Coach Fred Akers may feel the heat from demanding alumni
who expect the Longhorns to raise the traditional "Hook 'Em
'Horns" sign in victory after every Texas game.
Texas newspapers that predict a
fourth- or fifth-place finish for the
Longhorns, have made everyone at
least a little nervous. The Houston
Chronicle has even gone so far as to
put them seventh.
Akers doesn't heed such prog
nostications, but even he would ad
mit, compared to his more domi
nant seasons in the past, that this
will be a "reloading year" for UT.
The Longhorns are young, but ex
tremely talented. How long it takes
them to reload remains to be seen.
Texas opponents, however, are
wary of the present Longhorn arse
nal and regard such predictions of a
UT demise with skeptical eyes.
"Texas was picked too low," said
A&M Coach Jackie Sherrill. "They
showed that by beating Missouri
(21-17 last week)."
Bill Thorton, offensive coordina
tor for Texas Christian, agreed.
"Anyone who picks Texas fifth is
living in a dream world."
A devastating downfall may not
be forthcoming in the near future,
but Akers understands the enor
mous expectations put on his
teams.
"It's difficult to win every game,"
he said, "but as long as one of my
teams comes close to reaching its
full potential, then I'll be very
proud. All you can do is the best
you can do."

this dominance: 22 Southwest Con
ference titles, three national cham
pionships (1963, '69 and '7O), one of
the longest winning streaks on
record (30 games 1968-70), a
winning percentage of .726 since
1893 and 31 bowl appearances.
However, a recent stretch of
mediocrity has left many wondering
if supremacy is a word saved only
for a glorious past. Case in point:
the 1984 Longhorns.
After climbing to a 6-0-1 mid
season record and a number one
national ranking, UT fell 7 /s and
hard. The Longhorns were branded
by four of their last five opponents,
including a humiliating 37-12 home
loss to the hated Texas A&M
Aggies and a 55-17 shellacking at
the hands of lowa in the Freedom
Bowl.
It seems as though the
Longhorns have fallen victim to na
tional parity, and steady now
parity within their own conference.
Teams like the Aggies, Houston
Cougars and Baylor Bears, previ

ously UT doormats, are starting to
give the Longhorns fits.
UT fans, especially alumni, are
getting edgy. They are suffering
from the same disease that has
stricken the ever-loyal 49er Faith
ful. Faithful-itis, a rather recent
phenomenon, strikes unsuspecting
fans who aren't used to seeing their
teams do poorly, causing them to
grumble and groan when play
doesn't match enormous expecta
tions.
Now those of us who still re
member those dismal 49er seasons
are immune from this illness, sort
of like chicken pox, but UT fans
aren't used to seeing their team do
poorly ever. Slight groans and
grumbles are beginning to be heard
in the distance.
These are sounds in today's
precarious world of collegiate
coaching that would make most
coaches feel like they're on the
chopping block. Most coaches, that
is.
Not Fred Akers.
"Sometimes we hear things from
uninformed sources," said Akers,
the Texas coach. "Besides, I don't
coach for fans.
"I tell everybody the same thing I
tell my players: You can be suc
cessful in pleasing a million people,
but if you don't strive for personal

satisfaction, you'll never be happy
or successful. My assistant
coaches, my players and I feel we
have the responsibility to strive for
a common, team goal. When we do
that, we think our fans will be
happy."
Most Longhorn fans are happy
with Akers. How could they be un
happy with a winner? Akers has
sported a .773 winning percentage
while at Texas, and five of his eight
teams have reached final top-10
rankings.
An Austin American-Stateman
sportswriter attributes most, if not
all, of the grumbling to unhappy
alumni who despise losing, espe
cially to the Aggies on home turf.
He also pointed to an incident last
season that involved an unruly
player Akers neglected to dis
cipline. After UT began its losing
skid, the story surfaced.
The writer felt that had Texas
continued to win, nobody would
have said a thing about the incident.
It was just an avenue for a few
over-zealous alumni to vent their
frustrations during an uncommon
Longhorn losing streak rather than
an actual case of team disintegra
tion.

Although he has a career winning percentage of .773, Texas
Coach Fred Akers may feel the heat from demanding alumni
who expect the Longhorns to raise the traditional "Hook 'Em
'Horns" sign in victory after every Texas game.
Texas newspapers that predict a
fourth- or fifth-place finish for the
Longhorns, have made everyone at
least a little nervous. The Houston
Chronicle has even gone so far as to
put them seventh.
Akers doesn't heed such prog
nostications, but even he would ad
mit, compared to his more domi
nant seasons in the past, that this
will be a "reloading year" for UT.
The Longhorns are young, but ex
tremely talented. How long it takes
them to reload remains to be seen.
Texas opponents, however, are
wary of the present Longhorn arse
nal and regard such predictions of a
UT demise with skeptical eyes.
"Texas was picked too low," said
A&M Coach Jackie Sherrill. "They
showed that by beating Missouri
(21-17 last week)."
Bill Thorton, offensive coordina
tor for Texas Christian, agreed.
"Anyone who picks Texas fifth is
living in a dream world."
A devastating downfall may not
be forthcoming in the near future,
but Akers understands the enor
mous expectations put on his
teams.
"It's difficult to win every game,"
he said, "but as long as one of my
teams comes close to reaching its
full potential, then I'll be very
proud. All you can do is the best
you can do."
