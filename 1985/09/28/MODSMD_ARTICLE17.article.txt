# Card's Muster Rushes To National Spotlight
## 
### TOM GILLESPIE 
Two games into the 1984 college
football season, chances are that if
you had mentioned the name "Brad
Muster" to a Stanford football fan,
you would have drawn little more
than a blank expression. Now, two
games into the 1985 campaign, that
same name brings smiles to the
faces of Cardinal fans.
What a difference a year can
make.
Muster is the multi-talented
junior fullback currently on his way
to rewriting a slew of Stanford of
fensive records. In addition, due to
his redshirting freshman year, he
has three remaining years of
eligibility.
Last year at this time, Muster
had yet to play a down and compiled
only 41 yards on eight carries
through the first four games. He
was not, to say the least, a
household name in Stanford foot
ball.
Then in Game Five, a road con

test against UCLA in the Rose
Bowl, Muster received his opportu
nity. Senior starter Kaulana Park
was struggling, and backup Brian
Morris was injured. The offense
needed a boost.
Muster was there to provide it,
gaining 83 yards on 24 carries and
catching three passes for 14 yards.
His performance sparked the Card
inal to a 23-21 upset victory over
the highly-regarded Bruins.
From that game on, Muster
never looked back. In the next con
test, his first starting assignment,
he gained 148 yards on 25 carries
against Washington. A 141-yard
game against Oregon State soon
followed.
The highlight of his year came in
the Big Game season finale against
California, when he led the Cardinal
to a 27-10 victory. His 204 yards
was the third highest total in Stan
ford history.
Muster finished the year as Stan
ford's leading rusher and receiver,
accumulating 823 rushing yards and

31 receptions. He was rewarded
for his efforts with a spot on the All
Pacific-10 Conference Second
Team.
To many fans, Muster's rise to
stardom seems dramatic.
However, Stanford Running Back
Coach Jimmy Walsh is not at all
surprised by Muster's success. "We
always knew the kind of talent that
Brad possessed," he said. "It was
really just a question of timing, of
when he was mentally ready to
become a starter. The opportunity
could not have presented itself at a
better time."
This year, Muster has
picked up where he left off. In
two games, he has caught 25
passes to lead the nation in receiv
ing. He has also gained 224 rushing
yards to rank 12th in the nation
and is tied for the lead in scoring at
18 points per game.
If Muster continues at his current
pace, he will eclipse both the Stan
ford single-season rushing and re
ceiving marks.
Despite these remarkable statis

tics, Walsh feels Muster has only
begun to scratch the surface of his
football talent. "He's got a tremen
dous, God-given talent he can go
out to the first practice and run like
it's the middle of the season," he
said.
"He also has a great understand
ing of the game," Walsh contin
ued. "However, he's not content to
rely on just these factors. Brad has
worked hard to improve himself, by
running and lifting weights and by
refining his blocking and receiving

skills."
Muster remains level-headed
despite all his success. Coach Walsh
calls him "softspoken, a leader by
example and a very unselfish
player."Muster himself says he has
no personal goals set, but that he
hopes "with such a young team that
we can win some games early and
get some confidence."
With Muster amassing over
whelming offensive totals, Stanford
football should be well on its way to
a successful season.


This one may have eluded him, but not too many passes have
gotten away from Cardinal fullback Brad Muster this season.
Muster is leading the nation in receiving with 12.5 catches per
game.
