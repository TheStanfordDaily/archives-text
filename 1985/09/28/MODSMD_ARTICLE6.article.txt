# 1-1 Card Looks To Stampede the 'Horns
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Editorial staff 
The question arises: Which Card
inal team will sing the anthem
today?
It could be the Stanford squad
that dominated San Jose State both
offensively and defensively. Call
that team Lionel Richie.
Or perhaps the other will show,
the one with a more Ozzy Osborne
flair and finesse. Though this group
had some bright moments, it was
still much too erratic, offering many
points and turnovers.
Will the real Stanford Cardinal
please stand up?
If the right one shows, today's
game against the Texas Longhorns
promises to be an exciting one.
Both Stanford and Texas boast
productive offenses. Last week
against Missouri, the Longhorns
racked up 343 yards on the ground
alone, a statistic that has Stanford
Coach Jack Elway concerned.
"In my mind, that's an awesome
running game. They have confi
dence in a lot of people, so they
have a lot of depth. Our defensive
problem will be stopping the run
ning game."
Cardinal outside linebacker Tom
Prukop echoed Elway's senti
ments. "Their running game will be
tough," he said. " We worked hard
in practice on stopping the run and

tried to set everyone's responsibili
ties down so we can avoid the men
tal breakdowns."
The Stanford defense will no
doubt have to be responsible for
Longhorn halfback Charles Hunter,
who said at a preseason press con
ference that he would rush for over
2,000 yards.
His claim, once met with snick
ers and wry comments, is currently
taken with more of a poker face.
Against Missouri, Hunter gained 95
yards on 10 carries all in the first
half.
Helping Hunter towards his lofty
goal are some hefty Longhorn of
fensive lineman, a group Prukop
considered the best and biggest
unit the Cardinal defense will face
this season with the possible excep
tion of USC.
Stanford defensive end Sean
Scheller added that "the key of the
game would be winning up front.
"We have to beat their offensive
line," Scheller continued. "If we
can't beat their front five it's going
to be a long afternoon."
Though Texas deserves good
marks for its running attack, its
passing attack has been anything
but impressive. In the Missouri
game, Longhorn quarterbacks
Brett Stafford and Todd Dodge
completed only five passes in 20 at
tempts.
Yet, the Texas quarterback duo
could have grounds to throw more

often or at least more success
fully against a Cardinal second
ary which has lost starting defen
sive back Walt Harris to a dislocated'
elbow.
'Waif gives us a lot of confidence
back there," said Stanford strong
safety Brad Humphreys. "He gives
a lot of run support, and he has
great speed. We'll miss him back
there."
Even without Harris, the Card
inal defense earned praise from
Texas Coach Fred Akers. "So
much is written and said about
Stanford's offense that their
defense is overlooked," Akers said.
"They're a swarming defense that
doesn't make mistakes."
Akers was a bit generous, but
then again, he wasn't alone. The
Stanford offense philanthropically
turned the ball over six times last
week against Oregon.
But when the Cardinal hangs
onto the ball, they chew up the
yardage. Stanford notched 560
yards against the Ducks with Card
inal quarterback John Paye tossing
for over 400 yards.
Thus far this season, Paye has
emerged as one of top collegiate

quarterbacks, leading the Pacific 10
Conference in'passing.
"He's among the better football
players in the country," Akers said.
"He's got ability. He's got that con
fidence that all great players have.
He has a live arm. He's a dangerous
opponent."
Chances are Stanford fullback
Brad Muster will be the recepient of
many Paye offerings. Not only does
Muster top the team in rushing with
224 yards, but he also leads in pass
receptions, snaring 25 in two
games best in the nation.
And the Cardinal may have to
stick to the air. Playing in the run
oriented Southwest Conference,
Texas specializes in stopping the
run. The Longhorn cornerbacks,
possessors of great speed, play a
tight man-to-man coverage, waiting
to challenge the run.
"They are excellent against the
run and they have excellent cover
guys in the secondary," admitted
Cardinal halfback Thomas Henley.
'We have to be flexible the game
will dictate what we're going to do.
"The number one thing is to exe
cute what we want to do," contin
ued Henley who, like Muster, is

also a serious receiving threat out
of the backfield, one reason why
Akers does not want the Texas
defense to key on only Muster and
Paye.
"If we start looking at individuals,
we'll make big mistakes. Their
entire style of play is what we
prepare for," Akers said.
Ultimately, the game could be
decided by the kicking game. Both
punter John Teltschik, who boasts
an impressive 40 yard net average,
and placekicker Jeff Ward were All-
SWC selections last season. Ward,
nicknamed "Emergency Ward" for
his late field goal heroics last year
against Oklahoma, has thus far un
characteristically missed all three
field goals tries.
Nonetheless, Ward still has
Akers' confidence, "I don't know of
a kicker in the country that I would
trade Jeff for. He is a tough compet
itor, a cool customer under pres
sure and a perfectionist. He is one
of the real strengths of the team,"
Akers said.
Hopefully in the end, the Cardinal
performers will have a chance to
finish with an "It's All Right Now"
or two.

Longhorn halfback Charles Hunter,
who said at a preseason press con
ference that he would rush for over
2,000 yards.
His claim, once met with snick
ers and wry comments, is currently
taken with more of a poker face.
Against Missouri, Hunter gained 95
yards on 10 carries all in the first
half.
Helping Hunter towards his lofty
goal are some hefty Longhorn of
fensive lineman, a group Prukop
considered the best and biggest
unit the Cardinal defense will face
this season with the possible excep
tion of USC.
Stanford defensive end Sean
Scheller added that "the key of the
game would be winning up front.
"We have to beat their offensive
line," Scheller continued. "If we
can't beat their front five it's going
to be a long afternoon."
Though Texas deserves good
marks for its running attack, its
passing attack has been anything
but impressive. In the Missouri
game, Longhorn quarterbacks
Brett Stafford and Todd Dodge
completed only five passes in 20 at
tempts.
Yet, the Texas quarterback duo
could have grounds to throw more

often or at least more success
fully against a Cardinal second
ary which has lost starting defen
sive back Walt Harris to a dislocated'
elbow.
'Waif gives us a lot of confidence
back there," said Stanford strong
safety Brad Humphreys. "He gives
a lot of run support, and he has
great speed. We'll miss him back
there."
Even without Harris, the Card
inal defense earned praise from
Texas Coach Fred Akers. "So
much is written and said about
Stanford's offense that their
defense is overlooked," Akers said.
"They're a swarming defense that
doesn't make mistakes."
Akers was a bit generous, but
then again, he wasn't alone. The
Stanford offense philanthropically
turned the ball over six times last
week against Oregon.
But when the Cardinal hangs
onto the ball, they chew up the
yardage. Stanford notched 560
yards against the Ducks with Card
inal quarterback John Paye tossing
for over 400 yards.
Thus far this season, Paye has
emerged as one of top collegiate

quarterbacks, leading the Pacific 10
Conference in'passing.
"He's among the better football
players in the country," Akers said.
"He's got ability. He's got that con
fidence that all great players have.
He has a live arm. He's a dangerous
opponent."
Chances are Stanford fullback
Brad Muster will be the recepient of
many Paye offerings. Not only does
Muster top the team in rushing with
224 yards, but he also leads in pass
receptions, snaring 25 in two
games best in the nation.
And the Cardinal may have to
stick to the air. Playing in the run
oriented Southwest Conference,
Texas specializes in stopping the
run. The Longhorn cornerbacks,
possessors of great speed, play a
tight man-to-man coverage, waiting
to challenge the run.
"They are excellent against the
run and they have excellent cover
guys in the secondary," admitted
Cardinal halfback Thomas Henley.
'We have to be flexible the game
will dictate what we're going to do.
"The number one thing is to exe
cute what we want to do," contin
ued Henley who, like Muster, is

also a serious receiving threat out
of the backfield, one reason why
Akers does not want the Texas
defense to key on only Muster and
Paye.
"If we start looking at individuals,
we'll make big mistakes. Their
entire style of play is what we
prepare for," Akers said.
Ultimately, the game could be
decided by the kicking game. Both
punter John Teltschik, who boasts
an impressive 40 yard net average,
and placekicker Jeff Ward were All-
SWC selections last season. Ward,
nicknamed "Emergency Ward" for
his late field goal heroics last year
against Oklahoma, has thus far un
characteristically missed all three
field goals tries.
Nonetheless, Ward still has
Akers' confidence, "I don't know of
a kicker in the country that I would
trade Jeff for. He is a tough compet
itor, a cool customer under pres
sure and a perfectionist. He is one
of the real strengths of the team,"
Akers said.
Hopefully in the end, the Cardinal
performers will have a chance to
finish with an "It's All Right Now"
or two.

Cardinal linebackers Kurt Colehower (50) and Tom Prukop (52)
loom large as they seal the gap. They and the rest of the Cardinal
defense will have to be equally imposing to stop the potent
Longhorn running attack.
The question arises: Which Card
inal team will sing the anthem
today?
It could be the Stanford squad
that dominated San Jose State both
offensively and defensively. Call
that team Lionel Richie.
Or perhaps the other will show,
the one with a more Ozzy Osborne
flair and finesse. Though this group
had some bright moments, it was
still much too erratic, offering many
points and turnovers.
Will the real Stanford Cardinal
please stand up?
If the right one shows, today's
game against the Texas Longhorns
promises to be an exciting one.
Both Stanford and Texas boast
productive offenses. Last week
against Missouri, the Longhorns
racked up 343 yards on the ground
alone, a statistic that has Stanford
Coach Jack Elway concerned.
"In my mind, that's an awesome
running game. They have confi
dence in a lot of people, so they
have a lot of depth. Our defensive
problem will be stopping the run
ning game."
Cardinal outside linebacker Tom
Prukop echoed Elway's senti
ments. "Their running game will be
tough," he said. " We worked hard
in practice on stopping the run and

tried to set everyone's responsibili
ties down so we can avoid the men
tal breakdowns."
The Stanford defense will no
doubt have to be responsible for
Longhorn halfback Charles Hunter,
who said at a preseason press con
ference that he would rush for over
2,000 yards.
