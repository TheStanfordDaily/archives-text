# Barns Prepares To Shine Back In Lone Star State
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff sportswriter 
Many a football analyst will tell
you that gridiron games are won
and lost in the trenches the of
fensive and defensive lines. The
team that controls the line of
scrimmage will most likely walk off
the field victorious.
And as the 1985 college football
season approached, the Stanford
Cardinal's supposed lack of proven
talent on both lines resulted in the
team being ranked no better than
eighth in the Pacific 10 Conference
by most preseason pollsters. With
Scott Carpenter, Jeff Deaton,
Brent Martin and Matt Moran all
graduated, the Cardinal offensive
line figured to be extremely vulner
able, at least during the early part
of the season.
Yet through the first two games,
the men up front have held in
check, if not dominated, the defen
sive lines of San Jose State and
Oregon, enabling the Cardinal of
fense to pile up 69 points and 1,020
total yards.
Anchoring the young line has
been senior right tackle John Barns
the sole returnee from last

year's powerful front line and a
Goliath of a man at 6-7, 285 pounds.
Barns has not been surprised by
the success of him and his col
leagues on the offensive line. "I
knew we'd have a good line," he
said. 'We've worked real hard and
(Offensive Line) Coach (Tony)
Yelovich has been real patient."
Barns can easily be spotted in his
three-point stance, towering above
the rest of the line like the Empire
State Building rises above the rest
of the New York skyscrapers. In
short, he is an impressive physical
specimen, a football coach's dream.
But in addition to being a consis
tent performer on the field for the
past three seasons, Barns has
evolved into a team leader and a
role model for the other players.
"It's kind of a natural thing," Barns
said, noting that the team's seniors
are counted on for leadership. "I
really haven't changed my game on
the field."
Stanford Coach Jack Elway and
his coaching staff showed their
confidence in Barns' leadership abil
ity by naming him the offensive cap
tain for the season's opening game
against San Jose State.
"It was really an honor to be a
captain," Barns said. He explained
that Elway chooses new captains

for each game. "He doesn't have a
team captain. He expects everyone
to be a leader," Barns said.
Today's game against Texas will
be an emotional one for Barns, who
hails from Dallas and was an Ail-
American his senior year at High
land Park High School. The national
television coverage that the game is
receiving will allow many of Barns'
friends and relatives to see him
play.
"It'll be fun," Barns said. "All of
my friends will be able to see me.
We (Stanford) have only been
televised a couple of times, and I'm
not even sure if they (friends and
relatives) have been able to see
them.
"I have relatives in Alabama who
have never seen me play," Barns
said.
Barns added that the Texas de
fensive line will be strong and
quick, but not unlike the lines that
the Cardinal sees in Pac-10 action.
'We're not really doing anything dif
ferent in preparation," he said.
"They're not much bigger than the
other teams we face."
Following his high school years in
Dallas, Barns could have stayed in
the Texas area to play college ball,

possibly blocking for an Eric Dick
erson at Southern Methodist and
playing in bowl games year after
year. Yet, Barns has no regrets
about his decision to attend Stan
ford.

"I've loved it out here," he said.
"This is my fifth year out here.
Wow, it seems like it's gone by fast.
"I have no regrets whatsoever,"
Barns said. "I'd do it over in a
second."

Stanford right tackle John Barns is looking forward to being
seen on TV today by his relatives back in Dallas. And at 6-7,
285 pounds, he shouldn't be too hard to spot.
