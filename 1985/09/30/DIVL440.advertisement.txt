BECAUSE OF
CHEMOTHERAPY
KAREN
ANDERSON
IS A STATISTIC.
THE KIND OF
STATISTIC
WE LIKE TO
BRAG ABOUT.
When Karen was 18
years old, her doctor dis
covered she had a deadly
form of leukemia. Facing
incredible odds, Karen
spent three years in inten
sive chemotherapy.
Now, eight years and
two sons later, you'd neve r
suspect that she had bat
tled a disease that kills
more than 15,000 Amer
icans every year.
