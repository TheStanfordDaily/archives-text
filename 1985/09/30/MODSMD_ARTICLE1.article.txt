# Press Pass Conflict Results in Fracture

### MARY YUH Editorial staff 
In a mix-up regarding the validity of some press
passes for Saturday's football game, the chief photog
rapher of the Peninsula Times Tribune was handcuffed
and chained to a golf cart by Stanford police for his
refusal to leave the football field.
The photographer, Robert Andres, said he suffered
a fractured wrist as a result of the police handling.
Andres said he entered the stadium approximately
an hour before the game started and went directly onto
the field, having his pass, a white one, approved at two
separate checkpoints.
Sometime later he saw Times Tribune photographer
Greg Webb "being hassled by about three cops," said
Andres.
"I tried to enter the field," Webb explained, "and I
was stopped and told I couldn't get on the field because
my pass was no good. I argued with (Deputy Mike
Briggs and Sergeant Phillip Love) and refused to leave.
'My boss (Andres) came over and said, My pass is
the same. It's good.' He was told to leave too," Webb
said.
"I told the police it was ridiculous. All the photogra
phers had the same pass," said Andres.
"It was obvious something was wrong," Webb said.
"We (photographers) were not on the field just to
watch the game. We were there to do a job, shoot
pictures."
The confusion apparently arose because there were
two types of passes, an orange one with the the word

"field" printed on it and a white one issued by the Ath
letic Department, Webb said.
Personnel from CBS, the national network that
televised the Stanford-Texas game, had orange
passes, while the approximately 30 photographers had
the white passes, Webb said.
Police were allegedly told by CBS that only the or
ange passes were valid, according to University News
Service photographer Chuck Painter.
Meanwhile, the game had started and Andres and
Webb, sidelined in the stands, were feeling the pres
sure of their deadline, according to Webb.
"I had a (1 p.m.) deadline to meet," Andres ex
plained. "I said, 'Look, the pass is good,' and tried to
get on the field. Some cops grabbed my arms and
pulled me off the field. They arrested me, handcuffed
me and chained me to a golf cart."
Andres said he was taken to a police post behind the
stadium, near the Sunken Diamond, where he was told
he had violated Section 148 of the California Penal
Code, resisting police officers in the discharge of their
duties.
The police later ascertained that the white passes
were valid and Andres was released, although they
confiscated his pass as evidence, Andres said.
"My credentials were checked twice and I had been
shooting for an hour before being ordered off the field,"
said Andres. He said he blames the incident on "the ig
norance of a few police officers."
The passes are valid only for one game and "a
season's worth of passes are given to (the Times

each fall," said Andres.
The passes had been used at the San Jose State-
Stanford game two weeks ago without any problem,
according to Andres. He also said that the police have
nothing against him.
"The order (to leave the field) was not lawful. The
pass was valid," said Andres.
The police were unavailable for comment, and Stan

ford Police Chief Marvin Herrington will not talk to the
press until he reads the complete police report, ac
cording to the University News Service.
Times Tribune editor Michael Kidder also did not
wish to make any statement until he had talked to auth
orities and received a complete report. However, he
said he was "very concerned about what happened to
the chief photographer."
Andres said he was waiting for Kidder to make a
decision regarding any action against the Stanford
Police before filing any lawsuits.
"I am considering individual action against Stanford
Police," Andres said.
