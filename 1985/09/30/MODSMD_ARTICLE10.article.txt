# Center Issues Warning
## New Reagan library traffic, noise feared 
### MARY MCDEVITT Staff writer 
A Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation has been
established in Washington to fund construction of the
Reagan Presidential Library to be built on campus.
Ihe first meetings were held this summer. The
foundation is developing plans to raise the money
needed to build the library, according to Martin Ander
son, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution who is a
member of the foundation's board of trustees.
But no cost estimates for construction of the library
have been made and no architect has been selected, ac
cording to Robert Freelen, the University's vice presi
dent for Public Affairs and head of the Reagan Library
Committee.
Once built, the library will be operated by the Na
tional Archives and Records Service.
A contract between the University, the Reagan
Foundation and the United States' archivist will be
drawn up this fall, Freelen said.
In addition, a decision regarding which access route
will be used by visitors to the library has become more
important than was originally believed. The Center for
Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (CASBS),
which borders the proposed site for the library, an
nounced this summer that it will have to move to a dif
ferent location, possibly to a different school, if traffic
to the library will disturb its activities.
Access roads to the site of the library, about which
the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences (CASBS) expressed "grave qualms" last
month because of anticipated traffic problems have not
yet been determined, Freelen said.

Both the University and CASBS hope that a route
can be established which will be satisfactory for the
needs of both the library and the behavioral center, ac
cording to Freelen.
"We consider both facilities to be assets to the
campus. We don't want one to jeopardize the other,"
he said.
"There are at least two sensible routes up there,
and probably others could be devised. . . . It's a big
plot of land up there. We should be able to work some
thing out," he added.
The concern of the CASBS is of a "noise nuisance"
which would likely accompany the road access, accord
ing to Neil Smelser, CASBS board chairman.
"Our interest is in any access which disrupts the at
mosphere and ambiance of the center," Smelser said.
"The fellows who come to the center come for one
year to be absent from their own (university) depart
ment and committees, for a free year to do research
they are involved in," Smelser said. "The key to that is
isolation.
"It means peace and quiet — peace and quiet we
fear will be jeopardized if we have so many people
moving in or near the area the center is working on."
If the access road planned is anticipated to be too
"disruptive of the main spirit and range of activities that
the center has enjoyed (at its present location) for the
past 30 years," then the CASBS board of trustees
would have to consider moving the center to another
university, Smeler said.
The library site, near the Dish, was approved by the
Stanford Board of Trustees in February and accepted
by President Reagan in March. It remains subject to
approval by Santa Clara County.
