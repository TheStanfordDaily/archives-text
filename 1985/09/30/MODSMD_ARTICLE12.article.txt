## THE
						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Sober Up on Drinking 
### 
Friday night, the flow of beer from the taps at a
coffee house fund-raising party was periodically
halted. When resident assistants returned to
campus earlier this month, they were told to take
steps against drinking games.
These are the latest shots fired in the Office of
Residential Education's continuing war on campus
alcohol abuse. And though Res Ed's intentions in
this campaign are commendable, its generals need
to be sobered up.
The taps at the coffee house party were closed
from time to time on Friday in accordance with a
Res Ed policy intended to slow the flow of brew.
The theory is that this will lessen the quantity of al
cohol consumed by party goers, or at least slow
down drinking. Presumably the goal of this Res Ed
policy is reducing alcohol abuse.
In addition, this fall's edition of the RA handbook
admonishes RAs to stop drinking games and to
report students that will not stop to resident fel
lows. Again, the goal of this policy is the reduction
of alcohol abuse.
But if Res Ed seriously wants to combat alcohol
abuse, it is misspending its time, money and
credibility.
Calling for taps to be periodically closed will not
prevent alcohol abuse. The student intent on getting
inebriated can simply wait for the taps to reopen or
can easily locate other outlets for beer and hard li
quor.
Attempting to outlaw drinking games will not
work. How many RAs will actually police the

games? How many students will obey? The answer
to both questions: not many.
And it really doesn't matter that compliance will
be low, because drinking games are not the source
of alcohol abuse. Most of the students who drank to
excess during or after Saturday's football game did
not touch a quarter. Of those who did play a drinking
game, most probably knew approximately how
much they would drink before the first coin hit the
table.
For these reasons, Res Ed should channel its
energies in more constructive ways. An alcohol edu
cation program similar to the recent approaches to
rape education would be helpful. Educating RAs
about alcohol and possible approaches toward prob
lem drinkers would also be helpful, and certainly
more productive than encouraging them to monitor
drinking games.
Unfortunately, this latest batch of Res Ed
pronouncements on alcohol will tend to undermine
the formulation and implementation of more effec
tive policies. Res Ed's resources are limited; staff
time spent slowing down certain beer taps is time
that can't be used to develop an alcohol education
program. Res Ed, like every person and institution,
has a limited amount of credibility; every RA that is
laughed at for trying to end a drinking game is one
who will not be taken seriously when approaching a
problem drinker.
Rather than continually trying to outflank al
coholism by attacking its symptoms, Res Ed's com
manders need to begin a more straightforward of
fensive.
