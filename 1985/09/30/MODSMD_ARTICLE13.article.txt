## Cooperation Needed for Peace 
### 
Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR) would like
to respond with the following observations to the arti
cle in The Daily of Sept. 24, titled "Physicians Plead for
Peace." This piece was concerning the protest against
Prof. Marat Vartanyan's visit to Palo Alto as a member
of the delegation from the Soviet Committee of the In
ternational Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear
War.
Firstly, PSR wishes to affirm its support for the ef
forts of those groups, including Amnesty International
and the Bay Area Council of Soviet Jews, that are
working to bring the issue of human rights violation to
the public's attention. Politically-inspired acts against

VIEWPOINT

individuals are abhorrent and intolerable, and every at
tempt must be made to end them: PSR also respects
the right of these and other organizations to protest
against persons, such as Dr. Vartanyan, who have al
legedly engaged in such activities. The Soviets' deci
sion to include Dr. Vartanyan in the delegation is open
to interpretation: it may represent an insensitive over
sight, or an indifference to the human rights issue.
Nevertheless, the occasion which brought him here
provided an ideal opportunity for him, and for the
Soviets, to experience the depth of concern Americans
feel about perceived psychiatric practices in the Soviet
Union â€” as well as to witness the freedom with which
that concern can be publicly expressed in this nation.
However, while PSR acknowledges the importance
of the protest, it feels that the emphasis placed on it in
the report of the physician's visit obscured other signif
icant aspects of the event, and did not allow for a clear
presentation of PSR's reasons for sponsoring the
delegation. PSR is a single-issue organization dedi

cated to providing the public with information related to
the medical, psychological and socio-economic implica
tions of the nuclear arms race. One of its objectives is
to produce forums for expression of differing points of
view on this issue, and to foster dialogue and eventual
consensus on matters concerning our national security.
An important component of the issue is U.S./U.S.S.R
relations. On the one hand, despite our cultural and
ideological differences, American and Soviet citizens
do seem to share a common concern about the global
threat posed by nuclear weapons. On the other hand,
we are not in agreement about how to remove or con
tain this threat. PSR believes that the open exchange
of views on this subject, with the intention of finding
appropriate solutions to the dilemma, is a crucial step
in that direction. The four Soviet physicians were
received in Palo Alto to enable interested members of
the medical profession and the general community to
meet and talk with these official representatives of the
Soviet Union about arms control, and ways physicians
can help achieve it. On the whole, PSR believes that
this was a useful endeavor. Both sides gained from the
encounter.
In the nuclear age, Americans and Soviets are like
two mountain climbers linked by a single rope and at
tempting to scale a precipitous slope. Progress toward
the peak depends on cooperation between the clim
bers. We may not trust, like or agree with one another
on other matters, but in this particular effort we must
be able to rely on our ability to make decisions and take
actions that will not jeopardize our mutual safety. In
this venture, survival is the ultimate human right.
