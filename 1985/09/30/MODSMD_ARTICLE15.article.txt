Playboy 'Work'
Not Modeling
Having read the article on Stan
ford women in Playboy
(Wednesday, Sept. 25), I am ap
palled at the view that C.C.
Shanahan presents of working
women. Particularly, I refer to her
comment that her Playboy work is
"just another tearsheet for (her)
modeling portfolio." It would be
very unfortunate — and very typi
cal — for her businesslike, though
flawed, reasoning to be accepted
as a valid argument for the contin
ued portrayal of women as mere
bodies. Modeling, at its best, is a
profession that is both physically
and intellectually demanding. As
with most facets of advertising, it
requires training, an ability to deal
with people, poise and creative
thinking. Being a Playboy "model"
is hardly suitable modeling experi
ence. By posing for Playboy, one
has not learned to bring out the
best in clothing — only to sell
one's body. The modeling profes
sion, like any other a person (male
or female) goes into, deserves
better. Shanahan sadly seems to
be yet another woman who has
sold out or succumbed to society's
easy and accepted way of climbing
into the business world — by using
her body to get a job or get ahead.
Her shining example throws into
sharp relief the importance of the
activities of women at Stanford
who are using their capabilities to

prove themselves equals in the
working world.

Not New Course
The Canadian literature course,
which was the subject of The
Daily's article "Department Intro
duces Novel Class" in the Sept. 25
issue, is indeed an exciting addition
to the Stanford curriculum. But the
statement made in the article
which claimed that this is the first
time a course like this has been
taught at Stanford is not accurate.
In the spring of '79-' BO, Harry
Killas taught the course "Modern
Canadian Fiction: The Canadian
Imagination" through the Under
graduate Special Program (UGS).
The writings of Alice Munro, Mar
garet Atwood, Marie-Claire Blais,
Margaret Laurence and many other
contemporary Canadian authors
and poets were included in this
course.
UGS courses have supple
mented the undergraduate curricu
lum at Stanford for many years.
One of the goals of the program is
to offer innovative academic
courses which are not presently
being offered through any depart
ment. It is encouraging to see that
the English Department has now
incorporated this course into the
regular departmental offerings.
Along with SWOPSI and

Freshman-Sophomore Seminars,
UGS is now part of Innovative
Academic Courses (lAC), a new
program in the school of
Humanities and Sciences. lAC
encourages student involvement in
every aspect of program planning
and welcomes comments and ques
tions. lAC is located at 590-A Old
Union, 497-4305.
