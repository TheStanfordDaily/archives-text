# Walk-Ons Given Housing
## 
### DAVID RISSER Editorial staff 
For the first time in recent Stanford his
tory, all students who attempted to "walk
on" to University housing have been as
signed a place to live.
In what Rodger Whitney, director of the
Ifousing Center, termed a "very smooth
process," 85 undergraduates and 90
graduate students were given assign

ments to various housing arrangements at
a meeting held Thursday at Tresidder
Memorial Union.
"I'm delighted," said Whitney, who is
also assistant dean of students. "It's good
to see all students accommodated," he
added.
While the number of walk-ons has
remained at the same level over the past
few years, the University was able to ac
commodate all of them this year by con

verting family housing in Escondido Vil
lage to single housing, Whitney said.
While the entire undergraduate housing
system is now full, Whitney said last night
that a few spaces remain available — for
undergraduates or graduate students —
in graduate student housing. Students in
terested in one of the five to 10 spaces
should call the Housing Center today. In
addition, a few apartments for families
have not been filled.
