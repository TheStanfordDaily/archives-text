# New Advising Director Improves Center Help
## 
### SALLY HAMAKER 
"You can major in anything and
get a job" is perhaps the most com
mon advice given to undergradu
ates by Audrey Bernfield, the new
director of the Undergraduate
Advising Center here.
The Undergraduate Advising
Center, formerly called the Aca
demic Information Center, will be
under her authority. Along with the
addition of Bernfield, the center has
undergone many other changes, in
cluding a new basis for advising.
"Instead of a center that
responded to the needs of the stu
dents who entered it, we are now
anticipating the needs of under
graduates," Bernfield said. "We're
doing more outreach by opening up
the advising system and making
ourselves available to other
agencies."
Bernfield said that some of the
recent happenings in the depart
ment have included a special orien
tation for recruited athletes, a
women in science and engineering
network, sections of science
courses taught in dorms and a
dorm-based tutorial program.
"We are representing students in
all academic interests," said
Bernfield.
Along with these new projects,
Bernfield and her associates are
working to target other types of
groups, including incoming fresh

men from overseas, students with
academic standing problems and
athletes.
Bernfield came to Stanford in
1976 as a working consultant for
career planning in the department
of Human Biology.
She then became director of
advising in the Human Biology De-

partment, and in 1982 she took on
another job — she became a part
time advising assistant to the dean
of Humanities and Sciences.
Two of Bernfield's most success
ful projects here have been the
Majors Event, an annual festival
held in the Quad that "allows people

to talk to different departments and
to realize their opportunities;" and
the publication "The Major Deci
sion," a booklet of responses
Bernfield gathered from recent
Stanford graduates about the
relevance of their majors to their
present careers.
Another new face on the advising
team is Bernfield's assistant, Andre
Sursock.
Sursock taught on the University
of California campuses at Berkeley
and Davis, and has been employed
by Stanford for two months.
"I feel very enthusiastic about
our new program," Sursock said.
"There are lots of new ideas and
room for improving the advising
system at Stanford. I think we have
already started to improve."
Bernfield stressed that
"everyone is doing more than they
were doing when they came in.
Everybody in the office advised the
sophomores who were without ad
visers, and almost all the students
walked out with a pretty good
feeling about the advice they had
been given."
Not only has advising been
Bernfield's professional direction
for the past nine years, it has been
a personal challenge as well. She
has three of her own children in col
lege, and has been able to give
them academic guidance.
"It's very exciting when you feel
like you have some impact on stu
dents' decisions," she said.
