# War Researchers Provide the Questions
## Mac Arthur Foundation invests in finding the answers

• Jeffrey Hughes is a doctoral can
didate in political science at Stan

ducting research on various modern
regional conflicts throughout the
world that could be characterized as
limited wars.
Hughes, whose case studies in
clude the Korean War and Middle
East conflicts, is seeking to deter
mine why rivalries have been ter
minated at some times, remained

world war in two instances.
• Edward Gilliland is a doctoral
candidate here in sociology. In his
dissertation, he aims to compare
anti-government rebellions

national, economic and military
pressures.
He is compiling a quantitative
statistical analysis of factors sur
rounding rebellions in more than
100 nations.
• Scott Pious is a doctoral candi
date at Stanford in psychology. His
dissertation focus is world percep
tions, or misperceptions, of the nu
clear arms race.
Pious is using a field study for his
paper. He has surveyed several
world leaders — mainly those in

volved with weapons procurement
— on their views of the arms race.
After traveling once to the Soviet
Union to distribute his survey infor
mally, he has been invited back by
the Soviet Academy of Sciences to
administer the survey in a more
structured manner.
The three students — each
working in a different University

Why do countries that have been enemies for centuries sometimes
reverse themselves and form alliances? Why do small incidents spark
global wars at other times? Is there a numerical formula that describes
how economic and military pressures affect rebels of all countries?
These are a few of the subtle and multi-faceted issues that will survive
as topics of research in the world of academics, thanks to infusions of
funding from the Mac Arthur Foundation.

department — are recipients of In
ternational Security and Arms Con
trol Fellowships funded by the John
D. and Catherine T. Mac Arthur
Foundation. The foundation has

donated $100,000 a year to Stan
ford over a three-year period to be
awarded to graduate students
specializing in international security
and arms control.
"It's a generous stipend," said
Hughes, who will receive $2,100
this quarter to work on his disserta
tion.
"It allows me to work full time on

my dissertation and improves my
chances of finishing on schedule,"
said Gilliland, who was able to quit a
20-30 hour-per-week job after re
ceiving the grant.

"I was running out of money,"
said Pious.
The students say the fellowship
program offers much more than
funds. Hughes cited the
"extraordinary range of resources"
available at Stanford's Center for
International Security and Arms
Control.
The center, located across the

street from Encina Hall, was estab
lished in 1983, growing out of 10-
year-old University program for
arms control research.
"The center brings together

people from all parts of the Univer
sity who wouldn't otherwise get a
chance to work together," said
Hughes. "It offers stimulation
across fields."
According to Gilliland, the fellow
ship program "gives me the chance
to become familiar with things
people in other departments are
doing in international relations and

international security."
The dissertation write-up fellow
ships are awarded to Stanford stu
dents in doctoral programs (Ph.D.,
M.D. or J.D.) whose dissertations

deal with some aspect of interna
tional security and/or arms control.
Six students — including Hughes,
Gilliland and Pious — received
these awards in May, when the first
batch of Mac Arthur fellowships
were announced.
In addition to the dissertation
write-up awards, four summer fel
lowships and a law student ex
ternship grant were announced in
May.
Members of the selection com
mittee are Herbert Abrams, medi
cal school; Karlene Dickey,
graduate awards; Sidney Drell,
SLAC; Alain Enthoven, business
school; David Holloway, Center for
International Security and Arms
Control; Stephen Krasner, political
science; John Lewis, chair, political
science and Elliott Levinthal, me
chanical engineering.
The next round of the competi
tion for dissertation write-up fel
lowships will be held this fall. "At
least three or four" fellowships will
be awarded then, according to
David Bernstein, a consultant at the
Center for International Security
and Arms Control.
Details on the competition are
available from Gerry Bowman,
training director at the center (497-
9626). Applications must be
received by Oct. 18. The awards
will be announced in early Novem
ber.
