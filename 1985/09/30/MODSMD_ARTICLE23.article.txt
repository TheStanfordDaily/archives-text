## 'Horns Gut Card, 38-34 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
The Stanford locker room was a quiet place after Satur
day s 38-34 loss to the visiting Texas Longhorns, but the
mood was miles away from despair.
Stanford had done a pretty damn good job, after all. The
Cardinal had fallen behind 24-3 late in the second quarter, but
it had regrouped, fixed the things that had been going wrong
and stormed back to take a 34-31 lead with 8:36 left in the
game.
And after the perennially powerful Longhorns had rallied
for a touchdown on tailback Charles Hunter's three-yard run
with 3:55 remaining, Stanford had marched downfield on a
nail-biting drive that ended with fullback Brad Muster being
run out of bounds just 37 yards short of an astounding,
nationally-televised upset.
"I am very proud of this team," Coach Jack Elway told a
circle of reporters after the game. "They're a great group of
guys. They've got nothing to be ashamed of."
Well, there were a few things to be ashamed of early in the
game. Just as in the Oregon contest a week earlier, Stan
ford's defense was hurt by the big play. And in another bit of
Duck deja vu, Stanford's offense was throttled by the blitz for
most of the first half.
But this time, the Stanford brain trust worked out solutions
to those problems. And this time, the Cardinal players dug in
and fought their way back into the game, outscoring Texas
31-7 in a 26-minute stretch that brought the Stanford fans to
their feet and lowered the blood pressure of CBS Sports ex
ecutives worried about a Texas blowout.
i m just glad this long day is over," Longhorn Coach Fred
Akers said. "This was a terrific game for all of us at Texas to
be a part of, and I'm not so sure that we're looking forward to
next September when this Stanford team comes down to
Austin."
In the beginning, it looked more like a Stanford-Texas track
meet than a football game. Four times in the first half, the
dismayed Cardinal fans watched Longhorn offensive players
get the ball into the wide-open Stanford secondary and turn
the play into a footrace with Stanford defensive backs.
On the game's first series, Texas quarterback Bret Staf
ford rolled left in search of a receiver on third and six, found
nothing, reversed to the right side of the field and found 74
yards of daylight. Stafford juked cornerback Bruce Richard
son into the ground and outran cornerback Toi Cook to the
end zone for a 7-0 Longhorn lead.
After a 46-yard field goal by Stanford's David Sweeney, the
races started again. Freshman fullback Darron Norris
rambled 50 yards over left end to set up a 26-yard field goal
by the Longhorns' Jeff "Emergency" Ward.
Then Texas' other quarterback, Todd Dodge, aired it out
for a 55-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Donovan Pitts,
who literally took the ball off the helmet of Stanford free
safety Mark Hashimoto.
"I could feel the ball coming, but I couldn't find the ball,"
Hashimoto said. "The guy took it off my helmet. It was a case
of good coverage, poor ball awareness."
Norris ran the last heat of the half, busting over tackle and
outrunning Hashimoto and Cook 62 yards to the end zone to
make the score 24-3 with 1:53 left in the second quarter.
It looked bleak, but no one on the Stanford sidelines was
giving up hope. "We've been able to score points so far this
year," Muster said. "We never thought we were out of the
game."
Paye, who had been off-and-on to that point, immediately
rallied Stanford to a 75-yard TD drive that took only four

plays and 38 seconds. He connected on a 29-yard pass to
wide receiver Jeff James in single coverage in the corner of
the end zone for the score. With the score, the Cardinal
players went into the locker room down by two touchdowns.

When they came out, they looked like an entirely different
team. Elway solved the blitz by blocking with both backs on
pass plays and concentrating on finding James in single
coverage. On the opening possession of the second half.
Stanford marched steadily downfield in 10 plays, scoring on a
fourth-down, one-yard plunge by Paye.
And the performance of the Cardinal defense was markedly
improved. The hits were harder, the pursuit was better and
the big plays were a thing of the past. From now on, Texas
would have to work for their scores.

"During halftime we got a little more relaxed, got a little
more composed," defensive end Sean Scheller said. "It was a
conglomerate realization that if we played all out with the in
tensity and the talent we have, we could beat them."
Scheller got in for Stanford's first sack of the day on the
Longhorns' opening possession, and after a short punt gave
the Cardinal excellent field position the offense scored again.
On a second and goal from the 10-yard line, Paye rolled
right, searching for a receiver. Just before he reached the
sideline, he spotted Muster wide open in the back corner of
the end zone and fired.
Muster leaped for the ball, stretched his toes back to stay
in bounds and Stanford had six points.
Not seven. The extra-point snap was high, and Sweeney
shanked the kick off his ankle to leave the score 24-23.


The timing between Cardinal quarterback John Paye
and his receivers was on all day. Paye connected on
