# To Run Or Not To Run

### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
And now, here's the mo
ment that all you bleacher
seated quarterbacks out
there have been waiting for.
Think you can direct a good
football game? Think you can
outcoach the coaches? It's
time for . . . You Make The
Call.
One minute and 33 seconds
remain on the game clock.
Stanford quarterback John
Paye signals for his team's
final timeout and trots over to
the sideline to hear what
Coach Jack Elway has in
mind for the next play.
Elway looks up at the
scoreboard. Stanford has a
fourth and two at the Texas
34-yard line, trailing 38-34.
What should he call?
Stanford has had success
with the pass all afternoon.
But Texas has been in a tough
bu mp-and-run prevent defense
for the last three plays of this
drive, taking away the quick
pass.
Stanford's ground ga me has
been almost non-existent on
the afternoon, producing only
86 yards so far. In fact, the
last three plays, all runs up the
middle, have advanced the
Cardinal just eight yards.
But big fullback Brad
Muster is nearly always good
for a couple of yards. A
pitchout to Muster earlier in
the quarter gave Stanford three
yards and a crucial two-point
conversion against a stacked
goal-line defense. The play has
worked for Stanford ever since
last year: clear out one side of
the defense by sending a
receiver in motion, pitch to
Muster, get a blocking back in
front of him and watch him
go. Two yards is all you need,
and there's plenty of time left
on the clock.
What's your call?
