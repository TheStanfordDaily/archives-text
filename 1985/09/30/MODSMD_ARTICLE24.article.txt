# To Run Or Not To Run
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
And now, here's the mo
ment that all you bleacher
seated quarterbacks out
there have been waiting for.
Think you can direct a good
football game? Think you can
outcoach the coaches? It's
time for . . . You Make The
Call.
One minute and 33 seconds
remain on the game clock.
Stanford quarterback John
Paye signals for his team's
final timeout and trots over to
the sideline to hear what
Coach Jack Elway has in
mind for the next play.
Elway looks up at the
scoreboard. Stanford has a
fourth and two at the Texas
34-yard line, trailing 38-34.
What should he call?
Stanford has had success
with the pass all afternoon.
But Texas has been in a tough
bu mp-and-run prevent defense
for the last three plays of this
drive, taking away the quick
pass.
Stanford's ground ga me has
been almost non-existent on
the afternoon, producing only
86 yards so far. In fact, the
last three plays, all runs up the
middle, have advanced the
Cardinal just eight yards.
But big fullback Brad
Muster is nearly always good
for a couple of yards. A
pitchout to Muster earlier in
the quarter gave Stanford three
yards and a crucial two-point
conversion against a stacked
goal-line defense. The play has
worked for Stanford ever since
last year: clear out one side of
the defense by sending a
receiver in motion, pitch to
Muster, get a blocking back in
front of him and watch him
go. Two yards is all you need,
and there's plenty of time left
on the clock.
What's your call?
Of course, it's an easy call to
make now. We know what hap
pened. Elway went with the pitch,
Muster was knocked out of bounds
for a three-yard loss and Texas ran
out the clock to win the game.
Now, it's simple: call a pass, run to
the wide side of the field, anything
but the misdirection pitchout to
Muster. But at the time, it was the
obvious choice for Elway to make.
And that's exactly why the play
didn't work. The play was stopped
not because it was a fundamentally
bad call, but because it was the
most natural call for Elway to make
in that situation. And Texas defen
sive coordinator David McWilliams
knew it.
He knew that Elway was inclined
to go for the first down and no
more. He knew two yards was too
far for a plunge into the line on
fourth down, and he knew that El
way was fond of the misdirection
pitchout.
"During the timeout, Coach
McWilliams said he thought (the
misdirection pitchout) was what
they were going to go back to," said
Longhorn linebacker Ty Allert in
the locker room after the game.
"So we ran a blitz on that side, and
it worked."
It sure did. Wide receiver Jeff
James went in motion toward the
wide-open right side of the field,
and no one on the Texas defense
followed him. They stayed right
where they were, with their eyes

glued on the short side of the field.
That's when Elway knew he had
been outcoached.
"They didn't do what I thought
they would do," Elway said after
the game. "Before the ball was
snapped, and there was no man in
motion, I knew it wasn t going to
work, that we didn't have a chance.
We took the bait, going for the first
and 10 and not throwing the ball. I
would love to do it all over again.
Allert strung the play out, follow
ing Henley's block all the way over
to the sideline and forced Muster
out of bounds. And immediately,
the second guessing began. It came
from fans, writers and even Elway
himself.
"Yeah, I'd like to have that one
back," he said. "I got preoccupied
by a first and 10. . . .'We had
several options and we chose the
wrong play."
He was less apologetic when an
other writer joined the circle of
reporters and asked him again if he
thought he had made the wrong
call.
"Hell yeah, but I called a lot of
right ones too," he said angrily.
"And I'll call a lot more bad ones, as
long as I'm coaching."
He was outcoached by McWil
liams on that one play, in other
words. Maybe you second
guessers could have made the right
call on that one, and maybe that call
would have meant the game for
Stanford.
But could you have coached the
Stanford team to the point where an
upset of Texas rested on that final
decision? You Make The Call.
And now, here's the mo
ment that all you bleacher

there have been waiting for.

"During the timeout, Coach
McWilliams said he thought (the
misdirection pitchout) was what
they were going to go back to," said
Longhorn linebacker Ty Allert in
the locker room after the game.
"So we ran a blitz on that side, and
it worked."
It sure did. Wide receiver Jeff
James went in motion toward the
wide-open right side of the field,
and no one on the Texas defense
followed him. They stayed right
where they were, with their eyes

glued on the short side of the field.
That's when Elway knew he had
been outcoached.
"They didn't do what I thought
they would do," Elway said after
the game. "Before the ball was
snapped, and there was no man in
motion, I knew it wasn t going to
work, that we didn't have a chance.
We took the bait, going for the first
and 10 and not throwing the ball. I
would love to do it all over again.
Allert strung the play out, follow
ing Henley's block all the way over
to the sideline and forced Muster
out of bounds. And immediately,
the second guessing began. It came
from fans, writers and even Elway
himself.
"Yeah, I'd like to have that one
back," he said. "I got preoccupied
by a first and 10. . . .'We had
several options and we chose the
wrong play."
He was less apologetic when an
other writer joined the circle of
reporters and asked him again if he
thought he had made the wrong
call.
"Hell yeah, but I called a lot of
right ones too," he said angrily.
"And I'll call a lot more bad ones, as
long as I'm coaching."
He was outcoached by McWil
liams on that one play, in other
words. Maybe you second
guessers could have made the right
call on that one, and maybe that call
would have meant the game for
Stanford.
But could you have coached the
Stanford team to the point where an
upset of Texas rested on that final
decision? You Make The Call.
