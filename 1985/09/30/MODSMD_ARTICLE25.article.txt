# Wins over UOP, Davis and Fresno
## Water Polo Hat-trick 
### INGRID SEYER Staff writer 
Playing three consecutive matches on the road
and winning them is never an easy thing to do, but
for the Stanford water polo team, winning seems to
come easy no matter what the situation. The Card
inal, ranked No. 1 nationally, proved this tenet this
weekend as it defeated Fresno State 9-4, the Uni
versity of Pacific 11-5 and UC-Davis 13-6.
"We went into each match knowing that we had to
get out to an early lead, and we did just that in all
three matches," Coach Dante Dettamanti said. "If
an opponent gets ahead in the first quarter they are
much more likely to put up a fight for the entire
game and that makes the play much more difficult
and tiring for us."
The Cardinal led 6-2 at the half in the Fresno
match, 7-1 in the UOP match and 9-3 in the Davis
match.
According to Dettamanti, there are a number of
aspects in the Cardinal's play that are contributing to
the team's top form this early in the season. A
strong defense, two talented goalies, a balanced
team-scoring attack, a strong holeman and a contin
gent of experienced collegiate players are all factors
that are affecting the team's overall play.
"The team has been playing very intelligently this
year on both offense and defense," Dettamanti said.
"On our offense, especially in our 'man-up' situa
tions, all of the players are aware of where the best
openings are and are playing to those openings.
Even the freshman are picking up quickly on how to
recognize what spots are opening up and how to
react when they see them."
The Cardinal's offense has been sparked by espe
cially strong play from junior holeman Craig Klass.
He has scored eight goals this weekend and has
scored 24 goals in nine games so far this season.
"Craig has got to be one to the top two holeman in
the country right now," Dettamanti said. "He has

been working hard for a very long time and his ef
forts are really starting to pay off for him and the
team. It is really unusual for the holeman to be a
team's leading scorer, but Craig is certainly showing
that that is possible."
Klass trained with the U.S. National team this
past spring and summer and played for the National
B team against Sweden earlier this year.
On the defensive side, the Cardinal has been led
by what Dettamanti calls "two of the top three
goalies in the country." Each of the two goalies has
a particular asset of his own and the strength of the
two combined has been quite a surprise for the
Cardinal.
"Obi is very consistent at the goal and I know I
can rely on him to play a steady game and make the
saves when we need them," Dettamanti said.
"Todd, on the other hand, is more of a finesse
player, one who can come of the bench and spark
the team with a spectacular save or two."
Dettamanti has also been very pleased with the
team's defensive play as a whole. While the offense
is averaging 10-11 goals a match, the Cardinal
defense has been keeping the opponents to five or
six goals a match.
"Greg Gamble is by far our top defensive player,
but the entire team is playing very defensively
aware," Dettamanti said. "At present, our offense
defense ratio is of champion caliber."
The team's championship caliber did not quite
shine through in the Fresno game, although, accord
ing to Dettamanti, the team's performance was
"good enough to win."
"We didn't play particularly well in the Fresno
game, but we came out sharp in the UOP match and
made up for that," Dettamanti said. "On our first
possession of the match we took the ball to the hole,
drove, shot and had a goal in under a minute. That
level of play continued throughout the match."
If the Cardinal continues on as it has, that level of
play will continue throughout the season and the
team will retain its current No. 1 status.
