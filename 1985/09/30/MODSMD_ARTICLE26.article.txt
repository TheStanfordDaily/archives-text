# Women Bounce Texas and USC
## 
### STEVE CRAMER 
Question and answer time is over.
By defeating the University of Texas Friday night
and USC on Saturday, the Stanford women's volleyball
team may have proved at last that it is for real.
The Cardinal survived a 15-8, 16-14, 13-15, 5-15,
18-16 battle in front of over 2,000 people in Maples
Pavilion, defeating a tough sixth-ranked Texas team. It
took a combination of pride, ability and brute strength
to overcome the hard-hitting Longhorn squad.
Was the Cardinal expecting such a tough opponent?
"When a team like Texas makes a West Coast trip they
prepare specifically for us. . .we knew they would be
ready for us," said Co-coach Don Shaw. And ready
they were.
After winning the first two games behind the superb
play of senior setter Kim Oden and a strong supporting
cast, the Cardinal collapsed in games three and four.
Stanford looked worse than the crowd's pathetic at
tempt at The Wave. The aggressive Longhorn squad
jumped on several Cardinal mistakes. "If you let a good
team like that off the hook you are going to be in trou
ble," Shaw said.
The loss of sophomore setter Wendi Rush to an
ankle injury in game three started the demise. "We lost
a little confidence when Wendi went down. Brook Bin
ley did a great job filling in for her but we gave up a lot
at the net," Shaw said.
In the deciscive fifth game the Cardinal showed their
pride, fighting off five game points at 12-14 and going
on to win 18-16. "I was proud of the way they hung
tough. That shows what kind of pride this team has,"
Shaw
"It was a weird game," Oden said.
Fortunately, the Cardinal victory over USC Satur
day night was somewhat less exciting. Led by Oden's
16 kills and .455 hitting percentage, the Cardinal
downed the Trojans in straight games 15-4, 15-8, 15-7.
Barbra Fontana and Teresa Smith added another 12
and nine kills, respectively. The victory was historic in
that it marked the first time a Stanford volleyball team,
men's or women's, won in USC's Norton Gym.

The Cardinal, now 10-0 overall and 1-0 in the Pac-
West, completely dominated the Trojan squad. "It was
the best all-around match we played this year . . . We
finally started to execute. Our block and our defense
improved greatly."
So the team has finally answered the question of how
good they really are, right? Not necessarily. Shaw
was quick to point out that USC, now 8-4 overall and 0-
1 in the Pac-West, was playing without their first and
second-string setters.
"We caught them at a good time for us. . .they were
not able to run the offense they normally have. Its like
playing a football game without your first and second
string quarterbacks," Shaw said. The USC hitting
percentage was .110 while the Cardinal hit at .421.
The women next see action here Friday night when
they host defending national champion UCLA at 7:30
p.m.
