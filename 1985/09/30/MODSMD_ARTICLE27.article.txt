# Soccer Teams Split Away
## Men at Cal-Poly 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
When a team outshoots its op
ponent 23-6, it should win rather
handily. That's what the Stanford
men's soccer team did on Saturday
night.
The Cardinal barrage dumped
host Cal-Poly San Luis Obispo by a
2-0 score, evening Stanford coach
Sam Koch's season record at 4-4-1.
"No one person is doing it all for
us," Koch said. "The entire team
played well."
The entire Cardinal 11 applied
heavy pressure from the beginning,
and just seven minutes into the
game, sophomore forward Brian
Mahaffey put Stanford on the board.
Card midfielder Tom Rafalovich
lofted a cross into the penalty area.
Senior Rob West controlled the ball
and pushed it out to Mahaffey who
drilled it into the far right corner
from 10 yards out.
Coach Sam Koch's squad contin
ued to dominate the contest for
about the next 20 minutes. But
slowly, Cal-Poly, now 2-4-1 on the
year, began to make the game
more interesting.
"We started off real well," senior
Marshall Monroe said. "Then we let
up a bit and let them back in the

game."
Still, the Mustangs couldn't
record a goal despite their pressure
and at halftime, Stanford led 1-0.
In the second half the Cardinal
ran Cal-Poly right back out of the
contest.
"We went back to playing our
own game in the second half," Koch
explained.
A penalty shot by Angel Vaz
quez, set up by senior Giancarlo
Ferruzzi's break-away midway
through the second stanza, put the
Cardinal up 2-0.
With a cushy two goal lead, the
Stanford defense cruised to its sixth
shutout of the year. For the game,
Cal-Poly managed only six shots on
the Stanford goal. Junior keeper
Tom Austin had to field only three
of those.
Sometimes goaltending is easy
â€” and fun. In this case, Austin was
able to marvel for much of the con
test at the fine play of his Stanford
teammates, Feruzzi, Vasquez and
Rafalovich. He just didn't have to do
very much.
Austin and the rest of the Stan
ford squad will probably have a
rougher time of it this week. Wed
nesday afternoon, the Cardinal will
kick off its Pacific Soccer Confer
ence schedule by hosting nationally
ranked Fresno State.
