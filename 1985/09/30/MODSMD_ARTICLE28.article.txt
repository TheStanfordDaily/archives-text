National rankings can be deceiv
ing, but this time they weren't.
Last Friday, by losing 4-0 at
Berkeley, Stanford's women's soc
cer team learned why the Golden
Bears are ranked fourth in the na
tion and first in the West.
Berkeley was good and to top it
off they were hungry. Returning
from a road trip in which they lost
three games and tumbled two spots
in the national rankings, the Card
inal was just what the Golden Bears
needed.
Faced with the task of containing
a stronger and quicker team, "we
found our selves defending most of
the time," Coach Helen Keohane
said. "We just couldn't establish our
sort of game."
The Cardinal's sort of game is
slow and controlled — this one was
quick and furious.
Though they were constantly un
der fire, the Cardinal defense,
anchored by senior goalkeeper
Helen Norton, played well in the
first half.
The Golden Bears managed only
one score in the first stanza. Four
and-a-half minutes into the game,
Berkeley's Karen Peterson

powered a shot into the Cardinal
goal.
The count remained the same
until the game's 48th minute, when
another Bear found the back of the
Cardinal net. And"the game
became more of a struggle,"
Keohane said. Thereafter, she
could see it slipping away
Then less than three minutes
later, the Bears closed the door. A
shot by Leslie Hoffman slipped in
and this game was as good as over.
Keohane was pleased with the
team's efforts, but saw a need for
more practice and game time to
help season a young team.
She recoginized that the slower
Cardinal doesn't have much of a
chance against a team as strong and
fast as the Bears. That is, unless
they "play with each other more
and know where the help is,"
Keohane said. That knowledge will
come only as the young, but
talented, team gains experience..
With their next game tomorrow
on the road with Santa Clara, who
Keohane said is "an up and coming
team like us," the Stanford coach is
looking for better things. Led by
senior-catalyst, Jenny Fechner, the
Broncos are an unpredictable, but
beatable team.
