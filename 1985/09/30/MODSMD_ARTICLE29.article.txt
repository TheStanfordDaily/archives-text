STOCKTON — The Stanford
field hockey team traveled to
Stockton Saturday to challenge
the University of the Pacific,
fully expecting a rugged game.
And they got just what they
expected.
After 70 minutes of regulation
and two 10 minute overtimes of
fast and furious play, the match
ended in a 1-1 tie.
The outcome was a disap
pointing one for Stanford, which
is ranked No.l in the Northern
Pacific Conference, of which
UOP is also a member. The
Cardinal's record is now 1-2-1.
The tie gave UOP a record of 0-
4-1.
"It was a game we knew we
could win ... we had a lot of op
portunities, but we didn't capi
talize on them," Stanford's Lisa
Stuart said.
Head Coach Sheryl Johnson
also mentioned missed opportu
nities, saying the Card "had
more scoring chances than
we've had in other games. We
just didn't finish them."
Stanford forward Amy Good
man opened up the scoring with
just over 10 minutes gone in the
first half. The goal resulted after

a short corner drive ricocheted
off Tiger goalie Cindy Norzing,
who was then challenged for the
ball by Goodman. After a brief
scuffle, Goodman was able to
knock the ball in from short
range.
Stanford maintained its 1-0
lead behind solid defensive work
and fine goalkeeping by fresh
man Karen Jones. It was just
after one of Jones' most dazzling
saves off a high drive that UOP's
Kerry McCracken was able to
gather in the rebound and score
from about 10 feet out. The goal
occurred with five minutes
remaining in the first half.
The second half saw the mo
mentum change frequently as
both teams had many chances to
break the tie. The Tigers threat
ened with a series of short cor
ners for the UOP team as the
half ended, but none resulted in a
goal.
The Cardinal also failed to
convert on a similar series of
short corners towards the end of
the second overtime, and so the
game ended in a frustrating
nrk
"They (UOP) played like I ex
pected ... we let them play their
game," West Regional All-
America Andi Wolpert said. "We
can beat them playing our way."
