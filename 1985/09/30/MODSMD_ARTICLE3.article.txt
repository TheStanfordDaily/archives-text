Members of the Class of 1987 were reminded last Friday that
the start of their third year at Stanford marked a transition per
iod.
This is the year to move from "not majoring to majoring," said
University President Donald Kennedy at the annual Junior Con
vocation held in Memorial Church.
Kennedy was referring not only to the University policy that
demands that students make a choice of a major by this time in
their academic career, but also the philosophical notion that it is
time to explore ideas in depth rather than in breadth, he said.
As Carolyn Lougee, associate dean of Humanities and
Sciences, said, the Class of '87's final two years will bring
"meaning and use to the whole" of their education.
At the convocation, members of the Class of '87 also heard
keynote speeches from two professors who described their ex
periences from their own college years.
Prof. Robert Hofstadter, a Nobel Laureate in physics, spoke
on the struggles and rewards that the juniors now face.
He recalled his early literary ambitions as a freshman at City
College of New York and what he called his rather "turgid"

writing style.
But while success evaded him in English, he did quite well in
physics.
Hofstadter quoted his physics professor with this simple ad
vice: "You're pretty good in physics. Why don't you major in it?"
He followed the suggestion.
Since that time, Hofstadter has enjoyed the benefits that ex
ploring ideas in depth can bring. He mentioned the opportunities
he has had to meet and talk with famous experts, the chance to
advance human knowledge and the personal fulfillment that
comes with that advancement.
He ended his speech by reminding the juniors that today's
world calls for "cool heads, goodwill and lots of intellectual
power." The juniors, he continued, "have the precious quality of
youth in (their) hands. Make use of it and make this a better
world."
Hofstadter's son, Douglas, now a professor of psychology and
cognitive science at the University of Michigan, was the other
keynote speaker. He said he has found flexibility and curiosity
most important in his experiences.
"It is extremely important to play around with ideas. To play
