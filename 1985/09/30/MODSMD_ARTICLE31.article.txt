# Card Proves Much Despite Loss
## 
### 
It's too easy to break games
down to one play. Fourth-and-two
from the Texas 34-yard line. Brad
Muster on a short-side sweep.
Texas stops it. Stanford loses 38-
34.
"It was the wrong play — we
didn't have a chance," Stanford
Coach Jack Elway said. A pass
seemed in order. Perhaps a run to
the wide side. "You want to know
all the things we could have done?
We've got a stack about this high,"
Elway said, holding his hands two
feet apart.

Enough second guessing. After
misfiring for the first 28 minutes,
Stanford looked a 24-3 deficit right
in the face, took a 34-31 lead and al
most pulled off the upset. Sure,
"almost" doesn't count. This one
goes into the "L" column. "Wait 'til
next week" is a poor substitute for,
"We did it." But you get the feeling
that next week can't come soon
enough.
This was the game the Stanford
offense got to show the nation that
it's for real, and the Cardinal
grabbed the chance. This wasn't a
San Jose State from a second-rate
conference. This wasn't an Oregon
that gave up 63 points in its next
outing. This was Texas, a perennial
Southwest Conference power,
maybe a little down this year but an
awfully long way from out.
And the Cardinal offense took it
to the Longhorns. The numbers: 34
points, 448 yards and only one turn
over.
John Paye had another routine
day at quarterback. Paye just sat
back, completed 27 of 40 passes,
picked up 365 yards, three TDs and
no interceptions and he made it all
look so easy. Paye goes out, racks
up a 300- or 400-yard day and it
comes to be expected. It's easy to
get spoiled here.
Muster was held to 40 yards on
the ground. For a lot of backs that
would mean explaining a bad game
in the locker room. Instead Muster
caught 10 passes for 98 yards, in
cluding a tightrope act in the end

zone for a touchdown catch that
looked better on each replay. And
he avoided the fumbles that marred
an otherwise stellar performance in
Oregon the week before.
Jeff James found himself going
one-on-one with the Texas corner
backs all afternoon. "We knew it
was typical for Texas just to try to
beat you with their athletes," he
said. James won this one. He had
10 catches, 168 yards and a pair of
TDs — and there are a few Long
horn corners who'll be seeing fade
patterns in the end zone in their
sleep.
Elway's play-calling up until the
final series took what the Longhorn
defense was giving, with shovel
passes and fade patterns and the
like.
The defense had its moments as
well, giving up onlv two lone

scoring drives to the Longhorns, al
lowing none through three quar
ters. Unfortunately, the Cardinal
allowed 24 points on four major
breakdowns in that time.
"That's the one thing you don't
want to have happen," linebacker
Matt Soderlund said. "You play con
sistent defense, and then you break
down. You have to execute all the
way. I find it disappointing."
Take away those four big plays
— quarterback Bret Stafford's 74-
yard run, Darron Norris's 50-yard
romp, Dunovan Pitts' 55-yard
reception and Norris' 62-yard
scamper — and the Cardinal held
Texas to 194 yards rushing, 92
yards passing and only 14 points.
The trouble is that they count, and
until the big plays are eliminated,
the Cardiac Card routine is likely to
continue. Last team to score wins.

Our offense can outscore your of
fense. Eighty yards and a cloud of
paydirt.
It makes for exciting football. If
you want fireworks, the Stanford
offense can outdo the Fourth of July
show at Moffett Field. The Cardinal
is averaging 490 yards and 34
points a game. The problem is that
it's given up more than 500 yards
and 38 points in each of the last two
games.
The Cardinal has shown it can
upset a powerhouse like Texas. If
the defense can get rid of the
breakdowns, bowl game reserva
tions may not be out of the ques
tion. If it can't, look for John Elway
era football — lots of points, lots of
excitement and lots of 5-6 records.
"Excitement" just doesn't mean
a whole lot when you lose.

The Longhorns crossed the plane of the endzone from both near and afar. Texas manufactured
big plays and protracted drives. All told, the visitors ran and passed for 527 yards.

outing. This was Texas, a perennial
Southwest Conference power,
maybe a little down this year but an
awfully long way from out.
And the Cardinal offense took it
to the Longhorns. The numbers: 34
points, 448 yards and only one turn
over.
John Paye had another routine
day at quarterback. Paye just sat
back, completed 27 of 40 passes,
picked up 365 yards, three TDs and
no interceptions and he made it all
look so easy. Paye goes out, racks
up a 300- or 400-yard day and it
comes to be expected. It's easy to
get spoiled here.
Muster was held to 40 yards on
the ground. For a lot of backs that
would mean explaining a bad game
in the locker room. Instead Muster
caught 10 passes for 98 yards, in
cluding a tightrope act in the end

zone for a touchdown catch that
looked better on each replay. And
he avoided the fumbles that marred
an otherwise stellar performance in
Oregon the week before.
Jeff James found himself going
one-on-one with the Texas corner
backs all afternoon. "We knew it
was typical for Texas just to try to
beat you with their athletes," he
said. James won this one. He had
10 catches, 168 yards and a pair of
TDs — and there are a few Long
horn corners who'll be seeing fade
patterns in the end zone in their
sleep.
Elway's play-calling up until the
final series took what the Longhorn
defense was giving, with shovel
passes and fade patterns and the
like.
The defense had its moments as
well, giving up onlv two lone

scoring drives to the Longhorns, al
lowing none through three quar
ters. Unfortunately, the Cardinal
allowed 24 points on four major
breakdowns in that time.
"That's the one thing you don't
want to have happen," linebacker
Matt Soderlund said. "You play con
sistent defense, and then you break
down. You have to execute all the
way. I find it disappointing."
Take away those four big plays
— quarterback Bret Stafford's 74-
yard run, Darron Norris's 50-yard
romp, Dunovan Pitts' 55-yard
reception and Norris' 62-yard
scamper — and the Cardinal held
Texas to 194 yards rushing, 92
yards passing and only 14 points.
The trouble is that they count, and
until the big plays are eliminated,
the Cardiac Card routine is likely to
continue. Last team to score wins.

Our offense can outscore your of
fense. Eighty yards and a cloud of
paydirt.
It makes for exciting football. If
you want fireworks, the Stanford
offense can outdo the Fourth of July
show at Moffett Field. The Cardinal
is averaging 490 yards and 34
points a game. The problem is that
it's given up more than 500 yards
and 38 points in each of the last two
games.
The Cardinal has shown it can
upset a powerhouse like Texas. If
the defense can get rid of the
breakdowns, bowl game reserva
tions may not be out of the ques
tion. If it can't, look for John Elway
era football — lots of points, lots of
excitement and lots of 5-6 records.
"Excitement" just doesn't mean
a whole lot when you lose.

The Longhorns crossed the plane of the endzone from both near and afar. Texas manufactured
big plays and protracted drives. All told, the visitors ran and passed for 527 yards.
