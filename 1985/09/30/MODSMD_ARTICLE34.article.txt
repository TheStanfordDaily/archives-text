Inquiry To Follow Rioting
LONDON — Home Secretary Douglas Hurd announced an im
mediate inquiry yesterday after racial violence, sparked by the police
shooting of a black woman, swept London's Brixton area in a repeti
tion of the clashes that tore it apart in 1981.
The district, a mainly black slum area with a massive unemploy
ment problem, was calm again yesterday after hundreds of young
blacks fought street battles with police.
Stores, homes and cars were set ablaze, motorists and passers-by
were attacked and the main police station was pelted by gasoline
bombs and stones at the height of the violence late Saturday.
Forty-four people were arrested after 1,000 police sealed off the
district. A final count put the injured at 36.
The woman, Cherry Groce, a mother of six, was in intensive care
Sunday with a bullet in her spine. Police said the shooting happened
during a search of her home for her 19-year-old son, suspected of
breaking and entering.
Police said a 42-year-old inspector was responsible for the shoot
ing and a spokesman expressed regret over the "tragic accident." A
lawyer for Groce announced that legal action would be taken against
the police.
As word of the shooting spread, a group of some 200 youths gath
ered outside a police station, and the general violence generated
from there.
At the height of the clashes, three subway stations were shut, a
main line was closed because of fires on the tracks and the entire
area was sealed off as a total of 28 buildings and 20 cars burned.
Eyewitnesses said cars were stopped on the open street and their
occupants were pulled out so the vehicles could be set on fire and
used as barricades against the police.
The clashes upset the delicate task of community workers, black
representatives and police to prevent more riots like those that hit
Brixton in 1981.
The latest flare-up came just a few weeks after similar rioting in a
slum area of Birmingham, Britain's second-largest city, which had
already prompted fresh debate on allegations of police brutality and
social and economic problems gripping inner-city areas.
Quake Death Toll Climbs
MEXICO CITY — Police raised the death toll from the devastat
ing Sept. 19-20 earthquakes to more than 4,600 Saturday, and the
U.S. Embassy raised the total of American dead to 10, with 24 more
U.S. citizens still missing.
Meanwhile, police reported no new damage or injuries from a brief
5.0 aftershock that struck the capital late Friday night, sending
frightened residents out into the streets.
Rescue efforts continued Saturday at sites where there were
heavy casualties from the first quake, registering 8.1 on the Richter
scale. Success, however, appeared less and less likely.
The last reported rescue of a survivor occured late Friday at a
clothes factory in Mexico City's garment district. Rescuers pulled
out a seamstress from the jumbled top floors after listening equip
ment detected movement inside.
To win time, heavy equipment was employed to lift off collapsed
floors while daring Mexican rescuers called "moles" crept belly-down
through makeshift tunnels into the debris. The heavy equipment,
pulling giant slabs of concrete from atop jumbles of debris, replaced
the delicate tunnel-digging of days past and gave Saturday's rescue
efforts a different look.
For several days, Mexican wrecking crews have been eager to
knock down Juarez Hospital, initially for fear of epidemic from rotting
bodies. However, the chances of epidemic are considered slim be
cause the cadavers are not exposed to the air nor are microbes en
tering the city's water supply from the site.
Kremlin Chooses New Premier
MOSCOW — Nikolai Ryzhkov, so little known in the Soviet capital
that his biography does not list a birthplace, has catapulted from the
job of general manager of a machine factory in Sverdlovsk to premier
of the Soviet Union in a decade, a rise through the bureaucracy that
took his predecessor, Nikolai Tikhonov, 25 years.
Appointed chairman of the Council of Ministers by the Presidium
of the Supreme Soviet on the eve of his 56th birthday, Ryzhkov is an
engineer by education with a reputation as a skillful manager and a
sound knowledge of economics.
Elected to the 300-member Soviet Central Committee at the 26th

Communist Party congress
in 1981, Ryzhkov, a protege
of the late Soviet leader Yuri
Andropov, began his
meteoric rise in 1982, when
Andropov replaced Leonid
Brezhnev.
Under Andropov,
Ryzhkov became a secretary
and chief economic expert of
the Central Committee in
1982. He most likely had
close association with Gorba
chev, also a Central Commit
tee secretary and economic
expert at that time. Last
April Gorbachev ushered
Ryzhkov into the ruling Polit
buro, along with Egor
Ligachev, widely recognized
as the second-ranking Polit
buro member. A tall, com
manding figure with dark,

graying hair, Ryzhkov began his career as a mining foreman in
Sverdlovsk after graduating from the Ural Polytechnic Institute. He
became deputy director of the Uralmashzavod heavy machine build
ing plant in Sverdlovsk in 1959, and rose to become general director
of the plant, where he remained until 1975, when he moved to Mos
cow to work at a Soviet government planning and budget commis
sion.
Separatist Leader Resigns
MONTREAL — Rene Levesque, one of the most controversial
politicians in North America, said goodby as a leader Friday to mem
bers of his party and to the public that he tried unsuccessfully to mold
into an independent nation.
A sometimes tearful, sometimes cheering crowd of several
thousand Parti Quebecois faithful crowded into a hockey rink in a
working-class, French-speaking neighborhood to hear Levesque,
62, make his farewells.
