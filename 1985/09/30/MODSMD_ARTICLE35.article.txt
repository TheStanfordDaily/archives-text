# U.S. Cautiously Welcomes Arms Overture
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State George
Shultz said yesterday he welcomed the Soviet
Union's proposal for a 50 percent cut in strategic
offensive weapons, but warned again that Presi
dent Reagan would not abandon research and
testing of his Strategic Defense Initiative in ex
change for progress in the Geneva arms talks.
In a White House meeting Friday, Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze gave
Reagan a letter from Soviet leader Mikhail Gor
bachev broadly outlining the arms control pro
posal that the Soviets will present at the Geneva
arms talks this week. U.S. and Soviet officials
have refused to disclose details of the proposal.
In separate television interviews, Shultz and
Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Perle
stressed that Reagan was sincere in saying he
will not use SDI, also known as "Star Wars," as
"a bargaining chip."
The United States, they said, considers it ur
gent to continue SDI research. They empasized
that the Administration reserved the right to
conduct the kind of testing permitted by the
1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty (ABM).
However, their remarks contained a hint that
there might be some give in the U.S. position on
testing.
"Any deal on research would be ridiculous be
cause there is absolutely no way to verify if it's
being observed. . .The president is not going to
give it up," Shultz said on NBC-TV's "Meet the
Press."
But when asked about testing and develop
ment of space weapons, Shultz was less vehe
ment: "What we are doing is within the
framework of the (ABM) treaty, which does not
prohibit certain kinds of testing."
Shultz and Perle also acknowledged that the
Administration was uncertain about the extent to
which the Soviet proposal would encompass

large land-based intercontinental missiles. Such
weapons are the core of Moscow's nuclear force.
However, a senior U.S. official said yesterday
that Shevardnardze left the impression that Mos
cow wants to base the 50 percent reduction on
strategic nuclear "charges," including missile
warheads, nuclear bombs, short-range attack
missiles aboard bombers and other weapons ca
pable of striking Soviet or U.S. territory.
Without further "sublimits" on particular
weapons, such a proposal would do little to cut

back Moscow's arsenal of heavy land-based
missiles.
That concern was alluded to by Perle, who
noted that the Soviet proposal could turn out to
be a throwback to ideas advanced by the Soviets
in the '70s and rejected by the U.S. as
propaganda ploys.
Asked about Perle's comment, Shultz replied,
"I don't know whether it's a step backwards or
forwards. We have to see what's being talked
about. But if the proposal is to go back to the
idea that all warheads are the same, and that's
what Mr. Perle was talking about — I agree with
him."
However, Shultz rejected suggestions that
the Soviet proposals should be written off as
propaganda. He counseled a wait-and-see ap
proach.
"What's new is that they have brought forward
a proposal, or will in Geneva tomorrow, that
deals with offensive matters," he said. "To date,
they haven't done that before. We welcome that.
"We're not trying to project optimism or pes
simism," Shultz continued. "We're trying to proj
ect realism. . . . We have proposals on the table.
Apparently the Soviets will put some proposals
on the table on Monday or Tuesday. We
welcome that, and will see where we go from
there."
In his weekly radio broadcast Saturday, Presi
dent Reagan welcomed the Soviet Union's coun
terproposal and said he hopes that it addresses
U.S. concerns and is "free of preconditions and
other obstacles to progress."
Reagan gave no details of the Gorbachev let
ter as he discussed negotiations with Moscow.
