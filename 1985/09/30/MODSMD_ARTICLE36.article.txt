# Hostages May Come Before Press
## 
### 
BEIRUT, Lebanon â€” A caller
claiming to, speak for Islamic Jihad,
a shadowy group holding six
Americans hostage here said yes
terday that some of the prisoners
would hold a press conference and
address a message to American
public opinion and the U.S. govern
ment.
The caller did not indicate when
or how the press conference would
take place or who among the
hostages would participate. But he
warned that after it takes place, the
U.S. government would have to
"assume full responsibility for the
lives of the hostages."

If the captives, some of whom
have been held for more than a
year, are produced at a press con
ference, it would be their first
public appearance since being
kidnaped.
While the caller made no
demands on behalf of the captors,
the warning suggested that
demands might be made at the
press conference. The Rev. Ben
jamin Weir, a Presbyterian minister
freed Sept. 14 after 16 months in
captivity, said Islamic Jihad was
prepared to execute the remaining
American hostages if Kuwait did
not' free 17 terrorists it has con

victed in a series of 1983 bombings.
U.S. officials said in Washington
that they had no independent con
firmation of the reported press con
ference. Secretary of State George
Shultz, appearing on NBC's "Meet
the Press," said he had heard noth
ing about the report through
diplomatic channels. "We welcome
any release, but want all of the
hostages back," he said.
Shultz also said the United States
would not press Kuwait to free its
prisoners. "We don't think it is wise
to pressure for the release of
people who are being held for. . .
killing people there in exchange for

the hostages," Shultz said. "We
don't agree with the approach of
bargaining with people who are kid
naping or hijacking or whatever."
Yesterday's messages came in
anonymous calls to two news
agency offices here. In both, a
male, Arabic-speaking caller
claimed to represent Islamic Jihad,
or Islamic Holy War, a shadowy ter
rorist group that has claimed re
sponsibility in similar calls for a
number of kidnapings and bomb at
tacks against U.S. Embassy build
ings and other western targets.
There was no way to authenticate
the calls.
