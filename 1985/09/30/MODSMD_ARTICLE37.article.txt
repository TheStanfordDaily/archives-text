Weakened Gloria Hits
WASHINGTON — Hurricane Gloria struck
no more than a glancing blow to the East Coast
Friday, tearing down power lines and crushing
fishing piers but leaving far less damage than
weather experts feared from a storm that
started out as one of the most dangerous to
move up the Atlantic in the last 50 years.
Five deaths were blamed on Gloria, whose
rapid passage by the coasts of Maryland, Dela
ware and New Jersey and across eastern Long
Island and parts of southern New England
forced the evacuation of more than half a mil
lion people. The hurricane struck first just
north of Cape Hatteras, N.C., at Buxton, with
130 mph winds just after 1 a.m. Friday, then
hurried up the coast. By mid-afternoon, it had
weakened noticeably when it ran aground in
Connecticut. By the time the storm had raced
up the Connecticut River into Vermont, its
winds were down to 50 mph and the thick gray
clouds it left behind were replaced by blue
skies and sunshine from North Carolina to
New York.
In New York City, skyscrapers — including
the 110-story World Trade Center — were

closed. The New York Stock Exchange and
the mercantile and commodity exchanges
closed. All three New York City area airports
were closed.
Despite the warnings, there was a long trail
of damage in Gloria's wake. The boardwalks in
Ocean City and Atlantic City were torn to
splinters in many places. At the storm's
height, 15-foot waves rolled right under the
Atlantic City boardwalk, sending water up
through its planks like geysers, buckling the
boardwalk and rocking its light poles as if they
were toys.
Deficit Is Top Worry
Four out of every five Americans are now
calling on the federal government to reduce
the massive federal budget deficit before
trying to revamp the nation's tax system, a
Los Angeles Times Poll has found.
The new survey found that by a four-to-one
margin Americans believe reducing the deficit
should be an immediate priority over tax
reform. Support for President Reagan's pro
posal is now divided, with almost as many

Americans against it as in favor.
Fifty-eight percent of those polled say they
believe President Reagan is doing a good job
overall. In July, a Times poll found that 63 per
cent approved of his performance.
Most of those surveyed expect Congress to
revise Reagan's tax proposal drastically, and
most do not believe any reform package will
win approval this year. About half of those
polled believe there will be a tax increase this
year.
17 Killed in Crash
JENKINSBURG, Ga. — An airplane filled
with parachutists crashed on takeoff from a
private rural airstrip yesterday, killing all 17
people aboard, officials said.
The single-engine Cessna 208 Caravan
crashed in a pasture around 12:30 p.m., said
Federal Aviation Administration spokesman
Roger Myers.
"The airplane was apparently climbing out
after taking off and a witness stated that the
engine stalled," said Preston Hicks, a National
Transportation Safety Board investigator who
was on the scene.
