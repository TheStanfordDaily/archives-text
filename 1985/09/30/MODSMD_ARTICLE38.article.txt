Lawyers Defy State
SAN DIEGO — Declaring defiance of the
Legislature, State Bar delegates voted unani
mously yesterday to urge their leaders to act
on their own, if necessary, to collect dues from
lawyers, while their new president vowed to
keep the bar afloat.
"I pick no quarrel and want none, but I say
that the bar stays in the business it is in — all
of it," San Francisco attorney David Heilbron
said as he began a one-year term as president
of the organization of California's 95,000
lawyers, now facing one of the most difficult
periods in its history.
The bar's dues, now a maximum of $180 a
year, provide about $18 million of its $25 mil

lion budget. The Legislature has approved the
annual dues level for about a half century, but
two weeks ago, in an action generally believed
to be the first of its kind, legislators blocked
passage of the bar's 1986 dues bill, which in
cluded a $35 increase.
Rustling in East Bay
WALNUT CREEK — Cattle rustling in the
space age? Correct.
Ranchers and law enforcement officers say
cattle theft, 20th century style, is returning as
a serious problem on the ranges east and south
of San Francisco Bay.
Officials say the thieves, out for fun, profit

or free steaks, use trucks, not horses. And
they wear running shoes instead of boots. As
of old, they often alter brands, and work under
cover of night.
Those who get caught don't face lynching
any more. The charge is usually grand theft,
and the penalty can be up to three years be
hind bars.
Investigators say some of the rustling is
done by professional cowboys who drive
trucks to corrals and quickly transport cattle
out of the state, but that much of the theft is
done by suburbanites who live on the edges of
the ranchlands.
Authorities report they can't pinpoint the
exact number of cattle butcherings, only that
they have been many.
