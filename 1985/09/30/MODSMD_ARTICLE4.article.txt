### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
Two Stanford police officers were
released from Stanford Hospital Saturday
night after sustaining injuries during pur
suit of a man who was fleeing from his car
after being pulled over for speeding earlier
in the day.
A suspect in the case, identified as Mat
thew B. Conway, is being held in lieu of
$50,000 bail at North County Jail in Palo
Alto, charged with six felony counts, in
cluding assault with a deadly weapon and
assaulting a police officer.
Conway, 24, is a San Mateo resident and
not a student at the University.
According to the University News Ser

vice, officer Keith Viveiros observed a car
speeding on Campus Drive near Wilbur
Field early Saturday evening and
proceeded to stop the vehicle, asking the
driver to get out of the car.
When Viveiros attempted to handcuff
Conway, a struggle ensued and the officer
was knocked face-first to the ground. The
suspect, according to witnesses, fled on
foot across the field, chased by officer
Hilary Karp, the back-up officer radioed
for earlier by Viveiros.
Karp managed to stop Conway, but was
struck two or three times in the head with
his police radio, according to the news ser
vice.

The paramedics adminstering aid to fallen officer Keith Viveiros caught the
attention of a worried child.
Conway apparently continued to flee, run
ning across the parking lot between Toyon
and Branner Halls.
Freshman Scott Murdock, a Branner resi
dent, who was resting on the lawn in front of
his dorm, witnessed the last part of the
chase.
"I saw this pretty big and fat guy come run
ning down Escondido (Road) and then he cut
across the lawn and brushed by me. He said
something like "Whatever they tell you, don't
believe it.'
"He made it just barely to the lawn at Wil
bur and stopped and saw that he was going to
get caught and said stuff like 'I'm sorry, I give
up, I'm scared,' " Murdock said, adding that
the suspect then laid down on the grass.
According to freshman Greg Louden, an
other Branner resident on the lawn at the

time, when Conway cut across the Branner
lawn, the suspect said "Whatever those cops
say, don't do it."
Louden added that the suspect appeared
intoxicated. "He was kind of weaving as he
crossed the lawn," Louden said.
Louden said at least three officers put the
suspect in the back of a police car. One of the
officers held Conway by his hair.
"He must have done something because
they really had him down," Louden said,
noting that the suspect said "You can let go of
my hair, I'm getting into the car."
Louden and Murdock both placed the inci
dent between 6-7 p.m.
The suspect, according to David Kravetz,
a Daily photographer covering the incident,
was driving a brown, late-model vehicle. He
said a beer bottle was resting on the roof of
the car.
A complete police report of the incident
will be filed this morning, according to the
police.
