# Professors Examine Anti-Semitism
## 
### CHARLES SEAVEY 
Since the Enlightenment, Western man has
prided himself on his rationality and his
humanity. He has seen himself as reaching
toward the apex of civilization as he rids himself
of ignorance, superstition and prejudice.
Indeed, great advances have been made in re
ducing such things as racism based on skin color,
inequality between the sexes, superstition and
class stratification.
Yet one form of prejudice remains elusive,
even mysterious, in the way it persistently
resurfaces in various and terrifying ways.
The prejudice referred to is Jew hatred, or, to
use the more popular though less specific term;
anti-Semitism.
The views of various members of the Stanford
community who are well-informed about the sub
ject of Jew hatred demonstrate the complexity of
this phenomenon. And the very diversity of their
opinions proves that there are no easy answers.
Jon Reider, who taught a course on anti-
Semitism before taking a job in the Admissions
Office this fall, considers the phenomenon of Jew
hatred to be a "great puzzle."
He cited as an example the Nazi Holocaust:
"Consider what happened in Nazi Germany. You
can look at the Holocaust historically, tracing the
day to day events that led up to the murder; you
can try to explain things by economic conditions,

by the ignorance and the apathy of the German
people and so on. But even if you add all of these
things up, it still fails to fundamentally explain
what happened."
Reider divides Jew hatred into two major
types. The first he described as criticism and
resentment on the part of "cosmopolitans" that
Jews are "exclusivists" and "unwilling to partici
pate in the modern world."

Judaism is always safe and
easy to blame. I'm
surprised they haven't
blamed the earthquake in
Mexico on the Jews yet.
— Jon Reider

"Voltaire is an example of someone who was
of this opinion," he said.
The second sort of Jew hatred that Reider
mentioned would perhaps be more aptly des
cribed as fear. "It takes the form of accusing
Jews of subversion — the idea that Jews are in
herently 'radical,' inherently 'communist.' This is

the more prevalent and dangerous type of anti-
Semitic feeling."
Rabbi Ari Cartun of Hillel, on the other hand,
does not find Jew hatred extremely difficult to
explain. "It's a case of sibling rivalry. In many
respects, brothers get along much worse with
each other than they do with those outside the
family.
"In the same way, Jew hatred is a bigger prob
lem in the Western world than in the Eastern
world. Buddhists don't care if you're Jewish.
Hindus don't care. Taoists don't care. They have
their own separate stability. In the West, it's a
competition, and the question is who will get the
inheritance. There is nothing in the Jewish faith
itself which engenders these kinds of
responses," he said.
Yet another view is the historical perspective
of Gordon Craig, professor of history emeritus:
"To explain why anti-Semitic feelings have been
so widespread throughout history would take
hours," he said.
In Craig's book, "Germany," however, he at
tempts to explain a specific eruption of Jew
hatred by analyzing one of the most heinous
cases of anti-Semitism, the Nazi Holocaust.
He cited a number of factors which, when
combined, resulted in the slaughter of the Jews.
The factors included an upsurge in popular anti-
Jewish feelings (independent of Hitler),
