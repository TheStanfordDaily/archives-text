# Professors Examine Anti-Semitism
## 
### CHARLES SEAVEY 
Since the Enlightenment, Western man has
prided himself on his rationality and his
humanity. He has seen himself as reaching
toward the apex of civilization as he rids himself
of ignorance, superstition and prejudice.
Indeed, great advances have been made in re
ducing such things as racism based on skin color,
inequality between the sexes, superstition and
class stratification.
Yet one form of prejudice remains elusive,
even mysterious, in the way it persistently
resurfaces in various and terrifying ways.
The prejudice referred to is Jew hatred, or, to
use the more popular though less specific term;
anti-Semitism.
The views of various members of the Stanford
community who are well-informed about the sub
ject of Jew hatred demonstrate the complexity of
this phenomenon. And the very diversity of their
opinions proves that there are no easy answers.
Jon Reider, who taught a course on anti-
Semitism before taking a job in the Admissions
Office this fall, considers the phenomenon of Jew
hatred to be a "great puzzle."
He cited as an example the Nazi Holocaust:
"Consider what happened in Nazi Germany. You
can look at the Holocaust historically, tracing the
day to day events that led up to the murder; you
can try to explain things by economic conditions,

by the ignorance and the apathy of the German
people and so on. But even if you add all of these
things up, it still fails to fundamentally explain
what happened."
Reider divides Jew hatred into two major
types. The first he described as criticism and
resentment on the part of "cosmopolitans" that
Jews are "exclusivists" and "unwilling to partici
pate in the modern world."

Judaism is always safe and
easy to blame. I'm
surprised they haven't
blamed the earthquake in
Mexico on the Jews yet.
— Jon Reider

"Voltaire is an example of someone who was
of this opinion," he said.
The second sort of Jew hatred that Reider
mentioned would perhaps be more aptly des
cribed as fear. "It takes the form of accusing
Jews of subversion — the idea that Jews are in
herently 'radical,' inherently 'communist.' This is

the more prevalent and dangerous type of anti-
Semitic feeling."
Rabbi Ari Cartun of Hillel, on the other hand,
does not find Jew hatred extremely difficult to
explain. "It's a case of sibling rivalry. In many
respects, brothers get along much worse with
each other than they do with those outside the
family.
"In the same way, Jew hatred is a bigger prob
lem in the Western world than in the Eastern
world. Buddhists don't care if you're Jewish.
Hindus don't care. Taoists don't care. They have
their own separate stability. In the West, it's a
competition, and the question is who will get the
inheritance. There is nothing in the Jewish faith
itself which engenders these kinds of
responses," he said.
Yet another view is the historical perspective
of Gordon Craig, professor of history emeritus:
"To explain why anti-Semitic feelings have been
so widespread throughout history would take
hours," he said.
In Craig's book, "Germany," however, he at
tempts to explain a specific eruption of Jew
hatred by analyzing one of the most heinous
cases of anti-Semitism, the Nazi Holocaust.
He cited a number of factors which, when
combined, resulted in the slaughter of the Jews.
The factors included an upsurge in popular anti-
Jewish feelings (independent of Hitler),
deplorable economic conditions and
the extreme anti-Semitic paranoia
of Germany's new and politically
very talented leader, Adolf Hitler.
Craig explained that while those
next in command to Hitler agreed
that the Jews should lose their
citizenship and eventually be
deported, it was Hitler's idea to
"destroy" the Jews when deporta
tion became impossible.
In this sense, it was Hitler's pow
erful position that allowed his cor
rupt ideas to become the policy of
Germany's already partially corrupt
leaders and populace.
There is nothing that Craig has
written nor is there anything which
he stated in his interview which
would indicate that he views Jew
hatred as not being historically ex
plainable.
So while Craig finds the phenom
enon of Jew hatred to be complex,
he does not, like Reider, find it so
complex as to be inexplicable.
The idea of latent anti-Semitism
adds confusion and a modern twist
to this already convoluted issue. A
statement or action is defined as
latently anti-Semitic if the motiva
tion for the statement or action is
basically aversion to Jews even
though one supplies other justifica
tions (ethical, political or otherwise)
for it.
"Many people have always hated
Jews; they're just waiting for a
chance to express it. These things
don't go away suddenly." This
opinion, as expressed by Craig, en
capsulates the fears of most Jews in
the modern day.
Indeed, the resurgence of anti
semitism in the U.S. in the form of
such groups as the Aryan
Nationalists, The Order and the Ku
Klux Klan seems to confirm the
validity of these fears.
"Things are tougher for the farm
ers, so they look around for
culprits. They don't see the real

culprits; they just take the easiest
explanation," said Craig.
Reider agreed: "One of the first
victims when a liberal democracy
starts to fail is the Jew. Judaism is
always safe and easy to blame." He

added with a laugh, "I'm surprised
they haven't blamed the earthquake
in Mexico on the Jews yet."
Yet some question whether
there is too much fear of latent anti-
Semitism in the modern world.

This complaint most often crops
up when those who say that they
are criticizing the policies of Israel
as a state find themselves accused
of making "latently anti-Semitic"
statements.

One professor said of Columbia
University, for example, "Jews use
the anti-Zionism equals anti-
Semitism charge to deny me the
right to criticize Israel."
Zionism is the movement in fa

vor, formerly of establishing, now
of maintaining the Jewish state of
Israel.
Rabbi Cartun agreed that this is a
sensitive distinction to make. "I
think that anti-Israeli sentiments
are often argued and pictured in
anti-Semitic ways, but I don't
believe every comment against Is
rael is anti-Semitic.
The problem is that many non-
Jews equate Zionism and Judaism.
The conclusion to draw, it seems,
concerning latent anti-semitism is
that it is necessary to be aware of
both extremes. It is necessary for
non-Jews to be sensitive to the
deeper sentiments that may
animate their perfectly logical
criticisms of Israel, just as it is ne
cessary for Jews to differentiate be
tween fear and paranoia.
The one aspect of Jew hatred
that was encouraging to all three of
the men interviewed was the fact
that anti-semitism is not politically
acceptable in the United States.
But fear remains. "I'm not sitting
around worrying," said Reider,
"but when something terrible hap
pens to Jews, I'm not surprised."
Craig concurred with these
words of warning. "People rake up
every bad thing the Jews have
done, and they make the Jews the
targets of fantastic stories. For in
stance, pseudo-intellectuals are
trying to prove that the Holocaust
didn't happen; they say all those
victims really just suffered from
typhoid. We historians have a
simple rule: if you have a simple ex
planation for what happened, why
look for a complicated one? But the
problem is that people like fantasy.
"Sometimes anti-Semitism is
really just a deep-seated sentiment
against Jews; sometimes it's caused
by economic pressure; sometimes
it's just, as in the example I just
mentioned, intellectual crankiness.
It's a mixed picture, but all of it to
gether is kind of disturbing. It has
to be watched all the time," he said.


This cartoon from an Arab newspaper illustrates the seemingly
endless confrontation between the Arab and Jewish peoples,
one facet of the phenomenon of Jew hatred which has most

modern scholars puzzling — even after thousands of years.
Local professors hold different views on why it still exists, but
they agree that there is an issue to contend with.
