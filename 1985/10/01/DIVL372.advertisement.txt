Get our new $49* software module
when you buy an HP-41.
It's a deal that has no equal, for a calculator that has
no equal,
Our new HP-41 Advantage software module packs
12K of ROM. One and a half times the capacity of any
other HP-41 module. Large enough to hold the most
popular engineering, mathematical and financial pro
grams ever written for the HP-41.
You get comprehensive advanced matrix math func
tions, roots of equations and polynomials, integrations,
base conversion and logic functions, and time value of
money functions.
J§ Our new module is also sub-programmable. So you
can quickly access just a portion of a program, or trans
fer that section to your own program.
And it's even menu-driven. That eliminates overlays
and reduces the number of prompts.
jjjjk In short, you get everything its going to take to help
you make the grade in everything from Linear Algebra
to Physics to Electronics to Statics and Dynamics.
The HP-41 is a deal all its own. Its operating
It system is so advanced, it doesn't need an "equals"
wk, - s key. Little wonder it's preferred by more engineers
than any other calculator.
