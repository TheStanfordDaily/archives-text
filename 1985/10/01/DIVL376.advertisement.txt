COMPATIBLE.
EXPANDABLE. FIEXBLE.
The AT&T Personal Computer 6300.
It runs thousands of popular MS-DOS* software
packages, but two to three times faster than the
IBM PC. It has a high resolution screen with double
the usual density for unusually good graphics. It's
expandable, too, with new options and enhancements
that can keep it growing as you grow.
The AT&T PC. It's a superior buy today with
something most other PC's don't offer—the future.
