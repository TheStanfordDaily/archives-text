# SOSA Rallies 100 To March
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL 
More than 100 students and faculty gathered
in White Plaza yesterday for a Stanford Out of
South Africa (SOSA) rally that culminated in a
march to University President Donald Ken
nedy's office with a petition demanding the
release of all political prisoners in South Africa.
Members of the faculty, the Black Student
Union (BSU) and United Stanford Workers
adressed the crowd at the hour-long gathering,
SOSA's first campus-wide activity this academic
year.
Apartheid is "our generation's Naziism,"
senior David Troutt, BSU and SOSA member,
told the lunchtime crowd.
"It's our legacy to change this. Our generation
can be remembered," Troutt said.
At 1 p.m., after circulating copies of the peti
tion for signatures, approximately 40 students,
chanting "Apartheid has got to go" and "Divest
now" collected outside Kennedy's office in the
Inner Quad and presented the petition to Mar
lene Wine, special assistant to the president.
Wine assured the protesters that the petition
would be delivered to Kennedy.
The petition demands "the unconditional
release of all political prisoners in South Africa,
including in particular the UDF (United Demo
cratic Front) defendents and Nelson Mandela,
the recognized leader of black South Africans
who has been held in jail on similar political
charges for over 20 years."
It also condemns "South African government's
use of arbitrary preventive detention, imprison
ment and outright violence to repress black poli

tical protest," objecting particularly to "the cur
rent trial of Rev. Boesak and 15 other leaders of
the non-violent UDF on trumped-up treason
charges."
Kennedy was not available for comment on
the petition.
According to SOSA member David Romo, the
petition is intended to demonstrate that while
Kennedy sympathizes with the plight of black
South Africa, he refuses to divest Stanford funds
from companies that do business in South Africa.
SOSA intends to cause "an escalation of pres
sure on the Board of Trustees," Romo said.
"We want to make them increasingly uncom

fortable about the fact that the University is
being funded by the degradation of other human
beings," Romo added.
Several of the speakers at White Plaza, includ
ing Political Science Prof. Joel Samoff, empha
sized the relevance of the apartheid issue to the
Stanford community.
"Something is wrong in our own community if
we support white rule," Samoff told the crowd.
Troutt echoed Samoff's remarks, saying that
those who feel that South Africa is "too far
away" should look at their own communities.
"Racism is doing very well here at home,"
Troutt said.
