Giving is a natural response to aid the victims of a
natural disaster, and the Stanford community's
response to the Mexican earthquake has been im
pressive.
The Mexican catastrophy has claimed over 4,000
lives and caused tens of billions of dollars in damage.
The University has responded in a variety of com
mendable ways, realizing that we too are potential
victims of such a catastrophy.
Individuals are collecting donations to forward to
institutions like the Red Cross and other interna
tional relief agencies with proven credibility; the
Stanford Ham Radio Club provided emergency com
munication, so Mexicans at Stanford could get news
of their families in the disaster-stricken area; and
other organizations, such as the Stanford Volunteer
Network, have joined the effort to help the victims.
Perhaps the most original contribution came from

members of the freshman class, who are selling T
shirts to generate money for the Red Cross.
But more is needed. The excavations and rescue
efforts of trapped survivors continue. The injured
and homeless are desparate for medicine and shel
ter. The massive rebulding project of Mexico City
and the other damaged areas has scarcely begun.
And much more is needed on a long-term basis.
New buildings, especially hospitals, must be safer
â€” as earthquake-proof as technology and resources
will permit. As recent national elections in Mexico
show, the politically and economically troubled state
is also in need of reform.
Stanford students are among the most privileged
people in the world. We must therefore keep trying
to help others, like we have tried to help the famine
victims of the drought in Ethiopia. Now and tomor
row, we are the world.
