## Myths Promote Middle East Strife 
### 
One of the barriers to rational discussion of
the Middle East conflict is the continued survival
of long-discredited myths. Corey Multer (The
Daily, Sept. 27) breathed new life into several of
them. He wrote, for instance, that in 1948
"Palestinians were publicly warned to leave Is
rael until the area was 'purged' of Jews. . . .
Upon this urging, most Palestinians voluntarily
left Israel." Is it believable that more than

VIEWPOINT

300,000 people would voluntarily leave all they
owned — homes, thriving businesses, farms and
orchards — simply at the behest of some foreign
government? The evidence shows they did not.
The Palestinians fled in fear after what the Ency
clopedia Britannica calls "a campaign of psycho
logical terror." Former Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin boasted of this campaign in his
autobiography, "The Revolt." According to
Begin, after his forces massacred more than 250
inhabitants of the Arab village of Deir Yassin in
April 1948, "Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of
Eretz Israel. . . . The Arabs began to flee in ter
ror." In 1961 a British study concluded that
there was "not a single order, or appeal or sug
gestion about evacuation from Palestine from
any Arab radio station, inside or outside
Palestine in 1948." There can be legitimate disa
greement about how best to resolve Palestinian
grievances, but it seems both cruel and dis
honest to serve up the myth of voluntary exodus
in order to suggest that these grievances don't
exist.
Multer claims incorrectly that Jordan was
"created to be a Palestinian homeland" and urges

that it be used as such. The truth is that in 1922,
Jordan was exempted from the Palestine
mandate because Great Britain wanted to pla
cate Emir Abdullah Ibn Hussein, whose family
had been ousted as rulers of Syria. Even if today
Jordan should miraculously agree to turn over its
sovereignty, the fact is that more than a million
and a quarter Palestinians live in the West Bank
and Gaza, territories that Israel captured in 1967
and that Palestinians have inhabited since ancient
times. This is the land that Palestinians consider
to be their home and from which they derive
their sense of nationhood. The only way they
could be persuaded to move to Jordan is by brute

force, a process that would horrify most Israelis
as well as the rest of the world.
Multer's suggestion that one of the Arab na
tions "welcome its brethren" and set aside land
for a Palestinian homeland demonstrates his
poor understanding of what "Arab" means. The
fact that Palestinians and, say, Moroccans speak
Arabic does not make them "brethren" in the
sense of nationality any more than a common
language unites New Zealanders and the Irish.
At present, Palestinians in the West Bank and

Gaza are forced to live under military restric
tions that deny them all political rights and sub
ject them to economic discrimination, loss of land
and water rights, censorship and arbitrary
punishment. Israel is listed by Amnesty Interna
tional as one of the countries that practices
torture. Under this "iron fist" regime, Palestin
ian resistance and Israeli retaliation take an in
creasing toll of lives.
The only way to end the cycle of violence is
through negotiations between Israel and the cho
sen representatives of the Palestinian people,
leading to guaranteed, secure borders for Israel
and an independent Palestinian state on the West
Bank and Gaza. Multer says that supporters of
such a solution are either "anti-Semitic or have a
warped sense of equity," but in fact the two
state solution is favored by most of the nations of
the world, former Presidents Ford and Carter,
many distinguished American Jews and leading
members of the Israeli peace movement, as well
as by the majority faction of the Palestine Libera
tion Organization. The Israeli government,
however, refuses to negotiate with any Pales
tinians but those it approves of, and has
repeatedly said it will never give up the territory
it captured in 1967. Israel has turned down
every American peace proposal calling for
recognition of Palestinian national rights.
Those who support Israel's real interests
should urge that these policies be changed, so
that the peace process can go forward and there
can finally be an end to the suffering and
bloodshed both sides have endured.
