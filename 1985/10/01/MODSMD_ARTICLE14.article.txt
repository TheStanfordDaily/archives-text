## America Should Be Praised for Aid 
### 
Nobody remembers a natural disaster in
Mexico worse than the earthquake that rocked
her capital city, the "Very Noble and Loyal City
of Mexico" as it has been known since the 16th
century, on Sept. 19 of 1985. As of today, more
than 4,000 bodies had been found under the
rubble of some of the hundreds of buildings

VIEWPOINT

destroyed by the tremor, but some estimates
put the number of dead well above 10,000. Many
tears will be shed for those who perished under
the ruins, but the city is getting ready to rebuild
its shattered parts. Soon life will resume its nor
mal pace on the ancient Anahuac Valley.
Among the many images on the situation in
Mexico City conveyed by TV, I recall in particu
lar those first silent images which the public TV
network of Mexico sent to the world via satellite,
as a form of letting the rest of the world know
what was happening there. These images were
captured here in the United States by the
Spanish International Network and presented a
town in very serious distress: buildings collapsed
everywhere and people crying in front of them,
desperate to save their children, wives, hus
bands or parents, buried under tons of concrete
brick. Since the remaining usual means of com
munication were destroyed by the quake, only
ham radio operators were able to establish some
contact with the outside world, completing the
picture of a tragedy whose magnitude was all but
evident when the first images hit the TV screens
in America. But the Calvary of those who had
relatives in Mexico was only beginning.
The aftermath of the earthquake has been
very tough for the Mexicans, but it could have
been much worse were it not for the support
received from about 43 friendly countries
around the world. France, Israel, Spain and West
Germany, in particular, responded in a very
generous and efficient way, sending many differ
ent types of help to Mexico City, but the
response of the American people and its govern
ment deserves a special consideration and must

be properly recognized.
Nobody doubts the generosity of the
Americans, and one of the most recent examples
of such generosity is the Africa-USA campaign to
bring relief to the starving people of Northern
Africa. But I do not recall an outburst of
solidarity, concern and support in the recent past
of this country such as the one that the "gringos"
have expressed toward Mexico during the last
few days. Frankly speaking, I never expected
that the Americans would react so swiftly and
sympathetically to a problem south of the border
that does not immediately effect their own lives
or the inner functioning of America. But the way

I do not recall an outburst
of solidarity, concern and
support in the recent past

during the last few days.

in which Americans volunteered as doctors,
technicians, demolition experts, radio operators,
rescue workers or just bare-hand diggers, to al
leviate the suffering of the capitalinos of Mexico
(not to mention the tons of supplies and equip
ment and the millions of dollar donated), con
situtes a magnificent display of solidarity and
cooperation that Mexicans will hardly forget.
Some irresponsible media around the country
have tried to make a case of a supposed
"Mexican pride" which would prevent the
Mexicans from accepting the American help.
There is no such thing. Mexico traditionally has
been able to handle these emergency situations
without having to resort to foreign aid. The ap-

parent reluctance of the goverment to accept
help at the beginning was due to a lack of assess
ment of the damage and the needs, due to the
disruption in the usual communication systems.
The last thing the government wanted was an
airport jammed with unnecessary cargos. In ad
dition, Mexico was not prepared to abuse the
generosity of her friends. But as soon as the
most urgent needs were determined through the
communications system of the Mexican Army, all
required help was of course accepted.
(Nevertheless, despite those precautions, the
Mexican relief organizations are still choking with
supplies sent by different nations.)

The Americans with their actions have shown
to the Mexicans that they are full of good will
toward their neighbors to the south. It seems to
me that the Mexicans have taken due notice of
this fact. Those are the kinds of actions that
eventually will end up carrying the result that the
"distant neighbors" to the South are not so dis
tant after all. In the meantime, to all those who
have given their contribution, in particular to all
those here at Stanford, there is only one thing
we can say: Thank you amigos, Mexico will al
ways welcome you with open arms!

of Mexico" as it has been known since the 16th
century, on Sept. 19 of 1985. As of today, more
than 4,000 bodies had been found under the
rubble of some of the hundreds of buildings

destroyed by the tremor, but some estimates
put the number of dead well above 10,000. Many
tears will be shed for those who perished under
the ruins, but the city is getting ready to rebuild
its shattered parts. Soon life will resume its nor
mal pace on the ancient Anahuac Valley.
Among the many images on the situation in
Mexico City conveyed by TV, I recall in particu
lar those first silent images which the public TV
network of Mexico sent to the world via satellite,
as a form of letting the rest of the world know
what was happening there. These images were
captured here in the United States by the
Spanish International Network and presented a
town in very serious distress: buildings collapsed
everywhere and people crying in front of them,
desperate to save their children, wives, hus
bands or parents, buried under tons of concrete
brick. Since the remaining usual means of com
munication were destroyed by the quake, only
ham radio operators were able to establish some
contact with the outside world, completing the
picture of a tragedy whose magnitude was all but
evident when the first images hit the TV screens
in America. But the Calvary of those who had
relatives in Mexico was only beginning.
The aftermath of the earthquake has been
very tough for the Mexicans, but it could have
been much worse were it not for the support
received from about 43 friendly countries
around the world. France, Israel, Spain and West
Germany, in particular, responded in a very
generous and efficient way, sending many differ
ent types of help to Mexico City, but the
response of the American people and its govern
ment deserves a special consideration and must

be properly recognized.
Nobody doubts the generosity of the
Americans, and one of the most recent examples
of such generosity is the Africa-USA campaign to
bring relief to the starving people of Northern
Africa. But I do not recall an outburst of
solidarity, concern and support in the recent past
of this country such as the one that the "gringos"
have expressed toward Mexico during the last
few days. Frankly speaking, I never expected
that the Americans would react so swiftly and
sympathetically to a problem south of the border
that does not immediately effect their own lives
or the inner functioning of America. But the way

in which Americans volunteered as doctors,
technicians, demolition experts, radio operators,
rescue workers or just bare-hand diggers, to al
leviate the suffering of the capitalinos of Mexico
(not to mention the tons of supplies and equip
ment and the millions of dollar donated), con
situtes a magnificent display of solidarity and
cooperation that Mexicans will hardly forget.
Some irresponsible media around the country
have tried to make a case of a supposed
"Mexican pride" which would prevent the
Mexicans from accepting the American help.
There is no such thing. Mexico traditionally has
been able to handle these emergency situations
without having to resort to foreign aid. The ap-

parent reluctance of the goverment to accept
help at the beginning was due to a lack of assess
ment of the damage and the needs, due to the
disruption in the usual communication systems.
The last thing the government wanted was an
airport jammed with unnecessary cargos. In ad
dition, Mexico was not prepared to abuse the
generosity of her friends. But as soon as the
most urgent needs were determined through the
communications system of the Mexican Army, all
required help was of course accepted.
(Nevertheless, despite those precautions, the
Mexican relief organizations are still choking with
supplies sent by different nations.)

The Americans with their actions have shown
to the Mexicans that they are full of good will
toward their neighbors to the south. It seems to
me that the Mexicans have taken due notice of
this fact. Those are the kinds of actions that
eventually will end up carrying the result that the
"distant neighbors" to the South are not so dis
tant after all. In the meantime, to all those who
have given their contribution, in particular to all
those here at Stanford, there is only one thing
we can say: Thank you amigos, Mexico will al
ways welcome you with open arms!
