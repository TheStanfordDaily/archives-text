Tresidder Not a
Student Union
The custodians at Tresidder
Union can remember when Tresid
der was so popular that students
sat elbow-to-elbow on the patio
walls at noon, because the tables
were too crowded. And they can
remember the days when students
used to fill the upstairs lobby and
hallways, browsing and relaxing.
The hallways of Tresidder are
now almost empty of students.
What has transformed Tresidder
in five years from the most popular
spot on campus to the Tresidder of
today? Why do custodians have to
clean up daily the results of com
munity anger — vandalism —
ranging from broken eggs in the
halls to floods in the restrooms?
Why does Tresidder have to hire
uniformed guards at night and
plain-clothesmen during the day to
guard the "community" union from
the community?
The answer lies in the current
administration of Tresidder, which
has been notoriously unresponsive
to students. Under the guise of
being responsive to a larger com
munity, this management has
changed Tresidder from a student
union into what it calls a
"community" union. Let's look at
what this change has meant in
practice
Let's look at the most recent
decision that Tresidder manage
ment made: the removal of the
student Coffee House from student
control. Tresidder management in
part justified this decision on the
grounds that Tresidder is a com
munity place, not a student place.
First, this was a terrible rip-off of
students who invested years of
hard work building a successful
Coffee House only to have Tresid
der management turn it over to the
Saga Corp. Second, it has been a
terrible rip-off of the community

for whom this was supposedly
done.
Saga has lowered quality, raised
prices, reduced the selection of
beers and ales, cut the hours and
many other things. Space is too
short to write all the horror stories
of the Saga Coffee House. Ad
mittedly, none of them approach
the horror of a customer who
found a worm in her chicken
burger in the Saga cafeteria, or the
customer who was charged $1.95
for half a peach.
Nevertheless, the practical ef
fect of Tresidder management
turning the Coffee House over to
Saga, partly in the name of the
community, is that the community
now has to pay higher prices for
lower quality food. Tresidder man
agement, in fact, brought in Saga
despite the protests of community
members who had seen Saga
drastically raise prices and lower
food quality at Stanford Medical
Center. Tresidder also brought in
Saga despite petitions signed by
2,000 community members and
students, asking that the Coffee
House remain student-run. So
much for the so-called "commun
ity" union!
What they mean by the "com
munity" union is that they are
accountable to no-one, especially
students. The word "community"
union is just another word for
"Tresidder-managment" union.
The question is: how can we
transform Tresidder back into the
lively and popular place it once
was?
First, let's get the Coffee House
back to the students, who earned
the right to run it and know how to
run it.
Second, let's get an administra
tion at Tresidder which is
responsive to students and com
munity alike, and which knows
what the word "union" means.
