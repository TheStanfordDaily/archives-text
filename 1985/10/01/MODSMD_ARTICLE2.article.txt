# Mosher Ruling To Be Unveiled
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
The University has reached a
final decision on whether to
reinstate expelled anthropology
doctoral student Steven Mosher,
according to Stanford spokesman
Bob Beyers of the University News
Service. The verdict, mailed yes
terday, is expected to reach
Mosher and be made public today.
The controversial China scholar
was dismissed by an 11-0 vote of
the Anthropology Department fac
ulty Feb. 24, 1983, for "illegal and
seriously unethical conduct" while
in China in 1979 and 1980 that
"seriously endangered his research
subjects."
He subsequently appealed the
case to Norman Wessells, dean of
the School of Humanities and
Sciences, and Gerald Lieberman,
dean of graduate studies and re
search, but both upheld the deci
sion. Yesterday's final decision was
made by University President
Donald Kennedy.
After reaching a verdict in legal
and disciplinary matters, the Uni
versity follows a strict policy of in
forming individuals involved before
publicly releasing the verdict or
speaking with reporters. Mosher is
expected to announce the Univer

sity's decision today, at which time
University spokesmen may discuss
the case.
Informed yesterday that the Uni
versity's decision was in the mail,
Mosher said, "That's very good
news," adding that he was "neither
optimistic nor pessimistic" but
simply anxious to receive the let
ter.
"I've completed all the course
work . . . and completed my dis
sertation," Mosher said. "I lack
only three signatures (on the dis
sertation). If Kennedy makes a
decision based on the facts, I will
have a Ph.D. in hand."
Saying that he has "exhausted
Stanford's appeals process,"
Mosher added that he will file a suit
against the University if he is not
readmitted.
Mosher entered Stanford's doc
toral program in 1977. In 1979 and
1980, he conducted controversial
field research in China.
The charges against him are said
to include smuggling, bribing
Chinese officials to obtain govern
ment documents and venturing
into territory closed to foreigners.
Mosher has denied these charges.
Mosher has said repeatedly that
the University expelled him be
cause he wrote an article condemn
ing Chinese birth-control policies.
The article, accompanied by
photographs of naked women
awaiting abortions in their eighth
month of pregnancy, was published
in a Taiwanese magazine.
Mosher was dismissed from

Stanford in February 1983, and the
decision was upheld twice, but
Kennedy partially reopened the
case in May 1984, asking both
Mosher and the Chinese authorities
for more information. Kennedy said
he agreed with the original decision
but was seeking additional informa
tion as part of the University's ap
peal process.
In August 1984, China warned
the University that future cultural

and educational exchange programs
between the United States and
China might be endangered if Ken
nedy readmitted Mosher to the doc
toral program. A lawyer for Stan
ford, Iris Brest, said at the time
that the University would not be in
fluenced by the warning, issued by
the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences.
"We plan to pursue our indepen
dent way unswayed," Brest said.
