### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
The University has reached a
final decision on whether to
reinstate expelled anthropology
doctoral student Steven Mosher,
according to Stanford spokesman
Bob Beyers of the University News
Service. The verdict, mailed yes
terday, is expected to reach
Mosher and be made public today.
The controversial China scholar
was dismissed by an 11-0 vote of
the Anthropology Department fac
ulty Feb. 24, 1983, for "illegal and
seriously unethical conduct" while
in China in 1979 and 1980 that
"seriously endangered his research
subjects."
He subsequently appealed the
case to Norman Wessells, dean of
the School of Humanities and
Sciences, and Gerald Lieberman,
dean of graduate studies and re
search, but both upheld the deci
sion. Yesterday's final decision was
made by University President
Donald Kennedy.
After reaching a verdict in legal
and disciplinary matters, the Uni
versity follows a strict policy of in
forming individuals involved before
publicly releasing the verdict or
speaking with reporters. Mosher is
expected to announce the Univer

sity's decision today, at which time
University spokesmen may discuss
the case.
Informed yesterday that the Uni
versity's decision was in the mail,
Mosher said, "That's very good
news," adding that he was "neither
optimistic nor pessimistic" but
simply anxious to receive the let
ter.
"I've completed all the course
work . . . and completed my dis
sertation," Mosher said. "I lack
only three signatures (on the dis
sertation). If Kennedy makes a
decision based on the facts, I will
have a Ph.D. in hand."
Saying that he has "exhausted
Stanford's appeals process,"
Mosher added that he will file a suit
against the University if he is not
readmitted.
Mosher entered Stanford's doc
toral program in 1977. In 1979 and
1980, he conducted controversial
field research in China.
The charges against him are said
to include smuggling, bribing
Chinese officials to obtain govern
ment documents and venturing
into territory closed to foreigners.
Mosher has denied these charges.
Mosher has said repeatedly that
the University expelled him be
cause he wrote an article condemn
