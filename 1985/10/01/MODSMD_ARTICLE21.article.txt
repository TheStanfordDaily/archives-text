### ANDREW McCLUNG 
Ladies and gentlemen of the
Stanford community, distinguished
members, honored guests, squab
bling relatives, I bid you good
morning.
You have thus far been exceed
ingly helpful in both posing and
answering questions, so I thank you
every waking moment, and cor
dially invite you to please continue.
There are this week some inter
esting questions to be sententiously
answered, so, to it, journalism,
pell-mell, for you need answers.
What is the etymological deriva
tion of the word "callipygian"? -
anonymous fresh men
This is the sort of query that
demands attention: why hasn't
someone bought these kids a
decent dictionary?
A quick perusal of Webster's
New 20th Century Dictionary
reveals that "callipygian" comes to
us courtesy of the Greeks; their
words kalos ("beautiful") and pyge
("buttocks") have actually been
fused into this oft-heard adjective
meaning "having shapely buttocks."

I will, with great forbearance,
refrain from putting into print my
speculations as to the motives be
hind this inquiry.
Not that I'm an alcoholic or any
thing (in fact, I rarely drink at all,
and never to excess), but why don't
they sell beers at The Store in Tresid

A brief chat with The Store's

Why hasn't someone
bought these kids a
decent dictionary?

congenial Paul Szczesiul indicated
that the reasons for the dry law are
numerous and well-founded. As you
may have noticed, The Store
already has very crowded shelves.
You may also be aware of the fact
that something over 50 percent of
the Stanford undergraduate popula
tion is less than 21 years of age,
through no fault of their own.
What these concepts mean to

you, the alleged (but equally attrac
tive) non-alcoholic, may not be
much, but to people with vested
economic interests in The Store it
means a great deal.
Namely, they would have to
remove items from their popular
shelves to store liquids that, at
most, 75 percent of the total stu
dent population could legally buy.
Even if they sold only beer and
wine, or even just beer, a
reasonable selection of these
beverages would occupy some con
siderable tracts of shelf space.
Furthermore, the frequently
desired vending of cold beer would
raise another problem: where could
The Store manage to put more
refrigerators?
Sure, if they really wanted to,
they could make the space, but
then they would have to check IDs
all the time. Checkout lines at The
Store tend to be labyrinthine
enough now without the added
delay involved in scrutinizing
spurious IDs.
The threat of facing lengthy lines
is so daunting that all but the most

serious winos would stay away in droves. Besides, clearing
refrigerators and shelves to make room for beer would cut
into sales of the very profitable caffeine-free Diet Cherry
Coke, witch hazel and Bob Ostro's French Onion Dip.
Operating as I do on a tight budget, I contend with occasional
food spoilage by removing the objectionable parts and eating the
decent residues. Some friends of mine have lately recom
mended that I cease this practice, arguing that bread mold and
the like are only superficial manifestations of more pervasive
spoilage. Their reasoning is that consumption of even the most
innocuous-looking remains of partially spoiled foods will in
crease my risk of cancer. What say you to this? - Ned Beach
Well, Ned, let me say that you have a whole realm of study
awaiting you should you desire an answer to this question .
I tried, bud. But apparently there has been little or no ac
tual research done on this topic.
I talked to the gracious and informative Asst. Biology Prof.
Sharon Long, and she said that, for some vegetables, cutting
away the affected parts is fine. Slimy lettuce, for example, is
caused by bacteria, which are single-celled organisms; thus
once they are removed, there is nothing left that you cannot
see.
Bread mold, on the other hand, is different. Being a fungus,
it develops like mushrooms do: just as the "fairy ring", or
circle of mushrooms, one often sees is only the reproductive
organ, or fruit, of the subterranean mushroom, so the visible
part of most bread molds represents only a small part of the
entire organism.
Sad to say, roughly 90 percent of the actual fungus may be
essentially invisible to us humans.
Is this bad? Well, if you eat this invisible fungus, it has to
pass through a lot of hydrochloric acid en route to your in

testines, so it might seem that it should be destroyed by such
treatment. Perhaps it is, but other sorts of foreign organisms
flourish in our gastrointestinal tracts, and are having a won
derful time in there even as you read this.
I also talked to the very knowledgeable and authoritative
Harold McGee, who has recently published a ponderously
large tome called,"On Food and Cooking." Unfortunately,
my understanding of what he told me is that not many scien
tists have channeled their energies toward studying the ef
fects of eating spoiled food.
Oh, I'm sure that botulism, ptomaine and salmonella have
all received their due, but it's harder to find out how much
bread mold you would have to eat to get sick. Or moldy
potatoes or severely bruised fruit or whatever.
Possibly the short-term effects are rather mild, but it must
certainly depend on the type of spoilage and the general state
of health of the consumer.
As for cancer, it is probably very difficult to establish a
clear link between spoiled food consumption and tumor devel
opment, since there are so many substances we ingest these
days that may cause a few cells to go around the bend and
become . . . cancerous.
In sum, I would say that, if the whole lot of bread, cheese
or erstwhile fresh produce you bought seems to be support
ing veritable civilizations of bacteria and fungi, you should
throw it out.
Otherwise, if the growths are minute, cut away the sur
rounding region or throw away a few nearby slices and feast
cost-consciously on the leftovers.
And keep in mind that, by the time you're 60, it will be hard
to tell whether you got cancer from infrequently ingesting a
little mold or from the 800 cans of saccharin-saturated soda
you drank every day for 10 years.
Which freezes faster: hot water or cold water, and why? -
Freezy in 558
The answer one gets to this question depends on whom

one asks. Some physicists point out, in exasperated tones,
that hot water must cool down to the temperature of cold
water before it freezes, by which time a comparable portion
of cold water will itself have more closely approached a crys
talline state.
Hopeless imbeciles like myself are at this point likely to
mention that this reasoning sounds a lot like Zeno's paradox:
if Achilles is racing a tortoise, but the tortoise is given a
headstart from point B while Achilles starts some distance be
hind at A, then no matter how fast Achilles runs, by the time
he reaches B the tortoise will have advanced to C. As Achilles
breathlessly reaches C, the tortoise has already sped on to D,
and so on, with the obvious conclusion that Achilles could
never outrun a tortoise.
This sort of reasoning serves mainly to confuse a lot of
people and make them feel like idiots because they are in
timidated into accepting the implication that Achilles' speed is
in some way dependent on the tortoise's.
Likewise, there is no reason to assume that hot water is
identical to cold water.
In fact, a thermodynamicist of no lesser stature than the
authoritative Prof. Bob Eustis of the Mechanical Engineeering
Department mentioned that, if a sample of cold water is
heated, the vapor pressure of the air dissolved in the water
will increase.
Thus, the air will be driven out by the heat, and the heat
capacity of the sample of water will change. Clearly, we are
now talking about real-world water, and not the ideallv pure
sort.
If the heat capacity changes, the amount of heat that is
drawn out of the water by a given temperature change also
changes correspondingly. So it is actually conceivable that the
rate of freezing would be altered by the heating process.
Nonetheless, I would counsel you to put cold water in the
freezer if you wish to obtain ice with all possible haste. There
will be less heat to draw out of the water that way, and you
will tax your refrigerator less.
Ladies and gentlemen of the
Stanford community, distinguished
members, honored guests, squab

timidated into accepting the implication that Achilles' speed is
in some way dependent on the tortoise's.
Likewise, there is no reason to assume that hot water is
identical to cold water.
In fact, a thermodynamicist of no lesser stature than the
authoritative Prof. Bob Eustis of the Mechanical Engineeering
Department mentioned that, if a sample of cold water is
heated, the vapor pressure of the air dissolved in the water
will increase.
Thus, the air will be driven out by the heat, and the heat
capacity of the sample of water will change. Clearly, we are
now talking about real-world water, and not the ideallv pure
sort.
If the heat capacity changes, the amount of heat that is
drawn out of the water by a given temperature change also
changes correspondingly. So it is actually conceivable that the
rate of freezing would be altered by the heating process.
Nonetheless, I would counsel you to put cold water in the
freezer if you wish to obtain ice with all possible haste. There
will be less heat to draw out of the water that way, and you
will tax your refrigerator less.
Ladies and gentlemen of the

What is the etymological deriva
tion of the word "callipygian"? -
anonymous fresh men
This is the sort of query that
demands attention: why hasn't
someone bought these kids a
decent dictionary?
A quick perusal of Webster's
New 20th Century Dictionary
reveals that "callipygian" comes to
us courtesy of the Greeks; their
words kalos ("beautiful") and pyge
("buttocks") have actually been
fused into this oft-heard adjective
meaning "having shapely buttocks."

I will, with great forbearance,
refrain from putting into print my
speculations as to the motives be
hind this inquiry.

A brief chat with The Store's

Why hasn't someone
bought these kids a
decent dictionary?

congenial Paul Szczesiul indicated
that the reasons for the dry law are
numerous and well-founded. As you
may have noticed, The Store
already has very crowded shelves.
You may also be aware of the fact
that something over 50 percent of
the Stanford undergraduate popula
tion is less than 21 years of age,
through no fault of their own.
What these concepts mean to

you, the alleged (but equally attrac
tive) non-alcoholic, may not be
much, but to people with vested
economic interests in The Store it
means a great deal.
Namely, they would have to
remove items from their popular
shelves to store liquids that, at
most, 75 percent of the total stu
dent population could legally buy.
Even if they sold only beer and
wine, or even just beer, a
reasonable selection of these
beverages would occupy some con
siderable tracts of shelf space.
Furthermore, the frequently
desired vending of cold beer would
raise another problem: where could
The Store manage to put more
refrigerators?
Sure, if they really wanted to,
they could make the space, but
then they would have to check IDs
all the time. Checkout lines at The
Store tend to be labyrinthine
enough now without the added
delay involved in scrutinizing
spurious IDs.
The threat of facing lengthy lines
is so daunting that all but the most

serious winos would stay away in droves. Besides, clearing
refrigerators and shelves to make room for beer would cut
into sales of the very profitable caffeine-free Diet Cherry
Coke, witch hazel and Bob Ostro's French Onion Dip.
Operating as I do on a tight budget, I contend with occasional
food spoilage by removing the objectionable parts and eating the
decent residues. Some friends of mine have lately recom
mended that I cease this practice, arguing that bread mold and
the like are only superficial manifestations of more pervasive
spoilage. Their reasoning is that consumption of even the most
innocuous-looking remains of partially spoiled foods will in
crease my risk of cancer. What say you to this? - Ned Beach
Well, Ned, let me say that you have a whole realm of study
awaiting you should you desire an answer to this question .
I tried, bud. But apparently there has been little or no ac
tual research done on this topic.
I talked to the gracious and informative Asst. Biology Prof.
Sharon Long, and she said that, for some vegetables, cutting
away the affected parts is fine. Slimy lettuce, for example, is
caused by bacteria, which are single-celled organisms; thus
once they are removed, there is nothing left that you cannot
see.
Bread mold, on the other hand, is different. Being a fungus,
it develops like mushrooms do: just as the "fairy ring", or
circle of mushrooms, one often sees is only the reproductive
organ, or fruit, of the subterranean mushroom, so the visible
part of most bread molds represents only a small part of the
entire organism.
Sad to say, roughly 90 percent of the actual fungus may be
essentially invisible to us humans.
Is this bad? Well, if you eat this invisible fungus, it has to
pass through a lot of hydrochloric acid en route to your in

testines, so it might seem that it should be destroyed by such
treatment. Perhaps it is, but other sorts of foreign organisms
flourish in our gastrointestinal tracts, and are having a won
derful time in there even as you read this.
I also talked to the very knowledgeable and authoritative
Harold McGee, who has recently published a ponderously
large tome called,"On Food and Cooking." Unfortunately,
my understanding of what he told me is that not many scien
tists have channeled their energies toward studying the ef
fects of eating spoiled food.
Oh, I'm sure that botulism, ptomaine and salmonella have
all received their due, but it's harder to find out how much
bread mold you would have to eat to get sick. Or moldy
potatoes or severely bruised fruit or whatever.
Possibly the short-term effects are rather mild, but it must
certainly depend on the type of spoilage and the general state
of health of the consumer.
As for cancer, it is probably very difficult to establish a
clear link between spoiled food consumption and tumor devel
opment, since there are so many substances we ingest these
days that may cause a few cells to go around the bend and
become . . . cancerous.
In sum, I would say that, if the whole lot of bread, cheese
or erstwhile fresh produce you bought seems to be support
ing veritable civilizations of bacteria and fungi, you should
throw it out.
Otherwise, if the growths are minute, cut away the sur
rounding region or throw away a few nearby slices and feast
cost-consciously on the leftovers.
And keep in mind that, by the time you're 60, it will be hard
to tell whether you got cancer from infrequently ingesting a
little mold or from the 800 cans of saccharin-saturated soda
you drank every day for 10 years.
Which freezes faster: hot water or cold water, and why? -
Freezy in 558
The answer one gets to this question depends on whom

one asks. Some physicists point out, in exasperated tones,
that hot water must cool down to the temperature of cold
water before it freezes, by which time a comparable portion
of cold water will itself have more closely approached a crys
talline state.
Hopeless imbeciles like myself are at this point likely to
mention that this reasoning sounds a lot like Zeno's paradox:
if Achilles is racing a tortoise, but the tortoise is given a
headstart from point B while Achilles starts some distance be
hind at A, then no matter how fast Achilles runs, by the time
he reaches B the tortoise will have advanced to C. As Achilles
breathlessly reaches C, the tortoise has already sped on to D,
and so on, with the obvious conclusion that Achilles could
never outrun a tortoise.
This sort of reasoning serves mainly to confuse a lot of
people and make them feel like idiots because they are in
timidated into accepting the implication that Achilles' speed is
in some way dependent on the tortoise's.
Likewise, there is no reason to assume that hot water is
identical to cold water.

Which freezes faster: hot water or cold water, and why? -
Freezy in 558
The answer one gets to this question depends on whom

one asks. Some physicists point out, in exasperated tones,
that hot water must cool down to the temperature of cold
water before it freezes, by which time a comparable portion
of cold water will itself have more closely approached a crys
talline state.
Hopeless imbeciles like myself are at this point likely to
mention that this reasoning sounds a lot like Zeno's paradox:
if Achilles is racing a tortoise, but the tortoise is given a
headstart from point B while Achilles starts some distance be
hind at A, then no matter how fast Achilles runs, by the time
he reaches B the tortoise will have advanced to C. As Achilles
breathlessly reaches C, the tortoise has already sped on to D,
and so on, with the obvious conclusion that Achilles could
never outrun a tortoise.
This sort of reasoning serves mainly to confuse a lot of
people and make them feel like idiots because they are in
timidated into accepting the implication that Achilles' speed is
in some way dependent on the tortoise's.
Likewise, there is no reason to assume that hot water is
identical to cold water.
In fact, a thermodynamicist of no lesser stature than the
authoritative Prof. Bob Eustis of the Mechanical Engineeering
Department mentioned that, if a sample of cold water is
heated, the vapor pressure of the air dissolved in the water
will increase.
Thus, the air will be driven out by the heat, and the heat
capacity of the sample of water will change. Clearly, we are
now talking about real-world water, and not the ideallv pure
sort.
If the heat capacity changes, the amount of heat that is
drawn out of the water by a given temperature change also
changes correspondingly. So it is actually conceivable that the
rate of freezing would be altered by the heating process.
Nonetheless, I would counsel you to put cold water in the
freezer if you wish to obtain ice with all possible haste. There
will be less heat to draw out of the water that way, and you
will tax your refrigerator less.
