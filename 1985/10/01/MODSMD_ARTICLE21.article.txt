Ladies and gentlemen of the
Stanford community, distinguished
members, honored guests, squab
bling relatives, I bid you good
morning.
You have thus far been exceed
ingly helpful in both posing and
answering questions, so I thank you
every waking moment, and cor
dially invite you to please continue.
There are this week some inter
esting questions to be sententiously
answered, so, to it, journalism,
pell-mell, for you need answers.
What is the etymological deriva
tion of the word "callipygian"? -
anonymous fresh men
This is the sort of query that
demands attention: why hasn't
someone bought these kids a
decent dictionary?
A quick perusal of Webster's
New 20th Century Dictionary
reveals that "callipygian" comes to
us courtesy of the Greeks; their
words kalos ("beautiful") and pyge
("buttocks") have actually been
fused into this oft-heard adjective
meaning "having shapely buttocks."

I will, with great forbearance,
refrain from putting into print my
speculations as to the motives be
hind this inquiry.
Not that I'm an alcoholic or any
thing (in fact, I rarely drink at all,
and never to excess), but why don't

A brief chat with The Store's

Why hasn't someone
bought these kids a
decent dictionary?

congenial Paul Szczesiul indicated
that the reasons for the dry law are
numerous and well-founded. As you
may have noticed, The Store
already has very crowded shelves.
You may also be aware of the fact
that something over 50 percent of
the Stanford undergraduate popula
tion is less than 21 years of age,
through no fault of their own.
What these concepts mean to

you, the alleged (but equally attrac
tive) non-alcoholic, may not be
much, but to people with vested
economic interests in The Store it
means a great deal.
Namely, they would have to
remove items from their popular
shelves to store liquids that, at
most, 75 percent of the total stu
dent population could legally buy.
Even if they sold only beer and
wine, or even just beer, a
reasonable selection of these
beverages would occupy some con
siderable tracts of shelf space.
Furthermore, the frequently
desired vending of cold beer would
raise another problem: where could
The Store manage to put more
refrigerators?
Sure, if they really wanted to,
they could make the space, but
then they would have to check IDs
all the time. Checkout lines at The
Store tend to be labyrinthine
enough now without the added
delay involved in scrutinizing
spurious IDs.
The threat of facing lengthy lines
is so daunting that all but the most
