"A personal objective is get
ting people to think in terms of a
whole (Greek) system, rather
than just associating themselves
with the fraternity or sorority
they belong to," explained Joe
Pisano, who recently assumed
the newly created position of
fraternal affairs adviser.
Prior to assuming his respon
sibilities at Stanford June 1,
Pisano was the fraternal affairs
coordinator at Washington Uni
versity in St. Louis for two
years. "It's a new position at
Stanford," Pisano said.
In response to controversy in
the University community, last
year's Task Force on Fraterni
ties and Sororities put forward a
decision to hire an adviser to
work with the fraternity system
here.
"They (the Task Force) saw
more potential for fraternities
and sororities than was being
realized," Pisano said. The Task
Force, headed by Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons and

Diana Conklin, assistant dean of
Student Affairs for Residential
Education, consisted of stu
dents, administrators and
alumni.
Pisano was president of his
chapter of Theta Delta Chi at the
University of Rochester and now
serves as national president of


Joe Pisano
Fraternal Affairs Adviser
the fraternal organization. He
graduated in 1982 with a bachelor's
degree in English, cum laude.
Pisano values fraternities as a
place to "establish a climate for
friendships, provide moral and per
sonal support and create better
people."
"My duties will be to be a liaison
between the fraternity organiza
tions and the administration,"
Pisano explained.
Pisano will work closely with Don
Galles, president of the Interfrater
nity Council (IFC), and Ivy Li, pres
ident of the Intersorority Council
(ISC).
The past week has offered
Pisano a challenge to start the new
academic year, as Norm Robinson,
assistant dean of Student Affairs for
Residential Education, addressed a
letter to Galles, requesting an IFC
investigation on six possible viola
tions of University policies.
A report on the investigations is
due Friday.
Galles said he hopes Pisano will
help to create a situation in which
"the University is proud of fraterni
ties, and fraternities don't feel that
the University is a hassle to them."
