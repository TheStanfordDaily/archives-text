## 'Ladies' Use Sharp Wit To Rap Liberal Values 
### NANCY HENRY Editorial staff 
Social activism is alive in Palo
Alto, and so is social satire if the
crowd that packed into the New
Varsity Theatre on Friday night is
any indication. The attraction was a
session of "consciousness
lowering" sponsored by the national
campaign known as "Ladies Against
Women," or LAW.
The intention of LAW, created by
a five-member theater group of
Berkeley origin called the
Plutonium Players, is to put women
back in their place. They believe
and proclaim that "suffering, not
suffrage, keeps us on our pedes
tals," and that "ladies should be
ladies, and no one should be women
â€” especially men." Their strategy
for overcoming the enemy (any
female who considers herself to be
progressive, independent or a
woman and any man who is a
"wimp") includes a program of
guest speakers such as Phyllis le
Shaft and the Reverend Jerry Fall
out, audience participation exer
cise classes to practice acts of sub
mission and cheerleading sessions
which have willing participants
shouting: "B.R.A. notE.R.A."
All this occurs under the leader
ship of three core characters:
Candy Cotton Gain Angeles), Mrs.
T. Bill Banks (Selma Vincent) and
Mrs. Chester Cholesterol (Gail Ann
Williams), who makes Twinkies
from scratch. Between them, they

speak to women of all ages who are
or have ever encountered these
stereotypical, but all too real
"ladies."
The show provoked both
hesitant chuckles and great bursts
of laughter from the full house of
men and women by stomping un
ashamedly on sacred ground. For
example, LAW seeks to restore vir
ginity as a requirement for high
school graduation. It champions the
rights of the unconceived
("masturbation and menstruation
amount to mass murder"). These
staunch supporters of President
Reagan would eliminate the envi
ronment. They also boast support
from "Americans Against Civil
Liberties and Unions," and
"Mutants for a Radioactive Environ
ment. "
In essence, the Plutonium
Players have heaped together all
the most topical social and political
issues and taken the most extreme
conservative stance on all of them.
The result is a quite powerful and
humorous, if uneven, performance
of comic satire.
When they are "on," as in the
opening half hour of the show, the
Players have the ability to deliver
blow after blow in a series of caustic
one-liners. Unfortunately, the initial
comic level was never really
repeated. Some of the skits, most
notably (and perhaps significantly)
those performed by the men, fell
flat. Likewise, by the end of the
show, the cliched characters had
lost their novelty and were becom

ing annoying.
These problems are primarily
due to the script and are far from in
surmountable. What is most unique
and successful about the group is its
commitment and approach to its
campaign off the stage. The Players
first made a name for themselves
by holding a bake sale for the deficit
outside of a Reagan prayer break
fast. Since then, they have staged
demonstrations and protests for
conservative causes, their very
presence making a mockery of the
conservative position.
They even conduct interviews in
character. After the show, while
selling buttons with messages like
"Support Nancy's China policy,"
"Close your eyes and do your
duty," and "I'd rather be ironing,"
group member Jain Angeles told me
that the group was going up to
Toronto, where there are a lot of
those "flatfooted, barefaced, pro
gressive types." "They need our
help," she assured me.
When asked about the Plutonium
Players' general philosophy she
replied, "We are a Right to Life or
ganization. We believe in our partic
ular style of life for everyone." She
further echoed conservative senti
ments by claiming, "LAW doesn't
believe it's right to kill anyone until
after they're born."
In a time when such statements
are made on the political stage of
the United States, Ladies Against
Women offers a particularly rele
vant message, in the rare form of
well-written social satire.


Mrs. Banks (Selma Vincent) and Mrs. Cholesterol (Gail Ann Williams) protest and pray in "Ladies
Against Women."
