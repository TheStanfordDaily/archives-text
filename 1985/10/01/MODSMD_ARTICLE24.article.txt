# Blomstedt Orchestrates New Season
## 
### EUGENE BUCK 
San Francisco, "The City That
Knows How," proved it last year
when it managed to bring Herbert
Blomstedt (pronounced "Bloom
stedt") to replace outgoing Edo de
Waart as music director of the San
Francisco Symphony. Though
Blomstedt officially became the
10th music director on Sept. 1, he
will make his first appearance as
music director this week when he
leads the San Francisco Symphony
in Wagner's Prelude to
"Meistersinger," Sessions' Sym
phony No. 2, and Strauss' "Ein Hel
denleben."
Blomstedt made his San
Francisco debut in February 1984
to rave reviews. In his first week,
he conducted Schubert's Symphony
No. 8, the "Unfinished," Berg's
Violin Concerto (with Gidon
Kremer), and Beethoven's Sym
phony No. 5. The following week,

he led the orchestra in Weber's
"Ruler's of the Spirits" Overture,
Saint-Saens' Piano Concerto No. 2
and Brahms' Symphony No. 1. His
success in those two weeks led to
his appointment less than two
months later.
This past summer, Blomstedt led
the S.F. Symphony in its seventh
annual Beethoven Festival, con
ducting all nine Beethoven sym
phonies. It was during these
concerts that San Francisco really
had a chance to listen to its new
music director. The new maestro
was greeted with sold out houses
and standing ovations.
Although not well known among
American audiences, his reputation
in Europe is firmly established.
Blomstedt comes to San Francisco
from the celebrated Dresden
Staatskapelle, the oldest orchestra
in the world. He made his debut as
a guest conductor with that or
chestra in 1969 and, at the request
of the players, was appointed music

director of the Staatskapelle in
1975. As music director of the San
Francisco Symphony, Blomstedt
will continue his association with
the Dresden Staatskapelle, though
in reduced capacity.
From 1950 to 1955, Blomstedt
studied conducting with Igor
Markevitch, and in 1953 he
returned to the United States,
where he studied conducting at the
Juilliard School of Music Qean
Morel), the Berkshire Music Center
in Tanglewood (Leonard Bernstein)
and the New England Conservatory
of Music in Boston.
Blomstedt's conducting debut
came in 1954 with the Stockholm
Philharmonic Orchestra. He served
as music director of Sweden's Nor
rkoping Symphony Orchestra
(1954-1961) and Copenhagen's
Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra
(1962-1977). He has also served as
the principal conductor of Norway's
Oslo Philharmonic (1962-1968).
While serving at the Staatskapelle,

Blomstedt also served as music
director of the Swedish Radio Sym
phony Orchestra (1977-82).
Blomstedt may be the catalyst
that San Francisco needs to boost it
into world recognition. He stresses
the importance of touring an or
chestra in order to meet new
audiences and to compete with
other orchestras. He has led the
Staatskapelle on concert tours
throughout Europe, Asia and the
United States; and in March 1986,
Blomstedt will lead the San Fran
cisco Symphony on an East Coast
tour which will take the orchestra
to seven cities in two weeks, in
cluding Carnegie Hall in New York
City and Orchestra Hall in Chicago.
Season tickets for Blomstedt's
inaugural season are sold out;
however, Stanford students can
still obtain discount season tickets
through the San Francisco Sym
phony Student Forum. Tickets are
priced at more than half off the reg
