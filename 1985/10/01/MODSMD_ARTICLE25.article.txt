# Two Cultures Collide in Wang's 'Dim Sum'
## 
### GEOFFREY MINTER 
Wayne Wang's "Dim Sum"
chronicles the battle between
Chinese and American values,
questioning which should ultimately
be followed by a Chinese family
living in America.
Mrs. Tam (Kim Chew), a 62-
year-old widowed immigrant from
China who now lives in San Fran
cisco, thinks she's going to die
thanks to a fortune teller's predici
tion. Geraldine Tam (Laureen
Chew, Kim Chew's daughter on
lilm and in real life) still lives at
home to take care of Mrs. Tam be
cause she believes her mother
shouldn't be left alone in the year
she expects to die; she does, as
one neighbor tells her, what any
good Chinese daughter should do.
Mrs. Tam, however, doesn't
want Geraldine to live with her any
longer because she holds the Amer
ican belief that a parent should see
her children married off before she
dies.
The film begins with a long take
of the old sewing machine Mrs.
Tam uses to mend and, perhaps,
make her clothes (and Mrs. Tam
and the machine are associated with
one another throughout the
remainder of the film). Over the
soundtrack, we hear the voices of
young children playing in the street;
the co-existence between old and
young, ancient and new, is estab
lished in this first shot and contin

ues to appear and grow in the film
until, by the end, the co-existence
has turned into a full-fledged con
flict.
Terrel Selter's screenplay ex
amines the conflict in terms of char
acter. Mrs. Tam immigrated from
China 40 years ago and still holds on
to many of her old country's tradi
tions. She speaks her native Can
tonese during most of the picture
(even when people are talking back
to her in English), plays Mah Jong (a
Chinese game with tiles) and cooks
Chinese food all the time.
On the other hand, Mrs. Tam has
also been very Americanized. She
has long since moved out of
Chinatown into a more subur
banized colonial home near Golden
Gate Park, wants her daughter to
get married and wants to become
an American citizen before return
ing to China for one last time before
she dies.
Geraldine has been raised as an
American for all her life, now at
tends college as a graduate student,
reads Vogue to keep up on all the
latest American fashions and is
asked by her Uncle Tam (Victor
Wong) to replace all the old records
in his bar's jukebox with the latest
hits. She has chosen to remain at
home, however, like a good
Chinese daughter, even though her
decision to do so hasn't pleased her
boyfriend, who wants to live with
her.
Both Geraldine and her mother
are torn between the the American

and Chinese sides of themselves,
and neither of them is entirely
happy with the decisions they
choose to make. Geraldine eventu
ally wants to get married and wants
to move out on her own, but her
Chinese-daughter obligation wins
out. Similarly, Mrs. Tam doesn't
want to alone when she dies, but
wants, like an American, to see her
daughter get married.
The title "Dim Sum" translates
into "a little bit of heart," but dim
sum itself is a term describing a
certain type of Chinese food, and
Chinese food is an important
tradition-idenitfying motif in the
film.
The major conflicts between
people happen at the dinner table
(while eating, Mrs. Tam finally tells
Geraldine that she'll have to move
out and get married, for example).
And outside of her sewing machine,
the most traditional Chinese link
Mrs. Tam has is her Chinese
cooking. Uncle Tam laments that
his sister-in-law's death will mean
an end to "pork in shrimp sauce"
and other Chinese delectables since
Geraldine hasn't learned how to
cook like her mother. (In one telling
scene, Uncle Tam and Geraldine at
tempt to cook a traditional Chinese
dinner, fail, and end up eating at
McDonald's.) The final reconcilia
tion between Geraldine and her
mother, in fact, partially depends
on whether Geraldine can learn to
cook like her mother.
Director Wang also expresses

the film's Chinese/American conflict
through montage; much of the film
is cut so that the previous scene
comments on the next scene, and
vice-versa.
One scene with Mrs. Tam and
friends playing Mah Jong, for exam
ple, is cut to a scene with Mrs.
Tarn's granddaughter playing a tele
vision video game. Most of the
cross-cutting is also used to build a
sense of loneliness in the film, a
feeling which is accentuated by the
quiet soundtrack.
People talk very little in the film;
when they're silent, the sounds of
the environment — the playing
children in the first scene with Mrs.
Tam and her sewing machine, or
the crashing waves in the scene
with Uncle Tam and Geraldine
staring at the seashore — over
whelm the characters and make
them look helpless.
In the most emotionally devastat
ing scene in the film, Mrs. Tam is at
home alone and combs her hair
while staring blank-faced at the
television in front of her. The show
she's watching is some comedy
with a very loud laugh track, and
the track is turned up so loud that it
seems to be mocking the lonely
woman in front of the set.
Wang moves his camera very
little in the film, and only does so
when he wishes to reveal some
emotional truth by zooming in on an
actor's face, like he does in the tele
vision scene.

Laureen and Kim Chew make a
great mother/daughter acting team,
but the film clearly belongs to the
elder Chew. Making her film debut
in "Dim Sum," Kim Chew moves
the muscles on her face very little,
but every tiny gesture she does
make conveys exactly what she's
thinking and feeling. Her face is al
ways a mixture of happy and sad;
she smiles, but her cheeks sag and
her eyes look distant. Chew
performs Mrs. Tam better than any
professional actor would have had
the talent to. She looks like she's
lived the part already, and perhaps

she has.
"Dim Sum" is a quiet, low budget
film made with a lot more intelli
gence than the average $10 million
Hollywood fare. It packs quite an
emotional wollap at the end. and, in
the year of "Year of the Dragon", it
should be considered a landmark
film for its depiction of Chinese
Americans (as might Wang's last
movie, "Chan is Missing"). Beyond
this, "Dim Sum" is about the ques
tion any American family with an
ethnic background may eventually
have to answer: how much as
similation is good?


Uncle Tam (Victor Wong) and Geraldine (Lawreen Chew) try to
maintain Chinese values in an Americanized society in "Dim
Sum."
