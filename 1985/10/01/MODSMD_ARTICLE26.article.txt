## Cards Wary of Bronco Kickers 
### ERIK STEN 
Needing a win to boost morale, Stanford's women's
soccer team will travel to the University of Santa Clara
for a 5 p. m. game today.
The Santa Clara Broncos are ranked seventh on the
West Coast and sport an impressive 7-2-2 record. But
as Cardinal Coach Helen Keohane said, "They've
played inconsistently like we have and it should be a
pretty even match."
Consistency seems to be what Stanford is after.
"After a couple of losses, we need to stablize and get a
couple of wins in a row," Keohane said. "The game
isn't a big match ranking-wise, but psychologically it
would definitely help us to win."
To get that win, the Cardinal must shut down a pair
of impressive Bronco scorers: Jenny Fechner and
Jenny Symons. In order to accomplish that, Keohane
said she will use senior midfielder Cheryl Gustafson to

mark Fechner when she is playing midfield. If Fechner
plays forward, however, junior fullback Anne Youmans
will key on her.
If that strategy works on Fechner, Keohane hopes
to neutralize the other Jenny, Symons, with strong
team defense and agressive play. The reasoning being
that if the defense concentrates too heavily on the
Broncos' stars, it could be left open to attack from
Santa Clara's other players.
Offensively, the Cardinal would like nothing better
than to exploit a Bronco defense which, Keohane said,
"could be a little unorganized." The key to reviving the
Cardinal offense, which hasn't scored in the last two
games is "stronger midfield play and more good
agressive scoring opportunities," Keohane said.
In summing up the contest, Keohane shied away
from any predictions. "Last year it was a pretty even
match, and it should be similar this year. Hopefully we
can stabilize and start a winning mindset," she said.
