# Doi's Defense Doesn't Break
## 
### BRENDAN HEALEY 
Suzanne Doi once played two
minutes in a field hockey game
with a broken kneecap. That's
tough.
"It was the San Jose game,"
said Doi, a senior defender
for the Stanford field hockey
team. "On a long corner one of
their girls hit the ball, and it was
lifted and it hit me in the left
kneecap.
"I went down, but then I got
back up. I had trouble running. I
didn't have good motion, but I
thought 'maybe it's just tightened
up.' They took me out a few
minutes after it happened."
X-rays later showed that Doi
had fractured her patella. Her
junior season was effectively
ended, although she tried to come
back for the last few games.
"Her rehabilitation time was
quite short for a knee injury,"
Head Coach Sheryl Johnson said.
"In fact, she was ready to play in
the last week of the season, but
we didn't think it was a good idea.
It was a pretty serious injury. We
didn't want her to get reinjured."
Tnis year Doi is not only back
on the field, but she also has a
host of new responsibilities. Doi
was selected as a co-captain along
with fellow senior Karen Cham
berlain.
"As a captain, I feel like I should
be able to inspire the team and
make them feel like we can win."
Doi said.
"She's the quarterback of our
defense," junior teammate Andi
Wolpert said of Doi."She's
definitely more of a leader by ex
ample."
Doi leads both the defensive
charges and retreats.
"She starts the attack,"
Johnson said. "The ball starts with
her when we work it out to the at
tacking end. (But) if somebody
gets beat, they have to rearrange
the defense, and she's in charge of
that."
As a captain Doi has several off
the-field responsibilities in addi
tion to those on the field.
"What she's been doing lately is
heading the fundraising program,"
Johnson said. "We have to raise
our own funds to be able to
travel."
According to Doi, field hockey

is a varsity-two sport, which
means that it is not fully funded by
the University.
The team is also hoping to
make a spring trip to Scotland.
"She and Karen Chamberlain
are both working on fundraising to
make that goal (spring trip) a
reality while they're both here as
seniors," Johnson said. "She and
Karen keep the team together a
lot. It's kind of neat, because
there's a good team unity there."
"She even does more ... off
the field than on the field," Wol
pert said. "She's pretty much our
team mom."

Doi's play is characterized by
her calm consistency in the heat of
the battle.
"I'm usually pretty calm," Doi
said. "I have a lot of confidence in
my teammates. That makes my
job a little easier, because then I
can feel confident in what I'm
doing."
"She's actually a very quiet per
son," Johnson said of her senior
leader. "When she organizes the
defense, she's very calm and has a
quiet voice. But everyone on the
field knows her voice, so they all
listen for that one voice. She's

become so consistent, you just
know she's going to be there."
"She's an incredibly consistent
player," Wolpert said.
Consistent is not another word
for mediocre, though.
"She has excellent anticipa
tion," Johnson said of Doi, a four
year starter. "She has a great abil
ity for reading the play. She inter
cepts a lot."
Doi hasn't always been on the
defensive side of the field. When
she first took up the sport as a
sophomore at Fallbrook Union
High School, she played offense.

She even added a year on offense
for the Cardinal before switching
to the other side of the midfield
stripe as a Stanford sophomore.
Doi welcomed the change.
"I like defense a lot better than
offense," she said.
What does the future hold for
Doi?
Being on one of the twelve
teams in the field for the NCAA
Field Hockey Tournament, which
the Cardinal narrowly missed last
year, is the immediate goal of Doi
and her teammates.


Despite suffering from a broken kneecap last year, defender
Suzanne Doi is back to lead the Card defense and the team.
The senior psychology major, who is interested in pursuing a

Nissimov/Daily file
teaching credential, was elected her team's co-captain this
year. Doi is also in charge of raising the funds for a possible
trip by the field hockey team to England in the spring.
