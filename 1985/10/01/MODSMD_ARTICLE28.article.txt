# AL West Tied Up Royally
## 
### 
KANSAS CITY (AP) â€” Striking
out Reggie Jackson to end the game
might be enough reason to
celebrate, but 21-year-old Bret
Saberhagen was popping the cham
pagne for another reason, too.
He had just won his 20th game in
his second full season in the major
leagues and pulled the Kansas City
Royals into a tie with the California
Angels for the lead in the American
League West.
"I was real nervous to start the
game," Saberhagen said, "but they
told me, 'Don't worry. You've got
to win this game, but don't
worry.' "
Saberhagen pitched a five-hitter,
going 20-6, and struck out 10 to
beat the Angels 3-1 last night. Jim
Sundberg homered with one out in
the seventh inning to break a 1-1 tie
as Saberhagen outdueled left
hander John Candelaria to join Ron
Guidry as the only 20-game win
ners in the AL this season. Guidry
is 21-6.
The victory, in the first of a four
game series with the Angels, halted
a three-game Kansas City losing
streak as the Royals returned home
to 34,200 highly partisan fans.
With two out in the ninth inning,
Saberhagen walked Doug DeCinces
on five pitches, bringing Jackson to
the plate as the tying run. Jackson,
with a club-leading 26 home runs,
had sent one to the warning track
two innings earlier.
"Somebody asked me why I
walked DeCinces on purpose to
pitch to Jackson," Saberhagen said.
"Heck, that was the farthest thing
from my mind."
But Jackson looked at three
straight pitches on the outside cor
ner, striking out for the first time in
the game as the crowd stood cheer
ing.
Saberhagen is the youngest
Kansas City pitcher ever to win 20
games.
Candelaria, 6-3 for the Angels
since being acquired from Pitts
burgh Aug. 2, was pulled from the
game after giving up Kansas City's
final run in the eighth on a triple by
Willie Wilson and a sacrifice fly by
George Brett.
