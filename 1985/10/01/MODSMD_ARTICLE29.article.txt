## lowa Hawkeyes Soar to the Top 
### 
From the Associated Press
The University of lowa, which once set an
NCAA record of 19 consecutive non-winning
seasons from 1962-80, is ranked No. 1 in the As
sociated Press college football poll for the first
time since 1961.
The Hawkeyes walloped lowa State 57-3 Sat
urday and vaulted from third place to the top in
yesterday's weekly AP pol following No.l
ranked Auburn's 38-20 loss to Tennessee and
runner-up Oklahoma's 13-7 squeaker over Min
nesota.
lowa, 3-0, received 35 of 59 first-place votes
and 1,111 of a possible 1,180 points from a
nationwide panel of sports writers and
sportscasters. Oklahoma, which played its first
game of the season last weekend, received 13
first-place votes and 1,046 points.
Meanwhile, Auburn plummeted from first
place to 14th while Tennessee, Georgia, Baylor
and Texas made the Top 20 for the first time this
season. Dropping out were UCLA, Maryland,
Southern California and Virginia.

Behind lowa and Oklahoma in the Top 10 are
Southern Methodist, Florida State, Ohio State,
Oklahoma State, Michigan, LSU, Penn State and
Arkansas.
The jump to the top for lowa capped a rise
from virtual obscurity in Hayden Fry's seven
years as head coach. The Hawkeyes were fourth
in the 1985 preseason poll and third, fourth or
fifth in each regular-season poll. They have
defeated Drake 58-0 and Northern Illinois 58-20
before crushing lowa State.
Ironically, Fry had pleaded following the lowa
State game: "Don't put us No.l. That might be
the kiss of death for us."
When advised of lowa's new ranking yester
day, he chuckled and said:
"That's a little bit unbelievable at the Univer
sity of lowa. When we came here seven years
ago we were in the worst 10."
Then, he added: "Seriously, I think it's super
great. I really don't put a lot of value in early
season rankings, but I'd like to see us there at
the end of the season. We're honored to be No. 1

and we'll try our best to stay there."
lowa plays Michigan State at home this Satur
day.
lowa was No.l six times previously in the 50-
year history of the AP poll â€” three times in 1960
and three in 1961. The Hawkeyes were first in
the 1961 preseason poll and also in the first
regular-season poll before they played a game.
They remained No. 1 after beating California 28-
7 but fell to second the following week despite a
35-34 triumph over Southern Cal.
The Hawkeyes kept winning but kept drop
ping. They slid to fourth after beating Indiana 27-
8 and slipped to fifth following a 47-15 rout of
Wisconsin for a 4-0 record. The pollsters must
have known something because lowa finished
the season with a 5-4 record. That was its last
winning season until 1981.
The string of 19 nonwinning seasons has since
been broken by Rice, which had 21 in a row en
tering the 1985 campaign.
