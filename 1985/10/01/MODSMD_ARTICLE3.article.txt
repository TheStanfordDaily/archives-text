# USW and University Remain at Odds
## Talks produce little 
### MARK BEYREIS Staff writer 
Little progress was made yester
day in the latest round of contract
negotiations between the Univer
sity and USW (United Stanford
Workers).
The bargaining session was
"mostly a summary of status," said
Priscilla Wheeler, staff counsel and
chief negotiator for the University.
The only new developments
were the union's proposal to
negotiate the contract for two years
and some corrections of
typographical errors, according to
Wheeler. The University has
sought a three-year contract in
stead of the original one-year
agreement proposed by USW, she
said.
Both sides went through the old
contract and placed each issue into
one of three catagories: tentative
agreement, no change proposed or
unresolved.
Wheeler said not a single one of
the tentative agreements had been
made on a significant issue.
The pension increase proposed

by the union is among me muiÂ«_ im
portant unresolved issues as of yes
terday's meeting, according to
Wheeler.
Wheeler said that there is an ex
treme disparity between the Uni
versity's and the union's projected
cost of USW's pension proposals.
The key plank of the union's
benefit plan, which was put on the
table Sept. 25, is a 4 percent Cost
of Living Adjustment (COLA). The
proposed COLA would increase the
benefits in order to offset inflation.
Wheeler said the COLA would
cost the University $9.4 million or
27.9 percent of its current $33 mil
lion wage base costs.
Union officals described the cost
as being "negligible" in a pamphlet
they distributed.
While the talks have not been
acrimonious, they have been
delayed by introduction of the
COLA proposal which is more
costly than the union's original of
fer, according to Wheeler.
"Sometimes it seems we have
very different realities," Wheeler
said of the proposal.

"What we're really standing firm on is what we perceive as our
survival," Mary Ann Tenuto, head negotiator for USW, told stu
dents yesterday at Wilbur Hall, in reference to current contract
negotiations with the University.
Speaking at Wilbur Hall last night,
head union negotiator Mary Ann
Tenuto addressed the possibility of
a strike in light of stalled bargaining.
"We've got a couple more weeks
to go. Ultimately, if there isn't
more movement, we will have a
choice of striking, taking a horrible
contract or we can propose putting
it before an arbitrator," Tenuto
said.

Tenuto could not be reached for
comment on yesterday's negotia
tions.
Another important but un
resolved issue discussed yesterday
is the union's proposed wage in
crease. Both sides estimate that
the increase would be 14 percent of
the University's current $33 million
wage costs.
In addition to the pension and
wage increases, the two sides have
yet to come to terms on the union's
proposal to delete the no-strike
clause in the grievance and arbitra

tion procedure, according to
Wheeler.
The two sides also haven't
agreed on the question of the Uni
versity's right to have some work
done by outside contractors. Cur
rently, USW wants the people
employed by outside contractors
working at the University to
become full-time University
employees.
Problems also have risen in the
question of lay-offs. According to
Wheeler, the union wants seniority

to be the only criteria for laying-off
workers. But the University wants
to continue to consider "skill and
ability," Wheeler said.
Another unresolved issue is the
union's proposed increase in
release time, the paid time off that
the University gives to union
stewards.
Wheeler said the two groups
would meet again Thursday, when
the University will offer new
proposals focusing on the remaining
unresolved issues.
