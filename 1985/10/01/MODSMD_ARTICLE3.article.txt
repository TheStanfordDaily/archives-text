# USW and University Remain at Odds
## Talks produce little 
### MARK BEYREIS Staff writer 
Little progress was made yester
day in the latest round of contract
negotiations between the Univer
sity and USW (United Stanford
Workers).
The bargaining session was
"mostly a summary of status," said
Priscilla Wheeler, staff counsel and
chief negotiator for the University.
The only new developments
were the union's proposal to
negotiate the contract for two years
and some corrections of
typographical errors, according to
Wheeler. The University has
sought a three-year contract in
stead of the original one-year
agreement proposed by USW, she
said.
Both sides went through the old
contract and placed each issue into
one of three catagories: tentative
agreement, no change proposed or
unresolved.
Wheeler said not a single one of
the tentative agreements had been
made on a significant issue.
The pension increase proposed

by the union is among me muiÂ«_ im
portant unresolved issues as of yes
terday's meeting, according to
Wheeler.
Wheeler said that there is an ex
treme disparity between the Uni
versity's and the union's projected
cost of USW's pension proposals.
The key plank of the union's
benefit plan, which was put on the
table Sept. 25, is a 4 percent Cost
of Living Adjustment (COLA). The
proposed COLA would increase the
benefits in order to offset inflation.
Wheeler said the COLA would
cost the University $9.4 million or
27.9 percent of its current $33 mil
lion wage base costs.
Union officals described the cost
as being "negligible" in a pamphlet
they distributed.
While the talks have not been
acrimonious, they have been
delayed by introduction of the
COLA proposal which is more
costly than the union's original of
fer, according to Wheeler.
"Sometimes it seems we have
very different realities," Wheeler
said of the proposal.

"What we're really standing firm on is what we perceive as our
survival," Mary Ann Tenuto, head negotiator for USW, told stu
dents yesterday at Wilbur Hall, in reference to current contract
negotiations with the University.
