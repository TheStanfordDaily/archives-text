led Pittsburgh rally that had turned a 21-10 deficit into a 24-21 lead in
a span of 1:28. .
Holman, taking advantage of the Steelers' tight coverage on wide
receivers Cris Collinsworth and Eddie Brown, landed scoring passes

in Pittsburgh.
With the Steelers leading 24-21 in the fourth quarter, wide
receiver Louis Lipps fumbled while attempting to pitch the ball back
to Malone on a flea flicker play, and linebacker Reggie Williams fell on
the ball at the Pittsburgh 33.
Esiason scrambled for four yards, then rifled a 24-yard completion
to Brown for a first down at the Pittsburgh 5. A play later, Esiason
hit Holman over the middle for what proved the deciding score.
