Botha Offers Minor Concessions
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — President P.W. Botha offered
some concessions to South Africa's black majority yesterday, includ
ing the possibility of seats on the advisory President's Council, but
ruled out full voting rights. He said the lesson of black Africa is that
one man, one vote "means the dictatorship of the strongest black
group."
Botha declared his commitment to a united nation that allows for
, black rights, but said any future system must protect the rights of
whites and other minorities in South Africa, which has been swept by
more than a year of violence against white-minority rule.
The 60-member President's Council advises the government on
legislation. It was restructured last year to include mixed-race and
Asian members, after legislative bodies with limited power were es
tablished for those minorities. But whites remain in control.
Botha offered no specifics in his speech to a congress of his ruling
National Party in the Cape Province city of Port Elizabeth. He said
details must be negotiated.
It contained none of the bellicosity that characterized his remarks
to the Durban party congress Aug. 15, in which he said full voting
rights for blacks would take the white minority "on a road to abdica
tion and suicide."
Disappointment over the tone and contents of the Durban speech
caused international reaction that thrust the country deeper into fin
ancial crisis and sent its currency to new lows on world markets.
The central question, as Botha expressed it, is how to include
non-white minorities in a constitutional system built by whites over
three centuries — "that is, how they can share in a liberated South
Africa. All reasonable South Africans want to see that freedom
become their share."
He appealed to black leaders to enter negotiations, and did not
repeat such past preconditions as renouncing civil disobedience.
"The facts are that we are busy (working) to outgrow apartheid in
the discriminatory and negative sense, and have done so in many
respects," he said.
Botha portrayed himself as caught between a radical left and reac
tionary right, seeking a middle ground that "recognizes the principle
of self-determination of . . . community life such as education, resi
dential areas and social welfare, local management and private
ownership — in other words, in culture in the general meaning of the
word."
That appeared to imply a continued commitment to segregation of
neighborhoods and schools, long-standing party policy.
He said he was prepared to include blacks in the President's Coun
cil "if the need exists among the leaders of black communities to par
ticipate within the President's Council in inquiries and the submission
of proposals ... on matters concerning those communities."
Gunmen Seize Soviets in Beirut
BEIRUT — Three Soviet diplomats and a doctor working at the
Soviet Embassy were kidnapped by gunmen in Moslem West Beirut
yesterday, radio stations reported.
After they were abducted, the radios reported that two Soviet
Embassy cars were found abandoned.
Police were not able to confirm the kidnapping immediately. So
viet Embassy personnel could not not be reached by telephone.
The radio stations identified the three Soviet diplomats as Arkady
Katayov, Oleg Spirin and Valery Kornev. The doctor was not identi
fied.
It was the first time Soviets had been reported kidnapped in west
Beirut since gunmen began seizing foreigners in January 1984.
The Christian Voice of Lebanon linked the kidnapping to a threat
by the shadowy Shiite Moslem Islamic Jihad on Sunday to strike
against leftists supporting a Syrian-backed offensive against fun
damentalist Moslem fighters in Tripoli, Lebanon's second largest
city.
The leftists include the pro-Moscow Lebanese Communist Party.
D'Aubuisson Loses Party Post
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — Roberto d'Aubuisson, a former
National Guard major who was defeated for the presidency by Jose
Napoleon Duarte last year, was replaced Sunday as head of the arch
conservative ARENA party.
The 40-year-old d'Aubuisson headed ARENA, short for the Re
publican Nationalist Alliance, since its founding four years ago. He
has been linked in many accounts to El Salvador's rightist death
squads, but he has denied those charges.
An ARENA convention of about 800 delegates meeting at the
Sheraton Hotel in San Salvador replaced d'Aubuisson with Alfredo
Cristiani, a coffee grower said to be about 40. Little is known about
Cristiani.
The delegates also voted to award the title of "honorary ARENA
president for life" to d'Aubuisson, but the position appeared to carry
no power.
The decision to choose a new party leader apparently was made
jointly by d'Aubuisson and ARENA. He retained his post as a party
deputy in the National Assembly.
The extreme right is widely blamed for thousands of political mur
ders in El Salvador, including that of the Rev. Oscar Romero, arch
bishop of San Salvador, in 1980.
Reagan, Hussein Discuss Talks
WASHINGTON — President Reagan expressed optimism yester
day about overcoming obstacles to the opening of Arab-Israeli peace
talks this year, while Jordan's King Hussein stressed that negotia
tions must take place at an international conference attended by the
Soviet Union.
Reagan and Hussein met for nearly an hour in their second round
of talks this year. The meeting came against the backdrop of
Reagan's announcement Friday of a controversial, $1.55 billion
weapons package for Jordan.
The United States and Israel have objected to holding peace talks
at an international conference because that would give the Soviet
Union a role in shaping the future of the Middle East. Israel does not
have diplomatic relations with Moscow, and the Soviets have pro
vided arms to Syria and other Arab countries hostile to Israel.
A senior Administration official said Reagan and Hussein focused
their talks "very intensively" on the organization and structure of an
international conference.
"I think headway has been made. This is not the moment, this is
not the place to get into the details of that headway," said the official,
briefing reporters under rules granting him anonymity.
Reagan and Hussein both have talked about holding negotiations
under "appropriate auspices" but have differed on what that should
be.
