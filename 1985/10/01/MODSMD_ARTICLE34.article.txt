# Western leaders to meet in New York
## Reagan Calls for Pre-Summit Conference 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan has
asked the leaders of six industrial powers to
meet with him in New York later in September
to discuss issues that he plans to take up with
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev at their Geneva
summit, the White House disclosed yesterday.
The session, including a working luncheon
hosted by Reagan, is expected to take place Oct.
24 when Reagan and the other leaders visit the
United Nations in connection with ceremonies
marking the 40th anniversary of the world or
ganization.
Seeking to take advantage of the U.N. gather
ing, Reagan has sent invitations to the leaders of
Britain, Canada, France, Italy, West Germany
and Japan, the same countries that join the
United States in regular economic summit con
ferences. It was not known yet what the
responses were.
"The president is looking forward to having a
dialogue with the Western leaders and express
ing his own on a range of issues before the presi

dent's meeting with General Secretary Gorba
chev in November," said White House spokes
man Edward Djerejian. "The presence of the
Western leaders at the United Nations in Octo
ber provides a timely opportunity for such a
working session."
Besides being a part of Reagan's preparation
for the Nov. 19-20 summit, the planned gather
ing of the Western leaders was viewed as an
other move in the elaborate pre-summit
maneuvering that has seen both sides carefully
trying to establish position in a public relations
contest.
The White House announcement of Reagan's
invitation coincided with the Soviet Union's for
mal placement of its new arms control proposal
before U.S. negotiators in Geneva. The pro
posal, which reportedly calls for reductions of up
to 50 percent in offensive weapons, was outlined
to Reagan last Friday in a meeting with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
Officials said Monday the president wants to

talk with the other Western leaders about the
whole range of subjects expected to come up at
the summit, including arms control, which has
emerged as the meeting's centerpiece.
In the immediate wake of the new Soviet pro
posal, the Administration gave all indications that
it will not relinquish its Strategic Defense Initia
tive, the research on a so-called Star Wars
space missile defense, in exchange for cuts in of
fensive arms.
The much-debated research is expected to be
one of the topics before the allied leaders in the
U.N. meeting suggested by Reagan. Britain,
West Germany and Israel have indicated they
wish to take part in the research, while Canada,
France, Norway and Denmark have declined.
In an interview published in Paris on yester
day and made available by the White House,
Reagan noted that it will be years before it can
be determined whether strategic defensive
weapons are feasible.
