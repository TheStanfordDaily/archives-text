# President Asks Heckler To Resign
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President
Reagan asked Health and Human
Services Secretary Margaret Heck
ler yesterday to give up her Cabinet
post for the ambassadorship to
Ireland, the White House an
nounced.
Heckler, who launched a cam
paign in recent days to save her job
at the helm of the government's
largest department, asked for and
was given a few days to think about
it, presidential spokesman Larry
Speakes said.
Heckler met with Reagan alone
in the Oval Office for 50 minutes
Monday afternoon to try to talk him
out of reassigning her.
But Speakes said the president,
who denied earlier in the day that
he would fire the HHS secretary,
urged her to accept the job as "a
promotion."
Earlier, Reagan had declared
himself satisfied with the perfor
mance of Heckler, whose manage
ment ability and loyalty to conser
vative principles have been ques

tioned by top Administration offi
cials.
Heckler, after leaving the White
House, ignored reporters' attempts
to question her. She returned to
HHS headquarters after the session
and met with some members of her
staff. A spokeswoman said the sec
retary would have no immediate
comment on the session with
Reagan.
Reagan, who had never asked a
member of his Cabinet to step
down, apparently was convinced by
his chief of staff, Donald Regan, and
other advisers that Heckler should
be moved out of the leadership of
the giant bureaucracy. But Speakes
insisted the president was not dis
satisfied with her performance and
that she was not being fired.
Asked if she had the option of
remaining in her post, however, the
spokesman replied, "I do not have
an answer to that."
Speakes said Heckler has
"served with distinction as a mem
ber of Congress and as a member of

the Cabinet" and, as a woman of
Irish descent, "she would make a
valuable contribution in U.S.-Irish
relations and be able to work
toward solving problems in the
region."

"Mrs. Heckler has asked for a
few days to consider the presi
dent's offer and will respond at that
time," the spokesman said.
"Meanwhile, she remains as secre
tary of Health and Human
Services."
Speakes was asked repeatedly
why Reagan wanted Heckler out of
the Cabinet post, and would not
reply directly.
Although Speakes repeatedly
characterized the job offer as a
promotion, it would mean a pay cut
of about $15,000 a year and the loss
of a department with 145,000
employees and, as she was fond of
saying, the largest budget in the
world with the exception of the
entire U.S. and Soviet budgets —
$330 billion.
Reports had circulated for days
that Reagan was about to name
Heckler ambassador to Ireland.
"That's a lovely position — for
someone else," Heckler said of the
ambassadorship last month.
