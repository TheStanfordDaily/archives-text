Economy Shows Rise
WASHINGTON — The government's main
economic forecasting measure rose a solid 0.7
percent in August, the Department of Com
merce reported yesterday, providing another
sign that the economy is returning to a pattern
of growth after a year of virtual stagnation.
The rise in the index of leading indicators
last month was the fourth consecutive increase
and the seventh in the past eight months,
leading the Reagan Administration to reassert
its forecast of booming growth for the latter
part of the year. In addition, the Department
of Commerce revised upward the gain in the
July index from 0.4 percent to 0.7 percent.
At the White House, spokesman Larry
Speakes called Monday's report "further
evidence that a rapid improvement in eco
nomic performance is under way in the second
half." He added: "With unemployment falling,
housing starts booming, personal income on
the rise and inflation below 3 percent, the U.S.
economy continues to show the world what
can be accomplished."
Private economists cautiously agreed that
the economy began to pick up speed this sum
mer after an anemic growth rate of about 1
percent from January through June. But they

dismissed as overly optimistic the Administra
tion's forecast of the year-end surge that
would be needed to pull the growth rate up to
its prediction of 4 percent for all of 1985.
De Lorean Arraigned
DETROIT — John De Lorean pleaded inno
cent yesterday to defrauding investors in his
car company of $8.9 million and was released
on a $1 million unsecured bond.
"It's not the homecoming I was looking for
ward to," De Lorean said as he left the federal
courthouse.
U.S. Magistrate Virginia Morgan also or
dered De Lorean not to leave the continental
United States and to surrender his passport.
She ordered the auto entrepreneur to report
each week where he would be traveling.
An unsecured bond means De Lorean need
not post bond but would forfeit the money if he
should fail to make a court appearance.
De Lorean, who recently went through a
bitter divorce from model Cristina Ferrare and
won acquittal in Los Angeles on cocaine traf
ficking charges, smiled and looked relaxed as
he waited for the arraignment to start, sitting
on the edge of a table while television artists

sketched him.
U.S. District Judge Julian Cook set trial for
Nov. 18.
A grand jury on Sept. 20 charged De
Lorean, 60, with diverting the money from De
Lorean Research Limited Partnership, the re
search arm of De Lorean Motor Co.
Stocks Gain Slightly
NEW YORK — The stock market closed
out a generally uninspired third quarter of 1985
with some scattered gains yesterday.
Trading was fairly active at the outset as
Wall Street began operating on an extended
daily routine.
But a good deal of the early activity was
ascribed to the execution of orders that
couldn't be handled last Friday, when the ex
changes were closed as Hurricane Gloria
passed through the New York area. Later on,
the pace of trading slowed.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
rose 7.84 to 1,328.63, finishing September
with a net loss of 5.38 points and the third
quarter with a net decline of 6.83 points.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
came to 103.62 million shares, against 106.10
million last Thursday.
