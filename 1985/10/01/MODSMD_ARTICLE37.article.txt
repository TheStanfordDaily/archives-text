Streleski in Oakland
OAKLAND — Theodore Streleski, who
beat his Stanford professor to death with a
hammer, has moved aboard a houseboat at an
Oakland marina, and the reaction of his nautical
neighbors has been mixed.
Streleski moved on board the 45-foot
Coronado on Friday to take advantage of what
he called "very cheap lodging."
"I'd prefer he wasn't here," said Ron Nel
son, 44, who lives aboard his sailboat. "I don't
think that he ever did pay his debt to society,
and I don't think he ever will. ... I don't think
he should ever be out on the streets."
Streleski spent seven years in prison on a
second-degree murder conviction for the Aug.
18, 1978 slaying of math professor Karel
DeLeeuw to protest what he described as
mistreatment of graduate students. He was
released earlier this month.

He had spent 19 years pursuing a doctorate
at the University.
Mark Fritschi, project manager at Embar
cadero Cove where Streleski now lives, said
he has "a problem" with having the notorious
killer at the marina.
Garamendi Bows Out
SACRAMENTO — State Sen. John
Garamendi withdrew from the 1986 race for
governor yesterday, saying his only chance to
win the Democratic nomination would be to
wage a distasteful negative campaign against
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley.
"The path to victory is one we didn't want to
follow," Garamendi told a Capitol news confer
ence.
Although Bradley has not announced his
candidacy for governor, he has left little doubt

that he is anxious for a 1986 rematch with
Gov. George Deukmejian, who defeated him
in 1982 by a 1.2 percent margin in California's
closest gubernatorial race in this century.
Killer Consults Belli
LOS ANGELES — Trial lawyer Melvin Belli
says he has met with "Night Stalker" defen
dant Richard Ramirez and may work the first
part of the defense, but is unable to take the
entire serial murder case.
"I'm ashamed I had to tell him I couldn't take
it because it's a case I certainly would like to
take," Belli said in a telephone interview from
his San Francisco office over the weekend.
Ramirez, a 25-year-old drifter from Texas,
was charged Friday with 68 felonies.
Belli, who has specialized over the years in
civil lawsuits, said the public defender's office
"will do a good job" representing Ramirez.
