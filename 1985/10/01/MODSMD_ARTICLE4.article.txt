University's chief negotiator, told
The Daily that "nothing could be
further from the truth."
"Our end goal is simply to come
to an agreement and live with it,"
Wheeler said.
In response to the union's allega
tions that Campus Report intention
ally misrepresents USW's position.
Wheeler said, "It seems that every
time somebody prints something
that Local 680 (USW) dislikes, they
accuse that person of being
biased."
The University and USW have
been negotiating on a new contract
since late June, according to Step
hens. The old contract expired
Aug. 31.
The chief stumbling block to a
settlement, according to Stephens,
is the University's attempt to elimi
nate union jobs and replace them
with temporary workers. Pensions,
benefits, comparable worth and
wage proposals also seperate the
two sides, he said.
"There has been no movement at
all on the University's side,"

Claiming the University is mis
representing the union's position
and attempting to "drive a wedge
between students and workers,"
negotiators for United Stanford
Workers presented their case
against the administration last
night.
Speaking at the Soto lounge in
Wilbur Hall before a group of about
30 students and faculty members,
USW negotiators Mary Ann Tenuto
and David Stephens said the Uni
versity is attempting to provoke a
strike with the eventual goal of
"busting the union."
Stephens also said that Campus
Report, published by the University
News Service, is biased in its
reporting of the union's position and
serves as a medium for University
"propaganda."
The presentation was part of an
ongoing attempt by USW to reach
students and counter the adminis
tration's public relations campaign
against the union, Stephens said.

Instead of negotiating on issues
of mutual concern, the administra

consists of a series of "take
aways," she said.
According to Wheeler, however,
USW is attempting to increase the
size of its on-campus work force
and the union refuses to address
the University's major concerns.
"We can't negotiate for too much
longer," Tenuto said. "Ultimately
we may be faced with the decision
of either accepting a horrible con
tract, submitting to arbitration or
striking. . . .
"What we're really standing firm
on is what we perceive as our own
survival," Tenuto said.
"We have no wish for a strike;
workers always lose in a strike,"
elaborated Stephens. "If there is a
strike, it will only be because the
University forced it upon us."
However, Wheeler said that
"They (USW) are negotiating in
public; they're not at the bargaining
table — that's unfortunate."
Unless the University begins
good-faith negotiations, "we're
headed for confrontation," accord
