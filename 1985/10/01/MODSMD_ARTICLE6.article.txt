# Daily Cal Embarks Upon Wider Mission
## 
### SYDNEY SMITH Editorial staff 
Stumbling along to calculus, you are able to
muster enough strength to open one eye and
glance at the front page of The Stanford Daily. A
rather unusual headline draws you attention.
"Palo Alto Tenant .Sues Landlord," it reads. Flip
ping the page, you find that the local high school
lost its most important football game of the year.
No, The Stanford Daily is not changing its
coverage in the foreseeable future. But The
Daily Californian, the student newspaper at the
University of California at Berkeley, is now com
pleting a format change that began one-and-a
half years ago.
Since March 1984, when the Berkeley
Gazette, the city's major daily newspaper, went
out of business, The Daily Cal has slowly ex
panded its coverage to fill the void that was left
by the defunct publication. As a result of this ex
pansion, Berkeley's counterpart to The Stanford
Daily has made changes that make The Daily Cal
quite a bit different from Stanford's campus
newspaper.
Although both The Stanford Daily and The
Daily Cal are independent newspapers, the
paper you read each morning has chosen to keep
its coverage within the bounds of the campus
proper. While The Stanford Daily runs only
campus stories on the front page, The Daily Cal
forces campus news to share the front page, as

well as the inner sections, with Berkeley's com
munity news.
According to City Editor Will Miner, The Daily
Cal covers the Berkeley city council, the rent
board, the school board and the planning com
mission. One drawback to The Daily Cal's
relatively small size is its inability to effectively
cover all 36 of the Berkeley city council's sub
sidiary boards.
The Stanford Daily's editor in chief, Troy Eid,
remarked that it is "certainly a noble venture"
for The Daily Cal to "to try to take the responsi
bility to fill the void" left by the Berkeley
Gazette.
Eid said he feels questions must be raised as
to whether some coverage of city news is better
than the more complete coverage another news
paper might offer, and whether an expanded
Daily Cal can still provide UC-Berkeley students
with the full scope of campus news.
"Student reporters and photographers
naturally have various demands and interests
outside of the paper," Eid said. "Student
newspapers are subject to constraints on time
and resources that don't always mesh with the
expansion plans we'd all like to pursue."
According to Harry Press, editor of The Stan
ford Observer, "as long as the emphasis is on
campus news," The Daily Cal is fulfilling its re
sponsibilities as a campus newspaper.
Respecting its community as generally "more
enlightened" than the typical city audience, The
Daily Cal attempts to include in-depth coverage

of national and international issues, to provide
"the wide picture" readers usually do not find in
daily newspapers, according to Miner.
In addition to the city councils, national and
world news, the Daily Cal also includes modem
urban issues in its pages. Such issues as housing
development, rent control, and Berkeley's busi
ness community receive wide coverage.
Although members of the editorial board at
the Daily Cal have discussed using a two-section
format, one section for campus news and one for
city news, the Berkeley newspaper continues to
mix city and campus news stories throughout
each edition. Precedence on the front page is
given to any story that effects the greater num
ber of people, whether it is a campus student
strike, or a decision by the Berkeley City Coun
cil.
At this point, Miner said he considers the
Daily Cal a "major fact in the city" of Berkeley.
Miner, however, did indicate that the newspaper
finds it difficult to attract advertisers from the
city, since the Daily Cal has the stigma of being a
"student newspaper."
Despite the extended role of the Daily Cal, the
staff of Berkeley's "campus" paper remains
similar to that of The Stanford Daily. Cub
reporters are invited to write for the Daily Cal,
and no experience is needed. While the majority
of the writers are students, The Daily Cal, unlike
The Stanford Daily, does hire full-time
reporters, mostly graduated students, to cover
the citv beats.
