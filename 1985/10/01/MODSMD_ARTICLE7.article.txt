### MARY YUH Editorial staff 
Saturday's confusion over the
press passes that resulted in the
arrest of Robert Andres, chief
photographer for the Peninsula
Times Tribune, arose "because
we had a different color pass for
CBS folk," according to Athletic
Department Director Andy
Geiger.
Some of the staff at the Ath
letic Department apparently
were unaware that both the
white passes issued to approxi
mately 30 photographers at the
Stanford-Texas game and the or
ange ones issued to CBS person
nel were valid field passes,
Geiger explained.
Andres was among several
photographers who were told
that their passes were not valid
and were ordered off the field by
police.
"We called (the Athletic De
partment) and said, 'Is this pass
valid?' They said, 'No, it's not
good,' " Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington said.
Andres "didn't have the right
to dispute (the order to leave the

field), regardless of whether his
pass was valid or not," according
to Herrington.
Andres was arrested for
impeding an officer in the dis
charge of his duties, Herrington
said.
Although Andres said he suf
fered a fractured wrist as a
result of the altercation, Her
rington denied knowledge of any
injury.
"I don't know anything about
his fractured wrist," Herrington
said. "He didn't say anything to
us. He didn't complain of any
pain."
Times Tribune Editor Michael
Kidder said the paper is not plan
ning to take any legal action at
this time.
"We're talking with University
authorities," he said.
Andres said he is considering
individual action against the
Stanford Police Department.
Neither Geiger nor Her
rington confirmed rumors that
CBS had told the police that the
white passes were invalid.
Geiger called the confusion
"just a glitch," and said, "It hap
pens once in a while and we don't
like it."
