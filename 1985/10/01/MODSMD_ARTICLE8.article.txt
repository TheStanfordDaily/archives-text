## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
The suspect involved in Saturday's altercation
that lead to the injury of two Stanford police offi
cers remained in jail yesterday, and police
released more details of the incident.
Matthew Conway, 24, faces six felony counts,
including assault and battery, assualt with a
deadly weapon and obstructing an officer in the
line of duty. Conway, who is not a Stanford stu
dent, is being held at North County Jail in lieu of
$50,000.
According to Marvin Herrington, Stanford
chief of police, the incident began when officer
Keith Viveiros pulled over Conway for speeding
on Campus Drive between Wilbur and Stern
Halls, asking him to step out of the car.
"It was pretty evident . . . he'd been drink
ing," Herrington said, noting that Viveiros
proceeded to administer a sobriety test to Con
way that indicated the driver was intoxicated.

Herrington said the exact alcohol level in Con
way's blood will not be available for several days.
According to Herrington, Conway then bolted
from Viveiros when the officer attempted to
handcuff him for driving under the influence of al
cohol, shouting, "No way. Fâ€” you."
Viveiros chased Conway on foot across the
field behind Wilbur and Stern Halls, lunging for
the suspect on the driveway behind Wilbur.
Viveiros missed the suspect and suffered
"lacerations to the hands and face," Herrington
said.
Officer Hilary Karp, back-up for Viveiros,
then chased Conway approximately 100 yards
further on Wilbur Field before catching the
suspect. As Karp attempted to apprehend Con
way, the suspect grabbed the officer's hand radio
and struck him three times in the head, Her
rington said.
Karp was "probably knocked out at that
point," Herrington said, noting thatpolice radios
weigh several pounds.
"Karp was kind of dizzy and out of it, but he
continued the chase," Herrington said, adding

that Conway continued to flee, cutting across
Arguello Way and running in front of Stern. The
suspect then crossed Escondido Road and ran
around Crothers and Crothers Memorial Halls
before running tlirough the parking lot between
Branner and Toyon Halls.
Conway next headed back across Escondido
Road where officers Karp and David Lee, a
motorcycle policeman responding to the call,
subdued Conway.
At that point, according to Herrington, Karp
collapsed and was taken to Stanford Hospital by
paramedics who had arrived on the scene.
Karp was released from the hospital two to
three hours later, Herrington said, and Vivieros
was released early Sunday morning. Both offi
cers were off duty yesterday and Herrington
said that Viveiros will probably be off duty for
four or five days.
Herrington said he did not know why Conway
was on campus, although he said he presumed
Conway had been at the Stanford-Texas football
game Saturday afternoon.
