Cable television appears to be headed for the Stan
ford area, as two companies compete for a franchise
from the City of Palo Alto.
Backers of City Cable Partners and Cable Communi
cations Cooperative of Palo Alto, Inc., debated for
hours last night before the City Council in the first of
several nights of public testimony. Both companies
have ties to national cable chains.
The winner of the vote, to take place once testimony
ends, will service the Palo Alto area, including Stan
ford.
The financial stability of the companies was the
central issue of the debate.
Supporters of City Cable Partners, a limited partner
ship controlled by a few shareholders, stressed the
company's lower subscription rates and the financial

stability of the Bank of America, the company's main
investor, while questioning the stability of its competi
tor's bank.
However, backers of Cable Co-op denied that their
primary investor, National Cooperative Bank, is un
stable. They emphasized the advantages of a
cooperative, which they said would be more
responsive to the community's needs than a private
company.
Cable Co-Op has over 300 investors and a commit
ment from Pacific Bell to invest in the development of a
two-way communications system.
David Cheriton, professor of computer science at
Stanford and member of the Cable Co-Op, said the
company could provide exciting opportunities for com
puter technology.
According to Cheriton, a system of telecommuting,
through which people would be able to work for corpo
rations by remote, could be made available by Cable
Co-Op.
