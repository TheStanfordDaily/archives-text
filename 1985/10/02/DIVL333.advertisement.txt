APPLYING TO
COLLEGE OR
GRADUATE SCHOOL
IS NO
LAUGHING MATTER.
A well-written application
is an important step in the
admissions process.
The 1985 Guide to Higher
Education Application and
Admission helps the
applicant prepare an
effective, carefully planned,
and polished application. The
memorandum discusses and
analyzes all parts of the
application, and focuses
especially on the required
essay, in which it is essential
to present one's goals and
strengths in an impressive
and cogent format.
For a copy, send applicant's
name and address, type of
school (college, law, business
or medicine), and a check for
$5.00 plus $1.00 postage to:
