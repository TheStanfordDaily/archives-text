# Mosher Loses in His Last Appeal
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Steven Mosher, the former an
thropology doctoral student who
was expelled in 1983, has lost his
final appeal to University President
Donald Kennedy, who accused him
of deliberately lying during Stan
ford's investigations into his activi
ties.
In a 40-page letter to Mosher,
Kennedy painted the picture of an
opportunistic, manipulative and
deceitful man who abused the Uni
versity's student-faculty relation
ship and showed deliberate disre
gard for research subjects in China.
Kennedy said in his letter that
Mosher's "lack of candor" has
"eroded the trust and confidence
necessary to graduate education."
In addition to his statements about
Mosher's character, Kennedy cited
in the letter several incidents
during the investigation in which he
said Mosher withheld significant in
formation, gave conflicting versions
or was purposely misleading.
Mosher, 37, was dismissed by a

unanimous vote of the Anthropol
ogy Department Faculty on Feb. 24,
1983, for "illegal and seriously un
ethical conduct" while in China in
1979 and 1980.
The charges against him are said
to include smuggling, bribing
Chinese officials to obtain govern
ment documents and venturing into
territory closed to foreigners.
Mosher has denied these charges
and said repeatedly that the Univer
sity expelled him because he wrote
an article condemning Chinese
birth-control policies. The article,
accompanied by photographs of
naked women awaiting abortions in
their eighth month of pregnancy,
was published in a Taiwanese mag
azine.
Mosher said yesterday that he
feels "terribly wronged" by the
University's final decision, which is
the third confirmation of the original
1983 verdict. He added that he
plans to challenge Stanford in court.
Saying he never lied and was
indeed candid throughout the inves
tigation, Mosher called Kennedy's
letter "an attempt at character as
sassination." He said Kennedy used

an "attack on my personal
credibility" so that "by a leap of
faith, people would believe all the
charges against me are true. In
fact, all the charges are false.
"If you can't prove the allega
tions, you try to discredit the per
son," he said.
Kennedy, in response to
Mosher's comments, said his 40-
page letter "speaks for itself."
The letter, which includes a
detailed chronology of Mosher's
statements and letters on several
specific issues, underscores many
inconsistencies in the doctoral stu
dent's reports. Mosher is accused,
for example, of lying to Kennedy
about the authorship of a sales
receipt for a camera purchased for
field research in China in 1980.
According to Kennedy's letter,
Mosher "submitted a false receipt"
for the camera, gave conflicting
reports on its ownership and date of
purchase, and failed to provide the
University with the camera,
"despite the facts that you say you
have it, that it might substantiate
your story and that at least one
timp von acknowledged that it

belongs to the Department of An
thropology. " »
Mosher said yesterday that he
never lied when discussing the
camera during the investigation,
and that it was "not fair" for the
University to require him to
produce it because it was rightfully
his.
Kennedy's letter said also that
Mosher told conflicting stories
about a research assistant from
Hong Kong, about customs inspec
tion and about whether a van used
in China "was to be used as an
inducement for cooperation or
donated to the (villagers) as 'a gift
of the heart.' "
Mosher yesterday played those
accusations off as "half-truths at
best."
In addition, Mosher denied
charges that he abused the relation
ship between graduate students
and advisers, saying instead that
"the anthropology faculty abused
the trust between advisers and
graduate students."
Kennedy's letter said that


Art Streiber/Daily file
Former anthropology doctoral student Steven Mosher appealed
to the University a final time, and lost. He received an extensive
letter from University President Donald Kennedy berating him
for his unethical conduct in China.
Mosher "abused those relationships
by submitting (as a dissertation) a
popular ethnography of China in
stead of a scholarly demographic
study of Taiwan." Also, the letter
said Mosher is at fault for not in
forming Stanford about his arrest in
China until directly asked.
Mosher said yesterday that his
failure to inform the University of
his arrest — which he has never
denied — was a case of omission
rather than commission, and thus
was not a "punishable offense."
Mosher noted that Kennedy's
letter cleared him of "all the allega
tions of my original spouse,"
Maggie So, who has testified
against him.
Kennedy said in the letter that "it
is difficult for me personally to ac
cept her story as a whole as estab
lished by 'strongly persuasive
evidence,' or to be sufficiently cer
tain of which parts are correct." He
also said that Mosher could have al
tered the outcome of the case
during the original investigation had
he come forward with specific
refutations of So's statements, but
said Mosher was not "forthcoming"
at the time.
An appendix to Kennedy's letter
includes new details from a lengthy
report on So's allegations, including
one that she stood watch while
Mosher tried to break into a docu
ments room in China. The appendix
notes that Mosher denied the
charge.
Mosher contends that China
pressured Kennedy to uphold the
expulsion ruling by issuing a warn

ing last year that future cultural and
educational exchanges between the
United States and China might be
endangered if Mosher were read
mitted.
"Anyone over the age of three
knows the political consequences of
the decision were weighed in the
context of this pressure," Mosher
said.
Kennedy acknowledged in his
letter that Wang Ping of the
Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences did make this threat, but
said it had no influence on his deci
sion.
"It is wrong to give in to a
threat," he wrote. "It is equally
wrong, however, to alter a decision
in order to avoid the appearance of
yielding to a threat. ... My duty in
this case is to call it as I see it."
Asked yesterday whether he felt
that reinstating Mosher would have
affected U.S.-Chinese cultural ex
changes, Kennedy said, "I doubt
it,"and noted once again that the
issue had no influence on his deci
sion.
The Mosher case has received
wide press coverage in the past five
years, largely because it has raised
issues involving academic freedom.
Mosher has published two books
based on his experiences in China
— "Broken Earth" and "Journey to
the Forbidden China" — and said
he recently finished a novel. Ac
cording to The Washington Post,
his report about forced abortions
and infanticide in China helped force
a cutoff of U.S. funds to some U.N.
population programs.
Mosher called Kennedy's final
decision "a blow against academic
freedom," but Kennedy, asked

whether he agreed, said,
"Absolutely not."
Mosher said the University
pretends to encourage academic
freedom, but that in reality, "You
are only free to publish that which
senior professors approve."
He said that several graduate
students and untenured faculty
members here have written him to
say that they, too, believe there is
"academic unfreedom" at Stanford.
Kennedy's letter focused on re
sponsibilities of the Stanford stu
dent rather than the degree of aca
demic freedom allowed at the Uni
versity.
"It is my view, as it was the
(Anthropology) Department's, that
the doctoral degree constitutes the
academic license to practice the
craft of scholarship and teaching,"
the letter said. "In anthropology,
interaction with human subjects is a
major component of the profes
sional role; there is an extremely
high responsibility for the welfare of
those being studied; there is a criti
cal need for fair and objective
reporting of events, including the
behavior of the investigator, since a
significant part of the researcher's
results cannot be replicated by
others.
"You have destroyed the confi
dence of those of us at Stanford
with whom you have dealt that you
can fulfill these requirements — not
only by strongly persuasive
evidence, but, in my view, beyond
a reasonable doubt.
"The department could not, un
der the circumstances, justify per
mitting you to continue in a pro
gram leading to that degree at this
University. Nor can I."

said it had no influence on his deci
sion.
"It is wrong to give in to a
threat," he wrote. "It is equally
wrong, however, to alter a decision
in order to avoid the appearance of
yielding to a threat. ... My duty in
this case is to call it as I see it."
Asked yesterday whether he felt
that reinstating Mosher would have
affected U.S.-Chinese cultural ex
changes, Kennedy said, "I doubt
it,"and noted once again that the
issue had no influence on his deci
sion.
The Mosher case has received
wide press coverage in the past five
years, largely because it has raised
issues involving academic freedom.
Mosher has published two books
based on his experiences in China
— "Broken Earth" and "Journey to
the Forbidden China" — and said
he recently finished a novel. Ac
cording to The Washington Post,
his report about forced abortions
and infanticide in China helped force
a cutoff of U.S. funds to some U.N.
population programs.
Mosher called Kennedy's final
decision "a blow against academic
freedom," but Kennedy, asked

whether he agreed, said,
"Absolutely not."
Mosher said the University
pretends to encourage academic
freedom, but that in reality, "You
are only free to publish that which
senior professors approve."
He said that several graduate
students and untenured faculty
members here have written him to
say that they, too, believe there is
"academic unfreedom" at Stanford.
Kennedy's letter focused on re
sponsibilities of the Stanford stu
dent rather than the degree of aca
demic freedom allowed at the Uni
versity.
"It is my view, as it was the
(Anthropology) Department's, that
the doctoral degree constitutes the
academic license to practice the
craft of scholarship and teaching,"
the letter said. "In anthropology,
interaction with human subjects is a
major component of the profes
sional role; there is an extremely
high responsibility for the welfare of
those being studied; there is a criti
cal need for fair and objective
reporting of events, including the
behavior of the investigator, since a
significant part of the researcher's
results cannot be replicated by
others.
"You have destroyed the confi
dence of those of us at Stanford
with whom you have dealt that you
can fulfill these requirements — not
only by strongly persuasive
evidence, but, in my view, beyond
a reasonable doubt.
"The department could not, un
der the circumstances, justify per
mitting you to continue in a pro
gram leading to that degree at this
University. Nor can I."
Steven Mosher, the former an
thropology doctoral student who
was expelled in 1983, has lost his
final appeal to University President
Donald Kennedy, who accused him
of deliberately lying during Stan
ford's investigations into his activi
ties.
In a 40-page letter to Mosher,
Kennedy painted the picture of an
opportunistic, manipulative and
deceitful man who abused the Uni
versity's student-faculty relation
ship and showed deliberate disre
gard for research subjects in China.
Kennedy said in his letter that
Mosher's "lack of candor" has
"eroded the trust and confidence
necessary to graduate education."
In addition to his statements about
Mosher's character, Kennedy cited
in the letter several incidents
during the investigation in which he
said Mosher withheld significant in
formation, gave conflicting versions
or was purposely misleading.
Mosher, 37, was dismissed by a

unanimous vote of the Anthropol
ogy Department Faculty on Feb. 24,
1983, for "illegal and seriously un
ethical conduct" while in China in
1979 and 1980.
The charges against him are said
to include smuggling, bribing
Chinese officials to obtain govern
ment documents and venturing into
territory closed to foreigners.
Mosher has denied these charges
and said repeatedly that the Univer
sity expelled him because he wrote
an article condemning Chinese
birth-control policies. The article,
accompanied by photographs of
naked women awaiting abortions in
their eighth month of pregnancy,
was published in a Taiwanese mag
azine.
Mosher said yesterday that he
feels "terribly wronged" by the
University's final decision, which is
the third confirmation of the original
1983 verdict. He added that he
plans to challenge Stanford in court.
Saying he never lied and was
indeed candid throughout the inves
tigation, Mosher called Kennedy's
letter "an attempt at character as
sassination." He said Kennedy used

an "attack on my personal
credibility" so that "by a leap of
faith, people would believe all the
charges against me are true. In
fact, all the charges are false.
"If you can't prove the allega
tions, you try to discredit the per
son," he said.
Kennedy, in response to
Mosher's comments, said his 40-
page letter "speaks for itself."
The letter, which includes a
detailed chronology of Mosher's
statements and letters on several
specific issues, underscores many
inconsistencies in the doctoral stu
dent's reports. Mosher is accused,
for example, of lying to Kennedy
about the authorship of a sales
receipt for a camera purchased for
field research in China in 1980.
According to Kennedy's letter,
Mosher "submitted a false receipt"
for the camera, gave conflicting
reports on its ownership and date of
purchase, and failed to provide the
University with the camera,
"despite the facts that you say you
have it, that it might substantiate
your story and that at least one
timp von acknowledged that it

belongs to the Department of An
thropology. " »
Mosher said yesterday that he
never lied when discussing the
camera during the investigation,
and that it was "not fair" for the
University to require him to
produce it because it was rightfully
his.
Kennedy's letter said also that
Mosher told conflicting stories
about a research assistant from
Hong Kong, about customs inspec
tion and about whether a van used
in China "was to be used as an
inducement for cooperation or
donated to the (villagers) as 'a gift
of the heart.' "
Mosher yesterday played those
accusations off as "half-truths at
best."
In addition, Mosher denied
charges that he abused the relation
ship between graduate students
and advisers, saying instead that
"the anthropology faculty abused
the trust between advisers and
graduate students."
Kennedy's letter said that


Art Streiber/Daily file
Former anthropology doctoral student Steven Mosher appealed
to the University a final time, and lost. He received an extensive
letter from University President Donald Kennedy berating him
for his unethical conduct in China.
Mosher "abused those relationships
by submitting (as a dissertation) a
popular ethnography of China in
stead of a scholarly demographic
study of Taiwan." Also, the letter
said Mosher is at fault for not in
forming Stanford about his arrest in
China until directly asked.
Mosher said yesterday that his
failure to inform the University of
his arrest — which he has never
denied — was a case of omission
rather than commission, and thus
was not a "punishable offense."
Mosher noted that Kennedy's
letter cleared him of "all the allega
tions of my original spouse,"
Maggie So, who has testified
against him.
Kennedy said in the letter that "it
is difficult for me personally to ac
cept her story as a whole as estab
lished by 'strongly persuasive
evidence,' or to be sufficiently cer
tain of which parts are correct." He
also said that Mosher could have al
tered the outcome of the case
during the original investigation had
he come forward with specific
refutations of So's statements, but
said Mosher was not "forthcoming"
at the time.
An appendix to Kennedy's letter
includes new details from a lengthy
report on So's allegations, including
one that she stood watch while
Mosher tried to break into a docu
ments room in China. The appendix
notes that Mosher denied the
charge.
Mosher contends that China
pressured Kennedy to uphold the
expulsion ruling by issuing a warn

ing last year that future cultural and
educational exchanges between the
United States and China might be
endangered if Mosher were read
mitted.
"Anyone over the age of three
knows the political consequences of
the decision were weighed in the
context of this pressure," Mosher
said.
Kennedy acknowledged in his
letter that Wang Ping of the
Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences did make this threat, but
said it had no influence on his deci
sion.
"It is wrong to give in to a
threat," he wrote. "It is equally

Mosher yesterday played those

best."
In addition, Mosher denied
charges that he abused the relation

and advisers, saying instead that
"the anthropology faculty abused
the trust between advisers and
graduate students."

Former anthropology doctoral student Steven Mosher appealed
to the University a final time, and lost. He received an extensive
letter from University President Donald Kennedy berating him
for his unethical conduct in China.
Mosher "abused those relationships
by submitting (as a dissertation) a
popular ethnography of China in
stead of a scholarly demographic
study of Taiwan." Also, the letter
said Mosher is at fault for not in
forming Stanford about his arrest in
China until directly asked.
Mosher said yesterday that his
failure to inform the University of
his arrest — which he has never
denied — was a case of omission
rather than commission, and thus
was not a "punishable offense."
Mosher noted that Kennedy's
letter cleared him of "all the allega
tions of my original spouse,"
Maggie So, who has testified
against him.
Kennedy said in the letter that "it
is difficult for me personally to ac
cept her story as a whole as estab
lished by 'strongly persuasive
evidence,' or to be sufficiently cer
tain of which parts are correct." He
also said that Mosher could have al
tered the outcome of the case
during the original investigation had
he come forward with specific
refutations of So's statements, but
said Mosher was not "forthcoming"
at the time.
An appendix to Kennedy's letter
includes new details from a lengthy
report on So's allegations, including
one that she stood watch while
Mosher tried to break into a docu
ments room in China. The appendix
notes that Mosher denied the
charge.
Mosher contends that China
pressured Kennedy to uphold the
expulsion ruling by issuing a warn

ing last year that future cultural and
educational exchanges between the
United States and China might be
endangered if Mosher were read
mitted.
"Anyone over the age of three
knows the political consequences of
the decision were weighed in the
context of this pressure," Mosher
said.
Kennedy acknowledged in his
letter that Wang Ping of the
Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences did make this threat, but
said it had no influence on his deci
sion.
"It is wrong to give in to a
threat," he wrote. "It is equally
wrong, however, to alter a decision
in order to avoid the appearance of
yielding to a threat. ... My duty in
this case is to call it as I see it."
Asked yesterday whether he felt
that reinstating Mosher would have
affected U.S.-Chinese cultural ex
changes, Kennedy said, "I doubt
it,"and noted once again that the
issue had no influence on his deci
sion.
The Mosher case has received
wide press coverage in the past five
years, largely because it has raised
issues involving academic freedom.
Mosher has published two books
based on his experiences in China
— "Broken Earth" and "Journey to
the Forbidden China" — and said
he recently finished a novel. Ac
cording to The Washington Post,
his report about forced abortions
and infanticide in China helped force
a cutoff of U.S. funds to some U.N.
population programs.
Mosher called Kennedy's final
decision "a blow against academic
freedom," but Kennedy, asked

whether he agreed, said,
"Absolutely not."
Mosher said the University
pretends to encourage academic
freedom, but that in reality, "You
are only free to publish that which
senior professors approve."
He said that several graduate
students and untenured faculty
members here have written him to
say that they, too, believe there is
"academic unfreedom" at Stanford.
Kennedy's letter focused on re
sponsibilities of the Stanford stu
dent rather than the degree of aca
demic freedom allowed at the Uni
versity.
"It is my view, as it was the
(Anthropology) Department's, that
the doctoral degree constitutes the
academic license to practice the
craft of scholarship and teaching,"
the letter said. "In anthropology,
interaction with human subjects is a
major component of the profes
sional role; there is an extremely
high responsibility for the welfare of
those being studied; there is a criti
cal need for fair and objective
reporting of events, including the
behavior of the investigator, since a
significant part of the researcher's
results cannot be replicated by
others.
"You have destroyed the confi
dence of those of us at Stanford
with whom you have dealt that you
can fulfill these requirements — not
only by strongly persuasive
evidence, but, in my view, beyond
a reasonable doubt.
"The department could not, un
der the circumstances, justify per
mitting you to continue in a pro
gram leading to that degree at this
University. Nor can I."
