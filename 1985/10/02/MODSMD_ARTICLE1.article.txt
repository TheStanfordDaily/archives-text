# Mosher Loses in His Last Appeal
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
Steven Mosher, the former an
thropology doctoral student who
was expelled in 1983, has lost his
final appeal to University President
Donald Kennedy, who accused him
of deliberately lying during Stan
ford's investigations into his activi
ties.
In a 40-page letter to Mosher,
Kennedy painted the picture of an
opportunistic, manipulative and
deceitful man who abused the Uni
versity's student-faculty relation
ship and showed deliberate disre
gard for research subjects in China.
Kennedy said in his letter that
Mosher's "lack of candor" has
"eroded the trust and confidence
necessary to graduate education."
In addition to his statements about
Mosher's character, Kennedy cited
in the letter several incidents
during the investigation in which he
said Mosher withheld significant in
formation, gave conflicting versions
or was purposely misleading.
Mosher, 37, was dismissed by a

unanimous vote of the Anthropol
ogy Department Faculty on Feb. 24,
1983, for "illegal and seriously un
ethical conduct" while in China in
1979 and 1980.
The charges against him are said
to include smuggling, bribing
Chinese officials to obtain govern
ment documents and venturing into
territory closed to foreigners.
Mosher has denied these charges
and said repeatedly that the Univer
sity expelled him because he wrote
an article condemning Chinese
birth-control policies. The article,
accompanied by photographs of
naked women awaiting abortions in
their eighth month of pregnancy,
was published in a Taiwanese mag
azine.
Mosher said yesterday that he
feels "terribly wronged" by the
University's final decision, which is
the third confirmation of the original
1983 verdict. He added that he
plans to challenge Stanford in court.
Saying he never lied and was
indeed candid throughout the inves
tigation, Mosher called Kennedy's
letter "an attempt at character as
sassination." He said Kennedy used

an "attack on my personal
credibility" so that "by a leap of
faith, people would believe all the
charges against me are true. In
fact, all the charges are false.
"If you can't prove the allega
tions, you try to discredit the per
son," he said.
Kennedy, in response to
Mosher's comments, said his 40-
page letter "speaks for itself."
The letter, which includes a
detailed chronology of Mosher's
statements and letters on several
specific issues, underscores many
inconsistencies in the doctoral stu
dent's reports. Mosher is accused,
for example, of lying to Kennedy
about the authorship of a sales
receipt for a camera purchased for
field research in China in 1980.
According to Kennedy's letter,
Mosher "submitted a false receipt"
for the camera, gave conflicting
reports on its ownership and date of
purchase, and failed to provide the
University with the camera,
"despite the facts that you say you
have it, that it might substantiate
your story and that at least one
timp von acknowledged that it

belongs to the Department of An
thropology. " Â»
Mosher said yesterday that he
never lied when discussing the
camera during the investigation,
and that it was "not fair" for the
University to require him to
produce it because it was rightfully
his.
Kennedy's letter said also that
Mosher told conflicting stories
about a research assistant from
Hong Kong, about customs inspec
tion and about whether a van used
in China "was to be used as an
inducement for cooperation or
donated to the (villagers) as 'a gift
of the heart.' "
Mosher yesterday played those
accusations off as "half-truths at
best."
In addition, Mosher denied
charges that he abused the relation
ship between graduate students
and advisers, saying instead that
"the anthropology faculty abused
the trust between advisers and
graduate students."
Kennedy's letter said that

for his unethical conduct in China.
