That it is wrong for students to cheat, to place
greater importance on their grades than their in
tegrity is hardly a great revelation. Not only does
cheating violate the basic principles of the Univer
sity, but it also discredits honest students and does
great harm to Stanford's image as a leader in higher
education.
But in the case of the 23 students who allegedly
cheated in last spring's Introductory Psychology
class, Prof. Philip Zimbardo and the TAs
must share the blame for the incidents that have
brought about the single largest investigation of Uni
versity Honor Code violations in Stanford history.
Nothing can excuse cheating, but the conditions in
which the tests in the 744-member psychology class
were taken were hardly conducive to the atmos
phere of honest, thoughtful concentration which the
Honor Code requires.
The Honor Code forbids students to receive
"unpermitted aid," but it also specifies "The faculty
will . . . avoid, as far as practicable, academic pro
cedures that create temptations to violate the
Honor Code." Furthermore, the Honor Code stip
ulates: "the students and faculty will work together
to establish optimal conditions for honorable aca
demic woik."
The Psych. 1 tests — the weekly, multiple
choice exams taken on computer-scored Scantron
answer cards — on which students supposedly

cheated were taken in hectic, confusing and noisy
conditions. Students were allowed to start the tests
before the class period officially started. Those who
chose not to take the tests on the lawn outside
Kresge Auditorium or in a room in the Law School
often had to sit directly next to someone else taking
the test. Students finishing early deposited their an
swer cards in a box on the stage, brushing by those
still trying to concentrate, and then many of those
who finished early began talking, until general
anarchy prevailed.
Furthermore, the fact that the professor and
the TAs were often visible within or outside the
auditorium might have given students reason to
suspect that the faculty was not upholding its end of
the Honor Code.
Cheating is easily the most heinous school-related
offense a student can commit, but students can do
without the temptations that close-quartered,
multiple-choice tests and chaotic test conditions
present.
The damage done by the cheating allegations
went far beyond the boundaries of Stanford. An arti
cle appearing last week in The New York Times re
ported the incident to the world, a service that can
scarcely bolster Stanford's image. Cheating has far
reaching consequences for everyone, the cheaters
and the innocent alike. Perhaps a good long look at
the Honor Code and its importance is in order for all
— students and professors.
