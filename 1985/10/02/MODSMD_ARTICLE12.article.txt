## The
						Larger Implications of Cheating: Honor, Image and Penalty 
### 
Some Stanford students cheated
on exams in my introductory psy
chology course last spring — some
of them got caught, and some did
not. Apparently many students who
did not cheat knew that others
were cheating. However, they kept
this knowledge to themselves or
shared their anger and resentment
about this violation of their Honor
Code with friends, but not with me
or any University official respon
sible for helping to maintain the in
tegrity of this code of student
honor. Their informed passivity
makes them as guilty of violating
the code as those who actively
sought to improve their grades by
giving or receiving unpermitted aid
during examinations.

VIEWPOINT

It is well for us all to be reminded
that the Honor Code is not a set of
coercive laws promulgated by fac
ulty to keep students in tow, but
rather, the guidelines developed
largely by students (and codified in
1977) to govern their own conduct,
as is fitting and proper in a commu
nity of young scholars. Students are
expected and invited to work to
gether with their faculty "to estab
lish optimal conditions for honorable
academic work." In doing so, they
are upholding the Fundamental
Standard of showing "respect
for order, morality, per
sonal honor and the rights of others
as is demanded of good citizens."
The goal of our Honor Code then is
to create an atmosphere of mutual
trust in which it becomes the col
lective desire of all members of the
Stanford academic community to
prevent and deter potential viola
tions, instead of setting up a hostile
police state in which faculty and stu
dent interests are at odds.
However, when a student chooses
to violate this basic tenet of trust by
cheating on examinations, by acts
of plagiarism or fabrication of data,
then it is the obligation of students
to inform the appropriate faculty
member — and for that professor
to act responsibly in dealing with
suspected violations.
There is reason to believe that
the time has come for this commu
nity to reconfirm its commitment to
the Fundamental Standard and to
its Honor Code. It is not merely be
cause two dozen students are
accused of cheating on psychology
exams, but also because of reac
tions by a number of students to the
revelation of this cheating. The
local press (which has been quick to
report this tarnish to Stanford's
reputation) has carried quotes at
tributed to our students to the ef
fect that cheating is no big deal:
"Everybody does it"; "People said I
should take the course because
everyone cheats"; "It's not a crime
against society, it's just a sign of
someone who's desperate"; and so
forth. Moreover, students have re

ported to me that I should be
consoled by the fact that cheating
occurs in lots of their large courses
and not just in mine, while others of
them have argued that it is simply a
matter of "cutting corners," a cost
efficient way of coping with a heavy
schedule with too many demands
put upon over-burdened students.
Equally distressing to me is the
anonymous report called in on my
answering machine by a student
who alleged to have witnessed and
reported several infractions of the
the Honor Code in various classes
— only to have the teacher or the
graduate teaching assistant in
charge ignore or minimize their
seriousness.
Why cheat?
We can understand (which is not
the same as sanction) the cheating
of an individual student as an im
pulsive act of desperation when
faced with a possible poor grade
that might have dire consequences.
Others may cheat by giving
answers to their entreating friends
because they believe the bonds of
friendship would be strained by
refusing to cooperate. It becomes
easier to cheat, and to engage in
any anti-social act, when an individ
ual has not internalized the norms
of the social community, feels
above them, perceives there is
little social sanction against doing
so, low probability of getting
caught, minimal penalties and fi
nally, can generate adequate self
justification for the deed. When an
individual breaks a law, we posit
dispositional attributions to account
for his or her fall from grace,
searching for some defect in the
person's makeup. But when a col
lection of individuals violates the
same law, another perspective is
called into action, that of the situa
tional analysis of "evil." This situa
tional attribution entails the attempt
to specify a set of current circum
stances or forces that cause, deter
mine or increase the probability of
the behavior in question. In the
case of cheating under considera
tion there are two classes of pos
sibly significant situational factors,
those particular to my class setting
and those which are more systemic
to Stanford's current academic
climate.
My class was much too big, with
over 750 students in attendance in
any given period in a room with only
580 seats. I chose to teach it in
Kresge Auditorium because it is the
least objectionable of the large
lecture arenas at Stanford (shortest
distance between teacher and stu
dents, no orchestra pit, good light
ing and more), but it is still not an
optimal teaching environment. The
teacher is still cast as a distant per
former playing to students in the
role of passive audience. My at
tempts to reduce the anonymity of
the setting apparently were inef
fective. Multiple-choice exams
scored by machine and purely ob

jective, computer-based grading on
a statistical curve were the only
practical way to deal with such an
enormous class, especially when I
had available to me only one
graduate assistant (albeit an out
standing one in Mary Parpal) and
one undergraduate TA (Rose
McDermott) to process all the
weekly and course grading. But
such a testing-grading system on
such a large scale helped to
engender an ecology of anonymity,
with its loss of a sense of in
dividuality and the attendant
suppression of individual concerns
for social evaluation and self
monitoring. It is ironic that I have
studied and created in the labora
tory comparable subjective states
of "de-individuation" and reported
on their often anti-social conse
quences among people who are ba
sically good and decent to begin
with. Indeed, that was one of the
guiding principles in the design of
our infamous Stanford Prison Ex
periment of 1971.
Although my class was one of
Stanford's largest, there are many
others in the University that are too
large for there to be genuine
student-faculty interaction in class
or the likelihood of personal contact
outside of class. While the lack of
graduate TA's in my class was ex
treme, there have never been
enough assistants for any of our
popular undergraduate courses to
offer the more personalized instruc
tion that small sections of large
lectures ought to provide and our
students request, deserve and pay
for.
But more fundamental to the
problem of academic dishonesty are
the insidious pressures upon stu
dents because of the undue empha
sis put upon course grades as the
supposedly objective yardstick of a
student's worth and as the key to
the magic kingdoms of post
graduate training. These pressures
are compounded in our unrelenting
quarter system in which I and other
faculty typically give the same
amount of reading as students are
given in semester-long systems
which have six more weeks. And
then there is the matter of the high
caliber of the all-star competition
any student here is up against,
coupled with the ethos of playing it
all realy cool, "what ME worry? No
sweat, laid-back, hassle-free, avoid
looking like a nerd who studies
hard." For some students, cheating
may be more a matter of survival
than a moral decision. But it is a
moral matter. So maybe we need to
alter the conditions or perception of
survival-at-all-costs-at-Stanford.
Why not cheat?
In the recent Junior Convocation,
a former Stanford undergraduate,
Class of '65, talked about his loved
of playing with ideas and his pas
sion for discovering how things
were related. This tinkering with
knowledge sometimes got in the

way of working for grades, and he
flunked a course and ended his
career here with a G.P.A. of less
than 3.0! But intellectual passion
perservered and Douglas Hofstad
ter has gone on to become one of
the most profound and original
thinkers of our time, as many of you
know who have read his first book,
"Godel, Escher and Bach," or know
him as the holder of a distinguished
chair in computer science and psy
chology at the University of Michi
gan.
A student who cheats to get bet
ter grades is being cheated by a
system that makes getting some
body else's answers more impor
tant than getting one's own ideas. A
goal of any liberal arts education
should be to discover how to trans
form the high school student's
quest for the perfect 4.0 into the
scholar's search for knowledge that
is guided by intellectual passion,
regardless of the imperfections in
the process.
The same temptations to cheat
exist for faculty as for students,
only not on exams, but in other
forms of academic dishonesty such
as plagiarism or falsification of em
pirical data. Pressures to publish or
not get tenure, the need to get and
maintain grant support for research
and a research staff and desire for
career advancement are not incon
siderable. Nevertheless, the aca
demic and research communities al
low no deviation from the ideal of
absolute honesty. Extenuating cir
cumstances make us feel sorry for
the professor who acts dishonestly,
but he or she suffers a loss of trust
by colleagues in the integrity of any
data subsequently generated.
Likewise, students who cheat on a
little exam may be more likely to do
so later in life when the stakes are
much higher, so they become
people we cannot trust in positions
of responsibility. Does having
cheated and gotten away with the
dishonesty by not getting caught
make it more likely that this rein
forced dishonest behavior is likely
to recur when similar pressures are
brought to bear on the "cheater" in
future situations? I believe so; as
far as I know there is no evidence
to suggest otherwise. That
becomes another reason why not to
cheat even with "good" reasons on
small quizzes.
In the case under consideration,
the cheating was more systematic
and planned by small cliques of stu
dents who are representative of a
wide range of the student body in
terms of class, sex, residence,
major and athletic participation.
They (you) did something very
serious regardless of attempts to
downplay the seriousness and up
play its normative quality
("everybody cheats"). Recast in
terms that may not be too strong to
illustrate the importance this com
munity puts upon academic
honesty, to cheat is to rape the

Honor Code of its dignity. There is
no such thing as a little rape, nor
can cheating ever be insignificant.
We must be morally outraged by
both acts and commit ourselves in
dividually and collectively to do all
we can to prevent and deter them,
yet prosecute violations whenever
they occur.
The cheating in my class has had
the negative consequence of
causing those involved to spend
literally hundreds of hours in un
necessary "detective work" so that
some students could save a few
hours of extra studying, which
would have made cheating on my
quizzes irrelevant. The institutional
image has suffered, honest stu
dents are cast with the dishonest,
anonymous "Stanford student
cheaters" by outside observers and
honestly earned grades are
demeaned along the way.
Conclusions
1. Sally Cole and her staff on the
Student Judicial Affairs Board are to
be commended for their vigorous
and sensitive handling of this unfor
tunate situation.
2. Guilty students will be
penalized by loss of course credit
and receive suspensions of varying
lengths of duration according to the
nature of their cheating, but per
haps community service should be
added as part of our concern for the
"rehabilitation" of these students.
3. Peer support for academic dis-

honesty must give way to a reaf
firmation of the importance of aca
demic integrity. Students may do
well to discuss this issue of how to
discourage cheating, as part of their
residential education programs.
4. Faculty need to re-acquaint
themselves with the procedures for
establishing appropriate testing
grading situations and for the en
forcement of the Honor Code.
5. Alternatives to large lecture
classes should be pursued, and ade
quate funds provided for more
teaching assistants where such
classes cannot be avoided. Per
sonally, this means reducing my
large class to a more manageable
size, at least by half, taught in
smaller, less formal rooms, with a
TA for every 40 students beyond
the 501 am willing to teach unaided.
6. The Stanford community at
large might reflect on the tyranny of
grades which drives so many to
acts of dishonesty and others to
acts of desperation. Are we no
more than a pre-professional train
ing program? If we are, then some
one should remind our students
that after graduation no one ever
will ask them what their G.P.A was
— it is one of the world's best kept
secrets. What matters is that they
were educated at a place like Stan
ford University which upholds the
highest ideals of academic integrity.
