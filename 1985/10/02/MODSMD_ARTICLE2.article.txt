# Firms Eye Law School Boycott
## Policy permitting homosexual discrimination among employers panned 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
A Law School policy that permits employers who
discriminate against homosexuals to recruit students
there has sparked protest from law students and the
threat of a nationwide boycott of the Law School's
placement office by public-service law firms.
Jose Gomez, executive director of La Raza Centro
Legal, Inc., a community law center in San Francisco,
said his firm will boycott the Law School's placement
office this year and will encourage other public
service law firms to do the same if the school does not
alter its policy soon.
The policy, which requires recruiters who dis
criminate against homosexuals to sign documents de
scribing their positions, is aimed primarily at the

Central Intelligence Agency and the Army, both of
which refuse to hire homosexuals, according to Assoc.
Law School Dean Jack Friedenthal.
The Army, which will recruit at the Law School later
this month, is expected to become the first employer
to sign the document.
Friedenthal defended the policy yesterday, saying it
could force into the open employers who choose to dis
criminate against homosexuals. It also sidesteps gov
ernment threats to withhold federal research funds
from schools that prohibit the CIA and the Army from
recruiting at their placement centers.
But Mark Dupont, co-president of the Gay and
Lesbian Law Students Association, said that while he
does not believe the government would go through
with threats to withdraw research funds, the Univer
sity should be willing to accept that fate.

"I wasn't aware that there was a price tag on civil
rights," he said. "If we really believe that people have
rights, we shouldn't let the cost of enforcing those
rights scare us away from enforcing them."
Dupont isn't alone in criticizing Stanford's policy.
The Bay Area Lawyers for Individual Freedom
(BALIF), a group of about 400 gay and lesbian lawyers,
has condemned the policy, as have the San Francisco
public defender and Legal Assistance for the Elderly,
Gomez said.
Law students have also argued against the policy,
and they will discuss their concerns with administra
tors at a Law School forum Friday afternoon. Frieden
thal said the law faculty also will meet to discuss the
policy later this month, and could propose changes to
