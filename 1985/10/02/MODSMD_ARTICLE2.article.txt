# Firms Eye Law School Boycott
## Policy permitting homosexual discrimination among employers panned 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
A Law School policy that permits employers who
discriminate against homosexuals to recruit students
there has sparked protest from law students and the
threat of a nationwide boycott of the Law School's
placement office by public-service law firms.
Jose Gomez, executive director of La Raza Centro
Legal, Inc., a community law center in San Francisco,
said his firm will boycott the Law School's placement
office this year and will encourage other public
service law firms to do the same if the school does not
alter its policy soon.
The policy, which requires recruiters who dis
criminate against homosexuals to sign documents de
scribing their positions, is aimed primarily at the

Central Intelligence Agency and the Army, both of
which refuse to hire homosexuals, according to Assoc.
Law School Dean Jack Friedenthal.
The Army, which will recruit at the Law School later
this month, is expected to become the first employer
to sign the document.
Friedenthal defended the policy yesterday, saying it
could force into the open employers who choose to dis
criminate against homosexuals. It also sidesteps gov
ernment threats to withhold federal research funds
from schools that prohibit the CIA and the Army from
recruiting at their placement centers.
But Mark Dupont, co-president of the Gay and
Lesbian Law Students Association, said that while he
does not believe the government would go through
with threats to withdraw research funds, the Univer
sity should be willing to accept that fate.

"I wasn't aware that there was a price tag on civil
rights," he said. "If we really believe that people have
rights, we shouldn't let the cost of enforcing those
rights scare us away from enforcing them."
Dupont isn't alone in criticizing Stanford's policy.
The Bay Area Lawyers for Individual Freedom
(BALIF), a group of about 400 gay and lesbian lawyers,
has condemned the policy, as have the San Francisco
public defender and Legal Assistance for the Elderly,
Gomez said.
Law students have also argued against the policy,
and they will discuss their concerns with administra
tors at a Law School forum Friday afternoon. Frieden
thal said the law faculty also will meet to discuss the
policy later this month, and could propose changes to
administrators.
Any change in the policy would
have to be approved by the Univer
sity president, Friedenthal said.
Gomez said the continuation of
the current policy "would be very,
very bad for Stanford."
"It would give Stanford Law
School a very bad reputation," he
said. "It would make it appear to be
a very conservative school not con
cerned with social justice, and
that's a very negative image for a
law school to have."
Gomez said his firm will stop
using the Law School's placement
office because "we, as a public as
sistance organization, cannot col
laborate with bigotry."

Paul Wotman, a member of
BALIF's board of directors, said his
organization will support "any and
all actions that are appropriate" —
including a national boycott of the
placement center — to combat the
Law School's policy.
Friedenthal said the threat of a
boycott will not change the Law
School's policy, but that student
opinion has prompted the faculty to
review the policy.
Several universities prohibit all
forms of sexual discrimination in
hiring practices, while others make
exceptions for the CIA and the
Army because their discrimination
is mandated by Defense Depart
ment policy.
Friedenthal said Stanford's policy
is better than an all-out ban on dis
criminatory recruiters because it
forces those who discriminate to

admit their policies and "face the
heat." When a discriminatory em
ployer comes to Stanford, students
and faculty can focus their attention
on that employer and its practices,
and perhaps arrange their own
boycott, he said.
With an all-out ban, open dis
criminators go un-noticed because
they never appear, he said. Dis
criminators who hide their practices
succeed in either system, he said,
but would suffer penalties if discov
ered under the current system.
Dupont said the Graduate School
of Business this summer adopted
an all-out ban on employers who
discriminate against homosexuals,
but that the move has been called
into question because it was not ap
proved by University President
Donald Kennedy.

Law School's policy.
Friedenthal said the threat of a
boycott will not change the Law
School's policy, but that student
opinion has prompted the faculty to
review the policy.
Several universities prohibit all
forms of sexual discrimination in
hiring practices, while others make
exceptions for the CIA and the
Army because their discrimination
is mandated by Defense Depart
ment policy.
Friedenthal said Stanford's policy
is better than an all-out ban on dis
criminatory recruiters because it
forces those who discriminate to

admit their policies and "face the
heat." When a discriminatory em
ployer comes to Stanford, students
and faculty can focus their attention
on that employer and its practices,
and perhaps arrange their own
boycott, he said.
With an all-out ban, open dis
criminators go un-noticed because
they never appear, he said. Dis
criminators who hide their practices
succeed in either system, he said,
but would suffer penalties if discov
ered under the current system.
Dupont said the Graduate School
of Business this summer adopted
an all-out ban on employers who
discriminate against homosexuals,
but that the move has been called
into question because it was not ap
proved by University President
Donald Kennedy.
