## SUNSTAR System Simulates Shuttle Flights 
### PAT LIN Editorial staff 
Engineers at Stanford's
SUNSTAR facility are attempting
to develop a powerful computer
animation and graphics system
which may have broad impact on
future space missions as well as
many fields in engineering, science
and medicine.
SUNSTAR stands for Stanford
University Network for Space
Telescience Applications Research.
Located in Durand Building, it is
Stanford's version of NASA's
Johnson Space Center and Marshall
Space Flight Center.
In July 1985 SUNSTAR made
history by becoming the first non-
NASA facility to monitor a space
shuttle mission. This was made
possible by computer links between
Marshall, Johnson and SUNSTAR.
Mike Wiskerchen, director of
SUNSTAR, said that a principle
goal of the facility is to develop the
technology for "telescience," or the
ability to conduct scientific opera
tions from remote areas. For an in
stitution like Stanford, which is in
volved in numerous space shuttle
experiments, the capability to con
trol space missions from the
campus rather than Houston would

be very beneficial to the scientists
involved.
To Wiskerchen and his as
sociates, the concept of tele science
means more than just developing
the engineering know-how for
operating a facility like SUNSTAR.
Tele science also means being able
to simulate events in space.
SUNSTAR personnel are cur
rently involved in putting together
an ambitious computer animation
and graphics system that will do
just that. If successful, it would one
day permit scientists to use anima
tion to recreate the maneuvers and
experiments of the space shuttle. It
would enable ground crew to
visualize those activities from any
perspective. And, most amazingly,
it would allow people to see events
as they actually happen in space.
In effect, the animation system is
aimed at putting people on the
ground into space with the
astronauts.
The hardware for the animation
system at SUNSTAR is composed
of three state-of-the-art pieces of
equipment: an Evans and Suther
land PS3OO, a Silicon Graphics IRIS
system and a Bosch FTS 4000.
Wiskerchen and his co-workers are
attempting to merge the functions
of these machines and thus greatly
expand their ability to produce
animated films.

The Evans and Sutherland is
widely used in industry for
computer-aided design and
manufacture (CAD/CAM). Accord
ing to Wiskerchen, the Evans and
Sutherland is what Rockwell uses
to design space shuttles, what
Lockheed uses to build aircraft and
what General Motors uses to make
cars. The Evans and Sutherland
makes it possible for engineers to
visualize what they are creating as
they design it. In addition, they can
use the Evans and Sutherland to
store in computer memory a com
plete model of an aircraft or auto
mobile, down to every last nut and
bolt.
The IRIS system is a "simulation
tool useful for developing robotic al
gorithms," said Wiskerchen. En
gineers can enter the specifications
for a robot into the IRIS and then
drive the computer model of the
robot with various programs. The
system makes it possible to operate
a robot model, test different artifi
cial intelligence and robotic pro
grams and visualize the perfor
mance on a video screen, all with
out having to build an actual robot.
The Bosch FTS 4000 is designed
specifically for computer animation,
and it will be the heart of Wisker
chen's animation scheme. The
