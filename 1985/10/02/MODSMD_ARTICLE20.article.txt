## SUNSTAR System Simulates Shuttle Flights 
### PAT LIN Editorial staff 
Engineers at Stanford's
SUNSTAR facility are attempting
to develop a powerful computer
animation and graphics system
which may have broad impact on
future space missions as well as
many fields in engineering, science
and medicine.
SUNSTAR stands for Stanford
University Network for Space
Telescience Applications Research.
Located in Durand Building, it is
Stanford's version of NASA's
Johnson Space Center and Marshall
Space Flight Center.
In July 1985 SUNSTAR made
history by becoming the first non-
NASA facility to monitor a space
shuttle mission. This was made
possible by computer links between
Marshall, Johnson and SUNSTAR.
Mike Wiskerchen, director of
SUNSTAR, said that a principle
goal of the facility is to develop the
technology for "telescience," or the
ability to conduct scientific opera
tions from remote areas. For an in
stitution like Stanford, which is in
volved in numerous space shuttle
experiments, the capability to con
trol space missions from the
campus rather than Houston would

be very beneficial to the scientists
involved.
To Wiskerchen and his as
sociates, the concept of tele science
means more than just developing
the engineering know-how for
operating a facility like SUNSTAR.
Tele science also means being able
to simulate events in space.
SUNSTAR personnel are cur
rently involved in putting together
an ambitious computer animation
and graphics system that will do
just that. If successful, it would one
day permit scientists to use anima
tion to recreate the maneuvers and
experiments of the space shuttle. It
would enable ground crew to
visualize those activities from any
perspective. And, most amazingly,
it would allow people to see events
as they actually happen in space.
In effect, the animation system is
aimed at putting people on the
ground into space with the
astronauts.
The hardware for the animation
system at SUNSTAR is composed
of three state-of-the-art pieces of
equipment: an Evans and Suther
land PS3OO, a Silicon Graphics IRIS
system and a Bosch FTS 4000.
Wiskerchen and his co-workers are
attempting to merge the functions
of these machines and thus greatly
expand their ability to produce
animated films.

The Evans and Sutherland is
widely used in industry for
computer-aided design and
manufacture (CAD/CAM). Accord
ing to Wiskerchen, the Evans and
Sutherland is what Rockwell uses
to design space shuttles, what
Lockheed uses to build aircraft and
what General Motors uses to make
cars. The Evans and Sutherland
makes it possible for engineers to
visualize what they are creating as
they design it. In addition, they can
use the Evans and Sutherland to
store in computer memory a com
plete model of an aircraft or auto
mobile, down to every last nut and
bolt.
The IRIS system is a "simulation
tool useful for developing robotic al
gorithms," said Wiskerchen. En
gineers can enter the specifications
for a robot into the IRIS and then
drive the computer model of the
robot with various programs. The
system makes it possible to operate
a robot model, test different artifi
cial intelligence and robotic pro
grams and visualize the perfor
mance on a video screen, all with
out having to build an actual robot.
The Bosch FTS 4000 is designed
specifically for computer animation,
and it will be the heart of Wisker
chen's animation scheme. The

SUNSTAR uses state-of-the-art computers to create animated films.
Bosch enables artists to draw
various figures and to animate
them. Objects can be rotated in
three dimensions, moved around
the screen and magnified or made
small. In addition, the device
computes how much a figure must
be moved in each frame of animated
film so that movements seem
smooth and natural.
Driven by a Motorola 68,000
computer, the Bosch system is
"one of the most sophisticated
graphics engines in existence
today," said Wiskerchen. The prob
lem with the Bosch, for Wisker
chen's purposes, is that it was "in
no way ever developed to be used
in engineering," he said.
Designed for commercial televi
sion, the Bosch relies on artists'
renditions of objects, which appear
very realistic, but are nevertheless
as flawed as any crude sketch from
an engineering standpoint.
SUNSTAR engineers are at
tempting to use the exact computer
models contained in the Evans and
Sutherland and the IRIS systems as
input to the Bosch animation sys
tem.
The task of connecting the Bosch
to the other two devices is a chal
lenging one, for the Bosch was built
to accept analog data — artists'
drawings — as opposed to the digi
tal electronic information in which

the Evans and Sutherland and the
IRIS store all their data.
According to Wiskerchen, en
gineers at SUNSTAR now have a
"basic understanding" of how to
transfer files from the Evans and
Sutherland and IRIS to the Bosch.
Moreover, said Wiskerchen, a
"bread board," or a working model
of the hardware needed to connect
the instruments, has been designed
and built. Thus, it is now possible to
animate an engineer's exact model
of a space shuttle on the Bosch sys
tem.
With a working animation system
at hand, what might engineers at
SUNSTAR be able to create with
it?
Imagine the following. On a TV
screen, against a backdrop of stars
and galaxies, is a familiar shot of the
earth, blue with swirling white
clouds and patchy brown land
masses. The space shuttle then
flies into view. It is an exact replica,
reproduced in every fine detail. The
shot zooms in on the shuttle, and a
view of the payload area is ex
panded to fill the screen.
Here an experiment is being con
ducted with an electron gun. Paral
lel lines suddenly appear on the
screen to depict the earth's mag
netic field. The gun discharges and
a volley of circles, representing
electrons, are seen spiraling away
along the lines of the magnetic field.
Imagine further that all of the
events are depicted in "real time."
That is, all of the maneuvers of the

shuttle are displayed at the moment
they occur, exactly as they occur.
Far from being an artist's interpre
tation of what might be happening in
space, the animated film is driven
by a constant stream of information
on the shuttle's position, speed, at
titude and activities.
At present, the ability to create
such animation is half reality and
half science-fiction. Some aspects
of the above scenario actually have
been achieved, but other aspects
await further technical innovations.
Indeed, it is possible to generate
images that look about as realistic
as photographs. The Bosch system
contains a number of features that
make this feasible.
For example, an "anti-aliasing"
function produces very sharp
images and takes the jaggedness
out of lines one is accustomed
to seeing on computer terminals.
Also, "smooth-shading" enables
one to create very detailed back
grounds, such as of the earth, by
mixing in information from
photographs and artists' drawings.
Electrons and lines of the earth's
magnetic field, which normally are
invisible, can be displayed on
screen along with visible objects.
The electron gun experiment des
cribed above actually was per
formed in July, and it has been sim
ulated by the animation system.
However, there are limitations to
the animation capabilities at pres
ent. Most notably, it is not yet pos
sible to produce very detailed

animated films in real time. Accord
ing to Wes Jenkins, assistant art
director of ITS, highly detailed
animation involving backgrounds of
galaxies and a life-like earth, may
require five minutes to generate a
single frame of film. Though faster
than "cell" or manual animation, it is
very slow considering the fact that
30 frames are needed for a single
second of animation.
The reason that so much time is
used in making each frame is that as
more details are put into each
picture, more information must be
stored and handled by the com
puters, explained Wiskerchen. By
eliminating a lot of artistic details
which are not strictly required for
scientific purposes, the whole
process could be speeded up
greatly.
According to Wiskerchen, a key
goal of the animation scheme is to
have a "dynamic system that can be
changed." For example, one ex
periment may require the robot
arm to be displayed in great detail
while everything else — the earth,
moon, stars — can be depicted in
very simplified ways, perhaps as
circles. Another experiment,
however, may require the earth to
be shown in great detail, and here
the shuttle could be represented in
mere outline.
Because many possible applica
tions exist for the SUNSTAR
animation package, it may well find
its most productive uses not in
space but right here on earth.
