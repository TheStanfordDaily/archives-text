## Strawberry's homer the difference Mets Close, Angels Take Lead 
### 
ST. LOUIS (AP) — Darryl Strawberry hit a
two-out home run in the 11th inning and Ron
Darling combined with Jesse Orosco on a four
hitter last night, keeping the New York Mets
alive in the National League East with dramatic
1-0 triumph over the St. Louis Cardinals.
Strawberry's 28th homer, which came after
reliever Ken Dayley struck out the first two bat
ters he faced, capped a game otherwise
dominated by Darling and St. Louis starter John
Tudor. Neither Darling nor Tudor, however, got
a decision.
The victory in the opener of the three-game
series pulled the Mets within two games of first
place St. Louis and kept the Cardinals' magic
number for clinching the division at four.
Tudor, who leads the major leagues with 10
shutouts, blanked the Mets for 10 innings on six

hits. Darling shut out New York on four hits for
nine innings.
Dayley, 4-4, replaced Tudor to start the 11th
and struck out Keith Hernandez and Gary
Carter. But Strawberry hit a 1-1 pitch into the
right-field bleachers for the game's only run.
A crowd of 46,026, the largest at Busch
Stadium since a June 30 game against New York,
watched the game on a brisk night.
The Mets had mounted scoring threats in the
seventh and again in the ninth, and both times
Tudor was equal to the challenge.
KANSAS CITY (AP) — Mike Witt had one
less day to think about an important start, and
now the California Angels have one less game to
win in their pursuit of the American League West
title.

The Angels regained a one-game lead over
Kansas City in the divison Tuesday night as Witt
pitched California to a 4-2 victory with one and
one-third innings of relief help from Donnie
Moore.
Witt originally was scheduled to pitch tonight's
game, but Angels Manager Gene Mauch changed
his rotation Monday to bring Witt back on three
days' rest.
Witt said the late switch didn't bother him. In
fact, it might have helped.
"I've done well on one day's notice before,"
Witt said. "It might have been to my advantage
because it gave me one less day to think about
it."
The Angels lost the first game of this four
game set, 3-1, to the Royals Monday night.

the offense, as in games past, was hardly alive and kicking. The
Cardinal has recorded only one goal in its last three games.

The Stanford defense, backed up by goalie Helen Norton, did
its job yesterday, limiting Santa Clara to two goals. However,
