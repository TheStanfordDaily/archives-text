# Broncos Burst Card's Bubble
## 
### ERIK STEN 
They say the best offense is a
good defense, but in the case of
Stanford's women's soccer team
that adage doesn't seem to be
enough. Last night at Santa Clara,
the Cardinal lost a heartbreaker 2-1
in overtime to the Broncos.
"We were under pressure most
of the game," senior goalkeeper
Helen Norton said. "We played
pretty well, but you just can't play
defense for 90 minutes of the game
and hope to win."
"One breakdown and it's over,"
she said.
Even though they found them
selves playing defense most of the
first half, the Cardinal took advan
tage of a Santa Clara mistake to
score first. The ball found its way
into the Santa Clara penalty box
where a Bronco hit it with her hand.
The Cardinal was awarded a
penalty kick. And taking advantage
of the gift, Stanford forward Sarah
MacPherson rocketed a shot into
llie coiner of the SanU Clara goal.
The game was only 12 minutes old
and the Cardinal was already up 1-
0.
With senior forward Jenny Fech
ner leading the attack, the Broncos
offense applied the pressure, but
the Stanford defense was firm.
Senior Cardinal defender Carol
Berryman rallied her teammates
and with the help of a spectacular
play by Norton, the Broncos were
held scoreless for the first half.
Norton's goal-saving effort came
with only two minutes left in the
half. Fechner lofted one of her let
hal kicks in front of the goal, and
Norton saw herself facing three
Broncos and a loose ball. Not bat
ting an eye, the Cardinal keeper

rose into the air and stole a
probable goal from three bewil
dered Broncos.
"The defense was where it
should be, but she just had a strong
leg and got it in there," Norton
said.
After the break, the missing
Cardinal offense seemed to revive a
little. The ball was on the Broncos'
side of the field, but no Cardinal
player seemed to be in the right
place to use her teammates' passes.
"We had crossing opportunities,
but no one to receive the cross,"
Stanford Coach Helen Keohane
said.
"It was pretty much back and
forth in the second half," Keohane
said. The teams traded shots until
the game's 52nd minute when a
Bronco forward broke loose and
scored a game-tying goal.
From that point on, the Cardinal
seemed to fire up. "The last 15
minutes were all us," said
Keohane. But that didn't make a
difference as the buzzer went off,
and the score was still deadlocked.
For the first four minutes of the
overtime period, the Cardinal
seemed to still be outplaying the
Broncos, yet there were no scoring
opportunities.
And then it was all over. At four
and-one-half minutes into the
overtime period, Santa Clara
scored on a capable, but tired,
Stanford defense. Sudden death it
was.
Looking to the future, Keohane
said that the experience with the
Broncos is just what the young
Stanford squad needs. The Cardinal
needs to try "experimenting with
which combinations will work the
best," Keohane said.
"Unfortunately, it's going to take
time."
