# Card Golf Travels Into a Setting Sun
## 
### JON WEISMAN 
Today, the Stanford men's golf team begins play
in the prestigious Japan-America Friendship Tourn
ament. The invitation to play led Cardinal Coach
Tim Schaaf to say that the Stanford golf program has
now taken its place as one of the top golf programs
in the country
"The trip represents a step forward for the pro
gram in terms of recruiting," Schaaf said.
The tournament, sponsored by Ski Journal, a
Japanese publication, annually invites three Ameri
can men's collegiate teams (Stanford, Brigham
Young and Arizona State this year) and one
women's team (Tulsa) to not only compete, but to
hold clinics and help improve the quality of play in
Japan.
The five-man team which left Saturday with
Schaaf for the Far East includes seniors Don
Walsworth, Carl Wagner and Phil Rowley; junior
Rich Marik and sophomore John Dickey.
The team will spend a week in Japan. Although
this week's play will count toward end-of-season
tabulations and a possible NCAA berth in the spring,
according to Schaaf, "the broadening of experience
is of equal if not more importance."
This experience could pay dividends further down
the road, as Schaaf tries to direct his team toward a
repeat appearance in the NCAA tournament in May.
And the Cardinal might need all the help it can
get. The team did not raise many eyebrows when it
finished 13th out of 20 teams in its first tournament,
the Americana at Lake Geneva. Wis.

Afiei listening 10 ouiaai, iiowever, one gets the
impression that you are going to need a reservation
to be able to jump on the Cardinal golf bandwagon
later this season.
"The same group of guys that played in the
Americana also finished third in a tournament last
year which had a highly competitive field," he said.
Schaaf added that the team had yet to feel the im
pact of three promising freshmen — Brad Geer,
Roger Miraglia and Casey Pittock.
While admitting the team was unprepared for the
Americana, Schaaf said Stanford's performance
there was "not going to be a representee showing"
of the squad's quality of play this season.
The road to an NCAA berth is going to be a
bumpy one for the Cardinal. Schaaf believes poten
tial rivals for the six West Coast NCAA spots will be
Arizona State, Arizona, USC, UCLA and Oregon
from the Pacific-10; and University of the Pacific,
San Jose State, Fresno State and Long Beach State
from the Pacific Coast Athletic Association.
Because of this competition, the Stanford band
wagon is relatively empty now. But Schaaf contends
that this is a year of transition on the West Coast be
cause many teams are facing the same problem that
Stanford now faces — the graduation of valuable
players.
"It all depends on who gets going the quickest,"
Schaaf said. "If we get hammered early, we may not
be able to catch up. We need people to emerge as
stoppers, to avoid any mysterious slumps and to
develop experience."
That process continues a long, long way from
home this week.

Cardinal golfers haven't had much experience reading Japanese putts, but they'll have their
chance this week. Their opponents, Arizona State and Brigham Young, shouldn't be as
foreign as the greens.
