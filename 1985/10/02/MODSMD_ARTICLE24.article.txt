# Hoosier Football?
## 
### 
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) — In
diana's football team has won its
first three games, matching its best
start in 18 years.
Give Coach Bill Mallory credit.
He refused to dwell on last year's
winless record, insisting all along
the Hoosiers were never that far
from respectability.
He brought in some junior col
lege players, found a way to beef up
a miserable running game and
promoted a flock of red-shirts to
the varsity.
"The thing that pleases me is
that the kids care. They want to do
better," said Mallory. "With that ap
proach, they'll do nothing but im
prove."
Long overshadowed by an im
mensely successful basketball pro
gram, losing had been a way of life
for Indiana's football teams. In 98
years of intercollegiate competi
tion, 327 victories figure out to only
3.3 victories a season. Only one In
diana coach in the past 64 years has
compiled an overall winning record;
none since Bo McMillan left in 1947.
When Mallory came to Indiana in
1984 after successful stops at
Miami, Ohio; Colorado and North

ern Illinois, he inherited a five-game
losing streak and a program in dis
array under its third coach in as
many years.
The Hoosiers stretched their
losing streak to a school-record 16
games, the longest among the na
tion's major college teams, although
eight of their 11 losses in 1984
were by a total of 49 points and
seven of the 11 teams that beat
them later appeared in postseason
bowl games.
"The biggest thing these guys
wanted was stability," said Mallory,
who succeeded Sam Wyche a year
after Wyche replaced the fired Lee
Corso. "They have that now.
Things will get better. We have to
maintain the attitude that we can do
nothing but get better."
A look at this week's NCAA Divi
sion I-A leaders shows the results.
Indiana is second in the nation in
total offense at 527 yards a game,
seventh in scoring at 38.3 points a
game and 10th in rushing, where
the Hoosiers' 843 net yards is just
33 yards short of their entire 11-
game output of a year ago.
