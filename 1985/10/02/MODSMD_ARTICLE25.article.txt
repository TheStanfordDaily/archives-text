# Men Host Bulldogs
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
Stanford is on a roll. Similarly,
Fresno State is hot.
Today at 3 p.m. at Maloney
Field, the Cardinal will host the
Bulldogs in what will be the
Pacific Soccer Conference (PSC)
opener for each team. And the
contest should be a dandy.
First of all, the Cardinal has
won two games in a row to even
its season record at 4-4-2.
Second, the Cardinal's offense is
finally starting to produce,
having scored four goals in the
two victories. Previously, Stan
ford had only scored five times in
eight games.
To top it off, the Cardinal en
joys the services of the league's
premier goaltender, junior Tom
Austin.
The Bulldogs have some im
pressive credentials themselves.
Fresno, which sports a 6-4
mark, recently defeated power
ful Washington and upset nation

ally ranked UCLA by a 2-1 tally.
"That win will probably put
them (Fresno St.) in this week's
top 20," Stanford Coach Sam
Koch thinks.
Regardless of their ranking,
the Bulldogs bring a load of tal
ent to the Farm. Senior
midfielder Randy Prescott leads
the team in scoring with six goals
and two assists. On defense,
Fresno returns Lst year's team
MVP and first-team AU-PSC
senior Kenny Mays. Although
positioned on the back line, Mays
is also a threat to score.
And unlike the predominantly
born-in-America Stanford team,
Fresno has a foreign threat in
the form of Nigerian forward
Chris Ogbodo. Ogbodo is second
on the team in scoring with five
goals and three assists.
Not all of Fresno State's talent
will be able to play today,
however. Chato Elgorriaga, last
year's PSC all-league
goaltender, was red-carded in
Fresno's Friday night contest
against San Diego State.
