# Unbeaten and Getting Better
## 
### 
ANAHEIM (AP) — The Los
Angeles Rams have been a team in
weekly transition, but they have
been solid enough to rank as one of
only two unbeaten clubs four weeks
into the 1985 National Football
League season.
"One of the good things about us
right now is that we've been essen
tially an unsettled team," Robinson
said Monday at his weekly meeting
with reporters. "We're a team
that's still taking shape, and we
have a chance to get better."
Robinson talked about the fact
that the Rams' passing game has
been in a period of adjustment, with
some new receivers and a new
quarterback in Dieter Brock.
"And we have not played two
games with the same runner," the
coach said.
The "transitional" Rams are 4-0,
marking their best start since 1978.
The Chicago Bears are the league's
only other undefeated team. The
Rams, who won their first two

games without contract holdout
Eric Dickerson, then the third with
him in his 1985 debut, posted their
fourth victory last Sunday, a 17-6
triumph over the winless Atlanta
Falcons.
And again, they were without
Dickerson for much of the game.
He went to the sidelines after he
felt a twinge in his left hamstring
late in the first half and didn't
return.
Third-string running back
Charles White provided the offen
sive punch in the Rams' first two
games, wins over Denver and
Philadelphia. Dickerson then
rushed for 150 yards in Los An
geles' victory over Seattle.
Against Atlanta, quarterback
Dieter Brock, a 34-year-old NFL
rookie who played 11 seasons in
the Canadian Football League, took
up the slack, throwing for 215 yards
and two touchdowns on a 16-of-20
performance.
"We feel like things in our passing

are starting to fall into place," Rob
inson said, commenting that, had a
couple of his throws not have been
dropped, Brock would have wound
up with four touchdown passes and
some 270 yards.
The Rams coach said that Dick
erson, the NFL's leading rusher the
past two seasons and holder of the
league's single-season rushing
record, should be fine for Sun
day's game at Anaheim Stadium
against the Minnesota Vikings.
"We don't expect to go 16-0;
we're just going to try to get by
Minnesota," he said. "If it got to
nine or 10 games, maybe we'd get
excited about it."
Robinson, asked if he'd had any
spare time to enjoy the Rams' good
start, smiled and answered: "Oh,
maybe on Sunday night, you go out
to dinner and make some wild
statements, hopefully with a friend
who realizes you're either drunk or
stupid."
