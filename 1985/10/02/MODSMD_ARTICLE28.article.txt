Czech Jet Fires At U.S. Copter
WASHINGTON — The Pentagon disclosed yesterday that a
Czechoslovakian military jet had crossed the West German border,
fired two to four rocktets at a U.S. Army helicopter on routine border
reconnaissance and fled back across the frontier.
The helicopter was not hit in the attack Saturday, which Pent
agon spokesman Robert Sims described as the most severe in a se
ries of 17 violations of West German airspace by Warsaw Pact
aircraft since April. None of the previous incidents involved weapons
fire.
Pentagon aides said they were puzzled by Saturday's attack,
which they viewed as intentional and not simply the result of a
navigational error. The United States has strongly protested "this ir
responsible act" to the Czech government, Sims said.
U.S. officials emphatically denied yesterday that the U.S. helicop
ter was closer to the Czech border than about 100 yards — state
ments more precise than those issued by the Pentagon in April 1984,
when a similar helicopter was attacked by Soviet-made MiGs along
the same border. Shortly after disclosing that incident, it was ac
knowledged that the U.S. craft had inadvertently strayed six miles
into Czech territory.
Describing Saturday's incident, Sims said a Czech L-39 military
trainer, a high-performance jet, broke away from at least one other
similar plane on the Czech side of the border, invaded West German
airspace and fired on the U.S. helicopter, an AH-1S Cobra.
The Pentagon spokesman said that there had been no communica
tion between the Czech jet and the U.S. helicopter, nor had the jet
issued any warning before firing.
"The Czechs are hard-bitten," Sims observed.
Islamic Group May Kill Soviets
BEIRUT — An Islamic group holding four kidnapped Soviet Em
bassy officials distributed photographs of the captives with cocked
guns to their heads yesterday and threatened to kill one of them un
less a Syrian-backed offensive against Moslem fundamentalists in
Tripoli was halted.
The release of the demand and the photos by a previously un
known group calling itself the Islamic Liberation Organization came
after conflicting reports about whether the Soviets, kidnapped from
two automobiles Monday, had been killed.
Telephoned reports early yesterday had said two of the Soviets
had been "executed" by their captors. But later a Soviet source here
said information had been "conveyed to the Soviet Embassy by
Syrian military officers in charge of security in Beirut and in contact
with the abductors" that "all the hostages are alive and are in
Beirut."
One of the statements by the alleged captors said the first of the
Soviets would be killed last night if the demands were not met, but
there was no indication by late last night that any of the captives had
been killed.
There also was confusion about who had abducted the Soviets and
who was holding them. Callers Monday had claimed that they were
kidnapped by Islamic Jihad, a shadowy terrorist group that has
claimed responsibility for several bombings against U.S. and other
Western targets and has said it is holding six Americans and four
Frenchmen.
The Islamic Liberation Organization statement accompanying the
photos yesterday, however, disclaimed any connection with Islamic
Jihad. In Moscow, the Soviet news media, in their first mention of
the kidnapping, branded it a "heinous crime" and said that "all neces
sary steps" would be taken to save the captives. A statement by the
official TASS news agency, read on state television, blamed "bandits
from one of the arch-reactionary, ultra-right-wing organizations" in
Beirut, Washington Post correspondent Celestine Bohlen reported.
Mitterrand Declines Invitation
PARIS — President Francois Mitterrand yesterday turned down
an invitation from President Reagan to the leaders of other Western
industrialized nations to attend a meeting in New York later this
month to discuss next November's U.S.-Soviet summit.
French political analysts said Reagan's invitation had come at an
embarrassing time for Mitterrand, who is preparing to greet Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Paris today. In playing host to the Soviet
leader, France is anxious to stress that it has an independent voice in
world affairs and is more than just a loyal ally of the United States.
Gorbachev, in the first interview he has granted to a Western tele
vision station, said last night that he wanted much more from the
Gepeva summit than just an occasion to shake Reagan's hand and
"smile pleasantly" for the television cameras. He warned of a dan
gerous spiral in the arms race because of the U.S. strategic defense
initiative (SDI).
The interview, which was aired simultaneously in France and the
Soviet Union, also gave viewers in both countries a chance to see the
new Kremlin leader defending his country from Western criticism on
human rights.
Gorbachev, who will meet Reagan in Geneva on Nov. 19-20, also
confirmed the substance of recent U.S. news reports on new Soviet
proposals for a sharp cut in strategic nuclear arms linked to major re
strictions on SDI. He declined, however, to go into details.
Analysts here said that Mitterrand's refusal to join other Western
leaders in New York was likely to strengthen his negotiating hand
with Gorbachev during their three days of talks. According to senior
French officials, France is resisting Soviet pressure to sign a joint
communique condemning the militarization of space and SDI.
A communique from the Elysee presidential palace last night said
Mitterrand would not attend the proposed seven-nation meeting in
New York on Oct. 24, but added that he would be happy to meet
Reagan at a later date. Apart from France, other U.S. allies invited
to the New York meeting on arms control and East-West relations
are Britain, West Germany, Canada, Italy and Japan.
Soviets Hint at Arms Flexibility
GENEVA, Switzerland — Chief Soviet arms negotiator Viktor
Karpov dropped a hint of flexibility here yesterday when he told an
impromptu news conference that the new Soviet proposals for deep
cuts in nuclear weapons linked to curtailment of the American "Star
Wars" space defense program "can be the basis for further discus
sion and decisions."
"We see our task as the Soviet delegation to do everything we can
so that the meeting between President Reagan and Mikhail Gorba
chev be successful," Karpov said. "We introduced proposals, and we
don't have any positive response up until now. So what we need for
progress is that the American side change the attitude toward the
discussions and take a stand that will allow both delegations to work
together, having in mind the same aim of preparing concrete practi
cal results."
