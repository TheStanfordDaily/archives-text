# Israelis Destroy P.L.O. Base in Tunisia

TUNIS, Tunisia â€” Israeli warplanes yester
day destroyed the personal headquarters here of
Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Libera
tion Organization, in a daring precision attack
that required mid-air refueling to reach the tar
get 1,500 miles from home base.
Hours after the six-minute, mid-morning
bomb and missile attack on the seaside complex
21 miles south of Tunis, the official Tunisian
news agency TAP said the death toll had reached
more than 50. Earlier, a PLO spokesman put the
provisional casualty toll at 156 without providing
a breakdown between the dead and wounded.
Arafat, who reportedly was at another PLO
site, was not injured, although there were indica
tions the raid was timed to kill him. Witnesses
said his L-shaped headquarters building had all
but disappeared into a deep crater.
Israeli officials said the raid was in retaliation
to the assassination in Cyprus last Wednesday of
three Israelis at the hands of Palestinian gun

men, although the PLO had denied involvement.
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said it was a
warning to terrorists "that the long arm" of Is
rael's military "will reach them wherever they
are."
The raid, Israel's first outside the Israeli-
Lebanese region since 1981, brought wide con
demnation from Arab countries, including Egypt,
from U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar, and from several Western European
capitals.
But in Washington, President Reagan and
other U.S. officials strongly defended the Israeli
raid, with White House spokesman Larry
Speakes calling it "retaliation against a terrorist
attack" and "a legitimate response and an ex
pression of self defense."
The Tunisian government last night asked the
U.N. Security Council to meet to discuss the
raid, which Tunisian Foreign Minister Beji Caid
Essebsi said was a case of state terrorism aimed

at sabotaging Middle East peace efforts.
A visibly affected Arafat, who visited the
scene in early afternoon but made no statement,
was reported to have been in Marsa, a northern
suburb of Tunis, when the attack began at 10:07
a.m., diplomats said.
Diplomatic sources warned that the United
States might be accused of collusion with Israel
in the raid. They reasoned that many Tunisians
would question whether the United States 6th
Fleet, which is reported to be off the Tunisian
shore as a show of support for Tunisia in a cur
rent dispute with Libya, had been able to detect
the Israeli intruders and could have alerted
Tunisia.
Military sources noted, however, that unless
the Israelis had been detected at higher altitudes
while still in the eastern Mediterranean, even so
phisticated equipment aboard the U.S. vessels
would have had trouble picking up the Israeli
aircraft in their low-level approach.
