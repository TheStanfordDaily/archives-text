# Two Fraternities Face Sanctions
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
Social privileges for Sigma Alpha Ep
silon and Phi Delta Theta fraternities
were suspended temporarily Monday
because of alleged violations of Univer
sity and Interfraternity Council viola
tions.
The temporary probations are ex
pected to end Friday when the Inter
fraternity Council completes an investi
gation of the incidents which prompted
the IFC-ordered probations.
The suspensions prohibit the two res
idential fraternities from holding parties
or open-campus events until the
outcome of the investigation, according

to Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano.
The Phi Delt suspension stemmed
from a report that a drunken Cedro
freshman required hospitalization after
falling while returning to his dorm from a
Phi Delt "Kamikaze" party last week.
The SAE suspension resulted from an
incident cited in a Sept. 24 letter from
Norm Robinson, associate dean of Stu
dent Affairs for Residential Education, to
IFC President Don Galles.
Robinson said police visited the SAE
house three times on Sept. 23 to ask
revelers to turn down music at an even
ing party. Police later returned and un
plugged the stereo themselves, accord
ing to Robinson.
The results of both investigations will
be presented to the IFC at a meeting to

morrow and made public the next day,
according to IFC Vice President David
Northway, who is conducting the Phi
Delt investigation.
Galles said it appears the Phi Delts
were "following all the (IFC) party moni
toring rules" but said the incident is
more complicated because the party
may have centered around alcohol,
which would violate Residential Educa
tion directives.
A kamikaze is a drink made from
vodka, triple sec and lime juice.
"We are adamant about the fact that
we lived up to the IFC rules," said Phi
Delt President Bret Monello. "We
(were) not negligent in any sense of the
word."
Five sober party monitors were pres

ent throughout the party, he said. IFC
regulations call for a minimum of three
party monitors.
A party monitor questioned the Cedro
student about his condition before he
left, Monello said. The student did not
begin to show signs of dangerous in
toxication until after he had left the
party, Monello said.
Monello blamed the suspension on the
current "shoot first" IFC suspension
policy and preliminary emergency and
Residential Education reports that
"painted us in a very dark light."
The levying of temporary suspensions
before preliminary investigations are
complete is considered by the IFC and
others involved in this latest action
to be a major deficiency in the cur
rent IFC process.
"I don't think (the process)
allowed for adequate
(investigatory) time," Pisano said.
A revamped IFC judicial mecha
nism, expected this month, will
"dramatically" change IFC policies
and allow more "due process," re
ducing the odds of resorting to
suspensions without preliminary in
vestigation, Galles said.
