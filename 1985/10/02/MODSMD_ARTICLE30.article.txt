# Donald Regan seen as articulator in move
## Heckler Accepts Ambassador Post 
### 
WASHINGTON — President
Reagan announced yesterday that
Margaret Heckler, his secretary of
Health and Human Services, had
agreed to leave the Cabinet and
become ambassador to Ireland, a
post he denied is a "dumping
ground."
Reagan, with Heckler at his side,
appeared in the White House brief
ing room yesterday to denounce
what he called the "malicious gos
sip" that he was getting rid of her
because she was incompetent or in
sufficiently conservative.
In a raucous atmosphere of
shouted questions, frequent inter

ruptions and obvious skepticism
among the reporters he was ad
dressing, Reagan took center stage
to say that he was responsible for a
job shift that Wliite House officials
said had been engineered by his
chief of staff, Donald Regan. Heck
ler, at first fighting back tears,
defiantly defended her record in
managing the $330 billion-a-year
agency and said that "the Great
Communicator" had talked her into
becoming ambassador.
Defending his chief of staff
against the charge that he was re
sponsible for firing Heckler from
the Cabinet, President Reagan said

of Donald Regan: "He's on our
side."
But senior Administration offi
cials familiar with the sequence of
events that led to Heckler's
removal as secretary of Health and
Human Services said Regan has
never sided with her and was deter
mined to force her out of the
Cabinet. A well-informed White
House official said Regan sent
Heckler "signals of nuclear propor
tions" that he wanted her to leave,
adding, "She refused to hear the
signals."
Administration and congressional
sources said that former HHS Un

dersecretary David Swoap, Penn
sylvania Gov. Richard Thornburgh
(R) and James Cavanaugh, a health
specialist in the Nixon Administra
tion, were among prospective can
didates to become HHS secretary.
Some officials said that John Svahn,
the White House domestic-policy
chief who was formerly Heckler's
deputy, was also a possibility even
though Reagan yesterday said that
he would not be appointed.
A White House official said the
selection process would take about
two weeks and would start with a
list of a half-dozen names that
would be whittled down by Regan
