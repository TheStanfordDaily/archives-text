Carbide May Be Fined
WASHINGTON — The Occupational Safety
and Health Administration yesterday charged
Union Carbide Corp. with six "willful" and
"serious" violations of federal safety standards
in the chemical leak that hospitalized more
than 130 people in August in Institute, W. Va.,
and proposed $32,100 in penalties.
The citations provide a detailed account of a
series of at least six separate safety lapses
over an 11-day period that combined to cause
the accident.
OSHA said Union Carbide's pesticide plant
used an inadequately designed storage tank for
toxic mixtures, failed to properly monitor the
heat and pressure of volatile chemicals, ne
glected to fix a malfunctioning computerized
alarm system, operated an improperly de
signed control room with an air conditioner
that brought fumes inside and failed to provide
a sufficient number of respirators for its
employees.
"It is unusual for OSHA to cite willful viola
tions. We do not do it very often," said agency
spokeswoman Chriss Winston. "The definition
of willful is that they knew about a hazardous
condition and did not make an effort to elimi
nate it."
Company spokesman Thad Epps in West
Virginia said Union Carbide would contest the
OSHA citations. "Union Carbide has received
the citations related to the Aug. 11 incident.
Union Carbide operates all of its facilities in
compliance with all government laws and regu
lations, and we intend to contest these cita
tions. Beyond that, we have no comment,"
Epps said.

OSHA penalties are limited to a maximum of
$10,000 per violation, but sources familiar with
the Union Carbide case said that the finding of
"willful" violation of safety standards — if up
held — could as a side effect greatly increase
the company's liability in lawsuits for more
than $85 million that have been filed in the
West Virginia case.
E.B. White Dies at 86
E.B. White, one of America's foremost es
sayists and the author of several classic
children's books, died yesterday at his farm in
Brooklin, Maine.
He was 86 and J. Russell Wiggins, publisher
of a community newspaper in Brooklin and a
longtime friend, said the veteran humorist had
been suffering from Alzheimer's disease.
"A few months ago, he said he had so much
to tell and so little time to tell it," recalled Wig
gins, who had known White since the late
19405.
White was familiar to millions on various
levels. He was the author of "Charlotte's
Web," "Stuart Little" and"The Trumpet of the
Swan," children's books that have also
delighted adults. He was well-known to writ
ers for his updating of "The Elements of
Style," a highly praised guide to writing and
English usage written by one of White's college
professors, William Strunk Jr.
But he was probably at his best in his essays
on American life, both urban and rural, many of
which appeared in The New Yorker magazine.
White also wrote editorials for The New
Yorker. And more than any other writer asso
ciated with the magazine since its founding in

February 1925, he helped set its tone and
style.
White won the National Medal of Literature
in 1971 and a Pulitzer Prize special citation in
1978 for the body of his work.
Cigarette Tax OK'd
WASHINGTON — President Reagan
changed his mind and decided to sign legisla
tion temporarily extending the cigarette tax at
16 cents a pack late Monday night after Senate
Agriculture Committee Chairman Jesse Helms
(R-N.C.) made a personal appeal to Reagan
not to veto the bill, White House and congres
sional officials said yesterday.
The White House announced Reagan signed
the bill shortly before midnight.
"Helms clearly made a strong pitch directly
to Reagan," said one White House official who
thought a veto was imminent.
In a later telephone call, Helms told Reagan
he was calling in part because he wanted to
keep "good faith" with other lawmakers on an
arrangement made last month involving
tobacco price-support legislation, officials said.
Helms, speaking for tobbacco-state
senators, had agreed to support the higher cig
arette tax in exchange for attaching the
tobacco bill to a deficit-reduction measure,
where it would have a far better chance of ap
proval on the Senate floor than if it stood
alone. Opponents have criticized the tobacco
bill as a "bailout" to rid the tobacco growers
and industry of the costs of a huge surplus
piling up from past support programs.

a sufficient number of respirators for its
employees.
"It is unusual for OSHA to cite willful viola
tions. We do not do it very often," said agency
spokeswoman Chriss Winston. "The definition
of willful is that they knew about a hazardous
condition and did not make an effort to elimi
nate it."
Company spokesman Thad Epps in West
Virginia said Union Carbide would contest the
OSHA citations. "Union Carbide has received
the citations related to the Aug. 11 incident.
Union Carbide operates all of its facilities in
compliance with all government laws and regu
lations, and we intend to contest these cita
tions. Beyond that, we have no comment,"
Epps said.

OSHA penalties are limited to a maximum of
$10,000 per violation, but sources familiar with
the Union Carbide case said that the finding of
"willful" violation of safety standards — if up
held — could as a side effect greatly increase
the company's liability in lawsuits for more
than $85 million that have been filed in the
West Virginia case.
E.B. White Dies at 86
E.B. White, one of America's foremost es
sayists and the author of several classic
children's books, died yesterday at his farm in
Brooklin, Maine.
He was 86 and J. Russell Wiggins, publisher
of a community newspaper in Brooklin and a
longtime friend, said the veteran humorist had
been suffering from Alzheimer's disease.
"A few months ago, he said he had so much
to tell and so little time to tell it," recalled Wig
gins, who had known White since the late
19405.
White was familiar to millions on various
levels. He was the author of "Charlotte's
Web," "Stuart Little" and"The Trumpet of the
Swan," children's books that have also
delighted adults. He was well-known to writ
ers for his updating of "The Elements of
Style," a highly praised guide to writing and
English usage written by one of White's college
professors, William Strunk Jr.
But he was probably at his best in his essays
on American life, both urban and rural, many of
which appeared in The New Yorker magazine.
White also wrote editorials for The New
Yorker. And more than any other writer asso
ciated with the magazine since its founding in

February 1925, he helped set its tone and
style.
White won the National Medal of Literature
in 1971 and a Pulitzer Prize special citation in
1978 for the body of his work.
Cigarette Tax OK'd
WASHINGTON — President Reagan
changed his mind and decided to sign legisla
tion temporarily extending the cigarette tax at
16 cents a pack late Monday night after Senate
Agriculture Committee Chairman Jesse Helms
(R-N.C.) made a personal appeal to Reagan
not to veto the bill, White House and congres
sional officials said yesterday.
The White House announced Reagan signed
the bill shortly before midnight.
"Helms clearly made a strong pitch directly
to Reagan," said one White House official who
thought a veto was imminent.
In a later telephone call, Helms told Reagan
he was calling in part because he wanted to
keep "good faith" with other lawmakers on an
arrangement made last month involving
tobacco price-support legislation, officials said.
Helms, speaking for tobbacco-state
senators, had agreed to support the higher cig
arette tax in exchange for attaching the
tobacco bill to a deficit-reduction measure,
where it would have a far better chance of ap
proval on the Senate floor than if it stood
alone. Opponents have criticized the tobacco
bill as a "bailout" to rid the tobacco growers
and industry of the costs of a huge surplus
piling up from past support programs.
