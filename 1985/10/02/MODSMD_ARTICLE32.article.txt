TV in McMartin Trial
LOS ANGELES — A boy who described
"naked movie star" games yesterday became
the first child witness in the McMartin Pre-
School molestation case to testify over closed
circuit television out of the presence of the
seven defendants.
The 8-year-old appeared on two color tele
vision monitors during the preliminary hearing
before Municipal Judge Aviva Bobb. His father,
seated next to him, appeared on a third televi
sion set.
A state law passed this year in reaction to
the McMartin case permits children under 10
to testify over closed circuit television in such
cases if the judge determines they are too
frightened or upset to face the defendants.
Under questioning by prosecutor Lael
Rubin, the boy testified that defendant
Raymond Buckey, 27, molested and
sodomized him during "naked movie star

games" at the preschool in suburban Manhat
tan Beach.
Other children also have testified that such
games occurred and to several other details
the boy described yesterday: that children
were tied up and drugged while they were
abused, that Buckey threatened them and
their parents if they revealed what happened,
and that animals were tortured to silence the
youngsters.
Major Bills Tackled
SACRAMENTO — Gov. George Deuk
mejian signed a mandatory seat-belt law and a
$21 million mental health bill yesterday, while
vetoing a bill to restrict foreign wine and cham
pagne imports.
Deukmejian said he signed the seat-belt bill
to save Californians' lives, although he didn't
like a section of the bill that would repeal the

seat-belt requirement if the federal govern
ment rescinds its order that all cars have
passive restraints, such as air bags or auto
matic seat belts, by 1990.
The bill will require most drivers and pas
sengers, beginning Jan. 1, to use the manual
seat belts already in most passenger vehicles.
A first conviction could bring a $20 fine or

safety school. Subsequent convictions carry a
$50 fine. Citations could be issued only in con
nection with other traffic offenses.
The bill also requires passenger vehicles
sold in California after Sept. 1, 1989, to have
passive restraints.
The mental health bill, by Assemblyman
Bruce Bronzan (D-Fresno), will spend the $21
million this year on county programs to "case
manage" the homeless mentally ill by assigning
each a welfare worker to help obtain benefits
and services. The bill will also set up county
programs beginning next year aimed at men
tally ill children, elderly and veterans.
