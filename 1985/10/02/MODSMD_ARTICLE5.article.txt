# Burial Ground Slows Project
## 
### KELLY SUND 
More than 30 acres of the proposed Stanford
West housing project may become an ar
chaeological sanctuary due to recently unearthed
evidence that humans may have lived there as
early as 800 A. D.
Stanford West is a 46-acre parcel of land lo
cated between Sand Hill Road and San Fran
cisquito Creek. Palo Alto approved a University
proposal to build 1,100 units of housing there in
1983, but a delay ensued because of Stanford's
refusal to accept certain conditions stipulated by
the city.
In response to a request from the Anthropol
ogy Department, the University has now agreed
to postpone all construction on the site until the
boundaries of the archaeological site are
delineated.
The 20 sites recently discovered on University
land include villages, temporary camps, bedrock
mortar areas, petroglyphs (designs etched into
rock) and at least six burial grounds.
Most sites are located along eight creekbeds,
and Prof. Harumi Befu, chairman of the Anthro
pology Department, Asst. Prof. John Rick and
Ph.D. candidate Barbara Bocek have requested
that 500 feet of land on each side of those
streams be placed in an "archaeological
preserve" until the scientific value of the sites
has been determined.
A 500-foot setback on the Stanford West prop
erty would reduce the area available for housing
to 14.2 acres.
Provost James Rosse has agreed to delay
plans for the housing project until boundaries for
the sites have been established. Rosse has also
appointed a task force to evaluate the feasibility
of putting all creekside lands in a
preserve.
"The task of setting an institu
tional response which takes into
consideration a variety of Univer
sity needs will be a challenging
one," Rosse told University News
Service.
"Stanford lands have the poten
tial to provide sites for badly
needed housing, to earn funds to
support the University's educa
tional work and to provide open
space amenities."
But Rosse said the University
has "no choice but to consider fully
the possibility that some of the
property may form an irreplaceable

archaeological resource that should
be preserved. No other California
institution has comparable access to
such sites as well as the potential to
support serious investigation in that
field."
Bocek explained that the Anthro
pology Department requested that
the University "consider not devel
oping the remaining open land. That
they are willing to consider it is ab
solutely great. We're so pleased
that they're supporting what we
view as a real research opportu
nity."
Bocek went on to say that "As a
group (the sites) are sort of a once
in-a-lifetime thing. There's no other
place with open land accessible to a
University research team."
Excavation at Stanford West has
turned up significant amounts of

both human artifacts and natural
deposits in layers at least eight feet
deep. The artifacts in each layer ex
tend over distinct areas, and the
anthropologists express hope that
such clear delineation will improve
their knowledge of the way ar
chaeological deposits develop over
time, as well as their understanding
of the past.
The recent studies have been
conducted at Stanford West since
1981, when the land was first sug
gested for housing. In 1983, the
land was surveyed, and random
test pits were dug in 1984 and
1985.
Barbara Martinez, a student
member of the task force appointed
by Rosse to determine the impor
tance of the sites, said the investi
gation will begin in a few weeks.
