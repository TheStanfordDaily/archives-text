# Burial Ground Slows Project

### KELLY SUND 
More than 30 acres of the proposed Stanford
West housing project may become an ar
chaeological sanctuary due to recently unearthed
evidence that humans may have lived there as
early as 800 A. D.
Stanford West is a 46-acre parcel of land lo
cated between Sand Hill Road and San Fran
cisquito Creek. Palo Alto approved a University
proposal to build 1,100 units of housing there in
1983, but a delay ensued because of Stanford's
refusal to accept certain conditions stipulated by
the city.
In response to a request from the Anthropol
ogy Department, the University has now agreed
to postpone all construction on the site until the
boundaries of the archaeological site are
delineated.
The 20 sites recently discovered on University
land include villages, temporary camps, bedrock
mortar areas, petroglyphs (designs etched into
rock) and at least six burial grounds.
Most sites are located along eight creekbeds,
and Prof. Harumi Befu, chairman of the Anthro
pology Department, Asst. Prof. John Rick and
Ph.D. candidate Barbara Bocek have requested
that 500 feet of land on each side of those
streams be placed in an "archaeological
preserve" until the scientific value of the sites
has been determined.
A 500-foot setback on the Stanford West prop
erty would reduce the area available for housing
to 14.2 acres.
Provost James Rosse has agreed to delay
plans for the housing project until boundaries for
the sites have been established. Rosse has also
appointed a task force to evaluate the feasibility
