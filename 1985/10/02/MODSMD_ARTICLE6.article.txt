# Murals Color Zapata Thematic

Three faces stare out at students
seated in the Zapata dining hall. The
first, that of a young Mexican girl,
beams with white teeth and long
black hair. The second face catches
one's attention the first time one
enters the room; a face with no
features is framed by flowing
blonde hair. The last visage is an
old, weathered Mexican woman,
thin, with hair that is almost shock
ingly white.
Across the top of the mural are
streaks of red, resembling, and
many say representing, blood.
This mural, which, like others in
the house, is a subject of contro
versy for residents, is part of the
history of Casa Zapata and of the
Chicano movement here during the
late 1960s and early 70s.
Tony Burciaga, Zapata's new
resident fellow, is giving a SWOPSI
course entitled "Murals as Socially
Concious Art," with the murals in
the dorm as one of the subjects.
RAs and theme assistants (TAs)

seemed eager to explain their ideas
about the murals.
"The blood at the top (of the
dining hall mural) symbolizes that
this is one life of a woman," said
sophomore TA Velina Underwood,
recounting an interpretation that
had been given to her. "At left the
Chicano girl is bombarded by the
media with the image of a blonde
woman, and she loses herself as
shown by her blank face. At the
right, she returns somewhat to her
self, although haggard and old."
This is only one interpretation,
she explained. Underwood said she
thinks murals are supposed to grip
you and that only by discussing
them will you find meaning.
The dining hall mural was painted
by Zarco Guerrero, commonly
known as Zarco, an artist renowned
for his particular emphasis on faces.
Zarco undertook the Zapata
mural of the three women in 1972
and finished it in 1973.

tive numbers of Chicano students
to Stanford and to establish a
residence supporting them as a new
section of the campus community.
The murals were an integral part
of this idea, and they run through
out the house, which was changed
from John Muir to the existing
theme house in 1972.
Moving to the stairwells on the
first floor one finds a mural com
memorating the United Farm
Workers' (UFW) boycott in 1973
and 1974, painted by a former
Spanish student, Tina Alvarez.
Young Mexican Americans are

portrayed carrying the red and
white banner of the UFW and
marching out of a background of
grapes and chains toward a bright
sun. The slogan HUELGIX is writ
ten below, meaning "strike" in
Spanish.
On the second floor are some
caricatures of Chicano people, in
cluding a child saying "frijole power
carnal" and a man squatting and of
fering his friend a joint, two details
which cause some residents
distress.
"They're base, crude and have
no meaning to me," said Tasha Cas
taneda, a freshman from Yakima,
Wash.
Castenada also recalled being
part of the UFW boycott portrayed

in the mural on the first floor. She
stood outside of stores as a child to
protest in support of the workers.
Because of this experience, she
also finds the murals "necessary
(to) signify the starting of the
Chicano movement."
Many residents of Zapata have
found the second floor caricatures
troublesome, though, because they
project an image that they would
rather not have associated with the
Chicano population.
On the third floor is another
Zarco mural entitled "Revolution
Mexicana" which depicts the heads
of two Mexican heroes: Emilio
Zapata and Pancho Villa.
Like the current Zapata resi
dents, Zarco too has toned down

since his activist days, calling him
self a "Southwest artist" now, ac
cording to Burciaga, who is also an
artist.
One mural in the lobby as you en
ter Zapata has been covered as of
the beginning of this year. The
mural depicts a figure kneeling in
supplication, but some said it looks
more like submission or surrender.
The mural still exists, yet is hid
den from view. There has been
some debate over the fate of the
murals and whether or not they
should remain a permanent part of
Casa Zapata.
Kim Card, a senior RA and three
year Zapata resident said she feels
that they are still appropriate as
part of the history of the house and

the movements that brought it
about.
The murals "are aesthetically ap
pealing and have value in them," ac
cording to Card.
"They make people wonder and
more aware of history," said Alonso
Duenas, a Zapata resident last
year.
Many residents mentioned the
strength of the statements made in
the murals and expressed surprise
or sometimes shock at their first
encounter with them in Zapata.
"Sometimes it is good that they are
uncomfortable because they can
question the murals," Duenas said.
Burciaga stressed that he would
like to see the residents of the
house discuss the whole issue in or

der to determine the fate of the
murals.
He has proposed at house
meetings that they need not be
painted over. Rather, new murals
can be put on plywood and placed
over the old murals.
Although this option is open,
Burciaga said he thinks of the murals
as part of Zapata and Chicano art
tradition which "between 1968 and
1977 was very socially conscious
and militant" and doesn't want to
lose them completely as a part of
the house culture.
"The political message at times
won over aesthetics, because it
was a time of crisis," he explained.

The murals were an integral part
of this idea, and they run through
out the house, which was changed
from John Muir to the existing
theme house in 1972.
Moving to the stairwells on the
first floor one finds a mural com
memorating the United Farm
Workers' (UFW) boycott in 1973
and 1974, painted by a former
Spanish student, Tina Alvarez.
Young Mexican Americans are

portrayed carrying the red and
white banner of the UFW and
marching out of a background of
grapes and chains toward a bright
sun. The slogan HUELGIX is writ
ten below, meaning "strike" in
Spanish.
On the second floor are some
caricatures of Chicano people, in
cluding a child saying "frijole power
carnal" and a man squatting and of
fering his friend a joint, two details
which cause some residents
distress.
"They're base, crude and have
no meaning to me," said Tasha Cas
taneda, a freshman from Yakima,
Wash.
Castenada also recalled being
part of the UFW boycott portrayed

in the mural on the first floor. She
stood outside of stores as a child to
protest in support of the workers.
Because of this experience, she
also finds the murals "necessary
(to) signify the starting of the
Chicano movement."
Many residents of Zapata have
found the second floor caricatures
troublesome, though, because they
project an image that they would
rather not have associated with the
Chicano population.
On the third floor is another
Zarco mural entitled "Revolution
Mexicana" which depicts the heads
of two Mexican heroes: Emilio
Zapata and Pancho Villa.
Like the current Zapata resi
dents, Zarco too has toned down

since his activist days, calling him
self a "Southwest artist" now, ac
cording to Burciaga, who is also an
artist.
One mural in the lobby as you en
ter Zapata has been covered as of
the beginning of this year. The
mural depicts a figure kneeling in
supplication, but some said it looks
more like submission or surrender.
The mural still exists, yet is hid
den from view. There has been
some debate over the fate of the
murals and whether or not they
should remain a permanent part of
Casa Zapata.
Kim Card, a senior RA and three
year Zapata resident said she feels
that they are still appropriate as
part of the history of the house and

the movements that brought it
about.
The murals "are aesthetically ap
pealing and have value in them," ac
cording to Card.
"They make people wonder and
more aware of history," said Alonso
Duenas, a Zapata resident last
year.
Many residents mentioned the
strength of the statements made in
the murals and expressed surprise
or sometimes shock at their first
encounter with them in Zapata.
"Sometimes it is good that they are
uncomfortable because they can
question the murals," Duenas said.
Burciaga stressed that he would
like to see the residents of the
house discuss the whole issue in or

der to determine the fate of the
murals.
He has proposed at house
meetings that they need not be
painted over. Rather, new murals
can be put on plywood and placed
over the old murals.
Although this option is open,
Burciaga said he thinks of the murals
as part of Zapata and Chicano art
tradition which "between 1968 and
1977 was very socially conscious
and militant" and doesn't want to
lose them completely as a part of
the house culture.
"The political message at times
won over aesthetics, because it
was a time of crisis," he explained.
Three faces stare out at students
seated in the Zapata dining hall. The
first, that of a young Mexican girl,
beams with white teeth and long
black hair. The second face catches
one's attention the first time one
enters the room; a face with no
features is framed by flowing
blonde hair. The last visage is an
old, weathered Mexican woman,
thin, with hair that is almost shock
ingly white.
Across the top of the mural are
streaks of red, resembling, and
many say representing, blood.
This mural, which, like others in
the house, is a subject of contro
versy for residents, is part of the
history of Casa Zapata and of the
Chicano movement here during the
late 1960s and early 70s.
Tony Burciaga, Zapata's new
resident fellow, is giving a SWOPSI
course entitled "Murals as Socially
Concious Art," with the murals in
the dorm as one of the subjects.
RAs and theme assistants (TAs)

seemed eager to explain their ideas
about the murals.
"The blood at the top (of the
dining hall mural) symbolizes that
this is one life of a woman," said
sophomore TA Velina Underwood,
recounting an interpretation that
had been given to her. "At left the
Chicano girl is bombarded by the
media with the image of a blonde
woman, and she loses herself as
shown by her blank face. At the
right, she returns somewhat to her
self, although haggard and old."
This is only one interpretation,
she explained. Underwood said she
thinks murals are supposed to grip
you and that only by discussing
them will you find meaning.
The dining hall mural was painted
by Zarco Guerrero, commonly
known as Zarco, an artist renowned
for his particular emphasis on faces.
Zarco undertook the Zapata
mural of the three women in 1972
and finished it in 1973.
