# Murals Color Zapata Thematic

### RICHARD WALTER 
Three faces stare out at students
seated in the Zapata dining hall. The
first, that of a young Mexican girl,
beams with white teeth and long
black hair. The second face catches
one's attention the first time one
enters the room; a face with no
features is framed by flowing
blonde hair. The last visage is an
old, weathered Mexican woman,
thin, with hair that is almost shock
ingly white.
Across the top of the mural are
streaks of red, resembling, and
many say representing, blood.
This mural, which, like others in
the house, is a subject of contro
versy for residents, is part of the
history of Casa Zapata and of the
Chicano movement here during the
late 1960s and early 70s.
Tony Burciaga, Zapata's new
resident fellow, is giving a SWOPSI
course entitled "Murals as Socially
Concious Art," with the murals in
the dorm as one of the subjects.
RAs and theme assistants (TAs)

seemed eager to explain their ideas
about the murals.
"The blood at the top (of the
dining hall mural) symbolizes that
this is one life of a woman," said
sophomore TA Velina Underwood,
recounting an interpretation that
had been given to her. "At left the
Chicano girl is bombarded by the
media with the image of a blonde
woman, and she loses herself as
shown by her blank face. At the
right, she returns somewhat to her
self, although haggard and old."
This is only one interpretation,
she explained. Underwood said she
thinks murals are supposed to grip
you and that only by discussing
them will you find meaning.
The dining hall mural was painted
by Zarco Guerrero, commonly
known as Zarco, an artist renowned
for his particular emphasis on faces.
Zarco undertook the Zapata
mural of the three women in 1972
and finished it in 1973.

This Casa Zapata mural keeps Chicano students in touch with
their ancient Mexican roots. It is one of the less controversial
pieces of art filling this theme house.
