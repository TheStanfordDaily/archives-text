# U.N. Attorney Raps U.S. Acts

### JODY SMITH 
The failure of United States
citizens to understand or care about
international law has been as grave
as the government's violation of
those laws, according to Karen
Parker, a consulting attorney to the
United Nations.
In most discussions about
Central America, "law is rarely or
never discussed," Parker told an
audience at Kresge Auditorium last
night.
Such apathy is a new and disturb
ing phenomenon, Parker said.
"Under (President) Carter,
Americans bought the idea that in
ternational law and human rights
are important and relevant." Upon
President Reagan's election,
however, the public quickly and
quietly forgot Carter's commitment
to human rights, she said.
Parker was responsible for intro
ducing the principles of interna
tional law, specifically the Geneva
Convention, in defense of sanctuary
workers charged by the United
States with transporting and har
boring illegal aliens. She argues that
they are providing humanitarian aid

to victims of a war in accordance
with the Geneva Convention.
While she has often lost, a Texas
judge recently ruled in favor of her
arguments in a deportation case in
volving Salvadoran refugees.
And Parker said the world com
munity regards America's military
aid to El Salvador as a clear viola
tion of the rule of non-intervention.
International law prohibits in
volvement in another nation's inter
nal armed conflict, or civil war, she
said. In addition, the Salvadoran
government has consistently vio
lated the rules of war through its
mistreatment of POWs and
civilians, Parker said.
From a legal standpoint, U.S. ac
tions in Nicaragua are even worse,
she argued.
"At the very least the United
States government is in contempt
of court," Parker said of a recent
congressional vote to extend $27
million in aid to the Contras.
Parker's speech was sponsored
by the Stanford Central American
Action Network, the Center for
Latin American Studies, SWOPSI
and the International Relations and
Political Science Departments.
