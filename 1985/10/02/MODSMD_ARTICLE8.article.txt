# To the Root of Thorny Problem
## 
### ROBERT GROTH 
A puncture-vine infestation, blamed for the
popping of an untold number of bicycle tires,
has triggered a University campaign to rid the
troublesome weeds from campus.
Ray White, a doctoral candidate in biology,
has distributed fliers around campus urging
students to locate this "most obnoxious
weed," and Ray Fong, manager of University
Operations and Maintenance, has been uproot
ing the vine with the help of the grounds staff.
Student reaction to the campaign has been

mixed, ranging from support to complete indif
ference. As one student suggested, " No . . .
seriously . . . put Mr. Tuffy between your tire
and inner tube and everything will be fine."
According to White, the problem weed,
tribulus terrestris, was relatively sparse as late
as 1976. The weed can germinate in as few as
two weeks or lay dormant for as long as 10
years.
The most effective weapons against the
plant have been two species of weevils: one
that attacks the stem and another that attacks
the seed, White said.
White is currently designing a strategy to

eliminate the weed, using a mixture of biologi
cal, chemical and manual means. However,
reports of the weed spreading as far as the
Dish imply that the problem may be impossible
to wipe out, he said.
If the plant does prove impossible to elimi
nate, White suggests placing box communities
of weevils near known sites of infestation.
White would appreciate information con
cerning the puncture vine. The weed can
easily be identified by its sharp pointed seeds
and the fact that it does not do well with com
petition. It is usually found in bare patches.
