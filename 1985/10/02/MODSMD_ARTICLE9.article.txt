With the opening of a multidisciplinary clinical pro
gram for breast cancer patients this week, doctors at
the Stanford Medical Center say they will be initiating
an "ideal" approach to treatment of the disease.
The clinic, to be operated Friday mornings, will cen
tralize the processes of diagnosis and consultation by
bringing breast cancer specialists in the fields of oncol
ogy, surgery, radiology and medicine together rather
than having patients go from specialist to specialist
through a referral process, as is presently the common
procedure at Stanford and most other hospitals.
"It is the ideal way to treat breast cancer in that it is

a multidisciplinary disease," said Medicine and Oncol
ogy Prof. Frank Stockdale, director of the clinic.
Stockdale, who has been meeting with doctors from
three other departments over the past year to organize
the program, said this type of centralized diagnosis and
treatment planning is rare because few hospitals have
the personnel resources Stanford has.
He estimated that between 110,000 and 120,000
new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed in the
country each year. Fifty to 60 percent of are curable by
current methods, he said.
Stockdale added that because the methods vary
from surgery to radiology to medicine, a woman with
the disease usually has to consult separately with
several physicians before starting a treatment pro
gram.
