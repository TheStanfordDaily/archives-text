A STATE OF MIND...
A spirit of teamwork... a
drive to achieve... a talent for
discovery. We thrive on meeting the tough
energy demands of a changing world. We help
our people discover their energies with challenging
problems, diverse assignments, high mobility and
visibility, and salary and benefits among the best in the
industry. That's the Chevron State of Mind... searching,
energetic, progressive. It's resulted in an impressive list of
accomplishments over our one-hundred-year history. We
were the first to find large oil reserves in Saudi Arabia and
we discovered the largest new field since Alaska's North
Slope — giant Point Arguello off the Southern California
coast. Recognized as a leader in exploration and production
technology, we brought almost a century of innovation to
the design and construction of giant offshore platforms in
the turbulent North Sea. More recently, our merger with Gulf
marked the largest acquisition agreement in the history of
American business. Now, we're looking for more good
minds — mechanical, civil, chemical, electrical and
petroleum engineers, and professionals who excel
in geology, geophysics, chemistry, computer
science, finance and accounting. Working
together, we plan to maintain a standard of
excellence unsurpassed among energy
corporations. The Chevron State of Mind...
it's the state of the art in the
energy business. Become a part
of it. Write: Manager, Profes
