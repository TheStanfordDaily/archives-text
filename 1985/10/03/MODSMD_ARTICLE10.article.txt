## Divestment Still Solution To Liberate South Africa 
### 
While I was in South Africa a year ago it was appar
ent that the level of conflict in that country was higher
than ever before. Yet that was only a beginning. The
protracted civil strife that South Africa has suffered
over the past year is unprecedented.
Many who helped me in my research efforts are now
imprisoned in a country that probably has the highest
per capita prison population in the world — a figure in
creasing every day.
Modise Khoza, a lawyer from Soweto fighting for the
right of mineworkers to be covered by workman's dis
ability compensation, is now behind bars. Marian
Jacobs, a childcare physician at the Crossroads squat
ter community and a member of the United Democratic
Front (UDF) to create a just and non-racial South
Africa, is also locked up.

VIEWPOINT

Under "normal" circumstances, those fighting for
justice in apartheid South Africa face regular harass
ment; under the present state of martial law in South
Africa, survival is a day-to-day proposition.
The violent attack upon the multi-racial UDF and
politically concerned lawyers, doctors, teachers and
clergymen has made government-initiated reform a
hollow plea. As a result, the argument that U.S. com
panies can serve as a progressive force operating in
South Africa (Remember Trustee James Ware's
speech at the public forum held last spring?) has suf
fered a near fatal blow as the South Africa military and
police have been utilized over the past few months to
imprison or murder those with whom the government
might have hoped to negotiate a credible political trans
formation.
For the U.S. business community to still believe
they belong in South Africa is to believe that they alone
can induce government reform while others who have
tried are being kicked in the groin.
Last spring, Business Week concluded that "if there
is no significant progress soon, U.S. companies will
have little moral or business reason to remain." Events
that have taken place since the state of emergency
make it all the clearer now that Pretoria will not wil
lingly cooperate in dismantling apartheid.
Students, confronted with what they can do to
relieve human suffering in southern Africa, have by and
large embraced divestment as a most significant action
in supporting the eradication of apartheid and the crea
tion of a free South Africa. University President and
Trustee Donald Kennedy told students last spring that
our energies, while well motivated, were misdirected.
He suggested that supporting federal legislation
against South Africa's government is the most produc
tive arena in which we can exert pressure. The irony of
this advice is that it is precisely through urging Univer
sity divestment that we have begun to reshape U.S.
foreign policy toward South Africa.
In examining the economic sanctions legislation on
Capitol Hill over the summer, I found anti-apartheid
movers in Congress expressing deep gratitude to stu
dents for our divestment activity on college campuses.
Senator Alan Cranston summed up this feeling that "if
it weren't for the grassroots pressure coming from you
students and the Free South Africa Movement, we
would still not be considering imposing economic sanc
tions against the South African government, despite its
stepped-up tactics of repression."
Cranston informed us that he personally urged Uni
versity President Kennedy and President David
Gardner of the University of California-Berkeley to

support total divestment. The parting message to us
from those in Congress seeking to put to rest the
Reagan Administration's "constructive engagement"
approach toward South Africa was "we need you to
continue your pressure for divestment when you
return to campus this fall."
After all, would powerful people like Derek Bok and
Donald Kennedy have publicly supported economic
sanctions legislation against South Africa if it weren't
for demands being made upon them to divest?
Trade unionists, political organizers, politically con
cerned professionals and even clergymen are now daily
in danger in South Africa. But that only scratches the
surface of the tragedy that continues in that country.
Alan Boesak, a clergyman and leader of the UDF,
came to the United States in late July and spoke out
courageously for strong measures, including divest
ment, to be taken against the apartheid regime in
Pretoria. He indicated that, as a result of his forthright
ness, he expected to be arrested upon his return to
South Africa. He was.
But Boesak urged us on that evening not to shed a
tear for him. He insisted that his own sacrifice was
very small compared to the price paid daily by innocent
victims of the apartheid system — those whose lives
are lost at the hands of police violence and by the more
insidious violence of enforced malnutrition in the rural
areas.
This is the more silent tragedy of apartheid that
rarely receives attention in our press.
Boesak related one incident to us, among the
thousands that deserve telling. It was one of many
times in recent months when he sought to comfort
grieving parents whose children have been killed by
police violence. The mother of six-year-old Johannes
Keppler showed Boesak the shirt her son had been
wearing when he was shot in the back by a policeman
who was patrolling the Alexandria township where he
lived.
Johannes had been playing in front of his house. The
bullet hit him from behind and went straight through his
body. Boesak noted the blood stains on the front of the
T-shirt that had a picture of a small bear and read
"Please take care of this bear."
Violence and repression in South Africa have yet to
reach a crescendo. As South African troops raid into
neighboring states and become an ever more visible
presence in black townships within South Africa, that
country falls deeper into civil and regional war. This
global tragedy must be confronted at all levels. Many
anti-aparthied activists in this country are mobilizing
material support for the liberation organizations oper
ating in Southern Africa. Such action will hasten the
destruction of apartheid, but is not sufficient in and of
itself.
Divestment remains the crucial means by which to
apply economic pressure (sanctions and disinvestment)
against the increasingly militaristic regime in Pretoria.
There was tremendous loss of life in the liberation
struggle that brought majority rule to Zimbabwe. If we
do not learn from that experience, the loss of life in
South Africa could be far worse. If the West does not
put severe economic pressure on Pretoria, armed
struggle will be the only remaining alternative, as it
was in Zimbabwe.
It is only through economic pressure that the South
African government's intransigence can be broken, and
therefore divestment remains an essential strategy of
the anti-apartheid movement.

justice in apartheid South Africa face regular harass
ment; under the present state of martial law in South
Africa, survival is a day-to-day proposition.
The violent attack upon the multi-racial UDF and
politically concerned lawyers, doctors, teachers and
clergymen has made government-initiated reform a
hollow plea. As a result, the argument that U.S. com
panies can serve as a progressive force operating in
South Africa (Remember Trustee James Ware's
speech at the public forum held last spring?) has suf
fered a near fatal blow as the South Africa military and
police have been utilized over the past few months to
imprison or murder those with whom the government
might have hoped to negotiate a credible political trans
formation.
For the U.S. business community to still believe
they belong in South Africa is to believe that they alone
can induce government reform while others who have
tried are being kicked in the groin.
Last spring, Business Week concluded that "if there
is no significant progress soon, U.S. companies will
have little moral or business reason to remain." Events
that have taken place since the state of emergency
make it all the clearer now that Pretoria will not wil
lingly cooperate in dismantling apartheid.
Students, confronted with what they can do to
relieve human suffering in southern Africa, have by and
large embraced divestment as a most significant action
in supporting the eradication of apartheid and the crea
tion of a free South Africa. University President and
Trustee Donald Kennedy told students last spring that
our energies, while well motivated, were misdirected.
He suggested that supporting federal legislation
against South Africa's government is the most produc
tive arena in which we can exert pressure. The irony of
this advice is that it is precisely through urging Univer
sity divestment that we have begun to reshape U.S.
foreign policy toward South Africa.
In examining the economic sanctions legislation on
Capitol Hill over the summer, I found anti-apartheid
movers in Congress expressing deep gratitude to stu
dents for our divestment activity on college campuses.
Senator Alan Cranston summed up this feeling that "if
it weren't for the grassroots pressure coming from you
students and the Free South Africa Movement, we
would still not be considering imposing economic sanc
tions against the South African government, despite its
stepped-up tactics of repression."
Cranston informed us that he personally urged Uni
versity President Kennedy and President David
Gardner of the University of California-Berkeley to

support total divestment. The parting message to us
from those in Congress seeking to put to rest the
Reagan Administration's "constructive engagement"
approach toward South Africa was "we need you to
continue your pressure for divestment when you
return to campus this fall."
After all, would powerful people like Derek Bok and
Donald Kennedy have publicly supported economic
sanctions legislation against South Africa if it weren't
for demands being made upon them to divest?
Trade unionists, political organizers, politically con
cerned professionals and even clergymen are now daily
in danger in South Africa. But that only scratches the
surface of the tragedy that continues in that country.
Alan Boesak, a clergyman and leader of the UDF,
came to the United States in late July and spoke out
courageously for strong measures, including divest
ment, to be taken against the apartheid regime in
Pretoria. He indicated that, as a result of his forthright
ness, he expected to be arrested upon his return to
South Africa. He was.
But Boesak urged us on that evening not to shed a
tear for him. He insisted that his own sacrifice was
very small compared to the price paid daily by innocent
victims of the apartheid system — those whose lives
are lost at the hands of police violence and by the more
insidious violence of enforced malnutrition in the rural
areas.
This is the more silent tragedy of apartheid that
rarely receives attention in our press.
Boesak related one incident to us, among the
thousands that deserve telling. It was one of many
times in recent months when he sought to comfort
grieving parents whose children have been killed by
police violence. The mother of six-year-old Johannes
Keppler showed Boesak the shirt her son had been
wearing when he was shot in the back by a policeman
who was patrolling the Alexandria township where he
lived.
Johannes had been playing in front of his house. The
bullet hit him from behind and went straight through his
body. Boesak noted the blood stains on the front of the
T-shirt that had a picture of a small bear and read
"Please take care of this bear."
Violence and repression in South Africa have yet to
reach a crescendo. As South African troops raid into
neighboring states and become an ever more visible
presence in black townships within South Africa, that
country falls deeper into civil and regional war. This
global tragedy must be confronted at all levels. Many
anti-aparthied activists in this country are mobilizing
material support for the liberation organizations oper
ating in Southern Africa. Such action will hasten the
destruction of apartheid, but is not sufficient in and of
itself.
Divestment remains the crucial means by which to
apply economic pressure (sanctions and disinvestment)
against the increasingly militaristic regime in Pretoria.
There was tremendous loss of life in the liberation
struggle that brought majority rule to Zimbabwe. If we
do not learn from that experience, the loss of life in
South Africa could be far worse. If the West does not
put severe economic pressure on Pretoria, armed
struggle will be the only remaining alternative, as it
was in Zimbabwe.
It is only through economic pressure that the South
African government's intransigence can be broken, and
therefore divestment remains an essential strategy of
the anti-apartheid movement.

While I was in South Africa a year ago it was appar
ent that the level of conflict in that country was higher
than ever before. Yet that was only a beginning. The
protracted civil strife that South Africa has suffered
over the past year is unprecedented.
Many who helped me in my research efforts are now
imprisoned in a country that probably has the highest
per capita prison population in the world — a figure in
creasing every day.
Modise Khoza, a lawyer from Soweto fighting for the
right of mineworkers to be covered by workman's dis
ability compensation, is now behind bars. Marian
Jacobs, a childcare physician at the Crossroads squat
ter community and a member of the United Democratic
Front (UDF) to create a just and non-racial South
Africa, is also locked up.
