Israel a Reliable
Middle-East Ally
I am very much surprised and
upset that you printed a calculated,
irresponsible hate letter against
Israel and America by O.L. Bran
naman (Sept. 24). He uses the
First Amendment to peddle his
pro-Arab admiration by advocating
that America stop aid to Israel. Yet
he does not complain about the
annual aid that Egypt receives,
which is about the same amount.
He also conveniently forgets to
mention that "America did not
create hostility" between Iran and
Iraq, which for years killed each
other's populations; or in Syria,
scores of whose inhabitants have
been massacred; or in Lebanon,
where different factions kill and
maim their neighbors and terrorize
civilians. Nor does he mention the
fact that Arabs kidnap innocent
individuals, threatening to kill them
if Kuwait does not release a score
of Arab murderers jailed there.
But Brannaman claims, "Arabs
cannot be blamed for it." He also
does not appreciate the fact that
President Reagan, the majority of
legislators and Americans know
that Israel is the only dependable
ally in the Middle East — and not
Brannaman's murderous Arab
friends! I hope your readers realize
the difference between the truth
and his poison pen contribution.

Most students know that the
United Stanford Workers (USW)
and the University are currently

involved in contract negotiations.
Many may not be aware that USW
is working without a contract and
could strike at any time.
Why? I don't know, at least not
exactly, and I would guess that
most students don't either. So, as
an ASSU senator, I felt it was my
duty to set up an educational forum
(not a debate) to present the posi
tions of each side. From this infor
mation, each student could then
have made up his or her own mind
and have decided upon a position.
When presented with this
prospect, USW was more than
cooperative and said they would
participate in any way the Univer
sity might require. Well, after
having my inquiries routed
everywhere from the President's
Office to the Office of Disabled
Students, I finally found someone
who would say "no" to me. It
seems the University prefers the
much safer track of having its posi
tion stated to 20 or 30 students in
the Soto lounge, a full week after
USW made a similar presentation.
Evidently, the University wishes
the bulk of the student body to be
ignorant of its position in these
negotiations. "We don't want to
endanger ongoing negotiations,"
they say. Why isn't USW afraid of
that? Why are we not permitted to
know the position of our univer
sity? I don't know. But I'd like to.

In "New Profs. Lured by Coin"
(Sept. 26), Robin Hamill, the
University's director of real estate
programs and lands management,

tells of the "major threat to the
quality of academic life at Stanford"
posed by the impact of the area's
housing costs on members of the
faculty. The University's response
to that 'threat' is in the form of
four programs "geared to help the
faculty deal with the greatly in
flated cost of housing." With these
programs — COIN, DPAP, HAP
and 10/30 — "the average profes
sor," according to Hamill, "is able
to buy twice as much house as he
or she could afford without them."
That's really great for the fac
ulty, but are they the only people
here who contribute to the quality
of academic life at Stanford?
Housing costs for non : faculty staff
are just as high, just as painful and
are not cushioned by a benevolent
university. It is in the University's
interest to try to attract to Stan
ford not only the best possible
teachers and researchers, but also
the best possible academic and
other support staff, without whose
efforts there would be little or no
teaching or research at Stanford.
The University should recognize
that we are all in the same predica
ment, and that it is not simply an
upper class of faculty members
that suffers because of the high
cost of living in this area.
A once-a-year free football game
on Staff Appreciation Day is a nice
treat and a good idea. An even
better idea would be to help all
staff to buy twice as much house
as they could otherwise afford or,
by some other means of assis
tance, to help non-faculty staff
come to (and stay in) the area so
that they might continue to make
their very significant contribution
to the mission of the University.

that? Why are we not permitted to

In "New Profs. Lured by Coin"
(Sept. 26), Robin Hamill, the
University's director of real estate
programs and lands management,

tells of the "major threat to the
quality of academic life at Stanford"
posed by the impact of the area's
housing costs on members of the
faculty. The University's response
to that 'threat' is in the form of
four programs "geared to help the
faculty deal with the greatly in
flated cost of housing." With these
programs — COIN, DPAP, HAP
and 10/30 — "the average profes
sor," according to Hamill, "is able
to buy twice as much house as he
or she could afford without them."
That's really great for the fac
ulty, but are they the only people
here who contribute to the quality
of academic life at Stanford?
Housing costs for non : faculty staff
are just as high, just as painful and
are not cushioned by a benevolent
university. It is in the University's
interest to try to attract to Stan
ford not only the best possible
teachers and researchers, but also
the best possible academic and
other support staff, without whose
efforts there would be little or no
teaching or research at Stanford.
The University should recognize
that we are all in the same predica
ment, and that it is not simply an
upper class of faculty members
that suffers because of the high
cost of living in this area.
A once-a-year free football game
on Staff Appreciation Day is a nice
treat and a good idea. An even
better idea would be to help all
staff to buy twice as much house
as they could otherwise afford or,
by some other means of assis
tance, to help non-faculty staff
come to (and stay in) the area so
that they might continue to make
their very significant contribution
to the mission of the University.

Israel a Reliable
Middle-East Ally
I am very much surprised and
upset that you printed a calculated,
irresponsible hate letter against
Israel and America by O.L. Bran
naman (Sept. 24). He uses the
First Amendment to peddle his
pro-Arab admiration by advocating
that America stop aid to Israel. Yet
he does not complain about the
annual aid that Egypt receives,
which is about the same amount.
He also conveniently forgets to
mention that "America did not
create hostility" between Iran and
Iraq, which for years killed each
other's populations; or in Syria,
scores of whose inhabitants have
been massacred; or in Lebanon,
where different factions kill and
maim their neighbors and terrorize
civilians. Nor does he mention the
fact that Arabs kidnap innocent
individuals, threatening to kill them
if Kuwait does not release a score
of Arab murderers jailed there.
But Brannaman claims, "Arabs
cannot be blamed for it." He also
does not appreciate the fact that
President Reagan, the majority of
legislators and Americans know
that Israel is the only dependable
ally in the Middle East — and not
Brannaman's murderous Arab
friends! I hope your readers realize
the difference between the truth
and his poison pen contribution.

University Silent
On USW Talks
Most students know that the
United Stanford Workers (USW)
and the University are currently

involved in contract negotiations.
Many may not be aware that USW
is working without a contract and
could strike at any time.
Why? I don't know, at least not
exactly, and I would guess that
most students don't either. So, as
an ASSU senator, I felt it was my
duty to set up an educational forum
(not a debate) to present the posi
tions of each side. From this infor
mation, each student could then
have made up his or her own mind
and have decided upon a position.
When presented with this
prospect, USW was more than
cooperative and said they would
participate in any way the Univer
sity might require. Well, after
having my inquiries routed
everywhere from the President's
Office to the Office of Disabled
Students, I finally found someone
who would say "no" to me. It
seems the University prefers the
much safer track of having its posi
tion stated to 20 or 30 students in
the Soto lounge, a full week after
USW made a similar presentation.
Evidently, the University wishes
the bulk of the student body to be
ignorant of its position in these
negotiations. "We don't want to
endanger ongoing negotiations,"
they say. Why isn't USW afraid of
that? Why are we not permitted to
know the position of our univer
sity? I don't know. But I'd like to.
