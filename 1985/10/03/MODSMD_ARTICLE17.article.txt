## The 						Moon, Radar, Instant Replay and World War II

The most exciting thing about original re
search is that "you have to work your way
through the jungle without any real- guid
ance, . . . without any book to look it up
in,"says research assistant Kurt Machein,
who currently prepares over 1,500
demonstrations each year for the instruc
tion of physics students here.

Machein has enjoyed great success in his
scientific explorations.
He is the father of the modern portable
video recorder. He pioneered in research
of a video disc recorder in the 1960s which
made possible the first close-up, live televi
sion pictures of the moon. And, he later ex
tended this research to the development of
the slow motion instant replay on televi
sion, for which he received an Emmy
award.
He has been working at Stanford in his

current position since 1978, work which
Machein calls "more a retirement job."
Machein says his inventing career has
reached an end. He values his video disc
work most highly, because he was "not im
proving" old technology, but developing "a
new concept."
Machein says he currently derives satis
faction from contributing "in any way to a
student's education."
Machein's career, a tribute to the posi
tive side of human originality, grew out of
an era that reflects the opposite side of the
creative drive. There were no books here
either, in which one could look up what
should be done next.
Soon after graduating with a B.S. in elec
trical engineering from the College of Engi
neering in Stettin, Germany, he was
drafted in the German Signal Corps. He
served two years active duty on the Rus
sian front and was discharged in 1943.
He was then assigned, as a civilian, to
the Federal Center for High Frequency Re
search, which was run under the auspices
of the German Luftwaffe (air force). He
worked here until the end of the war on the
development of a radar system, which
failed ever to reach the production stage.
Machein worked for several years follow
ing the war in Germany, although he "made
his decision to leave Germany shortly after
the end of the war."
When he finally obtained a visa in 1954,
Machein came to work in America, hoping
to escape the stifling working conditions for
a scientist in post-war Germany. He found
his first job at Stanford in that year, and
later went to work in the corporate field un

til retiring in 1975.
During the war years, Machein recalls
himself as a "green young recruit."
"I had no idea where my career would
take me," he says."I hadn't recognized
how much creativity I would develop."
In reflecting on his work to develop Ger
man radar, Machein says he feels there was
"nothing immoral about it."
"At least the army gave you food and
clothing," Machein says. In 1943, when he
became a civilian, Machein no longer
received such supplies, and it was in that
year that the bombings of Germany began.
Machein was transferred from Berlin to
Landsberg in Bavaria due to the bombings.
Hitler, an Austrian immigrant, was im
prisoned in Landsberg after failing in his
first putsch, Machein recalls, "where it's
unfortunate they didn't keep him."
In the absolute dictatorship that ruled
Germany during the war years, Machein
says, "You didn't question anything."
"I may have been born many things,"
Machein observes, "but not a hero."
He adds, "If you're talking about the
welfare of your country, you're still talking
about your people. You have an obligation
to put your efforts to the benefit of your
country."
During wartime, Machein observes,
"You hardly recognize yourself. It turns a
person inside out."
Machein lost all his relatives except his
immediate family in the war.
The radar system that he helped develop
was "state of the art," but only prototypes
of the system were ever produced, accord
ing to Machein.

Radar is "a two-edged sword, used for
defense as well as aggression," Machein
says. But, the radar that he helped
develop, although accurate in its ability to
detect incoming objects, was "still jtoo cum
bersome to end up in an airplane" and thus
was "of a defensive character."
"I was working on a system that would
protect our cities. ... You saw the cities
burning," he says.
Machein says he felt identity with the
German people, not the goverment. Like
many fellow citizens, he "didn't share the
Nazi philosophy at all."

Andrea Backscheider, who aids Mac
hein in the preparation of physics
demonstrations.
Machein stresses that he has never intentionally undertaken a project
that would expressly do harm to other people.
Reflecting on current issues, Machein says, for example, that there are
"much more important things to research than nuclear weapons and
destruction.
"I personally would have had a hard time seeing those people working
on the atomic bomb (during World War II at Los Alamos) saying, 'drop the
whole thing,' " Machein acknowledges. "You can't apply normal standards
of thinking or emotion (to wartime)."
When Germany fell, the city in which Machein was residing was occupied
by the Americans. Koenigsberg, the city in which he grew up, was ab
sorbed by Russia following the war.
"I was living as a refugee in my own country (after the war)," Machein
says.
Although he felt strong identity with his citizens, Machein says he was
"bitter" at the conditions in which he found himself after the war. "I didn't
see much future in working for the occupying (American) army," he says.
Although leaving Germany behind (admittedly with some regret), Mac
hein brought his ideals with him.
According to foremen in German industry, "nothing was ever good; it
could always be better," Machein says. He says he was surprised when
starting to work in America that sloppily done work was considered accep
table.
Politics in the life of Machein have been complicated, too complicated
perhaps for the researcher. "Politics is of little interest to me," Machein
says. In research, however, Machein says he relishes in "finding a simpie
solution."
