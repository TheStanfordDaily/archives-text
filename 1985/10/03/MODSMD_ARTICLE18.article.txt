# CAMPUS COMPENDIUM

### 
No kegs is good kegs
No Kegs. Those words are
enough to send shivers down the
collective spines of Stanford's fra
ternities and the Stanford Band.
But at the University of Michigan,
those words are reality.
It seems that administrators at
Cousens Hall, a large campus dor
mitory, have decided that no kegs
is good kegs.
The problem with kegs, said
one administrator, is that "you
have to drink them down or they'll
go flat." No student would want
flat beer, so there's no choice but
to polish off any keg that's
started, no matter how few
drinkers are involved, the admin
istrator said.
Residents of the hall were —
surprise! — not too pleased with
the new policy, and some said
they would not have moved into
the hall had they known about the
rule.
Administrators are standing
tall, though, and say they'll con
fiscate any kegs they find. They
don't say, however, what they'll
do with the confiscated suds. Bot
toms up.
Woman gets trashed at UC
At UC-Berkeley, meanwhile,
fraternities have found them
selves in hot water again. Earlier
this year, one fraternity was pun
ished for an allegedly racist
Mexican theme party, but this
time the trouble involves un
pleasant interactions with the op

posite sex.
The problems range from
charges that one woman was
thrown down a 10-foot stariway at
the Kappa Sigma fraternity to alle
gations that Chi Psi fraternity
members dumped trash on a
woman at a party.
Berkeley administrators are
angry about the alleged behavior,
which prompted five assault and
harassment complaints in less
than a week. They've fined mem
bers of Chi Psi and are discussing
how to deal with other offenses.

'This is the most fun you'll ever have
with your clothes on,' one of the
ruggers told a sorority hopeful who
was, at the moment, under his
thumbs.

Social probation is being consid
ered for some of the houses, and
that has some of the fraternity
brothers worried: "Oh, wow, we
can't party for a month," one fra
ternity president said of his mem
bers' attitude toward probation.
Other fraternity members said
the whole issue is overblown.
"It's like a trend," Chi Psi Pres
ident Paul Krouse told The Daily
Californian. "Someone gets
trashed in the fraternities, and it's
in the paper the next day."

But, Krouse admitted, there
are some problems. "We don't
want a reputation for throwing
trash on girls," he said.
Rubbing ruggers raise riches
The Michigan Rugby Football
Club will do anything for a buck.
At least, that's what The Michi
gan Daily says.
When the ruggers needed a few
bucks last month, they set up
shop in the middle of campus, of
fering massages and conversing
for a low, low $1 each.

"This is the most fun you'll ever
have with your clothes on," one of
the ruggers told a sorority hopeful
who was, at the moment, under
his thumbs. "You look tense as
hell. . . . Rush got you down?
Relax."
The ploy worked. Final cash
figures aren't in yet, but they're
expected to be in the hundreds.
X-rated films stripped away
Debbie won't be doing Indiana
University this year.

• For the first time in several
years, campus groups have' no
plans to use X-rated films like
"Debbie Does Dallas" as fund
raisers.
New laws in Indiana make such
films illegal, and student groups
say they fear punishment from the
university even if the law doesn't
catch up with them.
The groups are not entirely
happy with their decisions,
though. They say X-rated films
have been one of the most
lucrative forms of fundraising in
recent years.
Paisley leaves its prints
Just one more from our friends
at the University of Michigan . . .
Look out plaid, watch out polo
ponies, paisley is back at Michi
gan.
From boxer shorts to wedding
invitations, paisley is taking Ann
Arbor by storm.
OK, for the uninitiated, here
we go. Paisley, according to
Webster's, is a Scottish term used
to describe anything having an
elaborate, colorful pattern of
swirls. Usually taking the form of
hundreds of tiny cornucopias per
square yard, paisley prints long
have been a mainstay of men's
neckwear. But now paisley is
everywhere — at least in Ann Ar
bor.

Paisley leaves its prints
Just one more from our friends
at the University of Michigan . . .
Look out plaid, watch out polo
ponies, paisley is back at Michi
gan.
From boxer shorts to wedding
invitations, paisley is taking Ann
Arbor by storm.
OK, for the uninitiated, here
we go. Paisley, according to
Webster's, is a Scottish term used
to describe anything having an
elaborate, colorful pattern of
swirls. Usually taking the form of
hundreds of tiny cornucopias per
square yard, paisley prints long
have been a mainstay of men's
neckwear. But now paisley is
everywhere — at least in Ann Ar
bor.

No kegs is good kegs
No Kegs. Those words are
enough to send shivers down the
collective spines of Stanford's fra
ternities and the Stanford Band.
But at the University of Michigan,
those words are reality.
It seems that administrators at
Cousens Hall, a large campus dor
mitory, have decided that no kegs
is good kegs.
The problem with kegs, said
one administrator, is that "you
have to drink them down or they'll
go flat." No student would want
flat beer, so there's no choice but
to polish off any keg that's
started, no matter how few
drinkers are involved, the admin
istrator said.
Residents of the hall were —
surprise! — not too pleased with
the new policy, and some said
they would not have moved into
the hall had they known about the
rule.
Administrators are standing
tall, though, and say they'll con
fiscate any kegs they find. They
don't say, however, what they'll
do with the confiscated suds. Bot
toms up.
Woman gets trashed at UC
At UC-Berkeley, meanwhile,
fraternities have found them
selves in hot water again. Earlier
this year, one fraternity was pun
ished for an allegedly racist
Mexican theme party, but this
time the trouble involves un
pleasant interactions with the op

posite sex.
The problems range from
charges that one woman was
thrown down a 10-foot stariway at
the Kappa Sigma fraternity to alle
gations that Chi Psi fraternity
members dumped trash on a
woman at a party.
Berkeley administrators are
angry about the alleged behavior,
which prompted five assault and
harassment complaints in less
than a week. They've fined mem
bers of Chi Psi and are discussing
how to deal with other offenses.

'This is the most fun you'll ever have
with your clothes on,' one of the
ruggers told a sorority hopeful who
was, at the moment, under his
thumbs.

Social probation is being consid
ered for some of the houses, and
that has some of the fraternity
brothers worried: "Oh, wow, we
can't party for a month," one fra
ternity president said of his mem
bers' attitude toward probation.
Other fraternity members said
the whole issue is overblown.
"It's like a trend," Chi Psi Pres
ident Paul Krouse told The Daily
Californian. "Someone gets
trashed in the fraternities, and it's
in the paper the next day."

But, Krouse admitted, there
are some problems. "We don't
want a reputation for throwing
trash on girls," he said.
Rubbing ruggers raise riches
The Michigan Rugby Football
Club will do anything for a buck.
At least, that's what The Michi
gan Daily says.
When the ruggers needed a few
bucks last month, they set up
shop in the middle of campus, of
fering massages and conversing
for a low, low $1 each.

"This is the most fun you'll ever
have with your clothes on," one of
the ruggers told a sorority hopeful
who was, at the moment, under
his thumbs. "You look tense as
hell. . . . Rush got you down?
Relax."
The ploy worked. Final cash
figures aren't in yet, but they're
expected to be in the hundreds.
X-rated films stripped away
Debbie won't be doing Indiana
University this year.

• For the first time in several
years, campus groups have' no
plans to use X-rated films like
"Debbie Does Dallas" as fund
raisers.
New laws in Indiana make such
films illegal, and student groups
say they fear punishment from the
university even if the law doesn't
catch up with them.
The groups are not entirely
happy with their decisions,
though. They say X-rated films
have been one of the most
lucrative forms of fundraising in
recent years.
