# Kennedy OKs SJC Ruling
## Microdisc, drunk driving decisions deemed 'deterrent' 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy
has accepted the Stanford Judicial Coun
cil's (SJC) recommendation that junior
Joseph Anderson face a stayed, one
quarter suspension for driving under the
influence of alcohol on campus last spring.
Kennedy's decision, released yester
day in a five-page memorandum by the
Judicial Affairs Office, also requires An
derson to "choose between a 40-hour
work fine or a monetary fine of $200" and
to "refrain from driving or storing a motor
vehicle" at the University.
"Conferral of (Anderson's) undergradu
ate Stanford degree will, of course, be
contingent on his satisfying" each penalty,
Kennedy said.
But the decision does not appear to in
dicate that all students arrested for drunk
driving on campus will be charged under
the Fundamental Standard. University of
ficials said individual circumstances will
determine whether or not a student is
charged.
Kennedy said, "I believe that Dean (of
Student Affairs James) Lyons makes a
powerful case for viewing drunk driving as
a Fundamental Standard violation per se.
On the other hand, I think the formula
proposed by the (council) for case-by-case
determination reasonably addresses our
serious concerns about this problem, and
I accept its recommendation."
In the same memorandum, Kennedy
also dealt with a case involving a Microdisc
contract violation by two students during
the spring of 1984. Kennedy agreed in
part with the council's recommendation
that "a one-quarter suspension and reim
bursement of any wrongfully gained eco
nomic benefit are appropriate standard
penalties."

According to the council, an intoxicated
Anderson violated the University's Fun
damental Standard on the night of April 17
when he drove onto the sidewalk in front
of Florence Moore Hall, backing into a
number of bicycles and then leaving the
scene without pausing.

The Fundamental Standard states that
"students at Stanford are expected to
show both within and without the Univer
sity such respect for order, morality, per
sonal honor and the rights of others as is
demanded of good citizens. Failure to do
this will be sufficient cause for removal
from the University."
Kennedy strongly disagreed with An
derson's claim that the University has no
authority "to redress student misconduct
in the driving of a motor vehicle on
campus" because University traffic policy
states that all penalties for such violations
are to be assessed by the appropriate
state court.
"The essence of the University's
charge against (Anderson) is that he
drove his car in a condition and in a man

ner inconsistent with the rights and
welfare of others on this campus, in viola
tion of University 'law' — the Fundamen
tal Standard. That his conduct also con
stituted citable offense under California
law is coincidental; it does not immunize
him from institutional accountability,"
Kennedy said.
"By the penalties invoked against
(Anderson), the (council) makes quite
clear the seriousness of this Fundamental
Standard offense," Kennedy stated. "I
concur in that judgment and the purpose
thus implied for the penalties — to deter
students from driving on this campus
while drunk."
Lyons, however, disagreed with Ken
nedy's assertion that the penalties will
serve as a deterrent against future cases
of drunk driving.
The penalties "will have a marginal ef
fect. I don't believe generally that
penalties deter behavior," Lyons said, al
though he was quick to note that penalties
are particularly useful in some cases.
Penalties "will at least free the institu
tion of that person for a while ... we can
get that person off of our streets," he
said.
Lyons said the suspension was stayed
because "it was a case of first impression
. . . what it did was say, This is a suspen
dable action, but because this was the first
case, we'll give you the benefit of the
doubt.' "
Lyons pointed out that "the rationale
(for the actions against Anderson) goes
way beyond drunk driving. It's the behav
ior itself, it's not what caused it."
"Stanford, as a community, has a
legitimate right to protect its primary pur
pose, which is being a university," Lyons
said.


James Lyons
Dean of Student Affairs
Lyons said that most cases,
however, do not involve the Funda
mental Standard.
In a 1981 drunk driving incident,
for example, the Fundamental Stan
dard was not applied. That accident
killed two students when the the
car they were riding in, driven by
an intoxicated student, crashed into
a tree on Campus Drive.
According to Lyons, the surviv
ing driver was "permanently
scarred" by the incident and "was
facing much more serious charges
Lyons also noted that in the An
derson case, a student filed a com
plaint against Anderson's behavior,
something that did not occur in
1981.
"We weren't laying back,
waiting" for an incident on which to
act, Lyons said.
Lyons also noted that "there has
been a greater amount of concern"
over drunk driving in recent years,
a fact that was probably in the mind
of council members.
Lyons said that the attitude with
which a student approaches an act
deemed questionable by the council
will affect any subsequent penalty.
Kennedy's statement on the
Microdisc contract violation per
tained to an incident in the spring of

1984 in which a freshman (student
A) allegedly convinced another stu
dent (student B) to sign a customer
order so that student A could get
two computers through the one
per-student discount program.
The students' names were not
released.
The terms of the agreement
state that equipment purchased is
for personal use only and will not be
resold or transferred to another
person for at least one year.
The council stated that "thpir
(the students') actions jeopardized
the rights of others to purchase
through Microdisc."
Kennedy stated that "student A
shall pay a fine equal to the differ
ence between the market price he
paid student B for the micro
computer and its fair market price
on the date of purchase."
Kennedy also said that both stu
dents "shall receive suspended
one-quarter suspensions. In addi
tion, I think it is reasonable,to
impose long-term disciplinary
probation on both students, not just
student A."
Both students also face their
choice of a 20-hour work fine or a
$150 fine to be paid by the end of
spring quarter.

memorandum will be published in
tomorrow's Daily. The remainder
will appear in Monday's Daily.

person for at least one year.
The council stated that "thpir
(the students') actions jeopardized
the rights of others to purchase
through Microdisc."
Kennedy stated that "student A
shall pay a fine equal to the differ
ence between the market price he
paid student B for the micro
computer and its fair market price
on the date of purchase."
Kennedy also said that both stu
dents "shall receive suspended
one-quarter suspensions. In addi
tion, I think it is reasonable,to
impose long-term disciplinary
probation on both students, not just
student A."
Both students also face their
choice of a 20-hour work fine or a
$150 fine to be paid by the end of
spring quarter.

will appear in Monday's Daily.
University President Donald Kennedy
has accepted the Stanford Judicial Coun
cil's (SJC) recommendation that junior
Joseph Anderson face a stayed, one
quarter suspension for driving under the
influence of alcohol on campus last spring.
Kennedy's decision, released yester
day in a five-page memorandum by the
Judicial Affairs Office, also requires An
derson to "choose between a 40-hour
work fine or a monetary fine of $200" and
to "refrain from driving or storing a motor
vehicle" at the University.
"Conferral of (Anderson's) undergradu
ate Stanford degree will, of course, be
contingent on his satisfying" each penalty,
Kennedy said.
But the decision does not appear to in
dicate that all students arrested for drunk
driving on campus will be charged under
the Fundamental Standard. University of
ficials said individual circumstances will
determine whether or not a student is
charged.
Kennedy said, "I believe that Dean (of
Student Affairs James) Lyons makes a
powerful case for viewing drunk driving as
a Fundamental Standard violation per se.
On the other hand, I think the formula
proposed by the (council) for case-by-case
determination reasonably addresses our
serious concerns about this problem, and
I accept its recommendation."
In the same memorandum, Kennedy
also dealt with a case involving a Microdisc
contract violation by two students during
the spring of 1984. Kennedy agreed in
part with the council's recommendation
that "a one-quarter suspension and reim
bursement of any wrongfully gained eco
nomic benefit are appropriate standard
penalties."

According to the council, an intoxicated
Anderson violated the University's Fun
damental Standard on the night of April 17
when he drove onto the sidewalk in front
of Florence Moore Hall, backing into a
number of bicycles and then leaving the
scene without pausing.

The Fundamental Standard states that
"students at Stanford are expected to
show both within and without the Univer
sity such respect for order, morality, per
sonal honor and the rights of others as is
demanded of good citizens. Failure to do
this will be sufficient cause for removal
from the University."
Kennedy strongly disagreed with An
derson's claim that the University has no
authority "to redress student misconduct
in the driving of a motor vehicle on
campus" because University traffic policy
states that all penalties for such violations
are to be assessed by the appropriate
state court.
"The essence of the University's
charge against (Anderson) is that he
drove his car in a condition and in a man

ner inconsistent with the rights and
welfare of others on this campus, in viola
tion of University 'law' — the Fundamen
tal Standard. That his conduct also con
stituted citable offense under California
law is coincidental; it does not immunize
him from institutional accountability,"
Kennedy said.
"By the penalties invoked against
(Anderson), the (council) makes quite
clear the seriousness of this Fundamental
Standard offense," Kennedy stated. "I
concur in that judgment and the purpose
thus implied for the penalties — to deter
students from driving on this campus
while drunk."
Lyons, however, disagreed with Ken
nedy's assertion that the penalties will
serve as a deterrent against future cases
of drunk driving.
The penalties "will have a marginal ef
fect. I don't believe generally that
penalties deter behavior," Lyons said, al
though he was quick to note that penalties
are particularly useful in some cases.
Penalties "will at least free the institu
tion of that person for a while ... we can
get that person off of our streets," he
said.
Lyons said the suspension was stayed
because "it was a case of first impression
. . . what it did was say, This is a suspen
dable action, but because this was the first
case, we'll give you the benefit of the
doubt.' "
Lyons pointed out that "the rationale
(for the actions against Anderson) goes
way beyond drunk driving. It's the behav
ior itself, it's not what caused it."
"Stanford, as a community, has a
legitimate right to protect its primary pur
pose, which is being a university," Lyons
said.


James Lyons
Dean of Student Affairs
Lyons said that most cases,
however, do not involve the Funda
mental Standard.
In a 1981 drunk driving incident,
for example, the Fundamental Stan
dard was not applied. That accident
killed two students when the the
car they were riding in, driven by
an intoxicated student, crashed into
a tree on Campus Drive.
According to Lyons, the surviv
ing driver was "permanently
scarred" by the incident and "was
facing much more serious charges
Lyons also noted that in the An
derson case, a student filed a com
plaint against Anderson's behavior,
something that did not occur in
1981.
"We weren't laying back,
waiting" for an incident on which to
act, Lyons said.
Lyons also noted that "there has
been a greater amount of concern"
over drunk driving in recent years,
a fact that was probably in the mind
of council members.
Lyons said that the attitude with
which a student approaches an act
deemed questionable by the council
will affect any subsequent penalty.

Microdisc contract violation per

1984 in which a freshman (student
A) allegedly convinced another stu
dent (student B) to sign a customer
order so that student A could get
two computers through the one
per-student discount program.
The students' names were not
released.
The terms of the agreement
state that equipment purchased is
for personal use only and will not be
resold or transferred to another
person for at least one year.
