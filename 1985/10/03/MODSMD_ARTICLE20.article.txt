# Springsteen in LA: Meet the New Boss

LOS ANGELES — There were times during Bruce Springsteen's per
formance at the Los Angeles Coliseum Sunday night when it seemed like
the Boss could play any arena that an architect could design. It didn't seem
to phase the 80,000 or so in attendance that Springsteen and his trusty E
Street Band were even smaller than the candy bars we all used to get on
Halloween.
The show started promptly at 6 p.m. Rock 'n' Roll Time — 7 p.m. or so
PDT — as twilight was falling in the Coliseum. There were no announcers
or spotlights when the band first appeared — a look through the binoculars
revealed eight or so people on stage who could have passed easily as tech
nicians until one of them put on his guitar, shouted "One! Two!" and yelled
out the opening lines of "Born in the U.S.A."
The first few songs were fast-paced, giving all those present ample op
portunity to dance. Things then quieted down a bit, as Nils Lofgren alone
accompanied Springsteen in "Johnny 99," one of two depressing, yet pow
erful, songs from his "Nebraska" album.
The emotional rollercoaster experienced with each of these up-down-up
cycles, multiplied through all 80,000 people, was tremendous. Each of
Springsteen's songs had a statement that was made exquisitely —
messages about war, the underprivileged and crime and criminals hit home
even more effectively than in their recorded versions.
Thankfully, the band didn't leave the cheering audience long before com
ing back for an encore. They performed five, count 'em, five songs, the
highlight of which was a 25 minute-long series of variations on "Twist and
Shout," accompanied by 100 percent audience participation in cheering,
clapping, hand-waving and whatever other mass maneuvers seemed ap
propriate.

LOS ANGELES — Four hours after taking the stage at the Los Angeles
Memorial Coliseum, Bruce Springsteen had shown 85,000 people why, 1
years after his first album, he has become the most popular singer in
Aincncd
From the opening chords of "Born in the U.S.A." through two sets and
three encores, Springsteen established a rapport with his audience that
many find difficult in 1,000-seat nightclubs, let alone cavernous footbaU
stadiums. He had the crowd repeating calls in the best tradition of a Cab
Calloway and let them fill in the vocals on the whole first verse of Hungry
Heart." Two large video screens on either side of the stage and a good
sound system helped, but mostly it was the honest charisma of a man un
concerned with airs.
If you were looking for a negative in the show, it was the lack of older
material. Nothing off his first two albums. Only two songs each from Born
To Run"and "Darkness on the Edge of Town."
That may have been dictated by an audience that would rise to its feet
for a current hit like "I'm Going Down," then politely sit down and wait for
Springsteen to finish "Thunder Road," the stirring climax to the two-hour
first set.
In fact, some of the crowd seemed very out of place. Maybe the concert
seemed out of place. Stars coming in limousines from Fantasyland to listen
to a man singing about the Heartland. Kids from the San Fernando Valley
letting up a cheer as Springsteen sang about the devastated Monongahela
Valley in"The River," one of the most contemplative moments of the
night.

The middle of the first set was
sit-down-and-think time. After
doing a couple songs from the
"Nebraska" album and a new song
about unemployed steel workers
from the Mahoning Valley migrating
to the oil fields of Houston entitled
"Seeds," Springsteen prefaced "My
Hometown" with a request for
donations to area food banks.
"Everybody wants to make their
home town a better place to live,"
he said.
The second set opened with a
rendition of "Cover Me" that incor
porated the screens to produce an
MTV video-like effect, ran through
old favorites like "Promised Land"
and new ones like "Pink Cadillac"
and closed with "Bobby Jean," the
10th song of the night from "Born in
the U.S.A."
"Born To Run,"the official song
of the youth of New Jersey, closed
the first encore, while "Twist and
Shout" and "Travellin' Man," both
cover tunes, highlighted the final
two.
On the whole, any Springsteen
concert is bound to be a show
worth catching. It's just that a foot
ball stadium in Los Angeles isn't the
nlace to do it.
