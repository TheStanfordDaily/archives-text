ABC — "How To Be a Zil
lionaire"
★ ★★
Howdy, disco citizens! It's back.
Among the Dead or Alives, the
Madonnas and the ABCs of the
world, all that nouveau disco is mis
sing as is John Travolta and gold
chains.
Just dress up in your favorite
fashion garment, go to a club and
order a pina colada. And while
you're there, ponder the fate of
bands like ABC. Sure, even their
first album qualified as anglodisco,
but at least their songs were first
rate and the discofication was less
obnoxious. No such luck nowadays.
After an experimental second al
bum, "Beauty Stab," which sold
poorly but at least didn't grate on
our nerves, ABC has come back
with a vengeance. About half the
songs are actually excellent — "Be
Near Me," "Millionaire" and "Vanity
Kills." In other words, all the
singles. The rest have been
reduced to a thudding, ridiculous

mess for none to enjoy and all to
hate.
These songs are why disco
sucked in the first place — so full of
preposterous overgrabs at coolness
that they would be funny if they

hadn't given you a headache. Way
down there, below the yells and
drums and basslines, there are
songs. Songs that aren't bad at all.
Somebody please — let them out.
Thompson Twins — "Here's to
Future Days"

Poor old synthpop. It seemed

like such a good idea when it first
became popular — lots of different
sounds, neat effects and high tech
gloss. And no need for all those ex
pensive session musicians, either.
Just the down payment on a
keyboard with lots of knobs, the
first book you had when you were
learning piano in grade school and a
contract with Arista.
Lots of bands have tried it, and
lots of them have succeeded. The
Thompson Twins' particular hook is
their curious ability to make simple,
meaningless melodies out of catchy
synth-sounds and quirky percus
sion, add goofy sound effects and
make it all sound together.
And they pull it off once in a while
— old hits like "In the Name of
Love" and "Hold Me Now" and new
ones like "Lay Your Hands on Me"
and "Doctor Dream." When the
Twins pull it off, they're a fun,
danceable band with very little to
say. When they fail, as they do all
too often here (especially on the
cover of "Revolution" which is quite
the waste), there's no reason to lis

ten at all.
With more catchy melodies and
less overdone effects and out-of
place guitar riffs, the album would
have made much more sense.
Maybe next time.

or danceworthy, but happy just the
same.
The lead single, "In Between
Days," is a fast, dance-oriented hit
that was obviously meant for
airplay. The rest, though less com
mercial, are more listenable, save
the few songs that still drone some
what and harken back to the bad old
days.
Overall, the sound is right in be
tween the Cure's danciest and its
gloomiest — a good niche when
you're not feeling peppy, but you're
not all depressed either. Just sit
down, relax, and play it (unless
Robert Smith's vocals bother you
too much). It can be listened to at
tentively, or it can blend into the
background. Whatever you want.
Either way you listen, you'll find it's
a good do-it-yourself, self-serve al
bum whose atmosphere is totally
unlike any music coming out of
Nashville this year, to say the least.

Despite its morbid title, this al

doom glamour rock on laughing gas.
Kinda fun, with little happy instru

contract with Arista.
Lots of bands have tried it, and
lots of them have succeeded. The
Thompson Twins' particular hook is
their curious ability to make simple,
meaningless melodies out of catchy
synth-sounds and quirky percus
sion, add goofy sound effects and
make it all sound together.
And they pull it off once in a while
— old hits like "In the Name of
Love" and "Hold Me Now" and new
ones like "Lay Your Hands on Me"
and "Doctor Dream." When the
Twins pull it off, they're a fun,
danceable band with very little to
say. When they fail, as they do all
too often here (especially on the
cover of "Revolution" which is quite
the waste), there's no reason to lis

ten at all.
With more catchy melodies and
less overdone effects and out-of
place guitar riffs, the album would
have made much more sense.
Maybe next time.

or danceworthy, but happy just the
same.
The lead single, "In Between
Days," is a fast, dance-oriented hit
that was obviously meant for
airplay. The rest, though less com
mercial, are more listenable, save
the few songs that still drone some
what and harken back to the bad old
days.
Overall, the sound is right in be
tween the Cure's danciest and its
gloomiest — a good niche when
you're not feeling peppy, but you're
not all depressed either. Just sit
down, relax, and play it (unless
Robert Smith's vocals bother you
too much). It can be listened to at
tentively, or it can blend into the
background. Whatever you want.
Either way you listen, you'll find it's
a good do-it-yourself, self-serve al
bum whose atmosphere is totally
unlike any music coming out of
Nashville this year, to say the least.

Despite its morbid title, this al
bum really isn't as doomish as one
might think. Rather, it's more like
doom glamour rock on laughing gas.
Kinda fun, with little happy instru
ments playing little happy major
chord melodies. Not really upbeat
