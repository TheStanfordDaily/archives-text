## Colleges Need To Clean Up 
### 
Cheating in college sports seems to be a constant
thing. Every year a couple of the team 6 in the Associ
ated Press Top 20 are on probation for one reason or
another. The message many get from this is that you
have to cheat to win, and you have to avoid getting
caught to stay off probation.
Sports Illustrated, which recently ran a special
report on the latest scandal at Texas Christian Univer
sity, listed a 10-point plan to deal with the problem.
The NCAA has already taken steps to deal harshly
with cheaters, taking away 45 scholarships from South
ern Methodist University over the next two years,
with a "death penalty" of suspending a program for two
years for repeated violations. The SI proposals merit a
closer look:
1. Sharply limit the number of athletes accepted as
special cases: SI proposes limiting special admissions
for athletes to twice the school's overall percentage. In

theory, these are used so that students from disad
vantaged backgrounds who show promise can be ad
mitted. Athletes may fall into this group, but academic
potential must be a criterion. The limit may help make
this the case.
2. Make freshmen ineligible for varsity sports: The
idea behind this is that low-profile freshman teams
would be less time-consuming. It fails, however, to
take into account those freshmen that can handle the
commitment of a varsity sport. It's the same principle
as making the drinking age 21 — put everyone at a dis
advantage to help those who can't handle it. It's a bad
idea. <> ,
3. Insist on satisfactory progress toward a degree:
Add a 2.0 grade point average requirement to total unit
requirements. An athlete should be making progress to
graduate in five years with at least a 2.0.
4. Make sports less time consuming: Proposals like
eliminating spring practice and extraneous meetings
may merit a look. Shortening the season seems ex
treme, though. Whatever the decision, the idea that
athletics must be subordinate to academics is not
negotiable.
5. Guarantee scholarships: A great idea. An athlete
is expected to make a four—year commitment to the
school, yet the school need only make him a one—year
commitment. Four-year scholarships are Stanford
policy; it should be NCAA policy as well. Additionally,
allow an athlete to transfer without sitting out a year if
his coach leaves or his school goes on probation.
6. Tie the number of scholarships to graduation
rates: This expands on the above. What should be done
is to allow an athlete one year on scholarship to
graduate after his eligibility expires. This would en
courage schools to help the athlete progress toward a
degree, if for no other reason than to free up a scholar
ship. No degree, no open scholarship next year.
7. Abolish athletic dormitories: Athletes should be
treated no differently than other students. Football
theme houses restrict what is supposed to be a
broadening experience.
8. Abolish anabolic steroids: If you read last week's
column, you know where I stand on this one. There
should be no opposition to this.
9. Eliminate trivial economic rules: First of all, ath
letes should be permitted to hold jobs during the year,
provided they are available to all students and pay the


JOHN
LIS
same for all students. Second, free-
T-shirt, free-car-ride, free-burger
and-fries rules for recruits verge on
absurdity, not to mention the near
impossibility of enforcement.
10. Make it illegal for a booster to
offer money to college athletes:
This would take a federal law, but it
may be necessary. The scandals at
SMU and TCU resulted from

boosters cheating, yet those
boosters went unpunished. If they
faced conviction, they might not be
so eager.
Whatever they decide, college
presidents must remember that
education is their primary mission,
not going to bowl games. College
students playing football is a good
thing. Academically deficient hired
hands out to make money for ath
letic departments by playing
football is not.
