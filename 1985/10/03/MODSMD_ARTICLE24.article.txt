# One Goal Beats Card
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
Inconsistency broke Stanford's back in yesterday's
1-0 home field loss to Pacific Soccer Conference rival
Fresno State.
The Cardinal, now 4-5-2 overall and 0-1 in the
league, played hard throughout the first half and
proved to be more than a match for the talented Bul
ldogs. Midway through the second half, however, Stan
ford faltered and Fresno took the advantage.
"We have a little tendency to get shook up once in a
while," Cardinal midfielder Tom Rafalovich admitted.
"When we do, we play kickball instead of soccer."
That's exactly what happened with about 30 minutes
remaining in the game. The Stanford players became
tentative and Fresno State (7-4, 1-0) began a furious
attack.
After 10 minutes of continuous pressure, the Bull
dogs finally broke the Stanford defense. Fresno
midfielder Randy Prescott delivered a direct kick from
40 yards out that skimmed over the logjam of players
at the top of the penalty box. The ball then bounced off
Bulldog forward Chris Ogbodo and landed right in front
of Fresno's Mark Masich.
Masich looked up to find only Stanford goalie Tom
Austin between himself and the net. Austin had no
choice but to charge and Masich snuck the ball to the
left of him and into the goal.
"We got sloppy on our passes at that point," Stan
ford Coach Sam Koch said. "But we came back strong
at the end and pressured them well."
Strong may be too weak a word to describe the
Cardinal's efforts in the last 15 minutes. Knowing that
it didn't matter if they lost by a score of 1-0 or 2-0, the
Stanford squad let it all hang out.
With the ball flying up and down the field, both teams
had scoring chances, but Stanford had the best of
them.
Cardinal freshman Luke Garrott ripped two shots
from 18 yards out, but one went high and Fresno goalie
Bo Hedden corralled the other.
Stanford senior Giancarlo Feruzzi also got into the
final action. With 12 minutes left, Feruzzi received a
lofting pass from fullback Marshall Monroe and punched
a grass-cutter towards the left corner of the goal.
The Stanford bench was poised to celebrate as the
ball rolled toward the open goal, but Hedden appeared
out of nowhere and tipped the ball just wide of the post.
"I really thought that ball was going in," Rafalovich

lost a heartbreaker to Fresno State 1-0. The Card maintained a scoreless tie until well into the
second half before it wearied and gave up the game's lone goal.
said. "It was such a pretty shot. It
would have squeaked right in the
corner."
Feruzzi wasn't finished yet. He
took the subsequent corner kick
and dangled it dangerously in front
of the net before Hedden batted it
away. Finally, Feruzzi hustled all
the way across the field to take the
resulting thi*ow in. His throw went

into midfielder Dave Daniels, who
rocketed a shot high and wide.
Stanford's defense wasn't too
shabby either. Goaltender Tom
Austin made two brilliant saves
early in the second half to thwart
Ogbodo, Fresno's second leading
scorer.
The Cardinal will definitely have
to start scoring if it is to win this
weekend.
"Right now we just have to start
thinking about Washington,"
