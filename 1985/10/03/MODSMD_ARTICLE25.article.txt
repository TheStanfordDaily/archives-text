# Giants will move to Oakland
## Lurie Says Farewell to Candlestick 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) % San Francisco Giants
owner Bob Lurie, saying good riddance to windy
Candlestick Park, announced plans yesterday to move
his team into the Oakland Coliseum with the A's for
three to four years until San Francisco builds a domed
stadium.
Lurie's plan to pay San Francisco "several million
dollars" to buy out his lease at Candlestick, which
expires in 1994, received the backing of Mayor Dianne
Feins tein.
Feinstein, who has been urging construction of
downtown domed stadium for three years, said she had
little choice once the Giants made up their minds to
leave, and the move just across San Francisco Bay was
the best alternative at the moment.
"The question is whether we are going to keep the
team here at all or create the kind of situation of hostil
ity in which teams make a move," Feinstein said.
"We've all watched these teams doing that across the
United States."
The mayor gave her support for a domed stadium
and hotel complex proposed by developer Peter
Stocker near the city's financial district, and refused to

consider any plans to move the team to San Jose. Talks
earlier this year about a proposed new stadium in San
Jose, about 50 miles south of San Francisco, broke off
when Feinstein threatened legal action.
Feinstein said Lurie must pay the city enough money
to cover lost revenues from rent and other operations
at Candlestick and to secure an option on a new
stadium site.
"The agreement should also require Mr. Lurie to
provide San Francisco with a deposit or a guarantee
repayable upon the team's return to the new stadium in
San Francisco," she said.
She said a committee of top city officials would
negotiate the agreement and pursue plans to build a
stadium, and that Lurie has agreed to help Stocker
build, own and operate the complex.
"This is the San Francisco Giants currently on sab
batical in the city of Oakland," she said, citing examples
of other sports teams around the country which play in
one city but call themselves by a larger city's name,
such as pro football's New York Giants and Jets, Los
Angeles Rams and Dallas Cowboys.

Pirates sold for $22 million
Meanwhile, another baseball franchise, the Pitts
burgh Pirates, were also in making news. A unique
public-private coalition committed to keeping the
struggling Pirates in Pittsburgh for at least five years
reached an agreement yesterday to buy the team from
the John Galbreath family and Warner Communications
Inc. for $22 million.
Mayor Richard Caliguiri, who has headed efforts to
keep the Pirates in the city they have called home since
1887, said the partnership will raise $50 million to buy
the team and cover anticipated operating losses
through at least the 1990 baseball season.
The public sector's estimated $25 million share may
be funded through the sale of municipally owned Three
Rivers Stadium, where the Pirates and football
Steelers play. The money raised from selling the
stadium would be loaned to the new partnership, Pitts
burgh Baseball Inc., which would own and operate the
team, Caliguiri said.
The coalition also would assume $7 million in debts
owed mainly to players who signed deferred contracts,
including former Pirates outfielder Dave Parker.
