# Fontana's Big On Heart

No credit. Academically, Stan
ford students can choose this op
tion. In athletics though, one has
no say over say over how much
credit one receives, and while
Stanford volleyball player Barbra
Fontana gets passes, she gets no
credit.
Strictly a team player, Fontana
never would ask to be singled out.
Nevertheless, her excellence on
the court deserves recognition.
Since she entered Stanford in
1983 season, the 5-foot-6 dynamo
from Manhattan Beach has con
stantly stunned players and
crowds with her powerful kills;
low, accurate serves and some
seemingly impossible saves.
"Exciting moves like these are
what we've come to expect from
Barbra," one loyal fan said.
Such expectations stem from

Fontana's own high standards of
personal excellence as well as her
successful past. "Barbra is a per
fectionist. She likes to do things
right or not at all. She puts a lot of
pressure on herself to do well,"
sophomore teammate Wendi Rush
said.
Natural ability, dependable
teammates and a knowledgeable
coaching staff are essential to any
player, but the fierce Fontana
drive comes from within.
In the seventh grade she first
applied this drive to volleyball.
She and her friends would play
during recess for fun. One year
later, her eighth grade team won
second place in the Junior Olym
pics.
From there Fontana's volleyball
career took off. Her high school
years were marked by stiff sum
mer competition on the local
beaches, hard work during
practice and steady improvement.

She cited her junior year at
Aviation High School in Southern
California as a particularly exciting
one. That year her team won the
prestigious California Inter
scholastic Federation (CIF) title
as well as the state champion
ships. Months later, Fontana was
named athlete of the year — the
first time her school gave the ac
colade to a junior instead of a
senior.
In her senior year, despite the
merger of Aviation with a larger
school, Mira Costa High, Fontana
was elected team captain and an
other first occurred. The coaches
unanimously decided to retire her
number.
At Stanford, she earned West
Coast Athletic Association Player
of the Week honors as a freshman
and Rookie All-American distinc
tion at nationals last year as a
sophomore.
Even with all these awards be

hind her, Fontana remains humble
and hard-working. "You will never
hear her brag," said Frank Bird, a
close friend of Fontana's. "This is
because she dedicates her efforts
on the court to the team."
Personal gain is not Fontana's
aim. "Most of all, I like a team
player — one who's not out there
for himself," she said.
"Barbra's greatest asset is her
versatility," said senior teammate
Terri Bryson. "She is potentially
one of the best all-around players
on both the front and back court."
In a word, Stanford Co-coach
Don Shaw described his junior
outside hitter as "valuable."
"Barbra does a little of every
thing well," Shaw said. "As an
outside hitter, Barbra has to be
prepared to take whatever she's
given, especially a badly passed
ball, and make it look good."
In a sport where 5-foot-6 is

considered small, Fontana must
compensate by being able to jump
higher and move more quickly than
taller players.
Besides skill, her teammates also
admire Fontana's spunk and sup
port on and off the court. "She's not
only fun to watch, but fun to be
with," said Rush. "Whether you just

want to talk or you're depending on
her to make a play, Barbra's there
when you need her."
And where will Fontana be after
graduation? "In the U.S., there's
not much to do with volleyball past
the collegiate level except possibly
coach or play for the national
team," Fontana said.
At this point she is looking past
these options and instead, toward a
different kind of court career. Fon
