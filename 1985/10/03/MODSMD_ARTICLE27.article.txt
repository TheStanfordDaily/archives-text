batter over the minimum in the first
six-and-two-thirds innings. Bobby
Grich singled with one down in the
second, but was out on a double
play. Black struck out five, walked
two and did not permit a runner to
reach second base.
Brett's inside-the-park homer off
Ron Romanick in the first inning
scored Lonnie Smith and Willie Wil
son as the Angels and Royals

worked themselves into a division
deadlock for the eighth time since
Sept. 18.
The Angels, who came to town
Monday with a one-game lead, will
pitch Don Sutton, 15-9, against
Danny Jackson, 13-12, in the finale
of the four-game series tonight.
The Angels then finish their season
with three games in Texas while
the Royals play host to Oakland for
three.
If they remain tied at the end of
the regular season Sunday, the
Royals and Angels will play a one
game playoff Monday in Kansas
City.
Black, who began the year as
Kansas City's ace but was almost
removed from the rotation, raised
his record to 10-15 with his finest
outing of the season. The slender
lefthander did not surrender a
second hit until Doug Decinces
grounded a two-out single in the
seventh. He then struck out Grich
to end the inning.
New York 5, St. Louis 2
ST. LOUIS (AP) — Dwight
Gooden threw a nine-hitter in pitch
ing the New York Mets to a 5-2 vie-

Tory over Joaquin Andujar and the
St. Louis Cardinals last night, cut
ting the Cardinals' lead in the Na
tional League East to one game.
Gooden was forced to weather a
ninth-inning jam, however, retiring
Tom Herr on a line drive to second
baseman Wally Backman with the
bases loaded and a run in.
The victory was the second
straight for the Mets over the Car
dinals in the three-game series,
which concludes tonight. The Mets
beat the Cards 1-0 in 11 innings
Tuesday night on Darryl Straw
berry's home run.
Gooden, 24-4 after his 18th win
in 19 decisions, had a string of 49
consecutive innings without giving
up an earned run snapped in the
second inning.
He walked four and struck out 10
in his 16th complete game of the
season, and he also drove home a
run.
Gooden has struck out 10 or
more batters 11 times this season
and 26 times in his career.
The Mets scored single runs in
the first, second and fifth innings
against Andujar, 21-11, then chased
him in the seventh.
