### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Orel Hershiser won his 11th consecutive
game to lead Los Angeles to a 9-3 victory over the Atlanta Braves
last night as the Dodgers became the first major league team to
capture a division title in 1985.
The Dodgers were assured the National League West title, their
third in the last five years, during the course of their game when the
Padres beat the second-place Cincinnati Reds 5-4 in San Diego.
Hershiser, 19-3 and unbeaten since July 7, limited the Braves to
four hits and one run, striking out seven during the six innings he
worked. He and most of the other Dodger starters were taken out of
the contest after the Padres-Reds result was announced.
Hershiser also contributed three singles, driving in Los Angeles'
first run, to tie the game 1-1 in the second inning. He opened the
gates for a four-run outbreak when he led off the fourth with a bunt
single.
