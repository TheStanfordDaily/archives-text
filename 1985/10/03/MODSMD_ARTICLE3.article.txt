# It’s the Campus Shell game
## State Lottery Kicks Off Today

Psst. Want a million bucks?
Step right up and join the crowd, the long
awaited California lottery begins today. And if
your number comes up, you could stand to win a
quick, cool $2 million. You could also lose the
buck you shell out for a ticket, but why spoil the
fun with the facts?
At 12:30 p.m. today, nearly 21,000 California
businesses, including the Shell station on
campus, will begin selling the $1 "California Jack
pot" scratch-off lottery tickets, which offer in
stant prizes of $2, $5, $100, $500, $1,000 and
$5,000.
The $100 winners will have a chance to partic
ipate in TV drawings beginning Oct. 21 for prizes
of $10,000, $50,000, $100,000 or $2 million.
That's the good news.
The bad news? You're 12 times more likely to
be killed by lightning than win the $2 million
prize.

Still, state lottery officials expect 13 million
adults — three-quarters of California's adult pop
ulation — to catch the betting bug before this
first version of the California lottery winds down
in a few weeks.
Today's kickoff comes more than six months
after the start-up date set by 5.2 million Califor
nia voters when they passed the lottery initiative
last Nov. 6, a delay caused mostly by Gov.
George Deukmejian's slow, methodical approach
to setting up the game he opposes.
California is the 20th state to jump on the lot
tery bandwagon, and ticket sales of $1 billion to
$2 billion annually should make the California lot
tery one of the world's biggest, officials say.
The state will start today with the popular
"instant-winner" style lottery and will adopt
more complicated computerized lottery games
sometime next year. Those later games could
offer jackpots of up to $100 million.
Roy Wicks, who works at Campus Shell, said
he is excited that the service station will be
among the 3,100 Bay Area firms selling lottery
tickets.

"There's a little gambling in all of us," he said.
"I'm not a gambler by any means, but it helps a
good cause, so why not?"
The "good cause" is California's public school
system. One-third of the lottery's gross sales
will go to public education in the state,
representing up to 4 percent of the existing state
education budget.
Lottery proponents say that boon for educa
tional funding is the big benefit of the lottery.
Lottery foes, however, say that the lottery is
nothing more than a dangerous offering to poor
Californians and compulsive gamblers.
Opponents call the lottery a "regressive tax,"
because, they say, it attracts primarily poor bet
tors who can least afford to take the 25-million
to-1 chance that they'll win the big prize.
If all 400 million tickets are sold for the first
game, about one in every 10 purchasers will win
the $2 prize. About one in every 100 will win the
$5 prize and about one in every 4,000 will win
$100.
