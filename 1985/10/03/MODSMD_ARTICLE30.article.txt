# Card Takes on Sacramento Today
## 
### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
Some things are just a mystery. One of
those things is Sacramento State's women's
soccer team, which the Cardinal will be facing
onMaloney Field at 3 p.m. today.
Women's soccer is a club sport at
Sacramento and apparently one that attracts
little interest on the Sacramento campus. A
call to Sacramento's sports information office

reveals neither the Hornet's season record,
nor their coach's phone number. The coach
works off campus, but no one seems to be
quite sure where.
Last year the Cardinal defeated the Hornets
by a score of 5-0 in a storm that second-year
Stanford Coach Helen Keohane said
resembled a "hurricane." Looking ahead to
today's match, Keohane said, "I assume they
haven't got that much stronger since last
year."
"I'm sure they've improved a little bit, but

it's hard to say," she said.
Two years ago, the Cardinal lost 1-0 in a
match they'd rather forget. They came into
the game looking for a win and headed home
with a loss.
With that bitter memory in mind, junior for
ward Betsy Swan was a little more candid
about what she's hoping for this afternoon.
"Last year we were ready to avenge, and this
year we're hoping for another scoring-fest,"
she said.
