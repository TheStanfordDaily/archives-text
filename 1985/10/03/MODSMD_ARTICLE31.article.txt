U.S. Reverses on Israeli Action
( WASHINGTON — The Reagan' Administration backed away yes
terday from its unqualified endorsement of the Israeli raid on the
Palestine Liberation Organization headquarters in Tunis and tried to
speak with one voice after top policy-makers had sharply disagreed
about the appropriate U.S. response.
Secretary of State George Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger were reported to have been upset by White House hand
ling of the U.S. reaction to the Israeli raid. Tunisian President Habib
Bourguiba also expressed "profound regret" and "great astonish
ment" at the White House justification of Tuesday's attack as a
"legitimate response" and "an expression of self-defense."
Bourguiba summoned the U.S. ambassador to the presidential
palace in Carthage yesterday and denounced the United States for
approving and possibly participating in what he called "cowardly Is
raeli aggression" against Tunisia.
The vehemence of the Tunisian president's rebuke reflected a
widespread feeling in Tunis that the precision of the Israeli bombing
of the headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization in a
southern suburb of Tunis Tuesday morning could not have been ac
complished without the help of the United States.
Shultz, who is in New York for the United Nations session, was
described by various Administration sources to have been upset by
the tone of the initial White House comments suggesting a total U.S.
endorsement of the Israeli action.
President Reagan, seeking to appease Arab outrage, sent Bour
guiba a letter of "sincere condolences" about the loss of Tunisian
lives in the raid. Administration officials also said the United States
"deeply deplores" the rising pattern of violence in the Middle East,
including the Israeli raid.
At the same time, the White House and State Department issued
statements saying that in light of repeated acts of terrorism against
Israel recently, "the air strike is understandable as an expression of
self-defense."
PLO chief Yasser Arafat told reporters yesterday that it was clear
from U.S. statements that the Israeli attack was "an Israeli-
American ambush against me." Arafat had just returned to Tunis
from Morocco when the attack occurred, but was not injured, he
said, because he was out jogging.
Arafat and other PLO spokesmen said that the organization would
have to review the whole Middle East peace process. The PLO
chief, along with Jordan's King Hussein, has, been pressing for a
meeting between a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation and the
United States as a preliminary step toward direct Arab-Israeli
negotiations. But Israel has made it clear that it fears such a meeting
might lead to U.S. recognition of the PLO.
Shultz Endorses Military Action
NEW YORK — Secretary of State George Shultz asserted yester
day that the United States must be prepared to use "direct military
action when necessary" to defend democracy around the world.
In a speech crafted to set the ideological dimensions of U.S.
foreign policy, Shultz said the nation must not only oppose Soviet
style communism, but also be prepared to . support democratic
change in countries such as South Africa, the Philippines and South
Korea, where authoritarian governments pursue pro-Western
policies.
The United States should use diplomatic means, he emphasized,
to encourage friendly but undemocratic governments to loosen their
grip. But he said armed force might be the only way to deal with
Communist governments or Communist-backed insurgencies.
"We cannot send American troops to every region of the world
threatened by Soviet-backed Communist insurgents, though there
may be times when that is the right choice and the only choice, as in
Grenada," he said in a speech to the National Committee on Ameri
can Foreign Policy.
Shultz drew a clear distinction between dictators in the Soviet or
bit and all others. Nevertheless, he pulled away from an earlier
Reagan Administration formulation that seemed to endorse pro-
Western authoritarian governments as unpleasant but necessary
counterweights to communism.
"Our national interests require us to be on the side of freedom and
democratic change everywhere, and no less in such areas of strate
gic importance to us as Central America, South Africa, the
Philippines and South Korea," he said.
"The best defense against the threat of communist takeover is
the strengthening of freedom and democracy," he said.
Gorbachev Meets Mitterrand
PARIS — President Francois Mitterrand and Mikhail Gorbachev
discussed the possibilities of "a serious, real reduction" in arma
ments yesterday, six weeks before the U.S.-Soviet summit.
Mitterrand's spokesman said the president and the Soviet leader
also touched on the Reagan Administration's "Star Wars" research
program for a space-based defense system in their first private
meeting.
Gorbachev is in France for four days, on his first visit to the West
since taking over as Kremlin leader in March.
He repeated Soviet opposition to the space-defense plan in his ar
rival statement, speaking of the need to prevent "an arms race in
space and end it on earth."
Mitterrand told him that "too many conflicts, suffering, attacks on
the dignity and rights (of man) are afflicting men today," presidential
spokesman Michel Vauzelle said. He described the two-hour, 15-
minute discussion as occurring in "a cordial atmosphere with a will
for better understanding, to explain oneself frankly without am
biguities, in mutual respect."
Vauzelle said the general discussion included "East-West rela
tions, the East-West arms balance, and more precisely that balance
in Europe, and how to engage in a process that would bring about a
serious, real reduction in arms and reduce tensions."
Vauzelle said "Star Wars," which is expected to be the central issue
at the summit, came up yesterday. Mitterrand opposes many facets
of the plan, but does not want to criticize it jointly with Gorbachev.
On Tuesday, Reagan invited France, Canada, Britain, West Ger
many, Italy and Japan, to meet him in New York Oct. 24 to discuss
the upcoming Reagan-Gorbachev summit. World leaders will "be at
U.N. headquarters on that day to mark the 40th anniversary of the
U.N. charter.
Mitterrand refused the invitation. French officials, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said it was more of a "summons" and, com
ing on the eve of Gorbachev's arrival, had to be refused.
