# Terrorists Kill Soviet Hostage
## 
### 
. BEIRUT — The body of a Soviet diplomat,
shot in the head at close range, was found yes
terday morning dumped in a wasteland south of
Beirut after a caller claiming to speak for his
Moslem fundamentalist kidnappers told a West
ern news agency where to look for it.
The caller, saying he spoke for the Islamic
Liberation Organization, threatened that the
three remaining Soviet hostages kidnapped here
Monday afternoon would be killed "one after the
other if the atheistic campaign against Islamic
Tripoli does not stop."
Syria, Moscow's closest ally in the Middle
East, has backed an offensive by leftist forces in
the northern city of Tripoli against strongholds of
the Sunni Moslem fundamentalist militia known
as Tawheed. The fighting, which began Sept.
15, has caused at least 200 deaths and has led to
the evacuation of many of the city's 700,000 resi
dents.
The killing of the Soviet diplomat, identified as
consular secretary Arkady Katkov, was followed
by another call to an American news agency in
the name of the previously unknown Islamic
Liberation Organization, warning that the Soviet
Embassy in west Beirut would be "demolished"
over the heads of "Soviet diplomatic staff and

members of the KGB," the Soviet secret police.
The caller set a deadline of 48 hours for the So
viet compound to be evacuated.
Soviet Embassy officials said there would be
no general evacuation of embassy personnel, but
other sources raised the possibility that nones
sential personnel would be withdrawn. Soviet
sources close to the embassy expressed fears
that "a hunt for Soviets has now begun. The sit
uation is very, very serious for all of us."
Although the authenticity of the threat against
the embassy could not be verified, security
around the well-guarded compound just off the
Corniche Mazraa was tightened. One source
close to the embassy said the warning was
"being taken seriously. We have taken security
precautions around the embassy with the help of
the Progressive Socialist Party, our friends."
Trucks of the party's Soviet-equipped Druse
militia, armed with heavy machine guns, were
moved into defensive positions around the em
bassy. ,
Soviet sources said that embassy officials
were "astounded by the assassination" of Kat
kov. "Yesterday,"the sources said, "the Syrians
guaranteed the safety of the four hostages. They
said everything was normal."

In Paris, where Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev arrived for an official visit, Kremlin spokes
man Leonid Zamyatin told a press briefing that
the Soviets have made a "request and a plea" to
Syria and to various Lebanese factions to obtain
the release of the remaining three Soviet
hostages. Zamyatin said that Moscow never puts
pressure on other countries but, he said, "We
have taken a series of diplomatic steps" and
"addressed a plea" to several parties for help.
Soviet sources here said that Gorbachev had
sent Syrian President Hafez Assad a letter Tues
day. "You can see what the response has been,"
one source close to the embassy said. "It does
not depend on Hafez Assad or Gorbachev but on
this band of gunmen holding the hostages."
Two other Soviet diplomats, commercial rep
resentative Valery Mirikov, 37, and Oleg
Spirine, 32, a press attache, and embassy
physician Nikolai Svirsky, were abducted at gun
point in two separate incidents Monday in the
first such operation targeting Soviet personnel in
Beirut.
"These hostages are not the last," said one
Soviet source here, who was among the officials
who identified Katkov's body at the morgue of
the American University Hospital.'
