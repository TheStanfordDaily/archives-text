# Rock Hudson Succumbs to AIDS

### 
BEVERLY HILLS — Actor
Rock Hudson lost his year-long
struggle against Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome yesterday,
dying of complications arising from
the incurable disease he had helped
bring to worldwide attention.
Hudson, 59, a longtime Holly
wood superstar who stunned the
world three months ago when he
disclosed that he had AIDS, died
quietly in his sleep at his home
here.
His publicist, Dale Olson, said
only members of Hudson's personal
staff were present.
Hudson had no close family and
memorial arrangements were pend
ing. A spokesman for Pierce-
Hamrock Mortuary said the actor's
remains were cremated shortly
after his death.
Friends said Hudson had discov

ered that he had the disease in mid
-1984, but chose to continue his act
ing career while secretly undergo
ing treatment. He appeared in 10
episodes of the prime-time soap
opera "Dynasty" last season and
was to have continued in his role.
By midsummer, this year,
however, ravages of the ailment
were plainly apparent. He flew to
Paris, where he entered the Ameri
can Hospital seeking experimental
therapy, but stayed just one week
before chartering a 747 to return
home for treatment at the Univer
sity of California, Los Angeles
Medical Center.
It was at this time that he
decided to disclose that he was suf
fering from AIDS — a little
understood and always fatal ailment
that strikes primarily at male
homosexuals, intravenous drug

users and hemophiliacs.
The reaction from Hudson's
friends — and fans — was immedi
ate, and heartwarming.

Cards and letters expressing
good wishes, sympathy and admira
tion arrived by the bag full and were
still coming at the time of his death,
while his movie colleagues rallied
for a star-studded benefit that
raised $1 million in his name for
AIDS research.
"I am not happy that I am sick,"
Hudson said in a message to the
gathering last month. "I am not
happy that I have AIDS, but if that
is helping others, I can, at least,
know that my own misfortune has
had some positive worth."
The news of his death brought
immediate expressions of grief,
with one of the earliest coming from
President Reagan.
"Nancy and I are saddened by
the news of Rock Hudson's death,"
the president said in a statement
issued at the White House.
