Tax Reform on Rocks
WASHINGTON — Congressional Demo
crats gave the first firm signal yesterday
that tax overhaul faces serious problems in the
House, where President Reagan is counting on
a victory this year that would put pressure on
the more skeptical Senate to approve the pro
posal.
House Democrats emerged from their
caucus on tax revision deeply divided and
skeptical about prospects for passage. Law
makers said that while many members fear
being blamed by the president for killing tax
overhaul, there was sharp disagreement over
how such a restructuring should proceed and
whether to use a tax-revision measure to raise
revenue and reduce the federal deficit.
"I think the plan's in deep trouble, and I
regret it," said Rep. William Richardson (D-
N.M.), a sentiment echoed by many attending
the two-hour closed caucus. "I think we
Democrats are underestimating the popular
strength of tax reform." Rep. Richard Gep
hardt (D-Mo.), an author of one of the major
tax-revision measures, acknowledged yester
day that passage of a tax plan faces major

stumbling blocks and said it is largely up to
Reagan to overcome them.
But House Ways and Mean Committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), a leading
Democratic spokesman for the tax plan, said
he was not discouraged by the caucus. "The
impression was there was movement to set
tax reform aside . . . that wasn't the consen
sus of the caucus," he said.
FBI Seeks CIA Officer
WASHINGTON — The FBI said last night it
has issued an arrest warrant for a former CIA
officer, apparently identified as a Soviet spy by
Vitaly Yurchenko, a high-ranking Soviet intelli
gence officer who defected two months ago.
Informed sources said the FBI has identified a
second CIA officer, apparently named by Yur
chenko, but has not yet taken action against
him.
The suspect being actively sought by the
FBI is Edward Lee Howard, 33, who fled his
home outside Santa Fe, N.M., two weeks ago
after FBI agents questioned his employer.
A federal official said yesterday that the

second former Central Intelligence Agency of
ficer has not fled the United States, but he
would not comment on whether efforts are
being made to place the man under surveil
lance or arrest.
While disclosures that CIA employees may
have been feeding information to the Soviets
have alarmed U.S. intelligence officials,
several of the officials said Yurchenko's defec
tion and those of other Soviet intelligence offi
cials in London and Athens represent a major
disaster for Soviet intelligence.
Stocks Take Tumble
NEW YORK — The stock market turned
lower yesterday, backtracking after a broad
rally in the previous session.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
12.32 on Tuesday, pushed ahead a few more
points in early trading. But by the close it was
down 7.28 at 1,333.67.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
reached 147.33 million shares, up from 130.24
million Tuesday and the heaviest total since a
159.92 million-share day on July 17.
