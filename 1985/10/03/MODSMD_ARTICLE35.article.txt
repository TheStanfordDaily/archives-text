Quake Hits L.A. Area
SAN BERNARDINO — A strong
earthquake rattled Southern California at 4:44
p.m. yesterday, but no damage was reported,
authorities said.
The quake measured 5.0 on the Richter
scale and was centered seven miles southeast
of San Bernardino, said Dennis Meredith,
spokesman for the California Institute of Tech
nology in Pasadena, a suburb of Los Angeles.
Seismologists believe the temblor was asso
ciated with the San Jacinto fault zone, a major
fault that runs near the San Andreas fault,
Meredith said.
The temblor was felt in downtown Los An
geles, about 60 west of the epicenter, and in
Santa Ana in Orange County, about 40 miles
southwest of the epicenter.
The quake lasted about 15 seconds and
there were no reports of damage or injuries.

Seat Belt Law Signed
SACRAMENTO — Saying he was taking a
life-saving step, Gov. George Deukmejian on
Tuesday signed a bill requiring most of Califor
nia's 17 million motorists and their passengers
to use seat belts or face possible fines.
The measure, A 827 by Assembly Speaker
Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) also mandates
passive restraints — most likely automatic
seat belts or air bags — in future California
passenger vehicles.
The Brown bill will make it illegal, starting
Jan. 1, for most drivers to operate a passenger
vehicle unless all occupants over age 4 use the
manual seat belts that are in newer model
cars, light trucks and vans.
Children who are under age 5 or weigh less
than 40 pounds are covered by another law
that requires them to be in child safety seats or
seat belts when traveling in a motor vehicle.
Drivers and passengers over age 15 who fail
to buckle up could be fined up to $20 or re-

quired to attend traffic safety school for a first
offense under the Brown bill. But a seat belt
citation could be issued only if a driver was
stopped for another offense.
Supporters of a seat-belt law predict that it
will save more than 1,000 lives a year and
prevent thousands or injuries.
Local Youth on Trial
SANTA BARBARA — Two military school
cadets, including a Palo Alto youth, testified
Tuesday that nine students formed a secret
society like one depicted in"The Lords of Dis
cipline" and, on a $50 bet, two members
showed them the body of a man they said they
had killed.
The testimony came during a Juvenile Court
hearing for two 17-year-old cadets at North
western Preparatory School who were ar
rested following the stabbing death of transient
Michael Stephenson, 29.
