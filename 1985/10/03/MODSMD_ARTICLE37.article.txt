It is your education. So I invite you to take full advantage of Stanford's
library services, which can enrich your education enormously. The Libraries
provide such an opportunity with a vast range of information on subjects
recondite, esoteric and commonplace. You will find more than books in the
Library: its staff include librarians with knowledge of dozens of languages
and of most academic disciplines. They are expert in finding appropriate
subject literature for your need, whether the information is in journal
articles, popular magazines, books, technical reports, manuscript and
archival sources, maps, motion pictures, or machine-readable data files.
With over five million volumes and three million microtexts, the resources
here are vast. And staff will help you access these as well as the occasionally
needed items in other North American research libraries.
Please ASK us. Let us know your informational needs. My colleagues and
I extend to you our welcome to the educational world of the Stanford libraries.
