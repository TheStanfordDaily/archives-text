### 
The Libraries
The complex of libraries at Stanford is divided ad
ministratively between the Stanford University Libra
ries and the Coordinate Libraries. The former is
administered through the Provost's Office and com
prises the Cecil H. Green Library, the J. Henry Meyer
Memorial Library, eleven research branches, and some
smaller branch libraries. The Coordinate Libraries —
Business, Law, Medicine, Hoover, and SLAC — report di
rectly to the school or institution of which they are a
part and, like the University Libraries, are open to all
members of the Stanford community.
FINDING LIBRARY
MATERIALS
The Online Catalog
Socrates, our online catalog, can be searched from
terminals located in Green Library, in Meyer Memorial
Library, and in all branches of the Stanford University
Libraries. This catalog contains records of materials
added to the Stanford University Libraries since 1972
and of the other campus libraries for a shorter period of
time. Socrates also contains records for all serials in the
Stanford University Libraries. Socrates is usually the
best place to begin your search for library materials.
This catalog is accessible outside the Libraries to
faculty, students and staff with terminals with modems,
including personal computers, and with computing ac
counts at I.T.S. Free accounts providing twenty-four
hour access may be obtained at the Privileges Desk in
Green Library or at reference desks in other campus li
braries.
Socrates was designed to be accessible to all library
users, regardless of computer experience. Inexperi
enced users can be self-tutored through use of printed
guides and by following instructions generated by
Socrates itself. Consult staff at the reference desks
about short instructional sessions, which are offered
throughout the year.
The Union Catalog
The union card catalog located in the East Wing of
Green Library contains cards listing most holdings of
the Libraries of Stanford. It provides many access points
(author, title and subject) to books, journals, and other
materials held by most Stanford Libraries, but with
only a single listing (generally author or title) for ma
terials in Jackson School of Business Library, Lane
Medical Library, Robert Crown Law Library, and the
Hoover Institution Library. There are no listings in the
union catalog for books in the Meyer Memorial Library
nor for most of the holdings located in the Jonsson Li
brary of Government Documents. Moreover, most of
the University's audio-visual materials, sound record
ings, the printed music collections, manuscripts and ar
chives, the holdings of the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Library, and many individual items issued in monograp
hic series or large microtext series will not be found
here. Please consult the handout entitled, "Comparison
of the Green Library Card Catalog and Socrates, the
Online Catalog," which is available near Socrates ter
minals. If you cannot locate the material you need, ask
for assistance at the reference desks.

Other Card Catalogs
Branch libraries and the Coordinate Libraries main
tain complete card catalogs which provide access to
materials housed in those particular libraries. Socrates
terminals located in branch libraries and some Coor
dinate Libraries provide access to materials added since
1972 and to most serial titles (see above, "The Online
Catalog" for a more complete description of Socrates).
Reference Services
Reference librarians throughout the library system
are expert in locating elusive library materials, in pro
viding instruction in the use of library catalogs — both
card and online — and in answering many other
questions involving effective use of the libraries. Utilize
this expertise and seek assistance whenever necessary.
Reference librarians and the curatorial staff (librarians
with responsibilities for the collections in particular
disciplines or geographical/language areas), also will
recommend appropriate strategies or techniques for
locating materials for research projects ranging from
term papers to dissertations. To arrange a consultation,
call the reference desk in the library serving your dis
cipline or call a member of the curatorial staff (see p.
3, The University Libraries' Collections and p. 5,
Area Studies for telephone numbers). Contact with the
subject specialist in your field will be extremely
valuable in helping you find research materials scat
tered throughout the library system. Many subject
specialists also prepare acquisition lists of recent selec
ted additions in a particular field. These lists are
available upon request from the "FLAC" (Foreign
Language and Area Collections) Office behind the Ref
erence Desk in Green Library.

Computerized
Literature Searching
Computerized literature searches provide quick
access to a variety of materials existing on virtually any
topic. The libraries at Stanford are able to access
hundreds of online (computer accessible) databases by
means of contracts with various information vendors.
Since these databases are produced by a variety of or
ganizations, their content, organization, and dates of
coverage vary markedly. In general, the end result of a
computerized literature search is a list of references to
articles, books, technical reports, conference proceed
ings, and other material which exists on the topic you
specify. Some databases also include abstracts sum
marizing the content of the reference. The titles
retrieved by the search may be held by Stanford, or ar
rangements may be made to obtain the material from a
document delivery service or on interlibrary loan from
another library.
Most libraries on campus restrict computerized
literature search service to current students, faculty,
and staff of Stanford. Charges for computerized
literature searches vary, but they are usually based on
the length of time a connection is made with the host
computer and the number of references retrieved. An
average computerized literature search in the social
sciences is about $35.00.
Searchers in the General Reference Department,
Green Library and in the research branch libraries will
discuss your search topic and help you find the re
sources available — whether in a printed index or in an
online database. They may also be able to help you find
sources to help you with the cost of such searches. If
you decide to have a searcher conduct a computerized
literature search, you are encouraged to make arrange
ments to be present during the search so that you can
provide the necessary feedback to tailor the search to
your needs. If another department or library has more
expertise on the appropriate database(s), you may be
referred to that location. Additional information can be
found in the brochure, Computer Search Services in
the Libraries of Stanford University. Copies of this
brochure can be obtained at most library reference
desks on campus or by contacting the General Refer
ence Department, Green Library, at 497-1811.
INTERLIBRARY
BORROWING
The Libraries at Stanford maintain extensive collec
tions of library materials to support curriculum and re
search needs. Moreover, faculty, registered students,
and staff who need research materials not available at
Stanford should consult with reference staff at the
campus libraries to determine the feasibility of submit
ting an interlibrary loan request. Faculty and graduates
with U.C. Berkeley/Stanford Research Library
Cooperative Program cards can request materials di
rectly from Berkeley by dialing 62-Baker on a special
telephone in Green Library. All faculty, students and
staff have access to library materials in the member li
braries of the Research Libraries Group as well as other
libraries throughout the country. The Interlibrary Loan
Division of the Stanford University Libraries is able to
acquire about 85% of the requested items, and many of
these requests are filled within two weeks.
