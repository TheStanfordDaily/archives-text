changes made by the Student
Conduct Legislative Council

The memorandum states that
under the new interpretation of

faculty procedures that create
temptations to violate the code.
According to the memoran
dum, the new wording expands

include failure to give clear direc
tions and instructions concerning
'the limits of acceptable col
laboration in course work.' "
The complete memorandum
will be published in Monday's
Daily.
