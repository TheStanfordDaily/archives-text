Stanford University Libraries are
committed to the Conservation of
Library Materials. Please help by:
1. Handling our many materials with care
2. Removing books from shelves
without pulling them at the top of the
spine.
3. Abstaining from food and drink
while using library material.
4. Refraining from the use of paper
clips and marking pens on books.
5. Photocopying, if necessary, without
pressing bound material flat.
6. Reporting damage so it can be
repaired.
