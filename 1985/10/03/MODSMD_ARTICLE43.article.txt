### 
Department of
Special Collections
The Department of Special Collections (Green Li
brary, West Wing, second floor) is the principal
repository for Stanford's holdings of rare books,
manuscripts, and other materials requiring special care
and knowledge. Ranging in nature and scope from third
century B.C. papyri fragments to early printed books
and modern literary manuscripts, the Department's col
lections are really a microcosm of the Library as a
whole. With some 90,000 printed volumes, 8.3 million
pieces of manuscript materials, and selective holdings
of maps, photographs, and ephemera documenting dif
ferent subject areas, Special Collections offers consider
able opportunities for research. When the Department
was established in 1948, its principal strengths were in
modern literature, the book arts, and Californiana.
Since then, its collections have expanded in size and
scope and now contain significant holdings in the his
tory of science, Continental history and literature, clas
sical literature and philology, children's literature, and
the Mexican American experience, among other areas.
Both the Central Map Collection and antiquarian maps
are housed within the Department.
University Archives
The University Archives (Green Library, Bender
Room, fifth floor) was established to preserve and make
available the historical record of the University and the
Stanford community. In this the centennial year of the
University's founding, the materials preserved in the
Archives serve to mark the growth and development of
Stanford. The papers of Stanford faculty members and
presidents, records of campus offices and student or
ganizations, Stanford family scrapbooks and photo al
bums, publications of all kinds produced on or about
Stanford, theses and dissertations, photos and slides,
maps, prints and posters which form the Archives have
provided researchers with invaluable tools. The collec
tion is particularly rich in materials about the histories
of science, architecture, higher education, and women.
Archive of
Recorded Sound
The Archive of Recorded Sound (Braun Music Cen
ter) houses more than 100,000 historically and artisti
cally significant sound recordings dating from the late
nineteenth century to the present. The collections in
clude classical and popular music, literature, drama, in
terviews, public addresses, and recorded Stanfordiana
in formats ranging from cylinders to compact discs.
Private and commercially produced 78 rpm and LP
discs and tape recordings comprise the majority of
holdings. Related print collections feature a wide range
of discographies, works on the history of sound record
ing and the record industry, and a collection of record
manufacturer's catalogs. Archive materials do not circ
ulate, but students and faculty may borrow tape copies
of recordings for research and classroom use.
