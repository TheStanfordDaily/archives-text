# City Council Wrapped Up in Cable

### DAN DeLUCE 
"A vast number of (cable)
franchises never live up to franchise
agreements," Economics Prof.
Roger Noll says. No one is more
aware of this than the Palo AJto City
Council.
The council has struggled this
week to choose a cable company to
service Stanford, Palo Alto, Menlo
Park and Atherton. City Cable
Partners and Cable Communica
tions Cooperative of Palo Alto, Inc.
are competing for the chance to
serve these markets.
"Both are tiny companies backed
by large national companies," said
Noll.
"In the long run the operating
company has a lot to say about their
(the smaller firms') character," he
said.
According to Noll, Viacom, which
backs City Cable, spun off of CBS
and has a large library of old movies
and shows. They have used the
profit of movie rentals, Noll said, to
produce their own programming.
"Viacom is like a network," Noll
said.

Noll predicted Viacom "will
charge lower prices for standard
access to mass media television
programming. They will not be ter
ribly innovative. Less
entrepreneurial, but lower prices."
Heritage, which backs Cable Co
op, "is oriented to hardware," Noll
said.
"They (Heritage) are smaller and
have less of a programming orienta
tion. They tend to have a good
reputation for service," Noll said.
Heritage, he said, is "expecting
to charge higher prices and use the
profit of standard television
services for subsidizing innovative
services."
But he added, "Systems that
have been the most innovative have
had the most financial difficulty."
He claimed programming-related
services and personal computer
networks have substantial initial
costs that are not sufficiently met
by subscriber response.
Noll said Stanford students will
receive a discount for cable service
and will have computer access to an
electronic newspaper network.
"The key issue," said council

member Gail Woolley, "is financial
stability."
"What happens when the com
pany we choose runs onto rocky
road?" asked city council member
Mike Cobb.
Public testimony, which was
closed after Monday night, included
several citizens who called for ad
vanced networking services.
A network allows a two-way
communication system between
personal computers. The cable
company would provide a two-way
wiring system. Cable Co-op has a
confirmed agreement with Pacific
Bell for two-way wiring in the Palo
Alto area, according to Lisa Van
Dusen, executive director of Cable
Co-op.
"Show me the marketing data
that people want all this stuff. Com
mercial television does pretty well.
People don't want to admit it,"
Cobb said.
"There's a lot of competition for
entertainment dollars in the Bay
Area," he said."l don't think this is
a good cable market."
Van Dusen claimed Xerox Palo
Alto Research Center and Foothill
Junior College have already ex

pressed interest in networking
services.
Because of Cable Co-op's alleged
innovative services,"it's out
rageous that Stanford hasn't stood
up and supported Cable Co-op,"
said Van Dusen.
Both companies have questioned
the other's financial stability.
Van Dusen claims City Cable's
subscriber projection is "overly op
timistic. "
She cited City Cable's service for
Mountain View as an example,
where "they were 10 percent
below their projection.
"One of the two owners of City
Cable really needs the money,
that's why he's pushing for the
agreement," said Van Dusen, re
ferring to co-owner Michelle Guite.
"Guite has never managed a
cable company in his life," said Van
Dusen.
City Cable could not be reached
for comment.
City Cable is a more traditional
company, controlled by a partner
ship. Cable Co-op is a cooperative,
whose subscribers would share in
the ownership of the company and select the board of directors. Cable Co
op leases its manufacturing plant, while City Cable owns its plant.
Woolley said Cable Co-op "has a real willingness to work for people and
to help people."
Cobb said a co-op's board of directors could become politicized at the
sacrifice of "good business decisions."
In the current proposal, City Cable's subscription projection is six
percentage points higher than Cable Co-op's projection.
