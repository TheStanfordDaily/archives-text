### LAIE CAINDEC 
Some make their mark on ath
letic fields, others on modeling run
ways, and one has his surname
marked on beer cans.
They are the "celebrities" of the
Class of '89, but there's more to
them than their famous names and
headline-grabbing activities.
Lani Kanehe is one of those
freshmen. A native of Manoa Val
ley, Hawaii, she was the second
runner-up in the 1985 Miss Teen of
Hawaii pageant.
The pageant, which she says
focused more on individual achieve
ments and personal strengths than
on "bathing suits and hair," was a
"learning and growing experience."
She said her high finish "really
boosted my confidence" and taught
her that "you can do anything you
want to."
With an eye toward pediatrics or
sports medicine, Kanehe said she
will pursue a pre-medical curricu
lum here.
The 1984 Miss Teen of America,
Debbie Brooks, 18, is also a fresh
man here.
Originally from Modesto, Brooks

points out that she "never expected
to become Miss Teen of California,
much less Miss Teen of America,"
in her August 1984 state and na
tional pageants.
Since her crowning, Brooks has
traveled all over the country, as
well as through Jamaica and parts of
Australia. During these trips she
has made as many as 25 public
speeches per weekend. Now,
public speaking comes easily,
Brooks said.
Looking back on her summer,
she said, "It's been really hectic. I
had never been away from home so
much."
The greatest challenge in holding
her title was merely accepting that
she was worthy of the crown and
then telling people that she was
Miss Teen of America, she said.
She is "way too self-critical," she
explained.
Her reign was a period of rapid
personal growth since her alterna
tives were limited to either "sink or
swim," Brooks said.
"It really helped me in planning
my time. You don't have time to do
everything. I've learned when to
say, 'No' and when to put things off.
It all works out," she said.

While she is here, Brooks does
not plan to deter her ambitions.
Since the pageant, she has become
interested in public speaking and
communications. With a gleam in
her eye, she says,"l want Dianne
Sawyer's (of 60Minutes) job."
Alongside some of this year's
beauties stand a handful of students
with athletic careers that are bound
to be noticed.
One such student Ray Huckes
tein, 18, one of the most promising
recruits for the Cardinal football
team.
Huckestein, number 53, plays
defensive noseguard. Huckestein
said he was "brought up on football"
in Pittsburgh, where "football is
really big." In Pittsburgh, he jokes,
"it was hard not to play football."
While at Stanford, Huckestein
does not intend to spend all his time
on the field. "The big reason I came
here is for the education," he said.
"You just can't beat the education."
While Huckestein's leans toward
electrical engineering, he is not bar
ring professional football from his
career plans. "It's a long way off,"
he says. "Right now, it's educa
tion."
When asked to consider how far

he would go with football, Huckes
tein replies with no hesitation, "I'd
go for as long as they d take me."
Another outstanding freshman
athlete is Morgyn Warner, 19, who
is from the city of Harare in Zim
babwe, Africa. Warner has been
training for the past four years as a
discus thrower. In Zimbabwe, she
holds the national record for throw
ing the discus 33 meters and 40
centimeters in the 16-and-under di
vision.
More recently, she threw a dis
cus 44 meters and 44 centimeters,
which earned her second place in
the Africa Championship in August.
As far as continuing to train at
Stanford, Warner says, "I'd like to
continue. I think the facilities at
Stanford are absolutely excellent."
She says the American competi
tion is better than what she's seen
before, but so is the coaching. "In
Britain, we don't have a coach as
such," she says. "What we have are
training partners. That way you
tend to get lazy."
From throwing discus and ac
hieving such uncommonly long dis
tances, she says, "you learn self

pic Swim Team.
discipline and patience and the will
to carry on with something even if it
doesn't come immediately. You
have to be persistent at it. It's per
sistence. "
It is this persistence that Warner
pians to apply to her studies. She is
wary, though. "I just hope there's
not too much of a conflict between
academics and sports."
She says she hasn't chosen a
major yet, but is interested in the
sciences and community service.
Still another freshman athlete
who is sure to improve on already
great times is Jenna Johnson from
Santa Rosa. Her nine-year swim
ming career has taken her all over
the world, most recently to Tokyo
and Kobe, Japan, for the Pan-
Pacific Meets and the World Univer
sity Games.
Johnson's competitive events are
the 50-meter freestyle, the 100-
meter butterfly and the 100-meter
freestyle (short) for which she
holds the American women's
record with a time of 54.4 seconds.
"Everytime I do a best time, it
encourages me," she says. "When I
go to the NCAA, I want to improve
my times. That's the only way I
know that I'm improving. I need all
the encouragement I can get."

Swimming on the Stanford swim
team was one of the goals that
Johnson hoped to achieve before
applying here. "I feel really
privileged to be on (the team)," she
said.
When asked about life at Stanford
so far, she smiles and says,"I think
it's awesome."
Outside of athletic or beauty
competitions stands a freshman
who will always wear prestige
merely by virtue of his name. Scott
Coors, 18, of the Adolph Coors
beer family, has come from Golden,
Colo., to begin his studies at Stan
ford. He emphasizes that he does
not wish to be recognized for just
his name. "I try to be myself
regardless of what anyone says or
does," he says. "You've got to be
you."
Although he grew up surrounded
by the massive Coors company, he
says he feels "like I've led a life
removed from it, with it always in
the background."
He is thinking of majoring in
chemical engineering, which could
lead him toward a position at Coors.
But if his academic plans lead him
away from Coors, he will not resist.
He says he is not "under immense
pressure" from his family to join the
company.
But what does he think of the
beer that bears his name?
"I like Coors," he says.

she said, "It's been really hectic. I
had never been away from home so
much."
The greatest challenge in holding
her title was merely accepting that
she was worthy of the crown and
then telling people that she was
Miss Teen of America, she said.
She is "way too self-critical," she
explained.
Her reign was a period of rapid
personal growth since her alterna
tives were limited to either "sink or
swim," Brooks said.
"It really helped me in planning
my time. You don't have time to do
everything. I've learned when to
say, 'No' and when to put things off.
It all works out," she said.

While she is here, Brooks does
not plan to deter her ambitions.
Since the pageant, she has become
interested in public speaking and
communications. With a gleam in
her eye, she says,"l want Dianne
Sawyer's (of 60Minutes) job."
Alongside some of this year's
beauties stand a handful of students
with athletic careers that are bound
to be noticed.
One such student Ray Huckes
tein, 18, one of the most promising
recruits for the Cardinal football
team.
Huckestein, number 53, plays
defensive noseguard. Huckestein
said he was "brought up on football"
in Pittsburgh, where "football is
really big." In Pittsburgh, he jokes,
"it was hard not to play football."
While at Stanford, Huckestein
does not intend to spend all his time
on the field. "The big reason I came
here is for the education," he said.
"You just can't beat the education."
While Huckestein's leans toward
electrical engineering, he is not bar
ring professional football from his
career plans. "It's a long way off,"
he says. "Right now, it's educa
tion."
When asked to consider how far

he would go with football, Huckes
tein replies with no hesitation, "I'd
go for as long as they d take me."
Another outstanding freshman
athlete is Morgyn Warner, 19, who
is from the city of Harare in Zim
babwe, Africa. Warner has been
training for the past four years as a
discus thrower. In Zimbabwe, she
holds the national record for throw
ing the discus 33 meters and 40
centimeters in the 16-and-under di
vision.
More recently, she threw a dis
cus 44 meters and 44 centimeters,
which earned her second place in
the Africa Championship in August.
As far as continuing to train at
Stanford, Warner says, "I'd like to
continue. I think the facilities at
Stanford are absolutely excellent."
She says the American competi
tion is better than what she's seen
before, but so is the coaching. "In
Britain, we don't have a coach as
such," she says. "What we have are
training partners. That way you
tend to get lazy."
From throwing discus and ac
hieving such uncommonly long dis
tances, she says, "you learn self

discipline and patience and the will
to carry on with something even if it
doesn't come immediately. You
have to be persistent at it. It's per
sistence. "
It is this persistence that Warner
pians to apply to her studies. She is
wary, though. "I just hope there's
not too much of a conflict between
academics and sports."
She says she hasn't chosen a
major yet, but is interested in the
sciences and community service.
Still another freshman athlete
who is sure to improve on already
great times is Jenna Johnson from
Santa Rosa. Her nine-year swim
ming career has taken her all over
the world, most recently to Tokyo
and Kobe, Japan, for the Pan-
Pacific Meets and the World Univer
sity Games.
Johnson's competitive events are
the 50-meter freestyle, the 100-
meter butterfly and the 100-meter
freestyle (short) for which she
holds the American women's
record with a time of 54.4 seconds.
"Everytime I do a best time, it
encourages me," she says. "When I
go to the NCAA, I want to improve
my times. That's the only way I
know that I'm improving. I need all
the encouragement I can get."

Swimming on the Stanford swim
team was one of the goals that
Johnson hoped to achieve before
applying here. "I feel really
privileged to be on (the team)," she
said.
When asked about life at Stanford
so far, she smiles and says,"I think
it's awesome."
Outside of athletic or beauty
competitions stands a freshman
who will always wear prestige
merely by virtue of his name. Scott
Coors, 18, of the Adolph Coors
beer family, has come from Golden,
Colo., to begin his studies at Stan
ford. He emphasizes that he does
not wish to be recognized for just
his name. "I try to be myself
regardless of what anyone says or
does," he says. "You've got to be
you."
Although he grew up surrounded
by the massive Coors company, he
says he feels "like I've led a life
removed from it, with it always in
the background."
He is thinking of majoring in
chemical engineering, which could
lead him toward a position at Coors.
But if his academic plans lead him
away from Coors, he will not resist.
He says he is not "under immense
pressure" from his family to join the
company.
But what does he think of the
beer that bears his name?
"I like Coors," he says.

Scott Coors, who doesn't want to be known for his name only,
holds up a bottle of his own "SC" brand beer.
Some make their mark on ath
letic fields, others on modeling run
ways, and one has his surname
marked on beer cans.
They are the "celebrities" of the
Class of '89, but there's more to
them than their famous names and
headline-grabbing activities.
Lani Kanehe is one of those
freshmen. A native of Manoa Val
ley, Hawaii, she was the second
runner-up in the 1985 Miss Teen of
Hawaii pageant.
The pageant, which she says
focused more on individual achieve
ments and personal strengths than
on "bathing suits and hair," was a
"learning and growing experience."
She said her high finish "really
boosted my confidence" and taught
her that "you can do anything you
want to."
With an eye toward pediatrics or
sports medicine, Kanehe said she
will pursue a pre-medical curricu
lum here.
The 1984 Miss Teen of America,
Debbie Brooks, 18, is also a fresh
man here.
Originally from Modesto, Brooks

points out that she "never expected
to become Miss Teen of California,
much less Miss Teen of America,"
in her August 1984 state and na
tional pageants.
Since her crowning, Brooks has
traveled all over the country, as
well as through Jamaica and parts of
Australia. During these trips she
has made as many as 25 public
speeches per weekend. Now,
public speaking comes easily,
Brooks said.
