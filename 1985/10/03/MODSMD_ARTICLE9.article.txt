## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Degrees Not For Sale 
### 
Last week, Tom Fantacone, a physics graduate
student, charged in a letter to The Daily that he was
being denied his master's degree solely because he
refused to pay an additional $1,650 in tuition to meet
a residency requirement, despite having completed
the required 36 units of study. Jim Moore, another
graduate student, added in another letter that a
graduate school is merely "an accounting operation
whose academic responsibilities and capacities are
nil." Under the circumstances, the charges appear
entirely appropriate, and the University has only it
self to blame.
It is surprising that a university celebrating a cen
tury of existence would rely on a tuition system so
open to criticism. University officials concede that a
lump sum residency payment of $1,650 is the only
barrier between Tom Fantacone and his degree.
How did this happen? Why is residency based on a
tuition value rather than a purely academic stan
dard?
The 1985-86 Stanford University Bulletin
clearly states that residence is "measured in terms
of full or partial tuition for Stanford registrations
rather than in units of credit." It further mentions
that a "tuition deficiency payment" may be required
if academic requirements are completed prior to the
residence requirements.
Nobody can question the validity of a residency
requirement to protect the academic quality and
reputation of a university degree. Likewise, nobody
can dispute that Stanford is one of the finest schools
in the country and that tuition is expected to be
high. The tragedy is the University's failure to adopt
a system that requires totally academic standards

for success and still collects the requisite tuition.
The problem involved is elementary arithmetic.
Had the University charged 75 percent of a full quar
ter tuition for 9 units instead of 62 percent, the lump
sum payment would not have been required. The
student could make no argument and academic ex
cellence would be preserved. Although this quick-fix
solution would undoubtedly not cover the entire
spectrum of individual situations, the point remains
that a system that eliminates the monetary
residency requirement should be devised.
A graduate school is not just another business. It
is a venerable institution of higher learning. The
selfless dedication displayed by both professors and
departmental staff reflects a devotion to student
welfare and increased knowledge not found in your
normal cost-cutting, cold-hearted business. Karlene
Dickey, the associate dean of Graduate Studies, is
quick to cite the personalized and professional help
provided by the graduate office staff to meet the
diverse needs of graduate students. Unlike Har
vard, M.I.T. or Princeton, Stanford is flexible
enough to allow students to be on partial tuition.
A college campus is perhaps the last place on the
planet where lofty ideals and Utopian optimism still
thrive. A degree represents hours of diligent study
â€” a supreme accomplishment. Since a college
campus cannot legitimately be compared to a ruth
less business, it is incumbent upon the University to
change its inappropriate residency requirements.
By reflecting only academic accomplishment,
charges that a degree can somehow be purchased
will be negated. The University owes it to every
thing a college degree represents.
