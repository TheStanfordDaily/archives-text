PRIVACY of RECORDS and
STUDENT DIRECTORY
1985-86
Tuesday, Oct. Bth will be the last day you can request
the Registrar's Office to suppress your address and/or
telephone information from the Student Directory and
public roster.
If you are unsure or want to confirm what information will
appear, you should check the public roster near the
Information Window in the lobby of the Old Union by Oct.
Bth.
The 1985-86 Student Directory will be available the third
week in November. The address and telephone information
will be taken directly from the information on your Permit to
Register (PTR), so if you have a new address and/or
telephone number, or address information that you wish
kept private, you should report it at the Registrar's
Information Window by the Bth.
