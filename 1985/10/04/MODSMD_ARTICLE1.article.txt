# Duke OKs Law on Streleski
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
A new state law that prohibits
any felon convicted of a violent
crime from returning to the scene
of that crime may keep recently
freed killer Theodore Streleski at
bay.
State Senate Bill 677, sponsored
by Sen. Robert Presley (D-
Riverside) and signed Sunday by
Gov. George Deukmejian, specifi
cally bars Streleski from returning
to the Stanford campus.
Streleski, who reportedly has
moved aboard a friend's 45-foot
sailboat at the Embarcadero Marina
in Oakland to take advantage of
what he called "very cheap
lodging," could not be reached for
comment.
Streleski was freed Sept. 8 after
serving more than seven years in
prison for the bludgeon slaying of
Stanford Mathematics Prof. Karel
deLeeuw in 1978.
He told several reporters last
month that he had no intention of
returning to Stanford, but said on
KGO-TV that he might come to
campus to use the University's li
braries.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington has said Streleski will
be arrested immediately if he ap
pears on campus.
Presley's bill was the result, in
part, of conversations between
Stanford officials and the state At
torney General's Office, according
to BflkJfciolmes, a staff consultant in
Presley s office.
Presley, a former under-sheriff
of Riverside County, has intro
duced several bills on criminal
justice in California.
The chief portion of Senate Bill
677 provides an appropriation of
$1,072,000 to the state Depart
ment of Corrections to prepare ar
chitectural and engineering
drawings to remedy structural
deficiencies at San Quentin and Fol
som prisons. Unrelated items are
often placed on one state bill.
