Despite University proposals on
every unresolved issue, lagging contract
negotiations with United Stanford
Workers (USW) advanced only slightly
yesterday.
Criticized by the union for not
"moving enough," the University of
fered a new proposal on grievance and

arbitration procedures but reaffirmed its
previous positions on job security and
wage and benefit increases yesterday.
The proposed grievance and arbitra
tion procedure is "pretty close to what
we think it should be," said Priscilla
Wheeler, staff counsel and chief
negotiator for the University.
"We proposed changes in areas (the
union) had expressed concern," Wheeler
said of the new offer.
Union officials, however, said the pro

posal was inadequate. "It didn't amount
to much, which is a far cry from current
procedure," said Mary Ann Tenuto,
chief negotiator for USW.
Wheeler said that after receiving the
University's proposals, USW negotiator
Linda Crouse accused the University of
"not making enough motion."
Both sides refused to move from their
positions yesterday on job security, a
key issue in the bargaining sessions.
Currently, the University is resisting

proposed union restrictions on both
outside contracting decisions and deci
sions concerning who should be allowed
to perform bargaining unit work.
Discussions regarding increases in
wages and benefits, crucial to the sign
ing of a new contract, also stalled in yes
terday's meeting.
The two sides agreed to hold a bar
gaining session on Monday and again on
Wednesday, Wheeler said.
