						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Bargain in Good Faith 
### 
The urgency of the contract negotiations between
the University and United Stanford Workers could
hardly be greater. The workers are currently with
out a contract (it expired Aug. 31), and rumors of a
strike are in the air. Both parties should work to
achieve an agreement as soon as possible in order to
put the entire Stanford community at ease.
This is not the first time the union and the Univer
sity have been at odds. Last fall, union members
voted to be represented by Local 680 in an election
whose legality was repeatedly questioned by the
University. USW officials retaliated, charging the
administration in general and University President
Donald Kennedy in particular with seeking to break
the union. Rather than waiting for a lengthy National
Labor Relations Board appeals process, the two
sides came to an uneasy truce, and a second elec
tion was called.
The University and the union continue to disagree
on an array of issues, ranging from dental care to
pension plans. The fundamental issue, however, is
job security. The University is calling for a contract
that allows for flexibility in the contracting out of
some jobs. The union claims such a provision would
free the University to lay off union employees — an
other attempt by administration officials to break the
union. The University has responded by describing

USW's insistence on increased job security as
motivated to increase membership in its bargaining
unit.
At this critical stage, efforts by both sides to ar
ticulate their concerns to the student body are im
portant, but must not interfere with serious
proposals designed to break the deadlock at the bar
gaining table. The practice of issuing joint press
releases after negotiating sessions may be one way
to avoid confusing the information the community
has a right to know — the issues at hand and the
bargaining positions of both sides — with the cir
culation of unilateral "factual accounts" that smack
of propaganda.
Two years ago, USW members left their jobs for
30 days in what became the longest strike in Stan
ford history. In the troubled days after the final
settlement, some USW members complained of ac
cepting an unfavorable contract in order to "feed
their families," in the words of one member of the
bargaining unit. Stanford suffered a loss of prestige,
and students, particulary incoming freshmen, had to
ride out a month in which many basic services, in
cluding food service, were unavailable.
There is a lesson here. A costly strike can be
avoided, but only if the University and the union
take the necessary steps to bargain in good faith.
