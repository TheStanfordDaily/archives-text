# Scientists, Help Fight Apartheid
## 
### 
This is a dangerous period for
opponents of apartheid, as reports
from and about South Africa drift
from the front page of newspapers
and from the highlights of the
evening news telecasts. Apartheid
is still very much festering in South
Africa, but apparently blood must
flow for attention and action to be
maintained.
While the campus was dormant
for the summer, some important
developments occurred. Prominent
among them were the withdrawal
of several companies from South
Africa, the action taken by the
French government and the de
cision of South African business
people to meet with some black
leaders in South Africa. Neverthe
less, there were many within this
country who felt that the call for

divestment and corporate
withdrawal would have no impact
on the Afrikaaner government. It
is not solely what effect divest
ment and withdrawal of all foreign
companies from South Africa might
have on all the people of South
Africa, if ever achieved, but what a
sincere and realistic threat to
divest and withdraw can ac
complish. Too much attention is
directed at the relatively small
percentage of black South Africans
who benefit from the presence of
foreign companies there; not
enough attention is given to the
fact that white South Africans are
not likely to allow their own eco
nomic well-being to be destroyed
to protect apartheid.
Apartheid will be destroyed, the
question is how, and when. It is on
this score that two horrible words
are being popularized, they are
"reform" and "gradualism." These
words remind one very much of

tne era preceding the civil rights
movement. The expressions then
were "it takes time" and, a little
later, "with deliberate speed" â€”
as if one's human rights must be
meted out over an indefinite period
of time by the inhumane individuals
who had taken those rights away.
There should be no delay and no
foot-dragging on the implementa
tion of "one man, one vote"
country-wide in South Africa. Much
alarm has accompanied the
propaganda that majority rule in
South Africa will result in the death
of many white South Africans.
South African whites who die there
will likely be those who insist on,
and acquiesce in maintaining and
prolonging, apartheid indefinitely.
Mr. Botha argues that one man,
one vote will result in black
dictatorship. What does he think
exists in South Africa now?
In the United States, the role
scientists play in the future of the

world, if there is to be one, is
becoming increasingly important.
Many of these scientists are asso
ciated with major research univer
sities such as UC-Berkeley, Cal
Tech, the University of Chicago,
Columbia, Harvard, MIT, Prince
ton, Stanford and Yale. These
individuals can make a difference if
they decide to cease supporting
the research efforts of companies
operating in South Africa. This
responsibility is just as important
as that many scientists recently
showed in their decision not to
support "Star Wars" research
efforts.
There is malnutrition and starva
tion in North Africa; racial discrimi
nation and genocide in South
Africa; "constructive engagement"
and "quiet diplomacy" in the White
House; and possibly "morals-blind"
research on university campuses.
