# Yes, Question Authority

"Question authority," he said. That's right. Donald
Kennedy, president of one of the most prestigious uni
versities in the Western world, told the Class of 1989
to "question authority." Far be it from me to contradict
the words of our president. By all means, question au
thority. After all, Don Kennedy said it, and Don Ken
nedy is an honorable man.
Question authority when it professes to celebrate
the wonderful diversity in the student body here. Ask
authority why this wonderful diversity was not present
here before 1968. Inquire of authority if it would have
started admitting students of color to Stanford if the
handful of black students who were here hadn't
snatched the microphone from the president of the
University at a convocation in the wake of Martin Lut
her King's death and demanded that Stanford admit
more black students. See what authority has to say
about having to be forced to create a diverse environ
ment.
While you're at it, ask authority if it truly values all
the cultures within this heterogeneous society affec
tionately called "The Farm." And if authority responds
affirmatively, ask it why the study of only one culture is

mandated for all students. Also, ask authority why the
culture that is singled out for intensive, year-long study
happens to be the culture from which the symbols of
authority at this university have sprung. Furthermore,
ask authority why there isn't diversity within the Board
of Trustees and the upper levels of the administration.
Let me know if authority thinks it can set policy for a
rainbow of cultures when authority itself is overwhelm
ingly monochromatic.
As long as you're on the topic of setting policy, ask
authority why the Board of Trustees continues to in
vest in corporations that support the most racist and
fascist nation on the face of the earth. When authority
in the form of the board says that divestment may not
be the best way to improve the situation in South
Africa, question that answer. Ask authority how it
knows better than the people struggling for freedom
what is best for the freedom struggle. See if authority
thinks that to ignore the pleas of the people of South
Africa — who are calling for divestment — is a rather
arrogant approach.
Speaking of arrogance, question authority's attitude
toward working class people in general and the United
Stanford Workers in particular. Tell authority that it's
your understanding that many people fought and died
for the right to unionize. Let authority know that you
were taught that the right to organize workers into uni
ons paved the way for the elimination of such evils as
the 12-hour workday, child labor and unsafe working
conditions. Challenge authority to tell you with a

straight face — as Donald Kennedy did last year —
that workers can be better represented by manage
ment than by a union. Ask authority if its antagonism
toward the United Stanford Workers has anything to do
with the fact that the membership is 50 percent black
and Chicano.
Question authority's relationship to the Hoover In
stitution. Ask if such an overtly political institution as
Ronald Reagan's think tank can be considered a center
of academic objectivity. Seek authority's opinion as to
the purpose of the Hoover Institution as put forward by
Herbert Hoover himself, that is, "to demonstrate the
evil of the doctrines of Karl Marx" (The Daily, April 19,
1983). See if authority can explain why the "Marx-
Engels Reader" is required for freshmen on a campus
that shares space with an institution whose primary
purpose is making anti-communism a respected aca
demic discipline. Question the motivation of Hoover
Fellow and Reagan appointee — that's the same
Reagan against whom 96 percent of Afro-Americans
voted — John Bunzel, who is doing a study on theme
houses at Stanford. Find out from authority when
Hoover became interested in the status of people of
color. Ask authority — or check out for yourself —
how many (or how few) people of color actually work at
Hoover.
So, yes, let us take President Kennedy's words to
heart — "Question authority . . . question it even if
everyone else is calling it dean or prez." Kennedy said
to question authority in order to "improve the quality of
dinner table conversations and other forms of dis
course." Sure, do that, but do much more. Question
the very foundations of this university and this society.
Question a society in which some people live in the
splendor of Palo Alto while others live in the poverty of
East Palo Alto. Question a world where some people
waste food and farmers are paid not to grow crops
while every day 40,000 people die of starvation. Ques
tion a government that spends $200 billion a year on
weapons of war when 35 million of its own citizens are
poor. And last, question your own role in maintaining
or changing the status quo.
Ultimately, the goal of our questioning must surpass
the desire to have good conversations at dinner. Our
questioning should lead us on an odyssey to the truth.
As we approach our destination, as we begin to dis
cover why things are so messed up, let us go beyond
questioning. At that point, let us act to make things
right. In the final analysis, we must not only be con
cerned with the quality of our discourse, we must be
concerned with the quality of life at this university and
on this planet.
President Kennedy said, "Don't forget that you are
here to change us." Don't worry, Mr. Kennedy. To the
extent that you and other figures of authority conceal
the truth and impede justice, people will seek to
change you. Kennedy concluded his speech the other
night by saying that "the higher purpose (of asking
questions) is to frame even better questions." Allow
me to question that. Isn't the highest purpose of our
sojourn at this university and on this earth to make this
world a better place to live?

voted — John Bunzel, who is doing a study on theme
houses at Stanford. Find out from authority when
Hoover became interested in the status of people of
color. Ask authority — or check out for yourself —
how many (or how few) people of color actually work at
Hoover.
So, yes, let us take President Kennedy's words to
heart — "Question authority . . . question it even if
everyone else is calling it dean or prez." Kennedy said
to question authority in order to "improve the quality of
dinner table conversations and other forms of dis
course." Sure, do that, but do much more. Question
the very foundations of this university and this society.
Question a society in which some people live in the
splendor of Palo Alto while others live in the poverty of
East Palo Alto. Question a world where some people
waste food and farmers are paid not to grow crops
while every day 40,000 people die of starvation. Ques
tion a government that spends $200 billion a year on
weapons of war when 35 million of its own citizens are
poor. And last, question your own role in maintaining
or changing the status quo.
Ultimately, the goal of our questioning must surpass
the desire to have good conversations at dinner. Our
questioning should lead us on an odyssey to the truth.
As we approach our destination, as we begin to dis
cover why things are so messed up, let us go beyond
questioning. At that point, let us act to make things
right. In the final analysis, we must not only be con
cerned with the quality of our discourse, we must be
concerned with the quality of life at this university and
on this planet.
President Kennedy said, "Don't forget that you are
here to change us." Don't worry, Mr. Kennedy. To the
extent that you and other figures of authority conceal
the truth and impede justice, people will seek to
change you. Kennedy concluded his speech the other
night by saying that "the higher purpose (of asking
questions) is to frame even better questions." Allow
me to question that. Isn't the highest purpose of our
sojourn at this university and on this earth to make this
world a better place to live?

"Question authority," he said. That's right. Donald
Kennedy, president of one of the most prestigious uni
versities in the Western world, told the Class of 1989
to "question authority." Far be it from me to contradict
the words of our president. By all means, question au
thority. After all, Don Kennedy said it, and Don Ken
nedy is an honorable man.
Question authority when it professes to celebrate
the wonderful diversity in the student body here. Ask
authority why this wonderful diversity was not present
here before 1968. Inquire of authority if it would have
started admitting students of color to Stanford if the
handful of black students who were here hadn't
snatched the microphone from the president of the
University at a convocation in the wake of Martin Lut
her King's death and demanded that Stanford admit
more black students. See what authority has to say
about having to be forced to create a diverse environ
ment.
While you're at it, ask authority if it truly values all
the cultures within this heterogeneous society affec
tionately called "The Farm." And if authority responds
affirmatively, ask it why the study of only one culture is

mandated for all students. Also, ask authority why the
culture that is singled out for intensive, year-long study
happens to be the culture from which the symbols of
authority at this university have sprung. Furthermore,
ask authority why there isn't diversity within the Board
of Trustees and the upper levels of the administration.
Let me know if authority thinks it can set policy for a
rainbow of cultures when authority itself is overwhelm
ingly monochromatic.
As long as you're on the topic of setting policy, ask
authority why the Board of Trustees continues to in
vest in corporations that support the most racist and
fascist nation on the face of the earth. When authority
in the form of the board says that divestment may not
be the best way to improve the situation in South
Africa, question that answer. Ask authority how it
knows better than the people struggling for freedom
what is best for the freedom struggle. See if authority
thinks that to ignore the pleas of the people of South
Africa — who are calling for divestment — is a rather
arrogant approach.
Speaking of arrogance, question authority's attitude
toward working class people in general and the United
Stanford Workers in particular. Tell authority that it's
your understanding that many people fought and died
for the right to unionize. Let authority know that you
were taught that the right to organize workers into uni
ons paved the way for the elimination of such evils as
the 12-hour workday, child labor and unsafe working
conditions. Challenge authority to tell you with a

straight face — as Donald Kennedy did last year —
that workers can be better represented by manage
ment than by a union. Ask authority if its antagonism
toward the United Stanford Workers has anything to do
with the fact that the membership is 50 percent black
and Chicano.
Question authority's relationship to the Hoover In
stitution. Ask if such an overtly political institution as
Ronald Reagan's think tank can be considered a center
of academic objectivity. Seek authority's opinion as to
the purpose of the Hoover Institution as put forward by
Herbert Hoover himself, that is, "to demonstrate the
evil of the doctrines of Karl Marx" (The Daily, April 19,
1983). See if authority can explain why the "Marx-
Engels Reader" is required for freshmen on a campus
that shares space with an institution whose primary
purpose is making anti-communism a respected aca
demic discipline. Question the motivation of Hoover
