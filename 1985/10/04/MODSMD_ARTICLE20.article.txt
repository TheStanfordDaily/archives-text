## YOU ARE HERE ... at the Archives 
### ROBERT ENO 
You Are Here is a conducted tour starting
here every Friday. It will transport you to the
most exotic points on the map of the Stanford
campus, allow you to meet the people there
and leave you with snapshots you can trea
sure for hours in the comfort of your own
dorm room. i

Mention the word "archives," and you
conjure up images of a dark, dingy
room, hidden deep in the catacombs
of some obscure library, where dust
covered volumes describing the distant
past are stored.
However, a visit to the Stanford Univer
sity Archives reveals a stunningly different
scene.
The first thing to strike a visitor to the
Timothy Hopkins Room, the Archives'
reading room, is the visual contrast be
tween the old and new.
The room is furnished with Victorian-era
chairs, oil paintings, a carved wooden
clock, velvet curtains, several busts of
Stanford personnages and a huge, mirrored
cabinet, most of which came from the home
of Hopkins himself, a lifetime University
trustee and a close friend of Leland Stan
ford.
Perched on antique tables are computer
terminals and printers, part of Socrates,
the library system's search computer and
an essential part of the archives.
This disparity is typical of the archives, a
department as committed to the future as
to the past.
In the last 10 years, the size of the ar
chives has quadrupled, so that the current
space in the reading room and three addi
tional offices is no longer adequate.
Some time before winter break, and pos
sibly as early as the end of November, this
congestion of Manila file folders will spread
out in the Bender Room, also in Green Li
brary.
The new location promises to be more
organized than the current setup, where

overcrowding pushes stacks of reference
material into office space and office workers
into the research area in the reading room.
The new rooms, currently under renova
tion, include a larger reading area and office
spaces, as well as areas for displays. This
will allow visitors to browse through
University-related materials without dis
turbing those using the research facilities.
The Archives' new home will also be

more accessible than the room in use now,
which is reached by a rickety path.
Rather than braving the labyrinthian
stairs and passageways to reach the Hop
kins Room, patrons will be able to enter
Green Library from the Quad entrance,
make a right turn and take the elevator di
rectly to the Archives.
Another indication of the library's push
toward the future is its increasing emphasis

on computers.
Soon, all of its materials will be listed on
Socrates, rather than the small fraction of
general publications currently in the
memory.
This will allow Socrates users from any
library on campus to tap into Archives re
dexes.
Founded in 1965, this storehouse of
Stanford lore serves as the "collective

memory" for the University. It actually has
several purposes, including processing
lectures and exhibits, obtaining and saving
new materials, serving as a resource for
those conducting research and supplying in
formation about Stanford.
In the course of daily University activity,
an enormous amount of paperwork is
generated. Eventually, almost all of it is not
needed, but it is up to the Archives staff to
decide what is of value.
For anyone interested in the Stanford
community, the Archives has tremendous
resources. Included in its 6 million volumes
are the private and business papers of
Leland Stanford, maps, photographs,
blueprints, oral history interviews with fac
ulty members, alumni and staff, letters and
scrapbooks of former students, Stanford
related publications, Big Game history and
back issues of The Daily.
The considerable size and duties of the
Archives require much effort. The depart
ment is staffed by four librarians, including
two professional archivists — Curator and
University Archivist Roxanne Nilan and As
sistant Archivist Linda Long — who are re
sponsible for maintaining the daily opera
tions of their oversized time capsule.
She and her staff agreed that one of the
benefits of their work is its extraordinary
variety.
According to the archivist, there are two
basic groups of people who commonly use
the Archives — researchers investigating a
specific aspect of the community and stu
dents or faculty members using the
facilities for research pertaining to papers,
theses or books.
Unfortunately, there is one group that
does not take full advantage of this unique
resource—undergraduates, she said.
She said she hopes that more exposure
in the future and the move to the Bender
Room will improve the situation.
"I wish that undergraduate students
would take better advantage of the Ar
chives. It is the history of those who make
up Stanford.. It is their history, too," said
Nilan.
