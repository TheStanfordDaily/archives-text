# Rod Serling Lives in 'The Twilight Zone'
## 
### RACHEL JOHNSON 
Do you remember the last time something really weird happened to
you?
Several weeks ago, my friends and I were watching a late flick on the
television when a strange noise emanated from the other part of the sup
posedly empty house: someone flushed the toilet.
While my friends sat in stunned silence, I whispered what every normal,
red-blooded American girl would whisper. "You have just crossed over
into 'The Twilight Zone.' Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do."
Since the early 19605, "The Twilight Zone" and its theme song have
been haunting the American public with the mysterious, the bizarre and
the horrifying.
After Rod Serling s death in July 1975, TZ fans have been forced to stay
up for late-night re-runs.
Many, like me, have yearned for the days when each week featured a
new, thrilling plot, guaranteed to make you stop breathing for 30 minutes,
excluding the commercials.
Last Friday we got our wish.
Sept. 24 marked the premier of the new "Twilight Zone" show. The
hour-long broadcast featured two different stories, produced by Phillip
DeGuere.
Serling s voice still introduces each story, seeming as if even death is
subject to strange permutations in "The Twiiight Zone."
Fridays stories featured captivating plot lines with the usual ironic
twists. Shatterdays," the first half-hour segment, revealed the despair of
Peter Novans, whose alter ego takes over his apartment.
The two Novanses have radically different personalities — one shoving
people to get to the payphone first; the other, inviting his dying mother to
live with him in the apartment.
Did the alter-ego become a living being by some real freak of nature? Or
did it merely symbolize the struggle of one man to rid himself of undesir
able elements in his nature?
The second story, "A Little Peace and Quiet," written by James
Crocker, also possessed elements common in the eariler shows.
In this segment, a busy housewife with four young children, a nagging
husband, a howling dog and a broken washing machine yearns for quieter
days — sort of a "Calgon, take me away!" syndrome.
Upon the discovery of a magical medallion, the housewife gains the
power she desires. When she yells, "Shut up!" everything stops, including
time. When she says, "Start talking," everything returns to normal.
For a while, she enjoys her new freedom to silence door-to-door
petitioners or her chattering family at the breakfast table.
When nuclear war breaks out between the Soviet Union and the United
States, however, she is faced with a difficult situation. Either she can suf
fer the horror of nuclear holocaust with her family or she can say "Shut
up," one last time, never to hear the sound of her family again.
I hate to ruin the ending for you, but the anguished housewife decides to

use the medallion, and the scene ends in a frozen world with the picture of
a nuclear missile suspended in mid-air over her once-bustling hometown.
It's at times like these that the frustrated onlooker yells at the TV, "No,
you can't stop now!"
The elements of drama which viewers loved in the orignal shows are
back. According to undeclared sophomore John Donald, who saw last
Friday's premier, the plot "harkens back to the days of the original
'Twilight Zone.' "
Many noticeable changes in production are evident, however. There is
the added benefit of color TV. While all the early episodes were in black
and white, the new versions have full-blown, vivid color.
The theme song was composed by Maurius Constant of Paris, who

created the musical theme as part of an international competition spon
sored by CBS. He was urged to create the theme for a show which would
feature unusual and bizarre stories set in everyday surroundings.
While the song remains virtually the same, the musical theme for the
new show is performed by the Grateful Dead.
For the time being, it seems "The Twilight Zone" will have to compete
with fraternity and dorm parties. If you get a chance before you go out
tonight, the show is on CBS at 7 p.m.
Oh, and as for the toilet flushing, I think I'll leave you to think on it for a
while. There's no telling what horrifying tales your imagination can create
in a place beyond time and space, in "The Twilight Zone." Do-do-do-do.
Do-do-do-do.


Taking five ori the set of "The Twilight Zone" is a disorienting
experience for Isabelle Walker, an actress in the second
episode of the new version of an old classic. This one, entitled

"A Little Peace and Quiet," let viewers experience the mental
crisis of a woman who uses her bizarre power to stop every
thing the moment before a Soviet bomb drops.
