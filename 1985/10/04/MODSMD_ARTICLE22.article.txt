# Nilsson Computes Future
## 
### JIMMY DEE 
If you do all your problem sets
for the next four years, you too
could be the new head of the
Computer Science Department,
just like Prof. Nils Nilsson.
Nilsson received all his ui 'rees
from Stanford, culminating n a
Ph.D. in electrical engineerii.t in
1958.
Most recently, he was in charge
of one of the nation's leading artifi
cial intelligence research laborato
ries at SRI International in Menlo

Park, where he maintained close
connections with the University.
Last fall quarter, when the de
partment found itself in need of a
new chairman, Nilsson became in
volved with the University once
again.
He said that the position is a
lot more work than he had ex
pected, though the work is enjoy
able. "I like the job. It's exciting,"
he said.
In keeping with the feeling of
progress he said he presently has,
Nilsson said he wants to keep the
department at the top of the com

puter science field.
He added that when the depart
ment starts to look for new faculty
members, he will try to hire not
only those professionals already
established in computer science,
but also the young aspirants who
are "going to be the stars in the
905."
Nilsson is also a freshman ad
visor at Otero this year. He said
he enjoys working with the stu
dents.
"Most of what I've learned
since I received my Ph.D., I've
learned from students," he said.
