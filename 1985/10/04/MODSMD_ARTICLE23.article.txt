## Schrader Flick Fails To Capture Real Mishima 
### STEVE WARRICK Staff writer 
Paul Schrader talks a great movie. At the press con
ference after an early screening of his new film,
"Mishima — A Life in Four Chapters," he came in
feeling tired and said he was nursing a cold. But once
he started talking about the style and content of his
new movie, the ideas he has about this film and all his
movies took hold, and he spoke eagerly for almost an
hour.
Schrader is obviously a very intelligent man, and
when he describes the character of Yukio Mishima that
he envisions, you want to rush out and see this com
plex, fascinating person transferred to the screen.
What you'll end up seeing, unfortunately, is a movie
that doesn't even get to the ideas Schrader suggests in
his interviews. It's stuck with the stale concepts we've
seen in some of his past films, particularly "Blue Col
lar," "American Gigolo" and "Cat People."
Compressing the life of any individual into a two
hour movie requires an inherent disrespect for the
boundaries of the art form. When the individual is a
complex, real-life personage like Yukio Mishima, the
filmmaker displays his disrespect for his subject as
well. Has there ever been a normal-length film that has
done justice to an entire life? "The World According to
Garp" treated the life of a fictional character in a novel
too long to be compressed for the screen. "Garp" suf
fered from the pitfalls inherent in its conception. It
seemed fractured and incomplete, and I was left won
dering why the filmmakers chose to leave in some mo
ments while removing others. The transitions between
major events in a life can be as important as the events
themselves; we never saw Garp grow as a character,
so the ways in which he responded to the unpredictable
situations of the plot were unpredictable and didn't
seem rooted in his nature.
This is part of the problem with "Mishima," but only
part. For the Mishima that Schrader describes in inter
views seems barely understood by anyone of any cul
ture. A Japanese novelist tremendously influenced by
Western culture as well as his own society, Mishima
died by seppuku, ritualistic suicide, in 1970 after a flam
boyant public life. He was body-builder and novelist,
Western-influenced yet fiercely loyal to his emperor.
He formed his own secret fighting cadre, the Shield So
ciety, devoted to the service of the emperor; this and
much about Mishima was more than a little crazy.
Today he is infamous in his own country and relatively
obscure in the West, though he is probably Japan's
most internationally famous modern novelist. Altoget
her, a difficult subject to treat in a movie.
Schrader developed the screenplay with his brother,
Leonard, and made the movie with a Japanese produc
tion team. Steering around the restrictions set by Mis
hima's widow on his family and sexual life and develop
ing a script with his literary executor (who is now suing

Schrader over the film) sounds like one of those
nightmare logistical tasks common in modern big
budget filmmaking. I wish I could say that the effort
was worth it. But I don't think the end product is a fail
ure that can simply be ascribed to the horrendous ob
stacles Schrader faced in making it. For stylistically,
the movie is pure Paul Schrader; Mishima functions as
an extension of Schrader's obsessions.
In part to get around the restrictions on Mishima's
estate, Schrader incorporates capsulized versions of
three of Mishima's novels into the flashback narrative
of the movie. The film begins and ends on the last day
of Mishima's life, and in these later scenes he is played
by the accomplished actor Ken Ogata. The novel seg
ments feature different actors in different characters,
but they're all meant to represent Mishima, and
Schrader ties the novels into the storyline by their
similarities to his life. Mishima stutters, and suddenly
we're in "The Temple of the Golden Pavilion," in which
the central character stutters. Mishima takes up body

building, and so does the character in "Kyoko's
House." Mishima forms the Shield Society, which is
represented in "Runaway Horses."
The idea of compressing these novels into 15-minute
summaries is almost completely unworkable. It yields
characters and ideas out of Cliff's Notes. These cap
sulizations are meant to display all the inner psycholog
ical dirt that Schrader couldn't present explicitly inMis
hima's life. But we're left wondering whether three dif
ferent novels might give a completely different picture
of Mishima. Can a man who has written 40 novels be
explicated in just three (or any) of his works? And, if
so, which three? The question goes back to the prob
lem of what to include, and it can't be coincidence that
the three segments Schrader included compress
themes he's developed before.
"Temple" concerns repressed sexuality and its
metamorphosis into violence, a subject which Schrader
dealt with in "Taxi Driver" and attempted in "Cat
People." "Kyoko's House" has the narcissistic, homo

erotic, self-destructive hero of "American Gigolo."
"Runaway Horses" has the bureaucratic oppression of
"Blue Collar." "Mishima" is like a compendium of
Schrader's past follies. He's giving both his interesting
and stale ideas a second chance, but they all sound
stale in this movie, because he doesn't ground them in
his central character.
In "Mishima," when you hear lines like: "A man's
need to become beautiful is always a desire for death,"
your eyes glaze over. They may be Mishima's words,
but it's Schrader hurling them at you without bothering
to shape their context. The novel segments (and the
flashback scenes too) are disjointed, because they
don't build toward their ideas or our understanding of
Mishima. Maybe it's just as well; pseudo-profundities
like, "Beauty and ethics are one and the same," sound
like they don't deserve build-ups. The last film
Schrader wrote and directed, "Cat People," made hash
of the storyline as well, so once again I don't think the
blame lies solely with the imposing scope of this
picture. As a director, Schrader hasn't grasped the
rudiments of narrative flow. Lately, this has spilled
over into his screenplays as well.
The entire flashback sequence has the static quality
of the primal dream segments of "Cat People." The
stylized Paul Schrader is like Ken Russell in slow mo
tion, but without Russell's energy. (There's a pedan
tic, pseudo-reiigious guilt that infuses both men's
films.) The characters in Schrader's "novel" scenes are
shot in Kabuki-style sets that are little exploding or
gasms of art, and the actors move amidst all this
stylization as if they were part of the set design,
detached and uninvolving.
Schrader can fool some people into believing that
he's really presenting the life of a great novelist; he got
some folks to believe that "Cat People" was about a
universal sexual mythology, or "American Gigolo" was
about anything. But I didn't find one real character in
"Mishima."
When Schrader claims that Mishima embodies a
clash between Western culture and traditional Japanese
values, you expect to see this in some form in the
movie. What he gives us is a brief montage of Mishima
traveling around the world, standing alone on cliffs in
Hawaii and Greece, contemplative and staring. This
doesn't sound like the jet-set publicity hound Schrader
has described.
Schrader says his movie is written and directed from
Mishima's point of view and that the hyperbole and
posturing are part of Mishima's vision of himself, of his
life. Schrader is flattering himself; he doesn't get inside
anyone in this movie. He keeps a clinical distance in
every scene, and the images are just psychedelic
postcards the camera swirls around. For all his time
and research and narrative risk-taking, Schrader has
made a timid movie. He's either not interested in or in
capable of presenting ar obsessive, unified vision of the
world according to Mi lima.

up before the temple to renew their vow to purge Japan of capitalist evils.

ference after an early screening of his new film,
"Mishima — A Life in Four Chapters," he came in
feeling tired and said he was nursing a cold. But once
he started talking about the style and content of his
new movie, the ideas he has about this film and all his
movies took hold, and he spoke eagerly for almost an
hour.
Schrader is obviously a very intelligent man, and
when he describes the character of Yukio Mishima that
he envisions, you want to rush out and see this com
plex, fascinating person transferred to the screen.
What you'll end up seeing, unfortunately, is a movie
that doesn't even get to the ideas Schrader suggests in
his interviews. It's stuck with the stale concepts we've
seen in some of his past films, particularly "Blue Col
lar," "American Gigolo" and "Cat People."
Compressing the life of any individual into a two
hour movie requires an inherent disrespect for the
boundaries of the art form. When the individual is a
complex, real-life personage like Yukio Mishima, the
filmmaker displays his disrespect for his subject as
well. Has there ever been a normal-length film that has
done justice to an entire life? "The World According to
Garp" treated the life of a fictional character in a novel
too long to be compressed for the screen. "Garp" suf
fered from the pitfalls inherent in its conception. It
seemed fractured and incomplete, and I was left won
dering why the filmmakers chose to leave in some mo
ments while removing others. The transitions between
major events in a life can be as important as the events
themselves; we never saw Garp grow as a character,
so the ways in which he responded to the unpredictable
situations of the plot were unpredictable and didn't
seem rooted in his nature.
This is part of the problem with "Mishima," but only
part. For the Mishima that Schrader describes in inter
views seems barely understood by anyone of any cul
ture. A Japanese novelist tremendously influenced by
Western culture as well as his own society, Mishima
died by seppuku, ritualistic suicide, in 1970 after a flam
boyant public life. He was body-builder and novelist,
Western-influenced yet fiercely loyal to his emperor.
He formed his own secret fighting cadre, the Shield So
ciety, devoted to the service of the emperor; this and
much about Mishima was more than a little crazy.
Today he is infamous in his own country and relatively
obscure in the West, though he is probably Japan's
most internationally famous modern novelist. Altoget
her, a difficult subject to treat in a movie.
Schrader developed the screenplay with his brother,
Leonard, and made the movie with a Japanese produc
tion team. Steering around the restrictions set by Mis
hima's widow on his family and sexual life and develop
ing a script with his literary executor (who is now suing

Schrader over the film) sounds like one of those
nightmare logistical tasks common in modern big
budget filmmaking. I wish I could say that the effort
was worth it. But I don't think the end product is a fail
ure that can simply be ascribed to the horrendous ob
stacles Schrader faced in making it. For stylistically,
the movie is pure Paul Schrader; Mishima functions as
an extension of Schrader's obsessions.
In part to get around the restrictions on Mishima's
estate, Schrader incorporates capsulized versions of
three of Mishima's novels into the flashback narrative
of the movie. The film begins and ends on the last day
of Mishima's life, and in these later scenes he is played
by the accomplished actor Ken Ogata. The novel seg
ments feature different actors in different characters,
but they're all meant to represent Mishima, and
Schrader ties the novels into the storyline by their
similarities to his life. Mishima stutters, and suddenly
we're in "The Temple of the Golden Pavilion," in which
the central character stutters. Mishima takes up body

building, and so does the character in "Kyoko's
House." Mishima forms the Shield Society, which is
represented in "Runaway Horses."
The idea of compressing these novels into 15-minute
summaries is almost completely unworkable. It yields
characters and ideas out of Cliff's Notes. These cap
sulizations are meant to display all the inner psycholog
ical dirt that Schrader couldn't present explicitly inMis
hima's life. But we're left wondering whether three dif
ferent novels might give a completely different picture
of Mishima. Can a man who has written 40 novels be
explicated in just three (or any) of his works? And, if
so, which three? The question goes back to the prob
lem of what to include, and it can't be coincidence that
the three segments Schrader included compress
themes he's developed before.
"Temple" concerns repressed sexuality and its
metamorphosis into violence, a subject which Schrader
dealt with in "Taxi Driver" and attempted in "Cat
People." "Kyoko's House" has the narcissistic, homo

erotic, self-destructive hero of "American Gigolo."
"Runaway Horses" has the bureaucratic oppression of
"Blue Collar." "Mishima" is like a compendium of
Schrader's past follies. He's giving both his interesting
and stale ideas a second chance, but they all sound
stale in this movie, because he doesn't ground them in
his central character.
In "Mishima," when you hear lines like: "A man's
need to become beautiful is always a desire for death,"
your eyes glaze over. They may be Mishima's words,
but it's Schrader hurling them at you without bothering
to shape their context. The novel segments (and the
flashback scenes too) are disjointed, because they
don't build toward their ideas or our understanding of
Mishima. Maybe it's just as well; pseudo-profundities
like, "Beauty and ethics are one and the same," sound
like they don't deserve build-ups. The last film
Schrader wrote and directed, "Cat People," made hash
of the storyline as well, so once again I don't think the
blame lies solely with the imposing scope of this
picture. As a director, Schrader hasn't grasped the
rudiments of narrative flow. Lately, this has spilled
over into his screenplays as well.
The entire flashback sequence has the static quality
of the primal dream segments of "Cat People." The
stylized Paul Schrader is like Ken Russell in slow mo
tion, but without Russell's energy. (There's a pedan
tic, pseudo-reiigious guilt that infuses both men's
films.) The characters in Schrader's "novel" scenes are
shot in Kabuki-style sets that are little exploding or
gasms of art, and the actors move amidst all this
stylization as if they were part of the set design,
detached and uninvolving.
Schrader can fool some people into believing that
he's really presenting the life of a great novelist; he got
some folks to believe that "Cat People" was about a
universal sexual mythology, or "American Gigolo" was
about anything. But I didn't find one real character in
"Mishima."
When Schrader claims that Mishima embodies a
clash between Western culture and traditional Japanese
values, you expect to see this in some form in the
movie. What he gives us is a brief montage of Mishima
traveling around the world, standing alone on cliffs in
Hawaii and Greece, contemplative and staring. This
doesn't sound like the jet-set publicity hound Schrader
has described.
Schrader says his movie is written and directed from
Mishima's point of view and that the hyperbole and
posturing are part of Mishima's vision of himself, of his
life. Schrader is flattering himself; he doesn't get inside
anyone in this movie. He keeps a clinical distance in
every scene, and the images are just psychedelic
postcards the camera swirls around. For all his time
and research and narrative risk-taking, Schrader has
made a timid movie. He's either not interested in or in
capable of presenting ar obsessive, unified vision of the
world according to Mi lima.
