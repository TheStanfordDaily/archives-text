# 'Adriana Lecouvreur' Provides Elaborate and Dramatic Opera
## 
### ELAINE WANG 
In opera one desires a grand ex
perience — both aurally and vis
ually. The voices must blend with
each other as well as fill the hall on
their own, and thus phrasing and
control are of paramount impor
tance. But since most opera-goers
aren't familiar with the foreign lang
uage (in this case, Italian), the per
formance must be as tale-telling as
a good pantomime. Even with a
general synopsis of plot in the pro
gram, the story does not live until
song and setting evoke tragedy or
comedy.
The San Francisco Opera's
"Adriana Lecouvreur" by Fran
cesco Cilea is a grand, harmonious
production. Each act has its lush,
colorful set to denote backstage at
the Comedie Francaise where ele
gant disarray prevails; the luxurious
Duclos villa, where Maurizio's poli
tical assignation with the princess
first threatens the love between
Adriana and Maurizio; the formal
pavilion where the prince and
princess entertain, and the scene of
Adriana's daring declamation of the
princess; and finally, Adriana's
living room, suffused by pale beige,
aqua and gold, where she dies,
having inhaled poisonous fumes
from flowers sent by the vengeful
princess.
The lighting is especially fine,
casting the players' shadows
against the walls, magnifying the

tense and threatening moments; in
the final scene, the lights are soft,
imbuing the walls with a watery pat
tern. Everything is light and irides
cent, making the final descent to
Adriana's death and the appropri
ately gloomy stage-lighting all the
more pronounced and harsh.
As the titular heroine, Mirella
Freni is a marvel. Her Adriana is at
first girlish and sweet, a young
woman in love with her soldier and
her art; as events become more
complicated and frenetic, jealousy
brings out a certain darkness of
spirit, building to her public denun
ciation of the princess. Freni is dra
matic and convincing, relying on
subtle gestures and vocal shading
to unfold the story of Adriana
Lecouvreur.
The same sensitivity to charac
ter, however, is not readily appar
ent in her romantic counterpart,
Maurizio, played by Ermanno
Mauro. Although he is clearly an ac
complished tenor with many leads
to his name, Mauro's movements
onstage are decidedly awkward and
rigid. His gestures are limited to
flinging both arms to the sides,
flinging one arm to the side and
bringing one hand to his heart; this
range of motion simply isn't enough
to accommodate the range of emo
tion that Maurizio must traverse.
Michonnet, played by Leo Nucci,
in particular fills out the plot with
the wistfulness of unrequited love.
Nucci, as the stage manager and

dear old friend of Adriana, has a full
and gentle baritone voice. His un
spoken love for Adriana is consis
tently apparent, and his hesitancy
whimsically appealing.
The Prince de Bouillon (Richard
Vernon) and his sidekick, the Abbe
de Chazeuil (Jonathan Green)
equally command the audience's at
tention. They are a funny pair, each
striking in his own way. Vernon is a
firm, sober nobleman; Green, in
contrast, is affected and simpering
as the fawning abbot. These are ef
fective performances backed by
strong voices.
The most unpalatable part of this
production was the ballet in Act 111,
where dancers depict the Judge
ment of Paris at the prince and
princess's party. It's in the libretto,
but might have been better ex
ecuted. In all fairness, the dozen or
so dancers had little space to move
about in, and Cilea's music isn't ter
ribly rousing in this sequence.
The choreography, however, is
flat and uninteresting, and the
movement differences between the
goddesses — Venus, Juno and
Minerva — are not distinctive. The
ballet becomes a distraction which
only makes dramatic sense when
Paris presents the golden apple to
the princess (an obsequious twist to
the myth), thereby shifting the at
tention to her and her taunting of
Adriana. What follows is the climax
of the opera, and the production
regains its momentum to the end.
