# ‘Creator' Creates Only Boredom

### DAVID WILLATS 
The movie "Creator," directed
by Ivan Passar and starring Peter
O'Toole, is a prime example of
good intentions gone sour. This
movie shoots for the loftiest
themes — love, death, God and
misses the mark on all counts.
Redundant and incongruent, the
film is barely salvaged by the excel
lent performances of O'Toole and
co-star Vincent Spano.
O'Toole portrays Dr. Harry Wol
per, an aging and eccentric Nobel
laureate who is unable to release
himself from the memory of his
wife, who died in childbirth 30 years
before. As a result of his genetic re
search, Wolper is on the verge of
realizing his dream, the regenera
tion of his wife from a few of her
cells that have been kept alive.
Wolper recruits Boris Lafkin
(played by Spano), an awkward yet
enthusiastic graduate student who
is eager to learn all the mysteries of
the universe from the seemingly
omniscient professor, to help him in
his plot.

To accomplish their goal, the two
scientists need a fertile human egg.
Enter Mariel Hemingway as Meli, a
free-spirited street kid who agrees
to be the egg donor. Meli falls in
love with Dr. Wolper, initiating an
unusual love triangle between the
old professor, Meli and a few
frozen cells. To complicate mat
ters, the assistant, Boris, falls madly
in love with another biology stu
dent, Barbara Spencer (Virginia
Madsen).
Essentially, "Creator" is about
the triumph of love over science.
The story echoes the book of
Genesis: Dr. Wolper and Boris fall
from grace as a result of their quest
for knowledge and their attempts at
godliness. They find redemption
only through love and belief in God.
Sounds like decent movie ma
terial, right? Unfortunately, the
power of this theme is diminished
by a wandering plot and a terrifically
bad script. "Creator" is a movie
divided. There are different and
nearly independent love stories
here, each strong enough to sup
port its own movie. The dramatic
focus is dissipated by intercutting

between the two relationships, and
neither one is sufficiently developed
to justify the romantic jumps in the
plot.
The writers of this movie seem
to be unable to decide whether the
film is a serious adult drama or a
teen sex comedy. Consequently,
the finished product is a patchwork
of intense emotion, soul-searching,
vulgar slapstick and gratuitous sex.
In several instances the dramatic
energy of a scene is destroyed by
farcical lines and actions, and nearly
every climax falls flat from inconsis
tency of characterization. The
dialogue has a kind of hip vulgarity
that is prominent in many Holly
wood films these days. Everyone
swears in this film, especially Meli,
who is abrasive and unappealing as
the professor's young lover. The
film is so rife with cliches (both
couples fall in love on the beach at
sunset) that I found myself mouth
ing the more predictable lines along
with the actors.
Although Hemingway has shown
tremendous acting potential in her
previous films (most notably
"Manhattan"), her performance in

"Creator" did little to lift the
picture. In the past she has always
portrayed the innocent and inexper
ienced young woman; in
"Manhattan" she is an uplifting
reflection of human goodness, in
"Star 80," the victim of society and
her own naivete. The role of the as
sertive and worldly Meli is a
departure for her, one with which
she didn't seem very comfortable.
Meli's self-assurance was not at all
convincing, which made her verbal
tirades embarrassingly inappropri
ate and shallow. She will need a
little more experience before she
can perform a role like this comfor
tably.
O'Toole proves, once again,
what a gifted actor he is. With the
mediocrity of production and the
awful dialogue he manages to
create a character of depth and sin-,
cerity. Even the worst lines some
how sound reasonable when he
says them, and it is his transcen
dent quality that makes him a
delight to watch. O'Toole fans may
want to see this movie, but better
yet, rent a copy of "Lawrence of
Arabia." You'll enjoy it much more.

old professor, Meli and a few
frozen cells. To complicate mat
ters, the assistant, Boris, falls madly
in love with another biology stu
dent, Barbara Spencer (Virginia
Madsen).
Essentially, "Creator" is about
the triumph of love over science.
The story echoes the book of
Genesis: Dr. Wolper and Boris fall
from grace as a result of their quest
for knowledge and their attempts at
godliness. They find redemption
only through love and belief in God.
Sounds like decent movie ma
terial, right? Unfortunately, the
power of this theme is diminished
by a wandering plot and a terrifically
bad script. "Creator" is a movie
divided. There are different and
nearly independent love stories
here, each strong enough to sup
port its own movie. The dramatic
focus is dissipated by intercutting

between the two relationships, and
neither one is sufficiently developed
to justify the romantic jumps in the
plot.
The writers of this movie seem
to be unable to decide whether the
film is a serious adult drama or a
teen sex comedy. Consequently,
the finished product is a patchwork
of intense emotion, soul-searching,
vulgar slapstick and gratuitous sex.
In several instances the dramatic
energy of a scene is destroyed by
farcical lines and actions, and nearly
every climax falls flat from inconsis
tency of characterization. The
dialogue has a kind of hip vulgarity
that is prominent in many Holly
wood films these days. Everyone
swears in this film, especially Meli,
who is abrasive and unappealing as
the professor's young lover. The
film is so rife with cliches (both
couples fall in love on the beach at
sunset) that I found myself mouth
ing the more predictable lines along
with the actors.
Although Hemingway has shown
tremendous acting potential in her
previous films (most notably
"Manhattan"), her performance in

"Creator" did little to lift the
picture. In the past she has always
portrayed the innocent and inexper
ienced young woman; in
"Manhattan" she is an uplifting
reflection of human goodness, in
"Star 80," the victim of society and
her own naivete. The role of the as
sertive and worldly Meli is a
departure for her, one with which
she didn't seem very comfortable.
Meli's self-assurance was not at all
convincing, which made her verbal
tirades embarrassingly inappropri
ate and shallow. She will need a
little more experience before she
can perform a role like this comfor
tably.
O'Toole proves, once again,
what a gifted actor he is. With the
mediocrity of production and the
awful dialogue he manages to
create a character of depth and sin-,
cerity. Even the worst lines some
how sound reasonable when he
says them, and it is his transcen
dent quality that makes him a
delight to watch. O'Toole fans may
want to see this movie, but better
yet, rent a copy of "Lawrence of
Arabia." You'll enjoy it much more.


Peter O'Toole stars as Dr. Harry Wolper, a lonely, obsessed
Nobel laureate biologist who is unable to let go of his beloved
deceased wife.
