## There's Just Too Much Food at Gaylord Restaurant

Lovers of Indian cuisine cannot
afford to miss the Gaylord India
Restaurant in Stanford Shopping
Center.
Lovers of other things also
should do everything in their power
not to miss the dining experience
offered at this superb restaurant.
Those who feel even the
slightest trepidation about trying
exotic Indian food should have no
fear. At the Gaylord, every palate
is offered a wide range of dishes
prepared in the traditional style of
northern India.
Stepping into the Gaylord will set
even the most nervous patron im
mediately at ease. The Gaylord of
fers a relaxed, almost subdued at
mosphere that belies a sense of
privacy, suited to both formal and
informal dining.
The spacious dining area is
decorated with traditional Indian
artwork, including tapestries
depicting scenes from Indian lore.
While these decorations are inter
esting in themselves, however, the
Gaylord maintains the overall ap
pearance of a traditional, high
quality American or European res
taurant.
The service at the Gaylord is ex

cellent, the waiters making every
attempt to ensure that the cus
tomer is completely satisfied. In
spite of the lavish attention,
however, the waiters maintain an
unhurried and relaxed attitude,
leaving customers to enjoy their
meal in peace.
At 6 p.m. one Friday, there was
almost no wait to be seated as the
clientele arrived for dinner.
Though the atmosphere ensures
an enjoyable dining experience, the
main attraction of the Gaylord is
most definitely the food.
Perusing the menu, customers
find a wide range of lamb, chicken,
seafood and vegetarian entrees,
mildly to strongly spiced in the
traditional manner of northern In
dia.
For appetizers, we ordered the
"Assorted Indian Appetizers,"
which consists of lamb and chicken,
charbroiled with onion slices and
served with both a mild yogurt
sauce and a spicy curry sauce.
One serving of these appetizers
was enough to make us feel almost
too satisfied. By the time we had
eaten the plate of meat, we were
nearly too full to eat anything else.
For the main course, we ordered
two entrees and a rice dish.
One entree consisted of eggplant
mashed with peas and onions.
Cooked in a flavord charcoal oven at
760 degrees Fahrenheit, the egg
plant was then peeled and mashed

with the peas and onions. The dish
was flavored with a blend of spices,
the mixture of which the chef
refused to reveal, opting to
preserve a well-kept secret.
Our second entree consisted of
cubed lamb in a mildly spiced
spinach sauce. The spinach for the
curried lamb is specially cleaned,
shredded and cooked in another se
cret blend of spices. The spinach is
then added to roasted lamb to
create a delicious mixture of
flavors.
Besides the huge helpings of

these entrees, we also sampled the
Gaylord rice pilau, which was deli
cious, and pan, a flatbread cooked
with scallions and onions. As rice
and bread are staples in the
cuisine of northern India, they are
among the items in the menu that
are ordered most often. With their
blander taste, these two side dishes
complemented the main course
well.
Although the food was delicious,
most of the entreees and rice were
left on both our plates, since the
serving sizes are so big. What we

ordered for two people could easily
have fed four.
Because we were so full, we did not
try the pastries and ice cream that
are available for dessert. Judging
from the entrees, however, these
desserts were probably delicious
and worth a try.
The Gaylord is an excellent res
taurant, but, perhaps because of its
location in the shopping center, is
not inexpensive. The entrees cost
from $8 to $15, but with appetizers
and side dishes, the bill begins to
rise. Although the Gaylord offers an

extensive wine list and boasts a full
service bar, we stuck to mineral
water and Coke. In spite of these
money-saving precautions, our
meal came to around $50.
In spite of the cost, the Gaylord
is an ideal restaurant for special oc
casions, or for the appeasement of
cravings for exotic food. <
