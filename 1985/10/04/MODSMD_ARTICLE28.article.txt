To step into Nataraja is to step into another
world.
Here the waiters wear traditional Indian
tunics and bracelets. Customers sit on seats
with hand-woven cushions, which come
straight from India. On the walls hang wooden
Indian carvings, and a native tapestry depicting
a wedding celebration fills the restaurant with
a festive air.
But this example of an Indian eatery submits
to Western ideas of comfort, with intimate
booths, linen table cloths and beautiful china
and silver ware.
After taking in the warm and interesting sur
roundings, we turn to the beer and wine list.
With pleasure we note the imported German

beers, and the moderately-priced California
wines. Although we have a great selection of
wines to choose from, including a fairly inex
pensive Saint Emilion, we choose the house
wine, which is Taylor California Cellars Bur
gundy. A half carafe cost $4.75 and was a nice
complement to our meal.
The menu offers appetizers, salads, soups,
tandoori meats, tandoori breads, pilafs,
"traditional fare" and farm-fresh produce.
Temptation arises to order one of everything
â€” it all looks so good.
Sense prevails, however, and we narrow
our choices down to one appetizer, one pilaf,
one entree and the relish tray.
For our appetizer, we choose Samosas ($3),
and receive a basket of three pasta triangles
that look and smell heavenly. Stuffed with
potatoes, peas and mysterious but delicious
spices, the samosas come with a small dish of
mint yogurt relish, which serves both to cool
the mild spices and to add flavor to the ap
petizer.
The Samosas disappear as rapidly as they

arrive (it has been three minutes between the
time we ordered them and the time they ap
pear on our table), and next we are given the
relish tray, which costs only $1 and provides
some very exotic flavors on our plate.
Included in the relish tray are two round, flat
breads, called Papadum. Reminiscent of Matzo
bread, Papadum is crisp and light, and proves
to be useful to scoop up the relishes that come
with it.
The relishes are mango pickle, herb chutney
and onion-cucumber salad. Though the chut
ney was a little salty for our tastes, the other
two relishes are fabulous.
Though it may seem that we are lacking
Something in ordering only one entree, one
must understand that the pilaf is not just a
"rice dish," but an entree in itself. In fact, we
end up having so much to eat that we can't
finish all that was on our plates.
And the food on our plates is fantastic. The
waiter splits each order in half so that we can

both eat our fill of each dish.
The pilaf, Zafrani Moghlai Biryani ($14.75),
is an Indian rice pilaf with lamb, garnished with
raisins, dried nuts and eggs and flavored with
saffron. The menu describes it as a "Moghul
specialty," and it is so good that I am ready to
try more Moghul specialties very soon. My
companion dislikes the chunks of lamb in the
dish, and I am so full already that I hardly touch
the meat, but the long-grain Basmati rice

mixture itself is great.
Spicier than the Zafrani, the entree is very
good nonetheless. Called Chicken Tikka
Masala ($10.75), this entree consists of tan
doori chicken boned and chopped in a blend of
herbs and spices. A northern Indian dish, this
chicken is made in the mesquite charcoal fire
broilers, or Indian tandoori clay ovens. This
dish is described as "very provincial" in the
menu, but I prefer to call it "very good."
Although the level of spice is perfect for my
palate, most dishes can be ordered "hot and
spicy," for those who like an extra zip in their
food.

Finished off with a cup of strong coffee
($1.75), this meal is indeed very satisfying. Al
though the dessert trolley sounds enticing, of
fering such exotic dishes as Badam Kheer,
which is like rice pudding, and Pistachio Kulfi,
a homemade pistachio ice cream, we are both
too full even to consider eating another bite of
anything.
In addition, Nataraja has weekday buffet
lunches, Tuesday to Friday from 11:30 to
2:30. For $7.95, customers can have all they
can eat of the fantastic Indian food served at
Nataraja's.
