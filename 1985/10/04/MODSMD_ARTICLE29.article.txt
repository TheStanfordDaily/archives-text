If you think all Indian restaurants
in the area are either too pricy or
too spicy for your tastes, you prob
ably haven't tried Shaikh's India
Foods.
Shaikh's is a clean, fast-food
styled restaurant that two sisters
have run for 14 years.
A complete meal here, with des
ert and a drink, will cost about
$4.
The California Avenue restaurant
is surprisingly stark inside. Formica
tables and orange plastic chairs
don't provide any Indian atmos
phere, and the few posters and
handicrafts hung on the walls don't
do the trick, either. But the quick
service and reasonable prices are
good compensation for this
shortcoming.
One orders at the counter from a
very limited menu, and the food can
be ordered to take out. The choice
for a meal is basically limited to the
combination plate, which consists of
beef, chicken or vegetable curry,
rice, one samosa and pakoda, and
chutney.
All this costs a mere $2.50.
However, if this item doesn't
tempt you, you're out of luck. The
only other offerings are more
samosa or pakoda, one dessert
choice and whole wheat bread.
Samosa and pokada are small

side dishes or hors d'oeuvres.
Samosa is a piece of dough wrapped
like a flag around a meat or
vegetable filling and deep-fried.
The samosa at Shaikh's is very
good. The meat is spicy and the
vegetable filling is also tasty. These
can be ordered on their own for
three for $1 and can be ordered
frozen so that you can fry them and
serve them at home. They would
make a great party food or study
break snack.
The menu describes pakoda as a
crispy spinach and garbanzo flour
ball. The dish was much better than
one might anticipate from this des
cription. In fact, pakodas are a mild
tasting dumpling-like dish.
The curry served here is cer
tainly passable, but a bit institu
tional and bland. The beef curry has
quite a bit of beef cut in small
pieces, while the chicken curry has
one large piece of chicken. They
are both served over plain white
rice, which doesn't enhance their
flavor as much as some of the
flavored rices available at many In
dian restaurants.
The one dessert item on the
menu is Gulab Jam. These small,
breadlike balls are served in syrup
making it a very sweet dessert.
Five of them cost $1.
Shaikh's is open for lunch and
early dinners. Store hours are Mon
day through Friday 11 a.m. to 7
p.m., and Saturday 11:30 a.m. to
3:30 p.m.
The restaurant does catering and
takeout orders and also sells frozen
samosa and chapati.
