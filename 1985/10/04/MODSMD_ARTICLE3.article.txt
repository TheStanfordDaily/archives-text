# Cheating Case Goes On
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
The University is "making progress" in
interviewing and levying penalties against
the 23 students accused of cheating in last
spring's Introductory Psychology class,
according to Sally Cole, the University's
judicial affairs officer.
Cole declined to elaborate further on
the progress of the investigation, saying
she would issue a full report following
completion of the entire proceedings and
the issuance of all penalties.
Meanwhile, Prof. Philip Zimbardo and
the Psychology Department are taking

steps to reform the introductory course to
eliminate the possibility of cheating in the
popular class next spring.
The '23 students accuser! of cheating
were identified this summer when Mary
Parpel, the head teaching assistant for the
class, and Rose McDermott, another
teaching assistant, reviewed about 7,000
computer-scored answer sheets used by
the 744 members of the class on the
course's weekly tests. They noticed sus
picious similarities among students' test
scores and changes in the writing styles of
individual students over the course of the
quarter's tests.
Their findings led Parpel and McDer
mott to believe that some students copied

answers from others' tests or took tests
for another student in the class.
Suspicion that cheating was taking place
in the class was first aroused last spring
when Zimbardo received an anonymous
complaint from a student and when Parpel
noticed one student handing in two identi
cal tests.
Cole currently is interviewing each of
the 23 suspected cheaters. If she decides
to file charges, the case will be referred to
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons,
who would then inform the students of
available options.
If charged with cheating, a student can: admit to
guilt and request the dean or the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC) to recommend penalties; admit the facts
of the case but deny that they represent a violation of
the Honor Code — in which case the SJC interprets
the code; or dispute the facts — in which case the
validity of the facts would be determined by an inde
pendent hearing officer appointed by the University
— and then the case would go to the SJC.
The SJC a board made up of three students and
three faculty members appointed by the University
president — decides the case and recommends an ap
propriate punishment. Finally, University President
Donald Kennedy has the option of accepting or reject
ing the recommendation.
Cole could offer no comment on when the procedure
might be completed.
In the past, incidents of cheating on a single test
have been punished by a grade of no credit in the class
and suspension from the University for one quarter,
Lyons said. Incidents of repeated cheating have been
punished by suspensions of as much as two years.
lo curb cheating in Introductory Psychology,
Zimbardo said he plans to limit the number of students
allowed to enroll in the class, use more graduate teach
ing assistants and stop using computer-scored
multiple-choice tests.
However, Zimbardo said yesterday, "If we had a
real honor code, it shouldn't matter if there were
10,000 people in my class."
