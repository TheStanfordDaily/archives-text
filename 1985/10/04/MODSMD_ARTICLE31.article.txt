## Stanford Away Against Aztecs 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
Stanford football Coach Jack El
way isn't taking tomorrow's game
with San Diego State lightly, and
he's hoping his players aren't
either.
"We can't go into San Diego and
not be about as hungry as a football
team can be," he said. "If there's
anything that seeps into anybody's
mind that we can take (SDSU) for
granted, I'll be very disappointed."
Elway has good reason to be
worried. The Aztecs (2-1) are capa
ble of beating Stanford. They're so
capable that San Diego State was
favored by one in yesterday's bet
ting line.
The Cardinal defense, which has
given up a total of 83 points in its
last two games, will be challenged
by the best quarterback it has faced
all season — Todd Santos. The Az
tec sophomore is 51-of-75 for 616
yards and five touchdowns so far
this year, and he has a dangerous
target in wide receiver Webster
Slaughter, who has pulled in 20 of
Santos' throws for 253 yards.
And SDSU can run, too. Last
week, 160-pound tailback Chris
Hardy rushed for 235 yards in his
first college start, a 48-23 win over
Colorado State. Ninety-two of
those yards came on one run, a
scary statistic to any Cardinal fan
who watched the Stanford defense
surrender the big play over and

over again in its losses to Oregon
and Texas.
But on the other side of the field,
the Aztecs are hurting. Two of
their starting defensive linemen —
nose guard Levi Esene and tackle
Duane Pettitt — will miss the Stan
ford game due to injuries. And the
defense has given up an average of
24 points a game this season, in
cluding 34 in a loss to UCLA.
So expect another big day from
the powerhouse Stanford offense,
best in the Pacific-10 Conference
with an average of 489.3 yards a
game. In particular, expect another
huge game from quarterback John
Paye, who was named Sports ll
lustrated's Offensive Player of the
Week for his performance in last
week's 38-34 loss to Texas — 27-
of-40 for 365 yards, three touch
downs and no interceptions.
If the Cardinal defense is able to
shut down the big play, Stanford
should have a pretty smooth time of
it tomorrow. If not, it could be a
game that is won by the last team
that gets the ball.
Card notes
The reserve quarterback for the
Aztecs is Greg Topp. He trans
ferred from Stanford in 1983 be
cause of a log-jam of talent at the
top with Steve Cottrell and John
Paye ahead of him. Topp hasn't
found the bonanza in the south that


Stanford, 1 -2 on the year, will have to do a lot of running tomor
row night to meet the challenge of the San Diego State Aztecs,
2-1. Stanford's offense will put numbers on the board, but the
question is whether the defense can contain the potent Aztec

Rod Searcey/Daily file
attack. San Diego quarterback Todd Santos has already thrown
for 616 yards and five touchdowns. That's not good news for a
Cardinal defensive unit that has surrendered 83 points in its last
two games.
