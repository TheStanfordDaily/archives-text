# No.1 Water Polo Ranking on Line
## Card Hosts Nor Cal 
### INGRID SEYER Staff writer 
Stanford water polo coach Dante Dettamanti isn't
too wary of telling what his goals for the Cardinal are in
this weekend's Nor Cal Tournament.
"Our objective is to win the tournament," Detta
manti said. "Another one of our objectives is to main
tain our No. 1 ranking, and by winning the tournament,
hopefully we can do that, too."
Though the Cardinal is currently ranked as the No. 1
team in the nation, that does not guarantee the team
any easy victories. Competing in the two-day tourna
ment, to be held today and tomorrow at DeGuerre Pool,
will be six of the top 13 teams in the country, including
three of the top five.
Competing in the university division will be Stanford,
No. 13 Loyola/Chicago, UC-Davis, No. 3 UC-
Berkeley, No. 11 University of the Pacific, the Univer
sity of Santa Clara, No. 5 UC-Santa Barbara, No. 12
UC San Diego and No. 18 Air Force.
There will also be nine teams competing in the col
lege/club division, including Stanford's "B" team.
The Cardinal will play its first match of the tourna
ment at 10:20 a.m. against Davis and will play again at
5:20 p.m. against Loyola/Chicago.
Although the Cardinal defeated Davis last weekend,
it won't be taking its first match easy.

"I think we will play better against Davis this
weekend, but the match still won't be too easy," Det
tamanti said. "We are really going to be working to hold
down their offense."
In the afternoon match the Cardinal will be looking to
avenge a loss to Loyola two years ago which took place
in the same tournament.
"The Stanford water polo team had never lost a
match to an out-of-state team before, and losing the
match in sudden-death overtime made the loss even
worse," Dettamanti said. "We are going to come out
strong against Loyola to insure that we won't get into
any trouble again."
If the Cardinal wins both of its matches today it
will play again tomorrow, probably against Cal and
Santa Barbara.
"Santa Barbara is really going to be tough," Detta
manti said. "They have a very strong counter-attack
and are quick on their fast breaks. It should be very in
teresting to see our counter-attack against theirs."
Santa Barbara should be led by several players from
the Mexican National team and by John Anderson, a
member of the Canadian Olympic team in 1984.
Although Berkeley will be playing without former
standout Alan Gresham, the Bears will once again be
fielding Olympic Gold medalist and national record
holder Matt Biondi. Berkeley (7-1) will also be playing
with a large number of players who were red-shirted
last year as freshman.
