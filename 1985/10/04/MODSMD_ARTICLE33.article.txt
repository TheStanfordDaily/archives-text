SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — All National League
teams have been warned in a letter from San Fran
cisco's city attorney that they risk a lawsuit if they ap
prove a sale or move of the San Francisco Giants that
breaches the team's contract at Candlestick Park, offi
cials said yesterday.
The two-page letter, dated Sept. 17, advises the NL
owners of the provisions of the Giants' lease at
Candlestick, which expires in 1994, according to Phil
Ward, chief deputy city attorney.
The league's constitution requires three-quarters of
the clubs to approve the sale or transfer of a franchise.
If the Giants receive that support for a sale or move,
Ward said the other clubs "might be subject to potential
liability for inducing breach of contract, or breach it
self."
The message said, in part: "If the subject of
moving the San Francisco Giants comes up at any
meetings or agendas and if you vote favorably to allow
them to move, we will file a suit for interference of our
lease."
Giants owner Bob Lurie said Wednesday his team
will no longer play in Candlestick, and he offered to buy
out the lease for "several million dollars." Mayor
Dianne Feinstein has backed the buyout plan and
Lurie's proposal that he share the Oakland Coliseum
with the A's for three or four years until a new domed
stadium is built in downtown San Francisco.
However, Lurie's plan was attacked by Oakland
Mayor Lionel Wilson, who said he didn't want the club,
and the A's, who said they are concerned about prob
lems of sharing the coliseum. Several members of the

San Francisco Board of Supervisors also criticized the
plan, saying they don't want a downtown stadium built.
Supreme Court to Cubs: lights out
CHICAGO (AP) — The Illinois Supreme Court up
held a ban on night baseball at Wrigley Field yesterday
and prompted renewed threats by the Chicago Cubs
that they would play elsewhere.
"We're working to stay in Wrigley and play in Wrigley
Field. That's our priority and our first thought," Cubs
General Manager Dallas Green said after the high
court's ruling.
The court rejected a challenge, made by the Cubs'
owners, cf state and local laws barring night baseball at
Wrigley, the only major league ballpark without lights.
Labeling the decision "another nail in the coffin" of
the Cubs' hopes of staying at Wrigley, Green said the
club has three options: trying for a legislative solution,
reaching a compromise with the city and neighborhood
groups, or finding another place to play ball.
The high court's decision, issued without dissent,
said state and city lawmakers acted properly in enact
ing legislation to ensure a continued ban on lights at the
70-year-old National League stadium.
"Simply, the Cubs have failed to meet the burden of
showing the unconstitutionality of the legislative ac
tions," the court said in an opinion written by Justice
Daniel Ward.
The court also noted Wrigley Field is in a densely
populated area without parking facilities or access to
major expressways to ease traffic generated by night
ball games.
