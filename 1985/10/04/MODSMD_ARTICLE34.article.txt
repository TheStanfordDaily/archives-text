# Royals, Cardinals shine
## Baseball, Mizzou-style 
### 
ST. LOUIS (AP) — Vince Coleman had three hits,
including a two-run single in the fourth inning, and the
St. Louis Cardinals averted a three-game sweep by
New York with a 4-3 victory last night that restored
their lead in the National League East to two games
over the Mets.
With the victory, the Cardinals ended a three-game
losing streak and reduced their magic number to two.
Any combination of two Cardinals victories or Mets
losses would clinch the division.
The Cardinals finish the season with three games at
home against Chicago, sending Bob Forsch against
Dennis Eckersley tonight. The Mets play three at
home with Montreal, with Sid Fernandez going against
the Expos' Bill Gullickson in the opener.
If the two teams finish the season in a tie, a one
game playoff in New York Monday will decide the divi
sion.
The Cardinals came into the three-game series
leading New York by three games, but the Mets pulled
within a game with a 1-0, 11-inning victory Tuesday
night and a 5-2 decision Wednesday night.
The two teams were tied 1-1 in the fourth inning
when Coleman drove in a pair of runs with his second
hit of the night off Rick Aguilera, the loser, now 10-7.
Coleman went into the game with one hit in his previ
ous 20 at-bats.
Darrell Porter walked, Ozzie Smith singled and

pitcher Danny Cox sacrificed to set up the go-ahead
hit.
Cox, 18-9, allowed nine hits in six innings, but lim
ited the Mets to two runs, both driven in by Keith Her
nandez, who had five hits. Aguilera, who had won
three in a row, also gave up nine hits in six innings.
Kansas City 4, California 1
KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Frank White, George
Brett and Steve Balboni hit home runs last night in sup
port of Danny Jackson, powering Kansas City past Cal
ifornia 4-1, and into a one-game lead in the American
League West.
Jackson gave up 11 hits in eight-and-two-thirds in
nings, but benefitted from two Kansas City double
plays as California stranded nine baserunners. Dan
Quisenberry retired the final batter for his 36th save.
The three home runs — representing career highs
for each man — came off Don Sutton, 15-10, who
departed after five innings. Jackson, 14-12, struck out
three and walked none.
The Angels, who brought a one-game lead into the
four-game showdown, will finish their regular season
with three weekend games in Texas while the Royals
host Oakland for three. A regular-season deadlock
would be played off in Kansas City on Monday after
noon.
