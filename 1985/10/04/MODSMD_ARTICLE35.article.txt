# Stanford Out to Sea
## Sets sights on fame 
### BRANDI WATSON 
The Stanford Sailing Team is
not as well known as the football
team or the basketball team — at
least among students. They are,
however, a well-known and
feared force in the world of com
petitive sailing.
Led by a group of experienced
sailors, the Stanford team plans
to make a name for itself on and
off campus. According to Head
Coach Joe Petrucci, "We have the
best team we've ever had."
The varsity Cardinal squad,
comprised of 38 students, has
already been competing for a
month. That includes a three
week trip to the East Coast
during the summer. The team
fared impressively in the East,
placing eighth in the Anderson
Trophy, fourth in the Nevin's
Trophy and eighth again in the
Navy Fall Invite. The top 18
teams in the nation were on hand
for' those three events.

"We came back from the road
trip well trained," Petrucci said.
His team proved Petrucci right by
trouncing all comers in the Stoney
Burke Regatta, held in Berkeley
last weekend. The Cardinal en
tered four boats and captured the
top four places against a field that
included Berkeley, USC, San
Diego State and UC-Santa Cruz.
"Right now we're concentrat
ing on team development,"
Petrucci said. "Our team has
worked through its program and
are very good sailors. We have a
lot of depth, real good talent."
The top Stanford teams include
skipper-crew pairs comprised of
seniors Rich Bergsend, Marika
Fussganger and All-America
Rona Sisson; sophomores Dan
Buckstaff and Drew Gashler; and
juniors Kristin Boyles and Tom
Kuhnle. Supplementing returning
team members are two heavily
recruited freshmen, Billy
Schumacher and Brad Swett.
Schumacher and Swett are great

assets to the team, having com
peted together in high school.
They captured a number of na
tional prep titles — both individu
ally and as a pair.
Tomorrow and Sunday, the
Cardinal will be sending two
sailors, Tom Kuhnle and sopho
more There DuPont, to compete
with more than 45 other teams in
the Singlehanded Championships
to be held in Santa Cruz. The top
two finishers will travel to Hawaii
for the North American
Singlehanded Championships in
November.
Petrucci seemed confident of
Stanford success: "If Tom sails
well, he can qualify."
This regatta is just one in a se
ries of important events that all
count toward a national title in
volving the various classes of
boats. "Our goal is to reach the
top five in the nation. That should
be easily attainable," Petrucci
said.
