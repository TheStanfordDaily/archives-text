# Grudge Match With UCLA Tonight
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff sportswriter 
The best women's volleyball
teams in the nation will be battling
tonight at Maples Pavilion as top
ranked Stanford hosts second
ranked UCLA. Sounds impressive
enough, doesn't it. Oh, but this is
much more than the average
matchup of No.l and No. 2. You
only have to go back to Dec. 16 of
last year to see why tonight's match
will be an especially emotional one.
It was the night at UCLA's
Pauley Pavilion that the Cardinal
and Bruins battled in what became a
memorable NCAA championship.
Memorable at least for UCLA.
After a split of the first four
games, the championship came
down to one deciding game. The
Cardinal broke quickly in the fifth
game, taking leads of 11-2 and 12-4
behind the resurgent hitting and
blocking of Ail-American Kim
Oden, who had been held in check
throughout much of the match. Just
three points from victory,
however, everything fell apart for
the Cardinal, and the dream of a na
tional title was shattered.
UCLA's Liz Masakayan, the 1984
College Player of the Year who had
played marvelously the first four
games, increased her level of per
formance another notch and almost
single-handedly stole the title from
Stanford. Masakayan pounded one
kill after another past Cardinal
blocks, many while she was playing
the back row, and the Bruin fans
became more and more delirious as
the Cardinal lead dwindled.
Before the Stanford women
could regroup, UCLA had captured
the fifth game and the championship
by scores of 15-12, 7-15, 15-10, 9-
15, and 15-13.
"I don't think anyone on our team
will ever forget that (match),"
Cardinal Co-Coach Don Shaw said.

"My only thought at the time was
Why us?' "
Though thoughts of the match
may bring bitter memories to the
Cardinal, Shaw said that it should
be remembered. "We've got to take
that as experience and learn some
thing from it."
The play of the Cardinal women
so far this season would indicate

that they haven't dwelled
negatively on last year's disappoint
ment too much. After 11 games,
Stanford is undefeated, most
recently having dumped nationally
ranked Texas and USC last
weekend.
This week the Cardinal was
named as the new No. 1 team in the
Tachikara Poll, dropping the Bruins

out of the top spot for the first time
this season.
As is often the case with coaches
of newly announced No. 1 teams,
however, Shaw is not overly con
cerned with the recent poll. "I don't
think too much about it,"he said.
"Not at this stage of the season.
They (UCLA) are the team I con
sider to be No. 1."
Shaw said that the Cardinal has
many stairs to climb before it can be
considered the top team. "We're
not yet satisfied with the way we're
playing," he said. "We tend to be
our own worst enemy."
He indicated that the inconsis
tency can partially be attributed to
the relative inexperience of some of
the team members. "Those things
generally work themselves out,"
Shaw said.
Stanford has been paced of
fensively this season by Oden, who
leads the team in hitting percentage
at .361, and sophomore setter
Wendi Rush, who gained Honorable
Mention All-America honors as a
freshman last year. Rush sprained
her ankle against Texas last Friday
but will play tonight, according to
Shaw.
Defensively, Oden and junior
Barbra Fontana have paced the
team. Oden leads the team in block
ing (8 solos and 43 assists) and has
106 digs. Fontana leads Stanford
with 121 digs.
UCLA, which had its 17-match
winning streak halted by Hawaii, is
strong in all aspects of the game,
Shaw said. "They feel if they can
serve tough that takes us out of our
offense, making us pass poorly,"
The Bruins, 10-1 on the season,
will attempt to take away Oden's ef
fectiveness, according to Shaw.
"They feel if they can do that
they're stronger all-around than we
are."
"It's the two best teams in the
country," Shaw said. "I wouldn't
miss it."

The last time the Stanford women's volleyball team met UCLA,
the roof fell in on the Cardinal. This time, the women hope to
leap past UCLA and claim the country's number one volleyball
program.
