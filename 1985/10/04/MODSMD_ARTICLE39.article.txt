# Field Hockey At Chico St.
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff writer 
The Stanford field hockey
team will be traveling five hours
tomorrow by van to central Cali
fornia to face perhaps the best
conditioned team in the North
ern Pacific Conference, Chico
State.
"They're in really good shape,
they run you," Stanford Head
Coach Sheryl Johnson said.
"They'll have a definite home
field advantage."
Chico will be looking to trade
their No. 2 NorPac ranking with
the Cardinal's No. 1. The
Wildcats have already shown
their stuff to San Jose State and
Berkeley.
The Cardinal, meanwhile, has
something to prove after a
frustrating tie with the Univer
sity of Pacific last Saturday
which upped their record to 1-2-
1.

Chico is led by midfielder
Kristi Pavloff, whom Card junior
Andi Wolpert described as "a
real good all-around player."
In order to bounce back from
last week's disappointment, and
in order to maintain their top
ranking, Stanford will have "to
play more aggressively than
we've been playing," Wolpert
said.
Besides a five hour van ride
and Kristi Pavloff, Stanford will
also battle a style of play which
senior defenseman Susan Fis
cher called "unpredictable."
"In the past, they've played a
different game" from most of
Stanford's opponents, Fischer
said."Their play is unexpected."
As she has before, Wolpert
stressed the importance of the
Card playing "our game." She
blamed last week's tie in part on
letting UOP control the type of
match that transpired.
