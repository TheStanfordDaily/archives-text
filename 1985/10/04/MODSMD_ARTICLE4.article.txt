# Government Eyes Plan on Secret Work
## 
### LIZ EGAN Staff writer 
The Department of Energy is reconsidering an ear
lier proposal that would have forced the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) to accept classified
research projects, according to a government spokes
man.
Under research guidelines proposed by the depart
ment in August, contractors such as SLAC would have
had to accept classified government research if they
accepted other research in the same project.
University President Donald Kennedy last week
called the proposal "outlandish" and said it was a
"policy change of the greatest importance."
Stanford policy bars classified research on campus.
Department of Energy spokesman Steve Mournig
han told The Daily yesterday that his agency is
"reconsidering the whole project." He said, however,
that no decision has been made yet.
The guidelines were first publicized in the August
Federal Register. They state that any Department of
Energy contractor would be forced to accept "any
work assignments which fall within the general scope
of the contract for work of a national defense nature,
whether such work is classified or unclassified."
Such a guideline would have forced SLAC to either
forego federal funding or violate University research
policies.
In a letter to Department of Energy officials, Ken
nedy said the agency "ought not, with the mere stroke
of the pen, attempt to negate fundamental academic
policies dealing with openness in research." He added
that such a proposal would not be in the national inter
est.
"Such a requirement would prevent universities
such as Stanford, whose linear accelerator center is
one of the leading high-energy physics laboratories of
the world, from continuing to contribute to this nation's
scientific leadership," he said.
Addressing the International Association of Univer
sities, meeting this summer at UCLA, Kennedy
criticized "a growing sense here in the United States
that competitiveness rather than cooperation should
dominate the scientific and intellectual relations be
tween nations."
A leader in university efforts to maintain open re
search, Kennedy said that "even the most ardently
competitive nation should realize that once it starts
keeping track of its secrets instead of seeing where its
research progress is leading it, wiD lose momentum."
A related research problem was solved last Friday,
when the White House announced that the government
would not try to restrain the
publication of unclassified research.
Scientists have feared recently
that the government was moving in
the direction of de facto classifica
tion of even the most basic studies.
Kennedy announced he was
"very pleased" with the White

House announcement, that stated,
"Our goal is to foster the free and
open exchange of unclassified re
search so necessary to a free soci
ety and an expanding economy."
Cornell University President
Emeritus Dale Corson said: "I'm
heartened because I've seen the
gates close on basic research as the
military has moved to restrict the
flow of technologies to the Soviet
Union."
