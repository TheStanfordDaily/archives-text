# UCLA Round-robin
## Men's Soccer Goes South 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
The Stanford men's soccer team
makes a pivotal road trip to Los An
geles this weekend to participate in
the Pacific-10 round-robin tourna
ment at UCLA.
Both tomorrow's game, a 1 p.m.
start against the University of
Washington, and Sunday's match
up, either against Berkeley or
UCLA, will be important for the
Card for more than one reason.
First, Stanford's season is at its
midway point. As a result of Wed
nesday's 1-0 loss to Fresno State
here, the Cardinal's record dropped
to 4-5-2, with 10 games remaining
on the schedule.
In other words, Stanford's
second-year-Coach Sam Koch is
going to be hard pressed to im

prove on last year's 11-7-3 record.
On the other hand, the Cardinal
team can regard the second half of
the schedule as a brand new cam
paign. The Fresno State match on
Wednesday, won by the Bulldogs 1-
0, was the first game in Stanford's
Pacific Soccer Conference (PSC)
season, and although it was a
defeat, it proved that the Cardinal is
going to be competitive.
The University of San Francisco
and Berkeley, perennial powers in
the PSC, are still to come on Stan
ford's schedule. Both teams beat
Stanford last year, so the senior
laden Cardinal will be itching for
revenge.
Still, victories in this weekend's
tournament and in the PSC are
going to be hard to come by if the
Stanford attack doesn't begin to
score more often.
At the start of the season, Koch

expected the Cardinal offense to be
one of the team's strengths. After
11 games, however, Stanford has
only tallied 9 goals. On the field, the
offense looks threatening enough
and creates good scoring opportuni
ties, but the players just can't seem
to find the net.
That group will have to continue
performing well this weekend be
cause the Huskies are having no
trouble scoring so far this year. Off
to a quick 5-1 start, Washington
returns two big scorers from last
season's 14-3-2 squad. .Senior for
ward Phil Carson has notched 5
goals already, and sophomore Daryl
Green has added 3 scores.
Stanford had won two games in a
row previous to Wednesday's loss,
and a couple of victories this
weekend could spark the Cardinal
for its second-half campaign.
