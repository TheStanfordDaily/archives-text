Sometimes an easy win can be
the key to turning around a
season. Stanford's women's soc
cer team is hoping that yester
day's 3-0 win over Sacramento
State will be the spark that starts
a winning fire.
After enduring a three-game
losing streak, the Cardinal badly
needed a win to boost morale.
And Sacramento State, a club
team that brought only two sub
situtes, was the perfect mark.
"It wasn't a gorgeous game,"
sophomore midfielder Anne Hil
bert said. "But we've had a
sporadic season and this could
give us a needed turnaround."
"From here, things can only
get better," she said.
The game started slowly, with
both teams going back and forth
in the center of the field. Neither
squad could find an edge. But
Stanford looked hungry. There
"seemed to be a lot of fighting
spirit," senior Cardinal fullback
Carol Berryman said.
Fourteen minutes into the
game the Hornets provided the
first real threat with two
dangerously-close cornerkicks.
Perfectly-placed, both balls
soared to the front of the Stan
ford net. But, lo and behold,
there was senior goalkeeper
Helen Norton, who rose through
a crowd of players to knock both
shots out-of-bounds.
Unphased, the Cardinal came
right back down the field. The
Hornets' defense was slow to
react, and Stanford tallied their
first goal.
With only one defender be
tween her and the goal, fresh
man forward Carolyn Denney
decided to pass. She crossed the
ball to a wide-open Jenny Hill,
who headed the ball into the back
of the Sacramento net.

As the game went on, the
Stanford offense warmed up.
For the remainder of the first
half, the ball rarely entered the
Cardinal half of the field. The
Hornets ended the half with only
five shots on goal.
With the clock reading 33
minutes, Stanford scored once
again. The Cardinal offense beat
the tiring Hornet defense down
the field. Using the advantage of
a three-on-one break, junior for
ward Holly Barnes drew out the
Sacramento defender and dished
the ball off to Hilbert.
Hilbert took the pass, eyed
the net and sent the ball right by
the Sacramento goalkeeper.
The count was now 2-0 in fa
vor of the Cardinal, and Stan
ford's confidence was growing.
Only six minutes later, with
the ball back in the Hornets'
penalty box, a frustrated
Sacramento player made a costly
mistake. The ball bounced high,
and she hit it with her hand. It
was a blunder which gave the
Cardinal a direct penalty shot at
the Hornet goal.
Berryman was called up from
her defensive fullback position to
take the shot.
She hesitated for a moment,
then shot the ball past the flat
footed Sacramento goalkeeper.
I was "trying to freeze her a
little bit. I don't know if it was
her inexperience or my skill, but
it worked," Berryman said.
Berryman's goal brought the
score to 3-0, where it stayed for
the rest of the match.
Reviewing the game, Cardinal
Coach Helen Keohane was
pleased with the win, but still
saw room for improvement.
We "played well the first half,
but we're still having problems,"
she said. "We're doing better,
but I wish we could have
dominated a little more."
