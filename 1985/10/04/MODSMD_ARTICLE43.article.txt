# Berryman Juggles Her Act
## 
### SCOTT ROTH 
For most Stanford University students, the
rigors of going to class and doing homework
leave little time for anything else, let alone
playing a varsity sport. But for senior Carol Ber
ryman, the task is not only possible, it is enjoy
able. Berryman has successfully managed to
juggle a major in Organizational Behavior while
becoming one of the top women's soccer players
on the West Coast. And she has managed to
keep her humility, too.
Berryman, who is a native of Greenbrae, a
small town in Marin County, has been playing soc
cer for 11 years. "I guess I started playing soc
cer because it was new at the time. All the kids
were playing, and I found out I really liked it. I en
joy it because it's a really competitive team
sport, it's great exercise, and it's just plain fun."
While she may just think of soccer as a fun
game, her play at the sweeper position shows
the ability and dedication of a true competitor.
"Along with our goalkeeper, Carol is a most vital
part of our defense," said Helen Keohane, the
team's coach.
Because of her dedication to her sport, Ber
ryman has won the attention of many and has
become a possible candidate for All-West Coast
honors. Keohane said Berryman is a real
contender if she keeps playing to potential. Ber
ryman, in her modest way, looked at her
chances with more reservation.
"I hadn't given winning (an All-Coast honor)
much thought," she said. "If I were to win some
type of award, it would be a great honor. But
more importantly, it would be a great honor for
the team. All the girls play as a team, and it
would be impossible to single out one player
without acknowledging the accomplishments of
the team, too."
Remarks like that are not rare from Ber
ryman. Due in part to her generosity, both on and
off the field, her teammates elected her team
captain. "As a sweeper, I get to hang back and
see a great portion of the field. I'm always chat
tering back there, trying to help everyone out
and encourage them as much as possible." Ber
ryman considers herself a "thinking" player who
can stabilize the "go-for-broke" instinct that
many players have.
Her attitude quickly rubs off on others.
Carolyn Denney, a freshman who plays right
wing for the Cardinal, said she greatly ap
preciates Berryman's outlook.
"She's just a great person, Denney said.
"When she gives you advice, it's always in a
friendly way. You know you can always go to her
for help, both on and off the field."

Although Berryman spends a good deal of her
time playing or training for soccer, it has not
been an all-consuming proposition. Berryman
said that despite the fact that she doesn't have a
lot of time for a social life, she does find time to
serve on a few committees. "Soccer is what I
enjoy doing, so I spend most of my time playing
or working out. The only thing I haven't had time
for is a job, and I really didn't want one anyway.
"At the beginning of the year I realized that
college was almost over, so I'm trying to live it up
a bit," she said. "Nonetheless, I'm still getting
ready for the real world. I'm living off campus
this year, and I plan to slow down a bit spring
quarter."

Berryman hopes to find work in San Francisco
as a consultant or a business analyst. "My major
is quite business-oriented. I took a lot of eco
nomics and industrial engineering classes, so I
hope it pays off. I can't see myself going back to
grad school for a while."
What would really make her Stanford years
complete? In her omnipresent humility, Ber
ryman says that she would like to see the team
make it to the playoffs. "We've got a very young
team that's getting better each game. If we had a
good year, it would really be great for them.
Also, with some success, the student body and
the Athletic Department might support us
more."
