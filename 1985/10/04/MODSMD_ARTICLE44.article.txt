# PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S DECISION ON THE DRUNK DRIVING CASE
## 
### 
A Report to the Stanford Community from the Judicial Affairs Office

Driving Intoxicated on Campus
At President Kennedy's request, I am releasing to the Stanford community informa
tion about student misconduct cases that involved precedent-setting opinions from
the 1984-85 Stanford Judicial Council.
The Background. Student Y was alleged to have been driving on campus while intoxicated;
he had student passengers at the time; he was also alleged to have backed his automobile
into a bicycle in front of a dormitory in an area designated for bicycles and pedestrians.
The Charge. Student Y was charged with a violation of the Fundamental Standard of student
conduct. Specifically, the University asserted that "Student Y was driving while drunk; that
he damaged the property of a fellow student; and that his behavior posed risk to the welfare
of his passengers as well as himself."
The Decision. The following paragraphs are extracted from perhaps 100 pages of text rele
vant to this judicial case (including the Hearing Officer's report, the SJC opinion and re
commendation, the appeal lodged by Student Y's attorney, and President Kennedy's
decision letter. Those who are interested in details that may not be included below may
review selected case materials in the Judicial Affairs Office, 322 Old Union.
".. . Without enumerating .. . each argument made by Student Y and his attorney, I think
they can be summarized as bearing for the most part on two questions: did the University
have the right (jurisdiction) to subject Student Y to disciplinary proceedings; and was Stu
dent Y's disciplinary case adjudicated in accordance with the rules and procedures set
forth in the Legislative and Judicial Charter. For the following reasons, I conclude the an
swer to both questions is yes.
. . Student Y claims that the essence of the University charge against him is a Vehicle
Code violation; and that because Stanford's traffic policy states that all penalties for Vehicle
Code violations will be assessed by the appropriate State court, the University has no
power 'to redress student conduct in the driving of a motor vehicle on campus.' Addition
ally, he argues, because the Student Conduct Legislative Council has not legislated stu
dent driving on campus, the University traffic policy occupies 'the field of the subject
matter, thereby excluding the subject matter from the SJC's jurisdiction.' I do not agree.
"The essence of the University's charge against Student Y is that he drove his car in a con
dition and in a manner inconsistent with the rights and welfare of others on this campus, in
violation of University 'Law' — the Fundamental Standard. That his conduct also constituted
citable offenses under California law is coincidental; it does not immunize him from institu
tional accountability.
"It is true that the SCLC has not promulgated motor vehicle legislation. In point of fact, the
SCLC has not defined any of the specific non-academic activities (such as theft or assault)
that typically form the basis of discipline under the Fundamental Standard as subject to, or
exempt from judicial review . . . The Fundamental Standard is the relevant law for University
purposes, and the SJC has exclusive jurisdiction to determine if that law has been violated.
In Student Y's case, the SJC determined that it had been. The SJC cannot, and did not, pur
port to determine whether the Vehicle Code or any other California statutory offenses oc
curred.
. . Academic communities have the right to formulate and enforce their own standards of
conduct, which may grant greater freedom or impose greater restriction on their members
than laws binding citizens of the State at large. If the same events lead to proceedings in
both jurisdictions, each must judge the facts in accordance with its own rules. Stanford's
'legal regime' is not identical with criminal court proceedings, even if the standard of proof

is the same; to make the two identical would be both impractical and detrimental to the edu
cational atmosphere and function of the University. Thus, facts found in one proceeding will
not necessarily be found in the other, nor will the same facts necessarily be relevant in each
setting. Each community has, in this case, a similar but independent interest in deterring
drunk driving, but neither determines the other's adjudication of their respective interests.
. . Student Y's . . . alleged procedural irregularity is that he had no notice that drunk
driving might be a Fundamental Standard violation. It may be true that Student Y's case is
one of first impression; I note, however, the SJC's discussion of this point, and agree with its
conclusion that 'ignorance of the precise requirements of the Fundamental Standard can
hardly be said to excuse the kind of blatant misconduct Student Y engaged in.' I also note
that the SJC took this point into consideration in assessing penalties, as it has in the past
when faced with precedent-setting cases.
"Turning now to the SJC opinion itself: I believe that Dean Lyons makes a powerful case for
viewing drunk driving as a Fundamental Standard violation per se. On the other hand, I
think the formula proposed by the SJC for case-by -case determination reasonably ad
dresses our serious concerns about this problem, and I accept its recommendation. . .
"Penalties. By the penalties invoked against Student Y, the SJC makes quite clear the
seriousness of the Fundamental Standard offense. I concur in that judgment and the pur
pose thus implied for the penalties — to deter students from driving on this campus while
drunk. Let me discuss each penalty in general and as it applies to Student Y in particular.
"(1) Suspension. I agree that suspension from the University is an appropriate penalty for
the type and magnitude of this Fundamental Standard offense. I also agree that because
this is a case of 'first impression,' Student Y should receive a suspended one-quarter
suspension.
"(2) . . . Until the end of the first quarter as a registered student after Student Y returns from
Oxford, he shall refrain from driving or storing a motor vehicle on this campus. Violation of
this probationary condition will reinstate automatically the postponed suspension.
"(3) Work or Monetary Fine . . . Student Y shall choose between a 40-hour work fine or a
monetary fine of $200 . ..
"(4) Damages ... In cases where assessable damages have occurred, restitution is appro
priate. In Student Y's case, I note that restitution also was ordered by the court in his crimi
nal trial. Because I do not infer that the SJC intended to impose double damages, Student Y
will be considered to have satisfied this institutional penalty on providing to the Dean of
Student Affairs proof of compliance with the court order.
. . By copy of this letter to the Dean of Student Affairs, I ask that he take the appropriate
steps to put these penalties into effect Conferral of Student Y's undergraduate Stanford
degree will, of course, be contingent on his satisfying each of them.
"Lastly, by copy of this letter to the Judicial Affairs Office, I ask Ms. Cole to undertake to
give wide circulation to those portions of the SJC opinion and this letter of general interest
to the University community, to reaffirm that the Fundamental Standard and the University's
judicial system are the appropriate means to deal with student drunk driving on this
campus."

A Report to the Stanford Community from the Judicial Affairs Office

Driving Intoxicated on Campus
At President Kennedy's request, I am releasing to the Stanford community informa
tion about student misconduct cases that involved precedent-setting opinions from
the 1984-85 Stanford Judicial Council.
The Background. Student Y was alleged to have been driving on campus while intoxicated;
he had student passengers at the time; he was also alleged to have backed his automobile
into a bicycle in front of a dormitory in an area designated for bicycles and pedestrians.
The Charge. Student Y was charged with a violation of the Fundamental Standard of student
conduct. Specifically, the University asserted that "Student Y was driving while drunk; that
he damaged the property of a fellow student; and that his behavior posed risk to the welfare
of his passengers as well as himself."
The Decision. The following paragraphs are extracted from perhaps 100 pages of text rele
vant to this judicial case (including the Hearing Officer's report, the SJC opinion and re
commendation, the appeal lodged by Student Y's attorney, and President Kennedy's
decision letter. Those who are interested in details that may not be included below may
review selected case materials in the Judicial Affairs Office, 322 Old Union.
".. . Without enumerating .. . each argument made by Student Y and his attorney, I think
they can be summarized as bearing for the most part on two questions: did the University
have the right (jurisdiction) to subject Student Y to disciplinary proceedings; and was Stu
dent Y's disciplinary case adjudicated in accordance with the rules and procedures set
forth in the Legislative and Judicial Charter. For the following reasons, I conclude the an
swer to both questions is yes.
. . Student Y claims that the essence of the University charge against him is a Vehicle
Code violation; and that because Stanford's traffic policy states that all penalties for Vehicle
Code violations will be assessed by the appropriate State court, the University has no
power 'to redress student conduct in the driving of a motor vehicle on campus.' Addition
ally, he argues, because the Student Conduct Legislative Council has not legislated stu
dent driving on campus, the University traffic policy occupies 'the field of the subject
matter, thereby excluding the subject matter from the SJC's jurisdiction.' I do not agree.
"The essence of the University's charge against Student Y is that he drove his car in a con
dition and in a manner inconsistent with the rights and welfare of others on this campus, in
violation of University 'Law' — the Fundamental Standard. That his conduct also constituted
citable offenses under California law is coincidental; it does not immunize him from institu
tional accountability.
"It is true that the SCLC has not promulgated motor vehicle legislation. In point of fact, the
SCLC has not defined any of the specific non-academic activities (such as theft or assault)
that typically form the basis of discipline under the Fundamental Standard as subject to, or
exempt from judicial review . . . The Fundamental Standard is the relevant law for University
purposes, and the SJC has exclusive jurisdiction to determine if that law has been violated.
In Student Y's case, the SJC determined that it had been. The SJC cannot, and did not, pur
port to determine whether the Vehicle Code or any other California statutory offenses oc
curred.
. . Academic communities have the right to formulate and enforce their own standards of
conduct, which may grant greater freedom or impose greater restriction on their members
than laws binding citizens of the State at large. If the same events lead to proceedings in
both jurisdictions, each must judge the facts in accordance with its own rules. Stanford's
'legal regime' is not identical with criminal court proceedings, even if the standard of proof

is the same; to make the two identical would be both impractical and detrimental to the edu
cational atmosphere and function of the University. Thus, facts found in one proceeding will
not necessarily be found in the other, nor will the same facts necessarily be relevant in each
setting. Each community has, in this case, a similar but independent interest in deterring
drunk driving, but neither determines the other's adjudication of their respective interests.
. . Student Y's . . . alleged procedural irregularity is that he had no notice that drunk
driving might be a Fundamental Standard violation. It may be true that Student Y's case is
one of first impression; I note, however, the SJC's discussion of this point, and agree with its
conclusion that 'ignorance of the precise requirements of the Fundamental Standard can
hardly be said to excuse the kind of blatant misconduct Student Y engaged in.' I also note
that the SJC took this point into consideration in assessing penalties, as it has in the past
when faced with precedent-setting cases.
"Turning now to the SJC opinion itself: I believe that Dean Lyons makes a powerful case for
viewing drunk driving as a Fundamental Standard violation per se. On the other hand, I
think the formula proposed by the SJC for case-by -case determination reasonably ad
dresses our serious concerns about this problem, and I accept its recommendation. . .
"Penalties. By the penalties invoked against Student Y, the SJC makes quite clear the
seriousness of the Fundamental Standard offense. I concur in that judgment and the pur
pose thus implied for the penalties — to deter students from driving on this campus while
drunk. Let me discuss each penalty in general and as it applies to Student Y in particular.
"(1) Suspension. I agree that suspension from the University is an appropriate penalty for
the type and magnitude of this Fundamental Standard offense. I also agree that because
this is a case of 'first impression,' Student Y should receive a suspended one-quarter
suspension.
"(2) . . . Until the end of the first quarter as a registered student after Student Y returns from
Oxford, he shall refrain from driving or storing a motor vehicle on this campus. Violation of
this probationary condition will reinstate automatically the postponed suspension.
"(3) Work or Monetary Fine . . . Student Y shall choose between a 40-hour work fine or a
monetary fine of $200 . ..
"(4) Damages ... In cases where assessable damages have occurred, restitution is appro
priate. In Student Y's case, I note that restitution also was ordered by the court in his crimi
nal trial. Because I do not infer that the SJC intended to impose double damages, Student Y
will be considered to have satisfied this institutional penalty on providing to the Dean of
Student Affairs proof of compliance with the court order.
. . By copy of this letter to the Dean of Student Affairs, I ask that he take the appropriate
steps to put these penalties into effect Conferral of Student Y's undergraduate Stanford
degree will, of course, be contingent on his satisfying each of them.
"Lastly, by copy of this letter to the Judicial Affairs Office, I ask Ms. Cole to undertake to
give wide circulation to those portions of the SJC opinion and this letter of general interest
to the University community, to reaffirm that the Fundamental Standard and the University's
judicial system are the appropriate means to deal with student drunk driving on this
campus."
