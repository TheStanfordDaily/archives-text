U.S. and Libya Clash at U.N.
UNITED NATIONS — The second day of Security Council
debate over the Israeli bombing raid against Tunisia broke off yester
day in a heated exchange between the United States and Libya.
U.S. Ambassador Vernon Walters, president of the 15-nation
council, angrily rebuked the foreign ministers of Libya and Cuba,
who had accused the United States of complicity in the Israeli attack.
"My country has fought two great wars for freedom in this cen
tury," Walters declared before adjourning the session until tomor
row. "We have annexed no territory nor have we enslaved any
people.
"My country has suffered grievously at the hands of terrorists,"
Walters continued. "Many American ambassadors have been killed;
many Americans have been hijacked and terrorized. Fairly recently,
a young American sailor was slowly and brutally beaten to death. We
have felt the acts of terrorism on our people.
"From states like Libya or Cuba, we accept no lessons in interna
tional conduct, nor do we permit them to determine our foreign
policy."
Speaking earlier, Libyan Foreign Minister Aii Tureiki charged that
Israel, which he called the Zionist entity, could never be curbed be
cause "the plague of Zionism" is protected by the U.S. veto in the
Security Council.
No resolution has yet been formally presented to the council, al
though Tunisia has asked for council condemnation of Israel and pay
ment of reparations for the deaths of 60 people and the physical
damage to the PLO complex.
An Israeli source who spoke on condition that he not be identified
reported that Israeli Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir had contacted
Secretary of State George Shultz privately yesterday and asked him
to ensure a U.S. veto of any condemnation of Israel.
However, a senior State Department official said yesterday that
the United States has implicitly warned Israel against attacking
Palestine Liberation Organization bases in Jordan the way Israeli
warplanes attacked a PLO facility in Tunisia Tuesday.
"King Hussein (of Jordan) probably has as good or better a record
of fighting terrorism as anybody," the official said. Asked whether
the United States had issued any warning to Jerusalem, he
responded, "I think they (the Israelis) are well aware of King Hus
sein's record on terrorism."
British Unemployment Soars
LONDON — The number of unemployed workers jumped to its
highest total in British history last month: 13.8 percent of the work
force, or nearly one worker out of seven.
According to government figures released yesterday, the Septem
ber figure grew more than 100,000 over August to more than 3.3
million people out of work and claiming unemployment benefits.
The figures came as a blow to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
government as her Conservative Party prepares for its annual con
ference next week. They are likely to fuel those in the party who
believe that Thatcher's tight budget policies must change if the Con
servatives are to win re-election.
Repeated polls show unemployment has become the govern
ment's biggest political problem. More than any other issue, it has
moved opposition parties to start campaigning in earnest at least two
years before the next general election.
The opposition Labor Party lost no time condemning Thatcher at
its own party conference in Bournemouth. Labor's employment
spokesman, John Prescott, quickly noted that the figure had set a na
tional record "higher than we had in the 19305."
Some increase was anticipated, as the September figures include
youths who left school this spring but were not allowed to apply for
unemployment benefits until fall. Government officials quickly
pointed this out, and noted the seasonally adjusted figure for adult
unemployment actually showed a decrease of nearly 3,000.
The legions of unemployed consist primarily of unskilled youths
and workers laid off by large industries in the north and central
regions.
OPEC Deadlocked on Quotas
VIENNA, Austria — For the second time in three months, the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) failed yes
terday to come to terms with demands from member countries for a
greater share of the world's stagnant oil market.
The failure underscored the internal divisions and conflicting
needs of the 13 members of the cartel that have served virtually to
paralyze its policy-making.
After meeting more tnan four hours yesterday in an extraordinary
session called to deal with growing demands for increased production
quotas, OPEC ministers were unable to break the deadlock that had
frustrated a previous meeting on the same issue in July.
As a result, they again deferred a decision until the next regular
meeting in December.
Yesterday's failure to come to grips with the issue, which is crucial
for some of its more financially strapped members, triggered threats
from Ecuador, one of OPEC's smaller producers, to quit the organi
zation. If Ecuador leaves, it would be the first resignation in OPEC's
25-year history.
General Speaks on 'Dirty War'
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — A former junta member facing life
imprisonment on charges of massive human rights abuses told a
court here yesterday,"I feel responsible, but not guilty."
Speaking in his own defense at a historic trial, Adm. Emilio
Massera said: "No one should have to defend himself for winning a
just war. The war against terrorism was a just war."
Massera is accused of helping mastermind the armed forces' so
called "Dirty War" against Marxist guerrillas, in which thousands of
suspects were kidnapped, tortured and murdered.
"If there was a war, naturally there were excesses," Massera
said. "The allegation has tried to prove that excesses were the
norm. No one can make the officers of the armed forces a gang of
criminals."
Massera charged that "the winners are being accused by the
losers." The armed forces, he said, had won the battles but lost the
"psychological war" to the extent that, in the public mind, "criminals
have become victims. . . . Words have been twisted to the point that
'terrorism' means 'democracy,' and those of us who fought terrorism
became the terrorists."
In two days of summation that ended before Massera's statement,
his lawyer Jaime Prats argued for acquittal due to insufficient
evidence. In asking for life imprisonment, the stiffest possible sen
tence, for Massera, federal prosecutors accused him of responsibility
for 83 murders, 523 illegal detentions and hundreds of lesser crimes.
