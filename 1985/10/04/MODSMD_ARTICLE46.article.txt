# Reaction to Israeli raid
## Terrorists Execute U.S. Envoy 
### 
BEIRUT, Lebanon — The terrorist Shia
group Islamic Jihad (Holy War) has executed
American Embassy official William Buckley, who
was kidnapped 18 months ago, the British
Broadcasting Corporation reported today.
Quoting the independent Lebanese newspa
per An Nahar, the BBC said the group killed
Buckley in retaliation for the Israeli raid on the
headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organi
zation in Tunisia Tuesday.
The group accused Buckley of heading the
American Central Intelligence Agency in
Lebanon, the BBC quoted the newspaper as
saying.
Spokesmen for the White House and State De
partment said in Washington they had no inde
pendent confirmation of the report.
Buckley, 57, the chief political officer at the
U.S. Embassy here, was abducted from his car
in west Beirut on March 18, 1984. He has been
held the longest of the six American hostages
still in Lebanon.
Islamic Jihad, a fundamentalist Shiite Moslem

group with ties to Iran, recently warned through
released hostage Benjamin Weir that it would kill
the American hostages if Washington did not
pressure Kuwait to release 17 Shiites jailed for a
series of bombings in that country. The Shiite
fundamentalist group is a rival of the Sunni group
that claimed responsibility for kidnapping the
four Soviet citizens.
The statement published by An Nahar saying
Buckley had been killed was hand delivered to
the newspaper office along with a color photo
graph of Buckley.
"We declare a revenge for the blood of the
martyrs by announcing the execution of the
death sentence for the American CIA agent in
the Middle East and the head of its Lebanon sta
tion and the first political adviser at the American
Embassy in Lebanon, the spy William Buckley,
after publishing this statement," said the group's
statement, hand-delivered to An Nahar. All of
the other statements the paper has received
from Islamic Jihad have proved to be authentic.
Meanwhile, Syrian President Hafez Assad and

a fundamentalist Islamic faction besieged by
Syrian allies in northern Lebanon agreed yester
day night to an immediate but uncertain cease
fire, and the Soviet Union reportedly told its em
bassy here to begin evacuating dependents and
some diplomats today.
There was no further information about the
fate of three Soviet officials kidnapped Monday.
They were among four seized by the fundamen
talist Sunni Moslem faction, which has demanded
an end to the attacks against it by Syrian-allied
leftist Moslem militias. One of the four was found
shot to death Wednesday.
The cease-fire agreement was signed in
Damascus yesterday by Sheik Saeed Chaaban,
leader of the Tawheed militia of the fundamen
talist Sunni Islamic Unification Movement, and
leaders of the Arab Democratic Party, one of
four Syrian-sponsored leftist militias that have
been battling Tawheed for control of Tripoli,
Lebanon's second-largest city. In 19 days of
fighting, more than 500 people have been killed
and 1,100 wounded.
