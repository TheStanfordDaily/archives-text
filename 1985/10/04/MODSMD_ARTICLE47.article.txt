# Soviet Leader Outlines New Arms Plan

### 
PARIS — Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev yesterday offered a new
Soviet arms control initiative by
publicly proposing that the United
States and the Soviet Union agree
to halve their strategic missile
forces and negotiate a total ban on
the development and deployment of
space weapons.
Unveiling the wide-ranging arms
control proposals during a speech
to French legislators, Gorbachev
significantly altered several previ
ous Soviet negotiating positions in
a bid apparently calculated to rally
European public opinion behind him
before he meets President Reagan
in Geneva next month.
In addition to confirming that So
viet negotiators have already of
fered a proposal calling for 50 per
cent cuts in strategic weapons by
the superpowers, Gorbachev also
made these points in his speech:
• Insisting that Moscow could "no

longer ignore" the modernization of
French and British nuclear arsen
als, he called on France and Britain
to join the Soviet Union in direct
arms talks. Previously, the Soviets
considered French and British
missiles as part of the overall West
ern total in bilateral arms negotia
tions with the United States.
• Gorbachev disclosed that the So
viet Union had unilaterally reduced
the number of its SS-20 medium
range missiles stationed "in the
European zone" and targeted on
Western Europe to 243, the June
1984 level. This action is a clear at
tempt to influence the decision to
be made by the Dutch government
Nov. 1 to approve or reject the
stationing of U.S. cruise missiles in
the Netherlands.
• The Kremlin leader defined the
term "strategic forces" in a way
that includes U.S. medium-range

Pershing and cruise missiles sta
tioned in Europe but excludes So
viet SS-20s with European targets.
His formula calls into question the
future of the U.S.-Soviet talks on
medium-range missiles at Geneva
that were previously linked, at So
viet insistence, with parallel talks
on strategic and space weapons.
Gorbachev said that the imple
mentation of the Soviet proposals
would result in a substantial step
forward to the goal of "prohibition
and total liquidation of nuclear
arms, the total delivery of mankind
from the threat of nuclear war."
"There can be no victors in a nu
clear war," he told the legislators.
"It is time to draw a practical con
clusion from this: stop the arms
race."
While advancing no specific new
proposals on outer space weapons
systems, Gorbachev appeared to

interject a deliberate note of am
biguity into the strident Soviet at
tacks on President Reagan's Strate
gic Defense Initiative by omitting a
specific call for a ban on research on
space weapons.
Although Western experts were
virtually unanimous in praising the
skill with which Gorbachev pre
sented the new Soviet proposals,
there was much greater skepticism
about the detailed content of the
package.
Both French and British officials
reacted coolly to the new Soviet
leader's call for direct talks on
theater nuclear weapons in Europe.
In the past, both countries have
refused to consider such negotia
tions on the grounds that their inde
pendent nuclear forces are insignifi
cant compared to the very much
larger arsenals of the two super
powers.
