Budget Plan Propelled
WASHINGTON — Senate and House Re
publican leaders yesterday closed ranks behind
a plan to balance the federal budget within six
years, and House Speaker Thomas (Tip)
O'Neill (D-Mass.) said Democrats, as well,
may embrace "something of that nature."
President Reagan said he was "in agree
ment 5 ' with goals of the plan. While he stopped
short of an outright endorsement, White
House officials and Senate Majority Leader
Robert Dole (R-Kan.) said they expect Reagan
to do so tomorrow.
The plan would mandate a reduction of
roughly $36 billion a year in the deficit, which
is now estimated at $180 billion. By 1991, the
budget would be balanced. The plan is in the
form of an amendment to legislation raising the
government's debt ceiling from $1.8 trillion to
$2 trillion.
The government's cash balances are ex
pected to run out by Monday, and the debt
limit extension must be passed by then so the
government can continue borrowing to pay its
bills.
While Congress earlier this year approved
spending reductions of $55.5 billion for next
year, deficits remain the dominant issue on
Capitol Hill, and many lawmakers are reluctant
to raise the debt ceiling to $2 trillion without

further action to curb deficits.
That reluctance gave impetus to the
balanced-budget proposal, which originated
with Sens. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), Warren
Rudman (R-N.H.) and Ernest Hollings (D-
S.C). One House Democrat said the proposal
roared through Congress like a "firestorm."
Republicans yesterday rushed to endorse it,
and Democrats scrambled to come up with
their own alternatives.
But there were also some qualms about the
proposal.
The Administration was pushing for changes
to protect defense spending from big cutbacks,
which appeared likely if the automatic reduc
tions came into play. Several senators voiced
misgivings about exclusion of Social Security
from automatic cutback provisions, with some
of them expressing fear that its exclusion
would increase the burden of cutbacks for
benefit programs aimed at the poor.
And Democrats were quick to blame
Republicans for creating the deficit crisis in the
first place.
House Kills Farm Plan
WASHINGTON — A bipartisan House coal
ition gave the Reagan Administration a major
victory on farm policy yesterday, defeating a

proposed new system of crop production con
trols that was aimed at boosting the incomes of
struggling wheat and corn growers.
"I'm extremely pleased," Secretary of
Agriculture John Block said after the House
voted 251 to 174 to strip the hotly contested
provision from a five-year, $141 billion farm
bill, a measure that would spend several billion
more than President Reagan has said he
wants.
Eighty- two Democrats ignored the pleas of
their top party leaders and joined 169
Republicans in rejecting the plan.
The proposal, sponsored by Rep. Berkley
Bedell (D-Iowa) would have allowed wheat and
corn farmers to decide in a national referen
dum whether they wanted cuts of up to 50 per
cent in planted acreage in exchange for sharp
increases in crop price supports.
Proponents of the plan, including Midwes
tern House Democrats and a grass-roots farm
group, the American Agriculture Movement,
called it a necessary gamble and contended
that it would have pumped up farm incomes
while reducing huge grain surpluses.
Opponents, however, argued that the farm
bill already contained a better alternative for
boosting incomes: reductions in government
price supports, thus making American crops
more competitive in fast-growing foreign
markets.
