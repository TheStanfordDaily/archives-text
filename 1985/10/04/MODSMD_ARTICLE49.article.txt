One Charge Dropped
SAN DIEGO — The judge in Mayor Roger
Hedgecock's perjury and conspiracy trial
dropped one peijury charge against the mayor
yesterday and handed the case to jurors, who
deliberated nearly 10 hours without reaching a
verdict.
Superior Court Judge William Todd dropped
count 13 because of insufficient evidence. The
count accused Hedgecock of failing to disclose
campaign contributions on an amended eco
nomic interest statement covering the time
from Jan. 1, 1983 to May 19, 1983. The contri
butions were alleged to be in the form of inter
est payments paid by J. David & Co. principal
Nancy Hoover on a note she owned.
The mayor faces automatic expulsion from
office if convicted on any of 14 felony perjury
and conspiracy charges.

Lottery Begins
Lady luck opened up shop yesterday in Cali
fornia, as the state's first government-run lot
tery premiered with parties, parades and pro
motions but with the governor conspicuously
absent from the festivities.
Lottery director Mark Michalko reported
that within five-and-one-half hours of the 12:30
p.m. kickoff, 90 players apparently had
become the first to win top "instant" prizes of
$5,000.
The Sacramento lottery headquarters must
validate the winning tickets before the larger
prizes are awarded.
Based upon a survey of 200 retailers, and
other factors, Michalko projected that sales
through 9 p.m. were 10.9 million tickets.

Water Pact Sought
WASHINGTON — The House Interior
Committee was urged by California and
Nevada lawmakers yesterday to approve legis
lation to settle a long-standing water-rights
dispute, but Indians and environmentalists said
the panel should reject the proposal.
The bill, sponsored by Reps. Barbara
Vucanovich (R-Nev.) and Harry Reid (D-
Nev.), would settle several legal issues that in
volve intense competition for limited water
supplies from the Truckee and Carson rivers.
The proposal would force the dropping of a
number of lawsuits over the region's water and
ratify the still-pending California-Nevada Com
pact that would divide up water at Lake Tahoe
and in the Walker, Carson and Truckee river
basins.
