# Right-wing Watchdog Group Turns to Colleges
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
A Washington D.C.-based organization
has begun monitoring history and political
science classes in universities across the
nation, seeking to discourage left-wing pro
fessors from "propagandizing rather than
teaching" college students.
Accuracy in Academia (AIA) is con
cerned with a "balance of ideas in the class
room," according to Executive Director
Les Csorba, who said that Stanford is not
now among the schools being monitored.
The group, which became active in Au
gust amid harsh criticism from scholars and

civil-rights activists, uses students who
have contacted the organization as class
room monitors. The organization will at
tempt to validate the student's complaints,
said Csorba, by contacting the professor in
question. Results will be published in an
AIA newsletter.
"We're strong defenders of free speech
for professors," Csorba said in a telephone
interview Wednesday. "But free speech
carries responsibility."
Csorba admitted that no calls or letters
had come from Stanford, but said that stu
dents from many other California schools,
including UC-Berkeley and UCLA, had con
tacted the group.
In response to Stanford Political Science

Prof. Hubert Marshall's comment in August
that AIA is "a reincarnation of the
McCarthy era," Csorba said that such
statements are "hypocritical."
"We're not labeling anybody commu
nists," Csorba said. "Are they afraid of the
public finding out what happens in the class
rooms?"
Political Science Prof. John Manley, who
previously has labeled the organization "a
radical right truth squad," said Csorba's
response ignores "the implicit claim that
classes they are monitoring are presenting
a distorted view."
"For them to monitor classes, there is an
assumption that the professor is presenting
a one-sided view which they need to cor

rect, said Manley. "That's a questionable
assumption."
"I'd like to feel that any student enrolled
in my class would raise objections to any
thing I've said to me personally," Manley
said.
Jordan Kurland, director of staff in the
area of academic freedom at the American
Association of University Professors, yes
terday described his group's position on
AIA as "watchful waiting."
"Everyone seems to be waiting for AlA's
first case," Kurland said. "It hasn't hap
pened yet."
He noted that the organization "is going
all over the country." and that a group of

college students in Texas had announced
they were forming their own version of
AIA.
"I guess they feel Washington D.C. is too
far away," Kurland said.
Thomas Mann of the American Political
Science Association, who in an Aug. 5
Washington Post article called AIA partici
pants "intellectual goon squads," said in a
telephone interview yesierdav that AlA's
stance is "based on faulty views of what the
academic world is like."
"We'll have to see if it turns into anything
of consequence," Mann said.
"We're not looking for problems,
but if scholars are jeopardized, then
we'll lend a hand."
Mann said that he believed uni
versities such as Stanford "would
shrug this kind of thing off."
Senior Dave Konuch, a history
major, said yesterday that for AIA
to monitor classes was "insulting."
"College students are adults,"
Konuch said, "they can decide
what's true and what's false."
According to Csorba, AIA also
plans to support former anthropol
ogy student Steven Mosher in his
efforts to be reinstated at Stanford.

Mosher, whose expulsion was up
held Tuesday by University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy, contends
that he was dismissed because he
wrote an article condemning
Chinese birth-control policies.
Csorba explained that Mosher's
case interests AIA because the
group is concerned generally with
freedom of expression.
"It's the case of a student who
found unpopular information and
was dismissed because of pressure
from the Chinese government,"
Csorba said.
Mosher acknowledged that he
had talked to Csorba and that AIA
had "expressed support."
"We didn't talk about anything
concrete," Mosher added.

Science Association, who in an Aug. 5
Washington Post article called AIA partici
pants "intellectual goon squads," said in a
telephone interview yesierdav that AlA's
stance is "based on faulty views of what the
academic world is like."
"We'll have to see if it turns into anything
of consequence," Mann said.
"We're not looking for problems,
but if scholars are jeopardized, then
we'll lend a hand."
Mann said that he believed uni
versities such as Stanford "would
shrug this kind of thing off."
Senior Dave Konuch, a history
major, said yesterday that for AIA
to monitor classes was "insulting."
"College students are adults,"
Konuch said, "they can decide
what's true and what's false."
According to Csorba, AIA also
plans to support former anthropol
ogy student Steven Mosher in his
efforts to be reinstated at Stanford.

Mosher, whose expulsion was up
held Tuesday by University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy, contends
that he was dismissed because he
wrote an article condemning
Chinese birth-control policies.
Csorba explained that Mosher's
case interests AIA because the
group is concerned generally with
freedom of expression.
"It's the case of a student who
found unpopular information and
was dismissed because of pressure
from the Chinese government,"
Csorba said.
Mosher acknowledged that he
had talked to Csorba and that AIA
had "expressed support."
"We didn't talk about anything
concrete," Mosher added.
