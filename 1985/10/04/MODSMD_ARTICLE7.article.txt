# New Comp Sci Major Goes on Line
## 
### JIMMY DEE 
Every hacker who grows up here in the heart
of Silicon Valley now has a new challenge,
second only to breaking into the Pentagon sys
tem — a computer science major from Stanford.
The University's Computer Science Depart
ment is trying to offer an undergraduate com
puter science major some time in the near
future.
In the past, such an option has only been open
to graduate students, though undergraduates
have used various surrogate methods to effec
tively major in computer science.
Computer Science Department Chairman Nils
Nilsson said that one of the most popular of
these methods is the math and computational
science interdepartmental major.
About 100 students are presently participating
in this independently designed program, accord
ing to Nilsson.
"Recently, we've noticed the undergraduates
want to major in computer science," Nilsson
said.
As a comparison, anywhere from 400 to 500
students are presently involved in the under

graduate computer science program at MIT, an
institution with a smaller enrollment than Stan
ford.
Nilsson said that the faculty was resistant to
previous proposals for such a major.
John Scoggins, a graduate student in the com
puter science program, said. "The department
should be ashamed that it does not offer an un
dergraduate program."
He said that such a program is necessary
preparation for graduate school and that there
are various convoluted ways to get that now, but
that they should be more straightforward.
He also noted that some of the faculty mem
bers opposed to the undergraduate program
might be afraid that it would become a training
school for programmers.
"None of us intended that the degree be a ter
minal degree," Nilsson said. He added that it
was intended more as a preparatory program for
graduate school.
Even now, the field of computer science
remains almost exclusively in the domain of
graduate schools.
An important reason that Stanford and other
such technically oriented institutions do not have
undergraduate programs may be that faculty

members are afraid that such programs would
detract from the quality of the graduate pro
grams.
Certainly, an undergraduate program would
be very demanding of the department's re
sources unless it expands. However, additions
to faculty and equipment are planned if the un
dergraduate program is approved, according to
Nilsson.
The department is beginning to run out of
space, as well, and is discussing the construction
of a new computer science building in the Near
West Campus area.
While new courses will probably be added to
the curriculum, such additions will not likely be
more than what would normally be added from
time to time.
The proposed computer science degree will
be an Engineering Science degree, and as such
will require less engineering breadth and more
depth in the major.
On the other hand, the major would only re
quire 102 to 107 units of specialized major
courses, as opposed to the 117 required for
other engineering degrees.
This would give a student major
ing in the field the opportunity to
take more courses in areas outside
the major, which is in keeping with
the spirit of the University's distri
bution requirements, according to
Nilsson.
In addition, the proposed pro
gram would give a student the op
portunity to work on his or her own
programming project, which could
be related to any other field that is
of interest.
The campaign for the new under
graduate computer science major is
only the first in a series of planned
additions to the department's cur

riculum. Two other majors pres
ently under consideration are
symbolic systems, a four
department major, and computer
systems engineering, a major which
would emphasize the synthesis of
computer science and electrical en
gineering.
This campaign for an expanded
computer science curriculum began
with Nilsson's appointment as the
department's chair.
Nilsson predicted that within two
or three years there will be a sub
stantial increase in the number of
majors offered by the computer sci
ence department. He also prog
nosticated that computer science,
with molecular biology, will become
even more popular during the end
of this century and into the next.
