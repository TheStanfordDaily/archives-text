# Lottery Takes Off
## 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
For a brief moment yesterday, a policeman,
a secretary, two maintenance men, a student
and a firefighter shared a place in history —
they were among the first to buy California lot
tery tickets at the Campus Shell station.
The first-ever California lottery opened with
a bang at 12:30 p.m., with parades and
speeches in four major cities. But at Stanford,
things were a little quieter.

The first customer pulled away from the sta
tion with a fistful of tickets before even a min
ute of the lottery had passed, and, by 12:40,
half a dozen folks had taken their chances at
winning the $2 million grand prize.
"How many's it gonna take for you to get
lucky?" Shell station owner Gary Andrews
asked repeatedly as customers forked over a
buck apiece for the rainbow-colored tickets.

A few hours later, things began to pay off.
One lucky lottery player won $1,000 on a
ticket from Campus Shell, according to an em
ployee there.
By day's end, the station had sold all 1,000
tickets it had, and more have been ordered.
Two Stanford juniors, Mike Puddington and
Scott Mair, caught lottery fever early yester

day, winning a $100 prize that could put them
in contention for the $2 million jackpot.
Mair bought nine tickets from Town &
Country Pharmacy, scratched off one — a
loser — and planned to send the rest as gifts to
friends back home. But fellow Theta Delt Pud
dington convinced Mair to give him a ticket to
scratch off, and the rest may be history.
