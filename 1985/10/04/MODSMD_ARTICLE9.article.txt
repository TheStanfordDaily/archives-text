# Kennedy: Money for Youth
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
In a speech before the San Diego Rotary Club yes
terday, University President Donald Kennedy said that
the low priority given to the problems of American
youth today will create an older generation in the
future that will be even more dependent than the el
derly generation of the 1980s.
"We think of ourselves as a youth-oriented society,
yet in recent years we have been moving in exactly the
opposite direction," Kennedy said at the noon-time
presentation at the Sheraton Harbor Island Hotel in
San Diego.

Noting the decreased rate of literacy, declining stan
dardized test scores and increased poverty rates
among children in the last few years, Kennedy said,
"Without really meaning to, we have redirected our so
ciety's resources away from the young and toward
those at the other end of the life cycle."
Drawing on his experience as chairman of the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration during the Carter Ad
ministration, Kennedy added, "I am struck by the
amount of money being spent and attention expended
upon cancer and cancer causation compared to that ex
pended on birth defects and on environmental in
fluences that might impare the intellectual and physical
development of young children."
Kennedy said that increased investment in the

younger generation would lead to increased productiv
ity over the next several decades, whereas investment
in the elderly produces no such benefits to society as a
whole.
"An expenditure on a young life is leveraged, be
cause it produces improvements that last for many
decades. The same investment in an older person does
not keep generating returns in this way. Thus the
spending choice is not between today's elderly and
today's young. Looked at realistically, it is a choice be
tween spending on today's elderly and on tomorrow's
elderly.
Kennedy cited a growth in health expenditures and
other statistics as evidence of the decreased attention
given the younger generation.
