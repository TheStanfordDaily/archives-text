# Red Barn Renovation Celebrated
## 
### KELLY SUND 
The people responsible for the
$1 million restoration of the Red
E>?rn, one of Stanford's most his
toric buildings, met Saturday to
celebrate the completion of the
project.
The renovation of the Barn, lo
cated neat* Governor's Corner, is
the first step in the University's
plan to landscape, improve the
corrals and paddocks, and create a
new access road off Campus
Drive West to the 13-acre site.
The existing Fremont Road will
eventually be blocked off at
Junipero Serra Boulevard.
The Red Barn was originally
completed in 1879 and was built to
serve as the training stable for
Leland Stanford's Palo Alto Stock
Farm. The University's
nickname, the Farm, is derived
from its days as a stock farm.
From 1880 to 1895, 13 horses
from the stock farm set 19 world
records. Nine of these horses
were sired by Electioneer, in one
of the world's first scientific
breeding experiments selecting
for speed.

The funds for the renovation
project came from private contri
butions and the University. Over
half of the $1 million was raised in
just six weeks by L.W. Lane, Jr.,
chairman of Lane Publishing Com
pany and the newly nominated
U.S. ambassador to Australia.
Lane collected donations from
nearly 200 companies, founda
tions and individuals. Equestrian
Associates, Ltd., which leases the
barn for its riding school and
boarding facility, also contributed
money, and the University pro

vided the remainder of the funds.
In addition to raising money,
Lane unveiled a statue of Elec
tioneer that he donated. Sculpted
by Dian Weeks, the statue will
stand at the entrance to the Barn.
In a short speech Saturday,
Lane described the happiness of
all those who contributed to
seeing "an old baby brought back
to life here."
Lane said he became interested
in the Barn during the years he
spent living in Palo Alto and at
tending Stanford.

Thomas Ford, a member of the
Stanford Board of Trustees, told
how pleased the University was
with the results of the renovation
project.
After a few closing remarks by
Lane, the program ended with an
equestrian exhibit put on by the
riders from the riding school.
The reconstruction of the Barn
was planned by the architectural
firm of Esherick Homsey Dodge
and Davis, which also planned the
renovation of the History Corner
in the Quad.
