To say that this year's University-fraternity rela
tionship is off on the wrong foot is only to be honest.
While the source of this tension is open to debate,
part of the problem can be traced to University
policies that are confusing enough to encourage fra
ternity members to circumvent them.
The University's "no party flyer" policy is a case
in point. That policy, which forbids fraternities from
advertising alcohol-related parties in freshman
residences, is to extend at least through autumn
quarter. Its prospects for success were demon
strated during freshman orientation. Representa
tives of several campus fraternities, in a pointed, if
not irresistable effort to "obey the rules," used
hammers and nails to pound party flyers onto trees
in front of Branner and other freshman dorms.
Other than damaged trees, the "no party flyer"
policy has more serious implications. Do University
officials want frosh to stay away from fraternities or
don't they?
Based on the available information, we can't be
sure. The University, unwittingly or not, encour
aged fraternity members to be on campus during
Orientation by offering them "Early Arrival," the
chance to move into their houses before classes
began. Fraternity members then had a free hand to
serve alcohol to freshmen during Orientation and to
advertise parties everywhere on campus but

freshman residences — automatically disregarding
those frosh who happen to be adventuresome
enough to leave their dorms. If alcohol was really
the only worry, perhaps a campus-wide frosh "dry
law" was in order.
In the days that followed Orientation, a more fun
damental question surfaced: Why can every student
organization on campus — except fraternities — ad
vertise alcohol-related parties in freshman
residences? Surely, the alcohol that flows freely at
non-fraternity parties is just as alcoholic.
Riddles like these threaten to obscure some basic
truths. Stanford fraternities, and the parties
sometimes associated with them, are at least tacitly
supported by the same University that originally
decided to devise a system in which Greek life and
residential education would be complementary?
Unfortunately, the recent confusion makes bad
feelings unavoidable, and a thaw in University
fraternity relations impossible. Tough words don't
help much, either. Witness this recent forecast by
Norm Robinson, associate dean of Student Affairs
for Residential Education: "It looks like it will either
be a very long year or a very short year for fraterni
ties." This is hardly a vote of confidence; some
would say it's a call to arms. All of this must stop,
and we hope it don't tell the freshmen
about it.
