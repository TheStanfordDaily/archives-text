Stanford Trying
To Break Union
We appreciate the efforts of
Daily reporters to give comprehen
sive and unbiased coverage of the
negotiations between the United
Stanford Workers (USW) and the
University administration.
We feel, however, that Friday's
editorial entitled "Bargain in Good
Faith" omitted a key fact that
sheds light on the current bargain
ing.
Nowhere in your editorial do you
mention that the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) charged
the administration with refusing to
bargain in good faith by illegally
withdrawing recognition from the
union last year. The NLRB com
plaint stated the following: "Since
on or about April 19, 1984,
(Stanford) has failed and refused to
recognize Local 680 as the exclu
sive collective bargaining
representitive of employees in the
unit.
"By the acts and conduct des-

cribed above, (Stanford) has failed
and refused, and is failing and
refusing, to bargain collectively and
in good faith with the representa
tive of its employees, and
(Stanford) thereby has been engag
ing in unfair labor practices."
This violation of federal labor
law on the part of the Kennedy
administration was an attempt to
break the union. The administra
tion's current contract proposal —
which would enable them to lay off
union workers and replace them
with non-union workers — must
be seen in this context. You don't
have to be a labor relations genius
to see that it is another attempt to
break the union.
In 11 years, USW workers have
voted not once, but three times to
have USW represent them. Each
election has seen an increasing
majority of "yes" votes. The ad
ministration's continued attempt to
undermine the democratically
elected union of its own employees
is unconscionable.

Glass in Food,
Saga To Blame
A sharp piece of glass one
eighth of an inch square was dis
covered by my friend, a Stanford
student, in a piece of pizza he had
in his mouth while eating at The
Corner Pocket last Monday. The
horror on his face is unforgettable
to me and others who witnessed
the incident. Fortunately he pulled
the glass from his mouth in time —
before he was injured or had
swallowed it.
The response of the non
student Saga management — in
contrast to that of the student
manager, who was not responsible
— was one of rudeness and a total
lack of remorse. They ordered the
student manager on the shift to
"go give" the victim "another piece
of pizza."
Since Saga's takeover there
have been other, less lethal
changes at The Corner Pocket: a
paper cup for ice now costs 10

cents; the pizza — with or without
glass — has gone down in quality
drastically; there is no more music
played on a portable radio behind
the counter; and non-students in
uniforms attempt to remove plates
and cups before their contents
have been finished.
Saga appears to be moving
faster and imbedding their public
relations and recipe policies more
quickly at The Corner Pocket than
they are at The Coffee House. I
don't know about their other loca
tions at Tresidder Union.
The piece of glass my friend
found could only have been in an
ingredient that Saga is using in its
pizza at The Corner Pocket. Cer
tainly the student manager and
personnel could not have had any
thing to do with it.
I feel that Saga is responsible
not only for increasingly ripping off
students as far as money and food
value go at Tresidder, but also for
endangering my friend's life.
