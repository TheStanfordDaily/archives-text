# Executions Ineffective, Unjust
## 
### 
This autumn my home state of Nevada is get
ting tough. Just last month, a Las Vegas jury
voted to take a man's life by means of lethal in
jection.
The man's name is Henry Dawson. He stands
convicteu of beating and then murdering a young
female gas station attendent, and, by almost
anyone's standards, his life thus far has proved
both a threat and a disgrace to society. But did
the people of Nevada have the right to kill Henry
Dawson? Do any of us, after all, have the author
ity to get that tough?

Surprisingly, most people in the United States
would answer "yes." According to a recent Gal
lup poll, the percentage of Americans favoring
the death penalty has rocketed from 42 percent
in 1966 to 70 percent in 1985. Here in California,
a recent Los Angeles Times poll revealed that 75
percent of those polled want to re-open this
state's dormant gas chambers. California's sup
port for capital punishment defies even political
or ethnic categorization. Today, proponents in
clude large numbers of conservatives, liberals,
men, women, blacks and whites.
Sixteen people have already been put to death
this year. And with the horrifying emergence of
California's "Night Stalker," and the approaching
trial of John Walker, the alleged Russian infor
mant, many of us will again be clamoring in sup
port of death chambers, firing squads and gal
lows. We want to get tough.
But at the same time, we're adopting a form of
justice that may be both brutal and unnecessary.
That is why we should take a careful, new look at
the old issue of capital punishment — to see if
our recent "get tough" attitude really is worth a
shot.
Defenders of capital punishment in the United

States usually cite three advantages when ar
guing the effectiveness of the death sentence.
Capital punishment, they say, provides superior
protection to society, is cost-effective and offers
equitable compensation to the victim. I think it is
fair to say that if government execution cannot
provide at least one of these advantages, we
don't need it. So let's look at each advantage,
one at a time.
The first priority of our justice system should
be the security of law abiding citizens. Let po
tential murderers know that we'll strap them in
the electric chair if we catch them, and — so the
argument goes — we will see fewer violent
crimes.
The idea does seem reasonable, but in
researching more than three years of studies, I
have yet to find any set of statistics that verifies
this hypothesis. In fact, I find no significant link
between capital punishment and murder rates at
all. Some states that enforce the death penalty
have low homicide rates. Other states with no
such penalty have low homicide rates, too. The
southern states have a very high rate of execu
tion and a high rate of violent killings.
Time magazine recognizes these findings and
offers two explanations: a) Most people who
commit murder don't think they will be caught, or
b) anyone who is willing to risk 40 to 50 years in
prison is also willing to risk his own life. Either
way, the threat of the chair, the gallows or the
needle will not effect any murder until it has
already been committed.
Even so, we could argue that the execution of
a convicted murderer protects society by
guaranteeing that the individual will never kill
again. Charles Manson was up for parole after
only a few years.
However, we can protect society just as well
by sparing the prisoner and doing away with the
parole board. Currently, only 17 states allow a
jury to sentence a killer to life without parole. If
more states would adopt this sentence, we could
keep dangerous people where they belong. We
wouldn't have to let them go free, but we
wouldn't have to kill them either.
Even though life imprisonment and executions
piovide equal protection, some fiscal con
servatives argue that executions are superior

because they are less expensive. Let's face it,
last year it was cheaper to send a student to
Stanford University than it was to keep a con in
San Quentin. (Annual tuition at San Quentin now
exceeds $20,000.)
Yet choosing a harsher, less expensive form
of punishment does not reflect justice — just
cost/benefit analysis. Furthermore, capital
punishment cases, because they often involve
extensive appellate proceedings, usually end up
costing just as much as incarceration. The 16 ex
ecutions we've seen this year represent over
$16 million worth of government-paid court ex
penses.
If executing our criminals cannot prevent
future crime or save a significant amount of
money, there can be only one motive behind a
plea for the death penalty by an informed public
— revenge.
When we learn of the violent acts of a mur
derer like Henry Dawson, we naturally become
enraged. We wish to impose a punishment just as
horrible as the crime. And we forget that such a
punishment conflicts with our normal principles
of justice. U.S. courts do not usually endorse
vengeance as just retribution. Our government,
for instance, does not allow us to rape rapists or
run over reckless drivers. To do that is to put
our society on the same level of brutality as the
criminal.
A federal lawyer named Joel Berger summed
up this view very clearly when he wrote:
"Capital punishment attempts to vindicate one
murder by committing a second murder. And the
second murder is even more reprehensible be
cause it is officially sanctioned and done with
great ceremony in the name of us all."
This autumn all of America is getting tough.
And we — as jurors, activists or citizens — are
going to have to decide if this new toughness
also means vengeance and murder. A man who
is not a judge, a lawyer or even a criminal had
valuable words to say on the subject — a man
named Albert Camus: "We know enough to say
that some crimes require severe punishment.
We do not know enough to say when anyone
should die."
