## Stanford Unfair In Negotiations 
### 
Last year the administration at
Stanford exercised a dubious legal
maneuver to force employees at
Stanford to recertify their union.
The University vigorously cam
paigned against the union chosen by
the employees. In the election,
roughly 80 percent of the
employees voted for recertification.
Last year's events puzzled a lot
of people. Why did the University

VIEWPOINT

behave as it did? Under the best of
circumstances, union-busting is
nasty business, but at a place like
Stanford it is despicable.
Now, a year later the United
Stanford Workers (USW), the
employees' union, is operating
without a contract. It appears that
job security and wage issues are
creating a conflict. Imagine that!
Less than a year after the Univer
sity attempted to destroy the
union, the USW is skittish about job
security.
Couldn't the University have an
ticipated this and done something to
soothe the fears? Instead, the ad
ministration came in with a proposal
that would allow temporary, non
union workers to fill union jobs.
We haven't gotten much informa
tion about wage issues, but a couple
of questions do come to mind. What

wage increases have other Stanford
employees been granted this year?
For one answer, graduate students
have been given a reasonably
generous increase. Are the union's
proposals out of line with respect to
other campus employees?
A University spokesperson had
the gall to complain that the union
was "conducting negotiations
through the media." If you were the
union in a bargaining situation with a
less-than-cooperative employer and
you thought what you were asking
for was fair, wouldn't you make
your position as well-known as pos
sible? If your position is unreasona
ble, going to the media only makes
you look greedy. Is the institution
that is so firmly committed to the
free exchange of ideas afraid of
public scrutiny?
A strike would be traumatic and
embarrassing for the University,
but it would be far more traumatic
for the employees. It's time for the
University to stop the runaround
and reach a settlement. If the
employees' union is being unrea
sonable, it behooves the adminis
tration to make its cause known
publicly. The University's past be
havior leaves this observer with
lots of skepticism.
