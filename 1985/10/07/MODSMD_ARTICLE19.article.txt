## Theme Houses Centers of Culture and Controversy Ujamaa House 
### SHIREEN KRELLE 
Ujamaa. The word is Swahili for
oneness, family and unity, but crit
ics of this black theme house say
the name is synonymous with
segregation, intolerance and hostil
ity.
According to Norm Robinson, as
sociate dean of student affairs,
theme houses have several
purposes, one of which is to
"provide a place where students of
the same ethnicity can live together
in significant numbers."
This year, Ujamaa is 40 percent
black in composition.
A force against interaction?
Critics have charged that this
practice of allowing students of one
ethnicity to live together results in
segregation on campus.
John Bunzel, past president of
San Jose State University, cur
rently serves as a member of the
U.S. Commission on Civil Rights
and as a senior resident fellow at
the Hoover Institution. In his article
"Living Together: Ethn*> Theme
Houses at Stanford: Part II"
(The Stanford Magazine, fall 1985),
Bunzel reported that almost three
quarters of the seniors interviewed
felt that ethnic theme houses
promoted segregation.
"Their responses leave little
doubt that students are much more
likely to regard the theme houses
as a force against interaction and
friendship among minorities and
non-minorities," Bunzel said in the
article.
"We don't see that much of
Ujamaa to be perfectly honest, they
tend to be on their own," said soph
omore Doug Steiger, a resident in
Naranja dorm.
Naranja is a non-thematic four
class dorm which, together with
Ujamaa, comprises East Lagunita
Court.
Other Naranja residents dis
agree. "I don't think it's any differ
ent than any other dorm," said
senior Marty Moreno. "Everyone
has their little cliques, so it's
impossible to generalize."
Craig Henry, a senior who has
lived in Naranja for the past two
years, said, "I've probably been
exposed to a lot more of the black
culture than somebody who lives at
the other end of campus, and I think
I'm very fortunate."

Kent Williams, a senior who has
lived both in Ujamaa and Naranja,
said he feels that the black resi
dents of Ujamaa are interacting
more with the rest of Lagunita than
they have in the past. "They used
to be more closed off," he said.
"My freshman year we had a pic
nic with Ujamaa, and the two
houses were totally separated. It
isn't as separated now as it used to
be," Williams added.
"There is certainly a potential for
segregation here," said freshman
Jordan Seng, a white resident of
Ujamaa this year. "But so far it
hasn't surfaced. Whites have been
welcome at everything," he said.
"In some ways, it's good when
blacks, or any ethnic group can get
together," said Andy Smith, an
other white resident of Ujamaa and
a freshman.
"I mean, there's such a thing as
healthy segregation. We all sepa
rate into little groups. Why
shouldn't blacks be able to share
something they have in common?"
he added.
Many critics of Ujamaa feel that
all students would benefit if mem
bers of minority groups were
housed throughout the campus to
promote diversity rather than
separatism. Most residents of
Ujamaa, however, disagree.
Junior Lewie Ford, a resident as
sistant at Ujamaa, acknowledged
that the ideal would be to mix all the
ethnic groups and have everyone
interact, but contended the reality
is that this simply would not hap
pen.
"Statistically speaking, if we
spread all the black students out,
there would only be a few in each
house. . . . There wouldn't be any
education through interaction be
cause no one would have to inter
act. A non-black might go the whole
year without even seeing a black,"
he said.
Ujamaa as education
" We want to provide exposure to
black culture and black heritage
through programming that will at
tract all students," said Michael
Britt, who with his wife Rosalyn
serves as an Ujamaa resident fel

"Ujamaa: The Message Is Unity" looks down at a house meeting at the black theme house here. Ujamaa is perhaps the subject
of the most heated debate, as its focus on black culture raises in the minds of some the spectre of racial segregation.

experience, and we want to provide a link between students and the black
community outside the Stanford boundaries," he added.
Several residents noted the intellectual and cultural experiences they
had already had through the house. (
"For anybody living here, the sense of awareness you gain and the ex
perience you get living with people from different backgrounds is in
credible ... I see the house as a center for learning," said freshman Dawn
Wilson.
Living at Ujamaa is often intellectually challenging, according to Ford.
"If you're white, or even if you're black, but you've lived mainly with
whites all your life, some of your ideas may be challenged. Most people
come here with some preconceived idea of what Ujamaa should be, and it
ends up being a lot different. That's the only way you can come up with
concrete ideas is if you've had them challenged," Ford said.
Maceo Pembroke, one of the theme associates at Ujamaa, is in charge of
planning many theme-related activities. "We have many speakers, films,
discussion groups and clubs planned, dealing with black issues," he said.
The staff at Ujamaa stressed the fact that all members of the Stanford
community should try to get involved in some of the activities that Ujamaa
sponsors.
"My personal opinion is that I love the black culture, and I think every
one should be able to get a taste of it. I look at it the same way as if some
one were going to study in France or Germany . . . People can learn about
a different culture at Ujamaa, but for some reason, because we're a theme
house it's looked at differently," said Rosalyn Britt.
Refuge of strength
It is the so-called segregation of Ujamaa that adds to the controversy
surrounding theme houses, and yet it seems that this concentration of eth
nic culture adds not only to the educational side of the house, but to its
strength as well.
"Living in Ujamaa seems like a great advantage," said Seng. "From
what I've seen so far it helps blacks deal with negative attitudes they may
find in other places," he said.
A sense of family is essential to the Ujamaa experience, according to the
resident fellows. "Everyone has got to feel good about being here," said
Michael Britt.
"I think there's a real need for Ujamaa," said freshman Andy Smith, an
Ujamaa resident who is white.
"Despite the advances we've made, I think black students can get sup
port here that they might not be able to get somewhere else," he said.
According to Michael and Rosalyn Britt, black students need a place on
campus where they can get together easily.
"There is a very valid fear of diluting the concentration of black students
so much that they just blend in; and that has not been our past, to just
blend in," said Michael Britt.
Many residents spoke of the closeness of the house and said that this
was primarily what attracted them to Ujamaa.
"I specifically requested Ujamaa," said Marcela Carrill, a Chicano resi
dent. "The people seem so much warmer and friendlier here because the
kind of people who would choose a theme house just tend to be more anx
ious to meet and learn about other people."
Sharing the closeness
While Ujamaa serves as a center for many black oriented activities, Mi
chael Britt stressed that the staff tries to strike a balance between theme
and non-theme activities.
"Our main focus this year, is that we're a house, and that we're part of
Lagunita," Pembroke said.
