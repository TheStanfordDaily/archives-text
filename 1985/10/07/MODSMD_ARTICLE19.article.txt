## Theme Houses Centers of Culture and Controversy Ujamaa House 
### SHIREEN KRELLE 
Ujamaa. The word is Swahili for
oneness, family and unity, but crit
ics of this black theme house say
the name is synonymous with
segregation, intolerance and hostil
ity.
According to Norm Robinson, as
sociate dean of student affairs,
theme houses have several
purposes, one of which is to
"provide a place where students of
the same ethnicity can live together
in significant numbers."
This year, Ujamaa is 40 percent
black in composition.
A force against interaction?
Critics have charged that this
practice of allowing students of one
ethnicity to live together results in
segregation on campus.
John Bunzel, past president of
San Jose State University, cur
rently serves as a member of the
U.S. Commission on Civil Rights
and as a senior resident fellow at
the Hoover Institution. In his article
"Living Together: Ethn*> Theme
Houses at Stanford: Part II"
(The Stanford Magazine, fall 1985),
Bunzel reported that almost three
quarters of the seniors interviewed
felt that ethnic theme houses
promoted segregation.
"Their responses leave little
doubt that students are much more
likely to regard the theme houses
as a force against interaction and
friendship among minorities and
non-minorities," Bunzel said in the
article.
"We don't see that much of
Ujamaa to be perfectly honest, they
tend to be on their own," said soph
omore Doug Steiger, a resident in
Naranja dorm.
Naranja is a non-thematic four
class dorm which, together with
Ujamaa, comprises East Lagunita
Court.
Other Naranja residents dis
agree. "I don't think it's any differ
ent than any other dorm," said
senior Marty Moreno. "Everyone
has their little cliques, so it's
impossible to generalize."
Craig Henry, a senior who has
lived in Naranja for the past two
years, said, "I've probably been
exposed to a lot more of the black
culture than somebody who lives at
the other end of campus, and I think
I'm very fortunate."

Kent Williams, a senior who has
lived both in Ujamaa and Naranja,
said he feels that the black resi
dents of Ujamaa are interacting
more with the rest of Lagunita than
they have in the past. "They used
to be more closed off," he said.
"My freshman year we had a pic
nic with Ujamaa, and the two
houses were totally separated. It
isn't as separated now as it used to
be," Williams added.
"There is certainly a potential for
segregation here," said freshman
Jordan Seng, a white resident of
Ujamaa this year. "But so far it
hasn't surfaced. Whites have been
welcome at everything," he said.
"In some ways, it's good when
blacks, or any ethnic group can get
together," said Andy Smith, an
other white resident of Ujamaa and
a freshman.
"I mean, there's such a thing as
healthy segregation. We all sepa
rate into little groups. Why
shouldn't blacks be able to share
something they have in common?"
he added.
Many critics of Ujamaa feel that
all students would benefit if mem
bers of minority groups were
housed throughout the campus to
promote diversity rather than
separatism. Most residents of
Ujamaa, however, disagree.
Junior Lewie Ford, a resident as
sistant at Ujamaa, acknowledged
that the ideal would be to mix all the
ethnic groups and have everyone
interact, but contended the reality
is that this simply would not hap
pen.
"Statistically speaking, if we
spread all the black students out,
there would only be a few in each
house. . . . There wouldn't be any
education through interaction be
cause no one would have to inter
act. A non-black might go the whole
year without even seeing a black,"
he said.
Ujamaa as education
" We want to provide exposure to
black culture and black heritage
through programming that will at
tract all students," said Michael
Britt, who with his wife Rosalyn
serves as an Ujamaa resident fel
low.
"We want to provide a forum for
the intellectualization of the black

"Ujamaa: The Message Is Unity" looks down at a house meeting at the black theme house here. Ujamaa is perhaps the subject
of the most heated debate, as its focus on black culture raises in the minds of some the spectre of racial segregation.

Native American priority program.
