# Improvements Help Disabled
## 
### FELICIA PAIK 
Improvements have been made for disabled
students as part of a University-wide effort to
help them gain increased access to all facets of
campus life.
The improvements, outlined in a 20-page
report adopted by the University's Joint Council,
include increases in disabled student recruit
ment. physical accomodation, support services
and funding.
In addition, the report underscores the impor-

tance of the presence of disabled students at
• Stanford. ________
"The presence of disabled stucfertfs is repre
sentative of our institutional commitment to the
principle of diversity and enhances the educa
tional environment of the entire community," ac
cording to the report.
Disabled students often need fellow students
to serve as readers, interpreters and note
takers. The Policy Group on Programs for Dis
abled People, which issued the report, hopes to
increase the ease with which disabled students
can be assigned these assistants.

Improvements have already been made to al
low better wheelchair access to some buildings,
and the University will consider the feasibility of
making the, Marguerite bus system accessible to
students in wheelchairs.
An increased concern for disabled students
began three years ago when a group of graduate
students formed a group called Stanford Dis
abled Students after being disappointed by the
lack of assistance given disabled students.
Much of the effort can be attributed to Jim
Bouquin, a 1982 Stanford graduate
who had been working on disabled
needs part time for the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Office.
In 1982, he established the Office
of Disabled Student Services.
