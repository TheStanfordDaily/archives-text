# Robinson House
## 
### MARILYN WANN Editorial staff 
Berke Breathed once drew a
Bloom County strip about South
Africa that applies perfectly to Rob
inson, Sterling Quad's new Ameri
can Indian priority house.
The first frame shows the Ameri
can Meadow Party convening its
panel discussion on apartheid. But
when Chief Dan "Broken Feather"
announces his topic, "racial
segregation and forced relocation,"
the liberal-thinking characters slink
off the strip in embarassment.
With the publication of John Bun
zel's study of theme houses, the
question of segregation is being ap
plied to areas a little closer to home
than Pretoria. The reaction of some
students here is similar to that of

Opus and his cartoon cohorts.
The American Indian community
on campus is hardly exclusive or
overwhelming, though. Only three
out of 90 Robinson residents live
there thanks to the Residential
Education-sponsored priority that
reserves a spot for any Native
American in a guaranteed year.
"Stanford is supposed to have
this very elite class of students, but
they're very susceptible to
stereotypes," said sophomore
James Lujan, a Taos Pueblo Indian,
explaining why he thinks theme
houses are needed.
"It's startling when you find
people who are afraid of theme
houses," agreed Tamsen Holm,
Robinson's theme associate and a
Navajo Indian who grew up on a
reservation.
The three American Indian stu
dents and their resident fellow, Ken
Fields, agreed that their purpose
now is not to provide special
privileges to members of this
minority, but to raise campus
awareness of their small group.
There are only about 90 Ameri
can Indian undergraduates and
graduates in total, according to
Holm.
Junior Nancy Sandoval, a Yaqui
Indian from Southern California
who lives in Robinson, said that she
is still amazed that people aren't as
aware of the legal battle over Big
Mountain and the relocation of
9,000 people as they are of the
street fighting in South Africa.
Upcoming events are an Interna
tional Day of Solidarity with other
indigenous people. The festival is
slated for Saturday at the New Var
sity in Palo Alto, and a pow wow
sponsored by the Stanford Ameri
can Indian Organization (SAIO) this
May. The powwow annually brings
groups from all over the nation to
the intramural fields to share cul
tural traditions.
The new SAIO/Robinson link will
sponsor an in-house film series and

panel discussions as well. The most
important local issue according to
Holm will be a pre-Big Game week
explanation of the history of the In
dian mascot and why it was
abandoned 13 years ago.
The first item on the agenda was
an American Indian drum group that
announced the new priority house
with a performance in the courtyard
of Sterling Quad after students
moved in.
Fliers advertised that the event
would be open to all students, but
Fields recalled that residents were
still unsure or uncomfortable about
joining in.
"It was a good thing," he said,
however, because people leaned
out of their windows during the
rather audible show and then dis
cussed it later that evening.
"A priority house is a more effec
tive way to give an opportunity for
others to expand their awareness,"
Lujan said, arguing against Bunzel's
proposal that theme houses
segregate more than they integrate
or educate.
All three residents lamented the
fact that freshmen aren't allowed to
draw into Robinson because of the
Governor's Corner-wide policy
against housing frosh.
There is little or no action under
way right now to convince Res Ed
to change this policy.
