the majority of students see the
ethnic theme houses as basically
separatist, they believe they still have a place
on campus. Only 20 percent favored abolishing
them. Fifty-seven percent thought that Stanford
should continue to support them, but that some
changes need to be made."
This is an excerpt taken from John Bunzel's
study published in the fall 1985 issue of The
Stanford Magazine, a study which has escalated
the debate over the purposes of what the
University has termed "ethnic enclaves" and the
success they have in fulfilling their goals.

Resident Fellow Antonio Bur
ciaga spoke of applying with his
wife, Cecilia, the associate dean of
graduate studies, for the RF posi
tion at Casa Zapata. "The first thing
they asked was, is it a residence or
a theme house first? I responded
that first of all it's a home, and the
theme is secondary."
In many ways the issue of theme

Many students would describe
Casa Zapata as the Chicano theme
house, with the often-forgotten
word 'house' coming last. Yet in the
thoughts of many Zapata residents,
the first image that comes to mind
is Zapata, a residence and a home.

What follows is a presentation of the views
and lifestyles of people living in the five thematic
houses which now find themselves at the center
of campus controversy.
The question at hand is whether these
residences serve to break down ethnic barriers
or to reinforce them in the minds of students.
What is to be found in these pages is not an
answer to this question but the opportunity to
acquire a deeper understanding of what resi
dents experience in theme houses. And,
perhaps in this understanding lies a basis for
more constructive debate.

houses can cloud up the fact that
Zapata is one of Stern's dorms with
Stern aesthetics and food. It is a
place of 95 students, one half of
them freshmen, with one third
sophomores and the rest juniors
and seniors.
Forty percent of Zapata resi
dents are Chicano. The Chicano
theme house is a house with a non-
Chicano majority. Yet this concen
tration of ethnicity can facilitate
many of the theme activities that
give Zapata a unique flavor.

Some question whom these activi
ties serve. According to some resi
dents, their value is multifold.
"For Hispanic students, it is a
place to really learn traditions," said
Irma Rodriguez, a sophomore
theme associate.
"There are always programs
focusing on history, and for non-
Hispanic students, it is the same, to
learn," she related.

Murals reinforce the sense of ethnic heritage at Casa Zapata for these residents, who also participate in dorm-wide activities that
create unity.
