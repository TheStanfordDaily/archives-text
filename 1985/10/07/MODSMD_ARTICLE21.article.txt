the majority of students see the
ethnic theme houses as basically
separatist, they believe they still have a place
on campus. Only 20 percent favored abolishing
them. Fifty-seven percent thought that Stanford
should continue to support them, but that some
changes need to be made."
This is an excerpt taken from John Bunzel's
study published in the fall 1985 issue of The
Stanford Magazine, a study which has escalated
the debate over the purposes of what the
University has termed "ethnic enclaves" and the
success they have in fulfilling their goals.

Resident Fellow Antonio Bur
ciaga spoke of applying with his
wife, Cecilia, the associate dean of
graduate studies, for the RF posi
tion at Casa Zapata. "The first thing
they asked was, is it a residence or
a theme house first? I responded
that first of all it's a home, and the
theme is secondary."
In many ways the issue of theme

Many students would describe
Casa Zapata as the Chicano theme
house, with the often-forgotten
word 'house' coming last. Yet in the
thoughts of many Zapata residents,
the first image that comes to mind
is Zapata, a residence and a home.

What follows is a presentation of the views
and lifestyles of people living in the five thematic
houses which now find themselves at the center
of campus controversy.
The question at hand is whether these
residences serve to break down ethnic barriers
or to reinforce them in the minds of students.
What is to be found in these pages is not an
answer to this question but the opportunity to
acquire a deeper understanding of what resi
dents experience in theme houses. And,
perhaps in this understanding lies a basis for
more constructive debate.

houses can cloud up the fact that
Zapata is one of Stern's dorms with
Stern aesthetics and food. It is a
place of 95 students, one half of
them freshmen, with one third
sophomores and the rest juniors
and seniors.
Forty percent of Zapata resi
dents are Chicano. The Chicano
theme house is a house with a non-
Chicano majority. Yet this concen
tration of ethnicity can facilitate
many of the theme activities that
give Zapata a unique flavor.

Some question whom these activi
ties serve. According to some resi
dents, their value is multifold.
"For Hispanic students, it is a
place to really learn traditions," said
Irma Rodriguez, a sophomore
theme associate.
"There are always programs
focusing on history, and for non-
Hispanic students, it is the same, to
learn," she related.

issue of The Stanford Magazine,
most graduating seniors said they
did not participate or spend much
time in theme houses.
Zapata staff, though, referred to
efforts to appeal to non-Hispanics in
the Stanford community.
According to Burciaga, invita
tions were distributed to other
Stern dorms advertising Saturday's
party at Zapata.
"We have to reach out into the
mainstream," Burciaga said.
For example, Zapata, along with
El Centro Chicano, is considering
bringing the Chicano band Los
Lobos to perform at the Cinco de
Mayo celebration this spring.
This band, over others, is
thought to have a broad appeal ap
propriate to the entire Stanford
community.
But, Rodriguez added, "There is
such a stereotype that it's hard to
reach out."
If non-Hispanics never come to
the dorm and see, then they will
miss realizing that Zapata residents
are not so isolated as imagined, ac
cording to Rodriguez.
There are "lots of varsity ath
letes and members of campus or
ganizations" who reside in Zapata,

Rodriguez said.
Burbank Resident Assistant Kate
Warin, a neighbor of Zapata, said,
"There are problems with students
of Burbank not mixing with stu
dents of Zapata, but it is the same
problem with Twain."
Both Burbank and Twain are
non-thematic dorms located in
Stern.
Zapata residents highlighted
good points of Zapata. Senior Scott
Murray said, "Theme houses can
be strengthening."
New Stanford student Janill Ric
hards, who chose Zapata for her
first Stanford residence, also men
tioned positive aspects of life at
Zapata.
"You can learn about another cul
ture. There is a sense of commu
nity, with a lot going on," she said.
Addressing charges of
separatism that critics have brought
against theme houses, Richards
said, "Theme activities don't lead to
cliques."
Exhibiting the sensitivity of the
Zapata staff toward non-integration,
Burciaga said, "If we see a distance
between Chicanos and whites, we
are going to look into it."
Zapata, as a theme house, seeks
recognition for what it is, a dorm
among the varied residences at
Stanford with both similarities and
an individual character.

Zapata staff, though, referred to
efforts to appeal to non-Hispanics in
the Stanford community.
According to Burciaga, invita

Stern dorms advertising Saturday's
party at Zapata.
"We have to reach out into the
mainstream," Burciaga said.
For example, Zapata, along with
El Centro Chicano, is considering
bringing the Chicano band Los
Lobos to perform at the Cinco de
Mayo celebration this spring.
This band, over others, is
thought to have a broad appeal ap
propriate to the entire Stanford
community.
But, Rodriguez added, "There is
such a stereotype that it's hard to
reach out."
If non-Hispanics never come to
the dorm and see, then they will
miss realizing that Zapata residents
are not so isolated as imagined, ac
cording to Rodriguez.
There are "lots of varsity ath
letes and members of campus or
ganizations" who reside in Zapata,

Rodriguez said.
Burbank Resident Assistant Kate
Warin, a neighbor of Zapata, said,
"There are problems with students
of Burbank not mixing with stu
dents of Zapata, but it is the same
problem with Twain."
Both Burbank and Twain are
non-thematic dorms located in
Stern.
Zapata residents highlighted
good points of Zapata. Senior Scott
Murray said, "Theme houses can

New Stanford student Janill Ric

Zapata.
"You can learn about another cul

Addressing charges of

said, "Theme activities don't lead to

Burciaga said, "If we see a distance
between Chicanos and whites, we
are going to look into it."

the majority of students see the
ethnic theme houses as basically
separatist, they believe they still have a place
on campus. Only 20 percent favored abolishing
them. Fifty-seven percent thought that Stanford
should continue to support them, but that some
changes need to be made."
This is an excerpt taken from John Bunzel's
study published in the fall 1985 issue of The
Stanford Magazine, a study which has escalated
the debate over the purposes of what the
University has termed "ethnic enclaves" and the
success they have in fulfilling their goals.

Resident Fellow Antonio Bur
ciaga spoke of applying with his
wife, Cecilia, the associate dean of
graduate studies, for the RF posi
tion at Casa Zapata. "The first thing
they asked was, is it a residence or
a theme house first? I responded
that first of all it's a home, and the
theme is secondary."
In many ways the issue of theme

Many students would describe
Casa Zapata as the Chicano theme
house, with the often-forgotten
word 'house' coming last. Yet in the
thoughts of many Zapata residents,
the first image that comes to mind
is Zapata, a residence and a home.

What follows is a presentation of the views
and lifestyles of people living in the five thematic
houses which now find themselves at the center
of campus controversy.
The question at hand is whether these
residences serve to break down ethnic barriers
or to reinforce them in the minds of students.
What is to be found in these pages is not an
answer to this question but the opportunity to
acquire a deeper understanding of what resi
dents experience in theme houses. And,
perhaps in this understanding lies a basis for
more constructive debate.

houses can cloud up the fact that
Zapata is one of Stern's dorms with
Stern aesthetics and food. It is a
place of 95 students, one half of
them freshmen, with one third
sophomores and the rest juniors
and seniors.
Forty percent of Zapata resi
dents are Chicano. The Chicano
theme house is a house with a non-
Chicano majority. Yet this concen
tration of ethnicity can facilitate
many of the theme activities that
give Zapata a unique flavor.

Some question whom these activi
ties serve. According to some resi
dents, their value is multifold.
