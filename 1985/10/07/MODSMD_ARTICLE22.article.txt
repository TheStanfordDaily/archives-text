"I refuse to live in Ujamaa,"
said theme associate Alex Carter.
"Being black, I have strong feelings
about this issue (segregation)," she
said.
Carter has chosen instead to
reside in the East Asian Studies
theme house (East House), a place
which "is not an ethnic theme
house," she said.
East versus East
Formally, Okada is an ethnic
theme house, whereas East House
is an academic (East Asian Studies).
theme house.
"There's a very different feel
here than [atl other ethnic theme
houses," said Carter. "It is more
academically oriented."
She said students choose to live
in the house primarily "because
they're interested in East Asian
Studies. More for that than to be
Asians living together."
Eileen Matsumi, a sophomore
East House resident who lived in
Okada last year, said of the two
houses: "The difference is Okada is
an East Asian/American focus and

East House is simply East Asian."
Although she considered both
houses to be educational, Matsumi
said, "You learn more here (East
House), because Res Ed has made
requirements."
East House residents must take
at least one of the in-house semi
nars offered during the year, as
well as devise a project for the
entire house related to East Asian
culture.

Ethnicity offered
Milton Hung, a resident assistant
at Okada last year, said the dorm,
as a cultural theme house, is educa
tional regarding ethnic issues.
"Ethnicity is what's offered, but
not stressed," he said.
"I've become more aware of eth
nic groups in general," said Okada
RA Rodney Carter, who is now in
his third year as a resident there.
"The TAs are interested in
educating not just people in the
house, but people on campus as
well," said Lloyd Mayer, a fresh
man at Okada.
Critics of ethnic theme houses
often claim programs beneficial to

residents never reach the rest of the University.
"It's hard to get involved if you're from the
outside," said Okada resident William Wong.
"The potential is there, but no one knows
about us," Carter said.
She said some graduate students have gained
interest about East House programs, and there
are several graduate students who eat dinner
there.
Carter cited the East Asian Festival or East
Fest as the one event that truly reaches the
entire campus. Last year's event included mar
tial arts, Taiko drummers, Chinese dance and
song, and a variety of Asian foods.
Segregation of Asians?
Residents of both houses had strong opinions
about the criticism that their houses segregate
Asians.

"I don't think we create as much of an Asian
community per se. AASA (Asian-American Stu
dents Association) does that," Hung said.
Kim Hsieh, a sophomore who was placed in
Okada her freshman year, said, "I had said I
didn't want to be in a theme house.
"My senior class in high school was 99.9 per
cent white ... It was strange for me to see so
many Asians around," she said.
"There was no pressure on me to have to
hang around with the Asian crowd," Hsieh said,
however.
Junior Dave Akayama, a former Okada resi
dent and current East House resident said, "I
think I've experienced the general Stanford ex
perience as much as any other Stanford stu
dent."
Akayama added, however, that he thinks the
houses do segregate Asians. "It's the one prob
lem I have with both houses," he said.
"If people wanted to," said Irene Takenouchi,
a sophomore East House resident, "they could
break out of it (segregation)."

Self-selection
Michael Chang, resident fellow at East House,
said Okada provides an opportunity for Asian-
Americans to "live in a setting where they can
find out who they are. It's a matter of self
selection. "
Regarding the issue of racial separation,
Chang said, "There are two kinds of perceptions
â€” outside and inside."
"Half the residents are from Asian back
ground, and the other half are of non-Asian back
ground, " he said. "I don't think it's an exclusive
thing at all. It doesn't mean they (Asian resi
dents) are only friends with Asians. That's an
outside perception."
On the issue of Asian assimilation into Ameri
can culture Chang said, "It's not an assimilation
into something that's neutral, it's assuming the
values and mores of the majority.
"In a certain sense, it (assimilation) is a denial
of their ethnicity. It's healthy for the psyche of
these people to live together ... to find out it's
OK to be different and yet the same ," he said.
