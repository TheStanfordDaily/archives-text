## Gloominess Trips Up 'Dance With a Stranger' 
### JAMES LUJAN 
Photographed in shadows and in
dimly-lit rooms, "Dance with a
Stranger" offers an atmospheric
look into the dark side of human
existence. The final result is, ap
propriately, as dreary as an over
cast day.
Based on the true story of Ruth
Ellis, who in 1955 was the last
woman to be executed in England
for murder, Mike Newell's moody
film chronicles the events that led
up to the murder.
Ruth Ellis, played by Miranda
Richardson, is a young, fragile,
lower-class, divorced mother who
scrapes up a living for herself and
her young son by working as a
hostess for a seedy tavern in Lon
don. She is being courted by Des
mond Cussen (portrayed by lan
Holm), a middle-aged, middle class,
soft-spoken, dull gentleman who is
too meek to sexually assert him
self.
One night at the tavern, Cussen
introduces Ruth to David Blakely,
played by Rupert Everett, who is a
self-centered young sports car
driver from an upper-class family.
The attraction between Ruth and
Blakely is immediate, magnetic and
intensely physical. It isn't long
before the two are in bed, declaring
their love for one another. But
then, of course, complications
arise.
Ruth finds out that Blakely is en
gaged. She blows up at him and
says she never wants to see him
again. Blakely, on the other hand,
admits that he is hopelessly in love
with her and that he has broken off
his engagement. What follows is an
account of their torrid, hot and cold,
on- and off-again affair.
It soon becomes clear that their
attraction is not based on respect,
affection or even love; the force
that draws these two people to

gether is pure, carnal passion. Ruth
continually tells Blakely that she
hates him and never wants to see
him again, but she always backs
down and ends up in the sack with
him.
In addition, Blakely repeatedly
beats Ruth and fails to show up on
dates, yet he consistently con
fesses that he can't live without
her. Their love-hate relationship, a
mixture of conflicts, incongruities
and false promises, eventually
pushes Ruth over the precipice and
provokes her into shooting Blakely.
As the movie explores this off
beat romance, it raises questions of
what forces govern basic human
passion. Is the inexplicable relation
ship between Ruth and Blakely in
fluenced by their needs, wants and
desires or is it externally shaped by
the prejudices and economic
aspects of the social strata they oc
cupy?
Unfortunately, the latter aspect
is really only touched on once in the
movie, in a scene where Blakely's
parents don't want him to see Ruth
because she is of an inferior class.
Other than that, as we watch these
two people scream and fight with
each other and then fall into each
others' arms, we can't help but
wonder what forces could cause us
to react similarly in our own
analogous situations.
Regrettably, the film doesn't
even attempt to answer these
questions and while there's nothing
wrong with that, an attempt to do
so could have produced a more en
tertaining movie.
Miranda Richardson, underneath
her pile of Marilyn Monroe makeup,
is appealingly energetic in her
portrait of a brittle and bitchy Ruth
Ellis. Although she sometimes
overacts and her Cockney accent
becomes too heavy to understand,
she successfully conveys the im
pression of a woman torn apart by
her conflicting feelings for Blakely.

Rupert Everett ("Another
Country") does an OK job as the
spoiled, selfish sports car driver
David Blakely, but his performance
is so monotonous and brooding that
you can't help but feel that a better
actor could have done more with
the role.
Lan Holm, on the other hand, is a
consistently good actor ("Chariots
of Fire," "Greystoke," "Alien")
who does a nicely restrained bit of
acting as Desmond Cussen, a small,
timid man who truly loves Ruth, but
is unable to express his feelings for

her.
On the technical side, "Dance
with a Stranger" is extremely well
done. Mike Newell's sometimes
stilted direction is stylishly im
proved upon by Peter Hannan's
dark, handsome cinematography.
The depressing mood in this picture
is established without any trouble,
and the well-timed editing moved
each scene along before it gets
tiresome.
Although the movie has good
performances, raises interesting
questions about human nature, is

very well-crafted, I didn't feel very
entertained. The movie held my at
tention, but I didn't have a good
time watching it. In other words,
this is not the kind of movie to
which you would want to sneak in a
six-pack to have a few laughs.
Other movies of this sort are a
little more successful when they in
ject a little humor, suspense or
excitement, but this movie seems
to stay on one level, almost to the
point of blandness. I couldn't help
feeling that I could have learned
more about the negative aspects of

human relationships by taking a
human psychology course.
On the whole, if you want to see
an interesting, well-acted, well
made movie and come out de
pressed, then this is a good movie
for you to see; however, if you're
looking to see "Dance with a
Stranger" to be entertained, I'd
suggest you save your five bucks
and invest it in a videocassette of
other, more entertaining films
about the dark side of human na
ture, such as "Raging Bull" or "Taxi
Driver."
