# PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S DECISION ON THE MICRODISC CONTRACT VIOLATIONS
## 
### 
A Report to the Stanford Community from the Judicial Affairs Officer

At President Kennedy's request, I am releasing to the Stanford community informa
tion about student misconduct cases that involved precedent-setting opinions from
the 1984-85 Stanford Judicial Council. At the end of this report, I will also take this
opportunity to remind people of changes made last year to the Honor Code
"Interpretations and Applications."
Microdisc Contract Violations:
The Background. The Microcomputer Discount Plan (called Microdisc) rests on two sets of
agreements: 1) Selected vendors agree to sell microcomputer equipment to the University
at discounts substantially below those offered by local dealers; and 2) the vendors, the Uni
versity, and eligible Stanford buyers agree that equipment purchased through Microdisc is
for the personal use of the purchaser and will not be resold or transferred to another person
for at least one year. Individual Stanford buyers sign a contract to that effect.
In the spring of 1984, Student A, a freshman, acquired a microcomputer system through
Microdisc. He wanted a second system as well and determined that another freshman in his
dorm, Student B, had not made a Microdisc purchase and did not intend to do so.
Student A asked Student B to purchase a system for Student A's use. Student A knew "at
some level" that his request was inappropriate. He mentioned that Student B "would have to
sign something but not to worry about it."
Subsequently, Student A filled out a Microdisc purchase order for equipment totalling
$1,133.25; Student B signed the Customer Agreement at the bottom of the order form. He
did not read the Agreement before (or after) signing it.
The equipment was available in the fall of 1984-85 when the two students returned to
campus. Student A picked up the equipment; he had with him a written authorization from
Student B as well as Student B's driver's license and banking card. Student A filled out the
warranty registration card for the system.
Student B never used the equipment. He didn't think twice about the transaction with Stu
dent A until he received a letter from the Judicial Affairs Office inquiring about an alleged
contract violation.
The Charge. Both students were charged with violations of the Fundamental Standard of
student conduct. The relevant portion of the charge statement reads: "Student B has vio
lated the terms of his contract with the University. Student A, the instigator of this arrange
ment, now has two microcomputers instead of the one to which he is entitled . . . Whether
knowingly or unknowingly, their actions jeopardized the rights of others to purchase
through Microdisc; this lack of respect for others constitutes ... a violation of the Funda
mental Standard of student conduct."
The Decision. President Kennedy accepted the penalties recommended by the Stanford
Judicial Council with one exception to be noted below. The quotations are from President
Kennedy's letter to Professor Miguel Mendez, SJC Co-Chair for 1984-85.
"I agree that a one-quarter suspension and reimbursement of any wrongfully gained eco
nomic benefit are appropriate standard penalities for this type of Fundamental Standard
violation. Those penalties are severe — and in my view, justifiably so — because the mis
conduct at issue jeopardizes a community-wide institutional privilege .. .

"(1) Student A shall pay a fine equal to the difference between the price he paid Student B
for the micro-computer and its fair market price on the date of purchase .. .
"(2) Student A and Student B shall receive suspended one-quarter suspensions. In addi
tion, I think it reasonable to impose long-term disciplinary probation on both students, not
just Student A. [Note: This differs from the SJC recommendation.]The latter might have in
stigated the transaction, but Student B actively participated in it. Furthermore, given his
awareness of institutional policy regarding the Microdisc Program, I find Student B's
professed ignorance of the terms of the contract he signed to be disingenuous and , in any
event, not an extenuating circumstance. Therefore, both students shall be placed on proba
tion for the remainder of their undergraduate studies at Stanford.
"(3) Student A and Student B shall each complete a 20-hour work fine or pay a fine of $150
by the end of Spring Quarter 1986 . . . Non-compliance by the deadline will be grounds for
withholding registration privileges until their respective fines are satisfied.
"For the record, I remind Student A and Student B that probation merely postpones their
one-quarter suspensions. If they again are found guilty of violating the Fundamental Stan
dard, the postponed suspension reinstates automatically and, in addition, an independent
penalty for the later violation would be imposed.
"Lastly, by copy of this letter to the Judicial Affairs Officer, I urge her to publicize the facts of
this case, to alert all students to the standard penalties that will be imposed for similar
breaches of institutional policy."
In addition to the precedent-setting decision described above, there were several changes
made by the Student Conduct Legislative Council to the Honor Code "Interpretations and
Applications." During 1984-85, these changes were announced numerous times in both
The Daily and Campus Report and at the beginning of Fall Quarter 1985-86, all new stu
dents received copies of the amended regulations. A summary of the changes follows;
copies of the revised booklet "Regulations Governing Student Conduct and Procedures for
Their Enforcement" are available from the Judicial Affairs Office, 322 Old Union.
Changes to the Honor Code "Interpretations and Applications"
(1) Proctoring. The old definition referred to an instructor's purpose for being present
in an examination room. The new definition deletes references to purpose: with
enumerated exceptions, proctoring is equivalent to an instructor or TA being present
during written examinations. The person's reason for being present is no longer con
sidered to be relevant.
(2) The old text referred to faculty "procedures that create temptations to violate the
Honor Code." In the new wording, the list of examples has been expanded to include
[failure to give clear directions and instructions concerning] "the limits of acceptable
collaboration in courserwork . .
(3) Under the old statement, instructors were allowed to issue academic penalties
(e.g., lower grades, additional or redone assignments) on the grounds of suspected
dishonesty if the students involved understood and accepted the penalties.
As of May, 1985, "penalty grading" is no longer permitted even with a student's know
ledge and consent. If an instructor suspects dishonesty, the only recourse is to report
the behavior to the Judicial Affairs Office for adjudication under the campus judicial
procedures.
