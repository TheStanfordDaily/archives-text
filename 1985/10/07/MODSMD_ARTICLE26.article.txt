## Jay McInerney's 'Ransom': Pay the Price 
### ED PRICE Ransom" By Jay McInerney Vintage Contemporaries, $5. 95 
Jay Mclnerney's new novel,
"Ransom," is a worthy successor to
his engrossing and entertaining first
novel, "Bright Lights, Big City."
"Ransom" is the story of Christo
pher Ransom, an American ex
patriate living in Japan in the late
19705. The character and situation
of Ransom (he disdains his first
name) are similar to those of the
hero of "Bright Lights, Big City"
(both might be classified as mem
bers of a "lost generation," if that's
not too trite), and "Ransom" is just
as thought-provoking.
In this novel, though, Mclnerney
abandons some of the style that
made "Bright Lights, Big City" dif
ferent and clever.
"Ransom" is not told in the
second person (the hero of "Bright
Lights, Big City" was "You") and,
unfortunately, in this book Mclner
ney seems reluctant to show his
keen ability to turn a phrase. (This
talent was apparent in his first ef
fort in such lines as "Here you are
again. All messed up with no place

to go.") Mclnerney's basic style is
otherwise the same on both books.
His writing is brief, but not terse,
as he uses simple but powerful sen
tences. Mclnerney also writes with
the touch of sarcasm and cynicism
that characterize Ransom and
"You."
The main similarity in the books
is the hero's condition. Ransom is in
Japan to run away more than any
thing else, a situation much like the
nightly pursuit of drugs and alcohol
in Manhattan by "You." Both
protagonists have similar jobs that
are not particularly challenging or
motivating; "You" works checking
facts for a magazine, and Ransom
teaches English to Japanese
businessmen.
Unlike "You," though, Ransom
has finally found some degree of
contentment in his life, through the
pursuit of karate. His sensei (karate
instructor) demands hard work and
concentration, and Ransom shows a
devotion to karate that is not appar
ent anywhere else in his life.
By sparring with the two stu
dents ahead of him — Yamada, the
powerful attacker, and Ito, the
monklike black belt — Ransom has
chances to prove his worthiness
and ability to his sensei and espe
cially to himself. As taxing as the

workouts are on his physical condi
tion, Ransom does look forward to
them. Karate has also given Ran
som the willpower to cut down on
his drinking and smoking.
Ransom's social life is centered
at Buffalo Rome, the bar owned by
his friend and fellow American Miles
Ryder. (Ryder also owns a popular
western wear store called
Hormone Derange.) Buffalo Rome
is the gathering place for many of
the Americans passing through
Kyoto just after the fall of Vietnam;
a place where they can see other
countrymen and listen to the
Japanese blues band Mojo Domo.
It is at Buffalo Rome that Ran
som meets DeVito, a bullying and
troublemaking ex-Marine who
keeps trying to get Ransom to fight
him. DeVito is a student of a
"harder" karate, a more brutal and
aggressive form.
Ransom and Devito demonstrate
the two sides of the martial arts.
Karate appeals to Ransom because
it adds structure and aim to a previ
ously unstructured and aimless life.
It is more the philosophy than the
combat that interests Ransom,
whether he realizes it or not.
DeVito is the opposite — he likes
karate because through it he can,
for once in his life, have power over

people. He is especially interested
in the ancient samurai traditions and
swordsmanship.
Ransom also has conflicts from
his past that are not settled. He
blames his father for his mother's
death shortly after their divorce.
Ransom resents his father's change
from a worthy playwright to a
producer of trashy television. He
also ignores his father's repeated
attempts to convince him to return
to the United States.
Other problems confronting Ran
som are his flashbacks to Pakistan
two years earlier. The memory of
-two good friends he left behind
haunts him. The story of Pakistan is
revealed to the reader in a few
short chapters interspersed
throughout the book. This tends to
be frustrating and haphazard, but is
symbolic of the way Ransom's mind
works.
Eventually, Ransom must face
the conflicts in his life, with DeVito,
with his father and with his
memories. When Ransom realizes
that he cannot put off these show
downs any longer, he brings himself
to deal directly with the problems in
his life for the first time. This leads
to the book's understated but stun
ning conclusion.
