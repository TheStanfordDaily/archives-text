## Polo Finds Tourney Is a Double Trouble 
### INGRID SEYER Staff writer 
Losing is never fun, especially if the team losing is
the No. 1 Stanford men's water polo team. However, if
a team has to lose, losing by one goal in double
overtime is one of the nicer ways to do it, and that is
exactly what the Cardinal did this weekend — twice.
The Cardinal lost to both UC-Santa Barbara and UC-
Berkeley 9-8 in double overtime in this weekend's Nor
Cal Tournament. The Cardinal finished the tournament
with a 2-2 record in third place behind champion Cal (4-
0) and Santa Barbara (3-1).
Stanford started off the tournament on a good foot,
defeating UC-Davis 21-4 and Loyola-Chicago 10-7 in
Friday's action.
Entering Saturday's action, Stanford was not quite
as successful. The Card started off poorly in the match
against Santa Barbara, trailing 1-0 after the first quar
ter. The Cardinal pulled ahead to lead 4-2 at the half
but were unable to really turn things around.
"We started off the game with some very poor play,
we were missing shots and letting Santa Barbara score
when they really shouldn't have," Coach Dante Detta
manti said. "Unfortunately, our play in the first quarter
was very indicative of our play throughout the match
. . . sloppy."
With the score tied at 7 at the end of regular play,
the match entered double overtime. Santa Barbara

scored early in the first OT, but junior David Imbernino
scored for the Cardinal to even the score at 8.
Entering the second overtime, Santa Barbara was
once again able to score right away, but this time the
Cardinal did not come back, and the match ended at 9-
8.
"We made a lot of mental errors throughout the
match," Dettamanti said. "We were making the kind of
mistakes we 'used to' make when all of these guys
were starting off in collegiate play. Santa Barbara didn't
really have to earn the victory, we virtually gave it to
them."
In the match against Berkeley, although the score
was the same as that of the Santa Barbara match, the
play involved was entirely different.
"We played a really good game against Cal, which
kind of made up for all of our mistakes against UCSB,"
Dettamanti said. "The score went back and forth
throughout the match, but Cal eventually came out on
top."
The Cardinal opened up an early lead in the first
quarter, partially due to the fact that Cal's goalie was
facing into the sun. In the second quarter, Cal came
back to within one goal 4-3, with the sun now at their
backs. After the half, the sun went down and the play
evened out, with the lead changing hands after almost
every play.
As in the Santa Barbara match, the score was even

tense — Santos threw for 320 — and the Aztec quarterback
was never sacked. Stanford noseguard Eric Volta was just one
of many Card defenders who got close to Santos.

The Card did everything it could to contain Todd Santos and the
San Diego State offense Saturday night in San Diego.
However, Santos and company racked up 513 yards of total of-
at 7 when the clock ran out, and the
teams entered double overtime.
Cal's Matt Biondi scored an outside
shot in the first OT to put the Bears
up 8-7.
In the second OT, sophomore
Erich Fisher scored on a backhand
shot from the hole to even the
score at 8, but with 0:48 remaining
Cal's Bill Shoening put in the win
ning shot to give the victory to Cal.
Ironically, it was Shoening who put
in the winning shot for Cal in last
year's NCAA Championships,
defeating the Cardinal 9-8 in the
final.
"We only committed one or two
defensive errors against Cal, but
those few errors proved to be cru
cial ones," Dettamanti said. "Even
though we played well, what we
really needed were some heroics
from one or two of the players. Im
bernino was too tightly covered to
be a strong scoring force, and Craig
Klass wasn't playing up to par due
to a virus."

In the second of their double overtime losses on Saturday, Stanford dropped a tough 9-8 decision
to Cal. In the first loss, UCSB beat Stanford by an identical 9-8 score in double overtime.
