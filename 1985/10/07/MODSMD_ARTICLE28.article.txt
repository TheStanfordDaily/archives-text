# Men and women win big
## Stanford Runners Roll at Home 
### BILL JACKSON 
Saturday found the men's and
women's cross country teams
firmly establishing themselves as
premiere West Coast distance
squads, as both won team crowns
at their own prestigious Stanford
Invitational.
The Cardinal played host to over
25 teams in both men's and
women's divisions. The Invitational
commenced at 10 a.m. Saturday,
when the women answered the call
of the gun for their 5,000-meter
race.
Though the hot, sunny conditions
were far from ideal, the intense
competition added an extra in
centive for fast times. At the gun,
Stanford All-American and senior
co-captain Regina Jacobs moved
smoothly into the lead. As she was
one of the top women in the race, it
appeared most runners were
keying off her and waiting for her to
set the pace.
A quick first mile succeeded in
thinning out the pack as the lithe
Kirsten O'Hara from UC-Berkeley
began moving up. At the two mile

point, it looked like a three-woman
race between O'Hara, Jacobs and
the hard-running Alison Wiley, an
other senior co-captain for the
Cardinal.
As the line of harriers thundered
down the final 800 meters of the
golf- turned cross-country course,
O'Hara had the first position locked
up. Her time of 16:41.1 — though
far from the Stanford Invitational
mark of 16:15.6 established by
Jacobs in 1984 — was quick enough
to outdistance the charging Wiley,
who finished in 17:03.6.
Jacobs, certainly exhausted from
her early pace setting, neverthe
less held on to the third spot in a
time of 17:16.3. Rounding out the
top five was Jennifer Abraham from
Irvine in 17:21.5 and Annette Hand
from Montana in 17:23.5.
The next Stanford runner was
senior Michelle Mason, who
finished ninth with a time of
17:50.9. Teammates Kathy Smith
(17:56.7), a sophomore, and fresh
man Kim Stevens (18:19.4), took
11th and 22nd respectively.
Stanford thus placed 2-3-9-11-
22, for a total of 47 points, good
enough for team honors, as second

place UCLA followed with 82. Cali
fornia was third with 111.
At 10:45, the men began their
assault on a 10,000 meter layout.
From the gun, it was Stanford all
the way. With a pack of five Card
runners in the top 10 through the
first 1.5 miles, it was quite reminis
cent of a Stanford training run.
Near the two mile mark, the men
hit a long hill. When they were next
seen on the return downslope,
seniors Jeff Atkinson and Ryan Stoll
and junior Marc Olesen had pulled
away from the remaining pack.
Pushing each other, the three
began touring the course at an
amazing clip.
However, with a few hundred
meters remaining, two Irvine
thinclads had pulled ahead of Atkin
son and began closing on Stoll and
Olesen. But, the lead was insur
mountable and the two Stanford
runners had the race won. Stoll and
Olesen, electing to tie, finished in
31:40.1 and made the win seem ef
fortless.
Third and fourth went to the
Irvine runners Ralph Garibaldi and
Rusty Knowles in 31:47.8 and
31:48.4, respectively. Stanford
took the next two spots with the
hard running of Atkinson (fifth in
31:51.0) and freshman James Al
borough (sixth in 31:54.6).
Rounding out the Stanford

scoring was Brian Pettingill in Uth
place with a time of 32:19.0. Stan
ford's total was a mere 27. This
was good enough for team honors
as the Cardinal outdistanced UC-
Irvine (48), Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo (92) and San Diego State
(115) in the multi-squad field.
"It was beauty," said Atkinson,
the Card captain.
