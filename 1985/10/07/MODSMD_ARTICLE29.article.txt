# 'Our worst game'-Elway
## Card Collapses In San Diego 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
SAN DIEGO — For Stanford
Coach Jack Elway, one look at his
team's humiliating 41-22 loss to San
Diego State Saturday night was
more than enough.
"It's our worst football game so
far," he said after quarterback John
Paye had thrown incomplete into
the end zone to bring the game to a
merciful conclusion at 11:15 p.m.,
three hours and 20 minutes after it
had begun. "We made a lot of
mistakes. I have to go back and
evaluate the film."
He paused. "Or I may not evalu
ate it at all," he said. 'Maybe I'll just
prepare for UCLA."
The game in Jack Murphy
Stadium was that bad. Stanford's
last two losses to Oregon and
Texas were disappointing, but they
weren't discouraging. This one was
a nightmare in Aztec black and red,
and it's going to be a hard one for
the Cardinal (1-3) to forget.
The Stanford defense looked ter
rible, even worse than it had while
giving up 83 points in the previous
two games. San Diego State (3-1)
rolled up four touchdowns and 347
total yards in the first half, and
didn't punt until late in the third

quarter, when they held a 34-16
lead.
Even more amazing, the Aztecs
faced only one third down situation
in the entire first half. They simply
moved at will, mixing draw plays
with short passes to backs and long
strikes over the middle. Stanford
Defensive Coordinator Dick Man
nini shuffled player combinations
frequently, but nothing clicked for
the Cardinal defenders.
On offense, Stanford moved
slowly and not far enough. The
Cardinal amassed 503 net yards and
31 first downs in the game, but
could manage only one offensive
touchdown. On three consecutive
possessions in the first half, Stan
ford marched, stalled, and settled
for David Sweeney field goals.
"It just wasn't working," Paye
said. "For the last two years, we'vp
always been able to put the ball in
the end zone when we get close.
We just didn't do it this time."
The loss overshadowed a record
setting performance by Paye, who
connected on 40 of his 56 passes to
eclipse John Elway's mark of 35
completions against Ohio State in
1982. But the fact that Paye was
forced to throw 56 passes should
tell you how thoroughly the Aztecs,
doormats of the Western Athletic
Conference for the last two years,
dominated the visitors from the
Pacific 10 Conference.
The domination began on San
Diego State's first drive of the
game, an eight-play, 75-yard mosey
down the field that ended with a
seven-yard TD sweep by fullback
Casey Brown. It was easier than
even the Aztecs expected it would
be.
"I could feel the first time we had
the ball that we would be able to
move it," said sophomore SDSU
quarterback Todd Santos, who was
a brilliant 18-of-24 for 320 yards and
five touchdowns on the evening.
"That first drive gave us all a lift."
The lift continued on the kickoff,
when Stanford returner Thomas
Henley inexplicably fielded the kick
at the sideline and stepped out of
bounds at the one-foot line. Paye
moved the Cardinal to midfield,
where Sweeney pooch-kicked a
punt to the SDSU five.
Three Aztec plays later, Stanford
got its only big defensive play of the
game. From his own 42-yard line,
Santos dropped back and lobbed a

duck toward the right sideline.
Cardinal cornerback Toi Cook read
the play perfectly, snared the pass
and motored into the end zone un
touched.
It was the only time San Diego
State did not score on a first half
possession. The next three times
they received the ball, the Aztecs
rang up TDs.
First came another long drive, an
80-yard march capped by a diving,
eight-yard TD catch by wide
receiver Webster Slaughter. Then,
after a long Stanford drive ended in
a 23-yard Sweeney field goal, the
Aztecs got lucky.
Santos hit Brown on a dump over
the middle, and the fullback headed
toward the right sideline, where he
got a key block and cruised to mid
field before being tackled by safety
Mark Hashimoto and linebacker
Jack Gilmete. As Brown went
down, he fumbled the ball forward,
just where Slaughter happened to
be going.
Slaughter scooped up the ball and
breezed into the end zone. After
the PAT was hooked right, San
Diego State held a 20-10 lead.
Stanford drove, died and kicked a
44-yard field goal to pull to within a
touchdown, but the Aztecs came
back on the field with more confi

dence than ever in their ability to
move the ball. Against a nickel
prevent defense, Santos calmly di
rected a drive upfield with draws
and screens and some help from
sloppy Cardinal tackling.
The drive ended with a 28-yard
TD pass from Santos to Brown,
who shrugged off hits by Hashimoto
and cornerback Chris Young to
score with just 38 seconds left in
the half.
But Stanford responded by
quickly moving the ball downfield on
a nice catch-and-run-and-facemask
play by tailback Kevin Scott, and
when Sweeney hit a 42-yard field
goal as time expired, the Cardinal
was within striking distance at 27-
16.
That was as close as it would get.
Henley fumbled the second half
kickoff on his own 21, and just over
a minute later, Santos rolled left
and pegged a TD pass to wide-open
tight end Robert Await to stretch
the lead to 18 points.
From then on, Stanford played
catch-up ball and did so without star
fullback Brad Muster, who ag
gravated a hip pointer and played
only one set of downs in the second
half. On the next series, Paye
scrambled and threw the Cardinal
to a fourth and 10 situation at the

SDSU 26, where Elway made a
somewhat controversial call.
Rather than go for the field goal,
which would have pulled Stanford to
within two touchdowns — with a
PAT and a two-point conversion —
Elway elected to go for it. The Az
tecs sent both outside linebackers
on a blitz, and Paye was buried for
an 11-yard loss.
"What was I thinking about? I
was thinking about scoring a touch
down," Elway said afterward. "I'd
do it again the same way."
After a pair of punts, San Diego
State put the final nail in Stanford's
coffin. On the first play of the se
ries, Santos found Slaughter break
ing away from Cook over the
middle and fired it to him for a 53-
yard score.
After that, it was all pretty
meaningless. The Cardinal ate up
six minutes and 29 seconds of the
clock with an 80-yard drive that cul
minated with a triple-effort, one
yard touchdown run by Scott. And
when the two-point conversion at
tempt was batted down, the scoring
was over. The Diamond Vision
scoreboard began showing more
pictures of women in the stands
than replays of the game, and all but
the most diehard fans headed for
the exits.

ford marched, stalled, and settled
for David Sweeney field goals.
"It just wasn't working," Paye
said. "For the last two years, we'vp
always been able to put the ball in
the end zone when we get close.
We just didn't do it this time."
The loss overshadowed a record
setting performance by Paye, who
connected on 40 of his 56 passes to
eclipse John Elway's mark of 35
completions against Ohio State in
1982. But the fact that Paye was
forced to throw 56 passes should
tell you how thoroughly the Aztecs,
doormats of the Western Athletic
Conference for the last two years,
dominated the visitors from the
Pacific 10 Conference.
The domination began on San
Diego State's first drive of the
game, an eight-play, 75-yard mosey
down the field that ended with a
seven-yard TD sweep by fullback
Casey Brown. It was easier than
even the Aztecs expected it would
be.
"I could feel the first time we had
the ball that we would be able to
move it," said sophomore SDSU
quarterback Todd Santos, who was
a brilliant 18-of-24 for 320 yards and
five touchdowns on the evening.
"That first drive gave us all a lift."
The lift continued on the kickoff,
when Stanford returner Thomas
Henley inexplicably fielded the kick
at the sideline and stepped out of
bounds at the one-foot line. Paye
moved the Cardinal to midfield,
where Sweeney pooch-kicked a
punt to the SDSU five.
Three Aztec plays later, Stanford
got its only big defensive play of the
game. From his own 42-yard line,
Santos dropped back and lobbed a

duck toward the right sideline.
Cardinal cornerback Toi Cook read
the play perfectly, snared the pass
and motored into the end zone un
touched.
It was the only time San Diego
State did not score on a first half
possession. The next three times
they received the ball, the Aztecs
rang up TDs.
First came another long drive, an
80-yard march capped by a diving,
eight-yard TD catch by wide
receiver Webster Slaughter. Then,
after a long Stanford drive ended in
a 23-yard Sweeney field goal, the
Aztecs got lucky.
Santos hit Brown on a dump over
the middle, and the fullback headed
toward the right sideline, where he
got a key block and cruised to mid
field before being tackled by safety
Mark Hashimoto and linebacker
Jack Gilmete. As Brown went
down, he fumbled the ball forward,
just where Slaughter happened to
be going.
Slaughter scooped up the ball and
breezed into the end zone. After
the PAT was hooked right, San
Diego State held a 20-10 lead.
Stanford drove, died and kicked a
44-yard field goal to pull to within a
touchdown, but the Aztecs came
back on the field with more confi

dence than ever in their ability to
move the ball. Against a nickel
prevent defense, Santos calmly di
rected a drive upfield with draws
and screens and some help from
sloppy Cardinal tackling.
The drive ended with a 28-yard
TD pass from Santos to Brown,
who shrugged off hits by Hashimoto
and cornerback Chris Young to
score with just 38 seconds left in
the half.
But Stanford responded by
quickly moving the ball downfield on
a nice catch-and-run-and-facemask
play by tailback Kevin Scott, and
when Sweeney hit a 42-yard field
goal as time expired, the Cardinal
was within striking distance at 27-
16.
That was as close as it would get.
Henley fumbled the second half
kickoff on his own 21, and just over
a minute later, Santos rolled left
and pegged a TD pass to wide-open
tight end Robert Await to stretch
the lead to 18 points.
From then on, Stanford played
catch-up ball and did so without star
fullback Brad Muster, who ag
gravated a hip pointer and played
only one set of downs in the second
half. On the next series, Paye
scrambled and threw the Cardinal
to a fourth and 10 situation at the

SDSU 26, where Elway made a
somewhat controversial call.
Rather than go for the field goal,
which would have pulled Stanford to
within two touchdowns — with a
PAT and a two-point conversion —
Elway elected to go for it. The Az
tecs sent both outside linebackers
on a blitz, and Paye was buried for
an 11-yard loss.
"What was I thinking about? I
was thinking about scoring a touch
down," Elway said afterward. "I'd
do it again the same way."
After a pair of punts, San Diego
State put the final nail in Stanford's
coffin. On the first play of the se
ries, Santos found Slaughter break
ing away from Cook over the
middle and fired it to him for a 53-
yard score.
After that, it was all pretty
meaningless. The Cardinal ate up
six minutes and 29 seconds of the
clock with an 80-yard drive that cul
minated with a triple-effort, one
yard touchdown run by Scott. And
when the two-point conversion at
tempt was batted down, the scoring
was over. The Diamond Vision
scoreboard began showing more
pictures of women in the stands
than replays of the game, and all but
the most diehard fans headed for
the exits.
SAN DIEGO — For Stanford
Coach Jack Elway, one look at his
team's humiliating 41-22 loss to San
Diego State Saturday night was
more than enough.
"It's our worst football game so
far," he said after quarterback John
Paye had thrown incomplete into
the end zone to bring the game to a
merciful conclusion at 11:15 p.m.,
three hours and 20 minutes after it
had begun. "We made a lot of
mistakes. I have to go back and
evaluate the film."
He paused. "Or I may not evalu
ate it at all," he said. 'Maybe I'll just
prepare for UCLA."
The game in Jack Murphy
Stadium was that bad. Stanford's
last two losses to Oregon and
Texas were disappointing, but they
weren't discouraging. This one was
a nightmare in Aztec black and red,
and it's going to be a hard one for
the Cardinal (1-3) to forget.
The Stanford defense looked ter
rible, even worse than it had while
giving up 83 points in the previous
two games. San Diego State (3-1)
rolled up four touchdowns and 347
total yards in the first half, and
didn't punt until late in the third

quarter, when they held a 34-16
lead.
Even more amazing, the Aztecs
faced only one third down situation
in the entire first half. They simply
moved at will, mixing draw plays
with short passes to backs and long
strikes over the middle. Stanford
Defensive Coordinator Dick Man
nini shuffled player combinations
frequently, but nothing clicked for
the Cardinal defenders.
On offense, Stanford moved
slowly and not far enough. The
Cardinal amassed 503 net yards and
31 first downs in the game, but
could manage only one offensive
touchdown. On three consecutive
possessions in the first half, Stan
ford marched, stalled, and settled
for David Sweeney field goals.
"It just wasn't working," Paye
said. "For the last two years, we'vp
