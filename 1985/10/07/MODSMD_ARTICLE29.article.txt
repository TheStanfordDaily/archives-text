# 'Our worst game'-Elway
## Card Collapses In San Diego 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
SAN DIEGO â€” For Stanford
Coach Jack Elway, one look at his
team's humiliating 41-22 loss to San
Diego State Saturday night was
more than enough.
"It's our worst football game so
far," he said after quarterback John
Paye had thrown incomplete into
the end zone to bring the game to a
merciful conclusion at 11:15 p.m.,
three hours and 20 minutes after it
had begun. "We made a lot of
mistakes. I have to go back and
evaluate the film."
He paused. "Or I may not evalu
ate it at all," he said. 'Maybe I'll just
prepare for UCLA."
The game in Jack Murphy
Stadium was that bad. Stanford's
last two losses to Oregon and
Texas were disappointing, but they
weren't discouraging. This one was
a nightmare in Aztec black and red,
and it's going to be a hard one for
the Cardinal (1-3) to forget.
The Stanford defense looked ter
rible, even worse than it had while
giving up 83 points in the previous
two games. San Diego State (3-1)
rolled up four touchdowns and 347
total yards in the first half, and
didn't punt until late in the third

quarter, when they held a 34-16
lead.
Even more amazing, the Aztecs
faced only one third down situation
in the entire first half. They simply
moved at will, mixing draw plays
with short passes to backs and long
strikes over the middle. Stanford
Defensive Coordinator Dick Man
nini shuffled player combinations
frequently, but nothing clicked for
the Cardinal defenders.
On offense, Stanford moved
slowly and not far enough. The
Cardinal amassed 503 net yards and
31 first downs in the game, but
could manage only one offensive
touchdown. On three consecutive
possessions in the first half, Stan
ford marched, stalled, and settled
for David Sweeney field goals.
"It just wasn't working," Paye
said. "For the last two years, we'vp
always been able to put the ball in
the end zone when we get close.
We just didn't do it this time."
The loss overshadowed a record
setting performance by Paye, who
connected on 40 of his 56 passes to
eclipse John Elway's mark of 35
completions against Ohio State in
1982. But the fact that Paye was
forced to throw 56 passes should
tell you how thoroughly the Aztecs,
