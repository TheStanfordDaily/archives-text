# IFC Rules on Frat Charges
## SAE ban ends, Phi Delts' continues 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
The temporary probation of the
Phi Delta Theta fraternity will con
tinue until Oct. 10, pending the
completion of a pamphlet outlining
the "proper" method of planning
and conducting a party, according
to Interfraternity Council Presi
dent Don Galles.
A similar probation for the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon (SAE) fraternity was
lifted Friday following an
"intensive" IFC investigation of
recent incidents surrounding both
fraternities, Galles said.
The IFC verdicts were delivered
Thursday night after a meeting of
the entire council and made public
Friday in a two-page letter from
Galles to Norm Robinson, associate
dean of Student Affairs for Residen
tial Education.
The letter and the probation of
the two fraternities were in
response to a Sept. 24 memo from
Robinson. Robinson asked the IFC
to investigate and report on six pos
sible violations of University and
IFC guidelines that took place be
tween Sept. 17 and 23. After re
ceiving the memo, the IFC tempo
rarily suspended the social
privileges of SAE and Phi Delta
Theta.
Temporary suspensions of social
privileges prohibit fraternities from
holding parties or open-campus
events, according to Fraternal Af
fairs Adviser Joe Pisano.
According to Galles, the IFC
found three of the incidents Robin
son cited, involving SAE, Beta
Theta Pi and Kappa Alpha, to be
under IFC jurisdiction. The other
three incidents Robinson cited in
volved individual fraternity mem
bers that the IFC said are not under
its jurisdiction.
The Phi Delt incident occurred
after Robinson's letter was written.
The continued suspension of the

Phi Delts was necessary because of
"direct violations" of specific IFC
and University regulations prohibit
ing parties and party advertise
ments that focus on alcohol, Galles
said.
The violations stemmed from a*
Phi Delt "Kamikaze" party Sept. 24.
To satisfy the conditions for lif
ting the suspension, the Phi Delts
must prepare and submit an infor
mation packet "that discusses the
proper way to conduct a party
within IFC and Residential Educa
tion guidelines," including concept
advertising and planning, Galles'
letter said.
The Phi Delt suspension will con
tinue until Oct. 10, when the IFC
"will review the Phi Delts' progress
and lift the suspension if adequate
progress toward their goal has been
reached," Galles' letter said.
According to Phi Delt President
Bret Monello, the information
packet will contain "facts and
myths" of alcohol and alcohol abuse
as well as recommendations for
limiting the number of open-campus
parties given by fraternities.
The completed Phi Delt report
must be submitted by Oct. 24,
Galles said.
The IFC has also suspended
Beta Theta Pi's privilege of return
ing one week before autumn quar
ter classes begin in the 1986-87
academic year. Party fliers aimed at
freshman were distributed to an
nounce a Beta party during Orienta
tion. A Sept. 17 memo from Diana
Conklin, assistant dean of Student
Affairs, warned returning Row resi
dents not to interfere with Orienta
tion.
According to Galles, a "problem
of self-government" and the ab
sence of Beta officers during Orien
tation contributed to the problem.
The suspended privilege can be
restored, Galies' letter said, if the
Betas can demonstrate to Diana
Conklin and the IFC that "they can
govern themselves responsibly and
that they will not interfere with the
activities of Frosh Orientation."

The IFC letter also dismissed
Robinson's charge that Kappa Al
pha fraternity members had dis
rupted a Sept. 20 all-Florence
Moore party for freshmen.
Galles said the IFC investigation
determined that no one, including
Flo Mo resident assistants,
positively identified any KAs at the
party.
