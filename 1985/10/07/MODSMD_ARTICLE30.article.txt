# Card Upsets Bruins
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
In what was billed as a rematch
of last year's thrilling five-game
NCAA final, the top-ranked Stan
ford women's volleyball team
overwhelmed defending cham
pion UCLA — which played
without two of their best players
— by scores of 15-6, 15-10 and
15-11 Friday night at Maples
Pavilion.
Did Friday's victory help heal
some of the wounds from last
year's championship that saw the
Cardinal blow a 12-3 lead in the
final game? "Just a little," junior
Brooke Hahner said with a smile
that epitomized the post-game at
mosphere at Maples. "We were
psyched for it all week."
The UCLA women, ranked
No. 2 in the nation, knew they
would be in for a struggle before
they even took to the floor. Bruin
Coach Andy Banachowski had

derided to leave seniors Dawn
Kenny and Liz Masakayan in Los
Angeles for "disciplinary
reasons."
Masakayan, the 1984 College
Player of the Year, tormented the
Cardinal throughout last year's
final and was a one-woman
wrecking crew in that match's
final game.
Both Banachowski and Cardinal
Co-coach Don Shaw, however,
downplayed the absence of the
two Bruins. "I would like to think
that it affected us a lot, (but)
Stanford played an excellent
match," Banachowski said.
"We can't control what happens
with their team," Shaw said. "We
had certain things that we wanted
to concentrate on, things to im
prove on, and I think we're right
on track."
"It's always a letdown when
you're not playing the best,"
Stanford freshman Amy Hayes
said, "but that's what they had
and we beat them."
The Cardinal women were

sharp from the beginning, taking a
quick 6-2 lead in the opening
game behind the strong hitting
and blocking of Hahner and senior
Kim Oden. UCLA rallied,
however, to close to 6-5 before
the Stanford coaches made the
first of two key moves.
Hahner substituted back in for
Hayes and immediately paid
dividends with a powerful kill to
push the Cardinal's lead to 7-5.
After the Bruins fought to
within one point at 7-6, Hayes
was brought back in for Hahner to
serve. And serve she did.
In perhaps the finest moment
of her young career at Stanford,
the freshman from Anaheim pin
pointed one serve after another,
forcing UCLA to dive and lunge
for the ball, and the Cardinal won
eight straight points to take the
first game, 15-6.
"That first one I just choked,"
Hayes said, referring to an earlier

point in the game when she
had served into the net.
"After I got a couple in I felt
better. It's scary playing
UCLA."
After dropping the first two
points of the second game,
the Cardinal women went on
a rampage, taking an 11-4 ad
vantage. The defending
champs looked confused and
were rejected at the net time
and again by Oden and sop
homores Nancy Reno and
Wendi Rush.
"We couldn't side out,"
Banachowski said. "We
needed a little more
firepower."
The victory continued the
Cardinal's undefeated streak
over the past two seasons at
Maples, which Shaw attri
butes largely to the increase
in both the size and the en
thusiasm of the crowds.
The Cardinal women will
attempt to extend their
home-court winnning streak
tonight as the University of
the Pacific comes to Maples
for a 7:30 match.
If past records are any indi
cation, UOP should provide
considerable competition for
Stanford. Last year UOP ad

downplayed the absence of the
two Bruins. "I would like to think
that it affected us a lot, (but)
Stanford played an excellent
match," Banachowski said.
"We can't control what happens
with their team," Shaw said. "We
had certain things that we wanted
to concentrate on, things to im
prove on, and I think we're right
on track."
"It's always a letdown when
you're not playing the best,"
Stanford freshman Amy Hayes
said, "but that's what they had
and we beat them."
The Cardinal women were

sharp from the beginning, taking a
quick 6-2 lead in the opening
game behind the strong hitting
and blocking of Hahner and senior
Kim Oden. UCLA rallied,
however, to close to 6-5 before
the Stanford coaches made the
first of two key moves.
Hahner substituted back in for
Hayes and immediately paid
dividends with a powerful kill to
push the Cardinal's lead to 7-5.
After the Bruins fought to
within one point at 7-6, Hayes
was brought back in for Hahner to
serve. And serve she did.
In perhaps the finest moment
of her young career at Stanford,
the freshman from Anaheim pin
pointed one serve after another,
forcing UCLA to dive and lunge
for the ball, and the Cardinal won
eight straight points to take the
first game, 15-6.
"That first one I just choked,"
Hayes said, referring to an earlier

As her teammates look on, Barbra Fontana's attempted kill shot is rejected by two UCLA
defenders in Friday's game at Maples. Stanford, previously N0.2, upset the No. 1-ranked
Bruins 15-6, 15-11 and 15-10.

had served into the net.
"After I got a couple in I felt
better. It's scary playing
UCLA."
After dropping the first two
points of the second game,
the Cardinal women went on
a rampage, taking an 11-4 ad
vantage. The defending
champs looked confused and
were rejected at the net time
and again by Oden and sop
homores Nancy Reno and
Wendi Rush.
"We couldn't side out,"
Banachowski said. "We
needed a little more
firepower."
The victory continued the
Cardinal's undefeated streak
over the past two seasons at
Maples, which Shaw attri

in both the size and the en
thusiasm of the crowds.
The Cardinal women will
attempt to extend their
home-court winnning streak
tonight as the University of
the Pacific comes to Maples
for a 7:30 match.
If past records are any indi

considerable competition for
Stanford. Last year UOP ad

NCAA semi-finals before
bowing to the Cardinal in
three games. Currently the
Tigers are ranked No. 3 in
the nation behind Stanford
and UCLA.
