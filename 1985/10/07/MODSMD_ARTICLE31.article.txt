# Stanford Defense: 'Help Wanted...'
## 
### 
SAN DIEGO — The Daily classified ad department is probably leaving
room for an entry in the help wanted section today.
"Needed: defender to give up under 40 points a game. The privilege of
playing with a 500 yard-per-game offense. Chance to play against the Pac
10's finest. Tackling a prerequisite. Consistency a must. Call Jack, days
before 3 p.m."
The Stanford defense turned in its third straight bad performance Satur
day night in Jack Murphy Stadium. The game began at 8:15 p.m. since the
stadium had to be converted to a football set up after the San Diego Padres
game. The Card is wishing the Padres had gone into extra innings. Maybe
35 or so.
A San Diego State team from the Western Athletic Conference finished
with 41 points, 513 yards and a 41-22 victory against a Card defense
whose main problem in the past had been inconsistency — playing tough,
then allowing a big play. Not so Saturday. Playing tough wasn't included.
"We just played soft," Coach Jack Elway said. "I think they're a good of
fensive team, but I don't think they are that good. I just think overall we
didn't play good defense."

There were only two big plays in the first half when Stanford was on
defense. One was Toi Cook's 45-yard interception return for a touchdown
and the other was a fluke fumble recovery on a 80-yard pass play.
SDSU's other three possessions: an eight play, 75 yard touchdown
drive; eleven play, 80 yard touchdown drive; 8 play, 80 yard touchdown
drive. The Stanford defense gave ground easier than the Red Army
retreating before the Germans in World War 11.
Much like Stanford, SDSU is noted for passing, and quarterback Todd
Santos rolled up the obligatory 18 of 24 for 320 yards and 5 touchdowns.
But the Aztecs also ran for 193 yards, mostly on a delayed draw that
worked all night.
Stanford's offense gained over 500 yards again. It brings back memories
of the loss to Oregon two weeks ago. In San Diego, the Cardinal offense
scored only 15 points and only one touchdown.
"This was the first time in the last two years that when we got inside the
30 we didn't come away with the touchdown," quarterback John Paye said.
Paye set a school record with 40 completions en route to 390 yards in the
air, but he couldn't get the ball deep.
Despite allowing 41 points, the Card still had a shot in this one. Jeff
James was a step away from a touchdown when he fumbled out of the
endzone with five minutes left. The game ended with Stanford on the Az
tecs' three.
.Elway went into catchup gear a little early. With 9:46 left in the third
quarter, he skipped a field goal attempt to go for it from the Aztec 26 on a
fourth and ten, trailing 41-16.
. Close only counts in nuclear war, though. First the Cardinal didn't score
oh these occasions. Second, no team should need to score more than 41
points to win.
There were again some bright spots on offense. Paye turned in another
incredible game, and he hasn't thrown an interception in eight quarters
now. Unfortunately, he couldn't get a touchdown pass.
Brian Morris was dependable out of the backfield after Brad Muster
went out with a hip pointer, though Morris is not the game breaker Muster
can be.
Kevin Scott, back after an early season eye injury, showed he is ready
to play by turning in a shifty run on a screen pass and a twisting third effort
on the touchdown.
But then there was the defense. "We may not evaluate this film," Elway
said. "We may just go in Monday and prepare for UCLA. I don't know if
there are any bright spots."
The inexperience of the Stanford defense is a given, with only three re
turning starters. The talent has shown itself on occassion. But the let
downs are killing this team.
"We just haven't executed," Cook said. "We've had too many letdowns.
The times we've executed, we've played great. The best teams are con
sistent. We haven't been."
