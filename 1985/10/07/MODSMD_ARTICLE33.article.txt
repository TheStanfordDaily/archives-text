# Great Race Draws Over 2,000
## 
### SCOTT ROTH 
Over 2,000 people rolled out of bed yesterday
morning to compete in the eighth annual Great
Race at Stanford. The race, a 10 kilometer (6.2
miles), Pacific Association/Track Athletics
Congress sanctioned event, was one of four
fund-raising events to be held this year to benefit
the Cardinal Club, an organization that promotes
women's athletics at Stanford.
In a sanctioned race, a runner is able to regis
ter a time in order to improve his or her seeding
in other races.
Stanford's Great Race, which attracted every
one from top-seeded runners to senior citizens,
started in front of Maples Pavilion, wound up
Campus Drive, through Junipero Serra Blvd.,
down Campus Drive West, around the Oval and

climaxed in Stanford Stadium.
"In the past seven years, the race has really
grown tremendously," said Dorthea Gregowski,
director of Special Events for the Department of
Athletics. "The fact that it's a good course and
that it's ... for Stanford makes it attractive,"
she added.
The men's race was won by Dennis Curtis in a
time of 30 minutes and 22 seconds. Bay to
Breakers champion Nancy Ditz of Menlo Park
outclassed all the women and finished in 34:28.
Ditz and the other top women got a lot more
than a good workout. The top five individuals and
teams divided $5,000 in prize money, with Ditz
jogging away with $1,000.
In the past, both men and women have been
given prize money, but it was decided this year
to award money only to the women. This was
done because the race is intended to bolster the

women's scholarship fund.
Curtis and the other men did not go away
empty-handed, however. He and the other top
men were given large trophies, gift certificates
and copies of the book "Stanford Sports."
Once runners completed their jog, they were
treated to complimentary mineral water, soft
drinks, fresh grapes and even free tubes of Ben
Gay. Most runners decided to take advantage of
the early-morning sunshine and the nice grass at
the stadium by relaxing on the football field for a
while.
In another fund-raising event, the Cardinal
Club plans to hold a wine tasting and an auction
on Friday, Oct. 18, at the Stanford Equestrian
Center. The wine tasting will feature wines from
37 wineries — all of whose owners have Stan
ford ties. Both events will be hosted by Stanford
alum Gene Washington.
