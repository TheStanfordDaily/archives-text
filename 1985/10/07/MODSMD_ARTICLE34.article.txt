# Card Fights Hard, Falls In Finals
## 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
While the Cardinal football team
was having a woebegone weekend
in San Diego, the Stanford men's
soccer team turned in a stellar per
formance at the Metropolitan Life
Pacific Classic in Los Angeles.
On Saturday, Stanford defeated
the University of Washington in
overtime by a score of 4-2 to earn
the right to play UCLA in yester
day's championship game.
Stanford then gave the Bruins,
who beat California 3-2 to advance
to the final, a hard-fought match
before succumbing by a 2-1 tally.
UCLA, a team that went to the
Final Four last year, relied on the
services of All-America midfielder
Dale Ervine, and he came through
in a big way. Twenty-two minutes

into the final, Ervine scored on an
assist by Bruin junior forward Tom
Silvas, and the score at halftime
was 1-0.
Ervine quickly broke the Stan
ford defense again just five minutes
into the second half and UCLA had
a comfortable 2-0 lead.
It is hard to be comfortable,
however, when playing the hustling
Cardinal squad. Sure enough, Stan
ford struck back only 14 minutes
later, as freshman Kevin Wood
house took a pass from senior for
ward Rob West and punched in the
first goal of his collegiate career.
Bruin goalkeeper Dave Vanole
kept the Cardinal out of the goal for
the remainder of the game, and
UCLA captured the Classic champi
onship. The Bruins are now 7-1-2,
and Dale Ervine is setting a torrid
scoring pace with 11 goals in 10
games.
Stanford did some impressive
scoring of its own in a 4-2 victory
Saturday afternoon against the
Washington Huskies. The four
goals by the Cardinal are a season
high.

Shining for the Cardinal all
weekend was senior midfielder An
gel Vasquez. Although he is
nowhere to be found in the statis
tics, Vasquez was everywhere on
the field for Stanford and was
named Offensive Player of the
Tournament.
Stanford returns home to host
San Jose State Wednesday after
noon.
