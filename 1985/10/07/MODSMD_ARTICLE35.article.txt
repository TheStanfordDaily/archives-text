### MARK SMOYER Staff Writer 
Stanford's field hockey team traveled to Chico State Saturday to
face the Northern Pacific Conference's N0.2-ranked team, a team
eager to take away Stanford's No. 1 spot. Though the poll has not
been released yet, one suspects that the Wildcats have succeeded
after defeating the Cardinal 2-1.
After the loss, the Card's NorPac record falls to 0-1-1, while
Chico's goes to 3-0-0.
Despite the loss, the van ride home was what one has come to ex
pect from this boisterous squad. "It was a riot," said freshman for
ward Laura Gartland.
"We controlled the tempo of the game ... we just didn't score,"
Assistant Coach Jen Blakely said. "We had more shots then they
did."
