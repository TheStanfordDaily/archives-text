# Giants' Last Day Like All the Others
## 
### MIKE HALE 
You're the San Francisco Giants.
You're playing what you claim will
be your last game in the only
stadium you've ever called home.
What do you do to mark the occa
sion?
That's right. You give away 20
pounds of beef franks between in
nings.
You also have your public ad
dress announcer say, "Ladies and
gentlemen, welcome — for the last
time — to Candlestick Park." If the
16,202 diehard fans who turned out
yesterday to wish the Giants
farewell were looking for clues to
Giants owner Bob Lurie's inten
tions, that was one of the more
striking ones. Or perhaps the
future could be read in the fact that
what may have been the Giants' last
day at the 'Stick was . . . Sunnyvale
Day.
The crowd — presumably beefed
Up by some portion of the popula
tion of Sunnyvale — parked in
bright sunshine. By noon, 10
minutes before game time, the fog
had rolled in and half-covered the
stadium. Only right field, where
there aren't any baseball seats, was
in the sun.
Everything about the day — the
weather, the game, the crowd —
was utterly typical of the Giants' ut
terly depressing season. Out in
right field, the retired numbers of
Bill Terry, Mel Ott, Willie Mays,
Juan Marichal and Willie McCovey
had been taken down so that the
49ers' extra seats could be moved

in. No one had bothered to put
them back up for the Giants' last
game. Later on, a Giants spokes
man evoked the great Candlestick
tradition: Willie Mays played there,
Willie McCovey played there. You
couldn't have proved it by the right
field fence.
In the stands, the really excited
fans were the ones listening to, or
watching, the 49ers game. Down
on the field, Tom Sanchez of Gilroy
gave a fine a capella rendition of the
national anthem, and everything
went downhill from there. The At
lanta Braves scored a run in the
first, four more in the second and
by the fourth had scored six runs on
12 hits off four Giants pitchers.
In the bottom of the second, with

the 49ers safely ahead of Atlanta,
the crowd came to life. It looked
up, saw that there was no one on
base and a two-strike count on
Giants catcher Bob Brenly, and
began rhythmically clapping.
As the applause reached its
height, Brenly went spinning out of
the way of a called third strike, his
bat held high on his shoulder. At the
same instant, the clouds rolled over
right field, completely socking in
the stadium.
You'd think that, on the Giants'
last day in Candlestick, the weather
could have cooperated — that the
Giants could have been given one of
those sunny, breezy, perfect-for
baseball afternoons, the kind that
Candlestick has, more often than

not, when the Giants play day
games. But no. In the fourth inning,
the lights came on, and stayed on
for the rest of the game. At least it
wasn't raining.
In the fifth inning a scoreboard
announcement drew the day's big
gest cheer: Final score, 49ers 38,
Atlanta 17. Later that inning, it
began to rain.
In the bottom of the sixth, with
the Giants still trailing, 6-0, lightn
ing struck. The Giants parlayed
four walks, a single, a wild pitch,
another walk and an Alex Trevino
home run into a seven-run rally and
a 7-6 lead. Seven Giants runs on
two hits and no Atlanta errors. And
that's your Giants' replay.
The crowd roared from the time

Jose Uribe walked to lead off the in
ning — at that point, the Giants had
one hit in the game — and called
Trevino out of the dugout after his
redemptive clout. It was all too
cruel. In the top of the next inning,
a hard-hit ground ball went through
Manny Trillo, Rob Deer made a bad
throw from right field, and the
Braves went ahead 8-7. That was
the eventual score by which the
Giants lost their 100 th game of the
season.
In the bottom of the ninth it went
groundout, strikeout, strikeout. As
Ron Roenicke, a journeyman out
fielder who was the Giants' Player
of the Month for September,
trudged back to the dugout, the
crowd stood and shuffled about. It
didn't cheer. It didn't call the team
out of the dugout. Time passed, as
the Braves ran through the drizzle
to get to their clubhouse. "I Left
My Heart in San Francisco" was fol
lowed on the PA system by the
theme from"The Way We Were."
Finally, two Giants players
walked out to home plate to give
away the last Fan Appreciation Day
prize, a Ford Bronco. For one hor
rifying moment, it seemed as if the
entire crowd was loudly booing the
players; then it became apparent
the crowd, with more enthusiasm
than it had shown for anything since
the 49ers score, was yelling
"Bluuue, Bluuue." Vida Blue,
wearing gold baseball shoes with
his Giants uniform, told the crowd,
"I hope I'm a Giant next year." The
crowd roared. Then he drew a
ticket for the Bronco.
The winner had already left.

Atlanta 17. Later that inning, it
began to rain.
In the bottom of the sixth, with
the Giants still trailing, 6-0, lightn
ing struck. The Giants parlayed
four walks, a single, a wild pitch,
another walk and an Alex Trevino
home run into a seven-run rally and
a 7-6 lead. Seven Giants runs on
two hits and no Atlanta errors. And
that's your Giants' replay.
The crowd roared from the time

Jose Uribe walked to lead off the in
ning — at that point, the Giants had
one hit in the game — and called
Trevino out of the dugout after his
redemptive clout. It was all too
cruel. In the top of the next inning,
a hard-hit ground ball went through
Manny Trillo, Rob Deer made a bad
throw from right field, and the
Braves went ahead 8-7. That was
the eventual score by which the
Giants lost their 100 th game of the
season.
In the bottom of the ninth it went
groundout, strikeout, strikeout. As
Ron Roenicke, a journeyman out
fielder who was the Giants' Player
of the Month for September,
trudged back to the dugout, the
crowd stood and shuffled about. It
didn't cheer. It didn't call the team
out of the dugout. Time passed, as
the Braves ran through the drizzle
to get to their clubhouse. "I Left
My Heart in San Francisco" was fol
lowed on the PA system by the
theme from"The Way We Were."
Finally, two Giants players
walked out to home plate to give
away the last Fan Appreciation Day
prize, a Ford Bronco. For one hor
rifying moment, it seemed as if the
entire crowd was loudly booing the
players; then it became apparent
the crowd, with more enthusiasm
than it had shown for anything since
the 49ers score, was yelling
"Bluuue, Bluuue." Vida Blue,
wearing gold baseball shoes with
his Giants uniform, told the crowd,
"I hope I'm a Giant next year." The
crowd roared. Then he drew a
ticket for the Bronco.
The winner had already left.

A dejected Dan Gladden is the only man left in the Giants' dugout following their 100 th, and last,
loss of the season yesterday. Gladden was on deck when Ron Roenicke struck out to end the
game.
You're the San Francisco Giants.
You're playing what you claim will
be your last game in the only
stadium you've ever called home.
What do you do to mark the occa
sion?
That's right. You give away 20
pounds of beef franks between in
nings.
You also have your public ad
dress announcer say, "Ladies and
gentlemen, welcome — for the last
time — to Candlestick Park." If the
16,202 diehard fans who turned out
yesterday to wish the Giants
farewell were looking for clues to
Giants owner Bob Lurie's inten
tions, that was one of the more
striking ones. Or perhaps the
future could be read in the fact that
what may have been the Giants' last
day at the 'Stick was . . . Sunnyvale
Day.
The crowd — presumably beefed
Up by some portion of the popula
tion of Sunnyvale — parked in
bright sunshine. By noon, 10
minutes before game time, the fog
had rolled in and half-covered the
stadium. Only right field, where
there aren't any baseball seats, was
in the sun.
Everything about the day — the
weather, the game, the crowd —
was utterly typical of the Giants' ut
terly depressing season. Out in
right field, the retired numbers of
Bill Terry, Mel Ott, Willie Mays,
Juan Marichal and Willie McCovey
had been taken down so that the
49ers' extra seats could be moved

in. No one had bothered to put
them back up for the Giants' last
game. Later on, a Giants spokes
man evoked the great Candlestick
tradition: Willie Mays played there,
Willie McCovey played there. You
couldn't have proved it by the right
field fence.
In the stands, the really excited
fans were the ones listening to, or
watching, the 49ers game. Down
on the field, Tom Sanchez of Gilroy
gave a fine a capella rendition of the
national anthem, and everything
went downhill from there. The At
lanta Braves scored a run in the
first, four more in the second and
by the fourth had scored six runs on
12 hits off four Giants pitchers.
In the bottom of the second, with

the 49ers safely ahead of Atlanta,
the crowd came to life. It looked
up, saw that there was no one on
base and a two-strike count on
Giants catcher Bob Brenly, and
began rhythmically clapping.
As the applause reached its
height, Brenly went spinning out of
the way of a called third strike, his
bat held high on his shoulder. At the
same instant, the clouds rolled over
right field, completely socking in
the stadium.
You'd think that, on the Giants'
last day in Candlestick, the weather
could have cooperated — that the
Giants could have been given one of
those sunny, breezy, perfect-for
baseball afternoons, the kind that
Candlestick has, more often than

not, when the Giants play day
games. But no. In the fourth inning,
the lights came on, and stayed on
for the rest of the game. At least it
wasn't raining.
In the fifth inning a scoreboard
announcement drew the day's big
gest cheer: Final score, 49ers 38,
Atlanta 17. Later that inning, it
began to rain.
In the bottom of the sixth, with
the Giants still trailing, 6-0, lightn
ing struck. The Giants parlayed

home run into a seven-run rally and
