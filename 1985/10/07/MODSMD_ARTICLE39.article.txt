Five Die in Beirut Battles
BEIRUT, Lebanon — At least five people were killed and 24
injured yesterday as Christian and Moslem militias traded artillery
and rocket fire across the Green Line dividing the two sectors of the
capital in a flare-up that spilled over into residential areas, police re
ported.
Shells crashed deep inside the demarcation line into mostly Mos
lem West Beirut and in Christian areas of East Beirut.
The clashes followed fighting Saturday between Druse militiamen
and the Lebanese army in the hills east and southeast of Beirut, in
which four people were killed and 12 injured when two Soviet-made
rockets landed in a line at an East Beirut gasoline station.
The northern Lebanese port city of Tripoli, the scene of almost
three weeks of heavy fighting during which two-thirds of the city's
500,000 residents fled into surrounding areas, was reported quiet
yesterday as Syrian troops entered the city.
The troops were due to spend their first day rounding up and
storing heavy artillery belonging to the PLO-backed Sunni Moslem
fundamentalists and their opponents, pro-Syrian leftist militias.
The Syrian deployment was part of an agreement for a cease-fire
between the nval militias reached Thursday in Damascus, with the
mediation of Syria and Iran.
Under the protection of heavily-armed Druse Moslem militiamen
and Soviet Embassy officials, the body of Soviet cultural attache
Arkady Katkov, who was killed Wednesday by his Sunni fundamen
talist kidnappers, was taken yesterday to Damascus from where it
was to be flown home to Moscow.
There was still no news of the whereabouts of the remaining three
Soviet officials being held hostage — Press Attache Oleg Spirine,
Commercial Attache Valery Korniev and embassy doctor Nikolai
Svirsky. There was also no trace of U.S. diplomat William Buckley,
whom Moslem fundamentalists extremists claimed Friday to have
executed.
Killings Strain Egypt-Israel Ties
JERUSALEM — The shooting deaths of seven Israeli tourists,
killed in the Sinai Peninsula by an apparently beserk Egyptian secur
ity officer, threatened yesterday to further sour official relations be
tween the two nations despite efforts by top Israeli officials to avoid
inflaming the situation.
Neither the Israeli Foreign Ministry nor the Prime Minister's office
released any official statement, pending an answer to Jerusalem's re
quest to Egypt for clarification within 48 hours of still sketchy details
of the incident. The shooting occurred Saturday afternoon at Ras
Bourka, about 25 miles south of the Israeli port of Eilat.
"We simply don't have enough information," a Foreign Ministry of
ficial said when asked to comment.
However, a clearly angry Israeli Health Minister, Mordechai Gur,
charged during a visit to two children wounded in the same attack
that at least one, and possibly more, Of the fatal victims died heed
lessly because Egyptian police prevented medical help from reaching
the scene.
"I don't understand any behavior of that kind," Gur said. "And of
course the Egyptian government will have to explain to us and will
have to take measures first of all against those people who were in
volved and then to make sure that it will never happen again."
Mohanned Bassiouny, charge d'affaires at the Egyptian Embassy
here, denied that Egyptian security officers had interfered with ad
ministration of medical aid for the victims and branded reports to the
contrary a "malicious rumor" aimed at undermining relations be
tween the two nations.
Boesak Slams S. African Policy
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — The Rev. Allan Boesak, a
leading campaigner against apartheid who is barred from active
politics pending his trial on subversion charges, used the pulpit of his
Cape Town church yesterday for a stinging attack on the South
African government.
Boesak declared that there would be no peace in this country as
long as the present government remained in power and apartheid,
the country's system of racial segregation and white-minority rule,
remained in force.
"Apartheid is like that god Moloch which lived off the sacrifice of
little children in ancient days," Boesak said, referring to the deaths
of young people, some only four years old, in the continuing unrest
here. "We are seeing the final convulsions of the beast."
Speaking at a special prayer service attended by more than 3,000
at his parish outside Cape Town, Boesak was as strong as ever in
condemning apartheid, rejecting the government's plan of gradual
reforms and urging his supporters to intensify their fight against the
system.
"The chaos in this country is the result of a policy of a government
that is cruel and inhuman," he declared in his fiery sermon, "and as
long as this government is in power, our society, our land will be in
chaos.
It was Boesak's first major address since he was charged with four
counts of subversion last month under South Africa's security laws
and released under severe restrictions intended to put a crimp in his
political activities. He emphasized his determination to continue to
speak out against apartheid and to lead the growing battle against it.
In the country's continuing unrest, police headquarters in Pretoria
reported that a black was killed, apparently as a suspected police in
former or government collaborator, in Langa, a black township
outside Uitenhage near Port Elizabeth in eastern Cape province.
The body, found on a pyre of burning tires, was so badly charred that
police were unable immediately to determine whether it was that of a
man or woman.
Rioting was also reported in the black townships outside Johannes
burg, Cape Town and Durban as well as around rural towns of Cape
province.
Socialists Falter in Portugal
LISBON, Portugal — The voters of Portugal dealt a blow yester
day to the presidential hopes of Prime Minister Mario Soares by
knocking his Socialist Party out of its position as the leading party in
the Portuguese Parliament.
But the election returns left the Portuguese political situation in
confusion. The centrist Social Democratic Party, which edged out
the Socialists, did not win enough seats to control by itself the As
sembly of the Republic, as the Portuguese Parliament is called. In
tense maneuvering and bargaining must now take place to determine
the makeup of a coalition to run the assembly.
But President Antonio Ramalho Eanes, who may have done more
than anyone else to ensure the defeat of the Socialists, is sure to ask
45-year-old Anibal Cavaco Silva, the leader of the Social Democrats,
to serve as prime minister and try to form a government.

Boesak Slams S. African Policy
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — The Rev. Allan Boesak, a
leading campaigner against apartheid who is barred from active
politics pending his trial on subversion charges, used the pulpit of his
Cape Town church yesterday for a stinging attack on the South
African government.
Boesak declared that there would be no peace in this country as
long as the present government remained in power and apartheid,
the country's system of racial segregation and white-minority rule,
remained in force.
"Apartheid is like that god Moloch which lived off the sacrifice of
little children in ancient days," Boesak said, referring to the deaths
of young people, some only four years old, in the continuing unrest
here. "We are seeing the final convulsions of the beast."
Speaking at a special prayer service attended by more than 3,000
at his parish outside Cape Town, Boesak was as strong as ever in
condemning apartheid, rejecting the government's plan of gradual
reforms and urging his supporters to intensify their fight against the
system.
"The chaos in this country is the result of a policy of a government
that is cruel and inhuman," he declared in his fiery sermon, "and as
long as this government is in power, our society, our land will be in
chaos.
It was Boesak's first major address since he was charged with four
counts of subversion last month under South Africa's security laws
and released under severe restrictions intended to put a crimp in his
political activities. He emphasized his determination to continue to
speak out against apartheid and to lead the growing battle against it.
In the country's continuing unrest, police headquarters in Pretoria
reported that a black was killed, apparently as a suspected police in
former or government collaborator, in Langa, a black township
outside Uitenhage near Port Elizabeth in eastern Cape province.
The body, found on a pyre of burning tires, was so badly charred that
police were unable immediately to determine whether it was that of a
man or woman.
Rioting was also reported in the black townships outside Johannes
burg, Cape Town and Durban as well as around rural towns of Cape
province.
Socialists Falter in Portugal
LISBON, Portugal — The voters of Portugal dealt a blow yester
day to the presidential hopes of Prime Minister Mario Soares by
knocking his Socialist Party out of its position as the leading party in
the Portuguese Parliament.
But the election returns left the Portuguese political situation in
confusion. The centrist Social Democratic Party, which edged out
the Socialists, did not win enough seats to control by itself the As
sembly of the Republic, as the Portuguese Parliament is called. In
tense maneuvering and bargaining must now take place to determine
the makeup of a coalition to run the assembly.
But President Antonio Ramalho Eanes, who may have done more
than anyone else to ensure the defeat of the Socialists, is sure to ask
45-year-old Anibal Cavaco Silva, the leader of the Social Democrats,
to serve as prime minister and try to form a government.
Five Die in Beirut Battles
BEIRUT, Lebanon — At least five people were killed and 24
injured yesterday as Christian and Moslem militias traded artillery
and rocket fire across the Green Line dividing the two sectors of the
capital in a flare-up that spilled over into residential areas, police re
ported.
Shells crashed deep inside the demarcation line into mostly Mos
lem West Beirut and in Christian areas of East Beirut.
The clashes followed fighting Saturday between Druse militiamen
and the Lebanese army in the hills east and southeast of Beirut, in
which four people were killed and 12 injured when two Soviet-made
rockets landed in a line at an East Beirut gasoline station.
The northern Lebanese port city of Tripoli, the scene of almost
three weeks of heavy fighting during which two-thirds of the city's
500,000 residents fled into surrounding areas, was reported quiet
yesterday as Syrian troops entered the city.
The troops were due to spend their first day rounding up and
storing heavy artillery belonging to the PLO-backed Sunni Moslem
fundamentalists and their opponents, pro-Syrian leftist militias.
The Syrian deployment was part of an agreement for a cease-fire
between the nval militias reached Thursday in Damascus, with the
mediation of Syria and Iran.
Under the protection of heavily-armed Druse Moslem militiamen
and Soviet Embassy officials, the body of Soviet cultural attache
Arkady Katkov, who was killed Wednesday by his Sunni fundamen
talist kidnappers, was taken yesterday to Damascus from where it
was to be flown home to Moscow.
There was still no news of the whereabouts of the remaining three
Soviet officials being held hostage — Press Attache Oleg Spirine,
Commercial Attache Valery Korniev and embassy doctor Nikolai
Svirsky. There was also no trace of U.S. diplomat William Buckley,
whom Moslem fundamentalists extremists claimed Friday to have
executed.
