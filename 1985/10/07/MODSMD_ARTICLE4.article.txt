# New Phones Expected by Late January
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Senior staff writer 
The black rotary telephone, long an insti
tution in Stanford offices, is on its way out.
The 7,000 phones that will serve the
main campus should be operational by late
January, said Michael Roberts in mid-
August. Roberts is director of the Univer
sity's Telecommunications Project, which
selected and arranged for the new, $21 mil
lion Focus SL 100 system.
According to Roberts, the 6,000 or so
remaining phones should be working about
six weeks later. University News Service
reported that phones in the Medical Center,

Welch Road offices, Hoover Pavilion, the
Stanford Museum and the chemistry build
ings should be operational by mid-March.
The old Centrex system, based on an en
gineering design from the 19505, was never
intended to handle the current load of
phone and data transmissions, said Bert
Stubbs, communications engineering
manager for Information Technology
Services (ITS). Focus is also capable of ex
pansion without disruption of service, he
added.
Focus will also pack more service into
less space, Stubbs said.
The University has ordered 13,000
modem touchtone phones to accompany
the Focus system. Wiring and installation of

phone jacks is currently 80 percent com
plete, Stubbs said.
The implementation of the new system
necessitated analysis of phone usage to
customize service and phone locations for
individual buildings and departments.
Stubbs said analysts are in the process of
reviewing and modifying the completed
work before the connection phase takes
place, and despite small delays due to im-'
properly installed conduit pipe, the project
is on schedule.
"As it turned out, there really weren't
any delays," Stubbs said. "We appear to be
in our budget limits at this point in time."
Construction involved the laying of con
duit. pipes and new fiber-optics transmission

cables, Stubbs said. The new cables will
link eight; electronic communications hubs
(ECH) at strategic points on campus with
the primary SL 100 switch in Bonair Siding.
"The intent is to place the intelligence
remotely where the system's clients are,"
Stubbs said.
Flans call for the addition of the small,
cost-effective hubs in regions where usage
increases, including areas of new building
construction on campus.
The design of the system includes back
up batteries for power failures and new
cable for special data services requiring
copper cables. New cable for fire alarm and
energy-management systems was also in
tegrated.

According to Stubbs, the activation of the
new system should free University phone
users from such common afflictions as long
waits for connections and service delays. In
addition, the new system should also
greatly reduce the number of service calls,
he said.
Technicians will be able to perform
numerous tests from the central control
center in Forsythe Hall, he said. New or
ders and number changes can also be
serviced by software changes instead of
physical modifications.
Phone users will receive special training
sessions, handbooks and "help" numbers
from communications staff members to
ease the transition to the new system.
