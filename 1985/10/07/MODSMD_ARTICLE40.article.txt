# U.S. Cancels $5.4 Billion IMF Plan
## Viability of Third World aid plan in question 
### 
SEOUL, South Korea — The United States
yesterday withdrew its plan to create a new $5.4
billion lending fund within the World Bank and In
ternational Monetary Fund to help the least
developed nations, mostly in Africa.
The action raised immediate questions about
the viability of a separate U.S. proposal to deal
with the foreign debt problems of Latin America,
which owes an estimated $360 billion. Almost
two-thirds of that debt is to private banks.
Treasury Secretary James Baker Ill's decision
to introduce the new measures — including the
one pulled back yesterday- — indicated a recogni
tion that the current method of dealing with the
debt crisis, particularly in Latin America, has not
been working and that a new approach was
needed.
Baker formally withdrew the proposal for the
new fund at a meeting of the world's group of 10
major industrial nations. The session was a pre
liminary to the annual joint meeting of the World
Bank and the IMF that starts tomorrow.
Sources at the meeting said the United States
now plans to offer a more modest proposal for

helping the underdeveloped nations. No details
were available, but sources said the latest plan
only involves the IMF — with no matching
money from the World Bank.
The United States had planned to ask the two
international lending agencies to set up the fund,
which the agencies would jointly administer, as
additional help to underdeveloped nations,
primarily in Africa. Commercial bank money that
was to be used in the new fund would be
guaranteed by the World Bank.
The U.S. plan, which first came to light two
weeks ago, represented a major policy shift for
the Reagan Administration. But the plan ran into
strong opposition from rich and poor nations
alike almost from the moment Baker arrived
here Saturday.
Industrial nations did not like the idea of the
World Bank guaranteeing commercial loans, and
the poor nations feared they might lose aid they
now receive from the two international lending
agencies.
The United States did break its silence Satur
day on one important issue involving future aid to

developing nations. World Bank officials said the
United States had agreed to begin discussions on
an increase in financial contributions to the Inter
national Development Association, the arm of
the World Bank that serves as the major source
of development aid to the world's poorest na
tions. Negotiations are expected to begin in
Paris early next year and should be completed
before the end of 1986.
The United States has managed to keep se
cret the details of its proposal for dealing with
the Latin American debt situation, but highly
placed sources said that a key element was to
enlarge the role of the World Bank by obtaining
fresh loan money from commercial banks that
would be guaranteed by the international
agency.
The U.S. proposal for dealing with both the
Third World development problems and the
Latin American debt situation was to be part of a
new "integrated" debt strategy that would give a
greater role to the World Bank and force a closer
working relationship between the bank and the
IMF.
