# London Riots Involve Hundreds
## 
### 
LONDON — A police officer was
fatally stabbed, and two other offi
cers and a newsman were wounded
by shotgun blasts yesterday in fero
cious street battles with hundreds
of rampaging youths in the racially
mixed Tottenham section of north
London.
The victims were among more
than 50 people injured in what was
the most savage outbreak of the ur
ban violence that has plagued Brit
ain during the last month.
Scotland Yard said scores of
rioters were arrested and heavy
police reinforcements armed with
tear gas were sent to the Totten
ham area in an attempt to restore
order. However, rioting was still in
progress early this morning.
Between 400 and 500 mainly
young people were involved in the

rioting, police officials said. They
added that both white and blacks
were involved. Looting and arson
was also reported as rioters broke
into schools and shops, overturned
cars and set them on fire. One
house was reported set ablaze. El
derly residents of neighboring
streets were evacuated.
The caretaker of a housing proj
ect in the midst of the rioting said:
"Every time the police charge the
mob they are being pelted with
firebombs and paving slabs. Things
are being thrown by people on the
balconies. The atmosphere is ex
plosive."
The cause of the violence was
apparently similar to that which
triggered two nights of rioting last
weekend in the mainly black south

London district of Brixton — a
police raid on a black family's home
that went tragically wrong.
More than 50 persons were
injured and 150 were arrested in a
frenzy of looting, arson and assaults
in Brixton when police accidentally
shot and wounded a black mother of
six as they burst into her home in
search of one of her sons, wanted in
connection with a shooting incident.
A police spokesman said yester
day's violence started when 49-
year-old Cynthia Jarrett collapsed
and died when police entered her
home in search of stolen goods.
Police said Jarrett was
cooperative "but towards the end of
the search another of her sons
arrived home and began strongly
objecting to the police presence."

"She collapsed and the officers
were physically shoved out of the
house," a police statement said.
Police finally persuaded the family
to allow the officers to return to the
home, "and one of the officers
trained in first aid administered
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but
without success," the statement
said.
As word of the woman's death
spread through the neighborhood
yesterday, tension rose sharply.
And violence erupted after relatives
and friends protested during the af
ternoon outside the local police sta
tion.
The area's local government
chairman, Bernie Grant, a black,
condemned the police search and
demanded a public investigation of
the incident that triggered the riot..
