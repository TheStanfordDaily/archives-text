No Senate Budget Bill
WASHINGTON — The Senate, meeting in
an extraordinary Sunday session, failed yes
terday to choke off debate on legislation to bal
ance the federal budget by 1991, although the
proposal won enough support to pass if further
procedural hurdles can be scaled.
The Sunday session — the fourth in 12
years — was called because the budget pro
posal is being considered as part of debt-ceiling
extension legislation that the Treasury De
partment says is needed by today to prevent
disruption of government financing operations.
But the government will operate as usual
today and probably longer if history is any
guide. Moreover, Senate Majority Leader
Robert Dole (R-Kan.) said he hopes to meet
this morning with other congressional leaders
to discuss ways to "avoid a crisis."
After coming into session in mid-afternoon
with all but five members attending, the Sen
ate voted 57-38 yesterday to limit debate by
invoking cloture on the budget proposal. But
this was seven votes short of the two-thirds
plurality needed for cloture.
It would be more than a majority, however,
for passage of the legislation itself. The mea
sure picked up two more votes on a second
procedural test.
Democratic leaders continued to hold out

against quick action on the measure, protest
ing that it was so complicated and fraught with
potential difficulties for the economy and
operations of government that more time was
needed for consideration.
The proposal would set fixed deficit limits
over the next six years to force a lowering of
the deficit from $180 billion annually down to
zero by fiscal 1991.
If limits are exceeded, the president would
be required to cut spending proportionately.
Court Opens Today
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court
opens its 1985 term today confronting a re
charged, revamped and newly aggressive
Justice Department effort to translate the
Reagan Administration's views on race, reli
gion and abortion into the law of the land.
The Administration will go full tilt against
civil rights organizations over the issues of af
firmative action, voting rights and racial dis
crimination in the criminal justice process.
It will seek, for the first time, an outright
reversal of the 1973 decision legalizing abor
tion and new federal power over medical treat
ment of severely handicapped newborns. And,
as part of its continuing effort to bridge the gap
between church and state, it will ask the court

to allow student prayer groups to meet in
public high schools.
The tone and substance of the Administra
tion's arguments before the court are ex
pected to be different this year. Gone are At
torney General William French Smith and
Solicitor General Rex Lee, low-key con
servatives who were criticized by some on the
right for their restraint in approaching the
court.
The Justice Department is now firmly in the
control of more activist conservatives, led by
Attorney General Edwin Meese 111.
In Solicitor General-Designate Charles
Fried, on leave from Harvard Law School,
Meese has a Supreme Court litigator who is
seen as far more amenable to the Administra
tion's ideological banner.
Fried's brief urging reversal of the 12-year
old abortion decision is seen as the first and
clearest evidence of the change.
The Administration's chances for success
are unpredictable. The splintered court, with
its many 5-to-4 rulings, has followed a zigzag
course in dealing with some of these issues,
giving a little one year only to take a little back
the next.
Liberals, who no longer expect big gains at
the court, say that they will be satisfied to
avoid significant losses.
