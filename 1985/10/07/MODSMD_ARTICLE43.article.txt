High-Tech Drawbacks
OAKLAND — A study to be released next
week says overemphasis on high-tech indus
tries threatens the economic base of the San
Francisco Bay area, as strong industries such
as banking and insurance shift south to Los An
geles, it was reported yesterday.
The Oakland Tribune said those conclusions
are part of a study by Raymond Brady, re
search manager of the Association of Bay Area
Governments. The story said the report will
be presented at ABAG's general assembly
Oct. 18.
"Brady reports that most of the jobs created
in the Bay Area between 1962 and 1982 have
been in high-technology fields and centered in
Santa Clara County." said the Tribune.
Brady is further quoted as believing "if that
trend continues, and there is a major blow to

the high-tech market, it could spell economic
disaster for the Bay Area." The official ob
served that Silicon Valley is under increasing
overseas competition.
He notes that 89 percent of gains in the
manufacturing sector in that period were in the
high-tech field, and that before 1962 less than
19 percent of the region's economy was in that
area.
L.A. Fetuses Buried
EAST LOS ANGELES — Six wooden cof
fins bearing the remains of 16,433 aborted
fetuses were given a non-religious county
burial yesterday as anti-abortionists gathered
to pray and hear a reading of a eulogy written
by President Reagan.
The three-year legal battle over whether

the county could hand over the fetuses to reli
gious groups for burial went to the U.S. Su
preme Court, which upheld lower court deci
sions that the county could either bury or
cremate the fetuses but not arrange or partici
pate in any religious services.
Thus, separate functions were v eld yester
day at the Odd Fellows Cemeteiy — an offi
cially unadorned county burial preceded by the
religious gathering, which included three U.S.
Marines who draped one coffin with a U.S.
flag.
"I am confident that your memorial service
will touch many others as you proclaim the in
violability of human life at every stage of devel
opment," Reagan said in a eulogy delivered by
Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike An
tonovich. "From these innocent dead, let us
take increased devotion to the cause of restor
ing the rights of the unborn."
