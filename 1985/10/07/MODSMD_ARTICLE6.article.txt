# Palo Alto Pens Postcard for Peace
## 
### MARILYN WANN Editorial staff 
"Here's a chance for you to send
a piece, spelled P-E-A-C-E, of your
mind to President Reagan,"
proclaimed the man standing on a
platform at the corner of University
and Emerson Streets Saturday.
He wasn't a sidewalk politician
shouting his views, but a represen
tative for the Mid-Peninsula Peace
Center, which is sponsoring a drive
to string together the world's
longest post card with messages
from community members and stu
dents calling for peace.
Prof. Emeritus Linus Pauling
was among the approximately
2,000 people who took the announ
cer up on his offer.
Pauling advised Reagan on his
card that "cooperation with the So
viet Union is the road to mutual
prosperity and peace."
The drive will continue through
the month, according to Joan Bazar,
a coordinator for the event and a
Peace Center worker.
Cards are available at the center,
located on Waverly Street in Palo

Aito, ior a suggested donation of
$1.
The completed messages will be
tied together and delivered in time
for the November summit by a
delegation representing all the sig
natories, said Bazar.
She estimated that most of the
cards were written by people who
just walked by and were attracted
by the music and free bagels at the
event, but then were curious
enough to find out what was really
going on.
Bazar said that April Nielson, a
volunteer at the center, got the
idea to try to break a record after
she worked at a job writing ques
tions for the popular board game,
Trivial Pursuit.
Another peace group had already
made the world's largest post card,
so they decided to give people the
normal-sized cards and then tie
them end to end.
Bazar added that they are merely
trying to establish a record with this
event and would encourage other
groups to try to break it by spon
soring their own drives.
