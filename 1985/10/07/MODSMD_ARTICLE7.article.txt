# Bus Route Adds Safety After Dark
## 
### SARAH TILTON 
A nighttime bus service has
been added to the University's ar
senal of campus safety precau
tions.
ASSURE, which runs Sunday
through Friday nights from 6:30
to 12:30, is designed to provide
service between dormitories,
classes and libraries and to allevi
ate the load on SURE, the stu
dent escort service.
The bus will circle the regular
Marguerite stops, providing ser
vice to Escondido Village, Gover
nor's Corner and more centrally
located areas.

According to Council of Presi
dents member Leslie Leland, the
ASSU-sponsored shuttle is more
student oriented then the daytime
Marguerite shuttles.
Maps and schedules for the
new service are available at
Tresidder Union and on dor
mitory bulletin boards. Schedules

are also printed oh ASSURE bus
stop signs.
Students proposed ASSURE
last spring, and the service is
funded directly by students as
part of the ASSU fee assessment.
The estimated cost per student is
$1.04, and the University funds
advertising and signs.
