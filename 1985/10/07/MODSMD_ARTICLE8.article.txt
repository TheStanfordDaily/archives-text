# Pennsylvania Rep. William Gray
## Congressman Speaks Out 
### XAVIER BRIGGS 
The federal budget deficit is
"closing the door of economic op
portunity," said Rep. William Gray
(D-Penn.) during a speech Friday at
Branner Hall.
The $1.8 trillion national debt is
"a growing national crisis," said
Gray, who is the chairman of the
House Budget Committee.
"You may be the first generation
growing up in an America unable to
believe that you can lift up and do
better than your mothers and fat
hers," he warned students. "Your
future will not be as bright, as hope
ful, as upwardly mobile as those
who came before you," he added.
Gray stated that the debt had
doubled during the period of
Reagan's presidency, due to a sig
nificant imbalance between reve
nues and expenditures as percent
ages of the GNP.
The apparent economic growth
enjoyed by this country in 1984 was
based primarily on $100 billion of
foreign capital, Gray said.
He stressed that citizens of all
economic levels will feel the impact
of "exceedingly high interest rates"
and jobs lost due to the overvalued
dollar and resulting trade deficit.

"This means," Gray said, "that
funds that could be available for in
vestment in three vital areas are
not there: investments in our natu
ral resources . . . infrastructure

. . . and in the most important thing
in this great nation, our human re
sources â€” young minds that want
an education, those in need of
retraining and new skills."
Current spending cuts will not
significantly affect the $200 billion
deficits," Gray said.
"The Administration likes to walk
around in the sheep's clothing of fis
cal austerity," he said.

Solving our fiscal problems must
involve both raising revenues and
reducing expenditures, Gray said.
But he warned against "quick fix so
lutions which in the long run could
be disastrous to the economy as
well as to the Constitution and the
checks and balances."
"When you leave this great uni
versity, are you going to be spend
ing most of your lifetime repaying
this debt and therefore not having
the opportunities past generations
had?" Gray said.
Gray also addressed what he
sees as "an increasing double stan
dard in U.S. foreign policy on
human rights."
"Certainly we ought to speak out
against the abuses of the commu
nist regimes in Poland," Gray said.
"But if we light a candle for those
oppressed in Poland, why can't we
strike a match for those oppressed
in South Africa? . . . Why can't we
raise our voices in support of those
suffering because of their attempts
to protest the institutionalized rac
win in their country?"
Concluding his talk, Gray encour
aged students to become aware of
the significance of public policy
making. "Anything that influences
your lives so much, you ought to ba
involved with," he said.
