# SIG Fellowships Send Students to Washington
## 
### ELAINE RIGGS 
Stanford students hit Washing
ton, D.C. in full force this summer,
with more than 100 working as in
terns on Capitol Hill. The interns
included four students who
received Stanford-in-Government
(SIG) fellowships, which guarantee
substantive work and a $1,000
stipend.
Fifth-year senior Bill Handley
received a fellowship last summer
to work in Sen. Edward Kennedy's
(D-Mass.) office researching arms con
trol issues. Among his duties was
writing Kennedy's statement on the
40th anniversary of the bombing of
Hiroshima.
"It was difficult at first because I
was only given mundane things to
do . . . but working in a legislative
office means that you get a lot of
dirty work . . . and then all of a sud
den you're given something impor
tant to do," Handley said.
Handley also researched an arti
cle on "Star Wars" policies for Ken

nedy's research assistant and joined
other SIG members to hear Stan
ford graduate and Supreme Court
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
speak.
O'Connor was just one of the
speakers invited by SIG to address
the Washington interns. Among the
other speakers were Rep. Jack
Kemp (R-N.Y.), a possible presi
dential candidate in 1988, and Jim
Wright (D-Texas), the majority
leader of the House.
"Senator Alan Cranston invited
the SIG students and spoke can
didly to us about South Africa and
what Stanford should do. Consider
ing how busy he was, he was very
generous with his time," Handley
said.
Sophomore Eric Richardson also
served as an intern. Through the
SIG housing service, he found a
room to rent from an alumnus,
paying $180 for five weeks.
"Basically my job was answering
constituent mail," said Richardson,
who worked for Congressman Bob
Traxler (D-Mich.). "I would write

the reply, then Traxler would read
it over and sign it."
Interning in a congressional office
has several side benefits, Richard
son pointed out. "The job gets you
an ID card, which allows access to
almost anywhere on Capitol Hill —
the hearings, the senators' offices
and so on," he said.

Working in a legislative office means
that you get a lot of dirty work . . . and
then all of a sudden you're given
something important to do.'
— Bill Handley

As a result, Richardson attended
hearings on tax reform and the
1985 farm bill. "Some were re
quired, others I chose to go to."
Richardson's internship was paid,
but "you're not going to make

money," he said. "It's expensive to
live in D.C." One-third of the 100
interns had paid internships.
Lisa Capps worked at St.
Elizabeth's Hospital for the
criminally insane last summer, as an
investigator for the Public Defender
Service. The patients (among them
John Hinckley) are there against

their will, having been judged dan
gerous to themselves or others.
Capps interviewed patients to
see if they wanted to contest that
decision. If they did, they would be
assigned a public defender. She

would then assist the defender by
interviewing the defendants'
families, the police and other
sources.
"It was a fascinating internship,"
Capps stated. "These people are
really crazy.
"It was difficult because I
defended them, but a lot of times I
thought they were in need of treat
ment."
Capps noted, "The legal intern
ship was a really good experience.
It has directed me toward that
profession."
Another part of the interns' ex
periences were the SIG social func
tions. These included happy hours
in pubs, softball games and parties
on the Fourth of July.
Prospective Stanford interns do
not apply for the positions in the
same way as their Eastern counter
parts. Many students living
relatively close to the Washington,
D.C. area can travel there for inter
views.
Because Stanford students can
not afford to do the same, SIG

sends three members of its board
every spring to lobby for the candi
dates.
When asked how this procedure
compares to an interview, Jeff
Perkl, executive director of Office
Resources, said, "I think that (the
employers) are impressed that
Stanford cares enough to send the
lobbyists ... the reception is over
whelmingly positive."
Catherine Milton, the SIG ad
visor, said "I think everybody who
wanted a job, got a job." Scott
Reisch, president of SIG last year,
concurred, but added, "You can't
always get your first choice. But a
lot of the people that were com
plaining in the beginning ... are
happiest in the end."
Last year, 30 students applied
for the four fellowships, which are
awarded based on merit and funded
solely from alumni contributions.
In addition, SIG provides general
listings of available internships in
Washington for all Stanford stu
dents. The student-run organiza
tion also directs interns to housing.
