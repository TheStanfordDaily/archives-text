The Palo Alto LSAT Program
Do You Have to Prepare in Advance for the LSAT?
The LSAT is a test of reading skills and abstract reasoning ability. No one course of study
prepares for it. Most Stanford student are good readers, and most have substantial analytic
skills. If a student takes the time to practice short reading passages and brushes up on the
reasoning examples provided in the LSAT booklet, he or she may be able to do quite well
without a formal LSAT course. Taking two or three practice LSATs, such as those available at
the AIC, would be a big help.
What Can a Formal Course Do to Help?
Many courses offered in the Bay Area provide instruction in test-taking strategy, pointers
and practice in each of the four LSAT test areas, homework, and review. Even a very bright
student may benefit from protracted exposure to LSAT questions; routinization of approaches;
and constructive suggestions and feedback f r om a trained instructor. These courses cost from
$125 to $400 — the expensive ones usually meet over a period of several weeks. While a
course is not indispensable, it can help even a good reader and thinker by giving that student
lots of practice.
What My Program Can Offer.
I have prepared Stanford students for the LSAT since 1978, working with a maximum
class size of 15 students. I am a former faculty member at Stanford, a Stanford J.D., and a
practicing attorney. I provide thorough instruction for each question area; substantial
homework materials; and in-class review geared to focus on the problems encountered by
each student in my course. My course for the December 7 LSAT starts on October 13 and
costs $325. If you are interested, please call me.
