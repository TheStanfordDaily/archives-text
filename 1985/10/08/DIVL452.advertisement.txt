Microdisc is Stanford's microcomputer discount
purchase plan for eligible faculty, students, and staff.
Currently offered are selected products from Apple,
IBM, and Hewlett-Packard. See below for a description
of recent changes to the Apple product list.
Please note that prices quoted in the following descriptions do not
include handling fee, sales tax, or shipping.
IMAGEWRITER REPLACED BY IMAGEWRITER II
Effective immediately, the Imagewriter printer has been
discontinued and replaced by the Imagewriter 11. Apple
describes the Imagewriter II as providing print quality and
speed roughly equivalent to the old Imagewriter when used
with the Macintosh. The Imagewriter II will cost $412.50, $20
more than the old Imagewriter.
MODIFICATION TO 512K MACINTOSH BUNDLE
The previously announced 512K Macintosh bundle has been
modified to include the Imagewriter II printer. The bundle
includes a 512K Macintosh, external disk drive, Imagewriter
II printer, and a carrying case. The new price is $2110.00,
which represents a savings of $23.50 as compared with
buying these components separately (plus you get a
carrying case). The ending date of the bundle pricing
has been extended to December 31, 1985.
PRICE REDUCTION FOR 512K MEMORY
UPGRADE
The price for the 512K memory upgrade kit has been
reduced from $425 to $349.
