President Reagan recently expressed "sincere
condolences" to Tunisia about the loss of lives
caused by the Israeli bombing of the Palestine
Liberation Organization headquarters last week. A
total of 61 Palestinians and 12 Tunisians were killed in
what Israel called a retaliation for the recent slaying
of three tourists in Cyprus. However, the White
House also issued a statement describing the bomb
ing as an understandable "expression of self
defense."
Although the apology was a notable improvement
over the intial U.S. condolence of the Israeli air
strike, the ambiguity of the accompanying state
ment is just that — ambiguous. Secretary of State
George Shultz was right when he demanded,
"Enough to the violence in the Middle East." But
that demand should be directed to all parties of the
conflict, including Israel.
The history of Israel and the Jewish community is
one of pain, suffering and violence. While those suf
ferings evoke the sympathy of us all, the Israeli
bombing of Tunisia with American-made F-15 jet
fighters evokes sympathy only for the killed and
wounded.
The fact that these weapons are American-made

reveals our indirect responsibility for the tragedy.
The Reagan Administration has approved arms
sales to Israelis as well as to some of the Arab
states — the most recent being the nearly $2 billion
in advanced arms to Jordan. Many countries are de
pendent on the United States for arms and for eco
nomic aid. We should not be afraid to use what
leverage we have as a supplier nation to demand a
halt to the cycle of Middle East violence.
We should also push for peaceful negotiations be
tween and among states and factions.
King Hussein of Jordan and Prime Minister
Shimon Peres of Israel have expressed a willingness
to participate in negotiations with Palestinians in or
der to end the violence; others, like Israeli Foreign
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, continued to oppose
negotiations. We should be prepared to move
quickly should the opportunity to negotiate arise.
While the Reagan Administration appears to be
genuinely apologetic about the tragedy in Tunisia,
the United States still abstained from the U.N. Se
curity Council's condemnation of the bombing. All
violence should be unambiguously condemned. In
the words of President Reagan, "Armed struggle
has solved nothing."
