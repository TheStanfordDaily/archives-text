## The 						Honor Code No Longer Applies 
### 
Well, the Psychology 1 cheating
case has demonstrated once again
what a joke the Stanford Honor
Code is. Just as a currency is only
as good as the government backing
it, so an honor code is only as good
as the people behind it.

VIEWPOINT

The Daily (Oct. 2) has consider
able gall in placing a portion of the
blame for this case on Prof. Phillip
Zimbardo and his TAs. This is sadly
reminiscent of the attitude — for
tunately now in disfavor — that a
victim of rape is somehow partly to
blame for her fate.
The Daily writes, "Cheating is

the most heinous school-related of
fense a student can commit, but
students can do without the
temptations that close-quartered
multiple-choice tests and chaotic
test conditions present."
An analogous and equally absurd
statement is, "Rape is one of the
most heinous violent crimes a per
son can commit, but men can do
without the temptations that
provocatively dressed lone women
present."

The concept of personal honor
and integrity does not mean much
when there is no opportunity for
dishonorable action, and I do not
mean just easy opportunity as per

haps existed in Psych 1. An implicit
part of the Honor Code is the stu
dents' agreement that, "although
we could cheat, we hereby state
that we will not. In return, we ex
pect to be treated as honorable
people by the faculty."
The Daily argues that the crowd
ing and the nature of the tests in
Psych 1 created undue temptation
for students to cheat, and thus con
stitute a violation of the Honor
Code on Zimbardo's part. I assert
that failure to proctor exams in and
of itself creates temptations to
cheat. Of course, this results in a
dilemma, since it seems that the
Honor Code simultaneously re
quires and forbids proctoring.

The solution? Simple. Trash the
Honor Code. Who does it benefit,
really? Well, it certainly benefits
cheaters, since the provision
against proctoring makes it much
easier for them. And I suppose it
gives the rest of us an ego boost in
that we feel trusted and filled to
overflowing with integrity, honor
and wholesomeness. But it seems
to me that truly trustworthy people
do not need to sign pieces of paper
asserting their integrity, and dis
honest people will be dishonest
whether or not they sign statements
proclaiming their trustworthiness.
