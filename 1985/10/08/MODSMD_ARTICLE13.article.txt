# Need To Limit Strategic Defense Initiative
## 
### 
As the November summit meeting between
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gor
bachev approaches, Reagan's controversial Stra
tegic Defense Initiative (SDI) looms as the most
critical issue in the arms control process.
The "Star Wars" program, as SDI is com
monly referred to, seeks to develop a defensive
shield against nuclear attack. Although it is still in
the research stage, Reagan believes SDI will
eventually provide the solution to today's nuclear
dilemma. "We're talking about a weapon that
won't kill people," Reagan has commented. "It'll
kill weapons."

Soviet leaders label the program destabilizing.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assem
bly late last month, Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze accused the United States
of attempting to construct a missile defense in
order to gain nuclear supremacy. However,
Shevardnadze pledged that the Soviet Union
"would not allow the other side to obtain nuclear
superiority and would take appropriate counter
measures to restore the balance."
In order to halt further development of "Star
Wars," the Soviet Union has promised drastic
cuts in its nuclear arsenal. "We believe,"
Shevardnadze said, "that agreement to ban
space-strike weapons and to effect truly radical
reductions in nuclear arms would today have the
most positive effect."
The Soviet Foreign Minister, in a meeting
with President Reagan a few days after his
speach at the U.N., reportedly proposed a 50
percent reduction in the offensive nuclear weap
ons of the United States and the Soviet Union.
The Soviet offer is contingent on an end to the
SDI program.
Reagan has steadfastly refused to consider the
SDI negotiable. One Reagan adviser com
mented, "the notion that SDI was created as a
bargaining chip is misguided." After his meeting
with Shevardnadze. Reagan reiterated his deter
mination not to restrict the "Star Wars" pro
gram.
Rhetoric aside, serious questions about the
Strategic Defense Initiative remain. The non
partisan Office of Technology Assessment, in a
recent report, concluded that "a strategic

defense which could assure the survival of all or
nearly all U.S. cities in the fact of unconstrained
Soviet nuclear offensive forces does not appear
feasible."
Flora Lewis, a columnist for The New York
Times, reports that not even the researchers at
the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories, the cen
ter for SDI research, "accept Mr. Reagan's vi
sion of a defense that will end the nuclear era."
Furthermore, system architecture — the com
piling of diverse inventions in such a way as to ef
fect a shield against a nuclear attack — is not
"yet a gleam in their (the experts) eye."
Finally, analysts with the Office of Technology
Assessment predicted that Soviet efforts to
counter a defensive system might be achieved
faster and at lower costs than the devising of the
missile shield itself.
The United States has three options concern
ing SDI; the president can either 1) agree to a
termination of "Star Wars" in return for deep
arms reductions, 2) ignore the Soviet warnings
and forge ahead with the space-based defensive
system or 3) arrange some form of compro
mise. And striking a bargain with the Soviet
Union affords the wisest solution to the "Star
Wars" controversy.
While it would be foolish for the United States
to place excessive confidence in the future effec
tiveness of SDI, it would be equally reckless to
terminate research and limited testing of the
system's component parts.

Striking a bargain with the
Soviet Union affords the
wisest solution to the
'Star Wars' controversy.

Firstly, research on a missile defense system
might very well yield successful results. While it
is unlikely that a foolproof system will ever be
devised, most experts agree that some mix of
offensive and defensive weapons will provide the
safest and most stable condition for nuclear co
existence.
Also, the role of psychological deterrence
must be appraised. It does not require much in
sight to realize that the Soviet Union is scared of
the possibilities for nuclear superiority that SDI
engenders. If they considered the program in
feasible, they would not seek its termination.
Why stop your opponent from diverting precious
funds to a useless endeavor?
Whether or not "Star Wars" will provide a
missile defense is immaterial from the point of

view of psychological deterrence. That the
Soviets think it might succeed is essential. Fear
of SDI will induce caution in Russian nuclear
strategy. Yet, fear only works as a deterrence in
low levels. For example, a rabbit subjected to
medicai experimentation is likely to react in an
unpredictable, reflexive manner if a needle is
poised only inches away from his body. Yet if the
needle is placed on a table several feet from the
rabbit, but within the creature's view, he will
agitate for only a short while before resigning
himself to tentative observation. Indeed, the
conditioned fear of the needle will induce a cer
tain caution in the animal's actions. If the Soviets
are as jittery of "Star Wars" as their words and
actions indicate, then continuance of the pro
gram at its current pace will lead to a renewal of
the arms race. If the United States restricts
testing of SDI, however, the issue will no longer
be of pressing concern to the Soviets. But as
long as they know there is the possibility of
future breakthrough on missile defense, they will
act with a certain prudence in approaching arms
control issues.
The United States has to practice resolve in
arms talks and in the upcoming summit meeting.
American negotiators must not hastily agree to
restrict Reagan's initiative. Concrete proposals
need to be put forth by the Soviet Union before
"Star Wars" is discussed. And no treaty should
be concluded that does not include deep reduc
tions in warheads and land-based missiles. A
reasonable plan would be to ban deployment and
all but rudimentary testing of SDI research in
return for a pact reducing Soviet and American
arsenals by a moderate 30 to 40 percent.
The United States must make it perfectly
clear that if the U.S.S.R. balks at compromise
and instead threatens a massive weapons
build-up, then America will match the Soviet out
put missile for missile. The United States must
be neither deluded nor bullied into entering into a
treaty.
It will be years before "Star Wars" will be
ready to leave the drawing board. Restrictions in
testing should not significantly hinder the pro
gram. If by the time any new arms pact runs out,
considerable advance has been made to merit in
creased testing then, and only then, should the
impact of a defensive shield be discussed.
The time is ripe for compromise. The Soviet
Union will most certainly agree to arms reduc
tion in return for a curtailment of the "Star Wars"
program. By agreeing to limits on his Strategic
Defense Initiative, President Reagan would be
able to enhance security in the present, without
sacrificing the future benefits of missile defense.
