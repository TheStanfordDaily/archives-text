## Need for Efficient Room Scheduling 
### 
It has always struck us as ironic
that a university in the heart of
Silicon Valley should have difficulty
with simple bureaucratic tasks.
Room scheduling is the latest ex
ample. Students and TAs have
been wondering, wandering and
meeting outside. This is not to
attack the overwhelmed efforts of
those in Room Scheduling, but to
point to the underlying structural
problem: the lack of resources for
room scheduling. Stanford must
simply devote the resources ne
cessary to ensure a smooth and
painless assignment of rooms for
class sections. Otherwise the
things that matter most will be at
the mercy of the things that matter
least.

will I lose my job? Will the Univer
sity pay my salary or increase my
financial aid? Or will I be left to
fend for myself?
I don't understand why there is
no agreement. I feel that it is the
obligation of the University to
answer my questions and the ques
tions of others. An educational
forum such as the one proposed by
Senator van Loben Sels would be
an excellent opportunity for the
University to disclose its position
in this matter.
