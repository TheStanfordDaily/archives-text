# Stanford Presents Negotiating Stand
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
Claiming that the United Stanford Workers
union is still "in the stratosphere" in its negotia
tions with the University, Stanford Labor Coun
sel and chief negotiator Priscilla Wheeler said last
night, "The union's requests are not reasonable
given the economic reality."
Wheeler's comments came during an open
presentation held with Felix Barthelemy, Uni
versity manager of employee relations, in the
Soto lounge. The two representatives of the
University's position in the ongoing contract
negotiations touched on a number of issues
related to the talks and answered questions from
an audience of 25.
Wheeler stressed throughout the hour-long
discussion that in the process of negotiating, the
University must be careful not to compromise its

duty as an educational institution and must work
within the parameters imposed by limited finan
cial resources.
"I suppose if we took all of the endowments
that are unrestricted, we could meet almost any
demand, but we do have to manage our endow
ment, fund education and fund research â€” that's
what Stanford is all about," Wheeler said, point
ing out what the University believes to be unrea
sonable union demands concerning job security,
the University's right to hire temporary, non
union workers and the union's call for increased
pension benefits.
The University "wants to give students jobs
and keep research going (despite) the Adminis
tration in Washington" which has steadily
decreased the amount of federal money given as
research grants, Wheeler said.
She criticized two original USW demands that
have recently been dropped: that students only

be allowed to hold University jobs directly
related to their academic pursuits, and that if any
appropriate work involved in research exists, it
be given to union members regardless of fund
ing.
Wheeler added that the University wants to
satisfy its employees. "No intelligent employer
wants an unhappy and underpaid work force,"
she said.
The basic source of disagreement can be sum
marized by quoting the early 20th century Amer
ican union advocate Samuel Gompers, who said
that every union simply wants "more," Wheeler
explained.
"But what's unusual about these negotiations
is that we were far away from agreement when
the contract ran out and we're still that far
apart," Wheeler said.
