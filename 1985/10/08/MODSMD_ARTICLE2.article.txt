# Stanford Presents Negotiating Stand
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
Claiming that the United Stanford Workers
union is still "in the stratosphere" in its negotia
tions with the University, Stanford Labor Coun
sel and chief negotiator Priscilla Wheeler said last
night, "The union's requests are not reasonable
given the economic reality."
Wheeler's comments came during an open
presentation held with Felix Barthelemy, Uni
versity manager of employee relations, in the
Soto lounge. The two representatives of the
University's position in the ongoing contract
negotiations touched on a number of issues
related to the talks and answered questions from
an audience of 25.
Wheeler stressed throughout the hour-long
discussion that in the process of negotiating, the
University must be careful not to compromise its

duty as an educational institution and must work
within the parameters imposed by limited finan
cial resources.
"I suppose if we took all of the endowments
that are unrestricted, we could meet almost any
demand, but we do have to manage our endow
ment, fund education and fund research â€” that's
what Stanford is all about," Wheeler said, point
ing out what the University believes to be unrea
sonable union demands concerning job security,
the University's right to hire temporary, non
union workers and the union's call for increased
pension benefits.
The University "wants to give students jobs
and keep research going (despite) the Adminis
tration in Washington" which has steadily
decreased the amount of federal money given as
research grants, Wheeler said.
She criticized two original USW demands that
have recently been dropped: that students only

be allowed to hold University jobs directly
related to their academic pursuits, and that if any
appropriate work involved in research exists, it
be given to union members regardless of fund
ing.
Wheeler added that the University wants to
satisfy its employees. "No intelligent employer
wants an unhappy and underpaid work force,"
she said.
The basic source of disagreement can be sum
marized by quoting the early 20th century Amer
ican union advocate Samuel Gompers, who said
that every union simply wants "more," Wheeler
explained.
"But what's unusual about these negotiations
is that we were far away from agreement when
the contract ran out and we're still that far
apart," Wheeler said.
The 1,350-member union has
been working without a contract
since its former agreement expired
Aug. 31. Although the union has
received authorization from the na
tional labor organization to call a
strike vote, there has been no talk
of a strike during the negotiations,
according to Wheeler.
"The last thing we want is a
strike," Wheeler said. "We hope
that they won't call it, but that's
their biggest weapon."
Wheeler added that the Univer
sity is not trying to break the union,
as USW has charged.
In response to criticism that the
University is not informing the stu
dents about the negotiations by
releasing more information or hold
ing a public forum, Wheeler said, "I
regard anything that takes away
from the negotiations as mis
directed.
"We cannot negotiate in public.
Exchanging debate rhetoric does
not help the process, but we'll try
to keep students informed."
Both USW and the University
have released press statements to
the student body refuting the
other's position on the contract
negotiations.
