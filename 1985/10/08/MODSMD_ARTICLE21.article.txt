## Don't Give any Lip, Try a Sniffle Ridge 
### ANDREW McCLUNG 
Hi folks.
How are you? I hope you are enjoying your day (as
best you can). I further and even more emphatically
hope that you will send in more questions.
Not that I wish to appear greedy, but it does make
things go a little smoother here in The Daily offices
when I have a plethora of choices.
My editorial overlords are, after all, a rather tyranni
cally overbearing lot; any of you dear people who know
them cannot need to be convinced of this. Just look at
their names. Their faces belong on post office walls.
They're beasts.
So have a heart (but not mine, thank you) and send
in masses of prose punctuated chiefly with these:
"????."
What is the ncone of the groove that runs vertically be
tween the nose and upper lip? I knew it once, but neither
friends nor "Gray's Anatomy" have proved helpful, which
I find distressing. This is vital to my sanity and daily
well-being. — Katie Knopoff
Dr. Seung Kim of the Department of Plastic and
Reconstructive Surgery was generous enough to take
time out from his diurnal labors and tell me the name of
that curious structure.
No, it's not clinically known as a Cupid's bow, as the
department's receptionist suggested.
Nor is it a sniffle-ridge, a term invented for the
Sniglets episodes on HBO's "Not Necessarily The
News."
And it is certainly not any of the thousands of utterly
repulsive things suggested by a random sample of
Stanford students.
What that groove is, to a person who makes it his art
and livelihood to use extremely sharp knives to alter its
shape, is a philtral dimple. And the two ridges which
delineate it are called, sensibly enough, philtral ridges.
Why is this? Because the whole ensemble is clinically
referred to as the philtrum.
And, fascinatingly, that appellation is derived from
the same root as the word philter ("love potion"). They
both ultimately come from the Greek philtron, from
philos, meaning "loving".
You may already be aware that the philtrum is often
indirectly involved in "the physical act of love" (as Gen.
Jack D. Ripper put it), hence the name.
But what you probably didn't know is that this word
appears on the same page of Webster's Third New In
ternational Dictionary as "phlegm" and "phlebitis",
words which are not usually associated with loving sen
timents or actions.
Why do so many people not wash their hands after
using the bathroom? Didn't their mommies teach them
right? What are the many diseases that can be transmit
ted by these people who have no concern for others?
—I.M. Pissed
I have to confess that I think that the people at the
medical center (Chad Everett among them) must be
getting pretty sick of my calling them up and asking
them these questions, and if I'm right, then they should
just make that clear and tell me to get lost.
Of course, I realize that most people don't want to

be bothered on Friday night (which is, quite naturally,
when I placed a call to one of the labs in the Infectious
Diseases Department since my deadline is Sunday)
with this sort of thing, but la-dee-da, I did it anyway,
with arrogance and relative impunity.
And boy do I feel guilty now.
But anyway, the med student who was toiling away
in the lab refrained from urging me to print his name,
but good-naturedly consented to disseminate the
needed information. Yes indeed, just as you and I
suspected, it is feasible to contract all sorts of infec
tious diseases from bathroom-users of a less than fas
tidious ilk.

In fact, one can contract hepatitis A from those who
come in contact with the fecal matter of persons so af
flicted, particularly if some trace of aforesaid feces gets
mingled with one's food. Parasitic worms can be trans
mitted in a similar fashion.
In high school biology, they told us that something
like one-third of the world's population was infected
with some sort of parasitic worm, be they tapeworms,
nematodes, liver flukes or what have you. This statis
tic does not apply to the United States as a whole, but
maybe it will pretty soon if you otherwise nice folks
don't get going and START WASHING YOUR
HANDS.
Also, there is the herpes simplex problem. You see,
even someone who is relatively hygenic, but is suffer
ing an outbreak of this type of virus and greets you
with a handshake, can leave you a lifetime present if
you have any little cuts on your hand.
But transmitting herpes that way would require
haste and effort on the part of the transmitter. It might
be better to go ahead and have sex with them, and
save them all that extra trouble.
You might want to keep in mind that all of these are
worst-case scenarios with many necessary conditions
to be fulfilled before anyone contracts anything.

And you'll notice that I didn't say much about urine.
That's because the fellow in the lab said that the main
health threat from non-hand washers was from feces
related diseases and from those affiliated with genital
contact. Urine, by comparison, is fairly safe stuff.
And one more thing: don't bother worrying too much
about touching the handle on the towel dispenser or
the knobs on the faucets, because for the most part
you need to be in contact with the people who didn't
wash their hands to catch the aforementioned serious
things from them.
In other words, appliances don't transmit diseases,
people do. So stop appliance control legislation now.

As a nouveau Californian with a terrible dread of The
Big One, I would like to know how much of the campus
was destroyed in the 1906 earthquake and whether it has
been damaged by any subsequent ones. — Kimberly
Marten
It happens to be pretty difficult to find actual reports
of the extent of damage due to the 1906 tremor, but
graphic illustrations abound.
The destruction was very severe, and if you want to
see for yourself, skip on over to the John A. Blume
Earthquake Center or the University Archives, both of
which have extensive photographic records of the
leveled Stanford campus.
The Archives staff is incredibly helpful, and you'll get
to see pictures of the following: Memorial Church, the
cupola of which crashed straight down to the ground; a
statue of the Swiss-American zoologist Louis Agassiz
that plunged head first into the ground; and the stone
gate that now serves as the entrance to Palm Drive in
its original and crumbled states.
It's all very interesting, but it doesn't exactly tell you
which buildings were damaged to what extent. This
may be just as well, since what you are probably more
interested in is the level of damage that would be sus
tained by the buildings that are on campus right now.

Taking the liberty of making just that assumption, I
called Civil Engineering Prof. Anne Kiremidjian, who
kindly gave me a synopsis of the probable reaction of
campus buidings to that upcoming day when there's "a
whole lotta shakin' goin' on."
It is her contention that Stanford has been very con
scientious about earthquake planning. Practically all of
the newer buildings (Green Library, Tresidder,
Governor's Corner and the like) were constructed ac
cording to codes designed to enable them to withstand
a major quake.
Some of the older buildings (especially parts of the
Quad, like History Corner, Margaret Jacks Hall and
the Sociology and Psychology Buildings) underwent
pretty thorough renovation schemes.
Their walls and foundations were structurally rein
forced so that the main threat in those buildings now is
from stuff inside that would bounce around and fall
down once a quake started. This means desks,
cabinets and bookshelves, the latter being an especially
significant problem for the libraries (where stacks tend
to behave like dominoes).
Laboratories on campus have a big problem with in
terior objects, since those objects are very often tubs
of toxic chemicals, corrosives and potentially explosive
gas tanks (which are therefore normally chained in
place).
Very old buildings, on the other hand, are not going
to be the fun places to hang out, since they will very
likely not hold up too well.
Here I'm talking about the Old Chemistry building
(which survived the 1906 quake but probably sustained
some internal damage then. These would cause big
problems real fast the next time around).
I wouldn't pick such occasions to go visit friends in
Toyon, Branner, Roble or Encina, either, but maybe
that's just me.
University medical facilities should hold up just fine,
which means the Med Center will be the happenin' place
for injured people to congregate after the quake.
The chief problem there should be internal damage
to sensitive equipment, but this building, like the rest
of the University's structures, shouldn't have to worry
about a long-term power outage since it has emer
gency generators.
The new communications system, which most
people think is a minefield for cyclists or an attempt to
bring back trench warfare, should pull through OK be
cause it is encased in relatively flexible plastic pipe.
So Stanford should survive the next big earthquake
with flair and style, grace and elan, vim and vigor and a
very crowded hospital.
But beware; don't run in or out of buildings. You
know those pretty, red, Mediterranean-style tiles on
all the roofs here?
They fall off. And when they do, they hurt if you
stand underneath them. So don't.
And don't go running into Engineering Corner or Ge
ology Corner to ask for earthquake safety tips at the
last second, because those buildings haven't been
renovated.
Instead, go to all the Earthquake Awareness Week
events that are transpiring RIGHT NOW, as you read
this, since this week is in fact Earthquake Awareness
Week.

suspected, it is feasible to contract all sorts of infec
tious diseases from bathroom-users of a less than fas
tidious ilk.

In fact, one can contract hepatitis A from those who
come in contact with the fecal matter of persons so af
flicted, particularly if some trace of aforesaid feces gets
mingled with one's food. Parasitic worms can be trans
mitted in a similar fashion.
In high school biology, they told us that something
like one-third of the world's population was infected
with some sort of parasitic worm, be they tapeworms,
nematodes, liver flukes or what have you. This statis
tic does not apply to the United States as a whole, but
maybe it will pretty soon if you otherwise nice folks
don't get going and START WASHING YOUR
HANDS.
Also, there is the herpes simplex problem. You see,
even someone who is relatively hygenic, but is suffer
ing an outbreak of this type of virus and greets you
with a handshake, can leave you a lifetime present if
you have any little cuts on your hand.
But transmitting herpes that way would require
haste and effort on the part of the transmitter. It might
be better to go ahead and have sex with them, and
save them all that extra trouble.
You might want to keep in mind that all of these are
worst-case scenarios with many necessary conditions
to be fulfilled before anyone contracts anything.

And you'll notice that I didn't say much about urine.
That's because the fellow in the lab said that the main
health threat from non-hand washers was from feces
related diseases and from those affiliated with genital
contact. Urine, by comparison, is fairly safe stuff.
And one more thing: don't bother worrying too much
about touching the handle on the towel dispenser or
the knobs on the faucets, because for the most part
you need to be in contact with the people who didn't
wash their hands to catch the aforementioned serious
things from them.
In other words, appliances don't transmit diseases,
people do. So stop appliance control legislation now.

As a nouveau Californian with a terrible dread of The
Big One, I would like to know how much of the campus
was destroyed in the 1906 earthquake and whether it has
been damaged by any subsequent ones. — Kimberly
Marten
It happens to be pretty difficult to find actual reports
of the extent of damage due to the 1906 tremor, but
graphic illustrations abound.
The destruction was very severe, and if you want to
see for yourself, skip on over to the John A. Blume
Earthquake Center or the University Archives, both of
which have extensive photographic records of the
leveled Stanford campus.
The Archives staff is incredibly helpful, and you'll get
to see pictures of the following: Memorial Church, the
cupola of which crashed straight down to the ground; a
statue of the Swiss-American zoologist Louis Agassiz
that plunged head first into the ground; and the stone
gate that now serves as the entrance to Palm Drive in
its original and crumbled states.
It's all very interesting, but it doesn't exactly tell you
which buildings were damaged to what extent. This
may be just as well, since what you are probably more
interested in is the level of damage that would be sus
tained by the buildings that are on campus right now.

Taking the liberty of making just that assumption, I
called Civil Engineering Prof. Anne Kiremidjian, who
kindly gave me a synopsis of the probable reaction of
campus buidings to that upcoming day when there's "a
whole lotta shakin' goin' on."
It is her contention that Stanford has been very con
scientious about earthquake planning. Practically all of
the newer buildings (Green Library, Tresidder,
Governor's Corner and the like) were constructed ac
cording to codes designed to enable them to withstand
a major quake.
Some of the older buildings (especially parts of the
Quad, like History Corner, Margaret Jacks Hall and
the Sociology and Psychology Buildings) underwent
pretty thorough renovation schemes.
Their walls and foundations were structurally rein
forced so that the main threat in those buildings now is
from stuff inside that would bounce around and fall
down once a quake started. This means desks,
cabinets and bookshelves, the latter being an especially
significant problem for the libraries (where stacks tend
to behave like dominoes).
Laboratories on campus have a big problem with in
terior objects, since those objects are very often tubs
of toxic chemicals, corrosives and potentially explosive
gas tanks (which are therefore normally chained in
place).
Very old buildings, on the other hand, are not going
to be the fun places to hang out, since they will very
likely not hold up too well.
Here I'm talking about the Old Chemistry building
(which survived the 1906 quake but probably sustained
some internal damage then. These would cause big
problems real fast the next time around).
I wouldn't pick such occasions to go visit friends in
Toyon, Branner, Roble or Encina, either, but maybe
that's just me.
University medical facilities should hold up just fine,
which means the Med Center will be the happenin' place
for injured people to congregate after the quake.
The chief problem there should be internal damage
to sensitive equipment, but this building, like the rest
of the University's structures, shouldn't have to worry
about a long-term power outage since it has emer
gency generators.
The new communications system, which most
people think is a minefield for cyclists or an attempt to
bring back trench warfare, should pull through OK be
cause it is encased in relatively flexible plastic pipe.
So Stanford should survive the next big earthquake
with flair and style, grace and elan, vim and vigor and a
very crowded hospital.
But beware; don't run in or out of buildings. You
know those pretty, red, Mediterranean-style tiles on
all the roofs here?
They fall off. And when they do, they hurt if you
stand underneath them. So don't.
And don't go running into Engineering Corner or Ge
ology Corner to ask for earthquake safety tips at the
last second, because those buildings haven't been
renovated.
Instead, go to all the Earthquake Awareness Week
events that are transpiring RIGHT NOW, as you read
this, since this week is in fact Earthquake Awareness
Week.
Hi folks.
How are you? I hope you are enjoying your day (as
best you can). I further and even more emphatically
hope that you will send in more questions.
Not that I wish to appear greedy, but it does make
things go a little smoother here in The Daily offices
when I have a plethora of choices.
My editorial overlords are, after all, a rather tyranni
cally overbearing lot; any of you dear people who know
them cannot need to be convinced of this. Just look at
their names. Their faces belong on post office walls.
They're beasts.
So have a heart (but not mine, thank you) and send
in masses of prose punctuated chiefly with these:
"????."
What is the ncone of the groove that runs vertically be
tween the nose and upper lip? I knew it once, but neither
friends nor "Gray's Anatomy" have proved helpful, which
I find distressing. This is vital to my sanity and daily
well-being. — Katie Knopoff
Dr. Seung Kim of the Department of Plastic and
Reconstructive Surgery was generous enough to take
time out from his diurnal labors and tell me the name of
that curious structure.
No, it's not clinically known as a Cupid's bow, as the
department's receptionist suggested.
Nor is it a sniffle-ridge, a term invented for the
Sniglets episodes on HBO's "Not Necessarily The
News."
And it is certainly not any of the thousands of utterly
repulsive things suggested by a random sample of
Stanford students.
What that groove is, to a person who makes it his art
and livelihood to use extremely sharp knives to alter its
shape, is a philtral dimple. And the two ridges which
delineate it are called, sensibly enough, philtral ridges.
Why is this? Because the whole ensemble is clinically
referred to as the philtrum.
And, fascinatingly, that appellation is derived from
the same root as the word philter ("love potion"). They
both ultimately come from the Greek philtron, from
philos, meaning "loving".
You may already be aware that the philtrum is often
indirectly involved in "the physical act of love" (as Gen.
Jack D. Ripper put it), hence the name.
But what you probably didn't know is that this word
appears on the same page of Webster's Third New In
ternational Dictionary as "phlegm" and "phlebitis",
words which are not usually associated with loving sen
timents or actions.
Why do so many people not wash their hands after
using the bathroom? Didn't their mommies teach them
right? What are the many diseases that can be transmit
ted by these people who have no concern for others?
—I.M. Pissed
I have to confess that I think that the people at the
medical center (Chad Everett among them) must be
getting pretty sick of my calling them up and asking
them these questions, and if I'm right, then they should
just make that clear and tell me to get lost.
Of course, I realize that most people don't want to

be bothered on Friday night (which is, quite naturally,
when I placed a call to one of the labs in the Infectious
Diseases Department since my deadline is Sunday)
with this sort of thing, but la-dee-da, I did it anyway,
with arrogance and relative impunity.
And boy do I feel guilty now.
But anyway, the med student who was toiling away
in the lab refrained from urging me to print his name,
but good-naturedly consented to disseminate the
needed information. Yes indeed, just as you and I
suspected, it is feasible to contract all sorts of infec
tious diseases from bathroom-users of a less than fas

the newer buildings (Green Library, Tresidder,
Governor's Corner and the like) were constructed ac
cording to codes designed to enable them to withstand
a major quake.
Some of the older buildings (especially parts of the
Quad, like History Corner, Margaret Jacks Hall and
the Sociology and Psychology Buildings) underwent
pretty thorough renovation schemes.
Their walls and foundations were structurally rein
forced so that the main threat in those buildings now is
from stuff inside that would bounce around and fall
down once a quake started. This means desks,
cabinets and bookshelves, the latter being an especially
significant problem for the libraries (where stacks tend
to behave like dominoes).
Laboratories on campus have a big problem with in
terior objects, since those objects are very often tubs
of toxic chemicals, corrosives and potentially explosive
gas tanks (which are therefore normally chained in
place).
Very old buildings, on the other hand, are not going
to be the fun places to hang out, since they will very
likely not hold up too well.
Here I'm talking about the Old Chemistry building
(which survived the 1906 quake but probably sustained
some internal damage then. These would cause big
problems real fast the next time around).
I wouldn't pick such occasions to go visit friends in
Toyon, Branner, Roble or Encina, either, but maybe
that's just me.
University medical facilities should hold up just fine,
which means the Med Center will be the happenin' place
for injured people to congregate after the quake.
The chief problem there should be internal damage
to sensitive equipment, but this building, like the rest
of the University's structures, shouldn't have to worry
about a long-term power outage since it has emer
gency generators.
The new communications system, which most
people think is a minefield for cyclists or an attempt to
bring back trench warfare, should pull through OK be
cause it is encased in relatively flexible plastic pipe.
So Stanford should survive the next big earthquake
with flair and style, grace and elan, vim and vigor and a
very crowded hospital.
But beware; don't run in or out of buildings. You
know those pretty, red, Mediterranean-style tiles on
all the roofs here?
They fall off. And when they do, they hurt if you
stand underneath them. So don't.
And don't go running into Engineering Corner or Ge
ology Corner to ask for earthquake safety tips at the
last second, because those buildings haven't been
renovated.
Instead, go to all the Earthquake Awareness Week
events that are transpiring RIGHT NOW, as you read
this, since this week is in fact Earthquake Awareness
Week.
Hi folks.
How are you? I hope you are enjoying your day (as
best you can). I further and even more emphatically
hope that you will send in more questions.
Not that I wish to appear greedy, but it does make
things go a little smoother here in The Daily offices
when I have a plethora of choices.
My editorial overlords are, after all, a rather tyranni
cally overbearing lot; any of you dear people who know
them cannot need to be convinced of this. Just look at
their names. Their faces belong on post office walls.
They're beasts.
So have a heart (but not mine, thank you) and send
in masses of prose punctuated chiefly with these:
"????."
What is the ncone of the groove that runs vertically be
tween the nose and upper lip? I knew it once, but neither
friends nor "Gray's Anatomy" have proved helpful, which
I find distressing. This is vital to my sanity and daily
well-being. — Katie Knopoff
Dr. Seung Kim of the Department of Plastic and
Reconstructive Surgery was generous enough to take
time out from his diurnal labors and tell me the name of
that curious structure.
No, it's not clinically known as a Cupid's bow, as the
department's receptionist suggested.
Nor is it a sniffle-ridge, a term invented for the
Sniglets episodes on HBO's "Not Necessarily The
News."
And it is certainly not any of the thousands of utterly
repulsive things suggested by a random sample of
Stanford students.
What that groove is, to a person who makes it his art
and livelihood to use extremely sharp knives to alter its
shape, is a philtral dimple. And the two ridges which
delineate it are called, sensibly enough, philtral ridges.
Why is this? Because the whole ensemble is clinically
referred to as the philtrum.
And, fascinatingly, that appellation is derived from
the same root as the word philter ("love potion"). They
both ultimately come from the Greek philtron, from
philos, meaning "loving".
You may already be aware that the philtrum is often
indirectly involved in "the physical act of love" (as Gen.
Jack D. Ripper put it), hence the name.
But what you probably didn't know is that this word
appears on the same page of Webster's Third New In
ternational Dictionary as "phlegm" and "phlebitis",
words which are not usually associated with loving sen
timents or actions.
Why do so many people not wash their hands after
using the bathroom? Didn't their mommies teach them
right? What are the many diseases that can be transmit
ted by these people who have no concern for others?
—I.M. Pissed
I have to confess that I think that the people at the
medical center (Chad Everett among them) must be
getting pretty sick of my calling them up and asking
them these questions, and if I'm right, then they should
just make that clear and tell me to get lost.
Of course, I realize that most people don't want to

be bothered on Friday night (which is, quite naturally,
when I placed a call to one of the labs in the Infectious
Diseases Department since my deadline is Sunday)
with this sort of thing, but la-dee-da, I did it anyway,
with arrogance and relative impunity.
And boy do I feel guilty now.
But anyway, the med student who was toiling away
in the lab refrained from urging me to print his name,
but good-naturedly consented to disseminate the
needed information. Yes indeed, just as you and I
suspected, it is feasible to contract all sorts of infec
tious diseases from bathroom-users of a less than fas
tidious ilk.

In fact, one can contract hepatitis A from those who
come in contact with the fecal matter of persons so af
flicted, particularly if some trace of aforesaid feces gets
mingled with one's food. Parasitic worms can be trans
mitted in a similar fashion.
In high school biology, they told us that something
like one-third of the world's population was infected
with some sort of parasitic worm, be they tapeworms,
nematodes, liver flukes or what have you. This statis
tic does not apply to the United States as a whole, but
maybe it will pretty soon if you otherwise nice folks
don't get going and START WASHING YOUR
HANDS.
Also, there is the herpes simplex problem. You see,
even someone who is relatively hygenic, but is suffer
ing an outbreak of this type of virus and greets you
with a handshake, can leave you a lifetime present if
you have any little cuts on your hand.
But transmitting herpes that way would require
haste and effort on the part of the transmitter. It might
be better to go ahead and have sex with them, and
save them all that extra trouble.
You might want to keep in mind that all of these are
worst-case scenarios with many necessary conditions
to be fulfilled before anyone contracts anything.

And you'll notice that I didn't say much about urine.
That's because the fellow in the lab said that the main
health threat from non-hand washers was from feces
related diseases and from those affiliated with genital
contact. Urine, by comparison, is fairly safe stuff.
And one more thing: don't bother worrying too much
about touching the handle on the towel dispenser or
the knobs on the faucets, because for the most part
you need to be in contact with the people who didn't
wash their hands to catch the aforementioned serious
things from them.
In other words, appliances don't transmit diseases,
people do. So stop appliance control legislation now.

As a nouveau Californian with a terrible dread of The
Big One, I would like to know how much of the campus
was destroyed in the 1906 earthquake and whether it has
been damaged by any subsequent ones. — Kimberly
Marten
It happens to be pretty difficult to find actual reports
of the extent of damage due to the 1906 tremor, but
graphic illustrations abound.
The destruction was very severe, and if you want to
see for yourself, skip on over to the John A. Blume
Earthquake Center or the University Archives, both of
which have extensive photographic records of the
leveled Stanford campus.
The Archives staff is incredibly helpful, and you'll get
to see pictures of the following: Memorial Church, the
cupola of which crashed straight down to the ground; a
statue of the Swiss-American zoologist Louis Agassiz
that plunged head first into the ground; and the stone
gate that now serves as the entrance to Palm Drive in
its original and crumbled states.
It's all very interesting, but it doesn't exactly tell you
which buildings were damaged to what extent. This
may be just as well, since what you are probably more
interested in is the level of damage that would be sus
tained by the buildings that are on campus right now.

Taking the liberty of making just that assumption, I
called Civil Engineering Prof. Anne Kiremidjian, who
kindly gave me a synopsis of the probable reaction of
campus buidings to that upcoming day when there's "a
whole lotta shakin' goin' on."
It is her contention that Stanford has been very con
scientious about earthquake planning. Practically all of
the newer buildings (Green Library, Tresidder,
Governor's Corner and the like) were constructed ac
cording to codes designed to enable them to withstand
