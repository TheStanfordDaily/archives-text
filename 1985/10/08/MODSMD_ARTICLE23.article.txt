## Art Museum Exhibit: Fine Prints and Drawings 
### MARK TOMPKINS 
"Surely, engravers have been the heralds and trum
peters of the greatest painters and spokesmen who
proclaim to us the artist's fame."
This statement, from a 17th century Dutch artist,
opens a major new exhibit at the Stanford Museum of
Art and provides a key to appreciating the work pre
sented therein. The exhibition, entitled "Goltzius to
Rembrandt: Dutch and Flemish Prints and Drawings,"
features over 80 works from the 17th century, and
these works are separated into five basic categories.
Allegorical and religious images are given ample space;
also displayed are various examples of portraiture,
landscapes and genre pictures that depict peasant life.
Those who attend this exhibit hoping to be over
whelmed by Rembrandt's painting genius will be disap
pointed, for there is only one painting in the show, and
it is not by him. The work here instead consists of
small etchings and engravings, primarily in black-and
white, although there are a few tinted works. Once the
viewer adjusts to the scale and the medium, however,
he will see that this collection features a wealth of
striking material. Connoisseurs of fine line work will be
especially delighted by these pictures.
The exhibition opens with the work of Henrik
Goltzius (1558-1616), a Dutch artist whose efforts
were extremely popular during his own lifetime, both
in Holland and Italy. Goltzius's work draws heavily on
mythology and biblical lore for its subject matter, like
nearly all of the art produced at the time. His work is
highly mannered, as the 1588 engraving "Tantalus"
shows: the musculature is very exaggerated, in the
celebrated Michelangelo style. There is still much to
admire in Goltzius's work, though, particularly the way
in which tone is gradually and expertly built up,
through masses of short strokes. The vast amounts of
hatching and cross-hatching found in these engravings
gives each image depth, and the sense of a real pres
ence typical of all great figure drawings.
Goltzius' work, along with many other engravings
have, has a crowded, dense feel to it: One gets the im
pression that the artist dreaded white space, and felt

that they had to cram line work into every square inch
of their prints. Rembrandt's work is entirely
different. His masterful economy of line allows for a
bright, open quality to filter through his pictures. His
1648 etching, "Landscape with a Cottage by a Large
Tree," provides an excellent example of this quality.
After the earlier prints by Goltzius and others, with
their hectic, multi-layered line work, this Rembrandt
comes as a liberation, as a revelation. Nearly all of the
right side of the picture, showing the sky and a field, is

blank white space; there is very little shading at all.
The value of this technique is that it gives the overall
image a more stark, three-dimensional quality.
Rembrandt's work is as notable for its content as its
form. His best work depicts a solitary dialogue with
God; he found an eternal power in early Judaic sub
jects. And yet, his biblical heroes are not distant, om
nipotent figures, but eminently real human beings.
Rembrandt had no interest in the church of his own
day; his disdain for contemporary Christianity neatly

dovetailed with the artistic trends of his time, for
during the 17th century secular themes came to the
fore in art.
The supplanting of religious art by portraits, genre
subjects and landscapes can be attributed to the his
torical rise of the bourgeoisie throughout Europe.
Prosperous traders and merchants, the nouveau riche,
were on the rise everywhere, and they wanted to in-

vest their money in art; in particular they wanted
portraits of themselves. All of this can be seen in the
Stanford Museum exhibit as religiously based works
give way to mezzotints and engravings featuring more
down-to-earth subjects. One piece in this section
stands out in particular: Jan De Baen's "The Burning of
the Amsterdam Town Hall" (1652) is a record of an ac
tual historical event, in contrast to the more placid
landscapes around it.
In short, this exhibit is enjoyable on several different
levels. Rembrandt's pieces can be seen as test runs for
his magnificent paintings; his prints are indeed the
"heralds anc umpeters" of his fame and brilliance.
And all of the ocher works can be admired for their ex
cellent linework, which has lost nothing with the pass
ing of time. Moreover, the collection can be appreci
ated as a sort of historical analogy for the shifting
tastes of the 17th century.
This exhibit will run at the Stanford University
Museum of Art until Dec. 29; admission is free. The
museum is open Tuesday through Friday 10 a.m. to 5
p.m., Saturday and Sunday 1 to 5 p.m. Special group
tours can be arranged by calling 497-3469.

viewer adjusts to the scale and the medium, however,
he will see that this collection features a wealth of
striking material. Connoisseurs of fine line work will be
especially delighted by these pictures.
The exhibition opens with the work of Henrik
Goltzius (1558-1616), a Dutch artist whose efforts
were extremely popular during his own lifetime, both
in Holland and Italy. Goltzius's work draws heavily on
mythology and biblical lore for its subject matter, like
nearly all of the art produced at the time. His work is
highly mannered, as the 1588 engraving "Tantalus"
shows: the musculature is very exaggerated, in the
celebrated Michelangelo style. There is still much to
admire in Goltzius's work, though, particularly the way
in which tone is gradually and expertly built up,
through masses of short strokes. The vast amounts of
hatching and cross-hatching found in these engravings
gives each image depth, and the sense of a real pres
ence typical of all great figure drawings.
Goltzius' work, along with many other engravings
have, has a crowded, dense feel to it: One gets the im
pression that the artist dreaded white space, and felt

that they had to cram line work into every square inch
of their prints. Rembrandt's work is entirely
different. His masterful economy of line allows for a
bright, open quality to filter through his pictures. His
1648 etching, "Landscape with a Cottage by a Large
Tree," provides an excellent example of this quality.
After the earlier prints by Goltzius and others, with
their hectic, multi-layered line work, this Rembrandt
comes as a liberation, as a revelation. Nearly all of the
right side of the picture, showing the sky and a field, is

blank white space; there is very little shading at all.
The value of this technique is that it gives the overall
image a more stark, three-dimensional quality.
Rembrandt's work is as notable for its content as its
form. His best work depicts a solitary dialogue with
God; he found an eternal power in early Judaic sub
jects. And yet, his biblical heroes are not distant, om
nipotent figures, but eminently real human beings.
Rembrandt had no interest in the church of his own
day; his disdain for contemporary Christianity neatly

dovetailed with the artistic trends of his time, for
during the 17th century secular themes came to the
fore in art.
The supplanting of religious art by portraits, genre
subjects and landscapes can be attributed to the his
torical rise of the bourgeoisie throughout Europe.
Prosperous traders and merchants, the nouveau riche,
were on the rise everywhere, and they wanted to in-

vest their money in art; in particular they wanted
portraits of themselves. All of this can be seen in the
Stanford Museum exhibit as religiously based works
give way to mezzotints and engravings featuring more
down-to-earth subjects. One piece in this section
stands out in particular: Jan De Baen's "The Burning of
the Amsterdam Town Hall" (1652) is a record of an ac
tual historical event, in contrast to the more placid
landscapes around it.
In short, this exhibit is enjoyable on several different
levels. Rembrandt's pieces can be seen as test runs for
his magnificent paintings; his prints are indeed the
"heralds anc umpeters" of his fame and brilliance.
And all of the ocher works can be admired for their ex
cellent linework, which has lost nothing with the pass
ing of time. Moreover, the collection can be appreci
ated as a sort of historical analogy for the shifting
tastes of the 17th century.
This exhibit will run at the Stanford University
Museum of Art until Dec. 29; admission is free. The
museum is open Tuesday through Friday 10 a.m. to 5
p.m., Saturday and Sunday 1 to 5 p.m. Special group
tours can be arranged by calling 497-3469.


"View of Canal and Outer Walls of Utrecht," a watercolor over black chalk by Herman Saftleven
(1609-1685), on view at the Stanford Art Museum's current exhibit: "Goltzius to Rembrandt:
Dutch and Flemish Prints and Drawings."
"Surely, engravers have been the heralds and trum
peters of the greatest painters and spokesmen who
proclaim to us the artist's fame."
This statement, from a 17th century Dutch artist,
opens a major new exhibit at the Stanford Museum of
Art and provides a key to appreciating the work pre
sented therein. The exhibition, entitled "Goltzius to
Rembrandt: Dutch and Flemish Prints and Drawings,"
features over 80 works from the 17th century, and
these works are separated into five basic categories.
Allegorical and religious images are given ample space;
also displayed are various examples of portraiture,
landscapes and genre pictures that depict peasant life.
Those who attend this exhibit hoping to be over
whelmed by Rembrandt's painting genius will be disap
pointed, for there is only one painting in the show, and
it is not by him. The work here instead consists of
small etchings and engravings, primarily in black-and
white, although there are a few tinted works. Once the
viewer adjusts to the scale and the medium, however,
he will see that this collection features a wealth of
striking material. Connoisseurs of fine line work will be
