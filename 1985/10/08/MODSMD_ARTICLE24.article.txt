# 'Shooting Party' Offers Flawed Entertainment
## 
### GEOFFREY MINTER 
There's an old joke that goes kind of like this: An
old, deaf man asks a hunter what he's shooting at, and
the hunter replies, "Pheasants." Appalled, the old man
turns to the hunter and says, "Peasants? Don't you
think they have enough problems already?" Ha, ha, ha.
Alan Bridge's "The Shooting Party" is a tasteful, but
flawed extension of this joke. Set in England just
before the outbreak of World War I, the film shows
what happens to an upper-class group of people during
one of their lavish private functions.
The function, held by the venerable Sir Randolph
Nettleby Games Mason, in his final screen appear
ance), is a continuous flow of meals and high-brow en
tertainments interrupted every morning by a bird
shooting event: all the men gather and try to kill as
many pheasants, pigeons, quail, etc. as they can with
the help of their lower-class shotgun caddies.
Nettleby allows the bird-shooting because it's good
sport, but doesn't want the event to become a contest.
Unknown to him, however, competition already exists
between Lord Gilbert Hartlip (Edward Fox, who
seems destined to play snobs all his life) and Lionel
Stephens (Rupert Fisher), a young, handsome lawyer
who is also a pretty mean shot.
As we soon discover, bird shooting isn't the only
sport making the rounds at the Nettleby function.

Stephens has his eye on Lady Olivia Lilburn Oudi Bow
ker), a sensible woman who detests the idea of killing
birds and who's beginning to get tired of living the high
life. Stephens and Lady Olivia carry on nobly behind
Lord Lilburn's back, which is O.K. since he's such an
old fuddy-dud anyway. When Lady Olivia asks him if he
ever had the desire to talk with intelligent and interest
ing people out of his social circle, Lord Lilburn replies
that he wouldn't because he would have nothing in
common with them.
Meanwhile, Lady Aline Hartlip is carrying on not-so
nobly behind Lord Hartlip's back with a mysterious
count who has a great accent.
The movie begins and ends with the same scene: a
long shot showing a group of people walking single-file
from the lower right side of the screen to the upper
left. Clouds billow in from the left, implying that the
people are being shepherded blindly into some sort of
stormy conflict (no doubt World War I) over which they
have no control. Bridge's frame implies that his film will
show how the people lost control, how they blinded
themselves to the problems their world faced. The film
does this quite nicely and would have been a very good
picture if it did only this, but "The Shooting Party" is
bogged down by the director's need to interlace his so
cial commentary with romance. Although it doesn't to
tally ruin the picture, the romance adds nothing impor
tant and takes up too much time.
