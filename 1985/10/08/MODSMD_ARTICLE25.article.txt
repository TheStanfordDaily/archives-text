# 'Maxie': Nothing To Offer
## 
### GREG WATKINS Staff writer 
The more I think about the movie
"Maxie," the more amazed I am
that such a movie even exists.
Falling under that lovable cate
gory of "fun for the whole family,"

Maxie' is the height of profes
sionalism; it is talent-filled, well
done silliness that has left my aes
thetic sensibilities dishevelled.

this movie is something of a
crossbreed between "Freaky
Friday" and "All of Me." It is
precisely this cross that makes
"Maxie" so unnerving: it is neither a
cute, adolescent comedy for a

weekend matinee, nor a medium
for the comic talents of a Steve
Martin or a Lily Tomlin — enter
tainers who serve as the justifica
tion for productions in which the
personalities are the production.
"Maxie," however, is the height
of professionalism; it is talent-filled,
well-done silliness that leaves my

aesthetic sensibilities dishevelled.
The plot revolves around the fol
lowing: the spirit of a flamboyant
flapper from the '20s (Maxie)
Malone) possesses the body of a
mild-mannered, archbishop's secre

tary. Maxie's intention is to revive
her former, uninhibited lifestyle.
She crashes a party important to
the career of Nick, husband of the
body she frequents. In the process,
she captivates the embarrassed
Nick, transforming his fascination
into affection.
The plot plays with the
threesome for awhile, focusing on
Nick's attempts to remain faithful to
his wife and not just her body. The
dual role of Maxie/Jan is aptly
played by Glenn Close, although I
found the role entirely unsuited to
her.
Finally, we find out that Maxie
really wants another chance at be
coming a Hollywood movie star, a
chance cut short during her earthly
existence by a deadly car wreck on
her way to a "big" Hollywood
screening. Therein lies the con
cept, as they say in the entertain
ment industry, behind this
lighthearted movie. And such is the
challenge facing the film critic who
writes about a film like "Maxie."
Film criticism rests in synopsis
and informed opinion, but only
becomes serious criticism in bring
ing something to a creative work
that goes beyond the presentation:
to reveal its ideas and creativity, to
contextualize it historically and
within its genre, to help it say
something it can never say just as
art. Art is rarely, if ever, sufficient
in itself.
The critic, therefore, cannot be
just one opinionated viewer among
many (indeed, all viewers have
some opinion about every film) or
an interested spectator who hap
pens to have access to the printed
media and the ability to coherently
express an opinion. Rather, the
critic must have an interest in
making a piece of art something
more than the experience of it. The
critic must, in a sense, complete
art. Optimally, the essay of the
critic involves not just opinion, but a
particular kind of opinion, evidence
of thinking "occasioned by" a crea
tive work.
If you are looking for a simple
review of "Maxie," read the follow
ing and then get on with your
paper: Don't go see "Maxie." Not
that it is a terrible production. You
will be able to sit through it; it may
even amuse you. But there are
enough movies in circulation so
much more worthwhile, that at
tending "Maxie" would be an inex

cusable waste of time.
As for criticism, the fact that the
content of the movie offers nothing
thought-provoking, self-conscious,
daring or in any way engaging
precludes criticism as discussed
above. Perhaps we could learn

something about ourselves and our
culture, analyze the movie in some
kind of sociological way. But that
would hardly be worth the effort; it
would be forced and unproductive.
The enigma remains: How and why
did "Maxie" come to be?


Glenn Close has a dual role as a ghost trying to relive her
former life in someone else's body. Mandy Patinkin is the new
man in her new life in the movie "Maxie."

review of "Maxie," read the follow
ing and then get on with your
paper: Don't go see "Maxie." Not
that it is a terrible production. You
will be able to sit through it; it may
even amuse you. But there are
enough movies in circulation so
much more worthwhile, that at
tending "Maxie" would be an inex

cusable waste of time.
As for criticism, the fact that the
content of the movie offers nothing
thought-provoking, self-conscious,
daring or in any way engaging
precludes criticism as discussed
above. Perhaps we could learn

something about ourselves and our
culture, analyze the movie in some
kind of sociological way. But that
would hardly be worth the effort; it
would be forced and unproductive.
The enigma remains: How and why
did "Maxie" come to be?


Glenn Close has a dual role as a ghost trying to relive her
former life in someone else's body. Mandy Patinkin is the new
man in her new life in the movie "Maxie."
