## Spikers Survive UOP Test 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
The No. 1-ranked Stanford
women's volleyball team only occa
sionally resembled a top-ranked
team last night at Maples Pavilion,
but played well enough to
overcome its own erratic play and
defeat the University of Pacific 15-
11, 12-15, 15-10, 12-15, 15-10.
With last night's victory, the
Cardinal has now knocked off the
No. 2 (UCLA) and No. 3 teams in
the nation over the past four days.
But Cardinal Co-coach Don Shaw is
more concerned with how the team
plays, not who they defeat.
"We really didn't play that well,
but we played well enough to win,"
Shaw said. "Our concentration level
was not what it should have been."
Shaw said that the game "had its
moments but we could have played
better in certain areas."
Coming off an important, emo
tional victory over UCLA Friday
night, the Cardinal women were
primed for a letdown. "One of the
problems with the schedule is that
you don't have a chance for a let
down. It (the letdown) certainly
made it a lot harder than it could
have been tonight."
A clinic in excellent volleyball or
not, the match did provide many
outstanding and unusual plays and
was not decided until late in the fifth
game.
The match started with Cardinal
junior Brooke Hahner firing three
straight spikes past the Tiger block
to give Stanford a quick 2-0 lead.
However, unlike the UCLA match,
Stanford was unable to dominate at
the net and the first game became a
struggle for momentum.
The teams were tied at 3-3, 5-5
and 7-7 before the Cardinal women
made their move. A Wendi Rush set
evaded Nancy Reno but the ball still
found its way over the net and fell
untouched to give the Cardinal an 8-
7 advantage.
That lead increased to 11-7
before the scrappy Tigers made
several back row saves to fight
within 11-9. A UOP double-hit,
though, turned the momentum back
to Stanford and the Cardinal
captured the first game by a 15-11
score when the Tigers failed to get
the ball over the net in three hits.
Elaina Oden, the highly-touted
younger sister of Stanford's Kim
Oden, started the scoring for the
Tigers in the second game with an
ace serve. Not to be outdone,
however, Kim two plays later
blocked an attempted spike, turned
around and spiked the ball over the
net to knot the score at 1-1.
The visitors then proceeded to
take a 7-1 lead behind the hitting of
sophomore Dorothy Hert. Each
time the Cardinal got close they
made a crucial mistake, mishandling
serves and missing spikes. With

Stanford serving at 12-14, Kim
Oden hit wide on an easy spike op
portunity and at game point Hahner
knocked a spike into the net giving
the Tigers the second game, 15-12.
Trailing 1-4 in game three, the
Cardinal called on freshman Amy
Hayes to serve. Hayes, who
served exceptionally against
UCLA, once again baffled the op
ponent, serving three aces as Stan
ford scored eight straight points to
take a 9-4 lead.
The Tigers got as close as 12-9
but at that point Elaina Oden
missed two consecutive spikes,
giving the Cardinal a game point. A
few plays later, Stanford junior
Barbra Fontana made a spectacular
rejection of an attempted UOP
double block and the Cardinal had

won the third game 15-10.
At the outset of game four the
Cardinal women looked as sharp as
they did all match. Kim Oden began
the game in a resounding fashion
with a block and two kills to give the
Cardinal a 3-0 advantage. That lead
was stretched to 5-0 on a Hayes
ace and the outlook seemed dim for
the Tigers as it appeared that Stan
ford had finally found its game.
UOP turned the momentum im
mediately, however, storming back
to take a 8-7 lead on freshman
Brooke Herrington's kill. Two
Cardinal errors and an Elaina Oden
spike pushed the lead to 11-7.
The Cardinal women then
decided that it was their turn to play
well for a few points and closed to
11-10 before a Theresa Smith

serve found the net. Stanford came
within one point again at 13-12 but
when UOP's Therese Boyle
blocked a Hayes spike the Tigers
had evened the match with a 15-12
fourth-game victory.
Game five was as nip-and-tuck as
the others. With the score tied at 9-
9, the Cardinal ran off four straight
points, two coming on powerful
smashes by an excited Kim Oden.
After failing on one match point,
Stanford captured the fifth game
15-10 and stretched its season
record to 12-0 on a combined block
by Hahner and Reno.
As for the UOP team, Shaw said
that they could be very tough come
tournament time. "They've got a
lot of talent and they are young," he
said. "They'll only get better."

Stanford's women's volleyball team, ranked No. 1 nationally, spiked visiting UOP, the country's
No. 3 team, last night in Maples Pavilion. The Cardinal was powered by high-flying Barbra Fon
tana, who recorded 23 kills and a .388 hitting percentage for the evening. Stanford's triumph

ford scored eight straight points to
take a 9-4 lead.
The Tigers got as close as 12-9
but at that point Elaina Oden
missed two consecutive spikes,
giving the Cardinal a game point. A
few plays later, Stanford junior
Barbra Fontana made a spectacular
rejection of an attempted UOP
double block and the Cardinal had

won the third game 15-10.
At the outset of game four the
Cardinal women looked as sharp as
they did all match. Kim Oden began
the game in a resounding fashion
with a block and two kills to give the
Cardinal a 3-0 advantage. That lead
was stretched to 5-0 on a Hayes
ace and the outlook seemed dim for
the Tigers as it appeared that Stan
ford had finally found its game.
UOP turned the momentum im
mediately, however, storming back
to take a 8-7 lead on freshman
Brooke Herrington's kill. Two
Cardinal errors and an Elaina Oden
spike pushed the lead to 11-7.
The Cardinal women then
decided that it was their turn to play
well for a few points and closed to
11-10 before a Theresa Smith

serve found the net. Stanford came
within one point again at 13-12 but
when UOP's Therese Boyle
blocked a Hayes spike the Tigers
had evened the match with a 15-12
fourth-game victory.
Game five was as nip-and-tuck as
the others. With the score tied at 9-
9, the Cardinal ran off four straight
points, two coming on powerful
smashes by an excited Kim Oden.
After failing on one match point,
Stanford captured the fifth game
15-10 and stretched its season
record to 12-0 on a combined block
by Hahner and Reno.
As for the UOP team, Shaw said
that they could be very tough come
tournament time. "They've got a
lot of talent and they are young," he
said. "They'll only get better."

Stanford's women's volleyball team, ranked No. 1 nationally, spiked visiting UOP, the country's
No. 3 team, last night in Maples Pavilion. The Cardinal was powered by high-flying Barbra Fon
tana, who recorded 23 kills and a .388 hitting percentage for the evening. Stanford's triumph
represented the squad's second defeat of a top-five team in the space of four days.
The No. 1-ranked Stanford
women's volleyball team only occa
sionally resembled a top-ranked
team last night at Maples Pavilion,
but played well enough to
overcome its own erratic play and
defeat the University of Pacific 15-
11, 12-15, 15-10, 12-15, 15-10.
With last night's victory, the
Cardinal has now knocked off the
No. 2 (UCLA) and No. 3 teams in
the nation over the past four days.
But Cardinal Co-coach Don Shaw is
more concerned with how the team
plays, not who they defeat.
"We really didn't play that well,
but we played well enough to win,"
Shaw said. "Our concentration level
was not what it should have been."
Shaw said that the game "had its
moments but we could have played
better in certain areas."
Coming off an important, emo
tional victory over UCLA Friday
night, the Cardinal women were
primed for a letdown. "One of the
problems with the schedule is that
you don't have a chance for a let
down. It (the letdown) certainly
made it a lot harder than it could
have been tonight."
A clinic in excellent volleyball or
not, the match did provide many
outstanding and unusual plays and
was not decided until late in the fifth
game.
The match started with Cardinal
junior Brooke Hahner firing three
straight spikes past the Tiger block
to give Stanford a quick 2-0 lead.
However, unlike the UCLA match,
Stanford was unable to dominate at
the net and the first game became a
struggle for momentum.
The teams were tied at 3-3, 5-5
and 7-7 before the Cardinal women
made their move. A Wendi Rush set
evaded Nancy Reno but the ball still
found its way over the net and fell
untouched to give the Cardinal an 8-
7 advantage.
That lead increased to 11-7
before the scrappy Tigers made
several back row saves to fight
within 11-9. A UOP double-hit,
though, turned the momentum back
to Stanford and the Cardinal
captured the first game by a 15-11
score when the Tigers failed to get
the ball over the net in three hits.
Elaina Oden, the highly-touted
younger sister of Stanford's Kim
Oden, started the scoring for the
Tigers in the second game with an
ace serve. Not to be outdone,
however, Kim two plays later
blocked an attempted spike, turned
around and spiked the ball over the
net to knot the score at 1-1.
The visitors then proceeded to
take a 7-1 lead behind the hitting of
sophomore Dorothy Hert. Each
time the Cardinal got close they
made a crucial mistake, mishandling
serves and missing spikes. With

Stanford serving at 12-14, Kim
Oden hit wide on an easy spike op
portunity and at game point Hahner
knocked a spike into the net giving
the Tigers the second game, 15-12.
Trailing 1-4 in game three, the
Cardinal called on freshman Amy
Hayes to serve. Hayes, who
served exceptionally against
UCLA, once again baffled the op
ponent, serving three aces as Stan
ford scored eight straight points to
take a 9-4 lead.
The Tigers got as close as 12-9
but at that point Elaina Oden
