# Pamphlet Discusses Apartheid
## 
### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
A 20-page pamphlet concerning
apartheid and the issue of divest
ment from South Africa was
released by the University last
week and distributed throughout
campus dormitories.
Entitled "Stanford and South
Africa," the pamphlet contains a
brief history of the development
and origins of South African apart
heid, as well as an assessment of
the current state of affairs. Included
is a list of arguments for and against
the withdrawal of Stanford funds
from companies that do business
with South Africa.
"We're not sure how
knowledgable students are about
South Africa," said Diana Diamond

of Public Affairs.
Diamond, chief author of the
booklet, explained that Stanford's
purpose as an institution is to
"inform and educate society." She
said that 8,000 copies of the
pamphlet have been distributed to
campus dormitories.
In an introductory letter, Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy
acknowledges that the booklet may
seem "unsatisfactorily neutral" to
some, but that it is "a place to
begin" in Stanford's effort to
"provide . . . the means for people
to become more knowledgable."
Some students, however, appear
unimpressed by the University's
publication.
"He's doing nothing to change
the University's financial relation
ship with South Africa" said John
Mason, a senior majoring in interna

tional relations. "He's just putting
out a booklet which portrays the
University as sensitive to the apart
heid issue."
The University released the
booklet "to avoid having to do any
thing else,"Mason said.
"It's an interesting attempt by
the University to look as if it's
presenting an initiative. It seems as
if they think they're bringing back
the apartheid issue all on their
own," said David Troutt, a member
of Stanford out of South Africa.
"The University has a miscon
ception of what divestment really
is," Troutt explained. "They left
out the fundamental fact that di
vestment is an argument put for
ward by black South Africans. That
fact is falling on deaf ears in the Uni
versity and is clearly shown here (in
the booklet)."

Troutt called the booklet's title
"ironic" because "it doesn't concep
tualize Stanford as playing a role in
South Africa — it projects the
blame elsewhere, asserting that the
only meaningful action can come
from Washington."
Responding to Troutt's criticism,
Diamond said that black support of
divestment had not been cited in
the booklet because conflicting in
formation made validation im
possible.
Kennedy's introduction states
that in two weeks he intends to
reveal the University's "recent ef
forts to deal with the South African
problem."
Students supporting divestment,
however, are dubious.
"We're impressed with the Uni
versity's diction," Troutt said, "but
not with their action."
