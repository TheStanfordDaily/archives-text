# Baseball Opens Second Season

### 
LOS ANGELES — Left
hander Fernando Valenzuela
opens the National League
playoffs for the Los Angeles
Dodgers tonight and his appear
ance on the mound may force St.
Louis to bench rookie speedster
Vince Coleman.
Cardinal Manager Whitey Her
zog said yesterday he was con
sidering using right-handed hit
ting Tito Landrum in place of
Coleman, who stole a rookie
record 110 bases as St. Louis'
leadoff man this season.
Coleman is a switch hitter but
has more success batting from
the left side. Landrum batted
.280 as a part-timer for the
Cards this season and is best
remembered for the home run
that won the pennant for Bal
timore in the fourth game of the
1983 playoffs.
Asked about the switch, Her
zog said "I don't know yet, I've
got to weigh that one."
Herzog did say that he would
start righty-swinging Cesar
Cedeno in right field against
Valenzuela. Cedeno batted .434
with six home runs and 19 runs
batted in for the Cards after
being acquired from Cincinnati
Aug. 29.
While Herzog considered
loading up for Valenzuela with
righty bats, Los Angeles
Manager Tommy Lasorda
predicted the best-of-seven
matchup with St. Louis will be "a
very, very exciting playoff."
"The Cardinals are the best in
the league in hitting and in
defense," Lasorda said. "And
they have two 21-game winners.
"St. Louis is a very, very good
team."
From a won-lost standpoint,
the Cardinals were simply the
very best in the major leagues
during the 1985 regular season,
finishing with a 101-61 record to
capture their second NL East
title in four years.
The Dodgers, who've won the
West three of the past five
seasons, wound up 95-67 this
year after dipping under. 500 and
finishing fourth in 1984.
* The NL title series is seen as
a match of the Cardinals' pitching
and speed against the Dodgers'
pitching and power.
The Cardinals have the NL's
top hitter this season, Willie
McGee at .353, who, batting
second behind Coleman, stole 56
bases. St. Louis will pitch their
21-game winners, John Tudor
and Joaquin Andujar, in the first
two games.
The Dodgers counter with
Valenzeula, a 17-game winner,
and Orel Hershiser, who won

19. Los Angeles will depend on
power hitters Pedro Guerrero,
Mike Marshall and Greg Brock
for its offense.
The Cardinals' Tudor. 21-8,
will duel Valenzuela, 17-10, in
the opening game. Andujar, 21-
12, will go in Thursday's second
game at Dodger Stadium, facing
Hershiser, 19-3 and the winner
of 11 straight.
TORONTO — The Toronto
Blue Jays, favored to bring the
first World Series to Canada, can
take their first step in that direc
tion tonight when they meet the
Kansas City Royals in the first
game of the American League
playoffs.
"I'm sure everyone will be a
little jittery," said Dave Stieb,
who will start the best-of-seven
opener for the Blue Jays. "I'm
going to try not to overthrow.
But I'm sure I'll do that in the
first inning."
Toronto, an expansion team
formed nine seasons ago, is
making its first-ever appearance
in the postseason. Despite win
ning the strong AL East with 99
victories, the Blue Jays are not
one of the more well-known
teams in baseball.
"You ask anyone who the cen
ter fielder for the Blue Jays is
and they don't know. They might
say Willie Mays," said Toronto
center fielder Lloyd Moseby,
who hit 18 homers, stole 37
bases and is strong defensively.
The Royals won the season
series from Toronto seven
games to five. A Kansas City
victory in the playoffs would
mark just the second time since
1974 that the AL West team has
won, with Kansas City having
won in 1980.
Both teams like the best-of
seven format, expanded from
the previous best-of-five.
"I think it's a better test of
baseball," Howser said. "I wish
it was even longer."
"It used to be that if you lost
two of the first three, you were
in real trouble," Mulliniks said.
"Now, if that happens, you're
still not in good shape but you
have time to come back."
Both teams rely on their pitch
ing, and that appears to be the
key area to watch. Toronto led
the league in earned run average
and Kansas City was second.
Stieb's 2.48 ERA was best in
the AL, although he finished with
a 14-13 record. Leibrandt, at 17-
9, was second in the league with
a 2.69 ERA.

record 110 bases as St. Louis'
leadoff man this season.
Coleman is a switch hitter but
has more success batting from
the left side. Landrum batted
.280 as a part-timer for the
Cards this season and is best
remembered for the home run
that won the pennant for Bal
timore in the fourth game of the
1983 playoffs.
Asked about the switch, Her
zog said "I don't know yet, I've
got to weigh that one."
Herzog did say that he would
start righty-swinging Cesar
Cedeno in right field against
Valenzuela. Cedeno batted .434
with six home runs and 19 runs
batted in for the Cards after
being acquired from Cincinnati
Aug. 29.
While Herzog considered
loading up for Valenzuela with
righty bats, Los Angeles
Manager Tommy Lasorda
predicted the best-of-seven
matchup with St. Louis will be "a
very, very exciting playoff."
"The Cardinals are the best in
the league in hitting and in
defense," Lasorda said. "And
they have two 21-game winners.
"St. Louis is a very, very good
team."
From a won-lost standpoint,
the Cardinals were simply the
very best in the major leagues
during the 1985 regular season,
finishing with a 101-61 record to
capture their second NL East
title in four years.
The Dodgers, who've won the
West three of the past five
seasons, wound up 95-67 this
year after dipping under. 500 and
finishing fourth in 1984.
* The NL title series is seen as
a match of the Cardinals' pitching
and speed against the Dodgers'
pitching and power.
The Cardinals have the NL's
top hitter this season, Willie
McGee at .353, who, batting
second behind Coleman, stole 56
bases. St. Louis will pitch their
21-game winners, John Tudor
and Joaquin Andujar, in the first
two games.
The Dodgers counter with
Valenzeula, a 17-game winner,
and Orel Hershiser, who won

19. Los Angeles will depend on
power hitters Pedro Guerrero,
Mike Marshall and Greg Brock
for its offense.
The Cardinals' Tudor. 21-8,
will duel Valenzuela, 17-10, in
the opening game. Andujar, 21-
12, will go in Thursday's second
game at Dodger Stadium, facing
Hershiser, 19-3 and the winner
of 11 straight.
TORONTO — The Toronto
Blue Jays, favored to bring the
first World Series to Canada, can
take their first step in that direc
tion tonight when they meet the
Kansas City Royals in the first
game of the American League
playoffs.
"I'm sure everyone will be a
little jittery," said Dave Stieb,
who will start the best-of-seven
opener for the Blue Jays. "I'm
going to try not to overthrow.
But I'm sure I'll do that in the
first inning."
Toronto, an expansion team
formed nine seasons ago, is
making its first-ever appearance
in the postseason. Despite win
ning the strong AL East with 99
victories, the Blue Jays are not
one of the more well-known
teams in baseball.
"You ask anyone who the cen
ter fielder for the Blue Jays is
and they don't know. They might
say Willie Mays," said Toronto
center fielder Lloyd Moseby,
who hit 18 homers, stole 37
bases and is strong defensively.
The Royals won the season
series from Toronto seven
games to five. A Kansas City
victory in the playoffs would
mark just the second time since
1974 that the AL West team has
won, with Kansas City having
won in 1980.
Both teams like the best-of
seven format, expanded from
the previous best-of-five.
"I think it's a better test of
baseball," Howser said. "I wish
it was even longer."
"It used to be that if you lost
two of the first three, you were
in real trouble," Mulliniks said.
"Now, if that happens, you're
still not in good shape but you
have time to come back."
Both teams rely on their pitch
ing, and that appears to be the
key area to watch. Toronto led
the league in earned run average
and Kansas City was second.
Stieb's 2.48 ERA was best in
the AL, although he finished with
a 14-13 record. Leibrandt, at 17-
9, was second in the league with
a 2.69 ERA.

LOS ANGELES — Left
hander Fernando Valenzuela
opens the National League
playoffs for the Los Angeles
Dodgers tonight and his appear
ance on the mound may force St.
Louis to bench rookie speedster
Vince Coleman.
Cardinal Manager Whitey Her

Coleman, who stole a rookie
