# Pain and Payne Go Hand in Hand

It was a freak play, an accident really, but fumbles
can be expected on the first day of contact drills. It also
ended Stanford senior Kevin Payne's season and pos
sibly his career.
"The back just fumbled the ball," said Payne, an of
fensive lineman, of the play he injured his knee on. "It
ended up between my feet. Everybody was just diving
for the ball. My leg just happened to be in the way.
There's no way you can prepare for that.
"I knew the season was over right there. It didn't
really hurt that much. It just felt really wrong. I was
more frustrated than anything at that point. . . There
were only 20 minutes left in practice."
Payne had torn the medial collateral and posterior
cruciate ligaments in his left knee. The next day, team
physician Donald Bunce operated on him.
The injury was particularly disappointing for Payne,
as he had finally cracked the starting lineup after three
years of frustration. During spring practice, he was
tapped to start at left guard in the fall.
"I worked all this summer," Payne said. "I came into
camp this year in about my best shape ever. I was
spending anywhere from two to three hours in the
weightroom, lifting five days a week."
The non-contact portion of fall workouts had also
gone well for him.
"It (fall practice) was the best that I'd ever had,
Payne said. "I felt really good coming off the ball. I
dropped down to about 245 pounds. I felt a lot
quicker."
"I was really sad to see it," Coach Jack El
way said. "He was going to be, if not the best, equal to
the best offensive lineman we had."
"He had a good spring," Offensive Line
Coach Tony Yelovich said. "He was having an excellent
fall. We felt like, coming into it, that he had progressed

tremendously and was in a position to show the leader
ship qualities he has."
For Payne the injury was another in a series of
tears, dislocations and the like that have plagued him
throughout his Stanford career.
As a freshman he entered Stanford coming off wrist
surgery earlier in the summer, but managed to survive
the fall season in one piece.
"I made it all through fall playing on the 'meat
squad,' " Payne said. "Spring ball came along, I was
doing really well, and I blew out (separated) my
shoulder. During the summer I worked on getting that
better. I also worked on putting on weight."
The added weight — Payne was up to 255 pounds —
probably contributed to the stress fracture he suffered
in his foot during preseason sprints. Payne's sopho
more season was effectively ended, although he did
suit up for the last four games.
Payne's injury problems were only beginning.
"I developed hamstring problems during winter con
ditioning. My shoulder also kept dislocating," Payne
said. "I yanked my hamstring the second week of
spring practice, then I got a screw put in my shoulder
to keep it from dislocating."
Payne entered his junior season relatively injury
free after a summer of rehabilitating both the shoulder
and the hamstring, but was faced with the prospect of
trying to impress the incoming Elway and the rest of
his new coaching staff that fall.
"Not having a chance to have seen me play, I ended
up sitting on the bench," Payne said. "I survived pretty
much all of last year without any operations or injuries
— first year in three years that I hadn't had an opera
tion."
Payne, from Arroyo Grande, was not as injury
prone during a standout career at Arroyo Grande High
School that twice saw him named both All-San Luis
County and All-Northern League.
He did have to fight through adversity, however, as
Arroyo Grande won only one game his senior year.

A poor team record didn't keep the recruiters from
calling. Payne was courted by such football powers as
UCLA, the Air Force Academy and USC before he
decided to attend Stanford.
Although he has never really had a chance to show
his skills to the fans, Payne has nevertheless im
pressed teammates and coaches.
"He's the epitome of the hardworking, hardnosed,
really tough type of player," senior offensive lineman
John Barns said.
"He never gives up," junior defensive lineman Fred
Stahl said. "He's always working at it. He comes well
off the ball. He's a really mellow guy with real intensity
inside for football."
"Kevin was an excellent football player," Yelovich
said. "He worked so hard to get himself into physical
condition."
Payne has left his mark off the field also.
"He's very sincere and honest and responsible and
dependable," Elway said. "He earned a whole lot of
respect on this team."
"He's a super nice guy," Barns said of his teammate,
friend and Delta Tau Delta fraternity brother. "He's
kept in good spirits through all the injuries, and I sure
admire that."
Although Payne is eligible to return for a redshirt
fifth year, no one, including Payne himself, knows
whether he will give football one more shot.
"I'm going to see how the rehabilitation goes,"
Payne said. "If the knee is ready and the desire is
there, then I'll play. It's kind of hard after the fourth
operation. Even though you love the game, it's kind of
nice to get up in the morning and not feel like you're 40
years old.
"The love for the game has always outweighed the
injuries so far. I want to get the leg going, so I can at
least do the things I want to do even if it's not football."
"He's the kind of guy who, if he wants to come back
and keep playing, he will," Barns said.
"It's a blow that he'll in time adjust to," Elway said.

"If he were my son, I doubt I'd recommend that he
stay in it."
Payne will return for a fifth year to finish work on his
degree in land management and possibly go overseas,
regardless of whether or not he plays football. An avid
outdoorsman, Payne hopes to eventually work in
forestry in Northern California or Oregon.
"He's going to have a bright future no matter what
he does," Yelovich said. "He's an intelligent young
man. He's going to be very successful."


Senior Kevin Payne's career with the Cardinal
has been marred by a series of injuries. "If he
(Payne) were my son, I doubt I'd recommend
that he stay in it (football)," Jack Elway, Stan
ford's head football coach, said.
