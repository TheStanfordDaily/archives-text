# Sailors Sink Singlehandedly
## 
### BRANDI WATSON 
A nipped marker and a too-early
start proved to be costly mistakes
for representatives of the Stanford
sailing team at the Singlehanded
Championships in Santa Cruz this
weekend.
The Santa Cruz races were a
qualifying event for the National
Singlehanded Championships to be
held in Hawaii next month, but nei
ther Stanford boat qualified.
The Cardinal entered two 14-foot
Lasers, one crewed by junior Tom
Kuhnle and the other by sophomore
There DuPont, in a field of 26 other
boats from California and Hawaii.
Each boat participated in all 14
races, and a running total was kept
of each sailor's placings. The win
ner was the performer with the
lowest cumulative point total.
"We started out very, very
strong," Coach Joe Petrucci said.
"After two races we were tied with
each other for the lead. It was the
high point of the regatta."
Kuhnle was doing especially well.
"Tom was sailing very creatively.
His strength is that he works hard,
and he has the ability to think.
Others have more experience, but
Tom makes up for it in smarts,"
Petrucci said.
"Saturday everything sort of fell
into place," Kuhnle said. "I was
pleased with my tactics and boat
speed."
Controversy struck during the
fourth race on Saturday. Kuhnle
was taken to the protest room
where he was disqualified for con
tact with a marker and another
boat. "We expected the decision to
be against the other boat," Petrucci
said.
The disqualification penalty put
Kuhnle in last place for the race,

giving him 28 points. Without the
penalty, Kuhnle would have placed
14th. It gave the leader after the
first day, Bruce Edwards of UC-
Santa Cruz, some breathing room.
"Instead of being a solid second,
10 points behind Bruce, we were
fourth, two points out of second in a
big pack," Petrucci said.
Still, there were 10 boats in con
tention for second, including
Kuhnle's on Sunday. "It was a real
dog fight," Petrucci said.
The ninth race on Sunday proved
to be pivotal as a number of boats,
including Kuhnle's, crossed the
starting line early. Not realizing this
until well into the race, Kuhnle had

to come back and restart. He
finished the race in 17th place.
"I simply didn't sail well," Kuhnle
said.
Kuhnle went on to finish the
regatta in fifth place with 104
points, and DuPont finished 17th
with 236.
Greg Clute of the California
Maritime Academy ended in first
with 67 points. He was followed by
Santa Cruz' Edwards with 69
points. Clute and Edwards were
the qualifiers from last year's
event, too.
Although they didn't win,
Petrucci was pleased with his
team's performance. Both Kuhnle

and DuPont were walk-ons who
worked their way up. "For them to
go out and push the leaders, the
best in the country, they did a great
job," Petrucci said.
"It just wasn't in the cards.
Sometimes you can't come back
from a mistake. A perfect regatta
just can't be done. The regatta is
won by the team with the fewest
mistakes. Tom hung in there, but
the disqualification was too much."
Kuhnle was also pleased with the
event. 'We learned a lot," he said.
The team is now looking forward
to the Sloop Eliminations this
weekend and the Sloop Champion
ships in two weeks.


Stanford's Tom Kuhnle placed fifth in last weekend's regatta in Santa Cruz â€” that despite a dis
qualification from one of his races.Teammate There DuPont finished 17th. Neither boater was
able to qualify for the National Singlehanded Championships later this year in Hawaii.
