# Card Golfers Fourth in Japan

### JON WEISMAN 
The Stanford men's golf team
finished fourth out of 15 teams
amidst much pageantry at the
Japan-America Friendship
Tournament, held Wednesday
through Friday in Japan.
Placing Nos. 1 and 2 were
American rivals Brigham Young
and Arizona State. Nihon, a
strong Japanese collegiate team,
finished third.
Tulsa University, the only
American women's team invited
to play, defeated three other
Japanese colleges to take the
women's competition.
Leading the Cardinal was
junior Rich Marik, who bounced
back from an opening round 81
to score consecutive rounds of
72 and finish with the team's
lowest total at 225. Senior Phil
Rowley was also impressive,
opening with rounds of 73 and
77, leaving him only four strokes
off the individual lead before he
faltered in the final round.
"Phil's play really represented
a step upward for him," Cardinal
Coach Tim Schaaf said yester
day. "That was the biggest
tournament he's played in for
us."
Other Stanford golfers im
proved upon their efforts in early
rounds with fine final rounds.
Senior Carl Wagner turned in a
73, and sophomore John Dickey
posted a 75.
The team score reflected the
improvement. The first round
total was 309, but the squad shot
304 in the second round and 299

in the third.
"Don Walsworth didn't play as
well as he had been, but I'm sure
he'll be better this weekend,"
Schaaf said, refering to the
team's next tournament, the
Southwestern Invitational in
Thousand Oaks. "Carl got
progressively better. His trend
was good, and Johnny's trend
was good."
"Going in, the players had not
been playing that well, but al
most everyone played well for a
considerable period of time. We
have to avoid that odd round that
is too high â€” it's a question of
consistency. We have a ways to
go, but we're getting there."
Schaaf said the loss to Arizona
State did not really affect the
Cardinal's National Collegiate
Athletic Association (NCAA)
playoff chances. A tournament in
Japan is only considered by the
selection committee if the teams'
records are very close, and
ASU, according to Schaaf, will
almost certainly be going to the
NCAAs anyway.
"It hurts a lot more to lose to
struggling teams than to those
that are going to the Nationals,"
he said.
Did the tournament fulfill the
Card's expectations going in?
One would have to say that
the Cardinal is very satisfied.
Schaaf conceded that the team
probably should have beaten
Nihon. But if the trip to Japan
had to be summarized in one
word, it would be 'experience.'
"The trip was an absolutely
tremendous experience," Schaaf
said.
