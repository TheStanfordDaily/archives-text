WASHINGTON (AP) — George
Rogers and John Riggins each
rushed for more than 100 yards and
Washington's special teams and de
fensive unit combined to bottle up
the St. Louis offense last night as
the Redskins handed the Cardinals
a 27-10 National Football League
defeat.
Rogers rushed 25 times for 104
yards and Riggins 17 for 103, the
first time two Washington running
backs have rushed for over 100
yards in the same game.
The Cardinals, pinned deep in
their own territory most of the
night, started inside their own 26-
yard line on their first nine posses
sions.
The Redskin defense intercepted
four Neil Lomax passes and sacked
the St. Louis quarterback four

times, keeping the Cardinals out of
the end zone until the fourth quar
ter when Washington held a 20-3
lead.
The victory, before a sellout
Robert F. Kennedy Stadium crowd
of 53,134, raised the Redskins'
record to 2-3.
The Cardinals, who haven't won
in Washington since 1978, fell to 3-2
and dropped one game behind Dal
las in the NFC East. The loss also
marked the Cardinals 11th defeat in
13 games against Washington.
Before he was knocked out of the
game late in the fourth quarter with
a pinched nerve in his shoulder,
Lomax completed 18 of 33 for 216
yards.
Redskin quarterback Joe Theis
mann was 11 of 20 for 83 yards and
