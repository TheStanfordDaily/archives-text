Reagan Defies World Court
WASHINGTON — President Reagan canceled U.S. recognition of
the compulsory jurisdiction of the World Court yesterday, ending
what the State Department's top lawyer called a noble but un
successful 39-year "experiment" in international law.
Despite the action, however, the United States said that it will
continue to refer cases to the court, officially known as the Interna
tional Court of Justice, when the parties involved specifically agree to
accept its judgment or when adjudication is required by treaty.
The decision ends U.S. participation in cases brought under a
seldom-used section of the court's powers in which nations can sue
or be sued even if the defendant country objects.
The U.S. withdrawal reduces to 45 the number of nations that
have accepted what the court calls its "optional compulsory jurisdic
tion." Of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council,
only Great Britain now accepts that phase of the court's jurisdiction.
In this case, "compulsory" means that a nation will accept the
court's ruling even if it objects to the suit.* The court's regulations do
not require nations to accept that jurisdiction and permit nations to
withdraw if they wish.
However, only nations that accept the jurisdiction are permitted to
file suit under its provisions. But all nations may use the court as an
arbitration panel, submitting disputes by mutual consent that cannot
be solved peacefully in other ways.
State Department legal adviser Abraham Sofaer, a former U.S.
District judge, said that the action resulted from the courts decision
last November to consider Nicaraguan charges that U.S. aid to the
"contra" rebels violated international law. That case is still pending.
The Reagan Administration announced earlier that it would refuse
to accept the court's jurisdiction in cases concerning Central America
for two years.
'We felt the Nicaragua case was an unfortunate signal to us that
we should be concerned about our security interests and about the
use of the court for political-public relations purposes. . . . The
president does not want the court used for those purposes; at the
same time, he and others in this Administration want to continue to
use the court for its intended purposes," Sofaer said.
British Bobbies Given Weapons
LONDON — Following a dramatic escalation in the level of urban
violence, Britain's traditionally unarmed police officers have begun
equipping themselves with anti-riot weaponry for the first time, a
senior law officer disclosed yesterday.
The development is viewed here as a watershed in the history of
Britain's police, long regarded as one the most restrained anywhere.
In an explosive eight-hour riot Sunday described as Britain's worst
ever, one police officer was hacked to death with a machete, seven
other persons were blasted with a shotgun and 230 police officers
and 50 civilians were injured.
As fires still smoldered in the north London suburb of Tottenham,
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Kenneth Newman said yes
terday that plastic bullets and guns had been issued to law officers.
He said he would "not shrink" from ordering their use should they be
required.
Home Secretary Douglas Hurd fully supported the controversial
decision.
The large-diameter plastic bullets have been used for years by
police and the British Army in Northern Ireland, but never before in
England. The bullets are designed to injure rather than kill, but at
least 10 persons have been fatally wounded by them in Northern
Ireland since they were introduced there in the early 1970s.
Arafat Threatens Talks
TUNIS, Tunisia — Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser
Arafat, maintaining that the United States was to blame for last
week's Israeli raid against his Tunis headquarters, suggested yester
day that he may withdraw from current peace efforts unless he
receives guarantees from the Reagan Administration that it will
"stop trying to assassinate me."
Arafat, in an hour-long interview in a closely guarded villa in Tunis,
said he remains "committed to the struggle for peace." However, he
added that the raid, which destroyed his seaside headquarters here
and killed 73 people, has forced him to reassess the PLO's participa
tion in a joint peace initiative launched in February with Jordan's King
Hussein.
That initiative, which is also supported by Egypt, currently
focuses on efforts to arrange a meeting between Asst. Secretary of
State Richard Murphy and a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation t6
discuss possible scenarios for eventual peace talks with Israel.
But Arafat, who repeated assertions that the White House had ad
vance knowledge of the raid, said that the peace process can now go
forward only if he receives "guarantees from the president of the
United States . . . that the attempt to assassinate me" will not be
repeated.
The interview with Arafat was conducted prior to the hijacking of
an Italian Cruise ship yesterday by a Palestinian splinter group.
U.S. Opens Talks With Allies
BONN, West Germany — The United States opened an intensive
series of consultations with its allies yesterday on how to respond to
the Soviet Union's latest arms-control proposals in advance of the
November summit between President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization's initial review of the So
viet offer, outlined in detail by Gorbachev during a state visit to Paris
last week, was conducted in Brussels at a high-level meeting chaired
by Richard Perle, assistant secretary of defense for international se
curity policy.
Officials in several West European capitals said they expected the
momentum of calls for new arms control initiatives to accelerate as
the U.S. shapes its final strategy before the Geneva summit Nov.

S. Africa To Integrate Theaters
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — The government announced
plans yesterday to begin integrating South Africa's movie theaters in
another break with apartheid, and other moves are under way to end
racial segregation in bars and restaurants.
Piet Badenhorst, deputy minister of constitutional planning and
development, said in Pretoria that some of the all-white cinemas in
the central business districts of Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban
and Pietermaritzburg, the capital of Natal province, will be opened to
all races. Drive-in theaters throughout the country will also be inte
grated if their owners apply for permission, he said.

Ireland since they were introduced there in the early 1970s.
Arafat Threatens Talks
TUNIS, Tunisia — Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser
Arafat, maintaining that the United States was to blame for last
week's Israeli raid against his Tunis headquarters, suggested yester
day that he may withdraw from current peace efforts unless he
receives guarantees from the Reagan Administration that it will
"stop trying to assassinate me."
Arafat, in an hour-long interview in a closely guarded villa in Tunis,
said he remains "committed to the struggle for peace." However, he
added that the raid, which destroyed his seaside headquarters here
and killed 73 people, has forced him to reassess the PLO's participa
tion in a joint peace initiative launched in February with Jordan's King
Hussein.
That initiative, which is also supported by Egypt, currently
focuses on efforts to arrange a meeting between Asst. Secretary of
State Richard Murphy and a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation t6
discuss possible scenarios for eventual peace talks with Israel.
But Arafat, who repeated assertions that the White House had ad
vance knowledge of the raid, said that the peace process can now go
forward only if he receives "guarantees from the president of the
United States . . . that the attempt to assassinate me" will not be
repeated.
The interview with Arafat was conducted prior to the hijacking of
an Italian Cruise ship yesterday by a Palestinian splinter group.
U.S. Opens Talks With Allies
BONN, West Germany — The United States opened an intensive
series of consultations with its allies yesterday on how to respond to
the Soviet Union's latest arms-control proposals in advance of the
November summit between President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization's initial review of the So
viet offer, outlined in detail by Gorbachev during a state visit to Paris
last week, was conducted in Brussels at a high-level meeting chaired
by Richard Perle, assistant secretary of defense for international se
curity policy.
Officials in several West European capitals said they expected the
momentum of calls for new arms control initiatives to accelerate as
the U.S. shapes its final strategy before the Geneva summit Nov.
19-20.
S. Africa To Integrate Theaters
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — The government announced
plans yesterday to begin integrating South Africa's movie theaters in
another break with apartheid, and other moves are under way to end
racial segregation in bars and restaurants.
Piet Badenhorst, deputy minister of constitutional planning and
development, said in Pretoria that some of the all-white cinemas in
the central business districts of Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban
and Pietermaritzburg, the capital of Natal province, will be opened to
all races. Drive-in theaters throughout the country will also be inte
grated if their owners apply for permission, he said.
Reagan Defies World Court
WASHINGTON — President Reagan canceled U.S. recognition of
the compulsory jurisdiction of the World Court yesterday, ending
what the State Department's top lawyer called a noble but un
successful 39-year "experiment" in international law.
Despite the action, however, the United States said that it will
continue to refer cases to the court, officially known as the Interna
tional Court of Justice, when the parties involved specifically agree to
accept its judgment or when adjudication is required by treaty.
The decision ends U.S. participation in cases brought under a
seldom-used section of the court's powers in which nations can sue
or be sued even if the defendant country objects.
The U.S. withdrawal reduces to 45 the number of nations that
have accepted what the court calls its "optional compulsory jurisdic
tion." Of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council,
only Great Britain now accepts that phase of the court's jurisdiction.
In this case, "compulsory" means that a nation will accept the
court's ruling even if it objects to the suit.* The court's regulations do
not require nations to accept that jurisdiction and permit nations to
withdraw if they wish.
However, only nations that accept the jurisdiction are permitted to
file suit under its provisions. But all nations may use the court as an
arbitration panel, submitting disputes by mutual consent that cannot
be solved peacefully in other ways.
State Department legal adviser Abraham Sofaer, a former U.S.
District judge, said that the action resulted from the courts decision
last November to consider Nicaraguan charges that U.S. aid to the
"contra" rebels violated international law. That case is still pending.
The Reagan Administration announced earlier that it would refuse
to accept the court's jurisdiction in cases concerning Central America
for two years.
'We felt the Nicaragua case was an unfortunate signal to us that
we should be concerned about our security interests and about the
use of the court for political-public relations purposes. . . . The
president does not want the court used for those purposes; at the
same time, he and others in this Administration want to continue to
use the court for its intended purposes," Sofaer said.
British Bobbies Given Weapons
LONDON — Following a dramatic escalation in the level of urban
violence, Britain's traditionally unarmed police officers have begun
equipping themselves with anti-riot weaponry for the first time, a
senior law officer disclosed yesterday.
The development is viewed here as a watershed in the history of
Britain's police, long regarded as one the most restrained anywhere.
In an explosive eight-hour riot Sunday described as Britain's worst
ever, one police officer was hacked to death with a machete, seven
other persons were blasted with a shotgun and 230 police officers
and 50 civilians were injured.
As fires still smoldered in the north London suburb of Tottenham,
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Kenneth Newman said yes
terday that plastic bullets and guns had been issued to law officers.
He said he would "not shrink" from ordering their use should they be
required.
Home Secretary Douglas Hurd fully supported the controversial
decision.
The large-diameter plastic bullets have been used for years by
police and the British Army in Northern Ireland, but never before in
England. The bullets are designed to injure rather than kill, but at
least 10 persons have been fatally wounded by them in Northern
Ireland since they were introduced there in the early 1970s.
