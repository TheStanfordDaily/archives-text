ROME â€” A group of armed Palestinians
hijacked an Italian cruise ship with more than 400
persons aboard off the Egyptian coast yester
day, demanded the release of prisoners held by
Israel and threatened to blow up the ship if at
tacked.
Egyptian authorities notified Italy that the ship
was seized by the Palestinians after it left
Alexandria en route to the Suez Canal port city
of Port Said. They said that the ship, the liner
Achille Lauro, then steamed away from Port
Said into the Mediterranean.
Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman Francesco
Verga said that early today the ship was re
ported to be heading north, about 40 miles from
Port Said.
As of early today, there were no reports of
radio communications with the hijackers.
Italian Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti called
the office of the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion here and was told the PLO had no knowl
edge of the hijacking and denied responsibility
for it, the spokesman said. A spokesman at the
PLO's Tunis headquarters said, "There is no
connection between the PLO and this opera
tion. "
According to news agency reports from Port
Said, the hijackers identified themselves as
members of a group called the Palestine Libera
tion Front and were led by a man named Omar.

Route of the hijacked cruise ship.
The reports said that the commandos, carrying
firearms and explosives, had demanded the
release of 50 Palestinian prisoners in Israel and
threatened to blow up the cruise liner if their
demands were not met or the ship came under
attack.
Some Egyptian officials said that they believed
the leader was Omar Mustafa and that the group
he heads is opposed to PLO chief Yasser Arafat.
Arab specialists said that the Palestine Libera

tion Front was close to two other splinter
groups, the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine and the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine.
There were conflicting reports concerning the
number of passengers and crew members
aboard at the time of the hijacking. Officials of
Flota Achille, the shipping company that owns
the Achille Lauro, could not be reached to give
the names and nationalities of passengers and
crew.
But a Naples Port Authority spokesman said
that there were 840 passengers, including 304
West Germans, 150 to 160 Italians, 120 Britons,
about 60 French and about 40 Spaniards. Italian
state television said that there were "rumored"
to be 28 Americans on the passenger list as well.
The Italian Foreign Ministry said that 70 to 80
passengers and 340 crew members were aboard
the ship when it was hijacked. Another 664 pas
sengers, including 72 Americans, skipped the
Alexandria-to-Port Said sailing to take a daylong
bus excursion to Cairo and are safe, the ministry
said. They were to have rejoined the cruise in
Port Said.
The Italian news agency ANSA said that the
only signal heard from the ship was an SOS inter
cepted by a Swedish ham radio operator in
Goteborg, Sweden, as the Palestinians seized
the ship yesterday morning.
