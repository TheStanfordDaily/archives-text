# White House Pressures Congress To Pass Debt Ceiling Extension
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Threatening
that government checks could start
bouncing as early as today, the
Reagan Administration yesterday
turned up the pressure on
Congress to pass an extension of
the debt ceiling that includes man
datory balanced-budget provisions.
The Administration warning
came as Senate leaders of both par
ties, faced with a stalemate on the
floor of the chamber, met privately
off the floor to negotiate a compro
mise that could pave the way for at
least temporary extension of the

government's borrowing power.
In what has increasingly become
a high-stakes game of chicken,
Republicans have been insisting on
including in the debt measure a far
reaching new set of budget rules
that would force a balanced budget
by 1991.
Senate Democrats, with support
of their House colleagues, have
been holding off action with threats
of filibuster. Republicans have not
had enough votes to break a
filibuster, even though they have a
majority for eventual passage of the

budget plan. ,
The Democrats are seeking a
temporary debt extension. The
Republicans have so far blocked it,
hoping to use the pressure of the
debt-ceiling deadline as leverage to
pass the new budget rules.
The threat of an unprecedented
government default on its obliga
tions — including the specter of
bouncing Treasury checks — has
been raised daily in the current
debate. But the deadline was
vague, subject to the flow of gov
ernment funds and judgmental deci

sions by Treasury officials. But a
letter yesterday from Deputy Trea
sury Richard Darman upped the
stakes by threatening a deadline.
Some escape-hatches, such as
emergency borrowing through the
Federal Financing Bank, still
remain if the government does
declare itself out of cash.
It appeared that any immediate
effect of the government losing its
ability to borrow would be limited to
government contractors, officials
said.
