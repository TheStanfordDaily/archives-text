### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
Calling Bishop Desmond Tutu "the one Gandhi fig
ure left in South Africa," Joan Baez told a crowd of
more than 100 at Branner Hall yesterday that active
non-violence must be pursued to end apartheid in that
country.
A folk singer and outspoken political activist, Baez
said Tutu is "trying desperately to bring non-violent ac
tivity" to the front as a means of dealing with the racial
tension plaguing South Africa.
"He personally will hang on to non-violence in any
way that he can forever," she said, noting the pressure
that is on the Nobel Peace Prize winner to take
decisive action to end apartheid.
Baez, along with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Coretta
Scott King, Lech Walesa and several other prominent
political activists, recently sent a letter to Tutu, stating
that "your refusal to respond with violence has been
your strongest weapon."
Baez called non-violence "the only human way to
conduct business," stating that violence and war are
"simply accepted as the nature of the day" for dealing
with conflicts.
The complete text of the letter, which Baez said has
yet to be printed in any newspaper in the United

States, will appear in tomorrow's Daily.
Divestment "isn't just a very simple question," Baez
said, calling the move to withdraw stock from compan
ies doing business in South Africa "a moral question."
Baez, who took part in her first peace march at age
14, also praised the interest of some college students
now playing an active role in the move toward divest
ment, as well as in "low-risk" movements such as Live
Aid and Farm Aid.
"You're fed up with (theme-generation) label," she
said, adding that the movement for divestment that
began last spring "didn't just stop — I think it's
growing."
Encouraging students to play an active role in politi
cal movements, Baez said, "You have to do what's in
teresting to you. ... I think I always would have said
that."
Wearing a Live Aid T-shirt, Baez called the all-star
concert staged this summer to raise money for famine
relief in Africa, "something that is taking you out of the
sororities and classrooms."
Baez, who appeared in Live Aid, said the event "had
nothing to do with sacrifice ... it was not a political act
for me at all."
Baez called the concert "basically a joke," saying
that Bob Geldof, the driving force behing the event,
was the only person truly interested in the motive be
hind the concert.
