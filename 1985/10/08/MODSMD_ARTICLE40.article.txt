Quotas Head Docket
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court,
after years of skirting the edges of the bitter
controversy over affirmative action, agreed
yesterday to decide whether goals and quotas
permissible means of redressing discrim
ination in the workplace.
The court, opening its 1985-86 term,
agreed to decide the legality of federal court
orders in Cleveland and New York City that
mandated the hiring and promotion of specific
percentages of minorities. White firefighters in
Cleveland and white sheet-metal workers in
the New York area appealed, arguing that the
orders limited their own opportunities and
made them victims of "reverse discrimina
tion." Although goals and quotas similar to
those at issue in yesterday's cases have
become commonplace, the court has never di
rectly confronted their legality.
Instead, it has issued relatively narrow
opinions in cases beginning with Bakke v. Uni
versity of California, the highly publicized 1978
case of a man refused admission to a medical
school to make room for a minority.
In addition to the employment cases, the
high court agreed to decide:
• Whether people opposed to the death
penalty may be excluded from jury service in
capital punishment cases.
• If a school system violated First Amendment
free speech rights when it disciplined a student
who made a speech filled with sexual in

nuendoes to a school assembly.
• In a District of Columbia case, whether an
employer may be held liable for damages
when, without the employer's knowledge, a
supervisor sexually harasses a worker.
• Whether a wife, held as a material witness in
an espionage case, can be forced to testify
before a grand jury against her husband.
Auto Plant Planned
DETROIT — Chrysler and Mitsubishi
Motors of Japan said yesterday that they will
build a $500 million plant near Bloomington,
111., to produce small cars together beginning
in 1988, but they warned that they have no
plans to hire members of the United Auto
Workers union for the project.
The joint venture, to be called Diamond-
Star Motors, is expected to produce 180,000
small cars in time for the 1989 model year for
sale both by Chrysler and Mitsubishi dealers in
the United States. The venture's two-million
square -foot plant, to be designed and
managed by Mitsubishi officials, will be built on
a 636-acre site just outside the towns of
Bloomington and Normal, in central Illinois.
Chrysler and Mitsubishi each will own 50
percent of the joint venture, which will employ
about 2,500 workers on two shifts and produce
a new line of small, two-door and four-door
specialty models, officials said.

Deductions To Be Cut
WASHINGTON — The House Ways and
Means Committee, continuing efforts to write
a comprehensive tax revision bill, agreed yes
terday to limit personal and corporate tax
deductions for business entertainment and
meals, but made no decision on what restric
tions to impose.
The committee rejected a proposal by Rep.
Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.) to maintain current law,
which allows nearly all business expenses for
restaurant meals, sports events and conven
tions to be deducted as legitimate costs.
Market Shows Losses
NEW YORK — The stock market drifted to
a moderate loss yesterday in selling ascribed
to worries over the outlook for corporate prof
its.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
dropped 4.37 to 1,324.37.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
slowed to 95.55 million shares from 101.17
million Friday.
Brokers said the market was also unsettled
by talk that Paul Volcker might be planning to
leave the chairmanship of the Federal
Reserve. The Fed has strongly denied recur
ring rumors of a resignation by Volcker, who is
highly regarded by many Wall Streeters.
