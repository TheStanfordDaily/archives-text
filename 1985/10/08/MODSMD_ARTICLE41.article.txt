Cameras in Court
OAKLAND — Next month, Oakland's
Municipal Court District will become the first
in the state to experiment with video and audio
equipment as a substitute for court reporters
in misdemeanor cases.
Court Administrator George Dickey said
Monday the equipment will be installed in one
of the district's 17 courtrooms by the end of
November at a cost of $12,850. The court
clerk will operate the camera.
"It would last at least until we determine
whether it is a feasible means of recording
court proceedings," he said. If successful,
they will have to determine if it will be used as
a backup or replacement for court reporters.

Handicapped Protest
LONG BEACH — Activists staged a sit-in
yesterday at the office of Rep. Glenn Ander
son and held a second day of demonstrations in
downtown Los Angeles protesting a lack of
access to public transportation.
About a dozen protesters, many of them in
wheelchairs, crowded into the suburban Long
Beach office of Anderson while others
remained in the hall outside, said Anderson's
executive assistant, Ann Ramirez.
Anderson, a Long Beach Democrat, is
chairman of the House Transportation Com
mittee.
Ramirez said the congressman had been
scheduled to be at his office and at a speaking

engagement in Los Angeles on Monday but
had to cancel those plans and stay in Washing
ton because of a heavy workload.
Brush Fire Controlled
RANCHO CUCAMONGA — Firefighters
controlled a 473-acre forest fire yesterday and
said sparks from a motorcycle or heavy equip
ment accidentally ignited the weekend inferno
that had sent flames shooting 50 feet into the
air.
The fire started Saturday near the north end
of Archibald Avenue where the Angeles and
San Bernardino national forests meet, U.S.
Forest Service spokesman Mike Conrad said
Monday.
