Raspberry yogurt sprinkled with coconut,
Haagen Dazs coffee ice cream, Laura Ashley or
maybe even a new mask for Halloween.
It does not take much to entice Stanford stu
dents to travel the short distance to the Stanford
Shopping Center.
Not unexpectedly, the stores students seem
to frequent most are the novelty shops and the
shops that seem to be made for "just looking."
However, what is not expected is the lack of de
pendence the majority of these stores have on
Stanford Students as patrons.
Norney's, "A Curiosity Shop," or "the every
thing shop," as one student called it, has walls
lined with masks and costumes for every wild
campus occasion; however, two sales clerks said
that the Stanford clientele "is not crucially impor
tant" to business.
The anonymous sales clerks estimated that
their greatest customers are the families of Palo
Alto, saying they are "the ones who come in and
buy $100 worth of merchandise."
Aside from Norney's school supplies and novel
party favors, the mall services that seem to be
best patronized by Stanford students are those
providing alternatives to food service and
Tresidder Union.
Yovi Yogurt is among one of the many favorite
stops of sophomore Jeff Sloan. He pointed out

that the yogurt is much better than that at the
Corner Pocket.
Like many other students, he only shops at
the mall "when I have the time."
"It's convenient," he said. "I don't like the
prices, but it's convenient."
One Sales Consultant of Saks Fifth Avenue,
Lynda Fahey, said that she finds Stanford stu
dents "come in quite often, as far as purchases
go."
Last Saturday at the Saks fashion show, she
said she noticed many Stanford students both as
participants and spectators, proving that the
students' main interests in Saks are the "fashion
and accessories."
Fahey also pointed out that more and more
men are attending to cosmetics. She said she
finds that Stanford men shop late on Thursday
and Friday nights, and that they are becoming
more concerned about what kind of cologne and
after shave they wear.
She also noticed that when men come into the
store in the daylight hours, they "rarely come in
alone," she said. Fahey noted that the students
who do come into the store usually shop in
couples.
All in all, Fahey does notice when Stanford
students are back in school. When the year
starts, the sales for women's cosmetics
noticeably rise.
"Students come in here and purchase a lot of
Clinique and La Prairie," she said. "They're the

fast sellers."
Fahey attributed the greater sales of Clinique
and La Prairie to their "young and modern"
reputations.
Unlike their competition from Nordstrom's
across the courtyard. "Saks Fifth Avenue's cos
metic counters are a little bit different," Fahey
said. She explained that she knows more about
the product she is selling at Saks, having had the
chance to try it out itself.
At Nordstrom's, the sales representatives are
paid partly by commission, whereas at Saks, the
sales consultant is hired on salary.
Each representative makes the same amount
of money, so the competition to outsell a fellow
clerk is not as great.
With this method, Fahey said that she can pay
more attention to the customer's needs and not
as much to the pressure to make a sale.
Ranking among stores as popular as Saks are
shops suih as Ann Taylor's and Laura Ashley.
"I love Ann Taylor," said a freshman fan of
Benetton and Laura Ashley, alike.
Additionally responsible for the attraction of
Stanford students to the mall is the 28-year-old
Macy's store.
"We do get a lot of students of Stanford. We
I r.f:\v wht they're here. They park their bikes
and come in with their little backpacks," said
Helga Zischka, one of the sales clerks at Macy's
Elizabeth Arden counter.
"My feeling is that Stanford
definitely controls the mall," she
said.
Zischka said that she thinks Stan
ford students "feel a little more
comfortable here," and that the
employees at Macy's have a "good
rapport with the students," she
said.
According to Zischka, the Stan
ford students "certainly add to the
business. They come in with their
budget and take advantage of the
sales."
Zischka said that seeing the stu
dents coming back from summer is
"fun, and Macy's is used to it."
"I think it helps that we can
relate to them," she said. "Macy's
has a good young clientele because
they'll be our future customers."
Turning to a sweeter subject,
even avid shoppers of the mall have
probably overlooked a certain
sweets shop, Stationhouse Candies
and Cookies, located in the Stan
ford Barn.
"Everything is made fresh here,"
promised J. P. Massahos, one of the
owners.
"There's nothing like it on the
Peninsula," she said. "We make
brittles, homemade English toffee,
fudges and pecan rolls."
The oldest resident of the
Barn, Stationhouse has been part of
the mall for 25 years, and tries to
hold on to its Stanford clientele,

which consists mainly of medical
students and computer science
majors.
Not too far from the Station
house is the much-frequented
Haagen Dazs ice cream shop.
Manager Chris McCarto of

Haagen Dazs said, "Stanford stu
dents keep us alive. They're our
mainstay."
McCarto said that most of the
students who shop at Haagen Dazs
come in during the night, and that
the management of the ice cream

parlor tries to advertise their
delivery services in The Daily.
Not all students shop at the mall
for food or fashion alone. One
anonymous freshman noted that
she shops at the mall because "the
landscaping is so nice."

When you can't tolerate the idea of another dorm meal, the Stanford Shopping Center is an al
ternative that offers everything from sidewalk orange juice stands, like the one these shoppers
patronize, to high-priced restaurants with lots of atmosphere. It's only a 10-minute bike ride from
almost every campus residence, or a pleasant walk.

Raspberry yogurt sprinkled with coconut,
Haagen Dazs coffee ice cream, Laura Ashley or
maybe even a new mask for Halloween.
It does not take much to entice Stanford stu
dents to travel the short distance to the Stanford
Shopping Center.
Not unexpectedly, the stores students seem
to frequent most are the novelty shops and the
shops that seem to be made for "just looking."
However, what is not expected is the lack of de
pendence the majority of these stores have on
Stanford Students as patrons.
Norney's, "A Curiosity Shop," or "the every
thing shop," as one student called it, has walls
lined with masks and costumes for every wild
campus occasion; however, two sales clerks said
that the Stanford clientele "is not crucially impor
tant" to business.
The anonymous sales clerks estimated that
their greatest customers are the families of Palo
Alto, saying they are "the ones who come in and
buy $100 worth of merchandise."
Aside from Norney's school supplies and novel
party favors, the mall services that seem to be
best patronized by Stanford students are those
providing alternatives to food service and
Tresidder Union.
Yovi Yogurt is among one of the many favorite
stops of sophomore Jeff Sloan. He pointed out

that the yogurt is much better than that at the
Corner Pocket.
Like many other students, he only shops at
the mall "when I have the time."
"It's convenient," he said. "I don't like the
prices, but it's convenient."
One Sales Consultant of Saks Fifth Avenue,
Lynda Fahey, said that she finds Stanford stu
dents "come in quite often, as far as purchases
go."
Last Saturday at the Saks fashion show, she
said she noticed many Stanford students both as
participants and spectators, proving that the
students' main interests in Saks are the "fashion
and accessories."
Fahey also pointed out that more and more
men are attending to cosmetics. She said she
finds that Stanford men shop late on Thursday
and Friday nights, and that they are becoming
more concerned about what kind of cologne and
after shave they wear.
She also noticed that when men come into the
store in the daylight hours, they "rarely come in
alone," she said. Fahey noted that the students
who do come into the store usually shop in
couples.
All in all, Fahey does notice when Stanford
students are back in school. When the year
starts, the sales for women's cosmetics
noticeably rise.
"Students come in here and purchase a lot of
Clinique and La Prairie," she said. "They're the

fast sellers."
Fahey attributed the greater sales of Clinique
and La Prairie to their "young and modern"
reputations.
Unlike their competition from Nordstrom's
across the courtyard. "Saks Fifth Avenue's cos
metic counters are a little bit different," Fahey
said. She explained that she knows more about
the product she is selling at Saks, having had the
chance to try it out itself.
At Nordstrom's, the sales representatives are
paid partly by commission, whereas at Saks, the
sales consultant is hired on salary.
Each representative makes the same amount
of money, so the competition to outsell a fellow
clerk is not as great.
With this method, Fahey said that she can pay
more attention to the customer's needs and not
as much to the pressure to make a sale.
Ranking among stores as popular as Saks are
shops suih as Ann Taylor's and Laura Ashley.
"I love Ann Taylor," said a freshman fan of
Benetton and Laura Ashley, alike.
Additionally responsible for the attraction of
Stanford students to the mall is the 28-year-old
Macy's store.
"We do get a lot of students of Stanford. We
I r.f:\v wht they're here. They park their bikes
and come in with their little backpacks," said
Helga Zischka, one of the sales clerks at Macy's
Elizabeth Arden counter.
"My feeling is that Stanford
definitely controls the mall," she
said.
Zischka said that she thinks Stan
ford students "feel a little more
comfortable here," and that the
employees at Macy's have a "good
rapport with the students," she
said.
According to Zischka, the Stan
ford students "certainly add to the
business. They come in with their
budget and take advantage of the
sales."
Zischka said that seeing the stu
dents coming back from summer is
"fun, and Macy's is used to it."
"I think it helps that we can
relate to them," she said. "Macy's
has a good young clientele because
they'll be our future customers."
Turning to a sweeter subject,
even avid shoppers of the mall have
probably overlooked a certain
sweets shop, Stationhouse Candies
and Cookies, located in the Stan
ford Barn.
"Everything is made fresh here,"
promised J. P. Massahos, one of the
owners.
"There's nothing like it on the
Peninsula," she said. "We make
brittles, homemade English toffee,
fudges and pecan rolls."
The oldest resident of the
Barn, Stationhouse has been part of
the mall for 25 years, and tries to
hold on to its Stanford clientele,

which consists mainly of medical
students and computer science
majors.
Not too far from the Station
house is the much-frequented
Haagen Dazs ice cream shop.
Manager Chris McCarto of

Haagen Dazs said, "Stanford stu
dents keep us alive. They're our
mainstay."
McCarto said that most of the
students who shop at Haagen Dazs
come in during the night, and that
the management of the ice cream

parlor tries to advertise their
delivery services in The Daily.
Not all students shop at the mall
for food or fashion alone. One
anonymous freshman noted that
she shops at the mall because "the
landscaping is so nice."

When you can't tolerate the idea of another dorm meal, the Stanford Shopping Center is an al
ternative that offers everything from sidewalk orange juice stands, like the one these shoppers
patronize, to high-priced restaurants with lots of atmosphere. It's only a 10-minute bike ride from
almost every campus residence, or a pleasant walk.
