University Fellows
Profs. Peter Banks, electrical
engineering, and Patricia Jones, bi
ology, have been selected as Uni
versity fellows, according to San
tiago Rodriguez, University affirm
ative action officer and fellows pro
gram coordinator.
Banks, director of the Univer
sity's Space Telecommunications
and Radioscience Laboratory
(STARLAB), is chairman of
NASA's Task Force on the Scien
tific Uses of the Space Station. An
alumnus of Stanford, he has taught
at the University since 1981.
Jones, who works in the field of
immunology research, was named
the first woman recipient of the
Texas Instruments Foundation's
Founders' Prize in 1983. She was
honored for her work on a set of
proteins called histocompatibility
antigens that occur on the surface
of white blood cells and are respon
sible for the body's response to
foreign substances.
Banks and Jones will join return
ing fellows Prof. Sara Donaldson,
radiology; John Felstiner, English;
Kennell Jackson, history; and Rich

ard Zare, chemistry.
The purpose of the fellows pro
gram is to nurture development of
academic statesmanship among fac
ulty members by broadening their
understanding of the University's
goals, modes of governance and in
ternal and external relations.
The fellows meet regularly
during the academic year to discuss
these topics, often with guest
speakers. Faculty fellows also
receive five month's salary support
to pursue projects of their own
choosing, typically outside their
own academic discipline.
Law Professor
Robert Ellickson, 44, has been
named to the Robert E. Paradise
Professorship in Natural Resources
Law.
"Bob Ellickson is one of the
preeminent scholars of land use law
in the United States," said Dean of
the Law School John Ely, in a Sept.
10 report to the Board of Trustees.
"He has also proven to be an un
commonly effective and popular
teacher."
Most of Ellickson's articles apply

economic analysis to land and prop
erty rights issues. His writings on
homeowners associations, nuisance
law and land development controls
are cited in leading case books used
in American law schools.
Ellickson's scholarly interests
also include the natural resources
law subjects of public lands, water
resources policy and land taxation.
He is currently investigating how
neighbors deal with such potential
issues as trespass by livestock.
"Lawyers tend to thnk that law is
always the most important instru
ment of social control, but it's clear
from fieldwork that I and others
have done that this is not always
true," Ellickson said recently.
"Major domains of human activity
are beyond the reach of law. Lan
downers are often more influenced
by their notions about how good
neighbors should act than by what
the law is."
An advocate of field research, El
lickson personally interviewed 73
residents — many of them ranchers
and farmers — in Shasta County,
California, to find out how neigh
bors deal with the problem of beef
cattle roaming into planted

cropland.
"I'm trying to blend economics,
sociology and game theory to say
something systematic about the
reach of law — where it can have
influence and where it can't," he
said.
Ellickson was involved in and
wrote the preface for the much
quoted study, "Land Use and
Housing on the San Francisco
Peninsula," a 1983 publication of
the Stanford Environmental Law
Society..
Born and raised in Washington,
D.C., Ellickson graduated with
highest honors from Oberlin College
in 1963. He recieved his law degree
(LL.B) from Yale in 1966 and then
studied city planning for a year at
the Masssachusetts Institute of
Technology.
Ellickson was invited to Stanford
as a visiting professor in 1977 and
joined the Stanford faculty as a
tenured professor in 1981.
Rockefeller Grant
Londa Schiebinger, lecturer in
the Values, Technology, Science
and Society (VTSS) program, has

received a grant from the Rockefel
ler Foundation for the academic
year 1985-86 to complete her book,
"Women and the Origins of Modern
Science."
The grant comes from the
foundations new program aimed at
exploring long-term implications of
changing gender roles.
Schiebinger's work analyzes so
cial and intellectual dimensions of
gender roles in modern science by
investigating the circumstances
surrounding the participation of
women in early modern science.
Her book will focus on Europe in
the 17th and 18th centuries, when
modern norms of science and femi
ninity were being formed.
Schiebinger will travel to Paris,
Berlin, London and Leningrad to
complete research on her book.
She also will travel to the Bellagio
Conference in Italy in October,
where she will present a review of
the field of gender and science.
Schiebinger, who received a doc
torate in history from Harvard,
teaches in the Western Culture pro
gram and gives a course on
"Women, Science and Technol
ogy."

gram is to nurture development of
academic statesmanship among fac
ulty members by broadening their
understanding of the University's
goals, modes of governance and in
ternal and external relations.
The fellows meet regularly
during the academic year to discuss
these topics, often with guest
speakers. Faculty fellows also
receive five month's salary support
to pursue projects of their own
choosing, typically outside their
own academic discipline.
Law Professor
Robert Ellickson, 44, has been
named to the Robert E. Paradise
Professorship in Natural Resources
Law.
"Bob Ellickson is one of the
preeminent scholars of land use law
in the United States," said Dean of
the Law School John Ely, in a Sept.
10 report to the Board of Trustees.
"He has also proven to be an un
commonly effective and popular
teacher."
Most of Ellickson's articles apply

economic analysis to land and prop
erty rights issues. His writings on
homeowners associations, nuisance
law and land development controls
are cited in leading case books used
in American law schools.
Ellickson's scholarly interests
also include the natural resources
law subjects of public lands, water
resources policy and land taxation.
He is currently investigating how
neighbors deal with such potential
issues as trespass by livestock.
"Lawyers tend to thnk that law is
always the most important instru
ment of social control, but it's clear
from fieldwork that I and others
have done that this is not always
true," Ellickson said recently.
"Major domains of human activity
are beyond the reach of law. Lan
downers are often more influenced
by their notions about how good
neighbors should act than by what
the law is."
An advocate of field research, El
lickson personally interviewed 73
residents — many of them ranchers
and farmers — in Shasta County,
California, to find out how neigh
bors deal with the problem of beef
cattle roaming into planted

cropland.
"I'm trying to blend economics,
sociology and game theory to say
something systematic about the
reach of law — where it can have
influence and where it can't," he
said.
Ellickson was involved in and
wrote the preface for the much
quoted study, "Land Use and
Housing on the San Francisco
Peninsula," a 1983 publication of
the Stanford Environmental Law
Society..
Born and raised in Washington,
D.C., Ellickson graduated with
highest honors from Oberlin College
in 1963. He recieved his law degree
(LL.B) from Yale in 1966 and then
studied city planning for a year at
the Masssachusetts Institute of
Technology.
Ellickson was invited to Stanford
as a visiting professor in 1977 and
joined the Stanford faculty as a
tenured professor in 1981.
Rockefeller Grant
Londa Schiebinger, lecturer in
the Values, Technology, Science
and Society (VTSS) program, has

received a grant from the Rockefel
ler Foundation for the academic
year 1985-86 to complete her book,
"Women and the Origins of Modern
Science."
The grant comes from the
foundations new program aimed at
exploring long-term implications of
changing gender roles.
Schiebinger's work analyzes so
cial and intellectual dimensions of
gender roles in modern science by
investigating the circumstances
surrounding the participation of
women in early modern science.
Her book will focus on Europe in
the 17th and 18th centuries, when
modern norms of science and femi
ninity were being formed.
Schiebinger will travel to Paris,
Berlin, London and Leningrad to
complete research on her book.
She also will travel to the Bellagio
Conference in Italy in October,
where she will present a review of
the field of gender and science.
Schiebinger, who received a doc
torate in history from Harvard,
teaches in the Western Culture pro

"Women, Science and Technol
ogy."

Jones, who works in the field of
immunology research, was named
the first woman recipient of the
Texas Instruments Foundation's
Founders' Prize in 1983. She was

proteins called histocompatibility
antigens that occur on the surface
of white blood cells and are respon

foreign substances.
