Beyond War, a nationwide apolitical organiza
tion working toward building a "world without
war, is receiving increased student interest at
Stanford this year, according to junior Dave
Ramos, a volunteer for the non-profit organiza
tion.
Over 200 students signed a telephone/mailing
list for the group, Ramos said. Last year, the
group on campus had less than 30 members, in
cluding faculty and staff.
In 1982, Beyond War evolved out of the Crea
tive Initiative Foundation, an educational group
co-founded in the '60s by Harry Rathbun, profes
sor emeritus at Stanford Business School.
The organization was formed as the result of
Creative Initiative workers reading Jonathon
Schell's "The Fate of the Earth," seeing "The
Last Epidemic," a Physicians for Social Respon
sibility film and realizing that the vital issue in
today's world is the prevention of nuclear war,
according to Diana Lindsay, director of
Children's Dance and the Beyond War coordina
tor here.
Nationally headquartered in Palo Alto, with
branch offices in Portland, Denver and Glendale,
Beyond War has spread to 24 states and six
foreign countries during the past three years.
Beyond War officials say the group has 47 full
time and 74 part-time workers in the national of
fice, with 400 full-time workers and 8,000 active
supporters worldwide. All workers, except the
director and the accountant, are volunteers.
Less than 2.5 percent of the non-profit organiza
tion's yearly budget of $2 million is used for
salaries. Sixty-six percent of Beyond War's
income is from individuals.
Beyond War believes that the solution to the
nuclear threat is to educate people about the
reasons for war's existence. It also teaches them
how to change their mode of thinking and resolve

conflicts non-violently, rather than aggressively,
said Jim Davis, a graduate student in applied
earth sciences.
"A world beyond war is possible only if we
make a personal commitment to live our lives in
accordance with the new mode of thinking,"
states the handbook published by Creative Initia
tive.
The focus of the "new mode of thinking" is
that war is obsolete, according to Electrical En
gineering Prof. Martin Hellman.
The handbook continues, "The personal impli
cations inherent in the decision to adopt the new
mode of thinking can be summarized as follows:
"I resolve conflict. I do not use violence. I
maintain a spirit of goodwill. I do not preoccupy
myself with an enemy. I work with others to
build a world beyond war."

'I resolve conflict. I do not use violence. I maintain a
spirit of goodwill. I do not preoccupy myself with an
enemy. I work with others to build a world beyond
war.'

Linda Piano, a doctoral candidate in material
sciences and engineering and the public relations
chairman for Beyond War's campus group, em
phasized the need for both self-responsibility and
working together to create a world in which war
is recognized as obsolete.
Hellman expressed Beyond War's belief in the
world's interconnectedness: "We are one. We're
going to live together or die together."
Hellman said he decided to take an 18-month
leave of absence to volunteer full time at the na
tional Beyond War office after realizing he had
only two choices: either a world beyond war or
no world at all. Hellman is to return from his
leave in January.
Hellman stressed that he has to do all he can

because "if we continue having wars we're going
to blow ourselves up."
He says he hopes to see some results from
the Beyond War movement within two to four
years.
Although the group differs from other anti
nuclear organizations in that it does not involve
either protesting or lobbying, workers hope the
Beyond War philosophy will have some effect on
the 1988 elections, Ramos said.
The organization's handbook states that once
5 percent of the population believes in a new
idea, that idea becomes embedded in society.
Once 20 percent of the population believe in a
new idea, the spread of that idea becomes un
stoppable. Beyond War hopes this process of so
cial change will occur with their philosophy re
garding war, according to the handbook.

Beyond War does not discourage its workers
from joining other more political organizations as
long as the group is non-violent in working for
peace, Ramos said.
The organization's primary goal on campus
this year is to attract more members, especially
faculty, staff and international students. The
group may also begin a SWOPSI course,
speaker's bureau and awareness week, as well
as co-sponsoring events with other related or
ganizations on campus.
The Beyond War group at Columbia Univer
sity recently began a national college newsletter
to circulate among the Beyond War groups at
Stanford, UC-Davis, Yale, University of lowa
and University of Santa Clara.
