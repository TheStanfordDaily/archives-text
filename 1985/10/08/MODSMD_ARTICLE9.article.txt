# Union Advances Wage Proposals
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Staff writer 
In a "big move to break the
deadlocked negotiations" with
the University, United Stanford
Workers yesterday offered its
salary proposals for the second
year of a two-year contract, ac
cording to a USW press release.
University officials, speaking
at Wilbur Hall, were less im
pressed with USW's latest offer.
"Overall it's not reasonable,"
said Priscilla Wheeler, staff coun
sel and chief negotiator.
According to Mary Ann
Tenuto, chief union negotiator,
the USW proposals made yester
day are a breakthrough in the
talks because the union originally
wanted to ensure improvements
in layoff rights and job security
before negotiating a second
year. Last Thursday, the union
agreed to present economic
proposals for a two-year con
tract.
The union's proposals for the
second year of a new contract
center around an 8 percent wage
increase, adjustments in salary
classifications and increased in
surance coverage.
Spreading the salary classifica
tion adjustments over the two
year period would lower the cost
of the first year of the contract,
Tenuto said.

But using yesterday's offer,
the first year would still mean a
12.5 percent increase of the Uni
versity's $33 million dollar wage
costs and a 9 percent increase in
the second year, according to
Tenuto.
University officials said they
were unimpressed with the pro
posal, which is far from their of
fer of a 3 percent increase fol
lowed by a 2 percent increase.
In the area of health insur
ance, the union originally wanted
the University to provide
workers and their dependents
with either complete coverage
under the Kaiser Health Plan or
$106.37 to spend on more ex
pensive programs, Tenuto said.
Under yesterday's proposal,
the union's original offer would
serve for the first year. In the
second year, the workers would
choose between complete
coverage under the Kaiser
Health Plan and $126, Tenuto
said. The increase is to offset in
flation, she added.
Wheeler said the health insur
ance proposal was not a
breakthrough.
Tenuto said the negotiations
are entering into a new phase.
The University and the union
"are beginning to assess what
we can live with, not what we
want," she said.
The two sides have agreed to
meet again tomorrow.
