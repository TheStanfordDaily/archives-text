# Buildings To Modify University
## 
### DAVID SCHWARTZ 
The beginning of the school year
brought back a few things taken for
granted at Stanford: students,
bikes and campus construction.
Building projects at the school
over the past few years have
reached a feverish pace which has
molded the appearance of the
school significantly.
Spearheading the building cam
paign into the upcoming decade is a
recently authorized $135.9 million
loan from the California Educational
Facilities Authority (CEFA), which
will enable the University to begin
10 major projects across the
campus.
The projects will include Near
West Campus Development ($35
million), graduate student housing
($3O milion), the Center for
Molecular and Genetic Medicine
(CMGM) and Research Animal
Facility (RAP) II ($2O million), and a
Graduate School of Business ex
pansion ($l6 million).
But that is not all.
Also planned are a Near West
campus laboratory building ($7.6
million), a Medical School office
building ($5.2 million), a parking
structure ($3.4 million), the Aca
demic Resources Center ($2.5 mil
lion), the Environmental Safety
Facility ($2.4 million) and the Am
bulatory Surgical Center ($1.5 mil
lion).
William Massy, vice-president for
Business and Finance, said the loan
authorization was requested by the
Board of Trustees because of
Reagan Administration proposals to
eliminate tax-exempt bonds for
private colleges and universities.
Partial repayment of the loan has
been planned. Graduate housing
will be financed with room and
board fees, and the Business
School/CMGM loans will be repaid
on a short-term basis pending
private donations. Although plans
foi both the projects and the loan
appear to be definite, changes will
be made if the loan's effective date
is delayed past Jan. 1.
The building plans themselves
are to have a great effect on the
University in terms of both its
quality and appearance. The largest
of the plans is the $250 million
redevelopment of the science and
engineering departments in the
Near West Campus. The plan entails
tearing down and rebuilding
facilities in a 41-acre area, enough
space to entirely encompass the
Quad or an average urban univer
sity.
The plan has been hailed as "the
most ambitious building program
since the founding of the Univer
sity" by University President
Donald Kennedy and is expected
to relieve crowded conditions in the
facilities.
The business school expansion is
to consist of a new building named
after San Francisco business execu
tive Edward Littlefield. It is being
built to enlarge office space and of
fer greater instructional flexibility.
The GSB recently received a
$1.5 million challenge grant from
the Kresge Foundation which, ac
cording to Dean Robert Jaedicke,
"will surely be a major stimulus in

our efforts to raise the additional
funding for the building project."
The new construction comes on
the heels of extensive building
which has been completed only
recently. Since 1982, renovation
has taken place at the Quad, the
Athletic Department, Cubberley
Auditorium, Tresidder Union and
the Clock Tower. New projects
have created such buildings as
Braun Music Center, Sterling
Quad, the Center for Integrated
Studies and the Hospital Moder
nization Project.
Despite this great amount of
building, the University likely will
build even more during its Centen
nial years and beyond, campus plan
ners said.
