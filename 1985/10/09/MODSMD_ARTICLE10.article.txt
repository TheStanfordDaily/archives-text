All columnists should report at 4
p.m. Thursday to The Daily offices
for picture retakes. Also, happy
hour will be Friday at 5 p.m.
The entire staff of The Daily was
appalled when Eid showed up for
work yesterday wearing a heavy

bandage on his left knee.
The injury apparently involves
masticatory damage to the knee.
It is a well-known fact that Eid
runs four or five miles a day, "just
to keep in shape."
"A knee that can stand the
pounding of jogging should be able
to take anything," said one editor.
