### JOHN CALLON 
Members of the Baha'i faith gathered at Tresidder
Union last night to commemorate the visit of Abdu'l-
Baha to the Stanford campus 78 years ago.
The program included songs and prayers recited in
three languages in addition to a short speech address
ing the circumstances and substance of the former
Baha'i leader's 1912 appearance at the University.
During a tour of North America, Abdu'l-Baha was
invited to Stanford by David Starr Jordan, the Univer
sity's president at the time. He spoke before approxi
mately 1,800 students, urging them to "attain ex
traordinary progress in this center of education" in an
effort to flood "the dark regions and recesses of ignor
ance with illumination."
The central principles of the Baha'i faith emphasize
the oneness of mankind and the conception of religious
differences as a "progressive revelation."
"Baha'is believe each religion is given to humankind
from God as part of a progressive plan," said senior
Lisa Johnson, a newly declared member of the faith.
"Each (religion) teaches the universal truths, along
with social laws."
Junior Terry Mahony, another member of the faith,
said, "All the great religions come from one god. The
prophets, like Buddha and Jesus, have taught the same

ess^ n,i ' 1 ' only the social teachings have
changed according to when and where they (the prop
hets) were born."
Bill Davis, chairman of the Baha'i National Assem
bly's Committee on Social and Economic Develop
ment, called Abdu'l-Baha's life "an exemplary one,"
and spoke of the leader's commitment to world peace
and social development. In an emotional address,
Davis emphasized the faith's tolerance of diversity,
emphasizing that the religion is not monolithic.
"It tolerates, encourages and appreciates differ
ences. We consider diversity our strength."
Davis told listeners that "social and economic devel
opment begins in the heart of every individual. We
must dedicate ourselves to building a new world order
. . . on principles of love, acceptance and equality."
The Stanford Baha'i Association, which sponsored
the event, is planning a conference on world peace for
next spring or summer.
Abdu'l-Baha was the son of the prophet Baha'u'llah,
who founded the faith in Iran in 1854. Abdu'l-Baha
passed the responsibilty of interpreting the prophet's
writings to his son.
Jacobson said she picked up a book in the Stanford
Bookstore, and it happened to be an introduction to the
Baha'i faith. "It all clicked," she said. "I had been trying
to find a way to work towards peace. I began question
ing things in the outside world. "
