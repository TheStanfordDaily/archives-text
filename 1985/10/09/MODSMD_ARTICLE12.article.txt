When the Department of Energy (DOE) recently
proposed policy changes that would have forced
Stanford and other institutions to accept classified
research, University President Donald Kennedy
properly called the move "outlandish." For the Uni
versity to carry out — much less be forced to carry
out — secret research not only would violate its
commitment not to accept such work but also would
undermine its role as an institution based upon the
free exchange of ideas.
Calling its proposal a "clarification" of existing
policy, the DOE suggested that any research insti
tution taking its contracts be compelled to accept
"any work assignments which fall within the general
scope of the contract for work of a national defense
nature, whether such work is classified or unclas
sified. " For the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) and other institutions that are funded by the
government, but otherwise are operated indepen
dently, the proposal seemed more like a complete
reversal of the DOE's position. SLAC and other
DOE contractors that refuse to carry out classified
research — yet depend heavily on government
funding — were alarmed. Only after objections from

the scientific community did the DOE decide to
reconsider the policy change.
Faculty and students realized that classified re
search has no place at Stanford in the late '60s when
they pressured the University to phase out its se
cret research and adopt a policy forbidding the ac
ceptance of such work. The University reaffirmed
this belief again last week when Kennedy said the
DOE "ought not, with the mere stroke of the pen,
attempt to negate fundamental academic policies
dealing with openness in research."
An institution that claims, on the one hand, to
promote discussion, academic curiosity and debate
of ideas cannot, on the other hand, carry out re
search in secret.
The DOE seems to have forgotten that it was the
free exchange of ideas that led to the technological
advances of the past few decades. The govern
ment's effort to limit scientists' right to conduct
open research was, in effect, a move to "bite the
hand that feeds it." As Kennedy pointed out, once
the government spends its time keeping track of its
secrets, it loses its innovative momentum.
