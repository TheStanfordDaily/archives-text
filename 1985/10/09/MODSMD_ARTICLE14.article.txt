# In Search of Happiness at Stanford
## 
### 
Happiness. It's what we're all here for,
whether we recognize it or not. We all hope that
Stanford will teach us something that will make
us happy in this world. Whether we hope it will
teach us a skill that will make us lots of money or
are satisfied with teaching others what we know,
we all hope to learn through Stanford a secret to
happiness.
As we journey through our Stanford years,
most of us search deep in our souls for our own
personal formula for happiness. Yet because our
classroom experience never formally addresses

happiness and instead gives us formulas for
chemical compounds, our search usually gets
fogged in by the incredible complexity of our so
ciety and all the possible roles we can play in it.
So instead of constantly sidestepping what we've
all come here to learn, I've decided to write an
essay about it.
Late the other night I was up reading for an
anthropology class. The reading described the
primitive culture of a tribe in the Amazon forest
of Brazil. The tribe didn't know that the rest of
the world even existed. From their point of
view, the world was flat, the sky was a ceiling,
bee hives dipped in honey were a delicacy, hal
lucinogenic drugs were standard fare and the
demons of the forest controlled the weather.
Now this type of existence doesn't sound very

fun to me, but the point of the article was that
the tribe had adapted to its environment and
lived a happy and comfortable life.
After reading this I felt guilty. This tribe was
as happy living with next to nothing as I was
living with next to everything. This tribe's happi
ness was not tied to constant advancement of
their technology and culture. They desired little
more than their simple existence. It made me
wonder if this complex culture that we live in has
made us any happier over time. Man has ad
vanced materially since the beginning of history,
yet is he any happier?
Well, I didn't wonder about this for too long, be
cause soon I fell asleep and began to dream. In
the dream, I walked down to the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center for a seminar on
resume writing, or "How to put a Porsche body
on a Volkswagen engine." Instead of my ex
pected seminar a man at the front door in a grey
flannel suit and red tie handed me a T-shirt and a
pair of running shoes. On the T-shirt was written
"The Real World Rat Race — Two Miles." I put
it on because the man in the grey flannel suit told
me to, but I became very upset because I didn't
want to get all sweaty before my 10 o'clock
class.
All of a sudden a gun went off, and hordes of
people were running very fast around me. Afraid
of being trampled in the rush and wondering
what everyone was running after, I began to run
too. I had a hard time keeping up, and the hordes
kept passing me. My chest and legs soon ached;
I stumbled and fell off the track. To my surprise,
I could see from the inside of the track that
everyone was running around in a circle, passing
each other, and it was impossible to tell who was
leading or who was behind. Crying out to them
that they weren't getting anywhere, I woke up in
a cold sweat.

Well I was glad it was just a dream, because I
don't really think the real world is really the race
that it's made out to be. You see, our society
operates on an idea that we will be happier if we
have more. We're implicitly taught to feel
deprived and think we need what we don't have.
We never seem to get any happier by achieving
more, but we're afraid we'll be unhappy if we
don't stay up with the hordes. But just as my
dream was only a dream, the idea that we need
more to make us happy is only a myth.
We can all learn a lesson about happiness by
forgetting this myth and realizing that we can
be happy with what we have right now. Once we
think we'll be happier with more than we cur
rently have, we take the first step in an endless
race.
We have a choice whether to be happy or not.
If people in the Amazon can be as happy as we
can, happiness is not tied to any material ad
vancement. Happiness stems from our internal
perspective on the world, not our external posi
tion in it. Success is getting what your want, but
happiness is wanting what you get.
We at Stanford are some of the richest people
in a very rich country. We are heralded as some
of the most knowledgeable people in the world.
The lifestyle we live, the goals we set and the
way we pursue happiness will be examples to
other people throughout our lives.
It is up to us to destroy the myth. If we con
tinue the race, we will commit a crime of con
sciousness against the rest of the world. In
stead, if we count our blessings and find happi
ness with what we have, we will smash the myth
against the rocks of our wisdom and make the
world a happier place for all.

more than their simple existence. It made me
wonder if this complex culture that we live in has
made us any happier over time. Man has ad
vanced materially since the beginning of history,
yet is he any happier?
Well, I didn't wonder about this for too long, be
cause soon I fell asleep and began to dream. In
the dream, I walked down to the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center for a seminar on
resume writing, or "How to put a Porsche body
on a Volkswagen engine." Instead of my ex
pected seminar a man at the front door in a grey
flannel suit and red tie handed me a T-shirt and a
pair of running shoes. On the T-shirt was written
"The Real World Rat Race — Two Miles." I put
it on because the man in the grey flannel suit told
me to, but I became very upset because I didn't
want to get all sweaty before my 10 o'clock
class.
All of a sudden a gun went off, and hordes of
people were running very fast around me. Afraid
of being trampled in the rush and wondering
what everyone was running after, I began to run
too. I had a hard time keeping up, and the hordes
kept passing me. My chest and legs soon ached;
I stumbled and fell off the track. To my surprise,
I could see from the inside of the track that
everyone was running around in a circle, passing
each other, and it was impossible to tell who was
leading or who was behind. Crying out to them
that they weren't getting anywhere, I woke up in
a cold sweat.

Well I was glad it was just a dream, because I
don't really think the real world is really the race
that it's made out to be. You see, our society
operates on an idea that we will be happier if we
have more. We're implicitly taught to feel
deprived and think we need what we don't have.
We never seem to get any happier by achieving
more, but we're afraid we'll be unhappy if we
don't stay up with the hordes. But just as my
dream was only a dream, the idea that we need
more to make us happy is only a myth.
We can all learn a lesson about happiness by
forgetting this myth and realizing that we can
be happy with what we have right now. Once we
think we'll be happier with more than we cur
rently have, we take the first step in an endless
race.
We have a choice whether to be happy or not.
If people in the Amazon can be as happy as we
can, happiness is not tied to any material ad
vancement. Happiness stems from our internal
perspective on the world, not our external posi
tion in it. Success is getting what your want, but
happiness is wanting what you get.
We at Stanford are some of the richest people
in a very rich country. We are heralded as some
of the most knowledgeable people in the world.
The lifestyle we live, the goals we set and the
way we pursue happiness will be examples to
other people throughout our lives.
It is up to us to destroy the myth. If we con
tinue the race, we will commit a crime of con
sciousness against the rest of the world. In
stead, if we count our blessings and find happi
ness with what we have, we will smash the myth
against the rocks of our wisdom and make the
world a happier place for all.

Happiness. It's what we're all here for,
whether we recognize it or not. We all hope that
Stanford will teach us something that will make
us happy in this world. Whether we hope it will
teach us a skill that will make us lots of money or
are satisfied with teaching others what we know,
we all hope to learn through Stanford a secret to
happiness.
As we journey through our Stanford years,
most of us search deep in our souls for our own
personal formula for happiness. Yet because our
classroom experience never formally addresses

happiness and instead gives us formulas for
chemical compounds, our search usually gets
fogged in by the incredible complexity of our so
ciety and all the possible roles we can play in it.
So instead of constantly sidestepping what we've
all come here to learn, I've decided to write an
essay about it.
Late the other night I was up reading for an
anthropology class. The reading described the
primitive culture of a tribe in the Amazon forest
of Brazil. The tribe didn't know that the rest of
the world even existed. From their point of
view, the world was flat, the sky was a ceiling,
bee hives dipped in honey were a delicacy, hal
lucinogenic drugs were standard fare and the
demons of the forest controlled the weather.
Now this type of existence doesn't sound very

fun to me, but the point of the article was that
the tribe had adapted to its environment and
lived a happy and comfortable life.
After reading this I felt guilty. This tribe was
as happy living with next to nothing as I was
living with next to everything. This tribe's happi
ness was not tied to constant advancement of
their technology and culture. They desired little
more than their simple existence. It made me
wonder if this complex culture that we live in has
made us any happier over time. Man has ad
vanced materially since the beginning of history,
yet is he any happier?
Well, I didn't wonder about this for too long, be
