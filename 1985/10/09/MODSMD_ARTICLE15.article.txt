## 'Stanford and South Africa' Book Not Objective 
### 
Stanford University has put out a new publica
tion. It is called "Stanford and South Africa." I
think the title sums it up very well. It is soon to
become a bestseller on the campus, for with its
glossy cover, fancy typesetting and the distribu
tion of thousands of free copies, the University
can't miss. In this manifesto, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy deals with the "complex"
issue of apartheid and its implications and the
issue of divestment.
One could raise a lot of questions about the

VIEWPOINT

way "facts" are presented in this booklet. For
example, in the section on the history of South
Africa, it is not mentioned that "the parliamen
tary franchise extended to Asians and coloreds"
was in fact boycotted by almost 90 percent of
this population, in spite of a massive effort by the
Pretoria regime to coerce them to participate.
The United Democratic Front was formed
precisely in opposition to such sham "reform."
This might be a minor detail to some, but it is an
important fact to others. And that is exactly my
point.
The University administration wants to be
above the issue itself. This University-sponsored
publication wants to be educational and
"objective." But the administration finally has to
see that it is taking a side on this issue. Presi
dent Kennedy de facto has taken a position,
whether he likes it or not. No decision on divest
ment is in fact a decision to continue investing
Stanford University money, through corpora
tions, into the apartheid system of South Africa.
This latest University booklet is wrong in its
premises. A true commitment to objectivity

would require an exchange of truly divergent
views on an issue. The University administra
tion, being a partisan, cannot pretend to be im
partial. This shows an unfortunate compromise
of intellectual integrity on the part of the admin
istration. I would like to propose that the Univer
sity publish another booklet and solicit other
points of view.
In the "Stanford and South Africa" publication,
the arguments for and against divestment are
presented in a clear way. The arguments for in
vestment being on one page and against on the
next. It is very nice of the administration to try
to spell out exactly what we are discussing and
to try to put forth all the arguments on both sides
so that everyone in the community can digest it
and make up his mind accordingly. But again, it
is interesting to note how selective they are in
doing this. Here, I shall just offer one additional
argument for divestment. To me it is important,
in fact essential, to the debate going on, but
somehow it was neglected or omitted in Ken
nedy's analysis.
An argument for divestment is that African
leaders have called for it. This by itself should be
sufficient grounds for divestment. Ken
nedy flew out to Los Angeles last spring to meet
with Bishop Desmond Tutu, in what was seen by
many as a betrayal to an ongoing joint effort by
his office and Stanford Out of South Africa to get
Tutu to come to Stanford. We never heard any
thing about his discussion with Tutu. What did
the bishop say? We would still like to know.
The University publication concedes that Nel
son Mandela is the leader in South Africa with
the most support. It, however, neglects to
mention that he has called for complete dis
engagement from the South African state.

Despite a law forbidding the call for divestment,
every responsible African leader has called on
the international community for economic sanc
tions and particularly divestment. Polls among
the people of South Africa also indicate their
strong support for divestment. This is an essen
tial ingredient to any discussion on divestment.
In the past, colonial powers have tried to de
termine the destiny of Africans; they took on the
so called "white man's burden." It would be dis
ingenuous on our part to pursue this today and
take upon ourselves this discredited and unin
vited burden. And it is scandalous for us to reap
profits from carrying this burden.
Today it is argued that change is inevitable,
but that only slow change will work. Surpris
ingly, the argument goes that only by
strengthening the economic basis for apartheid
will change be brought about. Somehow this
logic baffles me. If one defines apartheid as
fundamentally flawed and unjust, then it doesn't
make sense to try to perfect it. The majority in
South Africa will not accept crumbs of reform
from the minority regime. They need to partici
pate in redefining a government. For those who
wish to support change in South Africa there are
basically two ways to do it: support for the
liberation movement and economic and political
disengagement from the current Pretoria regime.
The time has come for all of us, including the
University and the corporations, to realize that
we are currently hindering the African people in
their effort to realize progress and justice in their
land. And it is time for us to end our complicity in
this hindrance. Because, to know and not to do,
is not to know.

thing about his discussion with Tutu. What did
the bishop say? We would still like to know.
The University publication concedes that Nel
son Mandela is the leader in South Africa with
the most support. It, however, neglects to
mention that he has called for complete dis
engagement from the South African state.

Despite a law forbidding the call for divestment,
every responsible African leader has called on
the international community for economic sanc
tions and particularly divestment. Polls among
the people of South Africa also indicate their
strong support for divestment. This is an essen
tial ingredient to any discussion on divestment.
In the past, colonial powers have tried to de
termine the destiny of Africans; they took on the
so called "white man's burden." It would be dis
ingenuous on our part to pursue this today and
take upon ourselves this discredited and unin
vited burden. And it is scandalous for us to reap
profits from carrying this burden.
Today it is argued that change is inevitable,
but that only slow change will work. Surpris
ingly, the argument goes that only by
strengthening the economic basis for apartheid
will change be brought about. Somehow this
logic baffles me. If one defines apartheid as
fundamentally flawed and unjust, then it doesn't
make sense to try to perfect it. The majority in
South Africa will not accept crumbs of reform
from the minority regime. They need to partici
pate in redefining a government. For those who
wish to support change in South Africa there are
basically two ways to do it: support for the
liberation movement and economic and political
disengagement from the current Pretoria regime.
The time has come for all of us, including the
University and the corporations, to realize that
we are currently hindering the African people in
their effort to realize progress and justice in their
land. And it is time for us to end our complicity in
this hindrance. Because, to know and not to do,
is not to know.

Stanford University has put out a new publica
tion. It is called "Stanford and South Africa." I
think the title sums it up very well. It is soon to
become a bestseller on the campus, for with its
glossy cover, fancy typesetting and the distribu
tion of thousands of free copies, the University
can't miss. In this manifesto, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy deals with the "complex"
issue of apartheid and its implications and the
issue of divestment.
One could raise a lot of questions about the

VIEWPOINT

way "facts" are presented in this booklet. For
example, in the section on the history of South
Africa, it is not mentioned that "the parliamen
tary franchise extended to Asians and coloreds"
was in fact boycotted by almost 90 percent of
this population, in spite of a massive effort by the
Pretoria regime to coerce them to participate.
The United Democratic Front was formed
precisely in opposition to such sham "reform."
This might be a minor detail to some, but it is an
important fact to others. And that is exactly my
point.
The University administration wants to be
above the issue itself. This University-sponsored
publication wants to be educational and
"objective." But the administration finally has to
see that it is taking a side on this issue. Presi
dent Kennedy de facto has taken a position,
whether he likes it or not. No decision on divest
ment is in fact a decision to continue investing
Stanford University money, through corpora
tions, into the apartheid system of South Africa.
This latest University booklet is wrong in its
premises. A true commitment to objectivity

would require an exchange of truly divergent
views on an issue. The University administra
tion, being a partisan, cannot pretend to be im
partial. This shows an unfortunate compromise
of intellectual integrity on the part of the admin
istration. I would like to propose that the Univer
sity publish another booklet and solicit other
points of view.
In the "Stanford and South Africa" publication,
the arguments for and against divestment are
presented in a clear way. The arguments for in
vestment being on one page and against on the
next. It is very nice of the administration to try
to spell out exactly what we are discussing and
to try to put forth all the arguments on both sides
so that everyone in the community can digest it
and make up his mind accordingly. But again, it
is interesting to note how selective they are in
doing this. Here, I shall just offer one additional
argument for divestment. To me it is important,
in fact essential, to the debate going on, but
somehow it was neglected or omitted in Ken
nedy's analysis.
An argument for divestment is that African
leaders have called for it. This by itself should be
sufficient grounds for divestment. Ken
nedy flew out to Los Angeles last spring to meet
with Bishop Desmond Tutu, in what was seen by
many as a betrayal to an ongoing joint effort by
his office and Stanford Out of South Africa to get
Tutu to come to Stanford. We never heard any
thing about his discussion with Tutu. What did
the bishop say? We would still like to know.
