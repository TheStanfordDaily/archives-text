Too Little Choice
In Theme Dorms
I came on campus today for the
first time in a while — I had an
errand to do at the Bookstore —
and had a chance to read The
Daily. On the opinions page I read
a viewpoint letter on ethnic dorms,
a subject I am particularly inter
ested in since I was active in set
ting up "special dorms" at Stanford
when they began 15 years ago this
month.
Stanford, as a university trying
to teach analytical thought and
scholarship, seems to have failed
Kim Card, a Stanford senior and
the author of the letter. She
thinks it is right, proper and schol
arly to judge the research of John
Bunzel, who recently completed a
study on ethnic housing, based on
his academic affiliation with the
Hoover Institution and on news
reports of that research rather
than the original and easily
obtainable articles.
Card assumes that it is the fault
of fearful, white, anti-ethnic
stereotypes that Zapata is per
ceived as a "bad" place to live.
There are other strong possibili
ties: Zapata's location in Stern
Hall, the relative studiousness of
its residents, their consideration
for others in the Stern complex or
Zapata's very strong left-wing
culture.
It is a pity that Card's criticisms
of Bunzel are so biased and so
weak, because she raises two
valid points in support of maintain
ing or even expanding ethnic

f*
theme houses. First, most of the /
I
living situations on campus are,
effect, "white theme houses." Ans
second, in any theme house, a •'
certain critical mass of people >'
interested in the theme is neces
sary for the expression of a cul- jl
ture. ;;
Now the interesting thing about-;
"white theme houses" is the
latitude of choice: you can live in s
minimum social-interaction
non-violent, maximum social-inters
action groups; French or Italian
themes houses — the list goes on.
Minority cultures are as diverse in t
real life as white culture — but not.
in Stanford living groups. They are
represented by one lonely house \
per color.
Many white students and not a
few (perhaps a majority of)
minority students have avoided the
minority theme house experience. ;
Maybe if there were more choice ;
— more black or Latino or Asian
houses, the degree of true multi- i
cultural experience would increase.
Wouldn't it be great to have an
Asian house with a reputation for
wild parties or for focusing on
modern Japanese literature? And a
black house with a reputation for
being composed of 100 percent
pre-meds or for sponsoring very
conservative speakers on campus? |
And a Chicano house with a
reputation for being a great place !
for devout Catholic students, no
matter what nationality, to live or
for having the best Spanish lan
guage program on campus?
