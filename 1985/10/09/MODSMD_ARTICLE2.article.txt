# Coffee House Vote Delayed

### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff 
After lengthy debate last night, the
ASSU Senate voted 8-7 to overturn a bill
that would have denied further funding to
the now-defunct Coffee House, Inc. to
pay off its $43,000 debt.
The bill before the senate, if it had been
passed, would have directed that "no ad
ditional Association funds be used to
cover any of the liabilities of the Coffee
House, Inc." The ASSU has already
agreed to bear $30,000 of the Coffee
House's debt, according to Senate Chair
Carey White. He added that the bill's in
tent was to prevent the ASSU from
bearing more extensive losses.
In 1982, during a strike by United Stan
ford Workers (USW), the ASSU extended

credit to Coffee House, Inc. so that the
company could hire outside workers to
handle customer overload. Coffee House,
Inc. currently owes money to both the
ASSU and Tresidder Union.
"The Coffee House was just inundated
with students," said Council of
Presidents member Leslie Leland. "They
had to put in extra people to support the
students, so the ASSU gave them a loan
of $30,000 three years ago."
The issue under debate in the senate
was whether to extend additional funds to
Coffee House, Inc. in order to avoid trou
ble with Tresidder management, which
has demanded that the debts owed it by
Coffee House, Inc. be paid immediately,
White said.
The bill, authored by "half the senate,"
according to White, contended that the
ASSU has no obligation to help Coffee

House, Inc. pay off its debts. Pressure
was put on the ASSU to debate the obliga
tion in the first place because a Finance
Committee chair five years ago apparently
guaranteed that the ASSU would cover
the Coffee House's obligations â€” without
senate authorization.
The defunct corporation is expecting to
receive a state tax rebate of $90,000, but
the money could be delayed for up to a
year, according to Leland. In that light,
Leland questioned Tresidder's anxious
ness to collect the debt and the urgency of
the debate taking place in the senate,
which she attributed to the senate's fear
of a Tresidder lawsuit.
"Tresidder doesn't have a suit at all,"
she said.
Referring to the fact that Tresidder and
the Coffee House Committee (the ASSU


Janelle Page/Daily
eliminate the third paragraph from a bill regarding COP
administrative staff assistants.

Council of Presidents members Mike Collins and Leslie
Leland (with dog Kesey) vote on a measure that would
arm that handles the corporation)
are part of the same administrative
wing of the University, Leland said.
"Nobody's going to sue each other.
We're all going to try to work to
gether, and whatever assets we
have now, disperse them accord
ingly."
The bill to deny further funding
to the corporation was defeated by
the narrow 8-7 vote. After defeat
ing the first bill, the Senate voted 8-
1 to pass a resolution that will have
the COP shuttle the bill to the Ad
ministration and Rules Committee
to gather "legal advice" before a
final senate decision is made.
