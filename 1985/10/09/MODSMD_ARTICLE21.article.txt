## Bioreactors Use Capillary System Model 
### NIKO SCHIFF Editorial Staff 
Research into the potential of
large-scale bioreactors is under
way at Stanford. The research is
yielding exciting new information
about the behavior of biological cells
and the engineering of chemical re
actors using organic, rather than in
organic, chemical catalysts.
Channing Robertson, professor
of chemical engineering, and other
researchers in his lab are working
on the theoretical and practical
problems of growing cells in a
chemical reactor. The cells are then
used as small biological factories to
produce chemical products.
Large-scale chemical reactors
currently rely on inorganic chemical
catalysts, chemicals that facilitate
the reaction process. But for some
processes, biological catalysts
could be more efficient, explained
Robertson.
; In considering the use of
microbial catalysts (biological cells),
certain fundamental problems have
to be examined, according to
Robertson. He said that the ques
tion of whether microbial catalysis

of the process.
Bioreactors, chemical reactors
using microbial catalysts, have
some decided advantages over
large-scale industrial reactors. One
such advantage deals with the tem
peratures and pressures needed to
run them. While most industrial
processes utilize very high temper
atures and pressures to run their
reactions, bioreactors operate at
atmospheric pressure and sur
rounding temperature, said
Robertson.
In addition, microbial catalysts
have the advantage of being specifi
cally tailored by nature to be error
free factories, said Robertson.
Many biological products can be
specified if the right microbial
catalyst is used in this process.
Some microbial catalysts will actu
ally work faster than inorganic
catalysts, he added.
Unlike the fuel used in a chemical
reactor, which usually consists of
hydrocarbons, a bioreactor runs on
carbohydrates or other biological
products. This could also prove to
be cost efficient if these bioteactors
are used commercially.
According to Robertson, it is im
portant to consider the nature of a
reaction done in a reactor. As most
chemical processes are continuous,
the aim in the development of an ef
fective bioreactor is to be able to
develop a large-scale, continuous

microbial reactor, he said.
A continuous process requires
that a steady stream of feed goes
into the reactor and a steady
amount of product comes out.
Currently only industrial bever
age and pharmaceutical companies
use biological cells on a large-scale.
These reactions use batch process
ing that involves suspending cells in
big vats. This procedure is limited
by the size of the reactor and the
ability to maintain the careful
balances necessary for cell produc
tivity.
If too many cells are produced in
a vat, the result is basically sludge,
said Robertson. Nutrients must fil
ter down into the vats, and it is diffi
cult to carefully regulate the
amount different cells receive.
According to Robertson, when
examining a system such as batch
processing, the engineer must ask
whether or not this is the optimally
designed device. The optimal
chemical reactor that uses microbial
catalysts is the higher organism.
Thus the design of the bioreactor
emulates the organization of cell
processes in higher organisms.
"Everything in nature is an
oxidation-reduction machine of
some sort," he said. "It will take in
carbohydrate and oxygen and
combine them to make an oxidized

product."
The critical point in designing a
bioreactor is allowing the cells to
receive nutrients and distribute
their wasteproducts in a way such
that they are easily collected. The
model that Robertson's group is
pursuing is based on the capillary
system. In this system, a cell is not
farther from the nearest capillary it
needs for its survival.
The bioreactor uses modeled
"capillary tubes," which are semi
permeable hollow membranes. The
cells grow on the outside of the cy
lindrical membranes and receive
nutrients by diffusion through the
hollow inside of the membrane to
the cell-imbedded outer,walls.
The packaging of the cells in the
reactor is critical to the reactor's
efficiency. If cells can be packaged
into tight capillary tubes and ar
ranged in a spatially compact area,
then certain processes may become
cost efficient for these devices,

Robertson said.
There are many different reactor
configurations possible using the
hollow-fiber membranes, and this is
an area where Robertson's group is
doing basic research. This research
is aimed at making a leap in biotech
nology equivalent to the change
from the vacuum tube to the chip in
computer technology, according to
Robertson.
The tube's basic design allows
for nutrients to enter at one end,
where they are absorbed by the
membrane and diffuse into the
cells. The cells process certain
protein products and excrete them
as waste, which exits the other end
of the capillary tube. Given this
basic unit, there is a great deal of
flexibility in how the tubes can be
put together.
The bioreactor set up gives sci
entists a unique opportunity to cul
ture and watch bacteria, said
Robertson. The techniques used to
examine the well-being of cells are
the same type of non-invasive tech
niques used to research higher or
ganisms.

According to Robertson, the
typical probes previously used with
bioreactors were designed for the
vats used in batch processing. The
capillary tubes constitute a very dif
ferent system and need to be ex
amined using other methods.
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) is a technique gaining wide
application in the medical field. It is
one process used to test the well
being and metabolic processes of
these cells, said Robertson.
Using NMR, scientists are able
to trace the progress of a radioac
tive element through its incorpora
tion into different molecules. This
allows the scientist to measure the
rate of the reaction and study the
behavior of cells when they are
metabolizing.
Other non-invasive procedures
are used to study the efficiency of
the reactor, especially the arrange
ment of the cells. To test whether
or not the protein product is syn
thesized throughout the capillary,
Steven Karel, a researcher in
Robertson's lab, incorporates a ra
dioactive sulfur molecule into the

cell. He checks the uniformity of
cell production by taking small sec
tions of the capillary tube and
looking for regions without the sul
fur tag. The aim is to have no
regions in the reactor where
protein is not synthesized.
The cells are very closely
packed. The major question is what
imposes the upper limit on the num
ber of cells that can be contained at
high densities, according to Karel.
"We are learning things about cells
in an environment where basic sci
ence has not been done," he said.
"The bioreactor project is really
a group effort," said Robertson.
The merging of medical and chemi
cal engineering techniques is only
one aspect of the interdisciplinary
approach to this research.
The attitude amoung the lab re
searchers is very positive. Al
though immediate commercial ap
plications are not imminent, the ul
timate goal still is the creation of a
steady-state bioreactor, according
to Louis Sweeny, a researcher in
the lab. In addition, the research is
founding its own basic science.
