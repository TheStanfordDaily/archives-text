## Bioreactors Use Capillary System Model 
### NIKO SCHIFF Editorial Staff 
Research into the potential of
large-scale bioreactors is under
way at Stanford. The research is
yielding exciting new information
about the behavior of biological cells
and the engineering of chemical re
actors using organic, rather than in
organic, chemical catalysts.
Channing Robertson, professor
of chemical engineering, and other
researchers in his lab are working
on the theoretical and practical
problems of growing cells in a
chemical reactor. The cells are then
used as small biological factories to
produce chemical products.
Large-scale chemical reactors
currently rely on inorganic chemical
catalysts, chemicals that facilitate
the reaction process. But for some
processes, biological catalysts
could be more efficient, explained
Robertson.
; In considering the use of
microbial catalysts (biological cells),
certain fundamental problems have
to be examined, according to
Robertson. He said that the ques
tion of whether microbial catalysis

quires examining the behavior of
cells in the close confines of a
chemical reactor â€” and doing pure
research into the molecular biology

of the process.
Bioreactors, chemical reactors
using microbial catalysts, have
some decided advantages over
large-scale industrial reactors. One
such advantage deals with the tem
peratures and pressures needed to
run them. While most industrial
processes utilize very high temper
atures and pressures to run their
reactions, bioreactors operate at
atmospheric pressure and sur
rounding temperature, said
Robertson.
In addition, microbial catalysts
have the advantage of being specifi
cally tailored by nature to be error
free factories, said Robertson.
Many biological products can be
specified if the right microbial
catalyst is used in this process.
Some microbial catalysts will actu
ally work faster than inorganic
catalysts, he added.
Unlike the fuel used in a chemical
reactor, which usually consists of
hydrocarbons, a bioreactor runs on
carbohydrates or other biological
products. This could also prove to
be cost efficient if these bioteactors
are used commercially.
According to Robertson, it is im
portant to consider the nature of a
reaction done in a reactor. As most
chemical processes are continuous,
the aim in the development of an ef
fective bioreactor is to be able to
develop a large-scale, continuous

microbial reactor, he said.
A continuous process requires
that a steady stream of feed goes
into the reactor and a steady
amount of product comes out.
Currently only industrial bever
age and pharmaceutical companies
use biological cells on a large-scale.
These reactions use batch process
ing that involves suspending cells in
big vats. This procedure is limited
by the size of the reactor and the
ability to maintain the careful
balances necessary for cell produc
tivity.
If too many cells are produced in
a vat, the result is basically sludge,
said Robertson. Nutrients must fil
ter down into the vats, and it is diffi
cult to carefully regulate the
amount different cells receive.
According to Robertson, when
examining a system such as batch
processing, the engineer must ask
whether or not this is the optimally
designed device. The optimal
chemical reactor that uses microbial
catalysts is the higher organism.
Thus the design of the bioreactor
emulates the organization of cell
processes in higher organisms.
"Everything in nature is an
oxidation-reduction machine of
some sort," he said. "It will take in
carbohydrate and oxygen and
combine them to make an oxidized
