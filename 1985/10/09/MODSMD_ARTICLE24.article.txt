## Is Card Football Fired Up? Tempers flare and fists fly in Monday practice 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
There has been at least one positive result of
the Stanford football team's humiliating 41-22
loss to San Diego State Saturday. Judging from
this week's practices, the Cardinal is converting
!that embarrassment into intensity.
At Monday's session, Coach Jack Elway ran
the Cardinal through a 45-minute intrasquad
scrimmage, and according to one player, no less
than six fights broke out between teammates.
Things were a little quieter yesterday, as the
team began to make specific preparations for this
weekend's game with UCLA, but the attitude
remained the same.
Defensive Coordinator Dick Mannini wasn't
happy with the fighting, but he said he was very
pleased with the aggressiveness he has seen in
Stanford's play this week.
"Yeah, we had a couple (of fights)," he said.
"Tempers got a little strained, and that wasn't
good. But I was glad to see that we were so
doggone intense."
Intensity, or the lack of it, was a major prob
lem in the San Diego State game. The players
looked like they were more interested in going
back to their hotel and watching television than
blocking and tackling, and the score reflected it.

Elway was so incensed by the Cardinal's lack
luster play that he didn't even speak to the
players after the game or on Sunday. Then, on
Monday afternoon, he let them have it.
"In no uncertain terms, the players were told
by Coach Elway how he felt about Saturday's
performance," Mannini said. "And I think our
people listened, and listened hard."
"What upset me most was their lack of emo
tion," Elway said. "This has not been character
istic of this football team, and it's something I'm
disappointed in.
"I've said this before: I don't give a goddamn
how many mistakes you make as long as you
make them full-speed."
Mannini agreed. "When we see a lack of ag
gressiveness, it really hurts us," he said. "We're
a young team, and we have to be patient. But
sometimes even our own patience is tried."
Now Stanford's task is to maintain this new
found intensity throughout the week and to
bring it onto the field on Saturday. If the players
sleepwalk through the UCLA game, the Bruins
will simply tear the Cardinal apart.
Before the season, Elway picked UCLA to
win the Pacific-10 Conference championship, and
he hasn't seen anything that would make him
change that assessment. The Bruins stunned

defending national champion Brigham Young in
their opener, tied Tennessee and crushed San
Diego State before dropping a game to Washing
ton two weeks ago.
And last week, UCLA ripped through the for
midable Arizona State defense for 40 points and
its first Pac-10 victory. Stanford will have to play
far over its head to repeat last year's perfor
mance against the Bruins, a 23-20 upset in the
Rose Bowl.
"I'd like to see us not leave the intensity here
on the practice field," Mannini said. "We have to
keep it up for the rest of the week and reach our
peak on Saturday."
Elway was more positive in his predictions for
the UCLA game. "You can anticipate one thing,"
he said. "We're going to play emotionally and
physically and play a complete football game."
Card notes
Saturday's game will be UCLA's third straight
appearance on national television. CBS Sports
has decreed that the game will begin at 1:42
p.m.
The UCLA-Stanford series dates back to 1925
and has been uninterrupted since 1946. The last
few meetings between the teams have been
close, despite the obvious discrepancies in bowl
appearances and final Pac-10 standings.
