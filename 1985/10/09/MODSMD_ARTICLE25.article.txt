# Haines Sees a Super Season
## 
### MARY McDEVITT Staff writer 
Last April, women's swimming Coach George Haines agreed to
lecture at a national YMCA swimming coaches convention in Newark,
N.J. But recently, when it came time for Haines to go, he didn't want to
leave his "babies" to attend the meeting.
"He's real excited," said Libby Kinkead, assistant coach and former
Olympic swimmer.
"He's only missing two workouts, but he feels like he's going to be
gone for a week and a half, because all his babies are in the water."
The 26-member team, which includes 16 freshmen (one of the larg
est groups of freshmen ever), began practices on Sept. 26.
Haines said this was the best recruiting year he could remember.
I am really excited about the season because, of all the freshmen I
have, 11 out of the 16 have placed in the finals or consolation finals at
the U.S. Nationals," Haines said.
"That's a lot of scoring," he added.
Haines said the season, which opens with preliminary meets Nov. 2,
will be competitive.
As it was in last year's NCAAs, Texas, Florida and Stanford should
battle for the top three places this season. In 1985 the Card was third,
placing behind national champion Texas and runner-up Florida.
The freshman team members unequivocally said their goal is to win
the national title.
"I'm really excited," said backstroke specialist Jenny Shannon. "I ex
pect a lot, because we have a lot of potential.
"I'm sure I have the same goal as everyone else does — to win
NCAAs. Pretty much everyone I talked to said we can do it."
Freshman Jenna Johnson agreed. "Our first goal is to get in shape,
but our main goal is to win NCAAs."
Like Haines, the upperclassmen — who know firsthand the for
midability of the Texas and Florida teams — speak less explicitly of
their goals than do the rookies. But some of the seniors who remember
winning the title their freshman year liken this year's team to that 1983
squad.
"I am much more optimistic than last season, because we have so
much more (this year)," said senior Diana Zock, one of the the team's
co-captains.
"I think the year that we won (the national title) I felt like we were
pulled by the upperclassmen and pushed by the freshmen. And it is the
same now. We are pulled by the experience of the upperclassmen, but
pushed by the enthusiasm and talent of the freshmen."
Kinkead also senses a sort of optimistic deja vu. "Both years we won
(1980 and 1983) were when we had big freshman classes — and this is
the biggest freshman class ever," she said.
Despite losing three swimmers and one diver to graduation last year,
the Cardinal looks strong in all events this season. Haines finds it hard
to distinguish the team's strengths and weaknesses.
"We have people in every stroke and distance. Just adding (freshman
sprinters) Jenna Johnson and Aimee Berzins makes us a completely dif
ferent team," he said. "It gives us an overall strength that we didn't
have last year."
American record holder and 1984 Olympic silver medalist Susan
Rapp, a junior who was red-shirted last year with knee injuries, will un
doubtedly also add strength to the team, provided she stays healthy.

Rapp, whose knees are healing steadily, may be the key to Stanford's
success this season, Haines said.
"If everything goes right, Susie can be the catalyst," Haines said.
"She's a great leader, and she's going to be a big shock. She still has
three years of eligibility left."
Haines said Stanford shouldn't have to redshirt anyone due to injuries
this season — as it did last year — although senior individual medley
and backstroker Patty Gavin suffered a broken elbow this summer, and
freshman breaststroker Bethanne Lambert is out for the quarter with a
neck injury.
