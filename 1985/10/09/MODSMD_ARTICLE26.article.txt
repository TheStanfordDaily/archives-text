# Koch: 'We're on a roll'
## Stanford Soccer Ready for SJS 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
Stanford Coach Sam Koch enters today's 3
p.m. home contest against Pacific Soccer Con
ference rival San Jose State with mixed feelings.
The first is optimism.
"We're on a roll," Koch said. "We played great
this weekend (at the Metropolitan Pacific Classic
in Los Angeles). Everyone moved well without
the ball, we looked up for passes, and we jelled
the best we have all season."
But Koch is also a little worried.

"This is the type of game that gives us trou
ble," the second-year coach said. "We should
win, but our players don't get up for the game.
At the same time, San Jose will be dying to beat
us."
Thanks to the momentum the Cardinal brings
back from L.A., Koch is not worrying about his
5-6-2 team too much. Stanford broke out of a
scoring slump Saturday and upset the Washing
ton Huskies 4-2.
And in the tournament final against UCLA on
Sunday, the Cardinal gave the nationally ranked
Bruins a scare before losing 2-1.

"The defense played fantastic in the second
half of the UCLA game," Koch said. "Phil Hor
vath and Neal Stephens were standouts."
That defense may be tested this afternoon by
a couple of San Jose State strikers. Scott Chase
and Ingi Ingason have 5 goals each for the 3-6-2
Spartans.
Cardinal goaltender Tom Austin will be
waiting for them. The vocal junior from Chadds
Ford, Penn., has recorded six shutouts and
allowed only 11 goals in 13 games for a 0.80
goals per game average.
The battle will take place on Harry Maloney
Field next to Sunken Diamond.
