# Hockey Comes Home
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff Writer 
It's nice to come home again.
For the first time this season,
Stanford's field hockey team will
get a chance to play on familiar
ground. "It's good to finally come
home . . . that will definitely be an
advantage," head Coach Sheryl
Johnson said.
The Cardinal will host Northern
Pacific Conference rival San Jose
State today at 4 p.m. on the hockey
field. The Spartans are 3-2-1 over
all on the season and 1-1-1 in Nor-
Pac competition. The Card is 1-3-1
overall, 0-1-1 in the conference.
.Last year, the teams played
twice, with San Jose winning both
matches, one by a 10-3 blowout.
"That is not a hockey score,"
Johnson said.
As proven by last week's NorPac
rankings, the story should be differ
ent this year. Stanford was No. 1;
San Jose was not ranked. This
week's poll has not yet been
released.
After two straight disappoint
ments — a 2-1 loss to Chico State
on Saturday and a tie with UOP a
week earlier — this first home
game will not be taken lightly by the
Cardinal. "I think the next couple
games are really important," co
captain Karen Chamberlain said.
Chamberlain said that the results

of the last two games "make us
much more hungry. I think we'll
wipe 'em out."
To do this, the Card is going to
have to start scoring more. After
Chico State, where Stanford's 28
shots resulted in only one goal, the
squad has been "working on more
scoring opportunities in practice,"
Johnson said. "We're sort of trying
to get the girls more used to
scoring."
Junior forward Maree Chung ex
emplifies the team's attitude
despite the tough going thus far. "I
feel very optimistic about the rest
of our games," she said.
Chung's exciting rushes down
the right sideline have been a
catalyst for the Cardinal offense, in
addition to giving her coaches some
near heart attacks throughout the
season.
Saturday's game proved to the
Card women that they are capable
of playing the way they want to,
something they weren't exactly
sure of after the frustration of the
UOP game.
The importance of the Cardinal
playing its brand of field hockey has
been stressed by the team's
coaches many times. Chamberlain,
a West Regional All-America last
year, said she thought the squad ac
complished that against Chico. "We
stuck to what we are supposed to
do," she said.

Though most of the Cardinal players are still smarting and
feuding over the loss to SDSU and Monday's 45-minute
practice scrimmage, defensive tackle Sean Scheller and line
coach Tony Samuel are only going through practice drills here.
