# Stieb Stops K.C.

### 
TORONTO (AP) — Dave Stieb
held Kansas City to three hits
through eight innings and the
Toronto Blue Jays, showcasing the
blend that brought them their first
ever division title, beat the Royals
6-1 last night in the first game of the
American League playoffs.
The Blue Jays, the AL East
champions in just their ninth
season, scored all their runs in the
first four innings and finished with
11 hits in the first AL postseason
game played outside the United
States.
The loss in the opener of the
best-of-seven series saddled
Kansas City Manager Dick Howser
with an 0-10 record in the
postseason as his Royals crumbled
under the Blue Jays' early mix of
speed, power and agressiveness.
Stieb shut out the Royals through
eight innings. Tom Henke, the Jays'
surprise bullpen star this season,
gave up two hits to lead off the
ninth, and Willie Wilson scored the
lone Kansas City run on a fielder's
choice.
The game featured the two start
ing pitchers who led the league in
earned run average. But while the
top-ranked Stieb, with a 2.48 ERA,
looked every bit the part, the Blue
Jays ripped Charlie Leibrandt and
sent him to his earliest exit of the
season.
Stieb, whose lack of run support
during the season produced a mis
leading 14-13 record, gave up a
two-out double to George Brett in
the first inning and a one-out single
by Brett in the fourth. A pinch-hit

double by Dane lorg in the eighth
ended a streak of 12 straight bat
ters retired by Stieb.
Stieb allowed only one other run
ner, on a walk to Pat Sheridan in
the fourth, and struck out eight.
The hard-throwing Stieb fanned
eight different Royals, all except
Sheridan, before Henke came in to
pitch the ninth.
The only trouble spot for Stieb,
in fact, came while he was warming
up to start the second, when a
young woman bolted out of the
right-field seats, ran to the mound
and hugged the startled pitcher.
Stieb did not seem shaken and
pitched a 1-2-3 inning.
Leibrandt, meanwhile, lasted just
two full innings and was driven from
the mound in the third with the
bases loaded and no outs. The Blue
Jays, who were 0-2 against
Leibrandt during the season, ripped
the 17-game winner for five runs on
seven hits.
Game 2 is scheduled for this af
ternoon, when Kansas City lefty
Bud Black, 10-15 during the regular
season, is scheduled to face Jimmy
Key, 14-6.
This was Kansas City's sixth
postseason appearance, compared
with the first for the Blue Jays. But
the Royals were the ones who
came unglued when pressured by
the Blue Jays.
Jesse Barfield led off the second
with a single and Willie Upshaw was
hit by a pitch, only the third batter
Leibrandt had hit this season. Garth
lorg followed with a fly ball that left
fielder Lonnie Smith dropped, but
Smith recovered quickly and threw
Barfield out at third.
Ernie Whitt then grounded a
seeing-eye single to right that
drove in Upshaw with the game's
first run, and Tony Fernandez fol
lowed with a single to deep short
that scored lorg. Damaso Garcia's
single loaded the bases and got
Steve Farr up quickly in the Kansas
City bullpen, but Leibrandt
managed to escape further damage.
He was- unable, however, to
survive the third.
Cliff Johnson opened with a
double into the right-center field al
ley and Barfield walked on a 3-2
pitch. When Upshaw singled to load

the bases again, Howser had seen
enough and brought in the right
handed Farr.
Lefty Ranee Mulliniks, batting for
the right-handed lorg, lined an RBI
single to center that made it 3-0.
Farr then walked Whitt, forcing
home another run, and Fernandez
lined a drive to right for a sacrifice
and a five-run lead.
The Blue Jays' aggressiveness
produced another run in the fourth
inning.
George Bell, a slugger with
speed, led off with a single. Johnson
hit a slow grounder that shortstop
Buddy Biancalana charged and
threw to first for the out, but Bell
kept running and took off for third.
First baseman Steve Balboni
delayed for a moment before
throwing far over Brett's head at
third base, allowing Bell to trot
home.

TORONTO (AP) — Dave Stieb
held Kansas City to three hits
through eight innings and the
Toronto Blue Jays, showcasing the
blend that brought them their first
ever division title, beat the Royals
6-1 last night in the first game of the
American League playoffs.
The Blue Jays, the AL East
champions in just their ninth
season, scored all their runs in the
first four innings and finished with
11 hits in the first AL postseason
game played outside the United
States.
The loss in the opener of the
best-of-seven series saddled
Kansas City Manager Dick Howser
with an 0-10 record in the
postseason as his Royals crumbled
under the Blue Jays' early mix of
speed, power and agressiveness.
Stieb shut out the Royals through
eight innings. Tom Henke, the Jays'
surprise bullpen star this season,
gave up two hits to lead off the
ninth, and Willie Wilson scored the
lone Kansas City run on a fielder's
choice.
The game featured the two start
ing pitchers who led the league in
earned run average. But while the
top-ranked Stieb, with a 2.48 ERA,
looked every bit the part, the Blue
Jays ripped Charlie Leibrandt and
sent him to his earliest exit of the
season.
Stieb, whose lack of run support
during the season produced a mis
leading 14-13 record, gave up a
two-out double to George Brett in
the first inning and a one-out single
by Brett in the fourth. A pinch-hit

double by Dane lorg in the eighth
ended a streak of 12 straight bat
ters retired by Stieb.
Stieb allowed only one other run
ner, on a walk to Pat Sheridan in
the fourth, and struck out eight.
The hard-throwing Stieb fanned
eight different Royals, all except
Sheridan, before Henke came in to
pitch the ninth.
The only trouble spot for Stieb,
in fact, came while he was warming
up to start the second, when a
young woman bolted out of the
right-field seats, ran to the mound
and hugged the startled pitcher.
Stieb did not seem shaken and
pitched a 1-2-3 inning.
Leibrandt, meanwhile, lasted just
two full innings and was driven from
the mound in the third with the
bases loaded and no outs. The Blue
Jays, who were 0-2 against
Leibrandt during the season, ripped
the 17-game winner for five runs on
seven hits.
Game 2 is scheduled for this af
ternoon, when Kansas City lefty
Bud Black, 10-15 during the regular
season, is scheduled to face Jimmy
Key, 14-6.
This was Kansas City's sixth
postseason appearance, compared
with the first for the Blue Jays. But
the Royals were the ones who
came unglued when pressured by
the Blue Jays.
Jesse Barfield led off the second
with a single and Willie Upshaw was
hit by a pitch, only the third batter
Leibrandt had hit this season. Garth
lorg followed with a fly ball that left
fielder Lonnie Smith dropped, but
Smith recovered quickly and threw
Barfield out at third.
Ernie Whitt then grounded a
seeing-eye single to right that
drove in Upshaw with the game's
first run, and Tony Fernandez fol
lowed with a single to deep short
that scored lorg. Damaso Garcia's
single loaded the bases and got
Steve Farr up quickly in the Kansas
City bullpen, but Leibrandt
managed to escape further damage.
He was- unable, however, to
survive the third.
Cliff Johnson opened with a
double into the right-center field al
ley and Barfield walked on a 3-2
pitch. When Upshaw singled to load

the bases again, Howser had seen
enough and brought in the right
handed Farr.
Lefty Ranee Mulliniks, batting for
the right-handed lorg, lined an RBI
single to center that made it 3-0.
Farr then walked Whitt, forcing
home another run, and Fernandez
lined a drive to right for a sacrifice
and a five-run lead.
The Blue Jays' aggressiveness
produced another run in the fourth
inning.
George Bell, a slugger with
speed, led off with a single. Johnson
hit a slow grounder that shortstop
Buddy Biancalana charged and
threw to first for the out, but Bell
kept running and took off for third.
First baseman Steve Balboni
delayed for a moment before
throwing far over Brett's head at
third base, allowing Bell to trot
home.
