# Columbia To Divest
## 
### DAVID RISSER Editorial Staff 
Columbia University's Board of Trustees voted
Monday to divest the $39 million in stock the university
owns in companies with business dealings in South
Africa.
Divestment by Columbia, which will result in the
sale of about 4 percent of the university's $900 million
portfolio, will be completed over a two-year period.
"In deciding to divest in an orderly way over a period
of time, we are expressing our abhorrence of apartheid
and the South African government's obdurate adher
ence to it," said Samuel Higginbottom, chairman of the
Columbia board in a statement released Monday.
But Higginbottom said the board, in voting for di
vestment to protest South Africa's racist system, was
"not presuming to pass judgment on what other Ameri
can institutions and companies should do."
He noted that only a small fraction of Columbia's en
dowment is invested in companies that do business in
South Africa.
He added that the trustees "took cognizance of the
fact" that a number of American companies with busi
ness in South Africa were making "significant efforts on
behalf of the blacks" in South Africa.
While several universities, and some state and local
governments, have divested of stock in companies
which do business in South Africa, Columbia becomes
the first Ivy League school to do so.
"Divestment is a complex issue on which decent and
reasonable people may disagree," said Columbia Presi
dent Michael Sovern in a prepared statement.
"Divestment strengthens our condemnation of
apartheid. It is the right course for us at this time, so
we are taking it," Sovern said.
Student and faculty pressure for Stanford divest
ment intensified last year with marches, rallies, a
sleep-in and acts of civil disobedience, one of which
resulted in the arrest of nine students.
The Stanford Board of Trustees decided to increase
investigation of companies in which the University
holds stock on a case-by-case basis, and University
President Donald Kennedy has said he does not
believe divestment is the best policy for the Univer
sity.
Neither Columbia's president nor its board of trus
tees acknowledged protest there as crucial to the di
vestment vote.
Last spring, students and faculty at Columbia held a
30-day sit-in at Hamilton Hall, a major office and class
room building there. Daytime rallies in front of Hamil
ton, renamed Nelson Mandela Hall by the protesters,
drew more than 1,000 participants
and a statement of support from
Bishop Desmond Tutu of South
Africa.
In Monday's vote, the board was
approving a recommendation for di
vestment that had been made by a
trustee committee in August, Co
lumbia spokesperson Judith Leynse
told The Daily.
Columbia's divestment will in
clude the selling of all of its stocks
in such companies as American Ex
press, Burroughs, Mobil Oil, Chev
ron, Phillips Petroleum and Sperry,
according to The New York Times.
