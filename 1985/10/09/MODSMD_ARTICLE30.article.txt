# SENATORS SPEAK THEIR MINDS
## Don't Take Back Your Refunds Why shouldn't you take back your refunds? 
### 
What fool would leave $15.96 in some student
group's bank account when he could get it for himself,
in cash?
I guess it depends. How often in your life do you go
to college? And why are you here?
A lot of people came here because they were really
interested in the experiences they could get out of this
place. They could do things here they'd never get to do
again, with a group of people they'd never see the like
of again. A lot of them get more out of working with
others doing something on campus than they do out of
classes.
And they do good things. Forums, films, festivals,
cultural exchanges, club sports, music, magazines,
political awareness and social education. It's open to
you. They're doing it for students.
Now, you pay $15-$ 16,000 a year to be here, right?
No if's about that. Then, if you pay an extra $ 15-$2O a
quarter, people at Stanford get to have activities. . . if

not, they don't. That's all.
Grads? Some of you guys pay nothing in tuition, but
you still get all the resources of Stanford. For a few
bucks, you can make this place a hell of a lot more in
teresting than it'd be without student activities*
Right now, about 25% of people do take back their
refunds. Now, all the money there is for student
groups this year is about $600,000, and with 25% of it
gone. ..
A few bucks a quarter.
It's not that much, is it?
Would you be willing to let your $15.96 go to over -
100 student groups? And, by the way, none of the
money from student fees goes to the ASSU.
Seek out someone whose group is funded by part of -
that money. Ask him or her to explain more. Maybe
you'll get invited to something interesting. See some of
your money in action, because a little per person is
being used every day to go a very long way.
