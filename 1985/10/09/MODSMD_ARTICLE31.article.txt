Do you know why there is no contract between the
United Stanford Workers and the university? I don't
either. That's why 1 worked my ass off to get a forum
together where both sides could present their positions
to, and answer questions from, the Stanford com
munity. Not a debate. Not a shouting match. Just a ra
tional explanation to us, the students, why there's no
agreement.
The USW was more than willing to participate. They
agreed to any format the university might demand.

Well, after getting the royal runaround from various
offices, the administration response was a polite "No,
thank you." They prefer the safer route of having
someone speak to twenty or thirty people in Soto's
lounge. Even this had to be at least one week removed
from a similar appearance by a USW counterpart. Ap
parently the university doesn't want many of us to
know what their position is. You might wonder why. I
do.
