Be ex-officio on the Senate. What does ex-officio mean? That's Latin!
And it means you can do everything but vote. That's right. As ex-officio
you can talk, work, convince, explain, and do. You can be just like many
Senators aren't.
You got a problem? Do something about it.
You hate the Senate? Change it. Or try, anyway.
