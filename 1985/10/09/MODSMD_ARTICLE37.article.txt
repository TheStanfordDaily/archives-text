# CLERK OF THE SENATE
## 
### 
Salary: $190 a month for the rest of the year. (That's equivalent to 19
cases of Shaefer Beer a month for the rest of the year. Just thought you'd
like to know.)
What you do is:
1. Track, get final copies of, and archive legislation.
2. Control Senate expenses and pay bills (but not out of your own pocket.
Just thought you'd like to know.)
3. Control attendance and roster of Senators.
4. Create schedules of meetings and places.
5. Some typing. But, hey, you're getting paid.
6. All of the above.
What we do is:
1. Throw work on you nicely (i.e. "Here, Bill, cach this anvil!" Heh, heh.
Just kidding.)
2. Get to know and help you. We're nice. Really!
3. Take you out to dinner (If you're really good! If you're really bad, we'll
take you to Al's All-U-Kan-Eat Brisket Bonanza, make you eat all you
can, and make you pay!)

Call Senate Chair Carey White be
fore October 15. What the Hell, call
him now and leave a mesage at 326-
3473. Operators are standing by, and
the first 5,000 callers will receive an
official Carey White vegetable
strainer, absolutely FREE! Well, ac
tually, we kind of ran out of strainers,
but call Carey anyway. '
