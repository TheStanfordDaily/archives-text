Dear Bugger,
I was going over my PTR and trying to figure out what all those acronyms my fees go to
stand for. What's ASSURE? And what's the Pub Board? And what's the Program
Board? I think it would go a long way to creating an informed electorate if you could let
us all know. Isn't that convenient?

Good question, Beric! ASSURE is the brand new, ASSU-funded night-time
shuttle service. ASSURE uses Marguerite buses and circles the campus, using
existing Marguerite stops, plus an extra stop at Governor's Corner. The buses
run every thirty minutes, and all faculty, staff, and students can ride. It's free,
too.
The Pub and Program Boads fund dozens (hundreds, even) of student groups
and publications. Each board is made up of independent students. Groups that
need money come to the Pub and Program Boards, and the Boards decide how
much each group can get. Then the Appropriations Committee decides whether
or not to listen to the Boards. Then the Senate decides whether or not to listen
to the Appropriations Committee.
Does that answer your question?
