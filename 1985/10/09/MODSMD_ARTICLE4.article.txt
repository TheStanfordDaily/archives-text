# Activists Send Tutu Supportive Letter
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
In a show of support for Bishop
Desmond Tutu, 15 political activists
from around the world have written
a letter to the Nobel Peace Prize
winner urging him to continue his
non-violent struggle against South
Africa's racist government.
The letter, which was the
brainchild of folk singer and political
activist Joan Baez, is sponsored by
Humanitas International, a peace
organization headed by Baez.
Among those signing the letter
were the Rev. Jesse Jackson,
United Farm Workers leader Cesar

Chavez and Solidarity hero Lech
Welesa.
According to Baez, the letter
was written "just to support" Tutu
and to encourage non-violent activ
ity as the means with which to end
apartheid.
The following is the complete
text of the letter, which has been
published in three South African
newspapers but previously had not
appeared in a newspaper in the
United States:
"Dear Bishop Tutu:
We are a handful of individuals
who are separated by thousands of
miles, but joined together by the
common conviction that justice can
only be brought about if we our

selves remain steadfastly commit
ted to the ideals and practice of
non-violence. We write this letter
to express our support for you and
the thousands who stand with you
in the face of the monstrous
oppression, cruelty and violence of
the South Africa state. Even when
provoked to anger by an unyielding
adversary, you have not given in to
malice, but have remained always
caring and astute.
Your country is a theater, and
the entire world your audience.
The stage is well lit, and now,
through all the propaganda, we see
the players for what they are. Even
from our very great distance we
can sense the terrible frustration

and sadness you must feel when
your peoples' acts of courage and
dignity are crushed daily. They hold
a peaceful meeting, and dogs are
set upon them; their schoolchildren
sing, and are chased and beaten.
For simply speaking out, they are
arrested, detained and tortured.
They cannot even mourn their dead
in peace.
To the South African govern
ment we say lay down your arms
and stop the bloodbath. To you,
Bishop Tutu, we say that your
refusal to respond with violence has
been your strongest weapon. With
great respect for your personal
faith and courage, we thank you for
your continuing affirmation of dig

nity and life."
Baez said she organized the let
ter from her kitchen, calling around
the world to contact its 15 authors.
"You have to abandon other
things," Baez said, although she
called the letter "a very modest ef
fort."
Baez read the letter last week to
Tutu over the phone and hasn't
received a response from the black
leader, although she plans to call
him back "in a couple of days."
"I didn't plan on (a response),"
she said, adding that the group
signing the letter is trying "not to
isolate him anymore" by forcing him
to make a statement about the
South African situation.
On the subject of divestment,
Baez said she subscribes to the
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s phil
osophy that one can't invest in
something that is corrupt.
"That speech could have been
written yesterday," she said of
King's words 20 years ago.
Baez is currently working on a
book about the past 30 years of her
life as a musician and political ac
tivist, a project she has been
working on for the past year. She
said she hopes to have the bulk of
the writing done by January.
