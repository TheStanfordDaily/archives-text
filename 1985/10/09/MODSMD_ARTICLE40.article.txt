# POLL WATCHERS
## 
### 
Make money for your student group — get your people together to be POLL
WATCHERS on October 29 and 30.
Polly: Daddy, what do Poll Watchers do?
Daddy: Why, they watch polls, Polly.
Polly: Oh.
Six poll sites! Hundreds of dollars (thousands, if you're the Mormon Tabernacle
Choir) available at $4.50/hr. per person.
Polly: Daddy, is that a lot of money?
Daddy: Well, Polly, let's just say it's enough to send you away to the camp
for Chronically Annoying Kids. Forever.
Polly: Oh.
Do it as a project for your group — you could walk out with $500. Or you could
stay home and watch re-runs of Happy Days. Contact Senate Chair Carey White at
497-4331 or 326-3473.
Polly: Daddy, is a Senate Chair like a kitchen table?
Daddy: No, but if it was, I'd hit you with it. Hard.
Polly: Oh.
WE WILL HIRE YOU. WE TRUST YOU. Even you, Polly.
Polly: Oh.
