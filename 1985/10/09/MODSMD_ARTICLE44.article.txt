Hundreds missing in mudslides
PONCE, Puerto Rico — Hundreds of residents of a devastated*
shantytown watched anxiously yesterday as National Guardsmen
and U.S. Army engineers dug through tons of wood and mud in
search of their relatives and neighbors missing in mudslides and
flooding. Sixty-six people are known to have been killed.
Authorities said hundreds of people were missing and thousands
were in shelters after the tropical deluge.
Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon called it"the worst tragedy ever to
hit our island."
National Guardsmen said 18 bodies had been recovered from
Mameyes, a half-mile-square, impoverished neighborhood and the
hardest hit community on the island. Some 400 wood-and-tin homes
came crashing down the hillside in a wave of mud early Monday, after
a tropical front dumped seven inches of rain in a 10-hour period on
the south coast.
The front developed into Tropical Storm Isabel after passing this
island's western tip late Monday, and the Bahamas government
issued a storm watch for some islands yesterday. Isabel had maxi
mum sustained winds near 50 mph by early afternoon.
Gov. Hernandez Colon, who declared a state of emergency Mon
day, sent 300 National Guardsmen to Ponce. Police Superintendent
Andres Garcia Arache said all island police officers were called to
duty yesterday.
"There could be up to 500 people under these tons of wood and
mud," National Guard Col. Johnny Rosado said.
Soviets May Free Sakharov
PARIS — Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has left French officials
with the impression that he is prepared to consider freeing dissident
physicist Andrei Sakharov as a gesture to Western public opinion.
These officials, who were deeply involved in Gorbachev's four-day
visit to Paris last week, stressed that France has not received any
clear promise from the Soviets on Sakharov, who has been in inter
nal exile in the closed city of Gorky since January 1980. They added
that any release is unlikely before Gorbachev meets with President
Reagan in Geneva in November.
But the French government is certain to report to the Reagan Ad
ministration that the talks here produced more flexibility on Gorba
chev's part on the question of Sakharov and other human-rights is
sues than on arms-control questions and other subjects that will
come up during the November summit.
French officials are also treating the signs of new Soviet flexibility
with great caution, emphasizing that even if Sakharov is released,
they do not feel it will represent a significant change in the pattern of
Soviet repression at home, iney apparently have passed this judg
ment along to the Reagan Administration.
Indirectly, the Soviet leader left the impression with the French
delegation that he was concerned about the image problem that the
continued detention of Sakharov in Gorky creates for the Soviets
Union, according to one senior French source.
UNITA Defeats Angolan Forces
LOMBA RIVER, Angola — Guerrillas of Jonas Savimbi's National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) reported that
they turned back a major assault just north of the key town of
Mavinga, 150 miles from UNITA's bush headquarters at Jamba,
which Angola claimed 10 days ago he had abandoned in the face of its
nearly two-month-old campaign.
The flat bush country was strewn with the corpses of Angolan sol
diers and the burnt-out hulks of Russian-built armored cars and big
Zil troop carriers.
Reporters saw the wreckage of a big Soviet Mi-25 helicopter gun
ship, one of five UNITA claims to have shot down. The rebels also
claim to have shot down 16 other helicopters and five Soviet MiG-21
fighters.
However, the reporters saw nothing to verify either the Luanda
government's claims that South Africa helped UNITA with a series
of air strikes against their advancing columns, or Savimbi's claim that
the Angolan forces were commanded by Soviet officers.
Angola has denied, and informed observers in Angola have given
little credence to, UNITA charges of active Soviet involvement in
the recent fighting.
Savimbi repeated his frequent appeals for the West to come to his
assistance and said that since the latest assault on his position, by far
the biggest of the war, there were signs of growing support for him
within the Reagan Administration.
U.S. Rejects Soviet Arms Offer
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administration, detailing its most
specific objections to the latest Soviet arms proposal, says the offer
is "a place to start" but is unacceptable because it could strengthen
Moscow's capability to launch a surprise attack and split the United
States from its European allies.
President Reagan "finds the very fact that the Soviets have made
a counterproposal a promising development," a senior Administra
tion official told reporters at a White House briefing.
Nonetheless, the official then set out to put the worst possible
face on the offer to cut both sides' nuclear weapons by 50 percent in
exchange for a halt to U.S. space defense work.
One Pentagon official conceded later that the Administration,
which for nearly five years has called for deep cuts in nuclear arsen
als, finds it awkward that the Soviets have put forward a similar
scheme that the United States cannot accept.
Moscow's proposed 50 percent cut in missiles and bombers would
set a ceiling of 1,680 such "delivery vehicles," he said. He added that
those vehicles would be limited to carrying a total of 6,000 warheads
or bombs — also about 50 percent of the current number of such
weapons.
A key provision also specified that no single basing mode —
whether land-based missiles, sea-based missiles or bombers —
could carry more than 60 percent of the total weapons of either side,
the official said.
Under the Soviet proposal, the number of U.S. intermediate
range missiles and fighter-bombers in Europe and Asia, which can
reach Soviet territory, would be constrained by the 1,680-vehicle
limit.
The United States already has 1,149 such systems, he said, and
therefore could be forced to slash its U.S.-based intercontinental
missiles and bombers to only 531 from the current total of more than
1,900 — a far greater cut than 50 percent.
The official also noted that Moscow would not be required to count
its 2,000 intermediate-range missiles and bombers among the nu
clear arsenal that had to be reduced. Thus, the Soviets would not be
faced with a comparable choice and could retain their most powerful
system — multiple-warhead, land-based intercontinental missiles,
he said.

Soviets May Free Sakharov
PARIS — Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has left French officials
with the impression that he is prepared to consider freeing dissident
physicist Andrei Sakharov as a gesture to Western public opinion.
These officials, who were deeply involved in Gorbachev's four-day
visit to Paris last week, stressed that France has not received any
clear promise from the Soviets on Sakharov, who has been in inter
nal exile in the closed city of Gorky since January 1980. They added
that any release is unlikely before Gorbachev meets with President
Reagan in Geneva in November.
But the French government is certain to report to the Reagan Ad
ministration that the talks here produced more flexibility on Gorba
chev's part on the question of Sakharov and other human-rights is
sues than on arms-control questions and other subjects that will
come up during the November summit.
French officials are also treating the signs of new Soviet flexibility
with great caution, emphasizing that even if Sakharov is released,
they do not feel it will represent a significant change in the pattern of
Soviet repression at home, iney apparently have passed this judg
ment along to the Reagan Administration.
Indirectly, the Soviet leader left the impression with the French
delegation that he was concerned about the image problem that the
continued detention of Sakharov in Gorky creates for the Soviets
Union, according to one senior French source.
UNITA Defeats Angolan Forces
LOMBA RIVER, Angola — Guerrillas of Jonas Savimbi's National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) reported that
they turned back a major assault just north of the key town of
Mavinga, 150 miles from UNITA's bush headquarters at Jamba,
which Angola claimed 10 days ago he had abandoned in the face of its
nearly two-month-old campaign.
The flat bush country was strewn with the corpses of Angolan sol
diers and the burnt-out hulks of Russian-built armored cars and big
Zil troop carriers.
Reporters saw the wreckage of a big Soviet Mi-25 helicopter gun
ship, one of five UNITA claims to have shot down. The rebels also
claim to have shot down 16 other helicopters and five Soviet MiG-21
fighters.
However, the reporters saw nothing to verify either the Luanda
government's claims that South Africa helped UNITA with a series
of air strikes against their advancing columns, or Savimbi's claim that
the Angolan forces were commanded by Soviet officers.
Angola has denied, and informed observers in Angola have given
little credence to, UNITA charges of active Soviet involvement in
the recent fighting.
Savimbi repeated his frequent appeals for the West to come to his
assistance and said that since the latest assault on his position, by far
the biggest of the war, there were signs of growing support for him
within the Reagan Administration.
U.S. Rejects Soviet Arms Offer
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administration, detailing its most
specific objections to the latest Soviet arms proposal, says the offer
is "a place to start" but is unacceptable because it could strengthen
Moscow's capability to launch a surprise attack and split the United
States from its European allies.
President Reagan "finds the very fact that the Soviets have made
a counterproposal a promising development," a senior Administra
tion official told reporters at a White House briefing.
Nonetheless, the official then set out to put the worst possible
face on the offer to cut both sides' nuclear weapons by 50 percent in
exchange for a halt to U.S. space defense work.
One Pentagon official conceded later that the Administration,
which for nearly five years has called for deep cuts in nuclear arsen
als, finds it awkward that the Soviets have put forward a similar
scheme that the United States cannot accept.
Moscow's proposed 50 percent cut in missiles and bombers would
set a ceiling of 1,680 such "delivery vehicles," he said. He added that
those vehicles would be limited to carrying a total of 6,000 warheads
or bombs — also about 50 percent of the current number of such
weapons.
A key provision also specified that no single basing mode —
whether land-based missiles, sea-based missiles or bombers —
could carry more than 60 percent of the total weapons of either side,
the official said.
Under the Soviet proposal, the number of U.S. intermediate
range missiles and fighter-bombers in Europe and Asia, which can
reach Soviet territory, would be constrained by the 1,680-vehicle
limit.
The United States already has 1,149 such systems, he said, and
therefore could be forced to slash its U.S.-based intercontinental
missiles and bombers to only 531 from the current total of more than
1,900 — a far greater cut than 50 percent.
The official also noted that Moscow would not be required to count
its 2,000 intermediate-range missiles and bombers among the nu
clear arsenal that had to be reduced. Thus, the Soviets would not be
faced with a comparable choice and could retain their most powerful
system — multiple-warhead, land-based intercontinental missiles,
he said.
Hundreds missing in mudslides
PONCE, Puerto Rico — Hundreds of residents of a devastated*
shantytown watched anxiously yesterday as National Guardsmen
and U.S. Army engineers dug through tons of wood and mud in
search of their relatives and neighbors missing in mudslides and
flooding. Sixty-six people are known to have been killed.
Authorities said hundreds of people were missing and thousands
were in shelters after the tropical deluge.
Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon called it"the worst tragedy ever to
hit our island."
National Guardsmen said 18 bodies had been recovered from
Mameyes, a half-mile-square, impoverished neighborhood and the
hardest hit community on the island. Some 400 wood-and-tin homes
came crashing down the hillside in a wave of mud early Monday, after
a tropical front dumped seven inches of rain in a 10-hour period on
the south coast.
The front developed into Tropical Storm Isabel after passing this
island's western tip late Monday, and the Bahamas government
issued a storm watch for some islands yesterday. Isabel had maxi
mum sustained winds near 50 mph by early afternoon.
Gov. Hernandez Colon, who declared a state of emergency Mon
day, sent 300 National Guardsmen to Ponce. Police Superintendent
