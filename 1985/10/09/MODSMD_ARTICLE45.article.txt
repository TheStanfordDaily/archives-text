# U.S. Hostages Reportedly Well
## 
### 
Palestinian pirates held more than 400
hostages under threat of death on a captive Ital
ian cruise liner, floating in the Mediterranean
with nowhere to go last night. A man who said
he was the captain reported by radio all aboard
were safe and pleaded against rescue attempts.
In Washington, National Security Adviser
Robert McFarlane said late yesterday he
believed the vessel was anchored off the coast of
Syria, and he expected "some movement" today.
He declined to say in which direction.
The message from international waters in the
Mediterranean, purportedly from the captain,
contradicted unconfirmed reports that the hijack
ers, who demand that Israel free 50 Palestinian
prisoners, had killed two American passengers.
"Please, please, don't try anything on my
ship," he shouted into the radio from the Achille
Lauro, which was reported to be off Cyprus at
the time, according to port officials in Lebanon.
The Palestinian hijackers were said to have a
large supply of explosives, and vowed soon after
seizing the vessel Monday night that they would
blow it up if military air or naval forces tried to in
terfere. Flotta Lauro, the shipping line, said 413
people were aboard, including 331 crew mem
bers.
Italy's defense minister, Giovanni Spadolini,
said after a late-night emergency session with
Premier Bettino Craxi and Foreign Minister

Giulio Andreotti that any military move was an
"extreme" action to be avoided at all costs. But
the three leaders gave no indication of what ac
tion might be taken.
Spadolini said Italy had not established contact
with the hijackers and said there would be no
negotiations for prisoners "that are not in our
hands and over whom we have no power."
Meanwhile in Washington, the Reagan Admin
istration deliberated with the governments of
Italy, Syria, Egypt, Israel, Britain, Lebanon and
other countries yesterday in search of a strategy
for dealing with the terrorists.
There were reports that the terrorists had
demanded that William Eagleton, the United
States' ambassador to Syria, come to the Syrian
port of Tartus to negotiate with them on their
demand for the release of 50 Palestinian
prisoners held by the Israeli government.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes would
say only that Eagleton had not gone to the
seaport and refused to answer when asked
repeatedly whether Eagleton would go later.
Publicly the White House and the State De
partment reiterated the United States' oft-stated
position that it will not negotiate with terrorists.
According to sources, who declined to be
identified, an urgent priority among U.S. officials
was to prevent the ship from being taken into
port at Beirut, where the last hostage crisis was

played out and where anarchy prevails.
The State Department was said to be seeking
to bring pressure upon Syria not to accept the
hostages. If the ship does go into port, however,
the United States would prefer to see it dock at
Tartus, about 50 miles north of the Lebanese
border, where the climate would be far more
conducive to negotiations than at Beirut.
Speakes told reporters yesterday morning
that perhaps a dozen, but certainly less than 20
Americans remained aboard the ship; most of
the 80 U.S. citizens listed on the manifest of the
Achille Lauro were believed to have stayed in
Alexandria when the cruise departed.
In Tunis, Tunisia, the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization's chief spokesman denied yesterday
that the PLO was responsible for the hijacking of
the Italian cruise ship and said that a high-level
PLO delegation has gone to Egypt to try to help
in any negotiations for the release of the hostage
passengers and crew.
Meanwhile in Jerusalem, the Israeli Cabinet
discussed the incident yesterday under the aus
pices of the Ministerial Defense Committee,
whose deliberations are secret.
Answering reporters' questions briefly after
the session, Cabinet Secretary Yossi Beilin
would say only that Israel had received no formal
request to release the 50 Palestinian prisoners
whose freedom is demanded by the hijackers.
