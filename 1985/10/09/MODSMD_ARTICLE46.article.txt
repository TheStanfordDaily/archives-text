# Motorola Pulls Out of S. Africa

### 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
— Motorola Inc., which has been
strongly criticized by anti-apartheid
campaigners in the United States
for operating in South Africa and
providing the police and army here
with radio equipment, sold its local
subsidiary Monday to a South
African company.
Motorola thus became the latest
in a lengthening list of American
companies to pull out of the strife
torn country.
Nigel Moon, the managing direc
tor of Motorola's South African sub
sidiary, said the sale was prompted
bv business considerations and had

been discussed on and off for seven
years, but the move was viewed
here as one of the most significant
divestitures yet by an American
company. "There has been a fair
amount of heat on Motorola in the
United States of late," Moon said,
"but there has long been an interest
from Motorola's side and from
various South Africa companies for
an alliance. We see this as a very
positive development."
Motorola's manufacturing and
distribution operation here was
bought by Allied Technologies Ltd.,
or Altech. Altech is one of South
Africa's major electronics compan

ies, and it will continue to produce
two-way radios at Motorola's 250-
man factory here and to sell and
service Motorola products as a
licensee and supplier.
Neither Motorola headquarters,
at Schaumburg, 111., nor Altech dis
closed terms of the deal, but local
business sources estimate that Al
tech probably paid at least $2 mil
lion for the subsidiary, whose an
nual sales are estimated at $12 mil
lion to $15 million.
In financial terms, the deal is a
relatively small one for both
Motorola.
Local business observers said

they think the deal will allow
Motorola to remain in the South
African market as a major supplier
— and even to resume its highly
profitable but very controversial
sales to the police and military —
but avoid the high exposure to
criticism in the United States.
"Motorola is a big-name company, it
was under growing pressure at
home, and it decided South Africa
was not worth it,"the managing
director of another American com
pany in the electronics industry
said, asking not to be identified by
name. "And that spells disinvest
ment."
