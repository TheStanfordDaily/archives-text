Debt Debate Drags On
WASHINGTON — Despite a Reagan Ad
ministration threat that government checks
will start bouncing today, Senate leaders
struggled inconclusively yesterday to reach a
compromise on a stop-gap extension of the
government's borrowing power.
At late afternoon, Republicans and Demo
crats were still haggling over a compromise
under which a short debt-ceiling extension
could be passed in conjunction with a prompt
vote on sweeping GOP-sponsored legislation
to balance the budget by 1991.
In the absence of such an agreement, Sen
ate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) told
the Senate that a vote on the stopgap debt
measure would probably not be possible
before late today.
It was not immediately clear whether the
timetable would satisfy the Treasury Depart
ment, which has scheduled an auction at 12:30
p.m. to raise $5 billion to keep the govern
ment's line of credit open past today.
Dole suggested that the government's funds
might not be exhausted until late in the day.
Outlining a schedule that anticipated final con
gressional action on the debt measure by
tonight, he said, "Otherwise I understand they
(Treasury officials) are in real trouble."

Other senators, including Republicans,
were skeptical about the Administration's
threats of an unprecedented default on govern
ment obligations unless the debt bill is passed
by today. "There is no calamity," said Sen.
Steven Symms (R-Idaho) accusing the Trea
sury Department of "scare tactics."
"It makes you suspicious, doesn't it?" asked
Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) in reference to
escape hatches under which the government
could tap other funds or shuffle money to avoid
default.
The negotiations between Dole and Minority
Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) were being
conducted under heavy pressure from the Ad
ministration, including a letter from Acting
Treasury Secretary Richard Darman, warning
that the government will run out of cash today.
The letter was a followup to an earlier warn
ing, also from Darman, that the government
could no longer guarantee its checks would be
honored after cash balances were exhausted.
Plan May Hinder Sales
WASHINGTON — The Reagan Administra
tion's $2 billion program to rescue sagging
U.S. farm exports may instead have damaged
overseas sales because it has angered

America's best customers, grain industry
spokesmen told Congress yesterday.
"Why do we persist in being our own worst
enemy?" asked Myron Laserson, executive
vice president of Continental Grain Co. and
president of the North American Export Grain
Association.
"The . . . program as constructed will result
in lower exports than we would have had with
out the program," he added, estimating that
wheat exports in the current marketing year
will be at least 25 percent below the
Agriculture Department's 1.2 billion bushel es
timate.
"The program has turned out to be a
miserable faire that has . . . antagonized our
traditional customers and lost more business
than it has gained," said J. Stephen Gabbert,
executive vice president of the Rice Millers
Association.
Farm exports are the largest single positive
influence on the U.S. trade balance, but they
have slipped in the past four years. Export
value this year is projected at $32 billion, down
from a 1981 peak of $43.8 billion.
Reasons for the slide range from the high
value of the U.S. dollar and relatively high
domestic price supports to slack demand due
to a world economic slump and massive over
production that has led to huge surpluses.
