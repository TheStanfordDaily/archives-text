Frustacis Sue Doctor
LOS ANGELES — The parents of three
surviving septuplets filed a malpractice and
wrongful death suit yesterday seeking more
than $2.2 million from the doctor and clinic that
gave fertility drugs to Patti Frustaci.
The suit by Mrs. Frustaci and husband Sam
alleges medical malpractice, four wrongful
deaths, loss of earnings and earnings capacity
as a result of overprescription of fertility drugs
at Tyler Medical Center by Dr. Jaroslav Marik.
California law limits medical malpractice
awards to $250,000 for such non-economic
losses as pain, suffering or embarrassment,
but financial damages are not limited.
"The children face a lifetime of medical
problems, necessitating expensive treatment
and evaluation," Greene said at a news confer
ence.
He said the known medical problems of the
three survivors include optic nerve damage,
hernias and chronic lung disease, as well as

heart damage in the two boys.
Marik declined comment yesterday on the
lawsuit when reached yesterday by the Asso
ciated Press.
Mars Has More Water
MOUNTAIN VIEW — Mars has 10 to
100 times more water than was originally
believed, and that may help sustain future
manned missions to the frozen red planet,
NASA researchers said yesterday.
Robert Haberle said it was once believed
there was enough water on Mars to cover its
surface for a depth of one meter. Now, they
think it could reach a depth of 10 to 100
meters.
"When men do go to Mars, one of the impor
tant resources they will be looking for is
water," said Michael Carr of the U. S. Geologi
cal Survey in Menlo Park, adding that

water can be used for drinking, for oxygen, to
power rockets and to grow food.
Little Richard Crash
LOS ANGELES — Little Richard, a flam
boyant '50s rock star whose hits included
"Tutti Frutti" and "Good Golly Miss Molly,"
was listed in serious condition yesterday after
smashing a rented sports car into a telephone
pole, authorities said.
Ron Wise, spokesman for Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center, said people "from all over the
world" called yesterday asking about the
musician, whose full name is Richard Wayne
Penniman.
Wise said the 52-year-old Penniman was
conscious and receiving visits from relatives.
"His condition is serious but stable, suffer
ing from a fractured right leg, head laceration
and some bruised ribs," he said.
