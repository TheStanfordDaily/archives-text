# Vendors Speak of Peace and Profits
## Stanford's merchants are as unique as their wares 
### FIONA ADAMSON 
The smell of roses, the taste of
fresh strawberries, a glittering
handcrafted earring, a ready-to
wear social statement.
What do all of these items have in
common? Each of these products
may be obtained on a given week
day from vendors in White Plaza
who are anything but common.
Perhaps the Stanford vendors
have become so common that stu
dents no longer question (or per
haps never did question) who they
are, how they came to work on the
campus and why they continue to
do so.
But behind every booth in the
plaza is an individual with products
to sell and experiences to share.
Police escort
The vendors one encounters on
the way to class are a random
group, and Tresidder Union has set
forth regulations to help prevent

chaos and complete commercializa
tion of the plaza.
These rules limit the number of
vendors, what they may sell and
the size and design of display areas.
According to an official list of
rules established by Tresidder, a
vendor must sell a non-commercial
handcrafted item.
A letter to all vendors from
Tresidder reads, "Any ven
dor not following the guidelines or
restrictions will be asked to leave
the area, and if necessary, will be
escorted from the premises by the
Stanford police."
Veteran vendors
Tresidder does allow two notable
exceptions to its regulations re
garding non-craft items.
Tutti Fiori, owned and operated
by Larry and Norma Tarquino, sells
flowers and plants. The couple
started their current business 14
years ago, however, and their

stand is protected by a grandfather
clause in Tresidder's statement of
regulations.
Norma Tarquino explained that
Tutti Fiori is very much like a nor
mal florist in function and earnings
except for its more relaxed atmos
phere.
She said she enjoys being on
campus, where the business is
good, but the additional pressure of
preparing flowers for weddings,
funerals or other occasions is
usually nonexistent.
On the other hand, the burdens
of transporting the plants and set
ting up the stall on a daily basis,
combined with changing weather
conditions, often serve to compli
cate the job, she said.
The othei non-craft stand in
White Plaza is located next to the
Stanford Ponkstore. Maria Dallas
and her son, Paul, may be found
there on a daily basis selling their
variety of fresh fruits.

Dallas, who used to run the stand
with her husband, has been here for
15 years, ever since her retire
ment.
The job involves rising at an early
hour every morning in order to buy
the fruit before coming to campus.
It is not the most financially
profitable job, she said.
Dallas is quick to point out that
her job is fine for a retired person
and that money is not the reason
she runs the stand.
"It gives me something to work
for, especially in my old age," she
said.
Taking a philosophical stance,
Dallas points out that she believes
"the important thing in life is to
find happiness and to do sone goo 1
for others."
Dallas said she is glad that she

students. She addeu that she lias
