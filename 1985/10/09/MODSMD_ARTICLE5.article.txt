# Vendors Speak of Peace and Profits
## Stanford's merchants are as unique as their wares 
### FIONA ADAMSON 
The smell of roses, the taste of
fresh strawberries, a glittering
handcrafted earring, a ready-to
wear social statement.
What do all of these items have in
common? Each of these products
may be obtained on a given week
day from vendors in White Plaza
who are anything but common.
Perhaps the Stanford vendors
have become so common that stu
dents no longer question (or per
haps never did question) who they
are, how they came to work on the
campus and why they continue to
do so.
But behind every booth in the
plaza is an individual with products
to sell and experiences to share.
Police escort
The vendors one encounters on
the way to class are a random
group, and Tresidder Union has set
forth regulations to help prevent

chaos and complete commercializa
tion of the plaza.
These rules limit the number of
vendors, what they may sell and
the size and design of display areas.
According to an official list of
rules established by Tresidder, a
vendor must sell a non-commercial
handcrafted item.
A letter to all vendors from
Tresidder reads, "Any ven
dor not following the guidelines or
restrictions will be asked to leave
the area, and if necessary, will be
escorted from the premises by the
Stanford police."
Veteran vendors
Tresidder does allow two notable
exceptions to its regulations re
garding non-craft items.
Tutti Fiori, owned and operated
by Larry and Norma Tarquino, sells
flowers and plants. The couple
started their current business 14
years ago, however, and their

stand is protected by a grandfather
clause in Tresidder's statement of
regulations.
Norma Tarquino explained that
Tutti Fiori is very much like a nor
mal florist in function and earnings
except for its more relaxed atmos
phere.
She said she enjoys being on
campus, where the business is
good, but the additional pressure of
preparing flowers for weddings,
funerals or other occasions is
usually nonexistent.
On the other hand, the burdens
of transporting the plants and set
ting up the stall on a daily basis,
combined with changing weather
conditions, often serve to compli
cate the job, she said.
The othei non-craft stand in
White Plaza is located next to the
Stanford Ponkstore. Maria Dallas
and her son, Paul, may be found
there on a daily basis selling their
variety of fresh fruits.

Dallas, who used to run the stand
with her husband, has been here for
15 years, ever since her retire
ment.
The job involves rising at an early
hour every morning in order to buy
the fruit before coming to campus.
It is not the most financially
profitable job, she said.
Dallas is quick to point out that
her job is fine for a retired person
and that money is not the reason
she runs the stand.
"It gives me something to work
for, especially in my old age," she
said.
Taking a philosophical stance,
Dallas points out that she believes
"the important thing in life is to
find happiness and to do sone goo 1
for others."
Dallas said she is glad that she
contribr f es to the F of
students. She addeu that she lias
found satisfaction in her own life
through interaction with the stu
dents and the peaceful atmosphere
of the campus.
The native Italian said she views
the campus as a haven free from
the rush and confusion of the
outside world. She noted that Stan
ford reminds her of the pace of life
in Italy.
Artistic appreciation
David Anderson, designer,
crafter and seller of his own
jewelry, said he sees the campus as
a place where his art is appreciated
and the students are receptive to
his work.
Anderson, who has worked as a
vendor at Stanford for eight years,
said he believes that perhaps be
cause of the international element
or perhaps because of the high level
of awareness, the students seem to

be able to recognize quality in art.
Anderson, a native New Yorker
with a degree in psychology, said
he enjoys the feedback he receives
on campus from his customers.
Anderson said customer feed
back has "helped to mold me as an
artist."
For a student who wants to deco
rate a dorm room instead of an
earlobe, Eugene MacNeill is to be
found nearby. His selection of rugs
ranges in price from $25 to $200.
MacNeill said he got his start
when a friend went out of business
and left MacNeill the firm's
remains. MacNeill sold these items
at the San Jose Flea Market and
found this vending to be profitable
enough to start his own business.
He relocated to the Stanford
campus and has remained here, on
and off, for nearly 15 years. Mac-
Neill said he finds that his custom
ers are split fairly evenly among

students, their parents, and faculty.
MacNeill said he enjoys the Plaza
environment, characterizing it as a
relaxed one in which one "doesn't
have to worry about theft."
However, "every day is a
gamble," he said.
One day, for example, he sus
tained a $1,000 loss because his
rugs were destroyed by a sudden
rain storm.
Elemental T's
Gary Freedman, a graduate of
the University of Connecticut,
vends what he terms "Elemental
T's."
Freedman got started when he
came out to visit a friend in Califor
nia one winter. He was already
printing T-shirts as a hobby, and
decided to set up a booth on the
campus featuring a slogan of the
Polish labor union Solidarity as his
first design.

Among Freedman's highlights
have been encounters with
"important scholars," who are in
trigued by his T-shirts featuring
symbols for various chemical ele
ments.
As well as selling on campus,
Freedman said he wholesales his
designs and runs a mail-order cata
log branch of his business.
Freedman added that Stanford is
"like paradise for marketing re
search" because he can test out a
design on campus and see if it is
marketable on a larger scale.
Streakers and a camel
The vendors of White Plaza, each
obviously unique, all have shared in
the Stanford experience.
Vendors have seen, for example,
a camel on campus and a group of
streakers parading through White
Plaza. One vendor added, "Almost
anything can happen here."

Paul Dallas continues the 15-year-old family tradition of selling
fruit in White Plaza. The business offers a chance "to find
happiness and to do some good for others," according to Maria
Dallas, Paul's mother, who also works the stand.

Freedman got started when he
came out to visit a friend in Califor
nia one winter. He was already
printing T-shirts as a hobby, and
decided to set up a booth on the
campus featuring a slogan of the
Polish labor union Solidarity as his
first design.

Among Freedman's highlights
have been encounters with
"important scholars," who are in
trigued by his T-shirts featuring
symbols for various chemical ele
ments.
As well as selling on campus,
Freedman said he wholesales his
designs and runs a mail-order cata
log branch of his business.
Freedman added that Stanford is
"like paradise for marketing re
search" because he can test out a
design on campus and see if it is
marketable on a larger scale.
Streakers and a camel
The vendors of White Plaza, each
obviously unique, all have shared in
the Stanford experience.
Vendors have seen, for example,
a camel on campus and a group of
streakers parading through White
Plaza. One vendor added, "Almost
anything can happen here."

Paul Dallas continues the 15-year-old family tradition of selling
fruit in White Plaza. The business offers a chance "to find
happiness and to do some good for others," according to Maria
Dallas, Paul's mother, who also works the stand.
The smell of roses, the taste of
fresh strawberries, a glittering
handcrafted earring, a ready-to
wear social statement.
What do all of these items have in
common? Each of these products
may be obtained on a given week
day from vendors in White Plaza
who are anything but common.
Perhaps the Stanford vendors
have become so common that stu
dents no longer question (or per
haps never did question) who they
are, how they came to work on the
campus and why they continue to
do so.
But behind every booth in the
plaza is an individual with products
to sell and experiences to share.
Police escort
The vendors one encounters on
the way to class are a random
group, and Tresidder Union has set
forth regulations to help prevent

chaos and complete commercializa
tion of the plaza.
These rules limit the number of
vendors, what they may sell and
the size and design of display areas.
According to an official list of
rules established by Tresidder, a
vendor must sell a non-commercial
handcrafted item.
A letter to all vendors from
Tresidder reads, "Any ven
dor not following the guidelines or
restrictions will be asked to leave
the area, and if necessary, will be
escorted from the premises by the
Stanford police."
Veteran vendors
Tresidder does allow two notable
exceptions to its regulations re
garding non-craft items.
Tutti Fiori, owned and operated
by Larry and Norma Tarquino, sells
flowers and plants. The couple
started their current business 14
years ago, however, and their

stand is protected by a grandfather
clause in Tresidder's statement of
regulations.
Norma Tarquino explained that
Tutti Fiori is very much like a nor
mal florist in function and earnings
except for its more relaxed atmos
phere.
She said she enjoys being on
campus, where the business is
good, but the additional pressure of
preparing flowers for weddings,
funerals or other occasions is
usually nonexistent.
On the other hand, the burdens
of transporting the plants and set
ting up the stall on a daily basis,
combined with changing weather
conditions, often serve to compli
cate the job, she said.
The othei non-craft stand in
White Plaza is located next to the
Stanford Ponkstore. Maria Dallas
and her son, Paul, may be found
there on a daily basis selling their
variety of fresh fruits.

Dallas, who used to run the stand
with her husband, has been here for
15 years, ever since her retire
ment.
The job involves rising at an early
hour every morning in order to buy
the fruit before coming to campus.
It is not the most financially
profitable job, she said.
Dallas is quick to point out that
her job is fine for a retired person
and that money is not the reason
she runs the stand.
"It gives me something to work
for, especially in my old age," she
said.
Taking a philosophical stance,
Dallas points out that she believes
"the important thing in life is to
find happiness and to do sone goo 1
for others."
Dallas said she is glad that she
contribr f es to the F of
students. She addeu that she lias
found satisfaction in her own life
through interaction with the stu
dents and the peaceful atmosphere
of the campus.
The native Italian said she views
the campus as a haven free from
the rush and confusion of the
outside world. She noted that Stan
ford reminds her of the pace of life
in Italy.
Artistic appreciation
David Anderson, designer,
crafter and seller of his own
jewelry, said he sees the campus as
a place where his art is appreciated
and the students are receptive to
his work.
Anderson, who has worked as a
vendor at Stanford for eight years,
said he believes that perhaps be
cause of the international element
or perhaps because of the high level
of awareness, the students seem to

be able to recognize quality in art.
Anderson, a native New Yorker
with a degree in psychology, said
he enjoys the feedback he receives
on campus from his customers.
Anderson said customer feed
back has "helped to mold me as an
artist."
For a student who wants to deco
rate a dorm room instead of an
earlobe, Eugene MacNeill is to be
found nearby. His selection of rugs
ranges in price from $25 to $200.
MacNeill said he got his start
when a friend went out of business
and left MacNeill the firm's
remains. MacNeill sold these items
at the San Jose Flea Market and
found this vending to be profitable
enough to start his own business.
He relocated to the Stanford
campus and has remained here, on
and off, for nearly 15 years. Mac-
Neill said he finds that his custom
ers are split fairly evenly among

students, their parents, and faculty.
MacNeill said he enjoys the Plaza
environment, characterizing it as a
relaxed one in which one "doesn't
have to worry about theft."
However, "every day is a
gamble," he said.
One day, for example, he sus
tained a $1,000 loss because his
rugs were destroyed by a sudden
rain storm.

the University of Connecticut,
