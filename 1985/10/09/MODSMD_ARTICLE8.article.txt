# Stanford grad relates impressions
## Grothe Discusses South Africa 
### JOYA WESLEY Senior staff writer 
Emphasizing "dramatic changes"
in South Africa during the past five
years, Stanford graduate Peter
Grothe spoke to a small group of
faculty and students about his
recent visit to that country.
Supplementing his speech with
an emotionally stirring slide
presentation, Grothe gave a brief
overview of his impressions of life
in various areas of South Africa.
Grothe, a professor at the Mon
terey Institute of International
Studies, prefaced his remarks by
saying that he was not an expert on
South Africa. He did, however, ad
mit to having some knowledge of
the country's current situation.
"My ignorance is somewhat less
than that of Jerry Falwell, or, for
that matter, than the president of
the United States," he said.
Through his friendships with
both black and white South
Africans, Grothe was able to travel

somewhat freely and to observe the
system of apartheid from many
angles. Although his first inclination
was to observe with the objectivity
of an academic or a journalist, he
found he could not.
"It's very difficult, unless you
have a slab of granite for a heart,
not to speak of South Africa without
some passion," he said.
While traveling through such
major cities as Pretoria and Johan

nesberg, Grothe noticed that many
of the signs distinguishing white
facilities from non-white facilities
had been removed. He noticed
also, however, that in some cases
the indication of such facilities had
simply become more sophisticated.
For example, such phrases as "right
of admission reserved" may be re
garded as euphemisms for these
distinctions.
The new attitudes Grothe saw

displayed in the solidarity between
black and white in villages like
Crossroads, the new sense of
power shown by blacks in such ac
tions as the boycott of white-owned
businesses and the strong white op
position to the government's state
of emergency, lead him to believe
that a change in the structure is
likely very soon.
In his description of life within
black townships such as Soweto,
Grothe related the well-known hor
rors of small aluminum homes
housing more than 20 people, un
derstaffed schools and mal
nourished children. In contrast,
however, he illustrated both ver
bally and with his slides the humor
and goodwill the blacks exhibit
depite the "depth of bitterness"
that is generally felt for the op
pressive government.
The view of divestment among
South African blacks arose in an
swer to a question.
"They favor it even though they
know it would hurt them economi
cally, " he said.
