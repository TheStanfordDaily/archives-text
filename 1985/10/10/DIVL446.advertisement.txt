UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH
GRANTS AVAILABLE
Undergraduate Research Opportunities again invites undergraduates to apply for research
grant funding through the Fund for Undergraduates' Research. Last year 20 Firestone
Grants and 34 Small Grants were awarded.
The difference between the Firestone Major Grants and the Small Grants for Undergraduate
Research Expenses is the scope of the proposed project, not the level of expense reim
bursement requested. Firestone Major grants will be given to the finest proposals for re
search over three quarters or more regardless of how little or how much funding may be
needed. Firestone Grants are awarded to twenty-five students each spring whose extended
projects reflect the highest level of creativity and independence with the greatest promise
for exciting results.
These grants may cover actual expenses incurred in research projects, including but not
limited to: travel to and from the research site, reproduction of documents or data, equip
ment, materials, computer time, subject fees, thin sections. Expenses which cannot be paid
with these grants include tuition for instruction at Stanford or elsewhere, fees for programs
offered by outside agencies, wordprocessing, and other write-up costs. The appropriate
ness of other expenses not named herein will be decided on a case-by-case basis.
To apply for a grant, students must complete the designated application form, including a
research proposal, budget, and letter of endorsement from a faculty sponsor. Firestone
Grant applications are due on April 7, 1986. Small grant applications are due on November
1, 1985 (for grants to be awarded on December 1) and on April 7, 1986 (for grants to be
awarded on June 1). Applications and samples of previous winning proposals are available
at the URO Office, 590-A Old Union. If you have questions, call URO Director Laura S.
Selznick at 497-3828 or stop by the URO Office.
