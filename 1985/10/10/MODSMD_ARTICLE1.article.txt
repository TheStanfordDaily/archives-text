# Contract Talks Move Forward
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Staff writer 
Contract negotiations with United Stanford Workers
moved slightly yesterday, as University officials gave
USW their latest proposals, including a new wage in
crease.
"Little" progress was made, but the union will
respond, according to Mary Ann Tenuto, chief
negotiator for the union. "Now it's our turn to make
some movement," she said.
Both sides said they were hopeful about coming to
terms on the new contract.
"We told them we were really interested in getting a
contract settled," said Priscilla Wheeler, staff counsel
and chief negotiator for the University.
Yesterday's three-year wage offer by the University
calls for annual increases of 4, 2.5 and 3 percent in the
bargaining unit's $33.6 million wage base.
In addition, if the rate of inflation were to rise faster
than the wage hikes, a cost-of-living adjustment (up to
25 cents per hour) would be made.
Currently, the union is seeking to negotiate a two
year contract with wage increases of 12.8 percent in
the first year and 9.25 percent in the second year.
"This offer may seem small compared with your
proposals . . . but we urge you to consider it carefully.
It will generate real salary increases for your unit,"
Wheeler told USW.
The proposed increases are not enough, however,
according to the union. "We don't think the proposal is
reasonable," Tenuto said, adding that non-union
workers have received an average wage increase of 7
percent.
While there may have been movement in the wage
issue during yesterday's discussion, there was no
progress made in resolving the controversy over pen
sions, medical benefits and job security — the issue
over which the two sides have the biggest differences.
Both sides maintained their earlier views on the job
security question.
Wheeler said the negotiations would benefit most if
the two sides were to concentrate first on issues on
which they can reach agreement.
In yesterday's talks, the union's pension expert "had
an exchange with the University," according to
Tenuto. The University has said the union's pension
proposal would mean a 50 percent increase of the
$33.6 million wage base, while the union has said the
increase would be "negligible."
The discrepancy arises from the
University figuring the cost of the
plan over one year, while the union
is figuring the cost for a period of 20
or 30 years, she said.
The two sides have also
disagreed on the cost of the union's

medical proposal. The University's
estimate is three times the union's
estimate.
The University "is assuming
what could increase (the cost) with
out considering what could
decrease it," Tenuto said.
But Wheeler said the University
was not proposing any increases to
the medical benefits.
The two have agreed to meet
again Saturday.
