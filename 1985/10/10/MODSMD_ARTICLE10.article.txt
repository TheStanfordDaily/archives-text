## THE 						STANFORD DAILY An Independent Newspaper Punish Drunk Drivers 
### 
Drinking and driving mix as well as oil and water.
It's a well-known fact, but apparently some
people don't know it, forget it or think they can han
dle their alcohol better than the other guys, the
ones that cause accidents and kill innocent people.
Maybe they have to consume more alcohol to
reach the same level of drunkenness, but the result
is the same: a drunk and dangerous driver.
In 1981, a drunk student crashed the car he was
driving into a tree on Campus Drive, killing two stu
dents riding in the car.
This past April, another student, allegedly driving
under the influence of alcohol, wiped out a few
bicycles parked in front of Florence Moore Hall.
Fortunately, neither he nor his passengers were
injured before his BMW was parked.
Joseph Anderson was charged with violating the
Fundamental Standard for driving "his car in a condi
tion and in a manner inconsistent with the rights and
welfare of others on this campus."
And then he was given a slap on the wrist: a
suspended, one-quarter suspension; prohibition
from driving or storing a motor vehichle on campus
for one quarter after he returns from Oxford; and a
choice between a $200 fine and 40 hours of public
service work.
Perhaps leniency was appropriate, since the An
derson case is the first of its kind to be labelled a
violation of the Fundamental Standard, but the Uni
versity should take this opportunity to set a clear
and severe policy for the future regarding drunk

driving by students on campus.
The recently announced policy is neither. The
University will wait for special cases to be brought
to its attention. Individual circumstances will then
determine which students are penalized.
Unfortunately, automobiles weighing thousands
of pounds are not selectively dangerous. Walking
and biking are the primary methods of transporta
tion on this campus, and at any given hour of the day
or night pedestrians and bicyclists can be found on
the streets. Imagine one drunk driver on Campus
Drive, concentrating on the oncoming headlights,
forgetting or not seeing the bicyclist riding in front
of him. That bicylist could be you, riding home late
from Meyer Library, or me riding back from visiting
a friend across campus. It would only take one of
these situations to occur for you or me to die.
Drunk driving is an especially dangerous proposi
tion here, and an unnecessary one, as nearly all
Stanford parties are within walking or biking dis
tance.
To combat it, the University should check with
the Stanford Police Department, once a week, to
obtain the names of all those arrested on campus for
drunk driving. A one- to two-year suspension for
students found on this list may not be too harsh a
penalty.
The policy should not be a secret, and it should
not be case-by-case. It should be straightforward
and stringent â€” because every drunk driver is a po
tential murderer.
