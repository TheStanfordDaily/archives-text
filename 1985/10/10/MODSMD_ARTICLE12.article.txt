# The 						Role of Student Activism in the Battle Against Apartheid
## 
### 
The spring of 1985 saw a tremendous up
surge in the student movement nationwide,
with a hotbed of activity here at Stanford.
Because of this enthusiastic activity, Stan
ford Out of South Africa (SOSA) was
formed, with the expressed goal of de
manding both total divestment and support
of the liberation struggles in South Africa.
SOSA quickly became a leading voice
calling for immediate measures, partly due
to the progressive stands it took in its on
going battle with the Kennedy administra
tion, and partly because many of the per
sons and organizations that had been doing
divestment work prior to the spring were
instrumental in the forming of SOSA, in
cluding the Black Student Union, Stanford
African Students Association, Asian Ameri
can Students Association, Coalition Against
Apartheid and Students Against
Reaganism.
However, to truly understand why the
anti-apartheid movement overall had such
growth and influence, attention must be
turned to South Africa itself, and the
struggles of the oppressed Azanian people.
(Azania is the black-African name given to
South Africa.) Starting in 1984, sustained
struggle took place throughout that country
on a level previously achieved only sporadi
cally.
The liberation struggle hasuiot only con
tinued unabated in 1985, but has continually
escalated, sparking off the currently
nationwide divestment movement. In the
fall of 1984, the Free South Africa Move
ment began with civil disobediance protest

at the South African Embassy in Washing
ton, D.C. In April of 1985, a massive sit-in
at Columbia University marked the begin
ning of the campus protests.
The push for divestment continued
throughout the spring. Thousands of stu
dents, outraged at the direct support for
the apartheid system that Stanford's invest
ments in South Africa represent, partici
pated in anti-apartheid activities, including
the sit-in and vigil at Mandela Free Univer
sity (the Quad outside Kennedy's office),
meetings with the Board of Trustees and a
public forum to debate divestment, educa
tional teach-ins, and civil disobediance di
rected at exposing the role of the Univer
sity and the trustees.
What became very clear during spring
quarter was the complete lack of student
control of University policies and decisions
that directly and indirectly affect the Uni
versity community. The people that made
the University with their presence and
money — the students, faculty, staff and
workers — were dependent on the trus
tees, a small group of conservative busi
ness people, for all financial and policy deci
sions of any import, including divestment.
To try to predict what the fall has in store
for the movement at Stanford, the condi
tions in South Africa must be examined. As
in the spring, when an upsurge in the
struggle of the Azanian people led to
massive demonstrations in the United
States, the events of the summer and fall in
South Africa have and will dictate the inten
sity of the movement here. Early in the

summer, South African President P.W.
Botha declared a state of emergency
throughout many regions of intensified
struggle.
The toll on people of color from the in
creased repression has been staggering:
since July over 700 dead at the hands of the
police, many more wounded and more than
2,000 detained indefinitely without charges
and without rights. A recent report from a

South African doctor gave the horrifying
news that over 80 percent of those
detained are being tortured.
The immediate future looks grim: The
entrenched regime is taking a hard line in
the face of mounting domestic and interna
tional pressure. Troops armed to the teeth
with sophisticated weapons battle people
armed only with rocks, gasoline bombs and
a fervent desire for liberation. The black
people of Azania possess two critical re
sources that ensure eventual victory: the
vast majority of that nation's population and
an unquenchable desire for the rights and
land that are rightfully theirs, by virtue of
their native birth.
In much greater doubt is the amount of

time it will take to achieve freedom and
justice in that land of repression and in
justice. This is the area in which interna
tional pressure is critical. Disinvestment of
multi-national corporations from South
Africa must be pushed for.
However, swift justice will only be
assured with united international support
for the forces struggling for liberation in
South Africa. In recent months, significant
corporations have started to withdraw from
South Africa, including the United States'
12th-largest corporation, Philbro-Salomon;
and although their motives may be strictly
in the interest of profit margins, the effects
of the pullouts are devastating to the eco
nomic stability of the apartheid regime. The
recent foreign flight caused South Africa's
currency, the rand, to reach an all-time low
of 35 cents, which in turn forced a shut
down of the South African stock market for
almost a week in late August.
In the face of changing conditions — spe
cifically the escalation to a full liberation
struggle of the oppressed of South Africa
— SOSA must broaden the level of partici
pation to make this a truly broad and
diverse movement, with one emphasis on
education. This education is critical in win
ning divestment, because when students
understand the facts about the current sit
uation in South Africa, diversionary argu
ments from Kennedy and company will no
longer confuse and divide them. And in or
der to force the trustees to make the deci
sion to divest, which is vital, a majority of
the Stanford community is going to have to

be united around the call to pull out. With
out the pressure of numbers, the board will
continue to avoid this critical issue. In addi
tion, to truly aid the struggle for a demo
cratic South Africa, the anti-apartheid
movement must expand the movement to
include material aid to liberation organiza
tions.
The student movement at Stanford has a
tremendous opportunity to pressure the
administration on a whole spectrum of
backward stances: its union-busting antics
with the USW (the University would ulti
mately like a complete removal of unioniza
tion and with it economic security for the
workers at Stanford); the role of the
Hoover Institution and its specific relation
to Stanford; the demands of oppressed
nationality students for educational and cul
tural resources, stronger recruitment and
affirmative action and an end to the racist
Western Culture requirement; and, of
course, the administration's reactionary
stance on divestment.
This fall, students who care about the
world they live in, whether it's in South
Africa or Stanford, now have an extraordi
nary opportunity to "make a difference" (to
quote Donald Kennedy). While significantly
adding to the struggle for peace and
equality in South Africa, students will
achieve greater say over their university
and their own lives.
