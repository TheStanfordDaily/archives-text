The Quest for the
Ideal College Life
Thanks and congratulations to
Steve Phillips for his fine summary
("Question Authority") of the con
cerns that have faced many of us
who have felt a void in our
"Stanford experience."
Though we have wanted
desperately to embrace and take
pride in our Stanford education, we
could not, to a large degree, be
cause of the very issues Phillips
raises. That he does so in the
context of a speech by University
President Donald Kennedy is par
ticularly appropriate, as Kennedy
is the front man for the arrogance
and insensitivity that is too often
characteristic of the administration
at Stanford. Kennedy, through his
wit and easygoing manner, is sin
cerely well-liked, even by those of
us who don't always agree with his
point of view. This makes him the
most dangerous of all of those in
power, for we tend to believe that
there is truth in his eloquence. We
gloss over the issues just because
he makes us laugh at Commence
ment.
Phillips' message is important —
one that should not be forgotten in
these times of yuppies, BMW's and
the quest for the perfect tan. More

often than we have been, we must
look at ourselves and the injustices
around us and ask ourselves,
"Why?" and follow that question
with another: "What can we do
about it?" With his thought
provoking essay, Phillips has
shown us how to ask these
valuable questions in some very
important areas of our Stanford
experience and the world around
us.

Who Are the Real
'Isolationists?'
President Reagan's withdrawal
of the United States from the com
pulsory jurisdiction of the World
Court brings up once again two
questions that many have been
asking for the last four years: How
far is the American public going to
let the present Administration go
in destroying the progress that the
United States has slowly made
toward establishing a peaceful
world of cooperation among na
tions? Is the United States to be
accountable to no one?
We all know that President
Carter's shaky beginnings at re
establishing a sense of goodwill in

Latin America have been utterly
negated by Reagan. And we all can
see that, if anything, the level of
violence has been escalated in that
region, and that now, to a far
greater degree than before Reagan
came into office, the opposing
factions in Latin America are
unable to talk.
Now Reagan continues his same
mistake, carrying it to an incredible
length by withdrawing the United
States from an international body
specifically designed to enourage
intercourse between nations and
the peaceful reconciliation of
disputes. How much will it take
before the American public notices
what is going on and stops Reagan
from continuing to ravage the deli
cate and hard-worked-for roots of
international cooperation?
Reagan argues that the court is
being used for "political-public
relations purposes," and that this
is his reason for withdrawing the
United States. Note that Reagan
criticizes not the court itself, but
the "purposes" of those prosecut
ing the United States. Since when
do "bad" motivations on the part of
one's prosecutors justify one's
withdrawal from the court itself?
And I respectfully remind Reagan
that one of those prosecutors is an
American, and a respected Har-

vard Law School professor at that.
People who criticize Reagan for
sending aid to the contra rebels
and to the government of El Sal
vador are often criticized for being
"isolationists." Now that Reagan
has repeatedly broken international
law, toned down his support for
the United Nations and even
withdrawn from the compulsory
jurisdiction of the World Court, we
have to ask ourselves, Who are the
real isolationists?
