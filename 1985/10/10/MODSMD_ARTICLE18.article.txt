## Grad Models Japanese Health 
### C.R. DOUGLAS 
For one Stanford graduate, the
human biology major has
translated into an international
crusade for health awareness.
Laural Skurko, Class of '85, is
leaving Tuesday for Japan to
develop a health fitness program
that implements what she learned
during her time at Stanford.
As a freshman at Stanford,
Laurel helped with the health im
provement program at Cowell
Student Health Center. Her in
volvement included teaching stu
dents about nutrition, exercise
and the major aspects of health
promotion.
As she pursued her major,
Laurel was an intern with the
Medical Center's Heart Disease
Prevention Program. Focusing
her work on their communication
campaign, Skurko was concerned
with how to change the mass atti
tude toward heart disease.
As the founder of Stanford
Aerobics, Skurko continued her
active participation in health
promotion throughout her time at
Stanford.
"As I delved into my major, I
started applying what I was learn
ing and studying to my aerobics
program." she recalled.
Since graduating, Skurko has
served as the health and fitness
director of the local YMCA as well
as a lecturer and instructor for
Healthworks, a local corporate fit
ness program.
Working as a model has taken
Laurel to Japan every summer
since she came to Stanford. She
plans to translate her modeling
work, which has centered around
sportswear, swimming and biking,
into a successful crusade for
health care through the health
club that she will start.
"As a model, I began to get a
better understanding of the
Japanese attitude toward health,"
said Skurko.
Skurko claims that there are

three main aspects to creating
good health care habits among
people — knowledge, attitude and
behavior. She said that knowledge
about the body and conscientious
attitudes on health care are easy
to create, but the hardest thing is
trying to get people to change
their behavior.
"The corporate people need
much stronger incentives to go,
because of the strong competition

that pervades society," said
Skurko.
Skurko says she will concen
trate on teaching the Japanese the
necessity of developing good
health care habits and on creating
a fun environment in which to do
it.
So as Skurko makes her way to
Japan, she takes with her a wealth
of health experience that she
developed here.

"Health is a diverse field. There
are many different angles you can
take. I really needed the freedom
to choose a focus and to choose it
in a gradual way. One starts with
the core, and then stems out,"
she explained.
"1 want to steer away from the
commercial side of health, be
cause through the commercial
struggle for health, people are
losins; out," she worried.

Laurel Skurko, a 1985 Hum Bio graduate, used her knowledge of the human body to start
Stanford Aerobics during her student years. This now helps her promote health awareness in
Japan, where she is a top model.
