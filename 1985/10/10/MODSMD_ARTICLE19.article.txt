# CAMPUS COMPENDIUM

All the coach's men
Reporters uncovered what may turn into a veritable Silogate when they
recorded the voice of Nebraska Cornhuskers basketball Coach Moe Iba
coming from inside a cloistered gym where team members were allegedly
practicing eight days before the NCAA's Oct. 15 starting date.
The University of Nebraska newspaper reported that its reporter and
photographer stood outside the gym and listened to the players running on
the court and to Iba and his assistants shouting instructions.
Towels blocked the windows, and the doors were locked, they re
ported.
Socrates could teach them a few things at MIT
A columnist for The Tech, MlT's student newspaper, expressed his
horror that finally, at the beginning of this year, it was announced that the
school's library materials would be converted to computer cataloguing.
Dewey of decimal system fame is probably rolling in his grave, but after
a $600,000 allocation, this techie haven should find even more green
screened terminals smiling out at students.
Student protest returns to Kent State
The top story of the Daily Kent Stater at the start of the year was Ohio
Student Association President Todd Baker's protest of the 98 percent tui
tion hike since 1979.
He paid his $633 instructional fees with eight $50 bills, three $20 bills
and 33 $1 bills, holding up the registration line for five full minutes.
No one called the police to break up the disturbance, which went almost
unnoticed.
"There wasn't a lot of realization there because I had my back to the
line," said the political science/history major. "I explained to the cashier
what I was doing, and she said, What, are you trying to take it out on
me:
Baker said that he understands the university's need for funds after
working with student government for three years, but he also pointed out
that only Vermont, New Hampshire and Delaware require that students
pay a higher percentage of their education costs.
A tree grows in Berkeley
Well, actually there'll be a few in Oakland, too, but who can pass up a
good allusion?

Students and community members gathered one fine weekend to shovel
some clods, share some shrubbery (not particularly tall ones, but nice
ones) and deck Martin Luther King, Jr. Way with holly, as it were.
The event was sponsored to solve the age-old problem of putting round
trees into sidewalk holes. Was that how it went?
Anyway, about 2,000 strong backs arrived one Saturday morning wield
ing spades, and 'Let there be trees,' as someone important once said.
What are they talking about?
If courses like organic chemistry and partial differential equations
weren't incomprehensible enough on their own, Penn State decided to
combine them with their extensive foreign TA training program.
One math class was mystified for the first three weeks of class each
time the instructor talked about the symbol "kie" until he wrote the Greek
symbol for psi on the blackboard, and the class suddenly caught on.
University officials argued that the TAs in the classrooms have been
carefully screened before being handed a class to command.
Officials at the University of Pittsburgh gave tuition refunds to students
who claimed they could not learn in their classes because of the heavy ac
cents of some TAs, but Penn State officials called this policy a disaster and
a sanction for poor study habits by providing an easy out.
Climbing out of the vault
The perennial problem of how to get to visit your friend of the opposite
sex is no longer such a problem at Indiana University, where two closed
visitation, single-sex floors remain as the last bastions of strict co
educational segregation at this Bloomington campus.
The demand for closed-visitation floors was virtually nil this year, ac
cording to Buck Walters, assistant director for housing and assignments.
The problem is, residential education policy mandates that closed visita
tion halls be offered as alternatives in at least one male and one female
dorm.
So one floor in Willkie Quad, a male dorm, and one in Forest Quad, a
female dorm, remain closed completely to visitors of the opposite sex —
even if the visitors are members of a resident's family.
Most students are now picked randomly to live in the so-called "vaults,"
because actual requests to live on the closed-visitation halls have nearly
stopped altogether.
Some students, including senior Inge Dix, who lived in the "vault"
during her first year, are frustrated at having to live this way.
Dix recalled the locked door on the elevator she had to key before

gaining access to her floor. "I lived two steps from the elevator, and we
used to get guys up there, and they'd run into my room and then crawl
through the phone boxes to other girls' rooms," she said.
Of course, there are some girls who are in the "vault" by parental fiat.
Samantha McKee, a sophomore, recalled her father's rationale for having
her live on the closed-visitation floor of Forest Quad.
"He figured you have enough problems when you're a freshman without
having to worry about your roommate having her boyfriend spending the
night," she said.
The story of the unwitting BMOC
Sam Wakim had no idea what was in store for his 20th birthday. Not the
foggiest.
So when he started getting phone calls from strange women the morn
ing of his birthday, this Indiana University senior didn't know what to
think. The calls didn't stop, either — by early afternoon up to 40 women
had called his room asking to speak to him.
What was the key to Wakim's sudden popularity?
He found out that night when one of the many admirers who'd called told
him she'd seen his phone number on a flier and had taken it from there.
Turns out Wakim's roommate, senior Steve Griebel, and three of
Wakim's other friends were behind the stunt. They had 500 fliers printed
up advertising Wakim's imminent entrance into his second decade, and
they posted them up on the eve of his birthday.
Urging "attractive, bright, sensitive, caring" IU women to give Wakim a
ring on his 20th, the flyers go on to pay tribute to Wakim's appealing
qualities:
"Sam Wakim is tall, dark and handsome! He's a good student. Some
would even call him a 'mover and shaker' on the IU campus. Next year,
Sam plans to go to medical school. This year, he's looking for a little added
excitement in his life," the fliers read.
The fliers also exhorted callers to spend some time with Wakim during
the upcoming year. However, nobody has yet made his roommate a "solid
offer," Griebel said.
Marksmanship 101
Two groups of students from rival Pakistani universities started shoot
ing at each other with AK47s as a result of some unspecified falling out the
other day.
No one was hurt, according to AP News Service.

All the coach's men
Reporters uncovered what may turn into a veritable Silogate when they
recorded the voice of Nebraska Cornhuskers basketball Coach Moe Iba
coming from inside a cloistered gym where team members were allegedly
practicing eight days before the NCAA's Oct. 15 starting date.
The University of Nebraska newspaper reported that its reporter and
photographer stood outside the gym and listened to the players running on
the court and to Iba and his assistants shouting instructions.
Towels blocked the windows, and the doors were locked, they re
ported.
Socrates could teach them a few things at MIT
A columnist for The Tech, MlT's student newspaper, expressed his
horror that finally, at the beginning of this year, it was announced that the
school's library materials would be converted to computer cataloguing.
Dewey of decimal system fame is probably rolling in his grave, but after
a $600,000 allocation, this techie haven should find even more green
screened terminals smiling out at students.
Student protest returns to Kent State
The top story of the Daily Kent Stater at the start of the year was Ohio
Student Association President Todd Baker's protest of the 98 percent tui
tion hike since 1979.
He paid his $633 instructional fees with eight $50 bills, three $20 bills
and 33 $1 bills, holding up the registration line for five full minutes.
No one called the police to break up the disturbance, which went almost
unnoticed.
"There wasn't a lot of realization there because I had my back to the
line," said the political science/history major. "I explained to the cashier
what I was doing, and she said, What, are you trying to take it out on
me:
Baker said that he understands the university's need for funds after
working with student government for three years, but he also pointed out
that only Vermont, New Hampshire and Delaware require that students
pay a higher percentage of their education costs.
A tree grows in Berkeley
Well, actually there'll be a few in Oakland, too, but who can pass up a
good allusion?

Students and community members gathered one fine weekend to shovel
some clods, share some shrubbery (not particularly tall ones, but nice
ones) and deck Martin Luther King, Jr. Way with holly, as it were.
The event was sponsored to solve the age-old problem of putting round
trees into sidewalk holes. Was that how it went?
Anyway, about 2,000 strong backs arrived one Saturday morning wield
ing spades, and 'Let there be trees,' as someone important once said.
What are they talking about?
If courses like organic chemistry and partial differential equations
weren't incomprehensible enough on their own, Penn State decided to
combine them with their extensive foreign TA training program.
One math class was mystified for the first three weeks of class each
time the instructor talked about the symbol "kie" until he wrote the Greek
symbol for psi on the blackboard, and the class suddenly caught on.
University officials argued that the TAs in the classrooms have been
carefully screened before being handed a class to command.
Officials at the University of Pittsburgh gave tuition refunds to students
who claimed they could not learn in their classes because of the heavy ac
cents of some TAs, but Penn State officials called this policy a disaster and
a sanction for poor study habits by providing an easy out.
Climbing out of the vault
The perennial problem of how to get to visit your friend of the opposite
sex is no longer such a problem at Indiana University, where two closed
visitation, single-sex floors remain as the last bastions of strict co
educational segregation at this Bloomington campus.
The demand for closed-visitation floors was virtually nil this year, ac
cording to Buck Walters, assistant director for housing and assignments.
The problem is, residential education policy mandates that closed visita
tion halls be offered as alternatives in at least one male and one female
dorm.
So one floor in Willkie Quad, a male dorm, and one in Forest Quad, a
female dorm, remain closed completely to visitors of the opposite sex —
even if the visitors are members of a resident's family.
Most students are now picked randomly to live in the so-called "vaults,"
because actual requests to live on the closed-visitation halls have nearly
stopped altogether.
Some students, including senior Inge Dix, who lived in the "vault"
during her first year, are frustrated at having to live this way.
Dix recalled the locked door on the elevator she had to key before

gaining access to her floor. "I lived two steps from the elevator, and we
used to get guys up there, and they'd run into my room and then crawl
through the phone boxes to other girls' rooms," she said.
Of course, there are some girls who are in the "vault" by parental fiat.
Samantha McKee, a sophomore, recalled her father's rationale for having
her live on the closed-visitation floor of Forest Quad.
"He figured you have enough problems when you're a freshman without
having to worry about your roommate having her boyfriend spending the
night," she said.
The story of the unwitting BMOC
Sam Wakim had no idea what was in store for his 20th birthday. Not the
foggiest.
So when he started getting phone calls from strange women the morn
ing of his birthday, this Indiana University senior didn't know what to
think. The calls didn't stop, either — by early afternoon up to 40 women
had called his room asking to speak to him.
What was the key to Wakim's sudden popularity?
He found out that night when one of the many admirers who'd called told
him she'd seen his phone number on a flier and had taken it from there.
Turns out Wakim's roommate, senior Steve Griebel, and three of
Wakim's other friends were behind the stunt. They had 500 fliers printed
up advertising Wakim's imminent entrance into his second decade, and
they posted them up on the eve of his birthday.
Urging "attractive, bright, sensitive, caring" IU women to give Wakim a
ring on his 20th, the flyers go on to pay tribute to Wakim's appealing
qualities:
"Sam Wakim is tall, dark and handsome! He's a good student. Some
would even call him a 'mover and shaker' on the IU campus. Next year,
Sam plans to go to medical school. This year, he's looking for a little added
