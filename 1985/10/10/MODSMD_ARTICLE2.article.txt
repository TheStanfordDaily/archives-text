Space Axe
Several students celebrated astronaut William Fisher and several Axe
plaques yesterday in a ceremony at Tresidder Union. The plaques,
engraved with Big Game scores, are certified by NASA to have successfully
completed a recent journey on the space shuttle "Discovery" with Fisher.
One of the plates he took on the mission is engraved with the score from the
disputed 1982 Big Game. Stanford is the victor according to the plaque's
score of 20-19. Fisher, a Stanford alumnus, even displayed a "Beat Cal"
banner on television from the shuttle. Holding the plaque are Stanford's Axe
Committee Chairman Mike Tuchin and Kevin Solliday, the former chairman.
