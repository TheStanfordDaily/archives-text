# Spirituality and Powerful Rock March Side By Side in Stryper
## 
### LIZ GOODMAN 
They don't look any different than the typical hard
rock band. They fit the standard, long-haired, guitar
wielding, spandex-clad visual stereotype. But beyond
appearances, Stryper is far different from any of its
predecessors.
Stryper is so unique, in fact, that it has caught the at
tention of such notable publications as Time and
Newsweek, and it has appeared on the "CBS Evening
News" twice. Stryper is the first of its kind — a Chris
tian heavy-metal band.
In a genre so predominated by themes of violence
and satanism, Stryper offers a refreshing new outlook,
and from the genuine enthusiasm exhibited by the audi
ence Monday night at the Concord Pavilion, it is ob
vious that Christians and non-Christians alike are lis
tening.
"People are beginning to realize," said drummer
Robert Sweet in an interview before the concert,"that
it's possible to play rock 'n' roll and really have a good,
positive message to it."
Stryper, which also includes Michael Sweet on lead
vocals and rhythm guitar, Oz Fox on lead guitar and
Tim Gaines on bass, has been spreading this message
since 1983. The name itself contains a biblical refer
ence (Isaiah 53:5) that states, "By His stripes, we are
healed," and the letters stand for "salvation through
redemption yielding peace, encouragement and
righteousness."
But Robert Sweet is quick to state that "Stryper is
not a religious band. If you are a religious band, you
usually promote a certain religion or people going to a
particular church." He explains, "Stryper doesn't do
that. We promote Christ, and as a Christian that is
what you are supposed to do."
Their Christian affiliation has met with a consider
able amount of skepticism. According to Sweet, "1 just
wish skeptics who have never seen us would believe it
because, number one, we are the only group who has

ever done this before, and it takes a lot of guts to stand
up and say you're Christian, especially in the rock 'n'
roll world.
"I know you have to be real to do this," added
Sweet,"to lead an arena of 6,000 to 10,000 people
through a prayer after a concert. I almost guarantee
them that if they come to the show and are able to talk
to us backstage after the concert — that they won't be
skeptics anymore."
The bands that they perform with are also
sometimes sources of skepticism. "A lot of times when
we play with groups that contrast with us, they make
fun of us," said Sweet. "But when they hear us, they
find out that we're competition, and we're just as good
as them.
"I guess I sometimes get tired of people not under
standing that we're really a rock 'n' roll band," said
Sweet. But with the release of their latest album
"Soldiers Under Command," most should get the
message.
"I think that it is an upgrade from our last LP," said
Sweet. "We as the band put Jesus first, and what we
want the public to realize equally I is 1 that we are a rock
'n' roll band. If they don't coordinate equally, then
we're not going to have the impact that we should on
most people."
The title, "Soldiers Under Command," was, if you
haven't guessed by now, inspired by the Bible. "The
Bible states to fight the good fight," explained Sweet.
"Now that doesn't mean to go out and get a gun and
shoot somebody. But it means that we constantly have
to stay on guard and fight the good fight, because we
are constantly tempted to back away from what we're
doing.
"You've got to practice what you preach, you've got
to get out there and not be a hypocrite."
And as far as those in attendance at Monday's con
cert were concerned, Stryper was anything but a hypo
crite, as Bibles passed out during the concert were
readily grabbed.


Stryper has successfully merged rock and a Christian philosophy and are spreading their spritua
message to audiences across the country. The band performed at Concord Pavilion Monday.
