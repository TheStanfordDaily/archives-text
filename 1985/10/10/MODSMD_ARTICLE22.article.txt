# Phil Woods Quintet Hits City Jazz Scene

Relax.
Stanford Type A characters — all impatient, com
petitive and emotional hipsters — take note: There is a
therapy. The intricate, world-class jazz artists playing
in the intimate setting of Kimball's Restaurant will
soothe your soul.
On Saturday, the Phil Woods Quintet played several
gigs at Kimball's. Woods' sax playing is a style most
comparable to the piano playing of the late Count
Basie. Each phrase seems carefully planned before ex
ecution; there are the same moments of silence that
somehow convey almost as much meaning as the notes
themselves.
Woods was voted the number-one alto saxophonist
in the world by a Downbeat magazine reader's poll,
placing above Richie Cole, Ornette Colman and David
Sanborn. In the same poll, the quintet placed fourth,
upstaged by Steps Ahead and the Wynton Marsalis
Quintet.
Nevertheless, during the first set Woods gave the
impression of being a slow starter. His initial solo work
seemed disappointingly dry and uninspiring. This
tentative display was to change dramatically from the
start of the second set, but in the beginning, the sax
player soloed infrequently, passing on the opportunity
to his younger cohorts.
The interplay between bassist Steve Gilmore and
pianist Hal Gelper was especially pleasing. These two
merjibers of the quintet did some tasty duet work that
seemed to approach the jazz ideal of music as spontan
eous conversation. Both Gilmore and Gelper seemed
completely comfortable with each other; their eye con
tact and strange grimaces while trading phrases kept
both in perfect synchronization.
The Phil Woods Quintet has a truly unusual sensitiv

ity and range in dynamic level. None of the equipment
except for the acoustic bass was broadcasted. Instead,
the audience was treated to undistorted sound. The ar
tists could control their intonation and blend at dynamic
levels so low that the opening and closing of the club
door was a real distraction.
Woods' walrus moustache framing his embouchure
stretched and strained to keep up with his stunts. For
example, he accompanied soloists while playing a
clarinet in his left hand, out of the left side of his mouth;
and playing sax out of the right side of his mouth, fin
gering the horn with his right hand.
Kimball's takes its jazz very seriously. Interestingly,
Kimball's is located in the heart of the city across the
street from the gorgeous War Memorial Opera House
and next to the Davies Symphony Hall. This location
seemed an odd place to find San Francisco's premiere
jazz club. However, I was later to learn that the club in
fact gets many "converts" — people who get bored at
their 16th viewing of "The Nutcracker" ballet and hear
the jazz on their way to their cars.
Sharlene Hirsch (who holds a doctorate degree in
education from the Stanford of the East — need we say
more?) is the promoter who brings in the jazz. During
intermissions she was always talking to customers,
sharing their excitement for the solo work that
transpired and listening to suggestions for new artists
to book. It is fortunate for anyone who is interested in
jazz that Hirsch is not in education.
The restaurant aspect of Kimball's seems to be
downplayed during performances. While the club is ac
tually an oyster bar featuring grilled salmon steak,
crayfish, prawns and, of course, several varieties of
oysters, most people seem quite happy without food.
At any rate, the jazz that goes down at this restau
rant is far more nourishing to the soul than the finest
food. If you want to hear the finest of jazz musicians in
the finest of settings, by all means visit Kimball's.
