Selected cuts from these albums will be played on KZSU Uttwrrow at 6 p.m.

Scritti Politti — "Cupid and
Psyche 85"
Scritti Politti suffers from
chronic bad timing. Coming in at
the very end of the rhythm-and
save scene last year, releasing
three 12-inch singles over a
year's time without an album to
accompany them and getting on a
label that won't promote them has
hurt their chances of success con
siderably.
Their music is smooth and pro
fessional, their production is ex
cellent, and their voices are high
and squeaky. It all reminds us of a
British, non-cutesy Michael Jack
son. The music ranges from
reggae to dance to power pop,
with enough hooks in between to
stay interesting.
Of course, the key to this kind
of music is creative gimmickry,
and Scritti has gimmicks aplenty.
Neo-heavy metal guitars slide in
and out before one realizes it; in
scrutable piano parts end songs
abruptly; and tasteful percussion
effects provide beat without
monotony. It all works, believe
us.
Morris Day — "Color of
Success"
★ ★
It's Fun With Factoring this
week on KZSU Picks. Let's use
our factoring abilities to review
Morris Day's new album.

First, factor out our subjective
reviewing style (Then you get a
non-biased review you can
trust.) Then, factor out the 1.
Then, factor out the 1. Then, fac
tor out the 1. Then let both sides
equal zero, add any constant, and
that's how good this album is.

But seriously. This album
really can be broken into its con
stituent parts: repetitive, Time
like synthesizer licks, Morris' vo
cals about himself, other people's
vocals about Morris, the oc
casional Led Zep guitar, mondo
bass line, boom-boom drums and
nothing else.
Not much originality, not much
variety, not much humor. No fab
pix of Morris' spiff threads, and
certainly none of the rest of the
band. Feh. We know that Day has
the talent, the jokes and the
moves to do better. All it would
take to make this album worth a
real review is some imagination.

Madness — "Mad Not Mad"
iriri
There have been some real
changes in the last year and a half
since Madness' last, "Keep
Moving." The lead vocals are
limp, there's less emphasis on the
almighty Beat, and the tone is
decidedly more serious.
Madness seems to be growing
up and leaving Their House a bit
prematurely. This is their third
mass album, and it's their least
bouncy work to date. This is a
shame — Madness could always
be counted on for consistent
wackiness and immediately
catchy song structures. Not no
more.
If anything, the album should
simply have been entitled, "Not
Mad." Besides a few worthy dan
cin' songs, their trademark ska
pop has been abandoned for sick
pop that you wait to get better.
Well, it don't. It just stares at you
pathetically like a dog with a cold.
Perhaps the trouble is the over
emphasis on complexity and so
phistication when the band's
greatest asset was its gift for
simplicity and accessibility. The
songs that stand out on this would
only have been off-tracks on the
earlier albums. So unless you're a
fan of off-tracks, smile, put on
your top hat and stick to the real
stuff.
