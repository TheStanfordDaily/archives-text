## Card Gets Up For 2-0 Win 
### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
Stanford Coach Sam Koch had nothing to worry about after all.
His men's soccer team rolled to a 2-0 shutout victory over the visiting
San Jose State Spartans yesterday and erased any doubt that the team
might not get up for the game.
Cardinal seniors Angel Vasquez and Marshall Monroe scored for the
emerging Stanford offense, while sweeper Phil Horvath and goaltender
Tom Austin spearheaded the consistent Cardinal defense.
Although everything sounds rosy now, just five minutes into the game,
Austin was facing a penalty kick and the prospect of a quick, 1-0 San Jose
lead.
Spartan forward Matt Lord had dribbled into the Stanford penalty box
when Cardinal defenders Neal Stephens and Marshall Monroe took the ball
from him and knocked him down in the process.
That can be illegal, and the referee decided that this time it was. San
Jose was awarded a penalty kick.
The Spartan's leading scorer, Scott Chase, took the shot, and, unfortun
ately for San Jose State, missed. The ball hit the left post and bounced
away.
The relieved Stanford side then proceeded to run San Jose ragged. With
Cardinal fullbacks making offensive runs, Stanford created several good
scoring opportunities.
Seventeen minutes into the half, Stanford had a corner kick, and Koch
made a strategic substitution. Koch sent in corner specialist Giancarlo
Feruzzi. The senior responded by delivering a perfect, line-drive cross
into the penalty box, where the 6-foot-3 Monroe rocketed it off his head
and into the far corner of the net.
With a 1-0 lead, Stanford continued to pressure the Spartans. In one
stretch, Feruzzi had three straight corner kicks.
And just before the end of the half, Feruzzi pushed a soft chip to
midfielder Tom Rafalovich, who headed the ball past San Jose State goalie
Joe Gangale only to have a Spartan defender flick it out at the last second.
In the opening minutes of the second half, the Stanford squad picked up
exactly where it had left off.
Cardinal midfielder Cassio Conceicao curled a direct kick over a wall of
San Jose players that goalie Gangale barely knocked over the crossbar.
San Jose State used long passes to get some scoring chances of their
own in the second half. Spartan forwards Allan Kute and Nick Rotteveel
each had good shots on goal, but Austin calmly gathered in both balls.
Stanford, on the other hand, used short control passes to set up its of
fense. Directing the attack from the midfield was the senior, Vasquez.
About 20 minutes into the second half, Vasquez began and finished a
scoring drive.
He received the ball at midfield and passed the ball to the left wing.
Several passes later, Vasquez booted a free ball on the ground to the left of
the charging goalie, and Stanford had a well-earned 2-0 lead.
As the time left on the clock waned, the play on the field began to get
more physical. Slide tackles by both teams became harder and collisions
got nastier, but the Cardinal hung on for the victory.
