# Spikers vs. SCU
## Tune Up Time Is Tonight 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
In the midst of one of the most
challenging parts of their schedule,
the top-ranked Stanford women's
volleyball team will get a reprieve of
sorts tonight as it travels to Santa
Clara University to battle the un
ranked Broncos.
The Cardinal women, having
defeated N0.2 UCLA and N0.3 Uni
versity of Pacific during the past
week, will host No. 4 San Jose State
tomorrow night, but they must first
get by Santa Clara to remain unde
feated on the season.
Though the Broncos are not as
talented as the likes of UCLA, UOP
and San Jose, they do represent a
challenge for the Cardinal because
they are a relative unknown. "We
haven't seen them play this year,"
Cardinal Co-coach Don Shaw said.
"We're going in blind."
Shaw said he has heard good
reports about the Broncos. "Santa
Clara will be tough," he said. "Their
program is really improving.
They're not that bad."
Shaw said a poor match tonight
could carry over to the San Jose
match. "We'll have the inevitable
letdown," he said. "If we struggle,
that will hurt us Friday night."
Last Friday the Cardinal women
dominated defending-champion
UCLA at Maples Paction in a quick,
three-game match. The Bruins
were playing without two of their
top players — Liz Masakayan and
Dawn Kenny — who were benched
for disciplinary reasons. Neverthe
less, Stanford's play drew praise
from both Shaw and Bruin Coach
Andy Banachowski.
In defeating UOP Monday night,
however, the Cardinal women
lacked concentration at times and
had to struggle to pull out a five
game victory. Shaw said the Card
inal was not sharp in any aspect of

their game.
"We have certain areas we want
to improve on," Shaw said. "We're
going to improve our block, I hope.
We also need to improve our ser
ving and passing. Those are the
main parts of women's volleyball."
In the UOP match, the Cardinal
women were especially suspect in
their hitting, compiling 37 hitting
errors. The errors resulted in a
team hitting percentage of only
.208. Senior All-American Kim
Oden led the team in kills with 26,

but also had nine errors on the night
for a percentage of . 236.
Junior Barbra Fontana was a
bright spot among the mediocrity,
recording 23 kills for a hitting
percentage of .388. Fontana came
up with several kills in crucial spots
throughout the match.
The San Jose match tomorrow
night will not only feature two of the
top four teams in the country, but
two emotional rivals. "They (San
Jose) will be raring to go," Shaw
said. "I'm sure they'll want us."
