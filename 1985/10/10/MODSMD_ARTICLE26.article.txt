# It's a Blue Day in the Baseball Playoffs
## LA 						Tops Tudor 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Los An
geles stole an offensive ploy from
St. Louis last night, and Fernando
Valenzuela pitched the Dodgers to
a 4-1 victory over John Tudor and
the Cardinals in the first game of
the 1985 National League playoffs.
Bill Madlock, acquired by the
Dodgers five weeks ago in a trade
with Pittsburgh, was the offensive
catalyst in both innings in which the
Dodgers scored.
Valenzuela worked six-and-one
third innings for his first victory in
nearly a month, and the Dodgers
scored their runs with the help of an
error, a stolen base and a two-out
squeeze bunt, offensive tactics
more commonly thought of as
belonging to the Cardinals.
The opportunistic Cardinals,
meanwhile, wasted one opportunity

after another against Valenzuela.
The best-of-seven series, which
opened before a Dodger Stadium
crowd of 55,270, continues tonight
with a match of right-handers —
Orel Hershiser, 19-3, of the
Dodgers against Joaquin Andujar,
21-12.
The Dodgers scored one run in
the fourth on an error, a stolen base
and a bloop single by Pedro Guer
rero, then scored three more in the
sixth and chased Tudor with the
help of the bunt. Tudor, who had
won 20 of his last 21 decisions, had
taken a three-hitter into the
Dodgers' big inning.
A loss to Valenzuela on July 20
was the only blemish on Tudor's
record after a 1-7 start. Valenzuela
was rebounding from a poor finish
that saw him go 1-2 with five no

decisions in his final eight starts.
His last win of the regular season
came on Sept. 11 against Atlanta.
Valenzuela gave up seven hits,
walked two and struck out six. Tom
Niedenfuer, who had 19 saves
during the season, worked the final
two-and-two-thirds innings for the
save in this game. Tudor gave up
seven hits in five-and-two-thirds in
nings, walking one and striking out
three.
With one out in the Dodger
fourth, Madlock hit a ground ball to
St. Louis third baseman Terry
Pendleton. The ball hit Pendleton in
the stomach and bounced away, and
before Pendleton could grab it
again, Madlock was safe at first.
Madlock, who had only 10 stolen
bases during the regular season,
then stole second, and he scored
when Guerrero lofted a 1-2 delivery

from Tudor into shallow right field.
Mike Marshall fouled out to left
field and Guerrero, still hampered
by a sore left wrist, stole second.
But Mike Scioscia popped out to
short to end the inning.
The Dodgers started their big
sixth inning, again with one out, and
again it was Madlock who got things
going. Madlock hit a hard ground
ball to shortstop Ozzie Smith's
right. When Smith tried to backhand
the ball, it ran up his arm and
bounced into left field. Madlock
raced to second with what was
ruled a double.
Guerrero was walked intention
ally, and one out later Scioscia sin
gled up the middle to score Madlock
and send Guerrero to third.

Candy Maldonado followed with a
bunt to third. Pendleton fielded it,
but his throw toward home struck
Tudor as Guerrero scored on what
was ruled a bunt single. Scioscia
went to second on the play and
scored when Sax doubled to left.
Valenzuela flew to left to end the
inning.
The Cardinals scored their only
run and finally ended Valenzuela's
outing in the seventh inning.
Pendleton singled to lead off and
went to second on a grounder to
first by Darrell Porter. Pendleton
was forced to hold at third on a
sharply hit single to left by Smith,
but a single by pinch-hitter Tito
Landrum finally scored the Car
dinals' first postseason run.
