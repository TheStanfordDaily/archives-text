						Tops Tudor 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Los An
geles stole an offensive ploy from
St. Louis last night, and Fernando
Valenzuela pitched the Dodgers to
a 4-1 victory over John Tudor and
the Cardinals in the first game of
the 1985 National League playoffs.
Bill Madlock, acquired by the
Dodgers five weeks ago in a trade
with Pittsburgh, was the offensive
catalyst in both innings in which the
Dodgers scored.
Valenzuela worked six-and-one
third innings for his first victory in
nearly a month, and the Dodgers
scored their runs with the help of an
error, a stolen base and a two-out
squeeze bunt, offensive tactics
more commonly thought of as
belonging to the Cardinals.
The opportunistic Cardinals,
meanwhile, wasted one opportunity

after another against Valenzuela.
The best-of-seven series, which
opened before a Dodger Stadium
crowd of 55,270, continues tonight
with a match of right-handers —
Orel Hershiser, 19-3, of the
Dodgers against Joaquin Andujar,
21-12.
The Dodgers scored one run in
the fourth on an error, a stolen base
and a bloop single by Pedro Guer
rero, then scored three more in the
sixth and chased Tudor with the
help of the bunt. Tudor, who had
won 20 of his last 21 decisions, had
taken a three-hitter into the
Dodgers' big inning.
A loss to Valenzuela on July 20
was the only blemish on Tudor's
record after a 1-7 start. Valenzuela
was rebounding from a poor finish
that saw him go 1-2 with five no

decisions in his final eight starts.
His last win of the regular season
came on Sept. 11 against Atlanta.
Valenzuela gave up seven hits,
walked two and struck out six. Tom
Niedenfuer, who had 19 saves
during the season, worked the final
