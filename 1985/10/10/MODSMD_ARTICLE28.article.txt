# Jays Win a Wild One
## 
### 
TORONTO (AP) — A 1 Oliver slapped a single to left
field with two outs in the 10th inning, driving home
Lloyd Moseby from second base and capping a two-run
rally off Kansas City relief ace Dan Quisenberry that
gave the Toronto Blue Jays a 6-5 victory yesterday and
a commanding two-game lead in the American League
playoffs.
Moseby had been the center of controversy in the
top of the 10th, when Kansas City scored to take a 5-4
lead.
But the quick turnaround in the Blue Jays' fortunes
sent the best-of-seven series to Kansas City for Game
3 tomorrow night with the Roayls in an unenviable po
sition.
The Royals started as if they would easily snap their
nine-game postseason losing streak, taking an early 3-
0 lead. But this game was full of twists, and the 10th in
ning was the most dramatic of all.
Willie Wilson scored from second base when center
fielder Moseby trapped Frank White's single with two
outs in the top of the inning, giving Kansas City the
lead for the second time.

White hit a hard liner up the middle. Moseby came
charging in, reached down and scooped up the ball,
raising his glove as if he had made the catch.
Second base umpire Ted Hendry ran toward
Moseby, but did not make an immediate call. Hendry
looked toward crew chief Dave Phillips, who was on
the right-field line, for help, and Phillips waved that
Moseby had trapped the ball.
While all this was happening, Wilson, who led off the
10th with a single and stole second, scampered home.
Different angles showed different results on the
replay. From the side, it looked as if the catch was
clean, but head-on, it appeared the ball had taken a
short hop into Moseby's glove.
Moseby threw up his arms in disbelief at the call, and
left fielder George Bell kicked his glove. Toronto
Manager Bobby Cox raced onto the field and huddled
with all six umpires at second base, but the play stood.
But in the bottom of the 10th, the Blue Jays showed
their character. Tony Fernandez led off with a bouncer
that shortstop Onex Concepcion
grabbed, but double-clutched and
threw late to first for an infield hit.
Fernandez moved to second on a
groundout by Damaso Garcia and
scored to tie the game 5-5 when
Moseby singled to right.
With Bell at the plate, Moseby
got to second when first baseman
Steve Balboni failed to handle a
pickoff throw by Quisenberry.
After Bell flied to center, Oliver
— acquired in midseason from Los
Angeles — slapped an opposite
field single to left, and the speedy
Moseby scored easily ahead of the
throw from Lonnie Smith.
Reliever Tom Henke, who gave
up a tying home run ta pinch-hitter
Pat Sheridan in the top of the ninth,
got the victory, while Quisenberry
took the loss.
Henke entered the game in the
eighth after Gary Lavelle walked
leadoff batter George Brett.
Lavelle had replaced Dennis Lamp,
who retired all 11 Kansas City bat
ters he faced after coming in with
one out in the fourth and a runner
on third with Kansas City ahead 3-
0.
Kansas City Manager Dick How
ser saw his personal postseason
record fall to 0-11 — including
three against the Royals as
manager of the New York Yankees
in 1980.
