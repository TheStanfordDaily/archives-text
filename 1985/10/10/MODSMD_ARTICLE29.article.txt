# Coming Home Is Nice To Do
## Hockey's first home game is a 3-2 win over SJS in overtime 
### MARK SMOYER Staff Writer 
After 70 minutes of regulation play and 20
minutes of overtime, the Stanford field hockey
team finally did what it knew it could. The Card
inal won a conference game, defeating defending
Northern Pacific Conference champion San Jose
State 3-2.
The Card, in its first home game of the
season, upped its record to 2-3-1 overall and 1-
1-1 in the conference. The Spartans drop to 3-3-
1 overall and 1-2-1 in NorPac play.
It was also a big victory for the team's first
year recruits. The tie breaker was scored on a
penalty shot by freshman Dana Fleming with
7:15 remaining in the second overtime. San Jose
State goalkeeper Jackie McGarry committed a
technical by holding on to the ball too long after a
save, giving Fleming a chance at the first goal of
her college career.
After the game, Fleming said there was only
one thought that shot through her mind at that
time — "Oh my God."
Even more dramatic was the goal, scored by
another Card frosh, that put the game into
overtime. With 34 seconds remaining in the

game and the Cardinal down 2-1, Kathy Thomas
got to a loose ball in the circle first.
"All of a sudden the ball spurted out," Thomas
said. And before anyone knew what was happen
ing, the forward from San Diego had pounced on
the ball and put it by McGarry.
Thomas did not realize the pressure of the sit
uation. "If I had known (that there were 34
seconds left) I would've panicked."
"I'm glad I scored," Thomas said, in the un
derstatement of the year.
The first half was uneventful, with neither
team getting many opportunities to score. Both
squads were unforgiving defensively, blocking
passes and breaking up plays.
"It was a little sluggish," Cardinal Coach
Sheryl Johnson said about the first halfs offen
sive action.
The second half was more to the satisfaction
of the large crowd, made up mostly of field
hockey players from two area high schools. With
6:57 gone, the Spartans' Celina Regalia scored
the game's first goal. After a tough shot left
freshman goalie Karen Jones sprawled in front of
the cage, Regalia controlled the rebound and
flicked it by her.

Stanford tied it up 12 minutes later when a
short corner shot by junior Andi Wolpert rico
cheted off a couple sticks and into the cage. The
1-1 tie stood for four minutes until Spartan for
ward Emile Laumans, a freshman from Holland,
broke clear of the Card defense and knocked the
ball easily by Jones at close range.
Neither squad threatened again until Thomas'
thriller kept the Card alive.
Throughout the game, and as it has been all
season, the Stanford defense was super. Seniors
Suzanne Doi, Susan Fischer and Lisa Stewart
consistently stymied the Spartans' efforts.
Doi and Stewart also did a little work on the
offensive end. Doi assisted on the Card's first
goal, and Stewart took two shots, one a powerful
drive from about 30 yards out.
In the cage, Jones saved the Cardinal from the
jaws of defeat many times. The most remarkable
of her feats was the diving kick save of a shot
coming on a two-on-one drive with about five
minutes left in regulation time.
With less than two minutes to go in overtime,
Jones did it again on a high drive from about 10
yards out. "People don't realize what it means to
have such a good goalie," Fleming said.
