### ELAINE RIGGS 
A Costa Rican professor scheduled to speak
Tuesday at Stanford was arrested Monday in
Miami and barred entry to the United States by
U.S. Immigration officials who suspected him of
being a communist and a Cuban national traveling
with false documents, according to Sharon Phil
lips, coordinator of Latin American Studies.
Officials told Rodolfo Cerdas, professor of po
litical science at the University of Costa Rica,
that his only options were to return to Costa
Rica or stay under arrest until the U.S. Embassy
in Mexico City could be contacted, according to
Phillips.
Officials of the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service could not be reached for
comment last night.
Cerdas chose to return to Costa Rica where
he called Phillips to inform her of the incident,
Phillips said.
Officials claimed that Cerdas' previous visa in
dicated that the embassy has a file on Cerdas,

Phillips said.
Cerdas said that he has no knowledge of such
a file and does not know what sort of information
the alleged file could contain, according to Phil
lips.
Cerdas' current visa was used with no prob
lem on his last trip to the United States April 13,
according to a press release from Phillips based
on her conversation with Cerdas.
When Cerdas showed his passport Monday at
customs in Miami, the immigration officer ques
tioned Cerdas as to the purpose of his visit, ac
cording to the release.
Cerdas replied that he was to give a lecture at
Stanford University.
When Cerdas showed the letter of invitation as
proof, all of the documents he was carrying were
confiscated, the release said.
The official questioned Cerdas regarding his
political beliefs, asking Cerdas if he was a com
munist or a member of the Contadora group, ac
cording to Phillips.
After waiting for two hours, Cerdas was told
that "he could not enter into the United States

and that he had no constitutional rights," states
the release.
Cerdas opposed the arrest, noting that he had
not met resistance during his trip to the United
States in April and that his U.S. visa is valid, ac
cording to Phillips.
Immigration officials replied that "his visa was
probably fake, because he was a Cuban traveling
with false documents," said the release.
Cerdas returned to Costa Rica the same day
he arrived in Miami, after being detained by im
migration officials for more than five hours, the
release said.
When officials returned the documents,
Cerdas found that his personal correspondence
had been violated and that five pages of the
paper he was to present at Stanford were mis
sing, according to the release.
Cerdas' canceled lecture, "The Struggle For
Democracy in Central America Today," was to
have been part of a series sponsored by the Cen
ter for Latin American Studies and the Stanford
International Development Education Commit
tee (SIDEC) on the Central American crisis.
