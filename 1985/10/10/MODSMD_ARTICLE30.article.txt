# Best-Of-Seven Playoffs Could Be Better Still
## 
### 
Following the precedent of all other major sports
leagues, major league baseball expanded its playoffs
this year. Instead of allowing more teams to qualify,
though, baseball expanded both league championship
series from a best-of-five to a best-of-seven format.
The idea was a good one. In a sport with a 162-game
regular season, a five-game series is too short to de
termine a league champion. So is a seven-game series,
but it is an improvement.
Baseball is the only major sport to allow only four
teams to advance to postseason play. This makes the
quest for a division title meaningful and makes the end
of the regular season exciting. There have been sug
gestions that baseball go to three divisions and allow a
wild-card runner-up to qualify in each league — a bad
idea.

What baseball needs to do is shorten its regular
season. Should the World Series go seven games, it
would end Oct. 27 — not a good time to play baseball in
Toronto.
The National League is expected to expand to 14
teams in 1987, the same number the American League
currently has. When this happens, baseball should
revert to the 154-game schedule that was used until 25
years ago, having each team play 14 games against
each of the other six teams in its division and 10 against
the league's other seven.
Other sports should take a lead from baseball. This
year, 10 of the 28 teams in the National Football
League, 16 of the 23 teams in the National Basketball
Association, and 16 of the 21 teams in the National
Hockey League will make the playoffs.
The NFL now allows two wild-card teams in each
conference. There should only be one, so that only
eight teams overall will qualify. When the NFL expands
to 32 teams, as Congress may force it to do, it should
put four divisions in each conference and eliminate the
wild-cards.
Because the NFL plays only 16 games in the regular
season, playoffs are more of a necessity than in other
sports. But since each team plays its division foes
twice a year, there can be no argument as to who the
true division champion is.
The NFL should also begin its season a week ear
lier, maybe eliminating a so-called "preseason game."
Playing the Pro Bowl in February is ridiculous.
The NBA and the NHL playoffs are simply a joke.

Last-place teams qualify. Teams with losing records
get hot and make the finals. Four teams advancing
would be ideal, but both leagues should cut back to
eight — the top two teams in each division.
The NHL, with 21 teams, should also go to a three
division setup, with seven teams in each and only one
wild-card. Traditional rivalries like Toronto-Montreal
should also be preserved.
The NBA might also look to cut back its 82-game
regular season. Many players admit to dogging it
during regular-season games that are meaningless,
made more so because all but the most inept teams
easily make the playoffs.
Gouging the fans
I was going to rip Toronto fans today for not filling
Exhibition Stadium for the first two playoff games
there, but then I heard the ticket prices being charged.
Box seats are $33 Canadian ($25 U.S.). The cheapest
seats are $20 Canadian ($l5 U.S.). Thank the league
offices for those ripoffs. They deserve the empty
seats.
Improving the NFL
While telling the pro leagues how to run their
playoffs, how about telling the NFL how to improve its
game?
First, put in the two-point conversion. There may be
no more exciting play in football than a two-pointer at
the end of a one-point game. The option would also
decide a lot of games without overtime.
Second, allow a receiver to make a legal catch with
only one foot inbounds. There is no reason for the cur
rent rule.
Third, don't end overtime until a team scores six
points or the period ends. Enough of these game
winning field goals before the other team touches the
ball. If the receiving team scores a touchdown, fine. If
it kicks two field goals, fine. But somehow stop
coaches from trying to get inside the 30 and kicking to
win right away.
The Mailbag
Major emptiness. Sure, the opinions expressed in
this space are pretty persuasive, but if you still don't
agree, let people know. Any letters that do not ques
tion my family heritage or sexual tendencies will be
printed here every Thursday. Offended linemen over
6-foot-2 and 230 pounds need not appear in person,
thank you.
The prediction
Lots of points. Hopefully, the intensity that has
manifested itself in practice will carry over to Saturday.
If pot moct of those poinN will on thp Rruin side.
