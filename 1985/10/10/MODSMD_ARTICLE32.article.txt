# Coliseum board of directos says no
## Giants Shut Out in Oakland 
### 
OAKLAND (AP) — The San Francisco Giants
struck out yesterday in their bid to share the Oak
land Coliseum with the A's as the Coliseum's board
of directors rejected the proposed move.
The rejection left Giants' owner Bob Lurie with a
decision about whether to stay at Candlestick Park,
attempt to move to another city or sell the club. He
has said the club will no longer play in Candlestick
Park under his ownership.
The Coliseum's board announced at a news con
ference that they won't agree to the Giants' pro
posal to move into the A's ballpark for several years
until a downtown stadium is built in San Francisco.
Coliseum President George Vukasin said the
board's decision was unanimous and called it "a
simple business decision" that was final.
"It's regrettable that the board has taken its ac
tion without having given the Giants an opportunity
to present their proposed solutions to some of the
problems the board feels would be caused by the
Giants playing at the Coliseum," said Giants spokes
man Duffy Jennings.
Giants owner Bob Lurie was in Arizona for the
club's annual organizational meetings and was un
available for immediate comment.
Lurie met with the A's on Tuesday in an effort to

get them to support the move, but came away dis
appointed, saying, "It was clear to me that the A's
may not support this proposal at all."
A's President Roy Eisenhardt said he would make
his decision by tomorrow about whether he is willing
to waive the A's exclusive right to the Coliseum to
allow the Giants to play there next season. But Jen
nings said that decision is now mute, since the
Coliseum board said their own decision would not be
affected by the A's response to Lurie.
Lurie said he was "disappointed that we could not
obtain the A's consent at this time to our request to
share the Coliseum with them on an interim basis. It
is my hope that when we do hear from them, it will
not be too late to see this project succeed."
Lurie and San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein
held a news conference last week proposing the
Giants' temporary move to Oakland until a new
stadium is built in downtown San Francisco. There
is currently no approved plan or funding for such a
stadium, nor any approved site.
The proposed move was immediately blasted by
Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson, who said it could hurt
the A's chances for success and the city's attempt to
get back the Los Angeles Raiders or bring in an
other National Football League team.
