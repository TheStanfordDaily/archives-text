$300 Million Voted to Afghans
WASHINGTON — Congress has secretly approved another $300
million in military aid for anti-Soviet rebels in Afghanistan over the
next two years, according to sources in the intelligence community.
The funding, voted late last month after several weeks of heated
debate in the House and Senate intelligence committees, is in addi
tion to secret funds already appropriated for fiscal 1986 and 1987. It
is expected to be used primarily for ammunition and small weapons,
but part of it may also be spent for a new ground-based anti-aircraft
missile system to battle Soviet helicopters.
The new funding is a major jump from the reported fiscal 1985
total of about $250 million, which at the time was reported to make
up the bulk of the Central Intelligence Agency's fund for covert
operations worldwide.
The additional spending has sparked concern among Democrats in
both the House and Senate intelligence committees over the scope
and direction of the Afghanistan program, the sources said.
"People are seeing the potential of a $1 billion-a-year program
pretty soon. For the first time there's a realization of that, and there
are a lot of questions about just what are the policy implications and
what are we getting out of this," one highly placed source said.
Congress has been uncommonly unified in backing the Afghanistan
guerrilla resistance to Soviet occupation forces, who poured into Af
ghanistan in 1979 in what they said was a response to a request from
the Marxist government of President Babrak Karmal. Casualties
have been heavy on both sides, and the current funding request was
justified on grounds that the rebels need to be confident of stable
supplies over the next two years.
Although several members of the House intelligence committee
argued that the new funding should be delayed until the mushroom
ing program could be evaluated, the Administration pushed to obtain
approval before the fiscal year ended Sept. 30 and the funds reverted
to the Treasury.
The procedure avoided the need for approval by the full Congress
because it had already appropriated the funds for national security
purposes, the sources said. But the high-pressure approach raised
some lawmakers' hackles and led to questions about the sudden dis
covery of so much unspent money at a time of rising congressional
interest in cutting defense spending.
Death Toll Rises in Puerto Rico
PONCE, Puerto Rico — Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon joined
hundreds of mourners ip the city coliseum yesterday for a mass fu
neral of many of the 68 known victims of this week's floods and
mudslides. An official said as many as 500 more are feared dead.
Sobbing and wailing relatives and friends filed past the caskets of
23 of the 25 bodies pulled from the mud and debris of the nearby
Mameyes shantytown, where a Monday morning landslide triggered
by a tropical deluge destroyed 400 homes.
Hernandez Colon said, "This is the worst tragedy ever to hit our
island in its history. It fills me with pain, as governor and as a Ponce
native."
Rescue teams working around the clock reported finding three
more bodies under the Mameyes mud Tuesday night, bringing the
unofficial count there to 28.
The National Weather Service said that from Sunday evening to
Monday morning, 10 to 15 inches of rain fell as a tropical front moved
across the island. The front subsequently developed into tropical
storm Isabel.
S. Africans Hold 'Prayaway'
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Tens of thousands of South
Africans of all races attended prayer services yesterday to "repent
for the national sin of apartheid," while blacks around the country
stayed home from work in droves.
After telephoned bomb threats, Anglican Bishop Desmond Tutu
and about 100 other worshipers abandoned their prayers briefly in a
downtown Johannesburg cathedral, one of hundreds of church
services conducted across the country.
Witnesses reported black youths attacked some workers as they
returned home to black townships, although organizers said they
were not seeking a general strike.
Townships that have been caught up in 14 months of bloody rioting
that left more than 750 people dead appeared relatively calm during
the nationwide display of support for peaceful change in the national
system of institutionalized racial separation.
The "prayaway" was arranged last month by about 400 church
leaders from 48 Christian denominations who launched a National Ini
tiative for Reconciliation. Tutu, the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize winner,
initially asked the group to endorse a week-long boycott of work to
press for race reforms, but the church group decided instead on a
single day of prayer.
Employers generally gave workers time off during the day to pray,
or allowed employees to leave early to attend the church services.
Premier Rips Protectionism
WASHINGTON — Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew
strode int6 the lion's den of the U.S. Congress yesterday to deliver
an impassioned attack against protectionist legislation, which he said
would set off "a downward spiral in the world economy" and increase
political turmoil in developing nations.
He received polite applause from legislators who have made
America's soaring trade deficit a major focus of activity during the
past month. House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill immediately
postponed consideration until today of a bill to sharply lower textile
imports. The measure would particularly affect fast-growing Pacific
rim nations such as Singapore.
In his speech to a joint session of Congress, Lee painted a bleak
future for the world if the United States uses protectionism in an ef
fort to solve its problems of factory shutdowns and surging un
employment in manufacturing industries.
His speech was the centerpiece of Lee's four-day trip to Washing
ton, and marked the first time a head of government has devoted an
entire address to a joint session of Congress to the trade issue.
Lee credited American support of free trade since the end of
World War II with enabling nations along the Pacific rim to prosper
and provide a counterweight to the socialist model of development
prevalent in much of the Third World.
Lee said if the United States closes its market, China will be
forced to slow its modernization to the point where "she will become
restive;" Japan will be pushed into closer ties with either the Soviet
Union or China, and the shift of developing countries toward
democracy and free enterprise will end.
"Is America willing to write off the peaceful and constructive
developments of the last 30 years that she had made possible?"
asked Lee. 62, who is his country's first prime minister.
