# One American hostage killed
## Palestinians Give Up the Ship 
### 
PORT SAID, Egypt â€” Four Palestinian
hijackers who held 511 hostages aboard an Ital
ian luxury cruise liner surrendered yesterday
and were promised safe passage out of Egypt, as
the Italian prime minister and the ship's captain
announced that an elderly American tourist had
been killed and thrown overboard.
Italian Prime Minister Bettino Craxi was the
first to disclose that passenger Leon Klinghoffer,
69, of New York, had died during the 44-hour
crisis on the liner Achille Lauro. Klinghoffer,
confined to a wheelchair by a stroke, had been
traveling with his wife, Marilyn, 58.
The Egyptian Foreign Ministry had negotiated
the hijackers' surrender in cooperation with Ital
ian authorities and two representatives of the
Palestine Liberation Organization dispatched
here by PLO chairman Yasser Arafat.
"The problem of the vessel has been solved,"
Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel Maguid an
nounced. "The four hijackers have left the ship
and are heading out of Egypt."
The foreign minister said that the hijackers
had made no demands except safe passage out of
Egypt. He would not say where they would go.
Egyptian security officials said early today that
the Palestinians, whose number was originally
put at between seven and 12, were in custody
here.
But, in Washington, White House spokesman
Larry Speakes said, "We do not know where
thev are."

Late yesterday, the ship's captain, Gerardo de
Rosa, said in a radio conversation with state-run
Italian television that a terrorist who had blood
on his clothing admitted to the murder. The cap
tain spoke from the ship, which was still
anchored 15 miles outside Port Said, where the
hijackers surrendered to Egyptian police. The
captain was preparing to sail for the Israeli port
of Ashdod.

During the hijacking, the most ambitious act of
piracy in a quarter century, the Palestinians
forced the 23,269-ton cruise liner to sail an er
ratic course around the Mediterranean Sea.
Seized Monday, soon after it left the port of
Alexandria, Egypt, bound for Port Said, the ship
first was diverted to Tartus, where the Syrian
government denied it permission to land, then
veered toward Cyprus and returned to Egyp
tian waters early yesterday.
The captain also disclosed how the four
pirates gained control of the ship. He said that at
1:30 p.m. Monday, when the ship was off the
Egyptian coast, they had fired Soviet-made sub
machine guns and brandished hand grenades.
One terrorist came onto the bridge, "fired
some shots in the ground and screamed in Arabic
and told me to head to Tartus," De Rosa said.
The other terrorists herded the passengers onto
a lower deck, he said.
"I was continually guarded on the bridge with
a submachine gun," the captain continued.
He said that the terrorists, who had demanded
the release of 50 Palestinian prisoners held in Is
rael as well as freedom for other Palestinians im
prisoned elsewhere, had hoped to find asylum in
Syria. When Syrian authorities, under pressure
from the United States and other Western
countries, refused Tuesday to let the ship enter
its waters, the hijackers told the captain to head
toward Libya, he said.
