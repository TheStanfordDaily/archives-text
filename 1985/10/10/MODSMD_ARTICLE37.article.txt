# Senate Votes for Balanced Budget
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Senate
yesterday overwhelmingly ap
proved sweeping legislation that
would ostensibly balance the
budget by 1991 while, in a related
move, the Treasury Department
arranged for emergency borrowing
that will prevent government
checks from bouncing this week.
The Senate voted 75-24 for the
controversial budget-balancing
plan, attaching it to a bill that would
extend the government's borrow
ing authority for about a year. But
House Democratic leaders, arguing
that the Treasury action ended the
debt ceiling crisis at least temporar
ily, maneuvered to derail or sub

stantially modify the balanced
budget plan.
Earlier, in a deal struck between
Senate Republican and Democratic
leaders at 3 a.m. yesterday, the
Democrats dropped a weeklong
filibuster on the bill in exchange for
Republicans' agreeing not to push
the House to take immediate action
on it. Instead, the Senate leaders
— unaware of Treasury's impend
ing action and believing that gov
ernment checks would bounce if
Congress did not at least pass a
short-term borrowing bill — ar
ranged for approval of a measure
that would run until Oct. 18.
Hours later, after the Treasury

action, House Democratic leaders
refused to take up the Senate's
stopgap bill, claiming that there was
no longer any crisis.
Senate Republicans, backed by
President Reagan, had sought to
force quick congressional approval
of their balanced-budget proposal
by attaching it as an amendment to
"must" legislation extending the
government's borrowing authority
for about a year.
But Democrats used stalling tac
tics, protesting that the plan to
wipe out huge deficits by 1991
would give the president unprece
dented powers, including the ability
to cut social programs far more

than defense.
As the stalemate ground on, the
Treasury Department warned that
it would be unable to meet payrolls
and pay bills unless the ceiling on
federal debt was raised by yester
day.
The Senate expected to finish ac
tion on its long-term debt bill
Thursday and send it to a confer
ence committee with the House,
which has passed a long-term bill
without any amendments. Over the
next week or two, the conference
committee can be expected to
erupt in bitter fighting over
whether to retain the Senate's
balanced-budget rider.
