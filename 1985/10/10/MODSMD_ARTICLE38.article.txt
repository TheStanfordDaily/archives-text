F-18 Flaws Found
The Navy has discovered that its new $18.7
million F-18 jet fighter has a serious design
flaw that could cause airframe failures after as
little as one-third of the aircraft's intended life.
Top Navy officials were told of the problem
in recent weeks after aircraft tests appeared to
show that the defect could ultimately cause the
aircraft's wings to fall off, Navy officials con
firmed Tuesday.
"The cause of it is an inadequate design,"
said Capt. George Strohsahl, the Navy's F-18
program manager, in a telephone interview
late Tuesday.
Strohsahl said bulkheads in future aircraft
can be strengthened simply by adding several
more pounds of metal. But the repair of exist
ing aircraft is expected to be more compli
cated.
Direct responsibility for the problem rests
with McDonnell Douglas, the prime contractor
of the aircraft, Strohsahl said.
Murdoch Plans TV
LOS ANGELES — Publisher and entertain
ment magnate Rupert Murdoch yesterday an

nounced a sweeping reorganization of his tele
vision and film studio holdings, including the
formation of a new television network.
There has been widespead speculation for
months that Australian-born Murdoch, now an
American citizen based in New York, was
seeking to build a new network to compete
with the three majors.
At mid-year, Murdoch confirmed that he
was considering trying to form his own net
work. At the time, he indicated his strategy
would be to pursue younger, more affluent and
more sophisticated viewers.
In May, he agreed to pay $1.55 billion to buy
six TV stations from Metromedia Inc., and last
month he purchased the second half of 20th
Century Fox Film Corp. from Denver oilman
Marvin Davis for $325 million. Murdoch bought
the first half of Fox from Davis six months ear
lier for $250 million.
Ownership of Fox as well as TV stations
would give Murdoch control of production as
well as air time.
SEC Charges Broker
NEW YORK — In what appears to be the
biggest such case on record, the Securities

and Exchange Commission charged the
brokerage firm of Kidder, Peabody & Co. yes
terday with illegally using $145 million of its
customers' money to back the company's own
investments.
Kidder, Peabody is the nation's 15th-largest
securities company with more than $307 mil
lion in capital.
Charged with aiding and abetting the
scheme, which allegedly took place between
March 1 and April 13, 1984, was Gerard Miller,
the company's director of operations. The
company and Miller face maximum penalties of
suspension or revocation of their licenses.
The administrative complaint filed by the
SEC's regional office here said that Kidder vio
lated one of the primary rules governing a
brokerage's handling of clients' funds, the re
quirement that the money be kept thoroughly
segregated from the company's capital.
