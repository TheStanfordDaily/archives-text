Hedgecock Convicted
SAN DIEGO — San Diego Mayor Roger
Hedgecock was convicted yesterday of con
spiring to accept illegal campaign donations in
his 1983 mayoral race and of falsifying financial
disclosure statements to conceal the scheme.
The conviction will force Hedgecock to
resign as mayor of California's second largest
city on Nov. 6, according to City Attorney
John Witt. The mayor was released on his own
recognizance after the verdicts, returned yes
terday after six-and-one-half days of delibera
tions by the jury. Hedgecock was convicted on
13 of 16 counts.
Hedgecock was convicted of conspiring with
three of his closest backers to funnel tens of
thousands of dollars in illegal contributions to

his 1983 campaign through a political consult
ing company owned by a close friend.
Each of Hedgecock's perjury convictions
carries a maximum penalty of four years in
prison, but with multiple counts the maximum
sentence is eight years, according to
prosecutors.
Saying that he needed time to "regroup my
thoughts," Hedgecock promised to make "a
more extensive statement on a lot of very ob
vious questions in a day or two."
Duke Blasts Bradley
SAN FRANCISCO — Gov. George Deuk
mejian said yesterday that Los Angeles Mayor
Tom Bradley "misstates the facts" and

"completely falsifies information" when the
two political foes communicate.
The Republican governor, accusing Demo
crat Bradley of failing to cooperate in putting a
state prison in Los Angeles, said he had not
asked Bradley for help in winning legislative
approval for the proposed prison because he
says the mayor distorts Deukmejian's letters.
"He (Bradley) sends me letters in which he
misstates the facts, and then when I write
back and tell him the facts, he then goes public
and completely falsifies information," Deuk
mejian said. "And so, I have not called him in
view of that kind of behavior. I don't think
there's much point in my asking."
Bradley, who narrowly lost to Deukmejian
in 1982, is unopposed at this time in his bid for
a rematch against Deukmejian next year.
