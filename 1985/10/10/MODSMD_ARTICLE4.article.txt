# Activists Laud Motorola's Sale

### JULIE RYAN 
Motorola Inc.'s sale of its South
African subsidiary to a South
African firm is being called a huge
victory by some campus divest
ment leaders who say the
withdrawal of the U.S. corporation
is the successful culmination of a
campus campaign to focus public at
tention on Motorola.
Stanford students passed a refer
endum last fall calling on the Uni
versity to divest of its stock in
Motorola and the Board of Trustees
voted in February to divest of
Motorola stock if the company con
tinued its strongly criticized sales of
radio equipment to the South
African police and military.
"It's great," said Jon Adelstein, a
former ASSU senator who co
authored the referendum calling on
the University to develop a more
responsible investment policy and
divest immediately of its stock in
Motorola.
"Motorola was worried about bad
publicity, and their main bad
publicity came from Stanford. This
shows that our strategy last year
was very successful and shows that
Kennedy's resistance to divest
ment is not well founded,"
Adelstein said.
University President Donald
Kennedy could not be reached for
comment yesterday on Motorola's
action.
Mark Landesmann, the other
ASSU senator who co-authored the
student referendum, called
Motorola the most significant of the
approximately 25 U.S. companies
that have pulled out of South Africa
this year.
"I've been celebrating all day,"
said Landesmann, who was also a
member of the Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (C-IR) last
year. "Motorola was a leader
among companies that resisted
public pressure with respect to
their business in South Africa, and
now they are a leader among com
panies who must deal with public
pressure."
A group of students picked
Motorola as a target last year after
deciding that concentrating their ef
forts on one company would pro
vide the best chance of altering that
company's behavior and bringing
about its eventual withdrawal from
South Africa.
Landesmann said the national
press coverage that followed the
student referendum and the Board
of Trustees' conditional divestment
of Motorola linked that company to
apartheid in the public's mind.
"The public pressure both from
Stanford and other activities scat
tered across the country made the
costs of staying in South Africa too
high for Motorola," Landesmann
said. "But obviously they won't ad
mit that that's why they pulled out

of South Africa; that's one of the
rules of the game."
Political Science Prof. Richard
Brody, chairman of C-IR, said he is
not sure whether the sale of the
Motorola subsidiary to a South
African company is a positive devel
opment.
"If one's desire is to get U.S.
firms out of South Africa, then it's
progress, but if one is concerned
about the employees of the firm,
it's hard to know whether it will be
a good or bad thing," he said.
Brody said he is concerned that it
will now be harder to influence the
company's practices, a problem
voiced by many people who oppose
divestment as a means to end
apartheid.
"Motorola had said that it would
be moving toward a Sullivan 1 or 2
rating this year," Brody said, refer
ring to a rating based on the Sul
livan Principles, a code of conduct
for foreign-based employers in
South Africa.
Companies receiving a rating of 1
are termed to be making good prog
ress in implementing the principles,
while employers receiving a 2
rating are simply said to be simply
making progress. Last year,
Motorola had a 3-A rating, which
means it passed the basic require
ments on three of the six points of
the Sullivan Principles.
Brody said he thinks the major
reason Motorola chose to sell its
South African subsidiary was the
threat of a boycott of its products
by New York City. New York City
has passed legislation stipulating
that it would boycott Motorola
products if the company continued
to sell to the South African military
or police.
"I personally think that divesting
of one's stock in a company is
resigning political power, whereas
boycott of products has proved to
be an effective tool. Motorola is a
case of that," Brody said.
The C-IR will continue to moni
tor Motorola to ensure that it
doesn't continue sales to the South
African police or military through
suppliers in South Africa, according
to Brody.
"We do worry about third-party
sales," he said. "We will continue
watching Motorola until we know
the arrangements of this sale and
who they are selling to. If it's a sub
terfuge, we'll try to find it out and
act accordingly."
According to the Los Angeles
Times, business observers think
the deal will enable Motorola to
remain in the South African market
as a supplier to the police and mili
tary, but without the high exposure
to criticism in the United States.
"It's in (Motorola's) interest to
disprove such a claim. In case they
do sell to military and police, they
will face even stronger public pres
