# Hum Bio Grads Find Major Success
## 
### C.R. DOUGLAS 
Some decisions are avoidable, and then
there's the major decision. One way to escape
this dilemma, the human biology major, is con
sistently popular for students "exploring" the
various campus departments.
A 1970 creation made possible by the Ford
Foundation, human biology has become a
respected major for those students who have in
terests in both biology and the social sciences.
University President Donald Kennedy, chair
man of the Human Biology Department from
1973 to 1977, was asked what type of student is
most attracted to this program.
"There are a variety of students who fall into
one of several categories for whom I think
human biology is especially appropriate. There
are those students who are interested in the
evolution of human behavior; those in the social,
economic and policy aspects of health care; and
students who find themselves interested in a va
riety of very tough, challenging social policy is
sues that have strong biological content, such as
health care on the one hand and environmental
quality on the other," said Kennedy.
Kennedy added, "Very often there are people
who find that they are just as interested in the in
stitutional framework of a problem as the prob
lem itself." These students, according to Ken

nedy, see the disease in the context of the entire
society in which it occurs — in its population
context as well as in the context of the system
for fixing it.
Audrey Bernfield, former director for career
planning in the Human Biology Department,
commented that the major gives students a
"wonderful background for everything. It really
meets one's expectations of what educated, in
volved people would do."
She cites a number of different careers that
human biology graduates have followed —
everything from law to advertising — to demon
strate her point.
The personal stories of three human biology
graduates who have gone on to pursue a variety
of interesting careers shows the flexibility of this
major.
Hum bio: on the road to Harvard
Nancy Rigotti, Class of '74, is currently a gen
eral internist at the Harvard Medical School as
well as an associate at the the Smoking Institue
in the Kennedy School of Government at Har
vard University.
In her work in both schools, Rigotti studies
the effect of physical health on human behavior
and vice-versa. She has just completed research
on the long-term effect anorexia-nervosa has on
a person's bone strength.

At the Smoking Institute, Rigotti works with a
wide variety of other social scientists research
ing the medical effects and the policy implications
of cigarette smoking.
"In a way it mirrors human biology, since it is
an eclectic group of social and natural scientists,"
said Rigotti. She said she believes stongly in the
nature of the interdisciplinary approach that the
human biology program offers.
"I thought it was a great experience. It intro
duced me to almost all of the social sciences. I
thought it was a good background training,"
commented Rigotti.
Although Rigotti knew from the start that she
wanted to enter medical school after graduation,
she does have advice for undergraduates who
don't plan to go in that direction, saying, "It is so
broad it gives you a base to do anything."
And it's perfectly legal
Linda Wandres, Class of 78, is the assistant
regional council with the Environmental Protec
tion Agency in San Francisco. Her main con
cerns are legal issues connected with toxic
waste facilities.
As a student in hum bio, Wandres was very in
terested in public policy and law. After graduat-
ing, she attended Hastings Law School and went to work for the General
Accounting Office in Washington, D.C.
In regard to her hum bio training for law school, Wandres commented, "I
think it could work equally well for someone who is planning to go to medi
cal school as well as someone who is planning to go to law school.
"It enables you to do whatever you want to do with it. There is a great
amount of support from within the program to achieve whatever goals you
had in mind," she recalled. "I have good feelings about the program.
You can bank on it
Linda Duntley, Class of '78, is currently a manager in the SWAPS unit of
Citicorp Investment Bank based in New York City. She was previously a
loan officer with Chase-Manhattan.
After graduating, Duntley joined the Peace Corps and traveled to the
Philippines to work on health care and community development, although
her emphasis was in leprosy control. After spending more time in the

Philippines with USAIL) (U.S. Agency for International Development), she
came back to the states and entered a masters program at the University
of Michigan, primarily studying economics and statistics.
When asked why she took human biology Duntley commented, "1 took it
because it offered interesting professors and interesting classes. I enjoyed
the people involved in the program."
Duntley emphasized the fact that human biology gave her fine training
that she was able to use when she attended graduate school.
"It helped develop skills in the policy region which I then went on to
develop further in graduate school," she recalled. "Even though I don't use
the biology skills, I do use the policy skills. Eventually I would like to get
back into something policy oriented."
"It is one of the few majors that an individual could develop into a major
corresponding to their interests," she said encouragingly. " I hat was one
of the things that really interested me."
It is fair to say that most majors can lead to a myriad of careers, but the
unique thing about human biology is that it incorporates quite a few disci
plines and, for that reason, may offer something more unique.
No one could be sure in the early 70s how hum bio was going to turn
out, but based on the comments of these and other graduates it is safe to
say that the major has been quite successful.
If you'd rather opt for a comprehensive tour of many of the subjects that
interest you, that major decision won't be so difficult.

In her work in both schools, Rigotti studies
the effect of physical health on human behavior
and vice-versa. She has just completed research
on the long-term effect anorexia-nervosa has on
a person's bone strength.

At the Smoking Institute, Rigotti works with a
wide variety of other social scientists research
ing the medical effects and the policy implications
of cigarette smoking.
"In a way it mirrors human biology, since it is
an eclectic group of social and natural scientists,"
said Rigotti. She said she believes stongly in the
nature of the interdisciplinary approach that the
human biology program offers.
"I thought it was a great experience. It intro
duced me to almost all of the social sciences. I
thought it was a good background training,"
commented Rigotti.
Although Rigotti knew from the start that she
wanted to enter medical school after graduation,
she does have advice for undergraduates who
don't plan to go in that direction, saying, "It is so

And it's perfectly legal
Linda Wandres, Class of 78, is the assistant
regional council with the Environmental Protec
tion Agency in San Francisco. Her main con
cerns are legal issues connected with toxic
waste facilities.
As a student in hum bio, Wandres was very in
terested in public policy and law. After graduat-
ing, she attended Hastings Law School and went to work for the General
Accounting Office in Washington, D.C.
In regard to her hum bio training for law school, Wandres commented, "I
think it could work equally well for someone who is planning to go to medi
cal school as well as someone who is planning to go to law school.
"It enables you to do whatever you want to do with it. There is a great
amount of support from within the program to achieve whatever goals you
had in mind," she recalled. "I have good feelings about the program.

Philippines with USAIL) (U.S. Agency for International Development), she
came back to the states and entered a masters program at the University
of Michigan, primarily studying economics and statistics.
When asked why she took human biology Duntley commented, "1 took it
because it offered interesting professors and interesting classes. I enjoyed
the people involved in the program."
Duntley emphasized the fact that human biology gave her fine training
that she was able to use when she attended graduate school.
"It helped develop skills in the policy region which I then went on to
develop further in graduate school," she recalled. "Even though I don't use
the biology skills, I do use the policy skills. Eventually I would like to get
back into something policy oriented."
"It is one of the few majors that an individual could develop into a major
corresponding to their interests," she said encouragingly. " I hat was one
of the things that really interested me."
It is fair to say that most majors can lead to a myriad of careers, but the
unique thing about human biology is that it incorporates quite a few disci
plines and, for that reason, may offer something more unique.
No one could be sure in the early 70s how hum bio was going to turn
out, but based on the comments of these and other graduates it is safe to
say that the major has been quite successful.
If you'd rather opt for a comprehensive tour of many of the subjects that
interest you, that major decision won't be so difficult.
Some decisions are avoidable, and then
there's the major decision. One way to escape
this dilemma, the human biology major, is con
sistently popular for students "exploring" the
various campus departments.
A 1970 creation made possible by the Ford
Foundation, human biology has become a
respected major for those students who have in
terests in both biology and the social sciences.
University President Donald Kennedy, chair
man of the Human Biology Department from
1973 to 1977, was asked what type of student is
most attracted to this program.
"There are a variety of students who fall into
one of several categories for whom I think
human biology is especially appropriate. There
are those students who are interested in the
evolution of human behavior; those in the social,
economic and policy aspects of health care; and
students who find themselves interested in a va
riety of very tough, challenging social policy is
sues that have strong biological content, such as
health care on the one hand and environmental
quality on the other," said Kennedy.
Kennedy added, "Very often there are people
who find that they are just as interested in the in
stitutional framework of a problem as the prob
lem itself." These students, according to Ken

nedy, see the disease in the context of the entire
society in which it occurs — in its population
context as well as in the context of the system
for fixing it.
Audrey Bernfield, former director for career
planning in the Human Biology Department,
commented that the major gives students a
"wonderful background for everything. It really
meets one's expectations of what educated, in
volved people would do."
She cites a number of different careers that
human biology graduates have followed —
everything from law to advertising — to demon
strate her point.
The personal stories of three human biology
graduates who have gone on to pursue a variety
of interesting careers shows the flexibility of this
major.
