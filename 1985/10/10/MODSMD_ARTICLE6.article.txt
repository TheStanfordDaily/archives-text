# Hum Bio Grads Find Major Success

### C.R. DOUGLAS 
Some decisions are avoidable, and then
there's the major decision. One way to escape
this dilemma, the human biology major, is con
sistently popular for students "exploring" the
various campus departments.
A 1970 creation made possible by the Ford
Foundation, human biology has become a
respected major for those students who have in
terests in both biology and the social sciences.
University President Donald Kennedy, chair
man of the Human Biology Department from
1973 to 1977, was asked what type of student is
most attracted to this program.
"There are a variety of students who fall into
one of several categories for whom I think
human biology is especially appropriate. There
are those students who are interested in the
evolution of human behavior; those in the social,
economic and policy aspects of health care; and
students who find themselves interested in a va
riety of very tough, challenging social policy is
sues that have strong biological content, such as
health care on the one hand and environmental
quality on the other," said Kennedy.
Kennedy added, "Very often there are people
who find that they are just as interested in the in
stitutional framework of a problem as the prob
lem itself." These students, according to Ken

nedy, see the disease in the context of the entire
society in which it occurs — in its population
context as well as in the context of the system
for fixing it.
Audrey Bernfield, former director for career
planning in the Human Biology Department,
commented that the major gives students a
"wonderful background for everything. It really
meets one's expectations of what educated, in
volved people would do."
She cites a number of different careers that
human biology graduates have followed —
everything from law to advertising — to demon
strate her point.
The personal stories of three human biology
graduates who have gone on to pursue a variety
of interesting careers shows the flexibility of this
major.
Hum bio: on the road to Harvard
Nancy Rigotti, Class of '74, is currently a gen
eral internist at the Harvard Medical School as
well as an associate at the the Smoking Institue
in the Kennedy School of Government at Har
vard University.
In her work in both schools, Rigotti studies
the effect of physical health on human behavior
and vice-versa. She has just completed research
on the long-term effect anorexia-nervosa has on
a person's bone strength.

At the Smoking Institute, Rigotti works with a
wide variety of other social scientists research
ing the medical effects and the policy implications
of cigarette smoking.
"In a way it mirrors human biology, since it is
an eclectic group of social and natural scientists,"
said Rigotti. She said she believes stongly in the
nature of the interdisciplinary approach that the
human biology program offers.
"I thought it was a great experience. It intro
duced me to almost all of the social sciences. I
thought it was a good background training,"
commented Rigotti.
Although Rigotti knew from the start that she
wanted to enter medical school after graduation,
she does have advice for undergraduates who
don't plan to go in that direction, saying, "It is so
broad it gives you a base to do anything."
And it's perfectly legal
Linda Wandres, Class of 78, is the assistant
regional council with the Environmental Protec
tion Agency in San Francisco. Her main con
cerns are legal issues connected with toxic
waste facilities.
As a student in hum bio, Wandres was very in
terested in public policy and law. After graduat-
