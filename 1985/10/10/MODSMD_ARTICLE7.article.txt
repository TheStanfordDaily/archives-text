# Stanford Not Alone in Labor Unrest

### MARSH T. McCALL Senior staff writer 
Stanford University is not the only major uni
versity where relations between campus labor
unions and the college administration have been
marred by mistrust and accusations of bad faith.
Yale University last fall suffered a 10-week
strike by both the clerical and maintenance divi
sions of the local Federation of University
Employees, with both the union and the adminis
tration citing complaints similar to those ex
pressed by University and labor representatives
at Stanford.
"There's a high degree of arrogance here,"
Yale alumnus John Wilhelm told The Daily yes
terday.
Wilhelm, business manager and chief
negotiator for Yale's service and maintenance
union, cited "lack of respect for union
employees" as a major cause of the strike.
"When there's a dispute, it's not about the is
sues," Wilhelm said. "We settle when they feel
like recognizing our existence and start treating
!us with some respect."
; Wilhelm claimed that the university had
â– rejected "without adequate explanation" a pro
posal that would have allowed a neutral ar
bitrator to review the negotiations, and also
quoted an independent report made by three
Yale law professors that concluded the univer
sity had not conducted itself in a manner "worthy

of the institution" during the strike.
However, Donald Stevens, director of em
ployee relations at Yale, minimized the effects of
the strike.
"It had little effect on education and re
search," Stevens said yesterday. "More than 50
percent of the employees donlt even belong to
the unions. Libraries stayed open, and research
continued. Life went on."
Although the strikers succeeded in eliciting
some student and faculty support, "it didn't
make a difference," Stevens added.
Wilhelm, in contrast, insisted that student sup
port during the strike was "extremely impor
tant," noting that the students gave moral en
couragement to the striking workers.
"They (the students) formed the point of view
that the union was trying harder to settle than
the university," Wilhelm said.
In the future, Yale will make efforts to "allow
employees to feel involved in the whole manage
ment process," said Stevens.
Oberlin .College in Ohio has succeeded where
both Stanford and Yale have failed: There has
not been a union strike in the history of the
school.
In the summer of last year, when the univer
sity's agreement with the union expired,
employees continued working without a new
contract for four months.
"Oberlin is a small community with a lot of
loyalty and camaraderie," Peter Baker, the
sophomore news editor of the Oberlin Review,

said yesterday. "That's a big difference between
Oberlin and Yale."
Baker added that a lower cost of living helped
keep union employees satisfied.
"Any time there's bargaining going on and
each side isn't getting exactly what they want,
there's some distrust," Oberlin's Director of
Personnel Bill Daily said yesterday. "But each
time we've been able to reach a compromise."
In response to remarks by Yale spokesmen
concerning the effectiveness of student activism,
Daily stated that "student support can make a
big difference. If students decide not to go to
class, for instance, that's got to make a differ
ence. They're paying the salaries."
Mark Kuestner, president of the Oberlin Col
lege Office and Professional Employees Union,
cites "good labor advice" as a source of the
union's unblemished relations with Oberlin.
"A strike option is always a last resort. But
usually unnecessary if one is advised of various
options. And the administration here doesn't just
slam the door," Kuestner said.
Dayton Livingston, vice president for busi
ness and finance at Oberlin, acknowledged yes
terday that while "intense bargaining" occurs
during contract negotiations, "we've tried to rec
ognize their (the union's) worth to the univer
sity."
Livingston also noted that union employees at
Oberlin enjoy a higher annual salary compensa
tion than employees at Yale.
