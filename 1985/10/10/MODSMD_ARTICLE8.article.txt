# USW Persists After 16 Years
## 
### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff 
The current dispute between the University and the
United Stanford Workers (USW) is only the latest sally
in a battle that has continued between the two parties
almost since the inception of a workers' union at the
University.
In 1969, a group of Stanford workers broke away
from the Stanford Employees' Association and formed
the United Stanford Employees (USE). Five years
later, the union affiliated itself, under the name of Local
680, with the Service Employees International Union
(SEIU), a branch of the AFL-CIO.
The 16 years that have elapsed since workers first
unionized themselves have seen two bitter and divisive
strikes erupt over contract negotiations.
In May 1974, USE went on strike after failing to
reach a substantive agreement with the University on
wage increase issues. The union had been negotiating
with the University for a 23 percent increase in wages,
an 8.3 percent cost of living increase, a higher pension
plan and added medical coverage for the first year. The
University was prepared to offer only a 7 percent wage
hike.
Striking workers used various methods to disrupt
University operations. At first they prevented any
supplies except blood and oxygen from getting into the
Medical Center.
Additionally, some picketing workers prevented any
deliveries from coming into the University, including
several cement trucks trying to get through to con
struction sites, until the University obtained restrain
ing orders preventing more than two picketers at a
time from being in any one area of the University.
The strike finally ended June 3, 1974, when the two
sides reached agreement on a 26.4 percent increase in
wages over a period of three years.
In 1980, the workers' union affiliated itself with
Local 715 of SEIU and changed its name to United
Stanford Workers (USW).
In September 1982, a Local 715 strike plunged the
University into chaos for an entire month.
The conflict stemmed from a marked disparity be
tween University and union offers on wage increases in

a three-year contract renewal proposal. The Univer
sity offered workers a 9.5 percent wage increase the
first year and a 7.5 to 10 percent increase the second
and third years, while the union asked for an 11.5 per
cent increase the first year and a 12.6 percent increase
the second year.
Michael Baratz, then the executive secretary of
USW, said at the time that the University's strategy
was clearly to offer higher raises to non-union
employees than to unionized workers.
"We are asking to be treated at least as fair as other
Stanford employees. Bargaining involves movement on
both sides. That is not part of the University's manage
ment style. They have decided to force us on strike
and then break our union, just like the famous union
buster J. P. Stevens," Baratz said.
"Stanford is often thought of as a 'rich' university,"
was the 1982 response of Priscilla Wheeler, head of the
University's negotiating team. "It does indeed have a
larger endowment than most schools — but as a
charitable trust, it must exercise fiscal responsibility to
keep that endowment intact and maintain a balanced
budget. Exact (wage) comparability is neither fair nor
reasonable."
The second strike witnessed much of the same ten
sions and hostilities of the first. Vandalism was ram
pant. Tires were slashed on delivery vehicles in Bonair
Siding. Scuffles occurred on the picket lines. Picketers
delayed a CBS camera truck trying to get into the foot
ball stadium to cover a game. Picketers were arrested
on charges of harrassing students and damaging
vehicles.
The strike continued for 30 days until negotiators fi
nally concluded an agreement that differed little from
the University's original proposal. The end of the
strike was marked by dissatisfaction among the union's
members.
The most recent conflict between the worker's
union and the University follows a disputatious year in
which the union fought to have its re-affiliation from
Local 715 to Local 680 recognized by the University.
The University challenged the legality of the April 1984
election in which workers voted for the re-affiliation.
That conflict ended with a compromise in which a re
vote was held. The workers voted once again for the
re-affiliation.

buster J. P. Stevens," Baratz said.
"Stanford is often thought of as a 'rich' university,"
was the 1982 response of Priscilla Wheeler, head of the
University's negotiating team. "It does indeed have a
larger endowment than most schools — but as a
charitable trust, it must exercise fiscal responsibility to
keep that endowment intact and maintain a balanced
budget. Exact (wage) comparability is neither fair nor
reasonable."
The second strike witnessed much of the same ten
sions and hostilities of the first. Vandalism was ram
pant. Tires were slashed on delivery vehicles in Bonair
Siding. Scuffles occurred on the picket lines. Picketers
delayed a CBS camera truck trying to get into the foot
ball stadium to cover a game. Picketers were arrested
on charges of harrassing students and damaging
vehicles.
The strike continued for 30 days until negotiators fi
nally concluded an agreement that differed little from
the University's original proposal. The end of the
strike was marked by dissatisfaction among the union's
members.
The most recent conflict between the worker's
union and the University follows a disputatious year in
which the union fought to have its re-affiliation from
Local 715 to Local 680 recognized by the University.
The University challenged the legality of the April 1984
election in which workers voted for the re-affiliation.
That conflict ended with a compromise in which a re
vote was held. The workers voted once again for the
re-affiliation.
