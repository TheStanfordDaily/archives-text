terproposals to USW's plan. No
specific wage offers are included.

negotiations go on.
• Sept. 5 — After seven bargain
ing sessions with little progress,
the University proposes federal
mediation.
• Sept. 9 — USW rejects the Uni

worthwhile. The union cites the
fact that the University has not
made a wage offer.
