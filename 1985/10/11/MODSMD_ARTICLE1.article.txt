Amid stagnating contract negotiations with
the University, about 75 members of United
Stanford Workers (USW) rallied at noon yes
terday outside University President Donald
Kennedy's office, threatening a campus-wide
labor slowdown.
"Some of the crews are not going back to
work," USW Chief Steward Linda Crouse
told the workers, some of whom were
bearing placards with such slogans as, "Labor
rights held hostage at Stanford," "Not on
strike but Stanford lies" and "Divest our pen
sion from South African henchmen."
Although most workers returned to work,
some union members loitered after the rally
and were planning not to return to work until
today, according to Crouse.
"Kennedy must know that we are serious
about job security," Crouse said.
"Right now, we're just gearing up for
Tuesday," said Dennis Blake, president of
USW, referring to a strike vote scheduled for
that day.
After Oct. 15, Blake said he expects to see
"more and more workers displaying their un

happiness by various shop-floor actions
available to them."
Blake highlighted work slowdowns, calling
in sick, absences from work and "ongoing dis
cussion with supervisors" as specific means
to put pressure on the University.
However, Priscilla Wheeler, the Univer
sity's chief negotiator in the contract dispute,
emphasized last night that work slowdowns
and other "selective work stoppages" are not
options open to union employees.
She said that partial strikes by employees
are not protected by the National Labor Rela
tions Act, and that the USW was "putting in
dividual workers at risk" of being disciplined if
they should choose to strike in individual
groups instead of as a unit.
Wheeler explained that "progressive" dis
ciplinary measures may be taken against indi
vidual workers who decide to disrupt the
workplace. These measures range from
docking pay, to suspension and termination,
she said.
Individual workers' cases will be looked at
closely before any disciplinary actions are
taken, according to Wheeler. "We're not
going to make a blanket case," she said.
According to Jim Keeton, manager of Uni-


Janelle Page/Daily
University workers line the Inner Quad yesterday during a rally in support of USW.
