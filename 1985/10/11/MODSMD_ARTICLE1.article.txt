# USW Plans Slowdown
## 
### FRANK LESTER TODD RAMMING Editorial staff 
Amid stagnating contract negotiations with
the University, about 75 members of United
Stanford Workers (USW) rallied at noon yes
terday outside University President Donald
Kennedy's office, threatening a campus-wide
labor slowdown.
"Some of the crews are not going back to
work," USW Chief Steward Linda Crouse
told the workers, some of whom were
bearing placards with such slogans as, "Labor
rights held hostage at Stanford," "Not on
strike but Stanford lies" and "Divest our pen
sion from South African henchmen."
Although most workers returned to work,
some union members loitered after the rally
and were planning not to return to work until
today, according to Crouse.
"Kennedy must know that we are serious
about job security," Crouse said.
"Right now, we're just gearing up for
Tuesday," said Dennis Blake, president of
USW, referring to a strike vote scheduled for
that day.
After Oct. 15, Blake said he expects to see
"more and more workers displaying their un

happiness by various shop-floor actions
available to them."
Blake highlighted work slowdowns, calling
in sick, absences from work and "ongoing dis
cussion with supervisors" as specific means
to put pressure on the University.
However, Priscilla Wheeler, the Univer
sity's chief negotiator in the contract dispute,
emphasized last night that work slowdowns
and other "selective work stoppages" are not
options open to union employees.
She said that partial strikes by employees
are not protected by the National Labor Rela
tions Act, and that the USW was "putting in
dividual workers at risk" of being disciplined if
they should choose to strike in individual
groups instead of as a unit.
Wheeler explained that "progressive" dis
ciplinary measures may be taken against indi
vidual workers who decide to disrupt the
workplace. These measures range from
docking pay, to suspension and termination,
she said.
Individual workers' cases will be looked at
closely before any disciplinary actions are
taken, according to Wheeler. "We're not
going to make a blanket case," she said.

versity Food Services, four food
service employees requested
permission to go to the rally.
Keeton said he had heard rumors
of a "wildcat walkout" but later dis
covered "only one (food service
hall) where there had been any dis
cussion of it at all."
Two workers at Tresidder Union
called in sick today, according to
Paul Szczesiul, assistant director
for Tresidder Union.
"Stanford frequently bluffs until
the last day," Blake said. "We're
going to be slowly turning up the
heat."
"No 94, we're out the door,"
chanted the workers at the rally, in
reference to Paragraph 94 of the
old union contract, which expired
Aug. 31.
Paragraph 94 of the old contract
prevented the University from
hiring temporary workers "to the
extent that it directly results in a
worker's layoff or removal to a

lower classification."
The University wants to replace
Paragraph 94 with language which
allows more flexibility in the con
tracting of temporary workers.
The union also fears a proposal
by the University which would
prevent union representatives from
exploring and discussing on-the-job
problems during working hours.
Workers would have to contact
their representatives after work,
according to Crouse. Such a step
would make the complaint process
so impractical as to "effectively
eliminate union representation,"
Crouse said.
Wheeler said the union's allega
tions that union representation will
be eradicated by the University's
proposal are unsubstantiated.
Additional union demands include
dependent coverage in medical
plans, increases in pension pay
ments and divestment of the pen
sion fund from firms with
operations in South Africa.
Blake said a strike now would be
more powerful because the partici
pation of other unions may add

strength to a USW strike.
At the rally, representatives
from the Communication Workers'
Association, which services Uni
versity telephone systems, the
AFL-CIO and the Teamsters' local
all expressed their intent to support
Local 680 in the event of a strike.
Blake said the workers are in a
better bargaining situation than
during the strike of 1982, which
some union members regard as a
failure.
While Stanford workers were
divided into two unions in 1982,
they have been united under Local
680 since 1983.
In addition, "we (the union) have
done a much better job making
communications with other uni
ons," Blake said. "There are cer
tain rules required for other unions
to respect picket lines."
The Teamsters Union, which
represents United Parcel Service
drivers and other trucking delivery
services, would not deliver to
campus if USW were on strike, ac
cording to Blake.

closely before any disciplinary actions are
taken, according to Wheeler. "We're not
going to make a blanket case," she said.
According to Jim Keeton, manager of Uni-


Janelle Page/Daily
University workers line the Inner Quad yesterday during a rally in support of USW.
versity Food Services, four food
service employees requested
permission to go to the rally.
Keeton said he had heard rumors
of a "wildcat walkout" but later dis
covered "only one (food service
hall) where there had been any dis
cussion of it at all."
Two workers at Tresidder Union
called in sick today, according to
Paul Szczesiul, assistant director
for Tresidder Union.
"Stanford frequently bluffs until
the last day," Blake said. "We're
going to be slowly turning up the
heat."
"No 94, we're out the door,"
chanted the workers at the rally, in
reference to Paragraph 94 of the
old union contract, which expired
Aug. 31.
Paragraph 94 of the old contract
prevented the University from
hiring temporary workers "to the
extent that it directly results in a
worker's layoff or removal to a

lower classification."
The University wants to replace
Paragraph 94 with language which
allows more flexibility in the con
tracting of temporary workers.
The union also fears a proposal
by the University which would
prevent union representatives from
exploring and discussing on-the-job
problems during working hours.
Workers would have to contact
their representatives after work,
according to Crouse. Such a step
would make the complaint process
so impractical as to "effectively
eliminate union representation,"
Crouse said.
Wheeler said the union's allega
tions that union representation will
be eradicated by the University's
proposal are unsubstantiated.
Additional union demands include
dependent coverage in medical
plans, increases in pension pay
ments and divestment of the pen
sion fund from firms with
operations in South Africa.
Blake said a strike now would be
more powerful because the partici
pation of other unions may add

strength to a USW strike.
At the rally, representatives
from the Communication Workers'
Association, which services Uni
versity telephone systems, the
AFL-CIO and the Teamsters' local
all expressed their intent to support
Local 680 in the event of a strike.
Blake said the workers are in a
better bargaining situation than
during the strike of 1982, which
some union members regard as a
failure.
While Stanford workers were
divided into two unions in 1982,
they have been united under Local
680 since 1983.
In addition, "we (the union) have
done a much better job making
communications with other uni
ons," Blake said. "There are cer
tain rules required for other unions
to respect picket lines."
The Teamsters Union, which
represents United Parcel Service
drivers and other trucking delivery
services, would not deliver to
campus if USW were on strike, ac
cording to Blake.
Amid stagnating contract negotiations with
the University, about 75 members of United
Stanford Workers (USW) rallied at noon yes
terday outside University President Donald
Kennedy's office, threatening a campus-wide
labor slowdown.
"Some of the crews are not going back to
work," USW Chief Steward Linda Crouse
told the workers, some of whom were
bearing placards with such slogans as, "Labor
rights held hostage at Stanford," "Not on
strike but Stanford lies" and "Divest our pen
sion from South African henchmen."
Although most workers returned to work,
some union members loitered after the rally
and were planning not to return to work until
today, according to Crouse.
"Kennedy must know that we are serious
about job security," Crouse said.
"Right now, we're just gearing up for
Tuesday," said Dennis Blake, president of
USW, referring to a strike vote scheduled for
that day.
After Oct. 15, Blake said he expects to see
"more and more workers displaying their un

happiness by various shop-floor actions
available to them."
Blake highlighted work slowdowns, calling
in sick, absences from work and "ongoing dis
cussion with supervisors" as specific means
to put pressure on the University.
However, Priscilla Wheeler, the Univer
sity's chief negotiator in the contract dispute,
emphasized last night that work slowdowns
and other "selective work stoppages" are not
options open to union employees.
She said that partial strikes by employees
are not protected by the National Labor Rela
tions Act, and that the USW was "putting in
dividual workers at risk" of being disciplined if
they should choose to strike in individual
groups instead of as a unit.
Wheeler explained that "progressive" dis
ciplinary measures may be taken against indi
vidual workers who decide to disrupt the
workplace. These measures range from
docking pay, to suspension and termination,
she said.
Individual workers' cases will be looked at
closely before any disciplinary actions are
taken, according to Wheeler. "We're not
going to make a blanket case," she said.
