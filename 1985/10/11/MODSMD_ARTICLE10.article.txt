# Nicaraguans Under U.S. Seige
## 
### 
The United States is bent on making the same
tragic mistakes that it made in Cuba and Viet
nam. By supporting the contras we are involved
in an immoral and dirty war with Nicaragua. We
are heading down a dark path filled with the per
vasive stench of human blood and suffering.
At stake here is not Marxism versus
democracy, or capitalism versus socialism. What
is at stake is basic human decency, respect for
human life and respect for people's right to seek
their own form of government. These are rights
upon which this nation was founded, and which
we have no right to deny other peoples of the
world.
A brief history: In 1933, after 21 years of
armed occupation, the United States pulled out
of Nicaragua. They left behind a U.S.-trained
National Guard in the hands of Anastazio Samoza

Garcia. This evolved into an elitist dictatorial
system that proceeded to plunder and degrade
the Nicaraguan people. The reign of terror and
the atrocities that the Somozas and the National
Guard perpetrated on the population of
Nicaragua are well-documented and undisputed. It
was in this setting that the Sandinist Front of Na
tional Liberation (FSLN) was born. In 1979, the
Sandinistas were finally able to overthrow the
corrupt and brutal dictatorship. It was a struggle
that cost the lives of 50,000 Nicaraguans — 2
percent of the total population.
Immediately after the revolution, the FSLN
conveyed to the United States its "wish to
develop the best possible relations and to heal
the wounds inflicted as a result of Washington's
historical complicity with Somoza." The Carter

Administration proceeded with a policy of
friendship that might have led us down a differ
ent path, but the Republican party platform of
that year explicitly "abhorred" the "Marxist-
Sandinista" takeover in Nicaragua. After the in
auguration of Ronald Reagan in 1980, the goal of
destabilizing the Nicaraguan Sandinista govern
ment became the policy of the United States.
This was the beginning of the U.S. effort to
rebuild Somoza's National Guard into a group
known as the contras, and the start of the dirty,
covert war against the legitimate and popularly
supported Nicaraguan government.
Democratic Rep. Jim Wright, the House
majority leader, said in 1983: "Contrary to the
president's claims, the contras are not 'freedom
fighters.' They are terrorists, pure and simple.
They offer Nicaraguans a return to the
nightmare of the Somoza regime, of campaigns
of mass killings."
Incredible as it may seem, our government
supports these atrocities with our tax dollars.
Think about that the next time you work an
eight-hour shift! Part of your work goes for the
torture and murder of innocent Nicaraguan
civilians. Aside from U.S: forces engaged in ex
ercises in Honduras, there are over 600 Central
Intelligence Agency operatives, technicians and
U.S. Embassy staff training and supporting over
10,000 contras. The contras would not exist
without U.S. support and aid.
We are pushing Nicaragua into the Soviet
camp. This is the lesson that we should have
learned from Cuba. Castro was not an avowed
Marxist prior to the revolution. It was only after
the revolution, when he was faced with hostility
from the United States and labeled a
"communist" by then Vice President Richard
Nixon, that he began leaning toward the left.
Although Marxist in ideology, the Sandinista
government has consistently avowed a policy of
"non-alignment." If it is Marxism that we are
protesting, then why is our policy toward com
munist China one of friendship? Does it not fol
low that if we pursued the same friendly attitude

with the Nicaraguans, we might have the same
relationship? The effect we are now having is
precisely the opposite of what we are hoping to
accomplish. We are bent on the destruction of
their government, and they have nowhere else
to turn but to the Soviet Union.
Echos of absurd phrases from Vietnam haunt
us again: "We had to destroy them in order to
save them." We can only prevail against the in
domitable spirit of the Nicaraguan people if we
destroy them. The only other outcome will be a
long drawn-out war against the Nicaraguan
people in their struggle for liberty and self
determination.
The next time you vote, think about the impli
cations your vote has for other peoples of the
world and the betterment of mankind. Write to
your congressman protesting present U.S.
foreign policy. Join groups involved in helping the
Nicaraguan people and informing the U.S. public
about what is really happening in Central
America. If we ignore what our government is
doing in Central American, we will be like the
German citizens in World War II who watched
the smoke spiral up from the ovens of Auschwitz
and pleaded ignorance.
As Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said,
"In memory of the millions of people killed in
wars throughout history; in memory of the mil
lions tortured and murdered in the Nazi concen
tration camps in World War II; in memory of the
thousands of patriots who fell in the struggles for
liberation and against colonialism, racism and all
kinds of oppression; in memory of the Central
American patriots who have fallen in the fight for
independence, justice and peace; for the right of
peoples to be free, sovereign and independent;
for the right of humanity to desire peace and to
demand peace — let there be peace in Central
America."
Let this also be our demand to our govern
ment. Leave Nicaragua alone.
