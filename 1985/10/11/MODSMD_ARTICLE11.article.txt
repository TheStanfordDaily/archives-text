## Israeli Raid Can't Be Condemned 
### 
We found it particularly amusing to read the
Daily editorial criticizing the United States for
not condemning Israel's attack on a Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) base in Tunisia.
The fact that the same day's paper tells of armed
Palestinians hijacking an Italian cruise ship with
more than 40() persons aboard illustrates the
gross ignorance of the editorial. Events such as
this hijacking show just how hard it is, even for
peace-desiring countries such as Israel, to deal

VIEWPOINT

with terrorism. On Sept. 25, three pro-
Palestinian gunmen seized a yacht in Larnaca,
Cyprus, killing the three Israeli civilians aboard.
On Oct. 6, three Israelis were shot to death in
two separate ambushes near the Israeli-occupied
West Bank. An anonymous telephone caller
claiming to represent "Force 17," Yasser
Arafat's bodyguard unit, claimed responsibility
for two of the killings. Like The Daily, we wish
that there could be "a halt to the cycle of Middle
East violence." Under the circumstances as they
exist, however, expecting Israel to refrain from
defending itself is not only naive, it is just plain
stupid. We must remember that terrorists do not
conform to any law or any system of morality.
While terrorists intentionally attack Israeli
civilians, including women and children, Israel
directs its attacks against the armed per
petrators themselves.
Condemning Israel for an act of self-defense
subjects her to standards higher than those of

every country in the Middle East and, for that
matter, the world. Members of the Force 17
already in Israeli custody identified the mur
derers of the three Israelis aboard the boat as
members of their group. They further claimed

After the attack on the
U.S. Marine barracks in
Lebanon, Reagan spoke of
'hitting the identified per
petrators of crimes swiftly
and surgically.' This is
just what Israel did.

that they had trained together at the PLO camp
in Tunisia — headquarters of the brutal terrorist
campaign being waged against Israel. Under
these circumstances, Israel's actions were
legally and morally justifiable. After the attack of

the U.S. Marine barracks in Lebanon, Reagan
spoke of "hitting the identified perpetrators of
crimes swiftly and surgically." This is just what
Israel did. Considering this, The Daily's editorial
should have read, "On the Failure to Defend an
Innocent Ally."
The White House was absolutely correct when
it called the attack an "expression of self
defense." Unfortunately, the United States
changed its position to one of "don't condemn"
but "don't condone," and failed to veto a United
Nations Security Council resolution comdemning
Israel. Why was this done? Because the attack
took place in Tunisia? This argument fails. Any
country that knowingly harbors terrrorist organi
zations, even upon the recommendation of the
U.S. government, cannot expect their "guests"
to be immune from attack if they carry out their
acts of terror. The world cannot sponsor havens
for killers. Israel did just what Reagan and Shultz
have been advocating for quite some time now.
Even as the United States failed to veto the
resolution, it issued a press release stating that
"states may respond with appropriate use of
force to deter these attacks." William Safire, a
New York Times columnist, said it best: "We did
not put our vote where our mouth was; our ally
stands censured and betrayed and our nation
stands shamed by moral cowardice."
