## 'Deliberately False Statements' Delivers Bizarre Event How to ruin a parking lot 
### MIKE ROSENTHAL 
Survival Research Laboratories'
recent show of "performance ma
chinery" in San Francisco was diffi
cult to decipher. Titled, at least ac
cording to the promotion poster,
"Deliberately False Statements,"
the event provided a superficial
logic of violence and destruction
while implying that there was
something false or wrong with the
system.
\ou could choose to enjoy the
events as entertainment or to ques
tion the perversity and grotesque
ness of this being presented as en
tertainment. But it was quickly
clear that the majority of the audi
ence (and perhaps the technicians
themselves) never made that dis
tinction.
In an empty parking lot in down
town San Francisco, surrounded by
the virtuosities of modern technol
ogy such as bridges, glass-flanked
skyscrapers and multi-level parking
lots, Survival Research Laborato
ries (the work of Mark Pauline and
Matt Heckert) had strewn various
odd mechanical contraptions that
recalled both the medieval age and
bad science fiction movies.
The show literally began with a
blast as a compression-run catapult
lofted into the night air a package
which burst, showering hundreds of
propaganda leaflets into the audi
ence in the bleachers that sur
rounded the "battlefield." As the
huge sonic cannon was pointed at
flimsy mock houses (one with a
human figure helplessly waving its
mechanical arms), a four-tubed gun
spewed forth its ammunition of long
neon light tubes, bursting with thin
wisps of gas and slivers of glass
against the defenseless targets.
One particularly "touching" mo
ment came when a tank-like preda
tor flanked by twin revolving
screws caught a small robot cov

ered with fur in its pincer. The
"doggie" (as it was nicknamed) was
taken over to a fire-breathing
dragon machine who incinerated it.

The squalid Hobbesian battle for
survival was greeted with fascina
tion and approval by the audience.
Here, war was presented in all its
finery with symbolic deaths and the
tangibly real thrills of explosions
and flares in the night.
You could suggest that Pauline's
intent was to strip the politics of
conflict away and expose the metal
sinews of the destructive machin
ery we have become. Throughout
the performance it was difficult to
distinguish the critical content of
the violence, if there was any at all.
It did occur to me that Pauline
and company was playing a joke on
us; herding us into this compound
to sit passively and watch glut
tonous destruction. He seemed to
say passivity characterizes our rela
tionship to violence — someone
says it is for the good of the country
or for the sake of art, and we accept
such explanations quietly.
When the conflagration had
ended and all was but wreckage,
the audience poured past the rope
and pillaged the lot for whatever
could be considered as loot —
propaganda leaflets, pieces of ma
chinery — while the San Francisco
Fire Department surveyed the
mess. Finally, the audience was
dispersed with the claim that "the
cops are coming" and people left
quietly, satiated for the moment.
"Deliberately False Statements"
proves that entertainment is either
absorbing art or masquerading as
such. If you think that video games
depicting life-like, violent struggles
are art, then you would have seen
before you the next step, the com
plement of the new fad of "human
survival games." But if you were
seeking a more critical statement,
this performance would be found
lacking.
