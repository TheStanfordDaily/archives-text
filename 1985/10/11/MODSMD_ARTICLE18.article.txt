# Just don't think about it

### EUGENE ROBINSON 
Reading the previous review of
Survival Research Laboratories'
recent performance piece, 1 find
myself in a quandary, that is: to jus
tify what needs no justifications.
SRL's presentation of machinery
gone mad in a performance entitled,
"Deliberately False Statements —
A Combination of Tricks and Illu
sions Guaranteed To Expose
Shrewd Manipulations of Fact," was
engaging, provocative and, finally,
uncompromising. To distance your
self from it is, in essence, to lose
the point.
Criticism requires distance, and
necessarily loses the point. The im
mediacy, the urgency of the piece is
lost when what has been directly
experienced has proven to be mere
grist for the mill, managing to be
toady to the intellect in a way that
throws askew any comprehensive
understanding of what occurred on
Sunday, Oct. 6, in the parking lot at
Folsom and Main Streets. Balance
must be re-established. The first
impression must be absorbed
before the second will be under
stood.
Michael Rosenthal's piece is, at
best, a second impression, denud
ing the performance of its vitality
and doing the work a great in
justice. The best to be offered in
this instance is a good, solid piece
of reportage. Unfortunately, you
will not get a good, solid piece of
reportage, but the first impressions
of a dyed-in-the-wool fan. Suspend
your interpretative faculties and try
to feel it.
The Muzak wafted across the
chilly parking lot, the arc lights cas
ting everything in bluish newsreel
light, as the near capacity crowd
waited impatiently for Mark
Pauline, Matt Heckert and Eric
Werner, the men behind Survival

Research Laboratories, to kick in
with their newest installment of
mechanized madness.
The field of action was comprised
of four shacks — three standing,
one mobile — a catapult, a cannon,
a bastardized missile launcher, drill
driven machines with pincers,
walking machines, stalking
machines, machines that spewed
fire and others. The Muzak blaring
out over the crowd halted, replaced
with a pre-recorded tape of assorted
noise, shrieks, crash sounds,
animal screams and heralding the
shows start, a cannon burst.
The lights, the action, the rock
ets red glare, the spin and twist of
machines were all in performance of
a nightmare that was more like a
mechanized version of a Boschian
hell than blood 'n' guts Rambo. The
show moved me to smile, to
scream, to move, to shake, to do
anything and everything except
"accept such explanations quietly."
I was not afforded the distance to
examine the artists' (a title rejected
by the men at SRL) motives and felt
no need to "decipher" the emotive
as it worked within me. It was
enough that it was working.
Video games, camouflage fash
ion, siege mentality, soulless inter
actions, mindlessness, sterile intel
lect uiili s m, mob psychology,
Rambo, flag waving and the thrills
and chills of life in the '80s, have
conspired to destroy the wide-eyed
sense of wonder that comes from
watching real people, not Pac Men,
orchestrate the fantastic.
SRL ushers in the beleaguered
subjective, the standard bearer of
eros, into a community awash in the
stultification of commonality, the
awful sameness of sameness, and
for this I am thankful.
Rosenthal's peevish critique is ill
conceived and ultimately, inappro
priate.
