# Scorchers Fizzle in Live Performance
## 
### MIKE HALE 
On their albums, Jason and the
Scorchers walk the line (any allu
sion to Johnny Cash being wholly in
tentional) between straight
country, Blasters-style rockabilly
revivalism, R.E.M.-style neo
psychedelia and punk. This unholy
mixture works on vinyl, because
the band synthesizes these ele
ments into its own unique sound —
if you can imagine Michael Stipe's
songs arranged by the Blasters,
played by Husker Du and sung by
Hank Williams, you've got some
idea of what Jason and the Scor
chers albums sound like.
The main thing, though, is that
they're good, impassioned rock 'n'
roll. "Fervor" and "Lost and
Found" are two of the best albums
of the '80s that you've never heard.
That's why Jason and the Scor
chers were so disappointing last
weekend at the Keystone Palo
Alto. I didn't expect them to
recreate their recorded sound live
— the Blasters, just to take an ex
ample of a group that's great in con
cert, sacrifice their quieter
moments when they play the
Keystone or the Stone — but I
thought they'd at least try to keep
all their different styles in the same
proportions.
Unfortunately, for some reason
they chose to grab onto the least
important component of their sound
— their punkish tempo and oc
casional guitar-army attack — and
push it to the limit, on eveiy song,
complete with heavy-metal leaps
and poses. The result was a lot

closer to a Friday night at the Fab
Mab than what could have been ex
pected from an innovative country
rock band from Nashville, Tenn.
This may have been partly the
Keystone's fault. As usual, the
amps were turned up to ear
exploding volume; the management
at the Keystone either thinks its
customers are deaf, or is deter
mined to make them that way. The
most painful aural experience of my
life was a Neil Young concert here a
few years ago. Maybe the
Keystone just knows its audience
well; when you're up front on the

dance floor and can't hear the music
anyway, all that matters are the
vibrations. But in back, among the
tables, groups of people got up and
left throughout the show, grimacing
and holding their ears. If the
Keystone is determined to be just
another thrash palace, why does it
bother to book serious national
acts?
Or maybe it was Jason and the
Scorchers' own fault. They may
have thought that, once away from
the centers of their cult popularity
— Los Angeles and Athens, Ga. —
their sophisticated sound wouldn't

go over on a first listen. Or they
may have underestimated their au
dience. Or maybe they'd really
rather be a thrash band; they cer
tainly looked and acted the part.
(On the other hand, they may have
had the audience sized up just right
— a cocktail waitress told me, "1
like them because they play fast,
but they're not thrash — you can
dance to them." She definitely had a
more complete grasp of the
nuances of punk style than I do, but
it's doubtful she'd ever heard of
Hank Williams.)
A few moments in the show
bucked the trend — the opening of
"Harvest Moon," one of the band's
best originals, was done in soft
country style, but soon enough lead
singer Jason Ringenberg leaped into
the air, the guitar crashed in and
the rest of the song was done at su
personic speed.
The band did an interesting cover
of Hank Williams' "Honky Tonk
Blues," which was interesting
mainly because it bore no
resemblance whatsoever to the
original. The one element of the
band's sound that should have come
through regardless — Ringenberg's
classic, almost-yodeling voice —
was completely drowned out by the
wall of guitar, which meant the
lyrics were also completely in
audible.
There was one saving grace to
the show: 1 discovered that when
the back of the Keystone clears
out, the club can be a pleasant place
to sit and watch a show. If they
ever get around to letting you hear
the music, they'll really have some
thing.
