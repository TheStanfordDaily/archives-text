### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial Staff 
In solidarity with anti-apartheid groups taking part
in a nationwide day of protest against university in
vestments in companies that do business in South
Africa, members of Stanford Out of South Africa
(SOSA) are planning a noon rally to be followed by a
"legal sit-in" in Old Union, according to SOSA mem
ber Mike Schmitz.
Students at approximately 70 universities are ex
pected to commemorate the designated national day
of protest by holding sit-ins and teach-ins and com
mitting acts of civil disobedience.
Following the rally at Stanford, planned for the

Old Union Courtyard, and a nationwide moment of
silence for the "victims of apartheid," protestors will
enter Old Union and remain in an undetermined area
inside until the building closes at 5 p.m., Schmitz
said.
He added that there is no chance that civil dis
obedience will take place, but SOSA member David
Romo, arguing that civil disobedience brought about
Columbia University's recent divestment, said last
night that "civil disobedience is still a considera
tion. "
Karen Holl, another SOSA member, stressed
that the protesters want to remain "flexible," and

Last spring students at UC-Berkeley demonstrated against university investment in South
Africa. Today anti-apartheid groups at an estimated 70 colleges are expected to join in a
nationwide day of protest.
