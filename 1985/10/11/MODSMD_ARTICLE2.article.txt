## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial Staff 
In solidarity with anti-apartheid groups taking part
in a nationwide day of protest against university in
vestments in companies that do business in South
Africa, members of Stanford Out of South Africa
(SOSA) are planning a noon rally to be followed by a
"legal sit-in" in Old Union, according to SOSA mem
ber Mike Schmitz.
Students at approximately 70 universities are ex
pected to commemorate the designated national day
of protest by holding sit-ins and teach-ins and com
mitting acts of civil disobedience.
Following the rally at Stanford, planned for the

Old Union Courtyard, and a nationwide moment of
silence for the "victims of apartheid," protestors will
enter Old Union and remain in an undetermined area
inside until the building closes at 5 p.m., Schmitz
said.
He added that there is no chance that civil dis
obedience will take place, but SOSA member David
Romo, arguing that civil disobedience brought about
Columbia University's recent divestment, said last
night that "civil disobedience is still a considera
tion. "
Karen Holl, another SOSA member, stressed
that the protesters want to remain "flexible," and

that the sit-in may not even take
place. "If people at the rally decide
to go in, we'll go — if that's what
we think will work best at the time.
Every SOSA member decides for
himself."
Nine students were arrested last
year when they refused to leave the
Bursar's Office in Old Union at 5
p.m.
As a way of preparing for and en
couraging participation in today's
activities, about 30 students saw a
movie about South Africa and held a
discussion in front of University
President Donald Kennedy's office
last night in the area of the Quad
where student protesters held a sit
in for nearly two months last
spring. Some of those at the
meeting carried sleeping bags and
guitars, planning to spend the night.
At today's rally, SOSA plans
speeches by senior Bill Cohn and
members of the Stanford African
Students' Association, before a 1

p.m. moment of silence in honor of
South African political prisoners.
SOSA member Brad Hightower
said that the primary focus of the
day will be to educate the Stanford
community on apartheid, since en
thusiasm for the divestment cause
has dwindled since last spring.
"There isn't a buzz on campus
about the issue so we feel
(tomorrow) should be educational,"
he said.
Protest Elsewhere
Meanwhile, anti-apartheid groups
on other college campuses
nationwide are planning marches,
rallies and speeches today to
protest their schools' investments
in companies that do business in
South Africa.
At UC-Berkeley, where 2
protesters were arrested yester
day for remaining inside Sproul
Hall, a campus administration build
ing, after it closed, demonstrators
are planning a rally to encourage di
vestment of the UC system's $1.6
billion in South Africa-related in
vestments.
The two men arrested yesterday

were among 11 who refused to
leave Sproul Hall following a "Take
back the steps of Sproul Hall" rally,
the protesters' effort to revive a
sit-in that lasted there for nearly
two months last spring.
Protesters plan to remain on the
steps until the conclusion of a rally
scheduled to begin at noon today.
At UCLA, anti-apartheid groups
are encouraging a boycott of
classes today. A document calling
for the boycott was endorsed on
Oct.l by both the Undergraduate
Students' Association Council and
the Graduate Students' Associa
tion, the two main student govern
ment organizations at the Los An
geles school, according to Terry
Carpenter, a writer for The Daily
Bruin.
At Cornell University, where
two protesters have been arrested
nearly every day since classes
began last month, protesters plan a
