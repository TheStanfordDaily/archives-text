# Berkeley Rep's 'Playboy' Lacking Emotional Force
## 
### PETER MORGAN 
Currently running at the "hot," "vibrant" and "up and coming"
Berkeley Repertory Theatre is, a classic Irish comedy by J.M. Syngp,
"The Playboy of the Western World." Unfortunately, the Rep hasn't
lived up to its merited reputation with this production, and although
the essence of Synge's play is shown, it is not felt.
What Synge intended is, of course, debatable, but here are some
fairly certain points. In 1907 his play was produced by the Abbey
Theatre in Dublin as a part of the "Irish Renaissance" that was aimed
at re-establishing the national spirit and image of Ireland.
Unfortunately, it was despised by the Irish public because of its
low (but comic) view of Irish peasants as drunkards, gossips and
cowards (among other things). This was a far cry from what Yeats
and others of the Abbey movement had been attempting with their
fairy tale folklore which romanticized the life of the Irish peasant.
Consequently, people rioted against the play.
Despite this violent beginning, "Playboy" has endured and become
what one critic has called "the greatest Irish play written."
The play itself follows a oddly comic plot about a young wanderer,
Christopher (Christy) Mahon, who enters a small rural village in the
west of Ireland (the "Western World" of the title). Although in reality
a simple, lazy nobody, he rises to hero status with the village by tel
ling a wild story about killing his father.
He basks in the admiration of the villagers, particularly the young
girls (and so the "Playboy"), until he is proven a fraud by the appear
ance of his supposedly dead father, bent on revenge. He and his
father fight again and apparently the father is killed.
The village reaction, however, is no longer one of admiration but
of detestation and Christy is rejected by all, including his only true
love, Pegeen Mike. Made aware of the villagers' shifting
opinions, he leaves the village no longer a coward but a confident in
dividual, taking his father, who has once again miraculously survived
death.
In this last section of the play, the comic roguery that has
dominated for so long shares focus with a serious social comment by
Synge. It is this sharing of focus between laughs and somberness at
the end that is the true difficulty of
producing the play, but also where
the play's lasting value is revealed.
On one hand we laugh at the
sight of the drunken clowns trying
to cart Christy off to the galiows,
Old Mahon appearing yet again, and
the coward Shawn Keough (Pegeen
Mike's other suitor) nursing his
wounds while trying to reconcile
himself to Pegeen.
On the other hand we are
silenced by the rift between Pegeen
and Christy, Christy's final speech
to the people, and particularly
Pegeen's terrible realization at the
final curtain that she has lost the
only man that would make her
happy.
It is a strange mixing of moods in
these last few minutes, and one
which most audiences would not
expect. The trick seems to me of
making the audience both laugh and
cry in the same moment rather than
one or the other. If this sounds like
Beckett, just remember who was
writing first.
At least this is what should hap
pen in a production loyal to the text,
and what did not happen at the Rep.
Sharon Ott's direction of the final
scene made some people laugh and
others wide-eyed, but I don't think
anyone felt both ways at the cur
tain. In other scenes, particularly
between the lovers, Ott delivered
the goods effortlessly, but not this
one of key importance.
In general the Rep's production
has an uneven quality. Some scenes
were wonderfully blocked while
others made me painfully aware
that I was watching people on a

stage and not at an Irish pothouse.
The acting suffered from several
leads doing "types" (the devious
widow, the drunk father, the
cowardly shepherd) rather than
anything with emotion behind it.
These were very well done
"types," as the Rep always boasts
talented actors, but the emotional
life necessary to both the comedy
and tragedy just wasn't there.
Jeffrey Bihr did an admirable job
as the Playboy, and his denuncia
tion of the people and praise of his
new life at his exit was quite power
ful. The supporting cast was solid
as well, particularly in creating a
humorous air (the two drunks en
tering in search of the third a partic
ular high point).

The emotional
heart just seemed
to beat irregularly.

The lyrical quality of Synge's
language sounded fantastic with the
cast's well-coached Irish dialect,
with lines like, "An' I be tinkin' you
be fancy." The pothouse set and
splattered costumes supported the
peasant atmosphere, complete with
quiet cow moos in the background.
The Rep's production values
were perfect (as always), but the
emotional heart just seemed to beat
irregularly, and at the most inop
portune times. It may be a case of
form over content, but since
"Playboy" is a fairly realistic play
we need that emotional intensity in
order to laugh as well as cry. At
best it was a muted intensity, at
worst not even there at all.

The play itself follows a oddly comic plot about a young wanderer,
Christopher (Christy) Mahon, who enters a small rural village in the
west of Ireland (the "Western World" of the title). Although in reality
a simple, lazy nobody, he rises to hero status with the village by tel
ling a wild story about killing his father.
He basks in the admiration of the villagers, particularly the young
girls (and so the "Playboy"), until he is proven a fraud by the appear
ance of his supposedly dead father, bent on revenge. He and his
father fight again and apparently the father is killed.
The village reaction, however, is no longer one of admiration but
of detestation and Christy is rejected by all, including his only true
love, Pegeen Mike. Made aware of the villagers' shifting
opinions, he leaves the village no longer a coward but a confident in
dividual, taking his father, who has once again miraculously survived
death.
In this last section of the play, the comic roguery that has
dominated for so long shares focus with a serious social comment by
Synge. It is this sharing of focus between laughs and somberness at
the end that is the true difficulty of
producing the play, but also where
the play's lasting value is revealed.
On one hand we laugh at the
sight of the drunken clowns trying
to cart Christy off to the galiows,
Old Mahon appearing yet again, and
the coward Shawn Keough (Pegeen
Mike's other suitor) nursing his
wounds while trying to reconcile
himself to Pegeen.
On the other hand we are
silenced by the rift between Pegeen
and Christy, Christy's final speech
to the people, and particularly
Pegeen's terrible realization at the
final curtain that she has lost the
only man that would make her
happy.
It is a strange mixing of moods in
these last few minutes, and one
which most audiences would not
expect. The trick seems to me of
making the audience both laugh and
cry in the same moment rather than
one or the other. If this sounds like
Beckett, just remember who was
writing first.
At least this is what should hap
pen in a production loyal to the text,
and what did not happen at the Rep.
Sharon Ott's direction of the final
scene made some people laugh and
others wide-eyed, but I don't think
anyone felt both ways at the cur
tain. In other scenes, particularly
between the lovers, Ott delivered
the goods effortlessly, but not this
one of key importance.
In general the Rep's production
has an uneven quality. Some scenes
were wonderfully blocked while
others made me painfully aware
that I was watching people on a

stage and not at an Irish pothouse.
The acting suffered from several
leads doing "types" (the devious
widow, the drunk father, the
cowardly shepherd) rather than
anything with emotion behind it.
These were very well done
"types," as the Rep always boasts
talented actors, but the emotional
life necessary to both the comedy
and tragedy just wasn't there.
Jeffrey Bihr did an admirable job
as the Playboy, and his denuncia
tion of the people and praise of his
new life at his exit was quite power
ful. The supporting cast was solid
as well, particularly in creating a
humorous air (the two drunks en
tering in search of the third a partic
ular high point).

The emotional
heart just seemed
to beat irregularly.

The lyrical quality of Synge's
language sounded fantastic with the
cast's well-coached Irish dialect,
with lines like, "An' I be tinkin' you
be fancy." The pothouse set and
splattered costumes supported the
peasant atmosphere, complete with
quiet cow moos in the background.
The Rep's production values
were perfect (as always), but the
emotional heart just seemed to beat
irregularly, and at the most inop
portune times. It may be a case of
form over content, but since
"Playboy" is a fairly realistic play
we need that emotional intensity in
order to laugh as well as cry. At
best it was a muted intensity, at
worst not even there at all.
Currently running at the "hot," "vibrant" and "up and coming"
Berkeley Repertory Theatre is, a classic Irish comedy by J.M. Syngp,
"The Playboy of the Western World." Unfortunately, the Rep hasn't
lived up to its merited reputation with this production, and although
the essence of Synge's play is shown, it is not felt.
What Synge intended is, of course, debatable, but here are some
fairly certain points. In 1907 his play was produced by the Abbey
Theatre in Dublin as a part of the "Irish Renaissance" that was aimed
at re-establishing the national spirit and image of Ireland.
Unfortunately, it was despised by the Irish public because of its
low (but comic) view of Irish peasants as drunkards, gossips and
cowards (among other things). This was a far cry from what Yeats
and others of the Abbey movement had been attempting with their
fairy tale folklore which romanticized the life of the Irish peasant.
Consequently, people rioted against the play.
