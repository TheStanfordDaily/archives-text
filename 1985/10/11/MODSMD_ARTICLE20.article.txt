Berkeley Repertory Theatre is, a classic Irish comedy by J.M. Syngp,
"The Playboy of the Western World." Unfortunately, the Rep hasn't
lived up to its merited reputation with this production, and although
the essence of Synge's play is shown, it is not felt.
What Synge intended is, of course, debatable, but here are some
fairly certain points. In 1907 his play was produced by the Abbey
Theatre in Dublin as a part of the "Irish Renaissance" that was aimed
at re-establishing the national spirit and image of Ireland.
Unfortunately, it was despised by the Irish public because of its
low (but comic) view of Irish peasants as drunkards, gossips and
cowards (among other things). This was a far cry from what Yeats
and others of the Abbey movement had been attempting with their
fairy tale folklore which romanticized the life of the Irish peasant.
Consequently, people rioted against the play.
Despite this violent beginning, "Playboy" has endured and become
what one critic has called "the greatest Irish play written."
The play itself follows a oddly comic plot about a young wanderer,
Christopher (Christy) Mahon, who enters a small rural village in the
west of Ireland (the "Western World" of the title). Although in reality
a simple, lazy nobody, he rises to hero status with the village by tel
ling a wild story about killing his father.
He basks in the admiration of the villagers, particularly the young
girls (and so the "Playboy"), until he is proven a fraud by the appear
ance of his supposedly dead father, bent on revenge. He and his
father fight again and apparently the father is killed.
The village reaction, however, is no longer one of admiration but
of detestation and Christy is rejected by all, including his only true
love, Pegeen Mike. Made aware of the villagers' shifting
opinions, he leaves the village no longer a coward but a confident in
dividual, taking his father, who has once again miraculously survived
death.
In this last section of the play, the comic roguery that has
dominated for so long shares focus with a serious social comment by
Synge. It is this sharing of focus between laughs and somberness at
