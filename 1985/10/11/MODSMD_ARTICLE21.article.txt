# SF Opera's 'Orlando' Is Uninspiring
## 
### ELAINE WANG 
The San Francisco Opera's production of Handel's "Orlando" was a
decidedly uneven event, the finest aspects being Marilyn Home and the
orchestra (under the guidance of Charles Mackerras).
Home played the titular hero, a warrior smitten with a queen (Angelica)
and torn between a life of glory and a life of love. Her voice and technique
were, of course, superb, though it takes a few double-takes to accept this
foremost mezzo soprano in a male role. But Home approached the charac
ter with spunkiness and, occasionally, pure glee.
As a character, Orlando is hotheaded, prone to control by the super
natural. The magician Zoroastro protects Orlando's glory and, through
dreams, urges him to abandon his love for Angelica. Orlando is equally
volatile in love as in battle, and at times is comic.
As such, Home tended to stomp about and wave her (his?) sword while
singing her many proclamations. One scene in last Thursday's production
called on Home to throw a pillow offstage. When the moment arrived, the
pillow fell short. Without missing a beat, Home jauntily picked up the pil
low, tossed it off the stage, then turned right around and air-fenced across
the stage. The exuberance of this instantly picked up the slowness of this
baroque piece.
Some uplifting humor was provided by Kevin Langan, as Zoroastro, and
his crew of white-wigged pages. Much of it was pantomime, but those
lively scenes contained more movement than the rest of the production put
together.
Other characters were not as dynamic. Valerie Masterson, as the
Queen of Cathay (Angelica), had an accomplished technique but a voice
that tended to be on the shrill side. She was, however, appropriately regal
in the role. •
Perhaps the most disorienting character was Medoro, lover of Angelica
and rival of Orlando, played by Jeffrey Call. The part is a counter tenor,
meaning a male voice singing in a unusually high range. To hear a male
female duet sung in the high range is disconcerting, although Call pulled it
off with style.
Lackadaisical direction accounted for the weakness in this production of
"Orlando." Handel's music is beautiful, but subdued and repetitive; the
storyline of "Orlando" is complicated and involves many monologues. What
the production needed was mostly action from the performers onstage —
not acrobatics while they were singing, certainly, but some movement
about the stage.
The settings, too, tended to be dark and murky, only occasionally
brightened with red lighting. Coupled with an unusually stuffy opera house,
this experience of "Orlando" was generally somnambulic and uninspiring.


Mezzo soprano Marilyn Home sings the title role in San Fran
cisco Opera's production of "Orlando," in which she plays a
man foolishly in love with a queen.
