When I was a starving Stanford student, Mountain
Mike's regular Wednesday all-you-can-eat night used to
be my big night out. *
So when my kid sister asked me to review it, I really
didn't need to make a special trip.
But who can resist "all you can eat?"
The way all-you-can-eat night works is simple. You
pay $4 for a plate (drinks are extra), and the staff
brings around various pizzas from which you can take
one piece at a time.
The pizza quality at Mountain Mike's is very good.
Toppings on a fairly thick crust with plenty of tomato
sauce range from plain cheese to standards like pep
peroni and Unguis, with more California-esque types
like pineapple, which is interesting, and artichoke,
which is my absolute favorite.
The pizzas roll out of the kitchen fast and regularly,
so they're literally straight out of the oven.
The people behind the counter and those who hand
out the pizza are friendly, but also efficient. They'll al
most always respond to a jesting comment, or even
crack a joke, but they keep things moving.
The atmosphere at Mountain Mike's is definitely
casual. Pine tables with benches sport napkin holders,
salt and pepper shakers and candles. Other condiments
are on a separate table. A television, a video game and
a juke-box add to a comfortable, relaxed environment.
Other nights at this pizza place are also fun. The
menu — which, of course, you can order from on Wed
nesdays, too — includes various hot sandwiches like
hamburgers and hot dogs and so on, salads and fries.
And, of course, pizzas.
Prices are nice and low, good for a student budget.
For those of you over 21 (Mountain Mike's does

comply strictly with drinking age laws), you can choose
from Budweiser or Henry Weinhard's Dark on tap, or
from a small but reasonable selection of bottled beers,
including some imports. There is also wine, soft
drinks, coffee and tea available.
Only a seven-minute bike-ride from the Quad,
Mountain Mike's is open Sunday through Thursday 11
a.m. to 12:30 a.m., Friday and Saturday 11 a.m. to
11:30 p.m.
And just in case you didn't eat all you can eat, there's
always ice cream at Mom and Pop's One Stop just
across the street.
