# Mom and Pop Settle In

Mom and Pop's One Stop Ice
Cream and Video Shop
2001 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
Ice cream sundaes and VCR
rental movies are two items not
available on the Stanford campus.
Fortunately, Mom and Pop's One
Stop Ice Cream and Video Shop of
fers both just about as close to
campus as you can get.
Located on the corner of El
Camino and Stanford Street, across
from Mountain Mike's Pizza, Mom
and Pop's offers at least 32 flavors
(that's one up on Baskin Robbin's)
of Bud's Ice Cream, and stocks 250
VHS tapes of the newest releases.
This new store's peculiar combi
nation of products was not the
original intention of the owners.
In June, Mom and Pop (a.k.a.
Diane Holland and Peter Morry)
decided to leave their careers in
construction and property manage
ment in order to make their
fortune. Their original intention
was to open a video shop, which
they felt comfortable running given
their habit of going to the movies
three times a week.
A search for a store led to their
present location, which had been
vacant for two years but was leased
by Bud's Ice Cream. Bud's had
been meaning to open its own store
there, but a shift in corporate
priorities had kept the lot vacant.
Diane and Peter asked if they
could lease the store for a video

shop, .but Bud's could not let them.
The actual owners really wanted an
ice cream shop there.
Bud's counter-proposal was for
Diane and Peter to run an ice cream
store. Unfortunately, Diane and
Peter knew nothing about ice
cream. Bud's said they could pro
vide the expertise concerning ice
cream, and Diane and Peter
agreed, as long as they could add
the videos, too.
Four months later, having used
all of their financial resources, the
store is open.
While it may be too early to tell,
the combination of ice cream and
videos is an apparent success, for
the customers and for Diane and
Peter. Bud's ice cream is generally

recognized as one of the best in the
area.
Time magazine has called it one
of the best in the world.
Bud's has made the store an im
mediate success, and the customer
traffic generated by the ice cream
benefits the video side of the busi
ness, which is growing somewhat
more slowly.
Diane and Peter presently have
250 videos, which is a fairly small
selection, but their familiarity with
the movies let them pick a good li
brary. Their stocking emphasis is
on new releases. It would take any
movie buff a long time to rent all the
movies he or she wants from them,

"Mom and Pop," a.k.a. Diane Holland and Peter Morry, hope to
supply Stanford students with ice cream and movies at their El
Camino Real shop.
