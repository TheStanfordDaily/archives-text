No pretensions, no poetry, just
the facts â€” a great meal.
On top of one of the highest
points in the Bay Area, overlooking
valleys and mountains, there is a
cabin. . . . No, a restaurant.
It's good, real good. It's called
the Bella Vista; the view is great,
but there's more to the restau
rant than meets the eye.
Sounds like it would be down
home cooking from out of the
hearth.
It's not.
It's fine French and Italian
cuisine, "like they do it over there."
The simple interior is decorated
by raftered ceilings and firewood
stacked along the walls. On the
night we dined at the Bella Vista,
the two rooms of tables were filled.
The room with the view goes first;
reservations are a must. There was
an interesting crowd: a table of
businessmen, a young couple in
love and a birthday party. We could
hear others talking pleasantly
around us.
We started the dinner with two

Kirs. No ice, but a twist floated in
the crystal glasses.
Although the menu was in
French, Steve, our bearded waiter,
translated with all the flair of an
American in Paris.
Decisions, decisions, decisions.
Appetizers: hot, cold, salads and
soups.
Entrees: lots of fish, meat and
foul from which to choose.
Desserts: order it now or crave
it later. Forty-five minutes notice
required for any souffle dessert.
We chose from among the ap
petizers offered. The Coquilles St.
Jacques was hot and the Saumon
fume was pleasantly chilled. The

sauce on the scallops was creamy
and thick: it enhanced, rather than
dominated, the taste of the dish.
The salmon was prepared in a
typically French manner. About
two ounces of fish were strategi
cally placed on a bed of romaine
with capers and lemon serving as
highlights. Four triangular pieces of
white toast (no crust, of course) at
tended.
We declined the house salad in
lieu of the chef's special of the
evening. In a vinagrette lay hearts
of palm and endive. The vegetables
were tasty, but the dressing was
heavy and abundant.
An appropriate Champagne Sor

bet followed.
We decided to share the salmon
and the lamb. A Chardonnay would
go well with both entrees.
First the fish: it was prepared en
croute. Surrounded by a puff
pastry, and bathed in a creamed
Champagne sauce, fresh salmon
and duxelle (a combination of
chopped mushrooms and shallots)
rested peacefully. A bite of this
entree was a taste of Nirvana.
The lamb. Doused in dijonaise
sauce, the cube of meat was lean
and tender. The sauce, in my
opinion, was too light for the heavy
meat, but my companion managed
to force down all of her entree, and
half of mine.
The Grigich Hills 1983 Chardon
nay complemented the entire meal.
Although white, this Chardonnay
enhanced the flavor of the lamb as
well as the fish.
The hot strawberry souffle that
followed was perfect in texture. Al
though its taste was subtle, the
tang of the strawberries, combined
with the Grand Marnier sauce,
enticed our buds to take one more
bite.
Such elegant food in such a rustic
environment would seem unex
pected. But in the wooded hills of
Skyline Drive, none other than an
unpretentious lodge would fit.
And only such a bella vista could
play host to such fine food.
