## Card Hosts 3-1-1 UCLA 
### GEOFF SANBORN Senior staff writer 
After three straight losses in which its opponents
have averaged over 40 points, the Stanford football
brain trust appears to have gotten tired of standing pat.
Nothing's definite yet, but sources close to the team
say there's a good chance that defensive coordinator
Dick Mannini will take freshman defensive back Sam
Sutherland off the redshirt list and play him against
UCLA tomorrow in place of senior free safety Mark
Hashimoto.
Hashimoto has played erratically so far this year. He
is the Cardinal's fourth-leading tackier with 28 stops
and he has one interception, but he has been burned on
a few big plays.
Sutherland, a highly-prized recruit out of Banning
High School in Carson, practiced with the starting sec
ondary all this week and looked impressive. He had not
practiced with the first string before this week, accord
ing to Sports Information Director Steve Raczynski.
The change would be a dramatic reversal of the
Cardinal coaching staffs plans for its freshman class.
Backup nose guard Ray Huckestein was the only fresh
man the coaching staff had planned to play this year. As
recently as Monday, Coach Jack Elway was saying, "I
don't think playing any of the (other) freshmen would
make an impact."
Activating Sutherland would be a clear sign that
Stanford (1-3) has not given up on the season, but it's
hard to tell what effect it would have on the team. It
could either be seen as a panicky midseason shakeup
or a move to strengthen the team's present, rather
than worry about its future.
There could be another surprise in the secondary to
morrow. Senior cornerback Walt Harris, lost three
weeks ago to a dislocated elbow, might see some ac
tion against the Bruins.
The original schedule for Harris' return was four to
six weeks, but he has healed rapidly, and practiced in
pads this week. Though junior Chris Young is still the
best bet to start at the right corner, No. 31 could get
into the game later on.
Now, will new faces mean a new attitude? The Card
inal's mental state is far and away the biggest key to its
matchup with the 16th-ranked Bruins (3-1-1). Stanford
can beat UCLA, but it could have beaten Oregon and
San Diego State, too, if it had kept its head in the
game.
If the Cardinal gets fired up for the Bruins, and stays
aggressive for 60 minutes, it has a shot at pulling off its
second straight upset over its southern rivals.
For one thing, UCLA is without tailback Gaston
Green and wide receiver Mike Sherrard, who Coach
Terry Donahue dubbed "our two best offensive
players." Their absence will mean a change in the
Bruins' offensive style.
"We're not going to have the explosiveness without
them that we would have with them," Donahue said.
"We're going to be a little bit more methodical on of
fense Saturday."
Sherrard's replacement is sophomore Willie Ander

son, whose inexperience — two career receptions —
could put extra pressure on quarterback David Norrie.
Norrie had a career day against Arizona State last
week, hitting on 14 of 24 passes for 215 yards and two
TDs, but he is not noted for his consistency.
On the other side of the field, quarterback John Paye
will face a serious challenge from the blitz-happy

Bruins. Against Oregon, Paye had some trouble pick
ing up the blitz and finding the open man. If the limping
offensive line doesn't hold up — tackle Jeff Marchin and
guards Tom Nye and Andy Sinclair are all nursing ankle
injuries — Stanford is in a lot of trouble.

The Cardinal offense has done its job when it has gotten the chance, but Stanford's defense has
more often than not been on the field. To bar the door on UCLA, the Stanford braintrust may
shake up the defensive secondary, replacing Mark Hashimoto with Sam Sutherland.
