# Dodgers Clip Redbirds, 8-2

### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Orel Hershiser pitched Los
Angeles to an 8-2 victory over the wasteful St. Louis
Cardinals last night and helped throw the switch on a
power surge that carried the Dodgers to a sweep of
the first two games of the National League playoffs.
Greg Brock hit a two-run homer in the fourth inning
off Joaquin Andujar, and Ken Landreaux doubled twice
and singled, drove in a run and scored three times. Bill
Madlock added three singles, two of which drove in
runs, to the Dodgers' 13-hit attack.
Hershiser, 19-3 with 11 consecutive victories to
close the season, allowed eight hits and gave up only
one St. Louis run until the ninth. He also drove in the
Dodgers' first run to ignite a three-run third inning.
Hershiser walked five, struck out four, and got into
his groove after muddling through some early-inning
problems. At one point in the late innings, he retired
eight in a row and allowed three hits in the final five in
nings, including two in the ninth when the Cardinals
scored their second run.
The Cardinals failed on two fronts. Andujar, 21-12
after finishing the season with three straight losses,
was ineffective after retiring the first seven batters,
contributing to his own downfall with a costly error.
And the normally opportunity Cardinals failed time and
again to capitalize on chances to score against Her
shiser.
Both Vince Coleman and Willie McGee, the Car
dinals' two speedsters, were thrown out trying to steal
in the first inning by catcher Mike Scioscia, and the
Cardinals stranded five baserunners in the first three
innings.
The playoffs move to St. Louis for Games 3, 4 and 5
on Saturday, Sunday and Monday. Tomorrow's game
will match right-handers Bob Welch, 14-4 for Los An
geles, against Danny Cox, 18-9. Fernando Valenzuela
pitched the Dodgers to a 4-1 victory in Game 1 Wed
nesday night.
The Dodgers got their first hit off Andujar with one
out in the third inning, quickly erasing a 1-0 lead the
Cardinals had taken in the top half of the inning with
three runs of their own.
Steve Sax singled up the middle, and when Andujar's
wild pickoff throw went into right field, Sax raced all
the way to third.
Hershiser failed in two squeeze-bunt attempts, the
first one going foul by only inches down the first-base
line. But, with the infield in at the corners, Hershiser
bounced a single over the head of third baseman Terry
Pendleton to tie the score 1-1.
After Mariano Duncan flew out, Landreaux doubled
to the wall in left-center as Hershiser scored easily
from first. Madlock, who scored twice in the Dodgers'
victory in Game 1, singled into left field, scoring
Landreaux and going to second on the late throw
home. Andujar, who lost eight of his last 12 decisions,
walked Pedro Guerrero intentionally, and a passed ball
by Darrell Porter allowed the runners to advance.
The Dodgers scored two more in the fourth, making
the score 5-1 on Brock's two-run homer.
The Dodgers padded their lead to 6-1 with a run in
the fifth that chased Andujar.
