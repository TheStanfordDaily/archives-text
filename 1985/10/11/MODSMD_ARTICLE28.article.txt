# Stanford Spikers Roll Over Santa Clara
## Take on No.4 San Jose St. Tonight 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
The No. 1-ranked Stanford
women's volleyball team was finally
presented with an easy match and
the Cardinal women gladly ac
cepted, pounding host Santa Clara
by scores of 15-1, 15-7 and 15-4 in
a tune-up for tonight's match with
No. 4 San Jose State at Maples
Pavilion.
The Cardinal, who remained un
defeated, improving their record to
13-0, showed Santa Clara just why
they are the top team in the
country.

"It was nice to have a breather
for a change," Cardinal Co-coach
Don Shaw said. "They (Santa
Clara) weren't quite in the same
league."
Just how much of a mismatch was
last night's match? One indicator
would be the respective hitting per
centages of the two teams. Stan
ford hit at a .405 clip while the
Broncos were unable to nail one out
of every 10 spikes, hitting at a

paltry .096 rate.
"That pretty much told the
story," Shaw said.
Despite the obvious lack of com
petition, the Cardinal women did
play a solid match, according to
Shaw, not allowing a letdown to bog
them down.
"We wanted to do two things
tonight," Shaw said. "When we had
an easy chance to score, we didn't
want to squander it. We were doing
a real good job of that."
Shaw also said that the Cardinal
needed to improve its block, which
in Monday's UOP match got in the
way more often than it helped. In
this aspect Stanford was vastly im
proved last night, Shaw said.
The Cardinal women were con
tent to share the wealth throughout
the easy victory. Each regular con
tributed fairly equally to the cause.
"Everybody played pretty well,"
Shaw said.
Barbra Fontana — coming off of
one of her finest matches of the
season — and Theresa Smith led
the Cardinal with nine kills on the
night. Kim Oden notched eight
kills, followed by Brooke Hahner
with six.
"Our concentration level was
good," Shaw said, pointing to the
fact that the Cardinal women had
only eight hitting errors for the
entire match.
As well as being a warm-up for
tonight's battle with San Jose, last
night's match benefited Stanford in
another way. With the outcome of
the match well in hand, Shaw and
Co-coach Fred Sturm were able to
rest the regular players and enable
several reserves to see action. "It
gave us a chance to play a lot of
people," Shaw said.
Shaw applauded the play of
Christy Moiso. "Christy did a good

job coming off of the bench," he
said.
Tonight's match with San Jose
promises to be an emotionally
charged one. Three weeks ago the
Cardinal defeated the Spartans in
five games to capture the champi
onship of the Spartan Shops Invita
tional at San Jose. "They don't for
get those things," Shaw said.
San Jose also resents being con
sidered "second-best" in this area.
"They've always kind of had that
feeling," Shaw said. "They have
that No. 2 kind of syndrome."
Thus, while the Cardinal has an
undefeated record and the No. 1
ranking on the line, there is much at
stake for San Jose in terms of
reputation, and they are coming
into the match as prepared as ever.
"I know that they've been scout
ing us a lot," Shaw said. "I've seen
a lot of their people in the stands at
our matches."
The Spartans feature one of the
top setters in the nation in Terri
Deßusk — the Most Valuable
Player of the Spartan Shops Invita
tional despite playing on the runner
up team.
"She's one of the better setters,"
Shaw said. "She's a real fine
player."
San Jose has never failed to be
emotionally prepared for the Card
inal, Shaw said. "Not once have
they not been pumped up for us."
Stanford students have been
coming out in throngs to watch
matches at Maples and Shaw urged
a continuation of the crowd enthusi
asm. "We really need a big crowd
tonight."
Should the Cardinal women
prevail tonight, it will mark the
seventh time already this season
that they have defeated a Top 10
team.
