# Hockey Meets Berkeley Here
## 
### MARK SMOYER Staff Writer 
The Stanford field hockey team
will host California tomorrow at 1
p.m., hoping to prove that Wednes
day's 3-2 win over San Jose State
was no fluke. They will also try to
avenge last year's 3-2 loss to Cal in
the final game of the 1984 regular
season, a loss that kept the Card
inal out of the playoffs.
Before yesterday's practice,
several players spoke of the San
Jose game as a big plus going into
tomorrow's match.
"I think that got us going in the
right direction," freshman
midfielder Alison Smith said.
"Momentum, that's the word, mo
mentum. "
"It sure helps," senior defense
man Susan Fisher said. "We're on
firm ground now."
Cardinal Head Coach Sheryl
Johnson, California Class of '80,
agreed with her players. "As the
game progressed, we got better.
So that's something we can build
on."
Before Wednesday, the squad
had been unable to score consis
tently despite more than enough
opportunities. Johnson said that the
victory proved that the Cardinal
could "finish" their offensive at
tacks. "The kids just got hungry to
score and it paid off."

Bears' Head Coach Donna Fong
spoke respectfully of Stanford. "It
will be a very difficult game," Fong
said. "They have a very good nu
cleus of athletes."
Fong also said that California
"can't afford to make any big
mistakes. We can't play hit and run,
not against a team like Stanford."
Both coaches spoke of the
other's control game. Johnson said
that the teams' identical styles
should make tomorrow's match "a
nice one to watch." She said the
Cardinal would be watching the
Bears' Gretchen Scheel especially
closely. The Cal defenseman has
made it to the highest level of
Olympic Development camps.
Last season's season-ending loss
to California followed a 5-1 win for
the Cardinal earlier in the season.
The two have yet to face one an
other this fall. Stanford's record
stands at 2-3-1 overall and 1-1-1 in
the Northern Pacific Conference.
The Bears are 3-3-1 overall, 2-1-1
in the conference.
On Wednesday, as the Cardinal
was beating the Spartans, Cal was
handing Chico State their first loss
in NorPac competition, 1-0.
Fong said that the win at Chico
"made the team feel real good."
She considers Stanford and Chico
to be the two strongest NorPac
teams.

Cardinal Field Hockey players will fight for the ball with a little extra desire today as they seek to
avenge last year's final-game, 3-2 defeat at the hands of Berkeley. The loss denied Stanford a
berth in the NCAA playoffs.
