# Cowell Begins To Fight Ignorance About AIDS
## 
### DOUG LEADON 
Cowell Student Health Center will be "making a con
centrated effort" this fall to inform the Stanford com
munity about AIDS, according to Cowell Director Dr.
Paul Walters. The educational projects are to target all
University students and staff "to let people know that
this isn't only a problem for the gay community; it's
potentially a problem for everybody."
Roland Van Gaalen, treasurer and spokesman for
the Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford (GLAS),
agreed. "The gay community in San Francisco and we
here have been aware of the problem for several
years," Van Gaalen said. "It really is an issue that
should concern everyone." t
Van Gaalen and Walters both stressed that further
education regarding acquired immune deficiency
syndrome is essential. Walters called education and
prevention "the only effective treatment for AIDS."
According to Campus Report, 10 members of the
Stanford community have been diagnosed as having
AIDS. At least two of them died from the disease. "It
seems clear that we have a serious epidemic," Walters
said.
Cowell's information program will include presenta
tions in student residences of a KPIX-TV documentary
"Our Worst Fear: The AIDS Epidemic" between Oct.
14 and Nov. 7. Physicians from Cowell will be available
to answer questions after each showing. Then in mid-
November an issue of The Student Body, a supple
ment to The Daily, will be devoted entirely to AIDS.
"We want to talk to students about the disease, how
it's transmitted, what's safe sex, what's unsafe sex,"
Walters said. He became concerned about campus edu
cation regarding AIDS last year and began communi
cating with health service directors at other univer
sities in order to learn what kind of programs were
already in effect. Each center Walters contacted had
already dealt with a student or staff member afflicted
with AIDS. But so little was known about the nature of
the disease that very few universities had comprehen
sive programs and policies to deal with the problem.
But when researchers isolated the AIDS virus last

fall, "information began to grow geometrically," ac
cording to Walters. By the end of last year "evidence
began to come together that made a more complete
educational piogram possible."
In late August, Walters met with Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons and Doryn Davis-Chervin, Cowell's
director of health promotion, to gather the available in
formation.
Together with other staff members they formulated
the Cowell outreach program on AIDS education which
will be presented this fall. The program's goal is to
"give as much current knowledge as we have and dis
pell a lot of the myths and fears people have concerning
AIDS," Davis-Chervin said.
The Cowell administrators have been working with
GLAS in that each organization keeps the other aware
of its plans and activities regarding AIDS. But the focus
of AIDS-related projects sponsored by GLAS has been
on the education of the gay community.
"I'm confident that all members of the Stanford gay
community know how AIDS is transmitted," Van
Gaalen said. GLAS has made available free fliers con
taining up-to-date information on the disease. In addi
tion, the organization occasionally sponsors lectures by
medical experts and offers a weekly discussion group
headed by Dr. Carlos Greaves, a psychiatrist with
Stanford Counseling and Psychological Services.
"We feel we have the duty to provide a supportive
environment for members of the gay community and,
of course, for AIDS victims," Van Gaalen said, though
he said he knows of no AIDS victims on campus at this
time.
Besides its educational and supportive programs,
GLAS is involved in lobbying for the civil rights of gay
individuals. Van Gaalen, Walters and Davis-Chervin all
expressed concern that the AIDS issue not be used as
a fulcrum for the discrimination and ostracism of the
gay community.
since /U percent of documented AIDS cases
have involved gay or bisexual men, but the virus has
not been restricted to that particular group. AIDS can
not be contracted through casual contact with a carrier,
but there are unsafe practices which can increase the
risk of AIDS in any individual.
