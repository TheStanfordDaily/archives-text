# Sailors in Monterey
## 
### 
The Stanford sailing team will
be hitting the water again thi§
weekend, hosting the North Sloop
Eliminations in Monterey. Coming
off a disappointing performance last
weekend in the Singlehanded
Eliminations, the Cardinal should
have no problem sinking the com
petition this weekend.
"To qualify should be no trou
ble," Coach Joe Petrucci said.
There will be six teams sailing in
the regatta: UC-Berkeley, UC-
Santa Cruz, the California Maritime
Academy, Sonoma State, Cal-Poly
San Luis Obispo and Stanford. Of
these, the top three finishers will
go on to the Pacific Coast Sloop
Championships to be held at UC-
Irvine next weekend.
The Pacific Coast Sloop Cham
pionships will pit seven teams,
three from Northern California,
three from Southern California, and
one from Hawaii, together. They
will vie for one spot at the National
Sloop Championships to be held in
New Orleans.
The teams will practice tomor
row for this round robin tourna
ment. The teams will use each of
the six boats entered in Sunday's
six races to ensure equity among
entrants.
The team is very confident about
qualifying for the regatta next
weekend, but wary of making any
predictions. "I would be very
surprised if we didn't qualify,"
Petrucci said. "Next weekend
remains to be seen."
