# Men Look To Break Spell

### CHRIS FIALKO Staff writer 
Years of frustration could end tonight for the Stan
ford men's soccer team.
The Cardinal travels to Steve Negoesco Stadium
today for a 7:30 p.m. contest against the tradition
laden University of San Francisco Dons.
And tradition is what Stanford will be trying to
break.
The last time the Cardinal even came close to
defeating the perennially powerful Dons was a 4-4 tie in
1976. In 1974, the Cardinal had a winning goal against
the Dons called back and had to settle for a 2-2 tie.
Over the last eight years, USF has run off six
straight victories over the Stanford, often by lop-sided

scores.
The Dons, 6-3-3 overall and 1-0 in the Pacific Soccer
Conference, had better not rest on their laurels,
however, because this may be the best Stanford team
they've faced in a long time.
Second-year head coach Sam Koch's squad sports a
record of 6-6-2 overall and 1-1 in the PSC. But this
Cardinal team is much better than the run of the mill
. 500 club.
"We have a lot of potential," Cardinal sweeperback
Phil Horvath said. "We had a couple of tough losses
early, so our record doesn't reflect the way we're
playing now."
Indeed, Stanford has rebounded from that 1-3-1
start to win five out of its last 9 games. Two of the
losses in that stretch came at the hands of nationally
ranked UCLA and Fresno State.
