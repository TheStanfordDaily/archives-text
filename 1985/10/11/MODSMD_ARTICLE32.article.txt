# Women Travel to SF St.

### ERIK STEN Staff writer 
With a positive mindset and a little bit of confi
dence, Stanford's women's soccer team is ready for
today's 5 p.m. game against the University of San
Francisco.
Last week the Cardinal snapped a three-game
losing streak with an impressive 3-0 win over
Sacramento State. And with a tough schedule com
ing up in the next two weeks, the squad would like
to put another notch in the win column.
If one word was chosen to sum up the Don's team
that word would be inexperienced. This is USF's
first year with a women's soccer program and as

Cardinal Coach Helen Keohane said, "I haven't seen
them play myself, but I guess they're not too
strong."
In their last outing the Dons lost 7-0 to the Santa
Clara Broncos, a team that dumped the Cardinal in
overtime. The loss moved USF's season record to a
dismal 1-5. Stanford's season mark stands at 3-5-1.
If a surprise happens, it will most likely be led by
Terry Wheeler, a Palo Alto native who is the Don's
most prominent player. Wheeler has played with a
number of the Cardinal players on local club teams
and has the talent to significantly affect the outcome
of the game.
Two other USF players to watch are Joan Har
rington and Maureen McLaughin, the Don's top
scorers.
