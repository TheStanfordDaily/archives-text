# The
						Guest Greek is Back. . .

### 
The Greek is back! After a one
year hiatus, The Daily's Gteek of
the Week will feature picks by Daily
sports writers and editors on 10 of
the top collegiate games in this
space every Friday.
Joining them this week is Guest
Greek Mark Zeigler. A staff writer
for the San Diego Union, Zeigler
covered Stanford football in 1983
and 1984. He won the 1983 Greek
competition with a 76 percent suc
cess rate.
"I'm too vanilla tonight â€” I'm not
in my chocolate strudel mood,"
Zeigler said when notified of his
honor. His top picks are San Diego
State over Brigham Young and
Stanford over UCLA, both upset
specials and both "because I'm a
homer."
