# Irvine, UCLA Raid Farm
## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff writer 
The Stanford water polo team won't be taking it easy
this weekend when it plays UC-Irvine and UCLA. Not
only will the Cardinal, 11-2, be playing the team that
has caused it more trouble over the years than any
other team, but it will also be playing the No. 2 team in
the nation.
Stanford, currently ranked third in the country, will
play Irvine, 8-4, today at 3 p.m. and will face No. 2
UCLA, 11-2, tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. Both matches
will be held in DeGuerre Pool.
"Over the years, Irvine has given us more trouble
than any other team," Coach Dante Dettamanti said.
"Irvine always has the potential to present problems
for us, especially with the talents of their two-meter
man, Jeff Cambell."
Cambell, a U.S. National team member, is consid
ered by many to be the top two-meter player in the col
lege sport.

"Cambell is a very aggressive player and will work for
every shot," Dettamanti said. "His forte is scoring out
of the hole, so we will be putting most of our efforts on
keeping down his scoring."
In contrast to Irvine, UCLA presents a multi-faceted
offense with a great deal of depth.
"UCLA will be our first Pacific-10 opponent of the
season, so that match is certainly the more important
match of the weekend," Dettamanti said. "It should
also be the more difficult, although it's really too early
to say. UCLA is a very mobile team and you really
have to keep an eye on them."
The Bruins are led by an evenly balanced contingent
of players. Three members of the Brazilian Olympic
team head the Bruins roster, but talented players like
Tommy Martinez and Monty Yort cannot be over
looked.
"UCLA doesn't have one or two key players.
Rather, they have a very evenly-talented starting
lineup," Dettamanti said. "The Bruins shoot the ball
alot and play in a very unorthodox manner, so we will
be 'on our toes' the entire match."
