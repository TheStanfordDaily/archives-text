The Cardinal cross country
teams travel to Berkeley to
morrow for the Cal/Nike Invi
tational. However, because
the Cardinal's A-team is still
breathing heavily from last

shoulder the trail dusting
duties this weekend.
"We came out of last
weekend kind of banged up

Johnson said, "so we are
going to save ourselves for
Wisconsin." Next week the
Card teams travel to
Madison. Wis.
