Khadafy Meets With Gorbachev
MOSCOW — The Kremlin gave a warm welcome yesterday to
Col. Moammar Khadafy, and the Libyan strongman held talks with
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev on the Iran-Iraq war, the Middle
East and Africa.
The Soviet Union, chief arms supplier to Libya, was reported to
be very likely to sign a treaty of friendship during Khadafy's visit that
could increase the flow of arms to the North African regime.
Gorbachev and Khadafy exchanged views "in an atmosphere of
friendship and mutual understanding," according to TASS, the official
news agency.
Moscow has one major difference with Khadafy. While the Soviet
Union has adopted a policy of neutrality in the war between Iran and
Iraq, Khadafy has sent some Soviet arms to Iran, reportedly anger
ing the Kremlin.
Khadafy, who is making his first visit to Moscow since 1981, also
came here in 1976 and 1981. He has close ties with the Soviet lead
ership, but their policies frequently conflict.
Gorbachev, for example, expressed the Soviet view last week
that Israel has a right to exist within secure frontiers, a view that is
not accepted by Khadafy and other hard-line Arab leaders.
The United States has accused Khadafy of promoting terrorism by
training guerrillas and supporting subversive movements in Western
countries.
Rebels Attack Salvadoran Base
LA UNION, El Salvador — Rebel forces mounted a bloody assault
on the Salvadoran army's main training base here yesterday, killing
or wounding more than 100 government soldiers in the strongest
guerrilla attack in nearly a year.
Five U.S. advisers assigned to the U.S.-constructed base were
present during the predawn attack but none was killed or wounded,
the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador reported.
The Salvadoran base commander, Lt. Col. Joaquin Cerna Flores,
said the U.S. soldiers looked to their defense in their small
headquarters but did not fire weapons or participate in the two-hour
battle to repel the attack.
The assault, in which Cerna said more than 300 rebel commandos
took part, marked a sharp departure from the pattern of El Sal
vador's civil war for the last 18 months, in which rebel forces gener
ally have been held to small-unit ambushes and have avoided directly
confronting the army.
It was the deadliest clash since guerrillas ambushed government
soldiers at El Salto southeast of the capital last December. Perhaps
more important, it represented a significant psychological blow to
the Salvadoran army at a time when officers have begun to say they
are defeating the guerrillas.
Col. James Steele, commander of the U.S. Military Group in El
Salvador, flew here to inspect the damage and confer with U.S. ad
visers early yesterday morning. The rebel communique indicated
that the U.S. advisers were particular targets in the attack.
Peru Assails IMF Policies
SEOUL, Sourth Korea — Peru slammed the policies of the Inter
national Monetary Fund as a throwback to colonialism yesterday at
the IMF conference here.
Peruvian Prime Minister Luis Alva Castro, speaking to delegates
from 149 nations, demanded a conference to create a new interna
tional economic order. He charged that after the collapse of the Bret
ton Woods exchange rate system, there was no longer justification
for the IMF's existence.
The IMF followed policies comparable to those of the colonial
powers of old, Alva said. Peru would prefer to negotiate directly with
the governments of creditor nations than deal with the IMF. Peru
owes $14 billion to other countries.
In another forum of the IMF and World Bank Conference, which
runs until today, World Bank Vice President Anne Krueger said
there was fresh evidence of a collapse in commodity prices, likely to
badly hurt developing countries' foreign exchange earnings.
Krueger said the slowdown in export revenues was dramatic.
After developing countries increased their exports 17 percent in
1984, the first six months of 1985 saw only a one percent increase
over the same months of the previous year.
Declining income meant debtor countries had less foreign ex
change to repay a Third World debt burden that will total $865 billion
at the end of this year.
ANC Urges Attacks on Whites
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — The African National
Congress, the main guerrilla group fighting South Africa's minority
white regime, is calling upon the nation's 25 million blacks to take
their fight against apartheid into white areas and to attack police and
soldiers in their homes.
The congress' Radio Freedom, in broadcasts from Ethiopia this
week, called for black attacks on white residential neighborhoods and
on white resorts during the coming holiday season in what it said
should be a major escalation in the fight against apartheid.
The radio also urged blacks to arm themselves with guns and
other weapons seized from whites in preparation for those assaults.
Gangs of youths should attack patrolling police and soldiers to get
their weapons, the broadcast said, and domestic servants should
steal their employers' guns.
Four more blacks, including a three-week-old baby, were killed
near Durban in South Africa's continuing civil unrest, police reported
yesterday. Three appeared to be victims of the fierce feud between
members of the United Democratic Front and supporters of Zulu
Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi. The fourth victim was killed by
police gunfire after driving through a roadblock, according to police
headquarters in Pretoria.
In Cape Town, police fought running battles through most of yes
terday with black and Colored (mixed-race) youths who pelted cars
and trucks with stones, threw firebombs at buses, attacked stores,
banks and police posts with rocks.
Although whites are now being caught up in the continuing civil un
rest as targets of stone-throwing and occasional firebombs, only five
have died in the past 13 months, compared with more than 750
blacks, Indians and Coloreds, most of them killed by security forces.
All four victims of the unrest yesterday were killed in Durban, the
scene of bitter fighting between members of the United Democratic
Front, widely seen as voice of the African National Congress inside
the country, and supporters of the Zulu leader, Chief Buthelezi, who
has challenged the congress for the overall leadership of South
Africa's blacks.
Police said that the baby and a woman were killed in firebomb at
tacks on two houses of United Democratic Front members in Um
lazi, outside Durban, early Thursday.
