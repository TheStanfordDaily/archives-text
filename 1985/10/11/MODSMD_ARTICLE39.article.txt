# U.S. Seizes Hijackers

### 
WASHINGTON â€” In a stunning turn of
events in the night skies over the Mediterranean
late yesterday, U.S. Navy F-14 fighters inter
cepted an Egyptian airliner carrying the four Pal
estinian terrorists who hijacked an Italian cruise
liner and murdered an elderly American tourist,
and then forced the plane to fly to a U.S. naval
base in Sicily, the White House announced.
There, the terrorists were surrounded by a
combined force of U.S. and Italian troops and
taken into custody by Italian authorities for trial
in Italy or possible extradition to the United
States.
"This action affirms our determination to see
that terrorists are apprehended, prosecuted and
punished," White House spokesman Larry
Speakes declared in releasing details of the dra
matic episode.
"This operation was conducted without firing a
shot," he noted, adding that President Reagan,
who had approved the bold maneuver step by
step throughout the day yesterday, was
"extremely pleased with the successful mis
sion."

"We have been assured by the government of
Italy that the terrorists will be subject to full due
process of law," Speakes said. "For our part, we
intend to pursue prompt extradition to the
United States of those involved in the crime."
While there were indications in Rome that the
Italian government may decide to prosecute the
hijackers itself, Department of Justice officials
said that the United States would rely on a
recently passed federal law against taking U.S.
citizens hostage in seeking extradition of the four
Palestinian terrorists.
The terrorists, thought to be from a radical
splinter group of the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization called the Palestine Liberation Front,
seized the liner Achille Lauro off the coast of
Alexandria, Egypt, Monday, murdered retired
New York businessman Leon Klinghoffer, 69,
and dumped his body into the sea before
negotiating a surrender to Egyptian authorities
outside Port Said Wednesday.
Speakes said that the Administration, surmis
ing that the terrorists might attempt to leave
Egypt by air, began laying contingency plans for

a possible interception and gained approval to act
from Reagan during a presidential speaking trip
to Chicago yesterday.
Using the United States' extensive electronic
and other intelligence capabilities in the Mediter
ranean, the White House learned that the hijack
ers left A 1 Maza airport outside Cairo at 4:15
p.m. EDT aboard the Egyptian chartered jet.
The U.S. 6th Fleet then scrambled four F-14s
from the aircraft carrier Saratoga, along with an
aerial tanker and other support planes, to inter
cept it in international airspace above the eastern
Mediterranean.
A White House source said that the airliner
had filed a flight plan for Algiers, but had changed
the route to arrive instead at Tunis, Tunisia,
where the PLO maintains its headquarters.
Administration officials said that the plane was
refused permission to land in both Tunis and
Athens, Greece.
Speakes said that contingency plans had been
made in case the Egyptian jet ignored orders to
land in Sicily, but he refused to discuss what the
F-14 pilots would have been ordered to do.
