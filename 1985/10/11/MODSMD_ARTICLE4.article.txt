## FEATURES

Flo Mo hashers may pack a mean
ice cream cone, and Wilbur's fresh
baked breads have probably risen
their way into your heart by now.
But home cooking — real
home cooking, with real home
cooks, too — is a way of life in
many of Stanford's Row houses,
where the food is good and the
company even better.
Jutka Kadas has been at Stanford
for nine years. This is her second
year at Lathrop House, one of the
houses associated with University
Food Service. A native of Hungary,
she came to Stanford able to speak
little English and with little experi
ence in food. In Hungary, she
taught music in high school and
worked in a television station.
Kadas is proficient in many differ
ent cuisines, as are many of the
chefs along the Row. She cooks
French, American, Mexican and
Chinese dishes, among others. Her
favorite cuisine, though, is Hun
garian.
She praises the University Food
Service for allowing her indepen

dence in trying out new dishes.
"They are not cheap," she says
of University Food Service, which
she said has provided the ingredi
ents she wanted to try new recipes.
More than the independence,
Kadas says she appreciates the
close contact she has with stu
dents.
She says she views her role as
one of a housemother. She enjoys
talking, yelling and joking with the
students. Likewise, the students
enjoy having her there.
At a lunch held early in the year
for last year's residents, 80 percent
of the residents returned to see
her.
Durand residents are also share
in the culinary benefits of life on the
Row. House chef Agnes Anderson,
a native of Norway, specializes in
Swedish meatballs and desserts,
especially banana bread and
cheesecake.
The praise for Agnes' food
knows no bounds. "The food is way
better than anywhere else on
campus," says one former resident.

Rino Laneve, chef at La Casa

family feeling with the residents
where she works.

year, he was a chef in Italy. He says
the students here are "lovely."

makes a special omelette with ham,
mushrooms, tomatoes and two
types of cheese, a combination
that's impossible to beat."
The American Studies House dif
fers in two ways from Lathrop and
Durand. The house operates inde
pendently of University Food Ser
vice, and employs two chefs.
Jim West, a cook in his second
year at the house, worked previ
ously at fraternities for 30 years.
West cooks "whatever the stu
dents want," but his specialties are
Italian, French, African and espe

and fresh soups and sauces. He

makes everything from scratch.
"That's the name of the game," he
says.
The other chef is Juthica Stangl,
a former psychologist. She runs a
catering service, and her specialties
are Indian and Asian food.
Dave Mathewson, a house resi
dent and kitchen manager, claims
the food at Am Stud is "the best on
campus.'
He says he appreciates the vari
ety of fresh food available, and en
joys the open kitchen. Mostly,
however, he likes the homey atmos

the freedom of the house, where he

many different things.
His specialty is Chinese food,
which he cooks once a week.
Boat says the students here are
"a real nice group."
"It's a family feeling," he adds.
"It's a great atmosphere."
"He's part of the house, part of
