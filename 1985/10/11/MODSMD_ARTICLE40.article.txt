# Filmmaker Orson Welles Dies

HOLLYWOOD — Orson Welles,
the theatrical genius who panicked
the nation with his radio tale of a
Martian invasion and later created
the classic film "Citizen Kane," was
found dead yesterday in his Holly
wood home. He was 70.
Welles, apparently the victim of
cardiac failure, died in the upstairs
bedroom of the house in the heart
of Hollywood. Los Angeles police
said that Welles' body, clad in a
bathrobe, was found by his chauf
feur at 10:30 a.m.
Friends who had dined with him
Wednesday in a Los Angeles res
taurant said Welles looked pale and
gaunt, but seemed cheerful and vi
tal.
Welles, as huge in physical size

as in talent, was under treatment
for a heart condition and diabetes.
Welles, best known as the star,
writer and producer of the
breakthrough motion picture
"Citizen Kane," had been a major
figure in the worlds of cinema,
theater and radio for nearly five
decades. He performed in, di
rected, produced and wrote or co
wrote some 60 full-length features
here and abroad during his long and
often stormy career.
Hailed by some critics as a genius
even before "Citizen Kane," which
was his first full-length movie, he
was characterized later by others
as a giant who failed to fulfill his the
promise of his youthful talents.
Despite his legendary ability as a
filmmaker, Welles had not been in

volved in a major Hollywood motion
picture since "Touch of Evil" in
1957.
For the past decade, he had
made what he called "grocery
money" by appearing in television
commercials — most notably the
Paul Masson wine spots in which he
made famous the phrase "We will
sell no wine before its time."
Born George Orson Welles on
May 15, 1915, in Kenosha, Wis., he
was the second son of wealthy par
ents. His father was an inventor
and manufacturer who came from a
rich Virginia family. His mother was
the former Beatrice Ives, who died
when Welles was 8 years old.
During Welles' later years, he
was honored again and again by the

film establishment: the Motion
Picture Academy, the American
Film Institute, the Directors Guild
of America, and at film festivals all
around the world.
"Now I'm just an old Christmas
tree, the roots of which have died,"
Welles said after receiving a special
Oscar in 1970. "They just come
along, and while the little needles
fall off me, replace them with
medallions."
Honored by the American Film
Institute in 1975 as the recipient of
the third annual Life Achievement
Award, Welles said:
"As a director, I pay myself out
of my acting jobs. I use my own
work to subsidize my work. In
other words, I'm crazy."
