Cancer Kills Brynner
Yul Brynner, who with shaved head and
regally haughty presence played and replayed
the starring role in "The King and I" for more
than 30 years, died early yesterday in a New
York Hospital. He was 65.
With him when he died at 1 a.m. EDT at the
New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center
was his wife, Kathy Lee, and his four children,
Josh Ellis, the actor's spokesman, said.
"He died of multiple complications that came
as a result of what was originally cancer," Ellis
said. "He faced death with a dignity and
strength that astounded his doctors. He fought
like a lion."
Though there were other Broadway and
movie roles for Brynner, it is doubtful that any
successful actor of his time had been so associ
ated with a single character as was Brynner
with the arrogant, bombastic King of Siam.
Born Taidje Khan on July 11, 1917, on the
island of Sakhalin off northern Japan, Brynner
was the son of a Mongolian mining engineer
and a gypsy mother who died at his birth. His
father had been born in Switzerland and later
secured Swiss citizenship and changed the
family name to Brynner.
Acting brought Brynner to America, touring
in a struggling Shakespearean troupe on col
lege campuses. He added English and some
Russian Oearned from other actors) to his col
lection of languages that included French,
Japanese and Hungarian while playing small
parts and driving the troupe's bus — all for $25
per week.

Brynner, a five-pack a day smoker, had
learned in 1983 that he had lung cancer. He
took radiation treatment and, in Brynner's
words, "the results were spectacular." Later,
Brynner journeyed to Hanover, West Ger
many, where he was treated by a controversial
cancer specialist who advocated carrot-based
vitamin treatments to prevent recurrence of
the disease.
By the time he opened on Broadway just
before Christmas 1984, Brynner could say the
disease was in remission. Indeed, in his later
years, he appeared amazingly robust,
routinely booming his magnificent voice out to
an audience of thousands without the need of
body microphones.
House Approves Cut
WASHINGTON — In a major protectionist
move, the House approved a bill yesterday to
curtail apparel and textile imports from 11
Asian nations and Brazil, but the margin of vic
tory indicated that congressional fervor over
trade issues may have peaked.
Despite strong opposition by President
Reagan, the measure passed on a vote of 262-
159. But sponsors of the legislation fell 28
votes short of the two thirds majority needed
to override an expected veto by Reagan.
The bill, originally sponsorsed by large
majorities in both the House and Senate, has
been the most popular expression of congres
sional anger over the surge of imported goods

into American markets. It was the first trade
measure to reach a floor vote in Congress this
year, and its fate has been regarded as the key
test of how far lawmakers are willing to go to
deter imports.
But more than two dozen of the original
backers of the bill switched sides when the
final vote was cast.
Clayton Yeutter, Reagan's special trade rep
resentative, said: "Today's House vote shows
that congressional enthusiasm for self
destructive protectionism is waning. The
growing recognition that these costs are
simply too high led to the defection" of many
House co-sponsors.
If the bill becomes law, textile imports
would be reduced by 35 percent, with major
cutbacks in shipments from China, Taiwan,
South Korea, Indonesia and Brazil.
The legislation now goes to the Senate,
where a majority of members have expressed
support for textile import restrictions. The
Senate version, which will bypass committees
and be offered as an amendment to a pending
measure on the Senate floor, is likely to ex
clude China from the list of affected countries.
Stocks Rise Slightly
NEW YORK — The stock market emerged
from a quiet, drifting session yesterday cling
ing to a small gain.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
1.23 points on Wednesday, rose another 1.35
to 1,328.07.
