Race for Mayor Begins
SAN DIEGO — The criminal conviction of
Mayor Roger Hedgecock triggered a political
free-for-all yesterday as Hedgecock's friends
and foes positioned themselves to take over
leadership of the nation's eighth-largest city.
"The city, at least the elected members of
this council, have not been the most open, pro
gressive group of individuals," said City Coun
cilman Mike Gotch, one of several council
members who wants to succeed Hedgecock.
"People are going to be maneuvering now like
you've never seen to get the front-runner po
sition, whatever that might be."
Unless he resigns, Hedgecock will be
ousted from office when he is sentenced Nov.
6 on 13 felony convictions, one of conspiracy
and 12 of perjury.

The council has 30 days from the time the
office is vacant to appoint a replacement mayor
or to call a special election. San Diego has non
partisan mayoral elections.
Fox Not Yet a Threat
LOS ANGELES — Rupert Murdoch's new
television network is already large enough to
produce high-quality shows but is likely to take
decades to become a full-fledged competitor to
the three majors, analysts said yesterday.
The key to Murdoch's success with the Fox
Television Network, which is scheduled to
begin operation late next year or early 1987, is
likely to be whether it can turn out popular
shows on a regular basis.
Murdoch, the New York-based media

magnate, unveiled his initial plans for the new
network Wednesday after months of specula
tion that it was in the works.
New Sickle Cell Test
EMERYVILLE — A new prenatal test tech
nique that detects sickle cell anemia in a frac
tion of the time of previous tests was an
nounced yesterday by the Cetus Corp.
The technique will be "broadly applicable" in
testing for many genetic and infectious
diseases, predicted Dr. Kay Noel, director of
diagnostic business for Cetus.
Sickle cell anemia is a disease afflicting ap
proximately 50,000 people in the United
States, most of them black or Mexican-
American.
