# Unique Plan Links University Clinic to HMO
## 
### LYNN MARCUS Senior staff writer 
Due to a "unique" arrangement between
the Stanford University Clinic and one of
the country's largest health maintenance
organizations (HMOs), hundreds of new
patients have come to the clinic, and many
more are expected.
A rise in the number of patients who
come to Stanford as a result of the agree
ment, signed one year ago by officials of the
clinic and Maxicare, is likely to continue this
fall as more employers begin offering Max
icare's plan to their employees, according
to Dr. Donald Tower, executive director of
the clinic.
. Maxicare, one of the five largest HMOs
in the country, contracts with health institu
tions in 14 states to provide medical
services on a set monthly payment system
rather than the fee-for-payment system
traditionally offered by health insurance
companies. This is the first time Maxicare
has contracted with an academic institution,
however, making it "one of the few organi
zations nationwide that is using a university
clinic for primary care," according to Phillip
Robbins, Maxicare's marketing director for
Northern California.
>"This is a unique relationship for an aca

demic medical center to be involved in,"
Tower said. He said that by entering into
this agreement Stanford has seized upon a
changing trend in health care financing —
the dramatic growth of HMOs over the past
decade — and made itself a likely trendset
ter for university medical centers. Harvard
and Washington Universities are among the
other leaders in arranging health plans with
HMOs. *

Stanford has seized
upon a changing trend
in health care financing.

Under the plan, Maxicare subscribers
have access to primary care and specialty
services at the clinic as well as outpatient
ancillary services and hospitalization at the
Stanford Hospital.
Already, Towers said, 350 new patients
who subscribe to Maxicare have come to
the clinic. He predicted that "major in
creases when employers have open enroll
ment (for health care plans) in the fall."

University employees will become eligi
ble for the health plan next month.
Maxicare has signed contracts with over
200 companies since it began operating in
Northern California less than two years
ago. They include Bechtel Power Corpora
tion, Crocker National Bank, Neiman
Marcus and Pacific Telephone.
One recent subscriber that is expected
to draw many patients to the Stanford Clinic
is Lockheed Missiles and Space Company,
Inc., which employs approximately 17,000
people in the Stanford area.
The University's 9,000 half- to full-time
employees will become eligible for the Max
icare plan next month under a contract that
becomes effective Jan. 1. Currently, Uni
versity employees are eligible for three
HMO plans and one fee-for-service plan, of
fered by Blue Cross. The Stanford Clinic,
with its 280 faculty physicians and sur
geons, is not an option under the three
other HMO plans.
Ginger Hummer, assistant director of pa
tient relations at the clinic, said that in addi
tion to the advantage of receiving care at
Stanford from a "primary care group that is
comprehensive in nature and provides
state-of-the-art health care," subscribers to
Maxicare who come to Stanford will be
relieved of the overwhelming amounts of
"paperwork and hassle for a little reim

bursement" that accompany traditional
health care plans. *
Under the agreement, the clinic receives
a set "capitation payment" from Maxicare
per subscriber regardless of how many
times the patient visits the doctor, and
patients only pay an additional $2 per visit.
"It's more of the idea of statistical
averaging," Hummer said. "If we see the
patient no times that month or maybe one

time that month, we've made money."
"We think this will allow us to compete in
the future for the HMO market as people
join HMOs and drop their coverage with
fee-for-service plans," Tower said, "and
that's what we think will happen. . . .We
want to be in a position to offer our services
as we have in the past."
Health care officials have predicted that
the number of Americans with pre-paid

health care plans will rise from nearly 17
million in 1984 to 40 million by 1990.
Towers declined ;o speculate on the
profits the Maxicare contract will bring the
clinic, but said, "I suppose we will (make
money) over time."
Both Stanford Medical Center and Max
icare officials stressed the mutual benefits
to be derived from the agreement because
of each party's strong reputation.
Hummer said the clinic is "really proud of
our agreement with Maxicare because it's
one of the largest and most successful
HMOs." She and Towers praised Max
icare's record for good management and
service.
Maxicare is also "very pleased" with the
agreement, Robbins said, adding, "It's
going to have dramatic implications on the
market place."
Clinic personnel plan to participate in the
campus health fair next month to promote
the Maxicare plan to University employees
and to hold their own fair at the Medical
Center Nov. 8. Hummer said she expects
prospective subscribers to be impressed by
the newly renovated Boswell Clinic, which
provides a "private and tranquil setting" for
health care. The renovation, at a cost of $2
million, is scheduled to be completed this
spring.

campus health fair next month to promote
the Maxicare plan to University employees
and to hold their own fair at the Medical
Center Nov. 8. Hummer said she expects
prospective subscribers to be impressed by
the newly renovated Boswell Clinic, which
provides a "private and tranquil setting" for
health care. The renovation, at a cost of $2
million, is scheduled to be completed this
spring.
Due to a "unique" arrangement between
the Stanford University Clinic and one of
the country's largest health maintenance
organizations (HMOs), hundreds of new
patients have come to the clinic, and many
more are expected.
A rise in the number of patients who
come to Stanford as a result of the agree
ment, signed one year ago by officials of the
clinic and Maxicare, is likely to continue this
fall as more employers begin offering Max
icare's plan to their employees, according
to Dr. Donald Tower, executive director of
the clinic.
. Maxicare, one of the five largest HMOs
in the country, contracts with health institu
tions in 14 states to provide medical
services on a set monthly payment system
rather than the fee-for-payment system
traditionally offered by health insurance
companies. This is the first time Maxicare
has contracted with an academic institution,
however, making it "one of the few organi
zations nationwide that is using a university
clinic for primary care," according to Phillip
Robbins, Maxicare's marketing director for
Northern California.
>"This is a unique relationship for an aca

demic medical center to be involved in,"
Tower said. He said that by entering into
this agreement Stanford has seized upon a
changing trend in health care financing —
the dramatic growth of HMOs over the past
decade — and made itself a likely trendset
ter for university medical centers. Harvard
and Washington Universities are among the
other leaders in arranging health plans with
HMOs. *

Stanford has seized

in health care financing.

Under the plan, Maxicare subscribers
have access to primary care and specialty
services at the clinic as well as outpatient
ancillary services and hospitalization at the
Stanford Hospital.
Already, Towers said, 350 new patients
who subscribe to Maxicare have come to
the clinic. He predicted that "major in
creases when employers have open enroll
ment (for health care plans) in the fall."

University employees will become eligi
ble for the health plan next month.
Maxicare has signed contracts with over
200 companies since it began operating in
Northern California less than two years
ago. They include Bechtel Power Corpora
tion, Crocker National Bank, Neiman
Marcus and Pacific Telephone.
One recent subscriber that is expected
to draw many patients to the Stanford Clinic
is Lockheed Missiles and Space Company,
Inc., which employs approximately 17,000
people in the Stanford area.
The University's 9,000 half- to full-time
employees will become eligible for the Max
icare plan next month under a contract that
becomes effective Jan. 1. Currently, Uni
versity employees are eligible for three
HMO plans and one fee-for-service plan, of
fered by Blue Cross. The Stanford Clinic,
with its 280 faculty physicians and sur
geons, is not an option under the three
other HMO plans.
Ginger Hummer, assistant director of pa
tient relations at the clinic, said that in addi
tion to the advantage of receiving care at
Stanford from a "primary care group that is
comprehensive in nature and provides
state-of-the-art health care," subscribers to
Maxicare who come to Stanford will be
relieved of the overwhelming amounts of
"paperwork and hassle for a little reim

bursement" that accompany traditional
health care plans. *
Under the agreement, the clinic receives
a set "capitation payment" from Maxicare
per subscriber regardless of how many
times the patient visits the doctor, and
patients only pay an additional $2 per visit.
"It's more of the idea of statistical
averaging," Hummer said. "If we see the
patient no times that month or maybe one

time that month, we've made money."
"We think this will allow us to compete in
the future for the HMO market as people
join HMOs and drop their coverage with
fee-for-service plans," Tower said, "and
that's what we think will happen. . . .We
want to be in a position to offer our services
as we have in the past."
Health care officials have predicted that
the number of Americans with pre-paid

health care plans will rise from nearly 17
million in 1984 to 40 million by 1990.
Towers declined ;o speculate on the
profits the Maxicare contract will bring the
clinic, but said, "I suppose we will (make
money) over time."
Both Stanford Medical Center and Max
icare officials stressed the mutual benefits
to be derived from the agreement because
of each party's strong reputation.
Hummer said the clinic is "really proud of
our agreement with Maxicare because it's
one of the largest and most successful
HMOs." She and Towers praised Max
icare's record for good management and
service.
Maxicare is also "very pleased" with the
agreement, Robbins said, adding, "It's
going to have dramatic implications on the
market place."
