The scene is a home football game: Two fresh
man RAs, old friends, bump into each other as they
frenetically scurry about Stanford Stadium just after
the opening of the gates. They look at each other
and shrug. "I guess we're not very good at this,"
they say and laugh.
Good at what? Why do these and other RAs,
joined by fraternity pledges and dorm representa
tives, rise at the crack of dawn, or even spend the
night in front of the stadium, to line up in front of the
student gate and charge up the stairs when it opens
at 11 a.m.?
It is the search for the perfect seats, of course. It
is an alternate form of competition that occurs in the
student section of Stanford Stadium on home game
Saturdays. And sometimes, it is more of a battle
than the game itself.
The winners of the seat search secure rows of
prime seats for,their dormmates, fraternity broth
ers or sorority sisters. Then they proceed to "save"
them.
The losers of the seat competition are at the
mercy of the "savers." These are the students who
are not affiliated with any large organized group,
who get to the stadium reasonably early, and see a
nf f>mntv seats. "Great," they think to them

selves, and go sit in the best seats they can find —
until they hear the admonition, "Sorry, these are
saved."
Then these students become wanderers, forced
to scour the stadium for seats. And they continually
meet the "these are saved" reply when they try to
sit down in what has been designated as Toyon,
Branner or Sigma Chi territory.
The seat game just doesn't seem fair to the
losers. A handful of people should not be permitted
to save hundreds of good seats. They should not
have such an easy time of turning away those who
wander into their saved rows in search of seats. Ac
cording to the Athletic Department, the seating in
the student section is on a first-come, first-serve
basis — one person to a seat. The "losers" of the
seat game should not be afraid to assert their rights
to a seat.
Be kind to the wanderers. Don't save an ex
cessive number of seats. An air of common courtesy
should prevail in the stands. After all, practically all
of the seats in the student section are good. So what
if your group can't save five rows on the 50 yard
line? The battle at a home football game should not
be in the stadium bleachers. It should be on the
field, where it belongs.
