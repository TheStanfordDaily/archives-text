University Unfair
During Appeal
The malicious personal gossip
disseminated by Stanford Univer
sity obscures — as it is intended to
— the fact that Stanford lacks a
credible reason for denying me the
doctorate I have earned (The
Daily, Oct. 2).
University President Donald
Kennedy, despite an investigation
lasting over 21 months, was unable
to sustain the original allegations of
illegal and unethical behavior
during the period of my field re
search in China in 1979-80.
Indeed, I was able to demonstrate
that the allegations, which included
illegal travel, collecting secret
documents and bribing officials,
were false.
The correct thing to do at this
point would have been to award
me the doctoral degree. Instead,
still under pressure from the
Chinese government, Kennedy
levied a new charge aginst me
under the guise of "candor." He
alleged that I had failed to properly
account for the purchase of a
camera, and used this clerical error
as the basis for rejecting my ap
peal. Is this illegal and unethical
activity in China? Is this sufficient
cause to ruin my scholarly career?
The impropriety of introducing
new allegations during the course
of an appellate procedure is, I
trust, evident to readers of The
Daily. One appeals to a higher
court to overturn a wrongful deci
sion of a lower body — not to have
new charges made against one.
What has happened is best

summed up by an ancient Chinese
saying from the Tso Chuan: "If
you desire to find someone guilty,
you need not fear a lack of
evidence."

The Daily editorial on
University-fraternity relations
(Oct. 7) brought up the serious
issue of Residential Education's
ambiguous policy toward fraterni
ties. However, the editorial failed
to address the most important
question concerning this relation
ship — namely, that the University
is being unfair to fraternities by
punishing them without first estab
lishing a clear set of guidelines
governing fraternal life.
People choose to live in fraterni
ties and are therefore subject to
special behavioral standards. The
notion of collective responsibility
as it applies to fraternities is a valid
one, but it is a standard which the
University must define clearly and
use fairly. The current policy used
by Res Ed is, as the editorial
pointed out, confusing.
The solution for the University,
as I see it, is to work more closely
with fraternities toward establish
ing a coherent, logical and fair
system of checks and balances.
The answer does not lie in threat
ening fraternities or in making
unreasonable demands.
