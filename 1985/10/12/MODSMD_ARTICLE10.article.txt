# Halftime Show
## The 						Band Alumni Return 
### 
Once again, the Band swarms onto the gridiron
stinking of sillyness. The Band is somewhat differ
ent today. No, we are still incomparable, but we will
be even more so by halftime. The Stanford Band
presents the One and Only Truly Incomparable
Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band
220 Band members, 50 Dollies.
But that is at halftime. Until then everyone will
have to be content with the present Band, as it
presents a look at "Things That Have Changed"
from a warped perspective that only it can manage.
So, the Star Spangled Banner hasn't changed.
Well, the Axe hasn't really changed either. You're
going to see them both anyway.
Since the '6os, the United States and Stanford
have seen many groups of people roll in and out.
Once there were Hippies, but now, we seem to be
infested with Yuppies. There really have been some
"Changes."
Today, the Hippies of yesterday are out of their
Volkswagen stage and into the plush luxury interiors

of Mercedes-Benz. That's some revolution. Song:
'Middle of the Road".
"Hell no, we won't go:" What a slogan. Stanford
was a seething hotbed of student protest once.
Where are the protesters now? "Workin' For a
Livin,' " no doubt.
Okay. The time has come to reveal the goods.
Here they are, the Stanford Band alumni.
Over 350 members strong, the Stanford Band of
old and present treats you to the "Alumni Band
Show."
First, the alumni obviously haven't been banned.
This is merely a rebus to the tune of "Uncle John's
(Alumni) Band."
What's a hat without a band? Certainly not a Band
Hat. "American Band."
"Why, isn't that a radio?" It certainly is. What
good is a radio without a current "Yellow River"?
Why, nothing, of course. \
Time for a cute little pun. This show has been an
"Alumni Brand" show. Hiss. I know. But it's "All
Right Now."
