# The
						1985 Dollies: Busy and Loving It
## 
### TOM GILLESPIE Staff writer 
On any given autumn Saturday afternoon in
Stanford Stadium, Cardinal fans may take a
break from watching the football game to
admire the dancing of five young women in
bright red dresses, moving to the sounds of
the Stanford Band. Their smiles never fade
as they perform their routines to perfection,
making each dance seem as natural as can be.
This five woman unit is known collectively,
of course, as "The Dollies." And despite the
apparent effortlessness of their dancing,
much hard work and many long hours go into
creating the product that Stanford fans enjoy
on Saturdays.
This year's Dollies are senior Laurie Elliott
and sophomores Arija Bareikis, Jeanine
Gaylord, Susan Inge and Anne O'Brien.
These girls were chosen from over 50 who
tried out last winter quarter. The tryouts
spanned three weeks and included three
cuts. After the 10 finalists were interviewed
by the Band, the selections were made.
Each year, only five traditional routines, in
cluding "Come Join The Band," "The William
Tell Overture" and "All Right Now," are
passed down to the new Dollies. Because
every other routine had to be created, the
Dollies had to return to school six weeks
early to begin devising new dances.
Over this six-week period, they practiced
six hours a day, seven days a week, ac
cumulating the 23 or so routines they now

have, although they note that this number is
"ever-climbing" as the Band continues to
churn out new songs.
Once the school year started, the Dollies
cut their practice time to three hours a day,
except of course on Saturdays, when the

entire day may be consumed by rehearsals,
game performances, and rallies afterwards.
With their incredibly hectic schedule, the
girls are forced to budget their free time
carefully, and they often have to make

choices between other activities they are
used to taking part in. "You really have to
make yourself sit down and study to keep
from falling behind. You have to construct
your social life carefully, because you don't
have all the free time you had before," Inge
said.
However, if all this comes off sounding like
a job, don't be fooled. All five girls love what
they are doing. As Bareikis said, "I've never
had more fun than the time I've spent being a
Dollie."
The Dollies consider themselves Band
members without instruments. "When you're
a Dollie, you're not out there just represent
ing yourself," O'Brien said. "You're a part of
the Band you perform as a unit."
As part of this unit, they travel to all games
and rallies with the Band, and their schedule
may include performing for anything from
alumni parties to store openings to baseball
games.
When asked to choose what kind of gather
ings they most enjoy dancing for, the girls
agreed that any event where Stanford stu
dents or alumni are present is special.
"Anyone connected with Stanford under
stands the Band better and can enjoy our
music and dancing much more," Bareikis
said.
Gaylord and Elliott both prefer rallies to
the impersonal setting of a stadium. "In a
stadium, you're smiling up to a sea of faces,"
Gaylord said. "I like rallies, where you can
make eye contact with the people."

Practice makes perfect. Six weeks before school began, the Dollies logged six
hours every day preparing the more than 20 dance routinues that will be performed
during the 'B5-86 season. The Dollies, masquerading in plain clothes,
