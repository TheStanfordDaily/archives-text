# Training Table: Where The Biggest Boys Eat
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Editorial Staff 
Cardinal freshman nose guard
Buck Roggeman, wearing a Kansas
City Chiefs T-shirt, sauntered into
the Okada dining room, prepared to
assault the many edibles piled on
his tray.
"Are you a Chiefs fan?" asked
someone at the table.
"A cheese fan?" returned Rog
geman, incredulously.
"No, a Chiefs fan," repeated the
inquirer.
Roggeman nodded, somewhat
embarrassed, and said with a laugh,
"Basically, I like my dairy prod
ucts."
Roggeman likes a lot of other
foods, too. That night, he
consumed one steak, a red snapper
fillet, a breast of chicken, a baked
potato and two desserts while
quaffing down approximately 40
ounces of beverages two milks
and two carbonated drinks,
presumably not diet.
It's called training table. A pot
pourri of proteins. A cornucopia of
carbohydrates. And it's all un
limited.
Large quanities for large people
is essentially the theme. Debbie
Derana, manager of Wilbur Food

Services, estimates on a given
chicken entree night, the average
football player will consume half a
chicken, whereas the average stu
dent will set aside the fork at one
quarter.
"They do eat heavier," acknowl
edged Derana, "particularly with
the carbohydrates potatoes,
pasta, bread."
According to Derana, the 45
players corralled at the training
table put down about 60 pounds of
potatoes per night, a statistic that
has Idaho reaching for more hoes.
Derana also stressed the banana
intake, claiming that every evening
about a case of bananas fall prey to
the notorious football consumption
club.
Does anything survive? Exactly
why is Derana's office the furthest
from the Okada dining room?
Fortunately, for the food service
folks involved, some of the "heavy
eaters" rummage through frater
nity pastures, namely the Delta Tau
Delta House.
The training table 45, all of whom
offer their eating adroitness on a
voluntary basis, are mostly from
resident dorms the primary rea
son why most flee to this advanced
eatery.
Though the actual dorm and
training table food differ not in

quality, there dpes, indeed, exist a
keen disimilarity. It falls under the
aforementioned category of limit.
"I remenber trying to get some
more veal at Flo Mo," said nose
guard Eric Volta. "They wouldn't
let me have anymore. What can I
say. I could only have seconds on
the potatoes. It was frustrating."
Roggeman had similiar tastebud
entanglements at dorm cafeterias.
"They give you two little pancakes
when you want six.
"You just have to make the three
little trips," rationalized Roggeman.
And while Roggeman keeps in
shape by running back for more,
other legendary Cardinal eaters
stay more sedentary, relying
primarily on the initial onslaught.
At the training table, a few
names such as offensive linemen
John Barns, John Mahoney and
Robbie Coffin consistently arise
when considering legends of the
plate.
"Everyone eats a lot around
here," said Volta, who narrowed
his typical meal to a couple of
enchiladas, some roast beef and
chicken. "But the offensive linemen
eat the most by far."
Dark horses like wide receiver
Spencer Cotten, a mere 5-11, 175
pounds, also earned praise for ap
petite prowess. Cotten, it seems,

has the uncanny ability to eat great
quanities and not show it.
It's rare, though. Most hard-core
training tablers do sport the affects
of prolonged grazing in terms of
sheer size, bulk and body cushion.
These guys don't run fly patterns
and they don't eat the proverbial
quiche.
Instead, they may settle for the
after dinner ice cream, which is

served everyday to tilt the night's
grand caloric scale to around 2,000.
Potatoes, bread and butter,
chocolate eclairs, fudge sundaes.
The question arises: Are football
players at the training table con
scious of what they eat? .
Just ask Volta.
"I make it a point not to make a
pig out of myself."

The football training table, located in Okada, gives full reign to
the rather healthy appetites of Stanford football players. At
training table, players have many choices and are able to avoid
the dreaded "No Seconds" limits imposed at many dorms.
