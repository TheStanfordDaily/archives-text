# Homer Smith: Main Pilot of Air Donahue
## Graduate of Princeton, Stanford and Harvard leads UCLA attack 
### TOM SENF Editorial Staff 
If a man has a B.A. in economics
from Princeton, an MBA from Stan
ford and an M.A. in Theological
Studies from Harvard, what would
a list of his possible occupations in
clude?
The list might be fairly exten
sive, but football coach would un
doubtedly not be on it.
Yet that is the educational back
ground of UCLA Offensive Coord
inator Homer Smith, who brings a
potent, well-balanced Bruin offense
to Stanford Stadium today.
The explosive UCLA passing at
tack is known as "Air Donahue,"
after UCLA Coach Terry Donahue.
But Smith, as quarterback and wide
receiver coach as well as offensive
coordinator, is as responsible as
anyone for the Bruins' aerial suc
cess. In the last three seasons,
UCLA has completed 63 percent of
its passes for 8,177 yards and 51
touchdowns.
But "Air Smith" just doesn't
seem to cut it as a nickname. "Air
Homer" is a little better, but it
sounds more like a Greek airline or
the Cleveland Indians' pitching staff
than an offense.
Nevertheless, Smith's results
speak for themselves. Also, he
hasn't had a John Elway or a John
Paye to work with. The Bruins
have had a different starting quar
terback in each of the past four
seasons.
In 1982, Tom Ramsey led the na
tion in passing efficiency while
leading the Bruins to a Rose Bowl
win over Michigan. The following
year, it was Rick Neuheisel's turn
to take his team to the Rose Bowl
title with a 45-9 rout of Illinois. For
the season, UCLA completed 69
percent of its passes, the second
highest figure in NCAA history.
Last season, Steve Bono was at
the helm, guiding the Bruins to
their third consecutive New Year's

Day win, a 39-37 victory over
Miami in the Fiesta Bowl. Now
David Norrie runs the show, and it
looks like UCLA may extend its
Jan. 1 engagement. Against Arizona
State last week, Norrie threw for
215 yards and two touchdowns,
earning Pacific 10 Conference Of
fensive Player-of-the-Week honors.
By no coincidence, all four
players were seniors. Experience
and repetitions are keys to success
in the Smith system. "Athletic tal
ent, if there is any, only develops if
things are done over and over,"
Smith said. "Our quarterbacks have
been here four and sometimes five
years."
According to Smith, player de
velopment is what makes good
coaches. "The key is to make your
athletes better than their athletes,"
he said. "Coaches don't outsmart
other coaches."
Balance is also essential to a suc
cessful offense, and the Bruins
have it. As another man who knows
a little something about moving the
ball, Stanford Coach Jack Elway,
said, "They have an excellent run
ning game and a good play-action
series. They can also drop back and
throw."
There is no doubt that Smith is
good at what he does. But the
questions remain: Why is he doing
it? How did a man with his educa
tion become a football coach?
After starring as a fullback at
Princeton, Smith entered the
Army. During his service, he
decided to attend graduate school
after his discharge. "I had always
wanted to be a football coach," he
said. "But I had decided to go to
business school and was advised to
go ahead with that before coach
ing."
Luckily, he was able to do both
'on the Farm. While attending Stan
ford Business School, Smith was
named head frosh coach. After

The men who run Homer Smith's UCLA attack may change, but some things remain constant,
like explosive offense and New Year's Day bowl victories. This season, Steve Bono (right), the
1984 starter, has passed the ball to David Norrie, who seems ready to continue the Bruins' January
Ist tradition.

The sight of an opposing runner loose in the Cardinal secondary has been a common one this
year, but the Stanford defense is determined not to let UCLA Offensive Coordinator Homer
Smith's troops get away today. When the teams played last season, the Cardinal held the Bruins
to 66 rushing yards in a 23-21 upset.
