# Baty the Unsung Hero of Potent Cardinal Offense
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff writer 
As the Stanford offense has con
sistently moved the football from
goal line to goal line against oppos
ing defenses during the 1985
season, Cardinal quarterback John
Paye and running back Brad Muster
have grabbed much of the credit.
And understandably so.
Paye currently leads the nation in
total offense and is conducting a
personal assault on the offensive
portion of the Stanford record
book. Muster leads the NCAA in
receptions, is third in scoring and
ninth in all-purpose running.
Yet no offense as effective as
Stanford's functions solely on the

performance of two players, and
one Cardinal who has been over
shadowed by the achievements of
Paye and Muster has been tight end
Greg Baty.
Baty, a senior from Sparta, N.J.,
has been quietly having his best
season in a Cardinal uniform. Some
might refer to him as the unsung
hero.
"Greg right now is our best
receiver," Tight End Coach Otto
Kofler said. "He's having a great
year."
Through four games this season,
Baty has surpassed his career to
tals in almost every category. He
has caught 24 passes, equaling his
combined total for the entire 1983

and 1984 seasons. His three touch
downs and 284 yards receiving
compare to previous career statis
tics of one touchdown and 242
yards. And last Saturday at San
Diego State, Baty caught a career
high 10 passes.
Why has there been such a dra
matic turnabout for a player who
started nine games last season, but
was not nearly as involved in the of
fensive scheme as he has been this
season?
"He has really improved on his
route reading and his ability to get
open," Kofler said.
"It's a combination of a lot of
things," Baty said. "I'm much more
confident in the system. I wasn't
sure of the whole concept last year
with the new coaching staff. Also,
John Paye has more confidence in
yy
me.
Cardinal Coach Jack Elway has
used running backs to bring plays to
the huddle more frequently than
tight ends this season. Thus Baty
has not rotated with other tight
ends as much as last year and has
consequently gotten more playing
time. Both Baty and Kofler indi
cated that this increased playing
time has also added to Baty's pro
ductivity and effectiveness.
"I'm playing all of the time now,"
Baty said. "It's good because you
get in the flow of the game."
Other factors have aided Baty in
becoming an integral part of the
Cardinal offense. Paye who
missed most of the 1984 season
due to a hand injury is back in
command this season, meaning a
revitalized Cardinal passing game.
"We're throwing the ball much
more," Kofler said.
And at 6-6, 240 pounds, Baty is a
target that most quarterbacks
would kill for. If you can't spot him
downfield, you'd better see an op
tometrist. Not only can Baty catch
the ball, he can put his head down

and punish opposing defenders at
tempting to tackle him.
Yet, if you were to look back at
Baty's career at Sparta High
School, you would wonder how he
ever refined his talents as a
receiver. Though Sparta , won the
Sussex County championship
during Baty's senior year, they
were overwhelmingly a running
team. Baty earned High School All-
America honors primarily as a
blocker.
"My senior year my team threw
the ball 20 times," Baty said. "So I
came out of high school as a
blocker."
Coming to Stanford a program
renowned for years for its passing
offenses Baty knew that he
would be counted on for his receiv
ing abilities. He worked dilligently
to improve his receiving skills and
his ability to run with the ball after a
reception.
"Now the coaches think that I'm
a better receiver (than blocker),"
Baty said.
"You'd look at him physically and
think he'd be a better blocker (than

receiver), but he runs great
routes," Kofler said. "He's good at
both."
Baty said that his blocking skills
are still very important to him. "I
don't know that I've ignored block
ing," he said. "When you throw a
good block and see the back run
ning 15 yards downfield, that's a
good feeling."
Football was not the only sport
that Baty excelled at during high
school. He was an all-county per
former in basketball and has enter
tained thoughts of trying out for the
Cardinal basketball squad this up
coming season.
"This summer I played in a
league with the (Stanford) players,"
Baty said. "I really miss the sport.
I'm considering playing this year."
During the present football
season, the Cardinal offense has
averaged over 31 points per game,
but the defense has allowed over 32
points per game. Consequently, the
team is 1-3.

Most of the headlines have gone to quarterback John Paye and
fullback Brad Muster, but senior tight end Greg Baty has been
instrumental to the success of the Stanford offense this year.
His 24 receptions are fifth in the Pac-10.

At 6-6, 240 pounds, Greg Baty should arouse the interest of
more than a few NFL scouts. "He'll have to work a lot, but, yeah,
I think he is pro caliber," said Tight End Coach Otto Kofler.
However, Baty said that the of
fense does not concern itself with
how many points the defense gives
up. "We don't feel any pressure,"
he said. "We feel, as an offense,
that the only people that can stop us
are ourselves. We're ranked third
(in total offense), but that doesn't
matter if we're 1-3. We feel we
should score every time."
Baty will attempt to keep his
football skills sharp following the
season in order to test them at NFL
or USFL training camps next year.
"I want to give it a shot," he said.
"Until recently I didn't know what
my chances were. I've always had
this potential. From what people
are telling me, the pro scouts are
happy with me."
Kofler likes Baty's chances.
"He's going to have to work a lot,
but, yeah, I think he is pro caliber."
If work is all that he needs, you
can expect to see Baty around for
many years to come. The others
will have to just have to share the
spotlight.
