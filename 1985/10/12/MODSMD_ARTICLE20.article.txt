# Sherrard Walks on and Into the Record Book
## UCLA's all-time leading receiver began without a scholarship 
### PABLO MORALES Staff sportswriter 
A big-time college recruit is never wanting in atten
tion. Recruiting letters and phone calls bombard his
home. The top coaches in the nation rap on his front
door, each bringing tidings of full scholarships to their
college shangrilas.
Some, a bit more enthusiastic, bring a host of added
incentives as well, goodies that would make any NCAA
Rules Committee member salivate. In short, blue chip
recruits are offered the world.
UCLA senior Mike Sherrard was offered Chico.
After catching a modest total of 15 passes during his
senior season at Chico High, a school not known for
sporting football powerhouses, Sherrard didn't expect
the world at his doorstep, and he didn't get it.
However, he did get an offer to play for Chico State,
another school not known for sporting football power
houses. Because Chico didn't give out athletic scholar
ships and because Chico already was his doorstep, he
decided he had nothing to gain by sticking around. So
he decided to expand his horizons and give UCLA a
try.
Because he didn't receive a letter from any school,
much less UCLA, Sherrard knew he had to tread a tor
tuous path just to make some big-time coaches ac
knowledge his existence. If acknowledged, he would
then have one, or perhaps two, chances to prove him
self worthy against highly-touted recruits. He would
have to join the insecure ranks of the walk-on.
Walk-ons, refugees from obscure high school pro
grams or players who still feel they have some un
tapped ability waiting to surface, comprise a minute
portion of football programs nationwide.
"There was never any doJff that I was going to try
out," said Sherrard. "I did imagine a college life without

football only because I thought there might not be a
good chance for me to make the team; I loved the sport
too much."
The Bruins are ever grateful that he did.
A starter since his sophomore year, Sherrard has
amassed a total of 1,921 yards on 123 receptions,
making him UCLA's leading career receiver in both
categories. Only a fractured right clavicle suffered last
week against Arizona State prevents him from adding
to those totals today.
Offensive Coordinator Homer Smith remembers his
first encounter with Sherrard.
"The first time I saw Mike he was between two
girls, one on each arm. So he really didn't walk on; he
just sort of strolled on."
If nothing else, football was anything but a pleasant
stroll for Sherrard during his freshman year. Coach
Terry Donahue and his staff assigned Sherrard to the
scout team, a sort of UCLA "B" team, for most of
the season. It wasn't until the very end of the season
that he got an opportunity to practice with the varsity
squad.
The coaches must have liked what they saw because
he has started for the Bruins ever since.
Sherrard's story is perhaps a fairy tale for walk-on
annals, but behind the happy ending is a pervasive pes
simism concerning the true plight of walk-ons.
"It's undoubtedly tougher for a walk-on to make the
team than it is for recruited freshman," said Sherfard.
"He (a recruited athlete) is looked at first and is given
more chances to excel. A walk-on has to do more work
in order to get a chance to show his stuff, and that's
usually just one chance."
Coaches across the country should heed the exam
ple of Mike Sherrard, someone who brought a little of
Chico to UCLA's doorstep and made it very grateful
that he did.

During his stay at UCLA, wide receiver Mike Sherrard has made it a habit of eluding downfield
tacklers. An Ail-American candidate this season until an injury sidelined him, Sherrard began his
UCLA football career as a walk-on and has steadily moved himself into star status.

UCLA Head Coach Terry Donahue was also a walk-on for the
Bruins. According to place-kicker John Lee, Donahue played
"during the days when leather helmets were worn."
