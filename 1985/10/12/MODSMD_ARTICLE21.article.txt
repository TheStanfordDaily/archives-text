# Stanford's Walk-ons Beat All the Odds
## 
### 
Coming out high school, not
every talented football player
receives that call from the uni
versity coach. Some decide to
quit. Others may be relegated to
Team B on the I.M. field.
Then again, there are those
who decide to try out anyway for
the college varsity team. Free
safety Mark Hashimoto and
linebacker Jack Gilmete, both
seniors, are two such players for
the Stanford Cardinal.
Walk-ons their freshman year,
Hashimoto and Gilmete both
received football scholarships a
few years later. The road to the
scholarship, though, was any
thing but easy.
With most football programs,
the walk-ons supposedly have a
fair and equal shot at making the
team. But in reality, it is the gen
eral feeling that they don't. One
mistake at a crucial time means
first-string on the dorm team.

"I didn't really have any set
goals when I tried out," Has
himoto said. "I was just trying to
make the team follow the nat
ural progression from high
school to college."
At first, just wearing the uni
form is special enough, but
gradually, the itch to play inten
sifies. "It's disappointing not to
be playing," Gilmete said. 'When
you're not playing, you start
wondering why you even tried
out. I really respect the efforts
of walk-ons."
Entering the football program
virtually unknown leaves many
walk-ons out in the cold. As Has
himoto explained, most of the
recruited players have the ad
vantage of already knowing the
coaches through recruiting pro
cedures.
Eventually, the Stanford
coaches came to recognize the
names of the Gilmete and Hash
imoto. Currently, both start on
the Cardinal defense.
