# Card Fights To Break its Fall
## 
### TOM SENF Editorial Staff 
Thus far in 1985, both Stanford and UCLA
have had what could be called roller coaster
like seasons.
The Bruins began their ride at the top,
beating national champion Brigham Young on
the road 26-24. The victory snapped the
Cougars' 25-game winning streak.
After a slight dip against Tennessee,
where UCLA needed a late touchdown and
two-point conversion to forge a 26-26 tie, the
Bruins bounced back and trounced San Diego
State 34-16.
Then, as is their custom, the men from
Westwood dropped their Pacific 10 Confer
ence opener 21-14 to Washington.
But now UCLA is rolling smoothly, thanks
to a convincing 40-17 win over Arizona State.
By halftime, the Bruins were leading 27-7 and
had outgained the Sun Devils by 184 yards.
Like UCLA, Stanford was riding high at the
beginning of the season. After a 41-7 thrash
ing of San Jose State, some of the more opti
mistic Cardinal followers were talking bowl
bid. Now, a month later, Stanford is a team
that could easily be 1-7 by early November.
After today's game, the Cardinal's next three
opponents are USC, Arizona and Washington.
Stanford's slide began slowly, with excit
ing, well-played losses to Oregon and Texas.
In both games, the Cardinal moved the ball
offensively and was aggressive on defense,
but was done in by the big play.
Last week's game against San Diego State,
however, was anything but exciting or well
played on Stanford's part. Though it
moved the ball effectively again, the Cardinal
offense scored only one touchdown. The
defense, meanwhile, was buried under an av
alanche of draw plays, post patterns and
swing passes.

The Aztecs reached the Cardinal end zone
on five of their first six possessions en route
to a 41-22 triumph. Stanford Coach Jack El
way didn't have any complex explanations of
what happened.
"Obviously, we weren't ready to play
defensively," Elway said. "That's not some
thing you have to look at films to see."
When asked why his defense had played so
poorly, Elway said, "It was a lack of emotion
and a lack of being physical. I assume that we
come to play. Sometimes I'm wrong."
His players agreed. "Our technique is
there, but we gotta get the heart back," said
nose guard Eric Volta.
"I did feel there was a lack of intensity in all
phases of our game," added backup fullback
Brian Morris, who caught 10 passes after
replacing an injured Brad Muster. "San Diego
State got the momentum early, and it snow
balled from there."
According to Elway, a lack of execution can
be excused. A lack of intensity cannot. "I
don't care if you make mistakes, but, damn,
make 'em at full speed," he said.
If Stanford's defense doesn't improve
today, look for its 32.7 points-against average
to increase. Last week, the Bruin offense
scored 40 points against a defense that was
fourth best in the nation. Right now, Stan
ford's defense couldn't see the fourth best
defensive team with a telescope.
Although the UCLA attack seems to be in
high gear, the Cardinal is fortunate to be
taking it on now. UCLA is without the
services of two of its most talented players in
tailback Gaston Green, sidelined with a
sprained knee, and wide receiver Mike Sher
rard, who suffered a fractured right clavicle
against Arizona State.
"We've lost our two best offensive football
players in Mike Sherrard and Gaston Green,"
UCLA Coach Terry Donahue said. "Any time
you lose two players of that magnitude, it's
going to have an effect."

Without Green, the team's top rusher, and
Sherrard, the leading receiver in UCLA his
tory, Donahue has more of a ball-control
team. "(Now) we're a little more methodical,
a little less explosive, without those guys,"
he said. 'We don't have the big play."
But don't feel sorry for Donahue. The
Bruins still have plenty of firepower. Sher
rard's fill-in, Willie Anderson, has caught only
two passes, but he has turned them into 78
yards and two touchdowns. Also, running
backs Eric Ball, James Primus, Mel Farr and
Marcus Greenwood have all gained over 100
yards this season and all are averaging more
than four yards per carry.
"James Primus and Eric Ball have been ef
fective," Donahue said. "You have to play the
cards you're dealt."
The Cards Donahue will be playing this
week know what they will be up against.
"Obviously, UCLA is the best team we've
faced. They're a complete football team," El
way said.
Comparing the Bruins and the Aztecs,
Volta said, "They (UCLA) are bigger and a
lot more aggressive. So we're gonna have to
be more aggressive."
If this week's practices are any indication,
the Cardinal should be more aggressive
today. In an intrasquad scrimmage on Mon
day, six fights broke out between the
players.
The Bruin defense has also had some fights
on its hands this season. Most of the losing
ones have come in the secondary, where the
Bruins are last in the Pac-10, surrendering an
average of 280.4 aerial yards per game.
'We've given up a ton of yards passing,"
Donahue said. 'We have not had a dominant
pass rusher, so we've had to create pressure
by blitzing, which puts you in a lot of man
coverage."
In defense of the UCLA pass defense, the
Bruins have faced some outstanding quarter

backs, including BYU's Robbie Bosco, Ten
nessee's Tony Robinson and San Diego
State's Todd Santos. But things won't get
any easier this week, when the Bruins line up
against the best signal-caller in the Pac-10,
Stanford's John Paye.
'We can't play like John Paye," UCLA Of
fensive Coordinator Homer Smith said. "He's
just a fantastic player."
Calling Paye "fantastic" seems to be the
party line for the UCLA coaches, but in his
case, it's not just lip service. 'We tried to
recruit John," Donahue said. "He's a fantastic
player. He's got everything it takes, and his
statistics bear that out."
They certainly do. Paye is leading the na
tion in total offense with an average of 372
yards per game. His 361.5-yard passing
average leads the Pac-10 by over 100 yards.
Besides Paye, Donahue is worried about
the entire Cardinal offense, which leads the
conference in total offense, passing offense
and scoring average. "Stanford has one of the
most diversified attacks in this part of the
country and possibly the entire nation,"
Donahue said. "They put tremendous physi
cal and mental burdens on a football team.
You must play every conceivable formation."
The Cardinal will need to come up with a
few formations that get them into the end
zone today. Last week, the offense consis
tently drove down the field, only to stall and
settle for a field goal. 'We haven't scored
enough touchdowns," Morris said. 'We have
to stop trying to make an All-American out of
(kicker) David Sweeney."
As for the Stanford defense, no one was
making any predictions about the final score,
but as Elway said, "You can anticipate one
thing: We're gonna play physically, and we're
gonna play with emotion."
"I don't want to say we're gonna kick their
asses," Volta said. "But I will say that we're
going to be ready to play. It's definitely not
going to be another San Diego State."
For the sake of the Cardinal fans and the
CBS television audience, let's hope not.

"Fantastic" is what the UCLA coaches call Stanford quarterback John Paye,
and they seem to know what they are talking about. Paye leads the nation in
total offense and his 361.5 passing yard average leads the Pac-10 by over 100
yards per game.

"Our technique is there, but we gotta get the heart back," said Stanford nose
guard Eric Volta. The Cardinal defense, which had a poor outing last week
against San Diego State, will need both technique and heart to contain the
powerful UCLA offense.
