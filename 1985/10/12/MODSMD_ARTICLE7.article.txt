# Ranked 9th in Pac-10 pass defense
## Secondary Searches for New Intensity 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Senior staff writer 
"We've been lax," said corner
back Toi Cook.
"They've been soft," said Defen
sive Coordinator Dick Mannini.
"They've been terrible," say
hundreds of Cardinal fans.
Call it what you will: Stanford's
defense has allowed 124 points in
its last three games, and the sec
ondary has taken much of the blame
for the team's difficulties.
"We certainly deserve criticism,"
said free safety Mark Hashimoto.
'We know what we're supposed to
be doing, and we're capable of
doing it. We just don't seem to be
doing it."
But Hashimoto, Cook and cor
nerback Bruce Richardson, while
admitting that the secondary has
made some costly errors, say crit
ics blame them too often. They say
the fans don't see the weak pass
rush and the linebackers' poor pass
coverage on short-yardage plays.
'We'll take the most blame be
cause we're the most visible," said
Hashimoto.
Cook and Richardson note that in
several coverages, the linebackers
rather than the cornerbacks
are responsible for guarding against
the "digs," or short-yardage pass
plays. "Secondary is a misnomer,"

said Cook, who stresses that
defense is a team effort. "The sec
ondary should include the lineback
ers."
The secondary also criticizes the
team's pass rush. Hashimoto notes
that Stanford has only eight sacks in
four games this year. "It would be
nice to have more sacks or
'hurries,' " he said, explaining that
a forced bad pass is sometimes
even better than a sack several
yards behind the line of scrimmage.
Mannini, asked about the second
ary's mistakes this year, offered a
general response about the defen
sive team's lack of concentration
and aggressiveness in recent
weeks.
"The (defensive) problem starts
in front," Mannini said. 'We've been
playing soft in front there hasn't
been a lot of pressure and aggres
sive play. It works its way back.
They're all at fault.
'We know they're young," he
continued. 'We try to have pa
tience, but patience can only be
stretched so far."
Coach Jack Elway, primarily
Stanford's offensive coordinator,
reportedly has been spending time
with the defense this week, watch
ing them during practice and offer
ing critique a job usually consid
ered Mannini's.

Elway explains how the second
ary has been getting beaten: on the
big yardage plays, on the short
yardage plays and on everything
in-between.
"A lot of time we're playing a
three-deep zone and having the
deep man bite on the play-action
and having the guy run by him," El
way said. "Then there's the matter
of insecurity. You start thinking,

Well, I'm going to cushion him
more. I'm not going to let him beat
me deep.' Then you get beat on the
short and intermediate patterns."
The truth is that there have been
times this season when the second
ary has actually looked great. Cook
and strong safety Brad Humphreys
each have two interceptions; Has
himoto has one. Humphreys is the
team's third leading tackier, with

31, and Hashimoto, with 28, is
fourth.
But the players discuss a lack of
consistency that has plagued Card
inal defenses for years.
'We've just got to cut down on
mental mistakes," Richardson said.
'We have to be more aggres
sive," added Cook. "I have to be
more aggressive."

Richardson said the practices this
week have been intense and effec
tive. He calls the recent fights be
tween players "a sign of aggres
siveness, " not of frustration.
The defensive players agree that
they will need to play a very ag
gressive game what Hashimoto
calls "our best intense effort" to
contain UCLA.
Hashimoto said he has put the
team's poor past performances be

hind him as he gets up for today's
game.
"Coach Elway said you go
through a period of depression and
embarrassment after a loss, and
then you come out of it," he said.
'We don't go moping around with
our heads down."
The defense's morale appears
high, even though the team is com
ing off a particularly bad game
against San Diego State.
"I don't think we've lost our
spirit," said Cook. "The team will
be up for UCLA. We always get up
for the big games. It's the San
Diego States we have to worry
about getting up for."
Mannini has been experimenting
with different lineups in practice
this week, shifting Humphreys to
free safety and playing freshman
Sam Sutherland at strong safety.
Sutherland has been red-shirted so
far this year, and Mannini is hesitant
to use him.
"It all depends on whether we
feel he's ready," Mannini said Wed
nesday, adding that if Sutherland
plays against UCLA, he will be a
starter.
But Mannini most likely will not
call on Sutherland today.
Humphreys and Hashimoto are the
probable starters at the safety
spots, and Cook and Chris Young
are the likely starting cornerbacks.

I don't think we've lost our spirit. The
team will be up for UCLA.

ary has been getting beaten: on the
big yardage plays, on the short
yardage plays and on everything
in-between.
"A lot of time we're playing a
three-deep zone and having the
deep man bite on the play-action
and having the guy run by him," El
way said. "Then there's the matter
of insecurity. You start thinking,

Well, I'm going to cushion him
more. I'm not going to let him beat
me deep.' Then you get beat on the
short and intermediate patterns."
The truth is that there have been
times this season when the second
ary has actually looked great. Cook
and strong safety Brad Humphreys
each have two interceptions; Has
himoto has one. Humphreys is the
team's third leading tackier, with

31, and Hashimoto, with 28, is
fourth.
But the players discuss a lack of
consistency that has plagued Card
inal defenses for years.
'We've just got to cut down on
mental mistakes," Richardson said.
'We have to be more aggres
sive," added Cook. "I have to be
more aggressive."

Richardson said the practices this
week have been intense and effec
tive. He calls the recent fights be
tween players "a sign of aggres
siveness, " not of frustration.
The defensive players agree that
they will need to play a very ag
gressive game what Hashimoto
calls "our best intense effort" to
contain UCLA.
Hashimoto said he has put the
team's poor past performances be

hind him as he gets up for today's
game.
"Coach Elway said you go
through a period of depression and
embarrassment after a loss, and
then you come out of it," he said.
'We don't go moping around with
our heads down."
The defense's morale appears
high, even though the team is com
ing off a particularly bad game
against San Diego State.
"I don't think we've lost our
spirit," said Cook. "The team will
be up for UCLA. We always get up
for the big games. It's the San
Diego States we have to worry
about getting up for."
Mannini has been experimenting
with different lineups in practice
this week, shifting Humphreys to
free safety and playing freshman
Sam Sutherland at strong safety.
Sutherland has been red-shirted so
far this year, and Mannini is hesitant
to use him.
"It all depends on whether we
feel he's ready," Mannini said Wed
nesday, adding that if Sutherland
plays against UCLA, he will be a
starter.
But Mannini most likely will not
call on Sutherland today.
Humphreys and Hashimoto are the
probable starters at the safety
spots, and Cook and Chris Young
are the likely starting cornerbacks.

I don't think we've lost our spirit. The
team will be up for UCLA.

The Cardinal secondary has five interceptions this year, including two by Toi
Cook (44) and one by Mark Hashimoto (16), but those have been the bright
spots in a dim season thus far. Stanford is ninth in the Pac-10 in pass defense,

but the secondary is only partially to blame. The lack of a consistent pass rush
and the linebackers' difficulties in covering the short passes have contributed
to the defense's problems.
"We've been lax," said corner
back Toi Cook.
"They've been soft," said Defen
sive Coordinator Dick Mannini.
"They've been terrible," say
hundreds of Cardinal fans.
Call it what you will: Stanford's
defense has allowed 124 points in
its last three games, and the sec
ondary has taken much of the blame
for the team's difficulties.
"We certainly deserve criticism,"
said free safety Mark Hashimoto.
'We know what we're supposed to
be doing, and we're capable of
doing it. We just don't seem to be
doing it."
But Hashimoto, Cook and cor
nerback Bruce Richardson, while
admitting that the secondary has
made some costly errors, say crit
ics blame them too often. They say
the fans don't see the weak pass
rush and the linebackers' poor pass
coverage on short-yardage plays.
'We'll take the most blame be
cause we're the most visible," said
Hashimoto.
Cook and Richardson note that in
several coverages, the linebackers
rather than the cornerbacks
are responsible for guarding against
the "digs," or short-yardage pass
plays. "Secondary is a misnomer,"

said Cook, who stresses that
defense is a team effort. "The sec
ondary should include the lineback
ers."
The secondary also criticizes the
team's pass rush. Hashimoto notes
that Stanford has only eight sacks in
four games this year. "It would be
nice to have more sacks or
'hurries,' " he said, explaining that
a forced bad pass is sometimes
even better than a sack several
yards behind the line of scrimmage.
Mannini, asked about the second
ary's mistakes this year, offered a
general response about the defen
sive team's lack of concentration
and aggressiveness in recent
weeks.
"The (defensive) problem starts
in front," Mannini said. 'We've been
playing soft in front there hasn't
been a lot of pressure and aggres
sive play. It works its way back.
They're all at fault.
'We know they're young," he
continued. 'We try to have pa
tience, but patience can only be
stretched so far."
Coach Jack Elway, primarily
Stanford's offensive coordinator,
reportedly has been spending time
with the defense this week, watch
ing them during practice and offer
ing critique a job usually consid
ered Mannini's.
