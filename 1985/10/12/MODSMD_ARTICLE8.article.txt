Comments
One of the nation's elite lineback
ers, Taylor likes to be called
Freight Train, a logical nickname
for a Chattanooga Tenn., native
especially one who hits as hard as
he does. But in the Bruins' 5-2
defense, Taylor may occasionally
have to cover Muster coming out of
the backfield a big advantage for
the Cardinal.

Even without its all-time leading
receiver, injured Mike Sherrard,
UCLA will still have some danger
ous men roaming around in the vul
nerable Stanford secondary. One of
them is Dorrell, who was a starter
in 1983 but misssed last season
with a shoulder injury. Cook
returned an interception for a
touchdown last week, and the
Cardinal will need some more big
plays from its secondary today.

The Cardinal defensive line was
virtually non-existent last week
against San Diego State, and the
Bruins' offensive line is at least as
good, if not better, than the Az
tecs'. If Leiker and his linemates
don't play the run well and rush the
passer, UCLA will have a field day
both on the ground and in the air.

The next great UCLA safety, fol
lowing Kenny Easley and Don
Rogers, Washington made
numerous Freshman All-American
teams last season. The fact that he
leads the team in tackles from free
safety either says a lot for him or
not much for the defense. Washing
ton and his secondary mates will
have their hands full with Paye,
who is simply one of the best.

In a game in which kickers figure
to get a lot of opportunities, UCLA
would seem to have a the advan
tage with Lee, a first team All-
American in 1984. This year, Lee
has yet to miss a kick (11 field
goals, 12 extra points). However,
Sweeney hasn't exactly been
shanking the ball either, converting
seven out of eight field goal at
tempts and 12 out of 13 PATs.

In the battle of the kickers, Stanford would seem to be at a disadvantage against UCLA AllAmerican
John Lee. However, Cardinal kicker David Sweeney has been near-perfect this
season, succeeding on seven of eight field goals and 12 of 13 PATs.

When it comes to putting the ball between the uprights, nobody
does it better than UCLA kicker John Lee. An All-American in
1984, Lee has not missed a kick this season, converting 11 field
goals and 12 PATs.
