# Upstart Cardinal Holds off Bruins
## October 6,1984 
### ERIK ESELIUS Editorial staff 
In the past, whenever the
Cardinal played the Bruins at the
Rose Bowl, Stanford perennially
skipped over the victory roses
and ultimately settled for some
ragweed.
Not since 1970 had Stanford
won on UCLA's home soil, and
going into this year's game, his
torical change seemed anything
but likely.
But under the steady guidance
of second-string quarterback
Fred Buckley, a replacement for
an injured John Paye, the Card
inal surprised the Bruins and
most everyone else with a
quick 20-0 lead.
UCLA countered late in the.
second quarter with its own
touchdown effort to close the
first half scoring at 20-7.
With a little more than 10
minutes left, Stanford had a
seemingly safe 23-7 lead. Then
UCLA began its charge, scoring
on a six-yard run. The Bruins
converted on their two-point
conversion to bring the count to
23-15.

After the Cardinal offense
stalled again, the UCLA offense,
which only gained 66 yards on
the ground, continued its
growing momentum. A quick 60-
yard strike to Mike Sherrard
from Bruin quarterback Mike
Stevens closed the gap to 23-21.
UCLA attempted another
two-point conversion, sending
halfback James Primus on a
sweep. Cardinal linebackers
Dave Wyman and Tom Briehl
greeted Primus short of the goal
line to maintain Stanford's slim
margin.
The Bruins' All-American
placekicker John Lee loomed
ominously on the sidelines when
UCLA regained possession with
1:03 left in the game. However,
a swarming Stanford defense
convincingly met the challenge,
stopping the Briuns cold on their
own 31-yard line.
After the game, Cardinal
Coach Jack Elway offered praise
for his defense. "We started with
intensity. Our defense played
with tremendous emotion. We
played a complete football
game," he said.
