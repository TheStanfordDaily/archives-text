### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
For the second time in six months, nine
students were arrested Friday for refusing to
leave Old Union in a protest against apartheid
and Stanford's investments in companies that
do business in South Africa.
Seniors Robby Perkins, David Romo and
Kaylen Worth, sophomore Peter Heslin and
graduate student Cam Baker were taken to
North County Jail in Palo Alto and then to
Santa Clara County Jail in San Jose. Sophia
Raday, the only woman arrested, was taken
to Elmwood Women's Retention Facility in
Milpitas.
All were released early Saturday morning.
The other three protesters — freshman
Robert Shaw, senior Warren Habib and
graduate student Eric Diesel — were issued
citations at the scene of the sit-in and immedi
ately released.
On May 28, nine students protesting Stan
ford's South Africa-related stock holdings
were arrested in a similar action when they
refused to leave the Bursar's Office in Old
Union. Romo was the only one of the current
group that was arrested last spring.
Romo said before he was arrested Friday,
that by committing civil disobedience he and
the others were "resisting Stanford's at
tempts to carry on business as usual, when
this business entails making a profit by the vi
olations of human rights in South Africa.
"I'm not here to force anyone to do any ac
tion, but rather to resist the fact that, as long
as investments are being forced on me as a
member of Stanford University, I share in the
complicity of Stanford" in upholding the racist
apartheid policy in South Africa, Romo said.
The sit-in was meant to be "a demonstra

tion of our commitment and solidarity with
the people of South Africa," according to
Raday.
Diesel said that his participation in the sit
in was partly in response to a meeting he had
earlier Friday with Bob Freelen, the Univer
sity's vice president for public affairs.
According to Diesel, in the meeting he
accused Freelen and the University of not
presenting their case against divestment ac
cording to the rules of fair debate because of
the recent publication of a book entitled
"Stanford and South Africa." Frfeelan
responded, "Sometimes rules aren't fair,"
Diesel said.
"So (by committing civil disobedience) I'm
saying I'm not going to play by the rules
either," Diesel explained.
Students concerned about South Africa
said they are considering more civil dis
obedience in the coming weeks.
An escalation of civil disobedience is a
"very definite possibility," Romo said.
However, University President Donald
Kennedy, who has repeatedly opposed total
divestment, said yesterday that Friday's civil
disobedience or any future civil disobedience
will have no effect in bringing about divest
ment of Stanford's South Africa-related
stock.
"I think the issue really has to be decided
on the merits (of divestment)," Kennedy
said.
Romo and Baker were charged with unlaw
ful assembly, remaining at the scene of a riot,
refusal to disperse from an unlawful assembly
and trespassing — all misdemeanors
punishable by six months in jail or a $500 fine
for each crime.
Perkins, Worth, Heslin and Raday were

rest. Perkins and three others are charging the police
with brutality. See page 3 for related story.

Police charged senior Robert Perkins with trespassing,
refusing to leave the scene of a riot and resisting ar-
also charged with resisting arrest because
they went limp and refused to cooperate with
the police when arrested. All six must appear
in court on Nov. 15.
Shaw, Habib and Diesel were cited with
trespassing, refusal to disperse and unlawful
assembly and must appear in court on Nov
26.
The nine protesters had taken part in a
noon rally that attracted about 200 in the Old
Union courtyard and a legal afternoon sit-in in
the lobby of Old Union. At that gathering,
about 20 demonstrators sat in a circle on the
floor and discussed issues of apartheid and di
vestment in solidarity with apartheid
protesters on about 70 college campuses
recognizing a national day of protest.
During the afternoon, nine members of the
group decided "pretty spontaneously" to
remain in the building after it closed and com
mit civil disobedience, Raday said.
On Friday, the demonstrators were first
asked to leave by University Registrar Sally
Mahoney at 5 p.m.
"The business day of the University is over
and the building is closed. As a University of
ficer, I'm asking you to leave, if you would
please," Mahoney told the protesters. At
5:10 p.m., she repeated the request.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons then
read "The Fundemental Standard" — the
University's code outlining proper student
conduct — to those about to be arrested and
told them that, if they were arrested, they
could face suspensions from the University.
Mahoney then authorized the police to
make the arrests. During the next 10 minutes
police told the protesters four times what the
possible charges against them would be, and
that they had until 5:30 p.m.to clear the build
ing or they would be arrested.
Because Old Union houses many sensitive
documents "there is very little flexibility"
about its closing time, according to Lyons.
At 5:30 p.m., about 12 policemen began
arresting the students, two at a time. Those

arrested were then taken to a small room
near the back door of Old Union to be booked
and photographed.
Romo, Diesel, Baker, Shaw and Habib
cooperated with police and walked to the
room, but Raday, Perkins, Heslin and Worth
went limp and were carried.
All of the protesters later complained that
the police were unnecessarily brutal in their
methods of carrying and photographing those
who refused to cooperate. They said police
twisted their arms, over-tightened their plas
tic handcuffs and lifted them by the front of
their pants to photograph them.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington,
who was present during the entire arrest
process at Old Union, later said, "I don't
think there was any excessive force on the
part of our officers."
All were then offered the option of immedi
ate cite release, but only three accepted, ac
cording to Herrington. The others preferred
to be taken to jail to make a stronger state
ment of their commitment, he said.
However, Perkins later said that he was
not offered cite release.
The five men were then taken to North
County Jail in Palo Alto where Perkins said
that he was stripped and beaten by several
officers. Others said they were intimidated
by the police for their failure to cooperate.
Sgt. Kirts of the Palo Alto police, who
Perkins said was one of the policemen in
volved in his abuse, had no comment on the
incident when contacted Saturday night.
After spending about two hours at the Palo
Alto facility, the five men were taken by bus
to the San Jose jail, according to Perkins.
Raday was taken straight from campus to a
women's facility in Milpitas.
Except for Perkins, the protesters then
cooperated with the police and were released
on their own recognizance. Perkins, who
temporarilly refused to be fingerprinted, was
cite released at about 4 a.m. on Saturday.
"This is what happens when you question
authority — you get your head smashed,"
Romo added, referring to Kennedy's orienta
tion week speech in which he told freshmen
to "question authority."
