### MARK LAWRENCE Editorial staff 
For the second time in six months, nine
students were arrested Friday for refusing to
leave Old Union in a protest against apartheid
and Stanford's investments in companies that
do business in South Africa.
Seniors Robby Perkins, David Romo and
Kaylen Worth, sophomore Peter Heslin and
graduate student Cam Baker were taken to
North County Jail in Palo Alto and then to
Santa Clara County Jail in San Jose. Sophia
Raday, the only woman arrested, was taken
to Elmwood Women's Retention Facility in
Milpitas.
All were released early Saturday morning.
The other three protesters — freshman
Robert Shaw, senior Warren Habib and
graduate student Eric Diesel — were issued
citations at the scene of the sit-in and immedi
ately released.
On May 28, nine students protesting Stan
ford's South Africa-related stock holdings
were arrested in a similar action when they
refused to leave the Bursar's Office in Old
Union. Romo was the only one of the current
group that was arrested last spring.
Romo said before he was arrested Friday,
that by committing civil disobedience he and
the others were "resisting Stanford's at
tempts to carry on business as usual, when
this business entails making a profit by the vi
olations of human rights in South Africa.
"I'm not here to force anyone to do any ac
tion, but rather to resist the fact that, as long
as investments are being forced on me as a
member of Stanford University, I share in the
complicity of Stanford" in upholding the racist
apartheid policy in South Africa, Romo said.
The sit-in was meant to be "a demonstra

tion of our commitment and solidarity with
the people of South Africa," according to
Raday.
Diesel said that his participation in the sit
in was partly in response to a meeting he had
earlier Friday with Bob Freelen, the Univer
sity's vice president for public affairs.
According to Diesel, in the meeting he
accused Freelen and the University of not
presenting their case against divestment ac
cording to the rules of fair debate because of
the recent publication of a book entitled
"Stanford and South Africa." Frfeelan
responded, "Sometimes rules aren't fair,"
Diesel said.
"So (by committing civil disobedience) I'm
saying I'm not going to play by the rules
either," Diesel explained.
Students concerned about South Africa
said they are considering more civil dis
obedience in the coming weeks.
An escalation of civil disobedience is a
"very definite possibility," Romo said.
However, University President Donald
Kennedy, who has repeatedly opposed total
divestment, said yesterday that Friday's civil
disobedience or any future civil disobedience
will have no effect in bringing about divest
ment of Stanford's South Africa-related
stock.
"I think the issue really has to be decided
on the merits (of divestment)," Kennedy
said.
Romo and Baker were charged with unlaw
ful assembly, remaining at the scene of a riot,
refusal to disperse from an unlawful assembly
and trespassing — all misdemeanors
punishable by six months in jail or a $500 fine
for each crime.
