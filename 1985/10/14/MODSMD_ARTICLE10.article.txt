Support Perkins'
Peaceful Protest

On Friday night, Palo Alto police
beat and stripped Stanford student
Robby Perkins. The police ar
rested Robby and eight others
after Stanford officials called for
the removal of students who were
illegally occupying Old Union to
protest the University's invest
ments in South Africa. Robby
refused to cooperate with arresting
officers, along with five others, and
was taken to Palo Alto City Jail
where the police, angered at his
non-cooperation, threw him to the
ground and beat him.
The next day Robby had purple
bruises on his chest, arms,
shoulders, neck and face. He told
me they stripped him when he
refused to take off his clothes,
assaulted him verbally, used their
own hands to beat him, choke him
and bend his legs. Later, they
wrapped chains around him as a
way of degrading his morale.
Throughout the ordeal, Robby was

in tears and pleaded to be let alone
because, as he said simply, he
"refused to cooperate with some
thing that is wrong."
Anyone who knows Robby will
find this all the more appalling.
Before I asked him if he had ver
bally or physically assaulted anyone
that evening, I knew instinctively
that he had not, because he is one
of the most gentle people I have
ever known. In the four years
since I met him, I have never seen
him show anger. He acted simply
out of his principles and his belief
that the University should disin
vest from companies in South
Africa. Although he knew civil
disobedience would lead to his
arrest, in no way did he expect to
experience police brutality.
The University chose to turn
Robby and the others over to the
Stanford police, who then turned
them over to the Palo Alto police.
Robby was the only black student
among those arrested; the police
who beat him were white. Clearly,
Robby was a victim of the very

practice that he was protesting:
the "selective" punishment of
blacks. From the beginning of the
arrest procedure, he was
separated from the others. "You
don't deserve to look at my face,"
said one police officer when he
ordered Robby to face the wall.
It is unclear whether University
officials ever suggested to the
police how they should or should
not treat the protesters. But the
administration did suggest it would
bring its own justice against the
students for "disrupting" the Uni
versity. In his usual understated
manner, Robby said he is
"disappointed" with officials of the
University. I am certain that those
who know Robby are more than
disappointed. One hope* that the
administration has the smarts, and
maybe even the compassion, to
stand by Robby and to drop the
charges brought against him for his
nonviolent statement. He has
already suffered enough "justice."
