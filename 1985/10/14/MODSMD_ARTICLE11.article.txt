## Res Ed's Policy on Freshman Fraternizing 
### 
The editorial which appeared in
the Oct. 7 Daily, "Frat Truce
Needed," contained several errors
which need to be corrected.
On Sept. 17, I sent a letter to 31
self-ops (student-managed
residences) on the Row, urging
residents to avoid interfering with

VIEWPOINT

new-student orientation. Since self
ops have for years been permitted
to open a week early each fall, in or
der to stock their kitchens and
make other preparations for the
opening of school, they are the
residences to which the letter was
sent. The 12 residential fraternities
were not singled out; they did not
even constitute a majority of the
houses which received the letter.
Nineteen other self-op houses
received the same letter.
The purpose of the letter was to
remind residents of self-ops that
new-student orientation is a
valuable and important time at Stan
ford, one in which hundreds of RAs,
RFs, staff and volunteers invest un
counted hours of preparation. It
starts the year for new students —
indeed, it starts their whole Stan
ford experience. It is a time for new
students to become acquainted with
the University, their fellow resi
dents, RFs and RAs — and to begin
forming the relationships and sense
of community that will help them
feel at home here, now and in the
future.

The letter outlined problems en
countered in the past, when resi
dents of the Row disrupted orienta
tion activities. Residents were
asked to avoid those problems and
"in general to be nondisruptive of
the events and goals of freshman
orientation, especially as
mainifested in the residential exper
ience." Residents were reminded
that early opening was a privilege
subject to revokation if there was
interference with orientation again
this year.

Res Ed asked residents of all self-ops,
including fraternities, to avoid past
problems by not disrupting the goals and
events of freshman orientation.

The line in the letter which raised
the most questions was, "Indeed,
because of the importance we place
on freshman experience, it has long
been understood that freshmen are
to be left alone by the upperclass
residential groups for at least their
first quarter on campus." For the
ambiguity of that statement, I
apologize. It was shorthand,
developed over the course of
several years and a great many con
versations, for this: frosh ought to

have enough time to get to know
their fellow residents and residen
tial staff, and to get settled in at
Stanford before they are recruited
— informally or formally — to
membership or residence else
where on campus. It is one reason
that, unlike many other schools,
Stanford does not have an autumn
fraternity and sorority rush.
What we mean by this policy is
that there should be no organized
efforts, the results of which would
work against the residence-based

aspects of the freshman experi
ence. Clearly, individual frosh have
the same rights as any other stu
dents to visit anyone they choose,
anywhere on campus. Residents of
self-ops who asked for clarification
on this point were given it.
Reasonable people may disagree
about where to draw the line to
achieve the goal of not interfering
with freshman orientation. Several
fraternities, most notably Delta
Kappa Epsilon, have devoted con

siderable thought and care to fin
ding ways to be supportive of that
goal while also reaching their own
objectives.
There is no "no flier" policy, nor
has there ever been. The question
of whether any flier advertising
"alcohol-related parties" is best an
swered by reference to the Univer
sity alcohol policy, which applies to
all activities that involve serving al
cohol — wherever they are held
and however they are advertised.
The subject did not arise in the
Sept. 17 letter to self-ops.
There is, however, a policy,
developed after extensive con
versations last year with fraternity
and IFC leadership, that says that
self-ops which were allowed to
open early would not invite frosh to
parties or advertise parties in
houses where frosh live, during the
course of orientation.
Whoever wrote the Oct. 7 edito
rial could easily have obtained a
copy of that policy, and of my letter
of Sept. 17. Doing that would have
put the editorial writer in a better
position to address the issues,
having first discovered what the
facts were. Factual accuracy in the
editorial would not have foreclosed
debate at all. On the contrary, it
would have given interested partici
pants the information they needed
to develop an informed opinion.

houses where frosh live, during the
course of orientation.
Whoever wrote the Oct. 7 edito
rial could easily have obtained a
copy of that policy, and of my letter
of Sept. 17. Doing that would have
put the editorial writer in a better
position to address the issues,
having first discovered what the
facts were. Factual accuracy in the
editorial would not have foreclosed
debate at all. On the contrary, it
would have given interested partici
pants the information they needed
to develop an informed opinion.

The editorial which appeared in
the Oct. 7 Daily, "Frat Truce
Needed," contained several errors
which need to be corrected.
On Sept. 17, I sent a letter to 31
self-ops (student-managed
residences) on the Row, urging
residents to avoid interfering with

VIEWPOINT

new-student orientation. Since self
ops have for years been permitted
to open a week early each fall, in or
der to stock their kitchens and
make other preparations for the
opening of school, they are the
residences to which the letter was
sent. The 12 residential fraternities
were not singled out; they did not
even constitute a majority of the
houses which received the letter.
Nineteen other self-op houses
received the same letter.
The purpose of the letter was to
remind residents of self-ops that
new-student orientation is a
valuable and important time at Stan
ford, one in which hundreds of RAs,
RFs, staff and volunteers invest un
counted hours of preparation. It
starts the year for new students —
indeed, it starts their whole Stan
ford experience. It is a time for new
students to become acquainted with
the University, their fellow resi
dents, RFs and RAs — and to begin
forming the relationships and sense
of community that will help them
feel at home here, now and in the
future.

The letter outlined problems en
countered in the past, when resi
dents of the Row disrupted orienta
tion activities. Residents were
asked to avoid those problems and
"in general to be nondisruptive of
the events and goals of freshman
orientation, especially as
mainifested in the residential exper
ience." Residents were reminded
that early opening was a privilege
subject to revokation if there was
interference with orientation again
this year.

Res Ed asked residents of all self-ops,
including fraternities, to avoid past
problems by not disrupting the goals and
events of freshman orientation.

The line in the letter which raised
the most questions was, "Indeed,
because of the importance we place
on freshman experience, it has long
been understood that freshmen are
to be left alone by the upperclass
residential groups for at least their
first quarter on campus." For the
ambiguity of that statement, I
apologize. It was shorthand,
developed over the course of
several years and a great many con
versations, for this: frosh ought to

have enough time to get to know
their fellow residents and residen
tial staff, and to get settled in at
Stanford before they are recruited
— informally or formally — to
membership or residence else
where on campus. It is one reason
that, unlike many other schools,
Stanford does not have an autumn
fraternity and sorority rush.
What we mean by this policy is
that there should be no organized
efforts, the results of which would
work against the residence-based

aspects of the freshman experi
ence. Clearly, individual frosh have
the same rights as any other stu
dents to visit anyone they choose,
anywhere on campus. Residents of
self-ops who asked for clarification
on this point were given it.
Reasonable people may disagree
about where to draw the line to
achieve the goal of not interfering
with freshman orientation. Several
fraternities, most notably Delta
Kappa Epsilon, have devoted con

siderable thought and care to fin
ding ways to be supportive of that
goal while also reaching their own
objectives.
There is no "no flier" policy, nor
has there ever been. The question
of whether any flier advertising
"alcohol-related parties" is best an
swered by reference to the Univer
sity alcohol policy, which applies to
all activities that involve serving al
cohol — wherever they are held
and however they are advertised.
The subject did not arise in the
Sept. 17 letter to self-ops.
There is, however, a policy,
developed after extensive con
versations last year with fraternity
and IFC leadership, that says that
self-ops which were allowed to
open early would not invite frosh to
parties or advertise parties in
houses where frosh live, during the
course of orientation.
Whoever wrote the Oct. 7 edito
rial could easily have obtained a
copy of that policy, and of my letter
of Sept. 17. Doing that would have
put the editorial writer in a better
position to address the issues,
having first discovered what the
facts were. Factual accuracy in the
editorial would not have foreclosed
debate at all. On the contrary, it
would have given interested partici
pants the information they needed
to develop an informed opinion.
