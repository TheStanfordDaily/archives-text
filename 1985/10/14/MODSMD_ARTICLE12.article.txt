# Build Schools, Not Bombs
## 
### 
Brookville, Indiana cannot build a badly needed new
school. Sufficient funds do not exist for the building.
Taxes cannot be raised because Brookville's economy
is based on agriculture, and farmers already hopelessly
in debt cannot be asked to pay more taxes. The bottom
line is: Education is suffering.
The roads in and around Brookville, like many roads
in this country, are also in bad shape. Either laden with
potholes, or breaking up into sections that produce the
"kachung kachung" noise when driving over them —
the roads are in poor condition. Sufficient money does
not exist to maintain them. A long, bumpy ride to a too
old and too crowded school is a fact of life for Brook
ville students.
But where is all of the money? Like anyone else,
citizens of the area see a large percentage of their
income eaten by the Internal Revenue Service. Why is
it that, with all the taxation in this country, enough
money to build a school in this Midwestern town cannot
be found? Where are taxes going?
Well, a large portion of them are going to build nu-

clear bombs. You know, missiles — our friends,
defenders of the American way and the rest of the
Western world. You can stop anyone out on the street
and they will tell you, "If it wasn't for nuclear missiles,
Russia would attack us right now." I don't dispute that
the Soviet Union is a rival superpower, and I don't
dispute that we should be strong against such a for
midable enemy. But I see no reason to have poor
public schools and poor roads — in other words a lower
standard of living — in order to build enormous num
bers of nuclear bombs.
It is wrong to drain America's great wealth to build
weapons that we can never seriously hope to use. The

United States has fallen into a paranoia in which we are
spending most of our resources on a suicide defense
and in the process sacrificing the concept we are trying
to defend — a strong America. You can argue that the
missiles are for deterrence, but I believe in a different
kind of deterrence, a positive kind.
In my form of deterrence, education is the first line
of defense. Educated people are not fooled as easily by
propaganda, either Soviet or American-inspired. Ed
ucated people can make better judgments on govern
ment policy, as well as who to vote for and why. If, in
stead of bombs, we would massively improve educa
tion, we would have a large, educated population that
would be better able to make a rational decision on an
issue like "Star Wars," for example, instead of having a
large glut of sheep-like people who enthusiastically arid
ignorantly follow anyone standing before them with;a
microphone.
And instead of nuclear missiles, let's build roads.
Let's repair our aging interstate system. Or let's take
some more defense money and build a rapid-train sys
tem between large cities, similar to those existing in
France and Japan. Let's build a space station. Let's
colonize the moon. Let's send a mission to Mars. Let's
bail out Social Security. Let's spend money on things
that will recirculate the wealth throughout the eco
nomy. Let's not put our money into a weapon and then
hide that weapon in the ground, never to be used and
never to circulate money in the economy.
We have the potential in the United States to do
great things, but we are held down by our production
of weapons of doom. I'm not closing my eyes to nuclear
weapons. We must keep and maintain a strong nuclear
arsenal. But let's stop our progression toward being a
hollow shell. Let's become super-strong internally as
well. We can become a Utopian society, with the best
schools, the best roads and the best social programs in
the world.
Amazing things could be done with the money being
spent on defense or, more realistically, with 50 percent
of the money. We might even be able to build Brook
ville a school.
