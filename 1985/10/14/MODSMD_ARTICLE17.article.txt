## You, Your Bike And Mr. Fix-It 
### AMY FRANCETIC Staff writer 
With over 10,000 bicycles wheeling about campus, cycling is obviously
the most popular mode of transportation here.
Students have bikes in styles ranging from the lazy, boardwalk cruiser
to the basket-bedecked, grandma-style Schwinn or the ever-present 10-
speed. But when the last 10 minutes of the hour roll around, they're all
equals in the pedaling frenzy as students careen from one class to another.
To help you prepare for the hazards of buying, riding and maintaining a
bike, Keith Moranz, the owner and manager of the Campus Bike Shop, of
fers some tips learned from years of experience mediating in sometimes
touchy owner/bike relations.
Moranz offers students advice on bike selection. "Centurians —
Japanese made bikes — are one of the best values. Sekai is also a good
bike for less money," he said.
According to Moranz, the Bike Shop "tries to make prices competitive
so students can take advantage of the convenience of the store right here
on campus."
Fall is the busy season for the Bike Shop, and Moranz said that during
boom periods the shop is overwhelmed because of lack of space.
This doesn't mean you won't be able to procure a two-wheeled wonder.
Once you do have your bike, there are some precautions you can take to
avoid damages of both the costly and annoying sort.
First, beware the many areas under construction, because they in
crease your risk of wipe-outs.
Also, 300 bikes are stolen annually on campus. To avoid participating in
such statistics, students should lock their bikes with a high-security U-lock
to a stationary object.
Plus, bikers should register their cycles at Tresidder Union Recreation
Center as soon as possible. This is required by the California Vehicle code
and makes recovering a stolen bike easier.
Should your bike escape theft, it's almost inevitable that it will encounter
some minor problems.
"The most frequent problems we repair are due to neglect, like brake
cables, and lots of flat tires from thorns on campus," Moranz said. The es
pecially thorn-ridden areas you should avoid are Escondido Village and
Stanford Avenue near Bowdoin Street.
Heavy duty inner tubes and special puncture resistant tire liners can
help prevent common flats.
As for neglect, Moranz said that bikers should visually check for loose
parts and fix them before they develop into serious problems.
"Students should lubricate their bikes once during the dry season and
once a month when it rains," he said.
The rainy season creates slick roads and decreases visibility, so bikers
should ride slower and brake earlier than usual when the pavement is wet.
With these precautions in mind, you can look forward to safer and less
expensive, if not less congested, riding.
