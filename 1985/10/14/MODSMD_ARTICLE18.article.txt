# Banks Aren't in Money's Best Interest
## 
### CHRIS LOUGHRIDGE KEN SAWYER 
If someone on a street corner said what
we're going to say to you now, chances are
you would walk the other way in a hurry, but
since we're writing ft in The Daily, maybe
you'll believe us. Here goes.
Would you like to know an easy way to earn
an additional $579 a year?
No, hashers haven't gotten a raise and you
won't have to donate any body parts to merit
this windfall profit.
All that's involved is a little time spent
researching the alternatives to banking, then
an educated decision or two and some more
time spent maintaining the plan you do
choose to adopt.
One way might be to open up a money
market account.
While most students probably won't think
of talking to a stock broker until several years
after they have graduated, it may make sense
to do so now.
If you had done so last year, you might
have earned that additional $579 we men
tioned just in interest income alone.
Money Market accounts offered by com
mercial brokerage firms provide significantly
higher interest rates than generic checking
accounts.
What is more, these increasingly popular
accounts often offer additional advantages, in
cluding use of a credit card, stock trading
privileges, extended credit, "float" and com
prehensive statements of financial position.
The U.S. Government regulates banks and
savings and loan institutions more heavily
than commercial brokerage houses. This
means the brokerage firms can invest the
deposited funds in less restricted ways, ear
ning higher returns with the money.
These higher returns are then passed on to
the depositor, you.
You don't have to bank on it
For example, Wells Fargo's standard
interest-bearing checking account yields 5.25
percent interest while Dean Witter's money

market fund, called an ILA, yields 7.41 per
cent right now.
Merril Lynch's Ready Asset Fund also
does quite well, yielding 7.71 percent.
(These rates vary daily because the invest
ments made by the brokerage firms depend
on the market interest rate.)
While the difference between standard
interest-bearing accounts and money market
funds may seem trivial at first, consider how
much you would have Saved if you had in
vested last year's tuition in one of these ac
counts instead of leaving it in your bank.
The difference turns out to be $579.30

(9.24 percent vs. 5.378 percent effective an
nual yield on $15,000).
Eeny meeny
There are two basic types of money mar
ket funds, both with different advantages and
restrictions.
The first type usually offers unlimited
check writing privileges as long as the checks
are written for an amount over $500. There
are usually no minimum balance and no fees.
However, they do require an initial deposit of
between $1,000 and $5,000.
Accounts of these types are offered by

Merrill Lynch (Ready Assets Fund), Pruden
tial Bache (Money Market Fund) and Dean
Witter (ILA) to name a few. These funds
currently pay between 7.26 percent and 7.71
percent interest.
The second type of account offers even
more features: unlimited check writing
privileges, use of a credit card (VISA or
American Express), the ability to purchase
stocks directly through the account without
having to transfer funds and the privileges of
margin purchases (the purchase of common
stocks or bonds on credit).
These accounts usually charge a small an
nual fee — generally between $35 and $100
— and an initial investment of between
$5,000 and $20,000. However, there are
usually no minimum balance requirements.
Just about every brokerage firm offers this
type of money market account.
And now for the good news
Another advantage of having a money mar
ket account of either type comes from living
in California.
Almost all of the large brokerage firms
have their banks on the East Coast. This
causes something called float, which is inter
est earned on money you've already spent.
For example, assume you go to registra
tion on a Tuesday and write a check from
your money market account for your quar
ter's tuition.
While Stanford is satisfied that you've paid,
the fact of the matter is that your money is
still in your account and is still drawing inter
est.
In all probability that check will take at
least a week until it reaches the East Coast
and the money is actually withdrawn from
your account. These seven days of interest
for a $5,000 tuition check is worth almost 10
fro-yos — or a $7.39 shopping spree at The
Store — every quarter.
For holding tuition and other large sums of
money, money market accounts with com
mercial brokerage firms make a lot of sense.

the Stanford community.
